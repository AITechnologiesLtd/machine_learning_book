<P>Interviews with actor Ethan Hawke and director Michael Almereyda of "Hamlet"</P>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Ethan Hawke slides into the plush leather chair at the press table with a
smile just as comfortable; his upbeat, talkative demeanor nearly mock his
timid, shaking (often sweaty) screen persona.</P>
<P>(On Hamlets)
It's a testament to why the piece is a masterpiece because everybody brings
something different to it. He's so multifaceted everybody who attacks it
focuses on a different side of the character. Mel Gibson had him real
rambunctious, reminded me of the guy in "Lethal Weapon," which was a good
thing.</P>
<P> Mostly these other guys who played hamlet were too old. In a modern sense
he's much more of a Holden Caulfield or a Kurt Cobain. Many of his dilemmas
are a young man's dilemmas ... Seeking meaning, feeling overshadowed by your
parents feeling lost and overwhelmed by society ...</P>
<P>We wanted to make it as accessible as possible ... Allow for the audience to
experience ... in a new way and treat it not as some old dusty thing that is
very precious but to break down those walls and let the character's
emotional life live in a new way.</P>
<P>Shakespeare purists, people who really know a lot about Shakespeare will
love it, because they just want it to be a living breathing art form. If you
have some idea in your head that British people are they only people who do
it right, then you're not gonna like it. But I don't follow in that
school... Despite the modern setting, when the movie is done it's the play
that resonates.</P>
<P>(On work and family life)
If you don't make your family a priority then you'll loose them. So now I
try to do things that I really believe in, get the most bang for my buck,
thus "Hamlet."</P>
<P>(On literature)
I wrote a novel, "The Hottest State" came out a couple years ago, it was a
really fun experience for me. The book is about a twenty-year-old guy who's
so in love with a girl that he loses his mind. I was so interested in doing
something else, because I've been in movies since I was young. At the time,
I was adamant to not make a movie out of it, but as time goes by ... I
might.</P>
<P> (On philosophy)
We live in a community which tries to box us all in. Like you're a
journalist, you just do this or you just do that ... you can't also be a
musician. You know... I just resent that. I think we're all a lot more than
that.</P>
<P>(On other film activities...)
I just directed a picture on DV. I got turned on by "The Celebration" and
how cheaply you can make a movie. If it's any good ... it's call "The last
word on Paradise" it's mildly inspired by Dylan Thomas' "Under Milkwood"
which is it all takes place in a hotel over the course of a day and involves
about 35 people. The hope is to illustrate how close we are in proximity,
and how cut off from each other we are, how similar all our experiences are
but how separate we all feel.</P>
<P>(Favorite non-film thing to do...)
Take my daughter to the park and play guitar, which unfortunately she
doesn't like me to do .. "No daddy No."</P>
<PRE>(On Music)
I listen to a lot of Beck and a band called Wilco.</PRE>
<P>Michael Almereyda, eloquent in his soft-spoken boyish manner, replaces Ethan
in the pressroom.
(On his contemporary interpretation of Hamlet)
It never occurred to be not to do it modern. I was thinking about other
plays, but this one seemed to be chasing me.</P>
<P>< I couldn't pretend I had a high-cultured British background. [Besides]
it's been done beautifully. I wanted to address it in terms I understood
that were specifically American, the entire cast is American except for a
couple Irish people thrown in for good luck.</P>
<P>Every spoken line is by Shakespeare, the original language is very in tact
as much as it's been cut I hope it's more of a distillation than anything
else ... in an attempt to get to the essence of the play.</P>
<P>There's so much that's great. There is no definitive Hamlet, there's
variance, different versions, ... it wasn't published in Shakespeare's
lifetime. It's an unruly play an unwieldy play, part of the challenge and
excitement about taking it on is that you have to make cuts. You have to
decide what means the most.</P>
<P>That's the nature of Shakespeare is that he accommodates extremes, invites
them and demands them in a way. The adaptation was done with an element of
respect. The way you can respect Shakespeare the most is not being too
precious not being to reverent because these plays were always done as
popular entertainment they were meant for big crowds. They were meant for
mass audiences. A scholar explained the Globe theatre had a seating capacity
of 2000. I never realized that. The plays are still alive and kicking, the
idea was to pack it with spirit.</P>
<P>(On Bill Murray)
He's is one of my favorite actors ... He brings a peculiar kind of
tenderness to the role, he warms it up.</P>
<P>He was my first choice, I was glad to have an excuse to work with him and he
was glad to be excused to work with Bill Shakespeare (Laughs).</P>
<P>(On Ethan Hawke)
I think he's just turned twenty-nine ... but he was twenty-seven at the time
we shot it and he looks particularly boyish with the right lighting
(chuckles). He was the first one I thought of for the role and the first one
I went to. I had a six-page treatment, on the basis of the treatment he said
yes. He's an old friend, and when he said yes understanding we'd be shooting
on 16mm and everyone working for scale, we knew we could raise the money.
[Two million]. Without him the movie wouldn't exist for a second. From that
point we had the luxury of inviting our favorite actors to participate, the
key was I needed final cut because I had some bad experiences before. And
that's why the budget is so tight.</P>
<P>(On small budget independents)
We didn't always have permits, sometimes we were just charging around. New
York is pretty filmmaker friendly, you don't have to pay for the streets,
you just gotta get the permits. We went super sixteen because we wanted the
movie to be above all intimate, and you can be more mobile with the smaller
cameras.</P>
<P>I wasn't any more obsessed than when making any other movie - I just thought
I was having fun.</P>
<P>The challenging thing is that the movie was done so cheaply, with everyone
working at scale, and we didn't have much time especially to rehearse, we
were flying at times, so there's an edge of panic to it that I wouldn't have
minded deducting.</P>
<P>I like big budget films. My favorite movie last year was "The Matrix", but
it's maybe my character, my sensibility that makes me think I won't be
having big budgets to work with. I just get a sense that in order to make
films and retain final cut I'll probably stay independent.</P>
<PRE>Press: Is there a downside to making independent films?
MA: Poverty...</PRE>
