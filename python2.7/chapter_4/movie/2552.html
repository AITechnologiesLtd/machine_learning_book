<P>     Robin Williams is a prehistoric caveman named Hector who loses his 
wife and children to a group of seafaring marauders.  Robin Williams,  
again named Hector, is a slave to a tunic-wearing John Turturro during 
Roman times.  Hector is also a medieval wanderer who takes up with a 
beautful widow (Anna Galiena), a 16th-century Portuguese nobleman who is 
marooned on the African coast, and an angst-riddled modern day divorced 
father trying to get to know his kids. </P>
<P>     All-in-all, Hector is a lot of people.  Too bad his overall story 
is essentially pointless.  Not only are the five different eras poorly 
connected, but the individual stories are dull and fragmented, crying out 
for a unification and closure that BEING HUMAN never supplies.  When it's 
all over, the most likely reaction will be "Who cares?" </P>
<P>     Having one actor play five different characters through the mil- 
lennia would lead the viewer to expect a tale involving karma and fate.  
However, the links between the various Hectors are tenuous, and with the 
exception of the first and last episodes (where the main character loses, 
then finds, his children), the only connections are Williams, the sea, 
priests searching for the meaning of symbols, and an odd obsession with 
footgear. </P>
<P>     Seeing Robin Williams' name on a theater marquee immediately 
creates expectations of a certain humor - even when a serious role is 
anticipated.  Unfortunately, in this case, the actor is kept strictly 
reigned in and the resultant comedy - what little of it there is - is 
muted and awkward.   </P>
<P>     Theresa Russell's flippant narrative is exceptionally annoying - a 
running series of trite comments that try to be both profound and witty, 
yet end up being neither.  I generally don't like voiceovers, but rarely 
have I found one this intrusive. </P>
<P>     The modern-day segment is the most successful, chiefly because the 
characters are the easiest to identify with.  The caveman story, with 
Williams looking too much like the hermit from the beginning of MONTY 
PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS, is almost laughable with its monosyllabic 
conversations and difficult-to-fathom plot.  The other three parts fall 
in between, both in terms of time period and quality. </P>
<P>     The cast is solid, giving it a game try even when the script verges 
on the embarrassing.  As a vehicle for Williams "the serious actor",  
BEING HUMAN is a dud.  While the excesses of TOYS are undesirable, giving  
a performer of Williams' temperament so little freedom quenches his fire. </P>
<P>     For all of its existential posturing, BEING HUMAN ends up being a 
rather shallow motion picture.  As for the film's scope...well, the 
costumes are nice.  Unfortunately, we end up stuck in five places that 
aren't very interesting with characters we never get to know or care 
about.  Robin Williams may have gone from two personalities in MRS. 
DOUBTFIRE to five here, but the results prove the old saying that
sometimes less is more. </P>
