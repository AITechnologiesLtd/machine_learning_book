GET OVER IT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>GET OVER IT, by director Tommy O'Haver (BILLY HOLLYWOOD'S SCREEN KISS) 
and writer R. Lee Fleming, Jr. (SHE'S ALL THAT), suffers from a bad case 
of the two-movies-in-one syndrome.  One movie is a promising, albeit 
unoriginal, teen romance in which Berke (Ben Foster) loves Allison 
(Melissa Sagemiller), who has broken up with him in order to date a more 
popular kid, Striker (Shane West), a former member of a boy band.  All 
the while, Berke stays good friends with Kelly (Kirsten Dunst, BRING IT 
ON), who would be a much better choice for him if he would just realize 
it.</P>
<P>The second movie is a traditional crude teen comedy complete with a 
horse who urinates profusely on a guy's face and a dog who has sex with 
every inanimate object he passes.  A bad Martin Short -- Is there any 
other lately? -- chews up the scenery as an obnoxious high school play 
director who looks like Bobby Darren dressed as the devil.  He says 
things like, "Me thinks thou better not botch it," to his cast.  This 
second movie feels almost like an afterthought in order to obtain studio 
funding.  The first movie doesn't deserve this crude level of humor.</P>
<P>Containing several imaginative dream sequences and a cute ending with a 
musical adaptation of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream," GET 
OVER IT could have been a sweet little movie.  Instead, we end up 
feeling sorry for the two likable leads, Foster and Dunst, who have to 
endure all of the story's failed attempts at making recycled bathroom 
humor funny.</P>
<P>GET OVER IT runs 1:25.  It is rated PG-13 for some crude/sexual humor, 
teen drinking and language and would be acceptable for teenagers.  </P>
