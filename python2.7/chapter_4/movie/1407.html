<PRE>                                  ZENTROPA
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  A weird and hypnotic film, but
     ultimately a disappointment.  The viewer is apparently
     hypnotized and regressed to be a German-American in Germany
     shortly after WWII.  He becomes a train conductor pulled into
     the conflict of the Americans against the anti-American
     resistance.  Rating: high 0 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     You are being hypnotized and regressed to an earlier existence.  The
hypnotist puts you to sleep and makes you live the life of an American of
German descent who went to Germany a few months after World War II ended to
become a sleeping car conductor.  You are under the supervision of a stern
uncle whom you have just met, and he pushes you through a Kafkaesque world
that places impossible demands on you, all to meet the incredibly high
standards of being a sleeping car conductor on the Zentropa train line.  But
this is only the beginning.  You are about to be drawn into an intrigue that
pits the Americans occupying Germany against werewolves--the secret German
resistance against the occupation.</P>
<P>     ZENTROPA is a complex and confusing film, very heavy on style.
Sometimes it is dense with ideas, sometimes totally incomprehensible.  It is
filmed mostly in black and white with selective use of color.  Some scenes
are all black and white, some are all color, some have only the foreground
in color.  Sometimes just one object will be in color like in a Nuprin ad.
The black-and-white photography is usually crisp and sharp, with some
amazing images.  One of the best is a train speeding through a tunnel seen
from a few feet ahead with the smoke forming a streaming "hair-do" over the
top of the train.</P>
<P>     ZENTROPA (original title: EUROPA) is Danish director Lars Van Triers's
strange look at Germany after war.  Parts of the world seem as if they could
never have been.  The Zentropa Railroad is a world out of BRAZIL crossed
with Kafka in which the individual is beaten into submission by the system.
In the film's one obvious joke, our main character has just had to pay for
his uniform--which nevertheless belongs to the company--and several other
expenses he must pay in order to start work on the railroad.  "I now
understand German unemployment," he says.  "Nobody can afford to work."</P>
<P>     Ultimately ZENTROPA is a muddled thriller that only partly makes sense.
The viewer is never certain if the historical detail has any validity or is
being made up from the whole cloth.  There are certainly moments of tension,
but more of confusion.  It won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film festival of
1991, but lost out to BARTON FINK for the Golden Palm, at which Van Trier
reportedly was extremely indignant.  Stylistically it is an achievement, but
the viewer will have to decide if it is really is an entertainment
experience.  For me it had all the elements to work but a few logical
questions left unanswered.  For that I rate it a high 0 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
