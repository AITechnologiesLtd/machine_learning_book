                         (IN WEITER FERNE, SO NAH!)
                       A film review by Daniel Nesmith

<P>     They're all around us; though we think they're far away, they're
really quite close.  At least in Berlin.  "They" are the angels.  In
Wenders's WINGS OF DESIRE (DER HIMMEL UEBER BERLIN) we met them for
the first time.  They live in an abstract world of black and white,
observing us, comforting us.  They are, they emphasize, "messengers,
not the message."  Wenders's FARAWAY, SO CLOSE!, which won the special
jury prize at Cannes this year, returns once again to Berlin.</P>
<P>     An angel, giving up his powers in order to become human, to feel
and hear, to taste and smell for the first time, is once again
Wenders's theme.  In WINGS OF DESIRE (WOD), the angel Damiel (Bruno
Ganz) became human for the love of a woman.  His friend Cassiel (Otto
Sanders), who is the focal point of FARAWAY, SO CLOSE! (FSC), becomes
human almost accidentally when he can no longer remain just an
observer, and must intervene in our world.  Unlike Damiel, who has
become an entrepreneur in post-Wall Berlin with a family and friends,
Cassiel, though unselfish and self-sacrificing, does not know where to
begin.  He quickly finds himself in trouble, and his good intentions
only lead to tragedy.</P>
<P>     Willem Dafoe as Emit Flesti makes Cassiel's life difficult.  Dafoe
turns in a wonderful performance; his aggressive verbal sparring with
still-angel Raphaela (Nastassja Kinski), as well as his lecturing of
Cassiel, is a treat.</P>
<P>     The plot of the film is winding and not completely easy to follow,
reminding one of Wenders's UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD (UEW), and there
are many themes involved.   Once again Peter Falk (playing himself) is
in Berlin, this time for an exhibit of his drawings.  Falk's role is
here larger than in WOD, and less introspective.  The plot of the movie
which Falk was supposedly making in WOD becomes a subplot in FSC, with
the German-born American Anton Becker (Ingo Schmitz) returning to
Berlin and looking for his sister, from whom he was separated during
the war.  Unfortunately, Tony has become something of a gangster during
his years in Detroit, and Cassiel becomes his servant.</P>
<P>     There are funny moments in FSC, such as Tony's rescue by Cassiel
from his Mafia enemies, as well as some very touching scenes, where
Cassiel wonders "why can't I be good?"  Sanders, whose role in WOD was
secondary, does a masterful job of playing the man who wants only to do
the right thing, but who can't quite pull it off.  A man who wishes he
could go back to being an angel.</P>
<P>     One could call FSC something of a hybrid between WOD (very
intellectual, little action) and UEW (fast-moving, humor-filled, but
rambling and disorganized, unfocused ideas).  Ironically, FSC (as UEW
was) is a victim of one of its own themes: that time for us humans is
fleeting, that there is so much to do.  Wenders has tried to pack more
into this film (which runs just under two and a half hours) than it can
hold.  The murkiness of some plot turns is unsettling.  There is some
heavy-handed symbolism (such as Dafoe's character's name), and many
references to Germany's racial problems, past and present.  Gorbachev,
certainly a hero in Germany, makes a cameo in an appearance that could
have been written by his own public relations firm.</P>
<P>     Still, the film, while flawed, is well worth seeing.  Not for
those who are shy of subtitles (at least five languages are used at
times).</P>
<PRE>     Three stars (out of four).</PRE>
<PRE>.
