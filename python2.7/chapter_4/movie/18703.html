Susan Granger's review of "MARRIAGE IN THE 20th CENTURY: IN SEARCH OF
THE HAPPY ENDING" on SHOWTIME TV</PRE>
<P>Six top Hollywood filmmakers take an entertaining and
provocative look at the issues of the millennium in a new SHOWTIME
series titled "In the 20th Century." Using archival material,
interviews with experts, and newly-shot footage, these feature-length
documentaries will air on a monthly basis, beginning Monday, June 14,
at 10 P.M. with "Marriage in the 20th Century," hosted by director
Garry Marshall, who has been married to the same woman for 36
years. In addition to his own family experience, he has often explored
the topic in his work - from "The Lucy Show" and "Happy Days" to
"Pretty Woman" and the upcoming "Runaway Bride." His favorite
characters are often looking for love and hoping for a fairytale
ending that comes with a marriage proposal and a ring. Using the set
of "Runaway Bride" as a starting point, he embarks on a journey which
reveals how marriage has changed throughout the century. Whether it's
a civil ceremony presided over by a justice of the peace or a more
colorful visit to a drive-up wedding chapel in Las Vegas, where the
bride is given away by an Elvis impersonator, he reveals that the ways
in which couples marry are as varied as the reasons they decide to
take the leap. Marshall candidly delves into inter-racial and
homosexual marriage, plus the once-taboo issue of divorce. I felt that
this heartfelt homage to marriage was at least a half-hour too long,
as Marshall repeatedly emphasizes that, despite the pitfalls, people
will inevitably continue the search for a happy ending. If you miss
Monday night's segment, it will be repeated on June 30 at 12:15
A.M.. Future episodes include Barry Levinson on "The Future," Robert
Townsend on "Sex," Norman Jewison on "Comedy," Gregory Nava on "The
American Dream," and Robert Zemeckis on "Smoking, Drinking, and
Drugging." They all should be worth watching.</P>
