<PRE>A film review by Chris Loar</PRE>
<P>_The Dead Zone_ is an entertaining bit of fluff from the normally
rather more controversial David Cronenberg.  It's taken from a novel
by Stephen King, but it's not the King novel I'd have suggested that
Cronenberg direct; he could have done much more with something a
bit more visceral -- _Salem's Lot_, perhaps.  From what I remember
of it, King's novel is pretty low-key, an effort at something more
internal and psychological; Cronenberg, on the other hand, is anything
but low-key, and the ill-conceived match here yields a film that,
while not exactly bad, isn't terribly compelling, either.</P>
<P>The story is rather faithful to the novel, and revolves around Johnny
Smith (Christopher Walken) who, following a serious injury, spends five
years in a coma and emerges with psychic powers -- the ability to see
the future.  Unfortunately, Johnny doesn't get to see any of the good
stuff that might happen -- he only sees tragedy, impending doom, death,
despair, catastrophe -- that sort of thing.  Johnny, not surprisingly,
isn't entirely happy about all this, and since his visions are
intensified by human contact, he becomes increasingly reclusive and
antisocial, hoping to rid himself of the agony of everyone's eventual
death.  He's is brought partially out of his shell by a young man who
he's hired to tutor; and, before long, he's pried out the rest of the
way by a premonition of world war -- a war that might be brought about
by a Perot-esque politician, Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen).  Johnny takes
decisive action for perhaps the first time in his life, and ends up (I
don't think I'm giving away too much here) saving the world, quite
literally.</P>
<P>_The Dead Zone_ is, as I mentioned, a bit of a stretch for Cronenberg;
it's not especially gory and it's not particularly provocative.  There's
no sign of Cronenberg's usual distortions and transformations of the
human body, and it's visually uninspired -- just another Hollywood
knockoff of a Stephen King novel, when it comes down to it.  There's
nothing especially wrong with that, of course, and Cronenberg does it
as well as anyone; _Dead Zone_ is a competent thriller with a few
frightening moments.</P>
<P>But no one involved in the production is at their peak.  Christopher   
Walken
is convincingly passive when he needs to be, and he manages to look
appropriately twitchy when he's in the throes of one of his "episodes,"
but he hasn't yet developed that signature creepyness that makes him so
much fun to watch in films like _True Romance_ and _Last Man Standing_.
Martin Sheen is, of course, convincingly charismatic, but he's never   
quite
as terrifying as he needs to be.  And cinematographer Mark Irwin (fresh
from _Videodrome_ himself) doesn't seem to have any ideas to spruce   
things
up; there are a few nicely claustrophobic shots, but nothing remarkable.
It's a film to see if you love Stephen King, or are intent on seeing
Cronenberg's entire body of work, or get a special charge out of stories
about clairvoyants.  Otherwise, you can safely give it a miss.</P>
