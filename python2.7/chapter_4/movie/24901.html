THE SEVEN SAMURAI
(SHICHININ NO SAMURAI)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Work of art can have its quality measured by other works of
art it inspired through time. The world of seventh art has
plenty of such examples, and the best known are those which
had inspired numerous remakes through decades. Among those
remade movies the best are those that contain images,
stories and characters deeply ingrained in the collective
unconsciousness of their viewers, regardless of their
cultural background. Probably the best known of such films
is SEVEN SAMURAI, 1954 film by famous Japanese director
Akira Kurosawa. This is equally famous for being the best
example of "jidai-geki" (samurai picture) genre - Japanese
equivalent of western - and for being inspiration for
numerous other authors which had used its basic concept for
movies set in different time periods, different locations
and belonging to different genres.</P>
<P>The plot of this movie, loosely based on ancient Japanese
legend, is set in late 16th Century Japan. The country is in
the middle of civil war, the government authority has
collapsed and the countryside is left the roaming hordes of
bandits. One of such gangs made a habit out of plundering a
mountain village after each harvest and leaving barely
enough food for peasants to survive. This time the village
had been hit by especially hard times, and after one of the
peasants accidentally overhears bandits discussing plans for
their next visit, village council is ready to listen to
young Rikichi (played by Yoshio Tsuchiya) who wants to fight
bandits. But the villagers also know that they lack combat
skills necessary to match dozens of well- armed thugs.
Village elder Gisaku (played by Kokoden Kodo) advises them
to go to town and hire services of ronins, masterless
samurais, whose martial expertise would defend the village.
When the group of peasants come to town, they see plenty of
ronins, many of them penniless, but almost none would
humiliate himself by offering his services to common
peasants for three meals of rice per day. Their search is
fruitless until they meet Kambei Shimada (played by Takashi
Shimura), old, experienced but kind-hearted samurai who
agrees to help them. He and his apprentice/disciple
Katsushiro (played by Isao Kimura) gather four other ronins
and six of them head for the mountains, followed by vagabond
and samurai wannabe Kikujiro (played by Toshiro Mifune). The
small army arrives in the village, greeted by scepticism,
fear and distrust from the peasants, but they nevertheless
begin preparations for defence.</P>
<P>When Kurosawa died, many obituaries called him the God of
Cinema, and it was hardly an exaggeration. Anyone who
watches THE SEVEN SAMURAI would understand why. Fans of
Peckinpah, Lucas, Spielberg, Millius, Cameron and almost any
respected modern-day action director would see many familiar
scenes and motives in this film, made almost a half century
ago. The influence Kurosawa had on future filmmakers is
immeasurable, yet his films still look fresh, original and
very modern. THE SEVEN SAMURAI, despite its black-and-white
photography and despite its huge length (203 minutes in
original cut), can be put in the same category with action
classics like DIE HARD and ALIENS. This also explains why
Kurosawa's work sticks out as the only B&W classic among
entries in many personal Top 10 or Top 100 movie lists.</P>
<P>This movie is so successful because of its flawless
direction and very balanced combination of powerful human
drama and exciting action. Unlike most of the action
directors today, Kurosawa knew that the audience wouldn't be
satisfied just with the elaborate action scenes; audience
needs characters to identify with it. Script by Kurosawa,
Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni is based on the very
simple plot, but this plot is used as base for the whole
series of interesting subplots and character studies. Never
allowing the film to become stale and boring, Kurosawa
slowly but methodically unfolds the plot and develops his
characters, less through dialogue and more through the
simple but revealing gestures. For that Kurosawa had to rely
on very talented actors and he was very lucky to have more
than adequate crew for the job. The top of the list is
Takashi Shimura, descendant of real life samurai, who gives
quiet yet powerful performance as the leader of small army;
every community in the world would probably appreciate
having someone like him in times of need. Seiji Myaguchi is
also remarkable in the role of ascetic yet deadly samurai
Kyuzo, same as Isao Kimura as young Katsushiro, forced to
learn some ugly lessons in life. Yoshio Tsuchiya is great as
Rikichi, hotheaded peasant who is deeply traumatised by
personal tragedy. The best known of them all is, of course,
Toshiro Mifune, Kurosawa's favourite actor, who gives more
than memorable portrayal of Kikujiro, lowlife who begins the
film as comic relief and gradually evolves into real hero.</P>
<P>Kurosawa, having such great characters and such great actors
on his disposal, established rather interesting
interactions, but that didn't interest him only on
individual level. Like very few action movies before and
after, THE SEVEN SAMURAI actually deals with broader social
issues. In the context of 16th Century Japan this issue was
class conflict between peasants and feudal class, embodied
in samurai. Kurosawa always keeps viewers aware of such
conflict - peasants and samurai can live and work together,
but this relationship is temporary and based only on short-
term interest. Both classes are inimical towards each other
- samurai look on the peasants like inferior beings, while
peasants mistrust samurai. Character of Kikujiro explicitly
explains this class conflict through memorable and powerful
monologue. This social dimension of THE SEVEN SAMURAI,
although it could be replanted from feudal Japan through
different times and places, wasn't very convincingly used in
this film's remakes (which is especially the case with
American 1960 version).</P>
<P>Despite having a story with universal appeal, Kurosawa has
put a lot of effort for historical accuracy in THE SEVEN
SAMURAI. Clothes, houses and folklore of 16th Century rural
Japan are painstakingly recreated, as well as the weapons
and armour of the samurai. But the best thing about this
historical reconstruction is Kurosawa's great care about
combat scene. Fighting in THE SEVEN SAMURAI doesn't just
look exciting, it is very realistic and, unlike most of the
war and action movies, it actually makes sense. Individuals
play very limited role, just like in any other war; unlike
Rambo movies with superhuman heroes that eliminate hundreds
of well-armed opponents, superior numbers, tactics, training
and firepower does matter. Samurai might be superior in
one-on-hand and hand-to-hand combat (such fights are very
short and decided in matter of seconds), but even they are
powerless against bandits' firearms. Victory comes out of
collective action, with few making painful sacrifices for
the benefits of the many. Same as in any military textbook
from Sun Zi to this day, good planning in THE SEVEN SAMURAI
plays more important role in acquiring victory than actual
fighting itself. It is marvel to watch scenes in which
Kambei, like any other good general, surveys and sketches
the future battlefield and makes mental notes about best
ways to defeat the enemy. This dimension of THE SEVEN
SAMURAI is also missed from all latter remakes.</P>
<P>Kurosawa was very pedantic about scenes depicting the war,
but THE SEVEN SAMURAI could hardly be seen as militaristic
propaganda. Realism in battle scenes also means that the
death in war happens without any rules; characters often die
in agony or covered with mud or similar prosaic
circumstances. War equally brings out the best and worst
from people, the latter being symbolised in brutal acts of
violence and succumbing to animalistic desires, even among
the most innocent and idealistic characters like Katsushiro.
Wars, even when they are justified and when they end with
victory, are hardly something that should be celebrated.
Kurosawa underlines this message with bittersweet finale
scene.</P>
<P>With the sole exception Fumio Hayasaka's musical score that
sounds a little bit old- fashioned for today's standards,
THE SEVEN SAMURAI withstood the test of time. But this is
just one of many reasons why this film earned its rightful
place as the timeless gem of world cinema.</P>
