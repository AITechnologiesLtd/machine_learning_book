<P>(For your consideration -- the following review of "As Good As It Gets" that
I wrote for the Dec. 97-Jan. 98 issue of _Out & About North Florida_, a
publication of the Lesbian and Gay Community Association of Jacksonville. The
issue was printed on Dec. 19.)<HR></P>

<P>OK, guys, if you've had a crush on Greg Kinnear ever since his days as
host of "Talk Soup," you're in for a real treat this Christmas.</P>
<P>Kinnear plays gay artist Simon Bishop in the movie "As Good As It Gets,"
which opens Dec. 25 at theaters in Jacksonville and elsewhere.</P>
<P>Simon is a painter whose Manhattan apartment/studio is across the hall
from the apartment of Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson). Melvin is a self-
centered, opinionated, obsessive-compulsive author.</P>
<P>To describe Melvin's comments as "politically incorrect" is an
understatement. His thoughtless remarks have managed to alienate almost every
customer and employee of the neighborhood cafe he visits for breakfast each
morning.</P>
<P>Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) is the only waitress who's willing to
overlook Melvin's idiosyncrasies. Therefore, she becomes the stabilizing
figure in the neurotic Melvin's morning breakfast ritual.</P>
<P>Melvin's neighbors aren't sure of how to perceive him and, at first, the
audience may not be, either.</P>
<P>Often Nicholson uses facial expressions that seem like a throwback to
his portrayal of another author, Jack Torrance, in 1980's "The Shining." If
this movie hadn't been advertised as a comedy, audiences probably would expect
Melvin to start breaking down d oors with an ax.</P>
<P>Melvin uses non-PC dialogue when referring to Simon, but we soon learn
that he's not a homophobe. Melvin makes comments that are just as impolite to
a couple he perceives as Jewish who are sitting at his usual table in the
restaurant. But by then the audience knows that Melvin isn't a bigot, he's
just upset at encountering a change in his breakfast ritual.</P>
<P>The director, James L. Brooks, uses Melvin's obsessive-compulsive
disorder to bring in dialogue that studios would have been too nervous to
permit just a few years ago.</P>
<P>We may wince at many of the comments Melvin makes to Simon. And
socially conscious straights (and gays) may feel a twinge of guilt as they
chuckle at those lines. Yet it's clear that there's no hatred behind any of
Melvin's remarks.</P>
<P>Kinnear plays Simon with admirable restraint. Kinnear's mannerisms
border on excess flamboyance in the opening scene in which Simon welcomes home
his lost dog (the pooch Melvin sent down a garbage chute). But once Kinnear
settles into the role, Simon comes across as the average gay man (i.e., as
unobtrusive as any other man on the street).</P>
<P>Yes, Simon is one of filmdom's "gay guys even a Southern Baptist
could love." Like George Downes (Rupert Everett) in "My Best Friend's
Wedding," Simon helps a straight couple sort out their feelings for each
other. But unlike Kevin Kline in "In & Out," he doesn't get to kiss Tom
Selleck.</P>
<P>Now that Ellen Degeneres has shaken the taboo of being "out" on screen,
writers of romantic comedies have embraced the gay male character who can
serve as the lead female's confidant while not posing a threat to the male
lead.</P>
<P>Should we be upset that there isn't a romance for Simon in "As Good As It
Gets?" Well, the actor who would have been chosen for an on-screen kiss with
Kinnear has reason to be riled. But Kinnear's character is a groundbreaking
role in another area -- a gay man who could be spokesman for the "True Love
Waits" movement.</P>
<P>Vincent (Skeet Ulrich), the street hustler Simon invites in to model for
his next project, is certainly surprised that modeling is all Simon has in
mind.  And gays may think it is just *too convenient* that the script has made
Simon a single guy still waiting for the right man to come along.</P>
<P>But later in the movie, when Simon reminds Melvin of how fortunate any man
would be to meet the one other individual he wants to be with the majority of
time, we realize that Simon hasn't abandoned a goal many of us have discarded.</P>
<P>The publicity campaign for "As Good As It Gets" began three months ago,
possibly because Tri-Star Pictures realized a character with the disposition
of Melvin Udall might not make an ideal first impression with an audience.</P>
<P>When I first saw the preview and the scene that shows Melvin sending
Simon's dog down the garbage chute, I thought, "No way am I going to pay $6 to
see this." But my opinion of the movie began to change the more I saw the
preview.</P>
<P>There was a charm in the scene showing Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt in a
restaurant on Chesapeake Bay while "I Love You For Sentimental Reasons" plays
in the background. (Ironically, despite the allure of that scene in the
preview, the song isn't featured at that point in the actual movie. And the
preview itself contains a longer snippet of the song than is actually used in
the film.)</P>
<P>The only connection between the Christmas season and "As Good As It Gets"
is the movie's Dec. 25 release date. But this movie, with its themes of true
love and true friendship, is perfect for the holiday.<HR></P>
