                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Director: Mel Smith
Starring: Mary Stuart Masterson, Brian Benben, Ned Beatty,
          Scott Michael Campbell, Michael Lerner, Michael McKean,
          Jeffrey Tambor, Christopher Lloyd, Bobcat Goldthwait
Story by George Lucas, Executive Producer- George Lucas</P>
<P>     Another long awaited comeback from George Lucas is another dismal
disappointment.  This attempt to recapture the spirit of thirties B-film
mystery thrillers quickly crumbles into a series of unfunny jokes and
unwelcome cameos.  It is only for a few minutes near the very end that
any sense of plot is developed, and those few minutes are not enough to
erase the tedium of the hour and a half that preceded them.</P>
<P>    The film is set in 1939 on the opening day of a new radio network.
The old big studios used to like the Big Broadcast plot because it gave
them an excuse to parade their comic and musical talent.  Much of the
material the talent used was their own, so the cost of developing a
script was greatly reduced.  A flimsy plot could be structured around
the jokes and songs, and a B-film was halfway home.  A few art deco
sets, and a crowd pleaser was guaranteed.</P>
<P>    This film certainly assembles a lot of talent, but then quickly
fails to give them anything to do.  Harvey Korman is passed out under a
desk for most of the film.  Christopher Lloyd and Robert Klein don't
even have any lines.  Bobcat Goldthwait, much to the detriment of the
film does.  One hopes in vain that he will be the first victim in a
string of humorous station murders.  He is not.  His endless drone
serves to underscore the complete lack of humor in the comedy.  The
basic level of comedy in the film is having somebody run down the hall
with last minute script changes, only to be hit in the nose with a door
and drop the pages, get tripped and drop the pages again.  This pale
ghost of slapstick occurs repeatedly.</P>
<P>     The two leads, Masterson and Benben play a bickering husband and
wife who both work at the station.  Their lack of chemistry and comic
timing makes one long for Abbott and Costello in WHO DONE IT?, the
film this is clearly trying to be.  While there are stand-up comics
everywhere in the film, from the elevator operator to the torch
singer's husband; Masterson and Benben are not a comic team.  That is
what the film sorely needs.</P>
<P>    Even a great comic team, though would have had to struggle to wring
the laughs out of this script.  In the opening scene, station owner Ned
Beatty throws the radio show's script back at the writers and says that
it isn't funny.  Advice that the makers of this film could have taken to
heart as well</P>
<P>     If the backstage scenes fail, the onstage scenes work a little
better.  Spinal Tap's Michael McKean portrays a Spike Jones band leader
and manages to do for big band music what he has done before for rock
and roll.  George Burns and Rosemary Cluney, veterans of the original
radio show films, make brief appearances.  A few talented actors do soap
opera, science fiction, and thriller stories for the live audience.
Just when these stories get good, the films leaves them and returns to
the less amusing back stage antics.  Even the Andrews Sisters
impersonators are a relief from the ingratiating Bobcat Goldthwait.</P>
<P>     Set and costume design are the film's main plusses.  Just like the
recent SHADOW, this film recreates the look of the thirties very
successfully.  As with THE SHADOW, one is left puzzled why the film
makers bothered to try to recreate obscure thirties cultural relics
without making the films at least as interesting as the originals.It
seems in both cases, and DICK TRACY as well, the main concern was the
visual , and not the narrative element.</P>
<P>      Woody Allen's new film, BULLETS OVER BROADWAY is a much funnier
attempt at a backstage comedy set in the art deco period.  Allen's
RADIO DAYS also recaptures the era with more feeling and wit.  Three
classical era Hollywood films that are much better are THE BIG CLOCK
with Ray Milland and Charles Laughton, INTERNATIONAL HOUSE with Burns
and Allen, and WHO DONE IT? with Abbott and Costello.</P>
