<P>Brendan Fraser (GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE) continues his string of cartoon
characters by taking on the role of the world's most recognizable Canadian
Royal Mountie.  But he should have gone for the voice.  Seeing DUDLEY
DO-RIGHT without hearing the nasally pompous tones of Bill Scott (who also
did the voice of BULWINKLE) is like trying to listen to ALVIN AND THE
CHIPMUNKS' voices at regular speed.  It just isn't that funny.</P>
<P>With none the wit of Jay Ward's 1969 original animated source, the
filmmakers who bring us the live action DUDLEY DO-RIGHT resort to sight
gags and slapstick.  It sometimes works, it mostly doesn't.  This film's
Do-Right is more of a "doofus."</P>
<P>Dudley, we discover, grew up with the dream of being a Canadian Royal
Mountie.  His boyhood chum, Snidley Whiplash, had a different dream.  He
wanted to be a bad guy so he could have all the bad guy kind of fun.</P>
<P>Living in the Canadian town of Semi-Happy Valley, both Dudley and Snidely
attain their respective goals, opposing as they may be.  Caught in the
middle is the fair Nell Fenwick who must divide her affections betwixt
them.</P>
<P>After Whiplash drives off all the residents of Semi-Happy Valley, he
peppers the rocks and streams with gold buckshot in order to force a phony
"Gold Rush."  Since he now owns the entire town, the onrush of fortune
seekers is making him a fortune, turning him into a "respectable" business
man.  Why, he's even started to add color to his wardrobe.  Dudley, on the
other hand, is losing everything.  His job, his uniform, his horse...
With the spiritual help of Eric Idle (SPLITTING HEIRS), Dudley must learn
to do bad so he can get back to doing right.</P>
<P>The story is a disappointment to anyone who remembers the adult
intelligence and wit of Jay Ward's animated shows which combined with a
childlike innocence that made them very appealing to all ages.  However,
children will probably enjoy this new version with all its the pratfalls
and broad physical humor.  Preceding  the movie is a newly produced
animated FRACTURED FAIRY TALE that is reminiscent of Jay Ward's work.
Written by Bill Scott, it is clever enough for us to yearn for a higher
quality feature film to follow it.</P>
<P>Mr. Fraser has the gentle naiveté needed for the role but there's an
essential quality missing from his characterization and thus from the
movie.  The animated Dudley had a single-mindedness that bordered on the
absurd.  That element wasn't captured here which weakened the integrity of
the character.</P>
<P>Sarah Jessica Parker (MARS ATTACKS) isn't given much to do as Nell
Fenwick.  Hers is a romantic decision rather than a PERILS OF PAULINE
DILEMMA.  Alex Rocco (JUST WRITE) has some funny moments as the chief of a
native tribe of Indians (the Kumquat nation) who perform their cultural
dances (ALA RIVERDANCE) for the tourists.</P>
<P>Alfred Molina's (CELEBRITY) Snidely Whiplash does the memory of Hans
Conried, who originated the voice, proud.  Adopting a sniveling,
cartoon-evil voice and dressed in a black cape, stove pipe hat, and of
course, the trademark curled wax mustache, he looks and sounds like
Hercule Poirot's evil twin brother.  Mr. Molina is having great fun
playing the bad guy.</P>
<P>In fact, as Whiplash says, "Up until the end, being the bad guy is the
best job in the world."  In the end, of course, good triumphs and bad is
vanquished.  It's a bit of an unusual lesson to learn but we can see this
truth reflected all around us.  So often in life, it appears that bad men
prosper.</P>
<P>"Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase
in riches.  When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;  Until
I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end." Psalms
73:12, 16-17 [KJV]</P>
<P>Their end is not pretty.  Regardless of the appearances of prosperity
that evildoers may have attained in this world, they are left with
nothing.  In contrast, those that have lived righteous lives, believing
God to meet their needs and working heartily as unto the Lord, are
rewarded both in this lifetime and in the life that is to come.  Knowing
and believing this makes our decisions between good and evil that much
easier.</P>
