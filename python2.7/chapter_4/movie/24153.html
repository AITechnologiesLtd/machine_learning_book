<P>An 80-year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch, wearing
tight-fitting leather, as she cheers on her favorite TV wrestler by
calling his opponent a `pump-bitch'. Two men messily eat fast food as
their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them. And roughly 17
people are booted in the crotch. Welcome to `Ready to Rumble'. Judging
from the fact that potty-mouth Adam Sandler is the reigning box-office
comedy champion, you realize -- albeit while shaking your head -- that
yes, there is an audience for this sort of thing.</P>
<P>Ladies and gentlemen, I weep for society.</P>
<P>Mind you, when executed with style and comic ingenuity, jokes like an
alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel (`There's Something About
Mary') and a laxative-induced attack of explosive diarrhea (`Dumb and
Dumber') can be extremely funny. Unfortunately, `Ready to Rumble' is not
being helmed by the Farrelly brothers, nor is it bolstered by a script
that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or
inspired. `Ready to Rumble' is built around the dedicated fan-base of
professional wrestling.... which, in fact, sounded like a fine concept
for a goofball comedy.  But director Brian Robbins and screenwriter
Steven Brill handcuff themselves, and limited to a stampede of asinine,
humdrum bathroom humor, basically the only thing they manage is to evoke
memories of Pauly Shore and `Bio Dome'.</P>
<P>Gordie Boggs (David Arquette) and Sean Dawkins (Scott Caan) take pride
in being hardcore WCW wrestling fanatics. By day, they transport raw
sewage. By night (particularly on ‘Nitro' Monday), they pay homage to
their personal hero and savior - Jimmy King (Oliver Platt), the
undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community. With two
tickets to an upcoming Nitro performance, Gordie and Sean are psyched
about witnessing The King defend his title first-hand. But unscrupulous
boxing kingpin Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano, sporting long hair and
cowboy boots) has other plans. Sinclair is plotting to have Diamond
Dallas Page (playing himself) pummel The King into the tarp, thereby
dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a
bewildered auditorium full of fans. Gordie and Sean are shocked, rioting
madly while arguing `this isn't even a Pay-Per View event!!' They take
it upon themselves to track The King down and supply the encouragement
essential for their fallen idol to make a come-back attempt. Along the
way, you can expect a lot of sh-- jokes as well.</P>
<P>You may find something to like in `Ready to Rumble' if a) you are a
rasslin' aficionado yourself, or b) you are a dedicated fan of the
lowest of low-brow comedies. I welcome low-brow humor with open arms -
that is, if its fresh and resourceful. `Rumble' is nothing but a sloppy,
frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation. The first
half-hour is the ultimate test of patience. Luckily, the simple-minded
events pick up steam, particularly with the well-choreographed wrestling
action. Director Robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and
excitement of football in `Varsity Blues', and when in the ring, he does
professional work. But the violence is too excessive. Having the fake
soap opera of WCW wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back
unfortunate memories of Owen Hart's tragic accident just last year,
especially with one character's dive during a cage match. This is not
something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of. Outside the wrestling
action, the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the
term ‘scattershot', while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity
scale of 1 to 10, with Brill's extensive vocabulary ranging from
`diddly' to `boob' and so on. The final tally: I chuckled a few times,
groaned a lot, and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving Martin
Landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for
105.</P>
<P>Casting-wise, `Ready to Rumble' is an odd duck. Oliver Platt as a
champion wrestling figure? He's perhaps a bit chunky, but fellow
wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him `fatty', which
dampens the blow I suppose. Rose McGowan is fully disposable as a sultry
WCW cheerleader (`The Nirto-est of the Nitro girls,' proclaims Gordie),
but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers Goldberg, `Macho
Man' Randy Savage and Sting (among others). WCW fans are sure to
appreciate these. Others... well, won't. I found merit in David
Arquette's bountiful energy as Gordie, which brings me to my
finishing.... ahhh.... `praise' for the film: in `Ready to Rumble', I
have discovered something even more annoying than Arquette's `AT&T'
television commercials. Now there's a low blow for you.</P>
