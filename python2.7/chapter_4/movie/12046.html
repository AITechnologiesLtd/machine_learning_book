<PRE>TITANIC
*** of **** grade of B-</PRE>
<P>Titanic is a good film that was catipulted into becoming a great, best
picture winning film.  The film which cost 200+ million dollars came
along and blinded critics and audiences alike into being overcome with
gitty delight that a smart action film can be made.  It was great,
Titanic T-Shirts, posters, soundtracks, calenders, documentaries,
truth-telling interviews became the rage.  Divorce yourself from that as
you watch the movie and you may feel the uneven film that you have on
your hands.</P>
<P>This is an emotional epic of romance and love on a doomed ship. You know
that one character survived and you hope with all your heart that there
are two.  You might cry in Titanic.  You will watch many scenes with
your heart warming inside of you.  Meanwhile Jim (Egocentric of the
World) Cameron is spitting in your face with stupid characters made of
cardboard, lame dialogue that sits on screen begging for you to laugh it
down and moral righteousness.  You sit back and notice the great love
story of Jack and Rose and find it romantic escapism because Rose's
FIANCEE is such a jerk.  Why is he presented that way?</P>
<P>If he was presented as a nice but weak man the story would have had more
dimintion to it. Another key problem is Jack's character.  He is
presented as a character with no past or future, but instead a
rebellious object for her to fall in love with, his character is
cardboard. What do You learn about him? And he is the center piece of
the film.</P>
<P>The relationship is also not that well developed compared to better
films.  Look at this years BOOGIE NIGHTS or CHASING AMY and you will
notice that both have real emotions, not REEL ones.  It is more
refreshing to have a film that has character relationships mean
something.  The end scene of Titanic is a tear jerker but it could have
been more straining if the characters were aloud to be the people not
the cardboard statue of them.</P>
<P>All this may sound very negative but you will notice that I give the
film a positive review.  Some critics have called the Titanic screenplay
a horrible one.  I don't agree. The characters and dialogue is bad and
distracting in some scenes but the film is very touching and easy to
like , if not love.  Some scenes are so good that you feel as though you
would like to forgive the other bad moments to give the event the credit
it deserves.  I am giving the review a mild recomendation, for the three
that haven't seen it, and I am writing this not just as a review but a
registered argument against the film that shouldn't have even been
nominated for best picture.  By the way see LA CONFIDENTIAL instead. It
is more heart warming to see a great film than a good one!</P>
