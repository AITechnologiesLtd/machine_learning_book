                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1996 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Love, Honor and Obey: The Last Mafia Marriage (TV-1993) ** - C:Eric Roberts,
Nancy McKeon, Ben Gazarra, Alex Rocco.</P>
<P>The head of a 50s mafia family (Gazarra) decides that he doesn't want his
organization involved with narcotics, which angers the heads of the five
families. As a result, a bloody mafia war breaks out. Say, does this sound
familiar? Oh yeah, it was called THE GODFATHER!!! Come on!! If you're going
to blatently rip-off a mob film, try to steal from one that no one has seen!
Gee whiz.</P>
<P>The filmmakers try to hide their stolen ideas in many ways. One way is that
we're told that this was based on a true story. That may be so, but still,
The Godfather did it first. Also, the main plot of the film is nothing but
arguments and fights between Gazarra's son (Roberts) and his new bride
(McKeon). They argue and cry and fight and make-up for the entire three
hours of this TV miniseries which spans the course of several decades. They
have all of the usual marital problems: not able to have children, not able
to pay the bills, men with shotguns hanging out in the family room, etc. Oh,
and the fact that Roberts is a mobster causes problems, but it seems to take
McKeon five years to figure that part out.</P>
<P>Love, Honor and Obey is standard TV fare with nothing special going for it
in terms of story, direction or acting. You would think that a rip off of a
great movie could at least just duplicate "The Godfather" as far as interest
goes, but no such luck.</P>
