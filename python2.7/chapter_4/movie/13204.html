<PRE>OUT OF SIGHT (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Steven Soderbergh
Writer: Scott Frank (based on the novel by Elmore Leonard)
Starring: George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, Ving Rhames, Don Cheadle, Steve
Zahn, Albert Brooks, Dennis Farina, Catherine Keener, Isaiah Washington,
Luis Guzmán, Nancy Allen, Donna Frenzel, Keith Loneker, Michael Keaton,
Samuel L. Jackson</P>
<P>There are two reasons why I just love to read and/or watch Elmore Leonard
novels/adaptations: a) they're so unpredictable, and b) they have quite
frankly the most interesting characters than anything that comes out today.
 The world of Elmore Leonard is filled with interesting characters of
varying intelligence, who all at some point get to step into the foreground
and mouth off to the audience.  The plots are piloted only by them, and we
read/watch with intensity, trying to follow the plethora of characters as
they twist and turn the plot, never leaving us behind and never allowing us
to predict what will happen next.</P>
<P>This is something that Hollywood isn't usually able to handle, but for some
reason, the past three Leonard adaptations - "Get Shorty," "Jackie Brown,"
and this - are incredibly faithful not just to the plotting of the
respective novels, but to their overall feel.  In the past, reading and
watching Leonard adaptations were totally different, but now, it's like
Hollywood has had an epiphany: they've taken the time to read his novels,
understand what makes them so compelling, and hire the right directors to
create them in celluloid form.</P>
<P>If I had never seen "Get Shorty" or "Jackie Brown," I would have proclaimed
"Out of Sight" the best and most fascinating Leonard adaptation.  It fully
understands the way that Leonard feels, allows each character to glow
radiantly, develops some real depth to the film to connect to the audience,
and even has an emotional core.  It even has completely amazing
performances, and turns its two leads, who have both had a bit of trouble
connecting to audiences in the past, into great Hollywood stars in the
tradition of Bogart and Bacall or Tracy and Hepburn (or even Allen and
Keaton).  Is it substantially weaker than the other two films?  No way;
it's right up there with them.</P>
<P>The protagonists of "Out of Sight" are one bank robber and one Federal
Marshall.  Jack Foley (George Clooney, growing his old hair back and
ditching the old school-Doug Ross stuff...not that that was a bad thing) is
the crook who, in the first unrelated-to-everything-else scene robs a bank
in the most laid back (not to mention most hilarious since Woody Allen
tried to rob a bank in "Take the Money and Run") robbery scene in history
by merely telling the teller that a man sitting at a desk with her boss is
his partner.  Unfortunately, his car stalls and he winds up in prison.</P>
<P>Shortly thereafter, the escapes with a little snitching and help from his
friend and assistant, Buddy Bragg (Ving Rhames, still glowing).  But in the
process, he manages to kidnap a tough Federal Marshall dressed in a Chanel
dress, Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez), the other main protagonist.  He stuffs
himself in the trunk with her, and on the way to a rendezvous, chats up
with her about, of all things, the career of Faye Dunaway, discussing
"Bonnie and Clyde," "Network," and "Three Days of the Condor."  He lets her
go and all, but the two both have an attraction and obsession with one
another.</P>
<P>The obsession grows as Jack and Buddy team up with a vicious criminal he
knew from prison, Maurice "Snoopy" Miller (Don Cheadle, showing off his
versatility as an actor once again), to do a job on a sleazy billionaire
they also knew from prison, Richard Ripley (a balding Albert Brooks - so
that WAS a toupee!), who squealed that he had a collection of uncut
diamonds somewhere in his mansion.  Meanwhile, the FBI is trying to track
Jack down with the help of Karen, who can't decide if she wants to catch
him because he's a crook or because she's totally attracted to him.</P>
<P>The film was directed by Steven Soderbergh, who hit the big time back about
a decade ago with the film that launched the craze for independent films,
"sex, lies, and videotape," but has had a rough time making movies since. 
Instead of playing it for laughs like Barry Sonnenfeld did with "Get
Shorty," or playing it straight like Quentin Tarantino did with "Jackie
Brown," Soderbergh directs it with a masterful touch of emotional and
psychological depth.  He freezes frames at key moments, intercuts two
scenes to form one, and uses the humor as a break from the intensity of the
rest of the film.  The screenplay by Scott Frank (of "Dead Again" fame) is
as complex as Soderbergh's direction: he forms the plot so that the film
plays in often non-linear form, throwing in unanounced flashbacks so that
much of the film plays as a series of memories and thoughts of respective
characters.  This is done so much that when one scene which is shot in a
dream-like state arrives, I wasn't sure if it was real or not.</P>
<P>This is easily the most deep of the Leonard adaptations because while "Get
Shorty" was a satire on Hollywood and "Jackie Brown" was just a
psychological caper film, "Out of Sight" actually connects to the audience.
 The two protagonists are easily likable, and their obsession with one
another is the driving force of the film.  We care about these two, and we
see that their relationship is really a tragedy: they're torn between their
love for one another and the boundaries of what they are.  In effect, the
film actually says more about the relationship between cops and robbers
than "Heat" did, and just as an added cherry, the scene where the two
characters take a break and sit down for a drink, which was the most
hyped-up (not to mention the most anticlimactic) scene of the film, is
twenty times better.</P>
<P>The film's basically a battle between what people do for a living and what
they really could be, a battle between a romance film and a pulpy thriller.
 We have a joyously fun caper film here with all the right ingredients
(double crosses upon double crosses, trigger-happy characters, rich
asswholes getting their just deserts, and even some irony), but we also
have a wonderful love story, easily the best of the Leonard adaptions (the
ones in "Get Shorty" and "Jackie Brown" were more sweet than this is), and
acted with just the right amount of sexual chemistry by Clooney and Lopez. 
These two characters have only three or four scenes together, but when they
talk, you just hold your breath in case something amazing happens.  And it
does.</P>
<P>And of course, there are those little things that you have to love about
this film, like the two big shock cameos that pop up (one a tie-in with
"Jackie Brown"), that gory death towards the end which is the funniest one
of those since the head shot in "Pulp Fiction," the opening bank robbery
scene, the opening of the safe in Brooks' house, and two hilarious
supporting roles by Tom DiCillo's wife, Catherine Keener, and Steve Zahn as
a stoner "colleague" of Jack's, who shows to mainstream audiences the knack
for comedy he has shown in other smaller films.  There's nary a dull moment
or character in an Elmore Leonard novel, and it's amazing that a film based
on one of his novels has realized how to appropriately connect two
characters emotionally with their audience.</P>
