<PRE>**Breakdown**
Reviewed by Jeff Walters</PRE>
<P>        This little movie seemed to sneak up on me out of nowhere. And
when a movie with a cast like this 'sneaks' up on you - it usually
means that no-one is talking about it for a reason....that is - it
sucks! But not this movie. I'm sill trying to work out why this movie
received little press. Because it's a terrific film. In a year when
most movies have tried to thrill the audience with whizz bang effects
and progressively bigger and bigger explosions, this film
manages to out thrill them all through a chilling story and the
occassional terrific stunt.</P>
<P>           I knew from the clever opening sequence where seemingly
random spinning lines eventually form into a map of where the movie is
set, that I was going to like this flick. Very nicely done.</P>
<P>          Kurt Russell is perfectly cast as the frantic husband
willing to do anything to find his wife. What makes his character even
better is that he is very realistic. He makes mistakes, is often
outsmarted and does not jump to a fight, but rather is intimidated by
violence......at the start of the movie anyway.</P>
<P>       The villian's shoes are filled by a man who seems to be in
almost every single movie and tv show - the late great J.T. Walsh. .
He leads the small group of kidnappers and does a sterling job. The
rest of the kidnappers also preform well. In particular, Jack
Noseworthy, who was also in Event Horizon.</P>
<P>          I did have a few minor complaints with the film, where there
were a couple of huge coincidences. For instance when the wrapper of a
donut his wife had been eating just *happens* to float past whilst he
is drifting in a river. I don't think so. But as I said, the errors
are minor and should really be overlooked due to
the fact that the rest of the movie is scripted so well.</P>
<P>        Unlike many movies this year which have looked promising but
failed to deliver in the final 30 minutes, it is during this time
that Breakdown really shines. And it is also during this time that
you'll see the best stunts. The scene where the truck is tettering on
the edge of the bridge is one I'll not soon forget.</P>
