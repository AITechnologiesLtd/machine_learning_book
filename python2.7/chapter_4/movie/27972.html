<PRE>"The Caveman's Valentine"</PRE>
<P>Romulus Ledbetter was a Julliard-trained classical musician and a devoted
family man who lost his mind. He now lives in a cave on the edge of
Manhattan and is haunted by a delusional enemy, Cornelius Gould Stuyvesant,
who manipulates Rom's life from atop the Chrysler building. But, when
Ledbetter finds a frozen corpse outside his home, he must put aside his
dementia and solve the murder in "The Caveman's Valentine."</P>
<P>Kasi Lemmons, an accomplished actress and screenwriter, made quite a splash
with her debut-directing job, "Eve's Bayou," which was the highest grossing
independent film of 1997. With "The Caveman's Valentine," she uses George
Dawes Green's adaptation of his own novel to unfold a murder mystery with
Romulus as a very unlikely homicide detective.</P>
<P>The murder story enveloping Romulus involves a handsome young drifter,
Scotty Gates (Sean MacMahon), found dead atop a tree outside of the old
schizophrenic's cave. When the police, including Rom's cop daughter Lulu
(Aunjanue Ellis), dismiss the transient's death, the former music master
must piece the clues together alone. He becomes convinced that a prominent
Manhattan art photographer, David Leppenraub (Colm Feore), is the murderer.
But, who is going to believe the ranting of a crazy man living in a cave?</P>
<P>The brightest point of "The Caveman's Valentine" is the terrific character
depiction of Romulus Ledbetter by Samuel L. Jackson. In his last three
outings he has played a bad ass private dick in "Shaft," a physically
handicapped mass murderer in search of a hero in "Unbreakable," and, in
"The Caveman's Valentine" a mentally broken artiste who must put aside his
dementia to solve a murder. The actor puts a completely different spin on
each of his characters and Romulus Ledbetter is no exception. Topped with a
head full of dreadlocks and attired in layers of dirty clothing, Ledbetter
is a raving, hallucinating nutcase who is brought back to the sane world,
at least for a little while, to solve the murder placed on his doorstep.
Jackson, as usual, creates a real, three-dimensional person in Romulus.</P>
<P>After Jackson, though, things get a bit sparse as the rest of the cast has
to play off the master actor. This is a fault of the story, not the actors,
as the characters are universally overshadowed by the star. False leads and
fake outs make up the bulk of the tale as Romulus must strip away the lies
and misleading information to finally solve the crime. I don't want to give
the story away, but too much slight of hand is used to lead the viewer down
false paths in the investigation. Colm Feore does put a slick arrogance
into his perf as David Leppenraub and Ann Magnuson, as David's sister and
Rom's love interest, comes across as a really nice lady. Anthony Michael
Hall has a bit of fun as a yuppie lawyer who, through circumstance, becomes
Rom's patron. The rest are there to support Jackson.</P>
<P>Romulus's mental state and delusions are reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's
"The Fisher King," especially his ranting against the invisible Stuyvesant.
One ongoing hallucination is particularly effective as Ledbetter's ex-wife
Sheila (Tamara Tunie), in her younger form, keeps appearing before him as
his muse, dispensing advice and criticism as necessary. The focus upon
Romulus and his mental illness affords Jackson the opportunity to delve
into the character, giving us a terrific study by the actor.</P>
<P>Kasi Lemmons has a tough job topping her debut feature and, without the
incredible talent of Samuel L. Jackson, would not have come close. With
Jackson in the saddle as Romulus Ledbetter, she has the chance, at least,
to successfully get past the sophomore slump. I give "The Caveman's
Valentine" a C+.</P>
