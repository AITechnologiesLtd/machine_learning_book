VELVET GOLDMINE     1998
Reviewed by Pierce Dalton
2 1/2 stars (out of 4)</PRE>
<P> Velvet Goldmine works in two ways.  You can see it as either a tribute to glam
rock, or as satire.</P>
<P> I saw it as both.  But, the results aren't that satisfactory.</P>
<P> Set in flashbacks in the `70s, the film follows the life of legendary rocker
Brian Slade, who had himself "assassinated" as to get out of the business. 
When his fans find out it was a set-up, they go beserk and trash him.</P>
<P> Told through the eyes, and memory of persons associated with Slade, of a
British reporter (Christian Bale), Velvet Goldmine reminded me of Boogie Nights
(1997).  They both feature fame, drugs, sex, careers that go down hill, and
lost love.  </P>
<P> Not as good as Nights, Goldmine is a nice try at bringing back the memory of
glam rock.</P>
<P> But, it just doesn't do the era justice.</P>
