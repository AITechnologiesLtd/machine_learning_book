One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
* * * * out of * * * *
Rated R for language, violence, sexual content, and brief nudity.</PRE>
<P>First thing's first, while I watched this movie, I found myself stunned. This
movie so entertained the viewer, as it did fascinate, and inform. A chilling,
disturbing, and revealing look into the mental institutions as seen through the
eyes of a con. Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, and
Christopher Lloyd, round out the excellent, and very well casted cast.
Jack Nicholson brilliantly plays Randall Patrick McMurphy, an ex-con, who fakes
being mentally insane, to enter the institution. As he goes to the hospital, he
doesn't realize, that the people, and the atmosphere there is so out there. The
patients are really psycho, and creepy. Randall, must try and survive these
days, before he has to go to Jail. He has to entertain himself while at the
same time, find good in this place of craziness.
Lousie Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched, a soft; but strong willed nurse, who will
not take anything from anyone, or put up with misbehavior. She watches Randall,
and notices something different about him, hes not as psycho as the others, but
he is a little out there. Her job is touch indeed, having to put up with all
these men, who dont listen, some go crazy and throw fits, and others just sit
there and dont do anything.
Randall meets many new friends in this place, Brad Dourif who plays Billy
Bibbit, is a mentally unstable, but voluntarily institutionalized person. Danny
DeVito plays Martini, a slow but charming and sweet man, who means know harm in
what he does or say. Christopher Lloyd plays Taber, a man, who also voluntarily
institutionalized himself. He also meets Chief, a big 'dumb, and deaf' Indian,
who happens to like to play basketball.
Randall must try and survive these days with his new friends, and the hospital,
as well as an everlasting war as to which they can watch the world series on
TV. Put up with Nurse Ratched, and the other patients, doctors, vistors, and
nurses. Ultimately leading up to a dramatic finale, that makes you want to
stand up and cheer.
I think what was best about this film was the realism. I had no problem
believing that this was happening. Almost like a documentary, it was striking
and powerful, making the viewer not want to stop watching till the end. Some of
the sequences are memorable as the basketball game, and the fishing trip. Jack
Nicholson, who as always plays his character absolutely excellent, and makes
the viewer want hand him an Oscar himself. 
The supporting cast, Louise Fletcher, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad
Dourif also give terrific performances. Danny, Christopher, and Brad's careers
all were made with this superb movie. It's all sentimental, funny, dramatic,
intense, chilling, disturbing, diverting, and tragic. The finale leaves the
viewer stunned and sitting there thinking about what he just saw. See this
film, and believe it. I think you will find, its one of the BEST ever. 
The second film to win all five major Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor
(Nicholson), Best Actress (Fletcher), Director, and Screenplay. And it deserved
all of them.</P>
