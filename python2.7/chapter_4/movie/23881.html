<PRE>HUMANITY (L'Humanite)</PRE>
<PRE> Reviewed by Harvey Karten

 Director: Bruno Dumont
 Writer:  Bruno Dumont
 Cast: Emmanuel Schotte, Severine Caneele, Philipe Tullier,
Ghislain Ghesquere, Ginette Allegre</PRE>
<P>   "Humanity" ("L'Humanite") is a film not so difficult to
classify as it is simply to sit through.  Almost diametrically the
opposite of a standard Hollywood creation, "Humanity" puts
little emphasis on plot, even less on what we usually think of
as beauty, virtually none on music or cinematography or slick,
professional acting, and even less on anything resembling
clever turns-of-phrases and the like.  Bruno Dumont filmed
his scenes almost wholly in the small working class, Northern
French town of Bailleul--not far from Lille--the stylization =</P>
<P>restricted almost wholly to unusual close-ups of parts of
people's bodies.  While Dumont paces his story at about the
same pace as his countryman, Eric Rohmer, his dialogue is
as unlike Rohmer's as it is from Jerry Bruckheimer's.  =</P>
<P>   So...what's it all about, Alfie?  "Humanity" is about nothing
less than life and death, sex and violence, pity and tragedy;
in short, about what makes us living human beings.  Dumont
is obviously inspired by the late, great Robert Bresson who
expressed himself on film "as a poet would with his pen"
(according to Jean Cocteau).  Like Bresson he is a
philosopher with a camera whose films ("The Life of Jesus"
for example) contain only the bare essentials that he wants to
explore, and he explores this limited material with a rigorous
attention to detail.  Even in his display of a series of paintings
in the current film, he mimes Bresson in avoiding beautiful
images in favor of "necessary" ones, and like Bresson he has
no use for skilled, professional actors.</P>
<P>   In this long movie that plods ahead like molasses crawling
up a tree in January, and with a storyline used as an excuse
for some statements about life, Dumont spreads before us a
few days in the life of a small-town police officer, Pharaon De
Winter (Emmanuel Schotte), who has a burning, unrequited
lust for a neighbor, Domino (Severine Caneele).  Pharaon
once had a woman friend and a baby who both died two
years earlier and he tags along as a fifth wheel to Domino
and her insensitive, bus-driver boy friend, Joseph (Philippe
Tullier).  Reacting with horror to the rape-murder of an
eleven-year-old girl, Pharaon is so sensitive, so unlike
Joseph, that he agonizes with unfiltered emotions to the
heinous crime.  So visceral is his torment that in the dramatic
opening scene, he is caught in close-up by Dumont's
photographer, Yves Cape, running along the countryside,
huffing and puffing, until he collapses to the ground, hugging
the muddy earth as though he were embracing the core of life
itself.  =</P>
<P>   If Pharaon is the essence of sensitivity and Joseph the
extract of indifference, Domino is the elixir of earthiness.  The
large-boned, amateur actress, Severine Caneele, comes
across looking faintly transsexual, an earth-mother who gives
in boldly and joyously to her sexual urges.  Cape's camera
hones in as graphically as any in recent years on sexual acts
engaged in by Joseph and Domino, showing Domino as a
woman who is barely concerned when she is accidentally
observed by Pharaon--who has dull-wittedly swung her door
open and stands unblinkingly witnessing her performance.  In
one unforgettable image, the camera closes in on her entire
pelvic area, displayed as an adult copy of the same bodily
segment shown in closeup of the little dead girl lying in the
field.</P>
<P>   What rivets us to the screen throughout the extended
running time is director Dumont's singular emphasis on life's
details, which we observe through Pharaon's eyes.  The big,
bull neck of the hardworking but barely competent police
chief (Ghislain Ghesquere) receives the same attention as a
gigantic hog lying in the barn being suckled by a litter of her
piglets.  Pharaon, used by the director to represent life's
humanity, compensates for his dullness of mind by his
unusual sensitivity.  When an Algerian drug pusher is brought
in by the police chief for questioning and left alone in the
room with De Winter, Pharaon more than compensates for
his intellectual numbness and unblinking expression by his
tactile genius.  He puts his hand around the prisoner's neck
and smells him as would a dog, indicating his empathy with
the accused and at the same time representing to us that
compassion and kindness lie not in our verbal acumen or
quickness of mental alertness but in our more basic, physical
mammalian faculties.</P>
<P>   What Dumont has succeeded in giving us--or those of us
who have the discernment, patience and sitzfleisch to settle
in for a look at this director's universe Bressonian universe--is
a gaze at the essence of humanity, which reaches us
because he does not distract us with anything resembling a
Hollywood form.  Dumont's picture takes place in a
commonplace, vapid town with everyday, insipid people. =</P>
<P>Because of Dumont's minimalism, we are all the more able to
perceive the complex passions, jealousies, and struggles to
understand what for good and evil makes us all human.  This
picture, which has divided its audience from the first showing,
was the surprise runner-up for top ribbon at the Cannes Film
Festival, its two principal theps taking home the top prize for
their performances.</P>
<P>Not Rated.  Running time: 148 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
