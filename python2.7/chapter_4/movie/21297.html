<P>Best known for his study of the New York anti-Stalinist intellectuals
grouped around the 1930s Partisan Review, University of Michigan
professor and Solidarity activist Alan Wald has been writing about the
intersection of art and politics for over two decades. He spoke last
week at the Brecht Forum on the film and literary noir genre. The talk
was based on a chapter from his forthcoming book on popular culture
and concentrated on the career of long-time CP member and writer
Kenneth Fearing, who died in 1961, and whose novel "The Big Clock" and
the film based on it are classic noir. I will highlight points that
Alan made and then make some of my own on "The Big Clock," which I
viewed the following day.</P>
<P>Fearing was part of the left wing constellation of writers grouped
around the John Reed Clubs in the 1920s, many of whom identified with
or joined the CPUSA. He was one of the first to break with early
cultural traditions of the left, which owed much to literary
romanticism. To illustrate this point, Alan described an encounter
between Fearing and Floyd Dell, another left-wing poet, at a party in
1927. As was the custom of the time, Dell invited Fearing to recite
some verse, to which he would then respond with his own recitation.
Fearing, a heavy drinker in the Dashiell Hammett mold, spat out "Oh
Shit" to Dell and walked into the kitchen to prepare another cocktail.
That was Fearing's way of telling Dell that the troubadour style was
passé.</P>
<P>Defining the noir style has been a preoccupation of many leftwing
cultural historians. This is not surprising since noir not only
reflects the hard-boiled depression-era sensibility but the sense of
disillusionment that followed it during the post-WWII period. While
much of noir art was produced by left-wingers, it very rarely captured
the sense of optimism and group solidarity that defined the Popular
Front cultural ethos. While many of the CP'ers who wrote noir
screenplays obviously believed that Ben Shahn and Mike Gold were doing
the right thing, they either were prevented from producing such work
in Hollywood or--more interestingly--consciously chose to depict shady
and economically marginal characters cut off from society instead. So
defining the link between such works as "Blue Gardenia", "Force of
Evil" and "The Big Clock"--all written by CP'ers--and the politics of
their creators becomes a real challenge, which Alan rose to in his
lecture.</P>
<P>The first question he spoke to was the role of women in such films and
novels, where the sexist "femme fatale" character practically defines
the genre. While accepting this as a liability that marks much of the
noir genre, Wald pointed to another aspect which he called "feminist
femme fatale". The most important example of this is found in Vera
Caspari's "Laura". Caspari was a CP'er who moved away from the party
after the Hitler-Stalin pact. "Laura" consumed much of her energies in
this period, which she felt was a necessary escape valve from the
intense feelings of disillusionment the pact brought on. The movie,
best known now for its haunting title melody, depicts a strong-willed
woman trying to carve out an identity for herself. After she is
murdered, a working class detective tracks down the perpetrator in a
decadent and morally-corrupt group of upper-class society types.</P>
<P>Wald also considers Afro-Marxists a much more important contributor to
the genre than is ordinarily given credit for. Since these works
usually do not include major black characters, except for what is
acknowledged as the swan song of the genre--"Odds Against
Tomorrow"--this might seem open to debate. Wald cites the fiction of
Chester Himes and Willard Motley as classic examples. Interestingly,
Motley only wrote about white ethnics in his novels, such as "Knock on
Any Door", but it is widely understood that such characters were
stand-ins for black Americans. Wald also includes Richard Wright's
"Native Son", which inspired a fairly awful movie noteworthy only for
its inclusion of the author in the lead role.</P>
<P>Another important building-block in the noir edifice is supplied by
"Tough Jews." Wald reminded the audience that many of the Communists
who wrote noir fiction and screenplays were Jews from Brooklyn and the
Lower East Side of Manhattan who were accustomed to seeing Jewish
boxers and gangsters in the 1920s. In this era, not only were the
greatest boxers Jewish but organized crime was led by Jews as well,
including the hit-men of Murder Incorporated. Often left-wing
screenwriters such as Abraham Polonsky and actors like John Garfield
belonged to gangs as youngsters or even had criminal records. This
accounts for the hard-boiled quality of much of their work and
performances.</P>
<P>Turning to "The Big Clock", Wald suggests that the key to
understanding such work is that it actually predates the Popular Front
esthetic and owes much to the urban naturalism that was taking shape
during the turn-of-the-century. It would hearken back to earlier
traditions such as the fiction of Theodore Dreiser. The culture clash
between Fearing and Popular Front commissars sometimes could not be
repressed. John Henry Lawson denounced the "The Big Clock" as trash
and probably regarded its creator Kenneth Fearing as less than
stalwart Communist material. Fearing, like Hammett, was a life-long
drunk who had a string of broken marriages and relationships in tow.</P>

<P>So with these remarks serving as a backdrop, I sat down to watch the
1948 "The Big Clock" with great eagerness. Here are some observations.</P>
<P>Like most noir films, much of "The Big Clock" is rather musty. In most
cases, this is unobjectionable, especially for those of us who
appreciate the charm of vintage films. What does not sit well is the
character of Earl Janoth, who is a moustache-twirling villain with
obvious homosexual mannerisms. Played by Charles Laughton (in real
life, a left-winger), the overweight homosexual was frequently used as
a stock figure in the noir body of work. Sidney Greenstreet in
"Maltese Falcon" is another prime example. </P>
<P>Janoth is in sharp contrast to the hero George Stroud, played by Ray
Milland, a well-built, square-jawed muscular man with a wife and young
son. The conflict between Janoth and Stroud unfolds as the former, a
Hearst-like boss of a media empire, directs Stroud to forgo a vacation
in order to make himself available for a circulation drive. Since
Stroud, a character anticipating the figures depicted in Juliet
Schor's "The Overworked American", has not had a vacation in many
years, he decides to quit rather than oblige Janoth.</P>
<P>After turning in his resignation, Stroud is joined at the bar where he
is celebrating by Janoth's mistress, a femme fatale who both despises
but is financially dependent on the magnate in true Dreiserian
fashion. That evening Janoth kills her in a fit of rage at her
apartment, where Stroud himself made an earlier but innocent
appearance. The remainder of the film depicts Janoth's attempts to
frame Stroud.</P>
<P>As the police and Janoth's henchmen close in on Stroud in corporate
headquarters, the image of the Big Clock dominates the scenes. This is
the largest and most sophisticated clock ever built which Janoth
insists on being 100 percent accurate, since it is a symbol of his
power. Located in the lobby of the building, it is the high spot of
tours. When Stroud seeks refuge inside the housing that encloses the
clock's inner mechanism, he accidentally bumps against a lever that
shuts it down. Up in his penthouse office, Janoth recoils from the
sight of a satellite clock whose hands has stopped. Somebody go find
out what's wrong with the clock, he barks.</P>
<P>This reminded me of Fritz Lang's 1920s "Metropolis" which very likely
inspired the vision of corporate control in "The Big Clock"
"Metropolis'' employed vast sets, 25,000 extras and astonishing
special effects to create two worlds: the great city of Metropolis,
with its stadiums, skyscrapers and expressways in the sky, and the
subterranean workers' city, where the clock face shows 10 hours to
cram another day into the workweek. The city is powered by an
underground plant, where workers strain to move heavy dial hands back
and forth. What they're doing makes no logical sense, but visually the
connection is obvious: They are controlled like hands on a clock.</P>
<P>Close to two other left-wing émigrés Bertolt Brecht and Hanns Eisler,
Lang eventually moved to Hollywood where his German expressionist
esthetics helped to influence film noir, often perceived--incorrectly
in my opinion--as a specifically American phenomenon. Although Lang
adapted to the Hollywood prejudices against overtly political films
with messages, he never was happy with these constrictions.</P>
