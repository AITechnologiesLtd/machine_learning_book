<PRE>                                   NAKED LUNCH
                       A film review by Joe Van de Zande
                        Copyright 1992 Joe Van de Zande</PRE>
<P>     Well now.  What do you say to sheet lightning dropping from a baby
sky?  Not much.  Even the German shepherd cross I bear has enough sense
to dive for shelter, then peek out at the fireworks.  Lashing and
thrashing.  This is an ugly movie that walks like it talks.</P>
<P>     Details?  Forget it!  Okay, one.  The movie is *not* based on the
novel, not really, though there are two readings and one character from
it.  (Readers of the long gone and sorely missed B&H annals may
recognize Dr. Benway.)   Instead, it's a fantasy about Big Bill himself
in Morocco during the period NAKED LUNCH was written.  Very loosely
based on the recent biography, perhaps.</P>
<P>     Curious about the novel?  It's on my credenza, heavily dog-eared.
Just open it anywhere and read a couple of pages at random; it's one of
those.  Like Delaney's DHALGREN, right?  And would you like to meet the
real Burroughs?  Well you could run him to ground in Lawrence, Kansas,
last I heard, or you  could check out the defrocked priest toward the
end of DRUGSTORE COWBOY.  That's your man.</P>
<P>     Funny?  Umm ... do you laugh when Joan is shooting bug powder into
her breast and describes the sensation as "Kafkaesque"?  Some did,
others blanched.  A matter of taste.  Genri; Uncle Duke in a nasty mood.
Ever read Ciline?  Heh.  Try to him at the River Oaks Waldenbooks.
"Sure.  Behind the Hallmark cards".  One thing: I know it would have
ruined the atmosphere of decay and  corruption, but if I were the
director I'd've been tempted to slip Woody Allen in as ten second cameo
hallucination of the Ginsberg character.  </P>
<P>     This is an atmosphere movie, not one for a big screen.  You can't
go  wrong if you see it in Chicago; I believe it is only playing at the
Esquire on Oak, and the Broadway.  (Yes, silly, on Broadway.  Near
Belmont).  I went to the latter.  Packed.  Get your ticket early then
watch basketball for a while at Reflections two doors south.  (Did you
see DA BULLS work out on Utah?  Mercy.)</P>
