<P>Despite being a visual marvel and cinematic triumph, Snow Falling on 
Cedars is ultimately a failure in terms of living up to its potential 
and expectations. That Universal is marketing this film for Best Picture 
is an insult to the Academy's intellect. The production does have 
moments of glory, namely riveting courtroom scenes and the 
aforementioned cinematography.</P>
<P>It is December, 1950 in the state of Washington and prejudice runs thick 
among locals. One morning an American body is found murdered at sea. The 
man soon standing trial is Japanese. To Kill A Mock85oops, sorry, I =
mean Snow Falling on Cedars focuses on the obvious racism involved. As 
someone points out of the trial "Every once in a while, somewhere in the 
world, humanity goes on trial."</P>
<P>The film is based on David Guterson's novel of the same title. Humor 
aside, there is a strong argument that this work is little more than a 
poorly disguised adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird. The only major 
difference is that in To Kill a Mockingbird the stories and characters 
outside of the trial are well developed and intriguing. Here they are 
like a random collage. In that sense, Snow Falling on Cedars is more 
like Mike Figgis' awful film The Loss of Sexual Innocence where footage 
of unrelated stories was shot and randomly assembled on an editing 
table.</P>
<P>The court scenes are truly excellent and even solicit memories of 
classics like Inherit the Wind. Max Von Sydow plays Nels Gudmundson, the 
defense lawyer. Like the brilliant Dustin Hoffman in Sleepers, he is 
shaky and visually unintimidating. But when his character goes after 
witnesses it is truly a classic courtroom drama. Von Sydow should be 
applauded and may even see his name as a long shot Best Supporting Actor 
nomination. Equally magnificent is James Cromwell as the presiding 
judge, determined to have a trial without prejudice.</P>
<P>Snow Falling on Cedars is a genuinely attractive film. The 
title-descriptive winter scenery could easily comprise a calendar (a 
rarity for any image absent a semi-nude woman in the 90's.) 
Interestingly, the camera is almost always either focussed on a 
person's face or a large, rich scene. There are very few half-way 
shots. These facial portraits are further enhanced by being only half 
lit, yin-yang style. Unfortunately even this engaging technique sheds 
light on a flaw: everyone's makeup is perfect. When people sweat, cry 
or are just themselves, their faces are a little too beautiful to be 
believed.</P>
<P>The court scenes are particularly effective because the script creates a 
genuine hatred towards certain prejudice characters. Not since Jack 
Nicholson's riveting performance in A Few Good Men has a film been so 
effective at creating such feelings towards a witness. Just as facial 
portraits reveal unrealistic makeup, dE9j=E0 vu of that 1991 production =
is a too strong to be ignored. The pinnacle of this is when a witness is 
questioned about their phone calls in the same manner that Tom Cruise 
bombarded Nicholson some eight years ago.</P>
<P>It is most unfortunate that courtroom drama, excellent acting and visual 
ecstasy like this must be ruined by murky plot lines and poor 
adaptation. Ironically, yin-yang is more than just some characters' 
portraits, it is an underlying theme of Snow Falling on Cedars.</P>
