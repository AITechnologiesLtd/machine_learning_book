<P>ETERNITY AND A DAY (MIA EONIOTITA KE MIA MERA)</P>

<P>   Not too many great directors are sitll working in the
cinema.  Lovers of good film would doubtless know men like
Godard, Bertolucci (whose latest "Besieged" takes him into
personal waters he had not previously charted), of course
Martin Scorcese, and maybe Zhang Yimou.  But few in
America are familiar with the films of the 62-year-old Greek
master Theo Angelopoulos, whose earlier works were
politically on the left (in the days of the Greek military junta)
and which include, recently, "Ulysses' Gaze" starring Harvey
Keitel, about the downfall of Communism in Eastern Europe. 
Now that Greece is again a democracy, Angelopoulos has
turned--like Bertolucci--to making more personal films,
perhaps even more poetic than before with the occasional
burst of melodrama.  He is best known for the unique use to
which he puts his camera, the very opposite of MTV style. 
He tends to track his subjects slowly, eschewing the fancy
editing that Bertolucci freshly used to capture various
expressions on the face of that remarkable new actress,
Thandie Newton, in "Besieged." Yet he is no fan of
naturalism.  As his camera slowly pans, he may throw in a
sequence of magic realism, placing his hero effortlessly into
time travel--which is perhaps the most fascinating aspect of
his latest work, "Eternity and a Day."</P>
<P>    Known in Greek as "Mia eoniotita ke mia mera," this
Palme D'Or winner at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival is a
deeply felt character study highlighting a dying poet named
Alexandre (Bruno Ganz).  He has been diagnosed with a
terminal illness.  We see him on his final day before he is to
check into a hospital, an eventful day that leads him into one
high adventure which, in turn, helps him to reminisce about
his some of his better times with his late, lovely wife Anna
(Isabelle Renauld).  As he shifts back and forth in time from
the seaside home in which he spent many happy days,
Angelopoulos's cameraman, Girgos Arvanitis, appropriates
both the coastal beauty of the country and the craggy rocks
which give off a desolate, wintry feeling.  Two events cause
Alexandre to drift off into Proustian memories: one, the
discovery of several letters which his departed wife had left
for him; the other, his sheltering of an Albanian orphan boy of
Greek ethnicity (Achilleas Skevis), who is at first chased by
police while washing auto windshields with a gang of other
abandoned kids and later abducted by band of brigands to be
sold to rich tourists as illegal adoptions.</P>
<P>   The present-day scenes are the more compelling ones,
particularly one which takes place at a deteriorating, vacated
hotel, where tourists stop, look at the boys who are lined up
in a rogue's gallery, and make their selections.  By helping
the boy run away and befriending him, Alexandre, now facing
death, is able to restore his own spirit while protecting the
lad.  His strong identity with the boy is fed by his own view of
himself as an outsider.  At an earlier time, his parents took
him to Italy, where he lost not only his sense of place but his
language.  Upon his return to Greece, the alienated writer
found that he had actually to purchase words from others--a
situation which he dramatizes for us by having his new
disciple literally go up to people, carry back Greek words to
Alexandre, and gain the reward of a few drachmas.</P>
<P>   At 132 minutes, "Eternity and a Day" may feel like just that
to the MTV generation (who would not likely be seen in the
Angelopoulous' audience) but despite the director's
inadequacy fully to capture the character of Anna, the film is
quite worth viewing particularly for the scenes between
Alexandre and the boy he has saved.  We see elements here
of "Voyage to Cythera," which deals with a filmmaker who
wants to make a movie about an elderly political refugee, who
watches the old man and follows him, until the old man's life
takes on the elements of story.  In this case the refugee is a
kid, who acts as catalyst for the poet's own meditative
journey.  We're not clear whether the remarkable Bruno Ganz
is actually speaking Greek through the film.  If so, the
dubbing is remarkable as is the English translation--which
appears to capture the poetry of the spoken Greek.  For a
specialized audience, especially attuned to this director's
previous political works like "The Travelling Players," the
current, more personal film is a fine reflection on the life of a
man who felt himself an outsider for a good deal of his days
but has begun the process of healing through his memories
and through his existential commitment to an orphan boy.</P>
