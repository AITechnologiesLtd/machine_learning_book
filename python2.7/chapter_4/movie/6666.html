<P>Kenneth Branagh's 'Hamlet' is perhaps the most ambitious working of the
Shakespeare tragedy ever brought to the big screen.  Intelligent, literate,
exquisite and breathtaking are other adjectives that come to mind when
describing this film.  The Prince of Denmark and Shakespeare's nobel
protagonist is played by Branagh himself.  In comparison to Olivier and
Gibson's portrayal of this character, I was impressed by the way Branagh was
able to add a dimension of subtext in order to make it a four hour and two
minute journey well worth the time.  The story of Hamlet as almost everyone
knows is his determination to avenge his father's death at the hands of his
uncle.  But the story of this character is much more than that.  It's about
searching for what being human is all about and how life's complexities and
frailties can drive men insane.  Hamlet's uncle Claudius portrayed by Derek
Jacobi is a sharp and well meaning portrait of evil which Jacobi executes
with acute brilliance and his character is just as compelling as any in the
film.  Jacobi has played Hamlet many times in his career and relates to the
story very well in this film playing an opposite character.  Lord Laurence
Olivier who died in 1989 is perhaps the most famous Hamlet as his 1948 film
production won Oscars for best picture and for Olivier himself in the best
actor category.  Mel Gibson's Hamlet from 1990 was an interesting journey for
the superstar who proved there's more to film than 'Lethal Weapon' and 'Mad
Max.'  Other members of Branagh's production include Julie Christie, Kate
Winslet, Jack Lemmon, Charlton Heston, Billy Crystal and Robin Williams.  It
was photographed in 70 mm and looks spectacular on a movie screen displaying
that format which I was fortunate enough to see.  Certainly not original but
definitely ambitious and alternative, Kenneth Branagh's 'Hamlet' is one you
soon will not forget.</P>
