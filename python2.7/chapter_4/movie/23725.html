<PRE>Romeo Must Die (2000)</PRE>
<PRE>reviewed by Vince Yim</PRE>
<P>As the Hong Kong film industry disipated due to piracy, Triad
interference, one of the end results is the influx of very talented
individuals coming over to the North American film market.  This is a
godsend for many film buffs, wishing to see the high-octane fueled
gunplay of John Woo, lightning fast fists of Jackie Chan, and
charismatic screen presence of Chow Yun-Fat.</P>
<P>The unfortunate byproduct of mixing East and West cultures is that West
tends to dominate, leaving mere reflections of what once was.  Albeit,
the forementioned people have proven themselves, but only after a
lackluster turn.</P>
<P>John Woo made the brilliant actioner, Face/Off...but he also did start
out with the heavily edited Hard Target.  Jackie Chan has most of his
Hong Kong films released here, as well as the successful Rush Hour...but
then, he also starred in "Battle Creek Brawl" and "The Cannon Ball
Run".  And then there's Chow Yun-Fat, who received acclaim in Anna and
the King...but then, started out with "Replacement Killers".</P>
<P>Romeo Must Die, starring Jet Li, is one of these films.</P>
<P>Hot off the success of the super badass heavy in Lethal Weapon 4, Jet Li
comes back to his hero roots playing the role of Han, who escapes from
prison to find his brother's killers.  Along the way, he meets Tricia
(R&B singer Aaliyah), the daughter of a crime boss who helps him along
the way.  With the two warring families going at it...ah, never mind. 
The story has a mere passing resemblance to the Bard's play about doomed
love.  </P>
<P>For the most part, this is a very entertaining film.  Once you get past
the fact that 40% of the story and characters can be jettisoned, the
fact that it takes place in LA but it looks a hell of a lot like
Vancouver, a small handful of continuity errors, and the annoying
hip-hop soundtrack, the film is actually quite entertaining.</P>
<P>The Matrix blew the door open for martial arts flicks, and the ones they
do here work.  Of course, after Jackie Chan pioneered Wing-Chun in the
films and the use of every day objects as weaponry, it's hard to top. 
Of course, it's not like these guys don't try.  </P>
<P>For starters, there is the much talked about bone crunching which you
finally get to *see*, not just hear, thanks to the magic of CGI (one
character has his arm broken and you see the x-ray of his bones getting
broken).  Then, Jet Li also shows off some of his comic flare during a
slapstick sequence in which he is forced into a pickup football game. 
Upon learning the rules ("Why are they hitting me?"  "'Cuz you got the
ball."), he comes out on top and announces, "I love American football!" 
Then, there were some of the coolest fight sequences that Lethal 4 only
gave hints at.</P>
<PRE>But does the film work?  </PRE>
<PRE>Warts and all?  Well, kinda.</PRE>
<P>If you had to actually think of the storyline, you'd put yourself in an
asylum.  Or, you'd want to take up a screenwriting class and come up
with a better script.  Included in the 40% jettisonnable script is an
annoying subplot about the NFL (which doesn't make that much sense) and
a lot of nonsense that could've easily been replaced with more images of
Jet Li beating the snot out of someone bigger than he is.  But on the
plus side, they didn't give too much of a romance between Jet Li and
Aaliyah.</P>
<P>For the most part, I was entertained.  But then, I'm also from Vancouver
and I'm attending film school in the area.  A very, very deadly
combination for a film viewer/critic/cynic.  Much of the 2 hours in the
dark theatre were spent counting the cigarette burns (which tell the
projectionist when to change reels...but then, I had to watch Fight Club
first), noticing the glaring continuity errors during the chase scene
(bullet holes appear and disappear), and noticing that the place where
Han drops off Tricia in the cab happens to be the the same place that I
get off of the Skytrain.  And what's up with those "BC" Transit busses?</P>
<P>That, and the fact that movie soundtrack producers seem to think that
all Chinese people listen to nothing but hip-hop.  I'm Chinese and I
hate hip-hop.  There are fewer things worse than that Hack Daddy taking
old songs from the 80s and turning them into his (c)rap music
travesties.  The only song I like from Puff Daddy is "All About the
Benjamins", and that's only for Foo Fighters frontman David Grohl's
contribution.  "Come with Me"?  Puh-lease.  If I have to hear him say
"Uh huh...yeah" one more time...!  When Jet Li's Black Mask (aka Hap
Hak) was released to North American audiences, I went to a Chinese video
store and rented the version with Chinese dialogue, English subs, and NO
ANNOYING HIP-HOP SOUNDTRACK.</P>
<P>But for what it is, it's not bad, and a worthy first time effort for
it's director, Andrzej Bartkowiak, once responsible for cinemetography
of the Lethal Weapon flicks and a bunch of others.  It's certainly a
slick looking picture, and has almost enough martial arts to satisfy the
action starved audience.  While it doesn't quite match up to the
standards already set by Jet Li and his contemporaries, it's okay.</P>
<P>In terms of a film with a Hong Kong star in it, it's not bad.  Jet Li
could have done a lot worse (and judging from some of the North American
debuts had by his fellow countrymen, that's saying quite a bit).  But
here's to hoping that he'll finally get much, much better.</P>
