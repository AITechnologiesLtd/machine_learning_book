<P>GO *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( <A HREF="mailto:go@filmfreakcentral.net">go@filmfreakcentral.net</A> )</P>
<P>starring Sarah Polley, Desmond Askew, Jay Mohr, Scott Wolf
screenplay by John August
directed by Doug Liman</P>
<P>Go's is a gloriously slick hip machine. Director Liman (who also
photographed Go) and screenwriter August celebrate the drug/rave scene
in L.A., preferring to take (comedic) snapshots of troubled youth
rather than critique them. After more than ninety minutes of
pill-popping, tantric sex, car chases, and attempted murder, Go even
has a happy ending. This is the sort of film that gives members of the
Dove Foundation splitting headaches; as Go wound down, I anticipated
an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder
sermon that (blessedly) didn't arrive.</P>
<P>A la Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Go is comprised of three separate but
related stories. The basics are as follows: Ronna (Polley) is a bitter
grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for
extra dough. Her co-worker, Simon (the improbably named Askew), is a
clubber from Britain ecstatic about his first trip to Vegas.  Zack
(Mohr) and Adam (Wolf) are soap opera stars escaping a
career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop (Fichtner)
in a drug bust. Perhaps because the innovative structure of
Tarantino's non-linear masterwork is by now old hat, the id-fueled Go
delighted me but rarely surprised me (with the exception of that
mind-reading cat!); Pulp Fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen, but
we see Go's wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last.</P>
<P>Torontonian Polley (of The Sweet Hereafter) refused to do publicity
for this picture on the basis that she was "not pleased with" her turn
as the ill-fated cashier. In Go, she delivers, hands-down, her best
performance to date. Here's an (overrated) actress who agreed to
appear on the poster, but not support her team at the junket or in 
interviews; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for Ms. Polley, as
anyone who has read of her political agenda in the Canadian press will
tell you. If she doesn't want to be the ingenue of the moment, she
should have said "No," not Go.</P>
<P>But I digress. Go is a fun film, so chipperly depraved one can't help
but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride.
In that sense, it's a departure from Liman's last film, Swingers,
which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of Vince
Vaughan's Trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story's clever
epilogue (which has been aped by McDonald's for their latest
commercial). I wish I cared more about Go's characters: like 
the techno music they listen to, the bands of anarchists on display
here are at once absorbing and vacuous. When the lights came up and
stung my eyes, it was difficult to recall what about it entertained
me.</P>
<P>Yet entertain me it did. Go is light and frothy, featuring compelling
if not endearing work by Polley, Timothy Olyphant (Scream 2), and
especially Fichtner, whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective
laughs. Fichtner is a character actor best known for playing
backstabbers (in Heat, Armageddon, and others); his previously
untapped comic abilities shine in Go. Unlike much of the film,
Fichtner is unpredictable.</P>
