<PRE>Dirty Work
1/2 *
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
(C) 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>So far, I have personally seen more genuinely terrible and unwatchable movies
in 1998 than in any other year in recent memory. DIRTY WORK bellyflops
squarely onto the end of that astonishing string of stinkers. Not only was it
not screened for critics, but when trailers for the movie rolled two months
ago (ours was appended to GODZILLA), people walked out of the theater to wait
for it to end.</P>
<P>DIRTY WORK is offensive in the worst possible way: it's stupid AND
incompetent. The film's basic premise has potential: Norm MacDonald (late of
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE) plays a schlub who, in an attempt to raise money for his
father's heart transplant, starts a revenge-for-hire service. There! With
that concept in mind, sit down and write as many things you can think of that
might appear in a comedy about this subject. I'll bet my 401K fund that not
only do none of them appear in this movie, but that everything you wrote down
is guaranteed to be funnier than anything that happens on screen. The film is
a wretched parade of cheap shots at fat people, gays ("Keep your distance,
Liberace," one of the characters says after a too-intimate embrace), and
anyone else who wasn't in the room when they scrawled the script on the back
of a gum wrapper.</P>
<P>It's absolutely amazing. I racked my brains trying to remember a single funny
moment in this movie. There isn't one. Usually a movie will have SOMETHING
that at least makes you snicker, even if it's not deliberate. This movie is a
desert, seconded only by SOUR GRAPES so far as the worst movie of the year.
Matters aren't helped by the static direction (Bob Saget, of AMERICA'S
FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS) or MacDonald's dead delivery. He seems to think that
just because he could get laughs reading "Weekend Update" in a smiling
monotone, he can do the same with everything else he gets handed.</P>
<P>There is a little crew of amateur filmmakers who call themselves Random Foo
Productions. They've even got their own web site (www.randomfoo.com). I've
seen several of their homebrew movies already, and for a bunch of kids with
an operating budget that's probably less than what it costs to chauffeur a
big-name director to the airport, they are enormous fun.</P>
<P>Why do I mention them here? Draw your own conclusions.</P>
