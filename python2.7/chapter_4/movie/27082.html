<P>   "Before Night Falls" is about the plight of one Cuban
national whose childhood dream was to join Castro's rebels
against the U.S.-supported Batista regime but then soured on
the revolutionary government for good reason.  While the film
does not specifically point out the basis of novelist Reinaldo
Arenas' (Javier Bardem) enthusiasm for fighting the
established government while a child, his ardor was not
totally misguided.  For example, a case can be made even
today for the improvements that the Communist government
on that Spanish-speaking island made: 1) the poor, who were
(and still are) a majority of the population, were brought up
from third-grade educations to universal literacy; 2) health
care, nonexistent for the masses before 1959, is now free
and accessible; 3) the poverty of Cuba is shared by most of
the other Caribbean islands, none of which has a Communist
government; 4) the wide gulf between the wealth of the
powerful and the poverty of the masses has been eliminated;
5) Cuba's poverty is largely the result of an ongoing,
unjustified U.S. trade embargo and the drying up of subsidies
from the Russians.</P>
<P>   That said, we must realize that not only has Fidel Castro
installed himself as the chief executive for life (now 41 years
and counting), but had ordered a major campaign of
repression against political dissidents and homosexuals--
sending them into what amounts to concentration camps and
putting those who were most odious to the established order
in "boxes," similar to what American POWs experienced in
the cages of Vietnam.  It was this experience in a "box" and,
generally, in prison and via a program of harassments, that
turned Reinaldo away from any support of the revolutionary
regime, which even today sports an image of Che Guevara
as its national hero.</P>
<P>   Directed by Julian Schnable--who is Jewish, lives in Spain
and New York, and did not grow up with an overly enormous
interest in Cuba--"Before Night Falls" does quite a job of
bringing to life a poet and novelist who at one point
renounced his teachings (like Galileo) rather than continue to
suffer persecution in his jail but who ultimately sent a
message to the world by leaving the island in 1980 when
Castro allowed homosexuals, criminals, and other so-called
vermin to get out.  You may leave the theater with the
impression that quite a few documentaries would profit from
deleting the talking heads in favor of an authentic
dramatization such as Schnable's with stylized photography.</P>
<P>   Schnabel takes us to Reinaldo's childhood, which was an
idyllic one, one which demonstrates the young man's
absolute joy in freedom.  We see the author, whose mother
had been deserted by her husband and moved with Reinaldo
to a small Cuban town, realizing his homosexual bent with a
passion.  (He claimed to have had 5,000 sexual experiences
by the age of 25.)  Narrated throughout by Javier Bardem--
whose performance won him the National Board or Review's
designation as Best Actor for his role--"Before Night Falls"
shows the vise tightening on the man when, for no particular
reason, the Castro government repudiated the sexual
revolution which was part and parcel of the greater struggle
and did an about face, cracking down on homosexuals by
treating them in the same way it treated common criminals. 
During his worst year, Reinaldo was thrown in jail with scores
of rapists and murderers until he agrees to disavow his own
writings--which in one comic situation were smuggled out of
the jail into France where his memoirs won first prize for the
category.  </P>
<P>   Photographed by Xavier Perez Grobet and Guillermo
Rosas with a variety of lenses to evoke a jungle-like area
representing the author's childhood and frequent images of
water (presumably epitomizing both freedom and security),
the movie can't help forcing the audience to think about what
freedom really means.  I couldn't avoid wondering whether
Castro could have set an example for the world by allowing
Cubans to live in the style they wished provided that they did
not hurt others while making sure that the strong-arms used
their powers legitimately for defense and the maintenance of
an orderly, democratic government.  </P>
<P>   "Before Night Falls" is nothing if not a visual movie, as
though a painter like Jackson Pollock had spread a canvas
on the floor and splashed on lines and spots to stand in for
its various episodes.  Whether you agree with the National
Board of Review that Javier Bardem deserved their pick as
the actor of the year (I'm voting so far for Ed Harris in
"Pollock"), you'd have difficulty denying that the gifted
performer IS Reinaldo Arenas, who swings from a joyful
childhood with a beautiful mother to a sexually fulfilling psot-
adolescence, only to be brought down again and again by the
irrationalities of a puritanical system.</P>
