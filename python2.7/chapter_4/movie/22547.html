<P>THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS (Sony Pictures Classics)
Directed by Erick Zonca.</P>
<P>         The mark of a truly good movie isn't necessarily how much you
enjoy it while you're sitting in the theater (or on the couch, as the
case may be) but how you feel about it days or weeks later. A popcorn
extravaganza like "Wild Wild West" may help to kill a couple of hours on
a hot day, but it doesn't exactly sweeten in the memory, and if you
suffer through a truly bad film you want to start forgetting the
experience as quickly as possible.</P>
<P> "The Dreamlife of Angels" is a truly fine piece of work that's
certain to linger in your mind for quite awhile. You may find the
central characters a little hard to warm up to -- neither of them is
likely to be mistaken for Julia Roberts -- but their experiences, their
friendship and the difficult lessons they learn are genuinely haunting.</P>
<P> "Angels" is the story of Isa (Elodie Bouchez) and Marie
(Natacha Regnier), a pair of young women fending for themselves in a
dreary corner of France. Isa sells handmade postcards when she's in
between menial temporary jobs; Marie toils in a sweatshop and lives in
an apartment that belongs to a hospitalized mother and daughter.
Eventually Isa moves in with her and the two begin to find the
fun-loving, girlish parts of their personalities they've been forced to
suppress, probably for years. They begin hanging out at the mall, trying
to crash concerts and flirting playfully with anonymous guys. It's a
fulfilling friendship and, since this is a French film, you can rest
assured it won't last.</P>
<P> Before long, Marie, who initially seemed like the brighter of
the two, has fallen hopelessly for Chris (Gregoire Colin), a slick
womanizer who owns some clubs and dazzles her with his seemingly
limitless supply of cash. Isa sees through Chris and tries to steer her
friend toward a less well-heeled guy who truly adores Marie. Sadly,
Marie's self-esteem is so low she'd rather sneak away for a few
afternoon trysts in a motel room with Chris than consider spending time
with someone who might actually treat her with respect.</P>
<P> Using decidedly unglamorous locales and stars, director Erick
Zonca has given the story what amounts to an almost documentary feel;
Isa and Marie seem so true-to-life at times you might feel a bit
voyeuristic. "Dreamlife" is also a movie less concerned with plot than
it is with details and character development. The waifish Isa ultimately
becomes wise and self-sufficient while the more domineering Marie
gradually collapses from the inside out. Bouchez and Regnier so
brilliantly get under the skin of these women and provide them with such
vivid personalities that by the end you feel you've known them for
years.</P>
<P> Every so often Hollywood tries to Americanize French movies,
generally unsuccessfully. Let us pray no one hires Liv Tyler and Alicia
Silverstone to re-do "Dreamlife": That would truly be a nightmare. James
Sanford</P>
