 The Original Kings of Comedy (2000) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Steve
Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac. Directed by
Spike Lee. Rated R.</P>
<P> "The Original Kings of Comedy "is a raw, funny concert film
spotlighting four of the funniest black comedians on the circuit today -
Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac.</P>
<P> This is an interesting experience, not so much for the four gentlemen
named above, who all are very fine comedians. No, it is more for the
cultural significance of this venture.</P>
<P> It is interesting to compare this concert film with Richard Pryor's
groundbreaking 1979 `Live in Concert' movie.</P>
<P> My, how times have changed. The language is still as biting as it was
20-plus years ago. In fact, Bernie Mac delivers an entire riff on the
word `motherf ...,' explaining why black people like to use it so much.</P>
<P> But the anger of Pryor's time concerning the gap between blacks and
whites  has subsided, replaced by a bemused indulgence as if the
Caucasian race was a beat behind and not quick enough to get the joke.</P>
<P> That is not to say that this quartet of well-dressed funnymen don't do
a number on the foibles of blacks.</P>
<P> Harvey, for instance, begins by spoofing the hit film "Titanic,"
ridiculing the concept of the band staying on board and playing until
the ship sinks. Black musicians, he says, would have dropped their
instruments, grabbed the nearest piece of furniture for ballast and dove
in.</P>
<P> Harvey then berates rap music, explaining his love for the `old school'
- as he calls the sounds of the soul groups of the ‘60s and ‘70s. He
doesn't like going to rap concerts because it's too much work, he
explains.
The singers always are barking out orders: clap yo' hands, get on your
feet, feel the groove.</P>
<P> All poor Harvey wants to do is sit back and enjoy the music.</P>
<P> This is the tenor of the routines by the talented foursome.</P>
<P> Watching the comedians interact with the audience brings to mind a
church service. The fervor and love in which the Charlotte, N.C., crowd
embraces these men is akin to a clergyman-congregation relationship.</P>
<P> Director Spike Lee intercuts several audience reaction shots, and as
you watch, you feel as if he is more interested in the byplay between
performer and customer than in the actual comedic routines.</P>
<P> And he probably is. After all, Harvey, Hughley, Cedric and Bernie Mac
are not doing anything differently than they've done on various comedy
specials on HBO, Showtime or some other cable network.</P>
<P> It's not the comedy that is the main focus, but the cultural
phenomenon. The audience inspires the comedians, urging them on,
applauding, shouting encouragement and agreement, recognizing and
laughing at themselves in the various descriptions of black life
spotlighted by the standups.</P>
<P> Cedric regales the crowd with his explanation of why there isn't a
black president, going on to explain how a black leader would handle a
billion-dollar deficit, and the audience explodes.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, "The Original Kings of Comedy" will probably have a
limited appeal. I saw it with a mostly black preview audience, who
howled, stomped and clapped, enjoying themselves immensely.</P>
<P> I would urge others to take a chance. You may surprise yourself and
laugh along with the rest of us.</P>

<P>Bring It On (2000) 1 1/2 stars out of 4.. Starring Kirsten Dunst, Eliza
Dushku, Jesse Bradford and Gabrielle Union. Written by Jessica
Bendinger. Directed by Peyton Reed. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P> Probably the one saving grace of "Bring It On" is its sincerity.</P>
<P> After all, this is a story about cheerleaders - usually a target of
cinematic ridicule - and their struggles to make it to the national
championships in Orlando, Fla.</P>
<P> Admittedly, the plot isn't "War and Peace." This is just a silly,
formulaic movie with stock characters who are pretty to ogle.</P>
<P> The photography is well lit, the film's score is bouncy and the cast
plays it straight. It avoids the pitfalls of tackiness and sexism.</P>
<P> The story centers around the Rancho Carne High School cheerleading
squad in San Diego. The squad has won the national championship five
consecutive years. Now, under the leadership of newly appointed captain
Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst), the Toros squad will shoot for title
No. 6.</P>
<P> But Torrence makes a disturbing discovery. The squad's routines had
been stolen from the Clovers, a hip-hop squad from East Compton, by the
Toros' former captain.</P>
<P> Thus Torrance must create enough confidence in herself and her squad's
abilities to devise all new routines to carry them to the championship.</P>
<P> Meanwhile Isis (Gabrielle Union), the driven captain of the Clovers,
must concoct a way for her squad to raise money to attend the nationals
so they can gain the recognition they so richly deserve.</P>
<P> "Bring It On" does have a certain innocent charm to it, despite its
PG-13 rating. The sexual innuendo is limited to the cheerleading
routines.</P>
<P> The movie's main flaw is that most of the characters, especially the
Toros girls, are types.</P>
<P> But this is not the fault of the performers, but of writer Jessica
Bendinger.</P>
<P> Dunst, who made a startling film debut in "Interview With the Vampire,"
and since then has gone on to do fine work in such films as "Little
Women," "Drop Dead Gorgeous" and the made-for-cable drama "Devil's
Arithmetic," is smart, honest and inventive as Torrance.</P>
<P> the school has no gymnastics program. Dushku, best known for her role
as Faith in WB's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," plays Torrance's new best
friend who opens her eyes to the Toros' former captain's perfidy.</P>
<P> Acting honors, though, go to Union as the tough, self-sufficient Isis
who fights to bring her squad to the nationals.</P>
<P> "Bring It On" is very lightweight fare. Honestly, who takes
cheerleading - or cheerleaders - seriously. The good folks at Universal,
though, in trying to emphasize the importance of cheerleading enclosed a
fact sheet in the press kit that includes a list of famous people who
were cheerleaders. Among the names, Madonna, Kathie Lee Gifford, Donna
Rice, Alicia Silverstone, Meryl Streep, Paula Adbul, Halle Berry and
Sheryl Crow.</P>
<P> Come on, studio folks. It's only a movie - loud, colorful, but
feathery, with limited appeal for those who believe cheerleading is the
alpha and omega of their existence.</P>
