<P>Not many movies capture a mood the way Angel Heart does. Right from its
opening moments, the film begins to show off its incredible use of lighting
and visual structure, giving us a shot of a common New York alleyway. It's
quite an effective scene; watching it, you can't help but feel slightly
claustrophobic as the camera pans over the narrow alley, only to reveal that
it harbors a deadly secret. Technically, the scene is flawless.</P>
<P>But not only is that opening shot a marvel of cinematography and lighting,
but it also sets up the mood for what is to follow. Throughout the movie, we
think we're right there in the middle of things, maybe even a step or two
ahead of its hero. Then every so often, the story surprises us and reveals
that it has something up its sleeve, and at times that something can be far
more complicated than we at first perceive it to be.</P>
<P>That said hero is a private investigator named Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke),
a classic dick in the vein of the greats like Philip Marlowe and Jake
Gittes. He smokes, he womanizes, and above all, he doesn't seem to give a
damn about anybody. As the narrative opens circa 1950s, he is called upon by
a mysterious foreigner by the name of Louis Cyphre (Robert DeNiro, in an
extended cameo) to track down a missing band singer called Johnny Favorite.
It appears that Favorite once enlisted the aid of Cyphre, but has since
disappeared and left his debt unpaid. Angel's job then sounds simple enough;
merely find out if Favorite is alive or dead, and report his findings to the
elusive Cyphre. But through the course of the film, it becomes clear that
not everything is exactly what it seems, as Angel is pulled into the dark
world of New Orleans and all that inhabits.</P>
<P>Angel Heart follows in the tradition of some of my favorite movies from the
past, films like Chinatown and Sleuth, puzzle-box movies that at first seem
to be about one thing but then reveal themselves to be about something else
altogether. And indeed, Angel Heart borrows heavily from its predecessors,
not just visually but also thematically. Strangely, though, it never comes
across as a rip-off in any way, nor does it seem to be a gimmicky homage.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis' latest summer vehicle The Sixth Sense has recently took
America by storm, shocking unsuspecting audiences with its "jolting"
conclusion. Much like that film, some of the central themes in Angel Heart
are only made clear after the credits have begun rolling. And, yes, this
movie also features a finale that is designed to surprise the audience. The
only difference is, this time the trick worked. While The Sixth Sense and
its ending are more likely to leave you scratching your head, the ending of
Angel Heart makes perfect sense even under intense scrutiny. And also like
the Bruce Willis film, I knew the twist here before seeing the movie. Now,
I've gotten some pretty nasty e-mails attacking my review of The Sixth
Sense, most of them informing me that the sole reason I disliked the film so
much was because I had prior knowledge of the last twist. I guess, if
nothing else, Angel Heart at least proves that a movie can be extremely
effective and enjoyable even if the viewer is robbed of the surprise ending.</P>
<P>As good as the final trick is, the real star of the show here is Mickey
Rourke. In the '80s, he kind of existed as that decade's equivalent of
Marlon Brando. Constantly on the cutting edge, he went for the more risque
roles that other actors wouldn't dream of touching in fear of being forever
thought of as soft-core porn stars. But, sadly, the allusion to Brando
turned out to be all too accurate; much like the Godfather of film, he has
now drifted into obscurity. Every once in a while, he does land a film job,
but ends up being fired because he can't remember his lines (to be fair, in
the last movie he was working on, he was kicked off the set after demanding
that his small dog be featured in one of the shoot-out scenes).</P>
<P>But Angel Heart features Rourke in the prime of his acting days, and indeed
is one of his more steamy efforts. In fact, upon release, the movie was
slapped with the "X" rating due to one of its more controversial moments, a
truly unsettling and disturbing sex scene between Rourke and Lisa Bonet
(formally of "The Cosby Show"). Explaining exactly how the sequence is so
upsetting would be hard without giving away key plot points, but if you are
easily shaken you might want to fast-forward through it, even if it is one
of the most potent points. Eventually, 10 seconds were cut from the
interlude, but they are restored for most home video versions.</P>
<P>If you've the stomach to take it, Angel Heart serves as a very nice (albeit
unpleasant) alternative to trekking off to the local cineplex and wasting
your money on seeing The Sixth Sense for the third time.</P>
