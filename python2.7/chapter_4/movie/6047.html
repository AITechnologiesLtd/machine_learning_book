<P>WARNING: This review contains spoilers!</P>
<P>        I find that the best movies touch me on an emotional level, 
and "Basquiat" moved me deeply. The film, a character study of 
artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, is a heart-felt masterpiece of 
innovative film-making.
        Jean-Michel Basquiat was a young black artist living a 
hand-to-mouth existence in New York when he was discovered 
by critic Rene Ricard and became a darling of the New York art 
world, skyrocketing to a Warholesque fifteen minutes of fame. 
Basquiat died of a drug overdose just a few years later. Unlike 
many artists who suffer because of the indifference of the 
public to their work, Basquiat's plight was one of too-early 
fame mixed with the exploitation of his talent by the art world 
of the 1980's. 
        Writer-director Julian Schnabel, who was also a 
successful artist and darling of the 1980's art world, brought 
something to this film that few others could--first-hand 
knowledge of the milieu in which Basquiat moved. In my 
opinion, no other film made about an artist has the 
verisimilitude of "Basquiat." Most film portrayals of the life of 
an artist present stick-figure characters that seldom go 
beyond the mythic archetype of the artist as troubled genius. 
The title character in "Basquiat" is a much more complex, fully 
developed character than the Van Gogh in old Hollywood's 
"Lust for Life."
        Schnabel's skills as an artist make this a visually vivid 
film, using powerful images to tell the story of Basquiat's life. A 
particularly memorable example is the scene where Basquiat 
as a child is standing with his mother in front of Picasso's 
"Guernica." The painting moves his mother to tears as a shiny 
crown suddenly appears on the child's head. I interpreted this 
as a metaphor for the ability of a great painting to touch the 
deepest human emotions and transform lives. When the 
crown appeared on Basquiat's head, I felt that the artist was 
born within him.
         I thought that the film's greatest strength is Jeffrey 
Wright's superb performance as Jean-Michel Basquiat. Wright 
slips so easily into the role of Basquiat that there were times 
when I felt there was some Boswell-like videographer following 
the real Basquiat around. Yet, Schnabel's artistry is such that 
the film never feels like a documentary or even a docudrama. 
        Basquiat had no contact with his father, and his mother 
was in a mental institution. He sometimes seemed to distance 
himself from the world by alienating people who were close to 
him. One of the first people he alienated was Gina Cardinale 
(played luminously by Claire Forlani). Gina was an early 
girlfriend who took him in when he was homeless and loved 
him with selfless devotion before he found fame and fortune. 
She saved his life once when she found him in their apartment
nearly dead from a drug overdose. But Basquiat committed an 
infidelity with an art-world groupie (played by Courtney Love) 
and lost Gina soon after she found out. After losing Gina, he 
lives an increasingly solitary existence, and here the actor 
Wright is particularly effective in his use of body language and 
facial expression to portray Basquiat's slow withdrawal into 
himself.
        In spite of his isolation, Basquiat did have a rather 
strange friendship with Andy Warhol, and their friendship 
struck me as one of the more fascinating aspects of this film. 
Warhol became something of a surrogate father to Basquiat. 
Warhol was the only person who seemed to care enough about 
Basquiat to warn him about the perils of drug addiction.
        I thought that one of the best scenes in the movie was 
when Warhol and Basquiat worked collaboratively on a series 
of paintings. There was a sadness and a loneliness common to 
both men in this scene. They seemed to be two lost souls who 
found solace in each other's friendship for a while.
        I enjoyed David Bowie's low-key performance as Andy 
Warhol. Bowie's Warhol was soft spoken and introverted; it 
was Warhol as the private man, not Warhol's better known 
flamboyant persona as a diva of pop culture. 
        Racism is another thread in the movie. All of Basquiat's 
genius and all of his art world success could not shield him 
from the racism that he confronted in his daily life. In one 
scene in an elegant restaurant, a table of white businessmen 
stare rudely at Basquiat. Basquiat does not openly confront 
them with his anger; instead he tells the waiter that he will 
anonymously pay their check. In another similar scene, 
Basquiat is in an upscale deli with Andy Warhol when a clerk 
treats him rudely because of his race. Basquiat responds to 
this by buying a thousand dollars worth of caviar from the 
clerk. In yet another scene, Basquiat reacts with open hostility 
when a long-time white friend says something about Basquiat 
becoming "uppity" since his success. Basquiat becomes 
quarrelsome, and to get away from him, the friend angrily gets 
out of the taxi they are sharing. 
        However, Basquiat's race and his background as a graffiti 
artist made him chic with the hip New York art crowd of the 
1980's. This is reflected in the scene where he is working on 
some paintings in his studio and is visited by a gallery owner, 
an art collector, and the collector's bimboesque wife. The gallery 
owner announces to the couple, "This is the voice of the street." 
Tatum O'Neal is hilarious as the art collector's wife, who 
indicates to Basquiat that she might buy one of the paintings 
if he will paint over a large area of institutional-looking green 
with a more pleasant color. 
        There are many fine performances in the film, including 
Parker Posey as gallery owner Mary Boone, Gary Oldman as 
artist Albert Milo (Schnabel's fictional surrogate), Dennis 
Hopper as art dealer Bruno Bischofberger, and an 
exceptionally strong effort by Michael Wincott as the art critic 
Rene Ricard. 
        "Basquiat" is a rare treat. Few films have performances of 
the caliber that Jeffrey Wright gives in playing Jean-Michel 
Basquiat. And even fewer films have the kind of original vision 
shown in this one by Julian Schnabel. A film like this comes 
around only once in a long while: it would be a shame to miss it.</P>
