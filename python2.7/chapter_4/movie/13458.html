A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Daisy von Scherler Mayer</P>
<P>Written by: Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett, from the book by Ludwig
Bemelmans. </P>
<P>Starring: Hatty Jones and Frances McDormand</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
Paris boarding school for 12 young girls, adventures of little girl</P>
<P>Synopsis:
MADELINE begins with the opening of a storybook, and it should,
considering that it's a storybook movie for children. MADELINE doesn't
follow the normal stereotypical formats for action movies, comedies, et
cetera. Instead, MADELINE kind of wanders around, allowing the audience
to hear the tale, and experience spunky little Madeline's various
adventures, including discovering a kidnapping plot by goofy circus
clowns, and saving her boarding school.</P>
<P>Madeline (Hatty Jones) is an little British orphan girl who lives with
twelve other young girls in a charitable boarding school in Paris. The
school is run by the intuitive nun, Miss Clavel (Frances McDormand), who
can often smell when "something is not right." In this case, something
is often not right, since Madeline is always getting into one form of
mischief or another.</P>
<P>Madeline's adventures include having an operation at the hospital,
falling into a river, looking for a lost dog, befriending a neighborhood
boy, trying to figure out why the boarding school's owner Lord Covington
wants to close down the school, and foiling a kidnapping attempt on the
Spanish ambassador's son. </P>
<P>Opinion: 
Summer movies always seem to be geared towards adolescent males (or as
my girlfriend would say, the adolescent in all males). Main characters?
Male cop, male detective, male kid, male oil driller, male doctor, male
cowboy, male secret agent, male pig, male scientist, male plastic toy,
male dog. And the hero always has to save things on a really grand
scale. He fights off 100 thugs single-handedly, saves the town, saves
the free world, saves his city, saves America, saves his female partner
and the Earth, et cetera et cetera. Movies for adults demand that heroes
do fantasy on a big scale.</P>
<P>On the other hand, elementary school-aged kids have a different
mentality. To a kid, spending a night in the hospital getting your
tonsils taken out is suspenseful. Looking for your lost dog is dramatic.
Saving a baby bird is simply monumental. Adults swallow movies with
formula plots. But to a kid, walking around meeting new friends and
escaping trouble suffices for plot. As a result, kid movies are way
different from adult movies. </P>
<P>The problem is, these days hardly anyone knows how to make kid movies.
Typical of most attempts are kiddie-aged heroes who are supposed to
speak like real kids, but end up sounding like hipper-than-thou
thirty-something script writers. And it's especially rare to find a
movie where the protagonist is a spunky elementary school-aged girl who
actually thinks and acts like an elementary school-aged girl. How many
can you think of, off the top of your head?</P>
<P>Rare, indeed. That's what makes MADELINE is somewhat of a gem, despite
arguably anglo-centric overtones (in the movie, Africans and Indians are
exoticized and tricked). MADELINE is done from a small girl's point of
view, and it's done well. It's simply a story about a little girl who
has a few neat little adventures. No emotional baggage, weighty
cynicism,  fancy tricks, world-banging drama, no violence, no sex, no
gore. Just the simple wonder of being young and wondrous and meeting
interesting folks and having occasional excitement. Throw in scenes
involving a loyal doggy, a caring old woman, adventure at the circus,
and an exciting kidnapping, and your kids have themselves a quality
movie.</P>
