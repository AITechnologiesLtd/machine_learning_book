<P>You wanna know what grates my cheese? [go ahead, nod. You know you
wanna.]  Ok, I'll tell ya: doofus creativity-challenged movie executives
who cut-n-paste together movie trailers that might as well be released
as mini-movies, since they show almost all the best parts of the flick
in question (and do so a kabillion times before the movie opens, at
that) - and certainly give away way more of the movie than the audience
needs to know, not allowing that magical "aha!" moment when we Discover
what's happening in a film for our at least halfway-intelligent selves.
Between those oafs in the movie business, and their TeeVee
promo-creating counterparts, I'd like to round 'em all up and take
grandaddy's best belt to their ig'nant little hides, I tell ya.</P>
<P>And if that's the biggest rant I could muster up about DISNEY'S THE KID,
then I reckon it had to be a pretty decent movie.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is, in a word, a jerk.  At least, that's what
the world thinks of him, and he plays the part well.  Russ, a nearly
40-year-old professional image consultant who admittedly gets off on
telling people what to do, has little patience for displays of emotion
or affection, especially as concerns his father, with whom he has
lingering Childhood Issues (which, as we find later, develop into Adult
Unfulfillment Issues).  Everyone - from his put-upon pseudo girlfriend
Amy (the delightful Emily Mortimer), put-upon assistant Janet (the
somewhat delightful Lily Tomlin), professional boxer and Russ' client
Kenny (the not as delightful, but good looking baldie Chi McBride), and
Diedre Lafere (the surprisingly delightful Jean Smart), a very friendly
TV anchorwoman he met on a plane - thinks Russ is in dire need of a soul
makeover, not to mention, a clue.  And he just might find both in
8-year-old Rusty (the sho'nuff delightful Spencer Breslin), who has a
whole lot in common with Russ.  A younger version of Russ, that is.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Bruce Willis, near as I can tell, has three acting personas: there's the
Serious, Silent type, like the characters he played in flicks like THE
SIXTH SENSE and DIE HARD [1 only; 2 and 3 were pale imitations.  See
also: Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapons 2-36"]; the Sincerely Humorous type
that he shared with his audience in the early days of the MOONLIGHTING
TV series; and then there's the Gotta Get Pi-zaid type that helped to
further stink up an already malodorous HUDSON HAWK.  Of the three, I
prefer his Sincerely Humorous persona.  That's the one that showed up in
The Kid - and from all appearances, his co-stars grooved with that
persona, too.</P>
<P>Willis performs remarkably well as a man who has filled his life with
Big Status-y Things to try (unsuccessfully) to fill the gaps that come
from a life's dream deferred.  Neither mawkish nor completely
irredeemable (consider: would a total jerk *really* pay for someone
else's groceries, just to get out of a grocery store quickly?  Force his
way through the line, sure; but, pay in full?), his Russ has a mid-life
crisis of a different sort than we're used to seeing.  Here, Russ'
discovery comes through the mirror of his younger self, who sees the
"small" things older Russ *doesn't* have - a meaningful job, a family,
heck, even a dog [how could he not have a dog, sheesh!] - as the true
mark of a life gone wrong.   It would be easy for that character to be
played as a kick-me target to laughed at; it is much to Willis' credit
that, for the most part, he avoids derision in that sense.</P>
<P>Each of the lead actors and their characters seemed to Play Well with
Willis - and he, in turn, gets an A for Sharing Playspace (Reasonably)
Nicely with them.  Emily Mortimer was a nice discovery for me here
(though, I must admit, she would've made a better "best friend" type for
Russ than a possible girlfriend.  Jean Smart absolutely sizzled
on-screen and provided more than a match for Bruce Willis; hard to
understand [she said, tongue firmly in-cheek] why the choice was made to
pair Willis with the younger actress instead.  Ah, Hollyweird).  The
screeching irritant of Renee Zellwiger in ME, MYSELF & IRENE having been
the last (non-cartoon) female lead I'd been exposed to, Mortimer
provided a pleasant contrast in her very user-friendly approach to a
character that could've easily been played as cloying and pathetic in
the wrong hands.  Mortimer's "hands" reminded me of some of the better
works of actress Minnie Driver; I look forward to seeing more of
Mortimer in movies to come.</P>
<P>Similarly, both Jean Smart and Spencer Breslin exceeded my expectations.
Smart, most notably known for her time on CBS-TV in DESIGNING WOMEN, was
always too broad a broad in that show; here, she kept the Good Ol' Girl
drawl in check, delivering a much more subtle, yet substantial,
performance in a role that was kind of strangely written in the first
place.  It threatened to be *over*written, but she pulled it off
nonetheless.  And even though many of his best lines were already
trailer-spoiled, Breslin's Rusty, bless his chubby little heart, had me
in stitches at times, and - remembering my own sometimes torturous
childhood - nearly in tears at others.  If nothing else, he deserves
hosannas for having more in common with child actor Haley Joel Osment
from THE SIXTH SENSE, than with the bratty Macaulay Culkin from HOME
ALONE (for now, at least.  I'll keep a good thought for Breslin; we
don't need another Culkin loosed upon us).</P>
<P>That's not to say, of course, that DISNEY'S THE KID didn't have its
faults.  "Kid" almost included too many characters (Chi McBride's boxer
Kenny, who Russ seeks out to help him teach Rusty how to defend himself,
was right on the edge of being a Diversity Addendum), the smarmily-cute
level got notched up near 11 a couple of times, and some obvious Issues
(for instance, the big How'd It All Happen In The First Place question)
might have, in a lesser flick, left me gasping for fresh air.  But "Kid"
had enough good clean fun, acted and filmed breezily, to balance it all
out.  I found myself laughing, and smiling, with ease, throughout this
Disney flick.</P>
<P>Issues of trailer-spoilage by numbnut preview creators aside (which, to
its credit, the movie overcame), you'll learn nothing new in DISNEY'S
THE KID that you haven't seen before in other "childhood reversal"
flicks like BIG ("Kid"'s sibling in overall theme), for instance.  Then
again, it might just be that in our rush to get from Here to There, we
adults have forgotten those lessons that BIG and DISNEY'S THE KID are
trying to teach us, if we'd only listen.  Or maybe, it's just as good an
excuse as any to laugh at ourselves for an hour our two.  Can't beat
that with a stick, eh?</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Not for nothin', but it must be said: whathell was Kenny Edmonds
thinking???</P>
<P>(Watch the movie, during the wedding scene, or buy the soundtrack.
You'll see - better yet, you'll *hear* - what I mean).</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
If you liked Tom Hanks' turn in BIG - and I loved Tom Hanks' turn in BIG
- you'll like this flick.  DISNEY'S THE KID is a feel-good movie that
won't leave you feeling guilty for playing along with it, even though
kids were watching and laughing at the same jokes as we adults laughed
at.  Now if I could just hunt down the stoopid trailer-makers that give
away damn near the whole movie, like the vermin that they are...</P>
<P>DISNEY'S THE KID (rating: greenlight):
I wouldn't be a kid again if you paid me; but I wonder how 8-year-old
Rose would Like Me Now.  Hmmm...</P>
