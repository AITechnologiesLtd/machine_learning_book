<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Okay, I admit it. As a critic, I'm supposed to approach any movie 
objectively, but that isn't always the case. There are some films I'm just 
predisposed to liking -- anything starring Jimmy Stewart, for example.</P>
<P>"Dungeons & Dragons" falls into this category. I've been a participant in 
the role-playing game for thirteen years, and have anticipated its 
big-screen treatment for some time. To further whet my appetite, the film 
features a cameo by one of my favourite actors (Tom Baker, the 
curly-haired Time Lord with the immense scarf on the BBC's "Doctor Who"). 
And this is on top of boasting two traditionally excellent actors in 
Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch.</P>
<P>First, let's be clear: "Dungeons & Dragons" isn't really "based on" the 
role-playing game. That's because there's not a lot of source material: 
D&D, the game, is a set of mechanics sparsely peppered with vague 
background. You could just as easily create a movie based on "Monopoly" or 
"Yahtzee". The basic idea is to take the rules set down in the D&D game 
and apply them to a scenario invented by the players themselves.</P>
<P>The world depicted in "Dungeons & Dragons", the movie, is therefore 
entirely an invention of producer/director Courtney Solomon and writers 
Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright. At best, "Dungeons & Dragons" 
adheres to the rules laid down in the game, and then only loosely.</P>
<P>The Empire of Izmer is on the brink of civil war. Socially-conscious 
young Empress Savina (Birch) is locked in a struggle with the ruling 
Council of Mages, led by Profion (Irons). Profion desires power for 
himself, but Savina wields an enchanted staff which allows her to control 
mighty gold dragons. Through his brutish underling Damodar (Bruce Payne), 
Profion learns of another magical staff which would permit him to command 
red dragons. However, the roguish Ridley (Justin Whalin) uncovers 
Profion's plot, and sets out on a quest to find the staff first.</P>
<P>Ridley quickly accumulates a party of allies, including his thieving 
partner Snails (Marlon Wayans), apprentice magic-user Norda (Zoe 
McLellan), elven tracker Marrina (Kristen Wilson) and gluttonous dwarf 
Elwood (Lee Arenberg). (The name Elwood comes from the press material -- 
if the dwarf is ever actually named onscreen, I didn't hear it.) The 
amusing thing is that, with the exception of Snails, Ridley's companions 
accomplish nothing beyond serving as convenient hostages for the bad 
guys. One amusing scene, in which they confront Profion one after the 
other only to each be instantly despatched by the villain, tells the whole 
story.</P>
<P>His adventuring band assembled, Ridley endures a series of dungeons and 
mazes, eventually leading to the recovery of the fabled staff. With the 
dungeons dispensed with, what comes next but -- you guessed it -- the 
dragons. Lots of them. Apparently, someone didn't quite realise that 
"Dungeons & Dragons" is just a cute, alliterative name for the game, not 
its complete description.</P>
<P>Solomon allegedly spent a decade crafting the storyline for this film, but 
it scarcely shows. Frankly, I've seen better D&D adventures put together 
on the spur of the moment at the start of a gaming session. At its best, 
D&D allows participants' imaginations to soar. Solomon, on the other hand, 
has kept his story firmly rooted in the most laboured cliches of the genre 
-- everything from sliding walls to those boobytrapped floors where you 
have to step on just the right stones to make it across. It's telling that 
one of the movie's seemingly more interesting scenes, in which Ridley and 
Norda actually enter a magic map and confront the spirit dwelling within, 
is reported purely through dialogue.</P>
<P>The acting in "Dungeons & Dragons" is almost universally abysmal. Whalin 
(who was the second, far duller Jimmy Olsen in the "Lois & Clark" TV 
series) and McLellan have clearly been cast purely for their all-American 
good looks; their overacting is embarrassing to behold. Only Irons 
surpasses them in this regard, chewing the scenery with gusto literally 
every time he appears. Birch shows none of the prowess she demonstrated in 
"American Beauty" -- she utters lines of dialogue as though her mouth was 
filled with marbles, and she lives up to her surname for wooden acting. 
Payne apparently spends the entire movie under the misapprehension that 
talking in a raspy voice makes him sound menacing and not at all like a 
guy in need of some Vicks Vapo-Rub; he inexplicably wears silver lipstick 
throughout, to boot. Virtually the only reasonable acting is offered by 
Wayans, but this is mitigated by the fact that his role as the cowardly, 
covetous Snails verges on being a racist stereotype.</P>
<P>None of them are helped out by the clumsy, cheesy script concocted by 
Lilien and Cartwright. As bad as the delivery might be, in many cases the 
actual dialogue is even worse. Consider this hair-curling exchange. 
Profion: "I shall invent a NEW DESTINY of PAIN for you... and NEW SENSES 
with which to FEEL IT!" Ridley: "Not if I kill you first!" (Truly, the 
snappy comeback is a lost art.) And everything leads up to an ending which 
tries to be touching and inspiring, but only manages to be sappy and 
confused.</P>
<P>Visually, "Dungeons & Dragons" is respectable, with scenes of dragons in 
combat above Izmer looking particularly good (albeit clearly 
computer-generated). However, it does appear that the production was 
running low on funds for some sequences -- for instance, count the number 
of times Ridley and friends seem to pass the exact same copse of trees. 
(Then again, maybe they accidentally let Irons loose on that particular 
set.)</P>
<P>Otherwise, about the only thing "Dungeons & Dragons" has going for it is 
that it at least falls into the category of films so bad they're funny. 
It's difficult to be bored sitting through this one when you're spending
the whole time laughing at it (at it, mind you, not with it). If ever 
there was a compelling reason to revive the late, lamented "Mystery 
Science Theater 3000", "Dungeons & Dragons" is it.</P>
