<P>    THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD, a love story left over from last year, is
another go-around with JERRY MAGUIRE's Renee Zellweger and her funky-
looking lips.  The Girl That Makes You Wonder About Collagen plays
Novalyne Price, the small-town schoolteacher (and aspiring writer) who
pursued Conan the Barbarian creator Robert E. Howard (Vincent D'Onofrio,
who also co-produced) during the Depression.  The story is true, the
scenery is nice, and D'Onofrio's rough-and- tumble character is
endlessly interesting.  The second hour is sluggish, though, and for a
variety of reasons.  In particular, I was curious about the passage of
time.  Over how many years does the story take place?</P>

<PRE>Notes
=====</PRE>
<P>     THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD was screened at the Colony Theatre in Raleigh
on 3/7.  'Twas the quintessential off night:  a late start, a popcorn
shortage, *and* a projector shutter that closed before the end titles
(with epilogue) finished rolling.  Talk about a grumpy audience!</P>
