<P>     THE JACKAL is a high-tech, low-believability thriller, starring
Bruce Willis as the title character, an expert assassin and master of
many disguises, who's contracted by a Russian mob boss for a hit on the
head of the F.B.I.  One of the few who can actually identify the Big J.
is a former I.R.A. operative (Richard Gere), imprisoned in the U.S. and
ready to cut a deal if it means a chance to get out and about and maybe
escape, or see his old girlfriend (Steven Tyler lookalike Mathilda May),
or, hell, just be awarded a transfer to a minimum-security prison.  So,
the guy with the good looks and giggle-inducing accent is paired with a
pair of agents, one from Washington (Sidney Poiter) and the other from
Moscow (Diane Venora).  And a-travellin' they go, trotting the continent
for clues, while their target gets ever-closer to his quarry.</P>
<P>     As a loose and largely unremarkable remake of THE DAY OF THE
JACKAL, the film has a few things going for it.  Let's see...  several
of the action sequences are legitimate pulse-pounders, even if they
rarely serve the story well.  The scenery and spacious sets are also
quite eye-catching.  (However dumb the story becomes, you *do* feel like
you're going places:  Moscow, Helsinki, London, Montreal, and, in one
head-scratching shot of Willis aboard an Outer Banks ferry, a trip from
Chicago to the suburbs of D.C. by way of Morehead City!) And then
there's Bruce, the coolest cat on the block and the only guy in the
movie who has a pair.  (Gere looks good and that's about it.  Poitier
brings grace, but not enough weight.  Only Ms. Venora displays the
requisite intensity required of their roles.)</P>
<P>     On the suck side, the finale runs long, the plot has too many
holes, and the tone, at times, skirts dangerously close to camp.  (The
high low point?  I gotta go with Bad Death Scene #1.  You may need to
leave the theater for that one.) And, let's see, some of the effects are
weak, such as a blue-screen bit set in a subway tunnel.  (But doesn't
Gere grimace convincingly?) Oh, and, Heaven help us, there's even a
stranger-in-the-house sequence-- the same scene I swear saw in SWITCH-
BACK, KISS THE GIRLS, and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.  Sigh.  Well,
at least Willis' disguises are fun.  His portly Canuck is a sight, eh?,
but be back from the bathroom before Bruce hits a gay bar as a frisky
swinger.  Even if it (and its follow-up scene) fails to amuse, at least
you'll know what they're talking about, when the inevitable outrage
erupts.  Directed by Michael Caton-Jones (ROB ROY).</P>
