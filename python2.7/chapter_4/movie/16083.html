<P>There's something to be said for reality, and MTV Productions' latest
movie, VARSITY BLUES, proves it beyond a doubt. Even the most flawed
movies -- those filled with bad acting, poor direction, horrible
writing, and misguided photography -- can salvage some dignity by
clinging to reality. But when any real-world sense is thrown out the
window, as in VARSITY BLUES, the product becomes a 100-minute travel
along a downward spiral. Directed by GOOD BURGER helmer Brian Robbins,
VARSITY BLUES is easily bottom-of-the-barrel entertainment. </P>
<P>As with any Gen-X MTV movie (like last year's DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS), the
movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main
selling points: sex and football. Those two items, wrapped in a
guilty-pleasure package, are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk
initially, but sales will decline for two reasons. First, the football
sequences are nothing new, nor can they be; the sports genre isn't
mainstream and it's been retread to death. Second, the sex is just bad.
Despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all-night
strip-club party, there's nothing even remotely tantalizing. </P>
<P>The acting is mostly mediocre, not including the fantastic Jon Voight.
Cultivating his usual sliminess, Voight gives an unexpectedly standout
performance as West Canaan Coyotes head coach Bud Kilmer. Kilmer is the
driving force behind the Coyotes' twenty-two conference championships
and two state titles in thirty years; this year he plans to make it
twenty-three. Unfortunately, when his star quarterback, Lance Harbor
(Paul Walker), goes down for the count, he's got to rely on the
unreliable abilities of backup John Moxon (James Van Der Beek). Moxon
leads the team through its last four games, and then must cope with his
newfound stardom, the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend
Julie (Amy Smart), and other temptations that abound in football-crazy
West Canaan. </P>
<P>Most regions of the country are not nearly as football-crazy as Texas,
and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most. Similarly, the set
design is wrong for a high school setting: the teams are decked out with
sparkling uniforms, radio headsets (which never seem to work, however,
and instead require coaches to signal plays manually), and even a giant
bronze statue of Coach Kilmer. These elements (as well as the heavy
drinking and carousing) might be more appropriate on a college campus --
but MTV's core audience is the high school demographic. This focus is
further emphasized by the casting: James Van Der Beek, of TV's "Dawson's
Creek," is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero, although he
never manages to do anything with the role. Other stars are similarly
young and unmemorable. </P>
<P>There's not much that goes right about VARSITY BLUES, and there's not
much to like about it, either. Everything herein has already been done,
and if it hasn't, the movie manages to botch it one way or another. This
is certainly missable.</P>
