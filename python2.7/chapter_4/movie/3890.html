<PRE>                            NATURAL BORN KILLERS
                       A film review by Carl Miller
                        Copyright 1995 Carl Miller</PRE>
<P>     Opening scene: Mickey and Mallory Knox arrive at a remote cafe.
Mallory turns on the juke box, while Mickey orders some kee lime pie.
Already, we see the bizarre editing style which will pervade the
movie--short clips of odd camera angles, often in black and white, as
if Stone is trying to give meaning to such innocuous conversation as
"You ever had key lime pie?"</P>
<P>     One of the truckers starts dancing with Mallory.  Mallory says,
"Are you flirting with me?" and starts punching him.  Pretty quickly,
Mickey and Mallory go from fists to knives to guns, killing the
occupants one by one.  At one point, a waitress cries and tries to
shield herself with a coffee pot.  She dies, of course--if there's
one thing that can be said about this movie, it's that everyone whom we
expect to die dies.  Having killed all but one customer (left behind,
"to tell the tale"), Mickey and Mallory hop in their car and drive
away.</P>
<P>     As you can expect, you're going to see quite a few more murders
just like these.  Each one, though, is a new twist--a new and more
disgusting way to die.  Mallory beats one man and then breaks his neck
while Mickey knifes another.  Mallory cuts a man's throat, then shoots
him in the head.  Really, much more focus is given on graphic death
scenes than characterization of the victims or the killers.</P>
<P>     Now, a lot of ultra-violent movies are good.  A CLOCKWORK
ORANGE and RESERVOIR DOGS were great.  But as the viewer may begin to
realize as the film progesses, there isn't much more to the film than
violence.</P>
<P>     Of course, the film tries to delve into the reasons why Mickey and
Mallory enjoy killing so much.  Both were abused as children--in fact,
in one of the film's many laughably overblown scenes, we have Rodney
Dangerfield abusing Mallory on a sitcom called "I Love Mallory".  It's
somewhat confusing how this sitcom fits into the story--like much of
the film, there's no separation between fantasy and reality.  One
minute Rodney Dangerfield is talking about molesting Mallory to a
laughtrack, and the next minute Mickey walks in with a crowbar to
liberate Mallory.  As for Mickey, we only have a few black and white
clips of him as a child, saying, "Please, don't hit me." These are
stuck in with clips of Mickey with blood running down his face, dragons
breathing fire, and animated comic book characters.  These clips have
no meaning--they only serve to annoy and confuse the viewer.</P>
<P>     Tommy Lee Jones does what he can with his role, which isn't much.
Robert Downey Jr. overplays a bit, but the viewer should be used to
that by the time he comes on screen.</P>
<P>     To top it all of, the story just doesn't work.  When Mickey is
surrounded in a convenience store, he surrenders, only to knife a
policeman in the face.  But no one thinks to shoot him--instead seven
or eight policeman beat him with batons, for an unrevealed length of
time.  (When seen a year later, he has suffered no lasting damage
whatsoever.) No one ever thinks to shoot them--the warden even says
"every time we're ready to put them to death, they go and kill someone,
and we have to start the whole thing over again," as if policemen were
not permitted to shoot mass murderers in the act of killing.  And the
end--which I won't reveal--just doesn't make sense.</P>
<P>     This film is not a total disaster, probably because of Quentin
Tarantino's original screenplay.  But whatever he wrote is buried under
Stone's sensationalism--this film bears virtually no resemblance to
PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOGS.</P>
