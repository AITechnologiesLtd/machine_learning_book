<P>SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL A Movie review By Jesse A. Kaplan</P>
<P>Cast:  Jason Patric, Sandra Bullock, WIlliam Defoe</P>
<P>In a summer of Blockbuster Movie Sequals, one of the more unnessary ones
made was non other than SPEED 2.  I see no reason for this movie to be
made.  Besides the graet explosion scenes, and there are only a few,
this movie has little plot, little acting, and little enjoyment.</P>
<P>Sandra Bullock (A TIME TO KILL, THE NET) makes her return to the action
genre as Annie, who seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Consider her DIE HARD's femals John McClane, minus his funny wisecracks
and ability to fight.  Considering the fact that SPEED star Keanu Reeves
dropped out of the project in the early stages, replacement Jason Patric
(SLEEPERS), basically plays the same role as Reeves did, a Los Angeles
SWAT team member with a knack for saving the day and having no
conscience onto what happens to him.  This time, Patric's character
Alex, is on a cruise with Annie.  Little does he know that evil and
insane William Defoe (CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER) is plotting to steal the
ships jewels and blow up the boat because he ways layed off of his job
as computer specialist for the cruise line.</P>
<P>You've seen this one before entering the theater so take a guess what
happens.  Yep thats it, Defoe out smarts the cruise ship's crew and
takes control of the boat so Alex must save the day. Like I stated
previously, the acting here is week.  After givcing strong roles in THE
NET and A TIME TO KILL, Bullock is genuinly annoying in this picture and
while watching it I didn't really care what happened to her.  Defoe was
absolutely horrible as the mad bomber and hopefully he will stick to
small, supporting roles for the future.  I'm not sure how great Patric
was.His character was completely one-dimentinol so there was no reason
to care about him.  Basically, I could have said his lines the smae and
it would have made no difference.  Temuera Morrison is good as Juliano,
the ship's first mate.  Christine Firkins is wonderful as Drew, a deaf
girl who gets trapped in the underbody of the boat.  She steals every
scene she's in.</P>
<P>Beside's some great underwater shots, a couple of explosions, and Sandra
Bullock in some of those outfits, SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL, may have a
cool name, but thats about it.  ** thats all.</P>
<P>SPEED 2 runs longer than necessary at 2:13. It is rated PG-13 for
disaster action and violence.</P>
<PRE>**** = A must see film.
 *** = Excellent show. Look for it.
  ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable.
   * = Poor show. Don't waste your money.
   0 = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
