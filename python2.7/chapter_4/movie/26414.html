<PRE>_Bamboozled_ (R) **</PRE>
<P>With the NAACP once again criticizing the four major American broadcast
television networks for the lack of racial diversity--and a limited
variety roles for African-Americans--in the new television season, the
time is ripe for a film like _Bamboozled_, which satirizes the TV
industry's arguably racist practices.  And who better than Spike Lee to
direct such a confrontational film, right?  But it's one thing for a film
to wear an agenda on its sleeve, and quite another to do what Lee does
here--bludgeon the viewers with his message, preaching to them rather
than making them think while entertaining them.</P>
<P>For a little while, though, Lee achieves that balance.  A good example
is an early scene where Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans), the sole black
writer for the fictional Continental Network System, is told by the
network's white, ebonics-spouting programming head Dunwitty (Michael
Rapaport) that he's "blacker" than he is.  In addition to wringing
pointed, biting laughs, this scene also concisely pints up a real issue:
the Harvard-educated Pierre wants to create respectable series
spotlighting the oft-ignored African-American middle class (think
_The_Cosby_Show_) while Dunwitty wants to see the slang- and slapstick-
heavy sitcoms that are the predominant television showcase for blacks
(think _Homeboys_in_Outer_Space_).</P>
<P>So, in an act of spite, Pierre gives Dunwitty exactly what he wants--to
the nth degree: _Mantan:_The_New_Millennium_Minstrel_Show_, featuring
street performers Manray (Savion Glover) and Womack (Tommy Davidson) in a
throwback to the offensive comedy/variety stereotypes of yesteryear. 
Watermelon patch dwellers "Mantan" and "Sleep 'N Eat" wear burnt cork
blackface and get into all sorts of misadventures--always as a direct
result of their ignorance and laziness.  But every once and a while,
Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat break out into spirited song and dance numbers
while backed up by their house band, the Alabama Porch Monkeys; and their
dance troupe, the Pickaninnys.</P>
<P>The parallel Lee draws between TV (and entertainment in general) of
today and yesteryear is clear--blackface aside, the common portrayal of
African-Americans on the tube is disconcertingly similar, if not nearly
identical.  As the film firmly establishes this provocative point through
that plot development, it would only follow that _Bamboozled_ would then
build into even more incendiary satire.  What ignites instead, however,
is Lee's need to vent about a variety of other issues.</P>
<P>Much like how _Mantan_ slips out of control as it becomes an unexpected
runaway success, _Bamboozled_ soon flies off the reins.  Now a media
sensation, Manray indulges in the high life and believes his own hype;
similarly, Pierre, who could already be pegged as a sellout with his
ridiculously "refined" accent and diction, basks in the attention and
accolades for a creation that he designed to die on the vine.  Lest one
think one of the film's messages is to "keep it real," the Mau Maus, an
afrocentric rap group headed by the brother (Mos Def) of Pierre's
assistant Sloan (an impressive Jada Pinkett-Smith), is similarly raked
over the coals and then some; for all their talk of revolution and
staying true to their roots (for example, Sloan's brother changed his
name from Julian to Big Black Africa), they spend most of their time
guzzling forties and smoking weed.</P>
<P>Despite the muddiness caused by all the peripheral concerns, Lee never
makes one forget that _Bamboozled_ is, foremost, an attack on racial
misrepresentation in entertainment.  It's impossible to sight of that,
given how increasingly heavy handed his technique gets as the film wears
on, crossing the line between satire and sermon; sly, stinging wit makes
way for earnest and overblown preachiness--as exemplified by a lengthy
montage of racist images in entertainment through the years that comes
late in the film.</P>
<P>Amplifying the sense of bombast is a violent, melodramatic
wrap-up--which, in itself, reinforces another stereotype: that
African-American-themed films end with some type of bloodshed.  Is this
another point on Lee's list or an unfortunate coincidence?  With the
bungle that is _Bamboozled_, anyone's guess is as good as mine.</P>
