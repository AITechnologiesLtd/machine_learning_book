<P>     Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone in the assassination of JFK.  
Water fluoridation isn't designed to protect our teeth, it's a 
government plot to weaken the will and make everyone a slave of the 
State.  One night, all of the Nobel Prize winners were rounded up at gun 
point and forced to make sperm donations.  (What about the women, I 
wonder?)  And, best of all, Oliver Stone isn't really a conspiracy 
theory nut, he's a disinformation junkie working for the mysterious 
"them" (the forces behind covering up all the conspiracies).  These and 
other loopy (and not-so-loopy) ideas make up the background of 
CONSPIRACY THEORY, the fifth teaming of director Richard Donner and 
actor Mel Gibson.  Alas, the movie itself isn't half as interesting as 
some of the one-line theories it mentions then quickly forgets about.</P>
<P>     Originally, CONSPIRACY THEORY was slated to go toe-to-toe with 
Columbia's AIR FORCE ONE, but someone at Warner Brothers blinked.  It's 
probably a good thing, because, against the Harrison Ford action 
vehicle, this film would have gotten buried (it may still get buried, 
even with the release pushed back two weeks).  The storyline for 
CONSPIRACY THEORY is just as moronic as that of AIR FORCE ONE (which is 
saying a lot), but at least Wolfgang Petersen's picture moved.  Donner's 
summer entry is moribund.  It spends well over two hours trying 
unsuccessfully to find a niche.  The result is frustrating, irritating, 
and wearying.  In the end, CONSPIRACY THEORY fails to work as an action 
film, a romance, or a mystery -- all of which it aspires to be. </P>
<P>     It seems to me that the biggest problem with CONSPIRACY THEORY is 
that it can't decide whether to take the well-paved highway (throw Mel 
Gibson into the comfortable role of action hero with Julia Roberts as 
the love interest) or ramble along on some little-used back road (cast 
Gibson against type and throw in a couple of really nasty plot twists).  
This indecision causes the film to veer off course and run into a ditch.  
The plot ends up needlessly convoluted, the characters are hard to get a 
handle on, and the ending is dissatisfying.  Here and there, certain 
elements hold great promise, but, for the most part, they remain 
undeveloped.  And, on the one occasion when the film has an opportunity 
to do something truly daring, it wilts in the face of the challenge.</P>
<P>     Gibson plays Jerry Fletcher, a slightly unstable Manhattan cab 
driver who suffers from paranoid delusions (many viewers will see shades 
of Gibson's LETHAL WEAPON character in Jerry).  He believes almost every 
conspiracy theory concocted by even the least-reputable source, and 
publishes a small newsletter in which he prints his views.  His personal 
life is a wasteland, and he is obsessed by one woman.  Every night, he 
sits outside in his cab and watches Alice Sutton (Julia Roberts), an 
agent of the U.S. Justice Department, as she exercises on her tread 
mill.  Jerry has had a serious crush on Alice ever since he saved her 
from being mugged.  </P>
<P>     Then, one day, Jerry is kidnapped.  He is taken to a dark, dank 
room where his eyes are taped open and a bright light is directed at his 
face.  He is physically and psychologically abused by a smooth, sinister 
"psychiatrist" named Jonas (Patrick Stewart), who wants some 
information.  Apparently, one of Jerry's conspiracy theories has hit a 
little too close to the truth for someone's comfort.  Soon, Jerry is on 
the run, with the FBI, CIA, and other arms of the government on his 
tail.  The only one he can turn to is Alice, who is understandably 
skeptical... until she pays a visit to Jerry's apartment.</P>
<P>     Mel Gibson appears confused about how to play Jerry -- is he a 
hero, an antihero, or something else entirely?  Gibson settles for a 
drugged-out version of THE FUGITIVE's Dr. Richard Kimble.  Jerry's 
increasingly bizarre behavior makes him more and more difficult to 
relate to, even if he is being played by one of the world's most popular 
movie stars.  Meanwhile, Julia Roberts is as bland and ineffective as 
she was in THE PELICAN BRIEF.  Clearly, thrillers do not use the 
actress, who was wonderful in this summer's MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, to 
her best advantage.  In the villain department, it's pleasant to see 
someone given a chance other than Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, 
James Woods, and the other usual suspects.  Patrick Stewart is too good 
an actor to do anything poorly, and his slippery performance here lends 
CONSPIRACY THEORY a badly-needed injection of energy.</P>
<P>     One of the most disappointing aspects of CONSPIRACY THEORY is its 
poor pace.  With films like SUPERMAN, LETHAL WEAPON, and MAVERICK, 
Donner has fashioned a reputation as a director who values clearly-
structured movies.  CONSPIRACY THEORY, on the other hand, is confused 
and disjointed, and the resolution of the story is more than a little 
anticlimactic. Donner never really seems to have things under control.  
So, although there may be some good ideas in CONSPIRACY THEORY, they 
rarely surface.</P>
