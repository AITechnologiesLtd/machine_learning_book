ETERNAL RETURN (L'Eternel Retour) (director: Jean Delannoy;
screenwriter: Jean Cocteau; cinematographer: Roger Hubert; cast:
Madeleine Sologne, Jean Marais, Jean Murat, Yvonne de Bray, Pierre
Pieral, Jane Marken, 1943-FR.)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The influence of Cocteau is felt everywhere in this dreamlike and fluid
film that opens by stating Nietsche's philosophy: that love is recurring
eternally. It is an ill-fated love story about Marais and Sologne, who
fall in love but who have no control over their lives. This is an
updated fable of the Teutonic lovers, Tristan and Isolde.</P>
<P>Because the stars looked so German and blond, it made the film unpopular
in Paris at the time it was shown, which was during the heart of WW11.
It is now considered to be a film classic, outliving the initial
rejection of it.</P>
<P>Murat is the wealthy, middle-aged uncle of Marais, who is lonely in his
castle since his wife died, and has invited Marais and his deceased
wife's obnoxious sister (Yvonne de Bray), and her useless husband, and
evil dwarf son, who is 24-years-old, to live with him. Marais feels
sorry for his kind uncle, and tells him he will go across the country
and bring back a young and beautiful bride for him, so that he won't be
lonely. He brings Sologne back, but finds that he himself has fallen in
love with her.</P>
<P>I did not feel that there was real passion on screen between the lovers,
though I could accept their love intellectually and could understand
that their fate was to die next to each other... But It was the dwarf
(Pieral) who towered over all the others, his malevolent role is a
classic in evil, as he spies on everyone in the castle, manipulates his
possessive and nasty mother, treats his drippy father with disdain, and
taunts Marais.</P>
<P>The film satisfied my aesthetic senses. I thought it had magical
qualities and enough of a brooding atmosphere to make up for my
inability to be won over by Sologne's performance. She was the weak link
in this otherwise forceful film.</P>
