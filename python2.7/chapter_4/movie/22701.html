<P>Susan Granger's review of "NEXT FRIDAY" (New Line Cinema)</P>
<P>        Writer/rapper/actor Ice Cube's Friday was a surprise hit back
in 1995, so it should not come as a shock that there's a sequel, aimed
directly at the same young, hip, urban audience. Along with serving as
producer, Ice Cube reprises his role as Craig, a young man who was
trying to survive on the mean streets of South Central Los
Angeles. Now, he's moved from the city to the suburbs only to discover
that his troubles came right along with him. They're personified by
Debo, played by Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr., a massive bully who wound up
in prison in the original story.  Debo's escaped from the Los Angeles
County Men's Central Jail and wants payback - which is why Craig's
father (John Witherspoon) suggests that he hang out in Rancho
Cucamonga with his Lotto-winning uncle (Don "DC" Curry) and
trophy-wife aunt (Kym E. Whitley), much to the consternation of other
friends, relatives, and Hispanic gangster neighbors. Chris Tucker's
manic character of Craig's pal Smokey has supposedly "gone into rehab"
but, obviously, Tucker's gone on to bigger and better things.  Most of
the vulgar dialogue is unprintable and the crude, chaotic humor
centers on bathroom functions. What could have been an amusing Beverly
Hillbillies riff is ineptly directed by first-timer Steve Carr, whose
background is in disjointed music videos - and it shows. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Next Friday is a coarse, cheesy,
repetitive 3. It's loud, lame slapstick silliness.</P>
