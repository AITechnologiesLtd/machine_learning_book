<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This film is worth seeing for those who want to see what Mick Jagger
looks like when sporting an Abe Lincoln beard. The rock and roller is
asked to carry the film as the action antihero of Australian
legend...Ned Kelly, the so-called Robin Hood of the Aussies. But he
fails to be convincing, in my opinion he is better suited to play Gene
Kelly than Ned Kelly.</P>
<P>The film opens to a b/w prologue of Ned Kelly bravely going to his
execution. Then it goes to Technicolor and Ned is seen in what goes for
flashback, coming home from jail after a 3-year sentence to see his mom
and reacquaint himself with the large Kelly family. This scene is set in
1871. In the background we hear the booming voice of Waylon Jennings, as
he sings Shel Silverstein's lyrics, which tells -- of Ned's hatred for
the British rule and hope for Ireland to be a republic. Ned says a debt
must be paid  ...  as he hears voices from his dead father, his
class-divided country, and his conscience, all telling him to get
revenge. So begins Ned's romp through Australia's outback, seeking
justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered.</P>
<P>He begins by stealing horses, after complaining about the unfair tax law
on horses that stray, which favors the rich landowners. When he's only
20 he forms a gang, causing him to hide the rest of his life from the
police, who put a price on his head of two thousand pounds. When Ned's
mother (Clarissa Kaye) is jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals
and sentenced to 3-5 years, Ned offers to surrender in exchange for his
mother's freedom. When the authorities refuse, the Kelly brothers go on
a robbing rampage, burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults
and murdering some soldiers. Rampaging through the outback, they gather
sympathy among the poor and lower classes, who don't trust the traps
(police).</P>
<P>Spoiler to follow in the next paragraph.</P>
<P>In the climax, Kelly and his gang plan to ambush a train with British
police, but someone Kelly trusted tips the police on the train and Kelly
is trapped in a saloon and captured. Ned's brothers commit suicide
rather than be taken alive. But Kelly's gang escapes, as Ned heroically
has the police go after only him and his brothers, as they become
decoys.</P>
<P>This was a flat presentation, hardly touching an emotional button on
what all the fuss was about over Ned Kelly's call for justice. Jagger
didn't have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by Ian
Jones and Tony Richardson. The story failed to focus on Australia,
seemingly a more British film than Australian. Under Richardson's
lackluster direction, all Jagger seemed to do, was proclaim his
innocence and vow revenge, which soon became a shrill cry. If you want
to see a better film about Ned Kelly, catch "Mad Dog Morgan" (76), a
much truer and more daring version, with Dennis Hopper giving a much
better characterization of Ned Kelly's madness, something this film
could only do in a ho-hum manner.</P>
