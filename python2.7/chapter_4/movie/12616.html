<PRE>STRICTLY BALLROOM
***1/2 OF **** grade is B+</PRE>
<P>Strictly Ballroom is a wonderfully original film disguised as a
traditional, cliched one.  It talks about breaking out of traditions and
creating something new and heartfelt.  The story is basically about a
guy that takes an ugly duckling under his arms and teaches her (in an
incredible short time) how to be as good as him so they can compete, and
show-up the usual opponent.  If you think you've seen that before,
you're right, and you can still see Strictly Ballroom because it doesn't
follow that formula in anyway you've seen before.  </P>
<P>The film starts in a quasi-documentary form showing a spirited ballroom
dancer (Mercurio) trying to dance in the standard ballroom fashion, but
as he is trapped he improvises with crowd-pleasing but judge-annoying
moves.  His partner is hardly able to keep up to his moves and they lose
to a white-haired man who sticks to the traditions.   His partner and
annoying, old-timer dancing mom are frustrated by the loss and the
partner quits to join the white-haired victor.  This is when the
frustrated and flashy dancer meets the ugly duckling (Morce) whom also
has an offbeat style.</P>
<P>Hey have to keep their merging secret because his mother has to see her
son win, and the ugly ducking is a newcomer who has only been dancing
for 2 years.  They practice at night at his parents dance studio and she
is under constant pressure by her domineering father.  More conflicts
arise and they're dancing together is questioned.</P>
<P>Strictly Ballroom is a crowd-pleasing film that will keep you're toes
tapping constantly as you watch and listen to the film.  Even though you
probably know the way the film will end you will have fun getting there
and will be surprised by plot twists in between.  Strictly Ballroom is a
fun film that can be seen by people of all ages.</P>
<PRE>WARNING: You may dance after you see this film so wear comfortable
shoes!</PRE>
