<PRE>WOMAN ON TOP
------------</PRE>
<P>Beautiful Isabella (Penelope Cruz, "All About My Mother") is gifted with
the art of cooking but cursed with severe motion sickness.  Things would
seem perfect when she marries handsome restaurant owner Toninho (Murilo
Benicio), but she ends up holed away in his kitchen while he charms his
patrons outside.  When Toninho's macho need to be on top causes him to
stray, Isabella flees Brazil for San Francisco and her childhood friend
Monica (Harold Perrineau, Jr., "The Best Man").  There she becomes the
star of her own television show, 'Passion Food,' while Toninho tries to
win her back in "Woman On Top."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>"Woman On Top" is a "Like Water for Chocolate" wannabe that isn't.  While
it features cooking as a metaphor for love and has plenty of Latin fantasy
elements it just doesn't have the richness of Arau's film.  And the motion
sickness plot element is just plain weird.</P>
<P>Cruz is gorgeous (in one scene, every man that crosses her path ends up
following her right into her cooking school class) and it's enjoyable 
watching her whip up Brazilian dishes heavy on the chilies, but Isabella
isn't really that interesting of a character.  It's actually more involving
seeing Toninho develop from a careless charmer to a devoted husband
(and Brazilian actor Benicio is quite easy on the eyes, resembling a
Latin version of Russell Crowe).  Harold Perrineau is delightful as
drag queen Monica who revels in dressing up in traditional Brazilian 
costume to serve as Isabella's cooking sidekick, yet he doesn't provide
his character with the appropriate accent.  Mark Feuerstein ("Rules of
Engagement") mostly mugs for the camera as Isabella's producer and new
love interest.  Anne Ramsay ("A League of Their Own") stands out in a tiny 
role as the TV show's director with her witty quips.</P>
<P>The script is the first produced work of Brazilian Vera Blasi, who suffers 
from motion sickness herself (which at least explains, if not excuses, that
element).  The story is told like a fairy tale, yet relies far too heavily
on voiceover narration.  The film was directed by Venezuelan Fina Torres 
("Celestial Clockwork"), so two Latin women have given Spanish star Cruz her 
first English language lead.  </P>
<P>The film pops with color as shot by award winning cinematographer Thierry 
Arbogast ("The Fifth Element"), yet for a film about Brazilian soul, we're 
shown little of the country.  San Francisco is somewhat better represented.  
Lots of traditional Brazilian music is provided, as performed by Murilo 
Benicio while rewooing his wife.  </P>
<P>While this lightweight Penelope Cruz vehicle has its charms it seems to take
forever to reach a forgone conclusion.  "Woman on Top" wafts away like
the aromas seen coming from Isabella's cooking pots.</P>
