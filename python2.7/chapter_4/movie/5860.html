<PRE>                                    KANSAS CITY
                       A film review by Alexander F. Relyea
                        Copyright 1996 Alexander F. Relyea</PRE>
<P>        There are two ways to view Robert Altman's KANSAS CITY.  It can be 
seen as either a politically motivated kidnapping with a jazz backdrop
or a movie about Kansas City jazz in the 1930s with a little local 
color.  This is unfortunate, because neither story is done particularly
well.  Any number of context clues in the film tell the observant 
viewer that KANSAS CITY takes place on the first Monday and Tuesday of 
November, 1933, a month before prohibition was repealed.  Nevertheless,
the alcohol is free-flowing in one of the many historical 
inconsistencies in the film.  The most obvious of these are the fact 
that KANSAS CITY has exactly zero homeless people, and that all of the
"colored" people are very wealthy; even the Western Union custodian
is well-off.</P>
<P>        KANSAS CITY stars Jennifer Jason Leigh (GEORGIA) as Blondie, a
telegraph operator who kidnaps Miranda Richardson (THE CRYING GAME),
the wife of a powerful local politician, in order to convince some
colored gangsters, led by Harry Belafonte (WHITE MAN'S BURDEN), to
release her husband Johnny (Dermot Mulroney, THE TRIGGER EFFECT).  A
nearly incomprehensible sequence of flashbacks helps Blondie explain 
her dilemma to Mrs. Stilton (Richardson).  Apparently Johnny had 
conspired with a cabbie with the unfortunate name of Blue Green (played
by an actor with the even more unfortunate name of Martin Martin) to
rob a rich black gambler.  They get caught, and Blondie goes down to 
Belafonte's club to try to get him back.  She gets turned away and 
goes to kidnap Mrs. Stilton and win Johnny's freedom.  Those who can 
follow this sequence are rewarded with the unfolding of Blondie's 
desperate caper as she drags poor Mrs. Stilton around Kansas City almost
haphazardly.  These images are inter-cut with laughable scenes of
Belafonte trying in vain to act tough and scenes of the twenty-four-hour
jazz band that plays at his club.  The jazz is nice, and it is featured
in about ninety percent of the scenes, either as background music, or 
as the focus of the scene, but it is hardly something to base a movie 
on, and Altman doesn't bother to give any background information that 
would provide a solid foundation.  He doesn't develop the characters of
any of the musicians except for a high school saxophonist who appears 
to have nothing better to do than watch the band in twelve hour 
stretches.  KANSAS CITY plods on with plot twists that tend to be 
inconsequential or too confusing to follow to extend it to its full 
length of a hundred ten minutes, and then has a gutless ending.  When 
one of the characters says "You know what I did today?  I forgot to 
vote.", we can sympathize, for it is hard to remember anything more 
important happening in the film.</P>
<P>        On the whole, the acting was solid.  Mulroney stands out as a small
time hood unable to fully realize that he has entered the big leagues.
Leigh is solid, if a little annoying.  Belafonte does his best, but he
comes across as more of a retired gangster, and is best when he relates 
his old war stories.  He is sadly miscast.  Richardson takes Mrs. 
Stilton's opium habit and plays the stock character of "Drug addict".
Scarcely a scene goes by when she doesn't dope up and stagger.  Surely
a woman this addicted had professional help, even in the Great
Depression.  Other than that, the movie seems to depend on gratuitous
violence and nudity, as well as introducing characters who are almost
completely irrelevant to the plot.  Steve Buscemi (FARGO) is an 
excellent example of this, as in his two scenes he is rough with his 
wife and beating some guy with a baseball bat, both for no apparent 
reason.  Before long, anyone watching KANSAS CITY is going to wish for
something to happen either to return to the jazz or to end the film.
It is curious why Altman calls his film KANSAS CITY since it could
take place in any city large enough to have a jazz club.  There is no
discernible local flavor, and we only know that it is Kansas City
because characters say so.  The screenplay and direction conspire to 
make KANSAS CITY too confusing and remote to cause any feelings towards
any of the characters, and I am not really sure what Altman intended to
do with this film.  Nevertheless, Mulroney and Leigh's performances and
the wonderful soundtrack make this film worth ** out of ****.</P>
