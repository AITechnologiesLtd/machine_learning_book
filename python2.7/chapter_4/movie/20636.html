<P>"The Blair Witch Project" is the most profitable movie in American
history. Made at a cost of $30,000, it returned $48 million in its
first week of wide release. Its huge box-office success, threadbare
production values and offbeat approach to the horror genre have
generated widespread discussion. What does "The Blair Witch Project"
mean for movie-making in general? Furthermore, what does its dark
theme tell us about the mood of the American society, particularly
among the youth who have catapulted it into success?</P>
<P>Before discussing these questions, it would be worthwhile to consider
the film as film. Made by two neophyte directors, 35 year old Daniel
Myrick and 30 year old Eduardo Sanchez, it depicts in self-referential
fashion--but importantly, absent any sense of irony--the making of a
student documentary in the woods of Maryland where according to legend
a homicidal witch dwells.</P>
<P>The student director Heather (Heather Donohue) is accompanied only by
Michael the cameraman (Michael Williams) and soundman Joshua (Joshua
Leonard). With packs on their back, they descend into the forest on
Halloween looking for interesting footage to use in their film, most
particularly a cemetery where victims of the witch are buried--mostly
children. Heather is a compulsive film-maker and takes shots
continuously, including bags of marshmallows in a supermarket where
they have stocked up for the hike, and of a dead mouse on the side of
the trail. The two young men occasionally get annoyed at her, but she
insists that she is serious about her documentary and wants to get in
as much footage as possible. She is in control not only of the
film--perhaps overly so, but of their safety as well. She has a map
that they keep referring to as they make their way deeper and deeper
into the gloomy autumn woods.</P>
<P>Not too long after they have entered the depths of the forest, they
begin to notice spooky piles of stones on the ground and stick figures
hung from the branches of trees. At night in their tent they hear
indistinct cries outside in the distance. Although nobody ever sees
their source, they are continuously on their minds. Heather takes it
all in stride since all of these elements will only help to make her
film more interesting.</P>
<P>The mood of the film changes drastically when it is discovered that
Josh the soundman has thrown the map into a brook as a gesture of
defiance against the overbearing Heather. At first the three head due
south in hopes of running into a settled area, but after a sixteen
hour hike they end up exactly where they started out from. At night,
after pitching their tent, they again hear the eerie cries from within
the forest, which seem closer now.</P>
<P>The three young film-makers eventually succumb to the dark forces of
the forest and the film purports to be based on their footage, which
survived them. An elaborate website (www.blairwitch.com) has been
created to fill in details that were left out of the theatrical
release. But in keeping with the mock documentary spirit of the film,
the website assumes that the events depicted in the film actually took
place.</P>
<P>"The Blair Witch Project" is really not a movie about ghosts, witches
and monsters. It is about insecurity and it is very good at capturing
the genuinely creepy fears that everybody has about being lost in the
woods. It is a noir version of the scene in "The Wizard of Oz" when
Dorothy and her companions are beset by hostile trees in a dark,
haunted forest. In a July 11, 1999 interview with the NY Daily News,
co-director Myrick says, "What [we] were going after was
identifiability. . .Do you identify with the fear? Being lost in the
woods, everyone's felt that."</P>
<P>Working on a shoe-string budget, the directors and cast improvised the
dialog. They also worked in tense conditions not unlike those that the
film's characters found themselves in. A Newsweek article on the film
reports that "Though the actors would pass an occasional jogger, they
began to feel cut off from the safety of the civilized world."</P>
<P>Since the film has captured the imagination of the public despite
lacking all of the accoutrements of blockbuster films--no film track,
no special effects, no stars--many journalists and academics have
looked closely at it to try to figure out what it reflects about
American society.</P>
<P>In an August 31, 1999 NY Times article on "The Blair Witch Project"
and "Sixth Sense", another blockbuster horror movie, Robert Sklar, a
New York University professor on the editorial board of the left-wing
film magazine Cineaste, speculated that its popularity might be driven
by unease about the millennium. People are "spooked by all the things
that are coming up at this time." He added that the horror genre has
always been cyclical, and that its moments of highest popularity have
coincided with moments of extreme social and cultural dislocation.</P>
<P>"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" and "Nosferatu" were popular as silent
films in Europe following the real horrors of World War I and
Hollywood horror films such as "Frankenstein" and "Dracula" made their
mark in the early 1930's, when Americans were struggling with economic
depression. In the 1950's, as Americans were troubled by the atomic
age and the cold war, films like "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and
"The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" depicted alien invaders, giant
bugs and nuclear experiments gone awry.</P>
<P>According to an August 22, 1999 article in the British Independent
newspaper, Todd Boyd, a professor of critical studies at the
University of Southern California's School of Cinema and Television,
believes that new interest in the horror genre is linked to America's
geopolitical climate. When the enemy was more clearly defined, as in
the case of the former Soviet Union, then the monsters in horror
movies could be more clearly and logically. With the collapse of
Communism, he maintains, "You see the US in a bit of disarray in terms
of self-representation ... The evil is not so clear in our
imagination." </P>
<P>Boyd views the crude hand-held camerawork and lack of even rudimentary
set designs as an attempt to control the technology that had been the
province of Hollywood experts. "By having fear 'in our own hands'
rather than waiting for it to be evoked by visual or aural cues, we
reassert some measure of power in an age of cynicism and impotency."</P>
<P>What such commentaries on the film seem to miss, however, is the
importance of the forest in defining the film's attitude toward the
supernatural. The forest, as much as the witch lurking within it, is a
terrifying force, not unlike Moby Dick or Stephen Spielberg's Great
White Shark in "Jaws." This is not the Arcadian ideal depicted in a
Audubon Society calendar, but a hostile and unpredictable entity that
can gobble you up with no warning.</P>
<P>The young film-makers probably did not have this history in mind when
they sat down to write the scenario for "The Blair Witch Project," but
for as long as humanity has considered its environment, the forest has
often appeared as some kind of hostile force that needed to be
subdued. Such fear of the woods had much to do with European hostility
toward the American Indian who seemed not only at home there, but who
felt no need to tame it. It is appropriate, therefore, in such
mythology for a witch to reside in the forest since such a creature
not only represents defiance of civilized Christian values, but a
belief that we are part of nature ourselves.</P>
<P>Engels writes in "The Dialectics of Nature": "Thus at every step we
are reminded that we by no means rule over nature like a conqueror
over a foreign people, like someone standing outside nature -- but
that we, with flesh, blood and brain, belong to nature, and exist in
its midst, and that all our mastery of it consists in the fact that we
have the advantage over all other creatures of being able to learn its
laws and apply them correctly."</P>
<P>While I am writing this review, helicopters and trucks are spraying
Malathion over the five boroughs of New York City in an effort to kill
encephalitis-bearing mosquitoes. While city government officials claim
that the insecticide is "harmless," they urge New Yorkers to remain
indoors while the spraying is in progress. Since the virus was early
in August, mosquito experts around the country have been surprised and
befuddled that St. Louis encephalitis has turned up so far north and
east.</P>
<P>But the environmentalist Rachel's Weekly (www.rachels.org) cites
scientists who attribute northern migration of plants and animals to
global warming. As northern regions become more like the south,
mosquitoes that carry diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue
fever, and encephalitis extend their range, and move to higher
elevations --thus threatening larger human populations with exposure
to serious infectious diseases.</P>
<P>Perhaps the insecurities about the forest in "The Blair Witch Project"
are an unconscious projection of such real-life horrors, bred by a
capitalist system run amok.</P>
