SUPER FEATURES: Beautifully written film.  Luscious all the way, even if
sad.</PRE>
<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>It's hard to fault this film, aside from a few moments here and there where
it appears slow.  But the slow-ness, like Claude Berri's, is not waiting for
something to happen.  It is letting the actors shed their tears, for us to
see.  Which makes for a film, that is as
gut wrenching as the Jean de Florette/Manon of the Spring type of story.
And as sad and tragic as the events in this story are, the  film still comes
up with a bit of hope, even if it is a bit jaded, by  the innocence of a
youthful desire to play, or to follow through on
their own wishes.</P>
<P>It is a story that encompasses almost 200 years in the life of a  family
string.  It starts during one of the many franco/italian  conflicts a young
man in charge of a brigade carrying some gold,  gets attacked in Italy by
the noblemen who take the law in their
own hands. In the process they hurt one of their own daughters.  And the
French officer who is actually resting, helps her.  During  this time they
come to like each other after each other's original  fears.  And apparently
they make love, after her leg wound is cleaned.   Sadly, the young man was
the guardian of a fortune in gold coins,
which is taken away, by the girl's older brother and hidden.  The  young
man, Jean ends up facing a firing squad, and the young girl is  left
pregnant and in despair.  And this is just the beginning.</P>
<P>The story continues, being told to the two Bennedetti children, in today's
environment, as what is probably clear that these are people related in some
way, to the legends.  The man telling the story to his children, is on the
way to visit his own ailing father.  During the drive, the children learn of
this story which has many chapters and goes through nearly 200 years.</P>
<P>And at this point in the film, the outcome is still not clear, but it is
becoming evident that the innocence of youth is always getting scramble
somewhere along the line and in this case a sour old man, may be just the
thing for the playful children, who find out a thing or two in their fun.
They come away, mostly  untouched by the events and the old man's emotional
state, with  the exception that one child managed to get his hands on one
coin of gold, which may signal the continuance of the misfortunes in  the
family, although this particular generation seems to be doing  fine, and the
coin is taken as a souvenir, rather than any act of ill will, as has been
the case before.</P>
<P>With incredible attention to detail and shooting design, this film is a
marvel to watch.  It's hard to fault it for anything, or find anyone that
just seems out of place.  Both directors, brothers, are just a touch above
any others when it comes to attention for detail and story line.  Even the
continuity of this film is smooth despite jumping many years from chapter to
chapter.  A very rare event, indeed for the art of film.  There are bits and
pieces of nice touches here and there that just stand out every so often,
and the subtleties are apparent all the time.  It feels like a story of a
family that is intended to get back to its roots, the common people ( if
there is such a thing!!! ), but it is always stopped before it returns.  And
the acts that stop this return are always tragic, and not always obvious.
We usually find the answers as to why things happened but the characters
mostly do not, and this has caused tremendous pain along the way.  A series
of revenges and returns to what has become a "cursed" family, with a nice
double take on the family's last name in Italian.</P>
<P>An absolutely well photographed film, with not a frame that seems out of
place, and with some subtle shots that just leave your heart moved.
Wonderful story, and told as only an European could.  A sense of history
that Americans have not yet acquired, or acknowledged.</P>
<PRE>Beautiful film.
Truly sad, but so well done.</PRE>
