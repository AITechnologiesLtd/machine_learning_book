<PRE>DIE HARD
A film review by Pete Croatto
filmcritic.com Copyright 2001</PRE>
<P>If I were teaching a film class at a college (a shuddering prospect, I
know), Die Hard would be studied the way Citizen Kane and Potemkin are. 
It's a perfect action movie in every detail, the kind of movie that
makes your summer memorable.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, star Bruce Willis, director John McTiernan and company
couldn't duplicate the heart-pulling thrill of the first one with two
increasingly mediocre sequels.  Die Hard 2 and Die Hard With a Vengeance
suffered because of stuffing thrills and spills in every crevice, to the
point where I expected the Road Runner to make a cameo.  Everyone
involved seemed to forget that simplicity made the original so
riveting.  There's one flawed New York City detective trapped in a
skyscraper with only his wits and some firearms to stop a band of
talented international terrorists.</P>
<P>That cop is John McClane (Willis), who visits Los Angeles at Christmas
time to see his kids and hopefully make amends with his estranged wife,
Holly (Bonnie Bedelia).  When McClane drops in to visit Holly at work,
they get into an argument.</P>
<P>As Holly and McClane make like the Bickersons, the aforementioned group
of kick-ass terrorists led by the ruthless Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman in
a career-making performance) take over the skyscraper.  Gruber's
request:  The building's namesake, Takagi (James Shigata), must hand
over millions of dollars in bonds he has stashed away.</P>
<P>Everyone is accounted for and locked in, except for McClane, who is the
only hope to save his wife and her co-workers.  The phone lines are
dead, terrorists abound like gossipy secretaries, and McClane is
barefoot and alone.</P>
<P>Screenwriters Jeb Stuart (The Fugitive) and Steven E. De Souza
(Commando, one of my favorite Schwarzenegger movies) do a masterful job
in detailing the McClane character, so he doesn't come across as some
robotic one-man wrecking crew.  He crawls through the building's air
conditioning system.  He grabs whatever weapons he can (including a bag
of explosives) and he bleeds. We can root for him.  Minus the killer abs
and the extensive police experience, this guy could be any one of us.</P>
<P>Stuart and DeSouza make McClane additionally human by supplying him with
some of the funniest dialogue in action movie history (Emergency radio
operator:  "Attention, whoever you are, this line is reserved for
emergencies only." McClane:  "No fucking shit, lady?  Do I sound like
I'm ordering a pizza!").  And Willis helps his own cause by giving a
performance that blends comedy, heroism and pathos without preening or
overacting.</P>
<P>And the supporting characters are amazing:  Reginald VelJohnson (before
doing a lengthy stint in TV purgatory with Family Matters) shines as the
L.A. cop who counsels McClane via radio as he plots his next move. 
Rickman is so good here -- he has the perfect combination of charisma
and malice -- that the other main villains in the two sequels (William
Sadler and Jeremy Irons, both good actors) were about as vicious and
threatening as my grandmother.</P>
<P>In all this talk about performance and cinematic theories, you might
think I'm reviewing a Woody Allen film.  But part of Die Hard's appeal
is in its awesome action scenes:  McClane running barefoot through
shattered class, an overly eager terrorist trapping our hero under a
conference room table, McClane jumping from the fiery skyscraper roof,
tethered by a fire hose.</P>
<P>I have a feeling I'll be watching Die Hard sometime again in the near
future, as this summer's crop of action movies don't appear at all
engaging.  They don't seem to offer something for everyone the way Die
Hard does, which gives me all the more reason to start organizing that
film class.</P>
