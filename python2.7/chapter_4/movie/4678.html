<PRE>                        THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS (1987)
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<P>THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS (1987) **1/2 (out of four)</P>
<P>        This movie, the fifteenth in the James Bond series, is one of 
two Bond movies from the 80's to star Timothy Dalton as 007. It's a 
radical departure from the carefree Roger Moore efforts. For starters, 
Dalton is young enough to be Moore's son. How old was Moore in A 
VIEW TO A KILL, about 63? The Bond regulars were all starting to 
show their age in that movie. They might as well have changed Miss 
Moneypenny's name to Miss Menopause. But here, in addition to the 
new Bond, we see a new Moneypenny, played by Caroline Bliss--a 
name worthy of a Bond girl.</P>
<P>        Dalton isn't my favorite Bond (or even my third-favorite), 
ranking just above George Lazenby from ON HER MAJESTY'S 
SECRET SERVICE, but we all know by this point that who played 
Bond wasn't nearly as important as the well-oiled formula itself--the 
chases, explosions, beautiful women, high-tech gadgets, etc. 
Unfortunately, the formula is more or less thrown out the window here 
in favor of the gritty 80's drug story. They might as well have called it 
M VICE.</P>
<P>        Bond in this movie has to find out what happened to KGB 
defector Koskov, who turns out to be a compulsive liar. His girlfriend 
(played by Maryam D'Abo, the sister of the sister from "The Wonder 
Years"), a cellist for the Russian orchestra, thinks she's helping him by 
posing as a sniper, but she ends up being shot at by Bond, who later 
reconciles with her in his usual manner.</P>
<P>        Throw in a naughty milkman/killer ("I'm taking you in for a 
deposit.") and an obsessive military general (played by my first 
semester college roommate) who has a giant war room in his exotic 
mansion showcasing miniature recreations of great battles through 
history and you've got the usual larger-than-life Bond villains without 
the usual Bond formula.</P>
<P>        THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS is more a cold war/drug runner 
80's movie than a genuine Bond movie. It almost works on that level 
except for the fact that it's the slowest-moving Bond picture ever, with 
two climactic battles that aren't that thrilling. Sure, there are a couple 
good chases in the Connery/Moore tradition, including one where 
Dalton and D'Abo are riding a bullet-proof cello sled down a snow-
covered hill, but take away the token appearances by M, Q and 
Moneypenny and it's just another sub-par 80's action movie.</P>
<P>        LICENCE TO KILL, the other Dalton Bond movie, didn't 
resemble the traditional Bond movie, but it at least had a compelling 
plot and some blockbuster action scenes. But when you've got an 
uneven generic movie like this, it might as well be TANGO & CASH.</P>
