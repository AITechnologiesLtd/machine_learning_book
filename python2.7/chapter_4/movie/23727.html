<P>"Scarlet Street" is one of the strangest noir tales ever told on screen,
primarily because it seems rooted in almost something farcical. Here is the
story of a modest cashier who makes a conniving woman believe that he is a
world-famous painter. This could be a comedy but under the hands of German
director Fritz Lang ("Metropolis"), it takes on the existential - showing that
one person's actions can result in a hopeless situation. </P>
<P>Edward G. Robinson plays Chris, a sullen cashier working for an anonymous bank
company. His one joy in life is to paint, a habit not taken seriously by a
single character in the film. One night, after hastily leaving a celebration in
his honor, Chris sees a woman in the street robbed by some guy. The victim is
Kitty (Joan Bennett), a purely electrifying doll, funny yet devious with a
devilish smile. The thief gets away yet Chris is mesmerized by Kitty, taking
her out for a drink (initially coffee, as always with a noir protagonist). He
asks to meet her again, and his love for painting makes Kitty suspect he is a
renown painter with lots of money to spare. Kitty thus uses Chris, and we
discover the thief from earlier is actually her boyfriend, Johnny (Dan Duryea),
whom she passes off as her cousin. Chris sees Johnny as an intrusion, but
nevertheless, he falls hopelessly in love. He is so in love that he steals
money from his bank so he can rent her a luxurious Greenwich Village apartment!
Chris also sees the apartment as a studio where he can paint, away from the
constant squabbling of his unhappy wife, Millie (it is more spacious than the
bathroom he uses in his apartment). But Kitty has other plans - she sees
Chris's paintings as an avenue for success and profit, and so does the
irascible, persistent Johnny. Therein lie the twists. </P>
<P>"Scarlet Street" has lots of comical scenes, mostly provided by Bennett who
does enough double takes and lascivious stares to make her the almost
cartoonish version of Joan Crawford. All her scenes with Robinson are set in
bedrooms or closed-in restaurants, and they are all perfectly flawless, exuding
both humor and tension. Bennett also makes Kitty ambiguous - we are never sure
what to make of her, and her sensuousness and supposed sensitivity reinforce
her two-sided nature. She is out to make a buck anyway she can, but is she as
amoral as Johnny, who goes so far as to sell Chris's paintings himself? </P>
<P>Robinson is at his most restrained and sympathetic, even when his actions
become questionable, we know he will do anything for the love of his life.
Counterbalancing between blindsightedness and naivete, his final act of love
resulting in tragic consequences is a marvel to witness - his pained gestures
show a man slowly coming apart at the seams. This is an extraordinary
performance, almost as good as his similarly repressed protagonist in "Woman in
the Window."</P>
<P>Fritz Lang, who previously directed "Woman in the Window," does wonders with
the film, showing just about every single facet of noir - smoking, shadows in
the night, wrongful murders, accusations, double twists, and an unseen
electrocution. "Scarlet Street" is a terrific film, brimming with humor and
horror in balanced doses. Most significant is Lang's inevitable ending
reinforcing the hopelessness of Chris's situation. Though the ending initially
had problems with the censors, it is justified and shows a degree of punishment
- living with a crime is often more punishing than actual punishment from the
law. </P>
