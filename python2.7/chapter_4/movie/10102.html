 ______________________________________________________</P>
<P>   Few movies transcend high expectations and cross the line between a movie
and
an experience. In 1996, "Breaking the Waves" and "Fargo" rose above any other
features and became experiences. David Cronenberg's "Crash" outstrips any
genre formality and ascends into an unforgettable decaying of urban
civilization that only dreams or nightmares can match its jolts. You may or
may not like it, but it is a complete vision.</P>
<P>    "Crash" has a poetic, nihilistic rythm in its car wrecks and crashes and
it automatically transforms into the rudimentary theme that technology is more
and more dictating on the fate of our lives and the destiny of mankind. The
sadomasochistic pleasure generated by the characters' obsessions with ruptured
metal is the disguise used by Cronenberg this time, who really accomplishes
his most important work to date.</P>
<P>     Based on J.G Ballard's 1973 novel,  "Crash"  tells the incommode life of
director James Ballard ( James Spader ) after a horrible car crash, which
kills th husband of Dr. Helen Remington ( Holly Hunter ). The two wind up in
the same hospital and puzzingly become erotically charged by an unexplainable
attraction that's linking them: the car crash. Soon, they have sex in cars,
are turned on by crash dummies footage and their sexual force is so colossal
they plant their on car wrecks. Joining them in this almost surreal journey is
Cronenberg's most memorable character to date, Vaughan ( Elias Koteas ) who
worships all sorts of bloody crashes and the re-shaping of the human body
through wounds and scars. He even keeps a portfolio with gruesome pictures of
devastated people right after accidents. Gradually, Ballard and his wife
Catherine ( Deborah Kara Unger )  become involved in this disproportionate
world of pleasure, domination and survival. </P>
<P>    Cronenberg's past work consisted of artsy-fartsy duds which were coated by
hisscience-fictional, unexquisite grotesqueries , but in "Crash" Cronenberg
concocts a revolutionary modification of the concept man vs technology, in a
deadly collision course that demonstrates the evolution of an artist when
presented with a pragmatic theory about the future. He has cleverly fumigated
these characters from social exposition and confronting our senses with a
group of people and not an entire society, because in a morbid manner, they
are representing th aberration of our world which will not be the same, no
matter what. The honesty of the protagonists is not a facade of vague
personification but a crude reality of how to understand the future ahead of
us, beacuse in "Crash" even at the most explicit, shifting sex traingles there
is no major conflict the characters are face with. The conflict is humans
approaching a new era.</P>
<P>    It can also be said  "Crash" contains human beings devoid of background,
personalities or opinions but just like Kubrick's "2001" and Ridley Scott's
"Blade Runner,"  "Crash" symbolizes a mechanical community in a fight with
themselves , their own progressing minds which in essence, are auto-
destructing us. Machines take over man.</P>
<P>     The sex is unlike any other we have recently seen, conducted mostly in
cars, dangerously erotic and brilliantly executed, devoid of any feelings, and
there is no moment in "Crash" where the sex is juxtapositioned away from the
unexplained phenomenon of getting turned on by metal.  When James and Helen
forst glance at each other after the deadly accident, it marks the beginning
of a civilized, urban post apocalyptic phantasmagoria vitalized by  adrenaline
rushing moments.  </P>
<P>   The people are brave to face their wicked temptations which at first, seem
unexplicable, and when Vaughan is introduced their pleasure is given another
cryptic element :can technology change the shape of humans ? can technology
abolish the evolution of men ?. Vaughan is a man with ideas and they are all
experiencing this vacuum of studies and  questions with a desire to sexually
benefit from these arguments as well as exploring new scientific grounds.</P>
<P>    Disguising a universal theme with crude sex is not only appropiate, it is
necessary. "Crash" unabashedly emphasizes that relationships, love and
cherishing for other human beings are missing in today's microchip age, and
again drawing a comparison to "Blade Runner" its proclaiming a bleak, lifeless
unfolding world ahead of us. "Crash" is set in the present, it doesn't rely on
astonishing sets, art direction or extravagant effects, its heart lies on the
thematic components, the direction, the coldness and the coldness of the
actors.</P>
<P>     The ensemble cast is excellent , Spader, whose expresionless face is
letter-perfect for the character and adds to the gloomy tone , but Elias
Koteas is deliciously malignant as the morbid Vaughan . You may remeber him
from " Exotica " , but his prescence here adds an eccentric effect, as if this
sick man is really onto something.</P>
<P>     J. G Ballard wrote "Crash"  in the early 70's , but twenty four years
later it is the quintissential " controversy " movie. Division towards the
film will certainly have very wide divisions: either one is captivated or is
tremendously aggravated. Ted Turner, President of Fine Line Pictures has
criticised "Crash" for being preposterous, as well as some top critics. The
combo of flesh and metal may have gotten to them, but with sumptous orgasm-
fests it was deservedly rewarded an NC-17 rating. I suppose these people were
turned off by the constant sadomasochism.</P>
<P>     Time is the only response as to wether "Crash" will rank among "
Metropolis", "Runner" and "A Clockwork Orange" in their dedication to express
the deterioration of mankind. It relentelssly out-smarts a ridiculous road it
could have taken, and by amplifying a fragment of a concept, the destruction
that lies ahead of us. Thanks to J.G Ballard , David Cronenberg has finally
given us a dazzling piece of filmmaking to discuss and share our opinions.</P>
