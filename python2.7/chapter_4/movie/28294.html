<PRE>"The Trumpet of the Swan"</PRE>
<P>A mute little swan named Louie just wants a voice of his own. His
well-meaning dad steals a trumpet, and wreaks havoc in the music store, to
help his son. But Louie seeks the help of a young boy, Sammy, to learn to
read and write so he can communicate with his swan friends. Still, even
after all of his hard work, no one understands him and Louie takes up the
stolen trumpet to try and find his voice. He uses his musical gift to
redeem his father and repay his debt in "The Trumpet of the Swan."</P>
<P>This is Saturday morning TV fare, at best, that should not subject the
viewer with the expense and hassle of seeing it at the theater. Because of
its Boston locales, especially the Public Garden, "The Trumpet of the Swan"
is released theatrically in this regional. But, parents, be forewarned that
you should wait for the video release which will happen very soon. This is
the type of movie used as a baby-sitter for the age 3 to 6 age demographic
it is so obviously aimed at. The simple story of the handicapped Louie
using his God-given gifts to overcome his disabilities (and get the
girl-swan, Serena, too) is full of good, easy to understand moral messages
suitable for young kids.</P>
<P>The importance of learning to read and write, overcoming disability,
finding your own voice, honor, family love, and more lessons of life are
dealt out in simple ways that won't be lost on young kids. Lots of pastel
colors and perky little songs are used to accompany the short attention
span episodes of Louie's adventures. He also gets the help of a little
beatnik squirrel who uses the "Internut" to communicate and teaches Louie
to play his trumpet from the heart. There are a bunch of other
cookie-cutter characters, but there's not much substance to any of them.</P>
<P>It's not that "The Trumpet of the Swan" is a bad movie, it's just not a
good one. Kid's movies don't have to be bland. Just look at a film like
"The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland" for intelligence and wit in kids'
entertainment. The stellar vocal cast - including Carol Burnett, Jason
Alexander and Mary Steenbergen - is far too potent for the material and can
only be another reason to try and capitalize on a theatrical run.</P>
<P>The television feel, flat production and bland characters of "The Trumpet
of the Swan" should relegate it to the small screen pretty quickly, so
don't waste your heard-earned cash taking the kids to see it at a matinee.
I give it a C-.</P>
