<P>Successful follow-up to the ever-popular SCREAM (8/10) which
regenerated the horror genre back in 1996, and has since parlayed the
genre into a couple of lame copycats, and one other neat success with
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (7.5/10). </P>
<P>PLOT:
Sidney finds herself in college two years after all of the murders
went down in Woodsboro back in the original SCREAM. A movie called
"Stab", based on the events of the small town, as written in the book
by Gale Weathers, has also just come out, and sparked what appears to
be a "copycat killer" on the campus grounds. Who can this wacky person 
be? Scary stuff ensues.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Some thrills. Some chills. But overall, just a basic scary movie that
does little to improve on the elements tiled down in the first, and
more effective, SCREAM. Ironically, one running theme in this film is
how movie sequels generally don't surpass their originals in regards
to quality, and SCREAM 2 is a perfect example of that well-founded
theory. Mind you, this is not a bad film by any stretch of the
imagination (some pretty neat murders, and another pretty decent "who
donnit?" premise), but it just doesn't live up to the first. </P>
<P>Having said that, I think that this statement has less to do with the
actual content and quality of this picture, and more with the
sensitized nature of its audience during this second time a go-go. I
guess we all just need something a little more spectacular to impress
us, now that this genre is back "in" again (And while the addition of
every other Joe and Mary "young, hip Hollywood" actor might bring in
some box-office bucks for the first and second weeks of release, it
sure does little to impress us once they (on the most part) waste
their jolly time on the big screen.) </P>
<P>The acting was fair in this picture, but I saw the Campbell character
as a little too nerve-wrecked for my taste. The film references by
writer Williamson were extremely well-sprinkled, and enjoyed mucho by
yours truly (For the record, I definitely agree with the man's theory
about ALIENS (8/10) being a much better film than its predecessor,
ALIEN (7/10)). Also, I liked the fact that most of the African-American
characters in this film seemed to be much wiser to the whole carnage
scenario, as opposed to most Hollywood pictures, in which there
always seems to be a convenient "murder seat" reserved for the token
black characters. The cameraman in this movie was especially funny and
enjoyable.</P>
<P>Another thing that really didn't compare to the first movie was its
ending. I was thoroughly surprised and amazed by the ending of the
original SCREAM, as opposed to this one, which just left me kind of
shrugging my shoulders in indifference. Also, even though I am
reviewing this movie as a person who has already seen and thoroughly
enjoyed the first movie, I thought it might be harder for those
non-original SCREAM viewers, to fully comprehend the many references
to the first film. Oh well. 'Tis life in the big city, I suppose.
Overall, I guess this flic is a good scary movie for a long, dark,
lonely old night with your loved-nacho by your side. But for your
complete enjoyment faculties to truly savour all the delicacies in this
decent spook-fest, I suggest you rent the original before popping this
pepper into your VCR, and then of course... don't forget to scream !!!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
SCREAM AGAIN and SCREAM LOUDER were two titles that were also
considered for this sequel's title.
Neve Campbell won the 1997 MTV Movie Award for Best Female
Performance for her role in this film.
Jerry O'Connell played the fat kid in STAND BY ME (7.5/10), who
majorly puked over the audience during a pie-eating contest. After that
movie, Jerry went back to school, and did not become a full-time actor
until he graduated from NYU with a degree in film and television.<HR>Visit JoBlo's Movie Emporium
