<P>"I didn't know crocodiles could swim across oceans!"
"Of course not! That information is concealed in books!"</P>
<P>Starring Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt, Brendan Gleeson,
Betty White. Rated R.</P>
<P>I believe it was Wes Craven who first had the brilliant idea to combine
horror and comedy with A Nightmare on Elm Street back in 1984. The
obligatory gruesome killer no longer had to glumly and wordlessly chase
his victims. Craven's butt-ugly and imposingly menacing Freddy Krueger
didn't just turn unlucky teenagers into a bloody pulp, the bastard
spewed wisecracks as well.</P>
<P>Since then, the horror-comedy genre has become quite popular, with its
most notable success being the glorious Scream series: two (so far)
witty, scary and nearly parodic slasher films that have built a
remarkable fan base. So it's only fitting and, quite frankly,
inevitable, that Hollywood's best and brightest wind up experimenting
with this lucrative hybrid. David E. Kelley, the writer and creator of
such tv smash hits as Ally McBeal and The Practice takes a stab at it as
the screenwriter of Lake Placid, a snappy (no pun intended) and witty
but not scary variation on Jaws.</P>
<P>Delivering one-liners is an artform and few do it with more panache then
Oliver Platt, one of the stars in this flamboyant creature-feature about
a gigantic crocodile that preys on those unfortunate enough to boat or
dive in Lake Placid, Maine. Investigating the vicious reptile are a slow
but lovable small-town sheriff (Brendan Gleeson), a cocky official from
Fish and Game (Bill Pullman), a pretty lady from the New York Museum of
Natural History (Bridget Fonda) and a filthy rich eccentric who worships
crocodiles (Platt). The four of them seem to bite off more than they can
chew when they get up close and personal with the crocodile in order to
learn more about how it got all the way to Maine.</P>
<P>When it is clear that they are dealing with a very dangerous and an even
more aggressive animal, the characters wage a cinematically familiar
battle: do they kill the thing or do they try to trap it? The latter
choice is clearly more humane and is preferred by the museum gal and the
croc-worshipper while the other two characters would rather take the
more sure-fire approach. It's a shame that instead of making a choice
writer Kelley and director Steve Miner manage to have their cake and eat
it too with a throwaway, ludicrous plot twist.</P>
<P>At its best, Lake Placid is enjoyable nonsense. It has some wonderful
lines ("Had any bear attacks recently?" "Bears don't attack people
underwater." "Probably a beaver then.") and has some fun with its
crocodile premise, but it's inconceivable to brand the movie as "good".
The main problem, as I see it, is that while the wisecracks that the
characters lambast each other with are admittedly funny, the plot itself
takes a back seat to them. The film moves from one sarcastic one-liner
to the next with no consideration for its pacing or its storyline.</P>
<P>To the film's credit, the crocodiles look good (although I wish we'd
seen some beavers) and we do see some nifty shots of heads being bitten
off and severed toes lying on the ground. Then again with state of the
art technology at every clown's fingertips seamless special effects tend
to no longer come as a surprise (although I must admit I was taken aback
by the caliber of what I saw in What Dreams May Come). That's very
unfortunate because for the avid moviegoer, films that inspire a genuine
feeling of awe and amazement like Jurassic Park did when it was first
released are becoming increasingly difficult to come by.</P>
<P>I really liked Brendan Gleeson as the sheriff: he is funny, refreshingly
self-deprecating and a hell of a lot of fun to watch. I similarly
enjoyed Oliver Platt who took a break from being exclusively a character
actor (and he's a terrific character actor too) to star in a movie
that's trashy fun and give a performance that fits the same description.
On the other hand Bridget Fonda and Bill Pullman constantly come off as
either annoying or flat and I was surprised to see such inept
performances from such accomplished thespians.</P>
<P>There's nothing wrong with enjoying a movie like this as long as you
don't heap any undue praise onto it. It's not a cinematic
accomplishment. It's not a great film or even a good one. It can,
however, be fun: if one is in the mood for a campy monster movie rather
than, say, a moving character study.
