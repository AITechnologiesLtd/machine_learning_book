<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 stars</P>
<P>With a credit list that is sure to raise some eyebrows, The Faculty
boasts two of the best names in the horror industry, director Robert
Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn, Desperado) and screenwriter Kevin
Williamson (Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer).</P>
<P>Sure enough, the screenplay boasts Williamson's entertaining
90's-culture dialogue as well as some likeable characters - who
collectively bear a radical resemblance to the characters from The
Breakfast Club - but at times is severely let down by Rodriguez's
direction.  His usual electric pacing is somewhat lacking, as is his
keen sense of the absurd.  His direction is certainly not without its
merits - many of them attributed to atmosphere, others the clever
structure of scenes that reflect older styles of horror filmmaking mixed
with props and surroundings from a very modern era - that create a sort
of Invasion of the Body Snatchers for the Mortal Kombat age.</P>
<P>One perfectly satirical touch comes curtsey of Williamson, who
ingeniously gives the heroes of the story - school kids battling their
teachers, whose bodies have been taken over by aliens - only one kind of
weapon that they can effectively fight with: home made speed.  In an
irony that is both whimsical fun and tongue-in-cheek cynicism, a
life-threatening, deadly, don't-touch-it-for-the-life-of-you substance
is now saving the human race from oblivion.  Which, I thought, was kinda
cool, although Rodriguez's finished product is not a film that will be
remembered in ten, or even five years time.  In his attempts to once
again re-create the horror genre - after the mammoth commercial and
artistic success of From Dusk Till Dawn - Rodriguez has created an
enjoyable, not-to-be-taken-seriously piece that entertains well,
although sometimes doesn't quite cut it (no pun intended).</P>
