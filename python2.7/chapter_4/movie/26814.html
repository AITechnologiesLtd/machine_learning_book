<P>Soon after attending a Freaky Film Festival, by a freaky coincidence 
I saw "The Girl on the Bridge." In many ways, this superb, 
fascinating, strange, original  feature was a kind of apotheosis of 
freakishness.</P>
<P>Its director is the so-imaginative Patrice Leconte whose best movies 
include "Monsieur Hire," a wonderful remake of the classic "Panique" 
(1946); the very offbeat love story "The Hairdresser's Husband"; and 
the splendidly sharp and witty "Ridicule," set among aristocrats of 
the court of  Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette.</P>
<P>Leconte's films are original, clever in scenarios, dialogues and 
performances, with superior cinematography and often colorful 
settings. "The Girl" is all that but now the glorious colors have 
been replaced by glorious black-and-white which aids our 
concentration and gives the film a "classic movie" feel.</P>
<P>It entertains in quirky, funny and sexy ways --all beyond easy 
description. It stars the great Daniel Auteuil and very popular 
singer-actress Vanessa Paradis, </P>
<P>The picture is constructed like a succession of small puzzles which, 
however, impede neither comprehension nor appreciatioon. Opening on 
a soundtrack of Algerian music is the sequence of Adele, all in 
closeups. She is pretty, about 23, gap-toothed (a Gallic Lauren 
Hutton?) She talks and talks about her sad lot, her string of sexual 
and sentimental failures in male retlationships. It is an odd kind 
of self-analysis, self-criticism and confession. Whom is she 
addressing? A jury? A group of shrinks? She is very much a woman, 
but also strangely childish.</P>
<P>Cinephiles may be reminded of the sequence in  Truffaut's "The 400 
Blows" where the boy Antoine Doinel replies to questions by a 
reformatory's psychologist. Her declarations, paradoxical and often 
quietly funny also bring to mind Jean-Luc Godard's style.</P>
<P>We next meet her in night and fog, on a bridge of the river Seine in 
Paris. She intends to jump to her death. But Gabor appears, talks, 
mocks, argues, and finally fishes her out of the murky waters. He 
rescues her because he needs a new partner, meaning a target for his 
skills as a knife thrower. </P>
<P>The two become a couple of performers, but not an item. Gabor takes 
her to a posh circus in Monaco where they do their number, The Wheel 
of Death.  She is tied to a rotating wheel. He throws his blades at 
her, It is terrifying yet also, after a fashion, humorous. We are 
asked (but not pressured) to believe that between Adele and  Gabor 
and the knives, there's a kind of mental tele-guidance. He does nick 
her more than once however, and his box of band-aids becomes a funny 
prop. And there's additional mind-power as Gabor -- who will not 
gamble-- has Adele do it and win stacks of money.</P>
<P>The film develops as a strange kind of road-movie which takes the 
duo to Italy, to a cruise ship going to Greece and Turkey, to a 
fanciful, amusing separation of the two. This grows into longing. 
Mind you, there is neither sex nor verbal love-making between the 
man and the girl. Adele is sex-obsessed -- a kind of  nymphomaniac. 
She attaches herself sexually, instantly and serially to man after 
man, consummates sex in comical or farcical scenes (including one 
with a contortionist) but does not  fall in love. Gabor reprimands 
her (when he doesn't shrug his shoulders,) yet keeps his cool --as 
she does hers.</P>
<P>Of course, the movie would be inhumane if Gabor were not gradually 
falling in love. But the film is humane, like those it may remind 
you of partly-- such as Fellini's "La Strada," but without its 
pessimism and grunge. Not to mention Felliniesque music. (The movie 
has an outstanding, rich musical commentary   from much Italian to 
Benny Goodman,  Mariane Faitfull, Hispanic, Turkish, and other 
sounds.)</P>
<P>On board the cruise ship, Adele's latest instant fling is with 
Takis, a chic Greek newlywed whose rationale to Gabor about his 
"blitz" affair with Adele is: "My wife is Italian. We don't 
understand each other.."</P>
<P>Such delectable absurdisms populate the movie. There is even a 
section where Takis and Adele leave the ship and their partners in 
mid-Mediterranean, by escaping in a lifeboat. The sequence seems to 
upend  James Bond who, at the conclusion of many 007 flicks finds 
himself  on a small boat--with a gorgeous female.</P>
<P>Non sequiturs,  frequent metaphors for sex, bits of fetishism, 
surreal sights and sites, symbolism, run rife. Yet they always fit 
the characters, the action, the sets while they are not pretentious, 
sophomoric, pleasd with themselves or irritating.  </P>
<P>This is a devilishly smart and smartly played movie. But I doubt 
that its direction, performances and paraphernalia could exist 
without the splendid script by Serge Frydman who had earlier twice 
collaborated with Leconte.</P>
