<P>During a Los Angeles press junket last May, a group of reporters, in town 
to cover another movie, were invited to a late evening screening of "The 
Iron Giant." By the time we were herded into the theater, most of us were 
tired and less than enthusiastic at the prospect of sitting through a 
feature-length cartoon. But 87 minutes later, as the end credits began 
scrolling up the screen, we broke into a warm round of applause and spent 
the ride back to the hotel happily jabbering like little kids. Since 
returning home, I've seen the movie two more times.</P>
<P>Films of this caliber don't come along very often. With a smart script, 
expressive characters and a skillful mix of humor and sentiment, "The 
Iron Giant" offers as many pleasures for adults as it does for children. 
Here's another treat: unlike traditional Disney-style cartoons, the 
feature has no wacky sidekicks or musical numbers. Hallelujah!</P>
<P>Inspired by British Poet Laureate Ted Hughes' book, "The Iron Giant" is 
set in 1957 America, during the height of Cold War paranoia. When a local 
fisherman enters a diner in picturesque Rockwell, Maine, blathering about 
a giant metal creature that came crashing out of the sky, no one believes 
him. No one except feisty 9-year old Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marienthal), the 
only child of single mother Annie (Jennifer Aniston), who works in the 
eatery.</P>
<P>That night, Hogarth goes exploring in the deep woods and encounters a 50-
foot tall robot (Vin Diesel) attempting to eat the town's power plant. 
When the massive creature bites into a transformer and gets zapped, 
Hogarth comes to the rescue and a friendship is forged. Following the 
crash and the near-fatal electric sandwich, the giant has lost his memory,
 so Hogarth begins to teach the powerful behemoth the ways of his new 
world. </P>
<P>Fearful of how others would react to the robot, Hogarth seeks the 
assistance of beatnik sculptor/junkyard owner Dean McCoppin (Harry 
Connick Jr.) in hiding the mechanical being. Matters grow more 
complicated with the arrival of Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald), a 
smarmy, suspicious and very determined government agent investigating the 
situation. Then, during a play session with a toy ray gun, Hogarth learns 
that the giant might not be as gentle as he thought. </P>
<P>Writer and director Brad Bird ("The Simpsons," "King of the Hill") says 
he changed the time period of the story to the '50s because "America was 
at a crossroads. We were learning to live with the atom bomb; the space 
race was just beginning; paranoia was at a high; and all of this got into 
the movies of the time... giant ants and mutated Martian men. That's a 
pretty funny response to all of those influences. So if you're going to 
have a story about a human boy who befriends a metal man, it's fitting to 
put it into the context of the fear that existed at the time."</P>
<P>Good thinking. A great part of "The Iron Giant's" charm comes from the 
retro drawing style and well-placed period details. Hogarth watches 
cheesy monster movies on his black and white TV, schoolchildren are 
subjected to ludicrously cheerful "duck and cover" films in the classroom 
and newspapers echo the sentiments of the era with headlines that scream 
"DISASTER SEEN AS CATASTROPHE LOOMS." Worries about the ever-present "Red 
Menace" are echoed in everything from comic books to the film's palette - 
- note the color change when a key object shifts to weapons-mode.</P>
<P>Michael Kamen deserves praise for his witty and stirring score, and for 
selecting evocative music without resorting to the same tired golden-
oldies employed in so many other period films.  </P>
<P>The look of the robot also fits the '50s setting. With a dome-shaped head,
 eyes that resemble searchlights, an angular jaw and massive body plates 
held together by an elaborate array of nuts, bolts and gears, he is 
simply the coolest robot ever. The filmmakers do a fine job making the 
giant seem simultaneously childlike and awe-inspiring. They also adroitly 
mix sound effects and visuals to give us a palpable sense of the 
incredible weight and bulk of the creature. </P>
<P>For a film as simply drawn as "The Iron Giant," the key characters' faces 
are remarkably expressive, particularly those of Hogarth and his beatnik 
buddy Dean. Between Hogarth's chipped front tooth and exasperated eye 
rolling and Dean's wry glances from his lowered sunglasses, the two are 
more believable than most flesh and blood performers. Voicing the pair, 
Eli Marienthal and Harry Connick Jr. hit all the right notes to complete 
the illusion.</P>
<P>Due to the story structure, Annie is relegated to the background, which 
is a shame because Jennifer Aniston gives the character real vitality. I 
also regretted seeing only lily white faces in Rockwell. For a movie as 
thoughtful and humane as this, the lack of ethnic diversity was 
disappointing.</P>
<P>Thankfully, those were about the only disappointing aspects of the film. 
The production shines because the creative team made sure they had a rich,
 emotionally satisfying story to match their drawings. With lots of 
laughs, a dandy message, a strong sense of wonder and sentimentality that 
never becomes cloying, "The Iron Giant" is a classic. Get ready to feel 
like a kid again.</P>
