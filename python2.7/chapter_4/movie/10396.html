<P>Shakespeare's plays are some of the hardest to follow for us here in modern
times. With odd, lengthy character names, a busy hustling of events, and
loquacious dialogue spoken swiftly and fluently in thick English accents, us
Americans generally ain't got no clue what's going on. That's what makes the
actors (or players to sound more authentic) so very important whenever a
Shakespearean production is presented, whether it be for the big screen, the
small screen, or the stage. It is up to them to convey to us what they're
saying and feeling, and a good actor can make the most complex character easy
to understand and follow.</P>
<P>Sadly, TWELFTH NIGHT: OR WHAT YOU WILL is one of the poorer examples of such.
This is one of the hardest to follow Shakespeare adaptions of recent memory,
but I do admire anyone who attempts to tackle such a feat, and the effort here
is credible even if the overall result needs a bit of a tune up. An otherwise
mediocre film, TWELFTH NIGHT is saved by a few, *very* few, commendable
touches, particularly Helena Bonham Carter who stars as the Countess Olivia.
Olivia has recently suffered the death of a brother, and is using the tragedy
to ignore the repeated efforts of Duke Orsino (Toby Stephens) to swoon her.
Orsino has enlisted the aid of Cesario (Imogen Stubbs) to assist him in his
efforts by sending the young man to profess of the Duke's love. As common
Shakespeare would always have it, however, nobody loves who they're "supposed"
to, and Olivia ends up falling for the messenger instead. There's just one
catch . . .</P>
<P>Cesario is in reality a young *woman* named Viola who washed to shore after a
terrible storm wrecked the ship she was traveling on with her almost identical
brother, Sebastian (Steven Mackintosh). Both survived and drifted to different
shores, but both assumed the other to be dead. With nothing left, Viola took
the disguise of a young man and became a servant to the Duke, a man she would
come to love without revelation due to her male semblance.</P>
<P>Also coming into play is a barrage of comic relief characters who flail about
to our amusement in yet another typical attribute of any Shakespearean comedy.
This time around, they consist of Olivia's steward Malvolio (Nigel Hawthorne),
Olivia's drunken uncle, Sir Toby Belch (Mel Smith) and waiting gentlewoman
Maria (Imelda Staunton), and Orisno's jester of sorts, Feste (Ben Kingsley).
While these characters are meant to lighten up the film, they are quite
dizzying and confusing, and although they do play somewhat of an important
role in the overall story, the focus on them may have been a bit excessive.</P>
<P>It is by far Carter who shines and lures you into the story, but unfortunately
she is the one whose character is used less than we'd like, proving a bit
ironic when she is such an important element in the story. Stubbs is almost
annoying, but handles her transvestite role well enough to satisfy, and it's
true that her scenes with Carter are some of the best the movie has to offer.
It is these scenes that make the film worth watching, even if it means wading
thru the boringly hectic scenes carried by the more mundane cast of actors.</P>
<P>It is crucial to note that the time frame of this story has been moved up to
the 19th century, which leaves no need for adaption from Carter, who has spent
a great amount of screen time reveling in both Shakespearean films and period
pieces set in the 1800's (think 1990's HAMLET and HOWARDS END as well as the
current WINGS OF THE DOVE). Shakespeare being set in futuristic (as far as the
time they were written is concerned) settings seems to be the latest trend,
with a present day ROMEO + JULIET and a RICHARD III set in the 1930's being
recent examples. It's a bit off-kilter when they rely heavily on the original
dialogue, such as with this film and ROMEO + JULIET, but it's also an
interesting transposition of the classics that make it interesting to watch.
In fact, this is one to be seen simply for the fact that it's Shakespeare if
for nothing else.</P>
<P>Shakespeare movies definitely require the right audience. He is definitely not
everybody's taste. This adaption of TWELFTH NIGHT is perhaps a bit too
sophomoric for loyal enthusiasts, and yet too luxurious for those better
suited with a high-caliber action flick. Finding the right middle ground will
be a definite chore as this one doesn't hold the class of such "elegant
comedies" as EMMA, and yet doesn't resemble silly farces that best accompany a
pajama party. What that means is that this film will likely dwindle away in
mediocrity, but if it's any consultation, not too much will be lost.</P>
