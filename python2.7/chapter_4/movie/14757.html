<PRE>                     THE CRUISE (United States)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: Black and white documentary about Timothy Speed Levitch,
free soul and tour guide on the Gray Line.  This is a 76-minute
portrait of a very strange person, advocate of the existential "The
Cruise" and enemy of the Anti-Cruise. Levitch seems to have strong
opinions about nearly everything.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to
+4)</P>
<P>   - Bennett Miller directs and edits footage a film about Timothy
     Levitch, a $200/week tour guide from New York City who is a
     genuine original.
   - Levitch talks in similes, opaque metaphors, literary references,
     and just plain strange comments.
   - Levitch seems incredibly overqualified for his job on occasion.
   - Other times he seems little more coherent than some of the
     homeless.
   - Recently Levitch was certain that the city was angry at him for
     some wrong it imagined he committed.  Manhattan has now forgiven
     him, also for no obvious reason.  He sees this anger in the
     shortness of the lower buildings.
   - His customers on the Gray Line are flooded with literary allusions
     and quotes.
   - Levitch sees the grid street plan of Manhattan as being stifling.
   - He took great offense when someone told him, "Everybody likes the
     grid plan."  He also took great offense when the Gray Line told
     him he had to wear a red T-shirt as part of his uniform.  These
     restrictions are part of the "anti-cruise" and he is "in love with
     the frantic chaos of the limitless universe."
   - His favorite diversions include going to the plaza between the
     World Trade Center towers, spinning himself dizzy, then lying on
     his back and looking up at the towers.</P>
