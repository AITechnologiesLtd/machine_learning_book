<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Of all the notable actors who have portrayed Satan in the last decade or so,
among them Jack Nicholson in 'The Witches of Eastwick' (1987) and Robert
DeNiro in 'Angel Heart' (1987), none have captured the charismatic style
quite like Al Pacino has in 'The Devil's Advocate'.  The latest film from
director Taylor Hackford ('Dolores Claiborne', 'An Officer and a Gentleman',
'Against All Odds') uses conscience as a metaphor to tell an old fashioned
morality tale that avoids using cliches to transmit its dreamy message of
morality.  It uses each scene as a carefully thought out stepping stone to
reveal its real intentions late in its running time of 141 minutes.  Not
always on target but never boring, the audience is given clues to the film's
resolution in leading up to its chilling climax enhanced with some of the
most mind twisting visuals seen on film this year.</P>
<P>Keanu Reeves is a young, ambitious and talented defense attorney in Florida
who has never lost in over 60 cases he's been associated with and upon
representing one client whom everyone believes will be convicted, Reeves gets
him off and meets a representative from a New York City law firm who has been
scouting his talents and persuades him to travel to Manhattan with all
expenses paid to meet the firm's mentor (Pacino) in an attempt to obtain his
services.  Reeves agrees and along with his wife (Charlize Theron), they are
introduced to a world which seems alien to them but the goodies seem to
attractive to resist.  As the film progresses there is a feeling that
something is not quite right in their lives and the wife wants to leave.
 Reeves tells her that his career is going well and that leaving is out of
the question.</P>
<P>The first thing that should be said about this film is noting the progression
of Keanu Reeves as an actor of some merit.  Although his southern accent is
sometimes used inconsistantly in the movie, he holds his own for the most
part with any other actor in the picture and is totally convincing as a fiery
lawyer.  He is the reason the courtroom sequences in the film are so
pleasantly executed and director Taylor Hackford has extracted a complex and
multi dimensional performance from Reeves.  As for Pacino, what can you say
about an actor who has triumphed at every role he's ever played.  Even in his
films that have bombed in both a critical and financial manner, Pacino always
burns up the screen with his authoritative manner and disciplined command of
character.  Portraying Satan is another triumph for Pacino who delivers a sly
and slightly over the top performance.</P>
<P>If you are turned off by movies which deal heavily in explicit and
supernatural gore and violence and are offended by openly sexual scenes and
nudity then 'The Devil's Advocate' should be avoided because the film is
shockingly explicit on all of these counts but for others it will scorch your
senses with an original twist but it has an ending which may leave you cold
and unconvinced but it's still a good ride most of the way.</P>
