<P>Painter-sculptor Julian Schnabel entered filmmaking with "Basquiat" 
(1996), about the graffiti street artist who briefly rose to fame. 
"Before Night Falls," Schnabel's second feature, centers on Cuban 
writer Reinaldo Arenas who is not a household name in North America. 
To what extent he is or was famous  in Cuba, a small nation with a 
big interest in the arts, is not explicited in the movie. It does not 
matter much, however.</P>
<P>Arenas, born in 1943, was a poor peasant boy with a rich gift for 
poetry.  He must have been 15 when he joined the Castro-led uprisings 
(December 1956 on...) against corrupt dictator (and former sergeant) 
Fulgencio Batista, who had to flee Cuba on  January 1, 1959.</P>
<P>The Revolution at first seemed to be good for Arenas. He received an 
education, found employment, wrote prose and poetry, won a major 
prize for a book, made friends both in and out literary circles. His 
friends were, it would seem, overwhelmingly gay.</P>
<P>Per the movie, by Castro-ite standards, intellectuals and/or artists 
are counter-revolutionary. The mere suspicion of political 
incorrectness may make someone an object of persecution, and almost 
guarantees it when the subject practices homosexuality, which Arenas 
did on a very large scale.</P>
<P>You cannot neatly separate fantasy from fact or near-fact in this 
movie, and this too does not matter. Arenas's first book was the only 
one published in Cuba, and found unacceptable by the authorities for 
reasons unspecified and only hinted at. Arenas, becomes a persona non 
grata, is oppressed, suppressed, persecuted for his life-style and 
associations, even framed. He is arbitrarily and repeatedly jailed 
under abject, near-infernal conditions, thrown into a pile of true 
criminals, and perhaps other railroaded innocents.</P>
<P>He manages to survive and to smuggle to Europe his subsequent works. 
In one such case it is BonBon, a flaming transvestite allowed prison 
visits --for unexplained reasons-- who carries a manuscript in an odd 
part of his anatomy. He is played by Johnny Depp. Depp  makes another 
appearance as a rather elegant Lieutenant who runs a prison and 
applies smoothly sadistic methods to get sexual gratification from 
Arenas. (Much earlier in the movie Sean Penn, unrecognizable, had 
given a ride in his cart to the teenage Reinaldo)</P>
<P>The acting of Javier Bardem (b. 1969) is outstandingly diverse, 
powerful and convincing --you keep your eyes glued on him. It's got 
to be in his genes. He comes from  a family of Spanish thespians-- 
grandparents, parents and siblings-- many of them famous.  Uncle Juan 
Antonio Bardem (b. 1922) was active until recently as director and 
scriptwriter. In the 1950s cinephiles used to sum up Spain's cinema 
as "the three Bs: Bunuel, Berlanga and Bardem."</P>
<P>Javier Bardem has acted in two dozen movies, but in the USA the 
public-at-large has probably seen him only in "High Heels" by 
Almodovar and "Jamon, jamon" by Bigas Luna.</P>
<P>This is neither a "normal" nor an "academic" or a "reportorial" 
biography of Arenas, but a fascinating mix of realism, ultra-realism, 
surrealism, dreams, true as well as invented documentary footage, 
poetry, fantasy, political criticism.</P>
<P>In a striking, memorable apocalyptic sequence, social outcasts live 
among ruins,  feast, copulate, and are fitting a hot-air balloon to 
escape to Florida. There is voice-over recitation and excellent Cuban 
or Cuban-inspired music. The well-filled two-and-a-quarter hours 
capture moods, mores, tragedy, some humor, life, sadness, joyfulness, 
pain, history, within a life under pressure. All this is not amount 
an orderly description of our hero/anti-hero. Though confusing at 
times it is a rich tossed salad whose main ingredient is Arenas.</P>
<P>In 1980, Castro allowed the departure of "undesirables" of all hues, 
including homosexuals and many criminals, by opening the harbor of 
Mariel for several months. 125,000 Cubans thus emigrated to the USA. 
One of them was Arenas. He spent 10 years in New York, then died of 
AIDS.</P>
<P>The film is oddly and arbitrarily bilingual, alternating in Spanish 
(subtitled) and English (with a Spanish accent). As Yul Brynner would 
say "it is a puzzlement." But what is an admirable puzzle is how most 
of the movie was shot in Mexico where it recreated so well the 
sights, sounds, people in their very Cuban-looking racial mixtures, 
streets, crumbling buildings, and all else with a precision that can 
fool even those who know the island. Additionally, what I suspect to 
be New York footage shot on video adds a special grittiness to the 
last part of the film. Ordinary studio sets and special effects pale 
by comparison.</P>
