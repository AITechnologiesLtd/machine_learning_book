"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>I'm all for people attempting to make Shakespeare more accessible to the
masses, but I draw the line at Love's Labour's Lost.  Kenneth Branagh's
fourth adaptation of the Bard (four and a half if you count A
Midwinter's Tale) tries to do way too much with what is arguably
Shakespeare's weakest play.</P>
<P>There are several things a filmmaker can do to liven up Shakespeare and
make his work more appealing to Betty and Ron Normalson of Wheeling,
West Virginia.  The first and most obvious is changing the setting, like
in Michael Almereyda's inspiring new version of Hamlet, which takes
place in present-day New York City.  An ambitious filmmaker can even
raise an eyebrow by casting acting talent that you wouldn't normally
associate with Shakespeare, like Branagh did with 1993's Much Ado About
Nothing, which featured Denzel Washington and the Razzie-nominated Keanu
Reeves.</P>
<P>Branagh does both of these here, as Lost is set in pre-World War II
Navarre, a small county outside of France, and features performances
from borderline Gen-Y talents Alicia Silverstone (Blast From the Past)
and Matthew Lillard (S.L.C. Punk).  But things go awry by the presence
of about ten song-and-dance numbers from the likes of Irving Berlin,
Cole Porter, Rogers & Hammerstein and the Gershwin brothers.  And when
the characters aren't singing, they're wrapped up in what appears to be
a zany screwball comedy from the ‘30s, full of silly pratfalls,
double-takes and exaggerated, slack-jawed facial expressions.  There's a
reason that vaudeville died, but nobody seems to have told Branagh.</P>
<P>The story is about The King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola, Timecode) and
his three horny buddies, Berowne (Branagh), Longaville (Lillard) and
Dumaine (Adrian Lester, Primary Colors), who decide that war is for
sissies and make an agreement to hole up for three years, depriving
themselves of women, food and sleep to study philosophy.  Their plans
are interrupted by the arrival of a French princess (Silverstone) and
her three horny friends Rosaline (Natascha McElhone, Ronin), Maria
(Carmen Ejogo, The Avengers) and Katherine (Emily Mortimer, Scream 3).
They sing, they dance, they fall in love, and I went home.  End of
story.  Oh, and then I had lunch.</P>
<P>There are also a lot of annoying supporting roles that made me want to
leave the theatre and run over someone's dog.  Each actor seemed to be
in a contest to see who could `out-ham' the next, and as a result, Lost
plays like a silly parody.  But I don't think it's supposed to be, which
just makes the whole thing laughably sad.  Particularly annoying are
Nathan Lane (Isn't She Great) and Timothy Spall, the latter of whom was
so likeable in Topsy-Turvy.</P>
<P>I've heard people complain about the quality of the singing and the
dancing of the actors, but I thought it was pretty commendable, with
Lester a notable standout.  It's certainly a lot better than I could do,
or would even be willing to do.  It's a risky move that unfortunately
doesn't pay off here.</P>
<P>Branagh deserves credit for his ambition, but little else.  He's been
nominated for three Oscars (writing and acting) in his Shakespeare
adaptations, but only when he sticks to the serious plays (Hamlet and
Henry V).  Most of Hamlet's crew is on board here as well, with
cinematographer Alex Thomson, editor Neil Farrell, production designer
Tim Harvey and composer Patrick Doyle (who was nominated for Hamlet)
contributing to the overall look, feel and sound of a ‘30s musical.</P>
