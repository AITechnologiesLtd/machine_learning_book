<P>   Sociologists theorize that money does not really change
people.  They point to lottery winners especially from the
working class, many of whom still live in the same ordinary
neighborhoods, keep their regular jobs, and take the usual
domestic vacations.  In the long run, maybe money does not
buy happiness, though the jury's still out, but in the short run
big bucks can change lives.  This seems to be what
filmmaker Yaguchi Shinobu believes as he looks into the
transformation of two young, shy Japanese people living in a
regional area of the country.  In a film that is part of the
famed Shooting Gallery series--which brought us "Croupier,"
one of the most intense films of the year--Shinobu has fun by
pitting some silly members of the yakuza (the Japanese
mafia) against two naifs on the run with the dough.  The
fortunes of the two young protagonists bob up and down, and
while they are fond of their yen, their yen for each other is left
adorably incomplete.</P>
<P>   Suzuki (Ando Masanobu) and Shizuko (Ishida Hikari) start
off as strangers but are remarkably alike.  Both suffer from
inarticulateness.  They seem doomed to lives of quiet
desperation.   Suzuki works for a rental car agency and is
regularly harassed by his boss, who is eager to provoke a
reaction.  Shizuko, a bespectacled and dateless nurse, does
not join in the usual girl talk of her two co-workers at the
general hospital, presumably because she's not currently
dating.  When Suzuki runs into a yakuza car, he is hauled by
a tall, lanky gangster, Kuroiwa (Kazue Tsunogae) to the
thug's operations office when a gas explosion kills everyone
but Suzuki and the almost fatally injured Kuroiwa.  Brought
into an ambulance by Shizuko together with the 200 million
yen of gang money, Suzuki is thrown out of the vehicle
together with the nurse and the money while Kuroiwa careens
into a river.  The shy twosome run away with the yen pursued
by six punks (the comic Jovi Jova team) and later by
Kuroiwa.</P>
<P>   This Japanese version of a road-and-buddy movie
combined with a comic gangster motif is hampered by poor
production values.  Little use is made of the regional
Japanese scenery, which looks faintly like what can find in
any developed country, and the pale color of photographer
Takashi Hamada's film casts a generic, washed-out look
throughout indoor and outside panoramas.  The chase
scenes could come out of any Three Stooges movie, mixing
the usual conventions of the genres with the obligatory
coincidences.</P>
<P>   The young couple are attractive and undergo a thorough
transformation that's credible enough, but there's little going
on that we haven't seen before in any number of such works
despite Shinobu's underlying purpose: to delve into the ways
that sudden wealth alters everything and yet may not
necessarily lead to thoroughly blissful unions.  Considering
the wondrous luck of the couple, they fight virtually from the
beginning, their potential as a couple in doubt.  Yaguchi
displayed more imagination in his "My Secret Cache",
involving a woman who falls into a crater with her stash of
stolen money only to be flushed out to pursue the lost cash.</P>
