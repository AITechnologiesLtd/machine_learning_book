<P>   A feelgood, comic drama with melodramatic overtones,
"Flawless" is the sort of film you might expect to come
around at this time for a shot at the Best Actor Oscar. Having
watched Dustin Hoffman get the big O for "Rain Man" (which
was cited as well for Best Picture in 1988), Joel Schumacher
("Batman Forever," "A Time To Kill") may have figured that
the story of a physically disabled person played by superstar
Robert De Niro could bring in the gold. In "Flawless," two
performers play lonely human beings outside the mainstream
of society who initially despise each other and through the
ups and down of almost forced contact learn to develop a
modicum of warm and fuzzy feelings.</P>
<P>   Schumacher was inspired to write and direct the story after
observing the destruction that a series of small strokes
delivered to a friend, a person whose speech underwent
dramatic improvement after he took singing lessons.  (This
makes sense since therapists have long observed that
stutterers lose their stumbling when engaged in song.)  But
where Wes Craven spent considerable time exhibiting the
process by which a gifted violin teacher inspires her pupils in
"Music the Heart," Schumacher focuses on the melodramatic
change of heart which the handicapped person undergoes
when he actually gets to know the object of his loathing and
the man's circle of friends.</P>
<P>   At times "Flawless" looks like a photographed play,
particularly when Patrick Capone's camera hones in on the
visits which Rusty (Philip Seymour Hoffman) makes to the
dilapidated hotel apartment of stroke victim Walt Koontz
(Robert De Niro).  Even when we move outside to the dreary
tenement streets of Brooklyn, the film has a closed-in feel
that denies us a substantial impression of the neighborhood
with its hookers, dealers, and criminals with their hangers-on. 
The sporadic violence somehow feels like part of a different
movie offering a jarring contrast to the drag-queen world on
display and, in fact, by artificially throwing Walt and Rusty
together, the chaos of the streets prevents us from witnessing
a true connection between the two principals.</P>
<P>   After a quick introduction to the daily lifestyle of Walt
Koontz (Robert De Niro), a one-time hero security guard
responsible for freeing 14 hostages, the mood becomes
melodramatic.  A trio of criminals chase after and track down
a man who has stolen $25,000 of their money, but not before
he had given the bag of loot away to a confidant.  When Walt
hears a commotion in an adjoining apartment, he throws
himself into the fray, gets shot, and suffers a stroke that
leaves him partially paralyzed and speech-impaired. 
Reluctant to leave his apartment for physical therapy, he
allows himself to receive singing lessons from the drag queen
against whom he had regularly exchanged loud insults. 
Slowly learning about the life of the wannabe transsexual 
Rusty (Philip Seymour Hoffman) together with the fun-loving
attitudes of his pals, he discerns the man's humanity and
vulnerability, becoming his friend.  In a final melodramatic
flourish, the camaraderie is put to the test.</P>
<P>   While De Niro does a credible job of performing in the role
of a man with a deep speech impediment (not very much
unlike his guise in the 1990 film "Awakenings" as a man who
awakens from a coma after 30 years), Hoffman is the real
star of this story.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, so adept in his
role as the sexually inhibited Allen in Todd Solondz's
"Happiness," is often so convincing that a viewer entering this
movie late could swear he was a woman.  We learn that his
character feels so trapped in his male body that he is willing
to spend upwards of $40,000 simply to change to the gender
that half the world is born into.  We also learn that drag
queens fight with one another about as much as they struggle
against homophobics who cannot abide their way of life.  The
most satiric scene satirizes a group of patronizing, suited, gay
Republicans, who seem to hold their noses while suggesting
that they march together with the queens in a show of
solidarity.  But on the whole, the movie, for all the quality of
its leads, does not resolve the differences between the two
men who appear to live with each other's company only
because of the temporary threats of the outside world.</P>
