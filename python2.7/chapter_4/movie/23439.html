Edtv
Reviewed by Christian Pyle
Directed by Ron Howard  
Written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel  (based on a screenplay by Emile
Gaudreault and Sylvie Bouchard) 
Starring Matthew McConaughey, Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson, Sally Kirkland,
Martin Landau, Ellen DeGeneres and Rob Reiner
Grade:  B</PRE>
<P>TV producer Cynthia Topping (Ellen DeGeneres) has an idea for a cable network
specializing in "reality shows":  take an average joe and broadcast his life on
TV everyday.  A talent search turns up Ed.  Ed Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey) is
a nobody, a 31-year-old video store clerk with no ambition.  He takes the offer
and Ed TV is born.  The show becomes a phenomenon when a romance develops
between Ed and his brother's girlfriend Shari (Jenna Elfman).  However, Shari
objects to dating with millions of peeping toms watching.  Ed doesn't
understand; although he's strangely unexcited about being a star, he accepts
his on-camera life casually.</P>
<P>Life becomes increasingly difficult for Ed and his family.  Everywhere he goes
crowds and cameras follow, and the constant attention threatens to devour
everyone around him.  "USA Today" takes polls on whether Shari is good enough
for Ed.  When Ed's father (Dennis Hopper) returns after a twenty-year absence,
the cameras record Ed's emotional confrontation with his mother (Sally
Kirkland) and stepfather (Martin Landau).  When Ed decides he wants out, the
network executive (Rob Reiner) says that Ed's contract gives them the right to
film him for as long as they want.</P>
<P>When "Edtv" was first advertised, I had the same reaction as most people: 
"Didn't they already make this movie?  It was called 'The Truman Show.'"  I
ignored the denials of director Ron Howard and various stars as they made the
rounds on interview shows and waited until "Ed" came creeping to cable before
seeing it.  There are basic similarities in the plots of "Ed" and "Truman"
(man's life is broadcast on TV, man decides he wants out of the glass house)
and in the things they satirize (loss of privacy, pop culture crazes), but the
focus is entirely different.  In "Truman" those issues were secondary to the
more esoteric theme of an everyman (Jim Carrey as Truman) discovering that a
god (Ed Harris) controls his life.  In the best parts of "Ed," the focus is
squarely on the twin streams of voyeurism and exhibitionism that fuel our
media-saturated society.   And the other parts?  By the end, the romantic
comedy has taken over center stage, and the movie's attempts to imitate the
comedy of "There's Something About Mary" fall flat (like Ed does on Elizabeth
Hurley's cat in one such scene).</P>
<P>Matthew McConaughey is the worst actor in Hollywood, but he seems to have
finally found his niche in this movie.  He was incredibly unconvincing as a
lawyer (in "A Time to Kill" and in "Amistad") and as a theologian (in
"Contact"), but as a lazy doofus McConaughey lives the part.  Among the
supporting cast, Martin Landau deserves special mention for his touching
performance as Ed's ailing but still upbeat stepfather.</P>
<P>Ironically, a movie about shameless self-promotion offers lots of opportunities
for . . . you guessed it . . . shameless self-promotion.  The Ed TV broadcasts
include an advertising area at the bottom of the screen, and the logos of many
real life corporations appear there.  Pepsi even puts a soda machine in Ed's
apartment.  Also, cameos abound.  Look for Jay Leno, Bill Maher, RuPaul,
Michael Moore, George Plimpton, Merrill Markoe, and Arianna Huffington to
appear as themselves.</P>
<P>Bottom line:  When "Ed" is on target, it fires straight and true.  The rest
we've seen before.</P>
