<P>     Michael Winterbottom's WELCOME TO SARAJEVO is a lot like its central
character, British reporter Michael Henderson (Stephen Dillane).  An
observer on the front lines of the Serbian siege of Sarajevo, Henderson is
torn between conflicting instincts.  As a journalist, he believes he
should be detached and objective as he tells the story of Sarajevo to the
world; as a human being, he feels compelled to beccome emotionally
involved, to take action which will help ease the suffering.</P>
<P>     Henderson eventually chooses the latter course.  The film, on the
other hand, isn't quite so resolute.  Much of the time, Winterbottom seems
content to provide a documentary-style history of the conflict in the
former Yugoslavia.  Archival footage of speeches and politicians' comments
are strewn throughout the narrative, while bombings and sniper attacks are
depicted with gruesome real-life footage of dead bodies and mangled limbs.
The images are powerful and immediate, but they become the story rather
than complementing it.  Henderson begins to seem like a character
digitally insterted, Forrest Gump-like, into historical events.</P>
<P>     When the story does focus on his actions, it fumbles away too many
opportunities to personalize its grand-scale tragedy.  Character
relationships, like those between Henderson and a brash American reporter
(Woody Harrelson) and his no-nonsense producer (Kerry Fox), get just
enough attention to be frustrating; Henderson's devotion to an orphan
named Emira (Emira Nusevic) is rushed until it feels more like a cinematic
necessity than a genuine connection.  Even the film's most potentially
intense sequence, involving the illegal transport of a bus-load of orphans
out of the country, feels strangely sedate despite one gripping encounter
at a Bosnian checkpoint.  That sequence doesn't even serve as the film's
climax, leading into a dry 20-minute search for Emira's birth mother which
grinds WELCOME TO SARAJEVO to a halt.  Far too often, Winterbottom and
screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce demonstrate a clumsy disregard for
building a narrative with an emotional pull beyond its bursts of authentic
violence.</P>
<P>     I can easily imagine a film like WELCOME TO SARAJEVO degenerating
into pathos in Hollywood hands, so perhaps it deserves some credit for
avoiding copious shots of sad-eyed waifs.  Winterbottom simply goes too
far in the other direction.  The performances and direction are sturdy but
rarely inspired, resulting in a film which makes us feel terrible about
this tragic conflict in a very abstract sense.  WELCOME TO SARAJEVO is
good reporting, but it's not particularly good drama, treating its subject
with the concerned detachment of a newsmagazine feature story.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Split decisions:  5.</PRE>
