<PRE>                                 THE PAPER
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>        I don't believe but a minute of Ron Howard's THE PAPER. It's
typical Howard -- showing his general competence as a storyteller and 
once more showing his insistence on making movies for the boobgoisie. If
Howard had an adult movie maker's vision and audacity, THE PAPER would be
about what's eating away at our media faster than an unchecked cancer --
the frightening Power PC speed of tabloiditis. But Howard's too
pedestrian, too ready to avoid the very issues this and some of his other
movies bring up and instead goes in for goofy fantasies: in his puerile
confusion about the real condition of journalism, he's dispensing
retrograde honor to a profession that lost its way -- way long ago. Giving
benefit of doubt he's even aware there's a very powerful danger in what's
happening in our press, the question may be -- Is Howard afraid of
tackling it? He drags everything down to a suburban ha-ha teenage level;
like James Brooks in BROADCAST NEWS, he codifies sitcom behavior. When one
half of the audience for THE PAPER is listening to the other half laugh at
scenes that don't seem to be very funny, it's like edited-in canned
audience responses used by TV comdies to cover up their emptiness. </P>
<P>        The news business has become the nation's favorite whipping boy --
as well as whipper -- by the very nature of its pervasiveness. It's our
most publicly accessible, bottomless pit -- the ultimate voracious
consumer. If we attack it for its excessive abuse and callous intrusion,
we must also remember that it's often asked to be or condoned as the
national intruder -- our communal "private eye." The current recklessness
of media is the rage of disseminating fractured information: it's
"Gotcha!" before the facts. All of us have the same conflicting feelings
about the press, and especially TV news. As a nation reeling in a case of
the hates over just about everything and probably hating the press more
than anything else, we paradoxically "love" it because it makes complex
issues simplistic and debase. We don't have to think if headlines and TV
news shows scream out allegations of wrongdoings, cover-ups, scandals; the
preponderance of gossip, rumor, innuendo, grudges make it seem that
whoever is alleged to have committed a crime or violation is guilty first,
innocent -- if that even matters nowadays -- later.  (Like the apparent
joy in branding the First Lady guilty of phantom crimes.) We love being
glued to the box during a crisis or scandal or tragedy, absorbed by its
immediacy, how we're "right there," as we were during the Persian Gulf
War, or the scorching of the Waco cult compound, or the Oklahoma bombing.
Our adrenaline is really pumping -- and particularly true in a live
interview. Those of us who saw the original broadcast-exchange between Dan
Rather and George Bush in 1988, or watched the Senate Confirmation
Hearings of Clarence Thomas, felt a heightened sense of response, of
danger, because we didn't know what direction the interview or hearings
would take. (It is this element of risk, of the unknown, of intoxicating
provocation that no other news medium can match. Radio is close, but it
can't provide truth-or-lie-or-demeanor-telling properties the way the
camera usually can.) What we hate about news isn't merely our suspicions
about those in the business -- that "Gotcha!" is replacing hard news and
real facts -- or our fears concerning our growing voyeuristic cravings for
the sensational, as in the Thomas-Anita Hill, Gennifer Flowers, Magic
Johnson, Michael Jackson, Tanya Harding cases, it's also our guilt in
allowing ourselves to be so damned consumed by the titillating drama of
news. Like we were during the trial of William Kennedy Smith vs. "I'm not
a blue blob," or the Bobbitt thing, or the on-going mockery of justice of
the O.J. SImpson fiasco. </P>
<P>        Many of us feel guilty when we don't watch the unfolding of a news
"event" -- afraid that we're going to miss something. Until very recently,
some of us even felt guilt about missing a nightly newscast or two. It's
the need to get it now and not later, in a newspaper, because by the time
we read about something in the morning edition, the box has already
updated that something; it's a matter of instant discretion -- the
zapper's power -- because the growth of TV news has permitted choice; it's
also subjective, aesthetic and cosmetic -- selectively allowing specific
TV anchors or reporters or commentators into our homes because they appeal
to us. Some women fantasize about suave Peter Jennings; outdoorsy males
respond to Tom Brokaw's Lands End quality; college-age fattie bigots
worship Rush; technocrats mainline with CSPAN. We're picky about
newspapers and magazines and their writers too, but we can better control
whatever our responses; we don't have to fight sensory overload. Yet it is
the very addictive nature of the "overload" that compels us and the
programmers and editors onward and thereby permitting a proliferation of
TV tabloids, ideological talk shows, informercials, a rush of speculation
in newspapers and, the latest kick, online forums. News has become
stimulation, visceral, but without a filter of veracity. Is it any wonder
that we've become a nation of instant paranoids, panicked not on the basis
of facts but over rumors and gossip packaged as factoids? Murderess Susan
Smith claimed a black man kidnapped her two children and Newtie invects
implicit racism as election ploy. CNBC's effete flabbermouths are probably
more responsible for any week's stock market dive than the Fed and actual
investors. Is it exaggeration to say news has become dangerous to our
national health? If dangerous now, what will we call it when the 500
channel nightmare arrives? To keep those channels profitable, there will
be a new crisis or scandal manufactured every hour. </P>
<P>        How often have we heard the media defend themselves over their
moral infractions and insensitivity and intrusions by saying that they're
constitutionally guaranteed freedom to "report"? Had Ron Howard had given
us a newspaper that once had a tradition of solid reporting, of
respectability, and had to resort to using tabloid tricks to bring in the
revenues, there might have been something beyond fantasy, something
hopeful, in the way THE PAPER climaxes, but more than that he might have
looked into the future: he might have guessed that soon the Supreme Court
will re-address the issue of the freedom of the press. Tthe Court is going
to go after total disregard of the facts in reportage; it will recognize
that, some years back, when decreeing that public figures are fair game,
it set into motion a freedom of irresponsibility. That's why we can get
Xmas time sex scandals concocted by misogynists like David Brock; that's
why there's never an apology from the press over such stories that can not
be proved, only alleged. That's why we're getting Gutter Encounters of the
Weird Kind about Whitewater: Rush on TV repeating groundless rumors that
Vince Foster was murdered in a "safe house" rented by Hillary Rodham
Clinton. That's why we're getting scum like Jerry Falwell using a
president to publicly preach hate as a family value. Scarier still is that
perople are willing to accept fabrication over fact, as Paula Jones' money
hunger confirms. The press has never been innocent, yet in recent years
it's gotten intolerably bloody and trashy. Can we pinpoint a reason why? I
think so: When sleepyhead Ronnie was elected in 1980, one of the first
demolition jobs he instructed his henchmen to perform was on the FCC's
"Fairness Doctrine." Basically, this guideline demanded, with TV in
particular, equal time for opposing sides on issues. Ronnie didn't like
that because it prevented his Morning in America propaganda from being
promulgated as gospel. After his re-election, he managed to get the
equality mandates downgraded to voluntary and national and local public
affairs programs shifted the emphasis of fairness to screaming
contentiousness: the exchange of views became ever less civilized and ever
more Buchanan-loaded and Rushy. One notes with deep regret that though
there are minimal efforts to maintain a balance of opinion, the scales
have tipped to hypertensive demagoguery. The demise of the fairness
doctrine also meant the death of hundreds of locally-produced public
affairs shows, which at one time served the community well in that large
numbers of the citizenry got on TV. What's left of these kinds of programs
is now exclusively the domain of the hacks of local newspapers who write
unreadable columns and send out correspondence written on notes with their
pictures plastered on them, and the "nobodies" have moved to cable access
channels where, to say the least, production values and sometimes
transmissions are poor and viewership small. Something else happened as a
result of the lack of enforcement of the fairness doctrine: a deluge of 
TV tabloid exposes that don't even bother to attempt to explain the
absence of the "other side"; we're getting more and more on the so-called
prestige newscasts and magazine shows a virulent form of vigilante
journalism -- indicting and convicting people on air for only alleged
crimes, especially child abuse crimes, that, with closer inspection, never
happened. (It was TV that caused California to spend over $120 million to
presecute without conviction the McMartin Pre-School case.) We get
televised show trials that pretend to be "fair," but are monuments to
horrible exploitation and very likely unconstitutionally censored. I'm
thinking specifically about the rape trial of William Kennedy Smith. </P>
<P>        Acknowledging that only two out of 250,000,000 really know what
happened, the trial was, in the final analysis, a mockery of equal
justice. CNN and other broadcasters decided that not only would they cover
Patricia Bowman's face with the infamous "blue blob," but would do as much
as they could to keep her name from being revealed. Spokesmen for the
networks said that they were honoring so-called "shield laws," which in
effect are supposed to be civilized protections of privacy for alleged
rape victims. I even heard a few say that they were forced by Florida law
to protect Bowman's identity. It didn't matter that the very shield law
they used to defend their actions was in fact declared unconstitutional,
and therefore, during the trial, not law. It gets worse: the media did not
extend to the defendant the same level of privacy. As a member of the
Kennedy Clan, he became a "public figure" who could be freely smeared
without fear of litigation. The press, at the conniving behest of a Betty
Anderson-Harrington, whose endless string of men, parties, drug-taking,
abortions, mental history were community knowledge, made a private man a
figure of obscene public abuse. Watching as much of the trial as was
televised, I'd have voted for acquittal simply because of Bowman's
performance. Not that I believed Smith more -- his demeanor drove me nuts
and there's every likelihood he's at least as good a liar as his accuser.
But there's every reason to believe that Bowman wanted not only the
"shield" protection but also the show trial; it would give her the
opportunity to audition for the her own story: PALM BEACH PLACE. Her first
breakdown was moving, and the second almost as touching, but by the third
cue-prompt, there was a surprising actor's polish in her voice -- even the
sniffles were too grand. (I kept wanting to blow my nose.) Then she showed
a fatally clumsy intellectual side -- having answered "I don't know or
remember" 162 times. She wasn't helped when the prosecution's star witness
admitted to taking $40,000 from "A Current Affair" and falsified under
oath as to when she first met the plaintiff, and it didn't help Bowman
much either that her heavy drinking and popping of muscle relaxants the
evening of the alleged crime were disclosed. Booze and relaxants -- legal
kicks for the trust fund set. Did the media pay much attention this, or to
the witness for the prosecution's repeated lies, or to the lack of
physical evidence of any forceful assault, or the sheer mind-boggling fact
that during the time of the alleged rape, nine people were sleeping in the
Kennedy compound, which has no air conditioning? No, they went on their
merry way with the protective blobs and rumors that Bowman, having lost
the trial, would likely file a civil suit for unspecified damages. She
didn't; and one look at her PrimeTime and Larry King appearances tells us
why.</P>
<P>        The popular, sometimes accurate perception that most if not all
news reporters are hard-boiled or bloodthirsty -- or, in some cases are as
corrupt as the corrupters they report on -- probably got started back with
the late 19th century London newspaper wars, many of them centering on
Jack the Ripper, and the feeling was reinforced during the American yellow
journalism wars engaged in by William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer.
And renewed by the proliferation of lurid sex & crime tabloids and cheapie
magazines that displayed boobs and bums and dismembered guts on their
front pages during the 50s. In no small way, Ben Hecht and Charles
MacArthur's THE FRONT  PAGE, a play that has been steadily performed since
it first opened back in 1928 and has been filmed at least four times, has
done its share to perpetuate the perceptions by glorifying them in a macho
reverie. The almost-validating bite of their play is that journalism
wouldn't be fair without some lowdown hanky panky. Movie makers in recent
years haven't given the press a clean bill of health either: ALL THE
PRESIDENT'S MEN, which on the surface looks like a salute to journalism,
eventually taxes a fair-minded audience's receptiveness by not only using
our national hatred of Nixon but also by using the mysterious "Deep
Throat" as method and news source -- subterfuge that, in retrospect, fails
to earn an acquittal: doesn't the accused have the right to face his
accuser? NETWORK, the bitchkrieg that admonishes TV-induced paranoia
that's a 1976 look into our present; ABSENCE OF MALICE, ridiculing a
reporter's naivete; THE  YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY," a slam against a
reporter's desire to make a name for himself; UNDER FIRE, depicting the
suicidet of reporters when they take sides in political battles; and THE
PAPER dealing with tabloid economics vs. twenty four hour suppression of
facts. Naturally these films aren't acceptable to most responsible
journalists -- they mistakenly think they're above the moral muddle, like
Helen Thomas, who one day suggests Hillary should hold a news conference
to explain Whitewater and then turn around and publicly attack the first
lady on CSPAN for doing what she suggested. </P>
<P>         At the height of Joseph McCarthy's rampage against supposed
American Communists in the 50s, the climate in newspaper and radio
journalism -- TV not having quite come into its own, although it played
the key national part in McCarthy's demise -- was so rotted and feverish
with paranoia that lives were daily sacrifices to the vicious killing
machines of yellow headlines. Only when it became clear that McCarthy
could be broken by the soft-spoken rebukes of rational voices did the
press then turn on him, vilifying him for exactly what they so freely
practiced without fear of retribution. Arguably the nation absolved the
press of its role in whipping up a frenzied battle over the semantics of
political freedom because it shared in the guilt. Slanted journalism,
according to the ultra-conservatives, hit an apex during the Vietnam War
-- especially television's coverage of it. No war before and probably no
war after -- as proved by the Persian Gulf episode -- has been more
documented by the lie-detecting camera; the daily bloodletting images of
the Michael J. Arlen-termed "Living Room War," shown on ABC, NBC and CBS,
betrayed the weekly General William Westmoreland pep rallies that promised
victory. The Agnew speeches, jerked off by shock troopers Patrick
Buchanan, and William Safire, were designed to counter the rising
revulsion and attack those, mostly in the press who were against the war,
as "nattering nabobs of negativity," "pampered prodigies of the radical
liberals," and all the verbal attacks were peppered with codes like
"pusillanimous," "sniveling," "eunuchs," "effete soobs." After the
assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., and
after the fascist Chicago Democratic Convention, "The Time of Illusion" --
the title of Jonathan Schell's collection of political pieces originally
written for The New Yorker -- came to a halt for most press outlets. (Only
temporarily: softball reporting got retrofitted for Reagan, and would
again go soft during the actual bombing duration of Bush's tantrum against
Saddam.) The gulf between country right or wrong and a national conscience
would only enlarge when Nixon's Watergate adventure destroyed him. But
audiences, at least at this writing, may not have evolved as much as the
technologies of TV communications: voters may not fail to recognize a
scoundrel, but that doesn't mean they won't vote for one: the
Republican'ts recently elected a prevaricating, deadbeat daddy as House
Majority Leader who once served his former wife divorce paper while she
was in the throes of a serious battle with cancer.</P>
<P>        Actors as anchors, editors or reporters aren't exactly
caricatures, or impersonations; they're more like examples of the fear of
being hip. You almost hear the actors anxiously half-giggling, "Are we
getting it right?" Jane Fonda couldn't get in right in THE CHINA SYNDROME.
Neither Sigourney Weaver in EYEWITNESS nor Christine Lahti in JUST BETWEEN
FRIENDS got it right. Sally Field was a wipeout in ABSENCE OF MALICE and
Joanna Cassidy failed to get "radiospeak" down pat in UNDER FIRE. Mel
Gibson had the romantic fantasy but hardly the authority of a foreign
correspondent in THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY and Sam Waterston, looking
a little like D. H. Lawrence, was a Yale poseur as Pulitzer Prize winning
Sydney Schanberg in THE KILLING FIELDS.</P>
<P>        With receding hairline and toughened face, Glenn Close could play
a bean-counting managing editor, ala Katherine Graham, but not as Ron
Howard directs her in THE PAPER, and he allowed Michael Keaton to be too
scatterbrained a city editor to have the kind of righteous punch aimed
for. He'd make it as an editor for something as low as the New York Sun
but it's an insult that he'd be considered for anything more than a
janitorial position for a competing paper like the New York Sentinel,
which surrogates as the N.Y. Times. Only when Robert Duvall, as the Sun's
editor, flays into his own editorial pages filled with "columnists, guests
columnists and celebrity columnists," is there a bit of reality. (It's the
only time the silent half of the audience responded -- by cheering.) Maybe
it's me; I just can't seem to accept actors playing overly-familiar faces
or professions. The blurring of celebrity tends to discount whatever value
is left of the real professional journalist. This happened to Carl
Bernstein and Bob Woodward when Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford play
them, respectively, in the moldy, chiaroscuristic ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.
Somehow the movie fakery intensifies the often fake seriousness and
righteousness of the business of news. Perhaps this is why audiences felt
and still feel a charge from Peter Finch's Howard Beale in the bombastic
NETWORK, which earns masterpiece status compared to the snoozing BROADCAST
NEWS and the juvenile PAPER. Finch's rantings were manifestly rigged, and
the audience knew it, but the rigging was also premonitory and the
audience felt it. (Pauline Kael's most grievous error of perception is her
review of the movie, entitled "Hot Air.") Though Finch, William Holden and
Faye Dunaway weren't required to be anything other than Paddy Chayefsky's
conniptions about what the box was -- in fact, is -- turning all of us
into, they did it with such frenzied passion that the warnings,
particularly those expressed by Holden about the dangers of many of us
turning into Dunaway's Diana, have real resonance; we HAVE become little
Diana horrors. These actors have a rip-roaring good time (and so does the
audience) with dialogue actors kill for. What glorious diarrhea of the
hates! Despite a few passable one-liners, William Hurt in BROADCAST NEWS
seems frustrated by a lack of words -- he's constipated. He'd be right at
home in THE PAPER, in which the only bits of minimal interest take place
in the men's room.</P>
<P>        Andy  Rooney once described BROADCAST NEWS as "one of the best
movies I've ever seen," and, if that's not enough of a wound, inflicted
this: "As a writer, sitting there watching the movie, I was exultant, to
the point of tears, with (James Brooks') success in converting what was in
his head to paper and then to film...A movie director doesn't really want
good writing -- just a sheaf of papers that provide some notes and an
outline to keep in mind where to set up the cameras and what to tell the
actors to do...The best writers have, with a lot of exceptions which I
won't stop to note, never written for television or motion pictures. This
is partly because good writers are nervous about being associated with
what usually are considered to be second-class art forms, but also because
good writers don't know how to write for television or the movies, and
they're reluctant to expose their ignorance of something they don't
respect much, anyway." No reluctance on Rooney's part to expose his. And
clearly, in THE PAPER, in spite of the clever ads for Compaq, Multi-Sync
monitors and QuarkXPress, Howard isn't afraid to reveal his, either. The
one inescapable fact we can derive from the media's triumph of hype over
fact, shamelessness over decency is that ignorance is indeed bliss.
"Gotcha!" without responsibility, without accountability, is destroying
what moral value is left in journalism.                            </P>
