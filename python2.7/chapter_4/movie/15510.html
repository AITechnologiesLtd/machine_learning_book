<PRE>THE IMPOSTORS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Following the art house success Big Night, Stanley Tucci has set his
sights on making a screwball comedy.  With a top notch cast, and plenty
of good humor, The Impostors is warmly reminiscent of the great
screwball comedies of old.</P>
<P>Arthur and Maurice (Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt) are two struggling
actors in the 1930s. Desperate for work, they perform impromptu live
performances in the middle of an unsuspecting sidewalk cafe.  They've
also been known to attempt the occasional con or two in order to get
food on their meager plates.</P>
<P>Through a convoluted series of events, the bumbling pair mistakenly stow
away aboard a cruise ship.  There, they disguise themselves as stewards
and mingle with a zany variety of vacationers, including an arrogant
actor out for their blood (Alfred Molina), and a man's man tennis pro
(Billy Connolly) who's after them for very different reasons.</P>
<P>The crew of the ship isn't too helpful to the pair.  Although they do
find a sympathetic ear in Lily (Lili Taylor), they find the fascistic
head steward Meistrich (Campbell Scott) has no tolerance for stowaways.
A suicidal entertainer (Steve Buscemi) and a first mate with a secret
agenda (Tony Shalhoub) simply add to the already bizarre mix.</P>
<P>Writer-director Stanley Tucci was apparently aiming to recreate a  good
ol'-fashioned screwball comedy...and he mostly succeeds. Even when a few
of the far-fetched setups don't quite work...the actors seem to be
having such a good time that the frantically festive mood begins to rub
off.</P>
<P>Tucci and Platt enjoy a hearty comradery from right off the bat, a fact
crucial to making the film work.  The pair are introduced in a hilarious
silent bit, and we get to know the characters before even a word is
uttered.</P>
<P>The title of The Impostors doesn't just represent the main characters.
Virtually everyone in the film is an impostor of one sort or another,
pretending to be something he or she isn't.  The various plots and
intersections of the characters provide much of the film's humor.</P>
<P>When the film actually gets to the ship and introduces us to its
whirlwind of characters, the introductions are swiftly and deftly
handled without confusion.  The supporting ensemble deliver terrific
performances all around, and are a delight to behold.</P>
<P>There are a few misfired gags here and there, but the film has plenty of
good gags to spare.  While it won't rank up with the all-time screwball
classics, The Impostors is still a wonderful little comedy.</P>
