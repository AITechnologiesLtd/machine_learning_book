<P>     MAN BITES DOG is a pseudo-documentary that follows the killing
sprees of the murderous Benoit (Benoit Poelvoorde).  With cameras
rolling, he calmly explains his theories about killing people and
weighing down the bodies so they won't float to the surface of whatever
river or lake he dumps them in.  He then proceeds to slaughter person
after person, respecting neither age nor sex nor race, and murdering in
a wide variety of ways from strangulation to a bullet to the head.  All
the while, the film crew trails him, heedless of the danger they put
themselves in, and uncaring as they are drawn deeper and deeper into
the psychotic, criminal world of their subject.</P>
<P>     As a short, this could have been a brilliant, blistering satire on
society's views of violence and how it relates to movies.  However, MAN
BITES DOG is a full-length feature and, as such, spends a little too
much time with its subject.  Thirty minutes, or even forty-five, would
have been a perfect length, but by the end of the third half-hour,
certain elements of this movie (namely Ben's endless philosophizing)
have grown tired.  The violence has lost its edge and the movie has
begun to meander.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, despite the possibly-excessive length, there is
still a lot to praise in this obscure effort by a trio of
previously-unknown Belgian film makers.  They have taken violence in
the cinema to its ultimate limit and created an always-irreverent,
often darkly funny look at killers and victims.</P>
<P>     Every moment of this film is shot documentary-style in grainy
black-and-white.  This pseudo-realism, complete with choppy editing
and unsteady, hand-held camera shots, gives an eerie air of legitimacy
to MAN BITES DOG.  Added to that, the three main characters in the film
all use their real names.  The film makers are Remy and Andre, and the
killer is Benoit.</P>
<P>     Benoit possesses an especially interesting personae.  Heartless as
a killer, he's actually a fun guy to be around most of the time.  He
loves his girlfriend and adores his family.  He's smart and thoughtful,
often giving lengthy discourses on various aspects of life and death.
Then, the next thing you know, he's blowing someone's brains out or
raping a woman while her naked husband looks on in horror.</P>
<P>     An issue addressed by MAN BITES DOG is how intimately the media
becomes involved in the stories they cover.  Are they simply reporting
the facts or, by their mere presence, are they participating in them?
The answer given by this film isn't obscure as the movie makers slowly
come to assist Ben in his various crimes.  At first, it's just little
things like shining a light in a certain spot, but it doesn't take long
before they're actually joining in.</P>
<P>     At one time or another, comparisons have been made between this
film and a couple of other recent, gut-wrenching productions--HENRY:
PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER and RESERVOIR DOGS.  From my point-of-view,
while there are superficial similarities between these pictures and MAN
BITES DOG, the basic thrust is radically different.  RESERVOIR DOGS and
HENRY are both serious movies.  MAN BITES DOG approaches itself and its
subject with tongue planted firmly in cheek.</P>
<P>     One of the most hilarious moments in the film comes when Ben has a
shoot-out with another killer.  After Ben kills his rival, the film
crew catches up with him standing over the body.  At that moment,
another group of men with cameras show up--they had been doing a
documentary about the exploits of the now-dead man.  Dark, twisted
humor like this characterizes MAN BITES DOG.</P>
<P>     The limited budget of the film shows, but in a way that adds to
the genuine feel of what we're seeing.  The plot has a couple of twists
that allow us to see various emotions from all of the principals of MAN
BITES DOG.  Nevertheless, through the entire movie, the only character
to be effectively developed is that of the killer, Ben.</P>
<P>     Obviously not a movie for everyone, MAN BITES DOG boasts graphic
displays of murder and rape.  There's very little of the human
body--inside or out--that isn't shown at one time or another during
the course of this movie.  Nevertheless, if you do venture to see MAN
BITES DOG, you would have to be made out of stone to miss the visceral,
sardonic impact of a highly-unusual film.</P>
