<PRE>THE BEST MAN</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Athan Bezaitis
Copyright Athan Bezaitis 1999</PRE>
<P>The best text for a film to toy with the "emotional heartstrings" of
an audience is undoubtedly the romantic comedy.  Broad in its appeal,
the filmmaker doesn't have to worry about turning away certain
audiences with horror, overblown special effects, or too much action.
Romantic comedies are so successful because they parody our
fascination with love and all its complexities.  They are kind of like
rolling along a roller coaster of emotions poking fun at our society's
mores, twisting and turning towards a morally fulfilling conclusion.
It's a catch 22- despite the fact that we know what's going to happen
in the end, we keep coming back for more, and are continuously
intrigued time and again by the molding of a blissful resolution.</P>
<P>THE BEST MAN, directed and written by Malcom Lee, is a prime example
of an exhilarating love story that will certainly charm its audience.
Well written and fabulously acted, this film hopefully will put some
fresh new faces onto the Hollywood scene.</P>
<P>The story of a group of college friends reuniting for a wedding, THE
BEST MAN chronicles a weekend in the life of Harper Stewart (Taye
Diggs- GO, THE WOOD).  A commitment shy writer who must deal with
marrying off his best friend Lance Sullivan (Morris
Chestnut-G.I. JANE), the hype of his upcoming first novel, and facing
"the gang" again, who will not let him escape some secrets of his
past.  By the end of the weekend, several of those secrets are
indirectly revealed in an advanced copy of his book, which, much to
his dismay, has already gotten around the to the group of friends.
The culprit is an over ambitious bridesmaid Jordan Armstrong, (Nia
Long- SOUL FOOD) who is also a television producer looking for an
exclusive interview, and a maybe a little something else from Harper?
Just what are these dark secrets of Harper's past?  You'll just have
to find out, but when they are revealed, the whole group will have to
reevaluate their relationships with each other, their lovers, and with
themselves.</P>
<P>The most commendable aspect of this film is its amazing cast.  Tye
Diggs is one of Hollywood's brightest young stars and turns in a
brilliant performance in his first feature role.  Quentin, (Terrance
Howard- JOHNS, MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS) one of Harper's main college
buddies, steals the show as a hedonistic lover-boy with no clear
career ambitions despite enormous artistic talents.  Hilariously
funny, his character encompasses a perfect blend of intelligence and
sass.  Another buddy, Murch, (Harold Perrineau- best known as the
narrator from HBO's "Oz") plays an oversensitive soft spoken guy
trapped in a dysfunctional relationship with longtime girlfriend
Shelby (Melissa De Sousa (THE FIRE THIS TIME- a short film).  It's
nice to see him in a role where he's not confined to a dark cell or a
wheel chair as in "Oz."  He's a talented actor with a bright future
and this film shows his versatility.  Sanaa Lathan, (LIFE) Harper's
girlfriend whom he can't quite commit to, also puts in a memorable
performance.  Morris Chestnut (BOYZ IN THE HOOD) must be commended for
his display of emotion in anticipation of his forthcoming wedding
despite the maelstrom of hysteria leading up to the event.  Finally,
Nia Long (STIGMATA) whose character's overzealousness often shades her
good intentions, plays an excellent role.  This cast is one of the
finest I've seen in any film of late.</P>
<P>The only weak points were that the movie ran a little long and several
crucial scenes were a little far fetched. Like when Lance, the groom
to be, steps into the bathroom to read Harper's book while the
strippers are getting it on at the bachelor party in his honor.  Come
on now.  How are we supposed to believe that?</P>
<P>Otherwise, this is definitely a fun first date movie.  A good one for
breaking the ice with that first rendezvous on a Friday night.  By the
end of the film, you just may find yourself with your arm around that
special someone.</P>
