<P>In 1992, director David Fincher made his feature debut with the
long-awaited Alien 3 and met with a savaging by critics and audiences
alike. It's doubtful if anyone thought they would hear from Fincher again
after this reception.</P>
<P>Three years later he hit back with the Brad Pitt/Morgan Freeman film Seven,
probably the best thriller of the Nineties. Suddenly Fincher became the
critics' darling; everyone seemed to conveniently forget his earlier effort
and, if they did remember it, of course it was because of problems with the
producers/screenplay/studio. Fincher was hailed as one of the best of the
new breed of directors and Seven received some of the best reviews of the
year. The Game, then, had a lot of expectations to live up to.</P>
<P>Michael Douglas stars as Nicholas Van Orton, an investment banker without
much to live for - he's rich, but is also divorced, lives alone and has no
life to speak of. On his 48th birthday, his younger brother Conrad (Sean
Penn) gives him a gift certificate for Consumer Recreation Services, a
company that specialises in entertaining clients. That's pretty much all
Nicholas knows about them when he decides, after much reservation, to pay
them visit, which doesn't help him in figuring out just what it is they do.
Not long after, though, his life is turned upside down by a series of
freakish events.</P>
<P>Douglas gives one of his best performances here. I've never been a huge fan
of his, so it was a pleasure to see him in the sort of role that Harrison
Ford could have made his own. In fact, it reminded me somewhat of Ford's
earlier Frantic, with both main characters not knowing just what the hell
is going on around them.</P>
<P>Penn appears briefly but is terrific. Jodie Foster was considered for this
role, which makes no sense at all. Foster, admirable actress though she is,
could not in a million years acquit herself, although it's probable that
the part would have been rewritten to accommodate her.</P>
<P>I liked The Game until the much talked-about ending. I knew that there was
some consternation regarding it from some critics, but I understandably
refrained from finding out what it was until I saw the actual film. I liked
the final scenes at first, but after the film finished I found that it just
didn't work for me, and so it tainted the rest of the movie. This is a
pity, because, for the most part, The Game is a fine psychological thriller
which, while overlong and in some parts over the top, is very enjoyable.
Some scenes are especially good (Nicholas' episode in the runaway taxi, for
example) but, in the end, this is one of the few movies I've seen where the
ending was so disappointing that the film as a whole suffered.</P>
<P>An admirable but disappointing effort, all the more so because it could
have very easily been a truly great piece of work. A second viewing may be
in order, I think.</P>
