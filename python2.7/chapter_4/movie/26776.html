MEN OF HONOR
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>MEN OF HONOR, by director George Tillman Jr. (SOUL FOOD), is so full of 
schmaltz that it leaves viewers in constant jeopardy of gagging.  
Although based on a real life hero, Carl Brashear, the first 
African-American Navy diver, the movie features a tedious script by 
first-time film writer Scott Marshall Smith that is so treacly that it 
could attract flies.  And just in case you miss the precise moments in 
which you are expected to cry or applaud, Mark Isham's syrupy and 
bombastic music will remind you as it blasts through the theater's 
speakers.  On the other hand, if you close your eyes and ignore the 
movie itself, it is easy to be impressed by the nobility and drive of 
the man himself.  Too bad that this movie doesn't serve him better.</P>
<P>Leaving a hard working life as a sharecropper's son, Carl (Cuba Gooding 
Jr. in an intense performance) signs up to join the Navy.  In the 1950s, 
the only positions in the Navy for African Americans were as cooks or 
valets, but Carl wanted more.  With visions of becoming a master diver, 
he works his way into diving school where he confronts extreme racial 
opposition and prejudice.  </P>
<P>In an unbelievable and way over-the-top performance, Robert De Niro 
plays Master Chief Billy "I am God!" Sunday.  As a blatant racist, Billy 
taunts Carl, whom he calls Cookie, at every turn.  Billy, Carl's number 
one nemesis, will, of course, make a miraculous conversion and become 
his friend and benefactor.</P>
<P>Carl is given a lexicon of cheap clichés to toss out at every turn.  
"Why do you want this so badly?" Carl is asked by a beautiful librarian 
(Aunjanue Ellis), soon after they meet.  "Because they said that I 
couldn't have it," he shots back with one of his typical sound bites.  </P>
<P>The overly long movie features lots of diving in deep, murky water, in 
which it's rarely clear what is happening.  Cinematographer Anthony B. 
Richmond likes to bring his camera in tight on the diver's face, which 
isn't particularly helpful.  Between the cloudiness of the water and the 
small glass window the diver looks through, we can't see much of 
anything, certainly no subtleties in the actor's expression.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is pretty much wasted.  As Billy's lush of a wife, 
Charlize Theron (THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE) wanders on the set on 
occasion without much effect.  She isn't given anything of any 
consequence to do and adds nothing for her paycheck.  </P>
<P>Hands down, the strangest performance is given by Hal Holbrook as the 
diving school's head, Mr. Pappy.  Like a refugee from CATCH 22, Mr. 
Pappy lives high up in a lookout tower over the barracks.  "They were 
going to make him an admiral until they found out that he had more loose 
screws that a Studebaker," the ever-stuttering Snowhill (Michael 
Rapaport) tells Carl.</P>
<P>The story features lots of ridiculous and unbelievable bravado.  Carl, 
for example, is willing to risk his entire career, for which he worked 
so hard, in a breath-holding contest with Billy in order to help a 
friend.  Guess who will win.</P>
<P>Dragging the movie out a half-hour too long, Tillman, thinking he is 
directing an epic, finds few incidents that he doesn't want to 
exaggerate and drag out.  With music and other clues, he tells you 
precisely where you are expected to applaud.  Some in the audience will 
obey.  Don't be surprised that if you don't, you'll feel guilty.  With 
less ham-handed direction and a more honest script, this could have been 
a wonderful movie.  Could have been.</P>
<P>MEN OF HONOR runs 2:09.  It is rated R for language but also contains 
scary and gory scenes of diving accidents.  It would be acceptable for 
teenagers.</P>
