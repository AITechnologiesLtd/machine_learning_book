"The Wedding Singer" Sings a Familiar Tune
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>Meet Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler), a cloyingly good-natured man.  He is
the typical small-town boy with small dreams.  He wants to settle down
in his hometown and marry his high school sweetheart.  Once a lead
singer for his garage rock band, he now works as a wedding singer.  He
possesses charm and knows how to put a positive spin on any festive
occasion...that is until he is left standing alone at the altar.</P>
<P>He is now miserable and vents his frustration at wedding guests by
lamenting about life and singing songs like "Love Stinks".  But he
does find comfort with Julia (Drew Barrymore), a waitress that works
at the reception hall where he sings.  Julia's life, however, is
equally miserable.  Engaged to a wealthy but low-life jerk that seems
more interested in himself, she questions whether he's the 'one'.
Eventually, their misery brings them together and then...well, you
know.</P>
<P>But their path to happiness (and ours) is not without a few obstacles.
Robbie's financee wants another chance.  Julia's mother doesn't want
her to marry a wedding singer.  Julia's sister becomes attracted to
him.  Conversations are misconstrued.  And the scriptwriter goes to
great pains to keep them apart.  We know that they'll get together
long before they finally realize that they're even attracted to one
another.  In fact, it's my guess that the movie bigwigs knew that
there wasn't much meat in this movie.  So, to compensate, they added
another comical element, where the story is set in the '80s and ample
opportunities are created to poke fun at this era.  </P>
<P>For example, one of Robbie's band members dresses like Boy George; one
of Robbie's friends wears the trademark red, leather jacket and white
glove like Michael Jackson.  And there are allusions to the future
which elicited a few chuckles.  At one point, a women looks at Robbie
and Julia and says, "I can just tell when people will be together
forever...just like Donald and Ivana; Burt and Loni."  There's even a
cameo by Billy Idol.</P>
<P>But whether you like this movie or not will depend on two things.  The
first is whether you like Adam Sandler.  As a comedian and jokester,
he's fun to watch.  But he doesn't show the heft here to be a leading
man.  Drew Barrymore is levels above him.  She is a delight to watch,
but you begin to wonder what she's doing with a wedding singer...or what
she's even doing in this movie.  The second is whether you're a child of
the 80s.  If you are, then you can appreciate some of the cultural humor
and the all-80s soundtrack.  If you aren't, then this won't be a very
pleasant experience.  I, however, am a child of the 80s and thoroughly
enjoyed Barrymore's performance.  "The Wedding Singer" was flat some of
the times, but at other times, managed to hit the right notes.</P>
