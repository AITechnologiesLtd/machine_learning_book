<P>     Spike Lee's new comedy is a disjointed disaster that starts bad and
stays there.  Theresa Randle (BAD BOYS) plays an aspiring New York
actress who takes a phone-sex job as a way to make ends meet.  Soon, the
job becomes an adventure that, I think, is supposed to go something like
this:  girl excels at job, girl gets addicted to job, girl goes cold
turkey from job, and girl grows from having job.  Lee, who continues to
beat to a very different drummer, never makes this progression very
clear.  He's too busy inserting extraneous dream sequences and grainy
footage of the various male callers.  (One of the few funny bits has
Randle imagining herself as blaxploitation heroine Foxy Brown.  Shut
your mouth!) A steady stream of Prince plays on the soundtrack, while a
steady stream of cameos (Quentin, Madonna, Naomi, etc.) play before the
camera, and it all adds up to nothing.  Forget the Oscars; boycott this
movie!</P>
