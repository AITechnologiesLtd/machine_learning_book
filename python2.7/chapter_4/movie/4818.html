<PRE>                                 FRENCH TWIST
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     The French title of this odd little film is GAZON MAUDIT, a French
euphemism meaning "dyke."  Any wonder why the title was changed for the
American audience?</P>
<P>     This picture, starring the radiant and naked-most-of-the-time
Victoria Abril (TIE ME UP! TIE ME DOWN! and HIGH HEELS), is a
schizophrenic tour of Loli's (Abril) life.  Her philandering husband
Laurent (Alain Chabat) walks all over her.  The kids are a constant
effort.  And when Marijo (Josiane Balasko, who co-wrote and directed as
well), a butchest-of-the-butch lesbian, shows up owing to car trouble, a
sudden bond of friendship is formed.  When Laurent's dalliances finally go
too far, Loli finds comfort in the arms...and the bed...and even the
bathtub of Marijo.</P>
<P>     So that's the titular "twist."  And as a premise, it's not a bad
one.  Balasko's performance is exactly what was required to make the
plausibility of the petite and erotic Abril fall for the decidedly
non-petite and non-erotic Balasko.  But after a brief (and fun) setup and
payoff, the film rambles into a roller coaster of "does she or doesn't
she" want to stay with her new lifestyle, followed by one false ending
after another.  The film finally finishes up on a sudden note that is
totally confusing, suggesting further "twists on the twist," and by this
time, the picture is so silly that any attempt at resolving this whole
thing wanders into pointlessness.</P>
<P>     Abril's performance is great, as usual, reminding us of her days with
director Pedro Almodovar, and as mentioned above, Balasko is a very
capable actress.  Unfortunately, it appears she had a hand in too many
things, as the script just falls apart at random places, becoming either
too busy and hard-to-follow or too boring and hard-to-stay awake. 
Balasko's use of sex jokes is unrelenting (and no one is safe from her
good-natured ribbing), but these too get old after the hundredth time.</P>
<P>     In the final analysis, FRENCH TWIST is extremely muddled and feels
much longer than its 107 minute running time.  Fortunately, it has a few
bright spots, including Balasko's subtle message about the cultural double
standard between men and women, that will make it worthwhile for the
viewer that is truly willing to be patient.</P>
