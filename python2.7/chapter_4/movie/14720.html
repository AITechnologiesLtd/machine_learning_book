Susan Granger's review of A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY (Paramount Pictures)</PRE>
<P>        This clunky, clueless comedy is aimed directly at the
"Saturday Night Live" crowd, as producer Lorne Michaels takes a simple
skit and fashions a full-length feature, directed by John
Fortenberry. Will Ferrell and Chris Katten play two socially inept,
dumb-and-dumber losers whose heads bop in unison to the catchy
Haddaway song "What is Love?" Not that they know much about it, of
course, since most of their time is spent babe-watching. Sadly, no
"hottie" (their name for attractive members of the female gender) will
even acknowledge their stares and they certainly couldn't get in the
door of the exclusive nightclub, the Roxbury. Think Studio 54. Or
could they? On such a trivial premise, an entire film has been
constructed.  Dan Hedaya is their gruff father, who owns a
fake-flowers shop in Beverly Hills, while Loni Anderson, as their
plastic surgery-addicted mom, flashes what appear to be huge,
collagen-enhanced lips. Chazz Palmintieri plays the paranoid club
owner (wisely without billing) and Richard Grieco appears as the
Butabi brothers' favorite celebrity, not much of a stretch. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "A Night at the Roxbury" is a goofy,
tepid 3 - about two silly, senseless simpletons.</P>
