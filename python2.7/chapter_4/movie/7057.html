<PRE>                                  KOLYA
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: KOLYA has a safe-bet plot: a fifty-
          five-year-old bachelor suddenly reluctantly
          inheriting a son.  After he stops fighting it,  he
          finds parenthood fulfilling an emptiness in his
          life.  The familiar plot is made somewhat more
          interesting by being set in a Czechoslovakia while
          Soviet rule is crumbling.  If the plot is
          unambiguous, at least the film is well-photographed
          and has a good score and the screenplay by Zdenek
          Sverak (who also stars) is frequently touching.
          Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4).
          New York Critics:  positive: 7, negative: 0, mixed

<P>     Frantisek Louka (played by Zdenek Sverak) is a fifty-five-year-old
Bohemian--both figuratively and literally.  He plays the cello for the
Czech Philharmonic when he can, plays for funerals when he must to make
ends meet, and supplements his meager income by performing cosmetic
maintenance on gravestones.  He still retains some of his good looks so
that he can still womanize.  His only responsibility in life is
occasionally taking care of his mother.  But times are hard in 1988
Prague and he has to look for money where he can.  That was how he
learned of Nadezda (Irena Livanova) an attractive Russian woman looking
for a technical husband so that she can establish Czech citizenship.
She is willing to pay well and reluctantly Frantisek agrees to marry
her for one night.  Even then she disappears into the night, escaping
to West Germany and leaving her son Kolya (Andrej Chalimon) with his
grandmother.  Frantisek is pleased that the incident is over when
suddenly the grandmother suffers a stroke and Kolya has to go to live
with his new stepfather, Frantisek</P>
<P>     This year's nominee for Best Foreign Language film from the Czech
Republic is a nice amiable movie that has been done many times before
in several different languages.  A bachelor finds he has inherited a
five- year-old.  At first the child is a monumental inconvenience and
the man wants to see the boy gone.  But of course they learn to love
each other and then have to struggle to stay together. .  The old man
and the boy go through much the sort of relationship that has been
shown so often before.  We have the scenes of the father's sex life
being interrupted by the presence of the child.  There is the requisite
sequence of the child getting sick and the father worrying over him.
It would be nice to accept this film as a creative entry from Eastern
Europe, but so much of the film is predictable and taken up with
sequences that have become hackneyed that one has to start faulting the
film for this lack of originality.  KOLYA is too much like THREE MEN
AND A CRADLE/BABY, KRAMER VS. KRAMER, BABY BOOM or LITTLE MISS MARKER-
-with minor variations in each case.  The plot has an irresponsible
adult reluctantly forced into a parental role discovering what he (or
she) has been missing all these years.  It is at heart an affirmation
of parenthood that pretty much cannot fail to win the favor of the
audience.</P>
<P>     Where this film gets much of its novelty is in the political
climate of Czechoslovakia in 1988.  Nearly everyone in Eastern Europe
had an intense hatred of anything Russian.  Frantisek has to hide the
fact that Kolya is Russian.  Even Frantisek's mother does not want the
boy in her house when she discovers that he is Russian.  Frantisek in
talking to the boy compares his inability to get rid of the boy with
his country's inability to rid itself of the Russian occupiers.  We get
some idea of why the Russians are so hated by seeing the Soviet Police
and their interrogation of Frantisek when they believe he has married
Nadezda to get around the law.  Our last scene with the two policemen
makes the single most striking irony of the film.</P>
<P>     KOLYA was directed and co-produced by thirty-one-year-old Jan
Sverak.  He is the son of Zdenek Sverak, who plays Frantisek.  Zdenek
co-authored the screenplay.  He is well-cast as Frantisek, still having
much of the verve of his youth but matching it with distinguished good
looks.  One could believe that at fifty-five this man could still
fascinate a string of lovers. Andrej Chalimon is, of course, an
adorable child with a round face and big eyes.  He perhaps cries a
little, understandably, but he never seems to have the sort of bad-
behavior days that real children seem to have.  He is just a bit too
perfect.  Such children do exist, of course, but after what this child
has been through it seems unlikely that Kolya would still be one.
There are a number of attractive paramours for Frantisek, but the sex
is never explicit.  In general this film is a bit too likable and neat.
This is good entertainment rather than good art.  Overall I would rate
it a high +1 on the - 4 to +4 scale.</P>
