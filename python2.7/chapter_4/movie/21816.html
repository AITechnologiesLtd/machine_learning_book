<P>In a review of "The House on Haunted Hill", I stated that Hollywood was slowly
growing devoid of original ideas. I stand corrected. "Being John Malkovich" has
been called the most original movie of the year by some, but I disagree. It is
the most original movie of the decade. If it had only been trimmed down some
from its 112 minute running time, I would have happily granted it a full five
star rating.</P>
<P>Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is master of his profession, but it's not a
profession appreciated by the general public. Craig, is a puppeteer. His wife,
Lotte (an almost unrecognizable Cameron Diaz), is a pet store owner who is
supportive of Craig, but feels he should try something new until his career as
a puppeteer takes off. So Craig aquires a job as a filing clerk on the 7 1/2
floor of a downtown office building. Here he meets Maxine (Catherine Keener), a
woman he is immediately smitten with. Maxine has no interest in Craig, but when
Craig discovers a tiny door behind a filing cabinet which leads into John
Malkovich's brain, Maxine partners with him to create a business where one can
buy a ticket for 200 dollars to be John Malkovich for fifteen minutes.</P>
<P>Due to the unusual plot at work here, my summary cannot possibly do the film
justice. Suffice to say that nothing like this has been made since Lewis
Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland" was turned into a film. In fact, I think
Charlie Kaufman owes quite a debt to Lewis Carroll, and was disappointed at not
seeing his name in the credits as a "special thanks to" mention. Still, I
personally believe that this film deserves a special oscar from the academy
come award time.</P>
<P>The script, which is clearly the high point here, is backed up by such
fantastic performances from the cast that I would be shocked if there were not
at least one oscar nomination amongst them. John Cusack is perfect as the
constantly haggard looking Craig, and Cameron Diaz is hysterical as a woman who
so loves her pet store that she brings all the pets home with her (the
apartment in which they live is filled with iguanas and chimps). However, the
real standout performance here comes from John Malkovich, playing an
exaggerated version of himself. How the man was convinced to play such a
self-effacing role is beyond me.</P>
<P>One last point which deserves mention, is the very brief, but fantastic
appearance by Charlie Sheen as Malkovich's best friend. If there is one man in
Hollywood who really needs a jump-start to his career, it's Sheen, and this
might just do it. His hair, by the way, at the end of the film, has to be seen
to be believed. Also watch for Brad Pitt's quick appearance, which involves him
doing nothing but making an amusing facial expression. As stated, "Being John
Malkovich" runs a little too long, but don't let this stop you from seeing the
most original movie in ages. I give it a well earned four and a half stars, and
a full recommendation.</P>
