REMEMBER THE TITANS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>"In Virginia, high school football is a way of life," Coach Yoast's 
daughter Cheryl (Hayden Panettiere) explains to us in the introduction.  
"It's bigger than Christmas Day."   REMEMBER THE TITANS tells a 
heart-warming, true story about a championship high school football team 
in 1971.  Set against a background of racial strife when the Virginia 
high schools were starting to integrate, the movie rises several notches 
above what we've come to expect in sports movies.</P>
<P>Boaz Yakin  (A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES), working from a funny and moving 
script by first-time writer Gregory Allen Howard, directs the movie with 
the same precision and passion demanded of the football players in it.  
The biggest reason for its success, however, is another marvelous 
performance by Denzel Washington (HURRICANE) as Coach Boone, the new 
head coach of the just integrated T.C. Williams High Titans.  Always 
intense, Coach Boone is at once humorous and insufferable.  Most of all, 
Coach Boone is a winner who is willing to drive his team way past normal 
limits of pain and endurance.</P>
<P>As the ex-head coach, the dedicated but more compassionate Coach Yoast 
(Will Patton) agrees to stay on as Coach Boone's defensive coach as a 
way to keep harmony among the team and keep his white players from 
quitting in protest over his resignation.</P>
<P>Having played high school football in Texas under a similarly fanatical 
coach to Coach Boone, albeit a white one, I can identify with inhuman 
practices in order to win state championships.  After you win them, it's 
easy to forget the insanity required in practice to become the best.  In 
the movie, the coach puts the team through everything from 3 a.m. runs 
in the woods to forcing dehydrated players to continue to practice 
without benefit of water.  The movie, to its credit, doesn't try to 
smooth off the rough edges of Boone's prickly personality or make his 
hard-work fanaticism seem easy to follow.</P>
<P>Much is made in the script of the difficulty of integrating the team so 
that they play as one.  The animosity between the races starts out so 
high that it looks like they will never gel as a team.  One key white 
player even brags that he will "miss" some blocks when the blacks are 
running.  Rather than beating us to death over the head with the race 
issue in Oliver Stone fashion, the movie uses a blend of extremely funny 
comedy and sharply written drama.</P>
<P>The blacks in town look to Coach Boone as a savior, something he tries 
to downplay.  "I'm not Jesus Christ, Martin Luther King or the Easter 
Bunny," he tells an adoring crowd of blacks.  "I'm just a football 
coach."  Modesty, however, isn't an attribute that the coach 
demonstrates often, pushing himself as hard as he does his players.  He 
is tough on all races, arguing that to act otherwise is to do them a 
disservice.  Again and again, you have to be in awe of Washington's 
incredible talent as an actor.  I have no idea how great the real-life 
Coach Boone was, but surely his gift was nothing in comparison to 
Washington's, who brings so much charisma and drive to his every role.</P>
<P>Parts of the film, as when the team sings "Ain't No Mountain High 
Enough," are reminiscent of many other sports movies, especially THE 
REPLACEMENTS.  Some, however, are surprises, especially the little gay 
humor thrown in with just the right amount of ambiguity.  </P>
<P>Of several subplots, the best involves the two 9-year-old daughters of 
the two coaches.  Coach Yoast's daughter, Cheryl, lives and breathes 
football.  She is the team's number one fan and likes to offer strategy 
suggestions.  In contrast, Coach Boone's daughter, Nicky (Krysten Leigh 
Jones), likes dolls.  Cheryl says that Nicky "plays" with them, but 
Nicky corrects her, saying that she "accessorizes" them.  Although the 
movie's epilogue talks about what great friends the two real-life 
coaches became, it's hard to see their girls ever really overcoming the 
differences in their interests.</P>
<P>The football action is filmed up close so that it's hard to follow the 
game at other than a gut level.  The editing is fast paced, and the 
football hits are punishingly hard so that the movie does pump up your 
adrenaline.  Even if the filming of the action isn't quite what it could 
be, it is more than adequate to tell the story.  </P>
<P>By the end, we've had an entertaining, good time and have been moved by 
a fascinating story.  With a musical score of surprisingly sweeping 
grandeur, REMEMBER THE TITANS is a wonderful film that is much better 
than we have any right to expect.  Whatever you do, don't leave before 
the epilogue that tells what happened in real life to the coaches and 
many of the key players.</P>
<P>REMEMBER THE TITANS runs 1:53.  It is rated PG for thematic elements and 
some language and would be a great film for the entire family.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, and his twin friends, Steven and John, both 12, 
loved the movie, giving it ****, **** and *** 1/2 respectively.  They 
all mentioned how much they liked the story, especially the parts at the 
football preseason boot camp.  They found the film quite funny.</P>
