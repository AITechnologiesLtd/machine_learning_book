<PRE>Lord Love A Duck (1966) 104m</PRE>
<P>After half an hour of viewing this cult comedy you may feel a little 
disappointed that it fails to live up to the wackiness of its opening 
scenes.  But, like me, you may also find it easier viewing the second time 
around - after all, maintaining the high energy of its first few minutes for 
over an hour and a half is a difficult undertaking for any film.  Director 
George Axelrod probably chooses the right road: the main function of LORD 
LOVE A DUCK's daffy (no pun intended) opening is to set us up for the 
offbeat story which follows while also allowing various bits of weird 
nonsense to be dropped in here and there without having them feel jarringly 
out of place.</P>
<P>Roddy McDowall is a high-school genius who gives himself the nickname 
Mollymauk, after a type of albatross.  He surprises young Tuesday Weld one 
night and, with no explanation, immediately sets himself up as her mentor, 
protector, provider, and personal djinn.  He sets events into motion that 
make her wishes come true, but then whimsically creates minor obstacles 
which he in turn whole-heartedly sets about overcoming.  It's a strange 
relationship.  At the film's conclusion, McDowall (who has been relating the 
story in flashback) states emphatically that he did it all "for love".  The 
first time I saw LORD LOVE A DUCK I found this abrupt ending a little hard 
to swallow - especially since one of the wishes he grants Weld is marriage 
to a wealthy high school Senior.  Forewarned in the second viewing, it's 
apparent that there could be no logical reason for McDowall's behavior 
anyway, so settling for a motive as irrational as love is as good a reason 
as any.  I'm still not convinced, though: I think it's more likely that 
McDowall, as a genius, is terribly lonely and simply wants to share his 
perspective of the world with someone he has an interest in.  He represents 
himself to Weld by two symbols of freedom - birds and keys.  He even goes so 
far as to hypnotize Weld with keys, frequently dangling them in front of her 
face to establish himself as her personal liberator.  McDowall already has 
freedom - his superior intellect and physical prowess (he takes care of the 
school bruiser without getting his feathers ruffled) enable him to do pretty 
much whatever he wishes.  Choreographing Weld's life keeps him occupied 
until her desires are almost completely fulfilled, upon which he finds 
himself back where he started and can only respond by running amok.</P>
<P>The McDowall/Weld relationship is set against a satirical background which 
is just as odd as they are.  Their high school has become ludicrously 
'progressive' under the leadership of principal Harvey Korman (it's unusual 
to see him with black hair!); they make a deal with a movie producer who 
specializes in quickie Beach Party films; and while McDowall's family is 
absent throughout the film, Weld's parents are only half present - her 
mother picks up men in bars, and her father, who makes a memorable 
appearance in one of the film's most manic scenes, seems about two steps 
away from the booby hatch.  If that wasn't enough, Ruth Gordon also turns up 
halfway through the story as the mother of Weld's boyfriend.  It's another 
of her acerbic, domineering roles, in which she constantly berates her son 
for his failed suicide attempts (it's actually MacDowall who's cheerfully 
trying to knock him off!) and breezes through every scene as if she owns it. 
  LORD LOVE A DUCK is something of a grab-bag - it doesn't have something 
for everyone, but anyone with an interest in 60s cinema should give it a 
try.  There are probably more insights about the story and its characters in 
Al Hine's novel, if you can ever find a copy.</P>
