What Planet are you from?</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Admittedly, I love Garry Shandling. For those of you who don't appreciate
his wry sense of humor and constipation-faced guise; well, probably you're
better off missing this one.</P>
<P>But for those to whom the name Garry Shandling means nothing, go see it.
It's funny. It's light-hearted, and best of all you'll leave the theater
feeling good.</P>
<P>Oh, one more warning: There's quite a bit of comedic play on
not-necessarily-flattering male/female stereotypes. But remember this is a
comedy. And of course, there's the sexual humor. But again, this is a film
about an alien (Shandling) who comes to Earth with one mission and one
mission only ... impregnate an earthling woman.</P>
<P>That said, one might expect a silly script of "Mel Brooks" quality starring
unknowns or at best B-comics. The great thing about "What Planet are you
from?" is that it stars high-powered actors like Bening and Kinnear. And
Shandling's just as strong. Not only that, but the script is sharper,
cleaner and oddly has a lot of heart: Bustin' your gut while still managing
to tighten up your throat.</P>
<PRE>I liked it a lot.</PRE>
