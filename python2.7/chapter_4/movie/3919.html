                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     A general rule of summer film watching is to beware any August 
release featuring a major star.  The only reason for a distributor to 
hold back such a production is a lack of faith in the picture's ability 
to succeed in the highly-competitive early season, and that's usually an 
indication of a poor movie.  Denzel Washington is a big box office draw, 
and Paramount's decision to strand his latest, VIRTUOSITY, in the August 
marketplace isn't a vote of confidence.  Their uncertainty is well-
founded.  About the best thing that can be said about VIRTUOSITY is that 
it's director Brett Leonard's most impressive effort to date -- but 
considering that his previous features were the awful LAWNMOWER MAN and 
HIDEAWAY, such a statement is damning with faint praise. </P>
<P>     The villain of the piece is Sid 6.7 (Russell Crowe), a "nanotech 
synthetic organism" with the combined personality of hundreds of serial 
killers.  Somewhere in his programmed mind are the psyches of Hitler, 
Jack the Ripper, Charles Manson, and the sadist responsible for the 
death of our hero's wife and daughter.  That hero is ex-cop Parker 
Barnes (Washington), who's serving time behind bars because he shot a 
few innocent bystanders in his quest to exterminate his family's 
murderer.  Now, through Sid 6.7, he gets a chance to redeem himself -- 
eliminate Sid and he can clear his record and his conscience. </P>
<P>     The problem with this film is not the star.  Despite slumming in a 
picture far below the quality of his normal fare, Washington is still 
the best thing about VIRTUOSITY.  In fact, he injects some much needed 
energy into the proceedings.  Australian actor Russell Crowe is an 
adequate bad guy, although his Sid 6.7 lacks the vicious intensity with 
which Crowe imbued his ROMPER STOMPER skinhead.  Kelly Lynch, who plays 
Barnes' criminal psychologist partner, is dreadful -- and I'm not just 
talking about her hairdo.  We could care less what happens to her 
character.  At least we're spared a romance between her and Barnes. </P>
<P>     VIRTUOSITY's failing is its plot.  What passes for a storyline is 
part recycled formula and part incomprehensible technobabble.  The film 
blunders along, usually making very little sense, waiting for the next 
(of many) action scenes.  Generally, these are well choreographed, even 
though they're familiar:  car chases, rooftop fist-fights and shootouts, 
and a child-in-danger scenario.  There's little in the way of 
originality.  Virtual reality (where Sid gets his start before crossing 
into our world) is rapidly becoming an overused motion picture plot 
device.   </P>
<P>     As was true of Sandra Bullock in THE NET, carrying VIRTUOSITY falls 
on Washington's shoulders.  For what it's worth, he makes the movie 
watchable.  Ultimately, however, he has little to work with in this 
dreary, film-by-numbers flick -- even RICOCHET offered more substance.  
Nevertheless, given Washington's presence and the promise of a virtual 
reality action story, VIRTUOSITY has some appeal -- provided, of course, 
the viewers aren't selective.   </P>
