<P>"Hurricane Streets," which won an unprecedented three 1997 Sundance Film 
Festival awards, for Best Director, Best Cinematography, and the 
Audience Award, is one of the most accurate films about teenagers I've 
seen in a while.</P>
<P>Marcus (Brendan Sexton III), who lives in the East Village in NYC with 
his grandmother, is about to turn fifteen, and spends his day stealing 
petty things from stores with his friends. His mother is in prison, and 
he hopes that for his birthday, his father will send him a plane ticket 
so he can visit him in New Mexico. While selling some CD's that he has 
stolen to a bunch of young kids, he meets a 14-year-old girl, Melena 
(Isidra Vega), and they quickly become friends, much to the disapproval 
of her abusive father. To his surprise, Marcus finally does get the 
ticket to go to New Mexico, but his hopes begin to diminish when he 
discovers some secrets that his mother has been hiding from him. </P>
<P>Although the story is occasionally a little bleak, at its center is the 
sweet, gentle love story between Marcus and Melena, played marvelously 
by Brendan Sexton III (1996's brilliant, "Welcome to the Dollhouse) and 
newcomer Isidra Vega. To prove that the screenplay is so well-written 
and unpredictable, director Morgan J. Freeman (not to be confused with 
the actor) does not include exploitation and sex to their relationship, 
which is what a typical film would have done, but relies more on the 
realism of being 15 and in love. </P>
<P>One of the pleasures of, "Hurricane Streets," is watching all of the 
characters interact with each other, which is basically what the film is 
about. There is no particular storyline, because it would have put a 
damper on the effectiveness of the relationships. Watching it, I was 
surprised by how completely uncliched the film was. Since Marcus is a 
teenage thief, the banal thing to do would to simply make him act tough 
and uncaring. Instead, Marcus is a kid with a pretty good head on his 
shoulders. He does not do drugs, is not promiscuous, but does have the 
insecurities that teens his age have, and has a very good relationship 
with his grandmother, who owns a bar.</P>
<P>"Hurricane Streets," did not, or rarely, step wrong until the very 
ending, which abruptly ends while in midstream, as if the final ten 
minutes had never been shot. A great many twists and revelations comes 
during the climax, but they are not solved, and I cared so much for the 
two main characters of Marcus and Melena that I desperately wanted to 
see what would happen next. Maybe this is just a sign of an exceptional 
film, since I got so involved in it, but the conclusion could have been 
better.</P>
<P>What came before the end, however, was masterfully written and memorably 
performed. An added bonus was briefly seeing Heather Matarazzo (also of, 
"Welcome to the Dollhouse), one of the best young actresses working 
today, as Vega's friend, Ashley. "Hurricane Streets," is a gritty, 
highly impressive directing debut by Morgan J. Freeman, and I greatly 
look forward to seeing his next film called, "Desert Blue," which is due 
out in 1999, and stars Sexton III, Christina Ricci, Casey Affleck, Sara 
Gilbert, among others. To get so many talents in only your second 
picture is a sign of a talented director.</P>
