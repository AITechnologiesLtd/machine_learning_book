<P>Sure, "The Sixth Sense" has its share of clichés, but it is also one of the 
more original and thought-provoking horror dramas to appear in years.  If 
you use movies purely for entertainment, then this one is not for you.</P>
<P>Young writer and director M. Night Shyamalan paces the story well, with a 
romantic opening scene followed by a tense scene upon which the weight of 
the movie eventually rests.  In fact the movie has a habit of calming the 
viewer with a slow scene - though never a boring one - followed by a 
sequence that is fast-paced or even harrowing.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis has chosen his part well this time.  He plays Dr. Malcolm 
Crowe, a Philadelphia-based child psychologist who has just received an 
award from the mayor's office.  Apparently he has put everything in his life 
second to his career, and perhaps he and wife Anna (Olivia Williams) will 
grow closer now.  Enter the harrowing scene.  Upstairs, Anna discovers a 
broken window and articles of clothing shed in a path to the bathroom.  
Malcolm peers inside to see a violently disturbed man wearing only a pair of 
briefs.  Shivering, this stranger confronts Malcolm, crying out "You failed 
me!" and revealing himself as a former patient of Malcolm's.  Played 
convincingly by Donnie Wahlberg, this intruder raises a pistol and shoots 
Malcolm, and then turns the gun on himself.</P>
<P>The next scene opens "The Next Fall," a long shot of a tree-lined street of 
South Philly rowhouses filling the frame.  We see Malcolm spying on a boy 
about nine years old.  This boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is troubled 
with a variety of symptoms.  The first scene between doctor and patient 
happens in an empty Catholic church, Cole lining up his toy figures in one 
of the pews.  The relationship continues with a small degree of reluctance 
on Cole's part:  he does not wish to reveal his "secret," that which lies at 
the heart of his being afraid.</P>
<P>We know from the salvos of trailers that Cole sees "dead people."  He has a 
bizarre knack of knowing the history of the old building in which he attends 
school.  He knows, and reveals in anger, the nickname of his teacher.  What 
seems to be troubling Cole more than the visions themselves is his inability 
to cope with them.  His loving single mom Lynn (Toni Collette) tolerates the 
boy's vagaries, and prays they will get along on her two jobs.  Meanwhile, 
Dr. Malcolm Crowe continues to meet with Cole and, it seems, always visits 
Cole for these meetings; we never see the psychologist's office.</P>
<P>Viewing this movie I found the subplot between Malcolm and Anna Crowe to be 
scant and rather unsatisfying.  There's the scene in which Malcolm arrives 
late at a fancy restaurant, and Anna ignores him, paying for her dinner and 
whispering, "Happy Anniversary, Malcolm" before she leaves him sitting 
there.  Later Malcolm seems oddly detached when a younger man from Anna's 
workplace begins to show interest in her.  To what is this all leading?</P>
<P>Some of the most chilling scenes in memory surface in Cole's hauntings.  He 
is petrified of the ghost that confront him;  they have even physically 
abused him in their anger.  One early teenage boy walks out of Cole's room 
and beckons Cole to follow, saying, "C'mon, I'll show you where my dad keeps 
his guns."  When he turns around we see the bloody pulp of the back of his 
head.  To what is all this leading?</P>
<P>Both plots are headed toward an ending that will shock you and cause you to 
think for hours afterward.</P>
<P>One of the reasons the movie succeeds is Haley Joel Osment.  This 
experienced young actor seems to have his own special method of making his 
character believable.  When he crawls into the makeshift tent in his room - 
his refuge filled with stolen holy statues - the horrid nightmares of 
childhood flood back to us, too.  In fact this boy possesses an amazing 
endurance, hiding the heart of his affliction from his mother, postponing 
telling his doctor until a moment after the doctor tells his own secrets to 
the boy.  An Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor would not be out of 
order for Osment.</P>
<P>And perhaps a Best Actor Nomination should come for Willis.  He shows 
admirable restraint here, as in the scene where he comes home to an immense 
empty house, climbs the stairs to the bedroom to find Anna in the shower.  
Turning slightly he spots a bottle of Zoloft anti-depressant in the medicine 
cabinet.  He is surprised, and apparently so numbed that he merely drifts 
out of the room and the house.  In no place does Willis overact or deliver 
an unconvincing response.</P>
<P>Olivia Williams is poignant as Anna Crowe, although the script calls for 
her, necessarily, only a few times.  (Williams is, I might point out, a good 
ten years or so younger than Willis, continuing Hollywood's trend of young 
woman/older man…)  As Cole's mother Lynn, Toni Collette gets more screen 
time, and comes off as a realistic, confused parent.  Especially moving is 
her reaction when Cole finally reveals what's up with him.</P>
<P>The film is full of various types of imagery, many of the scenes opening 
with shots of statues and sculptures around Philadelphia.  Add this to the 
somewhat gothic houses and school buildings inhabited by the characters - 
living and dead - and the effect is fascinatingly morbid.  The location 
scouts did their jobs well, and I'm sure Willis felt at home during the 
shooting, only a few miles distant from his native Pennsgrove, across the 
river in South Jersey.  I was also struck by the original use of videos in 
the story, in the recurring wedding tape watched by Anna, as well as the 
tape that acts as a revelation to a grieving father.</P>
<P>Sidney the psychiatrist in the television version of "MASH" said once that 
the real battlefields are the kitchen, the bedroom, the school yard, and 
that's what we see here, characters valiantly facing the wars that uproot 
their lives.  The devastation here is all in the mind, and M. Night 
Shyamalan - who appears in a cameo as Dr. Hill, who suspects Lynn of abusing 
Cole - manipulates both the medium and the genre with expertise.</P>
