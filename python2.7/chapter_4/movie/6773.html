<PRE>                             SOME MOTHER'S SON
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     SOME MOTHER'S SON is a new film about the troubles in Northern
Ireland.  It is blessed with the same producers (Jim Sheridan and
Arthur Lappin), writers (Jim Sheridan and Terry George), and much of
the same supporting cast as 1993's highly acclaimed film IN THE NAME OF
THE FATHER.  Two of the leads (Helen Mirren and John Lynch) starred in
1984's excellent film CAL.  All three of the pictures cover the same
period and all three suffer from the same bias, but, nevertheless, they
are all excellent movies -- taut dramas with high energy and important
stories to tell.</P>
<P>     In the press kit is the question: "Could you stand by and watch
your son starve himself to death for his beliefs?"  This correctly sets
the context for the film which looks at the Northern Ireland issues
from the point of view of the mothers of IRA members.  The story uses
two quite different mothers as the focal points.  The first, Kathleen
Quigley (Mirren), believes in non-violence, and although she supports
her son, she hates the terrorist precepts of the IRA.  The other, Annie
Higgins (Fionnula Flanagan), is a card-carrying member who is willing
to do whatever it takes to get the British out of Northern Ireland.
Both actresses are well cast and give marvelous performances.</P>
<P>     The story, based on a true incident, starts in 1979.  The film
opens with a vintage clip of newly elected Prime Minister Thatcher.  "I
would particularly like to remember," she says.  "some words of Saint
Francis of Assisi which are pertinent now.  'Where there is discord,
may we bring harmony.'" From there we cut to a scene in which
lower-level British bureaucrats are formulating a malevolent strategy
toward the IRA.  "We want to make the prisons an asset, not a
liability," says Farnsworth (Tom Hollander).  "It is in the prisons
that we will break the backs of the IRA."</P>
<P>     One of the keys to the success of the film is the editing by Craig
McKay.  He has a deft touch, knowing when to cut between the three
stories: the British government planners, the prisoners, and the two
mothers.  North Ireland home life is full of happiness and warm
Christmas images.  From this peaceful normality we switch to the
mothers' boys in terrorist attacks, killing the British.</P>
<P>     As in most shows about Northern Ireland, the British are portrayed
as people who are evil incarnate and who are constantly scheming on how
to oppress the Irish Catholics.  With the exception of a single scene,
SOME MOTHER'S SON makes the death of the British appear as remote and
painless as shooting targets in a video game.  In contrast we are
treated to large doses of Irish suffering.  There is a great scene in
the show where Catholic priest Father Daly (Gerard McSorley) prays not
only for the IRA member who died in a hunger strike but also the
British officials killed to avenge his death.  The IRA members view his
sermonette as heresy and walk out from the church in protest.</P>
<P>     The only other voice of reason in the show comes from Kathleen.
"A man was shot," she tells her friend, Bobby Sands (Lynch).  "But he
was a soldier," explains Bobby.  He views shooting them in the back as
not the same thing as killing an actual human.</P>
<P>     Soon her son Gerald (Aidan Gillen) and Annie's son Frank (David
O'Hara) are tried for various terrorist activities.  "I don't need a
lawyer," says defiant Gerald.  "I'm not a criminal.  I'm a prisoner of
war.  I don't recognize the court."  Once in prison they join Bobby
Sands and others there in various protests ranging from not wearing
prison clothes to the hunger strike that costs ten of them their lives.</P>
<P>     The prison officials try everything to get them to put their
uniforms on, including removing the can where their human wastes go.
The prisoners protest this by lining the walls of their cells with
their excrement.</P>
<P>     The movie manages to provide the facts without trying to gross out
the audience.  The wrenching of hunger protesters as they near death
provides the most horrific scenes in the film, but this is not a movie
that scares you; it is one that moves you to compassion for the mothers
and their plight.  Secondarily, it makes you sympathetic to the
prisoners, no matter how heinous their original crimes.  The director,
Terry George, knows how to lay the tension on thick.  This is a show
that will keep your eyes glued to the screen as the events unfold.</P>
<P>     When the editor cuts back to the government officials, it provides
almost comic relief as they are so inept.  One of the officials, a man
named Harrington (Tim Woodward), wants to be in charge of spin control.
He insists they must change strategies only because "we need to reclaim
the moral high ground."  Morals are relegated to the role of political
battle techniques.</P>
<P>     The performances by Mirren and Flanagan get better and better as
the show evolves.  As might be expected, Kathleen and Annie go from
distrust to friendship, and Kathleen becomes hardened by the conditions
she sees.  All of the mothers have it in their power with the signing
of a single document to have their sons fed intravenously and thereby
save their lives.  The sons are against this, wanting to be martyrs for
the cause.  Even if you know how it ends, I didn't, you will be swept
up into the circumstances that lead to the conclusion.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the mothers' entire state of mind can be summed up in one
of the interchanges close to the end of the picture.  Annie tells the
government official, "My son is not a terrorist."  The official looks
her sternly in the eye, and corrects her with, "Your son is a convicted
murderer."</P>
<P>     SOME MOTHER'S SON runs 1:51.  It is rated R for scenes of people
starving to death, for some violence, and for profanity.  The show
would be fine for mature teenagers.  I recommend this excellent film to
you and give it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
