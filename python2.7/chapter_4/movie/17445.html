<PRE>Antz
Rated: PG (for stupidity)
Reviewed by Fox Davidson</PRE>
<P>  Their little, smart, and hard working.  They have many of the characteristics
of humans.  They're...Ugly!  I watched this movie expecting cute, wide-eyed
Disney-esque ants on the screen.  Instead, I got vomit-colored, big-mouthed,
dwarf-mutant ants running amoke.  Not only that, they happened to have the same
voices as major Hollywood stars, including Woody Allen and Sharon Stone. 
Someone save me from a sequel!
  The film begins with Z (Allen) tired of being a worker all his life for the
colony he lives at.  The colony is run by a King and Queen, and their princess
daughter, Bala (Stone).  The first 10 minutes or so of Antz is Z moaning and
groaning over how pathetic he is and that he was never able to lift more than
ten times his own body weight.  Oh brother.  If I wanted to listen to Woody
Allen complain, I would have rented Hannah and Her Sisters (one of Allen's
lesser films).
  Z learns of a place in the outside world known as Insectopia, a land where
all insects can run free.  Z wants to go, but not before trading places with
his buddy (voice supplie by Sly Stallone), who is a cadat in an military-type
army, ready to go to war with a bunch of alien-looking termits.
  One day, Z and Bala are accidentally brought to the outside world, where Z
insists they search for Insectopia, but Bala wants to go home.  This is a
perfect setup for the Hollywood man-and-women trapped on a desert island,
fighting all the time senario.  You know what I mean.  We just saw it with
Harrison Ford and Anne Heche in Six Days, Seven Nights.  Except, this time, it
features to talking ants with the voices of Allen and Stone.  
  I was very disappointed with Antz.  I heard some good words of the movie,
but, sadly, I don't think I'll be passing any of those said words along to my
friends. DreamWorks' turn into the all computer animation territory dominated
by the superior Toy Story is a second-rate voiced, written episode worthy of a
slot in the WB Saturday morning kid scetch.
  The DVD of Antz is very nice.  The picture is lush and brimming with
beautiful colors.  Special features are a trailer.  </P>
