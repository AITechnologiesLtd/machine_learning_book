<P> `Great Expectations,' which stars Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow and Anne
Bancroft, takes Dickens' classic tale and presents it in a new milieu.
The names Pip and Havisham have been changed to Finn and Dinsmoor, and the
story now takes place in Florida, but the theme is the same.</P>
<P> A young boy named Finn, who loves to paint, is lured into the world of a
rich, eccentric and vengeful old woman, Ms. Dinsmoor (Bancroft) and her
niece, Estella.  Ms. Dinsmoor, whose fiancé left her on their wedding day,
has sworn revenge against all men and Estella is her weapon.  Trained since
early childhood, the young girl knows every trick to manipulating a boy's
heart and despite a warning from Ms Dinsmoor that she'll break his heart,
Finn falls for her.</P>
<P> As Finn grows older (now played by Hawke), he still makes his way once a
week to Ms. Dinsmoor's decrepit mansion so that he can dance with Estella,
now played by Paltrow.   Finn continues to paint while Estella keeps playing
mind games with him, leading him on and then giving him the cold shoulder
until one day, she leaves for Europe.  Finn, heartbroken, gives up art and
becomes a fisherman until one day, a lawyer mysteriously shows up and grants
him all of his wishes: an art show, money, and a plane ticket to New York,
where Estella now resides.</P>
<P>Once in New York, Finn finds that the woman he is infatuated with has grown
worldlier and more dangerous, but his love for her only increases the more
unobtainable she becomes.  He struggles to become her equal in the hopes
that perhaps then, he may finally have her.</P>
<P>As directed by Alfonso Cuaron, this version of `Great Expectations' is
filled with lush cinematography and production design.  Unlike the David
Lean version, which was darker and more moody, Cuaron fills his picture with
enchanting Gulf Coast scenery and New York kineticism; basically, Dickens
gets the MTV treatment.
 Hawke and Paltrow have the right look for this type of production, but
there is a superficial quality to Hawke's performance, making it difficult
to care about Finn as much as we should.    As Estella, Paltrow is
effectively icy but the real scene-stealers are Bancroft, who gives a fun
and wild performance as the deranged Ms. Dinsmoor, and Robert De Niro, as
the prisoner whom Finn helps escape.
 The best scenes in `Great Expectations' are the early ones, where young
Finn has his first encounters with the prisoner, Ms. Dinsmoor and her
mansion, and Estella.  There is a sense of charm, mystery and danger to
these moments, which is unrivaled in the later parts of the movie.</P>
<P>Overall, `Great Expectations' is not astonishingly good or bad.   Those who
feel compelled to see it because of its cast will most likely enjoy it,
however, for those interested in the story, Lean's version is still the one
to beat.</P>
