<PRE>                        BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is a film starring Keanu Reeves, Alex
Winter, and William Sadler, with George Carlin.</P>
<P>     Two Keanu Reeves movies in one week (the other being POINT BREAK)!
But first, let me salvage my reputation as a Serious Film Guy.  I never
saw BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, but now I would like to.  (That
didn't help.)  How about this?  Lyndol and I *needed* to see film, it
was too daunting to drive all the way to the art-film district (20
miles) and we didn't want to see anything else in the 'burbs (that we
hadn't already seen), such as PROBLEM CHILD 2 or REGARDING HENRY.  But
mostly Lyndol's developed this thing for Reeves in the last week.
Really, I didn't have a choice, I was just following orders.</P>
<P>     Okay, the review (which I promise will not tax anyone's attention
span):</P>
<P>     BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is a totally silly flick, but it is
(if I have a handle on the jargon) totally non-heinous.  In fact, it's
rather charming and sweet.  And some of it is very funny.  There's a
certain amount of exposition that slows down the opening 15 minutes or
so, and a lot of references to the previous, aforementioned EXCELLENT
ADVENTURE, some of which were obviously lost on me and delightful to
most of the audience.</P>
<P>     Winter reminds me of Sean Penn's benevolent twin and Reeves may be
a little long in the tooth for the role now, but together they are
energetic, cheerful, well-intentioned, and unsinkable.  They confront
death, the devil, hell, heaven, the smartest being in the universe, and
God (who is not a rich Republican in a long beard).  They cover a lot
of territory and never so much as dent their air guitars.</P>
<P>     However, they are in danger of losing their movie to William
Sadler, who plays the Grim Reaper with a fine, absurdist sense of
anything goes.  He and the boys do a particularly satisfying send-up of
Bergman's chess-playing Death.  It's quite intellectual.  Really.</P>
<P>     So, unless you're terminally serious, you'll have a good time.
However, with this much fluff, I can't recommend you pay more than cheap
matinee prices.</P>
