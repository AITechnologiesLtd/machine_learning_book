<PRE>Directed by Dominic Sena</PRE>

<PRE>With Nicolas Cage, Delroy Lindo</PRE>
<PRE>UA South   PG-13    117 min</PRE>
<P>     Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, in a philanthropic moment, bought the 
rights to a grade C 1974 quickie called Gone In 60 Seconds, which was 
made by a guy named H.B. Halicki and is remembered, if it is remembered 
at all, for a 40-minute car chase.  Halicki himself was gone in short 
order, erased in an accident while filming a sequel. </P>
<P>     Both movies involve stealing a lot of cars, and driving recklessly 
and very fast.  A less sensitive man than Bruckheimer might not have 
felt this was worth paying the big bucks for, but Jerry's the man who 
brought us The Rock and Armageddon, so he has certain standards to 
maintain. </P>
<P>     Bruckheimer veteran Nic Cage is the central character, an ex-car 
thief known even to his family as Memphis.  Cage once won a Best Actor 
Oscar, but he's been trying successfully to live it down ever since.  
Memphis is going straight, working at a go-kart track with little kids, 
but his brother (Giovanni Ribisi) has run afoul of a homicidal crime 
boss (Christopher Eccleston), and Memphis has to heist 50 high-end autos 
in a night to save the lad's bacon. </P>
<P>     Gone In 60 Seconds  is all speed and shiny surfaces, with odd 
little moments of pathos spotted in to support Bruckheimer's assertion 
that this movie is "character driven".   Driven, yes; character, no.</P>
<P>     I could tell you how Memphis puts together a "team", and mention 
names like Robert Duvall, but that would give you false hope.  I could 
mention Delroy Lindo, reduced here to an Inspector Javert-like detective 
who grouses "I should have put you away when I had the chance," sounding 
like George Bush bitching to Saddam Hussein.   I could mention Angelina 
Jolie, yet another Oscar winner, but that would give you the impression 
that there's a female presence here.  I couldn't figure for the life of 
me what Jolie was doing in the movie, except to ponder with Cage the 
question "Which is better, boosting cars or sex?"</P>
<P>     The answer is neither, when it becomes as monotonously repetitive 
as it does here.  Boosting one car could be pretty exciting.  Boosting 
50 is just plain tedious.  It's like one of those tours that takes you 
to 12 European cities in 6 days. </P>
<P>     If all you ask for in a movie is lots of car chases, you'll find 
plenty of that in this one.  Memphis's main automotive squeeze is a '67 
Shelby Mustang GT 500 (similar to the car  Steve McQueen drove in 
Bullitt.)  Her name is Eleanor, and he comes a lot closer to orgasm with 
her than he does with Angelina Jolie.</P>
