<PRE>                            JACOB'S LADDER
                    A review in the public domain
                            by The Phantom
                      (<A HREF="mailto:baumgart@esquire.dpw.com">baumgart@esquire.dpw.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>     The Phantom went into JACOB'S LADDER expecting something along the
lines of FLATLINERS; a fairly standard mainstream thriller with some
horror touches -- enough to give moviegoers a few thrills, possibly even
a few gross-outs, but no more than an occasional slightly crazed look or
boiled rabbit.  After all, the director, Adrian Lyne, is a master of the
mainstream, commercial film -- with FLASHDANCE, 9 1/2 WEEKS, and FATAL
ATTRACTION to his credit, Mr. Lyne is nothing if not knowledgeable about
what sells, and he of all people would know that while audiences do like
the occasional scare, the real money is in making films that are, at
heart, conventional and predictable above all else.</P>
<P>     So imagine the Phantom's surprise when he found that JACOB'S LADDER
is as close to a full-tilt serious high-tech monster psychological
thriller as we are likely to get until MISERY opens this Christmas.  As
Lyne took the audience through his rollercoaster-ride of a film, the
Phantom marveled at the camera work, the lighting, the eerie music, and
all of the classic horror touches that abounded throughout the film.
Despite what the studio wishes you to believe, JACOB'S LADDER is not
another GHOST, and it's not another FATAL ATTRACTION.  JACOB'S LADDER is
a classic, traditional horror film the likes of which we haven't seen in
a good long while.</P>
<P>     That said, the Phantom should also point out that JACOB'S LADDER is
not a hard-core horror film like BRAIN DEAD -- an excellent low-budget
film that it resembles in more than a few ways.  When all is said and
done, horror gives way to explanation and resolution, and truth be told,
the film's ending is embarrassingly bad.  But the festival of exposition
doesn't begin until the last ten minutes of the film (to kick it off,
one character literally stands facing the camera and explains the entire
film to an audience which Mr. Lyne and the studio apparently believe
has been standing in line for popcorn for the preceding two hours).  And
by that time the Phantom was not only able to forgive Mr. Lyne for
giving in to convention -- the quaint American cinematic tradition of
supplying a sensible and rational ending to everything -- but also for
directing two of the most awful films of the eighties (the Phantom
wasn't a particular phan of FATAL ATTRACTION, but at least it didn't
provide another nail for the coffin of cinematic intelligence as did his
two prior efforts).</P>
<P>     JACOB'S LADDER begins in Vietnam, where we first meet Jake as he
and his platoon get involved in serious combat.  But shortly Jake
awakens on the subway, bound for the Bergen Street station and home.
Was the Vietnam episode a dream?  Is the dirty, ill-lit subway car a
dream, and is Jake still in fact in Vietnam?  Though this last
possibility can be dismissed by any New Yorker, who would know only too
well that Jake's "G" train was a real-life nightmare from which few
Brooklyn-ites can awaken, much of JACOB'S LADDER proceeds in just this
fashion.  Much of the time we never really know whether Jake is awake or
asleep, or if the demons and strange goings-on he sees are really
happening.  And just when we're sure that Jake is finally back in
"reality," Lyne pulls the rug out from under us once again and we're off
on another loop of the coaster ride.</P>
<P>     For phans who have seen the excellent low-budget sleeper BRAIN
DEAD, this will sound very familiar.  But where BRAIN DEAD achieved many
of its nightmarish effects through the use of graphic gore and a
generous helping of red dye #2, in JACOB'S LADDER Lyne relies on
chipping away at tiny bits of normality -- a very effective and
disturbing technique.  Instead of putting a headless zombie on the
subway, Lyne strews trash all over the floor and lets the lights flicker
just so.  But the trash doesn't look like trash you would expect to see
on the subway, and the lights have a tendency to go out at just the
worst times.  The train itself is deserted but for a woman and a
homeless person sleeping on a bench, but the woman doesn't respond to
Jake when he asks whether or not they've passed Bergen Street, and to be
honest, she doesn't look quite right.  In fact, she looks like she might
have stumbled out of the theater auditorium next door, where she could
plausibly have played an extra in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  And though
Jake is prepared to ignore the homeless person entirely as he leaves the
train, something on the bench moves.  We just get a glimpse of it, and
we don't know what it is -- but what it isn't is *right*.</P>
<P>     There's a lot that's not *right* in Jake's life, and throughout the
film we find Jake clinging desperately to what he believes is reality.
Yet it is a reality that is built on a very shaky foundation -- Jake's
mental health.  The well-written script (by Bruce Joel Rubin, who wrote
the immensely popular GHOST) hints at possibilities: Jake might be
suffering from a mental breakdown.  He might be suffering from the
effects of his tour of duty in Vietnam.  He might be hallucinating,
possibly because of drugs he took -- or drugs that were given to him
without his knowledge -- while in the Army.  And finally, he might be
dead.  It is to both Rubin and Lyne's credit that they make the last
possibility the most plausible, for throughout much of the film it
appears that Jake may be slowly descending into hell, and the demons he
sees appear at least as real as does Jake himself.</P>
<P>     Of course, the Phantom would never give away just what exactly is
happening (there is a definite "something," alas, for as the Phantom
mentioned, unlike BRAIN DEAD, JACOB'S LADDER is at heart a mainstream
film) -- guessing is half the fun.  But suffice it to say that things
are almost never what they appear to be, and that while Lyne has us on
the rollercoaster he rarely misses an opportunity to unnerve us, to
confound us, and every once in a while to just plain scare the popcorn
out from under our seats.  There is more than a little ERASERHEAD in
this film, and Lyne sends shivers down our spines in just the way Lynch
did: by creating a world in which stockings draped over a shower curtain
rod can look sinister; in which people's heads shake back and forth much
too quickly; in which a chiropractor might be an angel and a surgeon a
devil; and in which almost nothing seems quite right.</P>
<P>     Well, not true.  Although in Jake's world everything seems just a
little off, in our world there are more than a few things that are
exactly right.  For one, the music (by Maurice Jarre) is wonderful,
eerie and atmospheric when it needs to be and a delight the rest of the
time.  Lyne uses sound and lighting effects to great advantage, but he
never over indulges so that the audience becomes aware of his camera
tricks.  And his rips in reality -- the touches of horror that he
sprinkles throughout the film -- brought tears of joy to the Phantom's
jaded eyes.  Phans who saw THE EXORCIST III remember that many of its
"special effects" were perfectly ordinary objects used in a disturbing
context.  When George C. Scott hears that his friend was murdered by
having all the blood drained out of his body, we are horrified both
because the script is so rich and the description is so good, and
because we see over a dozen small beakers, all neatly aligned on a tray,
that are filled with blood.  Lyne's effects are like that, and JACOB'S
LADDER succeeds as a horror film where films like LEATHERFACE fail:
while gore is easy, it is rarely scary.  JACOB'S LADDER may not be a
hard-core horror film like HELLRAISER, but in many ways Lyne shows us a
more convincing vision of hell than Barker -- with his team of special
effects technicians -- was able to.</P>
<P>     The performances (especially Tim Robbin's as Jake) are convincing,
the script is generally intelligent, well-written, and without too many
pointless diversions (though there are some), and the film -- like all
of Lyne's films -- looks great.  It is not a horror film from first
frame to last, and phans who sneak out of GRAVEYARD SHIFT and into
JACOB'S LADDER expecting more of the same (though the Phantom would have
difficulty understanding why anyone would *want* more of the same) will
be disappointed.  JACOB'S LADDER needs a little time and space to
develop in its own way and at its own pace, but the Phantom thinks that
phans who see it and are willing to accept its sometimes illogical
twists and turns will be pleasantly surprised.  And phans who enjoyed
BRAIN DEAD will almost assuredly enjoy JACOB'S LADDER, for there but for
the grace of a major studio and $20 million dollars is something very
similar to Charles Beaumont's glorious Twilight Zone-like script.</P>
<P>     Good psychological horror films are so few and far between that the
Phantom urges phans to see JACOB'S LADDER while they wait for the giant
rats to leave and MISERY to arrive.  When Chucky returns this Friday for
a rehash of the very clever and original CHILD'S PLAY, the Phantom will
be in attendance, laughing and throwing popcorn with the rest of the
audience.  But he probably won't be scared or disturbed or even very
intrigued; JACOB'S LADDER was able to do all of these things with
remarkable skill, and so the Phantom recommends it very highly indeed.</P>
