<P>Actor Chris O'Donnell took a two-year hiatus from showbiz after his last
disastrous cinematic entity, better known to many as BATMAN & ROBIN, and
dedicated most of that time to getting rid of his own designation as
bachelor, by marrying his long-time love, Caroline Fentress. They recently
had a baby daughter, named Lily Ann, so Chris is just about ready to become
a bachelor again...well, at least on film.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A lifetime bachelor cannot seem to get the proper motivation to ask his
three-year girlfriend to marry him. Unfortunately for him, his grandfather's
will provides him with only 24 hours to get married in order to receive his
$100 million dollars fortune. If he does not get married within that time
frame, he will get nothing.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Add this film to my list of "not good enough to recommend" romantic comedies
from the past year which includes YOU'VE GOT MAIL, NOTTING HILL and RUNAWAY
BRIDE. Every one of these films seemed to include a tailor-made script idea
which might've read nicely on paper, but ultimately lacked the proper
"oomph", once produced and presented onto the big screen. Big stars and a
catchy concept do not a romantic comedy make. A film would require romance
and humor for that designation. This film essentially suffers from a
lackluster script which actually starts off on a fun note, but quickly
dissolves into many unfunny scenarios featuring the "bachelor" in question
chasing after his ex-girlfriends in the hopes of marriage. Very little humor
shows up in any of these scenes. Isn't it also interesting how every single
one of his ex-girlfriends apparently had completely different qualities
about them? Usually folks tend to go out with people with reasonably similar
characteristics, but not our boy! Toss that in with a distracting 10-second
cameo from singer Mariah Carey, whose part is all but shown in the
commercials of this film, and Brooke Shields attempting to be funny, and you
see where I'm going with this.</P>
<P>It's too bad because O'Donnell is actually pretty good in this film as your
standard Joe Schmoe "afraid of commitment" guy, and some funny scenes do
make an appearance near the end of this film (I'm sorry but the sight of all
those brides in the church was pretty funny...). But all in all, the film
lacked the overall comedic elements needed for a hearty recommendation for a
visit to the theatres. O'Donnell's sidekick Lange is just as annoying in
this film as he was as the sidekick in LOST & FOUND (5/10) and DIRTY WORK
(5/10), and the romance element is also quite weak. This is nothing more
than your typical "video movie", the type you'd rent on a slow night, after
a hard day's work when you and your love-hubby just want to sit around, shut
off your brains for an hour and a half and snicker at a couple of clever
moments. It's also the type of movie which leaves very little to discuss
once done, and might actually be appreciated more by men who themselves are
afraid to commit (the whole Mustang horse analogy was kinda funny).  Light,
safe, funny in some moments, tired and unfunny in others, recommended on
video only.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Chris O'Donnell's friends call him "OD", and his middle name is Eugene. He
also co-executive produced this film (his first) and garnered his first role
on the big screen in 1990's MEN DON'T LEAVE. He got his start in a
McDonald's commercial.
Renee Zellweger's friends call her "Zelly". I suppose this fact is widely
known by now but Renee does bear an uncanny resemblance to singer Jewel.
Renee's mom is Norwegian and her dad, Swiss.
Near the end of the film, a woman who wants to marry the bachelor claims to
have a "degree from Princeton, just like Brooke Shields!". A cute reference
to the actress who plays Berkley in this film. Speaking of Princeton, word
on the street is that Brooke once dated TV's "Superman" Dean Caine, while
both were attending the prestigious University. Her full name is Christa
Brooke Camille Shields.
It is through the help of the Internet, that costume designer Terry Dresbach
stumbled across one Phyllis Kelley's "Brides to Be," a retail bridal
consignment store in Glastonbury, Connecticut. Phyllis had over 800
different wedding dresses stored in her home that she was ready to sell off
for one lump sum.
This film is a remake of the 1925 Buster Keaton silent film called SEVEN
CHANCES.
This is screenwriter Steve Cohen's first produced screenplay.</P>
