<PRE>                            SWEPT FROM THE SEA</PRE>
<P>  Screenwriter Tim Willocks has quite faithfully transposed Joseph
Conrad's moving short story of Amy Foster.    In turn, Director
Beeban Kidron has done her best to stick with the script.</P>
<P>  The story is about Amy (Rachel Weisz), a  poor girl in Cornwall,
England, regarded as not too bright by her parents and farmed out to
work as a serving girl to Mr. and Mrs Smith (Tony Haygarth and Fiona
Victory).  On the surface, Amy is a placid person but inside rages a
passionate woman waiting only for a chance to burst from her  world
surrounded by the sea.   Many are the times she looks out to the sea
from the wall that protects the town.</P>
<P>  Meanwhile, in the Ukraine, scoundrels are filling the ears of
young men with stories of fortunes to be made in America.    These
innocents sell every bit of their meager belongings to ship out to
America.   Once aboard ship, they are put into crowded holds, their
money taken from them.  Conditions are as if they were slaves.</P>
<P>  All this suddenly changes when a storm comes up and there is a
shipwreck, the only survivor being Yanko Gooral (Vincent Perez), a
handsome young man who despite managing to land at the bottom of the
sea wall, looks like a miserable excuse for a human. When he is
discovered, the townspeople are antagonistic.  His Ukrainian
language sounds like the gibberish of a lunatic and they regard him
as such, making life immediately miserable for him.    Only one
person comes to his aid, Amy Foster.  As she had yearned, someone
came from the sea . . . for her.</P>
<P>  The only other person who is able to see anything human in Yanko
is Dr. James Kennedy (in an excellent portrayal by Ian McKellen).
This comes about only because   the doctor and Yanko have a passion
for chess.    In the film, unlike the short story, it is the doctor
who relates to a friend the story of Amy and Yanko.</P>
<P>  The hypocrisy of the townspeople who treat Yank as a lunatic; the
passion of Amy who loves Yanko, feeds him when she is warned to keep
away from him, and brings him back to life; and the child of their
union are all part of this interesting story.</P>
<P>  Prominent in the cast is Kathy Bates as Miss Swaffer.</P>
