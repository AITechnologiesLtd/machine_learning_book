<P>     A FEAST AT MIDNIGHT is a delightfully comic family film that 
celebrates youthful rebellion.  Taking place within the cloistered walls 
of a British boys' school, the story seems somehow removed from time, 
invoking images from Dickens' novels as often as it pulls a term from 
JURASSIC PARK.  Dryden Park is the kind of place where dozens of serious 
dramas are set (most about repression and abuse), yet co-writer/director 
Justin Hardy has something lighter in mind, playing with the dreary 
"boys' school image" while allowing his narrative to progress in a more 
upbeat fashion.</P>
<P>     Circumstances have forced young Magnus (Freddie Findlay) to go to 
boarding school while his father is recuperating from an unspecified 
disease.  Since it's a family tradition to attend stuffy Dryden Park, 
that's where Magnus is enrolled.  Once there, he immediately feels out-
of-place, and his inability to excel at cricket is a cause for further 
isolation.  But Magnus isn't the only misfit at Dryden, and he soon 
bands his fellow social outcasts into a secret society dedicated to the 
art of cooking.  By nights, under Magnus' careful direction, the boys 
(and one girl) sneak into the forbidden kitchen to whip up culinary 
delights.  Their chief nemesis on these nightly excursions is Mr. 
Longfellow (Christopher Lee), the humorless Latin Teacher who looks 
severely upon even the most minor infraction of school rules.</P>
<P>     Stories about children rebelling against authority are typically 
grim affairs, and often involve a great deal of melodrama.  Not so in A 
FEAST AT MIDNIGHT, where the unlikely method is the act of cooking, and 
the medium is decidedly comic.  The boys in Magnus' "Scoffers Society" 
(named after the French L'Escoffier's) are nevertheless striking a blow 
for their own freedom, rejecting the school's "healthy diet" of tofu 
lasagna and grated beetroot in favor of creme brulee and chocolate cake.</P>
<P>     Freddie Findlay is yet another marvelously adept European child 
actor.  His innocent face and unaffected manner make Magnus completely 
believable.  He's a pleasure to watch, and his performance never strikes 
a wrong chord.  Equally enchanting is Lisa Faulkner, who exhibits great 
appeal in playing an ugly duckling-turned-beautiful girl.  Best of all, 
however, is veteran horror actor Christopher Lee, who willingly sends up 
some of his Dracula-like mannerisms.  While never letting his stern 
expression slip, Lee pokes fun at the grotesque, monstrous image that 
established his reputation.  </P>
<P>     Hardy lampoons everything from MASTERPIECE THEATER-type dramas to 
American TV and motion pictures.  There's a delightful takeoff of 
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE as Magnus sneaks into town to get ingredients for a 
cooking session.  On another occasion, the raptor-searching-the-kitchen 
scene from JURASSIC PARK is recreated, with Christopher Lee standing in 
as the dinosaur.  </P>
<P>     A FEAST AT MIDNIGHT is one of those rare family films that offers 
as much (if not more) for adults than children.  The way to an 
audience's heart may be through its stomach, but A FEAST AT MIDNIGHT 
provides a delectable, alternative means of entry.</P>
