<PRE>STATE AND MAIN
--------------</PRE>
<P>After getting unceremoniously thrown out of the state of New Hampshire,
the Hollywood cast and crew of "The Old Mill" descend upon Waterford, Vermont,
largely on the merits of its authentic old mill and firehouse.  Screenwriter
Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman) will face a crisis of conscience
when he's asked to lie about witnessing the presence of an underage local in 
star Bob Barrenger's (Alec Baldwin) car at an accident at "State and
Main."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Writer/director David Mamet takes a pot shot at Hollywood corruption with
his latest, "State and Main."  While his screenplay features many pithy
lines (usually coming from the director/producer due of William H. Macy
and David Paymer), "State and Main" plays pretty flat.</P>
<P>Director Walt Price (Mamet vet Macy) arrives with his signature cross stitched
pillow ('Shoot first, ask questions later') and sets up camp.  His 
and producer Marty Rossen's attitude is obviously condescending to the 
locals, who themselves are soon retaliating by filling Evian bottles with
tap water.  Soon they discover that the local, hoped for titular, old mill
burned down years ago, their ever randy star is fooling around with the
local deli guy's underage daughter (Julia Stiles, "Hamlet"), their female star,
Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica Parker) is balking at nudity even though it's
covered by her contract and the locals are all tied up in a local stage 
production and unavailable as extras.</P>
<P>The central focus of the story, though, is Mamet standin, screenwriter
Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman), adapting his own play for the
big screen for the first time.  He meets local bookshop owner Ann Black
(Rebecca Pidgeon, "The Winslow Boy" and Mamet's wife) who tries to keep him
on a true course as he navigates the ways of Tinseltown while an innocent
romance blooms.</P>
<P>Even as Mamet provides clever dialogue ('Everybody makes their own fun.  If
you don't make it, it's entertainment.'  'You believed that?  It's so biased!
So's our electoral process, but we still vote.') and situations (placing
a computer product placement in a film set in 1895), his film never takes
wing and flies.  His oddly assembled cast runs the gamut from Macy, delivering
his lines as if he were on stage instead of in a film, Seymour Hoffman,
miscast as a naive romantic lead, and Alec Baldwin, convincing as a pampered
star with a fixation on nubile young girls.  Macy and Paymer enjoy repartee,
but Hoffman and Pidgeon never really connect.  A subplot where Mayor George
Bailey (Charles Durning as the "It's a Wonderful Life" namesake) cowtows
to the Hollywood celebrities in order to score a society dinner for his wife
Sherry (Patti LuPone), so rife with comic possiblities, is just about
abandoned.  No effort is made to make the film-within-a-film appear the least
bit interesting.</P>
<P>Technically the film is adequate.  Overall, "State and Main" has the appearance
of a film that was a lot more fun to make than it is to sit through.</P>
