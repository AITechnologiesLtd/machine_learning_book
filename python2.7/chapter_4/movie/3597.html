<PRE>           THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Hugh Grant, Colm Meaney, Tara Fitzgerald, Ian McNeice,
           Kenneth Griffith.
Screenplay/Director:  Christopher Monger.</P>
<P>     If it had not been for Jim Carrey, Hugh Grant might have been
hailed as *the* breakout star of 1994.  His affable, self-effacing
persona turned FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL int the biggest "art house"
hit in the history of the country, leading to a not-so-coincidental
increase in business for another Grant film, SIRENS, after his face was
substituted for Elle Macpherson's bare backside in that film's print
ads.  THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN might
have faced a monumental marketing challenge, or at least a name change,
if not for the advantage of being Hugh Grant's first post-WEDDINGS
effort.  Unfortunately, it's no honeymoon.  Grant's fans could be
massively disappointed, both by his relatively minor role and by the
film's frequently tedious pace.</P>
<P>     Grant plays Reginald Anson, an English surveyor who comes to
Wales in 1917 with his partner George Garrad (Ian McNeice) to map
the terrain for the war effort.  Among their tasks is determining
the height of Ffynnon Garw, a geographical feature which the locals
take inordinate pride in calling "the first mountain in Wales."
However, Anson and Garrad find that Ffynnon Garw is sixteen feet
short of the 1,000 foot height required for the designation of a
mountain.  Refusing to accept that Ffynnon Garw is just a "hill,"
the locals, led by innkeeper Morgan (Colm Meaney) and the Reverend
Jones (Kenneth Griffith) concoct an elaborate plan to add the
required height to Ffynnon Garw, and to keep Anson and Garrad in
town as long as necessary to obtain a favorable re-measurement.</P>
<P>     The story, based on a tale from the family of Welsh writer/
director Christopher Monger, begins as a promising enough fable
about fish out of water and a legendary act of combined community
will.  Monger does a nice job of establishing the scene, introducing
the quirks of the characters in the matter-of-fact manner of an
accomplished tale-teller who relates a story he knows to be fanciful
with utmost earnestness.  The clash of personalities between the
merrily profane Morgan "the Goat" and the ever-apoplectic Reverend
Jones is entertaining, thanks largely to a good-natured performance
by Colm Meaney, and Stephen Endelman provides a bright and lilting
score which keeps the tone light.</P>
<P>     Sadly, although it is clear that Monger has a great affection
for this particular story, it isn't nearly as interesting as he
seems to think it is, at least not for 100 minutes.  The key problem
is that as much as he tries to convey why this "mountain" is so
important to the people of Ffynnon Garw, he never quite manages to
do so.  He toys both with the idea of Welsh identity being tied to
the mountains, and with the general sense of loss brought on by the
first World War, but as hard as he tries to draw us into the
imperative of the Ffynnon Garw mission, he can't make it matter as
much to the audience.  While the efforts of the townspeople to
thward Anson and Garrad in their every attempt to leave are
sometimes amusing, there is a lot of space between them, and THE
ENGLISHMAN slows down to become a sporadically whimsical bore.</P>
<P>     It also appears that the presence of Hugh Grant resulted in an
ill-advised restructuring of the script.  The story really should
have been about the Welsh townsfolk, not about the two Englishman,
and indeed Hugh Grant is little more than a peripheral figure for
fully half of the film.  Then Tara Fitzgerald (Grant's wife in
SIRENS) appears as a woman of ill repute brought to town to keep
Anson occupied, Anson becomes sympathetic to the determination of
the Welsh villagers, and suddenly we have an unnecessary and
unwelcome love story thrown into the mix.  Grant really just walks
through this part, relying on his crinkly smile and hesitating
delivery and little else.  If the story had to focus on one of the
Englishman, it should have been Garrad, played with puffed-up
impatience by Ian McNeice.  Of course, McNeice is only an actor;
Hugh Grant is a movie star.  THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT
CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN has some charms, and an appealing sense of
place.  It is also a case of an hour's worth of story stretched an
extra forty minutes, and of a big name star in an essentially
supporting role who becomes a tail wagging the dog.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 mountains from molehills:  5.</PRE>
