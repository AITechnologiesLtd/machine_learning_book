ALICE AND MARTIN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>André Téchiné's confusing ALICE AND MARTIN (ALICE ET MARTIN) is a 
combination mystery and character study in which the more we learn, the 
less we care.  The poorly drawn characters are so unsympathetic and 
uninteresting that we are happy to let them remain enigmas.  </P>
<P>As the story opens, 10-year-old Martin Sauvagnac (Jeremy Kreikenmayer), 
whose parents are divorced, is abruptly sent off by his working class 
mother to live with his wealthy father on his large manor.  In one of 
many jarring scene transitions, we quickly switch to Martin, played 
lethargically by Alexis Loret, as a 20-year-old.  </P>
<P>When we meet the older Martin, he is running like a mad man out of the 
gate of his father's estate.  Living like an animal in the woods, a 
nearly mute Martin steals eggs and eats them raw before leaving the 
chicken coop.  Out in a field, he pauses to watch buzzards rip the flesh 
off of a dead deer.  The part where he pushes the birds aside for his 
own tastes of the deer appears to have been left on the cutting room 
floor, but his eyes make it clear that that is what he is about to do.  
Finally, for the crime of stealing eggs, the police lead him off in 
chains worthy of those for a vicious serial killer.</P>
<P>The movie feels like a much longer film that was hacked up by a maniacal 
editor who chose random selections of footage.  To be fair, this is more 
likely to be a problem attributable to writers Olivier Assayas, Gilles 
Taurand and André Téchiné than editor Martine Giordano.  Couple this 
bewildering narrative with Caroline Champetier's ugly and dingy 
cinematography, and you get an obtuse mess.     </P>
<P>Martin goes to Paris to live with his brother Benjamin (Mathieu Amalric) 
and his brother's roommate Alice (Juliette Binoche).  Alice, a 
violinist, explains upfront to Martin that her relationship with 
Benjamin is not sexual.  Later, she tells Martin that she never mixes 
sex and friendship.  (We are frequently told that Europeans have a 
healthier attitude about sex than do we Americans.  Would Alice be 
considered an example of what they have in mind?)</P>
<P>Benjamin and Alice have an unusual relationship.  They brag that they 
trade roles being each other's child.  How's that for getting in touch 
with your inner child?</P>
<P>Although Alice initially writes off Martin as being "like a hobo from 
another planet," she -- surprise! -- falls for him.  After being 
discovered at a cafe, Martin is given a job as a model.  As his career 
is taking off, Alice downplays hers to follow him.  Along the way, we 
learn that Martin's father "fell" down the stairs to his death and that 
is what freaked Martin out.  Hmm, could there be more than meets the eye 
here?  Do we care?  No.</P>
<P>ALICE AND MARTIN runs a long 2:00.  The film is in French with English 
subtitles.  It is rated R for a scene of sexuality and language and 
would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
