<P>Saving Silverman (2001) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Jason Biggs, Steven
Zahn, Jack Black, Amanda Peet, Amanda Detmer, R. Lee Ermey and Neil
Diamond. Written by Greg DePaul and Hank Nelken. Directed by Dennis
Dugan. 91 minutes. PG-13.</P>
<P> Saving Silverman is a winning combination of slapstick and sweetness
propelled by the antics of two fine young character actors ó Steven Zahn
and Jack Black.</P>
<P> This low-brow, sometimes crude comedy is nonetheless rather charming.
After all, any movie in which Neil Diamond is characterized as a
cultural icon who can save the day canít be bad.</P>
<P> Silverman is a story of friendship and the lengths some people will go
to to preserve that bond.</P>
<P> Darren (Jason Biggs), Wayne (Steve Zahn) and J.D. (Jack Black) have
been best friends since grade school, sticking together into adulthood
where they rock together in Diamonds in the Rough, a Neil Diamond cover
band.</P>
<P> The trio, especially Darren, always have been unlucky in love.</P>
<P> Then along comes Judith (Amanda Peet), a stunning, cold-hearted,
manipulative psychiatrist who grabs the sweet Darren away from his
friends. ìHe is my puppet and I am his puppet master,î she brazenly
tells Wayne and J.D. when they try to reclaim their pal.</P>
<P> Judithís stranglehold is so great on Darren that he even refuses a
chance to be reunited Sandy (Amanda Detmer) with his ìone and only true
loveî from high school.</P>
<P> Wayne and J.D. then take extreme action to separate Darren from Judith,
thus giving their friend a chance to realize his true feelings for
Sandy.</P>
<P> Zahn (That Thing You Do and Happy Texas) and Black (High Fidelity) are
wonderfully funny, physical and bumbling as the inept pair endlessly
scheming to rescue sweet Darren. That they are no intellectual match for
Judith is part of the fun, as she uses her brain while they try to use
brawn.</P>
<P> Much of the humor is coarse, involving punishment to unmentionable body
parts, but the overall tone of the movie is so cheery and light-hearted
that you are not offended or ache with the punishment Wayne and J.D.
endure for the sake of friendship.</P>
<P> Peet is hilarious, playing her Ice Queen part with a minimum of
tongue-in-cheek.</P>
<P> Biggs adds another sweet characterization to his roster of parts
following American Pie and Loser, while Detmer brings a wholesomeness to
her role as the girl of Darrenís dreams.</P>
<P> Veteran F. Lee Ermey spoofs his tough-guy image, first honed as the
sadistic drill sergeant in Stanley Kubrickís Full Metal Jacket ó with
several variations since ó as the win-at-any-cost football coach and
mentor to Wayne and J.D.</P>
<P> And then thereís Neil Diamond. Saving Silverman can be appreciated as
one sweet, long love song to the singer. He only appears briefly and his
acting hasnít improved since The Jazz Singer, but so what. Heís Neil
Diamond and he has some fun spoofing himself.</P>
<P> Saving Silverman is rather short, running only about 90 minutes. It is
not a classic comedy, but it is an entertaining vehicle that will leave
you smiling.</P>
<P> It is witty, a bit naughty, but most of all, warm.</P>
