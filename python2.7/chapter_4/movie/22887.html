Bringing Out The Dead  (7/10) </PRE>
<P>In 1976's Taxi Driver, director Martin Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader
examined the sordid and violent street life of New York through the eyes
of the increasingly disgusted and deranged cabbie Travis Bickle,
memorably played by Robert De Niro in his star-making role.</P>
<P>In Bringing Out The Dead, Scorsese and Schrader have teamed up again to
examine a similar theme. Nicholas Cage plays Frank Pierce, a New York
ambulance driver and paramedic. He works in the same awful urban
environment as Travis Bickle, and the New York tourist board cannot be
at all happy with the portrayal of their city there is no sign here of
the dramatic recent repackaging of New York as a safe and friendly city,
and the hospital scenes are more reminiscent of MASH than ER. The grim
setting is matched by Frank's mood. He is on a bad streak. He is
drinking and he has not saved a life for months. One death in
particular, that of a teenage girl, is haunting him, and he sees her
face everywhere he looks.</P>
<P>Scorsese's early work, such as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver, relied for
its power on a documentary approach to depicting a frantic and
overpoweringly scary reality. With Raging Bull, his enduring
masterpiece, he developed a more technically sophisticated approach.
While fellow New Yorker Brian De Palma is an equally good technician (if
we forget such incompetent tripe as Body Double), Scorsese uses his
mastery of the medium to produce movies that convince while they dazzle.
Films such as Goodfellas, for example, drop us in a world of believable
characters whose story we want to follow, regardless of how repulsive
the characters often are. And despite Scorsese's brilliance, and
Schrader's talent as a writer, it is the lack of a compelling story that
spoils Bringing Out The Dead. Frank is screwed up. He meets a girl. He
sorts himself out. That's about it. This lack of a narrative structure
makes the film a bit limp. There are some typically exhilarating
Scorsese sequences, but they seem almost bolted on because the audience
will expect them, not because they are called on by the story. The most
interesting characters are Frank's fellow ambulance drivers played by a
dream team of Hollywood character actors: a laid-back take-it-or-leave-
it John Goodman, a sweet-talking evangelising Ving Rhames, and a violent
manic Tom Sizemore, who inflicts as much pain and injury as he treats.</P>
<P>Although the film has an original score by veteran Elmer Berstein, the
most striking use of music is found in the use of some wonderful tracks
from such bands as The Who and The Clash, but the relevance of these
British bands from the 70s to a story set in 90s New York was lost on
me. This disjointed and inappropriate use of music perhaps contributes
to the feel of a movie that just doesn't work as a whole.</P>
<P>Bringing Out The Dead is a good film, but not a great one, and with a
master such as Scorsese, anything less than great is a let-down.</P>
