<PRE>VARSITY BLUES
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>If you're a teenaged girl, then "Varsity Blues," which stars "Dawson's 
Creek" mega-heartthrob James Van Der Beek, might well be the greatest 
film ever made.</P>
<P>If you've never seen a high school football drama before, you're likely 
to enjoy it too, since the film packs in just about every ingredient of 
the genre, including all those tight ends and late-breaking touchdowns.  
Middle-aged men who've already caught "All the Right Moves" and its many 
imitators on late-night television aren't going to find a whole lot in 
"Varsity Blues" to recommend it.  But the film is a pleasant enough 
diversion, highlighted by some well-choreographed gridiron sequences and 
a handful of intelligent performances, James! (as the teen rags refer to 
him) included.</P>
<P>Van Der Beek stars as Jonathan "Mox" Moxon, second-string quarterback 
for the Coyotes of West Canaan, a small Texan community that lives and 
breathes their commitment to varsity football.  The Coyotes' coach is 
the-win-at-all-costs Bud Kilmer, played with permanent gum-chewing 
ferocity by Jon Voight.</P>
<P>The veteran star of such acclaimed films as "Midnight Cowboy" and 
"Coming Home," Voight has taken to playing one-dimensional unsavory 
characters in recent years, and his Bud Kilmer is no exception.  
Voight's performance might not be subtle, but his take-no-prisoners 
approach to the character gives the high-spirited "Varsity Blues" much 
of its drama.</P>
<P>With a spectacular record of 22 division championships under his belt, 
Coach Kilmer isn't going to let a little thing like an injured player 
jeopardize number 23.  That's what painkillers are for, after all.</P>
<P>Mox, on the other hand, is one of the few people in town who has his 
sights set on something higher than winning the state pennant: an Ivy 
League education.  As smart as he is cute, the brains-before-brawn 
quarterback challenges Coach Kilmer's unethical tactics, which leads to 
a lot of shouting in the locker room and some creative disrespect on the 
field.</P>
<P>In addition to the Mean Coach, the film has its fair share of Underage 
Drunks, Horny Jocks, Frisky Cheerleaders, Funny Fat Guys, Quirky Little 
Brothers, and Dimwitted Parents.  Plus, in this particular case, there's 
that man James! to drool over if you're so inclined.</P>
<P>Truth be told the film makes no excuses in catering to the talents of 
the "Dawson's Creek" regular; he's virtually in every scene.  With that 
kind of pressure, the 21-year-old handles himself surprisingly well, 
especially when going head-to-head with the far more experienced Voight.  
Van Der Beek gives Mox a vulnerable side too; the scenes between him and 
his girlfriend Jules (Amy Smart) are especially well played.</P>
<P>Some scenes come across as contrived, of course, most notably the sex 
ed class in which Van Der Beek offers a litany of colloquialisms for the 
male "condition" (I bet those adoring fans just died during that one!).  
And if you can't predict the outcome of the closing Big Game five 
minutes into the film, well... perhaps you wandered into "Hilary and 
Jackie" by mistake.</P>
<P>"Varsity Blues" isn't likely to win any awards, but as a star vehicle 
for the up-and-coming James Van Der Beek, it goes the whole ten yards.</P>
