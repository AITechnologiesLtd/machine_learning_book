<PRE>Review:         HAV PLENTY  
                [Wanderlust Pictures]</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Christopher Scott Cherot
                Cenoa Maxwell</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>This movie begins  like an amateurish 8mm home movie , but soon at least
the quality of the film  stock  improves.    The characters have surnames
such as Darling, Savage and PLENTY.  It doesn't take a sleuth to realize
that the lead female is HAViland Savage, the and lead male is PLENTY, Lee
Plenty.</P>
<P>The plot basically concerns the lives of a nouveau-riche black family. 
Their money comes from computers, music, etc.   Although they're rich,
Haviland still has the mouth of a longshoreman, letting loose with f...
this and f... , more than polite society would ever accept.  </P>
<P>Plenty  is a homeless guy who is house-sitting for Haviland  and caring
for her cat.  She invites him to her parents' house for the weekend, and
strangely, we never hear another word about that cat.</P>
<P>Haviland has just broken up with her boyfriend, a big time recording
artist.   We are meant to wonder whether she is still in love with him, or
really desires Plenty.  The other females seem to find Plenty
irresistible, which is a bit hard to believe.  </P>
<P>This was a very uneven film.  I have to admit that there are some very
funny moments, yet there was some very wooden acting.  It is a sad state
when you  find  yourself looking at  the pimple on his forehead, or the
beauty mark on the end of her nose.  And, you keep wondering about her
hair.  It doesn't match from scene to scene, and you can't help noticing
it.  </P>
<P>I  never knew where the plot was going, and I don't think that they did
either.  Surprisingly, it was a bit hit at the 1998 Sundance Film
Festival.   </P>
<PRE>It is not a film that I want to see again, not even on free TV.</PRE>
<PRE>I give it a C-</PRE>
