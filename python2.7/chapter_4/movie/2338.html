                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     As with any movie that Tim Burton appends his name to, CABIN BOY
possesses a distinctive flavor--visually impressive, and containing
elements of fantasy and mythology alongside the ordinary and
commonplace.  Inspired by such diverse sources as CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS,
the SINBAD movies, and PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE, this film should
provide a fun--if bizarre--eighty minutes.  Unfortunately, it stars
Chris Elliott, a man with little charisma and less screen presence.</P>
<P>     Nathaniel (Chris Elliott) has just graduated from the Stephenson
Finishing School, where he has successfully completed all the requisite
courses to become an official "fancy lad" (a stuck up, aristocratic
juvenile).  After leaving the school, he's all set to take over the
running of his father's hotel in Hawaii.  However, on the way to the
ship port, he encounters a few difficulties, and instead of getting on
the luxury liner "Queen Catherine," he mistakenly boards "The Filthy
Whore," a fishing scow.  When the roughneck crew, led by Captain
Graybar (Ritch Brinkley) refuse to take him to his destination,
Nathaniel does some meddling of his own to attempt the course change.
It doesn't work, and "The Filthy Whore" ends up in a section of the sea
called "Hell's Bucket," where icebergs walk, cup cakes talk, clouds
laugh, green women (as played by Ann Magnuson) have six arms, and
hardware store managers (Mike Starr) are fifty feet tall.</P>
<P>     CABIN BOY has its share of clever moments, but the most
frustrating thing about Adam Resnick's script is that, while toying
with a host of intriguing concepts, it takes neither the time nor the
effort to develop any of them.  There is enough untapped potential in
this film to provide fuel for half a dozen full-length features.</P>
<P>     The humor is distinctly unfunny, as the picture repeatedly courts
cheap laughs.  A cameo by David Letterman lacks wit (and
intelligence)--a condition shared by more than that scene.  By comic
standards, CABIN BOY is a failure, proving that no matter how badly a
movie wants to make its audience laugh, it needs to be amusing to do
so.</P>
<P>     Chris Elliott is appallingly bad as the title character.  Although
his role cries out for an over-the-top performance, Elliott's grating
personae cancels out any positive contributions made by his inability
to act.  His work is amateurish, transforming possibly-entertaining
sequences into tedious interludes.  Without its star, CABIN BOY might
have gotten by on sheer whimsy, but Elliott is nearly omnipresent.</P>
<P>     The film makes occasional stabs at satire, but many are
poorly-delineated and difficult to identify, while others are entirely
too obvious.  Frequently, CABIN BOY doesn't seem to know what tone to
adopt, wobbling uncertainly between lighthearted fantasy, silly comedy,
and biting parody.  This split personality quickly becomes obvious to
those sitting in theater seats.</P>
<P>     In this time of visual masterpieces like JURASSIC PARK and THE
NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, the special effects work evident in CABIN
BOY is embarrassing, and it would be stretching matters to believe that
such poor quality is an asset to the film's satirical bent.  There are
numerous times when it's obvious that "The Filthy Whore" is a model,
and when a giant lifts Nathaniel into the air, it takes a lot of
imagination to identify the rag doll with Chris Elliott (since the doll
turns in a far better performance).</P>
<P>     CABIN BOY is writer/director Adam Resnick's directorial debut, and
the presence of his good friend Elliott helps sabotage it.  Resnick's
next project is something called HOPETOWN, which he describes as
"another sort of offbeat comedy--that doesn't take place at sea."  If
he can expand on his current release's flashes of inventiveness,
there's reason to be optimistic about HOPETOWN, especially since it
won't feature CABIN BOY's marquee "actor."</P>
