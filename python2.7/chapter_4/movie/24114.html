<P>"Break it up, folks; nuthin' to see here..."</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Gwen (Sandra Bullock) parties like it's 1999; a drink in one hand and 
pills in the other, Gwen and her boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West) go on a 
bender and trash the wedding of Gwen's long-suffering sister Lily 
(Elizabeth Perkins), topping off the day by crashing a "borrowed" limo.</P>
<P>Sentenced to rehab for 28 days [clever title then, har har!], Gwen is 
made to Confront Her Inner Demons alongside other rehab residents, 
including her young, confused roommate Andrea (Azura Skye), 
resentfully-scarred Daniel (Reni Santoni), big lug Oliver (Mike 
O'Malley), Comic Relief/Sensitive Guy Gerhardt (Alan Tudyk), 
ObBlackResident Roshanda (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), addict and celebrity 
baseball player Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortensen), and even her ex-addict 
counselor Cornell (Steve Buscemi)--all learning to Live Life One Day At 
A Time.</P>
<PRE>And oh yeah: Wackiness Ensues. </PRE>
<P>The Upshot:
One of these days, I'd like for someone to explain to me just what the 
difference between Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock is.  Besides the 
$20mil per ploddingly dull picture that Roberts gets and Bullock 
doesn't, I just don't see it.  But then again, I'm not the target demo 
for either of these chicks.  Slot-A Roberts could've easily been plugged 
into this Hole-B flick without it missing a beat, and the only 
difference would be that 28 DAYS would've come away with a 
gazillion-dollar first day box office draw.  And I would've slept 
through her version, too.</P>
<P>There was one--count 'em, one--scene in this entire movie that wound up 
surprising me, and that came at the very end; keeping it as spoiler-free 
as I can, I'll just say that it has to do with whom Gwen didn't Walk Off 
Into The Sunset with.  Other than that, 28 DAYS was a pedestrian movie 
about characters I can't be arsed to care about, getting into situations 
that have been covered to hell and back by actors who actually made me 
want to see What Happens Next.  No one here, not even Comic 
Relief/Sensitive Guy Gerhardt, was anywhere near original; other than 
being a pretty bad poster for the Just Say No types, 28 DAYS did nothing 
to earn its keep.</P>
<P>Well, that's not quite true.  Two other bits in this movie actually kept 
my attention during the short time they were given on-screen: the 
often-funny faux soap, "Santa Cruz", was more interesting than the movie 
that surrounded it ("Tiny clusters of brain tumors" will stay with me 
for awhile); and the very funny background P.A. announcements 
("Tonight's lecture: Are you a blackout drunk, or don't you remember?") 
voiced by Betty (Margo Martindale), drew me out of my near-doze.  Pity 
that these bits were lost within a flick unworthy of these moments of 
ingenuity.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line: 
A situation comedy without the laughs, disguised as a drama, that wound 
up a Tragedy.  Made for a good sleeping pill, though.</P>
<PRE>28 DAYS (rating: yellowlight): 
zzzzzzzzzzzzzz...</PRE>
