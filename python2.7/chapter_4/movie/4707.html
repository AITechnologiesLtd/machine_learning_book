                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<PRE>***   [Credits follow text]   </PRE>
<P>In "Sullivan's Travels," (1941), a masterpiece by Preston 
Sturges, a Hollywood director played by Joel McCrea suddenly 
gets the urge to stop making his usual lightweight 
entertainment movies and do instead something with social 
significance. Disguised as a hobo, he enters the world of 
have-nots, sees their life . . . and changes his mind. As life 
is no bed of roses, making escapist movies gives to the 
unfortunate, including prisoners, a few minutes or hours when 
troubles are forgotten.</P>
<P>I used to be a bit intolerant of the many moviegoers who 
looked first and foremost for film entertainment. Later I came 
to appreciate Joel McCrea's discovery. Applied to "Dead Man 
Walking" it means that this somber, serious movie cannot be 
everyone's cup of tea - but for others it ought to rank among 
the better productions of recent months.</P>
<P>The film adapts the real-life experiences of a nun, with some 
liberties, notably the character played by Sean Penn who now 
is a composite figure. Susan Sarandon, director Robbins's 
companion, plays Sister Helen Prejean who, coming from a 
rather high stratum of society, dedicates herself to good 
deeds. In New Orleans, she works among those who are poor and 
need of spiritual, material, psychological help -- and, above 
all, warmth. </P>
<P>When Matthew Poncelet(Penn) writes her from the Death Row of 
his Louisiana prison, she pays him a visit. Poncelet and a 
friend, high on drugs and booze, had killed a young couple in 
a Lovers' Lane, after raping the girl. Poncelet was condemned 
to death, his companion to life. </P>
<P>For years, Poncelet's execution was postponed while the man 
boned up on law books. He claims that he was only a bystander 
at the rape-killing. That's what he tells Sister Helen at 
their initial meeting, one of several.</P>
<P>That first interview is masterfully constructed, from the 
entrance of Sister Helen into the prison through her 
departure. Sarandon does not wear a nun's habit but street 
clothes, which make the prison's chaplain raise his eyebrows. 
I must stress that throughout, the film avoids Hollywoodisms 
fully yet not pointedly. Sarandon is never made sexy, though 
she could be, even at age 50.  Her make-up is a mere touch of 
lipstick. Her clothes are discreet. She is neither colorful, 
preachy or a do-gooder. </P>
<P>Wasting no time, the Sister and the audience begin to see the 
mechanical, almost clinical procedures of the penitentiary, a 
series of standard operating procedures that follow one 
routine after another. They are dehumanizing. They are also 
necessary. So, enter the first batch of ambiguities that 
pervade the movie. Susan Sarandon handles her part with total 
credibility, her constant unease with ease. </P>
<P>In the interview, Sarandon and Penn are on either side of a 
wire partition. Master cinematographer Roger Deakins gives it 
a look unlike that of other prison movies by keeping before 
our eyes both the faces and the wires of Penn's cage.</P>
<P>Penn seems to plays Poncelet as if to the role born 
--effortlessly, naturally,  as the embodiment of a low-lifer 
who'd rather be a lifer than a corpse. With his noticeable 
hair-do and eye-catching, pointed goatee, he is like 
Mephistopheles. Chained and chain-smoking, Poncelet can be 
defiant, surly, nervous, self-pitying, all at the same time.</P>
<P>Sister Helen, an ideal listener, leaves the prison determined 
to help Poncelet beat the death sentence. Does she believe 
him? Dopes she believe "in" him? Is it Christian charity? The 
belief in repentance and salvation? The "thou shall not kill" 
principle that goes against capital punishment, no matter what 
the crime?  Ambiguities pile up.</P>
<P>The nun enlists the help of lawyer Robert Prosky, a great 
actor who can play roles from sinister to sweet with equal 
conviction. We also see her in contact with her own family and 
those of the victims, both sets disapproving her efforts--in 
further ambiguous, even disturbing ways (note the performance 
by  Raymond J. Barry, the father of the slain girl).  
Poncelet's mother and brothers, at first suspicious, never 
become overtly grateful to Sister Helen, lachrymose or 
sentimentalized. Nor does Sean Penn in the increasingly 
complex rapport between the nun and the convict.</P>
<P>Relentlessly, realistically, the film proceeds to its bitter 
end, its grimness relieved by a major distraction, that of the 
questions raised for and by the film's people and the 
audience. There is a solitary humorous moment. Lost in her 
thoughts, Sister Helen speeds, is stopped by a cop. Seeing in 
her papers that she's a nun he becomes wary, tells her how he 
had ticketed an IRS man and gotten his (the cop's) tax return 
audited the following year.</P>
<P>"Dead Man Walking" is what the guards shout on the way to the 
execution chamber. By then, Poncelet has changed, in 
appearance, somewhat, in his heart ... who knows? There is a 
mea maxima culpa but, in another ambiguity, is this a 
redeemed, saved soul or (by necessity) an invalid 
transformation? And to what extent does the movie speak 
against capital punishment? I checked with a number of 
viewers. Some thought that this was a total indictment of 
state-sanctioned killing. Others were puzzled. One person, a 
liberal, not a conservative, took the position that between 
the living hell of life without parole, and death, execution 
was kinder and saved a great deal of public funds.  </P>
<P>The total anti-capital punishment position is far clearer in a 
major ancestor of this movie, "We Are All Murderers," (France, 
1952) by former lawyer Andre Cayatte. And the moral/ 
theological stance is clear in another French film,  "A 
Condemned Man Escaped," (1956), about a member of the French 
Resistance, jailed and condemned by the occupying Nazis. The 
great, Catholic, ascetic director Robert Bresson concludes his 
film with "All is Grace." The salvation of body and soul are 
stated in an immensely moving way. </P>
<P>"Dead Man Walking" does have some flaws. When will filmmakers 
learn that superimposing opening credits on action and 
dialogue makes the audience miss parts of both? Why are there 
so many graphic flashbacks to the earlier crime?  As a 
counterweight to any pity we might feel for Poncelet this is 
unnecessary. What is accomplished by the painful, detailed, 
protracted description of an execution by lethal injection? </P>
<P>No matter. " Dead Man" is strong and hard. Whatever its 
message about capital punishment, the familiar quote from John 
Donne is unarguably at the heart of the film: "No man is an 
island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the 
continent, a part of the main [...] therefore never send to 
know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee." </P>
