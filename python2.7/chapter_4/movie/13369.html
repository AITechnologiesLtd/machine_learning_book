<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>I try not to go into films with extreme expectations in either
direction, but when it comes to a series that, in my opinion, has
outstayed its welcome, I can't help but be skeptical.  Such was the case
with Lethal Weapon 4, the previews for which all made the film look like
a big joke of a movie.  Before seeing it, the biggest surprise I got was
finding out that it's actually rated R, and that the producers hadn't
wimped out and gone for the PG-13 rating to make the audience wider.  </P>
<P>I love the first two films, because they center around the characters
and their realistic struggles.  Sure, they're funny movies, and quirky a
lot of the time, but they're also gritty in such a way that sets them
apart from other buddy-cop movies.  Lethal Weapon 3 is a bore, a
formulaic and mediocre action film in every way.  I figured the fourth
film would be even worse, going strictly for laughs without presenting
its story with any degree of seriousness.  And I was right -- Lethal
Weapon 4 does go mostly for laughs, and doesn't take its own story
seriously.  And, oddly enough, it works.  It's not risky, nor is it near
the quality of the first two films, but it's fun and effective as
entertainment.  It also expands on the characters in a surprisingly full
way, and any sequel that does this has my respect.</P>
<P>As the posters all say, "The gang's all here!"  This, of course, refers
to Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover).  It also refers to
the large assemblage of supporting characters, including Leo Getz (Joe
Pesci), Lorna (Rene Russo), and now Detective Butters (Chris Rock). 
Five protagonists is a bit steep for any film, even a two-hour-plus
action movie (especially a two-hour-plus action movie), but, thankfully,
Lethal Weapon 4 doesn't regress to Batman & Robin status -- none of the
characters are pointless or underused.</P>
<P>The story, however, is a little on the weak side.  Well, it's actually
about as weak as any story I've heard this year.  It centers around some
bad Chinese men (led by a very bad man played by Jet Li), who attempt to
counterfeit a large sum of money to bring a few Chinese diplomats
(perhaps they are diplomats...the film never quite explains their
significance) into America, where, according to Li's character, laws can
be avoided using money.  What I've described takes place only in the
final hour of the film; the first hour is spent in limbo, where we see
our heroes delivering some truly well-written dialogue.    </P>
<P>In any event, director Richard Donner is clearly more interested in the
subplots, probably because the subplots are far more interesting.  All
the female characters begin the film pregnant; Riggs' struggles come
when he realizes that Lorna wants to marry him.  Meanwhile, Murtaugh's
daughter is pregnant and married to Butters, but they've kept these
rather large secrets from her father.  Then there's Leo, who is, once
again, present for no discernable reason except to profusely utilize the
f-word and extract large bouts of laughter from the audience.</P>
<P>I don't often enjoy films when it's obvious that basically no thought
was put into the story.  This is a film that doesn't rely on plotting or
pacing, but on dialogue and individual episodes.  The film is so
successful as a comedy that I'm strangely dictated to ignore the serious
shortcomings in the story and simply enjoy it for the masterful and
fluid way in which it's been presented.  The action is nothing
particularly new, but it holds with the standards of the series.  There
is, however, a truly excellent finale which takes place on a dock in the
rain at night.  And I liked the scene that had Riggs surfing the street
on a wooden table.  </P>
<P>It's odd, really, that the film entirely forfeits a chance at a story,
and still manages character development.  It's nice to see that the
characters who've been brought back are the same, and fleshed out a
little bit more (even Riggs and Murtaugh).  It's also nice to see a
colorful supporting cast put to good use -- Rock is terrific and
hilarious as Murtaugh's new son-in-law, while Joe Pesci has removed
himself from my Most Hated Actors list by delivering a strangely
affecting and truly funny performance.  Li makes an effective and
sometimes-sympathetic villain.  And, of course, Gibson and Glover
maintain their undeniable chemistry which has made the series so popular
over the last decade.</P>
<P>Some people think that sheer entertainment value isn't enough to make a
film worth watching.  I think that it is, and when a film is as
skillfully assembled as Lethal Weapon 4, there's no reason to trash it
just because the story is absurd.  Sure, a better story would have made
a better movie, and I didn't always get the feeling that the people
involved were interested in making a good movie.  But that's irrelevant
-- I laughed, and the full theater of people with whom I watched this
film laughed, too.  I also cared about the characters, and felt good
when Riggs sees his newborn daughter for the first time.  Oh, who needs
a story, anyway?  </P>
