<P>THAT THING YOU DO, Tom Hanks' first writing and directing effort as
well as his ticket into the Hollywood realm of Actor-Directors, is a
sunny, soul-less psuedo-look at a one-hit band from smallsville and
their meteoric rise to fame.</P>
<P>In Erie, PA., a garage band lead by vocalist and songwriter Jimmy
(Jonathon Schaech) enter and win a local talent contest. This is
entirely due to sit-in drummer Guy (Tom Everett Scott), who joins at
the last minute when their regular drummer breaks his arm, and their
original, catchy ditty that is also the film's title song, "That Thing
You Do!" An appliance salesman at his father's store, Guy digs jazz
rhythms rather than the monotonous, mindless time-keeping that the
three-chord band requires. He increases the song's tempo at the last
minute, and the faster speed energizes the tune enough to get the whole
dancefloor shaking and, erm, twisting, I guess.</P>
<P>The win lands the band a gig at a nearby pizza restaurant near the
airport, and, like all airport restaruant gigs, this obviously leads to
Bigger Things. They make a record for fun, play more gigs, and sign
with a otherwise tacky agent who manage to get the local radio station
to play their song.</P>
<P>*This* then leads to their meeting with a Big-Time Play-Tone Records
agent, played by Tom Hanks, Mr White. White is kind of like those
slick, snakey agents that all successful entertainers in TV-Movies have
to meet and lose their careers to before they learn to value The
Important Things In Life. Once he signs them with Play-Tone, he starts
moulding them. He dresses them all in matching suits ("You look good in
gold, have I told you that? Very good") but develops their individual
"trademarks" (Guy gets a pair of sunglasses), changes their name to the
easier-understood "Wonders" and puts limits on the type of songs they
write.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, they've joined the Play-Tone state-fair tour, with groupie
girlfriend Faye (Liv Tyler) coming along as their costume mistress,
their single is soaring up the billboard charts, and each performance
is increasingly mobbed by the hordes of screaming teenage women that
I've only seen in black and white on Beatles' documentaries.  The
Wonders' popularity eventually leads to the ultimate big-step: their
national debut in a television broadcast.</P>
<P>It's at this point that things, which are  already fraying at the
seams, fall completely apart. Lead singer Jimmy, already prone to
throwing his increasingly esoteric and artistic temper about, abruptly
severs his relationship with the gorgeous Faye (a sure sign that he's
mad) and finally quits the band. Lenny, the most easy-going of the
four, takes off for Vegas and doesn't come back, and the last band
member runs off with newly-found Marine friends to Disneyland. Guy is
left alone in the first "real" recording studio he's ever been in on
the day of taping their new song.</P>
<P>Of course it doesn't end that way. In the same breezy vein that has
navigated the narrative from having The One-ders in their tacky
small-town environment to becoming The Wonders in their tacky big-time
glitzy showbusiness outfits, Guy ends up meeting Del Paxton, a jazz
soloist whom he revers, and makes a studio recording with him. Well
sure, that's what all drummers from Beatles-imitation bands long to
do.</P>
<P>Structurally, THAT THING YOU DO is a string of well-timed punchlines set
to sixties' musical drivel and a couple of more sophisticated riffs.
It's hard to believe that drummer Guy is good enough to replicate
professional jazz solo recordings and jam intelligently with his jazz
idol Del Paxton (Bill Cobbs), yet tolerates and enjoys his mundane
participation in The Wonders' success. Nor is it easy to believe that
the two Wonders bassists, whom Hanks takes pains to point out as finding
the song's basic chords difficult to follow when Guy picks up the tempo
at the contest, easily tread smooth, complicated basslines in the many
variations of the song that follow as The Wonders develop. </P>
<P>As though to qualify the story's chosen hero, Guy, Hanks has made him a
jazz-lover, someone who goes on to higher musical things once the pop
fantasy diversion is done with. For heavens' sake, we are actually told
that he eventually founds and teaches jazz composition at a music
school. </P>
<P>Like this outcome, nothing else in the film really makes sense.
Characters enter, and leave, and situations occur without any real
motivation, and the one serious scene in the film where Faye confronts
Jimmy is fraught with maudlin nonsense that undercuts her previously
likeable, sharp yet easy-going character. In the end, there's nothing to
care about in THAT THING YOU DO! because nothing bad, or good, has
actually happened. Like the title song, THAT THING YOU DO! is a shallow
briefing on the so-called lives of teenage pop stars that doesn't bother
with the heavy stuff, and disposes of them in the fastest possible way. </P>
<P>Still, I guess there are many reasons to like THAT THING YOU DO! Liv
Tyler, who seems to be spreading a little, is probably one of them, and
the catchy, guiless title song is another. I saw this film more than a
week ago and the tune is *still* spinning around in my head. Another
plus is the sheer casualness of everything: like the guiless,
self-contained theme song That Thing You Do! everything in the film is
mostly light-hearted dissin'. No Francis Ford Cuppola (WHEN PEGGY SUE
GOT MARRIED) or Oliver Stone-type angst for Hanks. This movie has got to
sing!</P>
<P>I think this film is worth $7, especially for those who want a little
more believability than local film ARMY DAZE (and much higher production
values), are sick of cop-slash-robber movies with flat jokes like
BULLETPROOF, and aren't all that into the "real-life" suspense of
RANSOM. THAT THING YOU DO! is a happy, happy film.</P>
<P>The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
 * Wait for the TV2 broadcast. 
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha! 
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend. 
 **** Amazing, potent stuff. 
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
