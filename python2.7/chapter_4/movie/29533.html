<P>If director John Dahl has a forté, it's his ability to take a story
featuring backwoods cops, seedy desert motels, filthy truck stops and dimly
lit bars full of lowlifes and make it enormously entertaining.  He also has
an uncanny knack for taking marginal B and C-list talent and making them
seem like Oscar contenders, even though the material is more akin to stuff
you'd find in a made-for-cable movie.</P>
<P>Actually, Dahl's two best films - Red Rock West and The Last Seduction -
debuted on pay cable, a medium that is taken slightly less seriously than
Tara Reid's chances of winning an Oscar.  The Academy doesn't even let films
like these qualify for their little year-end party, which was a shame
because Seduction's Linda Fiorentino deserved a Best Actress nomination (she
won the Independent Spirit Award, as well as trophies from critics in London
and New York).</P>
<P>But Joy Ride is a different story...or is it?  The film is getting a wide
release from a major distributor, but it's still set in the desert and is
populated by the same small-town cretins we grew to lovingly despise in West
and Seduction.  There are no big stars here, and there are barely any little
ones, either.  And the scariest thing of all is that Ride has been sitting
on the shelf nearly as long as O, the monumentally delayed modern update of
Othello (filming wrapped in early 2000).</P>
<P>But Ride is a surprisingly good little flick.  It's about a straight-laced
Berkeley student named Lewis (Paul Walker, The Fast and the Furious) who has
a crush on a girl from his New Jersey hometown.  Lewis buys a used car to
pick up Venna (Leelee Sobieski, Here on Earth) in Boulder, hoping the two
will bond during the cross-country drive.  But right before he leaves, Lewis
finds out his older brother Fuller (Steve Zahn, Saving Silverman) has just
been busted for a DUI in Salt Lake City.  No problem - Salt Lake City is on
the way to Boulder, so Lewis bails Fuller out and agrees to drive him as far
as Denver.</P>
<P>Grateful for the bail and ride, Fuller buys Lewis a CB radio so the two can
monitor police activity as they speed through the dusty west. Saying the CB
is like "a prehistoric internet," the bored Fuller talks his brother into
impersonating a woman to lure a desperate-sounding trucker with the handle
"Rusty Nail" to a hotel room with the promise of a good time.  The boys stay
in the room next-door and listen like a couple of giggling schoolgirls
before falling asleep.</P>
<P>They awaken to a grisly scene in the next room and shortly thereafter find
out Rusty Nail (voiced by Matthew Kimbrough) knows who they are and is
hell-bent on revenge.  Dahl expertly ratchets up the tension into an
edge-of-your-seat frenzy that only gets the slightest bit silly when Rusty
Nail's truck is trying to run them down (it's too much like Christine,
Jeepers Creepers or that dopey Metallica video).  Dahl never shows us what
Rusty Nail looks like, which helps to make the story all the more
disturbing.</P>
<P>It's a pretty simple idea, but the whole thing is brought to life by Ride's
two screenwriters, who have each directed enjoyable television shows (Clay
Tarver, Upright Citizens Brigade and Jeffrey Abrams, Felicity).  Like Dahl's
previous films, he gets great performances from his actors, too.  Walker
shows his decent performance in Furious wasn't a fluke (although I'm still
not entirely convinced - he's way too pretty to be any good, right?) and
even gets naked with Zahn for one scene.</P>
<P>1:32 -R for violence/terror and language</P>
