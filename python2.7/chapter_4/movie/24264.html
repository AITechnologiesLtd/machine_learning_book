"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Das Boot is the Holy Grail of submarine movies.  It's so good that you
have to wonder why anyone would bother making a film about subs after
Boot was released in 1982.  You know, kind of like how Ben-Hur ruined
the whole `chariot race' genre for everyone else.  Granted, you'd be
better off spending your $20 for tickets and popcorn on the the
director's cut of Boot on DVD instead, but U-571 is still damn
entertaining.</P>
<P>Sure, it's as close to Boot as Mulholland Falls is to L.A. Confidential,
but U-571 is an edge-of-your-seat good time.  And who woulda thunk it,
coming from this bunch of `auteurs'?  Director Jonathan Mostow's only
previous mainstream directorial credit was 1997's reprehensible
Breakdown. Mostow penned the script with Breakdown cronie Sam Montgomery
and some other guy named David Ayer, a former Navy sonarman who had
never written a feature film.  The talent in front of the camera isn't
particularly awe-inspiring, either.  Matthew McConaughey?  Bill Paxton?
Not much brain activity there.  Harvey Keitel?  I only recently regained
my sight after seeing him in a dress and lipstick in Holy Smoke.  Jon
Bon Jovi?  ‘Nuff said.</P>
<P>U-571's story isn't that fantastic, but it does offer the best cinematic
macguffin since `the Process' from David Mamet's The Spanish Prisoner.
The film is set in the Atlantic Ocean during the spring of 1942, where
German U-boats have their way with Allied ships while slowly approaching
the east coast of the United States.  The German's sea supremacy is
unmatched, partly due to the fact that the Allied Forces are unable to
decipher the transmissions that they intercept from their adversaries.
If the Allies could only get their hands on Germany's `Enigma' machine,
they could crack the code and possibly turn the tide of war to their
favor.</P>
<P>And that's just what U-571 is about.  The crew of a rickety, antiquated
Word War I submarine are ordered to disguise themselves as German
soldiers and take over a disabled sub stranded in the middle of the
Atlantic and capture the mysterious `Enigma' device.  The American sub,
skippered by Captain Dahlgren (Paxton, Mighty Joe Young), is even
doctored to look like a German U-boat, and a German-speaking officer
(Jake Weber, In Too Deep) and combat Marine (David Keith, A Family
Thing) are included in the mission.</P>
<P>Of course, the mission doesn't go exactly as planned, otherwise there
would be no movie.  The Americans end up aboard the German vessel, but
the ship is beyond repair.  To make matters worse, they can't read the
controls, they only have one torpedo remaining, and they insist on
keeping the German Captain (Thomas Kretschmann) aboard the ship as a
prisoner.  Gee, I wonder if he's going to break free at a really
dramatic moment in the film?</P>
<P>There are more predictable things in the film, mostly revolving around
McConaughey's (edTV) Lieutenant Andrew Tyler.  As the film opens, we
learn that he was passed over for promotion because Captain Dahlgren
says he doesn't possess the ability to sacrifice his own men if the
situation deems it necessary.  Gee, I wonder if Tyler will end up in
charge of the mission and have to sacrifice his own men?</P>
<P>Yet despite the predictability, lack of capable stars and weak script,
U-571 still succeeds.  The sound is remarkable, especially during scenes
where the sub is being pummeled by depth charges.  In fact, these scenes
are so well done that they jammed three of them into the film (the third
time was a little much).  The film, while not based on a true story, is
dedicated to the brave men that captured the `Enigma' machine, which was
apparently an actual device that truly did shift the balance of power in
the Atlantic over to the Allies.</P>
<P>2:00 - PG-13 for war violence and adult language</P>
