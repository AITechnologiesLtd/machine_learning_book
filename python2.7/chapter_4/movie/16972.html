October Sky **1/2
rated PG
starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, Laura Dern
written by Lewis Colick
based on the book "Rocket Boys" by Homer H. Hickam Jr.
directed by Joe Johnston</PRE>
<P>There is a certain character we've seen many times before in American
cinema. He is the unlikely hero; a boy who perseveres enough to pursue his
dreams. In OCTOBER SKY, that character is Homer Hickam. The movie is based,
however loosely, on Homer's autobiography, "Rocket Boys". It is the story of
a boy from Coalwood, West Virginia, who witnesses the launching of Russia's
Sputnik rocket into the October sky in 1957, and is immediately obsessed
with building one of his own. In an early scene, Homer, not cut out for
football, tries out for the team anyway, and recieves a comment from his
coach who tells him that he just doesn't give up. Homer doesn't make the
team, but we have evidence that he is not an ordinary boy. That is why when
he tells his parents that he wants to build a rocket, it comes as no
surprise. Homer, influenced by a school teacher(Laura Dern), gets 3 friends,
including the school nerd, Quentin(Chris Owen), to help him build this
rocket. Soon, even after a few failed launches, they are the talk of the
town. These nerds have become the new jocks. Cheerleaders skip a football
game in order to cheer the rocket boys. Everyone in town is interested.
Everyone, that is, except for Homer's father, John Hickam.</P>
<P>John is the head of the coal mining corporation that is the sole purpose of
Coalwood. Only the football players get college scholarships; everyone else
goes to work in the mines. John is very disappointed that Homer is
interested in this "dumb rocket business", and wants him to follow in his
footsteps. Homer, of course, wants to do something different, being the boy
that he is. The father-son relationship at the heart of OCTOBER SKY works
very well for most of the film, because of the great performance of Chris
Cooper. Cooper, from John Sayles' LONE STAR, is used to playing roles in
which he is a quiet outsider. His perfromance in OCTOBER SKY is exactly the
opposite. As John, Cooper shows depth and talent rarely seen in big name
actors. Relative newcomer Jake Gyllenhaal, whom I've had the pleasure of
seeing in one of his school musicals, is also quite good, but he is
outshined by Cooper.</P>
<P>>From what you have read above, you are probably under the impression that
OCTOBER SKY is a excellent, moving film. But the sad truth is, OCTOBER SKY
is predictable, melodramatic, and overly sentimental. There are moments in
OCTOBER SKY in which I was thinking about just how much of Hickam's book was
actually put into this film. This film is so predictable and by-the-numbers,
that I kept hoping for some kind of originality to appear. Also, writer
Lewis Colick(GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI) pushes all the wrong emotional buttons
in trying to get us to like OCTOBER SKY. This wouldn't be all that
disappointing in another movie, but watching this one, you can tell that
there is a touch of greatness trying to break out of this sugary-sweet mess.
But I have to give props to the producers of OCTOBER SKY, for showing us the
first '99 film with even a little ambition.
