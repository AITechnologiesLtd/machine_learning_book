<P>        Twenty years is a long time. You would think that a movie considered
"hip", by teenagers twenty years ago, wouldn't sit that well with today's
teens. Well, if you thought that about Grease you'd be wrong. I attended
the film on it's opening night, March 27th, it was a sold out viewing- with
more teen girls then I saw at Titanic. What is it about this movie that
keeps yet another generation fascinated? Who knows…</P>
<P>        Danny(John Travolta) is the coolest greaser at Rydell High, and a member
of the T-Birds. During the summer he meets an Australian girl, Sandy(Olivia
Newton-John), at the beach. He enjoys his summer fling with her, but when
she doesn't return to Australia and shows up at Rydell, things get a little
complicated. Danny is forced to decide if he should try to impress Sandy by
becoming a jock, or continue hanging out with his T-Bird gang. </P>
<P>        I have seen this movie many times, but never in the theater. It was a
totally new experience seeing it with other people, who sang along and even
did the hand jive in their seats. The audience I saw it with seemed to have
a great time, and even applauded when it was all over. The music is really
catchy and the dancing is nicely choreographed. It is a fun movie, and
while it may not be anywhere near perfect it is a great experience.</P>
