<PRE>VERY BAD THINGS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Peter Berg directs this messy (in more ways than one) black comedy.  But
while it certainly is dark and morbid...someone forgot the laughs in
this dreary film.</P>
<P>Very Bad Things tells the tale of a bachelor party that goes horribly
wrong.  Kyle Fisher (Jon Favreau) is preparing to marry the controlling
Laura Garrety (Cameron Diaz).  For his final fling, his pal Robert Boyd
(Christian Slater) has planned a fun-filled party in Vegas.</P>
<P>Along for the adventure are Kyle's quiet mechanic buddy, Charles (Leland
Orser), and two of his co-workers, Adam (Daniel Stern) and Michael
Berkow (Jeremy Piven).</P>
<P>Things begin to go bad when the stripper (Carla Scott) hired by Boyd
meets an unfortunate, accidental demise.  Rather than report the death,
the five men decide to cover it up...but their problems start to rapidly
escalate from there.</P>
<P>If you couldn't tell, this is a rather bleak comedy, and the situations
just keep getting bleaker.  Unfortunately, the comedy doesn't keep pace.
The film is obviously attempting to reach for some morbid laughs, but it
just doesn't get them.</P>
<P>Take the characters, for example.  They're all given little
idiosyncrasies, but rather than being comic, most of them are merely
annoying.  These aren't people you'd really care to spend any time with,
in or out of the theater.</P>
<P>The situation (normal guys in an abnormal situation) is familiar, yet
something just never clicks here.  Even the usually watchable Cameron
Diaz becomes mildly repulsive in this film.</P>
<P>Filmmakers should learn never to use words like "Very Bad" in the title
of their films.  It's too convenient a place for such an apt description
of the film.</P>
