<P>"Don't worry. Nobody would ever believe you're capable of doing what 
you've done." So it goes in the strikingly effective thriller, "A Simple 
Plan," where even words of consolation come with a sting. For the 
production, writer Scott B. Smith reworked his hit novel into a focused, 
economic script, which director Sam Raimi has crafted into that rarest of 
creations, a movie that is better than the book. To best enjoy the film, 
I'd suggest you not read the rest of this piece until after you've 
returned from the theater. If you choose to continue, remember that 
you've been warned. </P>
<P>"A Simple Plan" chronicles the results of a fateful decision made by 
three men on a winter day outside their small, Midwestern hometown. When 
Hank (Bill Paxton), his brother Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jacob's 
friend Lou (Brent Briscoe) come across a downed plane containing a dead 
body and a bag with over $4 million in cash, they huddle to discuss what 
they should do. </P>
<P>Hank wants to turn everything over to the police. After all, he and his 
wife Sarah (Bridget Fonda) already have a wonderful life. Hank is a 
respected member of the community with a good job, and the couple has a 
baby on the way. Everything is fine just the way it is. But Jacob and Lou,
 both poor and miserable, have different ideas. After much arguing, they 
come up with a simple plan. Hank will hold the money until the plane is 
discovered by others and the subsequent investigation completed. Once 
they are sure that the authorities are finished, they'll split the bounty,
 leave town and move on to better lives elsewhere.</P>
<P>But, of course, matters rarely go as planned. All too soon, distrust and 
greed stir up unresolved issues from the men's pasts. The film has an 
amazing number of twists and turns, including several violent moments, 
but nothing ever feels contrived. This is storytelling at its most 
genuine, with detailed, believable characters and considerable acumen. </P>
<P>"A Simple Plan" is set against a background of snow, effectively 
establishing a crisp, stark atmosphere that aides the film immeasurably. 
The ominous tone builds slowly and surely; even the periodic bursts of 
gallows humor serve to underscore the ever increasing sense of dread. 
Director Raimi handles Smith's words beautifully, aided by a superb cast 
who make every sentence crackle with authenticity. </P>
<P>As the mistrust grows, relationships are examined and reexamined, and the 
effect is mesmerizing. Most thrillers are content to just follow the 
central plotline, but this film pokes and prods areas rarely examined. 
Jacob and Lou express their resentment over the way Hank talks to them, 
and we get an insightful glimpse into the middle American class system, 
where individuals with less education, little money or weak social skills 
are marginalized by the better schooled. </P>
<P>Listen to the exchanges between brothers Hank and Jacob, forced into 
intimacy by circumstance, and you'll understand how easy it is to put 
human beings into neat, categorized little boxes; to use selective 
memories to create nostalgia for a glossy, comfortable past that never 
was. As an average man in way over his head, Bill Paxton gives the best 
performance of his career, and Billy Bob Thornton is nothing short of 
phenomenal as Jacob, a grimy outcast who is far more observant and 
intelligent that he appears to be. </P>
<P>Watch Hank and Sarah, who start the film content with their storybook 
existence together, only to have their perception of the good life 
perverted by the lure of wealth. It's fascinating, and frightening, to 
witness their change in attitude. Bridget Fonda is a wonder to behold, 
transforming from a blissful mother-to-be into a woman who views all she 
once treasured as a trap, a purgatory of repetitious mediocrity from 
which escape is mandatory. </P>
<P>"A Simple Plan" is a stunning psychological study of lives unraveling, of 
promises betrayed and hope turned to dust. Early in the film, a character 
refers to the cache of money as "the American dream... in a gym bag." 
Raimi and Smith's powerful "A Simple Plan" shows the consequences of 
pursuing a dream at the expense of your own humanity.  </P>
