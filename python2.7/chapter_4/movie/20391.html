<P>Good horror stories are a dime a dozen mainly because writers and directors
have lost the imagination to tell them - gore and dismemberment have stood in
the way of cohesive storytelling elements. "The Blair Witch Project" is a great
horror film whereas "The Sixth Sense" is merely a good one - a sensitively
written, well-directed story of a journey into the world of ghosts. This film
along with Bruce Joel Rubin's "Ghost" play with the idea that ghosts inhabit
the earth for a reason - to complete some unfinished business.</P>
<P>"The Sixth Sense" begins with Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), a psychologist
who at the start of the film is shot in his home by a deeply disturbed patient
of his. A year later, the seemingly recouped Malcolm finds a morose, quiet boy
named Cole (Haley Joel Osment) suffering from similar problems as Malcolm's
former patient - Cole becomes Crowe's latest study. It turns out that Cole can
see ghosts in his own home, though nobody else can. One is a nervous, evidently
abused woman in a pink robe, the other is a girl who brings Cole some
mysterious box, and so on. Crowe is mystified and intrigued by Cole's visions,
yet he does have problems of his own. Crowe's forlorn wife, Anna (Olivia
Williams), suffers from depression and is ostensibly having an affair, which
angers him enough to throw rocks through storefront windows. They seem unable
to communicate, and she leaves hastily when he is late for a dinner date. He is
consumed by work, she is consumed by sadness. </P>
<P>"The Sixth Sense" is mostly told through the point-of-view of Cole - we see
these visions through his eyes. No adult can see them, but the good doctor
begins to believe him. The best scenes are when Cole is scared and tense about
some of the ghosts intruding in his home, or when he senses something
unspeakable in a dungeon-like room at a friend's house. There is also a scene
where Cole sees a car accident victim while trying to convince his mother (Toni
Collete) that he "sees dead people." </P>
<P>There are some effective scenes of controlled tension, and without the
minimalist strength of Willis's performance or Osment's whispered innocence,
"The Sixth Sense" might have fallen apart from lesser hands. It is only when
dealing with Cole's and Crowe's inner lives that writer-director N. Night
Shyamalan ("Wide Awake") fails to lend much weight. </P>
<P>Olivia Williams, the incandescent co-star of "Rushmore," is given little to do,
and her role lacks development or impact. Somehow, we know she does not listen
or communicate with Crowe, but we learn little about her and her feelings. </P>
<P>There is also scant development regarding Osment's mother - we get mostly
reaction shots and a big emotional scene but little in the way of knowing how
she relates to her tense son. She almost seems to avoid him, or not pay much
mind when she finds the kitchen's drawers and doors open a second after leaving
them intact while her son is eating. </P>
<P>"The Sixth Sense" has a haunting sense of menace through its controlled level
of mood and pace (the city of Philadelphia never looked so daunting and
overcast), but it is off-kilter in its emotional context. Its surprise ending
pays off nicely, but there is none of the unifying breadth or tension of the
similar, dream-like "Jacob's Ladder." Still, Willis and Osment keep you
involved and guessing as to what will happen next. </P>
