FAITHLESS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>FAITHLESS (TROLÖSA), a 2-1/2 hour angst-filled drama in Swedish about 
the everlasting trauma caused by infidelity, might sound like something 
you would look forward to about as much as getting your teeth drilled.  
But this film, based on a script by Ingmar Bergman and lovingly directed 
by his long-time collaborator Liv Ullmann is absolutely mesmerizing.  
With an astonishing central performance by Lena Endre as Marianne, the 
woman who strays, the film relies on long, talking-head shots of her 
relating her story.  Watching it on television, you might be inclined to 
flip the channel, but, in a movie theater, the experience becomes so 
engrossing that your eyelids may stop blinking.</P>
<P>The screenplay's structure is quite imaginative.  We meet an older 
writer named Bergman (Erland Josephson) who is preparing a script in his 
study.  For material he calls upon an actress, Marianne, with whom he 
has worked extensively.  Like someone relating one of the turning points 
in her life, Marianne begins to create the story from scratch.  Although 
most of the story is told in flashback, Ullman keeps cutting back to the 
study for Marianne to talk directly to the camera.  Since these long 
narrative scenes are just as memorable as the flashbacks, it is hard to 
pick a favorite, as both are so exquisite and hauntingly composed.   </P>
<P>Marianne's story, which Ullman in the press notes says is based on an 
incident in Ingmar Bergman's life, stars Marianne as an attractive, 
40-year-old woman torn between two men.  Like the unusual structure of 
the script, the love affair doesn't follow the conventional cinematic 
formula.  With a palpable honesty, the story follows an affair that 
starts innocently and is more about intimacy than sex.  Indeed, were it 
not for a couple of scenes with explicit sexual discussions, the film 
might have gotten a PG-13 rating.  Don't be confused, however, for this 
is a serious adult film.</P>
<P>The story-within-the-story, which, of course, is the real story, 
concerns an actress, Marianne, who is married to an internationally 
known conductor, Markus (Thomas Hanzon).  The strikingly handsome Markus 
is so attentive to Marianne that she confesses that she sometimes so 
loses her head during sex that she passes out.  In short, he is not the 
type of guy who inspires his wife to go looking for greener pastures.</P>
<P>David (Krister Henriksson), on the other hand, is the solid looking type 
who wouldn't turn any heads but is ruggedly handsome.  He is a stage 
director with whom Marianne has worked closely for years.  She tells us 
that he is like her brother.  One night when Markus is gone, David and 
Marianne enjoy a late night dinner at her house.  Too tired to drive, 
David suggests, innocently enough it seems, that he spend the night 
there in her bed.  He is emotionally troubled so he'd like her to hold 
his hand.  After much giggling and awkwardness, she agrees, insisting to 
us that this will not be incest.  And she is right -- for a time -- 
since nothing happens that night.</P>
<P>Their decision that fateful evening sets them on a trajectory which is 
as certain as a rocket's.  They will eventually come crashing down to 
earth, and it won't be pretty.  Bergman's script is so full of grace and 
subtlety that the picture almost completely avoids incendiary polemics.  
The few times when emotions do run out of control are the picture's low 
points.</P>
<P>As the tragedy heightens, Markus and Marianne's 8-year-old daughter, 
Isabelle (Michelle Gylemo), moves more to the foreground.  She becomes a 
victim of the actions of the adults in her life.  No KRAMER VS. KRAMER 
tale, the movie keeps the focus on the adults even if it is the child 
who most deserves our sympathy.</P>
<P>"Our affinity lay in our memory," Marianne, towards the end, says to 
Bergman about David.  "We grieved for what we had lost."  Deeply 
touching, the movie will stay long in your memory, especially Lena 
Endre's absolutely unforgettable work in it.  It is Oscar worthy acting 
and certainly light-years better than Juliette Binoche's Oscar nominated 
part in CHOCOLAT.</P>
<P>FAITHLESS runs 2:25.  The film is in Swedish with English subtitles.  It 
is rated R for sexual content, some nudity and language and would be 
acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
