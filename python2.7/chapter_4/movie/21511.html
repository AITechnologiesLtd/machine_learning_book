<P>IN SHORT: Almost compelling. But you know what they say about almost...</P>
<P>Slow and deliberate pacing is all well and good for the first hour of an
end of the year flick, but when the fireworks at the core of the story
finally hit, it would be very nice if they sustained themselves for a
bit. It would be even nicer if they weren't backed up by a soundtrack
vocal that sounds like the wail of a peasant woman being tortured. But
they don't and they are and good is not good enough in Oscar season.</P>
<P>Michael Mann's The Insider dramatizes the story of a botched 60 Minutes
report on the addictive properties of cigarettes. Botch may be the wrong
word; It wasn't factually inaccurate story -- at the center of the storm
is a fired research V.P. for the Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco company
named Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe). His knowledge of the effects of
chemical additives mixed with cigarette tobacco would eventually supply
the evidence that forced the `Seven Dwarves' (the big tobacco companies)
into a $246 Billion dollar settlement. When 60 minutes was ready to air
their story, the threat of a multi-Billion dollar lawsuit by B&Y coupled
with, and this is how The Insider presents it, the pending sale of CBS
to Westinghouse and all the stock option profits that would be lost
because of such a suit caused management to stomp on News. 60 Minutes
aired an `alternate' story. One which didn't include the on-camera
testimony of Wigand.</P>
<P>Even before the corporate power play, Wigand found himself followed,
threatened, unable to find work in his professional capacity as a
researcher (he became a schoolteacher). His marriage dissolved, and a
high powered public relations firm engineered a nation smear of his
reputation. The man he trusted his story to, who assured him (as he had
so many others) of the integrity of CBS News was Lowell Bergman (Al
Pacino). Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) was the correspondent the
story was produced for. Don Hewitt (Philip Baker Hall) is the CBS News
executive who guides, actually he created, 60 Minutes. All but Bergman,
to some extent, folded to pressure from Management (Gina Gershon as the
corporate lawyer who stands to lose millions if the story isn't spiked)
and aired an `alternate' version of the story, masking Wigand's face and
voice in a manner that is downright cheesy.</P>
<P>It isn't hard to disassociate the actors from the real life characters
they play, all but Wallace (and Wigand, if you've followed the story
very closely) are fairly anonymous to the general public. Christopher
Plummer has Wallace's vocal inflection and physical manner down pat --
and all I know about Mike Wallace is what I've seen on teevee for the
last thirty or so years -- and the real life Wallace doesn't come off as
badly as he thought he would. By which I mean . . .</P>
<P>In the real life news biz sometimes telling most of the story can
deliver most of the message. I speak from a couple of years experience
at NBC News (the biggest names I worked with were Jane Pauley and Roger
Mudd). In this case going with the alternate story is acceptable to
Wallace who is facing his last years and worrying about the rep that
will live on. When he reads a New York Times editorial saying 60 Minutes
had `betrayed the legacy of Edward R. Murrow,' Plummer's Wallace is
justifiably cut to the quick and reacts. You get a good sense of the
politics of the newsroom in what follows.</P>
<P>Al Pacino knows how to bring fire and passion to a role. Pacino's
character has a couple of other stories in development and you get a
good notion of what working the newsbeat is like. But when his Bergman
sees his story about to get spiked, he find the alternative
`acceptable.' His efforts to get the real story out should've brought
them ol' fireworks to the screen. The fuse is lit many times but the
sparks rarely fly.</P>
<P>Michael Mann's pacing kills the effort dead. There's nothing that gets
in the way of the central story but, when a lot of that story involves
great soul searching on everybody's part, that means we spend a lot of
time watching people think. That also means that the time devoted to
Wigand and his family, Diane Lane as his wife Liane, doesn't provide
enough info to stab our emotional hearts when she grabs the kids and
runs away from the coming media onslaught. I can't point a finger at
Crowe, he's done too much good work before. I have had problems with
Michael Mann's writing/directing; yes, I know I'm not supposed to
compare films but I'm comparing styles here, and I haven't much liked
Mann's.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Insider, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$4.00</PRE>
<P>Wait for pay per view. At this time of year, the longer they get, the
better they should be. With nominations on the line, the contenders get
a more severe looking over. Our nod would go to Plummer's Wallace,
though Pacino is a no-brainer.</P>
