<P>Jill Sprecher's "Clockwatchers," is my favorite type of film. It is a 
film that effortlessly observes characters and situations in an everyday 
setting, and feels as if you could be watching a documentary because it 
is so real.</P>
<P>At the start of, "Clockwatchers," Iris (Toni Collette), a shy, 
frumpy-looking young woman, starts a job at a credit office as a temp 
secretary, and is able to break out of her weak shell thanks to meeting 
and becoming friends with three other temps at the office---the 
rebellious Margaret (Parker Posey), who shows Iris the ropes; Paula 
(Lisa Kudrow), a beautiful woman who always claims she is in the middle 
of acting jobs, but we sense is just trying to cover up her unhappiness; 
and Jane (Alanna Ubach), who is about to marry an insensitive guy who 
tries to buy her things everytime he does something wrong. As the film 
follows these four completely original and intriguing characters, an 
underlying story develops, involving a mystery worker at the office who 
is stealing the belongings of everyone else. Could one of Iris' friends 
be behind the crime, or is it Cleo (Helen Fitzgerald), an unusual, 
silent character who has just been brought into the company as vice 
executive?</P>
<P>"Clockwatchers" is a jewel of a film, and it was so refreshing to watch 
the characters and their various interactions with each other that I 
totally got caught up in it. </P>
<P>Thanks to the smart, perceptive screenplay, also written by Sprecher, 
and the performances by all four leads, the characters easily were able 
to come alive. Collette is outstanding as the repressed person in the 
group who slowly grows stronger as she becomes friends with the other 
three. Posey is winning and humorous, as a woman who hides behind a 
shield of one-liners and sarcasm, blocking herself from everyone else. 
And Kudrow is startlingly touching as the blonde bombshell who knows she 
isn't getting what she expected out of her life.</P>
<P>The mystery that surrounds the picture does not feel at all like a 
gimmick, even though it very well could have, and is highly 
unpredictable and surprising, and the final revelation is quiet and 
moving.</P>
<P>Credit also must go to the way that the film portrays the life of an 
office worker. For temp secretaries, their days are filled with long, 
empty hours of sitting, being bored, and doing petty chores such as 
copying applications and stapling papers. We rarely ever get to see this 
sort of close observation in a work setting on film, and it was 
fascinating from the first frame to the last.</P>
<P>If there is any sort of problem with "Clockwatchers," it is that more 
could have been done with the supporting characters, but this does not 
at all put a dent in the effectiveness of, "Clockwatchers," which is an 
affirming, confidant first film from Jill Sprecher, a talent I hope we 
get to see a lot more of in the future.</P>
