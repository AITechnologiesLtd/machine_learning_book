<PRE>                         TAKING SIDES
               A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>    CAPSULE: This is a film that avoids easy answers.  Wilhelm 
    Furtwangler, then the world's greatest orchestra conductor 
    stayed in Germany and cooperated with the Nazis.  What were 
    his views, was he a war criminal or a secret resistance 
    fighter?  How much did he know about crimes against humanity?  
    The US government investigated him after the war and this 
    film is a dramatization of that investigation.  Rating: 
    8 (0 to 10), high +2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>In my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is 
Istvan Szabo's SUNSHINE, a film that covers the fortunes of a 
Jewish Hungarian family under the reigns of three different 
regimes, Hungarian aristocrats, Nazis, and Communists.  Szabo's 
follow-up film, a German production, is much more limited in 
scope.  It is about the post-war investigation of who criminally 
supported the Nazis and who opposed them.  Ronald Harwood's 
screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great 
classical music conductor who stayed on in Germany when the Nazis 
took power and became the most popular conductor of the Third 
Reich.</P>
<P>Maj. Steve Arnold (played by Harvey Keitel) has been assigned by 
his superiors to investigate Wilhelm Furtwangler (Stellan 
Skarsgard), perhaps Europe's greatest classical music conductor.  
When other artists fled Germany, Furtwangler remained behind and 
conducted for the Hitler and his henchmen.  After the war is over 
Arnold assigned to interview Furtwangler and members of his 
orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes.  He 
secretly is told by his commanding officer to find Furtwangler 
guilty.  From there we follow him and learn a little about Arnold 
and something about Furtwangler and his orchestra.  As he 
interviews members of the wartime orchestra Arnold starts noticing 
odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy 
against his investigation.  There is a certain sameness to the 
responses that he is getting.  Perhaps any cooperation he is 
getting has been in some ways managed.  If so, perhaps he can 
never come to the truth.</P>
<P>In large part the film is about mind games that Arnold uses to 
manipulate his interviewees and especially Furtwangler.  Where the 
script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous.  It has 
no obvious resolution and not much of a final act.  When it is 
over whether anything has been established is open to 
interpretation.  Perhaps that is better than so many films that 
make it all to obvious what the audience should believe, but it is 
like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the 
killer is.  We are given clues to something but they are never 
tied up.  In the end we just know more about both Arnold and 
Furtwangler.</P>
<P>The film is basically a stage play.  The visual is not very 
important.  Corners are cut visually including touches like 
filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on 
location.  As with a stage play, what this film centers on the 
dialog, and that is intriguing.  I rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 
10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.  [There is one piece 
of sloppiness few people but me would notice.  At one point we 
clearly see Arnold's desk calendar say "Jan 16 Tues."  A quick 
mental calculation told me that combination could occur in 1945 
and then not again until 1951.  The events had to take place in 
1946 or 1947.  A possible date could be obtained from any World 
Almanac.] </P>
