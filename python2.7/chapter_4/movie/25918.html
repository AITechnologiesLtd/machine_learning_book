<PRE>                             STATE AND MAIN
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     In order to see one of 2000's real treasures, most of you are going
to have to wait until January of 2001, when the masterful State and Main
comes to a theater near you.</P>
<P>     State and Main, written and directed by David Mamet (The Spanish
Prisoner, The Winslow Boy, House of Games), follows a Hollywood film
crew into the sleepy town of Waterford, Vermont, for the shooting of a
would-be blockbuster.  William H. Macy plays the director -- part
ballbuster, part smooth-talker -- who comes to Waterford after the
production kicked out of another lost-in-the-past New England locale.</P>
<P>     Waterford is perfect for the period piece, and the crew descends on
the village, upending the status quo, even turning geriatrics into movie
star wannabes.  Among the crew are David Paymer as the crazed producer
who wants to score some cash for a product placement for "Bazoomer.com"
despite the town's 1896 setting.  (Note to enterprising cybersquatters:
Mamet owns the domain already.  I checked.)  The excellent Phillip
Seymour Hoffman plays the stammering screenwriter, ironically unable to
find his own words much of the time.  Star and starlet are played by
Alec Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker, both in over-the-top roles that
nail the Hollywood ego trip perfectly.</P>
<P>     Notable townfolk include Julia Stiles as a barely pubescent
teenager infatuated with Baldwin and determined to bed him (and which
doesn't take much).  Charles Durning plays the pushover, starstruck
mayor to perfection, Patti LuPone his overbearing wife.  And Rebecca
Pidgeon -- aka Mrs. Mamet -- has a gem of a star turn as the
wise-beyond-her-years, local bookstore owner trying to organize an
amateur theater group -- who all abandon her when the film crew comes to
town.</P>
<P>     This story's been done before -- in fact, it's been done to death
-- but never with such flair and pulling off such a perfect skewering of
Hollywood.  (In fact, Mamet has been over roughly this same ground
recently with Wag the Dog.)  Hilarious from start to finish, State and
Main has so few lulls and so many memorable parts that it's hard not to
be hungry for more after it's over.  (Best line: "It's not a lie, it's a
gift for fiction.")</P>
<P>     Mamet juggles various intertwining plots (Parker doesn't want to do
a nude scene, Baldwin wrecks his car with the girl inside, etc. etc.)
with perfect aplomb.  The best story line also happens to include the
two best actors in the picture -- Hoffman and Pidgeon -- who find
themselves in the most peculiar -- and believable -- romance I think
I've ever seen on screen or off.</P>
<P>     State and Main also stays light thanks to Mamet's backing away from
his trademark clipped cadence, at least a little bit -- this dialogue is
so good it transcends just about anything you could do to it.  At the
same time, the movie is full of depth, nuance, and themes-within-themes,
courtesy of its movie-within-a-movie structure.</P>
<P>     I'm giving State and Main an early line for at least four Oscars
(including one for Hoffman's performance), not to mention my nod for
best picture of the year-to-date.  I hope this gem can get the buzz
going.  Go you Huskies!</P>
