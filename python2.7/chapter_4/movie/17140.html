<PRE>A Review By Adam Godfrey</PRE>
<P>   I know it already opened in December, but I finally got around to seeing
Rushmore last weekend, and it was one of those rare oppritunites that I got to
leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price. As the
final scene closed out in happy slow-mo fashion, I felt happy to have been
priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking.
  Jason Schwartzman, his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and
glasses, steals the show as Max Fischer, the most well known Rushmore Academy
student who gets terrible grades, but compensates for it by organizing most of
the school's clubs and organizations (i.e. the fencing team and writing and
producing school plays) and often pulling outrageous stunts, one that
eventually earns him an expulsion.
   This stunt, building an aquarium on the school's baseball diamond, is a plot
to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia
Williams). He funds this aquarium with the help of millionare Herman Blume (a
very Oscarworthy Bill Murray), who eventually finds himself falling in love
with Miss Cross.
   Rosemary and Herman begin dating-and the fun begins; Herman and Max go at it
head to head in a battle for Miss Cross. Herman manages to destroy Max's bike,
while Max cuts Herman's brakes, and it goes on like this. But eventually Max
realizes he is too young for Miss Cross, and he can't stand in the way of two
people in love.
   The Academy of Arts & Sciences really messed up this year; they completely
overlooked Rushmore (and, if you ask me, it wasn't an accident). It maybe
wasn't Best Picture material, but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod
(instead of Elizabeth), and Bill Murray's absense from the ballot is a complete
snub.
   The entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good; at one point it's
fun, and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic. The cinematography gives
the movie an important feeling, as well. 
   I hope Rushmore can overcome its' Oscar snubs, and be enjoyed by intelligent
film goers. Grade: A</P>
