<PRE>                                JACOB'S LADDER
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Eerie Gordian knot of a horror film
     requires a lot of thought, but finally pays off in the car on
     the way home from the theater.  Give it a chance to sink in.
     Murky photography used to even better advantage than in
     FLATLINERS.  (Do not read the spoiler note at the end of this
     review if you have not seen the film.)  Rating: +2 (-4 to
     +4).</PRE>
<P>     Within the space of a few short months Bruce Joel Rubin has had two
films he has written released.  Each deals with death.  GHOST had a few
heavy horror moments but they were counter-acted by a lot of lighter and
more pleasant moments.  "Pleasant," however, is not a term applicable to any
single sequence in JACOB'S LADDER.  While it probably has the more
intelligent and demanding story, JACOB'S LADDER is a Gordian knot of
unpleasant concepts.  It is a story of disturbing horror requiring some
effort and detective work to come to any consistent interpretation and then
open to multiple interpretations.  This is one weird movie.</P>
<P>     It is October 6, 1971, and a company of American soldiers in Vietnam is
getting ready to move into battle.  Suddenly something is going very wrong.
Some of the men are convulsing; others are running around fighting as if an
enemy, whom we do not see, is right there on top of them.  One of the
soldiers, Jacob (played by Tim Robbins), is bayonetted in the stomach and
left for dead.  Flash forward several years and Jacob is a postman living in
a surrealistically squalid New York City.  Sights that the audience finds
ugly or even terrifying seem commonplace in Jacob's everyday existence.  But
things are happening that are not commonplace for Jacob.  Something is
stalking Jacob, or perhaps someone who can call up faceless demons.  And, as
if that were not enough, the world seems to be deteriorating and people are
mutating in some mysterious ways that only Jacob sees.  Jacob is even a
little unstuck in time as images from the past flood on him as if they are
the present.</P>
<P>     This is an unpleasant and uncomfortable horror film to sit through, be
warned.  It improves a great deal on thinking about it afterward.  Just as
is true with many of the individual scenes of this film, so too when the
entire film is over we are tantalizingly unsure of exactly what we have seen
and how it is to be interpreted.  Adrian Lyne, who directed FLASHDANCE,
FATAL ATTRACTION, and 9-1/2 WEEKS, photographed this film in murky, muted
colors, much as FLATLINERS was photographer, but his visual style picks out
the squalid and the disturbing.  Murky colors are an intelligent ploy to get
around audience insistence on color photography but still have mood effects
that one usually can get only with monochrome.  I rated this film a low +1
leaving the theater, but it improves greatly on reflection and at this point
I would rate it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<PRE>                    *****HEAVY SPOILER WARNING****
            *****ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE FILM****</PRE>
<P>     As early as when Jacob is dropped off at the locked subway station, I
started thinking this was a re-working of Ambrose Bierce's "Occurence at Owl
Creek Bridge."  I left the theater assuming that was correct.  However, that
would imply that the entire future is fictional.  But Jacob's entire
knowledge of The Ladder is from the future.  Yet Jacob has already seen the
convulsions that are explained only by The Ladder.  If the convulsions are
real, we must interpret The Ladder as real.  If The Ladder is real then some
of the future is really happening also.  Suddenly the story is less like the
Bierce and much more like CARNVAL OF SOULS, where the soul survives and
assumes it is still alive and the living take it for a living soul.  The
faceless demons could even be a direct borrowing of the carnival dead in
CARNIVAL OF SOULS.  Well, if you're going to borrow, borrow from the best.</P>
