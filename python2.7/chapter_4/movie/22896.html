<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Is there anything worse than a comedy with no laughs?  You bet there is
– a comedy with no laughs and a screeching, self-absorbed lead character
that has an autistic kid and dies of cancer.  Actually, that description
makes it sound kind of interesting.  It's not.  It's Isn't She Great –
the horrible story of actress-turned-best-selling-novelist Jacqueline
Susann.</P>
<P>Susann (played here by Bette Midler, That Old Feeling), a
self-proclaimed `star of stage and screen' found her career sagging as
low as Midler's bust in the mid ‘60s.  The film shows her tossed off of
a game show called `What's My Job?' for ridiculing a dimwitted
co-panelist.  The business has already chewed her up and spit her out,
and the past-her-prime starlet gets by on residual checks.  Her
publicist Irving Mansfield (Nathan Lane, Mouse Hunt) proposes to her,
marries her and, through one of the stranger screen scenes I can
remember, sees a woman enjoying a book in Central Park, which gives him
the idea to prod Susann into writing a novel about the `real'
Hollywood.  The dirtier, the better.</P>
<P>The book, of course, is `The Valley of the Dolls,' which went on to
become the best-selling novel of its time.  Susann went on to write two
other stories, `The Love Machine' and `Once is Not Enough' (the latter
should have been the title of the last Bond film), but the film doesn't
mention either.  Instead, it concentrates on Susann and Mansfield trying
to find a publisher and an audience for her tawdry wares.  They
practically invented the idea of a promotional book tour, hocking the
novel from the trunk of their car as they barnstormed every local
bookstore from Pismal Beach to Walla Walla, Washington.</P>
<P>But Susann is more than a groundbreaking sales entrepreneur.  Her
character is perhaps one of the most annoying of all-time and I can't
recall a less sympathetic lead in the annals of Tinseltown.  She makes
Tom Ripley seem like goddamn Rocky Balboa, and if Susann were a figure
skater, she would have hired someone to whack Nancy Kerrigan in the
knee.  She was a fame addict and actually had the audacity to demand
that God make her more popular.  Truman Capote (portrayed eerily well by
Sam Street) claimed that Susann looked like `a truck driver in drag.'
He later issued an apology…to truck drivers.  Midler is perfect casting,
and so is the limp-wristed Lane.  Even Great's press kit calls their
relationship `unconventional.'</P>
<P>There's some tragedy, too.  Susann and Mansfield have the autistic kid
(this is what happens when a queen and a horse-faced diva try to
populate the earth).  And she gets breast cancer, just as God relented
to her constant yammering about her need for `mass love.'  While the
inclusion of these misfortunes attempt to soften Susann's brash
character, they just don't.  The script could have used some punch-ups,
like the rumors that Susann was a bisexual (and bedded, among others,
Ethel Merman, Coco Chanel and, I think, Mr. Ed).  Incredibly, Susann was
also invited to the party at Roman Polanski's house the night that Chuck
Manson's kids wiped out Sharon Tate, et al. (Tate appeared in the
theatrical version of Dolls, but Susann missed it because of her chemo
treatments.)  Either of these developments would have made the film a
little more interesting.  And it's not like there wasn't enough time,
with Great clocking in under an hour-and-a-half.</P>
<P>Great was directed by Andrew Bergman (Striptease) and the sorry script
was based on Michael Korda's New Yorker magazine article `Wasn't She
Great' (Korda was a Simon and Schuster editor on Susann's second novel)
and adapted by In & Out's Paul Rudnick (a.k.a. Libby Gelman-Waxner).
Midler is awful, Lane seems content to hide behind her wide hips, and
David Hyde Pierce (Frasier) offers further proof that he and Neil
Patrick Harris are actually the same person.</P>
<P>While Susann was probably a bit ahead of her time, Great is a bad comedy
that refuses to end.  The best part was watching the book binded in the
factory.  The second-best part?  When it was over.  The creators of the
film insist that Great is only `loosely based' on Susann's life, which
is comforting.  I feel safer thinking that a person this horrible didn't
exist in the world.</P>
