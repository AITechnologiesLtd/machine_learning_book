<P>The term "disability" is often used to apply to a certain set of people
who have severe impairments of one form or another.  It is, however, a
more common experience than you might think, and it's something that
most people have to deal with, sooner or later.  My disability
experience, if you can call it that, is limited to a few weeks in
midwinter, when my hometown of Austin, Texas is blanketed in mountain
cedar pollen.  Cedar trees grow wild all over the Hill Country north and
west of here, and the prevailing wind blows literally tons of pollen
into the River City every year. "Cedar fever", it's called, and lots of
people get it and feel miserable for weeks. Sneezing, congestion, red
eyes, the works.</P>
<P>Cedar fever is not the same as having a disability, of course, but if it
lasts long enough, you experience a little taste of what it's like for
some people.  Loneliness, sure, and depression, and if you're not well
enough to go to work, you get a degree of alienation and isolation to go
along with it.  </P>
<P>This is Jimmy Stewart's situation in Rear Window.  Stewart is laid up
with a broken leg, he's a risk-taking photographer who got a little too
close to a speeding racecar. You'll hear the phrase "confined to a
wheelchair" in most Rear Window reviews, which is a phrase that makes
real wheelchair users wince; they're not "confined" to their wheelchairs
any more than you're "confined" to your Toyota in rush hour. In
Stewart's case, though, the tired old trope is accurate. He sits in his
wheelchair as though  he were nailed there. (He'd have to navigate three
steps just to get out of his apartment, and I bet the doors to the
kitchen and bedroom are too narrow for his chair, and there probably
wasn't one single curb cut in New York City in 1954.)  He's feeling
isolated and depressed, much as you or I would.  </P>
<P>Anyway, we all know what happens next. (At least anyone who watches The
Simpsons knows what happens next; they did a wonderful satire.)  Stewart
gets bored to tears and starts looking out the window at his neighbors
as they live their lives.  (It's summertime, before air conditioning,
and everyone has their windows open.)  One's a composer, one's a
sculptor, one's a ballerina, one is severely lonely and depressed, and
one is maybe a murderer. Stewart picks up a clue here and a clue there
and concludes that the salesman on the second floor killed his wife, and
drags all of his friends into his obsession.</P>
<P>The plot ought to be familiar to all of you by now, and if you've not
seen it, then I won't spoil it for you, choosing instead to concentrate
on the overall excellence of the acting. For my money, Jimmy Stewart
turns in one of the most impressive acting performances of all time.
There's one scene where he's in his wheelchair, and Grace Kelly is in
his lap. They're kissing, but the script requires him to keep talking
about the murderous neighbor across the way. Stewart does this like it's
the most natural thing in the world, and is perfectly convincing as the
sort of man who could ignore Grace Kelly to concentrate on a pointless,
voyeuristic hobby. That's acting.</P>
<P>Kelly herself is no slouch in the acting department. The script really
doesn't require her to act, just lounge around Stewart's apartment in
those fetching Edith Head costumes and look like a knockout. But act she
does, and her breathy voice gets wrapped around some great lines. She
and Stewart trade dark one-liners back and forth at first, until she
becomes convinced of the neighbor's guilt as well.</P>
<P>The wonderful thing about the acting in this movie is that so much of it
is silent, that so much of it has to be transmitted through body
language and expressions and gestures. We only hear the things Hitchcock
wants us to hear, the rest is drowned out by the music from the
composer's apartment or other sources. All of the actors in the
apartment building across the  street do a wonderful job of letting
Stewart, and us, know exactly what's
going on.</P>
<P>For example, there's a newlywed couple across the way that keep their
blinds down. Every once in awhile, the husband will come out, stand by
the window, get some fresh air, and smoke a cigarette. This will last
three seconds, until his wife notices that she doesn't have all of his
attention. We see this in just one little tiny span of time, and yet his
body language and his expression speak volumes.</P>
<P>The actor from the other building who has the most to do is the
suspected murderer, Raymond Burr. (He looks for all the world the way
Russell Crowe did in The Insider, and has the same amount of bottled-up
rage.) The thing about Burr, throughout his work as Perry Mason, was his
voice, stern and authoritative. Most of the time he's onscreen, though,
we can't hear what he's saying, but he's compelling and good and
wonderfully ambiguous in his actions, which speak louder than even his
booming voice.</P>
<P>Of course, the main reason to see Rear Window isn't the acting, it's the
Hitchcock suspense. Actually, there isn't that much of it, most of the
suspense is concentrated in the last reel. What's there, though, is
first-rate, worthy of the master.</P>
