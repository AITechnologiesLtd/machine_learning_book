<PRE>                                  BLOW OUT
                       A film review by Vince Deehan
                        Copyright 1996 Vince Deehan</PRE>
<P>Written and Directed by Brian De Palma
Cast:  John Travolta, Nancy Allen, John Lithgow, Dennis Franz.</P>
<P>(Warning- review contains a few minor spoilers).</P>
<P>With all the resurgent interest in John Travolta lately, post PULP FICTION, 
it was with great interest that I checked out one of his earlier films which 
has received some praise recently. Quentin Tarantino has said of BLOW OUT that 
it contains one of  Travolta's best ever performances.  </P>
<P>BLOW OUT is a thriller set in Philadelphia where Jack Terry (John Travolta) 
works as a sound effects man on low budget horror movies.  Whilst out one night 
recording the sound of the wind for one of his films, he is witness to a car 
crashing through a bridge and into the river below.  Jack jumps into the river 
where he saves a young lady in the car from certain drowning. He is unable to 
save the man in the car who has already died.  It turns out that the dead man 
is a governor and a presidential candidate and the young lady is a girl he has 
picked up, Sally (Nancy Allen).  The tyres of the car have been blown out and 
the whole accident is presented to the public as being an accident. Jack knows 
otherwise as he has taped the whole incident on audiotape and can distinctly 
hear two bangs, one of which he feels sure is the gunshot of an assassin and 
the other bang being the fatal tyre blowout.</P>
<P>The stage is set for a fight by Jack to prove that there has been a cover up, 
where the authorities are covering up an assassination.  A photographer , 
Manny (Dennis Franz), who just happened to be at the scene of the time,  has 
also taken a roll of pictures of the accident.  When Manny sells his pictures 
to a magazine, Jack uses his film skills to link his sound to Manny's still 
photos.  When the two are put together Jack has both visual and audio evidence 
of the gunshot.  Armed with this evidence he goes to the police who at first 
seem uninterested but eventually agree to see what Jack has got. Unfortunately, 
the assassin Burke (John Lithgow) wipes the tapes clean before the police can 
see and hear Jack's evidence.  As the film progresses we discover the real 
reason why Manny was so fortuitously present at the accident and the real 
reason why Sally was in the governor's car.  </P>
<P>BLOW OUT is a taut thriller with some great moments of humour.  A running gag 
throughout the film shows the trouble that Jack's boss has in trying to find 
a good screamer to use in dubbing one of his horror flicks.  The film has dated 
quite badly though, with some rather dodgy and jarring music which gives the 
film a rather hammy feel in places that I feel sure was not intentional.  The 
dialogue is not too great either but is adequate enough. I guess I am so used 
to hearing John Travolta spouting Tarantino's snappy dialogue in PULP FICTION 
that anything else pales in comparison. </P>
<P>John Lithgow turns in a gripping performance as the assassin ,which is very 
effective and chilling.  Dennis Franz, currently in NYPD Blue, is great as the 
slimy photographer Manny. Although it has to be said that Franz really hasn't 
changed very much in the proceeding 15 years, except he had more hair then !  
Nancy Allen's performance improves as the film  goes on, but is pretty woeful 
at the start where she fails to match Travolta's convincing acting.  </P>
<P>John Travolta turns in a great performance, his charisma carries the whole 
film - so what else is new ?  His early scenes where we see him working as a 
sound effects man are terrific. Mainly because there is so much humour when we 
see him and his boss having trouble with the scream track on their horror 
film.  As the film goes on and the pressure on Jack  intensifies, Travolta 
effectively conveys the tension and stress he is under.  The best scene though 
in the film is the scene near the beginning where we see Jack on a bridge in 
the late evening recording the sounds around him.  There is hardly any dialogue 
at all in this scene, but the way John Travolta moves around with the 
microphone you never doubt his believability as a sound recordist. </P>
<P>All in all, BLOW OUT is an effective thriller which, although not essential 
viewing, is well worth a look if you get the chance. </P>
