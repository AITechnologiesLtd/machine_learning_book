<P>Lest their be any question of whether or not the Mouse House still packs
any animated clout, consider this to be the convincing argument
otherwise. </P>
<P>With a eerie feeling of déjà vu and a virtual replay of events earlier
this year, Disney's computer-animated movie about insects, A BUG'S LIFE,
not only beat out the competition (DreamWorks' ANTZ), but did so by a
good measure. Although there may have been doubt as to which of the
"double-vision" asteroid pics would succeed (DreamWorks' DEEP IMPACT
versus Disney's ARMAGEDDON), there was no question when DreamWorks chose
to challenge Disney on its own turf. The animation in A BUG'S LIFE is of
the finest quality, superb in design and free of the flaws that plagued
DreamWorks' picture. The graphic end of the movie -- a bright palette of
pastel hues -- runs smoothly and to great effect. </P>
<P>Unlike ANTZ, which was a story of internal strife in an ant colony, A
BUG'S LIFE returns to Æsopian ground and gives us a tale of ants against
grasshoppers. Strictly speaking, both the script and the voice talent in
A BUG'S LIFE is not nearly as developed as that of ANTZ (the latter
being written with more thought and intelligence), but the simplicity of
A BUG'S LIFE is the key to its success. The movie is a departure from
the serious fare of the competition's animation studios, and, in true
Disney fashion, is plea to the viewer's inner child. Characters are
drawn with an attitude of innocence, and bad guys are sulking, sneering
characters. It's the typical Disney formula, and as far as many are
concerned, that formula's still tops. </P>
<P>The story centers around the life of an ant named Flik (Dave Foley, TV's
"News Radio"), whose curious tendancies land his colony in trouble when
he unknowingly ruins the year's harvest. Flik's colony gathers food for
a gang of grasshoppers, but when Flik sends the offering into the drink,
the lead grasshopper, Hopper (Kevin Spacey), delivers an ultimatum. The
ants must gather a replacement harvest by autumn, or Hopper and his gang
will destroy the colony. Flik decides to make amends by gathering a
group of warrior bugs to fight the grasshoppers, and to keep him out of
the way, the colony's Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus, TV's
"Seinfeld") gives him approval. So Flik heads to the "city" and returns
with a troupe of circus bugs whom he believes to be great warriors, just
in time for he first day of autumn. </P>
<P>The script is peppered with witticisms to keep the older crowd
interested, and there's plenty of slapstick comedy for the younger ones.
At an hour and forty minutes, however, the movie runs a bit longer than
necessary; kids may grow restless nearing the end. Fortunately, the
competition over the holiday weekend isn't much better: BABE: PIG IN THE
CITY and THE RUGRATS MOVIE are both over ninety minutes in length. For
family entertainment, it doesn't get much better than this, and the
Academy may just think so as well -- there's something here for
everyone.</P>
