<PRE>                                THE CELL
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     And I thought I'd seen some twisted movies.  Get ready for the real
psych-out of the year, the long-awaited Jennifer Lopez vehicle The Cell,
the most daring production to come out of Hollywood since Fight Club.</P>
<P>     Note however that daring does not necessarily mean good.  While The
Cell is a deeply disturbing picture, it doesn't always impress.  And
though I am fine with digitally vivisectioning a horse into ten
quivering pieces for dramatic effect, I'm not sure I needed to see
Vincent D'Onofrio poking a hole in Vince Vaughn's stomach in order to
pick out some intestine to spiral around a rotisserie.  (No, really.)</P>
<P>     The Cell is a hodgepodge of The Silence of the Lambs and
Dreamscape, with bits of Psycho and Kiss the Girls thrown in for
effect.  The film opens by introducing us to Catherine (Lopez), an
ex-social worker now employed by an experimental medical company that
can connect two minds together via a funky machine.  In practice, this
is being used by Catherine to try to heal a young kid now in a coma. 
But kid-in-coma does not a thriller make, so to spice things up,
Catherine is given the chance to enter the mind of the also-comatose
Carl Stargher (D'Onofrio), a serial killer who secrets his victims away
in a glass cell for 40 hours, until the cell fills with water and they
drown.  (The convolution gets more forced than that, but I'll spare
you.)</P>
<P>     Vaughn plays FBI agent Peter Novak, who rushes Stargher to
Catherine's offices so she can jump into his brain to locate the
well-hidden glass cell where Stargher's final victim is still awaiting
her watery doom.  Through an increasingly bizarre turn of events, Novak
hops in as well.  Considerable mucking around ensues.</P>
<P>     The Cell owes its freakiness not just to some whacked subject
matter, but also to a truly bizarre use of photographic tricks. 
Slow-motion, fast-motion, upside-down, sideways, underwater,
hallucination-inducing graphics -- you name it, The Cell has it -- and
it often combines them for an even bigger effect.  Add in a
demonic-looking D'Onofrio and Lopez's even stranger wardrobe and you've
got the makings for a movie that's going to give plenty of pre-teens
nightmares when they catch it late at night on HBO.</P>
<P>     The Cell is certainly not for all tastes.  In fact, it may not be
for any tastes.  Pure freak fans will likely be happy, but real
moviegoers will probably be disappointed.  For example, while the story
is twisted enough to make any closet Lynchian giddy, there are enough
stupid holes in it to make the entire go-inside-his-mind plot
irrelevant.  In the end, Carl's brain dump doesn't provide the clues to
the cell's whereabouts, the answer is sitting right there in his
real-world basement.</P>
<P>     With its ultra-hip sensibility, cool threads, and post-modern
thematics ("the cell" as metaphor for the human mind, get it?), The Cell
is clearly a movie to be treasured, hated, and debated by wannabe film
snobs.  But did I actually like it, you ask?  I'm still trying to figure
that one out.  Ask my shrink.</P>
