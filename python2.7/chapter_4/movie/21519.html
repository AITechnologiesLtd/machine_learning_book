<PRE>                            ANYWHERE BUT HERE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     ANYWHERE BUT HERE?  A more apt title you will not find on a motion
picture this decade.</P>
<P>     After a witty lead like that, at this point in the movie review, I
usually launch into a brief plot synopsis.  So here goes: A
down-to-earth teenage girl hates her crazy mother.</P>
<P>     If you're waiting for more, you can stop holding your breath.  In a
nutshell, that's it.  Sure, there are some details (the two move from
Wisconsin to Beverly Hills) – okay, there is *a* detail – but someone
really tried to make a movie out of this *shocking* premise.</P>
<P>     So maybe you think there's something to be salvaged by the two
big-name actresses headlining the picture.  Well, there's Sarandon as
the nutty and irresponsible mom, played in one full dimension and with
Sarandon looking indistinguishable from Leslie Ann Warren.  Or there's
the pouty Portman, in what will go down as the most forgettable role
she's ever played.</P>
<P>     But the worst failing of ANYWHERE BUT HERE is the utter lack of any
sort of plot.  For two hours, we drag through one boring and random
tragedy after another.  The characters never change, the film never
matures.  It's excruciating to watch.</P>
<P>     I mean, what is this movie supposed to be about?  An aging woman's
midlife crisis?  The struggle of a teenager who finds herself playing
parent to the real mother?  Outcasts in Beverly Hills?  All of this has
been done, and occasionally it's been done well.  But ANYWHERE BUT HERE
takes these three movies and runs them straight into the ground.</P>
<P>     ANYWHERE BUT HERE is so bad that if I wasn't a film critic, I would
have left the theater in the first 45 minutes.  But as a professional, I
knew I would have had to see the last half sometime.  The prospect of
that, well, the mind reels, the stomach turns, and the ass revolts.</P>
