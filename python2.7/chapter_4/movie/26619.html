WYATT EARP
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>In the early 1990s western fans saw one of the many revivals
of their favourite genre. However, this time it happened
during the zenith of "political correctness" in Hollywood,
so the entire idea of "western renaissance" was associated
with the need to paint Old West in colours more suitable for
modern political sensibilities. Former heroes who had
brought the civilisation and American of life to the
Frontier were suddenly transformed into wife beaters,
homicidal psychopaths and fascist thugs responsible for the
genocide of Native Americans and the rape of virgin natural
environment. In the climate when the old myths got replaced
with new ones, even the real life legends of the Old West
had to go through revisionist makeover. That included Wyatt
Earp, lawman whose life had inspired numerous Hollywood
films through the decades, mostly centred on his role in the
gunfight at O.K. Corral. In 1993/1994 Hollywood brought two
new versions of that story. While the first, George P.
Cosmatos' TOMBSTONE, remained loyal to the past conventions
of the genre, WYATT EARP, written and directed by Lawrence
Kasdan, was more ambitious effort.</P>
<P>In this film Kasdan tries to fill the blank left by almost
every other filmmaker who had dealt with Earp - his life
prior to the fateful events in Tombstone. So, in this film
we follow how Wyatt Earp (played by Kevin Costner) grew up
to become the law enforcement legend of the Old West. In the
first scenes we are introduced to his family, led by
patriarchal figure of Nicholas Earp (played by Gene
Hackman), lawyer who wants Wyatt to follow his footsteps and
make career as respected citizen. At first, Wyatt follows
his footsteps, but the tragic death of first wife Urilla
(played by Anabeth Gish) would lead him to alcoholism,
gambling, and other form of anti-social behaviour. After he
barely avoided hanging for the horse theft in Arkansas Wyatt
decides to sober up and seeks new life in the West. There he
would switch many careers until his efficiency of the law
enforcer in the rowdy Middle West cattle towns earns him
reputation of the legend. That reputation would become very
useful when he retires and goes to Tombstone, Arizona in
order to seek fortune together with their brothers. In the
ensuing conflict with rival clans of Clantons his friendship
with terminally ill gambler and gunslinger Doc Holliday
(played by Dennis Quaid) would be equally useful.</P>
<P>Kasdan probably thought that the epic scope is the way to
make his treatment of Wyatt Earp different from other films.
He provides that epic scope by widespread use of James
Newton Howard's music and panoramic shots, but the most
"epic" thing about WYATT EARP is its three-hour length. In
other circumstances, those 189 minutes would bring texture
to the story and character, but this time the long run only
reveals the weakness in the script. Kasdan, one of
Hollywood's most talented screenwriters, seems overwhelmed
with the ambitious task to give more modern, historically
accurate and less flattering picture of Wyatt Earp while
remaining loyal to the myth in the same time. So, in the
first hour or so, the film meanders into banal and not very
significant episodes concerning Wyatt Earp's early life -
relations with his family and opposite sex or early career
choices, When we get to the point that should be the most
interesting- gunfight at the O.K. Corral - Kasdan rushes the
pace of the film to the predictable conclusion, without
bothering to explain the background of the said event and
thus leaving audience unsatisfied.</P>
<P>The length of the film could be explained by the influence
of Kevin Costner, Kasdan's long time associate. Costner, who
became star by playing another American law enforcement
legend in THE UNTOUCHABLES, probably tried to stay on the
screen as long as possible, so perhaps this is the reason
why WYATT EARP has many scenes that should have been cut.
Costner, however, delivers the goods and his portrayal of
Earp is commendable, but unfortunately, it can't compensate
contradictions in the story and characterisation.
Furthermore, although WYATT EARP has the truly stellar cast,
none of Costner's colleagues, with the possible exception of
Hackman in rather routine role of his father, has room for
more than couple of lines. The most tragic thing happened
with Dennis Quaid, who allowed himself to lose 20 kilograms
of his weight only to accurately portray terminally ill Doc
Holliday. That should have been truly marvellous role, but
Kasdan didn't use its potential, so Quaid's performance
looks inferior to Kilmer's portrayal of the same character
in TOMBSTONE. Actually, any kind of comparison between two
films is very unflattering to Kasdan's effort - while
TOMBSTONE looks like standard Hollywood entertainment that
delivers the goods, WYATT EARP is pseudo-"artsy" epic that
sinks under the weight of its authors' ambitions.</P>
