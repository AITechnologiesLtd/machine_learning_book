<P>It's unclear what I can possibly add to what's already been said -- and
said better -- about this film.  While "The Third Man" doesn't have the
single line "one and only" review from Pauline Kael attached to it, it
certainly is up there among the acknowledged masterworks from the
1940s, and it has certainly been commented on.</P>
<P>Since it's now the 1990s, Film Forum is presenting "The Third Man" for
a 50th Anniversary run (<A HREF="http://www.filmforum.com/3rdman.html">http://www.filmforum.com/3rdman.html</A>).  This is
the somewhat longer British version.  The difference is about eleven
minutes and an introductory voice-over from the director.  I've seen
this film -- the American version -- once before but it was a long time
ago, when I was at Berkeley.  If I remember correctly, it was shown as
part of a not particularly interesting class on existentialism (such
classes are sometimes there for those who aren't sure of what they're
in school for, I think) (we also saw "Hiroshima, Mon Amour" and "Woman
of the Dunes").  I was probably in the process of dropping out of
graduate school at the time, and my recollection of the film is
somewhat fuzzy, more a remembrance of certain images, bits of plot and
Orson Welles's celebrated entrance than anything else.  I can't tell
you where the differences between versions are.</P>
<P>Briefly, the plot involves a naive American writer arriving in postwar
Vienna to see an old friend.  Upon arriving, he finds that his friend
is dead: he was hit by a car while crossing the street a few days
before.  Because parts of the story don't add up -- initially, he
simply doesn't believe the police when they say his old friend ran in
vicious circles; later, he learns that there was a mysterious third man
at the accident site -- he begins investigating the circumstances of
the death.  He becomes entangled in the Viennese underworld as he digs
deeper, and is attracted to his friend's girlfriend, Anna.</P>
<P>The film winds through like a long nightmare, complete with absurd
incidents and the incongruous zither music.  This is how it should be;
the plot, after all, has the familiar nightmare of arriving someplace
and finding the world upside down.  The film's dreamscape is a ruined
Vienna, the skyline with the spiral of the Stephansdom visible but
pockmarked (<A HREF="http://info.wien.at/e/mus/mus02081.htm">http://info.wien.at/e/mus/mus02081.htm</A>), piles of rubble
everywhere, skeletons of buildings appearing all too frequently,
prominent inhabitants who don't quite achieve normalcy, and bystanders
who watch and stare.  And this is merely daylight, above ground
Vienna.  We also see a nighttime Vienna of long, Expressionist shadows,
surreal chases, weirdly lit sewers, and Orson Welles's entrance
underneath an accidental shaft of light.  All these things in the film
are tuned perfectly.</P>
<P>This world of "The Third Man" is a surreal one of arbitrary forces --
the confused authority of the governing Allied Armies is the most
visible example -- where moral choices are made in an ethical vacuum.
Much is gray, from the evil Harry Lime showing a light side in helping
Anna, to the crusader Calloway using others as tools for emotional
manipulation.  This ambiguous morality is solely created by one's
self.  And I suppose this is why the film was shown with that
Existentialism class.</P>
