<PRE>SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Do you remember back in grade school when one of the kids on the
playground would say some mildly off-color phrase, and you and your
buddies would erupt into nervous giggles?</P>
<P>Well, writers Trey Parker and Matt Stone do, and, in the animated film
SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT, they move their foul-mouthed grade
school kids from their television series to the big screen, where they
get to lose their few remaining inhibitions.</P>
<P>Imagine visiting a grade school in which the kids compete for the
maximum number of obscenities per minute.  One in which the insults know
no bounds.  Mothers are universally referred to with the B-word, and
teachers are cussed out to the delight of the entire class.  There are
undoubtedly people who find this brand of humor extremely funny rather
than merely crude.  My audience was a mixture of laughers and starers.</P>
<P>The story concerns four boys who see an R-rated animated movie, ASSES OF
FIRE.  After watching the movie, one kid joins the Klan, but most just
switch to a new profanity-laced dialect of the English language.  "The
animation is all crappy," one of the boys complains in a bit of
self-deprecating humor.  Any first year art student could draw the
characters in SOUTH PARK.  The pictures have such little life that they
are effectively a series of slightly moving tableaux.</P>
<P>Some bits of humor start off well enough before they go off the deep
end.  One kid is killed when the doctors implant a baked potato instead
of a heart in his chest.  When he goes to heaven, it turns out to be
populated by naked Playboy models.  But the kid doesn't obtain
admission.  Punching the entry button to the Pearly Gates produces an
"Access Denied" error message.</P>
<P>This scene goes down hill once the youngster gets to hell, which is
populated by likely and unlikely figures (Hitler as well as Gandhi).
Saddam Hussein is there having gay sex with the devil.</P>
<P>Some of the political humor is quite funny, the best being a V-chip that
is implanted into one kid's skull.  Every bad word produces a painful
jolt.  And what do you say when you experience sudden pain?  You cuss,
of course, which only prolongs the agony.</P>
<P>Speaking of prolonging things, the movie would have worked much better
as a short film.  A quarter of an hour would have been plenty of time
with these tart-tongued tiny tots.</P>
<P>SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT runs 1:20.  It is rated R for
pervasive vulgar language and crude sexual humor and for some violent
images.  It would be fine for teenagers.  Do not make the mistake of
taking kids under 13.  A woman in my audience did, and you could see her
grimacing.</P>
