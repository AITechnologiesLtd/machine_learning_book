<PRE>Let's see, where were we?</PRE>
<P> Oh, yes. We're in Hollywood, on the set of "Stab 3," an another sequel
in the saga of the Woodsboro murders.</P>
<P> Before that, though, we are on a Los Angeles freeway where a boyhood
friend of slasher victim Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) gets a strange
phone call.</P>
<P> Rushing home he enters his apartment and ...</P>
<P> Welcome to Wes Craven's "Scream 3." And like the first two movies in
the series, this one is mixes an awareness of the slasher movie genre
with audience expectations. But by now the formula is a bit stale, so
the audience is - if not ahead - at least able to keep pace with Craven
and screenwriter Ehren Kruger.</P>
<P> OK, so back to the lot of Sunrise Pictures, where a replica of Sidney's
house stands on a closed set and a cast of two-dimensional types sit
around complaining about the script and their parts.</P>
<P> Of course, now the cast members begin to get bumped off so ...</P>
<P> Enter the famous newswoman Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette, as she
now bills herself)  to get the scoop. And who better, since she was a
player in alll the previous action and even wrote a book about it.</P>
<P> Also on hand is Dewey (David Arquette), the film's technical adviser
and Gale's former boyfriend, who still carries a torch.</P>
<P>        Ain't love grand. What better to reunite two former lovers than a good
serial killing spree.</P>
<P>        As for Sidney, she is holed up somewhere with enough security locks to
keep out the CIA. But the ghost-masked killer learns where she is, so
she flees her isolation, heads for L.A., hooks up with Gale and Dewey
and we're off to the races.</P>
<P>        At about 1 hour and 50 minutes, "Scream 3" drags. There is too much
exposition, the pace is uneven and the rationalization for everything
two complex. There are too many characters, too many red herrings and
the finale is a disappointment.</P>
<P>        But what the heck. The movie will make money because those who were
fascinated by "Scream" and "Scream 2" won't be able to resist this
outing.</P>
<P>        Craven offers some good scary moments and a few goosebumps, but it
seems so formulated, so rote. It lacks a freshness. The movie has a deja
vu, haven't we been here before, feel.</P>
<P>        The cast just goes through its motions, no one stands out and no one
does anything special. "Scream 3" is just more of the same old, same old</P>
<P>        Even cameos by Roger Corman, Carrie Fisher and Kevin Smith as Silent
Bob and Jason Mewes as his motor-mouthed pal from "Dogma" cannot enliven
the plodding proceedings.</P>
<P> It is time to retire this worn out series. Come on, Wes. Put the knives
and ghost masks away and keep them locked up. Move on. "Scream 3" is
like the party guest who stayed too long and wore out his welcome.</P>
