Face-Off Í John Woo Wows!</PRE>
<P>For weeks I have prayed to the movie Gods for a film that would give me a   
sustained adrenaline rush, would have really strong characters, and would   
give me something to remember this summer by.  Finally, my prayers have   
been answered.  Face-Off is my deliverance from the normal humdrum summer   
action fare.  Directed by the stylistically supreme John Woo, he gives us   
something to relieve us from the summer heat´a really cool movie.</P>
<P>For 6 years, FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) has been on the trail   
of psychotic killer Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage).  And,  he gets his   
chance to catch him very early on in the film.  Quickly,  we are treated   
to a visceral offering of gunplay, violence, and terrific action as   
Archer finally gets his man.  This kind of action would be the finale for   
most movies.  But, here, it is just the start of what's to come.  Troy is   
captured -- and left in a coma -- but Archer soon discovers that Troy has   
left a giant time bomb where it will kill everyone within one square   
mile.  Archer must discover the whereabouts before it blows.  But the   
only other person who would know is Troy's brother, Pollux, who was also   
captured in the initial gunfight.  But how can they get Pollux to reveal   
the location of the bomb?</P>
<P>When the Bureau's high-tech medical division informs him of new surgery   
techniques, Archer conceives a plan. He'll allow the physicians to give   
him Troy's face -- literally -- and he'll assume Troy's cruel but   
charismatic personality. They'll also surgically implant a microchip to   
alter his voice to be just like Troy's.  Then he'll go into a   
maximum-security prison and trick Pollux into mentioning where the bomb   
is ticking.  So far so good.</P>
<P>However, Troy awakens from his coma.  He's not quite feeling himself   
anymore, so with the help of some of his goons, he forces the physicians   
to put Archer's face on his skull. The identity swap is now complete   
(Troy is now Travolta and Archer is now Cage).  Troy/Travolta then kills   
everyone who knew of this project and burns down the facility.  He then   
uses his new identity to get into Archer's house -- and next to the   
agent's unsuspecting wife (Joan Allen) and extremely pretty daughter   
(Dominique Swain), while Archer-as-Cage is now stuck in a   
maximum-security prison Í alone and enraged that he has the face of his   
most hated enemy, and fearful for the safety of his family.  Archer/Cage   
must escape and must face off with Troy one last time.</P>
<P>Well-scripted and well-choreographed, this is an operatic and intensely   
violent fable about two men who pursue each other through hell and back.   
Cage and Travolta display genuine gusto for their roles (both when each   
one is bad and good) and despite the switch in identities, we are always   
in step with their characters.  When we see Cage or Travolta walk in, the   
audience knows who they really are.  The arrogant and flamboyant   
Troy/Travolta endures a quiet, domestic, suburban life and a subdued   
Archer/Cage makes his way into the kinetic frenzy of the underworld   
marked by drugs and fast women.  And although they find poignant lessons   
in their new surroundings (Troy trying to teach Archer's daughter how to   
defend herself or Archer learning about loyalty from the goon set), their   
hatred for each other consumes them.  Troy/Travolta definitely has the   
upper hand because he now has the resources of the FBI.  Archer/Cage is   
now wanted dead or alive.  And, even if he survives, will he ever regain   
the family that was taken away because no one knows who Archer-as-Cage   
really is?  A spectacular final confrontation is inevitable and we are   
not disappointed with the finale.</P>
<P>In the world of Woo, movie-watching is a whole new experience.  There is   
a delirious mixture of spectacular gun battles, furious explosions and   
breathtaking stunt work.  Gun battles and terrorist attacks are staged   
like ballets, bullets spray across every inch of the screen and even the   
most mundane scenes are brought to life as captured in poetic slow   
motion.  Cage languished in Con Air, but here he sizzles.  And Travolta   
infuses energy and hipness.  This hot summer, treat yourself to something   
refreshing and something cool.  This is one not to miss.</P>
