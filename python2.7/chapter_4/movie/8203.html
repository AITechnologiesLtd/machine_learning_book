<PRE>THE PALLBEARER
 A film review by Timothy Voon
Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: David Schwimmer, Gwyneth Paltrow, Michael Rapaport, Barbara
Hershey, Toni Collette, Michael Vartan, Bitty Schram, Carol Kane
Director: Matt Reeves Producers: Jeffrey Abrams and Paul Webster
Screenplay: Jason Katims and Matt Reeves</P>
<P>The phone rings. You pick it up. There's someone crying on the other
end. Someone has died. Who is this person?  It's the dead man's mother.
She wants you to make a eulogy at his funeral. The truth of the matter
is that you can't remember him.</P>
<P>At this point I would have replied: ‘Ma'am, it's a real honour to be
asked to say some loving words in memory of your son, but I would think
it inappropriate because I don't remember him.'</P>
<P>Being truthful, yet remaining sensitive, would have been the most
tactful approach to this situation. But being alone (Schwimmer).
Twenty-five years of age. Unemployed, and still living with mother, can
do strange things to a man. Namely, agreeing to make a eulogy for
someone that you don't remember from chess club at high school, then
sleeping with the dead man's mother.</P>
