<PRE>.                             THE THIN RED LINE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<PRE>     War is hell.  I think.</PRE>
<P>     Terrence Malick's long-awaited and severely overhyped LINE is
plenty red, but it isn't thin at all.  In fact, it's damn thick and
dense, and it meanders about like a lazy river.</P>
<P>     At almost three hours, THE THIN RED LINE burns long and slow, and
fully a third of the movie is completely wasted on surrealistic, bizarre
voice-overs that do little but confuse what is an otherwise running
theme in the film: War blows.</P>
<P>     But Malick is a hermitic auteur, and as such, he must be allowed to
do as he pleases.  So, for example, instead of seeing the film-and the
war-only through the eyes of its central character, Jack Witt
(Cavaziel), we are treated to behind-the-brain looks at a half-dozen
other characters, too.  And they all pretty much agree that WWII is a
real pisser, for some reason or another.</P>
<P>     Not that LINE is without its strengths, the middle third is a juicy
look at the horrors of the war in the Pacific and the power plays of
military officers.  But, sadly, much of LINE is a simple vanity project,
not just for Malick but also for the dozens of name-brand stars
involved.  Witness John Travolta and George Clooney in blatant
I-flew-in-for-the-afternoon one-scene appearances.  Such star quality
and behind-the-scenes hype will do a lot to woo critics and Oscar
voters... at the expense of truly good filmmaking.</P>
<P>     The movie's camerawork and performances by Cavaziel, Chaplin, Penn,
Koteas, and Cusack should not be overlooked, and Nolte's put-upon Lt.
Colonel is a memorable piece of work.  But as for the silly metaphysical
script that invents more English language constructs than it adheres
to... well, let's just say that the importance of a good story editor
can't be stressed heavily enough.</P>
