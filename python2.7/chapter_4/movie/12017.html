<P>    Only connect!...Only connect the prose and the passion
and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its
height."  Did Henry Jaglom say this, or are we experiencing
deja vu while we watch his latest offbeat--though accessible--
film about the nature of romance and love?  Utilizing his wife
Victoria Foyt in the principal role, Jaglom has fashioned a film
with mystical undertones as a meditation on some heavy
themes: destiny vs. free will, compromise vs. burning bridges,
the pull of history vs. the allures of the present.  If he doesn't
quite succeed in realizing his ambition it is only because he is
tackling exalted subjects, but "Deja Vu" features some solid if
sometimes pretentious dialogue, intense performances, and
some lush scenery from the majesty of Jerusalem to the
beauty of Paris; from the richness of the white cliffs of Dover
to the coziness of a London cottage.</P>
<P>   The story opens as a store owner from Los Angeles, Dana
(Victoria Foyt), is shopping for garments in Jerusalem for sale
in her business.  An elderly, enigmatic French woman (Akiva
Marks) sits beside her in a scenic cafe and, opening up the
way strangers often do to reveal secrets unknown even by
their most intimate friends, she describes a liaison she had
decades earlier with an American lover who gave her a ruby
pin, left for home with a promise to send for her, and simply
disappeared.  </P>
<P>   There ensues a progression of incidents that take Dana to
Paris, to Dover's white cliffs, to London and ultimately home
to Los Angeles, but before meeting her fiance, Alex (Michael
Brandon) in London, she has a fateful meeting in Dover with
Sean (Stephen Dillane) whom she observes painting a pretty
scene and finds herself not only attracted to the urbane fellow
but having the strangest feeling that they'd met before.  By a
remarkable coincidence, business draws both Dana and Sean
to a London home where they are hosted by a comical pair
with their own stories to tell, and are entertained by the host's
sister, Skelly (Vanessa Redgrave).  Skelly is a woman of the
world who believes in taking life by the horns and refusing to
compromise even if one must give up security in favor of a
brash romance.</P>
<P>   While Jaglom's latest effort is more structured than his
autobiographical films such as "Can She Bake A Cherry Pie"
(which furthered Karen Black's acting career) and "New
Year's Day" which featured the director himself in a starring
role, he continues to compete with the French penchant for
talk.  As with his most recent offering, "Last Summer in the
Hamptons," which focused on a group of theater people
talking up a storm to reveal all their neuroses, Jaglom seats
his characters in the central scene around a living room
where they tell campfire-like stories about their lives, one of
which hits home so thunderously that Dana and her secret
paramour Alex seem ready to crawl under a table.</P>
<P>   The fable relies all too much on unbelievable coincidences
to demonstrate that we poor mortals are often blown hither
and thither by fate, our decisions made for us by some all-
knowing entity which can disrupt our most solid plans and
sweep us away to romantic bliss.  There is little doubt that the
pathetic philistine Alex is no competition for the dashing Sean
(Stephen Dillane) whose English manners, aesthetic sense,
and savoir faire wholly outmatch the boorish materialism of
Dana's fiance.  Dillane takes high honors for his finely-honed
acting while Vanessa Redgrave is surprisingly underutilized
and cast in a stereotypical role of a woman who is simply a
type.  Vanessa Redgrave's own mother has a banal cameo
as an aging parent who is not wanted by either of her
children, while Victoria Foyt is well cast as a sophisticated
career woman overwhelmed by destiny.</P>
<P>   Few movies have put a single song to such use, giving the
audience a feeling of instant deja vu, as the refrains of "White
Cliffs of Dover" is repeated interminably to illuminate the
movie's title:  "It seems we've stood and talked like this
before/ We looked at each other in the same way then/ But I
can't remember Where Or When." Not Rated.  Running time:
115 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
