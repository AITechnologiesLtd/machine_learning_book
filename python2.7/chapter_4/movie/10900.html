<P>    Ian Holm (THE FIFTH ELEMENT, BIG NIGHT) stars in this quiet, quirky
Canadian drama about a remote British Columbia community, a school bus
accident that kills a chunk of their children, and the ready-to-sue
ambulance-chaser (Holm) who arrives in short order.  Writer/director
Atom Egoyan (EXOTICA), adapting from the novel by Russell Banks, con-
trasts the town's collective grief with Holm's character's struggle to
accept the loss of his own child-- a drug-addicted daughter that he
can't keep from loving, no matter how many times she breaks his heart.
Heavy stuff, but Egoyan has a few tricks up his sleeve to keep the po-
tentially wrenching drama at a discretionary distance.  (The non-linear
story structure, with its interwoven flashbacks, in one such device.) 
A remarkably centered performance by Holm is the centerpiece of this
absorbing and, at times, haunting film.  (I was moved, but not to tears.
Then again, I'm not a parent, either.)  Gorgeous winter photography,
too, by Paul Sarossy.  With Sarah Polley, Bruce Greenwood, Tom McCamus,
Gabrielle Rose, Arsinee Khanjian, SPANKING THE MONKEY's Alberta Watson,
and a surprisingly menacing Maury Chaykin.</P>
