<P>   James Bond and Leonardo da Vinci meet Godzilla and Dr.
Strangelove--sort of--in this moderately amusing summer
action comedy which, for all its faltering one-liners displays
quite a bit of pizazz.  The James in the film, however, is a
character known as James T. West (Will Smith), the Godzilla-
like creature is actually the biggest darn arachnid you've ever
seen.  The Bond is in fact the link between West and
Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline), two opposites who learn that
in order to survive the evil scheme of the legless villain, Dr.
Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), they must learn to meld
their distinct talents into an awesome fighting team.</P>
<P>   Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld--whose "Men in Black"
hitched the talented Will Smith to Tommy Lee Jones in a hip
spin on the sci-fi invasion genre--"Wild Wild West" arrays
some of the originality and sharp pacing of the 1997 saga. 
But whereas Ed Solomon's perky screenplay for "Men in
Black" exquisitely adapted Lowell Cunningham's Malibu comic
for the screen, the dialogue here takes a back seat to the
dynamic computer-generated visuals, leaving Smith, Kline,
and Salma Hayak to wow the summer crowds with perpetual
motion in lieu of a great deal of clever repartee.</P>
<P>   After an unpromising start featuring the slimy and scheming
General Bloodbath McGrath (Ted Levine), a hideous creature
with a prosthetic ear who makes the rounds of a post-bellum
bar-cum-whorehouse in West Virginia--Sonnenfeld takes us to
the White House in Washington, where special agents James
T. West and Artemus Gordon are given assignments by
President Ulysses S. Grant.  Gordon is a cerebral fellow who
uses his analytical mind to fashion useful inventions.  He has
invented a bulletproof vest, an array of Bond-like gadgets on
his opulent train known as The Wanderer, and is soon to
experiment with the design of a heavier-than-air flying
machine.  His partner, West, is strictly the physical type: the
sort who would shoot first, shoot second, and then shoot
again before starting to ask questions.  Though at first they
can barely tolerate each other, they learn to combine their
abilities to thwart the wicked Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth
Branagh), a Strangelovian villain determined to avenge
himself against the victorious North against whom he lost
both of his legs in battle.  (Sonnefeld's use of a bevy of
Brunhildes serves to furnish Loveless with a Nazi tenor.) Rita
Escobar (Salma Hayek) provides the sexual tension such as
there is, teaming up with West and Gordon to find her father,
who has been kidnapped by Loveless in a plot to force
President Grant to sign a surrender which would reverse the
outcome of the Civil War.  </P>
<P>   Most of the fun of this pure summer entertainment should
have been in the one-liners thrown out by Smith and Kline as
they snipe at each other while tracking down the smart,
articulate scoundrel.  But a good deal of Will Smith's shtick
runs the gamut from the obvious to the embarrassing, the
latter most prominent in his sick-joke treatment of the
wheelchair-bound Loveless.  "We have a nice half-jail cell
picked out for you," he sneers when he appears to have
caught up with Loveless; and "You know women--they'll cut
the legs right out from under you."  When he is about to be
lynched by a group of southern whites who object to the
man's calling them rednecks, West tries to talk his way out of
the rope by explaining that "redneck" is not a bad word at all:
"Red means passion," he explains, "And neck...well I can't
think of anything for neck," he grouses.  To appease the
band of vindictive Confederates, he continues, "About the
slavery issue--I don't see what's the big deal...I don't blame
you for not wanting to get your own fat asses out of bed and
pick your own cotton."  The bon mots are pretty much on that
level.</P>
<P>   The film's appeal comes mostly from the crafty gadgets
invented by Gordon to foil the enemy, but principally from the
luxurious train the man rides and from the 80-foot mechanical
spider constructed by Dr. Loveless to compensate him
metaphorically for his lost limbs.  West and Gordon must
continually devise schemes to avoid the clutches of the steel
tarantula, with Gordon's keen mind outpacing West's more
physical nature.  When Gordon observes a wasp descending
with extreme prejudice on a black spider in the Utah desert
(actually filmed on a New Mexico ranch), he conceives a
blueprint to foil his nemesis.</P>
<P>   Salma Hayek has virtually nothing to do, performing in one
instance as the literal butt of one visual joke aboard the train,
while Kevin Kline and Will Smith do not come close to
matching the chemistry of Smith's team-up with Tommy Lee
Jones two years back.  Kenneth Branagh, disguised almost
beyond recognition, successfully emulates the New Orleans
accent he practiced since his role in Robert Altman's "The
Gingerbread Man," essentially stealing the show while Elmer
Bernstein's soundtrack pumps away furiously throughout to
compensate for the middling dialogue.</P>
