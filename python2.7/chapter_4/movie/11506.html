<P>I welcome the newness, the fresh look of the King of Kitsch. Quentin
Tarantino's new movie, Jackie Brown, is just that. Bt it's also alot
more. It shows a director maturing. And a mature Quentin is a good thing
indeed.
 Based on the book Rum Punch by Get Shorty author Elmore Leonard, Jackie
Brown revives Pam Grier from a life of blaxplotation retirment, and
Robert Forster, who turns in what may be the film's best performance
(obviously, since it got him that Oscar nomination).
 Grier plays Jackie Brown, an airline stewardess and sometimes money
runner for Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson, who ignites the screen as
always). When ATF agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) and an LAPD officer
pick Jackie up for running money, she begins to get a scheme.
 Robbie goes to get her bonded,and sees bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert
Forster). And soon after, Jackie is double-crossing all who try to stop
her plan from working. Plus, Cherry begins to care for Jackie, and the
expressions on Forster's face as he watches Jackie from afar or even
talk to her is reminiscent of a lonely little boy in elemenatry school,
eager for the popualr girl's attention.
 Also along for the ride in this Tarantino epic is Robert DeNiro,
suprisingly subdued, as Louis Gara, Ordell's cronie from the days of
yesteryear, and Bridget Fonda as Melanie, Ordell's pot-smoking,
sex-obsessed, tan beach bunny.
 One clever scene involves a conversation and a photo between DeNiro and
Fonda. It is perfectly Tarantino. There are many other memorable
moments, like a POV shoot from three different people. All in all,
Quentin Tarantino's latest film is a winner, and makes one salivate for
his next project. (and the play he's in now, Wait Until Dark) What else
would you expect from the Master of Witty Dialogue? One of the best
films of 1997, and definitely one of the very slim films of recent years
that makes you wish that the film would never end.</P>
