<PRE>Cracking India
Earth</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"Earth" tells (in Hindi mixed with English) the story of the 1947
partitioning of India as seen through the eyes of a little girl named Lenny.
Lenny's Nanny, the beautiful Hindu Shanta, hangs with a hip,
religiously-mixed bunch of friends who try fruitlessly to hold their
friendship above their various affiliations as the British pull out after
200 years of rule.</P>
<P>Painting in a yellowish stroke the passion of life, love and death; the film
is accented with romance and courtship amidst tragic religion-based
massacring.</P>
<P>Though this particular dispute between Eastern religious factions occurred
half a century ago on the other side of the planet, it certainly colors an
all too familiar picture. Not short on cute proverbs and parables, the film
itself, teaches the saddest of lessons.</P>
<P>Slightly on the over-dramatic side (acting and camera direction), much of
the spoken English may be difficult to decipher. But, the pace is strong,
images warm and deep, and story powerful.</P>
<P>"Earth" is the second film in director Mehta's trilogy: Fire, Earth and
Water.</P>
<P>Earth. Based on "Cracking India" by Bapsi Sidhwa. Not Rated.
