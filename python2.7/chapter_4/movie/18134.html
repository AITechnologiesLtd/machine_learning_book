<PRE>Review: The Mummy (1999)
Starring Brandan Fraser, Rachel Wiesz, John Hannah
Directed by Stephen Sommers</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by Vince Yim
(May 6, 1999)</PRE>
<P>Based on the Boris Karloff's classic by the same name, The Mummy starts
off with the high-priest of Osiris, Imhotep, who murders the pharoah for
his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying
way possible -- bandaged up, having his tongue removed, and being
covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles, then entombed...all while still
alive.</P>
<P>Recap a few thousand years later, where a soldier named Rick (played by
Brandan Fraser) aids a young historian named Evelyn (played by Rachel
Wiesz) and her brother, Jonathan (played by John Hannah) in finding the
book of Amon Ra, in the process inadvertently freeing the Mummy. 
Problem is that the Mummy wants to revive his mistress, using Evelyn as
a sacrifice...</P>
<P>Walking in with relatively low expectations, I thought this movie was
actually pretty good.  The visuals and CGI are astounding, and obviously
not cheaply done at all.  They pack a ton of detail into the images,
especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by CGI. </P>
<P>The computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes, such as
unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments
where the Mummy goes after the people who freed him (after all, those
who took his artifacts are cursed).  </P>
<P>Unfortunately, the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span
of time, becoming a tug of war for control between genres.  On one hand,
it is a fast paced action film.  On the other, it's a frightening horror
film.  And on the side, it's a hilarious comedy.</P>
<P>Ideally, for it to be successful, the film would have to focus on one
the more action oriented aspect, with one character serving as the comic
relief (that would be Johnson).  The problem with this film is that it
has at least three characters serving as comic relief, with Rick
occasionally delivering his witty one-liner.  If they were trying to
make a horror-action-comedy, it would have helped if it were established
early on in the film, but unfortunately, with the backstory of Imhotep's
entombment, that would be impossible.</P>
<P>And then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding Rick
and an army of mummies.  While really well done, it had the feel of
slapstick comedy.  Replace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd
effectively have Ash fighting zombies in Army of Darkness.  While
entertaining and funny, it feels really out of place.  But at least it's
a break from the naive heroes that Brendan Fraser has been playing a lot
of.  </P>
<P>On the whole, the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end,
entertaining the audience.  But I must end my review with a plea to
movie theatre owners...TURN THE SOUND DOWN!  While a lot of theatres
have good sound systems, my ears were almost ringing as I walked out of
the theatre (the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap
your pants if you're not careful).  When they were showing the trailer
for the upcoming Schwarzenegger film, "End of Days", it was so loud I
couldn't make anything out.</P>
