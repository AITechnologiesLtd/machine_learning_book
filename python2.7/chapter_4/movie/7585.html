<P>     One day, a man sees a woman.  Something about her strikes him as 
familiar and he begins to follow her.  All day, he dogs her steps -- to 
her cafeteria at work, on the bus going home, and finally, along the 
street leading to the prison from which she is set free by day to 
participate in a work release program.  The man, a university professor 
named Alberto Sajevo, returns home.  All evening, he thinks of the 
woman, and the next day he sets out to meet her.  Their eyes lock and 
they have a polite conversation, but something isn't right.  Neither of 
them offers their real name to the other -- they go by assumed 
identities.  There's a dynamic between these two that we don't 
understand -- perhaps they don't, either.  Where are things going?  Why 
is Alberto following her?  And what are his intentions?</P>
<P>     So begins director Mimmo Calopresti's gripping psychological 
thriller, THE SECOND TIME.  I won't say any more about the plot, 
because, beyond the setup, there are layers of Hitchcockian surprises to 
be revealed.  If there's one obvious flaw to the film, it's that the 
running time is a little too short.  The situation is so fascinating and 
the characters are so real that we find ourselves wanting the story to 
keep going. </P>
<P>     THE SECOND TIME isn't just about plot twists and surprises, 
however.  There is a deep psychological underpinning to the proceedings 
which asks questions about the nature of forgiveness and whether issues 
we fight for today will have any meaning for us in ten years' time.  
It's also worth noting that some events, whether intentional or 
unintentional, can bind strangers together forever.  In bringing this 
point to the fore, THE SECOND TIME is not unlike another Philadelphia 
Festival of World Cinema entry, THE EIGHTEENTH.</P>
<P>     THE SECOND TIME is one of those stories where there's no real 
beginning or end.  The characters' lives have been going on for a long 
time before we first meet them, and they'll continue after the end 
credits have rolled.  There are no obligatory flashbacks to show us 
important past events and no epilogue to hint at what the future might 
hold.  The film doesn't have much of a sense of closure, but, when it's 
all over, we feel that we're "up to speed" and have witnessed an 
important event.</P>
<P>     The acting is excellent.  Sajevo is played by the multi-talented 
Nanni Moretti (best known in the United States for his film CARO 
DIARIO).  Valeria Bruni Tedeschi (NENETTE AND BONI) is Lisa Venturi, the 
woman whom Alberto trails.  The scenes between these two are electric, 
and the mix of emotions -- anger, fear, confusion, resentment, hatred, 
and guilt -- is explosive.  Both parts require great range, and the 
performers are up to the challenge.</P>
<P>     Much of the credit for the film's success has to go to co-
writer/director Mimmo Calopresti, who knows exactly where he wants the 
narrative to go, and never loses control of it.  If the pacing of the 
second half is a little uneven, that can be attributed to the escalation 
in tension resulting from confrontations.  The first half, however, is 
perfectly paced.  We are brought into the situation gradually, at first 
mildly intrigued by the characters, then burning with curiosity.  The 
revelation, when it occurs, is a shock, but one that makes sense when 
examined in retrospect.  Few movies today are put together this 
expertly.  Not only does THE SECOND TIME address several important 
issues, but it does so within a framework designed to keep viewers on 
the edge of their seats.</P>
