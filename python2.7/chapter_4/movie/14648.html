<P>Over the past two years, DreamWorks SKG has shown a remarkable ability
to insert themselves into mainstream film production. They've had a hand
in some of the more successful projects of recent memory, including DEEP
IMPACT and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. However, a lot of their films - PRIVATE
RYAN as possibly the only exception - have found themselves lacking in
drive and inspiration. DreamWorks has yet to come up with defining
characteristics as a film studio, and it shows in their latest feature,
ANTZ. Both impressive and plain at the same time, ANTZ was an inventive
movie that was made without gusto. </P>
<P>The impressiveness comes from the computer-generated images involved.
The movie runs ninety minutes in length, and all but forty seconds of
this is entirely dependent on computer imaging. The CGIs are remarkably
well-crafted, and though they only fall apart in select situations (the
brief involvement of a human being), they are a benchmark standard. It
will be interesting to see how later-this-year's A BUG'S LIFE compares
in scope and execution to the flawlessness of the imaging in ANTZ.
Certain aspects of insect life are also flawlessly integrated into the
movie as well, and it almost looks real (such as the entire scene on the
picnic blanket). The insects are given human characteristics and
personalities, but not to the extreme like some of the primitive Disney
animations. Everything in ANTZ is well-designed in the technical
respect. </P>
<P>The cast behind the eye-candy is impressive as well: Woody Allen does he
voice of the lead ant, and is backed by love-interest Sharon Stone, best
friend Sylvester Stallone, nemeses Gene Hackman and Christopher Walken,
unlikely acquaintance Danny Glover, and colony queen Anne Bancroft. Most
of these A-listers lend suitable voice support, and in some instances,
it's more enjoyable to hear them talk without watching them. Stallone,
for example, gives voice to a comic rendition of himself, and the
performance is lively whereas watching Stallone himself would most
likely be a dreary affair. Allen is the best overall, however, and his
neurosis becomes part of his character, the ant named Z. Z questions his
totalitarian society to the point of depression, and Allen reflects this
well. </P>
<P>Eventually, Z meets up with colony princess Bala (Stone), and the two
hit it off until colony guards break the encounter up. Z convinces his
friend Weaver (Stallone) to switch places with him - Z is a worker and
Weaver is a soldier - so he can have access to the royal chamber. The
secret is blown, then, and in a hasty exit, Z grabs Bala and leaves the
anthill. The two make a fantastic journey but return to find that the
evil General Mandible (Hackman) has usurped the colony and is preparing
to kill all of the workers off. It's in the plot that the movie is
bogged down, for it follows a formula of animation so closely that it's
easy to predict what's ahead. Granted, a family movie will not contain a
complex plot, but there are relatively few twists to make watching it
completely worthwhile; the adult humor involved is not enough to pick
things up. For the computer imaging and the cast of voices, however,
it's still worthwhile, and you may find this one to be more than meets
the eye.</P>
