<P>"Looks like he zigged when he should've zagged."
     - Ernie Hudson, as a police officer commenting on a suspicious 
       death.</P>
<P>     Comic book translations are notorious tricky-- anyone up for a 
double-bill of THE PUNISHER and CAPTAIN AMERICA?-- and THE CROW proves 
no exception. Despite a gross of good intentions, Brandon Lee's final 
film doesn't fly very high.</P>
<P>     The story opens on Halloween Eve, better known as Devil's Night. 
Wilmington-as-Detroit is in flames and the police are tending to at 
least *one* murder:  young rock-musician-turned-pavement-artist Eric 
Draven (Lee), found on a sidewalk six-stories below the apartment he 
was thrown from. The cops are also upstairs, administering aid to his 
fiance who was assaulted and raped and not necessarily in that order.  
She dies, the perps. escape, and, exactly one year later, Draven rises 
from the grave to wreak revenge.</P>
<PRE>     Sound familiar?</PRE>
<P>     Unlike Charles Bronson, whose only known superpower involves an 
inability to refrain from filming DEATH WISH sequels, Lee's character 
has supernatural strength and amazing agility and can even reheal from 
gunshot wounds faster than Robert Patrick in TERMINATOR 2. By his side 
is his crow, the presumable source of his powers as related in the 
narration.</P>
<P>     Wearing what appears to be Alice Cooper's leftover make-up, Lee 
is plopped into an underlit urban landscape that was obviously modeled 
after BATMAN and BLADE RUNNER. But no number of red-lit, rain-soaked 
streets can compensate for cheap FX that make THE CROW seem closer to 
DARKMAN than BATMAN.</P>
<P>     (The glaring miniatures should show better on video, though. :)</P>
<P>     A nod to DARKMAN is an insult to Sam Raimi, though, because Alex 
Proyas can't film a decent action scene to save his life.  His two 
"best" set-pieces-- some banzai board-room butchery and a cool church-
roof sword fight-- are also undercut by the awful editing of Dov 
Hoenig and Scott Smith.  Blame said editors for the film's frightful 
flashbacks, as well.  But the pace is quick, thank God, and every 
good-idea-turned-bad is over before it begins.</P>
<P>     The cast is better than it should be. Ernie Hudson is a good 
choice as a friendly policeman and he gets off most of the film's 
funnier lines. Newcomer Rochelle Davis does well as both the narrator 
and Draven's scrappy ward.  Jon Polito has a small, succulent role as 
pungent pawnbroker. And Michael Wincott makes a distinct impression as 
a long-haired Mr.  Big whose collection of ancient-swords makes him 
seem like he walked into the film from the trailer to HIGHLANDER III.</P>
<PRE>     There can be only one.</PRE>
<P>Finally, there's Brandon Lee, son of Bruce Lee, and a 28-year-old 
rising-star who was fatally shot during shooting. Lee had four films 
to his name-- KUNG FU:  THE MOVIE, LASER MISSION, SHOWDOWN IN LITTLE 
TOYKO, and RAPID FIRE-- and THE CROW would've been a nice feather in 
his belt and that's about it.  There's nothing great from him here-- 
just a good performance that owes as much to presence as ability.</P>
<P>     When the echo of that gunshot finally fades, watching THE CROW 
should prove an even *less* remarkable experience. Despite a healthy 
dose of humor and some surprising sincerity, THE CROW is still just a 
couple notches above its straight-to-video brethren. For now, maybe 
it's an appropriate eulogy to an actor who could only get better.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:  THE CROW is another failed comic-book translation that
              just happens to be Brandon Lee's final film.  Maybe THE 
              MASK will wear better.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: C-</PRE>
