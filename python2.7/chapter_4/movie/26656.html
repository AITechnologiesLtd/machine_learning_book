"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Laurent Cantet's Human Resources is an interesting working-class drama
set in a small French town where most of the citizens are employed by
one factory.  Home from a Parisian college, Franck (Jalil Lespert, Sade)
lands a summer internship in the factory's personnel department.  His
father (Jean-Claude Vallod) is proud of his son, but Franck's friends
see him as a sellout.</P>
<P>Franck quickly finds himself in the middle of a battle between
management and the union.  At issue is the implementation of a 35-hour
workweek, an issue vehemently despised by the union but hailed by the
bosses as an end to the factory's financial troubles.  In an attempt to
appease both sides, Franck suggests a referendum be given directly to
the factory's employees, drawing the ire of the union and their
firecracker representative, Danielle Arnoux (Danielle Mélador).</P>
<P>Franck is caught between a rock and a hard place.  He has strong ties to
the blue-collar community (his dad has been a factory employee for 30
years), but at the same time, he wants to please his new bosses, and
even feels a twinge of embarrassment about his working-class roots.
Human Resources is about Franck's internal struggle, which is akin to
Bud Fox's ordeal in Wall Street.</P>
<P>The only professional actor in Resources is Lespert – the rest of the
cast were actual factory workers found in the town Resources used as its
gloomy backdrop (it's the town upon which the sun forgot to shine).  The
film was co-written by Gilles Marchand, who penned the America-bound
French blockbuster, Harry, He's Here to Help.</P>
