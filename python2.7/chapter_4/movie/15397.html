<P>Plot: In a small Montana town Clay's best friend Earl shoots himself 
after he discovers that Clay has been having an affair with his wife 
Amanda and deliberately does so to make it appear that Clay shot him. 
Clay is forced to cover up the suicide by faking an accident. However 
the calculating Amanda still wants Clay and continues to harass him to 
have sex with her. She then shoots a girl Clay goes out with, forcing 
him to dispose of that body in the lake. But then while Clay and his new 
friend Lester Long are fishing on the lake, the body turns up - only 
when Clay reports it to the police, it turns out to be a different body. 
Clay realizes that Lester is really a serial killer who has been 
slaughtering women in the area. But as the FBI arrive to investigate, 
the evidence begins to point to Clay as the killer.</P>
<P>The surprise about this essentially indie production is that it is 
produced by such usually commercially-minded directors as brothers 
Ridley and Tony Scott. The film starts in rather well with a plot filled 
with some deliciously black twists and turns - Sporleder shooting 
himself in order to leave the blame on Phoenix; Cates's blackmailing 
bitcheries and her shock shooting of Allyn during sex; and then a 
marvellously about-face twist as Phoenix and Vaughn drag the body out of 
the lake - only for Phoenix to find it is the wrong body. But after such 
a promising buildup the film somehow thereafter loses it all. The latter 
half of the film falls into something dreadfully predictable - the 
familiar device of the wrong man finding himself framed for the crimes 
and the psycho continuing to toy with him. Despite its desire to achieve 
an indie attitude there is something dreadfully predictable about the 
way the film plays itself out. Indeed the only real surprise it holds in 
store in its latter half is its failure to throw any twists on plot 
denouements one can see coming off way in advance.</P>
<P>What does however hold it together in the second half is its cast. 
Joaquin Phoenix gives an okay central performance, although he is 
essentially typecast in the same role he played in 'To Die For' (1995) - 
that of the not-terribly intellectually endowed smalltown yokel who is 
enwrapped in a murder plot and manipulated by a scheming bitch. Vince 
Vaughn though is the one having all the fun. Vaughn can present 
considerable charms on screen - most notably in 'Swingers' (1996) - and 
the twist here is that Vaughn remains the most charismatic character on 
screen while also playing a complete psychopath. And, although the 
beaming smile and the cowboy pose gets somewhat overplayed, it is fun to 
watch the charm being ployed and working on people. The film also has 
Janeane Garofalo who is, in this author's estimation, one of the most 
intelligent and underrated actresses around at the moment. This gives 
her a part that lifts her free of the typecasting she has acquired of 
late in light romantic comedies ever since her breakthrough in 'The 
Truth About Cats and Dogs' (1996). Her FBI agent holds attention with 
her cool deliberated composure and detached patience. (There is 
considerable play in the film between her FBI training and the town's 
more laidback ways). There is a fabulous encounter between she and 
Vaughn in a bar where she cynically deflates his persistent attempts to 
charm her but then when he turns away to the girl he was waiting to 
meet, we momentarily see her annoyance and get a glimpse of just how 
much she was starting to fall for his line. It's a marvellous piece of 
momentary character insight on director Dobkin's part.</P>
