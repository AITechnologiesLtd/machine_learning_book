<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>I've yet to decide if a movie is good if it makes you cry.  SIMON BIRCH 
gave me at least one all-out belly laugh, during the Christmas pageant, 
and I've thought for some time that a movie is decent if it makes you 
shout in laughter.  But crying?</P>
<P>I did not cry during Forrest Gump's monologue directed at Jenny's grave.  
It was as though the director were lighting up a CRY NOW sign, in the 
same way that television studios light APPLAUSE signs.  The movie did 
not earn our tears, at least in this scene.</P>
<P>SIMON BIRCH made my lip quiver, and I know my daughter was squeezing my 
wife's arm during the scenes that were designed to be gut-wrenching.  
Maybe the answer is here, that if a sequence is "designed" or 
"engineered" to move us, it does not ring true, and therefore does not 
come by our tears honestly.  The taint of artifice.</P>
<P>What's likable about SIMON BIRCH?  It's a buddy movie, two boys who are 
best friends, and it's set in the early 1960s.  So there's an aura of 
nostalgia, a feeling that the action is ensconced in the lost and better 
past.  The main plot hovers about the life of Joe Wentworth (Joseph 
Mazzello), a 12 year-old who does not know who his father is.  For some 
time he has been the butt of jokes and scorn, but his mother has not 
revealed her lover met years ago on the train.  Life-long pal Simon 
Birch (Ian Michael Smith), also 12 but with the eccentricities of 
someone much older, decides he will help Joe find his father.  We are 
also informed of Simon's deep-seated belief that God put him here for a 
purpose, that because of his faith, Simon would cope with his dwarfism 
and overcome people's blindness.  Simon would become a hero.</P>
<P>These two early adolescents quickly endear themselves to the viewer.  
Although their routine is typical - playing baseball, racing to the 
creek for a swim, discussing girls - the script (by Mark Steven Johnson) 
has them perform these growing up tasks with quirky originality.  
Simon's self-deprecating humor is especially charming.  He one-ups Joe 
in physical comparisons, though he goes for the smaller instead of the 
superior.  He accepts playing the Baby Jesus because he is the only 
student who will fit in the crib.  And he rides, perhaps too cutely, in 
a wooden Coca-Cola crate rigged up as a sidecar to Joe's bike.  Though 
their actions and ideas are occasionally unexplainable, both boys craft 
fine performances, causing the audience to feel a range of emotions.</P>
<P>Ashley Judd distinguishes herself as Rebecca Wentworth, Joe's mother.  
Although cast as an ideal - the pretty and caring mom - Judd steps 
around firmly in the role, making it believable.  Part of her importance 
is serving as Simon's surrogate mom, one who cares about the boy - 
unlike his real parents, who permit Simon to live with them but are 
otherwise uninvolved.   Judd's acting might be compared to the product 
of a writer who works hard for transparent prose, or of a dancer who 
works tirelessly for effortless leaps.  It's unfortunate that the story 
calls for Rebecca to appear only in the first half of the film.  </P>
<P>Oliver Platt's role, Ben Goodrich the drama teacher who begins to date 
Rebecca, suffers from acute stereotype.  But Platt manages to make the 
character engaging.  Yes, Joe initially resents him, and Ben tries to 
win the boy over with goofy gifts and behaviors.  But there's a depth 
that Ben's character achieves, especially after Rebecca's character 
departs from the story.  Platt's flat face and nonchalance connects him 
with both Joe and Simon, another surrogate, but the audience is also in 
on the connection.</P>
<P>Like Platt, David Strathairn is a reliable character actor, but the 
script does not fully develop his Reverend Russell.  What we get is a 
lightweight Dimmesdale from The Scarlet Letter, a stiff and rather 
cowardly man whose presence is overshadowed by any character appearing 
with him.  Other supporting roles are well-cast, including Jan Hooks, 
almost unrecognizable, as Miss Leavy, a nasty Sunday school teacher, and 
Jim Carrey as the adult Joe Wentworth, whom we see in the framing tale 
at start and end.</P>
<P>Director Mark Steven Johnson's main accomplishment is the friendship 
among the main characters;  these relationships make us care about them.  
A secondary success is the comfortable mood set up by the beautiful 
camera work, especially in scenes that perfectly evoke fall and winter.  
September was a great month in which to release this film:  the leaves 
and fast-running water throughout the story both add to the imagery and 
cause the climax to reverberate all the more.</P>
<P>If I were to rank SIMON BIRCH by percentile, it would place in the 80's 
- perhaps a "B" picture, but one that is considerably more than half 
successful.  As far as causing tears, I mostly agree with a writing 
teacher who said a good story is one that makes you laugh or cry.  SIMON 
BIRCH affected my family and me, and I'll carry some of its images in my 
mental storehouse of favorites.  Because it meets these criteria, and 
because I cared about its characters, SIMON BIRCH is a good film to me.</P>
