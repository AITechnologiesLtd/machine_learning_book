<P>I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMERDirected by Jim Gillespie
  Hearing that "I Know What You Did Last Summer" comes from the
word-processor of Kevin Williamson, writer of last year's surprisingly
smart "Scream," could entice you to take a look at this teens-in-peril
thriller. Alas, the sophomore jinx has struck hard: Though "Summer"
eventually runs through most of the cliches of its genre, it's
noticeably lacking in the witty spins "Scream" put on such material.
Call it a case of tired blood.
 "Summer" begins with a beach party gone wrong. High school grads Julie
(Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry (Ryan
Phillippe) and Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.) spend the night of July 4th
whooping it up, but they have little to celebrate when they accidentally
run down a man on their way home. Terrified of being held on murder
charges, the four decide to dump the body in the ocean, only to find
their crime resurfacing a year later, as a mysterious stalker begins
terrorizing them and sending ominous notes that seem to warn of impending
doom.
 From this point on, you can probably play it by ear, since Williamson's
script has no major surprises lurking in it. The resolution of the story
falls flat, partially because it's completely unbelievable and partially
because the killer turns out to be the most obvious suspect. And while
any cod in the audience will undoubtedly shiver at the sight of a
murderer in fisherman's garb, it looks pretty silly to us land-lubbers.
 Throughout, Hewitt and Gellar scream with conviction, Phillippe preens
and Prinze basically does a lot of blank-eyed staring (he's much better
in "The House of Yes," in which he actually has a character
to play). The only interesting performance comes from Anne Heche,
playing the inscrutable near-albino sister of a murder victim. What
she's doing in this trifle is anyone's guess, but she brings some
much-needed spookiness to what's essentially an "Afterschool Special"
with a body count.
