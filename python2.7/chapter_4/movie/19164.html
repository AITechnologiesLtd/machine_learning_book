<PRE>Summer of Sam
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>***1/2 (out of 4) NOTE: SUMMER OF SAM IS RATED R FOR LOTS OF SEX AND A
LITTLE GORE, SOME OF WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THIS REVIEW. READ AT
YOUR OWN RISK. </P>
<P>When it comes to evoking a time and place, nobody is better than Spike
Lee. In DO THE RIGHT THING, he created an entire neighborhood and a
memorable, palpable couple of days. In SUMMER OF SAM, Lee does it again.
Moreover, the interesting racial and ethical gray areas that spangled DO
THE RIGHT THING, add texture to this movie.</P>
<P>SUMMER OF SAM is set in the Bronx, New York, in the summer of 1977, one
of the hottest summers on record. It was also the summer that the
so-called "Son of Sam" serial killer was on the loose. Fear of the
serial killer (so the movie says) forever defines that time and place.</P>
<P>Lee is often an impressionist filmmaker. He'll try to capture a moment
in time. Small details, like a "Dead End" sign, or a heat wave, or a
serial killer in the headlines really aren't that important to the plot,
but are essential to definition of time and place. And even WITHIN the
movie, Lee highlights a particular moment with an oddly-chosen image
(like when he shows the space BETWEEN two characters, rather than the
characters themselves) or with expressionistic lighting and effects
(i.e., effects that reflects the characters' inner moods, rather than
external reality).</P>
<P>So although the Son of Sam killer (now know to be David Berkowitz,
played by Michael Badalucco) is in this movie, his role is small. This
is not a horror movie about a serial killer. Rather, it is an ensemble
drama. The serial killings touch the lives of the characters, but only
indirectly as future memories.</P>
<P>The movie's center is Vinnie (John Leguizamo, proving himself to be a
talented actor), a small-time hairdresser. Vinnie is married to Dionna
(Mira Sorvino) and the two make a handsome couple.</P>
<P>Their sex life is busy, but troubled. Vinnie likes all kinds of sex, but
he believes that he can only have "normal" sex with his wife. She, on
the other hand, would like to please him however she can, and so both of
them end up unsatisfied and frustrated.</P>
<P>In many movies, dialogue about, and depiction of their sex life would be
gratuitous, but in SUMMER OF SAM, it really drives the characters' words
and actions. Without it, we wouldn't know who the characters are or why
their relationship is as troubled as it is.</P>
<P>Vinnie also hangs around with his old buddies from the neighborhood.
Joey (Michael Rispoli) and his three pals can almost always be found at
the dead end, peddling drugs and discussing the issues of the day. Their
machismo makes for some of the movie's funniest conversations. Everyone
has to be the smartest and the loudest, which sometimes makes for a
conversation where everyone is talking and nobody is listening. It's a
bit of insightful writing and directing by Lee.</P>
<P>Vinnie's friend Richie re-emerges into the neighborhood with a Sid
Vicious hairdo, a British-flag t-shirt, and an English-punk accent. Once
they recognize him, Richie is still allowed to be "one of the guys," but
just barely. Vinnie still likes him because they go way back. Joey's
gang tolerates him because he's a paying customer.</P>
<P>But his appearances aren't all that has changed (or should I say
emerged?). When Richie needs money, he dances at a gay strip bar, then
gets a few extra "tips" back stage. He has a girlfriend, but their
relationship is more platonic than she'd like.</P>
<P>So when Joey's gang finds out about Richie's homosexuality, (added to
his weird behavior & appearance) they decide that he must be the Son of
Sam killer. One night they drive over to the punk club where they think
he'll be.</P>
<P>The contrast between the cultures is huge: four Italian street toughs
among a club full of pierced, mohawked, leathered punks. Perhaps the
epitome of that contrast is the image of Vinnie in his disco best,
talking over old times with Richie in his new blond mohawk. The
conversation soon becomes an argument, Vinnie accusing Richie of having
changed so much and Richie saying he's just being himself. Both of them
are as right and as honest as they've been in the whole movie. Yet their
perspectives are so different that it seems like they're just fighting.
Neither can see the other's point of view, which really sums up the
tragedy of the whole Jocks-vs.-Goths war.</P>
<P>In a classic enactment of that war, Joey's gang forms a posse to go take
care of Richie, once and for all. They've learned he's at home tonight,
and they're off to make him pay. For a moment, it seems like they know
what they're doing is wrong. They hesitate. Their revenge requires some
moral legitimacy, so they decide to make Vinnie come along and be a part
of their mob. Vinnie is so messed up from problems with his wife and
from alcohol and drugs that he gives in to their pressure.</P>
<P>The dreadful march of the vigilantes is tensely intercut with the
triumphant capture of the real Son of Sam killer. The appropriately
grave score (from Terrence Blanchard) and well-chosen song (The Who's
WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN) bring the movie to its grim, yet hopeful close.</P>
<P>Spike Lee is a great director. He is one of the best when it comes to
pulling great performances from a large cast, and when it comes to
creating a real, palpable impression of a moment. He has made his share
of bad movies, but when he's on his mark, he is very good. SUMMER OF SAM
will surely be remembered among the best. </P>
