<P>     Mare Winningham and Jennifer Jason Leigh play two singing sisters,
one stable and quite successful, the other addicted to gross self-
destruction.  Guess which one Leigh plays.  Director Ulu Grosband's
uncomfortable drama has been winning praise ever since Cannes and the
Montreal World Film Festival, where, at the latter, it was inexplicably
awarded two top awards.  As written by Barbara Turner (Leigh's Mom),
GEORGIA fancies itself as a musical "tough love" tale; a story where the
"better" half truly loves and, thus, must tolerate the "less-fortunate"
one.  Bullshit.  Everyone in this movie-- including the *very* good
Winningham-- tolerates Leigh's behavior, never once forcing her to help
herself.  That's fine, I guess, for those legions of people who enjoy
watching this sort of spiraling self-abuse.  They are probably the same
ones who thought that Leigh was *fabulous* in MRS. PARKER AND THE
VICIOUS CIRCLE.  Me, I fell asleep.</P>
