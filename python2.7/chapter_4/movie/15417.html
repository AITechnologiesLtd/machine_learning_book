<P>Great family entertainment is rare nowadays.  Many films and TV shows like
to present themselves under the guise of being entertaining for the whole
family, but most are not.  `Family Entertainment' is an abused expression by
studio marketers that are trying to peddle films or videos that really only
appeal to kids.  They say their product is `for the whole family', but as
the kids laugh and giggle, Mom and Dad find themselves nodding off.</P>
<P>As I define it, `Family Entertainment' is something that literally everyone
in the family can enjoy, no matter how young or old they may be.  "A Bug's
Life" is family entertainment at its absolute best.</P>
<P>Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation collaborated on one of this decade'
s most revolutionary films, 1995's "Toy Story".  It was the first film to be
animated entirely by CGI (Computer Generated Imagery).  This holiday season,
Disney and Pixar give us their second effort, the energetic and highly
entertaining "A Bug's Life".  Also animated by CGI technology, "A Bug's
Life" is a sumptuous visual treat that takes the look of "Toy Story" to
another level.  And whereas it may not have quite the level of character
depth as its 1995 predecessor, "A Bug's Life" is a smart, fun adventure that
is as pleasing to the sense of sight as it is to the sense of humor.</P>
<P>"A Bug's Life" is the story of an ant colony oppressed by a gang of
grasshoppers.  Using their superior strength, the scary grasshoppers strike
fear into the ants, threatening them with their very lives if they do not
give the grasshoppers all of the food they have harvested through the summer
and fall.  Feeling powerless to do anything, the ants hopelessly give into
this demand.  Except one.</P>
<P>Flik, a simple worker ant with aspirations of being an inventor, is viewed
by most of the colony as eccentric, high-minded and foolish.  Yearning to
redeem himself, Flik ventures out of the ant colony in the hopes of
recruiting other insects as defenders of the ant harvest.  Through a
hilarious sequence of mistaken identity, Flik enlists a group of carnival
insects for this battle, believing them to be warrior insects.  This
alliance-by-misunderstanding evolves into a fable which shows us that belief
and faith in oneself and others enables us to achieve feats that reach
beyond our perceived limitations.  It is a wonderfully affirming morality
tale in the grand tradition of Disney's best animated features.</P>
<P>The story for "A Bug's Life" succeeds where so many family-oriented movies
fail.  It tells an exciting story with interesting characters that is
entertaining to adults while being fascinating to children.  The story is
very well structured; it displays excellent character development and
legitimate dramatic tension that challenges the resolve of its characters,
all building to an exciting climax.  It also employs a sharp wit with quick
barbs and observations that are uproariously funny.  In today's sex obsessed
culture, this is a shining example of truly great humor.  It is comedy that
makes you laugh out loud without relying on easily concocted sexual
innuendoes.  This is a smart, funny script with a positive, heartwarming
message.</P>
<P>"A Bug's Life" may very well be the most perfectly cast film of the year.
Boasting an impressive list of actors, the voices and characterizations
simply could not have been better.  Actors such as Dave Foley, Julia-Louis
Dreyfus, David Hyde Pierce and John Ratzenberger could be classified as
`Must See Voiceovers' as they are mostly known for their work on popular NBC
sitcoms ("NewsRadio", "Seinfeld", "Frasier" and "Cheers", respectively).  As
familiar and perfect are the voices of Pierce and Ratzenberger for their
characters, Dreyfus does well as Princess Atta in that she is appropriately
straight-forward instead of being the overly extroverted Elaine, all the
while maintaining her hallmark energy.  And while Foley doesn't do anything
that is necessarily spectacular, his performance of Flik is both exuberant
and tender.</P>
<P>Kevin Spacey has one of the film's juiciest roles as the maniacal Hopper,
leader of the oppressive grasshopper clan.  While being aggressively angry
at the appropriate moments, the greatness that Spacey brings to Hopper is a
quiet, calm, but fear-inducing authority.  He doesn't always explode with
hot rantings.  But rather, he pierces each ant with a cold look and a
chilling whisper.  Spin City's Richard Kind plays Molt, Hopper's hilarious
suck-up of a sidekick.  Kind's loud brashness provides much of the film's
humor.</P>
<P>My favorite performance would have to be that of Joe Ranft.  As well as
being one of the film's screenwriters, Joe Ranft provides the voice for
Heimlich, the shy and naïve chubby caterpillar with the voice of a
seven-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger.  The combined talents of Ranft and the
animators make Heimlich a funny and endearing character.</P>
<P>Kids and adults alike will gaze in awe at the artwork in this film.  With
its bright colors, three-dimensional textures, and smooth flow of movement,
"A Bug's Life" is a visual marvel.  There is a great deal of movement in
this picture with so many things going on at once.  It is a complex
orchestration of moving images that is utterly impressive.  The colors burst
off of the screen with rich greens, blue hues, and even a foreboding sunset.</P>
<P>The array of insects in the story led to vastly different character designs
and creations.  It is a veritable smorgasbord of creativity, presenting us
with little creatures that range from the stout and round to the tall and
thin, and virtually everything imaginable in between.  Perhaps the best
character designs are the grasshoppers.  With scaly, rough detail and
precise nuances of movement, the grasshoppers really come to life.  The
multi-legged anatomy is clearly on display as the grasshoppers move around
effortlessly.  The grasshoppers are, in my opinion, the best creatures I've
seen created using CGI technology.</P>
<P>Randy Newman, who delivered one of this year's best film scores with his
compositions for "Pleasantville", has broken new personal ground with his
work for "A Bug's Life".  Newman hasn't broached full-fledged adventure
territory before, but proves himself more than up for the task.  Newman's
score is a rousing one that captures and accentuates the action and
excitement of the story.  It's so good that I'm willing to forgive him for
the annoyingly typical Randy Newman song that plays under the film's end
credits.</P>
<P>It's hard to avoid comparisons with the DreamWorks CGI film "Antz" that was
released less than two months prior to this movie's release.  But I believe
it is unfair and pointless to compare the two for it would be an `apples and
oranges' scenario.  "Antz" is a great film in its own right, as is "A Bug's
Life".  And although there are a few unavoidable similarities between them,
they really are two different films at heart.  Whereas "Antz" has an adult
sophistication to it, "A Bug's Life" is a childlike magical adventure.  In
fact, I can't remember the last time a film has genuinely made me feel like
a kid again as "A Bug's Life" did.  Perhaps it is for this reason that I
personally give an edge to "A Bug's Life", but not necessarily because it is
(in technical cinematic terms) a better film.</P>
<P>As an added treat, last year's Academy Award winner for Best Animated Short
Film, "Geri's Game", is shown in front of "A Bug's Life".  Also made by
Pixar Animation Studios, it is the oddly fun story of an old man playing
chess-against himself.  Thank Disney for this fun bonus, an Oscar winning
film unseen by a wide audience until now.  And on the other side of the
spectrum, there's fun to be had after the conclusion of the film as well.
Make sure to stick around for the end credit roll to enjoy some of the film'
s funniest moments.</P>
<P>With films like "What Dreams May Come", "Antz", "Dark City", and
"Pleasantville", 1998 has been a banner year for breathtaking cinematic
imagery.  Now you can add "A Bug's Life" to that list.  Like those films, it
is a true work of art that ultimately comes to life through its hilariously
enchanting insects and adventurous story.  And if you're not careful, the
story may even eventually move you as its brave characters exemplify the
story's moral of having faith in oneself and those around you.  "A Bug's
Life" is pure, unadulterated fun that is also spectacular filmmaking.  For
great family entertainment, the surefire bet presently in theaters is Disney
's "A Bug's Life", a rousing animated adventure that is destined to become a
classic.</P>
