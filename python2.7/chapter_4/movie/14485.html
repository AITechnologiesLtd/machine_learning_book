<PRE>_Cube_ (R) **
_Pi_ (R) *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Wanna make a science fiction thriller, but don't have the money for
big-budget effects?  Then turn to math, as have neophyte feature filmmakers
Vincenzo Natali and Darren Aronofsky for their films _Cube_ and _Pi_,
respectively.</P>
<P>_Cube_'s story is fairly thin: six strangers (Nicole deBoer, Nicky
Guadagni, David Hewlett, Andrew Miller, Wayne Robson, and Maurice Dean
Wint) wake up to find themselves trapped in a 14' by 14' cube, with doors
on each wall, the ceiling, and the floor.  This cube, as it turns out, is
simply one of many in a much larger structure, and the six try to find
their way out of the labyrinthian prison--that is, if they can crack the
mathematical code that will lead them to the exit.  With a piddly budget of
only $365,000 (in Canadian dollars), _Cube_ is more visually inventive than
films that cost twenty times more.  Natali shot _Cube_ on a single 14'x14'
set, made to look like many different cubes through the use of
different-colored lighting; the effect is entirely convincing.  But for all
his creative ingenuity, Natali and co-writers Andre Bijelic and Graeme
Manson could have come up with a stronger script.  As claustrophobic as the
setting is, the film is remarkably unscary.  The queasy promise of the
chilling opening scene (in which an unfortunate prisoner is sliced and
diced into cube steak by a booby trap) soon dissipates with the
introduction of the flat, uninvolving characters, who predictably come at
odds because of personality conflicts, anxiety, insanity, or any
combination of the three.  Too much time is spent on these interpersonal
conflicts and too little on the mechanical ones, i.e. evading traps like
those in the prologue.  Adding to the narrative tedium are the often
laughably amateurish turns by the justly unknown cast.</P>
<P>Aronofsky had even less--only $60,000--to work with on _Pi_, but he
achieves the overpowering atmosphere of fear and paranoia that Natali and
company obviously strived for in _Cube_.  Aronofsky, Sean Gullette, and
Eric Watson's story is sometimes confounding; it details an math genius's
(Gullette) rapid descent into madness when he finally discovers a
long-obsessed-over mathematical pattern to the stock market, Jewish
mysticism, and, it appears, the universe itself.  But story seems to be a
moot point in Aronofsky's frenzied vision; the intent is to create a living
nightmare of psychological horror, and he succeeds most unsettlingly
through his use of stark, sometimes grainy, black and white photography;
frenetic editing; and a pulsating electronic score.  Many films purport to
be something "unlike you've ever seen"; few films actually deliver.  The
stylish and scary _Pi_ is one of those few.</P>
