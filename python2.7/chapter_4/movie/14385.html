                                  RUSH HOUR
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow
                              (c) Copyright 1998</PRE>

<PRE>                   RATING: *** 1/2 (out of a possible *****)</PRE>
<P>        Let me get this off my chest before we go any further: I hate
Chris Tucker.  I mean it.  I'd love nothing more than to wrap my
hands around his goofy little neck and just SQUEEZE, giggling with
maniacal laughter as his face contorts into an expression even more
spastic than the one he usually wears.  I'm not a violent person by
nature, but there's just something about his "fingernails on a
chalkboard" voice, coupled with his jittery "let me get right in your
face" attitude, that grates on every fiber of my being.</P>
<P>        By contrast, I adore Jackie Chan; his sunny screen
personality and hilarious physical humor can win over even the most
jaded critic.  Rarely seen without his trademark grin, Chan is one of
those rare celebrities (like Leslie Neilsen, during his heyday) whose
mere appearance on the screen can cause you to smile: even if he's
not doing anything funny, your face feels the need to prepare itself
for the laughter it knows is forthcoming.  Chan's secret: he plays UP
to the audience, going so far as to perform all his own stunts because
(as he claimed in a recent interview), "that's what the fans expect."
Now THAT'S dedication to one's craft.</P>
<P>        The pairing of these two vastly different comedians is an
intriguing concept, one that could've succeeded brilliantly or failed
miserably.  Did director Brett Ratner channel Chan and Tucker's
conflicting comedic styles into a coherent film?  Happily, yes.
"Rush Hour" is a wild ride, a pleasant, giddy marriage of mirth and
action, with Chan's physical humor serving as a nice counterpoint to
Tucker's loud, verbal comedy.</P>
<P>        James Carter (Tucker) is a Los Angeles cop with a penchant
for annoying his boss, his co-workers, and pretty much everyone else
he encounters.  After his latest undercover assignment ends in
disaster, Carter's superiors are looking for an excuse to get him out
of their hair for a while.  Their chance arrives when the daughter of
a wealthy Hong Kong politician is abducted.  The politician, Mr. Han
(Tzi Ma), distrusts the American law enforcement agencies and wishes
to bring in one of his own men: Detective Lee (Chan).  The American
authorities instruct Carter and Lee to partner up, intending to keep
the bumbling pair busy with grunt work, and thus out of the way of
the "real" investigation.  Our heroes, naturally, have other plans.</P>
<P>        "Rush Hour" crackles with energy and spirit, and director
Ratner extracts great performances from his two leads.  Tucker is
more restrained here than his hammy appearance in "The Fifth
Element," but nowhere near the level of his fine (borderline serious)
work in Tarantino's "Jackie Brown"; nonetheless, he's entertaining
enough that I tended to find myself laughing rather than wincing.
(Incidentally, Tucker gets the film's funniest line: after his
supervisor angrily announces that Tucker's shenanigans have resulted
in the destruction of police evidence, Tucker meekly retorts: "We
still got a little bit left.")  I think I know why he didn't really
bother me this time around: he's playing a character who's SUPPOSED
to be obnoxious and annoying, and he performs the role with gusto.
I guess I only find him infuriating when he's injecting that kind of
attitude into a part that doesn't really need it, such as his "Fifth
Element" character.</P>
<P>        Chan is also in top form: his stunts are as impressive as
ever, though perhaps less frequent than we've come to expect
(reportedly at his insurance company's insistence); still, what's
here is wonderful.  The two finest moments for me were the pool hall
fight sequence, and the surrealistic art gallery battle.  And yes,
like all of Chan's films, we're treated to a hilarious collection of
outtakes and bloopers at the end of the final reel.</P>
<P>        One of the reasons "Rush Hour" is such marvelous fun is the
fact that the film is steadfastly unconcerned with anything other
than telling its story; therefore, it does so with great flourish.
Granted, the plot is nothing new: we have two mismatched cops who
intensely dislike each other, but must nonetheless work together to
solve a case.  Over the course of their investigation, each will
naturally develop a mutual respect and admiration for the other.
Toss in the standard "guess which of the good guys is really the
villain" plot, as well as the cliched "kidnapped daughter" storyline.
The final cherry on top: the mandatory scene in which someone has to
decide which wire to cut in order to defuse a bomb, a scene we've
witnessed in "Armageddon" and countless other action movies.</P>
<P>        Is "Rush Hour" breathtakingly original?  Hardly.  Is it a
whole lot of fun?  Very much so.  The laughs are frequent, the action
is first-rate... and Jackie Chan's passionnate rendition of the '60s
rock anthem "War" is worth the price of admission by itself.</P>
