<PRE>                            MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a GOODBYE MR. CHIPS for the
          1990s.  Richard Dreyfus plays a would-be composer
          and musician who turns music teacher and inspires
          generations of students.  This is a more than
          usually realistic view of the teaching career that
          blows its credibility in the last ten minutes.
          Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     I greatly respect for the teaching profession, though I cannot say
the same of all films made about teaching.  We see a lot of films about
the teaching profession and with a few notable exceptions (much notably
THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE), they generally make the teacher a hero.
Teacher-hero stories fall into two different categories.  One is the
"flashbulb" sort of story, the other is the "candle."  Flashbulb
teacher films generally cover one semester.  They have a new teacher
come in and be faced with a nearly impossible situation.  Either the
students are totally establishment thinkers, the classroom is in total
anarchy, or the students are treated by school officials as if they
have the intelligence of water fowl.  The teacher comes in, bringing
with him or her the word that there is a world out there of knowledge
and culture.  Then in one quick semester the new erudition transforms
the lives of the students.  Example of this sort of film include DEAD
POETS SOCIETY, RENAISSANCE MAN, TO SIR WITH LOVE, and STAND AND
DELIVER.  The teacher has brought enlightenment in one quick flash.
This is rarely how the teaching profession operates.</P>
<P>     Not as common, because they are generally less dramatic, are the
films in which the teacher deals with many classes of students over a
long period of time.  This sort of film is much more realistic.  Rather
than as a flash of enlightenment, the teacher has been there as a
source of culture for generations of students and, like the candle, the
more that is given the less there is left for the teacher himself.
Often the teacher has wondered if it has all mattered or not and his or
her efforts have made a difference.  But in the end the teacher who may
even consider himself or herself as a failure comes to realize the deep
respect that the effort has brought.  This sort of film is a little
more realistic.  It includes GOODBYE, MR. CHIPS; GOOD MORNING, MISS
DOVE; and the latest along these lines, MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS.  In 1964
Richard Dreyfuss is a young musician and would-be composer who, in
order to keep food on the table, takes a job as the high school music
teacher of the newly-renamed John F. Kennedy High School.  He finds the
faculty unfriendly and unwelcoming and the students completely
indifferent to the history of music.  The school band makes a noise
about as pleasant as the sound of a dentist's drill.  He also has to
admit his teaching is uninspired and unsuccessful.  Eventually Holland
decides that if his students cannot relate to Bach, he should try rock
and roll and from there slowly he makes headway.  The film follows
Mr. Holland's life in and out of school.  What he first thought of asa
temporary teaching job that would give him the leisure to compose his
own music instead soaks up all of his time for more than three decades
of his life.  He is able to overcome most obstacles by being well-
meaning and being willing to put in the effort.  The film concentrates
on Holland's relationship with his wife, with his deaf son, with the
buzz-cut assistant principal (William H. Macy), with legions of
talentless students and one very talented singer, and especially with
himself and his dream of composing.  The story of his career for more
than three decades of teaching are shown in about two and a half hours
as a diverse and diffuse mosaic.  Some of the scenes are overly
emotional, but for the most part the film retains an air of
authenticity until the last ten minutes.   The film tries too hard to
have a big finish and spoils much of its credibility.</P>
<P>     Dreyfuss is an accomplished actor, but a lot of accomplished
actors have played teachers.  However, one thing that set Dreyfuss
apart is that he really looked like a high school teacher.  Instead of
handsome and dynamic, he looks very average, the model of what viewers
will remember their teachers looked like.  Because there are a lot of
different relationships in this film, we see considerably less of any
of the other characters.  Glenne Headly is believable but not memorable
as the long suffering Mrs. Holland who only occasionally shows a
resentment that her husband allows himself to be consumed by his job.
The film was written by Patrick Duncan, who wrote and directed 84
CHARLIE MOPIC and wrote A HOME OF OUR OWN.  Director Stephen Herek
seems to have learned a lot about how schools run since he directed
BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE.  More recently he directed THE
MIGHTY DUCKS and THE THREE MUSKETEERS.  The film is a little on the
manipulative side, but it should be an audience pleaser.  I give it a
low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
