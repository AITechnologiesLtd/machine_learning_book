<PRE>                                  ROB ROY
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: We don't get many serious films about
          legendary heroes like this any more.  Scotland's
          famous outlaw comes to the screen as a sort of
          Highland Robin Hood in a plot that would have done
          Errol Flynn proud.  Nicely photographed also, the
          film is a pleasant surprise.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Like Robin Hood, or for that matter Billy the Kid, Rob Roy
(actually Robert Macgregor--nicknamed Roy for his red hair) was a real
outlaw who has passed into the realm of legend and folklore.  The film
ROB ROY is based on these legends, though no specific source is
credited.  It bears little connection to the Sir Walter Scott novel of
the same name, except that the same outlaw appears in the novel.
Instead, the film is based on historic and legendary accounts of the
outlaw, the best known of which was "The Highland Rogue" by Daniel
Defoe.  On a very high level, the story of the film is accurate, at
least to the legends, although clearly there are pieces of other film
adventures mixed into this film's plot.  The stories say that he did
borrow money for a cattle venture from a former employer, the first
duke of Montrose, who held lands near Rob Roy's.  When Rob Roy was
unable to pay the loan back in 1712, he lost his home and was outlawed.
To survive he turned bandit, mostly preying on Montrose and his tenants
but remaining friendly with another neighbor, the duke of Argyll.
Though the film invents some, this part of the plot is true to the
legend of Rob Roy.</P>
<P>     This film is the stuff of the old matinees of the 40s.  The
decision to make this film was likely inspired by the success of THE
LAST OF THE MOHICANS, and with the exception of that film, it is a
sub-genre we see too rarely these days.  Too often what could be this
type of film comes out more as a poorly-conceived self-satire like the
bitterly disappointing ROBIN HOOD, PRINCE OF THIEVES.  That film had
little accuracy to the legends of Robin Hood, threw in devices like
telescopes that have no place in the legends, and had a Sheriff of
Nottingham playing way over the top.  ROB ROY is a much more
intelligent adaptation of a heroic legend.</P>
<P>     While being the sort of larger-than-life historical heroic
adventure that would have starred Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn, it
respects itself and its source material.  The major stylistic
differences include better photography, a little sex, and a fascination
with the obscure (but obviously considered very important) historical
fact that the period shown predated indoor plumbing.</P>
<P>     The story is much the same as above.  Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is an
occasional thief who has a strong sense of honor concerning his word.
He is made an outlaw by three particularly nasty (and well-cast) screen
villains, the Duke of Montrose (John Hurt), his assistant Killearn
(played by Brian Cox, Hannibal Lector from MANHUNTER), and, worst of
all, Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth--Pumpkin from PULP FICTION), whose
slight build and exaggerated effete, foppish manners hide a sadist and
a clever strategist as well as a deadly swordsman.  Rob Roy's wife
Mary, more earthy and less bloodthirsty than Walter Scott's version of
her, is played by Jessica Lange.  The duke of Argyll is played with
dignity by Andrew Keir (who played Quatermass in QUATERMASS AND THE
PIT, a.k.a. FIVE MILLION YEARS TO EARTH).  Finally, as a fellow
clansman, is Eric Stoltz in a real departure for him.  To an American
ear, the Scottish accents are thick enough to make listening an effort.
To me they sounded accurate, but I am willing to take a second opinion
from a Scot.</P>
<P>     ROB ROY has gotten the treatment of a big spectacular.  Karl
Walter Lindenlaub's camera takes full advantage of the Highland
scenery, using wide screen to capture a symmetry in the mountain
landscapes.  His frame typically will be centered between two hills of
equal height at the two sides of the frame with a pleasing downward
curve between for a valley shot.  That speaks of careful camera
placement.  He uses this pleasing symmetry of his shots to
counterbalance the negative effect of the fog-shrouded mountains.  The
opening showing the MacGregor Clan running over the hills seems like an
allusion to the opening of THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, but in general
Michael Caton-Smith goes for unusual effects.  A key sword fight is
done without underscoring music, leaving the actors to build the
suspense rather than to have a composer create the emotion, an approach
used all too rarely.</P>
<P>     ROB ROY is a well-made heroic adventure film with a little more
sex and grossness than a 1940s MGM adventure film might have had, but
not more than what modern audiences expect.  I give this film a +2 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
