<P>[3.5/4.0]  (dialog in Bengali, English subtitles)</P>
<P>This film, with the English title "The Unvanquished", is the second
installment of Satyajit Ray's "Apu Trilogy".</P>
<P>Although it is can be coherent story when viewed by itself, it
definitely builds upon the context provided in "Pather Panchali".
That narrative concluded with the Roy family leaving the ancestral
village to seek a better existence in Benares, the holy city on the
Ganga (Ganges). This film picks up at that point, and we see that
the Roys' fortunes have improved. Although they live in a shared
house, Hari's (Kanu Bannerjee) regular work as a priest brings in a
steady income and Apu (Pinaki Sengupta as the child, Smaran Ghosal
as the adolescent) has made new friends and he is thriving. Sarbojaya
(Karuna Bannerjee) still worries, but they have found the stability
she had been seeking. However, this all changes when Hari dies of a
sudden illness. With the death of her daughter (which occurred in
the previous film) and her husband, Sarbojaya now only has Apu. She
decides to move them to the countryside, and there Apu is able to
learn priestly duties from his grand-uncle. However, Apu aspires to
go to school, and with determination and their meager savings, he is
able to attend. At school he becomes an outstanding student, and
earns the opportunity for further studies in Calcutta on scholarship.
Going away to school has opened a new world for Apu, but it has also
separated him from Sarbojaya.</P>
<P>Once again, Satyajit Ray has sculpted a masterpiece. It continues the
saga of the trilogy, but it also explores somewhat different themes.
 "Pather Panchali" dealt with the road of life, this film focuses more
narrowly on the dynamics of an individual relationship, namely that of
Sarbojaya and Apu. As a result, the pace of this film is more crisp,
with limited use of interspersed cinematic flourishes which would slow
the narrative. The issues of commitment and dependence are explored.
Sarbojaya displays the strength of her spirit by not being broken from
the hardships that have befallen her. The soberness of the story is
tempered with small nuggets of simple humor. As in the previous film,
this film is backed with the delightful and appropriate music of Ravi
Shankar.</P>
<P>The acting performances are outstanding, although few characters are
given exposure besides Sarbojaya and Apu. Kanu Bannerjee is again
exceptional, as she handles the character's evolution into a world-
weary but resolved and loving mother. Smaran Ghosal does a fantastic
job as the adolescent Apu. The character is naive, and often self-
absorbed, from simple childish immaturity. Although he does not intend
to be uncaring, his determination blinds him to the requirements of
responsibility. This is a multifaceted character and Ghosal is able to
combine all the parts into a credible whole.</P>
<P>As Apu discovers a passion for learning, he immerses himself in that
world, which unwittingly separates him from his mother. Apu proudly
recounts what he has learned to Sarbojaya, and she shows her happiness
in seeing her son doing well as something he loves, a success which
eluded his father. However, in these scenes, like Apu describing the
positions of the sun, earth and moon to Sarbojaya, it is obvious that
this is a foreign world to her. Eventually, his passion takes him to
another city, and essentially away from Sarbojaya. It is wrenching to
see the conflicts involved with Apu's decision to study away in
Calcutta. Apu's intoxication with knowledge is so endearing and his
drive to succeed is so overriding that it is wholely understandable
that he does not see how his departure would affect his mother.
Sarbojaya's desire for Apu to stay with her is also understandable
because she desperately wants to keep her last remaining treasure with
her, not because she wants to restrict Apu in any way. She shows her
tremendous strength of character by not being possessive of Apu.
Eventually fate unrolls the results of the decisions the individuals
make.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. Ray has crafted another masterpiece which captures
the drama of the human condition in a simple story. The story is
engaging and moving. It can be watched on its own, but for full
appreciation, it should be viewed after "Pather Panchali."</P>
