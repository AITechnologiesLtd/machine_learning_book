<P>Kevin Smith follows up the insane success that he had with his first
film CLERKS (8.5/10), which incidentally he had personally financed for
about $27,000, with a $6Million Disney financed
pop-cultured-teenage-boys-wet-dream movie starring the 90210-famed
Shannon Doherty and skateboard sensation Jason Lee. This movie features
everything from video games, comic books, movie references and
GenX-based thoughts and dialogue, to early roles by big Ben Affleck and
Claire "I'm working with Brad Pitt now" Forlani. All that, and clean
boob shots of both CHASING AMY (7.5/10) star Joey Lauren Adams and
Terri from TV "Three's Company". Wow, what a man!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Best friends Brodie and T.S. both get dumped by their girlfriends on
the same day, and attempt to rejuvenate their lives by spending another
empty day in the nearby mall. The mall gives them plenty of time to run
into friends, trouble and get arrested, as their plans to win back
their girlfriends begin to crystallize. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Excellent written dialogue, plotless plot, and sporadically weak acting
qualify this film as a mediocre overly-juvenile teenage addition to the
umpteen better films made in its very homage. I will be absolutely
honest with you, and tell you that I hate to not love this movie
because I am actually a huge personal Kevin Smith fan, but I cannot
pretend that I enjoyed this flick much more than I really did. I will
admit that as per Kevin's usual style, his dialogue was impeccably
written, but spoken at too fast a pace by many of its actors, with too
many inside jokes for anyone to grasp within that time. Add that to the
fact that the Jay and Silent Bob roles seemed written just for the sake
of physical gags, and I can't say that this follow-up to the film that
inspired me to take my personal screenwriting seriously (CLERKS) is
worthy of much more than a late Sunday afternoon rent session. Although
the scene with the boys and the Easter Bunny is to die for!</P>
<P>Having said that, I did love the acting job by Jason Lee, who seemed to
relish his role of Brodie with great anger and furious appreciation.
You could tell that he really loved his delivering his lines, like one
of my favorite exchanges between him and his girlfriend Shannon
Doherty:</P>
<P>Doherty: "I've never met a person who lives in as much fear of his
mother as you do."
Lee: "You want I should tell my mother what we do in here at night?"
Doherty: "What...that you play video games and I fall asleep
unfulfilled?"</P>
<P>Classic Smith. Having said that, I thought the other main character in
the film as portrayed by Jeremy London was boring and played rather
unsuccessfully by said London. Forlani was also poor in her role as the
"always looking nervous" girlfriend, while Affleck pulled off his dance
as the macho A-hole magnificently. Now, despite the film having plenty
of funny lines, it did also contain many duds, while others seemed
scripted or just too literate to be uttered by the dudes in this film.
Having said all that, I did enjoy most of the lines, and the boatload
of movie homages (Off the top of my head, there were tender pokes at
JAWS, BATMAN, GODFATHER, STAR WARS, APOCALYPSE NOW, and many
others....) but was eventually bored by the ultimately anti-climactic
dating game show ending, and the lack of consistency in the movie. Fans
of Kevin Smith should check it out for fun, but others should watch it
only if they enjoy well-written dialogue, comic books and movie
references galore! Otherwise, get out there and rent one of the
funniest and best-written films of all time...CLERKS!!!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Kevin Smith once personally helped me get going with one of my scripts
in Hollywood. On top of being a cinematic genius, the man is also a
generous human being. What else could you ask for?
Kevin Smith had auditioned over 600 hopefuls for the role of Brandi,
before he saw Claire Forlani. He was immediately taken with her spot-on
impersonation of a callow American youth, and promptly offered to hire
her. Only after they'd sealed the deal did he learn that the actress
whose mannerisms and delivery had so impressed him was British.
This film was shot on location in the Eden Prairie Center in Minnesota.
Producer Scott Mosier played a character named Roddy in this film.
Ethan Suplee, the fat kid who can never seem to see the images within
those 3D pictures, also starred as the fat skinhead in 1998's fine
motion picture AMERICAN HISTORY X (8/10).
The two main characters are named Brodie and Quint, an obvious
reference to 1975's JAWS (7.5/10).
The background music when T.S. and Hamilton are waiting for the
elevator is the same as in the elevator in THE BLUES BROTHERS.
T.S. Quint's initials were taken from T.S. Garp, the character Robin
Williams played in THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP (6/10). 
It was soon after this film that Kevin Smith and Joey Lauren Adams
started going out. Their relationship ended soon after the release of
CHASING AMY (7.5/10), in which she starred.
Kevin Smith thanks a lot of people at the end of this movie, but here
are some of my favorites:</P>
<P>"God- for another opportunity to tell my stupid stories."
"Jim- (producer James Jacks) for treating us like the Coens as opposed
to the twenty-something know-nothings we really are."
"Bob- (Miramax co-chairman Bob Weinstein) for laughing during the
pitch."
And lastly..."John Landis and John Hughes- for giving me something to
do throughout my youth on Friday nights."</P>
