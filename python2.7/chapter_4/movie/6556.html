<P>     SCREAM is a rarity:  a horror movie spoof that succeeds almost as=20
well at provoking scares as laughs.  That's because director Wes Craven=20
(A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET), in addition to having a genuine affection=20
for the genre, understands how wildly improbable and easy to lampoon it=20
is.  And, with SCREAM, he skewers it at every corner, using self-
referential humor and a flood of in-jokes (some subtle, some obvious).</P>
<P>     The list of movies mentioned or satirized is amazingly long, and=20
features everything from the 1931 Universal classic, FRANKENSTEIN, to=20
Tom Cruise's ALL THE RIGHT MOVES ("if you pause [the video] at the right=20
place, you can see his penis").  Craven, never one to take himself too=20
seriously, pokes fun at his own reputation and his movies, at one point=20
calling himself "Wes Carpenter" (an allusion to the numerous people who=20
confuse him with director John Carpenter).  References to Carpenter's=20
original HALLOWEEN abound; several minutes of footage from that film are=20
used here in a uniquely effective manner.</P>
<P>     SCREAM opens with a 12-minute prologue that introduces us to Casey=20
(Drew Barrymore), an all-American girl who's popping popcorn in=20
preparation for watching a video.  The phone rings, and there's a=20
mysterious voice on the other end.  He asks her what her favorite scary=20
movie is, and she replies that it's HALLOWEEN.  He then invites her to=20
play a game, but she gets freaked out and hangs up.  When he calls again=20
and she demands to know what he wants, his response is simple and=20
succinct:  "To see your insides."  The cat-and-mouse game continues=20
until both Casey and her boyfriend (who has the misfortune to stop by)=20
are gutted like fish.</P>
<P>     This double murder is only the beginning, however.  It appears that=20
the killer's real target is Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell, from TV's=20
PARTY OF FIVE), a high school girl with a troubled past.  One year ago,=20
Sidney's mother was raped and murdered in a highly-publicized case. =20
Now, when Sidney is attacked by someone wearing a Grim Reaper mask and=20
her boyfriend, Billy (Skeet Ulrich), is arrested, her life is turned=20
upside down.  From the bathrooms at school to a friend's house, the=20
stalking continues.  Meanwhile, an aggressive tabloid reporter=20
(Courteney Cox) begins harassing Sidney for a story. =20</P>
<P>     SCREAM never stops poking fun at itself.  Craven and screenwriter=20
Kevin Williamson allow their characters to make all sorts of disparaging=20
remarks about the horror movie cliches they're living (and dying)=20
through.  In describing why she doesn't like slasher flicks, Sidney=20
claims that "they're all the same=85 Some big-breasted blond who can't=20
act" does stupid things.  Another character, a video junkie (Jamie=20
Kennedy), describes all the gory, real-life events as "standard, horror=20
movie stuff=85 There's a formula to it -- a very simple formula."  Then,=20
as a group gathers to watch HALLOWEEN on TV, this same guy recites the=20
three rules of surviving a horror movie:  never have sex, never drink or=20
do drugs, and never say "I'll be right back." =20</P>
<P>     The most obvious and inventive parody in SCREAM involves a direct=20
takeoff of the killer-stalking-Jamie Lee Curtis-through-the-house=20
sequence from HALLOWEEN.  While that scene is playing on a TV, similar=20
events are happening in the very room where the TV sits.  In fact, as=20
Michael Myers is approaching Curtis' character from behind, the death-
masked killer is sneaking up on the guy watching the video, who is=20
screaming at the TV, "Look behind you!"  Since he's so knowledgeable=20
about the genre, he should consider heeding his own advice.</P>
<P>     The director doesn't do everything right.  The film's self-parody=20
aspects are sometimes too cute, and there are occasions when they dilute=20
attempts at shocks and suspense.  There are also a few too many twists=20
and turns in the script, and the ending is unnecessarily protracted.  In=20
general, SCREAM probably could have benefited from a little more=20
tightening up during either the scripting or the editing stage.</P>
<P>     Some of the casting choices are unusual.  Most of the major roles=20
go to fresh faces.  Neve Campbell, who doesn't have much feature=20
experience, finds the right tone for her character, allowing Sidney to=20
be a little tougher than the typical damsel in distress.  Courtney Cox,=20
on the other hand, is never believable as the tough-as-nails, career-
obsessed reporter.  Drew Barrymore and Henry Winkler (a.k.a. The Fonz,=20
as a high school principal) have cameos (Winkler's is uncredited).</P>
<P>     Craven couldn't have made this movie if he didn't understand both=20
his craft and what his fans expect.  Of all the mainstream horror=20
directors, he has been the one most willing to take chances.  In some=20
ways, SCREAM is an extension of WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE, which also=20
blurred the lines between motion pictures and real life.  This is a=20
horror film designed with movie-lovers in mind.  Beneath all the gore=20
and violence (and there's a lot of both), there's a keen sense of wit=20
and intelligence which sophisticated viewers are likely to appreciate. =20
And that makes this much more than a common slasher flick.  Have fun,=20
and remember that "movies don't create psychos; movies make psychos more=20
creative."</P>
