                               Trees Lounge (1996)
                        A film review by Christopher Null
                         Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Get this tagline for TREES LOUNGE:  "A story about one man's
search... for who knows what."  That could describe quite well
writer/director/star Steve Buscemi during his creation of this film, a
quirky and melodramatic tragicomedy about... who knows what.</P>
<P>     Buscemi plays Tommy, a regular guy in Long Island whose life is
basically a series of alcoholic binges, sprinkled with failed love
affairs, cheap drugs, and terminal unemployment.  A parade of supporting
characters (all played by Buscemi's personal friends) run in and out of
his life, and everyone tries to make some sense of it all.</P>
<P>     The Trees Lounge is the unfortunately-named bar where Tommy spends
virtually all of his time.  It's the kind of joint where a guy can walk
into one night and come back out 20 years later, wondering where his
life went.  It's the kind of place you can almost smell -- or maybe that
was just the movie theater's goo-encrusted floor.</P>
<P>     I get the feeling that TREES LOUNGE is the movie that all
filmmakers are secretly dying to make -- a personal portrait of simple
life, nothing but depression all the way.  The reason this kind of movie
doesn't get made more often is because (1) no studio in their right mind
would let someone do such a thing [case in point: TREES LOUNGE is being
released by the only-recently-out-of-bankruptcy Orion Pictures], and (2)
when you get down to brass tacks, not many people *really* want to make
a movie about someone that's more pathetic than they are.</P>
<P>     Still, I've got to admire Buscemi for doing it anyway.  Buscemi has
complained in interviews about having trouble writing the script for
TREES LOUNGE, and it shows, but at least he doesn't let the self-pity
get too thick, applying liberal doses of comedy to counter the tragic
underscore of the film.  Overall, he ends up with a picture that isn't
half bad, but which just doesn't make for a light matinee and
*certainly* isn't "fun for the whole family."</P>
<P>     As a director, Buscemi isn't awful, but he isn't great.  As far as
his casting choices, they're fine, except for his breaking of the
cardinal rule that Daniel Baldwin should never be allowed to be in a
movie.  Chloe Sevigny (KIDS) is a fun Lolita, and minor roles like
Bronson Dudley's eternal barfly are a scream, and they really show
Buscemi's knack for comedy.  Let's hope he explores this a little more
in his next offering.</P>
<P>     P.S.  Be sure to watch for the cameo by the faux-Reservoir Dogs
(it's in the first five minutes).</P>
