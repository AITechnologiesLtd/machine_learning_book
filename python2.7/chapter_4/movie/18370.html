<P>  As the song goes, "When I'm not near/ The girl I love/ I love
the girl I'm near."  Love is so wonderfully irrational.  Who but
an accountant would have it any other way?  Shakespeare
took advantage of love's illogical, nay demented, nature, in
fashioning a fable that--take away the sylvan background and
the eye-popping changes wrought by extra-natural
elements--could take place right in the heart of Times Square
on New Year's Eve.  Shakespeare, known for his unusually
perceptive insights into human nature as well as his
impossibly lyrical utterances, knew that reason and love do
not often keep good company. And so he had no problem
arranging for a beautiful fairy queen to fall hopelessly in love
with an ass.  Next time you see a strange-looking couple on
the street and wonder, "What could she possibly see in him?"
remember that the most ravishing femme fatale just might
find a guy with donkey ears and an eccentric nature more
exciting than an army of bean counters hunched over their
desks at Broderick & Company CPA PC.</P>
<P>   In keeping with the festive mood of Midsummer Night which
is celebrated in England on June 23, Shakespeare offers not
one story of a pair of star-crossed lovers as he did with
"Romeo and Juliet" but looks into comic possibilities of a
similar situation involving five sets of ill-sorted lovers.  The
very multiplicity gives the play comic overtones.  "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" opens during the four seemingly
endless days before Theseus, Duke of Athens, would wed
Hippolyta (whom he won in battle).  She is not so eager. 
Demetrius and Lysander love Hermia.  Helena, who loves
Demetrius, is lusted after by no one.  Oberon and Titania, the
fairy king and queen, have separated.  In a play-within-the-
play, Pyramus and Thisbe are divided by the mutual dislike of
their parents.  Despite the seemingly insurmountable
difficulties that love brings to us all, Shakespeare is
determined to show that everything gets sorted out.  Love
works.  Love can put an ass's head on anyone.  Has this,
dear reader, ever happened to you?  As for logic, well,
"Midsummer" sets before us people who are equals in class
and wealth, its men and women about equal in height.  What
makes one man fall in love with one woman, ignoring all
others?  </P>
<P>   The action unfolds at night, when reason gives way to
dreams, and by daybreak we will see how "the lunatic, the
lover and the poet/ Are of imagination all compact."</P>
<P>   Shakespeare is coy about giving specific instructions and
set designs to the people who are to direct his works, leaving
(in this case) Michael Hoffman to tinker as he will with the
natural background, the order and length of the scenes, even
the century.  He chooses to update "Midsummer" from 16th
Century Athens to the Tuscany region of Italy in the late 19th
Century, when bicycles were first coming into their own as a
new invention.  For his score, he freely employs operatic
sections from Bellini's "Norman," from Verdi's "La Traviata,"
and the traditional background music of Mendelssohn--as well
as a brand-new orchestration from Simon Boswell.  The lush
film--the most expensive work to date by Fox Searchlight
Pictures--opens as Duke Theseus (David Strathairn) prepares
for his wedding to the reluctant Hippolyta (Sophie Marceau). 
During the days prior to the nuptials, the Duke holds court
listening to a complaint from the starchy old Egeus (Bernard
Hill).  Egeus, for reason wholly arbitrary, insists that his
daughter Hermia (Anna Friel) marry Demetrius (Christian
Bale) rather than the dashing Lysander (Dominic West) whom
she loves. The lovers plan to elope into the woods using their
newly-invented bicycles.  Meanwhile the lovelorn Helena
(Calistra Flockhart) follows the man of her dreams,
Demetrius, like a spaniel, masochistically insisting that the
more he scorns her, the more she will love him.</P>
<P>   At the same time a group of amateur actors head for the
woods looking for a space to rehearse the play "The Most
Lamentable Comedy, the Cruel Death of Pyramus and
Thisbe," under the direction of the Peter Quince (played by
an almost unrecognizable Roger Rees).  As all converge,
they are watched by the woodland fairies, particularly the
mischievous Robin Goodfellow, or Puck (Stanley Tucci), the
fairy king, Oberon (Rupert Everett), and his estranged queen
Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer).  Puck sprinkles drops from a flower
into the eyes of some of the sleeping mortals and the
slumbering fairy queen, causing each to fall in love with the
first person he or she sees upon awakening.  The mixup that
results is the source of most of the comedy.</P>
<P>   For reasons known principally to the adapter-director,
Michael Hoffman, the company of thesps is a mixed one. 
British, American and French performers get together leaving
the audience to judge which nationality can do the
Shakespeare best.  Surprisingly the Americans outdo the
British in most junctures, the one major exception being the
American David Strathairn, so adept in quirky roles such as
those directed by John Sayles ("The Return of the Secaucus
Seven").  Here he is overly stiff appearing uncomfortable as
though intimidated open himself for judgment "as a
Shakespearean actor."  Nor does Michele Pfeiffer, for all her
beauty, look alive in the role of the fairy queen or exhibit the
slightest chemistry with Rupert Everett.  Kevin Kline runs
away with the show (surprise!) as Bottom the Weaver, who is
transformed into an ass (see above note about how most of
us lovers are likewise converted).  Capturing the screen as
an obvious ham, he debates his role as Pyramus with the
theater company's manager so vivaciously that we wonder
whether Mr. Hoffman was spared similar domination.  He
clowns furiously when afforded his donkey's ears and yet at
key points allows us to look into the pathos that has
enveloped the man who has been so changed by love. 
Stanley Tucci, known by lovers of art movies for his hilarious
job as a nervous chef in the wonderful "The Big Night" easily 
becomes the movie's center, its impresario, as he sprinkles
love's potion indiscriminately and then sits back with a smirk
on his face to judge humankind: "Lord, what fools these
mortals be!"  </P>
<P>   Oliver Stapleton's camera conveys the mysterious sylvan
atmosphere of the woods, though he could have done more
with the Tuscan town that forms the urban backdrop of the
story.  When you consider that the only special effects
employed by Hoffman are the donkey's ears set upon Kevin
Kline, you may agree that this interpretation of "A Midsummer
Night's Dream," surprisingly only the second major studio
presentation of the great comedy (the first being the Warner
Bros. 1935 version with James Cagney, Dick Powell, Olivia
de Havilland and Joe E. Brown), is a vivid one indeed.  </P>
<P>   What you come away with is a graphic illustration of the
lunacy of lovers and yet another production that has us
thinking about the nature of illusion and reality.  Were the
proceedings of the humans and fairies in the forest an actual
occurrence or simply the lovers' dream?  Was Bottom really
converted into an ass, or did he simply dream about his own
subconscious view of himself as, at base, a donkey?  We sit
in our seats in the darkened theater, knowing full well that
everything on the screen really happened. Or did it?  As
Prospero will say later on in "The Tempest," "We are such
stuff/ As dreams are made on, and our little life/ Is rounded
with a sleep."  Despite the inadequacy of a handful of actors
in this "Midsummer," the movie comes awfully close to being
a dream production.  </P>
