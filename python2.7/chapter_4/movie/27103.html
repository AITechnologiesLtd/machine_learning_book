<PRE>DISNEY'S THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE (2000)
Reviewed by John Sylva</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: B+</PRE>
<P>Director Mark Dindal (Cat's Don't Dance) and the animation gurus at Disney 
bring us the holiday entry of The Emperor's New Groove, which is, simply put, 
the best animated film in years. Groove succeeds where Disney films as of 
late have not: Its emphasis is on character development and storyline, rather 
than the appearance of the animation itself.  Unlike 1999's Tarzan and this 
past summer's Dinosaur, Disney's The Emperor's New Groove holds the potential 
to go down as one of Disney's more accomplished films and possibly come to be 
considered an animated classic.  </P>
<P>David Spade brings his sarcastic antics to the film's central character,  the 
self-absorbed, selfish, Emperor Kuzco, who we're told by a poor old man (who 
fell victim to his Emperor's harsh ways) has a "groove," the way in which 
everything in his self-indulgent world works.  Kuzco has recently fired the 
wicked Yzma (voiced by Eartha Kitt), who, in return, along with her ignorant 
right-hand man Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton), vows to seek sweet 
revenge.  But Yzma's original hope to poision the Emperor's drink at dinner 
takes an unpredictable turn when Kronk accidentally replaces the poision with 
a potion, and as a result the Emperor is magically transformed into a llama.  
Meanwhile, the llama-herding Pacha (voiced by John Goodman), who previously 
was informed by the Emperor that his hilltop village would be demolished and 
replaced with his summer resort, unknowingly brings the llama/emperor home 
when Kronk idiotically misplaces the bag in which the transformed Kuzco is 
unconscious.  From here, Pacha and Kuzco form an unlikely, unpredictable, and 
unsteady friendship as Pacha agrees to take Kuzco back to the palace, but 
only under one condition: The Emperor must build his summer resort elsewhere. 
 But all does not go smoothly-Kuzco has not yet been cured of his 
snobbishness, and Yzma will not relent in her hope to have the Emperor 
killed.  </P>
<P>Jonathan Roberts and David Reynolds pen The Emperor's New Groove full of wit, 
intelligence, and a sophisticated yet simple storyline with plenty of twists 
and turns to keep the action rolling onscreen.  The morals and lessons 
Roberts and Reynolds fill Groove with are certainly nothing we haven't seen 
before, but for parents looking for a film that will entertain their children 
and quite possibly teach them a lesson or two in friendship and in life, the 
film is more than adequate.    </P>
<P>John Goodman's vocals make for a warm and affectionate protagonist, David 
Spade cleverly shapes his character much like the stereotype a fan of Spade 
would associate the comedic actor with, Patrick Warburton brings big laughs 
to his dumbbell of a character, and Eartha Kitt is sharp and biting as Yzma, 
making for an easily despicable, fun villainess. </P>
<P>The animation's smooth, vivid colors highlight the vast and majestic 
settings, effectively setting the lively onscreen mood.  </P>
<P>Containing enough gags to hold the interest of younger children, presenting 
numerous pop culture references that will humor teenagers, and holding plenty 
of tongue-in-cheek comedy at which parents will laugh but find zooming right 
over their children's heads, Groove has something to offer to all ages.  The 
film's only shortcoming is: With a swift running time of 75 minutes 
(obviously to suit the short attention span of younger audiences), it all 
ends too soon. </P>
<P>THE BOTTOM LINE: With the impressive Emperor's New Groove, Disney shows that 
after a long hiatus, it truly does have its groove back. </P>
