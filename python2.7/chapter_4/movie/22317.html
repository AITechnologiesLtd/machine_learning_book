<P>   On any given Sunday during the football season, millions
of American men will gather with their friends around the
projection TV to watch their favorite gladiators get
pummeled while their wives (by way of revenge) conspire
to haul them to a screening of "Tumbleweeds."  Picture the
women gathering in the kitchen to play cards, asking one
another, "Just what is it that these guys see in that game?" 
Who better to answer that question than Oliver Stone, the
53-year-old helmer who has made a career of charged, male-
centered films, most being personal dramas and explorations
of violence in the United States?  If he tackled the varieties of
corruption in a nearby land in his movie "Salvador," darned if
he didn't do the same with iniquity in his own nation. 
Perhaps the Oliver Stone movie thematically closest to his
new all-star blockbuster "Any Given Sunday," is his "Wall
Street," which both lionized and condemned the 1980s
passion for greed.  With this contemporary take of pro
football, Stone both exalts the game and the people
responsible for putting together one of our national pastimes,
and castigates those who have turned it into a business--its
players more concerned about personal glory, contracts for
commercials, and the elevation of individual fulfillment over
team playing.</P>
<P>   This time, instead of the foxholes of "Platoon" he gives us
the furrows of the football stadium.  Where he could have
made a smashing, intelligent person's "Waterboy," giving us
the inside scoop on the game and business of this great
national sport, he goes overboard with garish camerawork,
giving credence to the statement, "If the technology exists, it
will be used."  Though he shows respect for his audience by
trusting us to sit still for two and three-quarters hours, you'd
swear that Stone has been taken in by arguments that the
American moviegoers are all part of the channel-surfing MTV
generation, unable to focus on one scene for more than a
minute at a time.  He does indeed show us what goes on
while the 80,000 spectators at a major game are munching
their hot dogs and ogling the cheerleaders by cutting to the
managers' area to eavesdrop on the conversations of the
money people--and by cutting to just about anything else that
can show off his photographic technique.  Otherwise, we
don't get to see more than two or three plays at a time. Why
not simply use some of the generous 165 minutes he has
been alloted to spend some real time on an extended series
of plays?  This could get us more involved in the chessboard
strategies of the contest so that those not so familiar with
football can gain a respect for the brainwork involved in
staging complex strategies.</P>
<P>   What, then, do we see and hear?  Frequently, the sound
system goes silent for a moment, then turns up to full volume
as you hear the crunch of the men which inevitably follows
the snapping of the pigskin.  The athletes look fierce enough
under their helmets, not unlike Robocop, so ferocious that
you can believe they can kill you with a look or shame you
with an obscene gesture or comment.  After a while, though,
our eyes glaze over as we get yet another close-up of these
contemporary combatants, their eye shadow boldly standing
out, their head gear rock solid and yet not invulnerable to the
crush of the predators.  Crunch, scrunch, mash, whiz, run,
pass, fumble, leap.  Stone sees the action as a rough,
macho, modern ballet.  Little feels human in the story and, in
fact, an awful lot of the characters both on and off the field
lack any semblance of compassion.  </P>
<P>   The principal conflict appears to be between the seasoned
coach of the Miami Sharks, Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino) and
the co-owner of the team who inherited the job from her
father, Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz).  Pagniacci is
depicted as a take-no-prisoners woman, unlike her dad,
interested only in winning and in gaining the funding needed
to build a new and grander stadium for the Sharks.  In other
words, she wants to be taken seriously as a woman playing
essentially a man's game.  She does battle against the
coach's ideal that what counts is teamwork, not personal
glory.  When D'Amato's third-string quarterback, Willie
Beaman (Jamie Foxx), is called off the bench after hard hits
knock out the 39-year-old first stringer, Cap Rooney (Dennis
Quaid) and the second-stringer, the conflict is drawn. 
Beaman, unlike Rooney, is in the game for the glory, for the
perks like contracts for commercials, for the women. 
D'Amato is in the game for the game.  Can the coach
convince this man, who turns out to be his best player, to
rethink his priorities?</P>
<P>   Employing a script he developed with John Logan, Oliver
Stone divides his ensemble into two groups.  Dr. Harvey
Mandrake (James Woods), an orthopedist willing to send the
butchered gladiators back into the field conflicts with another
physician, Dr. Allie Powers (Matthew Modine), who opts for
keeping them alive.  Vanessa Struthers (Lela Rochon),
Beaman's girl friend who likes the man but has no love for
football, has different ideas from Cap Rooney's wife Cindy
(Lauren Holly), who, incredibly, slaps her man hard for
wanting to give up the game, caring not a whit that the 39-
year-old is pretty-much battered and washed up.</P>
<P>   As  Salvatore Totino's camera runs up and down the field,
into the sheltered box seats of the champagne-drinking suits,
over to the abrasive sports announcer Jack Rose (John C.
McGinley), and, still hungry for more switches to black-and-
white for shots from Coach D'Amato's past--including Vince
Lombardi--the audience cannot be blamed for wondering
whether Oliver Stone is not unlike Christina Pagniacci.  He's
in this for the business of pretentious moviemaking and not
for the love of the game.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 165 minutes.  (C) 1999
