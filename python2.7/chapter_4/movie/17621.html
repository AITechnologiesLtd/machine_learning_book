<P>I can understand why Hollywood remakes popular films of yesteryear, but
1970's The Out-of-Towners, starring Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, is not
liked by a lot of people.  I always thought that it was a good film and
even keep a copy of it in my permanent video library, but even I would
not have picked it to alter.</P>
<P>Since the original film was a precursor to the superior Planes, Trains &
Automobiles, why not get Steve Martin to play the male lead?  I've got
no problem with that (except they changed his name from `George' to
`Henry'), but Goldie Hawn?  At what point did she turn into Carol
Channing?  Plus, the best part about the original was Dennis' repeatedly
whining her husband's name over and over and over again.  Hawn spends
too much time trying to be a sexpot.  Goldie, you're sixty.  Give it up.</P>
<P>Martin and Hawn (Housesitter) play Henry and Nancy Clark, two suburban
Ohio parents that have just herded their last child out the door and
find themselves alone, in an empty house, with nothing to do but bicker.
Nancy is unaware of the importance of Henry's upcoming job interview in
New York City, because he has recently been fired but hasn't had the
guts to tell his wife.  The trip, of course, is a disaster.  They end up
in Boston when New York is fogged in, they miss a train, they rent a
car, they get mugged, and so on and so on.  They also make the mistake
of skipping the airline meal and then stagger through the rest of the
film hungry.  Now that's humor!</P>
<P>If it weren't for Martin, The Out-of-Towners would be pretty unbearable,
and John Cleese (Monty Python) adds some laughs as an uptight hotel
manager.  When the picture ended (predictably at the 90-minute mark),
this old guy sitting next to me hoped aloud that they would show
outtakes during the credits.  I pointed out to him that we been watching
them for the last 90 minutes.  (1:33 – PG-13 for some mild language and
Hawn in low-cut lingerie…Oh, my God – I'm blind!)</P>
