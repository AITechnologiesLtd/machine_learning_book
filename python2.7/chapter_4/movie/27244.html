<P>I wanted to hate Faithless.  I wanted to hate it so much that I'd leave
after 15 minutes and save the two-plus hours for something that sounded
more enjoyable than a slow-moving Swedish film about marital
infidelity.  You know, like picking out drapes, or giving my cat a bath,
or volunteering to be a mall Santa.</P>
<P>But Faithless turned out to be anything but a bore.  The film, which was
nominated for Best Picture and Best Actress at the European Film Awards,
did more than hold my interest – it shook me to my very core with a
riveting and, at times, horrifying portrayal of the effect infidelity
can have on a close-knit group of people.</P>
<P>The film begins with an old man (Erland Josephson) sitting down at desk
in a room that overlooks the sea.  He opens his notebook to begin
writing a story and, literally, creates a main character out of thin
air.  Her name is Marianne (Lena Endre), and she's a happily married
actress with a beautiful nine-year-old daughter.  The old man asks
Marianne questions about her life and, as she answers, he jots down her
responses as his story begins to take shape.</P>
<P>Despite having a great career, a loving husband and child, and a
beautiful home, Marianne plans an affair with David (Krister
Henriksson), her director and close friend of the family.  Their fling,
set to take place over a three-week period in Paris, is supposed to be
temporary, with neither party having to worry about sneaking around or,
theoretically, jealousy.  Things don't go as planned, of course, and
their affair follows them home to Sweden, where Marianne's husband
Markus (Thomas Hanzon) finds out, kicking off a series of ugly events
and a bitter custody battle over little Isabelle (Michelle Gylemo).</P>
<P>As Marianne slowly reveals the story to the old man, he looks stunned
and appalled by the actions of his own creation.  But, like a shrink, he
continues to ask her questions in an attempt to get Marianne to finish
her tragic tale.  And her emotional account is far from predictable,
too, often causing the old man to seem on the brink of tears.</P>
<P>It should come as no surprise that Faithless was written by nine-time
Academy Award nominee Ingmar Bergman, who is certainly no stranger to
films showcasing the tragic failure of a marriage.  Bergman's long-time
collaborator Liv Ullmann (a double Oscar nominee for acting) directed
the mesmerizing film, which is full of wonderful performances from the
five main characters.  Erland Josephson, one of the original players
from Bergman's acting company, plays the old man – a role obviously
meant to be Bergman.  Ironically, Josephson has played several
Bergman-esque characters over the years.</P>
<P>2:35 – adult language, nudity and strong sexual content</P>
