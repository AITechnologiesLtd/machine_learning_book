<PRE>PLEASANTVILLE (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: Gary Ross
Starring: Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Joan Allen, William H. Macy,
Jeff Daniels, J.T. Walsh, Don Knotts, Paul Walker, Marley Shelton,
Marisa Ribisi, Jane Kaczmarek</P>
<P>"Pleasantville" is an amazing film, and it's incredibly philosophical
about life and all, but there's a couple things people have been looking
over.  They watch this film and they see that it deals with the complex
subject of change and looking strangely at the 50s ideal American Dream
of suburbia where everyone's happy and live without fear of conflict,
and although they think that the reason it's such a great film is
because it's philosophical, they're glossing over something else that's
there.  There always has to be something more than just philosophy to
make a piece of art great, even if what you're looking at is
Dostoevsky.  Reading "Crime and Punishment" is not a great read because
it expertly undlies humanity, but because it's a damn tense read that
shocks us with its major insights.</P>
<P>The makers of "Plesantville" have come up with a gimmick that is truly
ingenius.  As, the characters in this film go through major changes in
the way they see life, they change from black and white to color.  This
is the reason this film is great.  Director and writer Gary Ross has
found a way to convey not only the fact that they're changing but what
they're feeling like and what it must be like to everyone else in one
simple technique that to the audience is completely cinematic and
jaw-dropping.  Seeing the first red rose amongst a patch of otherwise
black and white flowers is nearly orgasmic.</P>
<P>"Pleasantville" is a simple film, filled with not only this gimmick, but
another one more that is commonly known as the "Fish Out of Water"
movie, and despite some clumsiness in this set-up, "Pleasantville" may
go down in cinema history as the best "Fish Out of Water" movie since
"Being There."  It deals with two modern-day teenage siblings, David and
Jennifer (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon, respectively) - he's a
loser hermit who watches an old black and white 50s show called
"Pleasantville" with a passion; she's a cynical, slutty connioseur of
MTV and the like.  One night, when she has a date to watch a concert on
TV and he wants to watch the 24-hour "Pleasantville" marathon, they have
a fight over the remote control and break it.  A sinister-looking TV
repairman (played by none other than Don Knotts) shows up, gives them a
new remote, and when fighting over that one, they suddenly get sucked
into "Pleasantville."</P>
<P>Now, I don't know if anyone remembers the ill-fated sitcom from the
early 90s, "Honey, I'm Home" (where they imported a family from the 50s
and put them in the cynical 90s), but even if you do, don't worry
because after about 10 minutes, these two take off in different
directions.  Instead of staying with the overdone gimmick of "They're
from the 90s and now in the 50s!  How about that?!," which features
David and Jennifer trying to fit in at home (the parents are played to
perfection by William H. Macy and Joan Allen) and at school, and
discovering all the annoyances of living in perfection (they quickly
discovers nothing burns, it never rains, the fireman don't know what a
fire is, and there's not bathroom in those stalls), it instead takes off
questioning everything that has been put before them.</P>
<P>Starting with Jennifer teaching the captain of the basketball team (Paul
Walker) what should be done at Lover's Lane, a chain reaction is started
where most people learn about what else there is in life, and when they
do, they turn into color, while everything else is in black and white.
This actually robs the film of any real subtlety about its message,
making everything incredibly obvious, but it makes up for this in two
ways: 1) the gimmick of people changing never becomes tiresome, and is
always handled with originality and emotion; and 2) it actually adds on
top of that some real complications.</P>
<P>The world of "Pleasantville" is happy, and perpetually so, and only
changes when one person who has seen the difference and dislikes it
enough to do something about it.  But is it really a good thing that
these people changed, and complicated everything?  Wouldn't it be better
if everything was at peace and there was nothing wrong ever?  Gary Ross
says no, and the rest of this film is his argument.  Isn't the fact that
there are conflicts and suffering and the chance for happiness much
better than actual happiness?  Isn't the great thing about life that
things will not stay the same for any real length of time, and that you
always have to get used to living with something else?</P>
<P>The fact that Gary Ross explores all these angles is incredible, since
most films follow through on their subjects just so they can prove their
points.  "Pleasantville" shows the modern-day as cynical and
pessimistic, with chances of things only becoming worse.  The 50s, when
everything was seemingly perfect, is shown as the opposite of that, and
should theoretically be the ideal place to live in.  The changes, when
they happen, only bring out pain and suffering, resulting in a darker
second half, where the black and whites end up in a war against the
"colors," and book burning, prejudices, and social upheveal take hold.
But Ross says this is all worth it, just because when you suffer, you
finally see how free and grand life really is.</P>
<P>For this philosophical argument, I commend it, but that's really not why
it's great.  Sure, it says that life is worth living, but I'm much more
interested in the way this all comes about than rather what it says.
For me, "Plesantville" is worth multiple viewings just for those moments
when the colors pop up amidst the black and white photography.  I love
those moments when little things are color while the rest are still the
same.  And when instead of safe 50s ballads, Dave Brubeck and Miles
Davis creep onto the soundtrack.  And when the pages of the normally
blank books in the library fill up with words before our eyes.  There's
an intensely touching moment when the mother has learned about sex and
has turned to color, and asks David in confidence to put makeup on her
to hide up her transformation, and another moment that's nearly erotic
when the makeup is slowly taken off by someone else.  And my favorite
moment, when David and his new girlfriend drive from the black and white
road into Lover's Lane, where everything's vibrant colors, and then
later it rains for the first time.</P>
<P>Gary Ross has assembled an incredible cast of actors who aren't so
well-known but are all immensely talented, and everyone gives an
incredible performance, but there are some real standouts.  Tobey
Maguire is effortlessly lovable in the lead, as he always is, and Reese
Witherspoon is hysterical as the cynic who learns about real passion
from a D.H. Lawrence book (as we all did).  William H. Macy brings real
emotion and depth to his character, especially in the final moments of
the film, and Jeff Daniels, as the local sodajerk, comes off as sweet
and charmingly innocent.  In his final performance, J.T. Walsh
demonstrates exactly why he was great: because he was eerily prickly the
only he could be.  Joan Allen, though, looks like the one who would get
the Oscar nomination out of the lot.  She brings true emotion and
creativity to her role of the housewife who learns about passion early
on, and tries her best to deal with it, demonstrating that she may
possibly be the greatest actress in her age demographic working today.</P>
<P>But will anyone see it as nothing but a philosophical film, and an
unsubtle one at that?  I hope not, because it's one of those films that
is endlessly inventive and truly magical, in the tradition of the best
films of Frank Capra and even Victor Fleming (although some are
comparing it to "Back to the Future," it almost has as much magic as,
say, "The Wizard of Oz").  In years, people may reflect on this as the
film they nearly misunderstood for its greatness, but right now, it's
one of the best films to come out this year, just on the strength of how
happy it can make even the most pessimistic of the lot, and how it can
make the future look optimistic for a change.</P>
