<PRE>THE SHINING (1980)</PRE>
<PRE>        "Places are like people: some shine and some don't."</PRE>
<PRE>        4 out of ****</PRE>
<PRE>        Starring Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd
        Directed by Stanley Kubrick
        Written by Kubrick and Diane Johnson, from the novel by Stephen King
        Cinematography by John Alcott</PRE>
<P>There is only one character in Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING, and it 
is not a person.  It is the Overlook Hotel, a remote Colorado resort 
that closes during the winter, because no one can reach it through the 
snowbound mountains.  During this season, it is empty, save for the 
caretaker and his family.  An empty hotel is an eerie place; without 
the bustle of guests and bellhops and receptionists, it becomes a 
still, silent place.  Too still, too silent.  It is a place where 
something is waiting to happen--and if it doesn't happen, the hotel 
will drag ghosts out of the past to make it happen.</P>
<P>Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is the caretaker this particular 
winter, with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny 
Lloyd) joining him.  Jack claims to be a writer, and looks forward to 
the solitude which will give him a chance to work on a new project.  
He isn't concerned that a previous caretaker, presumed to be suffering 
an extreme case of cabin fever, killed his wife and twin daughters, 
then took his own life.  We know better.</P>
<P>Based on what we see of him, Jack can't be a very good writer; he 
possesses no wit, no charm, no originality.  He is a void waiting for 
a personality to fill him.  Eventually, it does--giving Nicholson the 
opportunity to perform some of his most famous scenes, and he performs 
them gleefully.  He takes the menace and madness that lurk in the 
corners of the Overlook and embodies them in one man; it is a great 
performance, just as the Overlook is a triumph of production design.</P>
<P>Nicholson manages to take something trite and boring and make it 
skewed and unnerving--and this is what the film as a whole does.  
Stephen King famously criticized Kubrick's adaptation of his novel, 
but Kubrick at least did justice to one of King's strengths as a 
writer: his ability to take the mundane, the trivial, and make it a 
locus of terror.  The dialogue and the people in THE SHINING are 
terribly banal.  Remove the style, and all the interactions--a job 
interview, a father-son conversation, a tour of the hotel, etc.--would 
be stupefingly dull and clichéd.</P>
<P>But the film is never boring; it is compelling and disturbing.  
Kubrick uses formal, strikingly symmetrical visual compositions for 
even the most routine actions and conversations, and he also avoids 
close-ups as much as possible, so that what we see, we see from a 
distance, and what we see are everyday actions presented in an 
artificial, stylized manner.  This incongruity generates a sense of 
unease, an unease which pervades every shot.   We know something will 
go horribly wrong; it's just a matter of when and how.</P>
<P>The genius of the film is in the details.  It is in the way Kubrick 
shows Danny riding around the hotel hallways on his go-cart, shooting 
from a low angle so that the large, silent passages seem even larger, 
even more silent, and very ominous, as they loom high over Danny's 
head.  It is in the way he has Danny--using the unnatural voice of 
Tony, the "friend" who lives in his mouth--say "red rum" over and over 
again, the pitch rising at a key dramatic moment.  It is in the way we 
are shown a brief glimpse through a bedroom door, late in the film, of 
two mysterious characters, hinting at further secrets somewhere in the 
hotel's dark history.</P>
<P>There is never a moment when Kubrick--with help from cinematographer 
John Alcott, production designer Roy Walker, and a seriously 
unsettling score--does not seem to be utterly sure of himself.  The 
movie is a showcase for his talent; I am reluctant to attach any 
deeper significance, because none is needed.  Yes, Jack is a 
recovering alcholic; yes, there are intimations of abuse and 
dysfunction; yes, the movie insinuates that on a deeper level, it may 
be "about" those issues--but, fundamentally, I think to look for those 
meanings misses the point.</P>
<P>THE SHINING wants to frighten us, to induce a pleasurable frisson of 
terror, and to impress us with its craftsmanship.  If it's "about" 
anything, it's about cameras moving slowly and sinisterly down empty 
hallways; abrupt images of silent, solemn twin girls; a frantic chase 
through a snow-covered hedge maze.  It's about style, and it knows 
that subject as well as any movie ever made.</P>
