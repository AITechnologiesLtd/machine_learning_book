PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></PRE>
<P>David Fincher's (The Game) latest film begins at the end - in a
high-rise office building where protagonist and narrator Jack (Edward
Norton, American History X) is asked, with a pistol jammed into his
mouth, if he has any last words.  The gunman is Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt,
Meet Joe Black), who explains to Jack that he has planted explosives in
several nearby buildings with the intent of leveling several city
blocks.  We know this is the end of the film, and Jack's story is
revealed through his nightmarish narrative flashback.</P>
<P>There is a reason we never learn Jack's name; he's supposed to represent
an anonymous 30-year-old single white professional male - the kind that
is slowly realizing that they have no purpose in life, other than
toiling away in a white-button-down-shirt job all day and watching
sitcoms from the comfort of their IKEA couch at night.  They are the
middle generation – raised by women and without either a Great War or a
Great Depression.  Their great depression is existence.</P>
<P>Once Jack takes us to the beginning of his tale, we learn that he works
for a major automobile manufacturer, investigating accidents caused by
faulty design to determine whether a recall would be cost effective for
the company.  He also suffers from insomnia, a condition that his doctor
refuses to cure via prescription medication.  The doctor suggests
depressed Jack get more exercise and tells him to cheer up, implying
that he check out a support group at St. Christopher's Church to see the
real misery of the human condition.</P>
<P>The support group is for men that have been gelded due to testicular
cancer.  Jack is paired up with Robert Paulsen (Meat Loaf, Black Dog) a
giant man with giant `bitch-tits' as a result of female hormone
treatments.  After a weepy Robert pours his heart out to him, Jack gets
the best night of sleep he's had in months.  As a result, Jack becomes
somewhat of a support-group junkie, attending meetings for victims of
tuberculosis, sickle-cell anemia and melanoma, among other afflictions.</P>
<P>After a year of touring the anguish and sorrow circuit, Jack meets two
people that will change his life forever.  One is Marla Singer (Helena
Bonham Carter, Theory of Flight), a suicidal woman he notices at all of
the support group meetings.  The second is Tyler, a soap salesman with
extensive knowledge in explosives that Jack meets on an airplane.
Because of a fire in his condo, Jack takes up residence with Tyler, who
lives in an immense dilapidated house in an abandoned part of the city.</P>
<P>As Jack and Tyler bond, they discover that pummeling each other is a
great therapeutic way to unload all of the pressure of being young white
men.  They regularly hold fistfights each Saturday outside a dive bar
called Lou's Tavern and soon are joined by other disillusioned young
white men.  Eventually, the `Fight Club' moves into the dirt-floored
basement of Lou's Tavern and is subjected to several rules (you probably
already know the first one).</P>
<P>While Jack is thrilled at the idea of Fight Club and all it represents,
he suspects Tyler of deviant ulterior motives.  Just who is Tyler Durden
and why do all of these complete strangers seem to become his disciples
so quickly?  How did he manage to score Marla as a sex partner?  Jack
also learns that Fight Club is open on nights other than Saturday and
has heard rumors that Durden has opened branches in other cities, as
well.</P>
<P>As their relationship fizzles, so does Jack's remaining semblance of a
life.  He comes to work disheveled, bloodied and without a tie.  He
fantasizes about Marla and he grows increasingly suspicious of Tyler's
nihilistic and mysterious goals of `freeing' men from the drudgery of
their lives.</P>
<P>Fight Club is one heck of a brutally graphic film.  Visually, it's
amazing, with Fincher pulling no punches in creating the gritty
underworld of indifferent men.  The story is based on Chuck Palahniuk's
novel, who allegedly wrote it long-hand while working as a truck
mechanic.  Palahniuk's story will leave some people slack-jawed, some
nauseous, some cold and some afraid to walk through the theater parking
lot to get to their cars.  Thanks to Fincher's direction (as well as his
production team – editor Jim Haygood and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth
from The Game) you can almost feel every punch thrown in the film.</P>
<P>Although there are plenty of fantastic scenes in the film, two in
particular have the misfortune of following recent pictures with similar
content - American Beauty and The Sixth Sense.  I won't say what the
similarities are, but after you see Fight Club, it will be pretty
obvious.  Despite this bad luck, Fight Club is still a fantastic flick
and almost seems ahead of its time in terms of social message and
violent content.</P>
<P>2:19 – R for disturbing and graphic depiction of violent anti-social
behavior, sexuality and language</P>
