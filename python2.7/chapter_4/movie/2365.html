<P>     The meeting of two fateful roads isn't the only intersection dealt
with in this movie.  There are also four lives and two loves,
hopelessly entwined and inseparably crisscrossed in a web of emotion.
And there's the past, present, and future, all coming together at one
explosive moment.  Too bad that INTERSECTION isn't a silent movie,
because the concept sounds reasonable until the characters start
reciting some truly dumb dialogue.</P>
<P>     Vincent Eastman (Richard Gere) works with his wife Sally (Sharon
Stone) and lives with his mistress Olivia Marshak (Lolita Davidovich).
Torn between the two--the cool, rational Sally and the wild,
tempestuous Olivia--and the different lives they represent, he's
unable to commit to either.  The only one to whom Vincent is able to
give his unconditional love is his daughter Meaghan (Jennifer
Morrison).  Yet, as he begins to untangle his relationships, a stalled
van and a rain-slickened highway take the course of the future beyond
his control.</P>
<P>     INTERSECTION is told non-linearly, with numerous flashbacks and
one critical flash-forward.  In scene after scene, the present-day
circumstances of Vincent are revealed, along with key incidents that
contributed to the situation:  his early relationship with his wife,
his first meeting with his mistress, his decision to leave Sally, and
the an awkward luncheon between Olivia and Meaghan.  When Vincent's
highway accident occurs, we are supposed to know him, so all that
remains is to see how the final act will be played out.</P>
<P>     As intriguing as the premise might be, the execution is lacking in
several fundamental areas.  Richard Gere is an actor of limited range,
and INTERSECTION's script demands too much from him.  A similar
observation can be made regarding his two co-stars, as the performances
of Sharon Stone and Lolita Davidovich lack strength and consistency.
While Stone's character is supposed to be emotionally-reserved, the
actress gives a one-note portrayal that too often renders Sally
lifeless.  Davidovich, on the other hand, overacts whenever a forceful
display of emotion is required.</P>
<P>     Regardless of how the actors perform, there's little they can do
with the appalling dialogue scripted by writers David Rayfiel and
Marshall Brickman.  This isn't a case of isolated lines sprinkled
throughout; nearly every scene is bursting with cliches and
melodramatic sentences that no real person would ever say.  The actors'
delivery is the lesser part of the problem.</P>
<P>     INTERSECTION frequently drags.  This shouldn't be the case, since
the emotional dynamics inherent in this situation should give the movie
a momentum independent of its non-standard narrative style.  That
doesn't happen, however, principally because too many of the flashbacks
aren't convincing or interesting.  A prime example is the auction
meeting between Vincent and Olivia.  More than any other sequence, this
one seems scripted and contrived.</P>
<P>     Then there's the ending, which takes an interminable amount of
time to arrive.  The last twenty minutes crawl by as we're treated bad
melodrama designed to bring tears to the eyes.  Ironically, this part
of the movie is where Sharon Stone has her best scenes.</P>
<P>     Likability of the characters is also a problem.  Sally lives
beneath a cold, emotionless shell and rarely, if ever, courts the
audience's sympathy, while Vincent is the sort of self-absorbed person
that one wishes an accident upon.  If there's a desire to feel sorry
for anyone, it's for Meaghan, the daughter of these two, yet she
appears surprisingly well-adjusted.</P>
<P>     Those who like Richard Gere, Sharon Stone, and/or Lolita
Davidovich will find something to enjoy about INTERSECTION.  The
presence of a favorite performer should be enough to eclipse numerous
faults.  Everyone else, even those who generally enjoy teary
histrionics, will likely find this a trying experience.  In more ways
than one, this particular love triangle is out-of-synch.</P>
