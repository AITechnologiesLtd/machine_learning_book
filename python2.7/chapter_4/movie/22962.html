Girl, Interrupted</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"Some advice ... never stick your finger out at a crazy person," a wild cat,
dangerously honest, less than stable Angelina Jolie warns an older
acquaintance of Winona Ryder at a local ice cream parlor during a rare field
trip from the institution.</P>
<P>Essentially, this is the story of one woman's sabbatical from sanity. We
begin the film with an assortment of flashbacks as Ryder admits herself to
Clayman Mental Center in hopes of getting a little rest from all the
headaches, hallucinations, etc. After the first half-hour, we're up to speed
on the history, and spend most of the rest of the film in the institution,
making friends and getting used to the awkward routine. "Don't drop anchor,
here," Whoopi Goldberg (nurse) cautions the confused Ryder.</P>
<P>Ryder is very good. Jolie is awesome. The direction, script and editing are
also supreme until the climax, where the script dumps a preciously delicate,
off-balance momentum for a rather cliché resolution. It was an "A" before
that.</P>
