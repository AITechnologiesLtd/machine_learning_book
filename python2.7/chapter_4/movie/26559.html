<PRE>The Contender </PRE>
<P>Starring: Joan Allen (Senator Laine Hanson); Gary Oldman (Congressman Shelly 
Runyon); Jeff Bridges (President Jackson Evans); Sam Elliot (Kermit Newman); 
produced by Willi Bar, Marc Frydman, James Spies, Douglas Urbanski; written 
and directed by Rod Lurie. </P>
<P><HR>Movies that are manipulative, formulated, preachy, melodramatic and have 
twist endings usually don't appeal to either critics or audiences. Yet here I 
am writing my review of "The Contender," a political thriller which could be 
described as all those traits and more, about to give it a positive 
recommendation when ordinarily I would not. This is one of those "exception 
to the rule" movies that's smart and authentic and you don't feel you're 
being pandered to. Think of it as a Tom Clancy thriller where words are the 
weapons and the media spotlight is the battlefield. </P>
<P>Joan Allen stars as Laine Hanson, a democratic senator from Ohio who has been 
selected by President Jackson Evans to fill the vacancy left by the death of 
the vice president. Hanson's a patchwork assemblage of so many politicians in 
Washington today: she's a Harvard graduate; the daughter of a former 
governor; her husband is her top advisor who also has a history of political 
experience; she's every bit as hip and trendy as Hillary Clinton and when she 
speaks she's charismatic and believable. </P>
<P>We're not immediately provided with the details of Hanson's political ideals, 
just three basic things: she's an atheist, she's pro-choice and she used to 
be a Republican but switched parties a few years ago. Maybe that's enough for 
you to get a sense of her character but I would have liked a little more. 
When the major players begin to discuss why she's been selected as the top VP 
contender and ramble off jargon about how she's not too liberal but not 
conservative enough (and the other fictional politicians she's compared to), 
it seems like a bit of a shortcut. But this is a movie whose characters are 
highly motivated by their image and it's clear what the filmmakers want her 
image to be. Hanson's not made out to be a saint or a revolutionary, she's 
just trying to make a living as a big-shot politician. </P>
<P>The yin to Hanson's yang is Congressman Shelly Runyon, a fairly conservative 
Republican from Illinois who appears to have a lot of tenure and seniority in 
the political world. He's a codger who doesn't like Hanson because she's 
pretty much the opposite of him in every way. Runyon heads a congressional 
committee who must interview and approve any vice presidential candidate 
before they can be sworn into office. His first choice was the governor of 
Virginia, a Bill Clinton look-a-like who failed to save a woman whose car 
crashed into a river where he happened to be fishing at the time (that scene 
opens the movie). President Evans also likes the governor but is afraid he'll 
be crucified by the committee as another Ted Kennedy. Runyon disagrees and 
will stop at nothing to prevent Hanson from becoming the vice president. </P>
<P>The first act of the film does an excellent job in setting up all these major 
characters and their motivations. None of them come across as pawns in the 
political circus but as real people with intuition. They're politicians who 
actually seem to care about the issues and how their constituents would want 
them to vote. For example, Christian Slater has a supporting role as a 
freshman congressman who tells President Evans right to his face and in all 
honesty he can't and won't play a political game because it's not in his 
heart. It's a cheesy scene because you know this a movie but at the same time 
it's refreshing to hear this from this type of character in this type of 
movie. Maybe it's one of those scenes thrown in just to impress Academy 
members, but nevertheless it works. </P>
<P>Around this point is where the film's major conflict comes in. It's a 
shocking revelation at first and thankfully it doesn't become the entire 
focal point of the plot once it's introduced. Runyon somehow manages to dig 
up the dirtiest of dirt of Hanson. It appears our upright citizen is not as 
squeaky-clean as you'd think (a politician with a corrupt past - what are the 
odds of that!?). To be blunt, she was Marilyn Chambers for a bunch of drunken 
frat boys doing the kinds of things to her you'd only see in a hardcore XXX 
porno movie. There's even some ambiguous photographs and witnesses to back it 
up. Things start to snowball for Hanson going from bad to worse mostly 
because she refuses to even respond to these accusations. </P>
<P>Do we want people serving in the highest level of government who were and 
could possibly still be sexual deviant? </P>
<P>Those are the kinds of questions Runyon asks aloud during his committee's 
grilling of Hanson. They're fair questions and I'm sure everyone who sees 
this film will have their own answers based on their personal politics. But 
that's not the questions writer and director Rod Lurie wants you to ask. 
Instead, substitute references to "people" with "women" and you've got one of 
the themes of this film. Lurie's depiction of the double standard is 
hard-hitting and provocative. It's an issue that's been on the feminist 
agenda for years (centuries even) and no matter how conservative you are 
you'll at least understand the rationale for trying to eliminate this form of 
hypocrisy. </P>
<P>However, an even more important theme is at work in "The Contender." It's the 
question the characters never ask - "Does what someone did in the past 
reflect their character today?" It's a similar idea to political views on the 
death penalty but since it's related to sex we comprehend it differently. 
Sometimes we can understand why a person might commit homicide but for most 
normal people it's difficult to understand why someone would want to be 
promiscuous. </P>
<P>In telling his story Lurie seems to come off as a liberal on the issues, and 
this is likely going to effect your enjoyment of the film. As a storyteller 
he's much more moderate. Runyon isn't made out to be an evil zealot and 
Hanson is far from being an innocent victim. His screenplay does a fine job 
in keeping everything as realistic as possible because anywhere else this 
film would be all about the games politicians play instead of philosophies 
behind the politics. For a rookie he's banged out an impression script and I 
have a feeling the Academy is going to take note of this. </P>
<P>If there's anything I could fault "The Contender" for it would be the direct 
references to the Monicagate scandal. At one point Hanson admits she voted 
for Clinton's impeachment but uses what will likely become the next "Show me 
the money"-like catchphrase: "Responsible but not guilty." If Lurie wants 
this film to be a show of support for Clinton and a message that the attempt 
to impeachment was unnecessary he should have been more subtle. </P>
<P>I also take issue with some scenes in which there's a "great speech" made by 
either Hanson or Evans about "The church of democracy" and "traitors among 
us" complete with the sappy orchestra music and intense mood. As much as I 
like the characters and thought the themes were powerful the use of this 
technique seems more like kissing-up to the Academy than honest filmmaking. </P>
<P>The ending is surprising because a lot of answers are provided. Whether they 
work and whether they were needed at all is certainly open to interpretation. 
Maybe it's a bit too Hollywood in some aspects but the fact it could still be 
surprising after all that has happened is a form of quiet brilliance. </P>
<P>In glancing over some reviews of this film by professional critics I noticed 
it's either praised mightily or harshly scorned. I am even more surprised to 
see a lot of bashing of this film on the Internet. That just means "The 
Contender" is going to be remembered as a pretty controversial film in the 
ranks of "The Blair Witch Project" and "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her 
Lover" and I think that's exactly what it set out to do. </P>
