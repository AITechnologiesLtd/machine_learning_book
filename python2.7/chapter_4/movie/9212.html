                      A film review by Timothy Voon

<P>It seems that unemployment in England has driven her unemployed subjects
to unusually high levels of creativity. First there was "Brassed Off"
where emotions are expressed through music, and now "The Full Monty",
where clothes come off, and women roll in for a peak at the real thing.
Well at least it's an honest living and a decent days wage.</P>
<P>These men come in all shapes and sizes, different ages and colour. It's
not necessary how you look or how you dance. It's who you are, and
whether you are capable of stripping in front of five hundred women AND
men. Imagine how difficult it must be to take your clothes off in front
of a single stranger, or having to piss in a urinal when there's
somebody looking over your shoulder. Well that's how it must feel when
six ordinary, unemployed men decide to strip for very different reasons.
Sure there's always the dole, but at least these men have the courage
to take action against their sinking fortunes.</P>
<P>The six male leads are relatively unknown to the general public, but
successfully engage the audience's attention with their problems and
failures. Director Peter Cattaneo has succeeded with the "Full Monty",
where "Striptease" and "Show Girls" both failed. It carries both heart
and humour, and enough male dignity to keep one's head high even when
the "Full Monty" is finally revealed. What the US of A needs is a full
scaled reply to unemployment. With perhaps the likes of say Tom Cruise,
Harrison Ford, Brad Pitt, Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves and Richard
Gere doing their bit with "The Full Monty" - the proceeds would
naturally go towards feeding hungry mouths.</P>
