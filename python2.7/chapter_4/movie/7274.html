<PRE>                            8 HEADS IN A DUFFEL BAG
                       A film review by Martyn C. Winkler
                        Copyright 1997 Martyn C. Winkler</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        The directorial debut of screenwriter Tom Schulman can best be
described as a dark, wacky comedy; a movie reminiscent of 'nouvelle
violence' (think of PULP FICTION), filmed shamelessly in the style of a
farcical sitcom. Schulman is probably most known for his Academy Award
winning screenplay for DEAD POETS SOCIETY, but is also responsible for
writing films ranging from HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS to MEDICINE MAN. For
somebody who has been in the movie business for several years already,
Schulman is refreshingly energetic and original as a first-time director
of his own screenplay.
        The cast of 8 HEADS IN A DUFFEL BAG consists of actors fitting the
nouvelle violence theme (Joe Pesci, for example, in a terrific pastiche of
his usual type-cast performances), as well as the sitcom style (David
Spade, now starring in 'Just Shoot Me'; and the
ever-so-familiar-face-but-nobody-remembers-his-name George Hamilton, from
such TV-shows as 'Dynasty'). This mix of opposite worlds is a potentially
unstable one, but Schulman manages to keep it together and delivers a
highly enjoyable and at times even hilarious film.</P>
<P>        The plot is as ridiculous as it is inevitable. Hit man/thug Tommy
(Joe Pesci) is assigned to deliver the heads of eight dead mobsters to the
Mafia-king who ordered their deaths. He neatly wraps up the heads in
plastic bags, places them in, yes, a duffel bag and takes the next
commercial flight to San Diego. On the plane he meets Charlie Pritchett
(Andy Comeau), a flaky student from Baltimore. Charlie is on his way to
Mexico, where he plans to spend the week with his girlfriend (Kristy
Swanson) and her parents (George Hamilton and Dyan Cannon). It is not very
surprising that Charlie turns out to have a similar duffel bag and that
the two accidentally switch luggage at the airport, but hey, we'll forgive
'm. The switch is the start of Tommy's attempts to retrieve his heads and
of Charlie's adventures in coping with the discoveries of the lost heads
throughout the Mexican hotel. Wild chases ensue, not to mention
unspeakable acts with cryogenically frozen bodies, or rather...their
heads.</P>
<P>        Please give the film the benefit of the doubt, though. It is much
more intelligent than it sounds, greatly due to the fact that it
acknowledges its farcical and contrived situations. It parodies those
situations as much as it shamelessly exploits them for what they are:
shallow and mostly physical humor. Take for example the scene where
Charlie is trying to take one of the lost heads out of a washing machine,
hindered by a blind (!) Mexican cleaning lady. It does not often happen
that you can feel free to laugh aloud in the cinema, without guilt, at an
obviously predictable and unbelievable scene. Again, this is greatly to
the credit of the witty screenplay, as well as the light-hearted
direction. Large portions of the film have been shot on studio sets, which
inadvertently recreate the feeling of television shows, or even the
(comic) theater. Furthermore, Schulman mainly uses wipes, from left to
right or vice versa, for the cuts between scenes. Normally this is a no-no
in modern day cinema, but the wipes give 8 HEADS... a traditional and
easy-going television-look.
        On top of this farcical foundation, the film sporadically jabs at
the viewer with darkly satirical moments. Only in a film like 8 HEADS...
can an audience burst out in uncontrollable laughter when a thug throws a
grandmother off a cliff...from a moving van. And adding to his obvious
homage to traditional television (where nobody is killed on screen),
Schulman reintroduces the grandmother at the final credits, suffering only
from a broken arm and some bruises.</P>
<P>        The acting is highly typecast and stereotypical. We have the flaky
good-hearted student who turns out to be smart after all, his enchanting
girlfriend who grows to love him even more, the stuck up father who still
calls his mother every day, his alcoholic wife and not to forget the
explosively violent Italian gangsters. However, the characters created and
actors cast are purposely flat and unrealistic. They are a satirical
reference to the GOODFELLAS and 'Friends' we have grown to know over the
years and help to create the surreal setting of the film. They are
essential in making the viewer accept the incredibility of it all.</P>
<P>        Now, I must admit the film has its weak moments. Certain built-up
scenes, screaming almost for a humorous resolution, are left dangling.
Characters are introduced, then later ignored. And the 'grand finale' has
promising potential, but is eventually disappointing. However, 8 HEADS IN
A DUFFEL BAG easily makes up for those flaws in its off-beat and highly
original concept.
        8 HEADS is essentially a tribute to the golden age of
television. It inserts stylistic elements of that medium into a twisted
version of the modern gangster genre of American cinema. Thus, Schulman
has created a surprising, intriguing and -heck, I can say it!- funny
movie. It hardly ever happens that a film makes fun of...well...itself!</P>
