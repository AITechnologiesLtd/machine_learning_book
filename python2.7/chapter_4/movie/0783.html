<PRE>                                    Q & A
                       A film review by Sandy Grossmann
                        Copyright 1990 Sandy Grossmann</PRE>
<PRE>        SYNOPSIS: There's never any question that the cop under
        investigation in this movie is guilty.  During the first five
        minutes, we see him commit murder.  The rest of the movie probes
        the interrelationships between cops as well as the connections
        between cops and criminals.  More a drama than an action film,
        the performances of Nolte and Assante make the film worth
        watching.  It's a Sidney Lumet film, so expect a gritty feel.</PRE>
<P>Violence and sex ratings:  Not an excessively violent film.  No sex.</P>
<P>The setting for our drama is New York City, and our main characters are:
  Al Francis Riley, the assistant D.A.  (played by Timothy Hutton),
  Quinn, the district attorney (played by Patrick O'Neal),
  Mike Brennan, the cop who commits murder (played by Nick Nolte),
  Bobby Tex, the drug dealer (played by Armand Assante).</P>
<P>     In most films, Nick Nolte plays a gruff-voiced but huggable teddy
bear.   Not so here.  His character is a law-and-order cop whose 20-plus
years on the force have pushed his hatred of low-life dealers and
criminals to an obsession.  He's the local hero of the precinct, known
as the cop who always delivers, no matter what the difficulties.  When
he fatally shoots a two-bit criminal, no one is much interested in
finding out about the details.   The D.A., Quinn, calls on a young
cop-turned-lawyer, Riley, to run through the Q & A (Questions and
Answers) procedure.  This procedure is a standard call-em-in-and-ask-em-
questions routine.  The outcome of a Q & A is a report with
recommendations that is turned over to the grand jury, which then
decides whether to press charges in the case.</P>
<P>     The D.A. tells Riley that he wants an assistant D.A. who shares
his values of law and order.  Riley's father was a well-known cop of
the same repute as Brennan, and the D.A. seems to be grooming Riley
for a part in the intricate world of enforcement.  The case that the
D.A. puts him on is the shooting that began the movie.  This is
supposedly an open-and-shut case of self-defense, and the D.A. tells
Riley to process the case ASAP so that  Brennan can get back to work.</P>
<P>     One of the witnesses is Bobby Tex.  In the course of the
investigation,  Riley begins to doubt Brennan's testimony, but each of
the witnesses whose story conflicts with Brennan's is a convicted
criminal whose word means little when in direct opposition to a
respected officer's word.  Riley is faced with the dilemma of doing his
job "right"--in other words, not being a rubber stamp--but by doing the
job right, losing the respect (and backing) of the D.A., losing the
camaraderie of the cops he so hungrily wants to be part of, and somehow
failing in comparison with his father.</P>
<P>     The people Riley always looked up look different up close, and he
finds his heroes-- even his father--to be substantially lacking in the
moral department.  Even more unsettling, some of the bad guys are
better than the good guys.  Bobby Tex is a proud Puerto Rican whose
sense of honor prevents him from falsely testifying.  Yes, he's a coke
dealer, but he's not the sweet Mel type of dealer that we encountered
in Tequila Sunrise.  Bobby has a depth of character and toughness that
are nearly palpable.   The contrast between Bobby and Riley is notable:
beside Bobby, Riley is a wimp, and a fairly dumb one at that.</P>
<P>     I won't comment on the rest of the plot, because information about
the outcome would spoil your enjoyment of this film.  Instead, let's
probe those characters a bit.</P>
<P>     Bobby Tex is the most interesting character of the film, and Armand
Assante turns in a great performance.  It's hard to believe that this
is acting:   Assante is so perfect for this part that it seems like
type-casting.   However, this street-wise tough guy is played by the
same actor who played the French psychiatrist in Private Benjamin.  Now
*that's* scope.</P>
<P>     The D.A. is a power-hungry politician, and I'm a bit tired of this
stereotype.   Nothing terribly new here, and a mediocre performance by
O'Neal.</P>
<P>     Riley could have been an excellent role for a good actor, but
Timothy Hutton doesn't have what it takes to suggest complexity in this
character.  Hutton takes a very one-dimensional, straightforward
approach here, projecting naivete and a childlike, trusting quality that
are out of place in this film.   (He's supposed to have been a street
cop before he became a lawyer, and his father was a cop, too.  That
isn't exactly the sort of background that produces naivete and childlike
trust.)  What happens to his character in this film is the stuff that
great roles are made of, but Hutton is simply, well, too simple to
portray a multi-dimensional character.</P>
<P>     In direct contrast with Hutton is Nolte.  The easy, Hollywood
interpretation of this role would be of a hard-ass racist who has
complete disrespect for the law he supposedly enforces.  Nolte, though,
plays a passionate man whose respect for his fellow officers and
workers is completely colorblind.   The easy banter between the officers
demonstrates an ethnic-rich humor that has nothing to do with racism.
Interestingly, the script was probably somewhat ambivalent about his
orientation; Nolte picked his way carefully, and he crafted a tragic
character of memorable proportion.</P>
<P>     This is not a great film, but it's a good one.  Its most
conspicuous flaw is that some of the characters' motivations are poorly
sketched (or played) and their actions unlikely.  In spite of its
flaws, though, the movie is well worth seeing just for Nolte and
Assante.  One superior performance in a film is a rarity today.  Two
superior performances ?  Enjoy.</P>
