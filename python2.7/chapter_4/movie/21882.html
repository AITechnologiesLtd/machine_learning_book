<PRE>Review by Donlee Brussel</PRE>
<P>"Bringing Out The Dead" opens with a title card that says "This film
takes place in New York City in the early 1990s" as if it's not evident
in the next 2 hours.  It seems unnecessary, since I doubt anyone will
mistake Scrosese's latest opus as a 2 hour episode of "ER."</P>
<P>It's film about 3 days in the life of Frank Pierce (Nicholas Cage), a
paramedic in Hell's Kitchen. From Martin Scorsese, we have come to
expect only the best, just like Terrence Malick, Stanley Kubrick or
Steven Spielberg.  Who set the bar for these directors?  The answer is
evident when you look at their films from the 70s and 80s. They each
did groundbreaking films that set the bar too high for
themselves. "Raging Bull" and "Taxi Driver" are considered two of the
greatest films of all time.  That's the reason "Dead" disappoints.</P>
<P>The first thing we hear in the film is a voice over from Frank Pierce
in an ambulance with his partner Larry (John Goodman). The opening
makes "Bringing Out The Dead" seem like a continuation of "Taxi
Driver."  There's a voiceover from our protagonist who's seeking
redemption in NY with a late night job in a mobile workplace.  He meets
a woman set to get his life back together.  Behind the scenes we have
Martin Scorsese giving Paul Schrader's (Taxi Driver) screenplay his
Midas touch. With those features, it's inevitable to have a sense of
deja vu.  One of the problems with "Bringing Out The Dead" is it tries
to play out as a dramedy.  The dramatic moments so cliched they seem
amateurish.  And the comedic elements that are present are so good, we
wonder why they're criminally underused.</P>
<P>The film gives Frank Pierce three partners. The first is a compulsive
overeater named Larry, played by John Goodman. Trailers, posters, ads,
none mention his name or character. Why? Maybe because he gives the
second to most lackadaisical performance in the film; it doesn't
require much range or acting chops and his segment is the worst easily
dismissable.  It doesn't have any suspense or the tension we've grown
to expect from Scorsese.</P>
<P>Ving Rhames has always been one of my favorite actors. He has a
slickness, a sly coolness that only he can achieve. Every one of his
roles has been great because of him.  He throws his all into each of
them and this is no exception.  The second act of "Bringing Out The
Dead" is definitely the best.  Rhames injects the film with life as
soon as he ignites on the screen.  His character Marcus is a great
contrast to Frank Pierce.  Marcus is a ladies' man whose ego is as big
as the city he lives in. A man who's also a strong believer in God.
Ving Rhames' performance alone is worth the price of admission or at
least a rental.  "Dead" is hilarious, kinetic, in a word, Scorsese-
esque.</P>
<P>And for its final act, the film concentrates on Cage's love interest
and his third partner, Tom Sizemore.  Tom Walls is a psycho-sociopath
and he's played to a tee by Sizemore. His exit scene is just so
sensationally idiosyncratic that I just have to give Tom his props. His
character turns the film into what it should've been in the first
place, a darkly comedic 2 hour MTV video. When he or Ving Rhames are on
the screen letting it all hang out for everyone to see, I'm watching a
good movie. When they're not on, we're left with Patrcia Arquette.</P>
<P>Arquette gives one of the blandest performances I've seen so far this
year. She drags down "Bringing Out The Dead" so much that it will leave
viewers tempted to leave the theatre. I suggest that they don't because
the film does have its admirable traits that should be seen.</P>
