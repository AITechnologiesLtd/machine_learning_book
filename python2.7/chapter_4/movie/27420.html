<P>   How do you react when a telemarketer calls you up out of
the blue and tries to sell you something?  You hang up right
away, don't you?  Of course you do, but perhaps you've
never run across a salesman with the skills and charm of
Penny Wise (Vince Vaughn), the avatar of telephone
capitalism, who knows--contrary to the advice
of "Boiler Room"'s Jim (played by Ben Affleck in Ben
Younger's vivacious and exciting "Boiler Room")--that you can
indeed sell to women.  You simply have to use a different
approach from that used to peddle items to men, quite a
distinct one as Penny displays viscerally in Gregory Mosher's
enticing first movie "The Prime Gig."</P>
<P>   Pendelton Wise is a complex personality, a salesman with
a heart (which, some say, is as rare as a lawyer with soul). 
He takes care of a physically disabled and emotionally
immature young man, Joel (Rory Cohrane), whom he puts up
in his humble abode while conning his boss, Mick (Stephen
Tobolowsky), to give him a job at Mick's shady operation
selling travel packages to unwary sun worshippers.  After the
shadowy operation closes down putting Gene (Wallace
Shawn), Archie (George Wendt), and Sujat (Shishir Kurup) on
the unemployment line, Penny's head is hunted by the sexy
Caitlin Carlson (Julia Ormond), who convinces the master
merchant to come on board yet another questionable
business selling shares of a potential gold mine in Arizona to
greedy clients.  When big boss Kelly Grant (Ed Harris)
persuades Penny that he can make more money in a month
than he could earn in a year of his former job, Penny is in for
the prime gig.</P>
<P>   "The Prime Gig" summons memories of similar movies
about telephone scams such as "The Boiler Room" (about the
pushing of bogus stocks), David Mamet's "Glengarry Glen
Ross" (about the selling of barren real estate), and John
Dahl's "The Last Seduction" (which centers on a femme 
fatale who prods and goals her telemarketers by standing
behind them with a stopwatch, informing them how many
minutes and seconds they have before they'll be fired). 
Unfair though it may be to compare "The Prime Gig" with
David Mamet's greatest work, "Glengarry," we can see in this
production the hand of that play's director, Gregory Mosher,
who helmed "Glengarry" on Broadway 25 years ago and this
time around makes his debut as a film regisseur.  </P>
<P>   Here we have a character we can care about despite his
delving in business deals of highly questionable ethics.  He is
concerned about the co-workers in the failing travel bureau,
going to bat for them as a sort of union representative--
insisting that the head of the operation pay off the employees
immediately in cash.  We don't know exactly why he takes
such good care of the seriously handicapped Joel despite
Joel's occasional lack of appreciation and willingness to
hobnob and get drunk with losers.  Penny is just a good guy
who gets involved with the wrong kinds of business.  He
knows how to sell, and in a particularly striking scene, he
demonstrates how to handle male customers on the phone to
get them to part with their money.  He doesn't play the
sympathy card with them as he would do with the fair sex.  </P>
<P>   Based on a script by William Wheeler, who received
considerable encouragement from the folks at Sundance,
"The Prime Gig" is absorbingly photographed, particularly one
scene exhibiting the smashing Japanese-style office provided
by Kelly Grant for the gold-mine operation.  Cinematographer
John A. Alonzo knows how to shoot the charming Vince
Vaughn with sexy Julia Ormond to evoke the chemistry
between the two, and Ms. Ormond herself does a first-rate
job of portraying Caitlin Carlson as both a hard-as-nails
assistant to a boss who won't take no for an answer and as a
vulnerable little gal when she lets her hair down and is out to
snare her man.</P>
<P>   The old slogan of salespersons is that a good one can sell
ice boxes to Eskimos.  This maxim is no longer taught in
business schools, which promote the idea of marketing goods
by a scientific method to people who are most likely to profit
from them.  You'd never know this from the operation on
display in Mosher's movie, as people with no prospectus and
no real knowledge of the firm's assets are ready to hand over
their life savings to strangers on the phone who are really
selling intimacy.  I've never bought from telemarketers, but I
bought this movie.</P>
