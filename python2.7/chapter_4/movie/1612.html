<PRE>                         BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA
                       A film review by Jon Webb
                        Copyright 1992 Jon Webb</PRE>
<P>     I liked DRACULA very much, almost enough to see it again.  It is a
film devoted to visual imagery, as usual with Coppola, but unlike some
of his earlier films (like COTTON CLUB) where the images seem added on
(and somewhat inappropriate) to a more or less ordinary plot, in this
film the plot is so fantastic that the images merely hint at the plot,
so giving viewers the opportunity to fill in details themselves, and
creating for themselves a richer experience, in the same way that a
painting may create a richer experience for the viewer than a photograph
of the same scene.</P>
<P>     This is largely a special effects movie; actors are secondary.  It
is interesting to note that this film eschews the increasingly popular
computer graphics techniques like morphing in favor of more traditional
methods.  This gives the film an older feeling, and also fits the mood
of the film, which is set in Victorian England.  The point of the film
seems to be the conflict between two cultures, the ancient one of
Transylvania and the war with the Turks and the (then) modern England.
Computer graphics would have placed us *in* Victorian England and made
us a participant in the culture rather than an outside observer, able to
see the conflict going on.</P>
<P>     I thought Gary Oldman did a fine job as Dracula, but it must be
noted that the makeup does an awful lot of the work for him in many
scenes.  One doesn't get any feeling of depth from any of the actors,
except Hopkins as Van Helsing; but that's probably the way the book was
written.  (Hopkins is great, by the way -- funny, exuberant, and
overjoyed at finally discovering his nemesis.)  Still, I would've liked
to see Winona Ryder display a little more quirkiness than she did here
as Mina; I think she has the potential, but perhaps she felt too
constrained.</P>
<P>     There are a lot of references to other Dracula films; any film buff
will enjoy these.  For example, the many forms Dracula takes are
undoubtedly references to the many shapes he's taken in different films;
I recognized him from NOSFERATU, for instance.</P>
<P>     All in all, this is a fun film, something like STAR WARS in its
quality and effective use of imagery, but also like it in its lack of
substance.</P>
