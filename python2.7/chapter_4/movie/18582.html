<P>In its time, "The Twilight Zone" was groundbreaking television, but 
watching it today often proves to be a taxing experience. Many episodes, 
built around ideas that felt startlingly original then, seem trite now. 
Too many were terribly padded, with sketchy characters chattering 
incessantly to kill time until the big surprise payoff at the end. And as 
for those surprise payoffs, some still hold up beautifully ("Don't get on 
that ship! That book, 'To Serve Man,' it... it's a cookbook"), but many 
others ("It's a planet called... Earth," "Pleased to meet you, Eve, my 
name is... Adam") feel so painfully obvious that it's embarrassing. </P>
<P>Which brings me to "The Thirteenth Floor," the latest entry in the "what 
is reality?" genre. Loosely based on Daniel Galouye's novel "Simulacron 3,
" the idea for this story was probably hot stuff when released in the 
'60s, but in the post "Dark City," "Matrix," "eXistenZ" cinematic world, 
it has a decided "been there, done that" sensibility. While the 
production boasts some jazzy visuals, the characters are so generic and 
undeveloped that it's impossible to care what happens to them. The film 
is boring and, if you haven't figured out the lame "surprise payoff" by 
the time our hero takes his first drive into the country, then you simply 
weren't trying.</P>
<P>The set-up (don't worry, I'll keep this short) goes like this: Some 
computer whiz kids have cooked up a virtual reality device that allows 
the user to "jack-in" and play out various experiences in a sepia-toned 
(they're still having troubles getting the color right) 1937 Los Angeles. 
When one of the creators gets murdered in our world, his colleague takes 
a dangerous trip into the simulated past to search for clues. </P>
<P>If you just found yourself thinking "Wow, that reminds me of Jean-Luc 
Picard having a Dixon Hill adventure on the holodeck," then 
congratulations, you're as big a geek as I am.</P>
<P>Even though the whole "what is reality?" thing has been done to death 
lately, the film still could have worked had the screenplay been better, 
but the characterizations here are utterly flat. Armin Mueller-Stahl 
injects what life he can into his role, but has relatively little screen 
time to work with. The rest of the cast, particularly leads Craig Bierko 
and Gretchen Mol, are just plain bad. </P>
<P>What the film does get right are some of the visuals. 1937 Los Angeles is 
beautifully detailed and looks great, and a shot of one character 
reaching the edge of the simulation, while overly reminiscent of the 
aforementioned holodeck, is striking nonetheless. Other effects are less 
successful. Wormhole style images of characters entering the virtual 
world have been better realized in everything from "Contact" to "Sliders" 
and the buildings in the closing shot are both cheesy and illogical (I 
don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say that the date and the 
architecture don't exactly gibe).</P>
<P>Had "The Thirteenth Floor" been cut to 22 minutes, it might have made a 
superior episode of "The Twilight Zone." As a feature film, though, this 
is a bloated trifle, with pleasures too minor to warrant the expenditure 
of your time and money. If you're in the mood to question reality, do it 
with "The Matrix" or "Dark City."</P>
