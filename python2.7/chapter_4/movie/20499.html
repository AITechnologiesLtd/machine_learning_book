<P>What you get when you cross a badly-done veiled version of THE EXORCIST with
an MTV video directed by a man who might consider Tony Scott, Michael Bay
and Simon West as his modern-day directorial heroes? Read on.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Mary Jane Nobody gets inflicted by the stigmata, a condition in which a
person is physically impaled like Jesus was on the cross. Being an atheist,
she doesn't understand why this is happening to her, and neither does the
brooding priest/scientist who comes from the Vatican to investigate the
supernatural event.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
The answer to the question from above is that you get STIGMATA, a film which
relies mostly on style and mood, and leaves the story element far away in
the backseat. I personally do enjoy films with a lot of stylish camera
tricks, but this one went a little overboard, with an overabundance of shots
featuring water dripping down, tight close-ups, slow motion scenes, quick
edits and loud music. This wouldn't have been too bad if the story had
enough meat to straddle my interest, but unfortunately, I was bored after
the first hour of watching Patricia Arquette get bloodied over and over
again, without much else going on. Redundancy, you have a name and it is
Stigmata! This film also features a drab resolution, which fortunately for
me, I could have cared less about at that time (And were those the worst
looking fake flames you have ever seen in the last scene?? Yikes!). One
thing's for sure, I ain't much into religion, but I can't imagine anyone
from the church being too much of a happy camper after seeing this flick.</P>
<P>On the positive tip, I sure did enjoy the soundtrack which proved that
Smashing Pumkin Billy Corgan could sure do a great Trent Reznor impression,
and the performance by Patricia Arquette, which was excellent as a cute,
hip, young chick who anyone, at least in our generation, could relate to.
And how about all of her funky getups and apartment fillers? Very kewl!
Byrne was okay as the Jason Miller part from the original EXORCIST, but did
they have to toss in a cheesy romance? Not my bag. Anyway, all in all, this
film might satisfy some folks who love the MTV-style movies with little plot
development despite a lot of movement, and Patricia Arquette fans, but
thriller fans, lovers of the supernatural genre, will not find anything to
get excited about in this bombastic retread. And despite not appreciating
the film's story line, I do mark it higher than usual, because I personally
do like Patricia Arquette and enjoyed some of its stylish intent.
Unfortunately, the director went too far in this area, believing himself to
be directing an action/adventure film instead of a taut thriller.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
I really did not know this fact before I wrote my actual review, but after
reading through some of the studio's production notes, it was a nice
confirmation to find out that director Rupert Wainwright was once an
acclaimed commercial and music video director! Score one for the home team.
:) He directed commercials for clients ranging from Reebok and Sprint, to
music videos for Michael Jackson and NWA. His first major directing gig was
1994's BLANK CHECK for Walt Disney.
Born in Chicago, but raised in Southern California, actress Patricia
Arquette is surrounded by actors in her family. Her father Lewis and
grandfather Cliff started it all, while her siblings Rosanna, Richmond,
David and Alexis continuing it alongside her today. This must be a widely
known fact by now, but Patricia has been married to actor Nicolas Cage since
1995. However, the way they got together is quite interesting: Cage proposed
to Patricia on the day he met her in the early 80s. Arquette thought he was
a bit strange but played along with his antics by creating a list of things
Cage would have to fulfil to win her (Like a black rose, J.D. Salinger's
autograph, etc...). When he started to work his way through the list,
Arquette got scared and avoided him. They met again many years later and
later went on to marry.
Gabriel Byrne comes straight out of Dublin, Ireland, and professes to be a
Catholic. He's also had quite a life. He only started acting at the age of
29 and came to America for the first time when he was 37. Before becoming an
actor, he was an archeologist, a schoolteacher, a short-order cook and a
bullfighter. He was also married to actress Ellen Barkin for about ten
years.
Actress Nia Long's career got started by Betty A. Bridges, mother of actor
Todd Bridges AKA ex-Different Strokes cast member. Betty was her acting
coach for 15 years
Billy Corgan's previous experience in composing music for film includes Mel
Gibson's RANSOM, which he partly scored.
This film was originally titled TOBY'S STORY.</P>
