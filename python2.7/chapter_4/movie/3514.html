<PRE>                             THE BASKETBALL DIARIES
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is a gritty new film chronicling the
adolescent years of poet/writer/musician Jim Carroll (played by Leonardo
DiCaprio).  Carroll was a star Catholic high school basketball player,
presumably headed for the NBA.  Unfortunately, his plans didn't quite work
out when young Jim fell into the cruel world of life on the street and
heavy drug abuse.  He kept a vivid journal of his life and times, hence
the title.</P>
<P>     This is not your typical coming-of-age story.  From the beginning,
the antics of Carroll and his exceptionally rude punk friends don't help
raise a lot of sympathy for their cause.  When the boys (including a
surprising performance by "Marky" Mark Wahlberg) get into trouble, mugging
elderly women and robbing New York shops, in order to raise money for
their drug habits, the temptation is to dismiss them as common hoodlums. 
But the powerfully realistic performance by DiCaprio, full of all the pain
and suffering that comes along with heroin addiction and withdrawal, makes
this film almost required viewing for any young person not exposed to the
drug culture.</P>
<P>     Carroll's early life reads like a textbook of what not to do.  The
film really gets under your skin and never pulls a punch, with Carroll
getting badly beaten, begging for drug money, haggling over the price of
dope, and violently shaking from D.T.'s.  The movie weaves between reality
and the drug-infused, nightmarish dreams of Carroll quite well, and
inevitably, pity for the boy win out over disgust for his habit.</P>
<P>     The filmmakers wants you to recognize that none of this is Carroll's
fault, and the vast majority of the movie is composed of various scenes of
the effects of the drugs:  over and over again.  The repetition, while
effective, gets a little tedious, having the impression more of a music
video rather than a movie.  Also, the preachiness of the film's theme
(Drugs are bad.) isn't exactly subtle, and the unavoidable happy ending
gives THE BASKETBALL DIARIES the flavor of a Public Service Announcement.</P>
<P>     Still, it's worthwhile.  This film won't encourage you to start that
heroin habit any time soon.</P>
