<PRE>Boogie Nights</PRE>
<P>Chad'z rating: ***1/2 (out of 4 = very good)</P>
<P>1997, R, 152 minutes [2 hours, 32 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[drama/crime]</PRE>
<P>starring: Mark Wahlberg (Eddie Adams/Dirk Diggler), Burt Reynolds (Jack
Horner), Julianne Moore (Amber Waves), Heather Graham (Rollergirl); produced
by Paul Thomas Anderson, Lloyd Levin, John Lyons, Joanne Sellar; written and
directed by Paul Thomas Anderson.</P>
<P>Seen Saturday, November 1, 1997 at 3:15 p.m. at Mohawk Mall (Schenectady, NY)
for $4.25 by myself.</P>
<P>There's been a number of epic, "The Rise and Fall of..." films released in
the last few years. It's a formula that's guaranteed for success if the
characters are developed well enough so that when they "fall" it's effective.
Most films using this formula are about low and/or high class criminals, but
what makes "Boogie Nights" so original and daring is the fact it's about
people who produce pornography. Yet this isn't a film about freedom of speech
and ethics (a la "The People Vs. Larry Flynt"), it's just a detailed study of
characters most mainstream films wouldn't dare deal with.</P>
<P>I'm sure everyone has wondered make kind of people are involved in the porn
industry. Are they sick and twisted or are they everyday people? Are they
exploiting their wild sexuality with porn, or does porn make them sexually
wild? It's a classic case of "the chicken and the egg," and the film leaves
it up to us to answer those questions.</P>
<P>This idea is perfectly illustrated through the main character, Eddie Adams
(Wahlberg), a busboy who's very well-endowed and doesn't consider himself a
stud, or at least realize he is and what he could do. He is approached by
Jack Horner (Reynolds), an adult filmmaker who takes his profession seriously
and knows Eddie could be a major star. Eddie comes from a dysfunctional
family, and when his mother kicks him out, he takes up Horner's offer not
knowing whether he'll enjoy it or not.</P>
<P>Although Eddie (who changes his name to Dirk Diggler) is the film's
protagonist, Horner is the catalyst around whom everything revolves. The film
takes place in the late 1970s and early 80s when porn was moving from
theaters to home video, but Horner insists on shooting all his movies on film
since he considers it an artform. This fact on its own makes it seem as if
Horner is one sick puppy, but within the film's context it makes sense
because we get to know him well enough to understand his rationalization, yet
we're not asked to condone or condemn him.</P>
<P>In fact, that idea symbolizes the film's usage of characterization and
theme. It delves deep into the industry, creating for an extremely
nihilistic, almost anarchic lifestyle (it's surprising this wasn't rated
NC-17). Many of the "actors" are drug addicts who do it for the money, while
others are seemingly normal people who just happen to be porn stars. The
business is such a part of their daily routine and their overall lifestyle
there's almost no distinction between the characters' personal lives and
professional lives. For example, consider the starlet Rollergirl (Graham) who
is called by that name at all times because nobody even knows her real name.
Or Amber Waves (Moore), a starlet who tries to be something of a mother to
the actors - someone they can look to for support.... among other things.</P>
<P>The first half documents the rise of Diggler from a nobody to a somebody,
and in the process does a good job in defining atmosphere and character. But
history proves fame can be taken away just as quickly as it was given, and
this happens here as Diggler (along with some of his co-stars) becomes a drug
addict. At first, he was coerced into drug use, but eventually he seemed to
genuinely enjoy it - so whose fault is it?</P>
<P>By the two-thirds point the film becomes more of a straight crime story
showing Diggler's attempts to get by using any means necessary. At the same
time, Horner starts losing his edge because he's so adamantly opposed to
switching to the mass market appeal of VHS home video ("Like any amateur can
just pick up a camera and make a movie!?"). I didn't like the gloomy
direction the story takes at this point. I felt as if I had seen most of it
before, in films such as "Trainspotting," "GoodFellas," and "Casino." The
story wanders a bit more than it needs to and I found myself becoming a
little restless. However, the ending is clever and poetic.</P>
<P>There's much to commend "Boogie Nights" for, mostly for the chance it takes
in telling the story it does, but also for its use of open-ended themes so
everyone will leave without feeling as if they'd been preached to, just
intellectually stimulated.</P>
