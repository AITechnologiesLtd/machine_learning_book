<PRE>SIMPLE IRRESISTIBLE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Have you ever been so head over heels in love that you felt like you
were floating?  That happens, quite literally, to Amanda and Tom, played
with great romantic chemistry by Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sean Patrick
Flanery, in director Mark Tarlov's romantic fairy tale, SIMPLY
IRRESISTIBLE.  In an age of ironic movie titles, it is refreshing to
have one that is completely true.</P>
<P>Although Gellar comes most recently from a teen movie background, SIMPLY
IRRESISTIBLE is unabashedly adult, even its very mild PG-13 rating means
that it would be fine for kids younger than teenagers.  It's also a
feel-good movie that isn't ashamed of emphasizing the upbeat and
optimistic part of our souls.  There isn't a dysfunctional family in
sight, and the characters are the sort of nice people that you'd like to
get to know better.</P>
<P>The story starts off with shades of YOU'VE GOT MAIL as Amanda's New York
City restaurant, The Southern Cross, is about to go bankrupt due to
rising rents and dwindling clientele.  The Southern Cross is a lowbrow
place that's been in Amanda's family for 70 years.  The waitresses lug
big pitchers of iced tea, and the plates don't match.</P>
<P>Across town, Tom manages an upscale department store that is spending 4
million dollars just to open a small, four star restaurant within it.
Tom's currently dating a Julia Roberts lookalike who has perfect skin
and hair and knows it.</P>
<P>One day, Tom happens by Amanda's establishment with Miss Million Dollar
Looks in tow.   Through a bit of almost accidental magic, Amanda
instantly learns to cook meals that are so irresistible that they send
people into ecstasy.  A few bites and Tom can hardly control himself,
especially after he tastes her pièce de résistance, the dessert.  ("I
love desert," she says.  "It's the whole point of the meal.")  He falls
hard for Amanda, which pleases her no end.</P>
<P>Being on different ends of the economic scale, Tom and Amanda don't do
much about their infatuation at first.  The movie's most enchanting
scene occurs in their next meeting after that first meal.  In his
restaurant, currently under construction, she looks at him, and, with a
come-hither look, she motions him over with her index finger.  Soon they
are dancing to romantic, big band music like in an old Fred Astaire and
Ginger Rogers movie.  They don't understand what is happening to them
(joint hallucination perhaps?), but they enjoy it.</P>
<P>The movie has a strong supporting cast that enriches the story.  HIGH
ART's Patricia Clarkson plays Tom's humorous and love-starved assistant.
HAPPINESS's Dylan Baker plays Tom's stiff boss and the owner of the
lavish, family department store.  And as Amanda's assistant cook and
love advisor, Larry Gilliard, Jr. shares the script's best comedic lines
with Clarkson.</P>
<P>Similar to LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE in its love of food and its
association of eating with loving, SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE is not a movie
you should attempt to watch on an empty stomach lest you get such a
ravishing hunger for great food that you are forced to leave the
theater.  And whatever you do, don't you dare let your spouse see it
alone.  The story puts such a romantic trance on the audience that your
other half is liable to fall in love with the stranger in the next seat.</P>
<P>SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE runs a breezy 1:35.  It is rated PG-13 for brief
sexual references and would be fine for any kid old enough to be
interested in romance.</P>
