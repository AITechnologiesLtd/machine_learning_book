                       A film review by Phineas Narco
                        Copyright 1993 Phineas Narco</PRE>
<P>     I just rented this movie last night (I think it just came out on
tape) and was kind of skeptical at first as I usually don't like
foreign movies, but I was *very* *very* impressed by this movie.  I
know of no other movie that was so simultaneously shocking, disturbing
and yet consistently hilarious as this one.  Scenes like the
shitting/singing guy and the nurse arguing in the hospital, confronting
the other film crew and shooting them and many others have me ROTFL.
Another interesting dichotomy was that the movie was simultaneously
done very realistically and yet was extremely absurd.  I'd be very
interested in any information people might have as to how the movie was
made, how such natural performances were elicited from people who may
or may not be actors, the special effects, how much was actually
improvised, etc.  Some aspects of the movie reminded me of Woody
Allen's TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN and Reiner's SPINAL TAP... due to the
cinema verite' absurdist pseudo documentary style of the picture.
Other scenes reminded me of HENRY-PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER  such as
the slow motion replaying of an attempted murder and the assault on a
family in a suburban home.  The neck brace reminded me of the final
scene in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, another movie with a charismatic
psychopath as it's focus.  Many scenes reached the point of stomach
wrenching realism and then some absurd element was added when the
viewer reaches the maximum point of queasiness.  *This movie is great!*
In case anyone doesn't know what I'm talking about the movie is
basically a pseudo-documentary that follows the exploits of a
charismatic French serial killer.  I *highly* recommend this film!</P>
