<PRE>                                    JUNIOR
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1994 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     What!  Arnold Schwarzenegger gets pregnant?  A high-concept movie
is typically defined as a film that has a premise which can be
described in twenty-five words or less.  As with his previous outings
with director Ivan Reitman, TWINS (what, Danny Devito and
Schwarzenegger are twins) and KINDERGARTEN COP (what, Schwarzenegger
becomes a kindergarten teacher), JUNIOR pushes the idea of
high-concept to the limit.  However, despite it's lack of story and
it's other assorted flaws, Schwarzenegger and company have managed to
create an entertaining movie.</P>
<P>     So how does Arnold becomes pregnant?  With a little bit of
science-fiction that has more science then one would expect,
Schwarzenegger plays Dr. Alex Hesse, a precise, European scientist who
along with his colleague, Dr, Arbogast (Danny Devito), is tying to
develop a pregnancy drug called Expectane.  Expectane eliminates the
problem of becoming pregnant and will yield millions for Arbogast and
Hesse. Trouble begins when bad guy, research administrator Noah Banes
(Frank Langella) sabotages the Expectane project so he can finance and
seduce Dr. Diana Reddin, (Emma Thompson) a cryogenic researcher.
Arbogast convinces Hesse to take a chance and experiment on himself.
The embryo is implanted and with a few female hormones and the
Expectane, Arnold quickly finds he has a baby in the oven.  Soon he is
experiencing all of the ups and downs of pregnancy and this is where
most of JUNIOR's humor emanates.  We get to see Arnold with morning
sickness, Arnold with cramps, Arnold becoming more emotional (he even
weeps at sappy commercials) and most of all, Arnold with a big, big
bulge in his normally lean torso.</P>
<P>     Schwarzenegger makes two types of films.  The first are the movies
such as TERMINATOR and PREDATOR where he exhibits his primary persona,
extreme masculinity.  The second are the Reitman comedies, where he
spoofs his primary persona by doing things that counterpoint his
"commando" mystique.  Schwarzenegger has the "A" version and the "B"
versions down to a science and as long as he does not try to mix them
(such as THE LAST ACTION HERO) he makes very successful movies.
However, how many more high-concept one-liners can Reitman and writers
such as JUNIOR's scriptors, Kevin Wade and Chris Conrad, come up with?
Actually, I'm afraid to ask.</P>
<P>     What really helps give JUNIOR some weight is it's supporting
cast.  Emma Thompson, who has proven herself adept at both comedy and
drama, is very likable and funny as the socially limited, Dr.  Reddin.
It was interesting to watch an actress of her wide range play against
the more limited mega-movie star.  They hold their own with each other
and there is actually some chemistry. Added to Schwarzenegger's already
established chemistry with the uncouth but affable Devito and you find
yourself with the ingredients that make JUNIOR more than just a one
line joke.  It's just too bad that Frank Langella (who played the
wonderfully wicked Chief Of Staff in Reitman's DAVE) did not have
much of a opportunity to stretch his wings in this film.</P>
<P>     Schwarzenegger surrounds himself with the best filmmakers he can
find.  Reitman is a top comedy director (ANIMAL HOUSE, GHOSTBUSTERS)
and he does his usual solid job with this film.  Cinematographer Adam
Greenberg who shot the monstrous TERMINATOR 2 and production designer
Stephen Lineweaver are conscientious in their use of color and light in
accordance with Schwarzenegger's arc from sterile scientist to pregnant
father. The film drags in the middle but I think this had more to do
with the screenplay than with Sheldon Kahn's and Wendy Greene
Bricmont's editing.  Finally, James Newton Howard's effective score
pulls all the right heart-strings.</P>
<P>     Although it's a lightweight film, JUNIOR actually deals with some
controversial issues.  I would not be surprised if I hear it referenced
in gender debates or abortion arguments.  However, all of this is
without design.  JUNIOR is an innocuous movie with some flaws, but it
certainly was funny to watch Schwarzenegger say, "I want to have my
baby."</P>
