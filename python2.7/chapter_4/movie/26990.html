<P>Dr. Suess' "How The Grinch Stole Christmas" </P>
<P>Christmas is that one time of year where everyone, regardless of their age, 
becomes a little kid. You get caught up in the excitement of it all - the 
decorations, the music, the get-togethers and of course the presents. 
Christmas stories usually work the same way so whether you've seen something 
for the second or one hundred and second time you can still enjoy it, but 
that is unlikely to be the case for you with this year's spin on Dr. Suess's 
"How The Grinch Stole Christmas." It's a live-action version of the classic 
children's book and cartoon show, but something's missing. It's only half as 
funny as it should be and the Christmas spirit it's supposed to radiate comes 
off as more of an advertisement to a theme park. </P>
<P>The only reason this "Grinch" movie was made is because of its star: Jim 
Carey as the infamous spoiler of Christmas. If Carey hadn't signed on to this 
movie would it have been made? I doubt it considering 95 percent of the 
film's gags, jokes and one-liners are directly attributed to Carey's 
zaniness, goofiness and unflinching love of potty jokes. Director Ron Howard 
and his Imagine Entertainment production company do their best to synchronize 
the outrageous antics of Carey with the children's story and the result is a 
bit of a mixed bag. </P>
<P>The basic story of "The Grinch" is about a mean green monster-looking guy who 
lives alone in a cave in the mountain overlooking Whoville. The village below 
is inhabited by human-like, cartoony characters with big noses, buck teeth, 
crazy hair styles and a mindset that rivals the Munchkins from "The Wizard of 
Oz." For some reason the Grinch hates Christmas while the Who's love it and 
he attempts to sabotage their holiday to crush their spirits but his plan 
backfires when the Who's carry on with their holiday as if nothing happened. </P>
<P>Stretching this premise out to a full-length feature film seems like a 
difficult task and at times Howard and Co. do struggle to get as many of 
Carey's antics on screen as possible while still sticking to the main story. 
They introduce several sub-plots such as little Cindy Lou Who's (Taylor 
Momsen) constant inquiring about who the Grinch really is and her wondering 
if Christmas has gotten too commercial. Momsen is absolutely adorable as the 
little innocent girl and of course her questions are reflective of how our 
own society has made the holiday into more of an economic indicator than a 
joyous occasion for all mankind. The problem is this theme is simply plugged 
in where necessary and never really leaves much impact with you, especially 
at the end. </P>
<P>The screenplay's story is a bit different from author Theodore Geisel's 
original. This time the Who's aren't so innocent, they've made Christmas into 
a cutthroat competition and even a sleazy mayor character is thrown in. This 
makes Cindy Lou's cuteness all that much more so - but only in a technical 
sense. She's fascinated with the Grinch, she wants to meet him and befriend 
him and try to change his mind about Christmas. There's a scene where this 
actually happens and the Grinch tries to scare her away like a monster would 
to Shaggy and Scooby Doo but she doesn't buy it. Cindy Lou's affection for 
the Grinch is so bizarre it's almost sick in a pedophile way. </P>
<P>Along those lines there's also a sub-plot about Martha May Whovier (Christine 
Baranski) who had a crush on the Grinch as a child and still has feelings for 
him now. Since Whovier's supposed to be the bombshell character Baranski has 
the least makeup on and looks about 99% human compared to the other Who's. </P>
<P>This is a problem with this film: it's inconsistent. After meeting the Grinch 
in person you'd think Cindy Lou would know all his tricks. During that famous 
scene where the Grinch, "disguised" as Santa Claus, breaks into her house and 
she catches him stealing the Christmas tree she actually doesn't recognize 
him! This is totally unbelievable and comes off as very trite. Even the 
3-year-old boy sitting in front of me at the cinema tugged on his dad's shirt 
and wondered aloud why Cindy Lou didn't realize Santa Claus was actually the 
Grinch (the father's answer: "shhh!"). </P>
<P>But I digress, I've come all this way and haven't mentioned much about Carey. 
Is he funny? Is he outrageous? Is he a convincing Grinch? I guess the answer 
to all three would be yes, but with reservations. Carey is basically playing 
his "Ace Ventura" character but toned down for children, this is a PG movie 
after all. Thus, to be outrageous he has to do a lot of yelling and spout of 
lines that are really only funny on a Saturday morning cartoon. He gets to 
say a lot lines that are in synch with pop culture now, but 5 or 10 years 
from now will be dated and that does not a classic make. It's funny on paper, 
but as an adult watching this you're just thinking: "yeah that's funny, but 
why aren't I laughing?" </P>
<P>The answer might be because it's familiar and comes off as contained. C'mon 
Carey, go wild! But that would mean we'd get a PG-13 movie and Geisel's 
widow, who had the final decision over almost all aspects of this film, wouldn
't have liked that. I can understand her logic and I agree with it, which 
means Imagine Entertainment should have taken a different approach to "The 
Grinch" altogether. </P>
