<P>     Have you ever had an 11-year-old try to tell you a joke?  If so, you
will probably recognize a couple of typical qualities.  First, the
enthusiasm of the joke-teller far exceeds his mastery of the basic
principles of comic timing; second, the joke is almost certainly one
you've heard before, and probably one you told when you were 11.  Peter
and Bobby Farrelly (DUMB AND DUMBER) are still those 11-year-olds at
heart, and their sense of humor seems to have matured only marginally.  If
you laugh at their films, it is probably for the same reasons you might
laugh at the 11-year-old's joke:  their eagerness to amuse is endearing,
or there's a bit of the 11-year-old in you as well.  KINGPIN is often
disgusting, but that is usually when it is at its funniest.  It is also
often slow, and that is when it is an effort to get through.</P>
<P>     Woody Harrelson stars as Roy Munson, who was Iowa's State Bowling
Champion in 1979.  That year, as a rookie pro, he makes the mistake of
beating hot-shot Ernie "Big Ern" McCracken (Bill Murray), who turns out to
be a very sore loser.  McCracken sets Roy up during an attempted con, and
when Roy is found out the angry victims shove his bowling hand into the
ball return.  Seventeen years later, Roy is an alcoholic with a hook for a
right hand, but he sees a shot at returning to the big time when he spots
Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid) at the local bowling alley.  Roy offers to
train Ishmael for a $1 million pro tournament, but Ishmael happens to be a
devout Amish, with no interest in such things.  It is only when the Boorg
family farm is threatened by debt that Ishmael agrees to hit the road with
Roy, and misadventures ensue.</P>
<P>     KINGPIN is a film which tends toward the parody style of the
Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker (AIRPLANE!) films, with obvious homages to THE
NATURAL, THE COLOR OF MONEY, THE GRADUATE and INDECENT PROPOSAL among
others.  The operative word here is "obvious."  If obviousness were water,
KINGPIN would be the Pacific Ocean, giving each gag plenty of lead-up time
so you can anticipate the punch line and spend a moment groaning as it is
underlined for you.  When KINGPIN isn't obvious, it's sick.  Having
covered diarrhea, mucus and urine in DUMB AND DUMBER, the Farrellys move
right along their Bodily Emissions Hit Parade to vomit and semen.  And
when KINGPIN isn't sick, it's repetitious.  There are more individual
injuries to male genitalia in this film than in an entire season of
"America's Funniest Home Videos." </P>
<P>     The thing about KINGPIN is that even when it is obvious, sick and/or
repetitious, it is still often very funny.  I will be very frank about
this:  it is funny in about as base a way as it is possible to be funny,
in a way that will be just plain unfunny to many people, or funny in a way
that might make you embarrassed to admit you found it funny.  It is funny
in that adolescent way that can't help but snicker at gags about hardened
nipples, farmers and sheep, or oral sex with a painfully unattractive
woman.  There are a few moments of inspiration in KINGPIN, particularly a
hilarious turn by Bill Murray as Roy's obnoxious rival which harkens back
to his smirking glory days, but this really isn't a film meant to operate
on an inspired level.  It is the kind of leering, slobbering, juvenile
comedy Mel Brooks is still trying to make, but appears to have forgotten
how to make, and it sneaks past your sense of indignation, into the most
primitive part of your backbrain, and gets you laughing.</P>
<P>     That said, KINGPIN still isn't particularly satisfying, mostly
because it makes the mistake of trying to create an actual dramatic
subtext.  At some point, the Farrellys and screenwriters Barry Fanaro and
Mort Nathan stop trying to parody THE COLOR OF MONEY and start trying to
_be_ THE COLOR OF MONEY, with Vanessa Angel as a streetwise lady playing
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio to Quaid's Tom Cruise and Harrelson's Paul
Newman.  Harrelson is left in the uncomfortable position of playing a
grotesquerie one minute and an ostensibly sympathetic loser the next, and
he isn't nimble enough to pull it off.  KINGPIN really crawls during its
final half hour as the Farrellys play up the redemption story, proving
once again that a scattershot comedy of this kind really has to pull in at
around 90 minutes.  Then again, lack of timing is just one more way the
Farrellys are like 11-year-old joke-tellers.  If you are over 21, KINGPIN
will probably be an erratic ride at best.  But if you are able to identify
with the 11-year-old in you, hold on to your sides.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 gutter balls:  5.</PRE>
