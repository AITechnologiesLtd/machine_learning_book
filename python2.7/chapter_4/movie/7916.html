<PRE>                                ROUGH MAGIC
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>By far the poorest excuse for a movie.  ROUGH MAGIC is so bad it almost
defies description.  It would seem that the film was done without a
script and that whatever nonsense popped into the writers' and
director's heads, the camera was given the command to roll.  Nothing in
the film made any sense; it was an insult to one's intelligence.</P>
<P>Bridget Fonda is the female lead.  She was given the most insipid lines
to recite ("You brute!") and the most ridiculous things to do.</P>
<P>Someone (Paul Rodriguez) eats an egg and explodes, turning into a hot
dog.  A dog eats the hot dog.  Later, at a wedding, Rodriguez explodes
again and appears at the altar nude.  Tojola (Euva Anderson) keeps
asking Myra (Fonda) for $3.24 because she had gotten gas at her filling
station and drove away without paying and I cannot remember why nor do
I care.  But Tojola's moaning about the $3,24 even at the wedding . .
.</P>
<P>Also in the cast: Russell Crowe, Jim Broadhurst playing a drunk, and D
W Moffett.</P>
<P>According to the director, "ROUGH MAGIC is about a woman's literal and
spiritual journey toward the re-awakening of her own heart."  I saw
nothing that even vaguely resembled that.  Several people die but later
come to life.  Weird and baaaad.</P>
<P>Directed by Claire Peploe who I find it hard to believe directed the
very funny comedy, HIGH SEASON.  I find it difficult to reconcile that
the same person directed both films.</P>
