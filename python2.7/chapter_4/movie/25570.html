<P>Horror films are always a favorite of mine. I will admit I've never really 
seen an invisible man thriller, except the tepid spoof "Memoirs of an 
Invisible Man" which Chevy Chase, which really wasn't all that good. Anyway 
when I heard of Hollow Man, I thought wow hopefully this will be a genuinely 
scary movie, with a great cast, great writing, and some great scares. So I 
went into the movie expecting all these things, and surprisingly the movie 
lived well up to my expectations even though I sometimes had doubts about it. 
"Hollow Man" is a very scary, gory, well-acted, even erotic horror story.</P>
<P>The story is about Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) who is the head of a secret 
lab, where they try to make animals invisible, and it works. Sebastian is 
however tired of testing on animals, and without permission from the 
pentigon, to which is funding all this, he decides to have his crew made up 
of Linda Foster (Elizabeth Shue), his ex flame, Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin) 
her boyfriend, and the rest of the scientists, Frank, Sarah, Carter and 
Janice. They inject him with the fluid that makes him invisible, but after 
being invisible for a while, Sebastian starts to go a little crazy, and goes 
out and does some bad stuff.</P>
<P>Linda now threatens to tell the pentagon about what has happened, which 
really makes Sebastian mad, and he goes a little crazy ending up in a 
exciting, very intense climax that left me more than satisfying. One warning 
about watching this film is that the gore in this movie is over-the-top in a 
good way. There is a copius amount of gore in the film, along with some very 
graphic violence, one shocking scene of violence almost made me sick, however 
do not let the violence get in the way of you seeing this movie. It really is 
surprisingly a good horror movie, with a great cast and great special effects.</P>
<P>For the cast, Kevin Bacon heads the cast as Sebastian Caine, and does a very 
good job in the lead role. He is very scary as a villian, and around 1/4 of 
the film it is only his voice. Sometimes however it is what you can't see 
that scares you the most, and "Hollow Man" is no exception. There are some 
genuinely scary moments in the film, and I was surprised at how much I was 
really absorbed into the film. Elizabeth Shue plays Linda Carter, and as 
always clocks in another great performence. She brings out her character very 
well, and adds yet another good performance to her record. To round off the 
cast Josh Brolin does a great performance as well, but seems a bit held back 
in his role. The supporting roles by Kim Dickens, Greg Grunberg, Mary Jo 
Randle, and Joey Slotnik, adds some depth to the movie and completes the cast 
very nicely.</P>
<P>The special effects are jaw-droppingly good. Sometimes I was so intruiged by 
the film that I lost interest in thinking they were special effects, and 
thought they were real, which at times scared me. The one complaint I may 
have had about the movie is that fact that the violence might turn off alot 
of viewers, which sadly might kill some of the box office. Hopefully all you 
reading this who don't like violence will still give the film a chance and 
have fun with it. Paul Verhoeven's direction is nice as well and the pricey 
$85m dollar budget really shines in the end. One more complaint is that they 
bill William DeVane as a major character, when he is in only two small 
scenes, but oh well you take what you can.</P>
<P>In the end however "Hollow Man" delivers the goods: it's extremely intense, 
smart and sometimes clever thriller, that tends to dive towards the slasher 
genre, but quickly goes back to its horror routes. The dialogue is a bit 
cliched, and over-ridden, but everything else in the film is top-notch. It's 
one hell of a summer ride!</P>
