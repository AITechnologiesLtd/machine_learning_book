<P>     Director John Landis is back at it, still light years away from the
comic masterpieces of NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE, THE BLUES
BROTHERS, AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, and TRADING PLACES, but
obviously having a high time adapting Harry Allard and James Marshall's
series of children's books.  The central joke here is that Stanley
Stupid and his family take *everything* at face value.  When their trash
is missing from the curb cans, they think somebody stole it.  When Dad
(Tom Arnold) discovers the city dump, he thinks he's uncovered the crime
of the century.  When the kids (Bug Hall and Alex McKenna) can't find
their father anywhere in the house, they think he's been kidnapped.  And
so on.</P>
<P>     Though it ultimately lives up to its title, THE STUPIDS is dumb fun
for, oh, about an hour.  The cast has enormous enthusiasm and the
costumes (and some sets) are relentlessly sunny.  (Kids would like the
latter, if this were a movie for kids.  I'm not sure if it is.) The
cheerfully chaotic plot is one of the most unpredictable in recent
memory, adding arms dealers, space aliens, and a postal conspiracy into
the mix.  Film fans will also enjoy the director's trademark in-jokes,
from "see you next Wednesday" to the casting of prominent directors in
cameo roles.  (That's David Cronenberg as Stanley's old boss and Robert
Wise as the neighbor.  You find the rest.)</P>
<P>     What's missing is a better attention to detail.  Though the sloppy
editing is entirely annoying-- *must* they cut away in the middle of a
musical number?-- the most glaring gaffe is the film's failure to adhere
to a consistent set of rules regarding exactly how this Stupid universe
is supposed to behave.  Other people, places, and things are allowed to
act as goofy as the title characters do and that's a mistake.  The core
contrast between smart and stupid-- the very essence of what the jokes
are about-- is undermined and that's no good.  This is one movie that
might be funnier if it tried to be less funny.  Trust in the Lloyd.</P>
