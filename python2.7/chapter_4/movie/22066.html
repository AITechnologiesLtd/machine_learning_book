<P>This is a mob movie parody that actually delivers more laughs per minute than
most straight comedies. "Analyze This" is a pleasurable movie experience, and a
real hoot; a grandly hysterical comedy that pokes fun at all the expected mob
cliches, and is guaranteed to offend everyone (including some mobsters). </P>
<P>Billy Crystal stars as a psychiatrist, Ben Sobel, who offers therapy to
divorcees and couples. One day, he has an accidental fender bender with a
mobster's car - Crystal offers his business card in case the guy changes his
mind about filing a suit. "Forget about it. I said forget about it," snarls
Jelly, the mobster (Joe Viterelli). Of course, Jelly does not forget when he
notices that his boss, Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro), is suffering from headaches
and is not performing up to par on the job. After all, he's Don Vitti, one of
the major crime bosses in New York City. </P>
<P>Jelly suggests that Paul visit the psychiatrist. Once he's there, the Don
intimidates Ben by telling him that he didn't see his face in the papers and
doesn't know him. Ben agrees but his life turns upside down when he starts to
counsel Paul. Analyze This steals ever narrative device you can imagine from
classic mob films like "The Godfather," "GoodFellas," and "Casino." There's the
voice-over delivered by De Niro, the typical mob kisses and hugs, shoot-outs in
restaurants, several comical "whackings", and Tony Bennett songs playing all
the while. All of this is done with style and grace. </P>
<P>Just as graceful and ingratiating as ever is De Niro, a proven potent comic
force ("We're No Angels" and "The King of Comedy") who steals every scene he's
in. He mugs mercilessly and whimpers incessantly - there's one touching scene
where he sobs over his father's death. De Niro is as fit, trimmed, and handsome
as he was in "Casino" - no wonder he originally wanted Martin Scorsese to
direct. </P>
<P>Billy Crystal has been on the sentimental bandwagon ever since "City Slickers,"
but here he learns a vital lesson: less is more. With a bespectacled look and a
curly beard, Crystal lightens up the screen with his pleasing charm and nuanced
timing. He learned the great trick - to pause with a glance before delivering
the punch line. Here he is pitch-perfect in one of his most memorable screen
roles to date. Crystal's last scene as he mimics a swaggering, posturing
Italian mafioso will leave you incredulous with laughter. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, there is one major flaw: the casting of Lisa Kudrow as Laura,
Ben's fiancee who keeps getting interrupted at every wedding opportunity by
Paul's henchmen. Kudrow does well, but isn't given enough to do. This is a real
shame, considering there could have been some winning byplay between De Niro
and Kudrow, but the three or four writers listed seemed to have nixed the idea
of supplying more than one scene between them. Still, there are enough comic
zingers, one-liners, and subtle humor to compensate. Besides, you have the prim
Chazz Palminteri as the rival mob boss, Primo Sindrone. </P>
<P>"Analyze This" may not be great shakes or worthy of being placed in the annals
of great comedy classics, but it is as satisfying and entertaining as any other
comedy I've seen as of late. And that's that. </P>
