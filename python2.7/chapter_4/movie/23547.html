<P>        This movie stinks!  Although it is professionally crafted and there 
are some decent performances, the plot is so bad it drags the film into the 
abyss.  I knew I was in for trouble when, during the opening establishment 
shots, we see a detailed close-up of Warrant Officer Paul Brenner's (John 
Travolta) military identification card and it is the wrong color.  This might 
seem like a minor detail, but anyone who has spent anytime with the military 
knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are 
yellow.  And what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so 
wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training.  Or what 
about when Brenner tells a suspect that, because he is in the military, he 
doesn't have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights 
were central to military law well before the Miranda decision.  How hard is it 
to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts?  Now details 
like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up, but this story 
is so full of holes it is painful to sit through.  For example, at the 
beginning of the film, Paul Brenner, an undercover Army investigator, gets 
into a gun and knife battle at his off-post houseboat and winds-up killing an 
arms dealer he had been investigating.  The local police investigating the 
death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that Brenner has 
been lying to them about the killing.  But instead of arresting him, or at 
least take him into custody for further questioning, they release him. Duh! 
Ultimately, Brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape 
of the commanding general's daughter, a young captain also assigned to the 
post. When Brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the general's daughter, 
does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects. No, 
his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially 
embarrassing.  Eventually, Brenner discovers that this murder is related to a 
violent gang rape at West Point eight years earlier.  I won't even go into the 
totally unbelievable rationale for the Army's suppression of this horrendous 
crime.  I will just mention one final flaw. Brenner is investigating a crime 
that occurred in Georgia.  The rape occurred in West Point, which is in New 
York. He is under a very tight (and totally implausible) 36-hour deadline to 
solve this case.  He needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at West 
Point.  Does he phone the doctor?  No, he travels (via some unexplained very 
fast transport) to New York to question the psychiatrist in person, and then 
he returns to Georgia (again by the miracle transport), without once worrying 
about the impact any of this will have on his deadline.  You have been warned, 
stay away from this one.  </P>
