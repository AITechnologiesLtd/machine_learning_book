<P>     Some motion pictures aren't worth the celluloid they're printed on.  
KAZAAM, a genie-in-a-boombox fable featuring basketball superstar 
Shaquille O'Neal, is such a film.  This is as witless as movies come -- 
an unamusing, moronic blend of horrible acting and inept screenwriting.  
I doubt that many people born before 1987 will find anything worthwhile 
about this, one of Disney's worst live-action offerings.</P>
<P>     Those who endure KAZAAM's torturous ninety minutes will find 
themselves desperately wishing that writers Christian Ford and Roger 
Soffer had generated a script exhibiting a moment's intelligence or 
originality.  Alas, this film doesn't even rise to the level of a bad 
made-for-TV movie.  By comparison, the old Barbara Eden series, I DREAM 
OF JEANNIE, was the height of wit and sophistication.</P>
<P>     The story, which has loose connections to Disney's animated hit, 
ALADDIN (but doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath), 
details the trials and tribulations of one young boy and his pet genie.  
Max Connor (Francis Capra), an obnoxious, self-centered, twelve-year old 
punk, finds Kazaam (Shaquille O'Neal), a genie confined in a boombox, 
when some bullies from school chase him into an abandoned building.  At 
first, Max doesn't believe in Kazaam's supernatural powers, but, when 
the big, strangely-garbed man rains fast food all over the young boy, he 
changes his mind.  So, as Max considers what his wishes should be, he 
and Kazaam bond.  And, as the genie dabbles in rap music, Max defies his 
long-suffering mother (Ally Walker) to track down his no-good father 
(James Acheson), who abandoned him ten years ago.</P>
<P>     There's no doubt that KAZAAM was designed exclusively to draw upon 
the popularity of O'Neal.  This is his second feature role (he played a 
top basketball prospect in BLUE CHIPS), and he hams it up big time, 
exhibiting a lot of energy, but not nearly as much talent.  
Unfortunately, O'Neal gives the best performance in the film, which says 
all that's necessary about the level of acting.  Francis Capra, who was 
believable in Robert De Niro's A BRONX TALE (he played the younger 
version of the protagonist), is woeful here, apparently trying to do his 
best to imitate Jonathan Taylor Thomas.  His Max is annoying from the 
beginning, and it's difficult to imagine anyone caring about, let alone 
sympathizing with, this kid.  Ally Walker and James Acheson, as the 
divorced parents, are as flat and uninteresting as a blank sheet of 
paper.</P>
<P>     KAZAAM, like most Disney live-action features, does its share of 
too-obvious product placement.  Pepsi and M&M's both get a generous 
number of shots.  Of course, the whole film is an ad for O'Neal -- 
basketball star, headline-grabber, rapper, movie producer (he gets an 
"executive producer" credit), and actor.  Apparently, there's nothing 
this guy can't do.  </P>
<P>     KAZAAM consistently pushes all the wrong buttons.  The feeble 
moralizing about friendship only speeds the curdling of an already 
offensive mixture.  This is artificial, formulaic film making at its 
most blatant, and far worse than anything previously turned out by 
director Paul M. Glaser (who, after his stint as Starsky in STARSKY AND 
HUTCH, directed THE CUTTING EDGE, among other efforts).  KAZAAM deserves 
to be slam-dunked down a garbage chute, never to be heard from again.</P>
