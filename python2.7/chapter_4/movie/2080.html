<P>     On the way to New York City, James Nashe (Mandy Patinkin) stops by
the side of the road to offer a lift to a beat-up and bedraggled
stranger.  This man turns out to be Jack Pozzi (James Spader), a
professional gambler.  As the two get to talking, Pozzi tells Nashe of
a recent robbery that lost him the ten thousand dollars he was going to
use in an upcoming "sure thing" poker game.  Intrigued by the idea of
some quick, easy money, Nashe offers Pozzi a proposition.  He'll
advance the ten thousand if all profits get split fifty-fifty.  The
deal is struck and the two are off to the rural Pennsylvania residence
of Flower and Stone (Charles Durning and Joel Grey), where the games
begin.</P>
<P>     THE MUSIC OF CHANCE is a film of many levels.  At its most
literal, it tells the story of a poker game and its consequences, which
include building a ten-thousand stone wall.  However, those that choose
to see this movie on that level only will find the production a rather
dry and stale experience.  While final scene, dripping with meaning,
gives the picture closure, very little is resolved, and there are a lot
of questions left unanswered.</P>
<P>     Peel back the straightforward plot and take a peek at what lies
just beneath it.  There you will find other questions, but these are of
a far more imposing and thought-provoking nature.  THE MUSIC OF CHANCE
explores how one moment can forever alter--and perhaps destroy--lives.
It also reinforces that old saw that luck is too capricious a force to
trust.</P>
<P>     At the center of the story are three characters.  James Nashe is
the basic "nice guy" who believes in honoring obligations regardless of
the cost.  He is also willing to accept far more of the blame than he
deserves.  On the other hand, his mismatched partner, Jack Pozzi, is
unwilling to accept the blame for anything; he would rather shift it to
fate, chance, or anything else he can make a connection with.  Calvin
Murks (M. Emmet Walsh) represents the crusty authority that keeps these
two very different men together in a union that neither wants nor can
deny.</P>
<P>     Metaphors abound, from the "wailing wall" to the "City of the
World" being built by Willie Stone.  In fact, there's so much symbolism
that little in this movie has a single meaning.  There are times when
the screenplay tries too hard to be intellectual, spouting such
nonsense as prime numbers having souls, but these isolated instances in
no way detract from the deeper meaning of the overall story.</P>
<P>     Character motivation and interaction are driving forces, and
necessary to understanding any of what happens during THE MUSIC OF
CHANCE.  As obscure as some of the plot may be, Jack and James are
completely understandable.  Calvin Murks starts out as something of an
enigma, but as the film progresses, clues about his real nature slip
out.</P>
<P>     James Spader, cast against type, is completely believable as the
unsavory and difficult-to-like Jack.  M. Emmet Walsh does his usual
"good ol' boy" routine with a nasty, sadistic twist--something he
presents in a subtle-yet-distinctive manner.  The standout, however,
is Mandy Patinkin who, with little fanfare, captures our attention and
sympathy with his portrayal of James Nashe, the man trapped and
battered by fate's cruel whims.</P>
<P>     The film's conclusion is it's greatest weakness.  Aside from being
relatively predictable, it isn't entirely satisfactory.  Movies such as
this don't have to wrap up all their disparate plot threads for the
whole to come together.  Nevertheless, THE MUSIC OF CHANCE might have
benefitted from a little more certainty about some of what goes on, and
how it all ends up.</P>
<P>     THE MUSIC OF CHANCE did not receive wide release because, in spite
of a well-known cast, it is not a movie for mass consumption.  After
all, how many people out for an evening's light entertainment are going
to get excited about an occasionally-pompous, intellectual film about
poker and wall building?  Nevertheless, as is often the case with
movies such as this, there's more to THE MUSIC OF CHANCE than can be
seen with the first casual glance.  An investment of time is needed
and, for the most part, rewarded.</P>
