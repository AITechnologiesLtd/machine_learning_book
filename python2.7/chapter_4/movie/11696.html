<P>Well director Mike Nichols(The Birdcage, Regarding Henry) is nothing but a
talented director, who never fails to be entertaining, and even inspiring
at times. His latest film, a political satire, about the 1992 Democratic
presidential primary is all that and more.</P>
<P>Jack Stanton(John Travolta) is running for president, a big step up from
governor of a southern state. His campaign is being headed by Henry
Burton(Adrian Lester), a ambitious young black man who's grandfather was a
highly esteemed civil rights leader. Other members of the group include his
political strategist(Billy Bob Thornton), his wife(Emma Thompson), Libby
Holden(Kathy Bates), and Daisy(Maura Tierney), together, they form the
weirdest group ever to help win a presidential election. The road to the
White House isn't easy though, along the way they battle a sex scandal and
several skeletons in Jack Stanton's closet.  </P>
<P>This is a fun movie, lighthearted and generally amusing. Its filled with
splendid performances from John Travolta(Oscar Nomination in his future),
Billy Bob Thornton(always brilliant), Emma Thompson(great as the power
hungry wife), and Kathy Bates(One of the best things about Titanic).
Unfortunately the movie suffers from a few flaws. The point of view is my
main example, Henry's character was bland and his acting certainly lacked
passion and was rather somber at times.  The second flaw was the editing,
it left little bits and pieces of things(for instance Henry's relationship
with his girlfriend) that should have been edited out completely. Apart
from these complaints the movie it worth seeing simply for John Travolta's
incredibly brilliant performance as our beloved(or scorned) President Bill
Clinton, it is certainly a memorable role. Not to mention the mostly great
supporting cast, its highly entertaining and bitterly funny.</P>
