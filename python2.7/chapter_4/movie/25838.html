<P>   Some people say that actor Ronald Reagan couldn't tell the
difference between real life and the movies when he was in
the Oval Office, so that when he said with a smile, "We bomb
Russia in 5 minutes," maybe he wasn't joking.  His
administration seems to have revived the whole issue of the
influence of movies on regular people, with the idea that a
great many of us are susceptible to Reaganitis.  We take
what's on the screen for reality while at the same time we
consider any aspect of real life that's not on the screen to be
irrelevant.  What an incredible theme for a movie or a TV
drama, and indeed we have had no small number of filmed
dramas taking off on that motif.  </P>
<P>   In Woody Allen's coldly clever comedy-fantasy "The Purple
Rose of Cairo," a Depression-era movie fan's latest idol walks
off the screen and into her life.  In Gary Ross's
"Pleasantville," a brother and sister are transported into their
TV set right into a black-and-white sitcom from the 1950s. 
They infiltrate the stodgy fifties types with their more worldly
sensibilities--just as some actors from a soap opera invade
the banal life of Neil LaBute's eponymous Nurse Betty in a
dark comedy that has absolutely everything going for it.  I'm a
fan of LaBute and went into the screening groaning that the
brilliant satirist had not scripted the story instead of being at
the helm, but I left stunned by the movie's perfect
combination of crackerjack acting, clever writing, sharp cross-
cutting of scenes, and a photographer's imagination that turns
the picture increasingly more colorful as the principal
character enriches her previously insipid life.</P>
<P>   What could the judges at the last Cannes film festival have
been thinking when they justifiably gave scripters John C.
Richards and James Flamberg top honors but passed over
the awesome performances of a top ensemble of thesps
acting out the most memorable comedy of the year?</P>
<P>   Though "Nurse Betty" is darkly comic, the film in no way
embraces the bitter, biting, satiric touch of LaBute as a writer
of overly-theatrical but mind-blowing parodies of human
relationships like "In the Company of Men" and "Your Friends
& Neighbors."  With LaBute in the director's chair, the film is
opened up, situated not in a nameless, abstract locale but in
specific areas of America, principally Kansas, Arizona, and
L.A., each location acting as a character in itself to give
added resonance to the scenes.  While in Kansas, Betty
Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) is a coffee-shop waitress whose
dreams do not allow her to be the sort that would slobber
over customers and garner big tips to bring home to her
abusive husband Del (LaBute regular Aaron Eckhart).  For
her, real life is the TV screen that looks down upon the
eatery, particularly when broadcasting a daily soap opera
called "A Reason to Love," starring Dr. David Ravell (Greg
Kinnear), a master surgeon whose wife had died during the
previous year.  Resisting the seductive charms of his latest
beautiful date, Ravell looks at the moon and chants, "I know
there's someone special out there for me." That's enough to
make Betty reach out like "The Wizard of Oz"'s Dorothy
beyond her home state of Kansas.  When she witnesses the
brutal scalping and murder of her thuggish husband by two
hit men, Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock),
she goes into traumatic shock and fully believes that TV's Dr.
David Ravell is a real person in a real hospital and not an
actor named George McCord.</P>
<P>   LaBute shifts to a road movie as Betty takes off in the very
Buick that happens to have a stash of drugs in the trunk,
making the hit men believe that she is a criminal who is in on
the felonious doings of her late husband.  As
cinematographer Jean Yves Escoffier captures some of the
great natural beauty of the U.S., particularly the Grand
Canyon and the red rocks of Utah, and editors Joel Plotch
and Steven Weisberg cross-cut furiously between Betty's
adventures, those of the two gangsters hot on her heels, and
the characters in the soap, we in the audience cannot help
rooting for Betty's getaway.  We instinctively want her to
attain her dream, her desire to say with full honesty, "I don't
think I'm in Kansas any more."  It doesn't hurt that Betty is
actually America's fondest girl-next-door, Renee Zellweger,
who captivates whether the starry-eyed groupie in Cameron
Crowe's "Jerry Maguire" or the conflicted rebel in Boaz
Yakin's "A Price Above Rubies."  Ironically we also cheer for
the gangsters, not the least reason that they are played by
the glorious Morgan Freeman who lights up every role and
the hilarious Chris Rock, this time as Freeman's younger and
more frenzied cynic.</P>
<P>   The standout aspect of the film is LaBute's way with
capturing couples.  In one marvelous fantasy scene, Charlie,
who is supposedly chasing down Betty with the aim of killing
her, imagines her standing next to him on a romantic evening
while overlooking the Grand Canyon (which Wesley scoffingly
calls "The Bland Canyon") and engaging her in a prolonged
kiss.  Betty also has a swell time rooming in L.A. with Rosa
(Tia Texada), who encourages her to find this man of her
dreams, while Betty's scenes with "Dr. David Ravell"--who at
first believes she is improvising a role to get a job in his
soap--later realizes with wide eyes that she has fashioned her
role into an actual person.  In another set of side roles that
mimics the action of the gangsters, Sheriff Ballard (Pruitt
Taylor Vince) acts the Don Quixote to the impressionable
journalist Roy (Crispin Glover) who follows him across the
country searching for the runaway "nurse."</P>
<P>   With "Nurse Betty" Neil LaBute exploits John C. Richards
and James Flamberg's clever and often exuberant script to
poke fun at our obsession with the soaps, with TV and, yes,
even movies in general, and does so without the malice that
had regularly been displayed by LaBute the writer.  We leave
with smiles on our faces.</P>
