Susan Granger's review of "UP AT THE VILLA" (USA Films release)</PRE>
<P>  If you weren't besotted by the beauty of Italy in "The
Talented Mr. Ripley," this screen adaptation of a novella by
W. Somerset Maugham should send you directly to your travel agent for
tickets to Tuscany. The story, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its
glorious setting. Set in the 1940s, lovely Kristin Scott Thomas is an
impoverished British widow who has a weekend to decide whether to
accept the marriage proposal of a wealthy but stuffy suitor, played by
James Fox, the recently appointed Governor of Bengal in colonial
India, or the amorous advances of a rakish, married American
adventurer - that's Sean Penn. So, instead of making any commitment,
she indulges in a duplicitous night of passion with an Austrian
refugee, Jeremy Davies, who worships her. She thinks it's a flighty
one-night stand but Davies has other ideas, which result in a
confrontation at gunpoint. So much for the pulp melodrama plot. The
most pleasurable moments come from Anne Bancroft and Derek Jacobi,
Anglo-American expatriates who amuse and entertain Florentine society.
Philip Haas ("Angels & Insects," "The Music of Chance") directs from a
screenplay by his wife, Belinda Haas, who is partial to having actors
exclaim, "by Jove!"  Very little is mentioned about the rise of
fascism and the horrors of Mussolini's regime except to acknowledge
its inconvenient intrusion into the leisurely pleasures of Florentine
life.  Pino Donaggio's swelling, soggy score is best described as
"elevator music," but Maurizio Calvesi's cinematography is
sumptuous. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Up at the Villa" is
a glossy but dull 4 - basically, it's Masterpiece Theater at the
movies.  Better choice: rent the video of "Tea With Mussolini."</P>
