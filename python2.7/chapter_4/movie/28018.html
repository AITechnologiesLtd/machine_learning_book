<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This film, a Roger Corman exploitation B-film, is a relic of the 1960s
and its only value might be in helping sociologists discover what went
wrong with that era's visions of universal love. It's a good trip as
opposed to a bad trip movie, scripted by none other than Jack Nicholson.
It sugar coats the acid experience and promotes it as if it was a
commercial for a product seen on TV. The film itself was a trip in
visual clichés. It was also comical without trying to be, as I lost
count of how many significant groovies, man, and wows were said. The
film was a naive work by those who weren't as sophisticated as they
thought they were about the drug scene. They just didn't seem to know
what to do with Fonda while he was on the trip and tacked on
questionable and uninteresting images. The result is a film that looks
and feels stilted and untrue. It should be an embarrassment for those
who participated in it, because of its fake Sixties hipsterisms. To try
to give the film authenthicity, Allen Ginsberg's Howl is the featured
book in the dealer's groovy bookcase.</P>
<P>Peter Fonda is a commercial director for TV going through a divorce with
Susan Strasberg,
who decides to take an acid trip to find something out about himself.
The chick he tells this to says, "acid takers are groovy." Well, there
you are, that's the film's plot and its resolution.</P>
<P>Bruce Dern acts as a guru for Fonda's initiation into LSD, telling him
"I'm gonna be
here, man, trust me." The scene is in a psychedelic decorated pad, with
a group of hippies passing around a joint and with Dennis Hopper dressed
as a hippie-like Mexican Indian, who can't stop saying wow and man. Dern
and Fonda will soon leave the group and go upstairs for the LSD trip.</P>
<P>Soon Fonda is saying things like everything is alive, I feel energized
-- I'm into some beautiful stuff. He looks at a grapefruit and imagines
he is holding the sun in his hands.
At one point, he hallucinates that Dern is dead and in his fright he
runs out of the house and through his neighborhood, entering a house to
talk with a little girl who wonders who he is. He will later go to
Sunset Strip and find himself in a psychedelic night club, but he will
run away when he sees the police. He will see a barrage of naked women
images and of hooded women chasing him on horseback, sort of a Knights
Templar experience.</P>
<P>Upon returning to drug dealer Hopper's pad, he will scare him with news
the police are after him, and he will be sent back to the Strip where he
will talk inanely to a woman sitting in a fast-food place.</P>
<P>None of his acid experiences seemed to be anything but trivial and
hedonistic ones; the scene in the laundrymat was the only one that made
me laugh. He goes into the laundrymat to talk to a lady dressed in
curlers doing her wash and gets involved in watching the machines spin
around and annoys the lady by pulling her still wet clothes out of the
dryer.</P>
<P>Fonda's trip went back and forth between bouts of euphoria and a
helpless feeling of dread. But when he comes down from his high, Fonda
says he found what he was looking for -- love. This AIP cheapie looked
cheap, as even the garish visuals -- which should have been super, were
flat and mind-bending in the wrong way. There was nothing on this trip
worth seeing. It offers a false sense of nostalgia for those who were
into acid, and for others, they should get a good laugh at the expense
of someone else's unintentionally bad film.</P>
