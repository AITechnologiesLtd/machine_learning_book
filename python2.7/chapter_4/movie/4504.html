<PRE>               A film review by Zach Douglas</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1996 Zach Douglas</PRE>
<P>     Four rooms, four stories, four directors.  The film is split four
ways between directors:  Aliison Anders (Mi Vida Loca), Alexandre Rockwell,
Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi), and Quentin Tarantino (Re-writes for
"It's Pat", Just Kidding).  Tarantino (hereforth, "QT") has a bit more
influence over the picture as a whole, as he was also an executive
producer, and even directed the animated title sequence.  It's difficult
to review this much hyped movie without reviewing all four pieces
separately. For the sake of time and space though, I'll try not to go too
in depth on each since this may end up lengthy anyways.</P>
<P>By now you probably know it's "Ted (Tim Roth) the bell hops first
night on the job" at the classic but run-down Mon Signor Motel.  It's
New Years eve and Ted is in for a wild night.  Allison Ander's room is
Ted's first stop in the segment "Strange Brew".  A coven of witches is
convening there to perform a ritual to bring their Goddess back to life.
The witches are a lively bunch including Valeria Golino (For some reason
her most memorable performances to me have been Hot Shots and Pee Wee's
Big Top), Madonna (Her acting hasn't really improved, but has gotten no
worse),  Ione Sky. Alicia Witt, and Lili Taylor. Together they begin to
throw the ingredients in the cauldron, but it seems one didn't bring what
she was supposed to.  I won't go into it, but they need Ted's help.
I was disapointed with the story here, as it was pretty straight forward
when I expected something more clever like a short film might deliver.
Also, isn't this a comedy?  THere was also a lack of humor if so.  Anders
uses some cute special effects and screen wipes, but I didn't really find
them attractive.  Roth's Ted is most annoying here as it takes a while to
get used to him playing the part that would have been more suitable for
Cosmo Kramer than Mr. Orange.  Enough said about room one, I found it
rather uninteresting, but at least we get it out of the way first for...</P>
<P>The second room, Alexander Rockwell's "Two Sides to a Plate".  Ted
is trying to deliver some ice to the drunken party in 409 (Was that long
haired yuppy scum Lawrence Bender? Again! I think so!)  but he ends
up in a different sort of party.  Sigfried (David Proval) has his wife
Angela (Jennifer Bales) in the ol' Marvin Nash position - bound and
gagged and at gunpoint.  From there, Sigfried has some good old fashioned
fun with Ted as he refuses to let him leave.  He pops some pills and
continues to booze while he gives his wife and Ted the third degree.
The story takes a minor turn, but it's an interesting situation left just
sitting there.  I was confused as again, there wasn't a lot of humor yet
there was also nothing in the story to make up for this shortfall, like
some interesting conclusion we are driving toward.  Jennifer Beals
is very good even while bound and gagged, but Ted is again flinchy and
awkward throughout the segment.  I'd like to be a better critic and say
more about what was wrong with the segment, but it seems to me that the
story being told just wasn't good enough to be interesting regardless
of the acting or the director's style.  Oh well, got those two out of
the way, two of Hollwood's most talked about new comers up next.</P>
<P>Third Segment, Robert Rodriguez (The 7000 dollar man) directs, "The
Misbehavers".  Word on the street was that Rodriguez's segment blew the
other three out of the water.  Yet I didn't find this entirely true.
Rodriguez's story DOES have some structure to it though.  The segment
revolves around Antonio Banderas and his Wife (Tamlyn Tomita) attempting
to go out for a night on the town while leaving the kids 'home alone'.
Yes, that's right Home Alone.  So Father politely demands that Ted watch
over the kids (or else) and slips him a quick $500.  Of course, all does
not go well with the kids, and wacky wild mayhem ensues.  This segment
was a lot better than the other two.  The characters get some good, quick
definition early on, and the it's off to the races.  The main problem
here seems that Rodriguez's style is quite restricted by the setting and
characters.  He wants to do his trade mark super-stylistic camera work
- but on what?  We see a nice take of Ted sweeping shoes of the bed and
also of Ted turning the key in the lock.  Ooh, Exciting.   Also, it's
supposed to be wacky fun with the two misbehaving' kids, yet Rodriguez
seems to forget they are kids.  There are many things that go harshly
against the grain here including the language and some violence.  I
found these things mildly funny, but mostly awkward and bewildering in
this setting.  Overall though, nice work with a memorable conclusion.
Definitely not bad at all.  Which leads us to wonderboy himself,
Tarantino.</P>
<P>QT takes the reigns a bit early as he has a short transition piece
where Ted calls up a manager to try and get some help (Why, if the
manager isn't Shocked Lady/Shot Lady herself from Reservoir Dogs/Pulp
Fiction!).  But, his call to the manager is taken by one Marisa Tomei
doing a HUGE stretch to play a stoned chick playing some nintendo after
the big party. This was probably my favorite part of the entire movie!
Tomei is excellent, and you can tell that the dialogue has made that
sudden change, a change over to...the Tarantino Zone.  Even Ted is
slightly calmed now, speaking fluent English.  Ted finally get to
speak with the manager. She tells him to take care of the hotel's only
Hollywood client if it's the only thing he does right the rest of the
night.  Flamboyant Movie Star, Chester Rush (Played by QT himself, imagine
that) is that big star. So Ted makes the trip to the penthouse to deliver
some bizarre items that the party requested, and from there on out it's
full-fledged Tarantinoverse.  In the penthouse are Chester, and his
apparent parasite/friends Norman and Leo (Paul Caldron and Bruce Willis
respectively, both in Pulp Fiction - Caldron is Paul, and that's up to
ya'll' if his name doesn't ring a bell) and also Angela from down the
stairs (Jennifer Beals character!  Perhaps Sigfried was RIGHT to have
tied her up!)  Like QT's previous works, the characters yak about
bullshit that has nothing to do with anything, yet somehow, it does.
Also, you seem to remember hearing bits of dialogue in another movie
some how - was it in..another QT movie? I think it was.  Chester curses
a lot and cozies up to Ted while Norman sits quietly and Leo is on the
phone arguing with his wife.  Once the gang feels ready though, they
let Ted in on the secret of why they want him to hang out with them -
to help them reenact an old episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents!  You
could feel the anticipation (curiosity?) of the audience rise instantly
at that point.  Chester then must sell Ted on staying to help them out.
I'm going to stop right there and let you watch the rest because it was
truly a great 20-25 minutes for me and I don't want to spoil anything as
it took all I could do to avoid hearing what happened myself before
watching it (Many have seen the original Hitchcock episode, although I'm
sure it's quite a bit different!).</P>
<P>I found this segment to be imperfect, but pretty damn entertaining.
I'll admit I'm a big QT fan, and he really puts more of a stylistic stroke
onto the canvas in his segment where the others couldn't seem to find
enough room to do so (perhaps that is why QT made sure HE got to film
in the roomy penthouse!).  Some of the camera work is amazing as the
camera slowly moves and turns while the actors just keep spitting out
lines, and eventually when the camera comes to rest, the actors are all
lined up on screen in perfect form, right where QT wants them to be.
He also shoots an incredibly long take (5-6-7 minutes or more?) and even
shoots a scene with the character's shadows talking. The dialogue is
funny, but nothing near as memorable as in his other works thus far.
There is a LOT of cursing which could be distraction.  I guess QT figured
he would get his quota in this new time frame somehow.  QT's acting is
slightly flawed as usual, but not terrible.  Caldron also didn't win my
respect as I thought they could have found someone else either inside or
out of the Tarantinoverse for this role (and QT's also).  Willis is
so-so but and Beals is even better than before, but it doesn't really
matter, as all the characters get better collectively throughout the
segment to pull off the punch line.</P>
<P>The segment is much like a condensed Tarantino movie.  There's the
B.S. which is like a shot to numb you and make you forget whatever it was
you were thinking about, then the anticipation that something is going to
happen, and then it builds (slowly, slowly), and then something happens
and in a big way, and then you have a nice stylish ending, role the theme
music.   It's got everything, just squeezed down a little smaller for the
limited time frame.  OK, so I'm an obviously biased Tarantino fan, but if
you don't agree that the end of this movie makes you think "Whew, it
wasn't a total waste of time" - then I'll stick a red hot poker up my..
ahem (sorry another QT dialogue reference).</P>
<P>Well, I covered what I could and the major points of what I thought
worked or didn't.  Overall, it's just not a very good film.  But, taken
in parts, it does have some interesting moments.  I failed to mention
earlier, another big minus for me was some grotesqueness/toilet humor in
the first three segments.  All three contained something that wasn't
very pretty (bodily fluids, references to bodily fluids, other icky
things).  None of them were very funny either, and somewhat low-brow
which also seemed to go against the grain at times.  Again, the setting
seemed to handcuff the first three directors the most and it's obvious
from their other works that they are no where close to talentless, just
perhaps not as adept at these shorter pieces.</P>
<P>On the good side, it's a very different movie.  Even different
than other experimental movies where different stories/directors are
combined. Tomei and Beals displayed the most talent and the acting all
in all wasn't bad. Bad and good aside, if you are a true Tarantino fan,
I think you'll eat up his latest offering and perhaps find some merit
in the other three where you can.  If you aren't, I can only hope you find
at least ONE room in the building that you can enjoy!</P>
