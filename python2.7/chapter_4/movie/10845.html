<P>Why, you ask, is this labeled as a review and not a retrospective?  And
why, you ask, are you reviewing this in Febuary?</P>
<P>Alright, here's the deal.  Back in October of 1997, a nice little
theater here in the St. Louis area, the "Mid Rivers 6" (one of those
little mall theaters) decided to show the original HALLOWEEN film on one
of its big screens - you know, like they say all the time, "the way it
was meant to be seen." Anyway, since I didn't see HALLOWEEN for the
first time until October of '97 (yes, sad isn't it?), and it was playing
in a theater, it's a review.  As for why I'm writing it now... well I
just got around to it, that's all.  Sorry I couldn't have a better story
for all this.</P>
<P>Anyway, this, the first of what is about to become seven HALLOWEEN
films, is quite the damn good show.  You have to keep in mind, this
movie was made for less than 1 million dollars, is scored via John
Carpenter's keyboard, and is the film that spawned oh, say... ALL the
slasher flicks of the 80s.</P>
<P>So in other words, the plot here has become the stuff of legend and the
stuff of so many imitators that it's predictable on a level that most
people don't even know existed.  And so what?  It's still effectively
spooky, and a good time.</P>
<P>Okay.  Here's the story.  This guy, Michael Myers, killed his sister in
Haddonfield, Illinois, when he was six.  And then he got shipped off to
the mental hospital and all that kinda stuff.  With me?  Good.  So this
Doc, Dr. Loomis, is studying the freak, and realizes that he's is "PURE
EVIL" (a Dr. Loomis catch-phrase).  And that means he's one of the most
wigged people when Mikey escapes over a decade after his original crime
and heads home... on Halloween.  Hence the title.  And hence the line
from the ads: "The Night HE Came Home." Get it?  Good.  Oh yeah, and
this girl, Laurie Strode, happens to be babysitting this night, and so
are her friends, and they're all doing this in the same area, and, well,
you can figure out the rest.</P>
<P>It's suspenseful, that's what this comes down to.  The music, cheesy
though it may seem at first, works.  The acting, particularly from our
two leads, works.  It's a classic, and it deserves to be, it's damn
fun.  Sure it's predictable.  But so?  A lot of movies are - you knew
that John McClane was going to kick terrorist ass in every DIE HARD
movie right?  It's all of matter of how you get to that point.  </P>
<P>So yeah, it lives up to the test of time.  It has the FEEL of a classic,
and that goes a long way towards the fun - even at the hokey times, you
know it only seems hokey because of the time period it was made in.</P>
<P>Anyway, that's enough from me.  All I really have to say is, you've
heard it's a classic film, and I'm agreeing that it deserves the
mantle.  Not many horror/suspense DO, after all.  All that without the
KWC.  And you know, nothing's scarier than a William Shatner mask,
either.  </P>
