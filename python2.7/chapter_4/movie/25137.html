<P>There are horror films that come with expectations, namely to spook
and scare us with the unknown. And then there is Stanley Kubrick's
misguided though definitely spooky "The Shining," a horror film that
is unaware of what it wants to say or how to say it. I admire Kubrick
greatly, he is one of the finest directors in the history of cinema,
but this film is definitely on a lower standard than some of his other
works.</P>
<P>The problem is mainly Jack Nicholson, playing the wild-eyed, seemingly
mischievous Jack Torrance. He has been hired as the caretaker of the
Overlook Hotel, stationed in a highly remote, isolated area of
Colorado. There is definitely something wrong with Jack from the
start, he rolls his eyes and hardly flinches when hearing a past story
of a graphic murder that took place at the hotel. His wife, Wendy, (a
frail-looking Shelley Duvall) and their son, Danny (Danny Lloyd), who
talks to his finger referred to as "Tony," come to stay with Jack at
the Overlook for several months so of course, something will go
wrong. There are several hints of this at the beginning of the film,
most telling example is when Jack is driving the family to the hotel
and mentions a cannibalism that occurred in the area. Wendy looks at
him in disbelief, and Danny, seated behind them, says "it's okay
Mom. I saw it on television." Jack replies, "You see. He saw it on the
television."</P>
<P>"The Shining" is essentially about those long, wintry months spent at
the Overlook, and the isolation is clearly felt from frame to
frame. Most the months are broken up by titles that indicate the days
of the week. Jack's madness begins to settle in, as he screams at
Wendy for intruding while he is at work on a novel. Then he begins to
see ghosts, such as a beautiful naked woman in a tub in one of the
rooms of the hotel, and a bartender from the 1920's whom Jack tells
about his fears and insecurities with his family, casually mentioning
his wife as the "sperm bank upstairs." Then something grows wild
within him, an animal is let loose and before you know it, the ax
comes out and he is ready to kill his family.</P>
<P>"The Shining" could be a conventional horror film but there are enough
eerie moments to make it a cut above the rest. But from Kubrick, I
expected so much more than the conventional route it takes. There are
the expected bloodlettings, blood that runs like a geyser from an
elevator, a decomposing, laughing crone with sagging breasts, several
ghosts, and so on. All of this is what one would expect from a Hammer
horror flick but under this master's hands, it all comes off as
typical shock tactics rather than real scares.</P>
<P>The other problem is the over-the-top performances that undermine
credibility and cause us to lose sympathy with the characters. Jack is
typical Jack, wild and insolent, seeming like an insane madman from
the very start rather than a character study of a man slowly losing
his sanity. Shelley Duvall tries her best I suppose but her screams
and gaping looks are grating and cumbersome - she does better in her
quiet scenes, such as the first scene between her and Danny discussing
the trip to the Overlook. Danny Lloyd comes under the rule of why kids
should not be cast in horror films - he simply stares into oblivion
during his "shinings" and makes rather offputting gestures with his
finger, mimicking the voice of "Tony." I know that this is all in the
Stephen King book, but that is why adaptations exist - to change
material that is often best left to the imagination rather than making
it literal.</P>
<P>There are several virtues to "The Shining." The film has an ominous,
otherworldly quality that is well-suited for such a disturbing horror
tale. There are the particularly ominous opening helicopter shots of
the roadways leading to the Overlook. The colors of the hotel are
mostly gold and pink, thereby evoking the 1920's atmosphere of the
ballroom. There are the point-of-view shots of Danny riding in his
bike through the corridors and hallways, all accomplished with a
Steadicam (one of the first films to use such a camera). There is one
truly horrifying scene where Danny sees twin girl ghosts who ask him
to come and play, immediately realizing they were the girls who were
killed in the hotel by the former caretaker. There is a brilliantly
edited and shot chase through the hedge maze outside the hotel where
Jack torments poor Danny. In terms of production design, art
direction, cinematography and sheer atmosphere, "The Shining" is
triumphant in all departments.</P>
<P>But it is a horror film without the horror - more like a mystery with
lots of hidden meanings in every shot (the haunting final scene
justifiably asks more questions than answers). Its histrionic
performances and overdone chilling musical score negates the horror
and turns it into a freak show with occasional moments of terror.
It's passable Stephen King horror but from Kubrick, one expects
something much more challenging and thought-provoking.</P>
