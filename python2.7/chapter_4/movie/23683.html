<PRE>NOT ONE LESS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Chalk.  It's an unimportant and cheap commodity for most.  But, in the
remote Chinese village where 13-year-old Minzhi Wei (Minzhi Wei) is a
substitute teacher, it is as precious as gold.</P>
<P>The primary school's only teacher, Teacher Gao (Enman Gao), who will be
gone for a month, gives Wei strict instructions regarding the proper use
of his small box of chalk.  She may use precisely one piece per day.
She is to write neither too large (wastes chalk) nor too small (hard on
students' eyes).  Since education consists mainly of copying from the
board, the chalk is the sole tool of her trade.</P>
<P>NOT ONE LESS, about the value of persistence, is a simple, slice of life
tale set in modern-day China from director Yimou Zhang (JU DOU and
SHANGHAI TRIAD).  Wei, who looks bored stiff while teaching her
students, has taken the job as a substitute for one reason and one
reason only -- she wants the 50 yuan that the mayor has promised her.
Since Gao hasn't been paid in 6 months, Wei's ability to ever collect
her pay is in question.  In order to keep her on the job and keep his
students there so that he will have a job to come back to, Gao promises
her that he will make sure that the mayor pays her.  Moreover, if, when
he returns, all of the 28 students are still there (he had 40 until
recently), he will give her a 10 yuan bonus.  But, only if all 28 are
still there and "not one less."</P>
<P>No sooner has he gone than one girl is taken away to a sports facility
to become a runner.  And then another, Zhang Huike (Zhang Huike), leaves
to go to the city to work.  11-year-old Zhang wants to get a job to pay
off some of his family's debts.</P>
<P>Wei vows to track Zhang down and bring him back.  This becomes an
exercise in practical mathematics for the class as they calculate how
many bricks (at 1.5 cents per brick), they will have to move to earn
enough for their teacher's bus ticket.  Their math skills are shown to
be lacking -- being off by a factor of 10 turns out to be a common
problem.  Their economic calculus is thrown further off when the owner
of the brickyard points out that they broke most of the bricks, which he
didn't want moved in the first place.</P>
<P>The peoples' attitude toward each other range from indifference to
hostility.  Wei, in particular, never seems to care about her students.
She has an obsession about earning the money and that stays the focus of
her life.  In the final act, she breaks down and cries on television,
saying that she's worried about Zhang.  Although it may be a cynical
view, it isn't clear even then if she really has any aspirations beyond
making some money.  Poverty can be hardening, and most American poverty
would look like abundant luxury compared to what Wei has to endure.</P>
<P>One thing is never considered.  What happened to the other 26 students
after Wei left for days to search in the big city for Zhang? She never
cares and neither does the movie.</P>
<P>NOT ONE LESS runs 1:46.  The film is in Mandarin with English subtitles.
It is not rated but would probably be a G as there is nothing to offend
anyone of any age.</P>
<P>The film has just opened nationwide in the United States.  In the San
Jose area it is showing at the Towne Theatre.</P>
