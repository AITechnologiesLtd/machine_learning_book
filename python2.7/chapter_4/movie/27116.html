What Women Want</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Whew. I must admit I had expected to spend at least some of this 2-hour 
production wincing at a suspiciously non-grey-haired Mel Gibson playing 
his cute card to death. But, like "Charlie's Angels," my fears of 
gritting teeth were pleasantly all for naught. "What Women Want" boldly 
goes where other romantic-comedies have only flirted -- straight into 
the heads of women. </P>
<P>Mel, raised in Las Vegas by a true blue showgal, could grow up but one 
way: a man's man, with a definitive idea of a woman's role in society 
(namely the bedroom). The story's beginning finds Mel, a successful 
advertising creator, in a firm soon to change its artistic direction. 
Helen Hunt steps in to remind this chauvinistic team that the market has 
shifted from male-minded consumers to decision making women, hence an 
about-face in advertisement strategy is in line. Of course, Mel has an 
unflattering "b" word for his new boss. </P>
<P>Ah, but due to a freak accident (whose timing couldn't have been 
better), Mel acquires the supernatural power to actually hear women's 
thoughts. How this comes to pass is completely hysterical and I have no 
intention of ruining that for you. </P>
<P>In fact, this movie provides plenty of hysterical moments. Our 
particular crowd busted its collective gut intermittently throughout the 
picture. In fact, they applauded graciously at fade to credits. </P>
<P>Mel and Helen are expectedly on the mark, but Marisa Tomei in a smaller 
role rips up the screen with her natural talent. </P>
<P>Barely a few sticky scenes could have been reworked, the sex roles are 
rather stereotyped, and having Mel react adversely to his new "power" 
seemed at first trite and contrived; but the overwhelming current of the 
film's fresh dialogue and crisp humor quickly eclipse these 
shortcomings. </P>
<PRE>A good fun film. Enjoy. </PRE>
