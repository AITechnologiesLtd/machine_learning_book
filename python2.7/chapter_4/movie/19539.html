<P>"Drop Dead Gorgeous" may be a breakthrough in mainstream comedy. The first 
standard-made faux-documentary to be released wide, the typicals of the film 
are anything but standard, as it manages to grab almost non-stop jokes out of 
the red-hot, fast, and furious screenplay by Lona Williams, many of which are 
more offensive--and hilarious--than, dare I say it, "American Pie" or "South 
Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut." Like 1997's marvelous mockumentary, "Waiting 
for Guffman," "Drop Dead Gorgeous" captures small-town life dead-on, but with 
an obvious satiric edge, and is entertaining from the first frame to the last.</P>
<P>At the outset, we are told that a documentary crew has travelled to the 
sleepy farming town of Mount Rose, Minnesota to make a film about the 
upcoming annual Mount Rose Miss Teen Princess America Pageant. Preparation is 
well underway for the nine contestants, all of which we get to meet through 
the course of the film. The shoo-in to win is stuck-up Becky Leeman (Denise 
Richards), whose wealthy mother, Gladys (Kirstie Alley), is a former Mount 
Rose Pageant winner, and who is the president of this year's festivities. 
Becky's obvious main opponent happens to be Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), an 
innocent soul who lives in a trailer home with her beer-guzzling, caring 
mother, Annette (Ellen Barkin), and often practices her tap-dancing steps at 
work--as she puts make-up on the corpses at a funeral home. Amber's main 
motive for entering the pageant in the first place is because she sees it as 
her only way of getting out of Mount Rose, and dreams of being the next Diane 
Sawyer. However, being the back-stabber that Becky is, there is no hiding the 
fact that she will stop at nothing to triumph over everyone else, even if 
that means murdering some of the other contestants. Meanwhile, we are told, 
the documentarians are required to act as merely spectators, and cannot get 
involved in the goings-on that are occurring around them.</P>
<P>"Drop Dead Gorgeous," vibrantly directed by Michael Patrick Jann, pulls out 
all the stops to give us one of the most snappy, biting comedies to come out 
in some time, and that the film is rated PG-13 is rather amazing considering 
some of the sure-to-be-controversial story elements. Taking its cue from 
1974's similar teen beauty pageant movie, "Smile," which may have been more 
realistic but is nowhere near as amusing, director Jann and writer Williams 
will do anything for a good, hearty laugh, even if it means going over into 
the bad-taste arena, and it serves up enough fresh, saucy ideas for two 
movies. </P>
<P>The plot thickens when Amber receives a picture in her school locker of one 
of the recently-deceased ex-contestants, with the words, "You're Next," 
sprawled along the back. Soon after, her trailer home mysteriously explodes 
with her mother inside. Luckily, Annette survives (she luckily landed in a 
flower-bed) and is just sent to the hospital, albeit with a severely burnt 
hand that has a beer can welded to it. Amber understandably begins to fear 
for her own life, but is convinced by her mother and mother's best friend, 
Loretta (Allison Janney), to carry on. The pageant itself is the centerpiece 
of the film, and it is a true show-stopper, with last year's Mount Rose 
princess, currently residing in a wellness home for anorexics, coming 
on-stage in a wheelchair and an IV machine by her side to lip-sync a song. 
Call it sacrilegious, but another hilariously off-kilter scene has one of the 
contestant coming out for the talent section and singing "You're Just Too 
Good to Be True," as she serenades and dances with a dummy of Jesus on the 
cross.</P>
<P>The cast is uniformly excellent across the board, particularly 17-year-old 
Kirsten Dunst, as the sweet Amber, who, no doubt about it, has one of the 
brightest acting futures ahead of her for anyone in her age group. Dunst 
constantly chooses interesting, intelligent roles and does not conform to 
anything she doesn't believe in. She also has proven that she can perform in 
any genre and will sparkle, and here she does just that in one of her few 
comedic roles (although briefly appearing in 1997's comedy satire, "Wag the 
Dog"). As Amber's nemesis, Becky, Denise Richards plays her bitchy role 
perfectly, even though she isn't given nearly as much to do as Dunst. She 
sure can carry a shotgun well, though! Kirstie Alley, like Richards' 
character, is extremely spiteful, but also very funny, especially in the 
final section of the picture, when her character goes right off the deep end. 
Ellen Barkin, as well as the irreplacable queen of quirky supporting roles, 
Allison Janney, add a certain warmth to their scenes, as Amber's loving 
family and confidants ("It was never hid from me," says Amber 
matter-of-factly, "that my dad put work over family. After all, once a carny, 
always a carny."). Also in notable smaller roles is Matt Malloy, as one of 
the slimy judges who is constantly trying to hide from the camera that he has 
a thing for underage girls; Will Sasso ("Mad TV") as another of the judge's 
retarded grown sons; Amy Adams as a good-hearted, if flaky, pageant 
contestant who tells Amber if she dies, to "be sure to cover up the hickeys 
on my neck, and ears, and upper thighs;" and Brittany Murphy, as the upbeat, 
giggly Lisa, another Mount Rose Teen Princess hopeful.</P>
<P>Topped with a memorable, catchy soundtrack, successful documentary-like 
cinematography, by Michael Spiller, and an endless stream of laugh-inducing, 
outrageous dialogue, "Drop Dead Gorgeous" is a huge comic winner, and one of 
the best times at the movies I've had all year. The offensive (to some) 
subject matter is sometimes mean-spirited, but doesn't get so bad as to 
become repugnant, and balancing out the savage comedy is a big, warm heart. 
Amber (who, in her spare time, visits and cares for the current anorexic 
Pageant winner), Annette (who hopes that her daughter will be able to follow 
her dreams and not end up like her in a dead-end existence), and Loretta (who 
doesn't have a true family but acts as a sort of loving surrogate mother for 
Amber) are such likable people, and an endearing combination, that you find 
yourself very much rooting for them, and wondering just why Becky and Gladys 
and the other spoiled sports of Mount Rose couldn't all just get along.</P>
