<PRE>                         UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL
                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert Redford, Joe Mantegna, Stockard
Channing, Kate Nelligan, Glenn Plummer, James Rebhorn Director: Jon
Avnet Screenplay: Joan Didion & John Gregory Dunne, suggested by the
book GOLDEN GIRL by Alanna Nash</P>
<P>Sleep your way to the top, but first, play hard to catch.</P>
<P>Tally Atwater (Pfeiffer) is an unknown reporter from a small town whose
dream is to become a 'star'. So she sends a fake resume to Warren
Justice (Redford), the director of a news broadcast in Miami and is
hired. At first she fetches his coffee and dry cleaning; then is given a
stint at being the weather girl before progressing to news reporting.</P>
<P>Pfeiffer is in my regards a good actress; however, she is just not
reporter material. The idea of dying her hair brunette to bring herself
credibility is as ludicrous as calling elephants pink, but what would I
know.</P>
<P>Redford becomes her teacher, mentor and lover. In a matter of years she
progresses to being a news anchor woman for the nations prime time news
station;  but this is not before she survives a prison riot where she is
locked up with angry, hostile, sex-deprived prisoners and comes through
unscathed!</P>
<P>Comment: She should have stayed the weather girl.</P>
