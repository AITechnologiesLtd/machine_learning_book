<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>One of the most obnoxious sci-fi films ever. It offers Hollywood's silly
response to the 1950s Red scare sweeping the country and promoted by the
McCarthy senate hearings looking for Commies under every bed cover. To realize
how dumb this Cold War film is, try this summation of the plot on for size: Can
it be that the Martians are signaling Earth and that their leader is that
actually uttering the very word of God? </P>
<P>Warning: spoilers are throughout review. </P>
<P>This is one of those really bad propaganda films that has no entertainment
value, as it shows how paranoic this country can be and how it can use religion
at the drop of a radio signal to promote materialism and Christianity as a
superior way of life than communism. This one might be the strangest and most
twisted Red menace films of all time. It ends with a hydrogen explosion in the
lab killing two good American scientists and one lousy ex-Nazi scientist now
working for the Russian Communists. The last message heard from Mars is an
abbreviated one (thank God): "Ye have done well my good ..." then there is just
silence. The film leaves one with the impression that Mars is ruled by God. </P>
<P>The nonsense begins when scientist Chris Cronyn (Peter Graves) and his boring
wife Linda (Andrea King), think they contacted Mars with his specially built
radio ("hydrogen tube"), as he follows his son Stewart's suggestion and uses Pi
as a communication link. Admiral Carey (Sande) is there to decode the messages
for the government and the press. The messages are really being transmitted by
an insane, ex-Nazi scientist, Franz Calder (Bergof), now working for the Commies
in Russia but living secretly in the Andes, who falsifies the messages for his
own amusement and to destroy American democracy and the western world's
capitalistic economic systems. The phony Martian messages from the commie
scientist causes the U.S. economy to crumble out of fear that the
extraterrestrials have invented things to replace such resources as coal and
oil. Don't ask me to explain how all of a sudden ninety percent of the world
workforce would lose their jobs and there would be a run on the banks because of
this message. But that's exactly what this filmmaker is asking us to believe. </P>
<P>But just when things look bleak for the Free World, a spiritual message comes
delivered on a different frequency. It's Christ's "Sermon on the Mount." This
prevents the Free World from self-destructing as there is a return to religion,
and in Russia the peasants revolt against their Commie captors and kick ass.
This restores the church to power in Russia, as a Christian patriarch takes over
as head of the government (boy, what an improvement!). If that wasn't enough of
an accomplishment achieved with God's help, the mad Calder escapes an avalanche
(I'm not kidding!) and enters Cronyn's lab to accuse him of stealing his radio
device. He then threatens to expose him to the press as a phony. But in a rage
at hearing God's message begin, he decides to blow up the lab. </P>
<P>This Red scare movie is made for zombies from another planet, or witch hunters
who want to justify how their dirty work is necessary. It's a classic in a
negative sense, a must see for those who can't believe how a bad film can really
be bad. </P>
