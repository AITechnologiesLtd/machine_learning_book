<P>     It's rather interesting--and a little discouraging--that the bulk
of theatrical science fiction is actually far better suited to the
action genre than to anything else.  TIMECOP is a perfect example.  As
a shoot- 'em-up, blast-'em-to-pieces film, it's not half bad.  As a
futuristic time travel movie, however, it has some very serious
problems.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, as it stands, this is one of Jean-Claude Van Damme's
better motion pictures.  Considering how abysmal some of the entries on
his resume have been, that's not saying much, but everyone has to start
somewhere.  Van Damme isn't much of an actor, but he has advanced
beyond the stagnant stage in which Steven Seagal is mired.  At least
for the moment, he's Arnold Schwarzenegger (unAmerican accent and all)
without the price tag.</P>
<P>     Any film whose premise relies as heavily as TIMECOP's does on time
travel is inherently treading on dangerous ground.  Paradoxes abound in
films like this, and how a script deals with them often determines the
success of the movie.  TIMECOP doesn't attempt to ignore these
problems--in fact, it makes one of them a key ingredient in the
resolution--but the explanations are less-than-thorough and the logic
is porous.</P>
<P>     The plot is actually a little more substantial than that of most
Van Damme movies.  In this case, our hero is TEC (Time Enforcement
Committee) cop Max Walker, one of the select few who are entrusted with
policing time travel technology.  Set in the year 2004, TIMECOP depicts
Walker's attempts to thwart the presidential campaign of Senator McComb
(Ron Silver), a millionaire politician who is making his money by
altering history--both that of the nation and of Walker himself.</P>
<P>     Aside from the improbability of time travel existing in ten years
(in fact, according to the film, it exists today), TIMECOP displays a
view of the near future that is an odd mix of the possible and the
unlikely.  The film's scientific and technological views may be on the
shaky side, but at least it doesn't commit the cardinal sin of
attempting to explain time travel.  Such technobabble-laced expositions
typically sound ludicrous.</P>
<P>     As far as the action sequences are concerned, there are plenty of
them, all of which are competently-executed (even if every one of them
seems to happen in the midst of a downpour).  The tension never comes
close to the level of a SPEED, but TIMECOP is unlikely to put anyone to
sleep.  Sadly, a lackluster music score by Mark Isham does little to
elevate the adrenaline level.</P>
<P>     Ron Silver is suitably nasty as Senator McComb .  While this
villain isn't close to the standards of DIE HARD's Hans Grueber, he's
still pretty easy to dislike.  In a smaller role, Mia Sara is suitably
sympathetic as Walker's doomed wife Melissa.  Bruce McGill turns in a
solid supporting performance as the head of the TEC police force.</P>
<P>     TIMECOP is in the TOTAL RECALL category of storytelling:  take a
popular action film star, throw him into a science fiction setting, add
a few minor plot twists, and let him blast and punch his way out of
trouble.  As far as this formula is concerned, TIMECOP lacks much of
TOTAL RECALL's wit and cleverness.</P>
<P>     Concerning the time travel issues, don't think too deeply,
otherwise you're likely to realize just how poorly-considered the
script's treatment of them is.  Time paradoxes are supposed to be
mind-boggling; TIMECOP has reduced them to a level somewhere between
confusing and dumb.</P>
