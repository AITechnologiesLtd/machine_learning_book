<P>      This one gets my vote as Worst Movie of the Year.  Robert Patrick
(TERMINATOR 2), of all people, gives the most consistently credible
performance.  He plays the white-trash husband whose costly custody
battle has forced his wife (Demi Moore), a former FBI clerk, to start
stripping as means to meet ends.  At least, that's why we *think* she's
doing it.  Incredulously, the director-- Andrew Bergman (HONEYMOON IN
VEGAS), adapting from the novel by Carl Hiaasen -- simply cuts from the
courtroom to the dressing room!  Moore mumbles something about "needing
the money" and that's all we get in the way of character motivation.
Period.  Robert Patrick is pleasantly distracting for a while, as is
Ving Rhymes' occasionally scene-stealing bouncer-of-few-words.  Ms.
Moore, on the other hand, gives an intensely coarse performance that's
probably too serious for what this movie had in mind.  She's no fun to
watch.</P>
<P>     How an ordinary Miami mom ends up with such a buffed bod is never
explained, either.  (Perhaps she is working to pay off her trainer and
plastic surgeon, as well?) There's also the small matter of Burt
Reynolds' corrupt congressman.  Slurring his way through a bad Brando
impersonation, Reynolds embarrasses himself more than any bad toupee
ever did.  Ugh.  Who knows what this unwatchable mess looked like before
the test audiences got hold of it?  (A reshot ending bumped the movie
from a planned Memorial Day release.) If nothing else-- and as Ms.
Moore's rote bumping and grinding can attest to-- STRIPTEASE proves one
point, conclusively:  that even SHOWGIRLS star Elizabeth Berkley can do
something better than the highest paid actress in Hollywood.  Bless her
heart. </P>
