<P>     A GOOD MAN IN AFRICA, based on William Boyd's novel of the same
name, is supposed to be a biting satire on the colonial attitudes of
British subjects.  The problem with the film is that it's frequently
more tedious than funny.  The story--that of British diplomat Morgan
Leafy (Colin Friels) stuck in the mythical West African country of
Kinjanja--lurches along for ninety minutes without any apparent goal.
The plot line is trite and the ending is hurried.</P>
<P>     Not even Sean Connery, who plays Dr. Alex Murray, can save this
picture.  In fact, most of the solid cast is underused, including Diana
Rigg, Louis Gossett Jr., and Joanne Whalley-Kilmer (who, despite second
billing, is perhaps on screen for ten minutes).  Ironically, it's the
least-impressive performer who's in the most scenes.  Hardly a moment
goes by when Colin Friels' flat interpretation of Leafy isn't forced on
the audience.</P>
<P>     Since the story is told from Leafy's perspective, one would expect
to find some redeemable quality in the character.  Not so.  The
diplomat is a bumbling, selfish, boozing, womanizing racist whose main
concern in life is being cleared of having obtained a sexually
transmitted disease so he can go back to drinking and sleeping with
women.  This man is not at all likeable, and being forced to spend the
movie's running length in his company becomes an irritating
experience.</P>
<P>     None of the other characters are especially sympathetic, either.
The best of a bad lot is Alex Murray, the "good man in Africa," but
even his irascibility grows wearisome.  John Lithgow's Fenshawe
(Leafy's superior), Whalley-Kilmer's Celia, and Louis Gossett Jr.'s
Adekunle are all so self-centered that it's amazing they're capable of
recognizing the existence of anyone else.</P>
<P>     The plot, which is really a loosely-connected group of short
tales, revolves around the efforts of the British diplomats in Kinjanja
to persuade Adekunle, the nation's new president, to sign an oil
drilling agreement.  Adekunle has his own agenda, however, which
includes making as much money as possible using all means at his
disposal.  Amidst this corruption, the only one immune to bribery and
blackmail is Dr. Murray, who has been in Africa for twenty-three years
simply because he believes in helping people.</P>
<P>     This has to be a low point in the career of director Bruce
Beresford (DRIVING MISS DAISY).  For whatever reason, he completely
misses the mark.  While not a total disaster, A GOOD MAN IN AFRICA is
far worse than one might expect given the names involved.</P>
<P>     It's all very well to sign Sean Connery, but the actor has to be
given something to do.  Not even the most imposing screen personality
can accomplish much with the sort of part available here.  There are
some laughs to be had in A GOOD MAN IN AFRICA, but not nearly enough to
make up for the interminable torture of enduring Morgan Leafy for the
duration.</P>
