<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt are mother-and-daughter con
artists. Their scheme is for mom, a sexy fortysomething, to marry a rich
man after a short courtship and then get her curvaceous daughter, a
twentysomething, to entice the new husband to make sexual advances
toward her and mom thereby gets a quickie divorce settlement when he
succumbs to the enticements with mom viewing it. Then the deadly duo
finds a new target, using different names and disguises. It results in
laughs that are engineered from the lowest common denominator of comedy.
But the good news is, that there are laughs to be had, if you are
willing to bite into the over-the-top performances, the unseamly sight
gags, and absurd plot. The bad news is, the film is sympathetic to these
revolting hustlers and the film's amoral theme is hard to justify,
except to say that this is just a cartoon for adults. It also begins to
drag, as the premise grows weary from overkill.</P>
<P>Their latest victim is Ray Liotta, a chop-shop operator from New Jersey
and a womanizer who lusts for Weaver, that is until on their wedding
night she passes out from too much drink. Hewitt, his new office worker,
tempts him when he returns to the office during his wife's wedding night
sleeping attack. She bends down and shows him her lovely ass and big
boobs sticking out of her skimpy outfit, arousing him to the point of
pouncing on her and then getting caught in a compromising position just
as mom walks in, recovered from her wedding night blues.</P>
<P>The divorce settlement is $300,000 and a Mercedes-Benz, but it's not
enough to pay off the IRS according to an agent (Anne Bancroft), who
closes mom's bank account. The petulant daughter wanted out of the
partnership, anxious to go on her own con jobs, which is the reason why
mom arranged for the phony con artist IRS agent, her old friend who
taught her the ropes. She does this to keep Hewitt with her, even if it
is a dysfunctional relationship she is trying to save, one filled with
all the signs of a Freudian-like mother-daughter rivalry. Needing a big
score, the con women head to Palm Beach, Florida to lure tobacco tycoon
Gene Hackman, whom mom sees as a disgusting man on his last legs that
they can get millions from. But, while mom pretends to be an exotic
Russian to catch the chain-smoking and constantly coughing and wheezing
Hackman's interest, daughter falls for the only nice guy in the film,
Jason Lee, who owns the restaurant he is a bartender in and owns the
piece of waterfront property the restaurant sits on, that is worth
$3,000,000. She wavers back and forth on whether his love for her is
sincere or if he's just goofy, as she decides whether to con him or not.</P>
<P>"Heartbreakers" is a forgettable fluff film, that tries unsuccessfully
to work its way to romance and also be a caper flick. It works best when
showing off the boobs of Weaver and Hewitt, who are outfitted in dresses
sluts would wear to walk the streets, as the film proudly relies on the
old adage, that sex sells. There were a number of funny bits, and they
came from Hackman's W. C. Fields-like performance, calling out for the
love of smoking and preaching its virtues, even encouraging children to
take up smoking. In one scene he blows smoke into a parrot's cage and it
soon keels over. The rest of the comedy was delivered by Liotta's
enthusiastic over-the-top way of doing things, whether fishing by firing
a gun into the ocean, ditching a corpse New Jersey-style, or by
preparing for sex while almost completely naked and tied to the
bedposts. What the comedy had going for it, was a lot of spunk, enough
to overlook the film's many drawbacks.</P>
