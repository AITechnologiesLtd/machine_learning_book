<P>Out for Love, Be Right Back (Yetzika L'hapes Ahavah, Techef Ashuv) -
Israel, 1997</P>
<P>Israeli drama/documentary by Dan Katzir, a young filmmaker from a
prominent Tel Aviv family. Katzir arrives in film school in Tel Aviv,
newly out of the army, and starts filming his own life and his search for
a girlfriend. This is an admittedly loathesome start for any film, and
it's been done dozens of times (20 Dates, last year), but it becomes
extremely compelling once we get to know him, his family, and the eventual
girl, a lovely brunette named Iris. As Katzir gets to know her, he also
confronts his own family history, ranging from an great-uncle who was
president to his grandfather, slaughtered in the Tel Aviv airport by
Japanese terrorists in the 1970s. </P>
<P>Katzir is extremely young (21 when starting the film, newly out of the
army) and his politics and sensibilities are informed by the contemporary
youthful post-Zionism and skepticism of the army. As he says, he'd rather
be on the streets of Tel Aviv, sitting in cafeés and looking for a
girlfriend. But politics inevitably intrude on his artistic dreams: his
romance with Iris coincides with the traumatic period of Israeli politics
during the middle-1990s, from the peace with Jordan to the assassination
of Rabin to the mass terrorism in the heart of his beloved Dizengoff
Square. As Iris enlists in the army, eventually joining the officer's
training program, he has to reconcile his own disillusionment with the
army with her dreams and his own family history.</P>
<P>After a bit of a slow start, this becomes a very moving and fast-paced
story, especially as Katzir realizes how much his own life and ambitions
are entangled with Israel's as a nation. At 55 minutes, it's brief and
tightly edited. The music selection illustrates an odd sense of humor,
ranging from sentimental Israeli army ballads to mid-century French cafe
chansons by Edith Piaf. Well recommended. Katzir's website at
