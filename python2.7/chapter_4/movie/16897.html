<P>LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON (USA, 1957) ***1/2. Directed, produced,written (with
I.A.L.Diamond) by Billy Wilder. Based on the novel Ariane by Claude Anet.
Photography, William Mellor. Editing, Leonide Azar. Production design,
Alexander Trauner. Music, Franz Waxman. Costumes, Hubert de Givenchy. Cast:
Gary Cooper (Frank Flannagan),  Audrey Hepburn (Ariane Chavasse), Maurice
Chevalier (Claude Chavasse, Van Doude (Michel), John McGiver (Mr. X), Lise
Bourdin (Mrs. X) Bonifas (Commissioner of Police), Audrey Wilder ( a
brunette), Gyula Kokas, Michel Kokas, George Cocos. Victor Gazzoli (the 4
Gypsies, musicians), Olga Valery (Lady with Dog),  Leila Croft and Valerie
Croft (Swedish Twins), et al.</P>
<P>Comedy-romance stars Gary Cooper (1901-1961), Audrey Hepburn (1929-1993),
Maurice Chevalier (1888-1972),  with John McGiver in a funny supporting
role, and the Diga Valery Gypsy musicians reinforcing the comedy.  This gem
by Billy Wilder is on my short list of the most underrated movies, and is
one of the least mentioned Wilder films. Of course, it is not without
fervent admirers.</P>
<P>American playboy millionaire Cooper, in Paris, has an affair (one of
dozens) with the wife of bumbling Britisher McGiver. The latter employs
private eye Chevalier, a specialist in getting evidence on unfaithful
spouses. Chevalier's daughter, music  conservatory student Hepburn, learns
of this, goes to the famous Hotel Ritz to warn Cooper that McGiver
(awkardly gun-toting)  is about to catch the couple in flagrante delicto.</P>
<P>A May-December romance develops. Even though Cooper looks his age and may
well have been already ill at the time, and even though Hepburn, then
28-ish, looks radiantly like 19 or 20, the rapport between the two works
extremely well. The loving father-daughter Chevalier-Hepburn relationship
is utterly charming too.</P>
<P>The script is by Wilder and his then-new collaborator I.A. L. Diamond. This
team went on to more superb work together, including the 1959 "Some Like It
Hot." "Love in the Afternoon " is an original movie, in ways sometimes
apparent -- even obvious -- but  also sometimes too delicate and
anti-cliche for unsophisticated viewers -- and the cinema public has been
sadly and gradually losing its sophistication since that movie was made.</P>
<P>Cooper's unusual, un-rakish ladykiller, for example, is deemed improbable
by some people, yet it adds something new to the traditional depiction of
Don Juans. "Love in the Afternoon" has wit, humor, slapstick, sentiment
that never cloys, gags and naughtiness a la Ernst Lubitsch with whom Wilder
had worked and whose major inheritor he became, though with original
creations rather than imitations.</P>
<P>The movie was beautifully and realistically filmed in France: Paris, the
Ritz Hotel,  the Studios de Boulogne, the Opera, the Chateau de Vitry, etc.
The score includes  (repeatedly!)the famous slow waltz "Fascination" by
Filippo D. Marchetti  (copyright 1901) used in a most amusing and
imaginative way.</P>
<P>Though an American production, LITA employed many fine French artists,
technicians and performers. Vienna-born Wilder who had his first career in
German-language films, emigrated to Hollywood (as many Jewish artists did)
when Hitler came to absolute power. Before coming to the USA however, he
spent a couple of years in Paris--where he directed his first film --and
understood very well the French and their wit, both very close to Wilder's
own.</P>
<P>The score (other than Fascination) was by one of the great Hollywood
composers, German-born Franz Waxman, who fled anti-semitism and reached
Hollywood about the same time as Wilder, ca. 1934.</P>
<P>What used to be called "art direction"  and now has become "production
design" is by Alexander Trauner, the best stage designer in France and one
of best in the world.  He makes a small, sub-cameo appearance in the movie.</P>
<P>Hubert de Givenchy (or at least his "Maison," i.e. his firm) provided the
dresses. Givenchy was one of the reigning fashion designers in the world,
known for his chic, discreet elegance (and later, his perfumes). It's worth
looking at the dresses closely and noticing that even in the case of
"schoolgirl" Hepburn, a middle-class, middle-income young lady, what she
wears, while looking appropriate, is subtly the product of Haute Couture.</P>
<PRE>A film not to miss.  (Edwin Jahiel)</PRE>
