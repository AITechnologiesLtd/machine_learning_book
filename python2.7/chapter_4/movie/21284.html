<P>Giuseppe Tornatore is difficult to ignore as a film maker. He may not be the
flashiest of directors, or the best of them, but there is one thing that you
can always count in his films.... a real story, that you can relate to, and
cry with/for/along. The Star Maker is no different a film.</P>
<P>It is a simple story. A man, drives a truck through the countryside in
Sicily, and films people doing screen tests. They do whatever comes to their
mind, and do a few poses for the camera. The man tells everyone that he is
sending the film to Rome, for it to get checked out by other film people,
who may hire some of these characters they see on a screen test.</P>
<P>And he gets out of many localities some really gems of performances, from
the eclectic, to the miraculous, to the odd, to the most unusual of
assortment of people, including a few Mafia people.</P>
<P>And one day, he meets a young woman that wants to go with him. She has real
dreams, and he is her escape. It doesn't matter that all these people paid
for this audition, and that they couldn't afford it. All it matters is that
they have their one shot at being seen and loved. And they all take that one
shot. Another day, a police chief tries it. He is not as gullible as most
people and goes through the whole thing. Later on, in the film, the young
man finds himself arrested. The policeman has done some checking on him.</P>
<P>( Spoiler Alert ) The story turns into a really sad one. He is beaten up by
the Mafia family, who was going to rob and kill him. And is thrown in jail
for a couple of years. In the meantime the young girl who loves him dearly,
is not doing well. When he gets out of jail he sets about trying to find
her, and  seeing if they can save anything. She is in an institution, partly
damaged because her dream has crashed hard.</P>
<P>This sad film, has its truly beautiful moments, and I am of the opinion that
Tornatore's desire is to ask if it is such a bad thing, when one man can
wake up people, so well, like he does, even if the camera has no film in it
at all, or of it does, he has damaged it, one night while threading it. And
the questions arise... is it right for anyone to wake up people's dreams,
and leave them hanging? Will people be the same? Most will. But some will
not. But, generally, they all enjoyed doing what they did, and would do it
again in a minute for a chance to make it in film, be it real or not.</P>
<P>Wonderful film, in many respects, it is photographed beautifully and has
some magnificent moments to share with us. One may have wished that there
had been some poetic justice in the end, but it seems that hope just is not
one of the choices in Italy, specially in Sicily, it seems.</P>
<P>Worth seeing, although the last few minutes are sad. Ends on a positive
note.</P>
