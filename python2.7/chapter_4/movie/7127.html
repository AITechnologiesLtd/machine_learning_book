<P>     During the Fall of 1996, while channel surfing late one night, I 
recall stopping on HBO when I recognized Ashley Judd.  I put down the 
remote control and tried to figure out what the film was.  The more I 
watched, the more intrigued I became.  This wasn't the usual late-night, 
direct-to-cable fare.  It was a motion picture of some intelligence and 
insight.  I didn't find out its name, NORMAL LIFE, until it was over.  
And it wasn't until weeks later, when it received a blink-and-you'll-
miss-it run in about a half-dozen markets, that I learned the story 
behind the movie.</P>
<P>     For some reason which even now is unclear, Fine Line Features, 
NORMAL LIFE's distributor, elected not to release the film in theaters, 
opting instead for a run on HBO.  This infuriated director John 
McNaughton (HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER), who claimed that he 
never would have directed the movie had he been aware of Fine Line's 
intentions.  So, to placate him, the company gave the film a very 
limited theatrical release.  Without publicity or advertising, it was 
dead-on-arrival, and was pulled after one week.  Few movie-goers had an 
opportunity to see it.  Now, NORMAL LIFE is out on both video cassette 
and laser disc, and its availability should generate a wider audience.</P>
<P>     NORMAL LIFE is a character study loosely based on a true-life crime 
spree that occurred in Chicago's western suburbs.  Since I don't live in 
or around Chicago, and don't remember any headlines about the situation, 
I can't say how closely NORMAL LIFE sticks to the facts.  Ultimately, it 
doesn't really matter.  NORMAL LIFE is compelling because of the 
characters and their twisted, co-dependent relationship, not because it 
falls into the often-sordid category of having its narrative built 
around a real criminal case.</P>
<P>     Those characters are the husband-and-wife team of Chris and Pam 
Anderson (Luke Perry and Ashley Judd), and NORMAL LIFE tells their story 
over a two year period.  The two meet in a bar one night when Pam has a 
fight with her boyfriend and cuts her hand on a broken glass.  Chris 
comes to the rescue, bandages the wound, then asks her to dance.  For 
their first "official" date, they go to a shooting range, where Chris, a 
police officer, teaches Pam how to fire a gun.  Soon thereafter, they 
are married, and that's when the trouble begins.</P>
<P>     Despite having the good looks of a cheerleader, Pam is not the 
perfect wife.  Sexually, she's frigid; emotionally, she's unstable.  Her 
self-destructive tendencies cause her to trash the apartment she shares 
with Chris, play Russian roulette, and, eventually, threaten to kill 
herself.  Yet, through all of this, her husband sticks by her, never 
flagging in his support.  There's something about Pam that holds him in 
thrall.  He's determined to be her savior, no matter what the cost.</P>
<P>     Chris loses his job and Pam's profligate spending traps the couple 
in an ever-widening vortex of debt.  To save them, Chris robs a bank.  
Then another.  Then another.  It's easy for him -- he's good at it.  
Soon, he and Pam have paid off their creditors and moved into an upscale 
townhouse.  Then, by chance, Pam finds out about her husband's new 
source of income.  The idea excites her.  She joins him in a robbery 
and, afterwards, experiences her first-ever orgasm during sex.  But the 
pattern of self-destruction returns, and the resolution is inevitable.</P>
<P>     Have I given away too much of the plot?  Not really, since the 
film's non-linear chronology begins near the end, then flashes back to 
the beginning.  NORMAL LIFE isn't really about whether Pam and Chris get 
away with their crimes -- they don't, and that point is never in doubt.  
Rather, it's about how they relate to each other, and how Pam's manic-
depressive behavior destroys not only her own life, but Chris' as well.  </P>
<P>     Why would someone stay with a woman like this?  Watching Ashley 
Judd's wrenching, uninhibited portrayal of Pam, it's easy to understand 
the reasons.  Buried beneath the madness, there's a sweetness and 
vulnerability that cries out for protection and nurturing.  Chris is 
drawn to that like a moth to a flame, and the outcome is just as 
gruesome.  Luke Perry, giving the most convincing performance of his 
career to date, makes it clear how desperately, hopelessly smitten Chris 
is by his wild, troubled wife.</P>
<P>     I have watched NORMAL LIFE twice now (well, one and three-quarters 
times, to be precise), and I don't understand Fine Line's decision 
regarding the movie's distribution.  Maybe they felt it was too intense, 
but it's this intensity that draws the audience in.  Perry and 
especially Judd do amazing jobs and McNaughton once again proves that he 
is capable of presenting an unconventional, psychologically-true picture 
of criminal behavior.  By depicting the sham of "normality", NORMAL LIFE 
reminds us how fictitious and unattainable the "American dream" can be.</P>
