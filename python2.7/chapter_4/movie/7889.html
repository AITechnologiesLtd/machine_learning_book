                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>
<PRE>I cannot say I am a Jim Carrey fan.</PRE>
<P>I believe the problem lies in the fact that his overacting has a
tendency to kill any good elements of plot or dialogue in his films.
More often than not Jim Carrey tends to overwhelm everyone and
everything in his films so much so that it becomes suffocating to watch.</P>
<P>However, I am relieved to say that 'Liar Liar' has somehow survived the
loud, colourful, overdone antics of Carrey. The story brings out simple
but important issues about life like keeping your promises, loving your
children and of course being honest. These are the things which are most
admirable about the movie, beside the fact that it is also very
entertaining.</P>
<P>This is Carrey's best work since 'The Mask'. Sometimes I just wish he
would tone down a little, but I guess 'that thing he does' is what makes
people love him as much as hate him.</P>
<P>This is a must for high powered executive fathers who have little time
to spend with their kids. Don't make the same mistake or your children
may just end up making a wish worse than not being able to lie for an
entire day.</P>
