<P>     A fair indication of the quality of DR. JEKYLL AND MS. HYDE can be
gained by looking at its release date: Labor Day weekend--where bad
movies go to die.  Studios never release anything good during the first
weekend in September because they recognize that theater patronage will
be poor, so the only new pictures are leftovers discarded on the
cinematic summer scrap heap--movies destined to be forgotten
immediately.  Remember Matthew Broderick's OUT ON A LIMB?  Or Sherilyn
Fenn's BOXING HELENA?  Or how about Patrick Swayze's FATHER HOOD?
Those were classic Labor Day weekend pictures--just like DR. JEKYLL AND
MS.  HYDE.</P>
<P>     This is about the dozenth film based on Robert Louis Stevenson's
THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE, and undoubtedly one of the
silliest (beating out even ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET DR. JEKYLL AND MR.
HYDE).  Filled with double-entendres and other crude humor, the movie
is aimed even lower than at the DUMB AND DUMBER audience.  The premise
of a man taking a potion and turning into a woman is tacky enough to
begin with, but, in this case, very little of the shallow comic
potential is translated into laughs.</P>
<P>     It's 1995 and medical science has advanced since the original Dr.
Jekyll performed his tragic experiment.  Now, some 110 years later, his
great grandson, Dr. Richard Jacks (Tim Daly), is doomed to repeat his
ancestor's mistakes.  Richard thinks he has discovered Jekyll's error,
but when he drinks the potion, the transformation that takes place is
unexpected--not only does this version of Hyde exhibit psychopathic
tendencies, but it's a she: the voluptuous and deadly Helen (Sean
Young).</P>
<P>     A movie this dumb needs a fair share of successful comedy to make
it worth anyone's viewing time.  Unfortunately, in DR. JEKYLL AND MS.
HYDE, the guffaws are far apart.  There are some chuckles--including a
hilarious cameo with actor/writer Robert Wuhl--but hardly enough to
make this motion picture worth the price of admission.  On top of that,
the acting is uneven.  Although Tim Daly is suitably likable, Sean
Young plays a surprisingly weak femme fatale.  Harvey Fierstein and
Steven Tobolowsky, as Richard's bosses at a perfume manufacturing
company, have a few amusing scenes, but Lysette Anthony gives too
serious a performance as the doctor's fiancee.</P>
<P>     Strictly speaking, DR. JEKYLL AND MS. HYDE is late-night cable TV
fare.  It's the kind of movie someone might willingly pause for in
post-midnight channel surfing, but not the sort worth paying for.  It's
a poor execution of a bad take on a stale premise.  The idea was
interesting when Stevenson's book was first published, but, after so
many adaptations and rip-offs, it has gotten as flat as Tim Daly's
deflated chest.</P>
