<P>If schlocky horror director William Castle ("House on Haunted Hill") had
directed Ira Levin's bestseller "Rosemary's Baby," it would have had minor
shock effects and some scare tactics. It might even have included a hovering
demon baby and black carriage in the theatre! Such is the style of Castle (who
appears briefly in a phone booth scene) and the difference is lucidly
demonstrated in Roman Polanski's adaptation and direction of this chilling,
slow-paced horror film - a distinguished classic in a genre that has been
cheapened in the ensuing years by gore and more schlock.</P>
<P>"Rosemary's Baby" begins in New York City where a couple, Guy and Rosemary
Woodhouse (respectively played by the late John Cassevettes and Mia Farrow)
rent a high-rise apartment. They are introduced to their new home by the
superintendent (wonderfully played by Elisha Cook, Jr.).  Things go wrong from
the get-go.  There is a dresser obscuring a closet, voices and chants are
heard, various shadows are seen on walls, a young woman is found dead in the
street, and so on. The dead woman, a runaway, had lived with the next-door
neighbors, the Castavetts, who adopted her.  The Woodhouse couple meet the
next-door neighbors for dinner as a sign of respect, an affable old couple who
dress in loud outfits, Roman and Minnie Castavett (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth
Gordon). They are talkative, nosy people and have conflicting opinions about
Catholicism and the Pope. As they talk over dinner, the wise Roman curiously
remembers Guy's supporting role in the play "Luther": 'I was struck by a
gesture you made. It had a wonderful sense of authenticity'. Roman also seems
to have been a former businessman who has travelled all around the world.
Minnie is simply nosy, and almost every time she appears, Beethoven's "Fur
Elise" is playing in some tenant's piano.</P>
<P>While the film progresses, there is a growing feeling of something unnatural
about to take place. Rosemary undergoes physical and emotional changes in her
character, from cropping her hair in a "Vidal Sassoon" style to getting
pregnant. Her pregnancy is handled by two different doctors: one is Dr. Hill
(Charles Grodin), a "Charlie nobody" as Guy calls him, and there is the reknown
Dr. Saperstein (Ralph Bellamy) who prescribes herbal drinks and tanis root for
Rosemary. 
Meanwhile, Rosemary's husband Guy grows distant while successfully landing
numerous acting jobs, though he occasionally brings her flowers as a sign of
love. Her good family friend, Hutch (Maurice Evans), discovers that her
neighbors are in fact part of a coven of witches. That could explain the
scratches on Rosemary's back and some of her weird dreams where she is raped by
Satan (actually played by the late founder of the Church of Satan, Anton La
Vey)! Slowly, Rosemary begins to believe that the Castavetts are after her
unborn baby. </P>
<P>Polanski places a great deal of ambiguity in "Rosemary's Baby" making us feel
as though Rosemary is simply paranoid and is imagining that there is a
conspiracy, and that her husband is one of the conspirators. There is a sense
of unease and unseen menace in the film thanks to Roman's claustrophobic
direction and cinematographer William Fraker's disorienting compositions (my
favorite being the hallway shot of Minnie making a phone call to Dr.
Saperstein, showing that she is partially obscured by the entrance door to the
bedroom so that we never see her face). Throughout the film, we are never sure
if the supposed coven of witches mean well or if they intend to do harm - could
they care a little too much about Rosemary? Is Guy's stoic demeanor a sign that
something is wrong? Could Hutch's suspicious be erroneous? Or is Rosemary going
crazy a la Catherine Deneuve's similar state of paranoia in Polanski's
"Repulsion"?</P>
<P>"Rosemary's Baby" was reviled by Catholic groups back in 1968, condemned for
its view of Satanism (maybe the shot of the Time magazine cover with the "God
is Dead" title did not help). Otherwise, it was critically well-received and
placed Roman on the star director map leading to many more Hollywood offers.
After more than thirty years, "Rosemary's Baby" still retains its implicit
power of genuine forces of evil unseen by Rosemary's eye, including the famous
final sequence which still rattles the nerves. For its unnerving sense of doom
and menace coupled with sharp doses of black humor, you can do no better than
this baby. This is Polanski at his devilish best. </P>
