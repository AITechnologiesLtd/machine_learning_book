<P>Susan Granger's review of "WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S 'A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S
DREAM'" (Fox Searchlight Pictures)</P>
<P>  Without doubt, Shakespeare is the most sought-after
screenwriter in Hollywood. And why not? The game-playing of his
characters and their efforts to grapple with reason and love seem
quite contemporary, and Shakespeare neither contests re-writes nor
demands royalties. Writer/director Michael Hoffman's clever adaptation
of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is set in Tuscany around 1900,
coinciding with the advent of the bicycle. The plot deals with love in
all of its comical and fantastical forms, complicated by fairy
jealousy, love potions, and misbegotten romances. The wondrous evening
begins with Duke Theseus' involvement in a dispute involving Hermia
who loves Lysander but is being forced to marry Demetrius, who is
adored by Helena. In the forest, there are five amateur thespians
rehearsing "Pyramus and Thisbe," plus the love game between Oberon and
Titania, the King and Queen of the Fairies, complicated by the
trickster sprite Puck. There have been at least six film versions of
this 400 year-old play, including one with 11 year-old Mickey Rooney
as Puck, but this vibrant, all-star cast dazzles, particularly Kevin
Kline, Rupert Everett, Michelle Pfeifferand Stanley Tucci. Curiously,
Calista Flockhart transforms the obsessed Helena into another version
of her whining but spunky Ally McBeal character; her mud-wrestling
scene with Anna Friel, complete with clinging, wet clothes could only
be called bizarre. "What fools these mortals be!"  On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "William Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's
Dream'" is a mischievous, whimsical 9. It's a charming, frothy frolic
that captures the enchantment and delight of Shakespeare's most
magical comedy.</P>
