<P>"Some people say [CAFE AU LAIT] is racist because they don"t like to 
hear people saying 'dirty Jew' or 'dirty black' or 'dirty Arab,' but 
that's the way it is.  That's the way people talk.  I'm not going to 
moralize.  I'm not going to say, 'Don't be a racist.'  Anyway, I don't 
think people are racist.  But we all have racist reactions.  Little 
things set off a clash and then everyone takes a position." 
          - Mathieu Kassovitz, writer/director of CAFE AU LAIT </P>
<P>     The original title of CAFE AU LAIT, a droll, occasionally
innovative comedy from first-time French director Mathieu Kassovitz,
was METISSE.  Literally translated, "metisse" means a female
half-breed.  While CAFE AU LAIT is perhaps more poetic, METISSE is more
to the point.  In either case, the title refers to the film's main
character, a light-brown-skinned woman by the name of Lola (Julie
Mauduech).</P>
<P>     Lola has two lovers:  Jamal (Hubert Kounde) and Felix (Matthew
Kassovitz), neither of whom knows about the other and both of whom Lola
claims to love.  The pair of men are diametric opposites.  In a
flip-flop of traditional racial stereotypes, Jamal, a black Muslim, is
urbane, wealthy, and intelligent; while Felix, a white Jew, is unkempt,
poor, and uncultured.  It's shoes versus sneakers, suits and ties
versus sweatsuits, and Wagner versus rap.</P>
<P>     Complications arise when Lola invites both Jamal and Felix to her
apartment at the same time on the same evening.  Not only do they meet
each other, but they learn that Lola has a little surprise:  she's
pregnant, and she doesn't know which of them has fathered the child.
Needless to say, neither has a moderated initial response.</P>
<P>     After careful consideration, however, both Jamal and Felix realize
that they want to be part of Lola's life and, to accommodate her
wishes, they attempt to put aside their own differences and unite in a
rather atypical family situation.  The result is not unlike THREE MEN
AND A CRADLE, except in this case, the baby hasn't arrived yet, and
there are only two "fathers."</P>
<P>     Part of the reason for CAFE AU LAIT's success is that Kassovitz
keeps the tone light.  Despite an occasional depiction of racist
circumstances, the director avoids creating a "message" movie.  There
are moments when CAFE AU LAIT turns your attention to the issue (such
as when a pair of cops think Jamal stole a car because of his skin
color), but most of the time the film devotes itself to showing harmony
between races rather than discord.  When Jamal and Felix toss around
racial epithets, the closeness of their relationship dissolves the
sting.</P>
<P>     The unforced quality of the humor is refreshing.  Kassovitz has
imbued his script with wit, and sometimes the funniest lines come in
the least expected places.  On one occasion, Jamal, in an attempt to
prove to Lola how much more similar he and she are than she and Felix,
makes the impassioned declaration:  "*Our* grandparents were slaves."
With her characteristic breezy air, Lola counters, "*Your* grandparents
were diplomats."</P>
<P>     In Lola, Jamal, and Felix, Kassovitz has sculpted a trio of
believable characters who are effectively realized through the strength
of three solid performances.  The players interact well, not only with
each other, but with the small group of supporting cast members (the
scenes between Felix and his sister Sarah, played by Eloise Rauth, are
priceless).  And, while Lola's relationships with her two lovers form
the basis of the film, it's the bonding between the men that lies at
its core.</P>
<P>     Although CAFE AU LAIT contains elements of Spike Lee's films (most
notably SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT), the movie is by no means derivative.
While most of Lee's pictures have an undercurrent of anger and
intensity, Kassovitz tries for nothing more imposing than a
good-natured serio- comedy.  By his own admission, he finds French
films boring, and looks for inspiration from the likes of Monty Python
and Woody Allen.  The fruits of this philosophy are visible here:
Kassovitz has something to say, but he uses laughter, rather than
something more ponderous, as the medium, and it turns the substance of
CAFE AU LAIT into something palatable to digest.</P>
