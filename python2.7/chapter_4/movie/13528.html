<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>This film is ample proof what a first rate actor can do for a film that is
basically nothing, to begin with.</P>
<P>Were it not for the subtle, polished, and so very clean work that the two
experienced actors in this production show, this film may have otherwise
fallen apart.  But with Marlon Brando, and Faye Dunaway, this film takes on
different proportions, which
are rather unusual, and turn what might have been a so- so film into
something rather nice to watch, at least for people who have a taste for
impeccable acting work.</P>
<P>This is the story of a young man who thinks he is Don Juan, the legendary
lover.  But he is having problems, he has fallen in love with one particular
woman, and he is now living in a mental institution where some doctors are
eager to drug up the young man, and put him away. But Dr. Minkler has
different thoughts. He engages the young man's trust and takes helps him
come through his hard time. In the process the young man affects the
doctor's own private life which has become stale.</P>
<P>A simple story, all in all, but by the time you get a hang of both Marlon
Brando and Faye Dunaway, as his wife, this film  takes on different
proportions.  And it is their acting that
keeps this film going. One doesn't even recognize Faye Dunaway, and it is
such a surprise that she is so smooth in this film rather than the showy
actress that she has been for so long.</P>
<P>As the story develops the doctor is discovering that his stale marriage is
all of a sudden becoming a bit more exciting and that they are starting to
enjoy each other a little more... and much of the credit goes to the young
man that is on the edge of being instituted.  He has an incurable
romanticism that is hard to let go, that affects many of the people around
him.</P>
<P>It is a pleasure to watch such a magnificent actor in this film do his
thing. He is so relaxed, and so well prepared that if forces everyone around
him to do that much better. And his relationship with his wife, which
appears to be boring at the start, turns out to be a really nice match of
actors, that work their way through things rather nicely, and it is a
pleasure to watch.</P>
<P>The film is nicely directed with a few touches here and there, and a
noticeable lack of close ups so that we do not get so emotionally involved
with the young man. With such a  great pair of actors around him,  it is
hard not to enjoy this film.</P>
<PRE>Excellent acting all the way around</PRE>
