<P>The setup is familiar: a group of characters land themselves in a
boatload of trouble and devise a simple plan to get out of it. The plan,
needless to say, never goes as intended, and hence the plot of the
movie. A SIMPLE PLAN, directed by Sam Raimi (DARKMAN), is entirely of
this vein -- as the title indicates. But even more so, it's a fine
example of a stylishly directed thriller: screenwriting, camerawork,
editing, and sound all come together to make this movie a truly
involving experience. </P>
<P>Bill Paxton headlines a cast of noteworthies as Hank Mitchell, an
educated Midwesterner struggling to make ends meet. His wife Sarah
(Bridget Fonda) is expecting a baby, and his job at the local grain mill
may not cover their expenses. His brother Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton) is
even worse -- he hangs out with the town drunk, Lou (Brent Briscoe), and
lives in a derelict apartment. So it's a fortunate turn of events for
the threesome when, out hunting, they find over four million dollars
inside a snow-covered plane wreck. Lou and Jacob want to spend the money
immediately, but Hank insists on keeping the money until spring; if no
one comes looking, then each man will get his share and they'll all
leave town. </P>
<P>When it wants to be, A SIMPLE PLAN is a very gutsy movie. Most of the
time, however, it relies on subtlety to create a tense atmosphere. For
instance, most of the paranoia and incriminating doubt that the
characters experience is completely unnecessary -- the characters build
it up inside of themselves. Similarly, the writing in certain scenes
(such as the one where Hank and Jacob attempt to evince a confession
from Lou) is shrewd to the point of impossibility; the Scott Smith
script runs in circles before it hits the viewer in the face. On the
other hand, it also calls for stark imagery like a flock of ravens
attacking Hank or several bloody shooting deaths. But most importantly,
the biting irony of the script's ending should not be missed. </P>
<P>The cast is well-chosen. Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton work well
together, and their contrasts and similarities are what anchor the
movie. In most respects they're different individuals, bound only by
their family name, but in the movie's brief moments of character study
it's possible to see their likenesses. Interestingly enough, Jacob is
often a much more intelligent character than he appears; his role, from
start to finish, is an extraordinary one. Thornton masters it in fine
form. Other supports are also effective, especially Bridget Fonda as
Hank's wife Sarah. </P>
<P>A SIMPLE PLAN is not unreasonably complex, and can only be faulted for
occasional moments of dullness. There are a number of possible Academy
Award nominations for this picture, although they will certainly it will
certainly be the dark horse. Certainly a worthwhile watch. </P>
