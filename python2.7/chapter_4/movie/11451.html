<PRE>AIR FORCE ONE (1997)
A Film Review by Daniel Chodos

<P>The concept of "Air Force One" is taken directly from the book of cliche.
But, y'know, there's a reason for cliches and why so many films revolve
around them -- they work. They make for good solid, entertaining stories.
But the negative connotation of the word cliche comes naturally with time
and overuse. Here we have Harrison Ford playing the President of the United
States who mumbles his way through a declaration of war on terrorist. His
plane, with family and all on board, is then hijacked. And we're off to the
races!</P>
<P>It's the same old routine to boot when our heroic president sacrifices
himself to save the plane and avert the evil Russian terrorist plans.
Instead of developing a character to root for, "Air Force One" relies on the
audience's patriotic obligation to cheer on our hero. He's the president,
represents America's resiliency in the face of danger, so we're clinging to
our arm rest with every terrorist he encounters, right? Wrong.</P>
<P>One thing "Air Force One" has going for it is terrific casting. The film is
a star vehicle as the audience wants to root for Harrison Ford more so than
the cardboard role of President Marshall. Everything plot related i.e. the
"bigger" picture such as some confusing scenes with the Russian prisoner
ends up being lost making the film not amount to much. The movie defines the
"been there done that" syndrome. I for one was hoping the President turned
out to be a coward, sacrificing his country and family to save his life. At
least that would have been refreshing.</P>
