<PRE>URBAN LEGEND</PRE>
<PRE>A review by Robert Strong</PRE>

<P>The only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that
the film had a lot of potential and could've been effective.
Such is the case with _Urban Legend_, the new horror film from
first time director Jamie Blanks.  The idea behind the movie is
that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various
urban legends.  Examples include the killer in the backseat of the
car and person getting calls from inside her house.  The killer wears 
one of those L.L. Bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up, so
you can't see the face.  I guess Halloween masks are out of style
for psychos these days.  Anyhow, the premise is certainly a nifty
one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric.  It's a very
good setup that promises more chills to come.  Unfortunately, the
film never takes off from there.</P>
<P>The movie takes place on a peaceful New England college campus.
Like most slasher flicks, this one also centers around a young
female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a 
knife wielding maniac (or in this case an axe wielding maniac).
I've always wondered why these killers don't save themselves a lot
of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately
aim to kill.</P>
<P>After the fine first scene, the movie degenerates into a monotonous
series of those annoying you-thought-it-was-the-killer-but-was-just-
someone-else scares.  These are always accompanied by loud bursts of
music.  I guess sudden, sharp music chords are what passes for terror
these days.  The actual killer will attack at about every third 
music blast.  The slasher appears, attacks, the victim is eviscerated,
and the tedious cycle appears anew.  False scares should always be used
in moderation.  Someone needs to tell director Blanks that things like
this just aren't as scary as they used to be.  This movie commits the
biggest sin a horror film can commit--it's not frightening.</P>
<P>Remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in 
_Scream_ and _Scream 2_?  This movie still adheres to them.  Tons
of illogical moments about; more than I really have the inclination
to list.  And I don't mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie
sense.  That type of illogical can be fun.  This film insults your
intelligence more times than I care to remember.  The last 20 minutes
especially degenerates into such lunacy that you'll be laughing more
than you'll be screaming.  Actually, you won't be screaming at all.
At its best, the acting can barely be called "adequate" and the script
could've definitely used a rewrite or two.</P>
<P>The film still manages to have some strong points.  The killings are
certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans.
There are some intentionally funny moments.  (These were exceeded by
the unintentional ones.)  The film is well made from a technical
standpoint.  Besides the first part, there is also another good scene,
a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station.  If there had
only been more sequences like this, that relied on tautness and 
suspense rather than loud bursts of music, _Urban Legend_ might've
been worth your money.</P>
