<P>Courtroom drama is an overrated genre. Flashy images often come to mind
at the mention of such a setting -- Tom Cruise grilling Jack Nicholson
on the stand in A FEW GOOD MEN -- which are often followed by powerful,
moving images -- Gregory Peck's majestic voice in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.
But after a true count, the courts have given reason for a number of
shoddy products that lack substance and are filled with gimmick. THE
RAINMAKER, for example, featured the hotshot, know-it-all character
played by Danny De Vito: it was fresh, but unoriginal. Perhaps this
history, then, is the reason that Steve Zaillian's latest film, A CIVIL
ACTION, is a rewarding experience. </P>
<P>There's nothing gimmicky about Zaillian's sophomore effort (his debut
film was 1993's SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER). Everything is a cold
reality, from the cutting-block calculus of personal injury law (John
Travolta explains in a series of voice-overs the relative worth of
different clients and concludes that a child is worth the least of all)
to the admitted lack of justice in the court system. Gone is the Perry
Mason-style grandeur, and with it the delivery of great orations.
Instead, a large percentage of the movie's running time does *not* take
place in a courtroom but in the real world of depositions and field
work. </P>
<P>Travolta is our star, playing real-life lawyer Jan Schlichtmann.
(Indeed, all of Zaillian's script is based on a true story, as told in
Jonathan Harr's book.) Jan is well-dressed and successful, named in a
magazine as one of Boston's ten most eligible bachelors. Perhaps
unfortunately for Jan, he happens upon the Woburn drinking water case,
brought to his attention by Woburn resident Anne Anderson (Kathleen
Quinlan). As it happens there's a large number of leukemia deaths in
Woburn, which Anderson and other town parents believe is related to the
drinking water. Jan traces the water back to its source, where he finds
-- mostly by serendipity -- a tannery which has been illicitly draining
waterproofing chemicals into the town's water supply. Now all Jan has to
do is prove it in court. </P>
<P>Seemingly against his own advice, Jan becomes emotionally entrenched in
his own case. He carries on his crusade longer than his partners advise,
to the delight of his auspicious adversary, Jerome Facher (Robert
Duvall). It's here that the actors shine: Travolta and Duvall, in the
leading roles, carry on a solid competition; Travolta in particular is
much recovered from previously bland outings like PRIMARY COLORS and MAD
CITY. The supports are also sturdy as well -- William Macy as Jan's
financial advisor is the best. Kathleen Quinlan's performance is a bit
of a disappointment, but aside from that it's hard to find fault with
this picture. Some might find it a bit slow or a bit long, but overall A
CIVIL ACTION is a well-written, well-directed product that has hit its
mark.</P>
