<P>     PASSOVER FEVER follows the trials and tribulations of a secular 
Israeli family as they gather for the traditional holiday celebration.  
As is true every year, Yona and Michael Starr are hosting the event.  In 
addition to the middle aged couple, present in the house are three sons, 
one daughter, one son-in-law, two daughters-in-law, one ex-daughter-in-
law, one possible soon-to-be-daughter-in-law, two grandsons, two 
granddaughters, one baby, and one mother.  There are almost as many 
stories as there are people.  In many ways, PASSOVER FEVER is 
reminiscent of Jodie Foster's HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.  In this case, 
however, the script is better written, with believable characters and 
situations.</P>
<P>     A bleak undercurrent lurks beneath PASSOVER FEVER's seemingly-light 
tone.  Like MURIEL'S WEDDING, Sheri Zarhin's feature uses comedy to 
address serious subjects.  This film is neither relentlessly cheerful 
nor unbearably downbeat, but somewhere in the middle. However, in 
striving for numerous issues of substance, PASSOVER FEVER may overreach 
itself.  With so many subplots and characters, it's difficult to devote 
enough screen time to any of them.  </P>
<P>     Yona suspects that Michael may be unfaithful.  One of the Starr 
children, Nathaniel, is divorcing his wife, who is well-liked by 
everyone in the family.  To further complicate matters, Nathaniel brings 
his new girlfriend to Passover dinner with him.  One of the 
grandchildren can't speak as the result of some psychological trauma, 
another is praying for snow, and a third feels horribly neglected.  A 
daughter-in-law, who is battling weight problems, becomes increasingly 
despondent as she feels she's the butt of everyone else's jokes.  And, 
above all these proceedings looms the ghost of Yizhar, the twin brother 
of Yona and Michael's son, Shaim, who died two years ago in an army 
accident.  As things turn out, this Passover gathering becomes about 
making peace with the dead.</P>
<P>     Sheri Zarhin has crafted a diverting drama that is almost entirely 
devoid of political overtones.  Its themes are universal, and can be 
easily understood by any viewer, regardless of race or nationality.  
Zarhin has assembled a fine cast (including well-known Israeli actress 
Gila Almagor) and gotten the most out of his $700,000 budget.  The 
result is a satisfying chronicle of the kind of crazy, unpredictable 
holiday gathering that just about everyone can relate to.</P>
