<P>François Ozon's latest feature is shocking because it's not the slightest
bit shocking.  Anybody who has seen Criminal Lovers, a crazy cross between
Badlands and Hansel & Gretel, knows Ozon can make films that are just as
controversial and disturbing as Hannibal or Freddy Got Fingered.  But Under
the Sand is quite a departure from Lovers - is it maturity, or the desire to
build an eclectic filmography?  Who knows, but if you're expecting something
similar to Ozon's previous films, you might find Sand to be a bit slow and
tedious.  As long as you don't mind the lack of unsettling content, viewers
should find the film to be an interesting story with a terrific lead
performance.</P>
<P>The film opens with a scene more than a little reminiscent of With a Friend
Like Harry, which was written and directed by Ozon's fellow countryman
Dominik Moll.  It shows a husband and wife driving to their vacation home,
but, unlike Harry, the couple is older, have no children and enjoy a quiet
ride. After taking a break at a rest stop, they finally make it to their
destination without uttering so much as a word to each other.  Although they
travel in silence, you can clearly tell that Jean (Bruno Cremer) and Marie
Drillon (Charlotte Rampling, Aberdeen) are a happily married couple that
have become accustomed to each other's little quirks and routines.</P>
<P>Then again, things aren't always what they seem to be (just ask the guy who
won the last Presidential election).  One day, while enjoying the sun and a
book on a quiet beach, Jean decides to take a swim.  Several hours pass
before Marie notices he hasn't returned.  She alerts lifeguards and the
police, but nobody can find her husband.  Was he done in by the strong tide,
or was foul play involved?  Perhaps Jean was unhappy and ran off to start a
new life in a new city, or maybe he was suicidal.  With no body and no
evidence, Marie and the police are unable to jump to any conclusions.</P>
<P>Sand then flashes forward several months, where Marie has returned to Paris
and resumed her career (she teaches English literature) and her social life.
We see her at a friend's dinner party, where she fields compliments from a
potential suitor named Vincent (Jacques Nolot), but notice that Marie is
still referring to Jean in the present tense.  When she gets home, Jean is
there, and Marie carries on as if the whole beach incident never happened,
leaving more unanswered questions.  Did Jean fake his death for insurance
money?  Is Marie off her nut and imagining that Jean is still alive?  Or
maybe we're seeing Jean in flashbacks?  Things become more mysterious when
Marie has an affair with Vincent and begins to incorporate him into the
routines we previously saw her engage in with Jean.</P>
<P>As the truth becomes clearer and clearer, we're treated to a wonderful
performance from Rampling, who, at 56, still looks amazing, and Ozon's
direction doesn't let you forget it.  People who complain that there aren't
any decent roles for middle-aged women need to check this film out (so do
Gena Rowlands fans, who will be amazed by the resemblance of actress
Alexandra Stewart, who plays Marie's friend).</P>
<P>Although Sand is quite a departure from Lovers in terms of both content and
the way they were shot (the former is almost drab compared to the latter's
flamboyant colors), it's certainly a step forward in Ozon's direction,
leaving the world holding their breath in anticipation of his next project.</P>
<P>1:32 - Not Rated, but contains nudity, strong sexual content and adult
language</P>
