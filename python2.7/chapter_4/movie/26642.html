LUCKY NUMBERS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In LUCKY NUMBERS, by director Nora Ephron (YOU'VE GOT MAIL), Russ 
Richards is a local celebrity who has it all, right down to an omelet 
that a diner has named after him.  The television weatherman at a 
station in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, he is so popular that everyone 
wants to take his picture.  "Fame, fortune and my own private parking 
place -- I had it all," he tells us in voice-over.</P>
<P>Well, he did have it all until he made a major investment in snowplows 
during an unseasonable winter warm spell.  Now facing bankruptcy, he has 
gone from being a cocky guy who loves to ham it up with bad jokes to a 
petrified worrier who is willing to risk imprisonment to save his lavish 
lifestyle.  He has big plans to be a famous television game show host, 
so he doesn't want to let a negative net worth get in his way.</P>
<P>Working again with Ephron, as he did in the sappy MICHAEL, John Travolta 
appears this time as Russ, a lovable doofus without any hint of wings.  
Travolta's over-the-top character is as likeable as he is stupid.  In 
fact, the warm weather seems to have fried everyone's brains.  A few 
bright characters would have made for a nice contrast.  </P>
<P>Tim Roth, as Russ's nefarious criminal friend, is significantly 
underutilized.  Great at playing bright but explosively dangerous 
characters, Roth is given almost nothing to do other than chop 
vegetables in the kitchen of a sleazy nightclub.  Any action is 
delegated to a hit man whom he has on speed dial.</P>
<P>As the Vanna White of the Pennsylvania Lottery, "the lotto ball girl," 
Lisa Kudrow is Crystal Latroy.  Wearing tight-fitting, sequined dresses, 
slit way up the side, Crystal is syrupy sweet on camera and foul-mouthed 
tough off camera.  In short, Kudrow plays Kudrow but as a slightly 
darker version of her usual ditzy blonde character.  The comedic 
jousting between Travolta and Kudrow make for some of the movie's most 
entertaining moments.</P>
<P>The heart of the story is a big scam to rig the lottery.  Precisely how 
the money is to be divided up becomes the picture's longest running 
joke.  Documentarian Michael Moore (ROGER & ME) gets a nice small role 
as Crystal's asthmatic cousin, who is paid to redeem the winning ticket.</P>
<P>The problem with LUCKY NUMBERS is that the audience's lucky numbers 
don't come up nearly often as they should.  Many scenes are inspired, 
but most just drag on without any comedic payoff.  There are so many 
minor characters and subplots that you want to take a pair of scissors 
to the print and cut some of the them out.  An overgrown bush of a 
picture, it is in bad need of pruning to let the best flowers have the 
light to bloom.  </P>
<P>The best moments are silly fun, but there just aren't enough of them.  
When you go to your local multiplex's box office, pick another number 
and wait for video on this one.</P>
<P>LUCKY NUMBERS runs 1:40.  It is rated R for language, sexuality, some 
drug use and brief violence and would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
