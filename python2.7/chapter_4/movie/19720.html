<P>IN SHORT: The Return of the Big White Suit</P>
<P>CrankyCritic.com doesn't put the dollar rating on reissues. This being
the 15th anniversary of the release of the Talking Heads concert film,
Stop Making Sense is reason enough to re-release the old chestnut, with
an upgraded sound mix and video remastering to CD, DVD and other such
modern initialed tech like that. Which means I get to wax nostalgic and
talk about my days in the music biz and, more important, I get to tell
you about Stuff I Like.</P>
<P>The hard part about reviewing concert films is twofold: It isn't fair to
the performing artist if the reviewer couldn't care less about the
music. It isn't fair to the reader if the reviewer is an unabashed fan,
and doesn't tell you. So, in the interest of full disclosure: Cranky
likes the Talking Heads. He played their first records on college radio.
He produced an appearance on the King Biscuit Flower Hour syndicated
concert series, and met both David Byrne and Jerry Harrison of the band,
back around 1980. If I wanted to wade through the pre-computer
paperwork, there is probably a review of Stop Making Sense from its
first release back in 1984. I never saw the band live.</P>
<P>Raving fan? No, not at all. The Talking Heads were an acquired taste.
TH'77 and Fear of Music were difficult albums to listen to, because the
Talking Heads didn't sound like anything else that had been pressed in
black in the Seventies. When you're young, it only takes a song or two
to make you go back to an album looking for more gems, and tracks like
"Psycho Killer" and "I, Zimbra" (or "Don't Worry About The Government"
and "Life During Wartime") were better than good starting points. When
the band as a whole discovered funk in the early 80's, collaborating
with Parliament's Bernie Worrell among others, the change seemed so
radical it threw us off. Now, we'd call them "ahead of their time".
Truth is, the band was always ahead of the great curve. But not so far
ahead of the fans that we couldn't keep up.</P>
<P>Stop Making Sense captures the Talking Heads at the peak of their
powers. Live, the Heads took their music so far beyond anything captured
on vinyl that the only disappointment was that the original soundtrack
delivered only half the film's music. Cranky is informed that the
re-release of the CD contains the whole megilla. If you've sprung for a
DVD player, that's on its way too. Let's talk about the film . . .</P>
<P>The first thing that comes to your mind, if you're old enough to
remember the original theatrical run, is the Big White Suit that David
Byrne sports in the show. Odds are you, like Cranky, confused the
numerous parodies of the suit (on whatever teevee comedy shows were in
vogue at the time) with reality. The suit doesn't show up until close to
the end of the show, and it wasn't as huge as I remember. But that isn't
the wildest thing about Stop Making Sense, version 1999.</P>
<P>The wildest thing was sitting in a packed, private screening room with
40 or so other reviewers, watching all but one of 'em try not to move at
all while the concert unspooled. Byrne, who spoke briefly before the
screening, said he was surprised when the remix was shown at the San
Francisco Film Festival earlier in the year because the audience got up
and started dancing. Cranky doesn't understand his surprise. Even if you
only roll the soundtrack, regardless of whether you like the studio
albums or not, it's hard to keep in your seat. The Stop Making Sense
soundtrack album is a kickass groove start to finish. In its perfect
creation of an audience POV, you don't have to be close to the screen to
get the feeling that you're at a Talking Heads concert. The need to
dance will follow naturally.</P>
<P>As a snapshot of where the band was in December 1983, Jonathan Demme's
film stands as what some rock critics have labeled it, one of the best
rock concert films of all time. It is, as with Martin Scorsese's The
Last Waltz, one of few concerts that were designed to be photographed on
film. Unlike Waltz, Stop Making Sense confines itself strictly to the
performance stage. From David Byrne's entrance onto the bare stage, with
acoustic guitar and boom box in hand, for a solo performance of Psycho
Killer through the song by song assemblage of stage set and performers
-- Tina Weymouth (bass) joins Byrne to duet on Heaven as black clad
stagehands wheel out instrument platforms for Chris Franz (drums) and
Jerry Harrison (guitars and keyboards) -- and touring bandmembers stroll
out to their positions, Stop Making Sense takes on all the qualities of
a theatrical presentation.</P>
<P>Even better, until an audience shot at the very end, you never see a
film camera in any shot, a practice in other films that always bothered
me. The actual cinematography, by Jordan Cronenweth (and restored by his
son Jeff), is remarkable because is uses the actual stage lighting of
the show, rather than bringing all the f-stop levels up to the norm by
pouring light out of fills. Byrne and Demme headed back into the mixing
room and brought their work up to 1999 technical specs. Now with full
surround sound, the audience reaction wraps around you as does the
music, like a loving mother.</P>
<P>Happy happy joy time. Play it all night long.</P>
<P>[If there's no Laserdisc release, Cranky may have to shell out for DVD
