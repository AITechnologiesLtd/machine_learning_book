<PRE>"Pearl Harbor"</PRE>
<P>"Pearl Harbor." We have been hearing about this event film for over a year
and finally, like a plague of locusts, it has descended on theaters
everywhere. Director Michael Bay has parleyed his estimated $135 million
budget into a 3-hour tome that, I have to say, I could have done without.</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong. I knew that the draw for "Pearl Harbor" would be the
much-discussed special F/X and computer graphics used to depict the
Japanese sneak attack on the slumbering battleship fleet of the US Navy
stationed at the Pearl. I expected that Bay and "Braveheart" scripter
Randall Wallace would shoot for an old-fashioned romantic yarn to wrap
around the action that we're there to see. They do this but, unfortunately,
the tale we get is bland and insipid, with little dimension given to the
players in what amounts to a romantic triangle with a backdrop of war.</P>
<P>I'll get to the kick-ass F/X in a minute, but I really want to complain
about the story and its inherent silliness. I knew things were going to be
cliched and little more when, early in the film, fighter pilot Rafe
McCaully (Ben Affleck) gives his beau, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), an origami
bird to remember him by. My immediate thought was, "An origami bird? That's
stupid!" It turned out to be the kick off gesture of the contrived yarn
that is to come.</P>
<P>The huge cast is lost in the turmoil of the telling of the story as the
setup is made for the pending attack while the individual stories of the
stars unfold. Cocky Rafe, on the verge of love and war in the Pacific,
takes an offer by the British to join the American Eagle squadron to do
battle with the Nazis in Europe. He becomes missing-in-action and his best
friend, Danny (Josh Hartnet), must break the bad news to Evelyn. Danny
can't help being smitten with the beautiful Evelyn, but propriety and the
memory of Rafe keeps him from acting hasty. As the months pass, the two
can't help but fall in love. Then, Rafe miraculously appears on the scene
and the triangular romantic angst surfaces. The lack of life given to the
characters keeps this core story from ever getting off the ground.</P>
<P>If you are patient, though, and don't mind spending your movie-going
dollars on the 35-minute long extravaganza of the attack on Pearl, you will
have a visual treat, at least for a little while. From the moment that the
Japanese lead pilot signals "tora, tora, tora," you are in for some of the
most action packed, violent eye-candy we have seen since the opening of
"Saving Private Ryan." As a matter of fact, there is more than passing
borrowing from that Spielberg film, James Cameron's "Titanic," "From Here
to Eternity" and a myriad of Hollywood war movies from the 40's and 50's.
Too bad Bay garners the most mediocre of these contributing elements.</P>
<P>Historical accuracy has never been high on the list of things-to-do for
Hollywood filmmakers and that tradition continues with "Pearl Harbor."
History mavens will be, gleefully, all over this movie like ugly on an ape.
Details like the paint jobs on the Japanese Zeroes, the types of ships
anchored in the harbor, the kinds of uniforms and more will be scrutinized,
closely. Erroneous details like the presence of Admiral Yamamoto aboard the
attacking carriers or President Roosevelt rising out of his wheelchair
unassisted will make some cringe. But, it's about what I expect from the
man that brought us "Armageddon." Oh, yeah. I almost forgot that it's not
just about the attack on Pearl. Once that is over, the makers tack on an
extended sequence depicting Jimmy Doolittle's daring raid on Japan, a la
Mervyn LeRoy's "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo." With a few more bucks added to
the budget, Bay could have added the Korean War, too.</P>
<P>Special F/X and a bunch of money do not make a good movie. There has to be
a story, a believable one at least, to attach everything to and that does
not happen here. "Pearl Harbor" bombs and I give it a C+.</P>
