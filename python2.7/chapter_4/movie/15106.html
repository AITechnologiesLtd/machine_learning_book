<P>   Say what you want about cell phones--how intrusive they
are, how bad-mannered their users who seem to prefer to
speak on the phone rather than to the people they're with--
the lovable foursome that star in this movie could have sure
used one.  "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer" has
its fair share of scream-scenes like its predecessor, "I Know
What You Did Last Summer," and ups the ante with more
atmospheric geography and a mystery murderer who is as
responsible as the guy with the hook for the pileup of bodies. 
"I Still Know..." is directed and written by fresh hands but its
core performers--Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze,
Jr.--are amiable holdovers from the box office smash that
took in $125 million earlier this year.</P>
<P>   Most of the action takes place on a remote Bahamian
island (actually filmed on an earthquake-torn resort two and
one-half hours' drive south of Mexico's lovely Puerto
Vallarta).  This is an ideally secluded location for stabbings,
shootings and hangings, particularly with the phones all dead
and a hurricane insuring that no outside help will disturb the
glorious mayhem.  Since its principal character, Julie James
(Jennifer Love Hewitt) has purportedly wasted a fisherman
who preferred to catch human beings on his large and
threatening hook, she is plagued by hallucinations and
nightmares and can scarcely know them from reality.  After
the traditionally scary opening scene, this one taking place in
a church confessional to which Julie has retreated to
acknowledge her role in a killing, she receives the first good
news in a while.  Her best friend Karla (Brandy) has just won
four tickets to a remote island in the Bahamas for guessing
the capital of Brazil on a radio contest.  (If you think
something is fishy in her answer, "Rio de Janeiro," you might
be the only one in the predominantly teen-aged audience to
presume so.)  When Julie's main squeeze, Ray (Freddie
Prinze, Jr.) plays hard to get, she settles for handsome Will
Benson (Matthew Settle) as her roommate while Karla invites
her favorite beau, Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer).  </P>
<P>   Director Danny Cannon knows how to give a Hitchcockian
air to an island-style Bates Motel, where the four young
people run into a hotel with a manager, Mr. Brooks (Jeffrey
Combs), whose distaste for teenagers leads him to express
some of this movie's few witty lines: "I see four spoiled city
kids who would not know a hurricane if it blew up their ass." 
Brooks, whose hotel is empty because of the approaching
hurricane, gives the quartet the two honeymoon suites and
advises them that if they need help, he has "a marginally
trained staff of five" to serve them.  </P>
<P>   Like the previous blockbuster, "I Still Know..." follows the
usual conventions of the horror genre, playing up the false
alarms in the opening scenes while piling stress upon tension
the closer it approaches its climax.  The usual scenes of
savage butchery are there, courtesy of Ben Willis's (Muse
Watson) prosthetic arm, and nine bodies pile up at strategic
points along the way.  The killer could have done away with
the object of his disaffection several times but prefers to
torture her, at one point by sealing her into a coffin-like sun-
tanning box and turning up the juice.  But the most endearing
torment occurs as Julie performs in the hotel's karaoke bar,
the song lyrics on the screen suddenly changing to "I Still
Know What You Did Last Summer."</P>
<P>   It's a strange thing about these slasher movies.  The
heroes are usually people about the age of twenty.  The
formula is followed to the letter, and in fact, in this case, most
of the conclusion is predictable as soon as Ray takes off from
his job and heads for the tropics.  Yet because the youthful
performers know how to project abject fear while at the same
time projecting their thirst for revenge, we care about them
and get caught up in the tautness.  This time around, you're
going to be surprised by the identity of the second killer in a
movie with a good deal of humor supplied by Mekhi Phifer,
whose idea of action has nothing to do with the fisherman's
agenda and with special joie de vivre by Brandy Norwood as
the excitable gal who may not know the capital of Brazil but
who is so charming that the radio d.j. gives her the prize
anyway.  "If anyone asks," she counsels, "Don't tell 'em it
rained all the time."  Here's a young woman who at the age
of 20 already knows how to make the homebound friends feel
envious and wish they were there.</P>
