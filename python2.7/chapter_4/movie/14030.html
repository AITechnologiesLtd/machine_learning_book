      Be forewarned. </P>
<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   The moral dilemma in RETURN TO PARADISE looms everpresent throughout
   the picture's middle hour, inextricably tightening a noose around its
   protagonist's neck.  More ethical examination than suspenseful
   potboiler -- its sparse location usage and reliance upon persuasive
   conversation to facilitate the high drama result in a nagging
   resemblance to a filmed stageplay -- this is a sober morality play
   told in shades of gray.</P>
<P>   In earlier days, where rectitude in the movies was as subtle as the
   black and white ten-galloners worn in westerns, the course of action
   would be automatic: if the lead had the means to spare a condemned
   man's life by owning up to his involvement in the crime and turning
   himself in, by God, he bit the bullet and did the time.  It's the
   sort of selfless display which plays as suitably noble in a
   simplified world but is implausibly straightforward for a brooding
   take of modern realism.</P>
<P>   Sheriff's (Vince Vaughn) quandary is even more deliciously sticky.
   As informed by advocate Beth (Anne Heche), Lewis (Joaquin Phoenix) is
   scheduled to hang in eight days as a drug trafficker, but a deal has
   been struck to spare his life if his two cohorts return to Malaysia
   and accept their culpability -- three years imprisonment each if they
   both surrender, but six years should only one decide to face the
   music.  Sheriff, of course, doesn't want to see Lewis die -- but,
   then again, neither does he particularly want to rot in a jungle
   prison; wouldn't it be less messy if Tony (David Conrad) went back to
   do the honours instead?</P>
<P>   It's an ethical predicament made all the more delicate by the set of
   circumstances: the male trio only vaguely know each other, having met
   during a fleeting comradeship two years ago.  Sheriff's indirectly
   responsible for Lewis' death sentence -- the discovery of his
   sloppily-discarded brick of recreational hash pushed Lewis over the
   legal limit, designating the crime as trafficking rather than mere
   possession -- but still, the instinct of self-preservation is strong
   enough (especially in a New Yorker) that it's difficult to make this
   sort of sacrifice for a close friend, let alone a long-ago associate.</P>
<P>   While the film doesn't browbeat -- the filmmakers are smart enough to
   realize that while the audience wants Sheriff to do the right thing,
   it may very well be a hypocritical sentiment -- it's not exactly
   subtle with its characterizations.  Even a virtuous man put in this
   dilemma would have second thoughts, so to depict Sheriff as an
   amoral, looking-out-for-Number-One character is unnecessarily
   heavy-handed.  Not only is he not the nice-young-professional sort
   that Tony is (who even has a sweet fiancee -- talk about tipping the
   scales), but Sheriff's also apparently the kind of shifty guy that
   gets confronted in restaurants by angry ex-lovers and even prompt
   fathers to expect the worst.  Sheesh.</P>
<P>   Sheriff's character arc, then, is tidily well-defined and
   consequently apparent from the outset: initally directionless, the
   crisis prompts him to experience a personal awakening, stirred from
   his moral reverie by the growing realisation of his own
   self-involvement and the love of a good woman.  This last element, in
   particular, struck me as superfluous; the love story, though
   thematically appropriate, is narratively jarring and lends little
   catharsis to the film.</P>
<P>   Still, despite the scenario's obvious setup, the lack of any evident
   urgency (the days are counted down with occasional onscreen
   subtitles, but even a permanent running chronometer wouldn't add
   enough tension to overcome the lackadaisical pacing), and the
   inevitable outcome (though its antecedent -- it's based on the 1990
   French film FORCE MAJEURE -- often teases at a more oblique course),
   it nonetheless sustains interest as the cerebral chess game of
   pursuit and evasion develops between Sheriff and Beth; beneath their
   posturing, their arguments often seem to be as much to convince
   themselves as they are to sway their intended parties.</P>
<P>   The picture falls apart in its final reel, full of melodramatic
   revelations and twists unworthy of the preceding intrigue, but the
   actors do what they can to salvage it.  This is a particularly
   well-cast film -- Jada Pinkett Smith's characteristic verve is nicely
   channelled into controlled insistence as an ambitious news hound,
   while Mr. Phoenix turns in a vivid performance as the martyr Lewis;
   beneath his menacing features, he conveys the same innate sweetness
   as exhuded in his impressive breakthrough performance in Gus Van
   Sant's TO DIE FOR.  Ms. Heche, splendid actor and uncanny
   presidential barometer (she starred in WAG THE DOG when tensions
   increased in the Gulf and L'Affaire De Lewinsky first broke, and now
   appears here in a film dealing with a man coming to terms with taking
   responsibility for his past actions and submitting himself to
   inquisition -- boy, I can't wait to see what happens when her PSYCHO
   hits theatres) is in fine form with a quiet, focused intensity.</P>
<P>   At the end of the day, though, it all feels a bit slight.  RETURN TO
   PARADISE is terribly earnest and well-intentioned, but it doesn't
   quite achieve the degree of gravity or profundity that it strives
   for; it's an agreeable 110 minutes which involves for the duration,
   but vaporizes from the mind shortly thereafter.</P>

"...a first screenplay unaccompanied by a powerful agent or industry
 sponsor is generally a pathetic fetus of a film, nothing more."
