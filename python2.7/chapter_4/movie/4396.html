<P>     The curious thing about FATHER OF THE BRIDE II is that not only 
is it the sequel to a remake, but it's the remake of a sequel.  As such, 
it's a perfect illustration of stretching an idea too far.  Certain 
premises lack the necessary material for a multiple features, and this 
is one such example.  As FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND (upon which this 
screenplay is based) paled in comparison to the original FATHER OF THE 
BRIDE, so this production is an uninspired follow-up to its immediate 
predecessor.</P>
<P>     FATHER OF THE BRIDE II is proof that there's a limit to how 
much life can be coaxed from a feel-good formula.  While the 1991 Steve 
Martin movie was good for ninety-plus minutes of undemanding fun, the 
second chapter is stale and overflowing with treacle.  Shot by 
cinematographer William Fraker with warm, golden tones, it's a 
celebration of suburbia as the ultimate culmination of the "American 
Dream."  </P>
<P>     The overriding theme of this film is identical to that of the first 
FATHER OF THE BRIDE:  letting go of a child.  Previously, Steve Martin's 
George Banks had trouble accepting that his daughter, Annie (Kimberly 
Williams), was ready to enter into a marriage with nice guy Brian 
MacKenzie (George Newbern).  Here, when Annie announces that she's 
pregnant, George finds it difficult coming to grips with the realization 
that the baby will cement Brian and Annie's family, further distancing 
him from his beloved daughter.  A secondary issue is briefly raised 
about George coping with the approach of his fiftieth birthday, but it's 
quickly dropped after George learns that not only is he about to be a 
grandfather, but his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) is going to have their 
third child.</P>
<P>     I have often said that, in a comedy, much silliness and sappiness 
can be forgiven in the service of solid humor.  But, while FATHER OF THE 
BRIDE has a few genuinely funny moments, it spends entirely too much 
time trying to be dramatic.  The result is that the recycled sentiment 
becomes overwhelming -- so much so that Martin himself jokingly refers 
to his clan as the "schmaltz family."  Trite lines like "Thanks for 
marrying me, Nina" and "Life isn't gonna get much better than this" 
pepper the screenplay.</P>
<P>     Martin and Keaton are appealing separately and together, but their 
relationship got all the development it needed in part one; here, 
they're treading water, trying to keep the film afloat by sheer screen 
presence.  It's not enough.  Kimberly Williams all-but-fades into the 
background.  Outside of her scenes with Martin, she's pretty much 
invisible.  Would that the same could be said about the duo of Martin 
Short and B.D. Wong (reprising their roles from part one), whose 
exaggerated accents and mannerisms go far beyond being irritating -- and 
scenes with these two are supposed to be comic highlights...  To add 
insult to injury, Eugene Levy is on hand as a caricature of a greedy 
Arab who's almost as offensive as Short's Franck Eggelhoffer.  One 
bright spot is Jane Adams' on-target portrayal of a competent 
obstetrician.</P>
<P>     In the Age of Family Values, FATHER OF THE BRIDE II will be 
welcomed with open arms by the likes of Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole (who 
will probably praise it without seeing it).  There's nothing "morally 
indecent" about the film -- no profanity, no sex outside marriage, and a 
healthy dose of hugs and smiles.  That FATHER OF THE BRIDE II isn't 
a particularly engrossing motion picture won't make much difference to 
that crowd.  Or, judging by the enthusiastic audience response, to the 
portion of the American public that laps up whatever Hollywood puts out, 
regardless of how unoriginal and artistically empty the product is.</P>
