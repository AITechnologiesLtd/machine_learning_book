<P>"Small Soldiers" is probably the first film to actually satirize the entity
known as kiddie violence, at least on a major scale, and therefore it kind
of grabs our attention when it skewers the way we are sometimes fed
different kinds of propaganda via cartoons and various other kinds of child
entertainment just because it's the first to really hit it hard.  Luckily
enough, this isn't a "message movie," and it's not naive enough to totally
blame characters like G.I. Joe, the epitomy of right-wing,
moral-yet-immoral, John Wayne-esque propaganda; it's really just an
extremely entertaining film with an outrageously wonderful premise with an
eerie, unsettling edge that at once freaks you out and leaves you in
stitches.</P>
<P>No shock that this is from Joe Dante, the hilarious wizard who directed one
of the all-time great kiddie horror films, "Gremlins," a hilarious film
that is all the more hilarious the older you get...and, to a slightly
lesser extent, "Gremlins 2: The New Batch," which skewered Ted Turner-esque
media all while wreaking totally hilarious havoc.  He takes the same kind
of approach to his story that he did with the latter one: this is a film
that almost gets off on mocking military "intelligence" by telling the
story of a bunch of gung ho soldier toys with a microchip that allows them
to act like real army guys, including attacking humans.  Only they're
smaller.</P>
<P>The story behind it deals with a huge company owned by the deliciously
inhuman CEO Gil Mars (Denis Leary), who orders his two toy division heads,
Larry Benson and Irwin Wayfair (Jay Mohr and David Cross, the latter who's
half of HBO's "Mr. Show"), to create a line of action figures who can
really act and talk like all they do in all the commercial ads that make
toys look incredibly exciting.  By getting a special army microchip off the
web, they are able to make their toys respond like human beings, and gives
them each set standards.  There's the Commando Elites, a group of
overly-patriotic soldiers led by the Patton-esque Chip Hazard (voiced
brilliantly by Tommy Lee Jones), and featuring the supporting voices of
cast members of "The Dirty Dozen," as well as Bruce Dern, tossed in for
good measure; and then there's the wimpy monster Gargonites, led by the
stoic Archer (voiced by a now-British Frank Langella), and featuring the
voice talents of...well, the three chief members of "Spinal Tap" (Harry
Shearer, Christopher Guest, and Michael McKean, just for the record). 
These two are at war with one another, though the odds are totally in favor
of the soldiers.</P>
<P>Cut to a little town somewhere where a young kid named Alan (Gregory Smith,
from "Krippendorf's Tribe") is running his dad's collapsing old-school toy
shop while he's away on a business trip, and who mistakenly steals a box of
these toys from the friendly truck driver (Dante regular, Dick Miller) to
sell quickly so that the store makes some money for a change.  Soon enough,
the toys have escaped, ruined the store, and are about to wreak havoc on
Alan, his almost-girlfriend Christy (a glowing Kirsten Dunst), and the
homes of their parents (played by Kevin Dunn, Ann Magnuson, Wendy Schaal,
and the late Phil Hartman in his last performance) as they war against
eachother.</P>
<P>The obvious reason to see this film is for its wonderful sense of humor,
which, for the most part, is how the film is played out.  Instead of an
un-subtle attempt at really trying to overturn cartoon violence and its
affect on youth (which would have made for an annoying right-wing
crapfest), "Small Soldiers" decides to use that as a way of mocking
patriotism and basically the whole military as a concept.  The Commando
Elites are all portrayed as being the bloodthirsty villains of the film,
who attack anyone who merely stands up for the Gargonites, who are all in
hiding for fear of defeat.  And the film never wastes a moment at really
just digging deep and making fun of war movies.  We have two really
hilarious standouts, other than the obvious parody of "The Dirty Dozen," a
film that actually mocked military intelligence as well.  Those are a
hilariously inspired scene that is straight from "Patton," complete with
the theme music, a giant jig-saw American Flag consuming the background,
and even lines lifted directly from the opening speech in the film; and a
laugh-inducing parody of the chopper scene from "Apocalypse Now," complete
with the Wagner music and "I love the smell of polyurethane in the
morning."</P>
<P>Dante has always loved to parody other movies, but he also parodies
sociological things as well, like America's obsession with war (hands-down
funniest line, said by Phil Hartman: "I think World War II was my favorite
war"...at least I laughed, no one else did), and even some post-"'burbs"
satirization of suburbia, complete with the on-going battle between the
beauty of nature and the beauty of a 12-foot satellite dish sitting in your
lawn and the horror of having a tree block its reception.  When this film
sticks to parody and satirizing, it's one of the most entertaining
experiences in a real long time.</P>
<P>However, when the film shifts to the melodrama of Alan's parents not
understanding him, or even the required love story of the film between Alan
and a way-more-mature Christy (I'm sorry: he looks like he's 12, and she
looks like she's 17 - doesn't work).  It's not that this truly a bad thing
and the film is never unwatchable, but these scenes serve as distractions. 
It'd be nice if the script or the actors, especially the by-the-books
Gregory Smith as the lead, had as much umph in their delivery as Kirsten
Dunst does (she's just lovable), these scenes wouldn't be so hard to intake
after the high satire of the idea of toy soldiers attacking real people
with nail guns and flame throwers.</P>
<P>It just doesn't help that the Gargonites aren't really that interesting
either, save for a couple of moments when the rest of them are finally
allowed to do their schtick.  It's here where the film only makes attempts
at deepening itself with questions of humanity in these characters, and the
obvious depth it brings to the military plot (the heroic soliders are pure
evil while the ugly monsters are pure good), but other than that, there's a
little to much started that isn't finished by the end.  It's like some of
this film is played straight, yet the rest of it is played totally for
laughs.</P>
<P>It's the second part that really works.  The comedy of the two toy creators
scrambling around to avoid a lawsuit.  Phil Hartman trying to get the most
out of his satellite dish.  The numerous incarnations of toys coming alive
(the whole barbie subplot, featuring voices by Sarah Michelle Gellar and
Christina Ricci, is definitely a howler).  Anything featuring the soldier
toys.  And la grande finale, an exciting, vicious battle between the two
families and legions of toys armed with deadly weapons that may be too much
for younger children, but would pretty much be fine for older children
(hey, it's PG-13 for a reason, okay?).  These are the things that really
work for this film, and luckily enough these great parts greatly outweigh
the more mediocre parts of the film.  What we have here is a return to form
for Dante, who has been kinda slumming it since the 80s, but is now back
again making kiddie films for the older crowd who can still take their
older children and probably laugh and have a better time than they will.</P>
