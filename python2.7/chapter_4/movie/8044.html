<P>"The Saint" is probably one of the most mindless and typical of the modern
Hollywood thrillers. It has a dashing hero, a beautiful damsel in distress, a
villain from the cliche vaults, and an overly complicated plot which
conviently provides for lots of action and special effects. But it is not
these elements alone that make it mediocre, the film is just not interesting
or impressive to begin with.</P>
<P>The film opens with a flashback to establish the main character's "origin."
The setting is an old Catholic orphanage where the priests and nuns aren't
just mean, they're evil. One boy refuses to go by his Catholic saint name, so
he is  beaten and the children's food is locked up until he complies with the
priest's demands. But the child is clever and brave as he leads the children
on a revolution of sorts. This scene did not serve any purpose at all. It
seemed to be the worst case of Catholic bashing I have ever seen and was
quite offensive. </P>
<P>We then skip ahead to the present day and meet the adult version of the
rebellious child. His  name is Simon Templar (Kilmer) and he seems much like
James Bond, but instead of being a spy, he is a thief. And since this is a
commercial film (with a huge budget) about espionage, the film tries to
impress us quickly  by having Templar attempt to steal a microchip from a
highly secured building in Moscow. Of course he must single-handedly beat all
the computer security systems (a la "Mission: Impossible"), fight a mobster,
fall 40 stories and land safely, and then proceed to outrun and outwit lots
of goons with Uzis.</P>
<P>The film then starts to form a plot as Templar's next assignment is to steal
the formula for cold fusion from an American scientist in London. Her name is
Dr. Emma Russell (Shue), a blonde bombshell who just happens to keep the
formula for cold fusion on some Post-It notes in her bra! It's obvious where
this film is going and it wouldn't have been so bad had it not presented
itself in such a serious manner. </P>
<P>Templar proceeds to seduce Russell and steal her formula, but after being
with her for only 24 hours the two seem to fall in love. Relationships in
thriller and action movies such as these are always taken seriously because
of the danger. Fear can be an erotic sensation, but here it is totally
shallow.</P>
<P>Ever since the Cold War ended we haven't had a Russian villain, so it was
actually a pleasure to have see one crop up. Rude Sebedzija co-stars as Ivan
Tretiak, a Russian mobster who will stop at nothing to get Russell's magical
formula. From the second act on, the film revolves around Templar and
Russell's escape from Tretiak and his son Ilya's (Nikolayev) goons. </P>
<P>Along the way we get a lot of violent chase scenes, passion scenes, scenes
that trick both the characters and the audience, but mostly a lot of
action-packed chase scenes.</P>
<P>Major motion pictures such as these often use complex plots to make the
viewer think it is an intelligent thriller when it's not. This film simply
plugs in the villains, the plotlines, and the action at all the right places.
None of these characters have much depth to them, their dialogue is too
"written" to take seriously, even the actors seem bored at times. When the
suspenseful, climatic scenes kick in, it's hard to be swept up in the
adventure because you don't care.</P>
<P>The plot to "The Saint" was so confusing I'm having a difficult time
recalling it, much less describing it. There isn't much to it, just another
high tech government thriller that happens to take place in modern Russia.
The reason most films of this genre fail is because they try too hard, this
film doesn't try hard enough. </P>
<P>(4/8/97) (6/29/97) [see also: "Mission: Impossible"]</P>
