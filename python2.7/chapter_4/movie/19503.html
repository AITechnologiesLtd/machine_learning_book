<P>The Happy Bastard's Quick Movie Review</P>
<PRE>MALLRATS</PRE>
<P>Is there life after Clerks?  Kevin Smith answers that question with this
comedy regarding the misadventures of two mallrats (Jeremy London and
Jason Lee) trying to get back the girls who broke up with them (Claire
Forlani and Shannen Doherty).  Along the way, they encounter plenty of
good and bad characters, like Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith
himself) and a crusty mall cop named LaFours.  Oh, and Stan Lee's in
here somewhere, too.</P>
<P>A lot of people seem to look at this movie and think it's a wasted
effort when reflected upon against the likes of Clerks, but, hey,
considering it's really Smith's second studio effort, it's a good show.
There's plenty of snappy conversation about, not to mention interesting
characters and situations.  Where else are you going to see Ben Affleck
act as a snotnose tough working at a FASHION STORE?</P>
<P>True, it's not as good as Clerks, but I think Smith was trying for
something different but same with this effort and hit the bullseye.
London and Doherty only deliver average performances, but Lee is a riot
throughout, Forlani is sexy as always, and, of course, Mewes and Smith
score as Jay and Silent Bob.  "Fly, fatass, fly!"  If you've seen Clerks
then you'll fully want to soak in the Mallrats, and if you haven't,
well, something's very wrong with you...</P>
