<P>     Watch Radha Mitchell long enough, and I'll bet you'll start seeing a
young Mariel Hemingway.  Watch HIGH ART long enough, and I'll bet you'll
start seeing a heroin-chic spin on PERSONAL BEST.  The "lesbian awakening"
genre may hardly rival the mis-matched buddy comedy in sheer weight of
numbers, but the conventions are just as conventional in their own way:
wide-eyed naif, experienced older woman, tentative first steps, heartfelt
discusson over what the wide-eyed naif really wants, oppressive
earnestness.  Been there, done that, seen it all.</P>
<P>     There's one thing in HIGH ART, however, that I can virtually
guarantee you haven't seen before:  Ally Sheedy as a Serious Actress.
Sheedy plays Lucy Berliner, a one-time shining star in New York photo art
circles who burned out and disappeared for over a decade.  Now living with
her heroin-addicted lover Greta (Patricia Clarkson) and a cadre of
perpetually stoned hangers-on, Lucy is inadertently re-discovered by her
downstairs neighbor Syd (Radha Mitchell), who also happens to be a young
assistant editor for a classy photo journal.  Realizing she's on to a
career-making scoop, Syd begins working with Lucy on a new layout, only to
find her fascination growing more personal and less professional with each
passing day.</P>
<P>     Sheedy's performance alone is nearly enough to recommend HIGH ART,
and you can color me as stunned as anyone that you're reading those words.
Sheedy inhabits the character -- a woman who wants to return to her art
but doesn't know if her past will permit it -- with an intensity only
autobiographical subtext can provide sometimes.  The impish grin of the
teen star of WARGAMES and THE BREAKFAST CLUB now nestles in the lines of a
haggard, drawn, aged-beyond-her-years face; you can see the spark under
there somewhere, ready for an opportunity to burst out.  The performance
is never showy, but Sheedy manages to capture both the resigned
co-dependence in her relationship with Greta (played by Clarkson as a
mumbling black hole of self-pity) and the glimmer of hope she sees for a
new life.</P>
<P>     Sadly, the rest of Lisa Cholodenko's script -- an inexplicable
award-winner at Sundance -- strands Sheedy's performance in a sea of
cliches and muddled relationships.  It also makes Syd's sexual awakening
the center of the story, then fails to develop the character with anything
near the necessary depth.  Everything about HIGH ART tells us we should
understand Syd's ambition, her emptiness, her readiness to be part of
Lucy's wasteland milieu, but Cholodenko assumes too much and shows too
little.  Even worse off is Gabriel Mann as Syd's stick-figure boyfriend,
who exists entirely to give Syd someone to argue with.  Like too many
screenwriters, Cholodenko assumes that situation will carry the story,
leaving us with characters whose relationsihps feel like plot devices.
Though the seedy art-clique atmosphere adds a different dynamic, HIGH ART
is still a formulaic film with little dramatic urgency.  The urgency that
does emerge comes entirely from Ally Sheedy, whose own awakening provides
a far more fascinating story than the one Cholodenko wrote.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 personal bests:  5.</PRE>
