CHUCK & BUCK
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>When Chuck and Buck were 11 years old, they were best friends.  Chuck 
long ago moved away.  He's now 27 with an important job and a lovely 
fiancée.  Buck, on the other hands, still has the social graces and 
mental capacity of an immature 11-year-old.  Most of all, what hasn't 
changed is that Buck still has a major crush on Chuck.</P>
<P>In Miguel Arteta's CHUCK & BUCK, one of the hits of this year's Sundance 
Film Festival, Buck is played with creepy innocence by the movie's 
writer, Mike White.  In a more straightforward role, Chris Weitz plays 
Chuck, a hard-working music promoter.</P>
<P>Although the film does have its moments, when it gets decidedly under 
your skin, most the movie is so devoid of energy that it rarely involves 
the audience.  Shot on videotape, the ugly cinematography has the look 
of a third generation tape copy.  The colors smear across the frame like 
a home video, which only calls attention to the amateurishness of much 
of the acting.  </P>
<P>After inviting Chuck to their old hometown to his mother's funeral, Buck 
follows him back to LA.  After taking up residence in LA, Buck, sucking 
on his signature red lollypop, starts stalking and voyeuring Chuck.  At 
first, at least, Chuck's fiancée (Beth Colt) is concerned about this 
child in a man's body who is obsessed with her future husband.  Later 
she becomes just as leery of him as her fiancé.</P>
<P>To make Chuck fully understand the feelings he holds for him, Buck 
writes an autobiographical play ("Hank & Frank") that rivals "Springtime 
for Hitler" from THE PRODUCERS for obnoxious banality, except that the 
latter was meant to be campy fun.  "Hank & Frank," however, serves only 
to remind us of how much worse the movie CHUCK & BUCK could have been.</P>
<P>The film's treacly music has a childlike happiness.  Sometimes it seems 
that the movie wants to transform itself into a parody, such as BUT I'M 
A CHEERLEADER, but it never does.</P>
<P>As the film slowly moves along, it does manage sporadically to shock and 
touch us.  But Weitz's overly obvious acting telegraphs its big surprise 
so badly that it takes the punch out of what should have been the 
movie's best scene.  </P>
<P>What we take away isn't the fear that some forgotten lover will come 
back to harass us.  Instead, what we are most likely to remember is that 
we don't enjoy going to the theater to watch images that look much worse 
than our own home videos.  </P>
<P>CHUCK & BUCK runs a long 1:36.  It is rated R for sexuality and language 
and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
