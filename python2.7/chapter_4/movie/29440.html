Directed by Jerry Zucker. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Watching Rat Race is like being invited to a big
party. There is so much glee in this infectious,
embarassingly fun farce that even the most cynical
will find themselves happily jumping on the bandwagon.
The film shames American Pie 2, which thought that
vulgarity was the end-all to comedy. In the
August-September movie doldrums, a notorious dumping
ground for studios with movies to get rid of, Rat Race
is a triumph of irreverence.</P>
<P>The movie has a great basic foundation: rich people
are really, really bored. The richest in the world are
willing to throw away money just for a quick day's
entertainment. Casino owner Donald Sinclair (John
Cleese) smartly latches on to this concept and comes
up with a game for the obscenely wealthy to play. He
will collect a group of people, divide them into teams
and give each team a key to a locker somewhere in New
Mexico, tell them that it contains two million dollars
and say the word "go." What better way to whittle away
time than bet on a human horse race where the
specimens actually want to reach the finish line?</P>
<P>The teams are Duane and Blaine Cody (Seth Green and
Vince Vieluf), brothers who have no conscience or
scruples; Vera and Merrill (Whoopi Goldberg and Lanei
Chapman), a recently reunited mother and daughter;
Nick and Tracy (Breckin Meyer and Amy Smart), an
aspiring politician and a helicopter pilot; Randy Pear
(Jon Lovitz) and his Perfectly Average in Every Way
Family; Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a
nationally humiliated football referee; and Enrico
(Rowan Atkinson), a narcoleptic Italian.</P>
<P>There is no real plot or story behind the skeleton
that gets the movie from A to B, but it works even
better as a series of hilarious, old-fashioned comedy
vignettes. Director Jerry Zucker, who is responsible
for what may be the most consistently funny movie ever
(Airplane), really lets loose, which no self-aware,
pop-culture-minded director would permit himself to
do. Where most movies deteriorate into simple chaos,
this one evolves into precise, thought-out, organized
chaos that never runs out of steam.</P>
<P>By the time the climax rolls around, greed has
completely taken over these characters, who have
abandoned any other life ambitions and aspirations
they may have had to get to that damn locker. The
denoument, which is a complete reversal of this, is
somewhat disappointing, but the journey there is one
delight on top of another. Suffice it to say that
Duane and Blaine wind up hanging off of a hot-air
balloon with a live cow, Templeton is chased by a mob
of Lucille Ball impersonators, the Pears drive
Hitler's car to a World War II Veterans Club meeting
and Vera and Merrill get punished for not purchasing a
squirrel. These scenes aren't expected to be funny on
their own merits (though they are), which is a mistake
a lot of films make; instead, Zucker puts them all
into brilliant context. I may not have believed it,
but I did laugh.</P>
<P>People undervalue the sophistication of this movie and
ones like it. To make a comedy, no matter how "dumb,"
that's timed so perfectly and works so effortlessly is
a deceptively difficult endeavor. Zucker is back, and
it's about time. </P>
