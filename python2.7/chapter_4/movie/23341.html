A Review by Akiva Gottlieb</PRE>
<P>In the next book written about cinematic voyeurism, a chapter must be
dedicated to the most sickeningly self-indulgent plot point of them
all: meet your character on the worst day of his life. With `Wonder
Boys', writer Steve Kloves (`Fabulous Baker Boys') and
director Curtis Hanson (`L.A. Confidential') have used the
infamous setup as a platform for an offbeat, entertaining film that
features a wonderfully deadpan comic tone.</P>
<P>Our protagonist, Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas), is a drug-addled
Pittsburgh writing professor with a lot on his mind. Firstly,
there's his love life. His wife has just left him, and his affair
with the school chancellor (Frances McDormand) has turned into an
unwanted pregnancy. Now he finds himself pressured into the hardest
act for a middle-aged man: commitment.</P>
<P>Then, there's his literary life. It's been seven years since
Grady's masterpiece `The Arsonist's Daughter', and he
hasn't written a novel since. This turns out to be a crucial
problem since Grady's literary editor, the smarmy homosexual Terry
Crabtree (Robert Downey, Jr.), is in town for the university's
annual Word Fest. As we soon learn, Grady has used these past seven
years to work on an untitled, 2000+ page magnum opus, which involves
`horse genealogies' and `dental records' In other words,
things can't get much worse for Prof. Grady Tripp.</P>
<P>That evening, Prof. Tripp attends the Word Fest opening reception,
held at the home of Sara Gaskell, the aforementioned pregnant
chancellor. While the professor snoops upstairs, he is attacked by the
Gaskell's beloved blind dog, who is then shot to death by James
Leer (Tobey Maguire), a bizarre student of Prof. Tripp. A few minutes
later, Grady and James are fleeing the scene in a car with a dead dog
and a transvestite's tuba (don't ask).</P>
<P>Like `American Beauty', `Wonder Boys' is a black comedy
about a mid-life crisis, and the success of this kind of film often
rides on the viewer's belief in the protagonist's
suffering. Michael Douglas' role in the film is as difficult as
Kevin Spacey's role in the superb `Beauty'. Douglas'
character is so apathetic to suffering that, on paper, a few of his
responses would be truly unbelievable. But Douglas brings such soul to
the role that he makes Grady Tripp come alive; turning us on to his
character without adding sentiment. In `Wonder Boys', Michael
Douglas gives a performance that is likable and genuine, and in a
perfect world, where even February films could compete for the Oscars
(imagine that), he would be in the running for an acting award. After
years of playing nothing but slimy rich guys, Douglas has finally come
into his own.</P>
<P>`Wonder Boys' also features a superb supporting cast which
includes Katie Holmes (`Teaching Mrs. Tingle'), Academy Award
Winner Frances McDormand (`Fargo') and the incarcerated but
unstoppable Robert Downey Jr. (`Less Than Zero'). However, the
kudos must go to Tobey Maguire (young star of `The Cider House
Rules' and `Pleasantville'), who showcases some nice
chemistry with Michael Douglas.</P>
<P>Curtis Hanson's `Wonder Boys' is a worthy follow up to his
classic corrupt cop saga `L.A. Confidential'. The two films
couldn't be more different in tone and manner, yet Hanson's
swift hand gives each its own distinct flavor. Cinematographer Dante
Spinotti, who also worked on `L.A. Confidential' (as well as
`The Insider'), sometimes uses a hand-held camera, which gives
the picture a life-like quality. Bob Dylan has also recorded a new
song for the film; his first new music since his Grammy winning
`Time Out Of Mind' album.</P>
<P>`Wonder Boys' is, of course, not without its flaws. The dialogue
is often bogged down by intrusive voice-over narration, and a couple
awkward scenes towards the end fall flat. Also, the interesting title
is never explained, and I believe it was lost in the translation from
book to film.</P>
<P>But `Wonder Boys' real problem has nothing to do with the
film itself. It is Paramount's marketing strategy, which has been
noticeably weak for such a strong film. The poster and trailer are
each dull as dirt, not giving a clue as to what the film is about. So
`Wonder Boys', a well-written film about writers, will have to
get by on the sheer power of word-of-mouth. See `Wonder Boys',
enjoy it, pass it on.</P>
