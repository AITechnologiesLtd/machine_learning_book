<PRE>"Welcome to Jarhead City." </PRE>
<PRE>     - Tom Berenger to William McNamara 
       as their characters arrive at Camp Lejeune </PRE>
<P>     Sad is the day when a new film from Dennis Hopper-- the man who 
helped defined a generation with EASY RIDER-- is heralded with hardly any  
fanfare.  Granted, CHASERS is not exactly industrial-strength movie- 
making, but Hopper's first film (as a director) since THE HOT SPOT is an  
mildly agreeable road-pic about a pair of Navy men (Berenger and  
McNamara) who run into trouble escorting a military prisoner back to  
base.  Shades of THE LAST DETAIL?  Not exactly. </P>
<P>     The story introduces Eddie Devane (McNamara)-- a swaggering smooth-
talker assigned to "chaser duty" on the day before his discharge. His 
orders are to report to gruff security officer "Rock" Reilly (Berenger) 
and assist in the transport of a "dangerous" prisoner from Camp Lejeune.  
What neither man knows is that their cargo (Eleniak) is female and better  
suited to the pages of Playboy than prison. That small surprise turns  
into a big problem when the boys discover that appearances are quite  
deceiving. </P>
<P>     There isn't much of a plot to CHASERS, and the script's idea of  
sophistication is clogging a fuel tank with tampons. What little story  
there *is* disappears somewhere in the second hour, but that's no problem  
because the leads are okay and they keep the chemistry going when the  
plot isn't. </P>
<P>     McNamara is the best of the bunch and the only one with anything  
resembling a character. He's fun to watch because he recalls a younger  
Tom Cruise with his doesn't-have-a-clue-and-doesn't-know-it smile.  
Berenger glares and growls through his "role" and Eleniak weakly smiles  
through hers. To be fair, the actress tries her hand at a couple moving  
monologues. Key word: *tries.* </P>
<P>     They hit the road in Jacksonville, North Carolina, and start south 
on a trip teeming with local color. Hopper's hopper is filled with 
monster trucks and BBQ huts and sign after sign for yet *another* Baptist 
church.  Anyone who's travelled the length of coastal Carolina can 
appreciate a fist-fight staged on a tacky miniature-golf green. (Is there 
any other kind?) </P>
<P>     The fringe also features a bevy of bit-parts including Hopper as a  
travelling salesman with more than just fabric samples in his trunk; Gary  
Busey as a Navy-hating marine; Dean Stockwell as a golf-playing Porsche  
salesman; and Crispin Glover as McNamara's nervous partner-in-crime. </P>
<P>     Together, they make one happy family that keeps CHASERS from sinking  
lower than it should. </P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:    CHASERS is an mildly agreeable road-pic about a pair of 
                Navy men who run into trouble escorting a military 
                prisoner back to base.  The guilty pleasure here doesn't 
                come from the leads, but, rather, from the local color 
                and a bevy of interesting bit-parts. </PRE>
<PRE>GRADE: C+ </PRE>
