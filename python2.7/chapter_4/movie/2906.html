<PRE>                                  PULP FICTION
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston

<P>     There is an axiom that directors who have a big hit with their
debut have a big bomb with their second film.  From Orson Welles to
Spike Lee and John Singleton, this has held true.  Quentin Tarentino,
who came out of nowhere to write and direct RESERVOIR DOGS has broken
that rule with PULP FICTION.  It shows no signs of being the work of a
young man struggling with too many ideas.  Instead it is the polished
work of an accomplished film maker.</P>
<P>     As the title suggests, the film is about the world of gangsters
and gamblers that populated the cheap paperback fiction of the
thirties, forties and fifties, updated to a somewhat nebulous modern
time.  Just as SHORT CUTS interweaved various highbrow story threads
into one somewhat convoluted and far reaching story, PULP FICTION
takes themes from Cornell Woolrich and Raymond Chandler, mixes them
with Seventies' TV and Fifties' movies into intertwining stories of
deals gone wrong and criminals searching for some bigger meaning to it
all.</P>
<P>     Surprisingly enough, John Travolta, considered by many to be a
has-been, or a one-hit wonder turns in the performance of his career.
As the hapless hitman who figures into all the story threads he holds
the film together.  Between jobs he rattles on constantly to his
cohort Samuel L. Jackson about the glories of life in Amsterdam and
eroticism of foot massages.  Jackson tends more towards quoting TV
shows and Blaxploitaion movies.  Travolta and Jackson encounter the
rest of the all star cast, most of whom really just have glorified
cameos in their own little story segments.</P>
<P>     The various story segments each reflect different elements of pulp
fiction genres- fixed fights, double crossed deals, dance contests,
narcotics, weird perversions, and mob hits.  Each story is really an
homage to a famous crime film, THE KILLERS , THE SET-UP and KISS ME
DEADLY, to name just a couple.  Even samurai films get a slight nod.
The stories quickly swings from surreal to absurd to profound, and no
story is  without its share of media savvy humor.  Almost all the
characters seem obsessed with the media.  Hitman Travolta points out
the difference between a Marilyn Monroe look alike and a Mamie van
Doren look alike.  Jackson quotes the "Kung Fu" series.</P>
<P>     Tarantino's ear for dialogue and eye for sight gags is priceless.
The little throw away lines and obtuse arguments that the characters
constantly get into are what make this sometimes ultra-violent film
worthwhile.  Just when you peg a scene as being routine, some odd comic
mishap sends the plot off in another direction.  Tarentino also uses an
odd non-linear narrative structure that leaves some important
unanswered questions, and then fills in the gaps by returning to some
plot threads, sort of like Kubrik's structure in THE KILLING, but not
quite as rigorous.  This structure works by keeping the pace steady and
building some suspense.</P>
<P>     While the film is, at close to two and a half hours, never boring
and a great success, it has a few minor faults.  A bizarre S& M scene
doesn't really match the offhandedly flip tone of the rest of the
film.  Another is that some of the highly hyped actors in the film have
little more than a cameo.  Uma Thurman is really just in two scenes,
Harvey Keitel in one, and Chris Walken has just a few lines.  And while
Tarentino scores big as both writer and director, he scores much less
an actor.  With actors of the caliber of Chris Walken doing bits,
Tarentino just doesn't hold up in his acting scene.</P>
<P>     Those minor quibbles aside,  it is easy to see why PULP FICTION
won the Palm d'or at Cannes.  It delivers on the potential that the
low-budget RESERVOIR DOGS promised.</P>
