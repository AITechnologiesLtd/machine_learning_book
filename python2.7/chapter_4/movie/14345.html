<P>If you are not a literature person, skip this film.  And if you don't care
about what freedom meant at the time when prohibition went beyond your doors
to tell you everything from behavior, to belief, then skip this film.</P>
<P>This film is about the anarchy of mind and body, which releases all tensions
and ideas, into an area of free thinking, and creative mind/body exercises
which in this case, became what today is considered literature.  Anais Nin
does not have her name in history of literature, as well placed as Henry
Miller's does, but her ability to chronicle the life of those around her,
and describe her own personal experiences, sexual, sensual, or otherwise,
set her apart, as a writer who could easily rival the seasoned material of
someone like LAWRENCE DURRELL ( the ALEXANDRIA QUARTET ) and D. L. LAWRENCE,
whose work we have read in school.  And more than likely, her position is
not established because she is a woman, in a world of publishers and artists
that was, and still is, ruled by men whose intent still may be questioned.</P>
<P>This is not a film about Henry Miller, June and Anais.  This is a film which
spends its time lovingly exploring that which becomes the writer's muse, and
as such, it is an excellent, and truly beautiful piece of work.</P>
<P>Henry Miller was depressed with the state of the affairs of art and
literature in New York, in the twenties and thirties, and decided to move to
Paris, to join a group of many writers and artists, and near the hot
cultural center which produced some of the most important and influential
artists of this century.  It was the SURREALISTS under the manifesto
published by Andre Bresson, who decided that art should be free of all
constraints, which gave us the likes of Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, Jean
Cocteau, and later the  generation of Jean Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Jean
Genet, Samuel Beckett,
and too many others to mention.  And it was in the many sidewalk cafes and
the many nights of sharing ideas, and visions, where many met, and entwined
their life's work into a sweet mesh of creativity, which still burns
brightly today.</P>
<P>In Paris, Henry Miller met Anais Nin, a happily married society woman, who
had a penchant for diary writings.  Henry enticed her to create a bit of
erotic literature.  Their affairs became one of true erotic adventures,
which added a different dimension to Anais' life and marriage, while also
helping Henry forget the ghosts of a failed marriage, and a failed writer,
which he considered himself to be until the fifties, when his writings begun
to be noticed full scale.</P>
<P>Phillip Kaufman's film of this period, and its development on two literary
persons, really expresses the best and the worst of the scene.  The best was
the excitement of the affairs, and the resulting little short story, or set
of lines in the diary.   The worst was that there wasn't a place where these
things could be published.  The happy medium was that it could be read out
loud and enjoyed in a sidewalk cafe, and not be torn down to shreds by a
literary critic, before it was helped by another writer.</P>
<P>Personally, I have never been a great fan of Henry Miller.  But he is a very
clever, and well thought out writer, who happens to know what he is writing
about.  In other words he is not lost in his ideas, and his works are not a
set of organized ideas and thoughts.  His works are the lives of many, and
their anatomical ways in every sense.   Anais Nin, I have just recently
read, and while it is nice, it has not aged well.  Victorian Literature, and
its indecent companion pornographic genre, had tested the erotic space, but
had not affected anything new.  Anais Nin did, by interjecting the erotic
feeling of thought behind the actual happening in a descriptive mode which
has a sleepy side to it, if not a dreamy sensuality to it.  Next to much
unpolished garbage in film, television and literature today, it is excellent
stuff.  By itself, it pales a little, and has a sort of eighteen year old
diary feel to it.  The film does too.  Compared to the blatantly distasteful
stuff one sees in Madonna these days, Anais Nin is fabulous, in that the
women and men in her works are not toys, they have feelings, and they live
those feelings, from Henry, to June, to any lover that Anais spends her time
with.  Madonna's expressions are that of a lack of appreciation for a good
person, and a desire to hurt, or protect the hurt person, who no longer
looks for redemption on self, but by preying on others weaknesses.</P>
<P>THIS IS A MAGNIFICENT FILM.
THERE AREN'T VERY MANY FILMS THAT DEPICT THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF A CREATIVE
ARTIST, AND HOW THEY FUNCTION.</P>
<PRE>SEE IT.
