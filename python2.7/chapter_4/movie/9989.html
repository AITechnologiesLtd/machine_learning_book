<PRE>Alien (1979)
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
(C) 1997 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: THE trend-setter for crossbreeds of horror and SF; still retains
all of its original power and vision. Indispensible.</P>
<PRE>"All fear is ultimately the fear of death."
        -- A.S. Neill</PRE>
<P>ALIEN is a "haunted house movie in space" the way CASABLANCA was "a WWII
movie about a cabaret in Morocco". Categorizing it doesn't come close to
describing its power and unrelentingly near-sadistic psychic pressure. It is
easily the best movie of its kind, and has yet to be surpassed in its
capacity for creating giant, silent spaces of horror in viewer's minds.</P>
<P>The plot is direct and unadorned. A group of space pilots who're on the way
home -- "truckers in space" was the way the press kit described them -- get
pulled out of suspended animation because of a distress beacon. The company
they work for stipulates that they have to respond to any such call "on
penalty of total forfeiture of shares", as one of the crew members icily
explains it. They're not scientists or adventurers; they're just a gang of
ordinary beer-drinking Joes who wanna go home.</P>
<P>The signal turns out to be emanating from a derelict craft on a lifeless
planet. On closer inspection, they find what they believe to be the pilot --
in a shot that is by itself immortal -- and something... more correctly a
whole mess of somethings... in the cargo hold. And beyond that I will not
go, if only for the sake of the ones lucky enough to have not seen the movie
yet. See it in widescreen if you can manage it: much of the film's
remarkable Panavision photography loses a lot when cropped by almost fifty
percent for a TV screen.</P>
<P>Director Ridley Scott -- this was only his second feature-length film, after
THE DUELLISTS! -- keeps the movie fluid and calm for the most part. He has
eschewed using too many obvious horror-movie cliches: the false alarm, the
having-someone-jump-suddenly-into-the-frame shock, etc. When he does, he
turns them on his ear -- such as the scene with Dallas (Tom Skerritt) in the
tunnel, or the scene with Harry Dean Stanton in the bowels of the ship. Both
end with a shock, but take their time to deploy the shock properly, with
surgically-precise timing. He also keeps the acting toned way down -- no
one's reaching for effect here, except near the end when sweat and whites of
the eyes and flat-out hysteria are required. Sigourney Weaver, of course, is
most often remembered, but look also at the other actors, even in the
quietest moments.</P>
<P>And then there is the alien itself, which is a slithering anthology of
everything we ever imagined lived under our beds and in our closets as
scared children. H.R. Giger, the artist responsible for the movie's
cliche-shattering look, once told an interviewer that while brushing his
teeth one night on the ALIEN set, he bumped into a light bulb and sent it
swinging. This caused shadows to move, and made the alin sculpture in the
corner appear animated. He screamed.</P>
<P>The reason a movie like ALIEN still scares us -- REALLY scares us, not just
gives us cleverly gory barf-em-up shots -- isn't due to any one thing, but
an amalgam of elements. Films are collaborative; the best films are the
product of many great minds, not just one, and ALIEN had a truly golden
collection of people working together to bring us something that not only
entertains, not only scares, but that has defined a place in our collective
minds for many others to follow.</P>
