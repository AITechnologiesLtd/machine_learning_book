_Made_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        After the success of 1996's _Swingers_, it would have been easy
for writer-star Jon Favreau to follow up the cult comedy fave with
another excursion in nouveau hipster catch phrases and swingin' big band
music.  But for _Made_, his directorial debut and long-awaited reunion
with co-star Vince Vaughn, Favreau has rather admirably taken a
different, unexpected route, and the ride is certainly a witty and
entertaining one.</P>
<P>        Knowing that _Made_ is completely unrelated to the Doug
Liman-directed _Swingers_ (that is, aside from sharing common talent) may
still not prepare fans of the previous film for this one's distinctly
darker flavor.  Favreau and Vaughn again play friends here, but the
relationship between struggling L.A. boxers/construction workers Bobby
and Ricky is far more volatile than that of _Swingers_' Mike and Trent,
as summed up by film's opening scene.  As the two face each other in a
bout, Vaughn's cocky Ricky openly mocks Favreau's no-nonsense Bobby,
setting himself up for a big pummelling.  The cycle constantly repeats
itself in a figurative sense after the pair are tapped by their
construction boss, small-time mobster Max (Peter Falk), to handle what
should be a quick and easy job in New York City.  Bobby wants nothing
more than to just do what he's told and collect the payment that could
provide a more stable life for him, his stripper girlfriend Jess (Famke
Janssen), and her daughter Chloe (Makenzie Vega, rid of the painful fake
lisp she sported in _The_Family_Man_).  Ricky, on the other hand, fancies
himself an instant organized crime big shot, leading him to do a number
of none-too-bright things that draw the ire of Big Apple big boss Ruiz
(Sean "Don't Call Me 'Puffy'" Combs, who fares better than expected in
his acting debut), his underling Horace (Faizon Love), and most of all
the increasingly impatient Bobby.</P>
<P>        Favreau doesn't give an artificial and inappropriate sunniness to
_Made_'s criminal milieu; this film even lacks a certain spring in its
step as far as pacing.  The slower, more rambling progression works well
in this context, though, for it adds to the dark undercurrent that runs
through the film.  While Ricky's antics are a primary source of light
amusement, the sense of foreboding lends an edge of danger to his
bumbling actions; there is always the real possibility that any one of
his wrong moves could be their final one.  The largely hand-held camera
work by cinematographer Christopher Doyle also adds to the gritty
atmosphere.</P>
<P>        Traces of grave seriousness turn up in _Made_ (particularly in
Bobby's side of the story), but there is no mistaking that Favreau has
cast a comic tale inside this dark world.  At the center of all of the
laughs is Ricky, whose delusions and general cluelessness make for
someone truly abrasive and annoying--which is exactly the often-hilarious
point, and Vaughn nails the role so perfectly that you may just want to
beat some sense into him, much like how Bobby tries to at various
junctures.  Favreau puts the pair in physical conflict once or twice too
many, but the banter that typically leads up to fighting, while not
_Swingers_ quotable, is spirited and sharp, as is the dialogue on the
whole.  False notes are rare among the entire cast, including those in
customary throwaway roles; even the likes of a briefly seen flight
attendant (Jennifer Bransford) and hotel bellboy (Sam Rockwell) exhibit
some level of colorful personality.</P>
<P>       Despite their clear cut differences in tone and style, comparisons
between _Swingers_ and _Made_ are inevitable, so to answer the burning
question: with its many memorable lines and scenes (the classic one with
the answering machine most quickly comes to mind) _Swingers_ is the
breezier, funnier, more enjoyable film.  But the reasons for my
_Swingers_ preference once again points up the fundamental differences
between the two.  _Swingers_ is more a movie of moments while _Made_ is
more about the larger picture--a picture that may not end up with the
fervent following of its flashier predecessor, but one that is definitely
worth a look.  (opens July 20 in New York and Los Angeles)</P>
