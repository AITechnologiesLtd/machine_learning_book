<P>     It astonishes me that two films with essentially the same story can 
be of such different quality. Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1955 murder 
mystery, DIABOLIQUE, was a taut, atmosphere-saturated thriller filled 
with unexpected twists and turns.  Jeremiah Chechik's ill-advised rip-
off is a lame Hollywood attempt to re-create a similarly suspenseful 
experience.</P>
<P>     I suppose it's possible to argue that, because Clouzot's picture 
was made over forty years ago, a remake isn't unreasonable.  The problem 
is, the original DIABOLIQUE was as much a cinematic landmark as 
Hitchcock's PSYCHO (Clouzot and Hitchcock had a tremendous influence on 
each other).  One should not undertake remaking a great film lightly, if 
at all.  Unfortunately, in this case, "integrity" wasn't a concept the 
film makers were concerned with.  </P>
<P>     Mia (Isabelle Adjani) and Guy Baran (Chazz Palminteri) co-run the 
St. Anselm's school for boys, which is located outside Pittsburgh.  Not 
only is Guy abusive, but he's flagrantly unfaithful, flaunting his 
affair with one of the school's teachers, Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone).  
Yet Nicole hates Guy as much as Mia does, and, together, the wife and 
mistress plot his murder.  One night, they lure their victim to a house 
in the city.  Once he's there, they drug him, then drown him in a 
bathtub.  Soon after, however, the body disappears, and Mia and Nicole 
must consider whether Guy has inexplicably survived or some previously-
unknown party intends to blackmail them.</P>
<P>     A significant predicament results from updating DIABOLIQUE, since 
certain key events demand a level of docility from Mia that is not 
typically found in a nineties American woman.  Had the new film been set 
in the fifties, it might have worked better, because some of what 
happens here (such as Guy humiliating Mia by ordering her to "swallow" 
her food during a public dinner) rings false in a current setting.  </P>
<P>     Modernizing DIABOLIQUE also means adding some exploitative 
elements.  Isabelle Adjani disrobes early in the film for no apparent 
reason other than to give viewers a chance to ogle her.  A blatant 
lesbian attraction between Mia and Nicole replaces the oblique one of 
the French version.  There's also a steamy sex scene featuring Nicole 
and Guy that serves no purpose -- we already know that the two are 
lovers.</P>
<P>     As was the case with the American rendition of THE VANISHING, the 
film makers here have decided to change the ending.  Gone is the 
deliciously diabolical finale of Clouzot's picture, replaced by 
something that's unambiguous, unambitious, and manifestly unoriginal. 
Don Roos' routine conclusion is the kind of massive cop-out likely to 
disappoint anyone hoping for something fresh.</P>
<P>     Isabelle Adjani gives a horrible performance, overacting almost 
every scene.  There were instances when her expressions of speechless 
horror reminded me of Fay Wray's exaggerated reaction to King Kong 
(albeit without the screams).  Sharon Stone and Chazz Palminteri are 
barely adequate as cartoon-like characters, displaying little range in 
one-dimensional roles.  The only one who does anything with her part is 
Kathy Bates, but her energetic portrayal as a cynical detective is 
largely wasted.</P>
<P>     Everything seems to be wrong with this version of DIABOLIQUE.  The 
acting is subpar, the direction is pedestrian, and the screenplay is 
moronic.  Certain lines are laughably bad ("It's not like you burnt the 
toast, Mia.  You killed your husband.  That's a little off the chart, 
demerit-wise", "Killing him is a good thing, like planting a tree").  
The cinematographer has unsuccessfully attempted to recapture the 
original's eerie, black-and-white atmosphere by using everything from 
inappropriately-placed shadows to foggy rainstorms.  Little about this 
DIABOLIQUE is worthwhile, and nothing is laudable.  My advice is to 
ignore the remake and rent the original.  </P>
