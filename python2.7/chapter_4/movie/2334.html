<PRE>                             THE WAR ROOM
                         a film review by Tak
           Placed in the public domain 1994 by Mark Takacs</PRE>
<P>An October Films Release / 96 mins 
film by: DA Pennebaker & Chris Hegedus 
Featuring: James Carville & George Stephanopoulos
Tak Rating: watch it on cable</P>
<P>TV-Style-One-Line-Summary
-------------------------
     You-are-there documentary of Clinton's Presidential campaign,
focusing on James Carville & George Stephanopoulos as they lay out
strategy, do damage control, and cope with daily difficulties.</P>
<P>Tak Summary
-----------
     The film begins tracing the efforts of the War Room -- Clinton's
campaign headquarters -- in the New Hampshire primary, and leads us all
the way through the last days of the election.  We see phone
interviews, bull sessions, staff meetings (equally as boring as any
I've ever been to), pep talks, behind the scenes convention footage,
spin-doctoring, scandal shunting and attempts to leak a story.</P>
<P>    Instead of focusing on Clinton, like the film-makers originally
intended, the focus was shifted to THE WAR ROOM staff, specifically
James Carville and George Stephanopoulos.  Bill Clinton is rarely
shown.  It ends up as a study of THE WAR ROOM and the two people who
successfully guided it.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts
------------
     I generally don't like documentaries.  They remind me of high
school social studies classes where half the class is sleeping and the
other half is doing last night's homework for math next period.  I
always managed to learn something though, I just never enjoyed the
format.  The same goes for THE WAR ROOM.</P>
<P>    I did get an interesting look at how a campaign runs.  Anyone who
thinks a political campaign is a model of order, organization and
efficiency will be disillusioned after this film.  Bill Clinton's
"well-oiled political machine" is chaotic, headless-chickens
running-around, seat of the pants group like any other group that needs
to respond dynamically to rapidly changing information while still
presenting a unified, organized and dignified front.  Only the efforts
of Carville and Stephanopoulos lend the mess any direction.  While
usually hellish to be involved in, such chaos is great to watch.</P>
<P>    Repeatedly during the campaign, THE WAR ROOM staff has to deal with
mudslinging from other candidates and questions about Clinton's past.
These include draft issues, Jennifer Flowers, and college activist
organizations.  With some of these same issues plaguing Clinton today,
it's interesting to realize that some of the same people
(Stephanopoulos at least) are still at work defusing and directing
policy.</P>
<P>    The human elements are THE WAR ROOM's best point.  That and the
LACK of narration.  Seeing the excitement after the debates, seeing the
tense final days when everything is topsy turvy, seeing their
depression when a news story is suppressed, seeing their reactions on
the last day as it slowly dawns on them that they've done it.  These
are the things that made the film watchable.</P>
<P>    There's some great lines here too.  And you know they're not
scripted... they're real lines.  After a phone interview -- "I bet I
said something you could take out of context" -- Bill Clinton.  The
sardonic Carville has several; my favorite regards Perot's expensive
campaign -- "That's gotta be the single most expensive act of
masturbation...".  And Stephanopoulos after the election results are in
-- "Now we have to actually do something..."</P>
<P>    One thing I can't figure out -- how do they expect to make money on
this film?  I can't see it being a big box office draw. The husband and
wife team of Pennebaker and Hegedus were dead set on making a feature
length film, but who were they making it for?  Who's the PAYING
audience?  Perhaps people who hang out in coffee shops and talk about
politics? (Admittedly, there's a glut of those here in Seattle -- maybe
they're on to something...)  But still.  Maybe they've got a sweet side
deal with video.</P>
<P>Technical Comments
------------------
    Of course, I knew THE WAR ROOM was a documentary and didn't expect
steady-cams and special lighting effects.  Accordingly, documentary
fans will be happy with the obligatory running-with-the-camera footage,
as well as dialogue volume swells, and rough manual pans as they flip
back and forth between speakers.  I think they actually added to the
behind-the-scenes feel.</P>
<P>    How did they film a 96 min movie while still maintaining a behind
the scenes feel?  According to the press packet, the film was done
without huge lights and sound booms.  No one was ever asked to "say
that again for the camera", and the cameraman often lurked in the
corner of the room, rather than crouching at people's feet.</P>
<P>    In fact, the war room staff often forgot the small film and sound
crew was there, often asking incredulously "You guys were filming?  We
thought you were waiting..."  But you'd never know from seeing the
movie.  The film and sound crew got some great stuff from their
unobtrusive locations.</P>
<P>    Additional footage was culled from unused bits of a film called
FEED, which covered the 1992 NH primary, and from network TV source
tapes.  The network excerpt were great.  It was fun to see a TV
reporter being jokingly (?) cut down by his interviewee moments before
she and he start their standard schtick -- "This is Joe Blow reporting
to you live with ..."</P>
<P>Tak Rating system:
------------------
    Documentaries are interesting, but I'm not sure this works well as
a feature film.  It's not really a date film, a Saturday afternoon
matinee, or even late night cable.  I wouldn't be surprised to find
something like this on your local PBS channel, or some of the better
cable educational channels.  Actually, if you're in high school or
taking a poly-sci class, this would be a GREAT excuse for a field
trip.  Maybe you can even get it paid for as an official activity.  If
not, you can at least munch some popcorn and get out of the classroom.</P>
<PRE>    avoid at all costs
 X  watch it on cable
    wait for videotape
    see once as a matinee 
    see several times (w/friends) as matinee
    see once at full price
    see it several times - full and/or matinee
    see many times at full price</PRE>
