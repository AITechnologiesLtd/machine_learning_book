<P>     Before delving into the reasons CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON isn't
the unqualified masterpiece it's been touted as, let's revel in the
reasons it's still a cinematic joy in a year of mostly leaden
entertainments. In one of the film's many inspiring action sequences, a
pair of adversaries square off in battle, employing a mystical fighting
technique that allows its adherents to virtually defy gravity. This
particular battle takes place not in a bar, or in a city street, but above
a forest, with the combatants surfing the leaves and tap-dancing across
branches. It is the moment when it's easiest to appreciate CROUCHING
TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON as a giddy exercise in pure cinema showmanship. Over
and over again, it lifts you out of the mundane world of a theater seat.</P>
<P>     It also drops you back into that seat a bit roughly every once in a
while, but why quibble? As directed by Ang Lee, the story is both
mythologically basic and epic in scope. In an unspecified year in the days
of Imperial China, veteran Wudan warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) is
preparing to retire from his fighting ways. His famed sword, Green
Destiny, is to be carried by his long-time friend and unconsummated love
Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) to Peking as a gift to elder statesman Sir Te
(Sihung Lung). But the sword is soon stolen by a mysterious figure
familiar with the ways of the Wudan, one who is able to match Shu Lien in
battle. Is it the infamous Jade Fox, who once slew Mu Bai's master? Or is
it Jen (Zhang Ziyi), the young daughter of a politician who longs for a
more adventurous life than the one designated for her?</P>
<P>     As solid as the narrative is in many ways, it would be ridiculous to
argue that its critical and commercial success will be rooted in the
story. CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON is first and foremost an adventure,
one that turns choreographed action into pure film art. The action
sequences combine the astonishing talents of fight choreographer Yuen
Wo-Ping (THE MATRIX) with spectacular wire work to create moments that
make you want to stand up and applaud. There's never even a sense of
redundancy as the film progresses; each sequence serves its own purpose,
and offers wonderful variations on the clashing of metal, feet and fists,
and escapes up sheer walls. It's pure INDIANA JONES fun with an unexpected
sense of consequence.</P>
<P>     It's also a martial arts-heavy film in which the thematic elements
actually matter. While CROUCHING TIGER is certainly enjoyable as a distaff
spin on the usually testosterone-soaked chop-socky genre, it's more than a
feminist action flick. It explores the human toll of unthinking tradition,
tradition that wears the kind of deep grooves into the world that, in one
lovely early scene, Shu Lien's wagon must follow to remain upright.
Characters struggle with frustration over conflicts between their desires
and their destinies. The performances are strong, with all three of the
principal players (Chow, Yeoh and Zhang) conveying the burdens of living
expected lives in expected ways. For an action-filled film, there's a lot
going on above the neck.</P>
<P>     That's quite a load for an adventure film to carry, and occasionally
it's not quite up to the task. CROUCHING TIGER is full of sub-plots that
make it denser than it needs to be functionally, dashing from Jen's
encounter with a desert raider (Chen Chang), to the political implications
of the sword's disappearance, to the soon-to-be-irrelevant roles of a
police officer and his daughter. Particularly underdeveloped is the
relationship between Jen and her governess (Cheng Pei-Pei), which
ultimately plays a crucial role in the climax but feels like there's
something missing. Yet as ambitious as it is, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN
DRAGON never feels self-important. As beautifully crafted as it is
(notably Peter Pau's cinematography and Tan Dun's score), it never turns
into a stagnant parade of lovely images. And as fanciful as its action
sequences are, they never inspire eye-rolling. CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN
DRAGON isn't a masterpiece, but it doesn't have to be. There's pleasure
enough in a film that doesn't make you feel stupid while it sends you
soaring over the treetops.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 martial artistries:  8.</PRE>
