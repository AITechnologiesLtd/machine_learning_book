Miramax</P>
<P>        David Lean, I think, would have liked "The English Patient".  It 
has all the earmarks of one of his films--exotic scenery, convoluted 
plot, lush music, British accents and enough length to numb ones 
backside without actually making one long for the credits.</P>
<P>        Amid flashbacks that take the viewer from a bombed-out monastery
in WWII Italy to a desert expedition, we have Canadian nurse, Hannah, 
played with a sort of reckless intensity by Juliette Binoche, tending 
her moribund patient, who may be even more mysterious than he 
immediately appears.  Sometimes, bed-ridden Ralph Fiennes (who bears a 
disturbing resemblance to Boris Karloff as "The Mummy") speaks like an 
authentic Briton, yet, at other times, his accent is evocative 
of...well, his "Schindler's List" character.  Perhaps he needed Martin 
Landau to give him lessons in a Hungarian lilt, because Fiennes, while 
convincing as a dying mass of scar tissue, does not quite persuade us 
that he is a Count from Budapest.</P>
<P>        In fact, Ralph Fiennes, undoubtedly a fine actor, is the main 
problem I had with "The English Patient".  I must admit I loved 
everything else about this movie and was only mildly annoyed by the 
rather corny, contrived dialogue.  This film really is "Lawrence of 
Arabia" meets "Casablanca" and contains all that is stirring, even 
haunting, about pictures that were made before 1950.  It is a true 
Romance--albeit without a proper hero.  David Lean, that shrewd 
cast-master, would not have put Ralph Fiennes in this role.  He would 
have had the good sense to find someone with the wistful charm and 
mesmerizing authority of a young Peter O'Toole.  I, personally, would 
have begged Jeremy Northam of "Emma" to play the patient (I doubt he 
would have required much cajoling).  Now THAT is a man to die for, 
someone whose eyes alone would explain the admirable Kristin Scott 
Thomas falling in love with him at first sight.  Ralph Fiennes, for all 
his histrionic merits, is just too much of a stretch--even more than 
Daniel Day Lewis.  The rest of the cast is practically perfect, but this 
is an old-fashioned picture that cries out for an old-fashioned 
heart-throb hero.  Had "The English Patient" been a different Britisher, 
this film would have made out at the box office like the annual incomes 
of whole group-practice of surgeons.</P>
