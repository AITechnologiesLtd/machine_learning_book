<PRE>                       CLEOPATRA'S SECOND HUSBAND
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Ever had a houseguest that wouldn't leave?  You don't know the half
of it.  A striking departure from films like Pacific Heights,
Cleopatra's Second Husband cuts deep and pours salt in the wound -- a
harrowing story that goes from semi-romantic comedy to gruesome thriller
without looking back.</P>
<P>     Jon Reiss's debut feature tells the story of Robert Marrs (Paul
Hipp), an independently wealthy and prissy photographer unable to
impregnate his wife Hallie (Bitty Schram).  When they leave for a short
trip, Zack (Boyd Kestner) and Sophie (Pitch Black's Radha Mitchell) are
enlisted to care for the house.  But upon their return, the place is a
mess, the fish are dead, and Zack & Sophie don't look to leave.</P>
<P>     Things get spicy when Robert has a tryst with Sophie, his wife
leaves, Sophie follows suit, and Zack becomes a devil in the flesh, soon
turning Robert into a zombified slave.  What happens next I won't spoil,
but suffice it to say the best is yet to come.</P>
<P>     Cleopatra is startling in its originality, and while it's only 93
minutes long, the movie feels epic in its scope, thanks to all the
twists and turns.  In other words, it's destined to become a cult
classic.</P>
<P>     The film's few failings -- atrocious sound design that leaves
numerous lines inaudible, too many scenes that chat about rather that
show the action, and a draggy first act -- are largely forgivable.  In a
nutshell, if you're a fan of independent film, seek out Cleopatra's
Second Husband and see if your jaw doesn't hit the floor like mine.</P>
