<PRE>eXistenZ (1999)
Review by Steve Kong

<P>Hollywood always seems to release movies that are similar to each other 
back-to-back or near back-to-back.  Take for instance the mad-bomber phase 
when Hollywood released both Speed (good) and Blown Away (bad) 
together.  Or when the animated bugs took the screen with A Bug's Life 
(good) and Antz (good also).  Well, in 1999 there was a phase when 
Hollywood decided to release two movies about alternate or externally 
generated realities together.  The first was a hit, and I loved it, it was 
The Matrix.  The second I skipped and waited for DVD and that was 
eXistenZ.  I finally got to see eXistenZ on DVD, am I glad I waited.</P>
<P>eXistenZ is the name of a virtual reality game developed over some five 
years by the world's most famous and best game developer, Allegra Gellar 
(Jennifer Jason Leigh).  After an attempt on her life, she is on the run 
and is being protected by a PR geek named Ted Pikul (Jude Law).  In order 
to save her game, she has to go into it and play  why she has to play the 
game in order to save it, I don't know and I don't remember the movie tell 
me either.  So, she and Ted Pikul enter eXistenZ to play the game and save it.</P>
<P>Unlike most virtual reality or alternative reality movies, eXistenZ takes a 
different approach to "jacking in."  Instead of the standard fare of 
plugging into a computer, eXistenZ resides on an organic thing  it's hard 
to describe, but, in the movie it looks like a melted rubber mask from some 
monster movie that moves and makes little noises that you might expect out 
of a doll.  The organic pod is plugged into the game player via a bio-port 
located at the bottom of the players back and it gets plugged directly into 
the player's spine.  All of this is good and fine, it's actually pretty 
innovative.</P>
<P>What's not to like about this movie?  Well, to start off, I think director 
David Cronenberg has some sort of fetish with alien flesh or raw 
carcass.  I was disgusted by most of the movie (not to mention I lost my 
appetite when I watched the Chinese restaurant sequence).  Cronenbery just 
piles on the flesh, bones, and carcass throughout the movie and it reaches 
a point where I just said to myself, "Aw, this is complete crap."</P>
<P>It doesn't help that the script is completely predictable.  The idea behind 
the script is standard fare when it comes to stories about alternate 
realities.  It is much like The Matrix's in that it leads the viewers 
through some alternate realities and then leaves the viewer to wonder what 
reality the characters are really in.  Are they still in some alternate 
reality?  Or are they in the "real" world"?  Well, although both eXistenZ 
and The Matrix are predictable in that sense, at least The Matrix had some 
intriguing ideas behind it (albeit a little stupid like the 
humans-as-batteries idea) and it had some kick-ass action sequences to 
boot.  eXistenZ had neither.  The movie is about carcass about flesh.  It's 
about two people wandering through something that at any given point if 
they were killed, I wouldn't give a damn.  The story is so thin that I 
wondered halfway through the movie what the point of them playing the game 
was  and like I said before, that was never explained.</P>
<P>The main actors Jude Law and Jennifer Jason Leigh wander through the movie 
like their characters.  Maybe they were just doing it for the extra cash, I 
can only hope they were.  Especially for Jude Law who gave such a wonderful 
performance in another sci-fi film Gattaca, it was disappointing to see him 
in such schlock as eXistenZ.  Leigh does what she can with her part, which 
is a part that has no excitement, no real character.</P>
<P>I've never been a fan of eXistenZ writer/director David Cronenberg and 
eXistenZ does not help to move me into his fan club either.  Cronenberg is 
one of those auteur directors who love to do things differently, which I 
have nothing against.  Some of the best directors go against the grain of 
Hollywood and make some of the best and most innovative films.  But, 
Cronenberg seems to try way too hard at it.  He tries to be way too 
different.  Maybe he's making the film for himself, I don't know, but 
eXistenZ was not entertaining at all.  It was predictable and 
disgusting.  I wonder how Cronenberg got the green light on this project.</P>
<P>So, was there anything that I did like about this movie?  Yes, only one 
thing.  That was the haunting score by Howard Shore (The Game).  Howard 
composes a wonderful score that is wasted on a terrible movie.</P>
<P>Skip eXistenZ, save an hour and a half of your time.  This film is just 
garbage that's not worth watching.  If you want an alternative-reality film 
fix, then go rent The Matrix.  Or if you want a film that will screw with 
your head about a different reality then go rent an older film named 
Jacob's Ladder.  eXistenZ is like a lot of the mutant animals in the film, 
an ugly mutated version of something that could have been beautiful.  Skip 
eXistenZ.</P>
