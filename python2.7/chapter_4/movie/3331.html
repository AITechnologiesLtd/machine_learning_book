<PRE>                           THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1995 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     THE BRADY BUNCH operates, fairly successfully, on three levels: as
a parody of the original, as a nostalgic look back at it, and as a
re-creation.  My seven-year old daughter had no problem accepting it as
a feature length version of the sitcom, since all the in-jokes went
right over her head.  Teenagers and older people in the audience caught
the many jokes about homosexuality, transvestites, crime, etc. as well
as the somewhat more adept jokes about quirks in the original
characterizations, e.g., Jan's odd way of flinging her ponytail back and
forth, Marcia's obsession with combing her hair, the father's lectures,
etc.; and everyone who longed for the original show had fun seeing
cameos by the original actors, seeing Marcia's 70s perfection
re-created, etc.</P>
<P>     The premise of the movie is to take the Brady Bunch and transplant
them intact into the 90s, with them still holding the same values,
using the same language, wearing the same style clothing, etc.  They
are of course assaulted by the greed and crime endemic in this era, but
manage to overcome it in true Brady fashion, by sticking together and
displaying that Brady spirit.  The film carefully adheres to the
one-dimensional production values of the original.</P>
<P>     I liked the young actress portraying Jan Brady, who had the only
role with any dramatic conflict. She has the mannerisms (at least as 
I've seen them parodied elsewhere--I can't remember them from the show,
not being much of a fan) down well, and also brings a kind of
additional, much welcome oddness to her interaction with her interior
monologue.</P>
<P>     You should only go to see this film as a harmless afternoon's
entertainment for children, or if you were or are a fan of the
original.  The in-jokes are exactly the sort you probably have already
come up with if you watch the show.  I won't spoil the fun by
mentioning any of them, though this leaves little else to review.</P>
<P>     The biggest success in this film is its not quite over the top
parody of the Bradys.  I got the impression that I was watching a movie
any Brady-watching college sophomore could have contributed a joke or
two to, but somehow the film almost never broke down into complete
silliness, as these films often do.  Well, not quite--there's one scene
where the bad guy explicitly brings forth all the odd things about the
Bradys--but at least the Bradys aren't around then, to hear their
lifestyle impugned.</P>
<P>     There is some superficial commentary on late 60s/early 70s
pseudo-pop culture.  The Monkees play a fairly prominent role, and
there is a clever very brief reference to the Partridge Family.  The
segue into the title sequence is also cute.</P>
<P>     For a feature-length recreation of a superficial, artistically
weightless sitcom, this film is remarkably successful.</P>
