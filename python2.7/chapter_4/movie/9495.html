Dear Brigitte (1965)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 40</PRE>
<P>"Dear Brigitte" is a harmless family movie and comedy that 
passes time agreeable enough, but is rarely funny and
has a storyline that lacks credibility.</P>
<P>James Stewart plays an irascible college professor, a poet who
mocks science while promoting liberal arts.  His dutiful wife
is Glynis Johns.  He has an attractive but stupid daughter,
who is dating an attractive but stupid man (Fabian, who somehow
got second billing for his minor role).  Also about is eccentric
"captain" Ed Wynn.  Stewart has a pre-teen son Erasmus, who proves to
be a math prodigy and the world's greatest racetrack handicapper.</P>
<P>The film centers around Stewart and his son.  Stewart wants
to make an artist of him, but instead the kid, who is tone deaf
and color blind, suddenly develops math abilities far beyond 
anyone who has ever lived (but is otherwise completely normal).  
He can also pick the winner of any horse race.  Stewart at
first wants to protect the child, but later sacrifices his
values and gambles large amounts of money recklessly.</P>
<P>Brigitte Bardot, the title subject and apparent mother substitute
for young Erasmus, has a cameo near the end of the movie.</P>
<P>One thing that annoyed me about this film is that the various
pretty young women are all stupid.  Glynis Johns isn't, so the 
writer apparently believes women gain thirty I.Q. points as they
age.  Speaking of age, Stewart would be better cast as the
prodigy's grandfather.</P>
<P>"Dear Brigitte" is watchable despite its flaws.  Still, it
too often surrenders plot and character development in an 
attempt for a laugh that doesn't arrive.</P>
