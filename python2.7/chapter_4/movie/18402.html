<P>200 CIGARETTES
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: *1/2 (out of ****)
Paramount / 1:40 / 1999 / R (language, sexual situations)
Cast: Paul Rudd; Courtney Love; Martha Plimpton; Ben Affleck; Kate 
Hudson; Jay Mohr; Christina Ricci; Gaby Hoffman; Dave Chappelle; Casey 
Affleck; Guillermo Diaz; Janeane Garofalo; Angela Featherstone 
Director: Risa Bramon Garcia 
Screenplay: Shana Larsen <HR>A backdrop of New Year's Eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to a 
great party movie. The decor possibilities are endless - disco balls had 
yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic, big hair was worth 
its weight in AquaNet, and the louder the fashion, the better the look. 
But despite this setting, these details and a soundtrack that includes 
some 40-plus irresistible hits from the early days of the Me Decade, 
something is inherently wrong with "200 Cigarettes." A better title for 
this nostalgic mess would be "50 Missed Opportunities."</P>
<P>What is it that makes this retro-comedy such a downer? It's certainly 
not the cast, which includes enough hot, young talent for several 
movies. There's Courtney Love, cementing her reputation as a serious 
actress; Christina Ricci, hot off her shoulda-been-nominated turn in 
"The Opposite of Sex"; Paul Rudd, who gets even more appealing with 
every role; Kate Hudson, inheriting some fine acting genes from mom 
Goldie Hawn; and Affleck brothers Ben and Casey, two of the best things 
about "Good Will Hunting." Perhaps the question is this: What drew these 
and other immensely talented actors to such a dreary project? </P>
<P>Maybe it looked good on paper. "200 Cigarettes" is composed of a series 
of vignettes, as various characters make their way through New York's 
festively decorated East Village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery 
bundle of nerves named Monica (Martha Plimpton, all dressed up in her 
best Cyndi Lauper). Among the potential guests are likeable cad Kevin 
(Rudd) and his best friend Lucy (Love), busy bickering over his recent 
break-up, and a clumsy but seemingly charming bartender (Ben Affleck) 
who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pick-up lines. </P>
<P>More subplots - _many_ more - dot the big picture, but those listed 
above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light. All the other 
story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a Rubick's 
Cube. Ricci and Gaby Hoffman grate as two Ronkonkoma gals (the kind that 
have trouble pronouncing hard consonants) out to have a high time in the 
big city. Infamously acerbic comedienne Janeane Garofalo is wasted in 
what amounts to a several-scene cameo. Hudson, as a pretty-in-pink klutz 
recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies' man (Jay Mohr), trips, 
pukes and gets smeared with dog poop. Are we laughing yet? </P>
<P>The film boils down to a mixture of the good, the bad and the gaudy, 
with the latter two overtaking the former. Game performances - 
especially by Love, Rudd and Plimpton - are almost shot down by the 
bizarrely colorful parts and a constantly roving focus, here a 
combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle. Too many 
sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until a lengthy 
final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one 
night stands for each other. If this is "200 Cigarettes," then get me 
200 nicotine patches. <HR>© 1999 Jamie Peck

"Here it is at last, the first 150-minute trailer. ‘Armageddon' is cut 
together like its own highlights. Take almost any 30 seconds at random, 
and you'd have a TV ad. The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, 
the brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained. No 
matter what they're charging to get in, it's worth more to get out." 
-Roger Ebert on "Armageddon"</P>
