<P>The Big Game - it's a cliché that's used in just about every sports flick.
The best films about competition are usually about something else besides
the contest, especially when they involve sports that aren't exciting enough
to build an entire story around.  That's the case with The Luzhin Defence, a
film that, at least superficially, is about a big chess competition in 1929,
but beneath the surface it tells the tale of a reclusive man coming out of
his shell.</P>
<P>The man is Alexander Luzhin (John Turturro, O Brother, Where Art Thou?) and
The Big Game is the World Chess Championships, which are being held at a
ritzy hotel in Italy's Lake Como.  Luzhin is an introverted Grand Master of
the game who dresses sloppily and shuns contact with other humans (kind of
sounds like a film critic, huh?).  He also suffers from what we can assume
is some form of obsessive-compulsive disorder and comes off a bit like the
Rain Man of chess, carefully planning out strategies every waking moment of
his day.</P>
<P>Enter Natalia (Emily Watson, Trixie), a young woman who just happens to be
staying at the same resort that is playing host to the chess tournament.
Natalia's mom (Geraldine James) is anxious to marry her daughter off and has
already lined up a wonderful suitor in Comte de Stassard (Christopher
Thompson).  But wouldn't you know it - Natalia ends up falling in love with
Luzhin.  The two meet cute when she retrieves an item that has dropped
through a hole in the pocket of his tattered clothes.  He proposes, almost
instantly, and she accepts, asking, "Would it not be appropriate to know my
name first?"  So you know her mom has got to be thrilled.</P>
<P>As the film progresses, we learn more and more about Luzhin, like that he
was a child prodigy who was managed by a man who now coaches his most
capable competitor.  We see clunky flashbacks to his mop-topped youth - his
parents fought and he was afraid of school, so little Luzhin poured all of
his energy into the piano and, before you know it, he's playing Rach III on
stage in front of...wait.  Wrong movie.  I meant chess. He pours his energy
into chess.  Seriously, though, Luzhin is more than a little similar to
Shine.  They share the same narrative structure, and there's even a tub
scene (Luzhin doesn't poop in the water, though).  Like David Helfgott,
Luzhin doesn't so much fall in love with Natalia as latch on to her.</P>
<P>Turturro does well, making a potentially unlikable character pretty
sympathetic to the viewer.  Like Enemy at the Gates, Luzhin is another film
where all of the Russian characters speak with English accents.  In addition
to Turturro's standout performance, Luzhin also features a lovely score
(Alexandre Desplat) and pretty cinematography (Bernard Lutic, I Dreamed of
Africa).</P>
<P>Luzhin was directed by Marleen Gorris (Mrs. Dalloway) and adapted from
Vladimir Nabokov's novel by Peter Berry.  Nabakov based Luzhin's character
on real-life chess Grand Master Curt von Bardeleben, who checked out in a
manner similar to Luzhin.  You know with a Nabokov story you're going to get
obsession that turns into tragedy, and Luzhin doesn't do anything to make
you think otherwise.  It's a simple, predictable story, and its chess scenes
aren't nearly as dazzling as Searching for Bobby Fischer, but Luzhin is
still moderately entertaining.</P>
<P>1:46 - PG-13 for some sensuality and thematic elements</P>
