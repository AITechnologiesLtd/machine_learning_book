<PRE>                       WHAT DREAMS MAY COME 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                  2 :-) :-) out of 4 for the after life</PRE>
<P>Cast: Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding Jr., Annabella Sciorra, Max Von
Sydow, Jessica Brooks Grant, Josh Paddock.
Screenplay: Ron Bass, based on the novel by Richard Matheson. Producers:
Stephen Simon and Barnet Bain.
Director: Vincent Ward.</P>
<P>In a literally picturesque view of the afterlife, we are faced with
prospects of living out the rest of eternity in a universe carrying our
most fond and cherished memories of the living – that's providing you
didn't commit suicide – suicides, end up in hell. This movie suggests
these premises, and you can also choose to be reborn if so wished. All
rather wishful thinking, but who knows?</P>
<P>This sets the scene for one man after death, in search of his family and
wife. It is the search of one man in heaven, journeying into another
woman's hell. Whether you believe true love can rescue another soul from
eternal damnation, is up for debate, but it's the struggle and
determination of a man in love, which is of import. Will he succeed, or
will he be forever damned with her?</P>
<P>The cinematography is undoubtedly one of the ingenious pieces of art
that has been splashed onto screen. Much of this movie throbs with the
life of a living painting. It will push the viewer's imagination to new
dimensions, adding colour to the mundanity of movie re-making. This
alone is one good reason for watching this movie - it is fresh and
original. However, for those who have strong convictions about the after
life, this movie may disturb your sensibilities, with its mixture of New
Age thinking and eastern philosophies.</P>
<P>Robin Williams, is sensitive as the role of the man in search of his
wife after death, but because of the nature of the work, hardly gets to
crack a joke side ways. I'm not entirely convinced that Annabella
Sciorra was ideal person for the role of the lost wife, but it really
doesn't matter when it comes down to life and death.</P>
