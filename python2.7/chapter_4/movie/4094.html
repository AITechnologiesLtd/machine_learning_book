<PRE>                               SHOWGIRLS
                      A Critic's Worst Nightmare
                  A film review by J. Neil Schulman
                   Copyright 1995 J. Neil Schulman</PRE>
<P>     Suppose you had a movie whose director and screenwriter had
previously collaborated to produce a classic in the suspense genre--a
director who had in addition produced a couple of the best
science-fiction films ever made.  Suppose this creative team had
produced a brand-new movie which was particularly dependent on the
press for box-office success because they had made a huge gamble:
producing the first serious adults-only major motion picture since
MIDNIGHT COWBOY in the 1960's.</P>
<P>     Now suppose that the universal critical reaction in all major
media was to attack this new movie as being incompetent in every
respect--accusing it of being badly written, badly directed, badly
acted--with critics accusing it not merely of being unprofessional,
but in essence a gross fraud upon the movie-going public.</P>
<P>     That was the paradox I was contemplating earlier tonight as I took
a seat in my local theater, along with fellow science-fiction author
Brad Linaweaver, to see SHOWGIRLS, written by Joe Eszterhas and
directed by Paul Verhoeven, who previously collaborated on the suspense
classic, BASIC INSTINCT.  Either I was about to see a truly awful movie
inexplicably made by a very talented creative team--or the critics were
for some reason trying to assassinate a singular masterpiece.</P>
<P>     As Brad and I walked out of the theater afterwards, we knew we had
just seen a masterpiece.  The only question we needed to debate was
whether the American film-reviewing industry was a bunch of short-
sighted incompetents or whether they are so morally flawed they had to
try stamping out this particular masterpiece in order to hide from the
light it shed upon their own moral corruption.</P>
<PRE>     Now let me tell you what *I* saw on the screen.</PRE>
<P>     I saw a film which stars Elizabeth Berkley, an actress whose next
role should be Helen of Troy.  Berkley is an actress who might be
called Marilyn Monroe's sister--the *pretty* one--except that Elizabeth
Berkley is already a more evocative and powerful actress than Monroe
was at her prime--and she's a dancer of powers equal to her acting
strengths.</P>
<P>     I saw a film, about the seedy side of show business, which
combined the raw power of Scorcese's GOODFELLAS, in its ability to
highlight the workings of evil minds, with Bob Fosse's ability to
combine the onstage and backstage life of dancers in ALL THAT JAZZ.</P>
<PRE>     In a phrase, SHOWGIRLS is A CHORUS LINE's evil twin.</PRE>
<P>     I saw a film with a main character, Nomi Malone, that I would have
thought only Ayn Rand could write: a diamond in the rough, a pearl cast
before swine.  Elizabeth Berkley's portrayal of Nomi Malone, as written
by Joe Eszterhas and directed by Paul Verhoeven, evokes an innocence
that can stroll through Hell itself--emotionally scorched by evil, a
violent nemesis to evil,  but unscarred and ultimately unconquered by
it.  Malone is a Candide figure who expects the best of all possible
world in the glitter of Las Vegas--and when she learns better that the
glitter is a paper-thin covering for corruption worthy of Nero's Rome,
she walks out as decisively as a cowboy riding off into the sunset,
leaving the bad guys in her dust.</P>
<P>     Finally, this is a movie about power: the power of money and the
power of sex.  America has an unfortunate history in that its puritan
founders never understood that sex is not merely procreative but a core
expression of our nature as rational animals.  Ayn Rand showed in her
novels that what our bodies respond to sexually are what our minds
would have us become: if we are heroic in our ideals, we are turned on
by beauty and heroism; if we are flawed, our sexual choices reflect our
flaws.</P>
<P>     With Elizabeth Berkley's natural beauty combined with masterful
choreography, lighting, and direction, a man watching this film would
have to be a eunuch not to be aroused by it--and a woman would have to
be one of Germaine Greer's female eunuchs.  When critics call this
movie non-erotic, all I can think of is that they're lifelong member's
of Orwell's Anti-Sex League in his dystopian NINETEEN-EIGHTY-FOUR.</P>
<P>     The plot of SHOWGIRLS is more symbolic than dramatic; it uses the
background of A STAR IS BORN, FAME setting to display for us the
conflict between artistic ambition and moral integrity.  Those who seek
nothing great never experience the forces which would tempt them to
sell their dreams--and *that* is why critics, who make their living as
parasites on creative products they could never themselves create, are
so offended by geniuses who have the bad taste to show them what
artistic integrity looks like--and the worse taste to show that the
moral lesson works even in the near pornographic setting of erotic
dance.</P>
<P>     Nomi Malone in SHOWGIRLS is a young individualist who is unwilling
to sell herself out.  She does what is necessary to survive, even if
distasteful, but she never loses sight of the value of her own life.
When she is accused of having low self-esteem, her immediate reaction
is to spit in the eye of the man who said it--a man who truly does not
understand the nature of the insult.  Malone is capable of being
extremely violent, but her violence is well-aimed at worthy targets;
and she is generous enough to grant the boon of charity to an enemy who
probably doesn't deserve it.</P>
<P>     I have written in other places that we get what we pay for and do
not get what we do not pay for.  The price of having works of genius as
part of our culture--works that stand above the lowest-common-denominator
which is our daily fare--is that we not allow them to be marginalized.
Whatever the value of a great movie is to the enrichment of our culture
and the recognition of our human nature, we owe it to those capable of
producing works of original merit that we not ignore them at the urging
of the moral cripples who have seized control of the critical organs of
our culture.</P>
<P>     The sexually explicit SHOWGIRLS is not for children, but then
neither are matches.  Grown-ups who know that sex and violence can be
an integral part of our moral life should see this movie before the
critics empty the theaters and leave it to subsequent generations to
discover its greatness--leaving its writer, director, and star to
wonder why their virtues are being despised.</P>
