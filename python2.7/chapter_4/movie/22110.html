<PRE>Getting Under His Skin
Being John Malkovich</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Ever feel like being someone else? Elvis, maybe? How about Madonna? Choice
is not an option here. Would you pay 200 bucks to crawl into a small hole in
the wall of a half size office building just to be in John Malkovich's head
for 10 minutes? Huh? Would ya punk? That's the "mind-blowing" ride this
picture offers ... well, not to you, but to other people in the film.</P>
<P>John Cusack is solid as the hippie radical puppeteer whose artistic talents
with wooden dolls are as extreme as his psychotic behavior. The puppets, by
the way, are fantastic. Their chop block shapes move with such grace and
human-realism. Their faces eerily carved into the likeness of Cusack and
Diaz. Diaz (Cusack's wife) and especially Keener (the bold, sexy
distraction) deliver strong performances as well.</P>
<P>Malkovich must have had a blast doing this movie ... pretending to be
Cusack, pretending to be himself. He's captivating as always. With more than
a squirt of lime-twist humor, it's a tightly written adventure fantasy for
the brave of open-mind.</P>
<P>"It's good in here Craig, better than in your wildest dreams." My
complements to the writer and director. The exaggerated audio really helps
to put you inside Malkovich's head. The ending credits also continue the
luring surrealistic feel in visuals and music.</P>
<P>The title isn't just some alternative rock band sounding chime -- it's
exactly what the film is about.</P>
