<P>Sometimes there are animated wonders. The year 1999 had the amazing "Toy 
Story 2", 1998 had the classic "Mulan", and going all the way back to the 
original "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" animation has come a long way. 
However let's not get on the subject of Disney films, but rather Dreamworks 
Animated Movies, whose films include 1998's "The Prince of Egypt", and 2000's 
flop "The Road to El Dorado" has now come out with a new instant classic 
"Chicken Run", a brilliant, funny well animated movie that is worthy of all 
the praise it can get.</P>
<P>Taking place in the 1950's, "Chicken Run" is about a big group of chickens, 
whose farm they live on belonging to the Tweedy's is a bit like a Poultry 
Holocaust setting, they try and try their hardest to get out of this pin, 
because if they do not lay eggs anymore, they die and become friend chicken. 
The main character Ginger (Julia Swalha) is the young chicken who is the one 
that is destined to get out and try if her tries fail. She tries many times, 
but is locked away in a dumpster for a few days to return back to the pin and 
do it all over again. One day a gift from heaven comes, the suave Rocky the 
Rooster (voiced by Mel Gibson) who literally flies over their pin, saves the 
day by trying to teach the girls how to fly out of this coop. </P>
<P>However Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy have something else on their minds, and the 
chickens must get out of the pin and escape or die frying. Along the way they 
have some hilarious misadventures, with sweet and clever dialogue and very 
well developed characters for chickens that is. The voices also are a 
standout with Julia Sawalha being the best out of all of them. She brings out 
her voice and makes it full force as well as hilarious. The supporting 
chickens are funny as well, that at times had me rolling so hard. Mel Gibson 
is a great voice too and fits Rocky the Rooster quite well. Miranda 
Richardson does the spooky character voice for Mrs. Tweedy and sounds very 
nice, as well as mean. Tony Haygarth plays the cowardly Mr. Tweedy who really 
isn't as mean as Mrs. Tweedy is.</P>
<P>The animation on the film is beyond amazing, the claymation used in this film 
is colorful, brilliant and fantastically done. You can really tell in some 
scenes that alot of work (3 years) was put into this film. In the end, 
however it shows wonderfully. The movement of these chickens is smooth and 
makes those old Gumby episodes look like mush. Even with Disneys $200m flop 
'Dinosaur' I would have to pick 'Chicken Run' as having the best animation so 
far this year, not because of the fact that its animated, but because of the 
fact of all the work that was put into this film in the past three years and 
$42 million dollars later. </P>
<P>The film a wonderful children's movie that kids will sit and enjoy, laugh at 
and be entertained by. Its direction, voices and story are so brought out 
well, that this may be one of the best animated films I've seen. It is 
certainly one of the best films of 2000. There really isn't any flaws in the 
film, which is a rare occasion in Hollywood these days. Last year we had 
"American Beauty" another Dreamworks film, and in 1998 we had "Saving Private 
Ryan" yet another Dreamworks film. If this is the case, I hope Dreamworks 
puts out more films like "Chicken Run". Because as long as they do I will 
certainly be there to watch them.</P>
