<PRE>INSTINCT
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>        Subtlety is not one of Jon Turteltaub's strong suits.</PRE>
<P>        In his previous outing, "Phenomenon," the director proved guilty of
beating us about the face and neck with heavy-handed metaphors.  For his
latest film, a psychological thriller with the curiously unmemorable title
"Instinct" (perhaps "The Silence of the Gorillas in the Mist" would have
been more appropriate), Turteltaub has toned the meaningful allusions down
some, but he still doesn't miss the opportunity to close in on his actors
the minute their eyes well with tears.  This happens not once but twice in
"Instinct," and by the second time it's clear that Turteltaub still favors
sledgehammer manipulation over nuance.</P>
<P>        That's not the only problem with "Instinct."  Perhaps its biggest
failing is that it's just not very interesting.  Whatever potential there
was in Daniel Quinn's book remains unrealized by the director, the writer,
and the actors--hard as they may try.</P>
<P>        Dr. Ethan Powell (the reliable Anthony Hopkins) is an
anthropologist who disappears for two years after studying gorillas
(courtesy Stan Winston) in the African bush.  He surfaces in a Rwandan
jail, found guilty of killing two game wardens and injuring three others.
Following Powell's transfer to a Florida penitentiary, an ambitious
University of Miama psychiatry resident called Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding,
Jr.) takes a crack at evaluating the intriguing primatologist, who hasn't
spoken a word in over a year.</P>
<P>        Caulder's goal is to determine what turned Powell into a killer,
but the deeper he digs into his patient's psyche, the stronger becomes his
determination to win the man's freedom.</P>
<P>        One of the catches behind Caulder's assignment is that he's
required to serve as the staff psychiatrist at the ironically-named Harmony
Bay Correctional Facility for the duration of his appraisal.  Imagine a
sharp-dressed Cuba Gooding, Jr. surrounded by the scum of society and you
might anticipate some humor in the situation.  The filmmakers, however,
choose to milk this situation of its "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"
parallels, with the stubborn Caulder fighting to change the maximum
security prison's rules by giving the mild-mannered felons a fair shot at
privilege against the big gorillas holding all the aces.</P>
<PRE>        All while dealing with Powell, whom he slowly reaches and befriends.</PRE>
<P>        It's hard referring to the film as a thriller since what few
thrills there are culminate in a real bonehead of a revelation.  In
addition, the prison officials are depicted as one-dimensional
caricatures--the brutal cell guard, the insensitive warden, etc.--and the
inmates are even more clichéd.  This subtracts from the drama, and provides
an embarrassing backdrop to all the anthropological philosophizing.</P>
<P>        Hopkins, however, does a fine job as the troubled "ape man."  With
his flowing white hair and disheveled appearance, our first sighting of him
is a throwback to Sean Connery's character in "The Rock," shuffling,
manacled, and badly in need of a barber.  Or, come to think of it, Anthony
Hopkins' character in "The Mask of Zorro"!  Over the years, the 61-year-old
Hopkins has fine-tuned his ability to exhibit power and emotional depth
simply with his eyes and his softly-spoken delivery.  This isn't a
performance on a par with, say, Hannibal Lecter, but it's got its
fascinating moments.  Gooding, Jr. proves a satisfying complement to
Hopkins, but Maura Tierney ("Forces of Nature"), who plays Powell's
estranged daughter, isn't given much to do.</P>
<PRE>        Except to tear up in close-up, that is.</PRE>
<P>        Rather than dealing with serious psychological or celestial issues
like those in "Instinct" and "Phenomenon," Turteltaub might do better by
returning to lighter, "While You Were Sleeping"-type fare.</P>
