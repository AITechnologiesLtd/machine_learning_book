<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>Warner Oland's final appearance as Charlie Chan is marred because this is one of
the weaker episodes in the long running series. The story was too muddled and
not too crisply executed. Charlie and number one son, Lee (Luke), are in Monte
Carlo for a brief gambling vacation before going to Paris, where the son's art
work will be in an exhibition contest. When their taxi breaks down on the way to
the train station to catch the train to Paris and they are forced to walk, they
come across a luxury car with a dead bank messenger (Renavent), and there's also
a missing chauffeur, Ludwig (Bleifer), and a sports car speeding away from the
crime scene. Charlie on further investigation finds a rhinestone by the car and
footprints in the sand rubbed out. </P>
<P>In the events taking place on the night the murder was committed, Gordon Chase
(Kent), the brother of Joan Karnoff (Linaker) and secretary to her wealthy
financier husband Victor (Blackmer), learns that $25,000 in securities is
missing from Victor's safe. He tells his sister to get it back to him
immediately, since Victor is dumping these metallurgic securities on the market
to cause financial woes on his main rival Paul Savarin (Raquello). Joan was once
married to an American, Al Rogers (Lynn), who has a history as a petty thief
back in Chicago and is working as a bartender in the Hotel Imperial. She was
never divorced from him and is now being blackmailed for the bonds. In exchange
for the bonds, he won't tell Victor. He only wants cash in return for them and
refuses to turn them over to her when Joan pleads that she must return them to
Victor by tonight. Joan will then pawn her jewelry for the money and gets them
to Gordon just in time for her husband to give them to the messenger. </P>
<P>Victor tells them the dead messenger was carrying a million in bonds and accuses
Savarin of the crime, but he also says he's not worried because he was insured.
They also discover that Rogers tried to sell $25,000 in bonds that were
Victor's. Charlie's friend, the police chief, Jules Joubert (Huber), finds the
owner of the sports car is Evelyn Gray (Virginia Field), and Charlie discovers
it was her rhinestone that fell off her high heel shoe. On a police check, they
find Evelyn is a 24-year-old Londoner with no source of income but living in
luxury in one of Monaco's best hotels, dressed in furs, and driving an expensive
sports car. Upon questioning her, she admits she saw the dead man but did not
kill him. Soon a report comes that Ludwig was found dead in a marsh near the
crime scene. Charlie and Jules then discover Roger's body when they go to
question him, as the murderer tried to make it look like a suicide and left the
bag with the stolen bonds in his room. But Charlie notes there are $200,000 in
bonds missing and brings all the suspects together to tell them that the one who
took those missing bonds and then put them back in Victor's safe, is the killer
of three people and is presently in the room. </P>
<P>In the room all the suspects reveal how they could be the murderer: Savarin has
been using others to buy info on Victor, and tried to get a flight out of Nice
but canceled when he thought he would become accused of the murder. Evelyn is
Gordon's girlfriend but is really Savarin's and is using him to get info on
Victor, while receiving financial favors from both. It comes down to looking at
the blackmail angle and the romantic triangle, and how the wily Charlie puts all
the clues together. For comedy, Lee's misuse of French leads to some
embarrassing situations and Joubert's choppy English and inflated pride in his
bumbling police department leads to some amusing moments. </P>
