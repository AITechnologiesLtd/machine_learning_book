<PRE>PAPERBACK HERO (M).  
(Beyond Films/Polygram)
Director: Antony J Bowman
Stars: Hugh Jackman, Claudia Karvan, Jeanie Drynan, Andrew S Gilbert, 
Angie Milliken, Bruce 
Venables
Running time: 94 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Jack Willis (Hugh Jackman) drives a road train across the
Australian outback for a living.  To fill in time during the long
stretches of open road, he has written a novel, a mushy romance set
against the background of World War I.  Anxious to maintain his he-man
image, Jack submitted the novel to a Sydney publisher under the
pseudonym of Ruby Vale, a close friend.  The tomboyish Ruby (Claudia
Karvan, from Dating The Enemy, etc) owns the Boomerang Cafe in the
middle of nowhere and loves flying her old crop duster plane.  Ruby is
blissfully unaware of Jack's harmless deception until Ziggy (Angie
Milliken), a publishing representative, shows up.</P>
<P>Ziggy whisks Ruby off to Sydney on a whirlwind publicity tour
to promote the book, and Jack accompanies her, posing as her manager.
Romance slowly blossoms between the pair, who have always maintained a
polite distance back home.  As is the norm in these comedies, romance
does not always follow an easy path, although audiences will quickly
recognise where the film is headed.  Ruby eventually has to choose
between the adventurous and irreverent Jack or her fiance, the
fastidious stick-in-the-mud Hamish (Andrew S Gilbert), the local vet
who has his own views on marriage and the role of women.</P>
<P>Most of the fun with modern romantic comedies lies in the
journey that brings the two reluctant lovers together.  This rather
bland and innocuous romantic comedy from local writer/director Antony
J Bowman is cliched, and follows a somewhat predictable formula.
In some ways this is also a fish out of water scenario, as the outback
pair hit the unfamiliar bright lights of Sydney, and encounter the
false sincerity of industry parties.</P>
<P>The film derives its humour from the tension between Jack and
Ruby, and also from the gentle way in which Bowman pricks away at the
usual stereotypes.  However, his attitude towards the locals of the
small, unnamed outback town is a little patronising and condescending.
Despite the seven years that Bowman apparently spent perfecting the
script, Paperback Hero is still flawed, and some of its promising
ideas are not fully developed.</P>
<P>There is plenty of chemistry and sexual tension between stars
Jackman and Karvan, and there is enough genial wit to keep audiences
chuckling along for much of the duration.</P>
<P>Jackman, who has wowed audiences on stage in productions like
Sunset Boulevard, easily handles the transition to the big screen, and
makes the most of his role as a likeable larrikin.  He has the looks,
the presence and the charisma to become our next major international
film star if he chooses the right roles.  Karvan delivers a solid
performance as the no-nonsense Ruby.  Bowman's wife Jeanie Drynan
makes the most of her smaller role as Suzie, the manager of the
Boomerang cafe, who wants to establish her own independence.</P>
<P>Despite its faults, Paperback Hero is certainly much more
entertaining than the recent, abysmal Dear Claudia.  This lightweight
comedy does have its moments, and will please undemanding audiences!</P>
