                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Citizen Ruth (1996) ** out of ***** - Cast: Laura Dern, Swoosie Kurtz,
Kurtwood Smith, Mary Kay Place, Burt Reynolds, Kelly Preston, David Graf,
Alicia Witt, Tippi Hedren, Diane Ladd. Written by: Alexander Payne and Jim
Taylor. Directed by: Alexander Payne. Running Time: 105 minutes.</P>
<P>George Carlin once said that you can joke about anything. I believe that.
Although it helps when the joke is funny. "Citizen Ruth" tries to poke fun
at the abortion controversy raging in this country right now, and while the
subject isn't exactly known for its comedic potential, it would have been
possible for this film to be funny. But it's not. Mainly it comes across as
awkward.</P>
<P>Laura Dern plays Ruth Stoops, an indigent woman who has major drug problems
and has become pregnant for the fourth time. After being arrested, she faces
felony charges for indangering the life of her fetus. The judge then comes
to her and tells her to go and "take care" of her problem (which makes
absolutely no sense based on the crime which she was charged). Eventually,
organizations representing both sides of the issue are involved, and are
playing a game of tug-a-war with Ruth's situation. Neither side really cares
about Ruth herself, but are just using her to advance their agenda.</P>
<P>The character of Ruth Stoops needed to be sympathetic at some point for the
audience to care about her, but it never happens. Whenever she's not trying
to get high from paint or glue fumes, she's getting drunk, yelling,
screaming, crying, falling down stairs, beating up young children, or
punching herself in the stomach. It got to the point where the people who
were exploiting her came off more favorably than she actually did.</P>
<P>There are just a couple of good things about the film. One is a scene
involving a very perky pro-choice doctor and nurse. That scene made me
laugh. The other is Burt Reynolds. I like Burt, and I'm glad to see him
working. Other than that though, "Citizen Ruth" isn't very entertaining, and
mostly comes off as an unpleasant viewing experience. [R]</P>
