<P>I couldn't wait for that smarmy little brunette to die.</P>
<P>It's the near future, shortly after the Californian invasion of Buenos 
Aires which looks like a live action version of "The Jetsons" done by 
the cast of "90210".  (Albeit with considerably less animation.)  Here 
our pearly-teethed teens are beset with those eternal problems of the 
spirit: Who will win the big football game?  Who shall I go to the 
prom with?  Shall I join the military, dress up as a Nazi and lay 
waste to the known universe?  Since Michael "Bad SF is my middle name" 
Ironside is playing their mono-handed Civics teacher, we can safely 
arrive at two conclusions: (1) We are in Bad Movie heaven, (2) 
Universe, bend over.</P>
<P>Sure enough, uber-Aryan Johnny Rico (played by that famous Argentinean 
actor Casper Van Dien) ends up in the grunts and is sent across to the 
next sound stage for routine bastardisation in Movie Cliche #253 (Boot 
Camp).  His friends show considerably more sense and join the 
technical branches.  Johnny's lust-thang Carmen (played by the noted 
Hispanic thespian Denise Richards) becomes a pilot, where she grins 
like a prom-queen on Prozac as she hurls around million-ton starships.  
Since their buddy Carl (that noted Latin artist Neil Patrick Harris, 
aka Doogie Howser) can tell his ferret to crawl up his mother's leg, 
he naturally gets put in charge of grand strategy.  Only Dizzy (the 
up-and-coming Spanish performer Dina Meyer, known for her subtle, 
tear-jerking performance alongside Keanu Reeves in "Johnny Catatonic") 
also joins the infantry.  You see, Johnny is her lust-thang and she 
realises that as soon as she sleeps with him, she can be killed off 
and leave the movie.</P>
<P>Time passes, although all too slowly for the audience.  Carmen 
realises Johnny has the IQ of toast and sends him a "Dear Johnny" 
letter.  Dizzy, in an attempt to precipitate her own demise, shows her 
breasts.  In a training exercise, Johnny accidentally gets a fellow 
marine killed.  The other recruits - willing to have their limbs 
broken, trachea crushed and be stabbed and shot at by their drill 
instructor - find Johnny's clumsiness unacceptable and start dropping 
out of the program.  (Or maybe it was his acting they find 
unacceptable.)  But before Johnny can follow suite, the dreaded alien 
bugs fart an asteroid across the galaxy and squish Buenos Aires.  
Although Johnny's parents look relieved just before they are crushed, 
everyone else knows it's time to kick some arthropod butt!</P>
<P>Johnny and his grunts are choppered out to the Bug homeworld, where 
the starships are threatened by bugs belching nuclear plasma into 
orbit.  (I swear, I am not making this up.)  But Carmen's serotonin 
levels are still wildly over par and, grinning like the widow of a 
recently dead rock star, she hauls her ship out of the way.  Johnny 
and Co are meanwhile demonstrating the dazzling power of future 
military tactics: dump a bunch of guys armed with M16s on a planet and 
get them to wander around in a tight pack until they are eaten and 
thus show how the monster works.  Sure 'nuff, the bugs show up and 
have far more charisma than the rest of the cast.  Demoralised, the 
marines retreat, leaving their less likeable colleagues to be eaten.</P>
<P>Digression 1: The Starship Troopers Drinking Game<HR></P>
<P>- Sip whenever a limb is cut off.
- Quaff every time someone is cut in half.
- Sip whenever Diz lusts after Johnny.
- Quaff any time that smarmy little brunette smiles.
- Scull any time someone makes an heroic sacrifice.</P>
<P>The survivors are transferred to another unit, the 5th Generic Tough 
Hombres.  Quelle surprise - it's lead by Michael Ironside, still 
serving time in purgatory for "Highlander 2".  It seems they're 
getting sent to the poetically named "Planet P" to further the plot.  
But upon getting there, they are attacked by - giant mosquitoes!  (No, 
it's too terrible!)  Ironside makes Johnny promise to kill him should 
he ever be crippled.  Unfortunately Johnny doesn't reply, "If it comes 
to that, I'll do both of us."  The grunts come across a devastated 
firebase and a cowardly general.  He tells them that the bugs are 
sucking people's brains out (too late!)  and then gets eaten.  
Ironside has his legs chewed off by a bug and gets Johnny to kill him 
- not because he is crippled but because he is trapped in a crap film.  
Unfortunately Johnny doesn't cap the rest of the cast for equally 
debilitating mental injuries.  Subsequently, Dizzy gets chomped by a 
bug, because we got to see her breasts earlier on.</P>
<P>Back on the starship, they load Dizzy into a coffin and eject her into 
space so she can land on the Genesis planet and come back in the 
sequel "Starship Troopers 2: The Search for Plot".  Carmen struggles 
not to smile during the funeral, Dizzy's convenient death clearing the 
way for her and Johnny's lust-thang.  Then Doogie shows up, in full 
Gestapo regalia.  It now becomes clear why everyone looks like Nazis: 
the war is being run by geeks and geeky kids think that Nazi stuff is 
really cool.  Doogie explains he knew Johnny's team would be 
massacred, it was all part of the plan.  Johnny has no strong 
objections to this, illustrating a good reason why he is in the 
infantry and Doogie in command.  Anyway, the Doog-ster explains that 
since the bugs can launch asteroids from halfway across the galaxy and 
have them land right on top of cities, they must be intelligent.  
(Duh.)  So it's back to Planet P to catch a "brainbug".</P>
<P>Digression 2: Southpark Troopers
--------------------------------</P>
<P>Wouldn't this movie be all the more plausible if it was cheap 
animation and used the "Southpark" characters?</P>
<P>STAN:  Dude!  You're got a bug sucking your brains out!
CARTMAN:  I hate dat, da way dose bugs crawl up yo' ass and suck your 
   brains out.
KENNY:  Mi fnk ht d bgsar minhellgen.
KYLE:  Good point Kenny, there's probably a form of bug we haven't 
   seen yet, a brainbug.
BUG:  Arrrhhhhh!!!
STAN:  Oh my god!  They've killed Kenny!</P>
<P>Back they go to the disused quarries of Planet P. But Carmen and the 
faux competitor for her affections, Zander (hitherto known as 
"Deadmeat"), crash on the planet in the middle of the attack.  They 
are captured by the bugs and before Carmen can explain her "don't 
worry, be happy" philosophy to the insects, they suck Zander's brain.  
Johnny gives a stirring speech that they can't just go and rescue her, 
because the attack is too important.  He then goes and rescues her.  
Meanwhile the other troops have caught the brainbug.  And who better 
to mindmeld with a giant slug than Doogie Howser!  He does the Spock 
thang and announces that the brainbug is afraid.</P>
<PRE>So am I Doogie, so am I.</PRE>
<P>Digression 3: Five Military SF Books That Would Make Better Films<HR></P>
<PRE>1. The Forever War
2. The Forever War
3. The Forever War
4. The Forever War
5. Any Lensman book.</PRE>
<P>Humour mode off.  There will undoubtedly be those who will defend 
"Starship Troopers" by saying that it is a comedy.  Certainly there 
are moments that are intended to be funny, but it is no more a comedy 
than "Total Recall" or "Robocop".  Similarly, some may say that the 
future depicted is meant to be dystopian and terrible.  The lie is put 
to this by again invoking Verhoeven's other two SF films.  Both of 
them depicted unpleasant regimes, even ones with which the characters 
cooperated and supported.  But the heroes never liked their worlds, 
nor showed it as a viable or desirable one.  If Verhoeven is 
attempting to be satirical, he fails utterly and my suspicion is that 
he is attempting to have it both ways, to both laugh at and cheer the 
fascist, testosterone-poisoned, gungho histrionics.  The situation is 
not helped by a wooden cast that can only aspire to being B-grade, 
dialogue that gives the word "cliche" a bad name, and a plot that 
could be second guessed by undiscovered tribes in the Phillipine 
jungles.</P>
<P>"Starship Troopers" is possibly the worst SF movie ever made [0/bomb], 
a leprous turd of a film that's so horribly demented that it 
immediately is assumed into the pantheon of Truly Bad Movies, with a 
crassness score of 4 Lamberts.  In fact it is so terrible that you 
should rush out and see it now because you will not believe how bad it 
is.  Tuberculosis on the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
