<PRE>Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 31 December 1997 with Tony for free at the Loews Village VII</P>
<P>As 007 movies go, *Tomorrow Never Dies* provides is a lively entry with
the sexually appealing Pierce Brosnan in his second outing as the fourth
James Bond to grace the series. For reasons that are not completely clear
to me, I have seen a lot of action/adventure movies this year, but this is
the one that *intentionally* made me laugh. Unlike American pictures, the
Brits prove once again that a keen whit can coexist with explosions. I was
laughing within the first five minutes, and the mile-high flames ensued
about three minutes afterward. </P>
<P>In general, if you've seen one 007 movie, you have seen them all. What
separates them is the strength of the characters and the execution of the
formula. Here, media mogul Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) engineers the
makings of World War III between China and the UK by rearranging GPS
signals, forcing the Chinese to think their waters are being breached,
while manipulating the British into thinking they sank their destroyer,
when he sank it himself. </P>
<P>Like most 007 movies, the movie makes the most of location shooting, with
a parking garage car chase in Hamburg and a helicopter-motorcycle chase in
Bangkok, after a spectacular fall from an office tower. </P>
<P>As James Bond, Pierce Brosnan is probably the most sexually appealing of
the actors to play the role of the British agent. He is prone to wearing
open denim shirts than tuxedos and suits like his predecessors. The "Bond
Girls" this time around are the horrible Teri Hatcher as Carver's wife
"Paris," and the formidable Michelle Yeoh as Chinese agent Wai Lin. 
Luckily, Hatcher disappears after the first reel, and seeing Yeoh and
Brosnan handcuffed together on a motorcycle while being chased by a
helicopter was very entertaining. </P>
<P>The villains are equally good. Pryce is perfectly cast as the billionaire
maniac, a 1990s *Dr. No*, assisted by the evil Stamper (Gutz Otto), an
able successor to 007 villains like Jaws or Odd Job. Carver's visage
appears in a variety of places throughout the movie, projected on TV
screens and hanging from the side of a skyscraper, much like Big Brother
in *1984*.  Also requisite is the 007 gadgetry, and they outdo themselves
this time as Q (Desmond Llewelyn--who has played Q since 1964's
*Goldfinger*) presents Bond with a car he can operate with a finger on a
touchpad on his cellular phone. Judi Dench continues nicely as Bond's boss
tough M, as does Samantha Bond as Moneypenny. Joe Don Baker appears
briefly as a buffoonish American military man.</P>
