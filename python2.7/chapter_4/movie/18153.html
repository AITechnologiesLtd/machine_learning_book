LES VISITEURS
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>In 1993 the biggest grossing film of all times was Steven
Spielberg's JURASSIC PARK. Although it made a lot of money
outside US markets, the audience in many countries seemed to
feel guilty about enjoying just another product of American
cultural imperialism. So, in the mid 1990s many non-US film
industries presented their own products, proudly noting that
they had beaten JURASSIC PARK at their own box-offices. In
case of France, that product was LES VISITEURS, 1993 comedic
fantasy directed by Jean-Marie Poire and written by
Christian Clavier.</P>
<P>The plot begins in 12th Century France where Count Godefroy
de Montmirail (played by Jean Reno) saves the life of King.
For that, he is awarded by permission to marry his beloved
Frenegonde (Valerie Lemercier). Unfortunately, the witch
poisons his wine with hallucinogens, so Godefroy kills
Frenegonde's father. With Frenegonde deciding to go to the
convent, desperate Godefroy and his trusted servant
Jacquasse (Christian Clavier) seek the help of wizard who
would bring them back in time and prevent the tragedy. The
senile wizard botches the spell and sends them to 20th
Century instead. There they must confront not only the
strange world, full of wonders and dangers - they are faced
with their own descendants, that look exactly like them. One
of them is Jacquasse's descendant Jacquart (also played by
Christian Clavier), who managed to turn the caste tables and
now owns ancient Godefroy's castle.</P>
<P>LES VISITEURS happened to be rude awakening for all of those
who grew up on Anglo-American pop culture only, and expected
any French movie to be noble artistic endeavour compared
with Hollywood products. That shouldn't surprise anyone,
since it was hard to expect that non-commercial oriented
product could beat Spielberg. Poire and Clavier, of course,
knew better and decided to make their film just like any
average Hollywood hack - "high concept" comedy, few
computer-generated special effects, and lots of gags with
the most hilarious ones, as usual, wasted in trailers. The
humour, that should rely on the conflict between medieval
and modern world often sinks to toilet levels. The plot is
too complicated, considering that screenwriters don't pay
much attention to it. Christian Clavier also doesn't help
much with his own obnoxious Jim Carey-style over-acting. On
the other hand, Jean Reno, until that role associated
strictly with Besson, proves that he is capable comedian.
This film is still funny, and those viewers who are somewhat
more familiar with French and European history would
appreciate it even more. But, the end result is still one
big disappointment - excellent idea wasted in third-rate
effort.</P>
