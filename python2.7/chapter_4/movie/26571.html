<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A very curious and strange b/w film, which is a hard to classify oddity,
involving the nightmare of a lonely, sexually repressed, psychotic
woman, called in the titles The Gamin (Adrienne Barrett). There is no
dialogue or narrator in the first version I saw, but in the later
version Ed McMahon does the narration.</P>
<P>The film plays as a surreal nightmare for The Gamin, who is in a
skid-row Hollywood hotel,
where she imagines that she is taking a walk in the ocean and disappears
in a giant wave. What follows is a visionary tale of Freudian images and
those from those B-movies after WW11.</P>
<P>When she goes to open the bureau drawer and finds a switchblade knife
there, she takes it with her as she leaves her room to go out at night,
walking down the stairs to witness a beat cop arresting the abusive
husband of her downstair's neighbor. She then walks in an alley of
winos. When one of the winos grabs her and refuses to let go, her
detective father (Ben Roseman) gets out of his police car, and beats the
wino up, while she stands by gleefully laughing.</P>
<P>A midget newspaper vender sells her a copy of the Hollywood Tribune,
whose headline is 'Mysterious Stabbing.' She is then picked up by a
villainous smoothy, with a slim moustache, dressed in a black shirt and
tie. The Evil One (Barron) takes a flower from the flower girl for his
lapel, and then sells The Gamin to someone who looks like Orson Welles,
The Rich Man (Bruno Ve Sota), who takes her for a ride, with both
sitting in the back seat.</P>
<P>He takes her to the Club Pronto, where he smokes a big cigar and they
watch a sexy female dancer perform. Demonic memories come back to her of
her father sitting in bed in his undershirt, drinking whiskey and
slapping her, and of her mother dressed up while lounging on the sofa
eating some sweets. In the background is a cemetery with gravestones for
her father and mother. When the father discovers a cigar in the ashtray
from another man, he shoots his wife. The Gamin then sticks her
switchblade in his belly.</P>
<P>These are some very weird Freudian dream sequences. In another scene,
she goes with The Rich Man to his apartment and listens to him play the
piano, then he rebuffs her offer of a drink, instead sitting down to the
elegant meal his butler brings him, eating the chicken with his hands.
When he goes to kiss her after the meal, he repulses her and becomes her
second stabbing victim. But he grasps her pendant while struggling,
which she will get back when she cuts off his hand, as the narrator
tells her not to be afraid of the ghouls around the dead man's body,
they won't touch her. She will deposit the severed hand with the pendant
into the basket of the flower girl.</P>
<P>In the shadowy street, she's being trailed by the cop who has the same
face as her father. In order to escape, she goes into the apartment of
the Evil One, which is a drug house, where jazz is played by Shorty
Rogers and the Giants, an interracial couple is hotly dancing, and the
Evil One is kissing two pretty women who are at his table. Her smiling
father comes into the club and gets an envelope from the Evil One. The
rich man reappears, with his head peering through the window bars of the
cellar apartment, and the same beat cop from before, is standing over
him and smiling. Inside the apartment everyone is pointing at her,
including her father, who is also waving handcuffs in the air, which he
indicates are meant for her.</P>
<P>She once again sees herself drowning and the camera returns to a shot of
her hotel room, as this nightmare ends. But the narrator poses the
question, is it a dream of madness on a dark night -- or was it real?</P>
<P>This is a bizarre film, a precursor to Welles' "Touch of Evil" and
Polansky's
"Repulsion." If not made to be understandable, it is at least a very
demanding depiction of someone demonically possessed by guilt.</P>
