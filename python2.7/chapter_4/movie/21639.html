<P>In 312 A.D. as the Roman Emperor Constantine's army was about to do 
battle with Maxentius, a Christian cross appeared in the sky, with 
the words "In hoc signum vinces" ("with this sign, you will win"). 
Constantine did win, had this inscription placed on his imperial 
standards and decreed that Christianity was the Empire's official 
religion.</P>
<P>"The Insider" is Michael Mann's best film to date, as well as one of 
the best of the year. Its subject is a factual, specific case, but 
even more importantly, the background and the obvious subtext are 
about capitalist greed, the kind whose emblem should be "with this 
sign, you will win" around the image of money, whether a dollar, a 
mark, a euro or whatever.</P>
<P>The film probably holds the all-time record for legal maneuvers, 
clearances, consultations and precautions, before and during its 
making. This, because it is a docudrama whose "docu" aspect could 
invite anything, from blocking its release to lawsuits.</P>
<P>The story is familiar to most of the American public. Biochemist 
Jeffrey Wigand, Ph.D, was an R & D vice-president at Brown & 
Williamson, the third largest tobacco company. He earned $300,000 a 
year plus perks. Suddenly he is fired, arbitrarily. By signing a 
confidentiality agreement he keeps such perks as health insurance. 
But when asked to sign another, far more stringent document, he 
refuses.</P>
<P>Worried, bitter, even scared of reprisals, Wigand contacted Lowell 
Bergman, .a "60 Minutes" producer at CBS,  An expose of B & W --and, 
by implication, the other cigarette-makers whom Wigand calls "the 
seven dwarfs"--  was to be telecast by Mike Wallace, with Wigand 
present. But several factors intervened, mainly the fear that a 
lawsuit against CBS by the nicotinizers could run into billions and 
result in the smoke-Godzilla obliterating the CBS Mothra.</P>
<P>Centering on the actions and reaction of Bergman and Wigand, the 
movie does a very good job of depicting the implications, 
complications, side-effects and ramifications of the case, and of 
taking the viewer through the dedalus of (mostly) genuine facts and 
events. This task is greatly helped by brilliant performances, a 
high budget put to (mostly) good use, a strong sense of dialogue and 
production values.</P>
<P>Michael Mann is widely known for his TV work, notably the "Miami 
Vice" series. Since 1981, he also directed the theatrical movies 
"Thief," "The Keep," "Manhunter," "The Last of the Mohicans," and 
"Heat." It is an honorable record, generally influenced by TV's 
techniques and larger-than-life tendencies.</P>
<P>Deliberately, the movie adopts a super-visual approach. Mann, with
cinematographer Dante Spinotti ("L.A. Confidential," "True Colors," 
"The Last of the Mohicans) and editor William Goldenberg ("Heat") go 
all out in this direction.</P>
<P>"The Insider" opens with a long prologue in which an American in 
some unnamed Middle Eastern country, is taken, blindfolded, on a 
mysterious ride (full of local color) to meet a mysterious Arab 
sheik, the leader of a terrorist group. The man from the West turns 
out to be Mike Wallace ( Christopher Plummer) there for a scoop, a 
hard-to-get interview. Why this hors d'oeuvre? To build up the 
powerful, take-no-prisoners persona of Wallace. To remind us of his 
tough style. To spell out his high standards.</P>
<P>The movie-Wallace will reappear many times in the course of the 
picture. Plummer is very good, yet it may be difficult to suspend 
one's disbelief since the real Wallace's face, so familiar and 
distinctive keeps coming to mind. So does Al Pacino's. That's the 
price of fame.</P>
<P>There are no such problems with the other performers. You watch with 
conviction the complex --and in the last analysis, mysterious-- 
Wigand, incarnated by the excellent, Australian-raised Russell Crowe 
("Proof," "L.A. Confidential")-- artfully made older and heavier. 
Yet even if Pacino remains Pacino, his intensity does help in making 
us accept him as Lowell Bergman. Tricky stuff.</P>
<P>Did I say tricky? The Middle East prologue (shot in Israel) is a 
harbinger of razzle-dazzle cinematography. Incessantly, every small 
or big filmmaking trick comes into play. Angles, slow motion, 
focusing, zooming, crawls, video footage, the steadicam, 
reflections, extreme close-ups, nightmares and daymares, color 
symbolism, you name it. Nothing was left out.</P>
<P>This both works and does not. Sometimes you think you're watching an 
avant-garde, experimental or "art" movie. Sometimes it might  give 
one sea-sickness. Sometimes it is like an honest-to-goodness 
documentary. Sometimes it looks like a solid "traditional" drama. 
What is certain is that Mann & Co. went for overkill, ignoring the 
"less is more" principle, adopting a "more is more" stance. The 
result is that your eyes get fatigued, that they may need 
stabilizers, that things can get muddled.</P>
<P>Even so I will not rain on Mann's parade. In spite of all those 
distractions, it does keep you in a state of concentration which 
demands of you not to miss anything. It is a peculiar situation 
which will doubtlessly require a second or third viewing before you 
come to a valid conclusion. More viewings at nearly two hours and 
forty minutes? Yes, since the film has its own, special fascination. 
Even confirmed addicts who normally yearn for a smoking break will 
stay put and not think of the weed.</P>
<P>Tobacco reigns here, satanically.  It is a clear-cut fact that the 
tobacco giants are proven liars. They cook the cigarettes' nicotine 
with chemicals which make the smokes even more addictive -- more so, 
it seems,  than many hard drugs. The corporations are worse than 
gangsters or mafiosi. They commit mass murders, from greed, for 
profit. It is capitalistic materialism at its worst and deadliest. 
They, and other mega-corporations run the country. And, while the 
techniques of the movie are exaggerated, its message does not seem 
to be.</P>
<P>We are a long way from Frank Capra's America I Love You or The 
Little People Win Over The Big Nasties. Or put it this way. This is 
all about the dark side of Capra, a side that he would play down. 
The fact that Wigand aided the lawsuits instigated by the Sovereign 
State of  Mississippi and joined by all the other States of the 
Union to force the tobacco industry onto a 246 billion (that's a 
"b") settlement, still is light years away from a Capraesque happy 
ending.</P>
<P>There are puzzling moments as well as privileged ones. Samples: 
Bruce McGill as a Mississippi lawyer shouting down and shutting up a 
B & W lawyer, in the best Southern style of forceful, colorful 
rhetoric. Gina Gerson's handsome, chic and cool CBS legal eagle 
bringing in bad news. A transitional section after the Pascagoula 
sequence in which strings and a male voice do a beautiful, 
mood-enhancing, dirge-like song. Cleverly too,  the script avoids 
simplistic black-and-white contrasts as it follows the twists of "60 
Minutes" painting itself into a corner.</P>
<P>Pointed digs are numerous. Samples: when referring to the armies of 
lawyers hired by the tobacco industry, Ken Starr's firm is among 
them. Or aging Mike Wallace speaking of his future: "I don't plan to 
spend the rest of my days wandering in the wilderness of PBS!"</P>
<P>The cast is of near-epic size, yet most appearances are short and to 
the point. Machinations and counter-plots, on both sides, are 
effective. The thriller aspect of the movie is powerful. The story 
is not especially easy to follow. In certain areas one will cavil at 
confusions which Alfred Hitchcock would scold. Yet credit the film 
for not spoon-feeding its audience.</P>
