<PRE>                         LEAVE IT TO BEAVER 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon

Screenplay: Brian Levant & Lon Diamond</P>
<P>Having to grow up with great paternal expectations hanging over your
shoulder sure dampens ones creativity and self-initiative. I'm sure
anyone who has lived the experience, will acknowledge that they were
once little boys with impossible-to-please-fathers, who were once little
boys with impossible-to-please-fathers. So the merry-go-round keeps
going round until somewhere along the way, the chain breaks. The idea of
parenting is to guide, not take over your kid's life.</P>
<P>LEAVE IT TO BEAVER is best remembered as the popular 60's family series
that was full of morals and lessons learnt in childhood. It hits the
screens once again, this time the big screen. Beaver your average nice,
but non-too bright kid is trying to get a new bike of mum and dad. At
the same time he wants to make dad proud of him, by playing football and
wanting to be a doctor. Gosh, is that really what parents want for their
kids nowadays? Things come to a head when the bike gets stolen and
Beaver wants to drop out of the footy team – a mid-childhood crisis.</P>
<P>Having goals and expectations for your children is not necessarily a bad
thing, if it lies in your child's best interests. However, there is a
tendency for some parents to selfishly live out their own private
agendas through their children. Parents are always looking for an excuse
to be proud of their child. Some will go over the top and murder their
daughter's rival for cheer group leading, but on the whole most parents
are down to earth enough to just brag about their kid's grades, sporting
achievements etc to relatives, friends or anyone with a ready ear.</P>
<P>So after scoring a goal, finding his bike and ending up inside a giant
coffee mug, Beaver finally gets his dad to accept him for who he is and
not for what he would like him to be. A more a less important message
for over achieving parents. Janine Turner (NORTHERN EXPOSURE) is an
unusual choice for Mrs Cleaver. She vacuums in pearls, her hair is
permed and dyed blonde, and she carries a perpetual smile on her face.
Somehow, beneath this veneer of maternal perfection, one can see her
silently screaming to be released from her apron string bondage. Mr
Beaver (Christopher McDonald) seems grumpier than in the 60's series,
whilst Wally Cleaver (Eric von Detten) seems an overall nicer older
brother.</P>
<P>LEAVE IT TO BEAVER is not amongst the best children films released these
holidays, but at least it has something important to say about
parenting.</P>
