<P>   If director Paul Weitz truly has his finger on the pulse of 
American teens and collegians, box offices around the
country will not soon be saying bye bye this "American
Pie."  A raunchy and sometimes sweet tale marrying George
Lucas's 1973 classic "American Graffiti" to Bob
Clark's take on a lusty bunch of South Florida high-
schoolers, "Porky's," Weitz's comedy deals with a group of
senior boys determined to shed their virginity before
graduation day.  With Adam Herz's script pulling out sit-
comish stops and getting an overdrive boost from slick editing
that takes us quickly from one chaste high-school senior to
the others, "American Pie" is a fun film for the summer that
pushes the "There's Something About Mary" envelope.  Yet it
easily avoids the dreaded NC-17 by keeping private parts
off-limits to the audience throughout its just-right 95 minutes
of tenure.  </P>
<P>   If Trey Parker's hilarious "South Park," which opened just
days earlier, forms an accurate, if heightened caricature of
how 12-year-olds actually talk when parents are not around,
Paul Weitz's "American Pie" does likewise for the 18-year-old
set whose obsessive conversations give new meaning to the
concept "coming of age."  The sexual revolution either has
never filtered down to middle-class high schools in America
or has already gone through a Thermidorian reaction,
because the particular fellas whose hopes and dreams are
conceived by scripter Adam Herz are all NATO--no action, talk 
only.  Why is all their verbal promiscuity followed up by virtually 
nothing involving the southern regions of their torsos?  As Dr. 
Freud might say, these dudes are in conflict.  On the surface, 
they all want it.  Deep down, they're scared out of their minds of women. 
Some of these clean-cut juveniles are darn good looking with
good futures ahead of them.  Each time they get close to
their goal of polluting themselves, they self-destruct by
bragging openly and thereby showing their fear of and
hostility toward the alluring females.  What they really want is
not fulfillment with the opposite sex but stature with their own.</P>
<P>   Parents should not be alarmed if their teenagers are more
interested in sex than in Shakespeare.  Hormones are
vigorous, perhaps more energetic in people their age than
they will be at any other time in their lives.  One
understanding, if dippy, individual who grasps this is Jim's
Dad (Eugene Levy), a well-meaning fellow with eyebrows that
rival John L. Lewis's and a confident tone belied only by an
occasional hesitation in his voice.  When he catches his boy
(Jason Biggs) masturbating in the bedroom to a porn tape, he
sizes up the situation, reassuring Jim's mom about the TV
program: "it's only bad reception."   Jim's pop stands in for
the kind of dad that every kid would love to have for his own
while being simultaneously embarrassed by him.  Having no
anxieties about his young one's introduction to the lives of
birds and bees, he enthusiastically plunges magazines of
varying degrees of pornography into his kid's hands,
explaining each centerfold as might your favorite biology
teacher.</P>
<P>   "American Pie" highlights an ensemble cast that play off
one another so well that you'd swear that they'd spent their
four years of secondary school in the same classes.  They're
fond of one another but like all adolescents they are given to
ribbing and jiving because each is so temperamentally
different.  While the onanistic Jim (Biggs) metaphorically
settles for playing squash instead of tennis, his athletic pal
Oz (Chris Klein) is forever getting caught by the ladies in
boasting falsely of his conquests.  Finch (Eddie Kaye
Thomas), on the other hand, comes across as a fan of Oscar
Wilde, running home when nature calls because he will not
use the slovenly seats that his school's bathrooms provide;
Stifler (Sean William Scott) is a boor who regularly opens his
lavish home for parties; Sherman (Chris Owen) is the classic
geek whose major sexual activity consists of wetting his
pants while disconcerted; and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is
under pressure from his girl friend Vicky (Tara Reid) to
confess his love.</P>
<P>   As in so many "Porky's" type films, the strong parts all go
to the males, while women like Vicky and Oz's new love
interest Heather (Mena Suvari) largely react to the male
advances and set the rules of the games.  Only Jessica
(Natasha Lyonne), a liberated Dear Abby type who advises
both male and female classmates about getting it on, and
Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), a promiscuous foreign exchange
student, could be considered assertive, independent and
confident enough to make their own advances and treat
sexuality as good, healthy fun.  Indeed the best quote in the
movie comes from Jessica who, when told by her virginal pal
Vicky that she wants the right time and the right place for her
first sexual encounter, responds sharply, "It's not a space
shuttle launch: it's sex!"</P>
<P>   While little in "American Pie" could be called original, the
film breaks ground by the staggering number of gross-out
situations and objects.  The include masturbation with a sock;
sexual congress with a freshly-baked apple pie; a suspicious
liquid found in a glass of beer that leads a hapless 
drinker to an extended session of regurgitation; a rash of
ribald rhetoric that everyone in the audience has heard
before; and just one hard-to-take setting in the school
women's room to which the finicky Finch has repaired
following his consumption of a drink doctored with a laxative.</P>
<P>   Like the usual high-school movies, this one culminates in a
prom, but this time no queen is chosen.  Instead a band of
fellows and gals reach the climax of their lives and undergo 
the bittersweet realization that not wedding bells, but college,
will be breaking up that old gang of theirs.  "American Pie"
has moments of genuine romance but while it's not "An Ideal
Husband," neither is the film an anarchic "Animal House." 
Weitz and Herz have fun with their young ensemble but both
scripter and director convey a sincere interest in the lives and
concerns of these young people.  Any parents who think that
their own adolescents are not like these pubescent yet
inexperienced youngsters just haven't been listening.</P>
