<P>Rating: Rating: Near Miss  (2 out of 4 stars)</P>
<P>Towne and Woo take some chances with the burgeoning Mission Impossible
franchise and I'd like to say they pay off
handsomely. Fact is, they might owe you some change back. The pair,
under the supervision of producer Tom Cruise, have
tried to make the movie more intimate, cutting down the multi-character
team concept of the series and previous film, into an
american version of the Bond franchise. It's a star turn for Cruise and
he projects a sinewy sexiness with the material at hand.
It's just a shame he didn't have more to work with.</P>
<P>In paring down unessential elements, Towne neglected to strengthen what
was left. Relationships are left one sided and
motivations are murky. They've tried to make a humanistic spy film, but
stopped short of fleshing out the characters. Even the
main story  is simplistic, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.</P>
<P>Mission Impossible agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is called upon to recover a
package stolen by  renegade IMF agent Sean
Ambrose (Scott). IMF knows nothing about the package, save it is of
value and a potential threat to the world. In a prickly
meeting with his supervisor (an unbilled and Machiavellian flavored
Anthony Hopkins), Hunt is told he can assemble any IMF
members he deems necessary to his mission, but first and foremost, he
must enlist the aid of  master thief, Nyah Hall (Newton).
Eventually, we're shown that the package is the antidote to a lethal
super virus code named Chimera, which was developed
under the supervision of an evil pharmaceutical supervisor. Ambose aims
to loose the virus upon the world, holding the only
cure in is possession. It's not the most muscular of premises, but it's
solid and has potential.</P>
<P>Rather than have the audience simply "oh" and "ah" at the special
effects, Towne has admirably tried to set up some intriguing
character motivations. Hunt and Ambrose have a history from their IMF
days. It's one filled with mutual dislike and perhaps a
touch of jealousy on Ambrose's part. Nothing more is said about it.
Ambrose has a homicidal hatred of Hunt and properly
explored, could have given their confrontations far more impact that
good guy fights the bad guy. It's a tango performed with
shoelaces tied. It's a dance of death in which both sides stumble. Why
does Ambrose hate Hunt so? What made him leave
IMF? Was Cruise recruited to go after him because of the unspoken past
history? These are questions left unanswered.</P>
<P>Ambrose is unremarkable in his villainy. He is simply a petulant, greedy
and clever man. He isn't given any idiosyncrasies that
make him particularly fearsome or memorable. Seeing Hopkins brief
visage, I couldn't help but think of the menace of his
Hannibal Lechter character and how this film could have benefited from
such a chill inducing villain. Instead we're treated to
meglomaniac-lite.</P>
<P>Cruise and Newton not only are requisite gorgeous to look at, they  draw
you in with their "you are my soul mate" looks they
give each other. They share a primal attraction that is tastefully
shown. There are no shots of bare breasts, or lingeringly filmed,
titillating sex scenes. They don't seek to learn much from each other,
content to bask in each other's presence. If not for the
strength of Cruise's personality and the waif-like vulnerability of
Newton, the scenes, wispy as they are, could have fallen flat.
As it stands, there is a certain charm to watching their interaction.
Heaving a huge stone into pond of their relationship is the
revelation that Nyah once was Ambrose's lover. Instead of this fact
causing a ripple effect with later events, it makes nary a
splash.</P>
<P>Another misstep by Towne and Woo is that we aren't shown why Nyah would
have been attracted to Ambrose. Because of
this, their encounters are drained of dramatic tension. Just as with
Hunt and Ambrose, the dramatic impact is dulled by not
having more back story on the pair. For Ambrose's part, his attraction
seems based upon a pure animal lust, evidenced in an
almost comical scene where Nyah disrobes in front of him and his jaw
drops in glassy eyed lust. I felt as if I was watching the
Big Bad Wolf sizing up Goldilocks.</P>
<P>At times, the scenes of exposition with the characters becomes clock
watchingly slow. Fortunately the action scenes, which are
back loaded at the end of the movie are gripping, beautiful and just
plain fun to watch. Hunt breaks into the pharmacy company
in a sequence that whispers of the memorable Pentagon break-in scene in
the first Mission Impossible movie. Hunt, time and
again, dispatches foes with Woo's trademark, slow motion, ballet style
martial arts. Here's where the film really flexes it's
muscles.</P>
<P>Woo throws it all at us, explosions, car chases, motorcycle chases, two
fisted gun battles underscored by classical music, each
done in his distinctive style. Older time Woo fans will smile knowingly
at his usage of religious backdrops and birds on the wing.
There's an engrossing fight between Hunt and Ambrose that is thrilling
not just due to the camera work, which shows you the
impact of each blow, but the lack of music. It's a mano a mano fight
where all that is heard for periods are the sounds of kicks
landing and grunts of pain. Hunt doesn't dispatch Ambrose easily. It's
fight in which there is a sense of failure on Hunt's part, no
mean feat.</P>
<P>In stripping away the team feel of the movie, Ving Rhames, in particular
gets the proverbial short end of the stick. A resourceful and powerful
screen presence, he is reduced to being a one dimensional sidekick. It's
painful to see the big man shoehorned
into such a miniscule role. His character seems to be around only as a
link to the first film. Despite it's flaws, his portrayal of a
good agent finding redemption was a nice side story to the first film.</P>
<P>MI:2 is a fun, thrilling to watch film when it's not dragging itself
through the mire of exposition. With the talents behind such films as
Chinatown (Towne), the Killer and Face/Off (Woo), I expected a bit more.
It's entertaining fare, but hardly the stuff of
memorable movie going.</P>
