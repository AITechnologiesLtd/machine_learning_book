<PRE>ANNA AND THE KING
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Exhilaration please, not exhaustion.  Full of self-importance, directors
this Christmas season have lost all sense of proportion.  Movies seem to
take an eternity for no discernable reason.</P>
<P>In his non-musical ANNA AND THE KING, rather than giving us something
for our minds and our hearts, Andy Tennant gives us butt-numbing length
as we watch what is admittedly an absolutely gorgeous picture.  The
cinematography (Caleb Deschanel), the sets (Ian Whittaker and Luciana
Arrighi), the costumes (Jenny Beavan) and the music (George Fenton) are
all absolutely dazzling.  But with Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes's
pedestrian script, there is little to engage us.  The net result of such
beauty, scored to lush orchestral music, is to literally put us to sleep
as it did several men, women and children in my packed audience.</P>
<P>The fault does not lie with the actors.  Jodie Foster, as Anna, and Chow
Yun-Fat, as King Mongkut, do respectable jobs.  Foster meticulously
shows her carefully controlled anger, and Yun-Fat confidently moves with
a graceful fluidity.  The chemistry between them is never quite
believable, but it really isn't their fault.  The written material they
have to work with is awkward, and Tennant's direction is languid.  In a
key scene, for example, in which blowing up a bridge quickly is the key
to survival, Tennant has his actors move with a glacial pace.</P>
<P>We get the point that the Siamese in the picture do not speak proper
English, and their butchered English syntax and semantics can be funny.
But, after a while, this repetitive joke gets quite tiresome.  Let them
at least accidentally speak a few sentences of correct English
occasionally.</P>
<P>So would songs have been an improvement?  You bet!  Anything to put some
of the old magic back into the story.  Visuals are important, but they
aren't enough to carry a picture.  ANNA AND THE KING needs something to
make it compelling, and a few songs certainly wouldn't hurt.</P>
<P>ANNA AND THE KING runs way too long at 2:22.  A large part of the film
is in Thai with English subtitles.  It is rated PG-13 for some intense
violent sequences.  Given the explicitness of the bloody caning and some
of the other scenes, the film might have been more appropriately rated
R.  It would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
