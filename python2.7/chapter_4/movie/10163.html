<P>"Sequels suck!" explains Randy (Jamie Kennedy), one of the survivors
from last year's surprise box office hit SCREAM.  SCREAM was a
breakthrough film, spoofing the very horror films of the 70s and 80s
which caused the demise of the horror genre.  The characters in SCREAM
had seen those same slasher films and were familiar with them.  They
discussed the cliches, and at the same time, SCREAM used those cliches
by renewing and updating them.  Director Wes Craven had a lot of fun
slamming the genre he helped create, which was ruined by countless and
inferior sequels.  But that doesn't mean that there aren't good
sequels.  The characters in SCREAM 2 openly discuss superior sequels
(ALIENS, THE GODFATHER PART 2, TERMINATOR 2), but this also puts
pressure on Craven and writer Kevin Williamson to create a good enough
sequel as to not become one of the sequels made fun of in the SCREAM
saga.</P>
<P>And SCREAM 2 delivers.  Again, characters are put into a situation of
terror, but while SCREAM had more broad humor, SCREAM 2 is focused
more on the satirical edge of the SCREAM franchise.  The sequel to the
hit SCREAM talks about sequels openly, but what is lacking this time
around is genuine scares, which made the original a hit.  Many of
these moments were everyone's favorite: the "jump" moments.  I love
these moments, because...  well, it scares me.  SCREAM had many of
these moments.  What makes them so effective isn't the sudden
appearance of some unexpected person in the shot, but the loud musical
chord that accompanies the action on screen.  These moments are
incredibly scary, making viewers literally jump in their seats.
SCREAM 2 has fewer of these than its predecessor, and those it does
have aren't as scary.</P>
<P>SCREAM 2 begins in the same way SCREAM did, but much less scarier, and
more satirically.  It opens in a movie theater showing a sneak preview
of STAB!, a filmed version of Gale Weathers' best-selling novel The
Woodsboro Murders, which is based on the murders from the original
film (in essence, we have the movie SCREAM on the screen in SCREAM 2).
We meet two characters standing in line (Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps),
who discuss the teen slasher genre.  Both characters are black, and
Pinkett points out that black people are no where present in horror
films of this kind (as a result, Craven places many black characters
into the film).  In the theater, Ghostface costumes are handed to
every audience member, most of whom don the costume for the film.
However, lurking in the theater is a real killer, wearing the same
costume.  Trying to guess which one it is is the most suspenseful
moment in this scene.  Pinkett's comments are perfect and exactly what
most people said to the original film.  During the opening scene of
STAB!, Casey Becker (Heather Graham) gets phones calls just like Drew
Barrymore did in the original film.  Pinkett yells at the screen,
"Hang up and Star-69 his ass!"  In the end, two people end up dead,
and the serial killings begin once again.</P>
<P>With the two recent killings, reporters begin showing up, and among
them is Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), who has now gathered a small fan
club (including Laurie Metcalf from TV's "Roseanne").  Also to show up
is Dewey "Dwight" Riley (David Arquette), who now walks with a limp
due to his stab wound a couple years earlier.  Weathers has a new
cameraman (Duane Martin) who has no idea of the events which occurred
a couple years before.  As sequels go, "the body count is always
higher," and so a bigger cast is introduced.  There is Randy (Kennedy)
from the original film, along with his new film freak buddy Mickey
(Timothy Olyphant).  Derek (Jerry O'Connell) is Sidney Prescott's
(Neve Campbell) new beau, and Hallie (Elise Neal) is Sidney's
roommate.  Accompanying Weathers is Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), the
wrongly accused killer in SCREAM.  Surprisingly, all these characters
are developed rather nicely, but you pretty much realize that many of
them will be gutted.  Smaller roles include Helen (Sarah Michelle
Gellar) as a designated driver and, in the STAB! film is-wouldn't you
know it?-Tori Spelling as Sidney!  That tricky Williamson... he did
that on purpose (Neve Campbell remarked that Spelling would most
likely play her in a film).</P>
<P>SCREAM 2 may not be as scary as the original film, but it sure
maintains a high level of suspense throughout.  My heart almost never
stopped pounding.  Most of the suspense comes from us knowing
something is going to jump out from behind a corner by the framing of
the shot.  When and who is what makes us hold our breath.  Will it be
the killer, or just a friend?  Sometimes nothing happens, but we still
remain in a tense state, and just as we begin to let our guard down,
something scary occurs on screen.  Unfortunately, it just isn't as
scary this time around, and it's hard to understand why.  The musical
chords are there, and the people jumping out from behind dark shadows
is present, but for some reason, it just doesn't work as well this
time.  Does that make it a lesser film?  Well, actually, yes.  Perhaps
a lot of the blame could be put on the bigger budget, as the original
relied on genuine scares instead of elaborate set pieces.  SCREAM 2
has an incredibly impressive set design, with some set pieces which
are sure to astound audiences.  In fact, the only bad thing about
SCREAM 2 is that lack of scariness. But what it does make up for is in
its technical aspects.</P>
<P>The technical aspects of SCREAM 2 are equal, if not superior, to its
predecessor.  The set design is spectacular, which adds a lot of
suspense by itself.  A highlight involves a Greek play starring
Sidney, but as she is rehearsing for it, she begins to see the killer
on the stage.  The surrealistic portrayal of this scene is very
effective, as the camera spins around, blurring all the Greek masks
together, but you can distinctly see the Ghostface amidst the crowd.
The music, written by Danny Elfman (for the Greek scenes only), is the
best in the film.  Another impressive scene involves a police car, the
killer, and Sidney and her roommate.  It leads up to one of the film's
most genuinely suspenseful moments.  However, after watching SCREAM 2,
I got to feeling that bigger is not always better, because SCREAM had
a pretty small budget (in Hollywood's terms) and the scares were
created by skillful film making instead of elaborate sets.  SCREAM 2
does contain a few "jump" moments that work, but they are all when the
killer jumps out.  When it is a friend, it seems as if Craven didn't
put as much energy into the shock value as he does with the actual
killer.  The Drew Barrymore scene this time around is a good example.
It involves Helen (Gellar) who is stuck in her sorority house alone
because she is the designated driver for the rest of the girls.  She
begins getting calls, and she goes through the same errors that
Barrymore did.  This scene mounts to some incredible tension, but it
ends very quickly, and the possible scares are lost.</P>
<P>The writing of SCREAM 2 is a big highlight.  Kevin Williamson is a
terrific writer, and after the second sequel, he will probably put his
talent towards writing some great comedies or great dramas.  His
satire is some of the best in film, making fun of many other films,
while giving sequels a good name.  The dialogue is witty, and very
realistic.  Most of the characters talk exactly the way your average
person would talk about movies.  Of course, he does include some
stereotypical "dumb blonds," but only for the laugh.  He doesn't put
them in there as actual characters, but as characters in a horror
film.  They know they are in a slasher film, and they act like people
who deserve to be slashed.  Surprisingly, many of the people who get
slashed are the ones we like the most.  Williamson also gives another
surprise ending, which I never guessed.  This film makes you guess,
but if you do get it right, it's only by chance.  As for the
direction, Wes Craven does a masterful job, and he is probably the
only director who takes this genre seriously.  He may spoof it and
slap it around, but he takes it seriously.  He is the most skillful
horror director available, with a long list of the best slasher films
to back him up (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE).
Craven doesn't do as good a job as he did with SCREAM, but it is still
a good job.</P>
<P>The cast is the best aspect of SCREAM 2, giving terrific performances
all around.  Neve Campbell again stars as Sidney, and she does a great
job.  She is probably the best actress in teen slasher history.  Her
kick-ass persona is a major improvement over the frightened, weak
Jamie Lee Curtis of the slasher genre.  Courtney Cox gives an equal
performance to Campbell, but her role is more developed here than in
SCREAM.  Cox provides many of the film's tense moments, including an
extended chase sequence through film school.  Jerry O'Connell gives a
very good performance as Sidney's boyfriend.  This is a major
improvement over his "Sliders" television show.  David Arquette gives
another good performance as Dewey.  Unfortunately, his character has
matured a little, and it's actually a little disappointing.  Jamie
Kennedy provides one of the most shocking moments in the film, and
also some of the funniest lines ("Showgirls," his response to what he
thinks is the scariest film he's ever seen).  Sarah Michelle Gellar
has a small role, but she gives one of the most believable
performances in the film.  Duane Martin is hilarious as the cameraman
who fears for his life when he learns about the fate of Weathers'
ex-cameraman.  Laurie Metcalf gives a very good over-the-top
performance in her small role.  Timothy Olyphant is extremely
effective in his limited role, but his discussions with Randy are
perfect and reasonable.  Liev Schreiber gives a nice performance as
Cotton Weary, and his obsession with being famous could easily be a
motive for killing the teens who accused him of murder.  And
surprisingly, Tori Spelling gives a rather good performance in her
semi-spoof of herself.</P>
<P>SCREAM 2 is rated R for graphic horror violence and gore, and
language.  Again, SCREAM 2 leaves out unnecessary nudity, which
Williamson comments on in his screenplay (Jada Pinkett complains about
Heather Graham stripping in STAB!).  SCREAM 2 marks one of the best
sequels ever created, and probably the best for the teen slasher
genre.  While it may not approach the scariness of the original, it
adds many other elements which make it a very entertaining sequel.
Overall, it isn't as impressive as SCREAM was, but it will surely rake
in the money at the box office.  In fact, it will most likely surpass
the original's grosses due to a high interest in the SCREAM franchise
spawned by the re-inventing SCREAM.  Watch for it to break records its
first weekend (but it will drop rapidly due to the release of the much
anticipated TITANIC opening next week), and remain strong.</P>
