<PRE>                                   THE NET
                       A film review by Matthew Beckwith
                        Copyright 1995 Matthew Beckwith</PRE>
<P>     THE NET is a realistic thriller that's refreshingly understated.
>From the first minutes of the film, when you meet the likeable
Angela Bennett, a beautiful introvert addicted to her computer, who
would rather stay home eating a pizza than go out on a date, through
the conspicuously non-cybernetic middle of the film, reminiscent of The
Pelican Brief, to the high-tech ending, in which the protagonist
programs an internet search in seconds to identify the mastermind
behind the terrorist attacks on presumably secure computer systems, THE
NET keeps you on the edge of your seat.</P>
<P>     Extra effort was taken during the making of this film, it is
obvious, to make it a quality work.  The protagonist's psychological
make-up (including a history of psychotherapy, an abandoning father,
and a mother with Alzheimer's disease) is carefully sketched out for
us, making her an intriguing character.  Subtle editing decisions were
made, such as a computer-generated image of flowers which become real
flowers, and an ant's-eye view of a carousel horse interposed in the
middle of a chase scene.</P>
<P>     The acting of all the characters in the film (including,
surprisingly enough, Dennis Miller's) is competent, studied and
professional.  Sondra Bullock does a superb job in her role.  Ken
Howard introduces the film in a cameo showing just the right amount of
authority and anguish for his tragic character.</P>
<P>     As a computer programmer and physician, I would have preferred the
film's makers to have taken a bit of extra care in avoiding technical
inaccuracies.  It is unlikely that simply hitting the escape key would
undo the receipt of an email which has already been sent, and viruses
(though quite powerful) generally do not give people back their lost
identities.  A nurse tells the protagonist that her friend has been
intubated, but in the next scene the patient is talking; this would
have been rather difficult if he had been on a ventilator (which the
word "intubated" implies).</P>
<P>     In a time of slam-bang thrillers with little character development
or subtlety, THE NET is a refreshing, edge-of-your-seat film with a
great deal of intrinsic quality.  I highly recommend it, both to those
who are computer-literate, and to neophytes in this ultra-networked
society of ours.</P>
