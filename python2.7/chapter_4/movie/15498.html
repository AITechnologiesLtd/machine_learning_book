Enemy of the State</PRE>
<P>_Enemy of the State_ has every reason to be a bad movie.  It was
produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, famous for the fiascos of _Armageddon_
and _Con Air_.  It was directed by Tony Scott, marred by his
stylish-but-hollow career (Beverly Hills Cop 2, Revenge, The Fan).  The
plot--innocent man caught in conspiracy--has been done countless times
before.  Even the dialog in the trailers is bad: "You got something they
want!"/"I don't know what you're talking about!"</P>
<PRE>Then why did I enjoy the film so much?</PRE>
<P>EOTS is the techno-geek's dream film - a film that successfully
integrates modern technology into its labyrithrine plot.</P>
<P>This must be hard to do: it takes many years for a film of this caliber
to be conceived, written, then to be pitched, produced, directed, and
edited, all before said technology becomes obsolete.  _The Net_ is a
prime example of how a film rooted in technology would have been much
better had it only been released two years earlier.</P>
<P>I haven't been thrilled by Hollywood's treatment of advancing technology
since _Wargames_ and _Blue Thunder_ hit in '83.  And that may have been
because I was totally unaware of it.  The John Badham one-two punch were
seminal in my love both for modern technology and cinema.</P>
<P>_Enemy of the State_ integrates advanced surveillance techniques into
the standard Hitchcockian formula.  Satellites, normally used for
pointing outward, are pointing _downward_, to the point that chase
scenes are under surveillance, not unlike Christof's in _The Truman
Show_.  Computers are used in conjunction with security systems to
simulate, single out, and magnify the taped events.</P>
<P>Enemy of the State goes one better: it incorporates the talents of the
best "geeks" in Hollywood to sit behind the technology.  They have a
contagious enthusiasm that radiates a
yahoo-we're-gonna-destroy-an-innocent-man's-life mentality. They have
fun, and they've no idea how deadly their participation becomes.  Kudos,
especially, to character nerds Jack Black and Jamie Kennedy.  It's not
that you root for them, but you enjoy their presence.</P>
<P>The final trick up Bruckheimer's sleeve is Gene Hackman.  Not that
Hackman's in it, but that he is playing the same role that he did in
Francis Coppola's _The Conversation_ in 1974.  Brilliant.  In both
films, Hackman plays Harry Caul, a timid but expert surveillance expert.
In the first film he becomes increasingly weary over his profession,
especially as it turns on him.  In this film, he has become a recluse,
working for himself, paranoid and rightly so.</P>
<P>He comes to the aid of Robert Dean (Will Smith), a high-profile attorney
who unknowingly becomes a recipient of a disk containing evidence of a
high-profile murder.  Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight), not taking any
chances, decides to destroy Smith's credibility, if he were to go public
with the evidence.  The rest of the film Dean is fighting to clean his
record, rid himself of bugs, and stay alive.</P>
<P>The film has several nifty touches, like a detailed (but improbable)
virtual surveillance scene in a lingerie shop.  It has a running gag
with a blender.  It has one of the best used cameos of Gabriel Byrne.
And it marks the return of Lisa Bonet--where has she been?</P>
<P>Alas, the film does fall apart in the end, with a final shootout that is
as cheap as it is predictable.  But for the majority of its playing
time, _State_ gives a good, thrilling ride.  Best to watch this on the
big screen with great sound.</P>
