Anastasia (G) ***</PRE>
<P>Months before its release, Fox's epic animated musical Anastasia had been
touted as the first legitimate challenge to Disney's animation empire,
which looked more vulnerable than ever after the disappointing box office
(and, as it turns out, merchandising) performance of the fun-but-phoned-in
Hercules.  Now that the film has arrived in theatres, does the Mouse indeed
have reason to worry?  During its exquisite first twenty or so minutes, I
found myself agreeing with the buzz, but the film soon collapses under the
weight of convention, becoming a  merely pleasant entertainment.</P>
<P>A harrowing prologue set in 1916 swiftly gives us the necessary backstory:
during a revolution the entire Russian royal family is killed save for the
czar's youngest daughter, Anastasia (spoken by Kirsten Dunst, sung by Lacey
Chabert), who is lost after escaping from the palace; and her grandmother,
Dowager Empress Marie (Angela Lansbury), who left Russia for Paris just
before the unrest.  Then the film flashes forward in time, jumping into its
buoyant opening number, "A Rumor in St. Petersburg," which introduces the
main action: the presumed-dead princess is rumored to be alive, and with
their eye on a possible financial reward from the Empress, con men Dimitri
(spoken by John Cusack, sung by Jonathan Dokuchitz) and Vladimir (Kelsey
Grammer) seek out a young woman who can be a believable Anastasia stand-in.
 While a big opening production number is part of the Disney formula,
directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman approach it in a fresh way.  In Disney
films, the characters do little more than sing and slightly sway to the
music; here, the style is more live-action Broadway and MGM, with
background characters forming a full-on dance chorus, spontaneously
breaking into heavily choreographed moves.</P>
<P>Dimitri and Vlad ultimately find their perfect impostor in orphan Anya
(spoken by Meg Ryan, sung by Liz Callaway), and that's no accident--she
truly _is_ Anastasia, but with barely any recollection of her royal past.
Freshly released from an unpleasant orphanage, Anya articulates her dream
of having a family in the stirring "Journey to the Past."  This number is
equivalent to the Disney "I Want" song in function, but once again the
stage-influenced execution sets it apart, with Anya literally prancing her
way through the snow-covered forest and even capping her song by
dramatically raising her arms into the air (you almost expect the movie to
pause for audience applause).</P>
<P>Right before Anya meets up with the scheming duo comes a truly stunning,
magical moment--as it turns out, the film's way-too-premature peak.  She
steps foot in the ballroom of the abandoned palace, crooning the hauntingly
beautiful "Once Upon a December," a lullaby her grandmother used to sing
with her when she was young.  After a single verse, the ghosts of the past
waltz in through the windows, enveloping her, creating a lavish ball out of
thin air.</P>
<P>By this song's end, the glitter and glamour disappears, and so does much
of the luster of the film.  The songs by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens
(the latter of whom holds a special place in my and many others' hearts for
her enduring work on ABC's Schoolhouse Rock!) become increasingly
forgettable, and even worse, the story loses some steam.  The strict
adherence to the established Disney formula becomes a hindrance.  There is
really no dramatic need to include an out-and-out villain in the piece,
but, true to convention, there is one: evil monk Rasputin (spoken by
Christopher Lloyd, sung by Jim Cummings), whose supernatural curse on the
royal family caused its near-destruction.  While the dying Rasputin's plot
does lead to some standout sequences (in particular a suspenseful and
spectacular sea storm scene), and the running gag of his body parts
constantly fall off is amusing, I never felt as if he and his sidekick,
wisecracking albino bat Bartok (Hank Azaria), played a necessary role in
this story; they seemed to be shoehorned in for formula's sake.  More
interesting and involving than the good-versus-evil plot is the romantic
sparring between Anya and Dimitri; this may sound odd, but Ryan and Cusack
generate a lot of chemistry with their voices.  But the resolution to their
romance is far from satisfying.  Instead of being moved by the ending, I
was merely pleased.</P>
<P>One thing, however, does remain consistently impressive throughout
Anastasia, and that is the visuals.  The animation is a little ragged and
not nearly as fluid as Disney work, but the artwork is outstanding.  From
its beautiful handdrawn images to the three-dimensional computer-generated
work, all shot in  the 2.35:1 CinemaScope aspect ratio (the first animated
feature to be shot so since 1959's Sleeping Beauty), Anastasia truly looks
and feels like an epic even when the goings-on are less so.</P>
<P>In the end, the heavily hyped Anastasia does not announce Fox's animation
division as a challenger to Disney's throne.  What it does announce,
however, is Fox as a _potential_ challenger.  Anastasia may not be great,
but it is good, and if the film is a jumping-off point for the fledgling
animation house, the Mouse should be prepared for a war.</P>
