<PRE>TWIN FALLS IDAHO
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        At a cursory glance, "Twin Falls Idaho" looks like it might have
originated from the fractured and highly-volatile imagination of David
Lynch, director of such surreal indulgences as "Wild at Heart," "Lost
Highway," and the television series that started it all, "Twin Peaks."  But
this odd little film adds an element completely alien to Lynch's cinematic
arsenal of weirdness and weirdos: it adds empathy.</P>
<P>        It's an element that pushes "Twin Falls Idaho" beyond the
experience of just another freakshow.</P>
<P>        The feature--and starring--debut of striking-looking identical
twins Mark and Michael Polish, "Twin Falls Idaho" does not exploit its
subject matter.  Far from it: it bathes its conjoined siblings in a loving
and sympathetic light, and the result is a sad, fascinating, and profoundly
moving portrait of two individuals who have learned, not by choice, to live
together.</P>
<P>        There's not much of a story; it's your typical tale of "girl falls for
(Siamese) boy."  Instead, the film draws its power from the superlative
performances of its male leads, whose contributions in front of the camera
are equaled only by their skills as writers and, in Michael's case,
director behind it.  With genuine sensitivity, the film ably demonstrates
the easily imagined logistical difficulties of, say, sharing three legs, a
breast bone, and other vital organs.  There's only one "effects" shot in
the entire 110-minute film; the physicality of Blake and Francis'
relationship is expressed through the brothers' unique fraternal bond of
love and communication, rather than of skin and bone.</P>
<P>        Throughout the film the very separate Polish brothers stand extremely
close together, whispering softly in a beautiful didactic contrivance.
While one sleeps, the other remains awake.  When one is sick, the other
remains strong, steadfast.  When one is propositioned by a hooker (played
by Michele Hicks, a model-turned-actress whose talents, no doubt, were
previously better employed), the other reaps the benefits.</P>
<P>        Gorgeously photographed by M. David Mullen (and, since most of the
drama
takes place in a grungy hotel, amazingly so), the deliberately and, I
daresay, ambiguously-titled "Twin Falls Idaho" recalls Peter Greenaway's
masterly "The Falls."  Among its 99 violent, unknown biographies,
Greenaway's feature debut included identical twins played by the brothers
Quay.  Shortly after seeing "Twin Falls Idaho" I learned of conjoined twins
from Poland (Polish, don't you see) who were here in Philadelphia
undergoing the first of many surgeries in an attempt to separate them.  Of
course my mind did a double take.</P>
<P>        "Twin Falls Idaho" is indeed an oddity but, unlike a circus
sideshow, it's one that you should have no moral compunction in paying to
see.</P>
