DIGIMON: THE MOVIE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>"There are actually two worlds -- our world and the digital world," 
explains the narrator of DIGIMON: THE MOVIE.  "But don't plan a vacation 
there since I don't even know where it is."  Finding out where it is 
will be the least of your problems since the movie's plot is about as 
clear as one of those obscure "illegal instruction" error message that 
your computer spits at you when it's angry.  In a movie designed solely 
for its fans who possess the magic, mental decoder ring, they alone will 
be able to decipher it.  And with the attraction of free trading cards 
-- while supplies last -- they will probably be going in droves as they 
did to the POKEMON movies, which featured the same come-on gimmick.</P>
<P>Speaking of the POKEMON movies, my wife said that she thought that she 
would never say it, but she found both of the POKEMON movies were 
superior to the DIGIMON one.  My son, however, disagrees, but he'll get 
his chance to chime in at usual spot at the end of the review.</P>
<P>Digimon are "digital monster" pets kept by human, mainly Japanese, kids.  
Most kids have only one, but there's this one kid in Colorado who is the 
lucky owner of two digimon.  The pets can do everything from pooping on 
the rug to launching nuclear weapons.  When they evolve, called 
digivolving, they cause such an electrical surge that it disrupts all of 
the electrical appliances in the city.</P>
<P>The film's animation is second rate with dull colors and fuzzy drawing.  
Neither this, nor the lackluster music, can compensate for the story's 
confusion.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I have to admit that I 
cheated!  A couple of times I had to lean over and ask my son, a Digimon 
aficionado, who was who, since most of the characters are so similarly 
drawn.</P>
<P>The best parts of the movie are a few funny lines, although some are 
unintentionally so, such as, "Diabormon is eating the Internet!"  When 
disaster strikes, Tai (Joshua Seth) tells Izzy (Mona Marshall), "Maybe 
we should call someone important like the president or Bill Gates."  The 
best comes when Izzy asks Tai, in disgust at his lack of knowledge, "Do 
you know what a semiconductor is?"  "Someone who works part-time at the 
railroad?" Tai guesses.</P>
<P>Izzy's idea of a good time, we are told, "is trying to upgrade his 
computer."  Unless you are already a knowledgeable Digimon fan, pass on 
the movie and have more fun by upgrading your computer.  Trust me, 
upgrading, probably not your idea of a good time, will be much more 
enjoyable.</P>
<P>DIGIMON: THE MOVIE runs 1:29, but it'll feel much longer.  It is rated 
PG for action violence and would be acceptable for all ages.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, gave the movie ****.  He said he liked 
everything about it except for the digivolving part, which went too 
fast.</P>
