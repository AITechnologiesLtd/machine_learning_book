<PRE>                                  POCAHONTAS
                       A film review by William Loguidice
                        Copyright 1995 William Loguidice</PRE>
<P>     Starting with THE LITTLE MERMAID and most recently THE LION KING,
the Walt Disney company once again proved that they could not only
consistently make modern day animated classics, but were particularly
in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids--
wanted to see.  Therefore, it's with some surprise that as a big fan of
the above mentioned movies I was so disappointed with POCAHONTAS.</P>
<P>     Despite some innovation and risk taking, the story is surprisingly
straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes, as are its
characters.  A group of Englishmen lead by the evil Governor Ratcliffe
come to the New World in search of gold with no regard for the
"savages" that live there.  The natives look upon the English with just
as much fear and distrust.  Only the love between the beautifully
structured Pocahontas and the dashing Captain John Smith can prevent a
terrible clash.  The ending, as it turns out, is not entirely a happy
one and is one of the film's finer moments.</P>
<P>     The characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real
depth.  Governor Ratcliffe, for instance, is a snobbish, single-minded
bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses.  Captain
John Smith is a blond hunk who, while "slightly" misguided, is good at
heart.  Pocahontas herself is the typical Disney heroine who is
practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and
finds the man of her dreams just in time.  She even comes complete with
insignificant best friend.</P>
<P>     Again, against tradition, talking animals aren't used, but a
lusty, wizened, talking tree is.  This is an odd compromise, but it's
one of the few elements that really work.  The animals are a delight,
and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor
and fun to a rather bland presentation.  Maybe it would have been a
better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes.  The talking
tree, who seems to have a thing for John Smith, is the only other
character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed
of the bunch.</P>
<P>     The music, a welcome delight in the later Disney films, is mostly
a let down here, with the exception of the catchy and motivational,
"Colors of the Wind."  Mel Gibson, as the voice of John Smith, has a
solid singing voice and should have been used more.  The opposite holds
true for the Governor Ratcliffe led songs; the singing is even more
grating than his simplistic character.</P>
<P>     I was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than
expected running time.  Even the children in the audience seemed
restless.  While there's no stopping a kid from seeing something that
they want--or Disney wants them to--most I believe will be
disappointed.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the biggest problem is that Disney has strayed from their
familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history.  It's all right to
change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie's entertainment value, but
doing so to historical facts doesn't work nearly as well as creating
nagging questions in the viewer's minds and plot holes that are never
filled.  Even the artwork, another Disney strong point, varies greatly
in quality, making any story problems even more obvious.</P>
<P>     As mentioned above, there were many questions that stayed with me
while viewing the film.  For instance, if John Smith was truly such a
world traveler and had so much experience with "savages," why did he so
quickly change his previous "kill as many Indians as I can" attitude.
If he was such a nice guy after all, he should have changed his ways
long before this.  Or how about Pocahontas' amazing English speaking
ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white
men?  I can understand making the Native Americans speak English for
the benefit of the audience, but simply saying that they had met a
missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot; history was
modified in the film anyway.  As it is, I wonder if it doesn't give
kids the wrong impression.</P>
<P>     In short, the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too
much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set.  While
Disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest
traditions, they end up failing on too many levels.</P>
