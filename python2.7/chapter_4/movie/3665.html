<PRE>                                 BRAVEHEART
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Mel Gibson deserves a lot more credit than I've been giving him.  A
few years ago, no one could have conceived that the action star could pull
off the lead role in a dazzling, epic, historical
adventure-thriller-romance, let alone direct it.  But he does, making
BRAVEHEART a vastly entertaining and powerful film.</P>
<P>     Gibson plays Scottish hero William Wallace, a Scotsman with simple
roots who finds himself thrust into a role as leader of the Scottish revolt
against England in the late 13th century.  After the despicable King Edward
the Longshanks (Edward I) decrees that English nobles will have the right
to sexual relations with all newly-wed Scottish women, the revolution is
set in motion.  Wallace takes up the cause, only to find himself facing
incredible odds against a superior English army and fighting Scottish
nobles who want to negotiate peace instead of fight.  In fact, it's the
nobles who turn out to be the bigger obstacle.</P>
<P>     The film is exquisite in its melding of romance, political intrigue,
and some of the most effective (and gory) battle scenes I've ever watched.
At the forefront is the surprisingly capable portrayal of Wallace by
Gibson, who comes off as such an awesome Everyman hero that he makes Rob
Roy look like a wuss.  Also, the film is so effective at making the English
seem so overwhelmingly evil--*really* evil--that the audience is nearly
ready to rush the screen.  Patrick McGoohan, who plays the embodiment of
this evil in King Edward, deserves an early nod as Best Supporting Actor
for his staggering portrayal.</P>
<P>     The only real problem with the film is that it is *way* too long.
Clocking in at three hours, Gibson spends far too much time on certain
sequences, like the half-hour of Wallace as a child.  While entertaining,
they add little to the picture as a whole, and the long panning shots of
the Scottish highlands, while beautiful, get old after awhile.</P>
<P>     Thematically, BRAVEHEART explores the definitions of honor and
nobility, reinforcing what we've always known:  that true nobility is not
the result of your birthright, but that it arises from the way you live
your life.  It's an excellent reminder that stays with you long after the
film is over, and that is all too rare in Hollywood these days.</P>
