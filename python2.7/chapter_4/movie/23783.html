<P>Ok, so there are movies that come out that are just soooo guiltily
entertaining, that you really cant suffice it and say that movie was good. Ok
so maybe "Romeo Must Die" isn't one of those movies, but it isn't perfect by
any means. Hong Kong films are always technically well-made, bloody, violent,
lightning-paced fist fight, no plot movies. The one exception is "Romeo Must
Die" a very entertaining, fast-paced thrill ride, that will have you cheering
by the end, and a smile permanently on your face throughout the two hours.</P>
<P>Jet Li plays a man who is an ex-cop just escaped from prison to find his
brother's killer in New York. He meets up with singing sensation Aayliah who
gives a better than you'd think performance. Jet Li plays a Romeo type who is
avenging his brother's killer, while Aayliah plays a Juliet type trying to cope
with the fact that her father is a mob boss, and may be responsible for the
killing of 'Romeo's' brother. The two team up and try to find out the truth,
leading to a huge finale and some shocking secrets. </P>
<P>What seems like a thin plot type movie, really is. There is a nice solid plot
to this movie, though it seems like it has been done so many times before, it
isn't even funny. The Romeo And Juliet modern day tale, is just that. Man loves
Woman, Woman loves Man, they can't be together because of their families
fighting, and their families do not want them to be together. Even watching
this film, you know your treading familiar water, the fight scenes, action, and
acting in the film especially by Aayliah makes you overlook that stuff, and
just enjoy yourself.</P>
<P>Surprisingly enough, Aayilah gives the best performance in the movie, backed up
great performances from Jet Li, Delroy Lindo and Isaiah Washington, "Romeo Must
Die" is a brainless action film, with some brains and sometimes no action. The
film goes from being an action film to a love story, to an action film to a
love story, yet never loses it's punch to make us the viewer continue to like
this movie. We are brought to these characters lives, their loves, they
adventures and their tragedies. Even with all these flaws, "Romeo Must Die"
continues its way to be a fast-paced thrill ride, that grabs hold of the viewer
and does not let go until the end credits role.</P>
<P>The cinematography and directing were both flawless, but the script could have
used some polishing. Of course expect the usual subtitles, but no dubbing
(yay). This is an American made film, that will appeal to all races: White,
Black, Oriental, there is something in this movie for everyone, and everyone
will find something that will appeal to them. Even if the person didn't like
the movie, I found those people did like something in the movie that was
memorable. The fight scenes in the movie were more than incredible, and some of
these stunts are the most amazing martial arts I have ever seen on a film
strip. Without the fight scenes and the overall entertainment of the film,
there really isn't much to Romeo Must Die. But when you put those aside, you
get one fun and wild ride!</P>
