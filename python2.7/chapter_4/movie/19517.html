<P>   Based on its trailers, "The Haunting" comes across as an
antidote to "The Blair Witch Project," but here's a case in
which the corrective is worse than the venom.  Whereas the
highly overrrated "Blair" flaunts its forbearance of special
effects, tightly-written dialogue, and big-name performers,
"The Haunting" resembles a glorified ride through a Coney
Island spook ride as Donald Trump would have constructed it.
If "The Blair Witch Project" suffers from a kind of reverse
pretension--claiming a blessing from its avoidance of fancy
pyrotechnics and seeking the most naturalistic adventure
possible in a horror movie--"The Haunting" goes to the
opposite extreme.  Director Jan de Bont, known for the razzle
he put into the exciting movie "Speed" and the subsequent
dud "Twister," proves himself unable to break away from
depending on dazzle to substitute for substance.  Based on
Shirley Jackson's novel "The Haunting of Hill House," which
mercifully leaves the terror to the reader's imagination, the
Dreamworks release relies almost completely on kitschy
imagery, vapid dialogue, and an all-too-literal replica of
purgatory to stimulate the fancy of moviegoers that still retain
an smidgen of imagination in an age of visual overload.</P>
<P>   The only scary part of the movie occurs at the very
beginning as Eleanor (Lili Taylor) is told by her sister that she
is to be dispossesed of her home per her deceased mother's
will.  Having no family, no friends, and now no place to live,
the mousy Nell becomes desperate, grasping eagerly at a
newspaper ad calling for volunteers for research that could
help insomniacs like her.  Unknown to her, Dr. David Marrow
(Liam Neeson), who is conducting the inquiry, is more
interested in exploring the nature of fear and has set up his
experiment in a spacious gothic mansion that had existed
somewhere in New England since 1837.  Conveniently, the
estate is unoccupied, looked after by a caretaker (Bruce
Dern) and his wife (Marian Seldes), neither of whom ventures
near the place after dark.  In fact the caretaker locks the gate
securely when he leaves each evening.</P>
<P>   At the house, Nell meets Dr. Jeffrey Marrow and two other
subjects for the experiment, Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and
Luke (Owen Wilson)--both cockier and more confident than
she.  As things begin to creak and groan and move and
moan in the night, Nell starts to lose it and is comforted by
her fellow subjects and the doctor.  Not long after that,
though, all who occupy the house are convinced that it is
haunted.  After all, you don't often see giant arms reaching
out from a multiplicity of gargoyles and assorted diabolic
creatures every day, all seemingly intent on drowning,
burning, strangling or otherwise acting in an unfriendly
manner toward the residents.  </P>
<P>   As the performers strut and cower about the house, the
corridors resound with ominous noises.  Doors close
suddenly and loudly, ghostly children crawl inside the sheets
and float about the rooms, and ultimately an enormous
painting of the home's diabolic owner comes to life like a
Dickensian ghost of Christmas-Yet-To-Come, challenging little
Nell in a conclusive duel to the death.</P>
<P>   Lily Taylor comes off surprisingly well.  Once known as the
queen of the indies for her role in small, creative movies like
"I Shot Andy Warhol," she takes on a role in a big budget
movie and does what she can with as the only character with
any development.  By contrast the sensuous Catherine Zeta-
Jones and the current cover-man of TimeOutNY magazine,
Owen Wilson as the third subject of the experiment, Luke,
have little to do but become wide-eyed as the mansion takes
on a life of its own.  Ms. Zeta-Jones hints at the bisexuality of
her character, but nothing comes of this.</P>
<P>   Despite the unintentionally comic moves made by the
torsoes and heads of the figures that inhabit the walls and
floors of the incredible Hill House, the movie will perhaps be
nominated for an academy award for its production design,
which Eugenia Zenetti ("What Dreams May Come") has
created with an inspiration from the Harlaxton and Belvoir
Castle in Leicestershire, England.  The outside is not a set
but the Harlaxton Manor in England's Nottinghamshire, a
building now used as a foreign campus of Indiana's University
of Evansville.  </P>
<P>   Though I have not read Ms. Jackson's story, I am a fan of
her scariest, most allegorical tale, "The Lottery," about a
group of rural townspeople who hold a drawing each year to
determine which resident gets stoned to death.  The little
movie that came out of that novella remained true to the
book's creative dialogue, hence retaining the fright and
resonance of the printed page.  "The Haunting," by contrast,
stands as yet another fragment of evidence that more is often
less.</P>
