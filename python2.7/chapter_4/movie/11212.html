                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
 8 :-( :-( :-( :-( :-( :-( :-( :-(  for reaching the point of no return</PRE>
<P>Cast: Sean Penn, Jennifer Lopez, Nick Nolte, Powers Boothe, Claire
Danes, Joaquin Phoenix, Billy Bob Thornton, Jon Voight Director: Oliver
Stone</P>
<P>There comes a unique moment in any bad movie, which redefines it as an
outright awful movie. Unfortunately, we arrive at this point much too
late or I would have left the theatre sooner. The line between good and
poor taste is crossed, when it is revealed that a half-breed Indian girl
(Jennifer Lopez), repeatedly raped by her father (Nick Nolte), decides
to marry the beast even when he murdered her mother. In this most
deranged arrangement, f'king the Sheriff (Powers Boothe) and a stray
stranger (Sean Penn) somehow comes into play. With the help of the
stranger, a succession of bullets and stabbings, murder and money is
obtained. What follows is a further succession of pushing, strangling
and death.</P>
<P>Some people will call this art, but I see it as pure lunacy.</P>
<P>What makes this movie particularly disappointing is the fact the
director is Oliver Stone. After his fixation with the sixties and the
NAM war and now this, one may wrongly accuse him of suffering from a bad
case of post-traumatic stress disorder. Get over it Oliver, we live in
the nineties. No more, no more of this pent up ill will which seem to
stain all your movies.</P>
<P>The plot takes place in the dead-beat town of Superior, Arizona. At
first the quirky characters in the town and the unusual camera angles is
reminiscent of NORTHERN EXPOSURE or RAISING ARIZONA. However, when the
bizarre plot sets in, one begins to experience the TWIN PEAKS phenomena,
before a plummeting straight to Hell.</P>
<P>Sean Penn is a wonderfully gifted actor and is unfortunately wasted as
the non-too-bright stranger who can't seem to get out of town. Nick
Nolte is surprisingly thin and haggard looking, but is otherwise well
suited to the role of a murderous, incestuous bigot. Jennifer Lopez
exudes all the charms of a sexually abused vixen, who is supposedly
meant to be haunted by her abusers, but one would never guess it from
all the hard on sex she's getting from her father, the sheriff and the
stranger - she actually looks like she's enjoying herself?</P>
<P>My final comments are angry. Don't make a U TURN, don't even look back,
keep on driving and miss this piece of trash cleverly disguised as
cinema.</P>
