<P>Ugh. That about sums this movie up. Just, ugh.</P>
<P>The original Godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic, and when
reviewing the previous films, each film had a certain degree of
intelligence. And that was the reason they found such an enviable cult
following; in spite of bad special effects, horrible dubbing, and a man
in a lizard suit, they maintained a certain degree of... how to put
this?... dignity? Not quite the word I'm looking for. You understand,
right? And in 50 years, Godzilla has maintained that degree of
'whatever'.</P>
<P>Leave it to America to screw the whole thing up.</P>
<P>>From the 'geniuses' that brought us "Independece Day", arguably the
WORST sci-fi movie of all time, to ruin whatever reputation Godzilla
had. While they do bring us eye-popping special effects that will amaze
you, they lost what was at the center of all the original Godzilla
movies -- a storyline. Summing up the movie is simple. Heck, I can do it
in one sentence: Giant lizard attacks a giant city and a bunch of
nobodies stop it. Simple as that.</P>
<P>Matthew Broderick stumbles over his lines, and it's hard to picture Hank
Azaria in any role besides his classic dog-walking character on the
television show "Mad About You". The dialogue seems to be improvized,
almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all. I can see the scene on
the set right now. "All right! We spent all of this money making big
special effects, and we've gotta get this movie out by summer or it's
going to bomb in our faces. So, you actors just say what ever comes to
the top of your head, all right? Make up something, m'kay? Good. ROLL
FILM!!"</P>
<P>The special effects are enough to keep you interested through one
viewing, and some of the cinemtography is well-done (the scene with the
black umbrellas comes to mind). Still, an hour into it, you will become
antsy, wondering how long they can drag it out. And drag it out they
do!!</P>
<P>I have to laugh. The slogan for the film is, "Size does matter". I think
they cut this too short. It SHOULD read, "Size does matter. Acting does
not."</P>
