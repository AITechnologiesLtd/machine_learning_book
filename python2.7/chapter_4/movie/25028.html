<P>Of all of David Lynch's films, I find myself ranking "Blue Velvet" on a lower 
meter. It's a good, blazingly original film that is also wholly uneven, 
obscene and tasteless to the core. The latter terms are not meant as a 
critique - Lynch at his best is always obscene and tasteless. But I also find 
"Blue Velvet" to be underwhelming, as say compared to "Eraserhead" (his 
greatest film) or "Lost Highway." It's  just that their themes are more 
complex and disturbing than this perverse take on suburbia.</P>
<P>"Blue Velvet" was released back in 1986 and was highly controversional for 
its time, mainly due to graphic scenes of torture and sex. There was also 
much talk about the sequence where Isabella Rosselini (Ingrid Bergman's 
daughter) is naked and publicly embarrassed, while teeth marks and cigarette 
burns cover her entire body. There is no question that Lynch has always had 
trouble protraying women in a positive light, but the sequence is pure 
misogyny serving no purpose in the entire film. Rosselini also endures several
 beatings by Dennis Hopper as a helium-sniffing psycho. There are also 
numerous close-up shots of ants and cockroaches littering the screen as if 
they are aware of something beyond our knowledge.</P>
<P>The story revolves around a murder mystery that is never quite explained or 
resolved. Kyle MacLachlan plays a college student visiting his 
picture-postcard hometown, Pemberton, when one day, he discovers a severed 
human ear on someone's lawn. He contacts the police and then decides to 
investigate on his own. This all leads to the apartment of a distraught 
singer (played by Rosselini), who is always singing "Blue Velvet" at a 
nightclub. Dennis Hopper plays the deranged killer who tortures her, and the 
scenes between the two of them are as startling and effective as any other 
scene in the film.</P>
<P>As Kyle veers further into this S & M world with the help of a policeman's 
daughter (Laura Dern) things get much weirder especially when Dean Stockwell 
shows up as a Kabuki transvestite. Both Stockwell and Hopper must hold the 
record for spouting more obscenities on film than Eddie Murphy. </P>
<P>"Blue Velvet" is a fascinating, intriguing film but it is not completely 
successful. The elements of the mystery are so warped that I gave up after a 
while trying to follow it. It is true that some of Lynch's later work was 
more confounding and that it did not bother me much, but this mystery is 
actually more conventional and, dare I say, realistic so I did expect to be 
able to follow it. The performances are mostly shouting matches, especially 
between Hopper and Rosselini. Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern merely react 
than act, except for one exquisitely subtle scene at a cafe. Plus, the 
uplifting ending negates the darkness that preceded it, though I did like the 
shot of the bird with a wasp in its mouth. </P>
<P>For whatever strange reason I cannot comprehend, I still liked "Blue Velvet" 
because nobody has ever produced or directed anything like it prior to its 
release. There isn't anything you can easily compare it to. It is definitely 
Lynch's wildest endeavor and, somehow, strangely compelling. </P>
