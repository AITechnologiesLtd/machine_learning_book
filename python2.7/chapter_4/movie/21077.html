<P>ILLUMINATION (ILUMINACJA)(director/writer: Krzysztof Zanussi;
cinematographer: Edward Klosinski; cast: Stanislaw Latallo (Franciszek),
Monika Denisiewicz-Olbrychska (Agnieszka), Malgorzata Pritulak
(Malgorzata), Edward Zebrowski, Jan Skotnicki, 1973-Poland)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Quick-stop editing, leaving the scene before it is fully developed, both
inhibit and enhance the quality of this meditative film, based on a
Polish student in his twenties (Stanislaw Latallo), who questions life
in the '60s, while studying physics as a college student. He achieves
his doctorate several years later and is also diagnosed with a fatal
heart condition and is by that time not overly depressed by the
prospects of death, as he turns more philosophical about life.</P>
<P>He goes through his first romance with an older woman
(Denisiewicz-Olbrychska) and then is rejected, marries someone else
(Malgorzata Pritulak), has a son, watches as a close friend dies, feels
restless, becomes financially insecure, is searching for something
meaningful in his life, and watches as his marriage turns sour. He then
seeks religion but comes back to his wife and a career in science,
pretty much sums up the plot of this very difficult but easily
recognizable quest by many students all over the world in the '60s. The
student grows up when he realizes it is almost impossible to ask for
absolute answers, as he says, even the great Eisenstein had to abandon
that aim.</P>
<P>When he accepts full responsibility for his life and tries to become
economically secure, his life changes, it, strangely enough, becomes
limited, as his imagination can no longer run free.</P>
<P>The concept of illumination, whence the title of the film comes from,
refers to St. Augustine's theory of enlightenment. It is what fills the
mind with light; it is a spiritual happening that is the most powerful
thing in the world.</P>
<P>The hero is likable, somewhat courageous and scholarly, a person of
integrity and loyalty, and is the only hope for Poland's future. This is
a glum film, but intellectually sound, offering many pleasurable
introspective moments, but lacking in real illumination, which prevents
it from being a great film. The director, a student of science himself,
seems to be under the impression that the person of science is the most
interesting person in the world because he holds the key to knowledge.
That is certainly an arguable statement, as even  the protagonist in the
story eventually realizes not everything can be settled by rational
arguments.</P>
