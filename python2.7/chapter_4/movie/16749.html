<P>     In the small television-sized doses which are his forte, Mike Judge
is one of our savviest social satirists.  Freed of the "Beavis and
Butt-head"-inspired hand-wringing by many conservative critics, Judge has
been able to show in "King of the Hill" what his supporters have known all
along:  that Judge observes behavioral quirks as well as anyone, whether
his subjects are media-fried teenagers or middle-aged suburbanites.  In
OFFICE SPACE, his first live-action feature, Judge turns his attention to
corporate culture, a world of cubicles, coffee and numbing sameness ripe
for skewering.</P>
<P>     It's not a new target for Judge.  In fact, the animated shorts he
created about a put-upon office worker named Milton (played in the film by
"NewsRadio's" Stephen Root) even pre-date "Beavis & Butt-head."  Here he
expands the concept to focus on a computer programmer named Peter Gibbons
(Ron Livingston) at a software company called Initech.  Peter loathes
everything about his job -- the grinding commute, the chirping customer
service operator in the next cubicle, the mountains of pointless reports,
the passive-aggressive pestering by his boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole).
That all changes after a visit to a hypnotherapist leaves Peter with a new
perspective, and a blissful disregard for preserving his position.  While
"consultants" preparing for layoffs have most Initech employees scrambling
to justify their existence, Peter's id-run-wild "straight-shooting" has
him in line for a promotion.</P>
<P>     The first 45 minutes of OFFICE SPACE exploit the concept to its
fullest, resulting in some wonderfully surreal, wonderfully funny moments.
The opening traffic jam sequence alone is a sly riot, including a futile
exercise in "fastest lane" selection and a geeky white programmer who
blasts gansta rap on his car stereo but locks his door when an actual
black person walks near him.  Gary Cole, who so brilliantly nailed the
Mike Brady cadence in the BRADY BUNCH films, is equally slick with the
self-help tones of an inept middle-manager ("If you could just remember to
do that from now on, that would be great").  For a while, it looks like
Judge is going to head into inspired territory, lining up the newly
revitalized Peter for a supervisory position which could turn Initech
upside-down.</P>
<P>     Then, in a depressing turn of events, Judge appears to run out of
ideas for the premise he spent the first half of the film setting up.
Instead of continuing his cannon shots at bureaucratic tyranny, he 
launches into a lame caper in which Peter and his about-to-be-downsized
co-workers Samir (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman) -- no
relation to the singer -- try to rip off Initech by introducting a
computer virus into the accounting program.  As even the characters in the
film note, the premise is a rip-off from SUPERMAN III, and Judge doesn't
do anything interesting with it to justify recycling it.  OFFICE SPACE
grows tiresome in its last half hour, flipping back and forth between the
conspirators' anxiety over getting caught and a limp romance between Peter
and a sweet waitress (Jennifer Aniston).  After a decent televison
episode's worth of keen-edged satire, Judge lets his script dribble into
bland conventionality.</P>
<P>    It wouldn't be fair to suggest that Judge is only comfortable with
characters as cartoons -- Hank Hill is more endearingly human than most
sit-com creations put together -- but that seems to be the case in OFFICE
SPACE.  The robotic Lumbergh and the muttering Milton create the strongest
impression in the film; not coincidentally, they're the most extremely
absurdist creations.  When Judge tries to turn OFFICE SPACE into Peter's
quest for professional meaning and personal fulfillment, it just doesn't
work. He's much more effective pointing out the surreal yet all-too-real
details of industrial park anthropology, but there's not quite enough
material here to make it a thoroughgoing delight.  Mike Judge has taken
his gift for creating hilarous short films and overstayed his welcome.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 cubicle dwellers:  5.</PRE>
