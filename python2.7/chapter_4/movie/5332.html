<PRE>                         MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE
                       A film review by Ife Hsu
                        Copyright 1996 Ife Hsu</PRE>
<P>(Paramount Release 1996)
Starring: Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Jean Reno, Emmanuelle Beart (sp), etc.
Director: Brian DePalma
Running Time: 1:55h</P>
<PRE>(*** out ****)</PRE>
<P>Overview: Motion feature based on TV series about a covert team
assigned to ultra-secret missions revolving espionage, theft,
security bleaks, etc.  Movie version focus on the demise of this
team as it faces an unknown double-crossing agent who aims for
personal gain/objectives. It is a cat-and-mouse chase as  agents
of the covert team try to capture invisible enemy while battling
own agency who has diswowed their membership.</P>
<P>Brian DePalma's Mission Impossible is desperately trying to
replace Twister as the summer blockbuster for 1996. Given recent
string of disasters (Bonfire of Vanities, Raising Caan, etc.),
DePalma tries his best to strenghten a somewhat predictable plot
with hair-raising special effects and a variety of technical
gadgets. But above all, this is Tom Cruise's show.  As an actor,
Cruise has proven that he can carry a movie, but he is also a
co-producer. Finally, Paramount's marketing ploy has made this
film as anticipated as Jurassic Park or possibly Batman (1989). </P>
<P>There are really three 'Mission Impossible' shows: Setup,
Comeback, Survival-of-Fittest.   </P>
<P>In the Setup, the team is assigned to gather irrefutable proof
for the capture of an international spy trying to steal a secret
list containing names of field agents.  Without revealing the
outcome, I will only say that this Mission Impossible has other
predictments involving the Agency itself. </P>
<P>Comeback is the attempt from the agents to find a solution to
the problems caused in the Setup. The solution requires another
Mission Impossible.  This sequence brings the best suspense
moments in the movie. Suffice to say that Cruise does stretch
his acting and body in this sequence.</P>
<P>As a conclusion, Survival-of-Fittest proves once again that
plausibility is not a given in Hollywood. The infamous train
sequence is truly awesome and eye-catching, and totally
unbelievable.  As Cruise goes to capture his invisible enemy, he
defies the laws of Physics and Human Conditioning.   </P>
<P>Two sad notes: The female protagonist (newcomer Emmanuelle Beart
(sp)) shows very limited acting range. Her role was already
small compared to Cruise, but she was easily dismissed even in
key moments.  The plot is rather predictable. Like its TV
counterpart, clues are given out during the movie, but it took
no genius to determine the identity of the secret agent as well
as the Setup sequence. It is sad to say that the expression
given by Ms. Beart revealed all the mistery at that time.    </P>
<P>Despite plot weaknings and uneven acting, I do recommend this
movie as a lighthearted summer diversion as it should be. </P>
