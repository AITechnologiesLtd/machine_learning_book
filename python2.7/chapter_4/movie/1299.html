<PRE>                          WAYNE'S WORLD
                  A film review by Ken Johnson
                   Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>135 min., PG-13, Comedy, 1992
Director: Penelope Spheeris
Cast: Mike Myers, Dana Carvey, Rob Lowe, Donna Dixon, Lara Flynn Boyle,
      Tia Carrere, Alice Cooper, Ione Sky, Robert Patrick, Ed O'Neill,
      Chris Farley, Brian Doyle-Murray, Colleen Camp, Meatloaf</P>
<P>     Wayne and Garth (played in order by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey)
run a public access television show called Wayne's World from Wayne's
basement.  Television executive Rob Lowe wants to buy up the show so he
can put it on a network station.  Mike Myers sees female rocker Tia
Carrere and falls in love with her but is chased by his airhead
ex-girlfriend Lara Flynn Boyle.  Dana Carvey sees beautiful Donna Dixon
and falls in love with her but can't bring up the courage to speak to
her.</P>
<P>     WAYNE'S WORLD is very funny at most times, although it is
occasionally slow.  Probably after you finish the film you won't even
remember the slow scenes.  WAYNE'S WORLD is just a "vege-out" movie,
there is nothing really important said.  Actually there is one point
made in the film.  It is that someone should not sell out to
commercialism.  This film is just for someone who wants to spend a
night at the movies without having to think.  On a scale of zero to
five, I give WAYNE'S WORLD a four.  WAYNE'S WORLD is rated PG-13 for
explicit language, adult situations, and adult humor.</P>
<P>     I don't know whether to recommend that you go out to the theaters
to see WAYNE'S WORLD.  Some of you will love it, some of you will hate
it -- it all depends on your preferences for comedy.  If you are a fan
of "Saturday Night Live" or are a fan of silly movies, like THE NAKED
GUN 2 1/2: THE SMELL OF FEAR and HOT SHOTS!, then I highly recommend
that this film be on your list of films to see.  If you are a fan only
of more subtle comedy, like PRETTY WOMAN or "CROCODILE" DUNDEE, I really
don't recommend that you rush out to the theater to see the film.  This
film will probably lose nothing on video, so those of you unsure about
the film might want to wait for the video to come out.</P>
<P>     WAYNE'S WORLD is based on a series of "Saturday Night Live" skits
created by Mike Myers.  The "Wayne's World" skits on "Saturday Night
Live" tend to be funnier than in this film.  Three members of the cast
of this film, that I know of, are also currently members of "Saturday
Night Live."  Those are, Mike Myers, Dana Carvey, and Chris Farley.</P>
<P>     WAYNE'S WORLD features many cameo appearances by movie and
television stars.  Ed O'Neill ("Married... with Children") stars as a
psychopathic waiter at an all night diner.  Alice Cooper has a concert
performance in the film and talks with Mike Myers and Dana Carvey.
Meatloaf stars as "Tiny."  Robert Patrick (TERMINATOR 2) stars as, well,
you'll see.  Chris Farley stars as a limousine driver.</P>
