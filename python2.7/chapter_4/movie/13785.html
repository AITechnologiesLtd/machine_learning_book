<P>Well, we knew it was going to happen. When a franchise is doing even
remotely well, it behooves the producers to continue running the
series into the ground. We've seen this with almost every horror
franchise since the original 'Frankenstein'. Now there have been
exceptions to the rule. Such films as "New Nightmare" and "The Bride
of Frankenstein" have actually been superior to their originators. But
the 'Halloween' has not been so lucky. While trying to breath fresh
blood into the series, Moustapha Akkad had created an increasingly
absurd complex scenario. What makes this entry in the series is two
remarkable things. Firstly, the return of Jamie Lee Curtis to the role
that started her career, and secondly (and most importantly) a script
that disavows the previous sequels.</P>
<P>The film opens on October 29th. 1998. Nurse Marion Chambers (Nancy
Stephens, returning from the original film) arrives home to find her
home broken into. She gains the assistants of her two teenage
neighbors to call the Police. One of the boys investigates the home
and finds Nurse Chambers' study ransacked. Returning home, the boys
leave Ms.  Chambers to wait for the Police. She finds that her study
has indeed been vandalized and more importantly that the file of
Laurie Stroud has been stolen. Seeing a stranger in the hallway, she
narrow escapes to her neighbor's house. There she finds that the two
boys have already been murdered. The Shape (AKA: Michael Myers)
attacks and kills the nurse as the police arrive.</P>
<P>We are then introduced to Jamie Lee's character Laurie Stroud. She is
the Dean of a private school in Northern California. Divorced and
suffering from anxiety from her earlier experience, she has taken on a
false identity after faking her own death in an attempt to hide from
her murderous brother. Well, her son has recently turned 17, the same
age Laurie was, when Michael he escaped from the asylum back in
'78. Laurie attempts to deal with her fear by irrationally trying to
protect her son from danger. Well in due time, Michael finds his
siblings, and the battle begins.</P>
<P>Horror films for the most part are very, very predictable. You know
all of the set ups by heart. Lights the don't work, cars that refuse
to start when danger is near, etc., etc. All of these are in ample
supply here. The difference between this film and others of it's ink
is Jamie Lee Curtis. Ms. Curtis has always been a fine if not a
remarkable actress. her past performances have always been enlivening
and enjoyable (think 'True Lies', she was the only shinning light in
that ponderous and misogynistic film). Here, Ms. Curtis is center
stage, and she carries the film with a strength and determination that
is refreshingly honest to the character.</P>
<P>The screenplay by scribes Robert Zappia and Matt Greenberg (with
un-credited assistance from Kevin Williamson of 'Scream' fame) is very
tight, with a nicely set up premise and credible (for the most part)
situations. The inclusion of Janet Leigh as Norma (the maintenance
director of the private school) complaining about the drains in the
Girls' shower room being clogged is a marvelously funny tribute to
'Psycho' and a smack in the face to every other filmmaker who has
ripped off that famous scene. References to other works are remarkable
very slight in this film. It's not as jokey as the "Scream" films, in
that "Halloween H20" takes itself seriously. While most of the
characters are not very deeply written, they don't need to be as these
people are recognizable to most of us. What is most refreshing here is
that this film does it's best to do away with the body count mentality
of most horror films. Situations are set up wherein a character is
placed in mortal danger and is not killed. This simple idea leads to a
lot more suspense, and identifies the audience with the main
characters more intimately. Michael Myers is after one person, he only
kills those that get in the way of his goal.</P>
<P>Directed with a sure and steady hand by Steve Miner, Halloween H20 has
lots to offer it's audience. Mr. Miner is no stranger to the horror
genre having helmed the (arguably) best entry in the 'Friday the 13th'
series ("Friday the 13th: 3D"). Having moved onto more mainstream
films ('Forever Young' also with Ms. Curtis, and 'My Father is a
Hero') Mr. Miner shows a true love for the trappings of the genre,
making grand use of lighting and shadow throughout the film. His
handling of his actors is fine, with surprising performances put in by
relative newcomer Josh Hartnett as John Tate, Laurie Stroud's
son. Adam Arkin is fine as school counselor Will Brennan, bringing a
light touch of humor to the proceedings.</P>
<P>Halloween H20 is a fine entry in the horror sweepstakes and a fitting
end to a series that was starting to wear out it's welcome. There's a
lesson to be learned here for Hollywood. It's the writing.. dummies!</P>
