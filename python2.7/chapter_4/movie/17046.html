<P>_Just_the_Ticket_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>Andy and Andie.  Execs at MGM/UA must have been falling all over
themselves with self-satisfaction when someone came up with the
ever-so-precious idea of pairing the homophonically-named Mr. Garcia and
Ms. MacDowell.  In the right vehicle, the two could possibly be as cute
as the pairing of their perfectly-matched first names. 
_Just_the_Ticket_, however, is not that vehicle.</P>
<P>The fact that writer-director Richard Wenk's basic story is wholly
unoriginal is the least of the film's problems.  Actually, that fact
isn't so much a problem as it is a slight annoyance.  It's another one of
those ne'er-do-well-straightens-up-for-the-love-of-a-right-woman stories,
with ticket scalper Gary Starke (Garcia) attempting one last
score--selling tickets to a sold-out papal mass in New York--before
settling into an honest living to win the affections of his fed-up true
love, aspiring chef Linda Paliski (MacDowell).  There wouldn't be a movie
without some types of complication, and the ones Wenk comes up with
aren't exactly new, either.  Among those Gary must contend with: Casino,
a hotshot newcomer moving in on his scalping turf; Linda's impending move
to France; and, as an added afterthought, Linda's _other_ boyfriend, Alex
(Chris Lemmon).</P>
<P>Garcia and MacDowell are likable enough performers that with those
elements in place, _Just_the_Ticket_ could have been a diverting, if
formulaic, trifle.  Yet it isn't.  While the fundamentals of his story
are not to blame, Wenk's execution certainly is.  Garcia is game, but
Wenk's listless direction saps him of all his energy; the film literally
plods to a predictable pace, alternating scenes of Gary selling tickets
with him wooing Linda.  Not helping matters is Wenk's less-than-sparkling
dialogue.  Not only do the one-liners and Gary-Linda repartee fall flat,
so do the straight-faced lines in general--a sure death knell for a film
as talky as this one.</P>
<P>The ineffectiveness of _Just_the_Ticket_ can simply be chalked up to the
fact that it's an astonishingly uninteresting piece of work.  There's
nothing particularly memorable about the story, the characters, or the
performances; I just about forgot each image or word as soon as it left
the screen.  The makers of _Just_the_Ticket_ undoubtedly set out to make
a light entertainment, but instead they've come up with something a bit
moreso--a film that's completely inert.</P>
