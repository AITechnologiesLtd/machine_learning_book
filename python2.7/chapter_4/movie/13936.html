*********************************</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: 
Jeremiah S. Chechik</PRE>
<PRE>Written by:
Don MacPherson, from the Sydney Newman television series</PRE>
<PRE>Starring: 
Uma Thurman, Ralph Fiennes</PRE>
<P>Synopsis: 
The plot revolves around a failed weather project called Prospero, which
Mrs. Peel (Uma Thurman) once worked on. British agent John Steed (Ralph
Fiennes) joins Peel in investigating, and soon they stumble upon an evil
plot to rule the world. </P>
<P>Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) is their main adversary. Sir August
has a weather machine which can control the weather of any part of the
world, and he wants countries to pay him tribute so that he won't attack
local weather. Sir August also has a serious Mrs. Peel obsession; he
keeps her painted picture up in his room. An island fortress serves as
de Wynter's base of operations.</P>
<P>Will Steed and Peel storm the island fortress and defeat de Wynter?</P>
<P>Background: 
The original 1960s serial THE AVENGERS featured Patrick MacNee and Diana
Rigg as a crime-solving duo. MacNee was John Steed, a dapper veddy
British chap, and Rigg was Emma Peel, a young, pretty, insatiably
curious, mystery-loving platonic widow friend of Steed's. Together they
drove an open-buggy car around the English countryside with a kind of
devil-may-care confidence - - cheerfully drinking tea and solving cozy
mysteries. </P>
<P>The 1998 version of THE AVENGERS attempts to update these two characters
for the 90s, giving us Ralph Fiennes as Steed and Uma Thurman as Emma
Peel.</P>
<P>Opinion:
If you're anticipating a sophomoric film, here's a hint: the bad guys
are dressed as stuffed animals, and wear big teddy bear costumes. The
dialogue seems very forced, and you can find better British accents in
THE PARENT TRAP.</P>
<P>Actually the problem with THE AVENGERS is predictability. Right in the
beginning, Steed and Peel visit de Wynter's palacial estate to solicit
his expertise on weather. They find that de Wynter's mansion grounds are
filled with dangerous weather anomalies, and Steed gets attacked.</P>
<P>So we know de Wynter is the bad guy. Instead of busting the guy, Steed
and Peel go chasing around, belaboring obvious clues which, of course,
point straight back to de Wynter by the movie's end. "Why didn't you
tell me about de Wynter?" says Steed to his informant (Patrick MacNee).
To which Jones replies, "You didn't ask."</P>
<PRE>Roll the final battle scene.</PRE>
