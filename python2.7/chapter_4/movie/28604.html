<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Warning: spoilers to follow throughout. It's not possible to write this
review without revealing the key problematic elements of the film,
though I believe these spoilers will not ruin the viewing of this film;
yet, some might prefer to read the review after seeing the film.</P>
<P>The War Zone is located in an isolated Devon farmhouse, where a family
is undergoing a crisis; it's a family of four, with one on the way, who
have moved here recently from London. There's the very nurturing Earth
Mother (Tilda Swinton); Ray Winstone is the father with both a loving
and a nasty side to him, who can't keep his hands off his 18-year-old
daughter; Jessie (Lara Belmont) is the oldest child who is trapped in an
incestuous relationship; Tom is her 15-year-old, brooding, younger
brother who hates living in the country and confronts his sister that he
knows what's going on and doesn't approve of it.</P>
<P>This makes for a grim drama that is intelligently directed by actor Tim
Roth, in his first directorial effort, as adapted from the novel by
Alexander Stuart, who also did the screenplay; the performances as well
as the photography of the haunting countryside are first-rate, but
nothing particularly insightful materializes about this sexually abusive
situation. Somehow after all the grimness of this story plays out and we
see all the graphic details, the story still doesn't grab us emotionally
as much as we wanted it to.</P>
<P>We are given a hint of the violence that is to come in the early scenes,
when Mum goes into labor and dad packs the family into the car to speed
her to the hospital; but, when his attention is diverted by a family
squabble he overturns the car. This causes scrapes and bruises to all,
but Mum gives birth to baby Alice.</P>
<P>Back home the dramatics are increasingly played out by Tom and Jessie,
with a dismally rainy Devon countryside in the background, as Jessie
denies Tom's charges, perhaps out of shame or maybe that's the way most
victims of abuse react to facing the shameful truth. But Tom follows
them one day to a deserted bunker along the beautiful ocean coastline
and clearly sees dad poking his sis up the ass, in what must be viewed
as a repugnant consensual rape.</P>
<P>The story plays out as the sexually frustrated Tom doesn't know quite
how to drop this bombshell as he flashes silent hatred for dad, growing
contempt for his tormented sis, and pity for his warm-hearted Mum, who
might have an inkling or might not about what is happening to her
daughter. The tension slowly builds in a household that appears
outwardly as a loving one, until it reaches its expected boiling point.
It pits the brutish cunningness of Winstone against the vulnerability of
his devastated children. Unfortunately the story and the
characterizations can't ferret out more to this story except what Tom
despairingly utters to his sis in the end: What are we going to do now?
This doesn't leave the audience much room to do anything but gasp at the
shameful situation presented and the dirty little secret that too many
families find themselves in and can't deal with.</P>
