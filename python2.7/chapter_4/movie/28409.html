<P>"I'd go with you but..." 
"I know, there's a problem with your face." 
 --- Typical (and hilarious) dialogue exchange between lawyer Gracie Law
(Kim Cattrall) and trucker Jack Burton, in the action-comedy Big Trouble
in Little China. </P>
<P>Martial arts, fantasy, action, comedy, romance, drama, science fiction,
horror... all these genres finally come together in one movie.  John
Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China is that movie, and it sits along
side Halloween and The Thing as one of his best films. </P>
<P>Truck driver Jack Burton (Kurt Russell, playing the role with just a
touch of John Wayne) rolls into Chinatown and wins a sizable cash sum
while gambling with his friend Wang (Dennis Dun).  Wang has some
business to attend to before he can pay Jack, so Jack tags along to
ensure he gets his winnings.  Jack and Wang wind up in the middle of
mystical war between good and evil, with a 2000 year old demon sorcerer
named Lo Pan (James Hong) leading the charge for evil. </P>
<P>I remember discovering this little gem of a movie at the discount
theater in my town, right before school started up for the fall.  After
seeing it, I went back countless times... making sure both friends and
family came along as well.  What a great time at the movies this was. </P>
<P>Carpenter says that what he likes most about this film is how somewhere
along the way, the hero becomes the sidekick, the sidekick becomes the
hero, and the two are never aware of the switch.  This is absolutely the
film's main appeal... contrary to what studio execs might have thought
at the time (they requested Carpenter add the scene which begins the
film to make Burton seem more like a hero).  It's a blast to see these
two character-types reversed.  It works wonders for what might have
otherwise been a simple Indiana Jones clone. </P>
<P>It's interesting to note Kurt Russell's performance here.  While he's no
Robert DeNiro, Russell is a very fine actor in his own right.  Just take
for example the five times Russell has teamed up with Carpenter: Escape
from New York and Escape from L.A., Elvis, The Thing, and Big Trouble in
Little China.  While all but one of those films is an action film,
Russell's performance completely differs in each one.  Of the five, Jack
Burton might just be my favorite. </P>
<P>As a sidenote, the mid-80s really excelled in some great looking
lightning and other electrical effects.  Movies like this one, Weird
Science and My Science Project all featured this really well done type
of effect (using nothing more than simple animation basically) that just
can't be properly duplicated by today's CGI workstations. </P>
<P>Big Trouble in Little China is available on DVD in an excellent special
edition package from Fox Home Entertainment.  This two-disc set features
a number of quality extras that should satisfy even the die hard fans of
this film.  The first disc features the film in its original widescreen
theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1, anamorphically enhanced.  The film's
transfer looks incredibly good, and the audio is equally impressive. 
The menu screens are nifty here as well, recreating the main set from
the end of the film and having the menu selections interact with it. 
The main extra feature on this first disc is a full length commentary
track with director John Carpenter and star Kurt Russell. </P>
<P>If you're familiar with the commentary tracks on The Thing and for
Escape From New York (laserdisc only at this time, unfortunately), then
you're in for another treat with this one.  Best nugget of info I
learned here is that the original script was for a western (!) until
writer/director W.D. Richter (The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai) adapted
it to a modern day setting.  Had this film been made as a western, I
believe it would have successfully melded every single genre of
filmmaking. </P>
<P>Watching and commenting on the film is essentially abandoned about
halfway through, so while its not exactly screen specific, listening to
these two men reminisce is simply delightful.  Russell gets in a couple
of anonymous shots at his (then) upcoming disaster 3000 Miles To
Graceland, and poses an interesting theory late in the track about the
current state of movies today and how many young directors have no
vision.  It's strange though that Carpenter agrees with Russell's
assessment, since this was Carpenter's last "great" film to date. 
Carpenter also spends a lot of time mentioning Kurt Russell's film
Captain Ron. </P>
<P>Disc two features a number of additional extras.  First up is a rather
large collection of deleted scenes, alternate takes, and an extended
ending, all presented in what might be the best way I can think of to
present such material.  Each selection is first given a text screen,
explaining the deleted material and why it was cut.  Then, many times
you're given the option of watching either the workprint or the video
master version, which gives you a choice of quality and a choice between
seeing just the deleted footage by itself, or as it would have been fit
into a particular scene.  Great stuff here. </P>
<P>A video interview with special effects guru Richard Edlund is also on
the second disc, and it makes great use of both the still gallery
feature and the multiple angle feature.  I rarely find still galleries
worthwhile, but the minds behind this disc found a way to do it right. 
Edlund is filmed in a sort of "TV news" manner where he's on one side of
the screen, leaving empty space on the other side for graphics.  It's in
this space that you'll see a montage of special effects stills, mostly
relevant to what Edlund is talking about at that given moment.  Then, by
using the angle feature on your DVD player, you can select to see the
still montage full frame, while the audio of the interview plays
underneath.  Great, great stuff.</P>
<P>Also on the second disc is an absolutely goofy and typically 1980s music
video for the film's theme song "Big Trouble in Little China" (which
plays over the film's end credits).  The song is performed by "The Coupe
de Villes", a group consisting of John Carpenter, Nick Castle
(Halloween's Michael Myers) and Tommy Lee Wallace (director of Halloween
III: Season of the Witch).  My only question: Did this actually receive
airtime somewhere?  I can't imagine that it would have, as it really
helps to define the word "uncool".  In any case, it's a rare extra
feature related to the film and its fun to own. </P>
<P>Rounding out the extras on the second disc are three trailers for the
film (one of which is in Spanish), six TV spots (including one for Pay
Per View), biographies for the cast and crew, a still gallery, and two
magazine articles from the time of the film's release.  The articles are
the only part of this release that even comes close to being considered
a negative, but only because the text is a little too small to read (on
most televisions anyway).  Hidden on the second disc (although not hard
to find) are additional trailers for Aliens and The Fly in a gallery
called "Summer 1986", and screenshots from the Commodore 64 computer
game version of the film. </P>
<P>Fox had high hopes for Big Trouble in Little China (it was their July
4th weekend release in 1986) and apparently due to a poor advertising
campaign, the film wasn't as successful as it should have been.  So it
was surprising that they've given this film a super-deluxe DVD package. 
If you've never seen the film before, definitely give these discs a
spin.  It's a great set for a fun flick... and is one of the best DVD
releases of 2001. PG-13
