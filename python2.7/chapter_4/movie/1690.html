<PRE>                                   SCENT OF A WOMAN
                       A film review by James Berardinelli
                        Copyright 1993 James Berardinelli</PRE>

<P>     SCENT OF A WOMAN is about Charles Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a Boston
prep school senior, and the Thanksgiving weekend he spends working as
the  companion of Lt. Colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino), an embittered,
lonely, blind veteran.  The job, which doesn't seem all that enjoyable
to start  with, degenerates further when Slade decides to make an
unexpected visit  to New York City.</P>
<P>     There are certain actors that, when they appear in a film, are
almost  invariably indicators that the production is one of quality.
They are an elite few, with names like Nicholson, Hoffman, Hackman, and
Pacino.   Considering some of the roles that Al Pacino has played in the
past (THE GODFATHER trilogy, for example), it would be hyperbole to say
that he gives the "performance of a lifetime" in SCENT OF A WOMAN.
However, there's no doubting that for most actors, this would be a
career-capper.  And though Pacino has given performances of this
strength before, that in no way  diminishes the effort he invests in
SCENT OF A WOMAN.</P>
<P>     Chris O'Donnell, a fresh-but-not-unknown face, also does a solid
job in the more experienced man's shadow.  His role is
nicely-understated as well as  human, and he manages to fashion a
rapport with the audience.  This is necessary for the film to succeed,
since it's through his eyes that the story unfolds.</P>
<P>     In essence, SCENT OF A WOMAN is another in a never-ending series of
bonding  pictures where each person has something unique to offer to the
other.   However, this movie is special; it goes deeper than the average
film of its ilk, plumbing the depths of two superbly-rendered
characters.  There are  numerous dynamic scenes, along with a surprising
amount of comedy.  Director/ Producer Martin Brest knows how to blend
humor with drama.  His mix is nearly flawless, and he manages to do
almost the entire film without resorting to cheap, manipulative tricks.
Laughter, tears, and cheers are genuine - straight from the heart - not
the result of the movie-makers maneuvering us into  giving
pre-programmed responses.  Considering how sound the bulk of this film
is, the final moments are weak, but skillfully handled nevertheless.
Brest is also a master at encouraging viewers to suspend disbelief.
There's a scene in SCENT OF A WOMAN with Pacino and O'Donnell in a
Ferrari that, while  implausible, is natural in the context of the film.</P>
<P>     The movie is as long as its storyline demands.  It doesn't seem
like two and one-half hours, and less time with these characters would
have cheated the audience.  Aided by an emotive score from Thomas
Newman, SCENT OF A WOMAN is a masterful production and a superb way to
start 1993.  </P>
