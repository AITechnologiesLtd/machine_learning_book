<P>You've seen this moment before, recently: a particularly troubled
character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room
temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing. The difference is
that when it happens to Lili Taylor's Nell in The Haunting, we don't
care. The hero of The Sixth Sense, a young boy named Cole, is a rich
creation, and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him
to take a hike.</P>
<P>The seasons have changed since an ex-patient shot jaded child
psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Willis) in the comfort of his own bedroom.
Desperate to get his career back on track, even at the expense of his
crumbling marriage (to Williams, of Rushmore), Malcolm councils the
deeply troubled Cole (Osment). The preteen displays all the quirks of
Malcolm's would-be killer: scars on his body; antisocial behaviour;
and the reluctance to reveal a big secret. Only after Cole is locked
in a closet by some bullies (and hospitalized as a result) does he
divulge to Malcolm, in a spine-tingling scene, that he sees dead
people walking among us, all the time.</P>
<P>Malcolm assumes, and given his profession, reasonably so, that Cole is
schizophrenic, not psychic, but the sincerity in Cole's anguished
confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures. He will
instead pursue the supernatural angle, becoming a kind of surrogate
father to Cole (who lives with his single mother, Lynn (Collette)) in
the process.</P>
<P>The Sixth Sense has more in common with Ghost than Poltergeist.
(Though Shyamalan does, somewhat unforgiveably, crib the
self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter.) It's far more
heartwarming than frightening, and the film would be none the worse
for wear without its few pulp shocks. Cole attracts the dead for
reasons unknown, but they're not out to harm him, really-they just
want to be heard, even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the
innocent gradeschooler. Perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to
us, at first, than they really are because we're looking at the
situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old.</P>
<P>That's right: Willis, for the first time in years, gives up the
spotlight to his costar. We appreciate Malcolm's domestic dilemma, but
we identify with Cole, recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the
closet monster or the thing under the bed. Both actors deliver
immensely likable performances, and their dynamic is manifest. Willis
convinces us that he's a doctor, something he was unable to do as a
horndog shrink in the overheated Color of Night. Osment is phenomenal,
a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child
stars with too much experience in television commercials do.</P>
<P>The Sixth Sense (atmospherically shot by The Silence of the Lambs'
cinematographer, Tak Fujimoto) is actually a drama-its spooky,
effective ad campaign is misleading. Only because I was expecting
something different did I notice-rather, feel-the movie's running
time, which is just shy of two hours. The story unfurls slowly but
engrossingly; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait. I'm
not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof, but I admired its
audacity.</P>
