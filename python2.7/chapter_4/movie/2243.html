<PRE>                                A BRONX TALE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Calogero is growing up in the Bronx in
     the late 50s with two father figures.  One is his honest,
     hard-working, biological father and the other is a likable
     hood who takes Calogero under his wing.  Robert DeNiro
     directs the film as well as playing the honest father while
     the screenwriter of the semi-autobiographical story turns in
     a winning performance as the hood.  Rating: low +2 (-4 to
     +4).</P>
<P>     When I think of Robert DeNiro these days, I mostly think about an
interview he gave about GUILTY BY SUSPICION.  His comments about the
blacklisting era were so shallow and so lacking in information and insight
that at the time I assumed he was a person with few talents other than
line-reading.  Now I have to reassess that conclusion after seeing his
directorial debut.</P>
<P>     Romantic love triangles are a staple of the film industry.  For Robert
DeNiro's directorial debut he has chosen a story with a different sort of
love triangle, one of paternal love.  Calogero has two father figures in his
life.  His true father (played by DeNiro) is a poor bus driver.  That does
not get a lot of respect in the Bronx Italian community in the late Fifties.
What does get respect is being a hood like the local neighborhood boss Sonny
(Chazz Palminteri).  One day Sonny kills a man and nine-year-old Calogero
lies to save his idol Sonny from the police.  From that point on Sonny
adopts Colgero, after a fashion.  Both he and Lorenzo, Colgero's real
father, want what is best for the boy, but Lorenzo is a straight arrow and
wants his son to have nothing to do with the hood.  In spite of his own
profession, Sonny wants to keep Colgero honest and put him on the path to
success.</P>
<P>     Francis Capra is a little too sharp playing the nine-year-old Calogero.
He is just a bit overly clever in his repartee with his parents.  But then
screenwriter Palminteri is actually writing about himself so might be a
little willing to exaggerate his own verbal prowess when he was Calogero's
age.  And Calogero does have  to be a little devious in how he balances his
two father figures.  The second part of the story has Calogero (now played
by Lillo Brancato) seventeen years old and romantically interested in an
attractive Black girl (Taral Hicks).  The story comes to involve tensions
between the Black and Italian communities in the Bronx.  Now to Calogero,
Sonny seems to be the only sane and tolerant person in the Italian
community.</P>
<P>     The story of A BRONX TALE is based on the Palminteri's semi-
autobiographical play which he used to perform as a one-person show.  The
details of life in the Bronx and the style of storytelling are reminiscent
of GOODFELLAS and DeNiro even has a cameo for Joe Pesci.  Just as earlier
this year Mel Gibson proved he had a better hand at directing than most of
us would have expected, so too DeNiro's style is surprisingly good for a
first-timer.  He has a very sure hand at combining music into the action.
His direction shows this in one of the first scenes of the film in which a
montage of scenes from a stickball game are synchronized to a do-wop song.</P>
<P>     But the real show-stealer is Palminteri himself as Sonny.  The same
stage presence that worked for him doing the story in his one-man show
translates to charisma on the screen.  Like Joe Mantegna in HOUSE OF GAMES,
Palminteri is the central attraction whenever he is on the screen.  As the
hood, Sonny is magnetic while the audience expectation is that he will at
some point do something nasty and his relationship with the boy will break
down.  That may or may not happen, but the character is real enough to
transcend stereotypes and the story of the relationship probably more
interesting and credible than most fiction writers would have made it.
DeNiro proves himself as an accomplished director his first time around.  My
rating is a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
