<PRE>Pleasantville
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) Pleasantville is that rare movie that is
thought-provoking without being substantive. It's a parable without a
meaning. A metaphor without a referent. It's enjoyable and stimulating,
but it's not as deep as it leads you to believe.</P>
<P>David (Tobey Maguire) is a high school nerd. His greasy black hair is
the perfect complement to his encyclopedic knowledge of TV Trivia. He
has clearly grown up with Nick at Night, and his favorite show is
Pleasantville, a combination of Father Knows Best and Leave It To
Beaver.</P>
<P>His sister Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) wants to watch the MTV concert
with her boyfriend one evening, but David wants to watch the
Pleasantville marathon so he can enter the trivia contest. </P>
<P>Their fight results in a broken remote control, without which the TV
will not function. Coincidentally, a mysterious TV repair man (Don
Knotts) shows up at their door with a super duper remote control.</P>
<P>The repairman is so impressed by David's knowledge of Pleasantville
trivia that he leaves them the remote free of charge. David clicks the
remote and he and Jennifer suddenly find themselves in Pleasantville.
They are now trapped in the sanitary, black-and-white "utopia" of 1950s
sitcoms. David and Jennifer are now "Bud" and "Mary Sue," at least until
they can find that repairman again.</P>
<P>David knows this universe pretty well and he is able to cope with the
change. Living in utopia and having a knowable, predictable future is
actually something "Bud" is looking forward to.</P>
<P>In contrast, Jennifer is angry and resentful. She accepts that the
universe around her has changed, but she's not going to play along with
it. When she finally makes it to school, she introduces the word "cool"
to her friends as a substitute for "swell." When she gets bored (which
doesn't take too long) she seduces Mary Sue's boyfriend (who's never
done more than hold hands with a girl) in the back seat of his car.</P>
<P>Her boyfriend had never heard of sex before (this IS the land where
married couples sleep five feet apart on single beds). So when he
experiences it for the first time, a rose appears in full, vivid, living
color. The next day he tells his friends about the experience and soon,
everyone is having sex and seeing real colors.</P>
<P>The universe as the inhabitants of Pleasantville know it shatters. Mr.
Johnson (Jeff Daniels) who runs the soda shop learns about free will the
hard way. Firemen learn about fires. Students learn about books. Boys
learn about girls and girls learn about boys. With each revelation comes
a new splash of color into the black and white world.</P>
<P>It seems as though modern ideas are so strong that they are unstoppable.
But after about half of the townspeople pop into full color,
Pleasantville hits a plateau. Some residents just don't like or
understand what is happening. They cling to their old-fashioned black
and white ways, and they don't experience the colorful epiphanies their
friends and families had.</P>
<P>Some people without color resent these changes that they can't control,
so they resort to prejudice and violence. The movie hits its climax with
Bud's trial in a colorless courtroom with colorless jurors and a fearful
colorless judge.</P>
<P>Although I enjoyed this film, I was ultimately disappointed that this
elaborate parable had so little meaning. The only apparent lesson is
that change - exciting to some and feared by others - is inevitable.
Lots of other lessons take shape, but when you think about them too
hard, they dissolve.</P>
<P>For example, it seems that passion sparks the change from black and
white to color. If true, it would lead to all sorts of interesting
conclusions about what the movie was trying to say. Later, an angry mob
smashes a store window and none of them change color. The film now says
that passion has to be "good" in order to effect the change to color. It
leads to a different set of ideas about the film. Still later in the
film, one of the last black and white holdouts changes color by
confronting his own hatred. The film once again changes its own rules,
leaving one to wonder if there really was supposed to be a metaphor at
work.</P>
<P>(NOTE: Gary Ross responded to this question in Ebert's "Answer Man"
column. Nevertheless, that's not a resource available to you when you're
sitting in the theater.)</P>
<P>I was also disappointed that this movie avoided some of the bigger
issues that could have made it really interesting. For example, when the
town is split, the black-and-whites are not given equal time. The film
doesn't let the audience see their point of view. It ignores the
deep-down terror they must feel at watching their world collapse. Why
weren't there any black-and-white suicides? What if the last one were
unable to change? Would the new colorful world have a place for these
leftovers, or would they become Pleasantville's forgotten homeless?</P>
<P>Finally, Ross let the film have an all-too-easy outcome. Conventional
storytelling doesn't let Utopia come without some cost. Utopia is too
boring or sterile to be one's permanent residence, or it requires some
sacrifice the characters aren't willing to make. Yet by the end of the
film, not only has everyone become colorful, the world is still free of
crime, rape, violence, and presumably toilets. A little turmoil in the
middle allowed the world of Pleasantville to become a true utopia, and
that usually isn't allowed in fiction. (Even more unconventional is that
Jennifer's decision at film's end is allowed to stand!)</P>
<P>Both before and during the movie, I was rooting to be won over, and I
actually enjoyed the experience. But it turns out my expectations were
too high. I saw that Ross was searching for human Truths, but the whole
thing fell apart in my head not long after the movie was over.</P>
<P>Still, I did enjoy it and it was worth thinking about outside the
theater, if only for an hour. That still lets me recommend this film.</P>
