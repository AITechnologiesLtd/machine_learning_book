<PRE>"City of Angels" Earns Its Wings
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>Tender and light-hearted, "City of Angels" is a romantic comedy about
angelic Seth (Nicholas Cage) who develops an earthly interest in an
amazingly aware and vibrant doctor (Meg Ryan).  As it turns out, angels
have always been among us but choose not to be seen.  Depicted in the
film as human-looking, black full-length coat wearing men and women,
angels follow us, perch themselves atop high structures to solemnly
reflect humanity, and can read everyone's thoughts.  They can provide a
dose of calmness when we are in despair or are our escorts to heaven
when we pass away.  However, most angels lack ambition and curiosity,
and they spend their existence watching over others in a trance-like
state.  Seth, however, is curious and wonders if there is more to his
existence.</P>
<P>His curiosity is further fueled when he meets the doctor, Maggie Rice.
During a tricky operation, she begins to lose her patient.  After
failing to resuscitate him, she becomes distraught, and questions her
ability to save lives.  Turning to her colleague and pseudo-boyfriend,
she wonders, "who are we fighting against?"  Is there more to her
existence?  </P>
<P>The setting is now ripe for the two to meet.  Making himself visible, he
takes the time to explore Maggie's world and the wonders of life as seen
through her eyes.  Poetic and stately, he impresses her with his sense
of curiosity.   As Maggie relishes every bite of her favorite fruit,
Seth quietly says, "I don't know what that pear tastes like to you.
Describe it as Hemmingway would."  Meanwhile, he is taken aback by her
effervescence and lust for life.  They begin to grow close, but as an
angel, he knows nothing about matters of the heart because he can not
feel.  He confides his confusion to fellow angel Cassiel (Andre
Braugher), and also learns more about what love is from a hospital
patient (Dennis Franz) who has an uncanny understanding of his
situation.  But with love comes sacrifice.  What can Seth do?</P>
<P>The real treat of this movie is Ryan's sunny disposition and radiance.
As she falls in love with Seth, all sorts of questions begin to arise
for her.  Are you married?  Are you homeless?  Are you a drummer?  Why
do you always where the same clothes?  She knows how to convey her
doe-eyed confusion, especially in a scene where she begins to learn his
true nature, which is bittersweet and funny.  In the kitchen, Seth
seemingly slices off his finger, but Maggie notices that there is no
blood.  She is about to be thrust into the unknown...much like any new
relationship.</P>
<P>The script and presentation works in allowing us to connect with our own
questions of mortality and reminds us to appreciate the things that we
take for granted.  Remember to savor each bite and to let the sun bask
your face in its warmth.  Remember to appreciate the touch of someone
you love and to let the cool ocean waves stimulate your body.  City of
Angels is a purposeful and touching story that looks at two people who
represent two elements that frequently remains a mystery to many...that
of life and love.</P>
