<PRE>                              ESPECIALLY ON SUNDAY
                       A film review by James Berardinelli
                        Copyright 1993 James Berardinelli</PRE>
<PRE>Rating (Linear 0 to 10):  7.0</PRE>
<PRE>Date Released:  10/1/93
Running Length:  1:27
Rated:  R (Nudity, sexual situations, language)</PRE>
<PRE>Music:  Ennio Morricone
Released by Miramax Films
In Italian with English subtitles</PRE>
<P>     ESPECIALLY ON SUNDAY is a collection of three very
loosely-connected shorts that take place in a dreamy Italian village.
All three were written by Tonino Guerra, so there are some common
themes to the stories, especially the first and third.  Each is wrapped
in its own sense of ethereal unreality, and the mysticism is as
enchanting here as it is in full-length features such as LIKE WATER FOR
CHOCOLATE.  ESPECIALLY ON SUNDAY is the kind of movie that suggested by
its title:  a frothy picture perfect for consumption when the viewer is
ready for a break from the rigors of life.</P>
<P>     ESPECIALLY ON SUNDAY's three tales are connected by an
even-shorter envelope story that involves a boy, a motorcyclist, and
some birds.  This is perhaps the weakest element of the movie since, in
addition to having far too little time to accomplish much of anything
worthwhile, it does nothing to effectively link the more substantial
parts of the film.  One wonders why this was added in the first place,
but since it's only six minutes long, the damage is minimal.</P>
<PRE>"The Blue Dog"</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  8.4</PRE>
<PRE>     Running Time:  0:30</PRE>
<PRE>     Director:  Guiseppe Tornatore
     Producer:  Amedeo Pagani
     Written by:  Tonino Guerra
     Starring:  Philippe Noiret</PRE>
<P>     The best of the three shorts, "The Blue Dog" is a sometimes funny,
sometimes poignant tale about a man and the unwanted animal who dogs
his every footstep.  Amleto (Philippe Noiret) is a barber who has a
strong dislike of dogs.  In his words, they smell and carry lice.  For
some unknown reason, a dog with a blue spot on its forehead begins to
follow him, and the more Amleto tries to shake the animal, the more
insistent its pursuit becomes.</P>
<P>     While one might normally think there's little that can be done
with such a simple story, "The Blue Dog" gives unexpected depth to this
one.  Handled with deft skill by Guiseppe Tornatore (who directed
CINEMA PARADISO), the short wastes no time giving the audience an
exceptionally strong sense of character.  For "The Blue Dog" to work,
Amleto has to become a real person, and this is effectively, and
quickly, accomplished.</P>
<P>     There's quite a bit of humor in the movie, and it's
perfectly-placed to counterbalance some of the more serious aspects.
Of the three shorts, "The Blue Dog" is the least complex, the longest,
and the most enjoyable.  It shares with "Snow on Fire" the theme of how
the loss of something familiar can profoundly affect a life.</P>
<PRE>"Especially on Sunday"</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  7.0</PRE>
<PRE>     Running Time:  0:24</PRE>
<PRE>     Director:  Guiseppe Bertolucci
     Producer:  Giovanna Romagnoli
     Written by:  Tonino Guerra
     Starring:  Ornella Muti, Bruno Ganz, Andrea Prodan, 
                Nicoletta Braschi</PRE>
<P>     While "The Blue Dog" is basically suitable for family consumption,
"Especially on Sunday" is decidedly adult in its erotic nature.  This
is the only one of the three shorts to feature full frontal female
nudity.  The story centers around Vittorio (Bruno Ganz), a suave,
confidant man who comes across Anna (Ornella Muti) and her supposed
brother Marco (Andrea Prodan) one Sunday afternoon.  There is an
immediate sexual connection between Vittorio and Anna, but finding a
moment together becomes difficult because of Marco's constant
presence.  As the day winds down, Vittorio tries subterfuge to gain his
ends, but instead finds something completely unexpected.</P>
<P>     About the only connection that this short has with the previous
one is the sudden, brief appearance of Amleto grumbling about how dogs
stink and carry lice.  The eroticism of the story connects it more
concretely with "Snow on Fire," however.</P>
<P>     While "Especially on Sunday" is a nice dance with the unusual,
it's far from a complete story.  The plot and characters need a lot of
fleshing out, and this could easily have been a full-length feature.
None of the relationships are ever nailed down, leading to a sense of
incompleteness when this all-too-short tale concludes.</P>
<P>     The best element of "Especially on Sunday" is the presence of
Ornella Muti, a beautiful and exotic actress who is perfectly cast here
in the role of a wild, mysterious temptress.</P>
<PRE>"Snow on Fire"</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  6.0</PRE>
<PRE>     Running Time:  0:23</PRE>
<PRE>     Director:  Marco Tullio Giordana
     Producer:  Mario Orfini
     Written by:  Tonino Guerra
     Starring:  Maria Maddalena Fellini, Chiara Casselli</PRE>
<P>     "Snow on Fire" is about the complicit voyeurism that develops
between an elderly woman and her new daughter-in-law.  Caterina (Maria
Maddalena Fellini, the sister of the legendary director) lives in the
bedroom above her newly-married son.  One night, she discovers an
easily-dislodged brick in the floor.  Removing it, she finds a window
into her son's bedroom.  As she watches him and his bride (Chiara
Casselli) making love, the two womens' eyes meet, and the
daughter-in-law makes it clear that she doesn't mind being observed.</P>
<P>     This short, in addition to taking less screen time than the
others, is the least engaging.  The premise is interesting, but somehow
all the pieces don't fall into place.  Perhaps more time would have
helped develop the characters and situations better, but the story
seems overly long already.</P>
<P>     We aren't given the opportunity to get to know Caterina and her
daughter-in-law, so the motivations of the two never take on an
emotional depth.  The reasons and morals of the nighttime activities
are examined from both sides (each through a confession to a priest who
tries ineffectually to deny his fascination), but we are sadly cheated
of a full exploration of such potentially-intriguing issues.</P>
<P>     So, while this short is expertly directed and exquisitely
photographed (by Franco Lecca), its strengths don't run deeper than the
purely visual.  The message that it's trying to convey is presented
with greater impact in "The Blue Dog."  The only thing that "Snow on
Fire" adds is a coy sexuality and a glance at the compulsion of
voyeurism.</P>
