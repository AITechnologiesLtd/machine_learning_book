<PRE>                                  THE WAR
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Elijah Wood, Kevin Costner, Mare Winningham, Lexi Randall.
Screenplay:  Kathy McWorter.
Director:  Jon Avnet.</P>
<P>     If they gave out Academy Awards for earnestness, THE WAR would
have to be one of the front-runners.  War, it solemnly intones, is bad;
so are racism and sexism.  And so they are.  But THE WAR unfolds as
though it had discovered those concepts, never letting an opportunity
for an applause-generating speech go by the wayside.  As a result, some
very impressive performances are wasted on a script that just tries far
too hard to deliver a very simplistic moral.</P>
<P>     THE WAR is the story of the Simmons family, living in Juliette,
Mississippi circa 1970.  Father Stephen (Kevin Costner) is recently
returned from Vietnam, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder
and unable to hold down a job, leaving it to mom Lois (Mare Winningham)
to keep the family afloat.  Their two children, meanwhile, face battles
of their own.  Stu (Elijah Wood) and his friends find themselves in
perpetual conflict with a surly group of siblings called the Lipnickis;
Lidia (Lexi Randall) finds out about racism through the mistreatment of
her black best friends in school.  But the siblings share a love of
their treehouse fort, and learn their own lessons about war when the
Lipnickis try to take it from them.</P>
<P>     Screenwriter Kathy McWorter clearly has her heart in the right
place.  The problem is that it's in too many places.  If all she had
wanted to do was to create an allegorical tale about war, it might have
worked; instead she adds scenes like the one in a summer school
classroom where a racist teacher (Christine Baranski) unfairly accuses
Lidia's friend Elvadine (LaToya Chisholm) of disrupting the class.
It's not even enough that Elvadine gets to tell off the teacher in a
completely over-the-top speech; Lidia has to get her two cents in as
well.  McWorter appears convinced that wherever one speech is good, two
must be even better.  Actually, no speeches would have been preferable
most of the time, particularly in a scene where poor Elijah Wood
practically has to deliver a sermon while trying to save someone's
life.  The script is overloaded with homilies, and needed a good
re-write at least fifteen minutes shorter.</P>
<P>     One of the goals of that re-write should have been removing the
characters of Lidia and her friends entirely.  The relationship between
the Simmons siblings is given only a cursory treatment, and the
narration Lidia provides could just as easily have been provided by
Stu, or not at all.  The girls seem to exist primarily to create a
battle of the sexes with Stu's friends (which the girls win, naturally)
and for the classroom sub-plot which is really superfluous.  THE WAR is
first and foremost about the relationship between Stu and Stephen, and
there are too many tangents which ignore that relationship.</P>
<P>     When Costner and Wood are the focus of attention, THE WAR is
actually quite compelling.  Costner gives an intelligent, understated
performance which shows Stephen's desperate attempts to find purpose in
the post-Vietnam world where he needs to feel he's making a difference,
and to impress upon his children the futility of fighting, while Wood
gives Stu an undercurrent of anger towards Stephen even as he tries to
support him.  There is tremendous conflict in their relationship, and
both actors do a fine job of bringing it out.  Sadly, McWorter and
director Jon Avnet are more interested in heavy-handedness than they
are in character study, so that by the time the climactic battle for
the treehouse rolls around, the point has been made and made and made
again.  Then, just in case you missed it the first ten times, "Peace
Train" plays over the closing credits.</P>
<PRE>     Now let me get this straight:  war is bad, right?</PRE>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 treehouses:  4.</PRE>
