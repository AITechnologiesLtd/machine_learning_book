<PRE>Cinema on Drugs
Human Traffic</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Wow, what to say? If you liked "Clerks" or are deep into the "rave" culture
you'll no doubt enjoy this wacky drugged out piece of video-cinema.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the majority of the movie-going population may think
otherwise. Heavy on the "F" word, focusing on illegal drug consumption and
expressed in a thick hyperactive and Welsh/British tongue; "Human Traffic"
nonetheless keeps an uncaring chin up, proud as it is paranoid.</P>
<P>Subject matter aside, the production is a drain trap, catching all the
social and philosophic ramblings of some excitable young UK talent, high,
coming down, and otherwise never at a loss for words.</P>
<P>Almost entirely character driven, there is a faint attempt to make a plot
out of getting an extra ticket so that this motley group of starburst mates
can hit the hottest dance/drug club in all of Cardiff. Oh, and another
smaller tension created by two best friends of opposite sex wondering if
there's more to their relationship.</P>
<P>Besides, the occasional ecstasy-inspired gems that spew from these nervous
pals; the look and feel of the production rattles with a juicy eye for the
screen. Though, sometimes overdone and/or mis-edited, writer/director Justin
Kerrigan interjects visuals that picturize what his characters are merely
conceptualizing. It's a tactic that David E. Kelley does so well with "Ally
McBeal." Overall, it's energy laden, cleanly-cut and looks good, and (like
Kevin Smith of "Clerks" that later did "Dogma") full of future picture
promise.</P>
<P>Watching stoned people swear is not my idea of a good time, but I did enjoy
the production techniques and the minor relationships between these main
characters and their parents.</P>
<P>In one scene, Muff's father chases him out of the house yelling about
getting a job or something. The camera follows the two as they tear down the
steps, Muff rants on how everyone he knows that has a job hates it and that
he's just "not ready yet to be miserable."</P>
