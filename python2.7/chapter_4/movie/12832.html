<P>Tiffanie DeBartolo, wrote and directed this very charming film.  There is
nothing to indicate that this is her first full-length movie.    Delightful
from start to finish, with a real-life take on young men and women in love,
one would hope that it gets the wide distribution it deserves.</P>
<P>The cast was carefully and wisely chosen.  The lead roles of Frankie (Ione
Skye)  the starry-eyed lady who suddenly falls in love, and  the handsome
David (Mackenzie Astin),  on to the supporting role of Allison (Jennifer
Aniston) who lightens up the screen every time she is on.   Allison is
Frankie's best friend; would that everyone had a best friend such as she.</P>
<P>Then there is Uncle Leo, (Seymour Cassel), who gives Frankie his approval
of David. And who would not?  David is handsome, and everything else a
young woman who is looking for an attachment would want.</P>
<P>Frankie has had a rough few years of never finding "Mr. Right."   Never
wanting a second date because there is always something wrong, she is
overwhelmed at her first sight of David.  How nice, at last.   But right
about when everything appears to be perfect, in walks Molly (Leslie
Stevens) who just happens to be David's  fiancee about whom he has made no
mention to Frankie.</P>
<P>Most women perhaps would have cried and cried and bemoaned their fate. . .
and Frankie does that.   But she also is determined to let David know what
he will be missing if he does not return to her.     With only 2 days left
before she and Allison are to leave for the West Coast for auditions, she
has no time to waste.   Cut to the chase!</P>
