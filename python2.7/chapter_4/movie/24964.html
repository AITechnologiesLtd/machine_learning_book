<P>`But I'm a Cheerleader' so profusely exaggerates its entire premise that the
picture crosses the line from being merely satirical of an already
much-satirized society to being downright stupid. The continuously
hyperbolic nature of the film would be offensive enough to draw complaint
from both homosexuals and heterosexuals but for the fact that such protest
would be dignifying the absurd and thus shedding unneeded light onto what
really amounts to no more than sheer silliness.</P>
<P>Megan (Natasha Lyonne), the captain of her high school's cheerleading squad,
is, on the surface, as spunky yet typical a teen as one could imagine. Her
parents love her and her boyfriend is obsessed with her. But Megan has a
secret that not even she has come to terms with: she is a lesbian. When she
kisses her boyfriend, she thinks of fellow cheerleaders; rather than
loosely-clad guys, her posters feature well-endowed women and when she sees
her pals with little on, her mind wanders into clearly homosexual territory.</P>
<P>Actually, it seems that Megan is the only one who isn't in on her little
secret. Imagine her surprise when her family and friends confront her one
morning and not only explain that they understand her sexual preference
better than her, because they have noticed her Melissa Etheridge posters and
vegetarianism (both, we are told, are clear signs of lesbianism) but that
they are sending her to an expensive, yet highly reputable, program called
`True Directions' to literally straighten her out.</P>
<P>`True Directions' is very much akin to Hollywood's fictional mental
institutions in that it sends a person to your house to pick you up, houses
its occupants in dorm-like buildings with little supervision and features
Clea DuVall (Georgina from `Girl, Interrupted') as its most attractive
female occupant. Like many Hollywood loony-bins, you can tell right off the
bat that the place is full of phonies. RuPaul, out of drag, plays Mike, the
head male counselor (actually, the only male counselor from what we gather).
Mike wears a shirt proclaiming `Straight is Great,' drives a pink van and,
at one point or another, goes through all of the stereotypically gay
movements. Yet, Mike insists that he is `an ex-gay' even though are
suspicions suggest otherwise. Those suspicions are confirmed when he gawks
at another male.</P>
<P>Of course, Mike is merely an example of the filmmaker's message: you are
what you are and nothing can change that. Megan is a lesbian, whether by
genetic predisposition or choice is irrelevant, and she will remain a
lesbian at heart no matter how much propaganda `True Directions' preaches
into her ears.</P>
<P>But it isn't Megan vs. The World or even Megan vs. Goliath – she does have
allies. To begin with, the program's leader makes the mistake of housing a
bunch of teens with raging hormones together – all of whom share the same
sexual preference – and hoping that the simple `no sex' rule will actually
be followed. Ha! Also, aside from her roommates' support, Megan discovers
what she refers to as the `underground homo railroad,' two gay men who
dropped out of the `True Directions' program and, from time to time, take
its current pupils out for a secret night field trip to `Cocksucker,' the
local gay bar. To and fro, they preach anti-conversion – the message that
director Jamie Babbit is clearly endorsing.</P>
<P>Yet, for reasons unbeknownst to this critic, Babbit feels the need to
further ridicule Megan's fictional `True Directions' by making it into the
ultimate stereotype training facility. The girls' dorm is pink, the guys' is
blue. The girls learn housework, the guys study auto-repair. And if the guys
misbehave, they have to spend the whole weekend watching sports. The whole
thing feels like something Lewis Carroll might have written.</P>
<P>The last few scenes of `But I'm a Cheerleader' exercise a set of clichés as
old as pompoms and ridiculous as Will Ferrell and Cheri Oteri's Spartan
Spirit cheerleaders. But hey, given the ridiculous nature of the previous
70-someodd minutes of the film, the cast could have joined arms, formed a
chorus line and pumped out a rendition of `Springtime for Hitler' and I
doubt that anyone would be surprised.</P>
