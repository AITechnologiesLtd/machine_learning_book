<PRE>Welcome to the Dollhouse
directed by Todd Solondz
starring Heather Matarazzo
rated R (mature themes, some strong language)</PRE>
<P>Middle school is the beginning of academic hell for young people.  It is
a difficult experience with other kids verbally maiming other kids
because they are different.  It isn't fun.  However, my middle school
experiences were never as horrific as those of the suburban jeer-target
seventh-grade girl shown here, Dawn "Wiener Dog" Wiener.  Played by
Heather Matarazzo in a near-flawless performance, Dawn is a misfit, an
outcast.  She is the butt of countless jokes because she is, to put it
as simply as one of Dawn's classmates did, "ugly."  She isn't ugly, but
she looks different and that is what spawns the mockery and violence in
this school.  Dawn is disliked/hated by nearly everyone except her
timid, small male friend who is the only other member of her Special
People Club.</P>
<P>The film begins with Dawn trying to find a lunch table to sit at (poor
girl).  She finally ends up at the table occupied by a scruffy-looking
girl who later joins a group of girls who begin to banter Dawn, calling
her a "Lesbo".  Her teachers are no more understanding.  During a test,
a boy sitting next to her named Brandon continually bothers her by
mouthing obscenities.  She raises her hand to get him to stop and the
unjust result is that both of them have after-school detentions.
Whenever Dawn tries to do right, she ends up ruining her life more.
There is a scene at a school assembly where she is the target of an
endless stream of spitballs.  The two boys behind her are performing
this well-known middle school ritual and she plans to keep quiet and
ignore.  She soon busts, as anyone would, and plans to hit them with
spitballs, too.  She ends up hitting a teacher in the eye, resulting in
her near-expulsion and the teacher nearly becoming blind.</P>
<P>Her parents are the pinnacle of movie-parent scum.  They claim to they
love all their children equally but that's basically a load of crap.
Here is a list of their children, in order of how much they love them:
1) Missy, a hopelessly awful young ballerina, 2) Mark, a nerdy teenager
whose only goal is to enrich his college resume, and 3) the loathsome,
unloved Dawn, who refuses to take down her Special People Club House to
make room for her parent's twentieth anniversary in the back yard.  Mark
has formed a garage band (to further adorn his college resume) with the
most popular hunk in high school, a long-haired dude named Steve.  Dawn
immediately falls head-over-heels in love/infatuated with him and plans
to weave a web of niceness towards him to capture him, seduce him.  She
finally gets him alone in her house and fills him up with junk food to
please him.  He is indifferent.  She holds religious prayers in her
bedroom in which she speaks to Steve's ID card (which she stole) in
front of a fire and whispers and chants "You will love me!"</P>
<P>Back at the dreaded inferno of a school, the scruffy girl we saw in the
first scene tells Dawn to leave her man alone- Brandon is hers!!!  The
truth is that Dawn was never pursuing Brandon.  Later, Brandon sets a
date with Dawn to "rape" her and tells her to "BE THERE" and it is
hilarious when she actually turns up to get "raped".  Both of them, I
think, have no knowledge of what the word "rape" actually means so
nothing like that really happens, just mindless smooching.  Turns out,
Brandon and Dawn are falling in love.  And the sparks fly.</P>
<P>Welcome to the Dollhouse has a wonderful, fresh comedy that coats the
infuriating drama of Dawn's middle-school voyage.  This is the perfect
antonym for TV shows and movies that depict middle school as a child's
haven.  Dawn, as Roger Ebert said, will hopefully become famous and
successful and those she was hurt by will be a part of society's
lower-class.  I enjoyed this film because of its honesty (maybe the
horrors of middle school were a bit too dramatized) but I loved it for
its comedy - its satirical derision of all those kids you just hate in
middle school, those kids who hated you.  Here's to the memories of
those years of pre-adolescent suffering.</P>
