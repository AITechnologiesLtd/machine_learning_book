<PRE>                      ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>This review is part one of a series which, in order, includes
ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES, RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES:
THE SEQUEL, and KILLER TOMATOES STRIKE BACK!.</P>
<P>87 min., PG, Comedy, 1978
Director: John De Bello
Cast: David Miller, George Wilson, Sharon Taylor, Jack Riley,
      "Rock" Peace, John De Bello, Ernie Meyers, Ron Shapiro,
      Jerry Anderson, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Robert Matzenauer</P>
<P>     Across the Unites States tomatoes start attacking people.  The
U. S. government forms a special group of "specialists" to go and stop
the tomatoes.  The tomatoes grow in size and threaten the U.S.  The
"specialists" aren't doing the best job.</P>
<P>     ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES could, quite possibly, be the worst
movie ever made, but then again what can you expect from a film that has
the quote "Surely ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES has to be some kind of
camp classic" (H. J. Weeks - ARTWEEK) on the back of the video box.  I
can't recommend this film to anyone, even fans of B movies, which I am.
This is the type of film that gives B movies a bad name.  I doubt this
is any kind of camp classic.  This film was followed by two sequels,
RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES: THE SEQUEL, and KILLER TOMATOES STRIKE
BACK! (and maybe one called KILLER TOMATOES EAT FRANCE).  On a scale of
zero to five, I give ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES a zero (unfortunately
my scale doesn't go any lower).  ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES is rated
PG for explicit language.</P>
<P>     I don't think I can think of anything good about this film.  There
were exactly two scenes which I liked, the master of disguise hanging
out with the tomatoes and the carrot joke.  I laughed three times during
the entire film.  The acting in the film is pathetic.  The
actors/actresses show no talent at all.  The story is horribly written,
and isn't even funny.  At the very least the film could have been
minutely amusing, but it was just stupid.  The idea of tomatoes eating
people is preposterous, they don't have any mouths.  Two big questions
crossed my mind while I was watching this film, "How do the tomatoes
move without any feet?", and "Why am I watching this horrible film?"
Then when the movie was over a third question crossed my mind, "Why did
John De Bello make this film?"  At least I came up with an answer to
that one, obviously he wanted to punish his audience.</P>
