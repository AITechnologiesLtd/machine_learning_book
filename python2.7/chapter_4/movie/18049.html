<P>The influence of Asian cinema on Hollywood has become
increasingly obvious, with directors like John Woo leaving their mark
on the action genre.  Bullets, bodies and blood fly thick and fast in
this brutally exciting action thriller that seamlessly combines the
kinetic energy and violence of the distinctive Hong Kong style of film
making with the slickness of Hollywood.  What is most surprising about
The Corruptor is that this riveting, blood soaked actioner comes from
James Foley, a director best known for his powerful character driven
dramas (At Close Range and After Dark, My Sweet, etc).</P>
<P>The action takes place in New York's colourful Chinatown
district, an area with its own unwritten codes and rules.  Chen
(played by legendary Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat) is a veteran
detective who has policed the streets of Chinatown.  However, a long
time ago he fell under the spell of Uncle Benny (Kim Chan),
Chinatown's unofficial godfather, and has since walked an uneasy
tightrope between his two masters.  A vicious war erupts between the
old style Triads and the new Fukienese Dragons, and the body count
rises.  The heat is suddenly on Chen.  Complicating matters is the
discovery of a series of dead bodies of anonymous young Asian girls in
garbage piles throughout Chinatown.</P>
<P>Enter young Danny Wallace (Mark Wahlberg, from Boogie Nights
and The Big Hit, etc), an idealistic young cop assigned to Chen's task
force.  "You don't change Chinatown; Chinatown changes you," cautions
Chen, who develops an uneasy alliance and grudging respect for his new
partner.</P>
<P>Yun-Fat is at his coolest, laconic best here, and Foley gives
him plenty of opportunities to demonstrate the skills that have made
him so famous.  This is a much more exciting and violent film than The
Replacement Killers, his Hollywood debut, and should please fans of
the genre.  Wahlberg is also quite good here, and holds his own
alongside Yun-Fat.</P>
<P>The Corruptor is over plotted, but Foley doesn't allow the
mechanics of the story to slow the film down or get in the way of the
action.  He directs with bruising efficiency.  The film's undoubted
highlight is a brilliantly staged, breathtakingly exciting car chase
through the streets of New York that exacts a high toll amongst
innocent bystanders and sets new standards for the genre.</P>
<P>Juan Ruiz-Anchia's fluid camerawork and Howard Shore's crisp
editing bring a sense of energy to the film.  The Corruptor certainly
crams a lot into its incredibly taut and tight 110 minutes.</P>
<PRE>****
