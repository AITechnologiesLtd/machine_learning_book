<P>        I just don't understand why Bruce Willis lends his talents to films as
bland and uninspired as Mercury Rising.  It seems like every film he
does is just another action film, designed to fade from memory almost
immediately after viewing.  I, for one, think he's a terrific actor (see
Mortal Thoughts if you don't believe me).  And he can do a great job,
even in generic, formulaic action films like this one.  But action films
as great as Die Hard come around about once a decade, and so my advice
to Mr. Willis is as follows:  move into another genre (and do it
fast!).  </P>
<P>        In Mercury Rising, he plays Art Jeffries, a lonely FBI agent who
normally works undercover, but is forced into more menial jobs such as
wire tapping after the introductory-action sequence ends in the needless
death of five militia men.  Skip ahead a few days, and we meet young
Simon (Miko Hughes), an autistic boy who cracks a government supercode
hidden in a puzzle magazine.  The head of the operation that uses this
special code is a man named Kudrow (Alec Baldwin), and he tries to have
Simon and his family executed.  Naturally, the parents bite it early,
but Simon lives long enough for Jeffries to find him and take care of
him.</P>
<P>        Mercury Rising is straight formula, played with poker-face stiffness by
director Harold Becker.  It has all the familiar scenes, such as the
intro scene that proves our hero is really committed to his job, and the
windy climax at the top of a building, where the lives of three or four
individuals are dangling off the edge.  There's barely an original
moment in this film:  everything from the setup to the conclusion is
predictable and stale, and is made watchable only by the performers.</P>
<P>        Willis, as I stated, is a great actor, and he's good here.  I liked the
fact that he isn't just another burn-out cop, but that he is actually a
pretty level-headed individual.  Some of the scenes are fuelled by
Willis' charismatic performance, such as the opening scene (which is
actually very intense, despite its predictable outcome and purpose). 
Miko Hughes also does a pretty good job of playing the autistic kid,
although I would have preferred that the autism been given more thought
and not just been used as a plot hook.  Baldwin is good as the bad guy,
but like all action-film bad guys, he's not very human, and present just
to serve the story.   </P>
<P>        Some of the stuff in this film is downright absurd.  There's a subplot
involving a woman, Stacey (Kim Dickens), who Jeffries literally meets on
the street somewhere.  He asks her to take care of Simon for a few
minutes, and she agrees.  Later, he shows up at her house and demands
more babysitting.  The plausibility problems with this situation could
have been instantly solved by making Stacey a woman that Jeffries knew
beforehand.  And everything about the government code is silly:  the
technicians explain why they placed the code in the puzzle book, but it
still doesn't make much sense.  And what does the code do, anyway? 
Well, we're told that it protects the identities of important
individuals, but how or why is never explained.  </P>
<P>        And I might have been able to overlook these things, had the story been
more original.  But it's not.  Mercury Rising fits the far-too-familiar
action film template down to the last detail, and the result is an
uninspired, forgettable movie that, in the end, is only worth watching
for Bruce Willis' unwavering conviction for his roles.  This is just
another entry in a big pile of films that he's too good to be in.</P>
