<PRE>HAPPINESS (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>

Starring: Dylan Baker, Cynthia Stevenson, Jane Adams, Lara Flynn Boyle,
Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rufus Read, Camryn Manheim, Louise Lasser, Ben
Gazzara, Jared Harris, Elizabeth Ashley, Jon Lovitz, Dan Moran, Evan
Silverberg, Marla Maples, Molly Shannon</P>
<P>Like a god, Todd Solandz circles around his characters in "Happiness,"
as if he were spinning some wheel where each of the major characters
were represented, and then stops on one and fills us in on their lives.
They all have two things in common: they're all, to some degree,
unhappy; and in some way, they all get what they desire most of all by
the end of the movie.  Each of them harbor dark, deep secrets, and the
materialization of each of them is the subject of this film.  Meanwhile,
round and round the film goes, stopping on each of the characters, and
when he does, we see them as they really are, without any filter, their
souls bare naked for the screen to behold and for Solandz and the rest
of us to judge them.</P>
<P>Yet he doesn't, and neither do we, and that's probably the most
refreshing thing about this film, amongst a pile of other refreshing
things this film has to offer any audience that will have it.  Back in
1996, the very same director shocked audiences with his film, "Welcome
to the Dollhouse," a black comedy about a junior high girl who was the
biggest dork in her class.  That film bordered on sadistic at times, but
still retained a quiet, observant, yet very funny atmosphere.  I think
the amazing thing about Solandz is that his view is not only hysterical
and witty, but walks right up to the line dictating which side is
sensible and reserved, and which side is flat out pretentious
down-talking.  And he doesn't trip over it.</P>
<P>In "Happiness," we meet a wide array of interesting and realistic
people, all with subconscious problems they are trying to deal with.  At
the center of the film are three sisters, though they aren't the primary
specimens, but merely the key to why these people are connected -
there's Trish (Cynthia Stevenson), the one with the perfect family,
perfect husband, and perfect suburban life; Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle),
the gorgeously sophistocated one with a major writing career who
nevertheless feels shallow and hates her work; and Joy (Jane Adams), a
naive, almost vapid songstress who is pure and sweet, but in the very
first scene, dumps her current boyfriend (a shockingly hilarious and
even intense Jon Lovitz), and it's probably because he's an ugly dead
end.  He takes it sadly at first, then tries to make uncomfortably comic
conversation, giving her a present he was going to give her later on: a
specially-engraved, beautiful ashtray (she says "It almost makes me want
to learn how to smoke.").  He then shocks her by pulling it away from
her, saying that it's not for her but for the one who loves him for who
he is, not what he looks like.</P>
<P>While Joy takes a job working as a substitute for on-strike
english-as-a-second-language teacher (they refer to her as a "scab"), we
get to know everyone else, and discover their little idosyncrasies.  We
meet a man named Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman, who was brilliant in
"Boogie Nights" as the boom mike operator with a crush on Marky Mark), a
boring office worker, a mouth breather who masturbates while making
obscene phone calls to women.  He's currently lusting over Helen, who
lives next door to him in his apartment building, though another woman
in his building, Kristina (Camryn Manheim, who just won an Emmy for her
acting on the TV show, "The Practice"), gets a crush on him, even though
she has very low self esteem herself.</P>
<P>Most shockingly, though, we meet Trish's husband, Bill (Dylan Baker), a
psychiatrist, namely Allen's psychiatrist, who urges him to tell him all
his sexual fantasies, but himself, keeps having a recurring dream where
he walks into a gorgeous park on a sunny day with a machine gun.  He's
the perfect husband, though, or at least in Trish's eye, but in one of
the first scenes of the movie, he goes to a gas station, buys a Teen
Beat magazine, climbs into the back seat of his car, and jacks off to
the pictures.</P>
<P>And down in Florida, the parents of the three sisters, Mona and Lenny
(Louise Lasser and Ben Gazzara, the former who has not at all aged
well), who've been married for decades, are splitting up because for the
first time in his life, Lenny wants to be alone.  Although Lenny denies
it has anything to do with wanting to be with other women, this still
drives Mona to re-evaluate her life, and maybe come to terms with the
idea that, as the local realtor she talks to (Marla Maples - !!!) says,
divorce may be the best thing that ever happens to her.</P>
<P>Once all these characters are introduced, Solandz, like a genie, grants
all of them their wishes.  When Allen calls Helen and does his usual
schtick, she shocks him by replying with "I want to meet you."  Lenny
gets the separation, and finds he has attracted the come-ons of a
neighbor of his (Elizabeth Ashley).  Joy meets a Russian cab driver
named Vlad (Jared Harris) in her class, and he woos her by playing an
absolutely riot-inducing cover of "You Light Up My Life" one night at
her house (the joke is that it works).  Most unsettling of all, Bill
gets a crush on one of his son's friends, organizes a sleepover for the
two, and in a scene that is eerily comic in its enactment, Bill attempts
to drug the family and the boy, and then have his way with him...though
it hardly goes as planned.</P>
<P>"Happiness" is an unsettling shocker, filled with insights about
humanity and our internal desire to be happy at all costs, and set up
around scenes that are created to shock the audience.  Cum shots (in
fact, 2 or 3 of them).  Pedophilia (though it is never seen on screen).
Even Bill's numerous discussions with his son (Rufus Read) about sexual
awakening, including frank conversations about masturbation, which come
off as creepy as anything this year (I just thank my dad for not having
these discussions with me when I was growing up).  One would think
Solandz would take advantage of these people, make them fodder for some
kind of satirical insight into humanity.</P>
<P>But he doesn't.  Solandz keeps a droll but distanced view on all of
them, not at all judging them for what they do, and sympathizing with
them enough that they come off as human beings but not too much that his
depictions become clouded.  There's no main character, and there's no
real narrative voice other than his own.  He never looks down on these
people for being evil or unhappy or whatever, but merely sees them for
what they are: people struggling to become happy.</P>
<P>Solandz's tone is reserved, but he still allows tons of comedy to seep
through.  His scenes have a curious and wicked detachment, and his
characters are human enough to be funny most of the time.  He shows he's
a master of pop culture skewering by taking the horrible 80s Air Supply
song "I'm All Out of Love" and turning it into a hilarious love song,
then laces it with a curious sweetness I didn't think he was possible of
before this movie.  Though his characters are humorously drawn, he still
manages to make them human, though, which may be the film's strongest
aspect.  Despite their shortcomings and wonton desires, they're all
still seen as people like you and me, struggling with the usual
problems, and with the same ideals as all of us.</P>
<P>The acting by everyone is incredible, and it's hard to single anyone out
totally as the best.  Jane Adams, though, does the best job out of the
sisters, making her naive Joy into a gentle and lovable creature, and
Philip Seymour Hoffman and Camryn Manheim perform wonderfully in their
respective roles as two people who may or may not find love if they can
only get over themselves and their own insecurities (not to mention
pasts).  Dylan Baker has the toughest job, and his performance as the
pedophilic husband is perhaps the most moving of the year.  He dares to
make him a human being, and manages to make his desire to succumb to his
weakness one of the easiest to relate to, even if we're not relating to
his own personal desire.  Everything's worth it just for that scene
where he has a wrenching heart-to-heart with his son towards the end,
where he lets all the truth pour out without any filter.  This guy's so
good that if this suddenly became a huge hit, he'd come down with
Anthony Perkins disease, and never work again, at least not notably.</P>
<P>Although "Happiness" is a rather unnerrving experience to watch, it's
nevertheless essential to view because out of all the films I've seen
this year, this may be the most truthful about humanity (and I know I've
said that at least once this year), and may be the most shockingly
disturbing.  You walk out with mixed feelings: you enjoyed it, but then
again, you kinda didn't.  But its strength lies in the fact that it
admits to not knowing what happiness is, but rather that it at least
knows that happiness is not getting what you most desire.</P>
