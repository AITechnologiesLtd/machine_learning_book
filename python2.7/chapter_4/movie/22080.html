<P>---Starting on Christmas Eve you can hear Mac VerStandig's movie reviews 
on the radio in Portland, Maine once a week in addition to reading them 
on Moviereviews.org. Details on time and dial placement still to come. 
Stay tuned!---</P>
<P>Liberty Heights, Barry Levinson's fourth Baltimore-based film (following 
Diner, Tin Men and Avalon), is not only one of the director's stronger 
works but one of the best films of 1999.</P>
<P>It is 1954 and that means McCarthy is on television, the Second World 
War has been over for nine years, schools are being integrated and a 
noise-pollution called "Rock and Roll" is replacing Frank Sinatra in the 
eyes of American youth. In Liberty Heights we see how these changes 
affect the rich panoply of characters that Barry Levinson has created.</P>
<P>Ben (Ben Foster) is a young Jewish teenager who recalls eating at a 
friend's house when he was little and wondering what a "lunch meat" is 
and why everything is "all white." But then Ben makes a startling 
discovery about the non-Jewish population, "the other kind is about 99% 
of the world." During the year that this movie covers, Ben will find 
himself living in the new when he dresses as Adolf Hitler for Halloween; 
becomes friendly with Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson), an African American girl 
in his class and becomes an instant fan of an up-and-coming rock and 
roll artist named James Brown. But not even Ben is a full-fledged 
convert as he refuses to leave a car during a Frank Sinatra song out of 
respect for The Chairmen of the Board. Ben's older brother, Van (Adrien 
Brody), also ventures into the 1950's full force when he develops a 
fierce crush on a blond-over-blue gentile girl at a Halloween party.</P>
<P>Ben and Van's family is soon turned upside down as a conservative 
mother, father and grandmother protest the brothers' ultra-liberal 
actions. Ada (Bebe Neuwirth who gives the most delicious yet small 
performance in a film filled with mouth-watering acting), the boys' 
mother, responds to Ben's attraction to Sylvia by exclaiming "Just kill 
me now!" Nate (Joe Montegna), the boys' honest and moral father (which 
says a lot about a man who runs the local numbers bracket) who drives 
the year's Cadillac, is firm in his position of keeping Ben home so that 
he won't trick-or-treat dressed as the Great Dictator. And the whole 
family goes at it in discussions of how the Bible should be interpreted 
and whether or not McCarthy is on a witch hunt.</P>
<P>Today, people continually grown about the presence of liquor, racism and 
fighting among youth. Liberty Heights offers a refreshing reminder that 
this is nothing new. Van's dream girl carries a booze-filled paper bag, 
Ben's friend Yussel fights for his religion and racially based slander 
is sprinkled all about the 1950's film.</P>
<P>Liberty Heights avoids the heavy drama that most studies of society 
carry and instead offers a light wit that is oftentimes funny. One of 
the more uproarious and memorable scenes centers around Van's curiosity 
of the legal system and his decision to answer "no" when asked to swear 
to the truth. The scene isn't out of place nor does it seem as 
controversial as a similar moment in The People Vs. Larry Flynt; it is a 
moment that is humorous for the purposes of developing Van's character 
and fits in the film with ease.</P>
<P>The movie's exploration of various music forms in the 1950's allows for 
an extraordinary soundtrack. Highlights include James Brown, Tony 
Bennett, Ray Charles, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Louis Armstrong, 
Perry Como and Frank Sinatra.</P>
<P>Being released in the prime of Best Picture season, Liberty Heights will 
likely find itself under a particularly strong microscope. The first 
question asked by Hollywood tends to be one questioning a film's flaws. 
Well, this critic only discovered one where a reference to the movie 
Marty is made on Halloween, 1954, before the 1955 Best Picture's 
release. Other than that singular nitpicking, Liberty Heights can expect 
smooth sailing down the river from its theatrical release to Oscar night 
to its video release.  </P>
