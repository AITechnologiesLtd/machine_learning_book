<P>"Atlantis: The Lost Empire," Walt Disney Pictures' latest summer animated 
feature, is a step away from their usual cartoon offerings. In place of cute, 
furry, wise-cracking animals and a stream of pop songs is an old-fashioned 
adventure yarn with the only appearance of an animal coming in the form of 
the hero's meowing pet cat. None of the characters break into song, and the 
legend that the story is based on comes from the words of ancient philosopher 
Plato. The film is rated PG, as well, and has one character who chain-smokes 
throughout. It's pretty safe to say that "Atlantis" is most certainly not the 
movie you've grown to expect from the Disney studio, and that isn't 
necessarily a bad thing.</P>
<P>Set in 1914, Lanky Milo Thatcher (Michael J. Fox) is a Washington, D.C. 
native whose linguistic skills have helped him to get a job from the local 
university. Obsessed with the legend of the lost city of Atlantis, which is 
said to have been engulfed into the sea thousands of years ago, Milo is 
delighted to be asked to participate in an expedition in search of the 
underwater ruins. Following a disastrous encounter with a giant sea creature 
that leaves their submarine destroyed and much of the crew dead, the 
remaining members are taken aback to finally reach Atlantis, and just a 
little surprised to find an entire Atlantian society that has mysteriously 
survived after all these years. Striking up a friendship with Princess Kida 
(Cree Summer), who, in turn, tell each other about their separate ways of 
living, Milo is distraught to find that the rest of his crew, most notably 
Commander Rourke (James Garner) and Helga (Claudia Christian), are planning 
to make a ton of money off their discovery, with little regard to the people 
of Atlantis.</P>
<P>While "Atlantis: The Lost Empire," directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise 
(1991's "Beauty and the Beast"), is a remarkably more mature, adult-minded 
Disney film than the norm, it fails to go down as one of their more 
successful contemporary features. Lacking the pure entertainment value of 
1999's "Tarzan," 1994's "The Lion King," and 1989's "The Little Mermaid," 
"Atlantis" is deliberately paced and not nearly as child-friendly, although 
kids will, no doubt, enjoy it. It's a good movie, to be sure, and one with 
several rousing action scenes, but it lacks that something--that 
finesse--that all of the best Disney movies have attained.</P>
<P>Even if "Atlantis" isn't terribly memorable, it does set up several 
interesting characters and relationships. The gradual romance between Milo 
and Kida is understated and charming, with both Michael J. Fox and Cree 
Summer turning in emotionally involving voice work. It isn't love at first 
sight for this pair, and they don't predictably spend the whole movie making 
goo-goo eyes at each other. Instead, they are intelligent people with their 
own ideas and thoughts. Also standing out are Sweet (Phil Morris), a muscular 
doctor who is a softy at heart (and the first black character to appear in a 
Disney animated movie); Cookie, a very bad cook who means well, and is 
poignantly voiced by the late, great Jim Varney; and the street-smart, 
teenage mechanic, Audrey (Jacqueline Obradors).</P>
<P>The animation style that "Atlantis" uses is fairly conventional, but it works 
within the confines of this particular story. While the majority of what is 
onscreen is hand-drawn, there are occasional lapses into computer-generated 
territory, with just a hint of anime influence. "Atlantis" is not quite as 
bold or redefining as it would like to be, particularly in the shadow of the 
superlative "Shrek," but it does succeed in not seeming like a movie strictly 
made for children. More along the lines of 2000's "Titan A.E." than anything 
else, "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" is a worthwhile venture that may not go 
down as a modern animated classic, but it does expose Disney as a studio more 
than willing to break free of tradition and try something a little different, 
for once. It's about time.</P>
