<PRE>GO
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * 1/2 out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Documenting the wild and unbelievable events  that happen to a
collection of twentysomethings and teens in Los Angeles, the exuberant
movie, Go, is a film that doesn't feel original, yet sure is fun to
watch.</P>
<P>The film intertwines three stories over one fateful Christmas Eve. The
first revolves around grocery store clerk Ronna (Sarah Polley).  She  is
about to be evicted from her apartment, unless she can come up with  the
necessary money in the next 24 hours.  Hope comes in the form of two
bickering actors (Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr), who are looking to score
some ecstasy for an all-night rave.  Ronna decides to do this one time
drug deal for some quick cash...but quickly gets in over her head.</P>
<P>The second storyline follows four thrillseekers (including Desmond
Askew, Taye Diggs, and Breckin Meyer) on a Christmas trip to Vegas.  The
twenty-four hours that follow seem to spring from both their wildest
fantasies and nightmares.</P>
<P>The final story brings back elements of the first two, as the
aforementioned actors, Adam and Zack have their own set of
misadventures.  Primarily, they center around the duo's run-in with a
mysteriously eccentric character, Burke (William Fichtner). But the
story launches from there to tie in elements of the other two plotlines
as well.</P>
<P>It's impossible to watch Go without thinking about Pulp Fiction, but at
least in this instance, the comparison is favorable.  Both films tell an
anthology of stories, with titles preceding each one, and a non-linear
chronological structure.  But whereas Pulp Fiction was about criminals
who were shockingly acting like normal people, Go is rather about normal
people who are shockingly acting like criminals.</P>
<P>One thing that sets Go apart from the pack is the acting.  From the
leads, down to the supporting members, each actor has been flawlessly
cast.  However, Sarah Polley certainly stands above the crowd. From The
Sweet Hereafter to her performance here, she is proving herself one of
the most talented actresses of her generation.  Another great
performance comes from William Fichtner (another Pulp Fiction nod), who
gives the film a fine, creepy supporting performance.</P>
<P>The plot of Go is well written, and is able to stand on its own, even
without the borrowed structural gimmick.  The dialogue is sharp and
lively, and there are plenty of twists and turns to keep everyone on
their toes.</P>
<P>The intelligence of the script, the director and the actors allows Go to
rise above the level of a simple copycat picture.  Funny, shocking and
overall entertaining, Go delivers.</P>
