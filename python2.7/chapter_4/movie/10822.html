<P>Studio expectations must not have been high for "Great Expectations" -- 
the film's release date was pushed from late December to late January at 
what appeared to be the last minute, therefore putting any Academy 
Awards chances it has off until this time in 1999. It's actually a smart 
move, because while this updated take on the Charles Dickens tale isn't 
quite Oscar fodder, it *is* strong enough to be distinguished from the 
cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six 
weeks of any given year. "Great Expectations" also demonstrates how to 
modernize a classic story right, especially after the excruciatingly 
wretched excesses of Baz Luhrmann's "William Shakespeare's Romeo + 
Juliet." </P>
<P>"Great Expectations" opens somewhere in 1970s Florida (the original 
story is set in 19th-century England), as eight-year-old Finn (Jeremy 
James Kissner) meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on 
his life in the future. There's icy, 11-year-old Estella (Raquel 
Beaudene), a pseudo-playmate of Finn's; Ms. Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft), 
Estella's auntie who's quite off-kilter over a past romance that never 
took off; and a mysterious prisoner (Robert De Niro) whom Finn saves the 
life of. Finn, who lives with his sister's affable boyfriend (Lone 
Star's Chris Cooper), fancies himself an aspiring artist, and proves his 
prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of Estella using only Ms. 
Dinsmoor's lipstick, eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her 
dilapidating mansion. </P>
<P>Flash forward into the '90s (after a brief stop in the '80s), and Finn 
(now played by Ethan Hawke), despondent over a strange hot-and-cold 
relationship with the elusive Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow), receives quite 
a bit of money from an unknown benefactor; it's enough cash to send him 
to New York to focus on a career in art. There, Finn seems to gain 
everything he could ever want -- wealth, prestige and a high place in 
the glamorous art world. When Estella resurfaces -- albeit with an aloof 
fiancé (Hank Azaria) -- Finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual 
attraction. But she's not the only ghost from Finn's past that's going 
to be paying him a visit. </P>
<P>Comparisons with the afore-mentioned "Romeo + Juliet" seem inevitable 
since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic 
drama into a current setting. "Great Expectations" is a much better 
venture, though, because it treats its source with even-handed respect, 
where "Romeo" was never quite sure whether to be a spoof, a homage or 
both. The movie is a visual banquet thanks to Emmanuel Lubezki's sexy 
cinematography; notably, he captures a revisited fountain kiss between 
the two leads with a luscious, erotic charge that's steamier than the 
film's (surprisingly muted) love scenes. The eclectic rock soundtrack 
compliments the on-screen action beautifully, especially new songs by 
Tori Amos, Mono and Duncan Sheik. </P>
<P>Acting credits are first-rate, often hiding the screenplay's occasional 
slip-ups. Hawke is sincere and solid as a leading man (something we also 
learned from "Gattaca"), and his Finn is quite a likeable guy. Paltrow's 
Estella, on the other hand, is rather underdeveloped. While the actress 
is at her icily seductive best, we're not told very much about her 
character, and as a result, it's often hard to understand why Finn would 
appreciate her beyond a physical level (but, oh, *what* a physical 
level); sometimes, we root for Finn although we don't quite understand 
why she's fueling his fire. Robert De Niro is nice and sophisticated in 
the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play; on the other end of 
the acting spectrum is Bancroft, a macabre, throaty delight who mambos 
and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make Norma 
Desmond jealous. </P>
<P>Alfonso Cuaron's visually elegant direction helps to distract from the 
dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie's climax. 
Another problem is predictability; you can guess your way through the 
plot even if you aren't familiar with the story. Despite its script 
flaws, though, "Great Expectations" is undeniably romantic without being 
corny or gloppy. And frankly, it's nice to see a film that embraces 
softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality. Perhaps that 
renovated release date, awfully close to Valentine's Day, will end up 
helping "Great Expectations"' seemingly average box office chances after 
all. </P>
