The Object of My Affection (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>a review by Christian Pyle</PRE>
<P>Playwright Wendy Wasserstein's first screenplay to be produced (based on a
novel by Stephen McCauley) raises intriguing questions about love and the
various forms in which it comes.  At the center of a very amusing array of
characters are roommates George (Paul Rudd) and Nina (Jennifer Aniston). 
George is gay and has just been dumped when he moves in with Nina.  Nina is
dating Vince (John Pankow of "Mad About You"), an overbearing socialist lawyer.
 George and Nina become close friends quickly, leading Nina to hope that they
might become more than friends.  When she becomes pregnant, Nina persuades
George that they should raise the baby together.
        So can a straight woman and a gay man make a go of it?  "The Object of My
Affection" is too smart a film to let Nina off so easy.  She harbors a secret
fantasy, of course, that George will "convert" for her, and she has to suffer
through a series of disappointments before she sees how hopeless that fantasy
is.
        The real charm of the movie is the parade of supporting characters that
Wasserstein uses to broaden and complicate the questions she raises about love.
 These characters include George's conceited ex (Tim Daly of "Wings"), Nina's
stepsister and her bigwig husband (Allison Janney, Alan Alda), George's new
beau Paul (Amo Gulinello), Paul's lovesick mentor Rodney (Nigel Hawthorne),
George's womanizing brother (Steve Zahn), and a nice cop who gives Nina a ride
home (Kevin Carroll).  All these folks are seeking love; a few are in love with
themselves.
        The weak point in this movie is the acting of Jennifer Aniston.  Since Nina's
dreams and disappointments are the focus of "Object," Aniston has to carry more
of the acting load than anyone else, and she is horribly inadequate.  As far as
Aniston is concerned, this might as well be an episode of "Friends" because
there seems to be little difference between Nina and Rachel, Aniston's TV
character.  Aniston's inability to rise to the challenge sinks the movie and
keeps a sharp script from achieving its full potential.
        There's still pleasure to be had, though, by watching the rest of the cast
work.  Rudd does a fine job of portraying the conflicted George, who wants to
be a father to Nina's baby but cannot deny who he is to please her.  Hawthorne
also stands out; he gives a rich and subtle performance as a drama critic
infatuated with Paul, who is young enough to be his grandson.  (Bit of trivia: 
"Object" was directed by Nicholas Hytner, who also directed Hawthorne's
breakthrough film, "The Madness of King George.")   Pankow was surprisingly
good; now that his TV series is retiring, I hope we'll see more of him on the
big screen.</P>
