<P>     Sometimes there is no better demonstration of a concept poorly
executed than the same concept well executed. Take TUMBLEWEEDS, for
instance. It's the story of a Mary Jo Walker (Janet McTeer), a flighty and
frequently irresponsible woman, and her smart-aleck adolescent daughter
Ava (Kimberly J. Brown), who cringes at her mother's suspect 
decision-making. After the collapse of Mary Jo's latest bad marriage,
mother and daughter jump in their car and flee their home for greener
pastures, eventually landing in Southern California (the San Diego suburb
of Starlight Beach, to be precise). Ava tries to make the best of the
situation and find some stability, but Mary Jo simply jumps headlong into
another questionable relationship, this time with gruff trucker Jack
(co-writer/director Gavin O'Connor).</P>
<P>     Sound familiar? It should -- the plot is virtually identical to that
of the current Susan Sarandon/Natalie Portman film ANYWHERE BUT HERE. Of
course there are elements unique to each central relationship, and there
are idiosyncrasies in the personalities of the lead characters.
Essentially, however, each film is the story of a mother/daughter
friendship where the maturity hierarchy has been inverted, set against the
backdrop of the California sun. TUMBLEWEEDS just happens to be a rich
character study that feels genuinely human, instead of like a Hollywood
construct.</P>
<P>     It doesn't start out looking that way. The early scenes find Mary Jo
and Ava flinging their clothes out the car window in an act of liberating
littering, and tracking down an old high school classmate of Mary Jo's who
turns out to be less dreamy than she had hoped. The wacky set pieces smack
of contrivance, turning TUMBLEWEEDS into a low-budget variation on
mainstream tales of female bonding. Even the hand-held camera work starts
to seem more like a contrivance than a tool to evoke a sense of urgency
The very grittiness O'Connor is aiming for becomes just another brand of
glossiness.</P>
<P>     Then, right about the time the Walkers arrive in Starlight Beach,
something just clicks. Newcomer Kimberly J. Brown's performance as Ava,
which had seemed too rough around the edges, develops into something
intriguing and unique, not at all the typical mature-beyond-her-years,
foul-mouthed-beyond-prime-time movie kid. Janet McTeer's brassy Mary Jo
similarly blossoms into a character easy to understand but considerably
harder to pin down. The relationship between the two shows all the twists,
turns and knots of a complex mother/daughter pairing, but there's never a
sense of manufactured conflict. These people behave like real people;
their battles don't sound scripted, and their interdependent affection is
thoroughly convincing.</P>
<P>     Brown and McTeer are both pretty darned good, but the reason
TUMBLEWEEDS starts to work so well is that O'Connor doesn't force the
story to rest entirely on their shoulders. ANYWHERE BUT HERE was a
mother/daughter story in which the mother and daughter sometimes seemed to
be the only two humans in the city; TUMBLEWEEDS develops the characters
through their interactions with friends and co-workers. Ava's flirtations
with a goofy classmate show an edgy side to her emerging sexuality; Mary
Jo's scenes with Jack show her tendency to use men as a prop in her life,
as well as her problems dealing rationally with disagreements (similarly
shown in her abrupt departure from a mundane job). TUMBLEWEEDS gives its
two central characters a context in which to operate, something sadly
lacking in ANYWHERE BUT HERE. Verisimilitude isn't necessary for every
kind of film, but it's fairly useful in a character study. In TUMBLEWEEDS,
Gavin O'Connor effectively portrays a mother and daughter trying to find
their way in the world, because he effectively portrays their world.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 tumblin' tumbleweeds:  7.</PRE>
