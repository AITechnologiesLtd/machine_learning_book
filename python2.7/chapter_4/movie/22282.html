<P>There are 20 James Bond movies counting 'The World Is Not Enough'.  Sean
Connery certainly has been the best Bond.  In fact, not a single
disagreement has come up when I discuss this with other people.  Connery's
combination of rugged timing, the smooth delivery of his lines and his
ability to woo women make him the ultimate lover AND fighter.  As the 20th
century closes out shortly, here's how the Bond franchise breaks down and
the actors who have played him.</P>

<P>You can even say there are 21 Bond films if you count 1967's 'Casino
Royale'.</P>
<P>'The World Is Not Enough' is vintage James Bond.  It resembles the old days
when Bond movies had great sub plots and a diverse number of characters,
including the variety of beautiful women who have been central to the plot.
Since the Bond films have resembled romance novels, comic books, car ads,
travel brochures and liquor spots, you would think that enough is enough.
But the films are addictive.  They are alluring to the most avid movie fan
and while some have failed in recent memory, such as the badly edited and
music style video presentation of 'Tomorrow Never Dies', it is always fun to
see how bad or good the next one will be.</P>
<P>Terrorism and revenge are the ingredients in 'The World Is Not Enough'.
James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) becomes involved with a beautiful socialite
named Elektra King (Sophie Marceau in a surprisingly good performance) who
wants to build a large pipeline across Asia and needs protection from having
it destroyed by her rivals.  Bond also locks horns with a terrorist named
Renard (Robert Carlyle, the skinny stripper with the son in 'The Full
Monty') who has a bullet lodged in his brain which is slowly killing him.
But for now, he has lost a couple of his senses, including the sense of
touch which makes him seemingly invincible since he can't feel pain.  There
is also a nuclear scientist named Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) who
is the film's most annoying character and couldn't possibly survive
physically in the real world but manages to hold her own with Bond in the
movies.</P>
<P>Elektra was kidnapped by Renard many years ago and has a past with him.  She
was sort of brain washed and mentally drawn to him by the whole ordeal and
her loyalty may or not be to him as Bond finds out throughout the course of
the film.  A lot of intriguing thrillers have a complicated plot not easy to
follow and this James Bond installment has many cleverly interwoven plots
and sub plots with stories all on a collision course with one another.  It's
the best Bond film I've seen since 1983's 'Octopussy' which was the best one
featuring Roger Moore.</P>
<P>Other characters who return are "M" (Judi Dench), "Q" (Desmond Llewelyn).
Replacing "Q", who is retiring, is "R" (John Cleese, and he serves up the
gimmicks this time which are the contraptions that save Bond when he gets
into a jam.  Some of them this time are quite ingenious from any other
gadgets we've seen in a very long while.</P>
<P>Directed by the under rated Michael Apted and written by Neil Purvis, Robert
Wade and Bruce Feirstein, 'The World Is Not Enough' has good character
development, funny moments and all the trappings of early Bond.  In fact,
those who may not have seen one in over thirty years would never know how
diverse the series has been by viewing this one now.  It's a return to its
original roots.</P>
