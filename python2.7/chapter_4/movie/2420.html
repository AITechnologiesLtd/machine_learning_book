<PRE>"Mr. Taft is the patron saint of the impossible."
                                - Michael Caine, speaking of
                                  Seagal's character</PRE>
<P>     ON DEADLY GROUND proves, without a doubt, that Steven Seagal
directs as badly as he acts.  This environmental actioner is p.u. from
the word g.o. and even co-star Michael Caine, aka Mr.  Will Act For
Food, can't help defuse this bomb.</P>
<P>     The plot is some superior nonsense about a nasty oil mangate
(Caine) and the Bad Things he's planning for the pristine Alaskan
wilderness.  Eskimo environmentalists want him stopped--but they have
no power.  Or hero.  Until the company's head firefighter, Forrest Taft
(Seagal), enters the picture.</P>
<P>     When Taft gets wind of his boss's *real* plans, The Ponytail takes
an armed stance against his employer.  They try to kill him, he tries
to kill them, and it all wraps up with Seagal on a soapbox.</P>
<P>     Pay attention to the opening scene--the first clue that Seagal
doesn't have one--and you have still have time to ask for your money
back.</P>
<P>     At the beginning, Taft arrives in Alaska to "blow out" a "well"
fire.  Yes, a "well" fire!  Anyone who's seen HELLFIGHERS knows that
you can't get much more exciting than this.  But, believe or it not,
Seagal sieves the action right out of this explosive situation.</P>
<PRE>     And he does this for the *entire* film.</PRE>
<P>     His "back up" is fine--production designer Wm. Ladd Skinner,
cinematographer Ric Waite, composer Basil Poledouris--but even *they*
can't compensate for dingbat direction.  With a poorly staged scene, who
cares about Skinner's authentic-looking Eskimo village?  Or Waite's
almost-unreal Alaskan photography?  Or Poledouris energized score?</P>
<P>     Seagal even botches the obligatory bar-fight.  Instead of anything
resembling choreography, he resorts to silly slow-motion to punctuate
his punches.</P>
<P>     The Big Shoot Out is the Big Disappointment.  Even after a middling
midsection, one still hopes for a rousing round-up of John Woo
proportions.  Sorry Charlie, no Grand Guignol here.  Just a sloppy mix
of bullets and bad-guys and immolations and explosions and 101 Other
Ways For Bad People To Die.  Hardly the right reward for having to sit
through Eskimo subtitles, R.  Lee Emery's crewcut, and Steven Seagal
trying to be Kevin Costner.</P>
<P>     Even with a "real" director, ON DEADLY GROUND is still a tough
sell.  Seagal seems to have lost his charisma (there's a relative term,
if there ever was one!); certain supporting players are downright
awful; and the plot has more holes than a bad Schwarzenegger story.</P>
<P>     And, just when you think you can't "stands no more," Seagal wraps
this stinky cheese with a five-minute (cut from fifteen!) environmental
speech complete with stomach-turning footage.</P>
<PRE>     Why didn't he do a documentary, instead?</PRE>
<PRE>Bottom line:     ON DEADLY GROUND is an awful film.  The bad direction
                 is courtesy of Steven Seagal, who graciously
                 contributes to the bad acting.  Even Michael Caine
                 looks good in comparison.  Do yourself a favor and
                 rent HARD TARGET.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: F</PRE>
