<P>BABE: PIG IN THE CITY
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: *** (out of ****)
Universal / 1:32 / 1998 / G (but contains scary scenes and scantily clad 
chicks nonetheless)
Cast: Magda Szubanski; James Cromwell; Mary Stein; Mickey Rooney 
Vocal Cast: E.G. Daily; Gleanne Headly; Steven Wright; James Cosmo; 
Stanley Ralph Ross; Danny Mann; Roscoe Lee Browne; Adam Goldberg 
Director: George Miller 
Screenplay: George Miller; Mark Lamprell; Judy Morris <HR>"Babe: Pig in the City" is to "Babe" as chitlins are to sausage - same 
source, completely different by-product. The 1995 original, the tale of 
a talking pig who overcame prejudice by winning a sheepherding 
competition, was bright and sunny and relentlessly enchanting; this 
eagerly-anticipated follow-up still has the enchantment, but trades in 
its prequel's pastel-colored storybook glow and rosy barnyard menagerie 
for an exceedingly dark and edgy tone, quite an alarming (though not 
unagreeable) surprise for a children's feature. </P>
<P>This "Babe" picks up with the titular porker leading a peaceful 
existence on the serene country farm of Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell, 
briefly reprising his Oscar-nominated role from the first movie). But a 
series of complications and crises leads Babe (voiced by E.G. Daily, who 
can also be heard as Tommy in "The Rugrats Movie") and Mrs. Hoggett 
(Magda Szubanski) on a quest for prize money and strands them in a big, 
frightening metropolis, the abstract likes of which haven't been seen 
since Tim Burton's last "Batman" film. </P>
<P>There, the pair crash at an inn populated mostly by creatures great and 
small who also have the gift of gab but live in fear of the city's 
stringent animal-control policies. Before long, Babe has gained the 
trust of the hotel hierarchy - including a pair of malapropping chimps 
(Steven Wright and Glenn Headly) and a wizened orangutan (James Cosmo) - 
and also a gang of homeless, mock-vicious street strays lead by a 
tough-talking pitbull (Stanley Ralph Ross); together, they veer in and 
out of trouble. </P>
<P>That director George Miller (the producer of "Babe" 1) is also the 
creator of Australia's Mad Max movies seems to explain why "Pig in the 
City" is such a bizarre film. Miller's impressive visual dynamo steers 
toward many memorable sights even when the scenes that show them off 
play on for too long. Couple that with the overt gloom of some passages 
and you've got prime examples of how this "Babe" might be too much for 
the wee ones to bear - a depressing sequence where Babe's furry friends 
get impounded almost extends to the point of morbitiy. </P>
<P>Other affairs that threaten the movie's G-rating include the implication 
of an airport cavity search for Mrs. Hoggett (!), a crippled terrier who 
has flashes of the afterlife following a nasty accident, and even 
glimpses of pretty city girls in thongs that don't leave much to the 
imagination. But these head-scratching moments are simple distractions, 
not overt detractions; "Babe: Pig in the City" is simply too fun a 
fantasy to be hampered by out-of-place moments, especially given that 
the entire movie blindsides the viewer. </P>
<P>So the first "Babe" ends up winning by a snout, but this 
handsomely-mounted charmer comes in a close second. All too precious is 
the film's flawless pastiche of real, animatronic and computer-generated 
critters - most memorably, a 20-cat chorus that belts out a heavenly 
rendition of "Three Blind Mice." Though naysayers (make that 
_neigh_-sayers) may dismiss the notion as just more of the same, a third 
"Babe" adventure doesn't seem out of the question, because for all of 
its uncanny nuances and twisted peculiarities, "Pig in the City" brings 
home the bacon.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck
