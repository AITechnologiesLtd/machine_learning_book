<P>`The Insider', a riveting dramatization of the events that occurred in
the tobacco wars of 1995, is a movie of rare superiority. While some
movies merely present the facts, `The Insider' involves the viewer with
them, to such a point that it feels as if we're watching a real-life
simulation rather than a movie. It's about as absorbing as a film of
this genre can be.</P>
<P>Capturing your attention from minute one, director Michael Mann proceeds
to masterfully
craft the story of a former tobacco company employee named Jeffrey
Wigand (Russell
Crowe), who reveals to the CBS program `60 Minutes' how cigarettes are
being illegally enhanced by chemicals to make them more addictive.  `60
Minutes' producer Lowell
Bergman (Al Pacino) first approaches Wigand for his knowledge in another
matter, but
after the continued threatening of his family and health plan, Wigand
makes the crucial
decision to expose the secrets that his boss originally withheld while
testifying before
congress. It's an engrossing story that captivates your interest, both
in the aspects of journalism and it's compelling human details.</P>
<P>Crowe is superb as Wigand, who is shown as a thoughtful family man
committed to his job. All of the key scenes involving Wigand's shocking
revelation - namely, a courtroom
sequence and the `60 Minutes' interview itself - are pure dynamite.
Crowe digs deep
within the character to give the audience an accurate personification of
his complicated situation. He and Pacino compliment each other in such a
miraculous fashion, as if to
suggest the two actors have worked together on several projects previous
to this one. Both
Crowe and Pacino deserve to be recognized by the Academy come nomination
time.</P>
<P>The interview with the tobacco industry insider never ran, because of
the possible lawsuit
that could have resulted. CBS pulled the plug in fear of a tobacco
company takeover, and Wigand was infuriated because he had risked his
life and social stature and felt manipulated
by Bergman and the `60 Minutes' crew. Afterward, the story ran in the
New York Times and Wall Street Journal, and Bergman resigned from CBS
due to the future complications that would arise with new stories.</P>
<P>If `The Insider' has one deficiency, it's the matter of it's elongated
running length, which clocks in around the vicinity of 2 hours and 40
minutes. The dramatic thrust of the story almost becomes too
overwhelming and convoluted. After the two hour mark, the amount of
interest declined on my part. Undeniably though, for a movie to attain
that amount of fascination and involvement for such a time span is quite
remarkable. Backed by stellar performances, Mann (who previously teamed
with Pacino for the action film `Heat') directs at the top of his form.</P>
<P>In the supporting category, virtually everyone contributes. Diane Venora
is excellent as Wigand's estranged wife. As `60 Minutes' news
correspondent Mike Wallace, Christopher Plummer reinvents the word
`intensity' with exceptional ferocity, and Philip Baker Hall delivers as
executive producer Don Hewitt. There are several moments that jump right
off the screen, namely an electrifying courtroom sequence in which a
heated attorney (Bruce McGill, terrific in a tiny role) defends Wigand
by verbally attacking an opposing representative. If you exert a fair
amount of patience and understanding, you'll be glued to your seat
during `The Insider'.</P>
<P>At first, the premise of `The Insider' didn't strike as one that could
be this enthralling. Nonetheless, I was hardly bored with the film, even
during it's periodic lulls of detailed investigation. It's just so
invigorating to have a true story told with such bracing skill as `The
Insider', and it's also quite refreshing, because few thrillers of
modern day cinema are this self-involved.</P>
<P>It's a full-fledged dramatic powerhouse that deserves to be mentioned at
the upcoming Academy Awards ceremony. I'm sure the real Lowell Bergman
and Jeffrey Wigand would approve.</P>
