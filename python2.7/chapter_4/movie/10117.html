<P>KISS OR KILL is an Australian film, which will probably make what I'm about to
say all the more politically incorrect - but here I go anyway: KISS OR KILL
would've been a million times better if it had been done more Hollywood-like.
Yes, that's right - even though we usually hear the opposite about a movie,
KISS OR KILL could've used a more glamorizing, sensationalistic approach.</P>
<P>Writer/director Bill Bennet gives us a product that seems more like a film-
school project. It's low-key, somewhat amateurish, and in a film class it
would probably be hailed as a creative masterpiece. But in the "real world" of
movie-goers, this is not an enjoyable hour and a half. Put in the hands of a
more "commercial" director, and with some retouches to the script, I think
KISS OR KILL could've had some real potential at being a unique, fresh, and
fun adventure/romance flick. Sadly, it is not.</P>
<P>KISS OR KILL is the story of two young lovers who travel Australia conning
lustful men. Nikki (Frances O' Connor), the female of the duo, hangs out in
the bars seducing married men. When they go back to the guy's apartment for a
drink, she slips him a couple of pills, he falls asleep, and she robs him
blind. Then along with her boyfriend Al (Matt Day), they travel on until they
find the next victim.</P>
<P>The first time we actually see this happen, however, something goes wrong. The
guy Nikki drugged isn't just sleeping, he's dead! As Nikki and Al ransack the
dead guy's personal belongings, they argue over what's happened. They're
attention soon turns to different matters however. They discover a videotape
of well known sports-figure Zipper Doyle (Barry Langrishe) in bed with a young
boy. Shocked and disgusted, Nikki calls Zipper and leaves a harsh message on
his answering machine.</P>
<P>The two lovers take off once again, while back at the hotel room, the cops are
investigating the dead body. They suspect murder and begin a hunt for Nikki
and Al. Meanwhile, aware of the missing tape, Zipper too takes off searching
for the duo. We follow Nikki and Al as they travel from place to place, and
although we never actually see it happen, the people they meet tend to wind up
dead and robbed. When Nikki and Al fight about how the victims died, it
becomes obvious that we can't be sure who did it, whether it be one of Nikki
and Al or not.</P>
<P>KISS OR KILL really does have a good *idea* behind it, but it also has too
many flaws. Mainly, it scores high in the three U's: Underdevelopment,
Uneventfulness, and Unevenness. If this film had taken more time to develop
it's characters and give them depth, this film could have been a real gem in
today's prosaic market. Sadly, it just never gets rolling. Then there's the
editing. For a moment I was quite delighted with the non-stop jump cuts. They
never deviated from the scene or focus, but merely added a jumpy quality to
the film. For a moment, you're quite dazzled by this, but it doesn't take long
at all for it to become an annoying, overdone characteristic that is anything
but becoming. If Bennet had used this technique merely for introductions, it
would have proved to be a unique and artistic use of "poetic license", but
when it's used throughout the entire film, one wants to swat at the screen as
though it were a fly endlessly buzzing in their face.</P>
<P>As seems to happen all too often in movies, there are a few rare things that
*almost* make the movie recommendable. In this case, it's the acting.
Unfortunately it isn't the two leads who provide this wonderful acting. While
O' Connor and Day show that they indeed have potential, they are wasted in
frivolousness and, at times, downright silliness. But it is Chris Haywood and
Andrew S. Gilbert (as detectives Hummer and Crean, respectively) who just
don't get enough screen time to really shine, although we do get a peak at
their brilliance. In particular, a bewitching little exchange in a diner
(heavily influenced by PULP FICTION) shows us what we've been missing. This
laugh-out-loud moment makes one lament over the fact that there was so much
potential lost in this film. In addition, Max Cullen as Stan the "not-all-
there" motel-keep, is also quite winsome but underused.</P>
<P>Overall, KISS OR KILL may be worth a disheartening look merely for it's
potentiality, but nothing more. It may wind up being a good example of what
*not* to do when making a motion-picture. The faults stand out enough that you
could actually take notes on what to avoid. I constantly found myself thinking
of ways I'd improve the film, and as a possible re-write, this could be one
for the books. Instead of coming away angry and disappointed, KISS OR KILL
makes you want to help the film. It has enough there to make you *want* to
enjoy it, but not enough to really win you over. In the end, you won't want to
chastise Bennett for his shortcomings - you'll be more likely to pat him on
the back and say, "Nice try. Better luck next time."</P>
