<P>Remember the dude who was Patrick Swayze's friend in GHOST (8/10), and then
screwed him over in the name of greed? Yeah? Well, his name was Tony Goldwyn
and this film is his directorial debut.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Square husband takes his frustrated wife and blossoming daughter to their
annual retreat in the Catskills mountains. During their stay, the husband
has to constantly drive back to town for work, leaving the wife to glad-eye
the local free-spirited blouse salesman, and the daughter to enjoy her
initial rites of passage into womanhood.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This film did not offer me any new insight into the human condition, the
late sixties, the Jewish getaways, humor, blouse salesmen or the flowering
of a young girl. It did however include a typical 60s hippie soundtrack (if
you like that kind of thing), a great performance put forth by the
underrated Diane Lane, who projects the wife's utter desperation very
effectively, and Viggo Mortensen. Now despite his character's lack of depth
and absence of emotion, Viggo still managed to hold my attention simply by
his form as an actor, his presence as a bonafide moochacho, and his slick
mane. Ironically, I kept joking to my friend that they could've just called
this film the "Blouse Man" solely on the number of times they coined those
words. It is only later that I found out that the makers behind this
yawn-fest had originally had the foresight to title it "Blouse Man". Oy vey!</P>
<P>The husband in this film was also a disappointment by the way of the
lackluster performance given by the miscast Liev Shrieber, and his
character's ultimately unconvincing actions. In fact, for a film that
features a faithful Jewish wife cheating on her husband at the Woodstock
concert no less, this movie offered very little actual drama, and a
resolution that just seemed a little too tidy for my taste. Anna Paquin was
good as the confused daughter, but all of her transformations have already
been seen before in other better films, and the time dedicated to her
character in this film, was simply not enough to care. Other than that, the
jokes were all adult-oriented and lame for my taste, and the Woodstock scene
was obviously shot within a group of fifteen people or so. All in all, I
wouldn't recommend this film on any level, unless you are a huge Viggo fan
(there's a shot of his ass in this one as well), enjoy sexual re-awakenings
(via a couple of nicely shot sex scenes featuring the lovely Lane) and love
the Diane Lane. Otherwise, this film offers a weak plot, very little in
dramatic interest, and nothing memorable to offer cinema-goers.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Most of the scenes in the Catskill mountains were actually shot up North in
Montreal, Canada.
Diane Lane was married to actor Christopher Lambert from 1988 to 1994, at
which time, they got divorced.
The voice of the social director at the camp is none other than the voice of
Marge Simpson from TV's "The Simpsons", Julie Kavner.
This film went through three other title changes before settling on the one
set to its poster now: BLOUSE MAN, KISS THE SKY and OVER THE MOON.
Local Montreal movie critic Bill Brownstein makes a cameo appearance as a
customer in one scene at the husband TV repair workshop.</P>
