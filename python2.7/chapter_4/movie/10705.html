<P>   In the movie "Amistad," John Quincy Adams states in his
big monologue that there is nothing a man would not do to
regain his freedom.  Peter McCabe (Michael Keaton), the
superbly played villain in "Desperate Measures," proves it. 
Planning an escape while serving a sentence of life without
parole with a good deal of time in solitary confinement, this
killer has the guts to do things to his body that make some
audience members actually sympathize with him.  He
dislocates his thumb, swallows a vial of a drug designed to
counteract another drug, takes a bullet in his leg, and slashes
himself up a bit on a barbed wire fence.  As cynical and
apparently unfeeling as he is, he has a weak spot in his heart
for two people: one is nine-year-old lad, Mattew Conner
(Joseph Cross) who is dying of leukemia; the other is the
boy's father, police detective Frank Conner (Andy Garcia),
with whom he connects as a man who, like McCabe, will do
anything to realize his goal.</P>
<P>   "Desperate Measures" has frequent moments of tension,
putting the audience often at the edge of their seats despite
the number of time we've all seen the usual accoutrements of
action-adventure films.  We are treated to the blowing up of a
bridge linking two buildings of a hospital, some shoot-ups
involving the murder of additional people by McCabe, heroism
by a doctor (Marcia Gay Harden) who is struggling to save
the life of a small, intelligent boy, and a seemingly endless
chase conducted within the corridors of a big city hospital. 
Filmed in San Francisco and Los Angeles, the movie, directed
by Barbet Schroeder ("Kiss of Death," "Before and After"),
deals with a cop who seeks the bone marrow of a deadly
criminal to save the life of his leukemia-riddled boy--the one
person whom a computer database turns up as possessing a
perfect match.  Conner, who obviously has great love for his
son, is perfectly willing to violate the law himself, by breaking
into a central database in order to locate a match, and then,
by ruthlessly allowing several people in the hospital to be shot
by this rogue rather than allow the man to die.</P>
<P>   Schroeder is toying with a fascinating idea: that there is
good and bad in each of us, that while an officer of the law--
heck--even a country's president--may do things that would
not pass muster with Mother Teresa, likewise the most
seemingly hardened criminal has a recognizable human side.</P>
<P>   Even while granting the originality of scripter David Klass's
story--the determination of an otherwise honest man to break
every law if his actions will keep his son alive--the real
surprise of the movie is Michael Keaton.  Granted: this
performer, who has consistently turned in professional work in
comic roles, has shown a serious side in films like "Clean and
Sober."  But never before has Keaton so successfully
portrayed a guy who is absolutely ruthless, one whose 150+
I.Q. gives him an intelligence and ability to make multiple
escapes and yet recognize so clearly the bond he shares with
the nine-year-old boy and the child's dad.  Keaton is so good
in his role that for the one hundred minutes' running time of
the movie, you'll virtually forget that you've seen him in fluff
like "Batman" and hilarious spoofs like "Mr. Mom."  He is ably
backed up by Andy Garcia who gets his audience to lose
some sympathy for his character despite the nobility of his
cause, and by newcomer Joseph Cross as the traditional
movie cute-kid who elicits our compassion for his bravery in
facing the possibility of death.  Rated R.  Running Time: 100
minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey Karten</P>
