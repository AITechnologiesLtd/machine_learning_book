 Director:  Sandy Tung
 Writer:  Dale Rosenbloom, novel by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor
 Cast: Frannie, Michael Moriarty, Scott Wilson, Zachary
Browne, Ann Dowd, Rod Steiger</P>
<P>   Extravagant sentimentality is acceptable in only one kind of
movie: any family film dealing with dogs.  Just thinking about
the best doggie movie ever made, Fred M. Wilcox's "Lassie
Come Home" (1943), sets my tears rolling.  With the late
great Roddy McDowall as the young boy whose poor family
has to sell its beloved collie (played winningly by
Pal), "Lassie Come Home" emerged as what critic Leonard
Maltin constructively called "a tearjerker of the first order."</P>
<P>   Neither "Shiloh" installment can match up to The Great
One but the first episode in this series about a beloved
beagle tossed out a question in ethics suitable for Harvard
majors studying Kant and Kierkegaard.  If a dog, owned by a
man who abuses it, runs away into the arms of an adorable
11-year-old kid, should that kid have the moral right to keep
it?  In the Dale Rosenbloom tale, the lad's father says no.  A
mailman who is barely getting by financially, dad explains that
the dog is the legal property of a creep named Judd--and,
going by the book, dad returns the small hunting dog to its
owner.  Marty is declared to be a thief by his own dad. Is he?
Yep.  But Like Mahatma Gandhi, Marty follows a higher law,
his own conscience, in putting the dog's basic, uh, human
rights above the rights of its abusive legal owner, Judd
Travers.</P>
<P>   This second installment, subtitled "Shiloh Season," is the
inevitable follow-up to that glowing first film.  Welcome back,
Shiloh!  You're already an old friend.  This time the emphasis
is not on saving a dog but on redeeming a nasty human
being.  Essentially, director Sandy Tung makes good use of
Dale Rosenbloom's adaptation of the Newberry-award-
winning novel by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, which posits the
question, Can you teach an old dog new tricks?  The old
"dog," though, is the villainous 60-something Judd Travers,
once again played by the marvelous Scott Wilson.  Judd, who
is hated by literally every man, woman and beast in the rural
community, had made an agreement with 11-year-old Marty
Preston (whose role has been appropriated this time by
Zachary Brone).  In return for Marty's services around Judd's
shack, the eponymous beagle, Shiloh (Frannie), would be
legally the kid's. But Judd is not about to keep his part of the
agreement.  How do we know?  We know because Judd
keeps a can of beer attached firmly to his lips as though the
brew were his chewing gum, he frequently spits (though he
has not adopted the habit of chewing tobacco), and he
laughingly shoots squirrels right off the nearby telephone poll
with the same glee that Goeth took pot shots at inmates in
Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List."  Here's a guy that all in
town have given up on, and Judd seems not to care a whit
for their companionship. (We later learn what caused him to
be so callous.)  Only 12-year-old Marty Preston, who has
good reason to keep his distance from the evil old fella,
thinks he can personally rehabilitate Judd--just a spoonful of
sugar makes the medicine go down.  He knows he can do it
because he asks the family vet whether a bad dog can be
salvaged with kindness and gets the nod.</P>
<P>   "Shiloh 2" rewards us with the usual disarming cast of the
previous work.  Michael Moriarty is the kindly daddy, Ray
Preston, the town's mailman' and Ann Dowd as the local
manicurist, Louise, provides the maternal warmth that keeps
this Brady Bunch a clean-living quintet.  Rod Steiger is back
in a much kinder role than he played in his tour de force
engagement for "The Pawnbroker"--he's still the local family
doctor who makes ends meet by keeping a general store and
sending his wife out as a visiting nurse.</P>
<P>     Like 95% of sequels, "Shiloh 2" is not as trenchant as the
original, perhaps because we are already familiar with the
family setup.  This time the household laughs when the
youngest daughter, Becky (Rachel David) says that her
spinach looks like poop, whereas just two years ago Marty
was chastised for using the word "pee."  In my review of the
original, I had said that "you'll have to work out a lump in
your throat after seeing this remarkable movie, plainly and
intelligently told."  Though the sequel is related in the same
unadorned manner, with Troy Smith's camera capturing the
Thoreauvian simplicity of a village that seems to have sprung
out of the '40's, the poignant edge of the original is just not
there.  If this is your first experience with the Preston family,
however, you may indeed get the buzz that a good animal-
centered film should provide. "Shiloh 2" is an antidote to the
frantically hyped "The General's Daughter" which probably
cost about thirty times as much to turn out.</P>
