Critical Care
Starring: James Spader, Helen Mirren, Kyra Sedgwick, Albert Brooks, Jeffrey
Wright, Wallace Shawn
Directed By: Sidney Lumet
Approx Running Time: 103 minutes</PRE>
<P>After a series of disappointing motion pictures, one of cinema's most
brilliant and powerful directors shows us he really hasn't lost a step.
Sidney Lumet, who brought us such fantastic films as Dog Day Afternoon, 12
Angry Men, Network and The Pawnbroker, presents us with a stylish, darkly
comic and poignant picture in Critical Care.</P>
<P>James Spader is excellent as Dr. Werner Ernst, a young man in his third year
of residency who is seduced and blackmailed by hopeful starlett Felicia
Potter (Kyra Sedgwick). Potter, and her half-sister Connie are battling over
the fate of their comatose father. One wants him kept alive, one doesn't want
to see him continue to suffer. Spader is caught in the middle.</P>
<P>Critical Care points an accusing finger at the medicare system. Who cares?
Who doesn't? And is everyone in it for their own selfish reasons? Dr. Ernst
is trapped between doing the right thing or continuing with what promises to
be a successful career. In this cold hospital environment, no one is really
there to help anyone else when they need it. The doctors aren't there for the
patients, the administration isn't there for the doctors, and lawsuits
surround the administration. </P>
<P>Albert Brooks (completely unrecognizeable in white hair and extremely well
done makeup) is fantastic as scatter-brained old Dr. Butz. He spends most of
his onscreen time calling Dr. Ernst up to his office to give him advice on
patient care, which boils down to dedicating time only to those patients who
have extensive insurance coverage, and to hell with the others. He is a
symbol of what is wrong with the system, and why things aren't getting any
better. Though Brook's Dr. Butz is often redundant in his dialogue, we get
the feeling he is supposed to be that way. It is an effective effort to
frustrate both the young Dr. Ernst and the viewer. Helen Mirren is good, but
understated as a compassionate nurse. Her character never gets to make much
of an impact.</P>
<P>Visually, the film is quite impressive. We spend most of the time in sterile,
spacestation-looking Intensive Care Unit rooms. The ICU is circular, and the
nurse's station is in the middle of it all. The beds are inflatable blue
plastic. They look like something you'd want to float on in a pool. The
machines are all futuristic and complex. But most striking is the lack of
background inside the rooms. There are no walls, just endless white space.
But this look in the ICU area is extremely important. It helps ease the
transition between realism and surrealism. There are a few dreamlike
sequences that show us the fears of certain characters. One patient, played
by Jeffry Wright (Basquiat) is visited by an assistant to Satan, played by
Wallace Shawn. Angelic Anne Bancroft visits James Spader in a dream sequence,
and helps him form his future by suggesting a course of action. Both sets of
sequences, though, take place in these other-worldly ICU rooms, so the
transition is not jarring, but rather smooth and almost expected. </P>
<P>The production design by Philip Rosenberg certainly is one of the most
amazing aspects of Critical Care. Early in the film, there is an impressive
shot of Sedgwick and Spader going up an escalator in an intricately
structured mall. It suggests equilibrium and and calm. Things at this point
in the film are peaceful. But later, as Spader is pleading with a prestigious
doctor about his own future, the same camera angle shows us a twisted and
cold steel staircase, blocking most of the character. Dr. Ernst is trapped,
and no one will help him.</P>
<P>Lumet has really approached new territory with Critical Care. Presenting
controversial material is nothing new. He loves to make films about police
corruption, and he has touched on racism, and the judicial system before.
Here, he tackles ethics and the structure within the medical profession. But
Critical Care has an independent feel to it. It is fresh, and modern. Some of
the dialogue fits the black comedy mold quite well. Lumet makes all the
elements of this film, the acting, the set design, the camera work, and the
fantastic script by Steven Schwartz come together beautifully. It is an odd
film, no doubt, but also a treat to see a master filmmaker doing great work
again.
3 1/2 stars out of 4
