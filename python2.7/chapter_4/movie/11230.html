<P>     At least CAUGHT UP has a sense of humor.  That quality alone allows 
it to transcend the invisible barrier that separates nearly-unwatchable 
films from their forgettable, mediocre counterparts.  This is the kind 
of motion picture that's neither bad enough nor good enough to be 
memorable; six weeks from now, I'll probably have to refer back to this 
review to recall what it was all about.  </P>
<P>     CAUGHT UP starts with a fairly routine premise.  Darryl Allen 
(Bokeem Woodbine) gets out of prison after serving five years for 
participating in a bank robbery.  This is his second time in jail; he 
served an earlier term for possession of crack cocaine with the intent 
to distribute.  After spending most of his adult life behind bars, 
Darryl is interested in going straight and leading a good life, but 
forces on the streets are determined to steer him in the wrong 
direction.  For Darryl, the straight-and-narrow may be an impossible 
path to traverse.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Darin Scott does two things to make CAUGHT UP 
different from countless other African American-oriented films cut from 
the same cloth.  The first, which is a good idea, is to pepper the 
screenplay with instances of campy humor and satire.  The second, which 
is not a good idea, is to employ a series of preposterous plot twists 
that no one in their right mind will buy.  For example, Vanessa (Cynda 
Williams), the film's resident femme fatale, just happens to look 
exactly like Darryl's old girlfriend.  The ending also gives new meaning 
to the motion picture concept of the conservation of characters.  
(That's the rule which states that every individual, no matter how brief 
their initial appearance, will have some crucial role to play later in 
the proceedings.)</P>
<P>     Through it all, Scott continuously pokes fun at both the genre in 
general and this story in particular.  The voiceover narrative is used 
as much for comic effect as for advancing the plot (although, I hasten 
to add, THE BIG LEBOWSKI did this much better).  One individual launches 
into a diatribe about the economic repercussions of legalizing drugs.  
The sole purpose of one inept character, a supercilious white guy 
(Joseph Lindsey), is comic relief (although he's more annoying than 
funny).  Yet, for all of the sporadic humor, CAUGHT UP is ultimately 
intended to be taken seriously, and that's its downfall.  Made as a 
straight parody, a la I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA, this could have been a 
riot.</P>
<P>     The level of acting is substandard.  Woodbine, who has done decent 
work in past supporting roles (JASON'S LYRIC, for one), is out of his 
depth as the main character.  He doesn't have the charisma, presence, or 
range to present Darryl as anything more than a cardboard figure.  Plus, 
he mumbles much of his cliché-riddled dialogue.  His co-star, Cynda 
Williams, isn't much better.  Sure, she's sexy and looks great with and 
without her clothes on, but that's about all she has going for her. </P>
<P>     In many ways, I was reminded of PALMETTO, although CAUGHT UP is 
certainly more graphic and lurid (this film contains a lot of sex, 
nudity, and bloodshed).  Both films have hard-to-swallow narratives that 
care less about credibility than about whether they can surprise viewers 
with an out-of-left-field plot twist.  Additionally, the leads in the 
two movies are rivals for the dubious title of Mystery/Thriller 
Protagonist with the Lowest I.Q.  And, as stupid as I thought Woody 
Harrelson's character was in PALMETTO, I would have to award the prize 
to Darryl Allen, who frequently acts as if he has been lobotomized.  
Sadly, that's a term that also applies to sections of the wildly uneven 
script.  When it comes to thrillers, CAUGHT UP still has a long way to 
go.</P>
