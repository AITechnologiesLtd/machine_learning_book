<PRE>                                LITTLE BUDDHA
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     I went with low expectations to see LITTLE BUDDHA but was quite
pleasantly surprised.  LITTLE BUDDHA is a fairy tale interwoven with a
cartoon like telling of the Buddha story.  The fairy tale is that a
great Buddhist teacher from Bhutan who died nine years ago may or may
not have been reincarnated into a nine year old boy who lives in
Seattle.  He is given a cartoon picture book of the story of Buddha,
and we have periodic long flash backs to the life of Buddha played much
like a cartoon but starring Keanu Reeves as Prince Siddhartha who later
became known as Buddha.</P>
<P>     Like most fairy tales, or operas for that matter, you must be able
to suspend disbelieve if you are to proceed.  Think about it.  If
someone comes to your doorstep claiming to be a Buddhist monk and says
he wants you to leave your young son at the local temple for
examination since your son might have been reincarnated, would you a)
slam the door, b) call the police, or c) leave your little boy at the
temple?  In the movie, they eventually pick c.</P>
<P>     This is a beautiful film written and directed by Bernardo
Bertolucci who did THE LAST EMPEROR.  It was easy to forget logic and
go with the story.  I am familiar with Western Judeo-Christian beliefs
but knew nothing of Buddha or any of the legend surrounding his life.
I found that part fascinating.  I do not know what liberties Bertolucci
took with the Buddha story, but I found it pretty bizarre besides being
fascinating, but then again, any religious story probably sounds
strange to someone who knows nothing about that religion.</P>
<P>     Bridget Fonda (most recently excellent in SINGLE WHITE FEMALE)
plays the mother and Chris Isaak (small part in Silence of the Lambs)
plays the father of the nine year old (Alex Wiesendanger - a new
actor).  Bridget Fonda's acting ranges from good to excellent.  She is
good here.  Isaak gives a blah performance.  The little boy is okay.  I
think Keanu Reeves (e.g., in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING -  like his acting
abilities) is a terrible actor.  This movie confirmed my opinion.  It
is the monks (led by Ruocheng Ying) and the story itself that make this
movie come alive.</P>
<P>     The imaginative script is by Bernardo Bertolucci, Mark Peploe, and
Rudy Wurlitzer.  It shows the monks as real people who joke, fall
asleep accidentally, and have to be reminded to take their medicine yet
have almost a mystic quality about them nevertheless.</P>
<P>     LITTLE BUDDHA runs 2:03 and editing by Pietro Scalia should have
been tighter.  I give the movie ** 1/2 and recommend it to anyone with
an open mind.  It is correctly rated PG.  I think kids over say 8 would
enjoy it.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
