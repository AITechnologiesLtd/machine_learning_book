<PRE>                            MEET WALLY SPARKS
                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>     The outrageous antics of comedian Rodney Dangerfield are seen in such
hilarious films as 'Caddyshack' (1980), 'Easy Money' (1983) and 'Back to
School' (1986).  'Back to School' is probably the funniest and most likable
of these films but Dangerfield (who is 75) has lost his way pretty much with
'Meet Wally Sparks'.  </P>
<P>     Rodney portrays an unorthodox tabloid talk show host who becomes mixed
up in one wild situation with a southern governor and his family who are
extremely conservative.  Dangerfield's son becomes romantically involved with
the governor's daughter and a television executive's assistant who's trying
to have Rodney fired is in tow and gets exactly what he deserves.  Throw in a
political sex scandal and a head butting feud with Dangerfield's television
boss (Burt Reynolds) and you have the makings for a trivial and desperate
comedy of enormously bad proportions.</P>
<P>     Someone should have told Dangerfield (who co-wrote the picture) that
less is sometimes more and that good comedy doesn't necessarily include
throwing in everything but the kitchen sink in order to make people laugh and
the film degrades not only itself but the audience.  Furthermore the film is
bogged down with Dangerfield's one liners that are growing tiresome.  It's
slapstick humour is both juvenile and self defeating.  Given the limited
release this film had, I suspect that it may have been considered at some
point as a direct to video release.</P>
<P>     Dangerfield's fans will be pleased but others may feel that even though
we somehow know what to expect going in, we don't expect the humour to hammer
us over the head like a baseball bat.</P>
