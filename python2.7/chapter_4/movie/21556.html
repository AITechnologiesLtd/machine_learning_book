<P>Susan Granger's review of "THE BONE COLLECTOR" (Universal Pictures)</P>
<P>This is yet another urban thriller about a sadistic serial
killer. Denzel Washington plays a bedridden, suicidal, quadriplegic
forensics expert and best-selling author who teams up with a former
fashion model-turned-rookie cop, Angelina Jolie, to capture an
imaginative murderer with a penchant for cryptic clues. And each
killing is uniquely horrific, just like in "Seven." Inexplicably, the
NYPD uses Washington's SoHo loft as a base of operations while Jolie
acts as his eyes and ears, exploring the grisly crime scenes,
describing them to him, and following his instructions
precisely. "You've got to saw her hands off at the wrist line! I've
got to have those cuffs for prints!" he barks into her cell phone from
his motorized bed. As his devoted nurse, Queen Latifah imbues the role
with a special sassy quality, while the stereotypical supporting
characters include Ed O'Neill, Mike McGlone, Luis Guzman, and Michael
Rooker as Washington's former boss. Utilizing Jeremy Iacone's
cliche-ridden, uneven screenplay, adapted from the novel by Jeffrey
Deaver, director Philip Noyce ("Clear and Present Danger," "Patriot
Games") cleverly keeps the cinematic tension taut as the hapless
victims are buried alive, scalded by steam or devoured by rats. But
the final confrontation between the immobilized Washington - using
"one finger, two shoulders, and a head" - and the deranged killer is
utterly preposterous. Angelina Jolie is woefully unconvincing,
particularly when she's crying, and her pouting lips have been so
puffed up with some kind of silicone concoction that they look
ludicrous.  On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Bone
Collector" is a dopey, diabolical 6. It's basically a grisly, gruesome
whodunnit.</P>
