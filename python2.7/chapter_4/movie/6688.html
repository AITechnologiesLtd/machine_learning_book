<PRE>                               ONE FINE DAY
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        There are movies that are sweet and there are movies that 
go way beyond sweet to the point of saccharine. And saccharine 
causes cancer in some people. So be aware that because I had a 
mostly positive viewing experience with ONE FINE DAY doesn't 
mean you'll be able to tolerate its sickening sucrose. I have a higher 
level of sugar tolerance than most even though my family has a 
history of diabetes.</P>
<P>        ONE FINE DAY covers a day and night in the life of two 
struggling, divorced parents, played by George Clooney and 
Michelle Pfeiffer. Clooney is an immature newspaper columnist who 
wakes up one morning to find he's got custody of his six-year-old 
daughter for the week. He's the type that feeds his kid Tic-Tacs and 
Smores and routinely forgets to do certain key things. One of the key 
things he's supposed to do on this fine day is call Pfeiffer and tell her 
his daughter doesn't need a ride to school after all. And of course he 
forgets.</P>
<P>        That means Pfeiffer and her six-year-old son, in the same 
class as Clooney's daughter, end up late for school and miss the big 
field trip. They show up at the same time Clooney does, and the 
sparks fly, in that cute, flirtatious movie way. Clooney and Pfeiffer 
share a cab back into the city, complaining about each other into 
their respective cell phones, and begin their hectic workdays with 
children en tow. Rest assured their paths will cross many a time 
until eventually they realize they're madly in love with each other.</P>
<P>        Yes, there is a plot in there somewhere. Pfeiffer has to show 
a presentation to some clients at 2:00 and must race across town to 
fix the scale model her kid was responsible for breaking, and 
Clooney has to track down an interview before 5:00. And somehow 
they switched cell phones by mistake. Little contrivances like these 
add up for Clooney and Pfeiffer and they have to humble their 
stubborn pride and admit they need each other's help.</P>
<P>        This movie would be excrutiating if not for a few details, 
like the fact that the script actually does contain a lot of laughs, 
minor and big, and that Clooney and Pfeiffer do have a weird kind 
of chemistry. The concept of George Clooney as a romantic lead 
wouldn't have occurred to me in a thousand years -- it's about as 
ridiculous as having him play Batman -- but he doesn't do a bad 
job at it. Now if he'd only get rid of that damn haircut...</P>
<P>        Michelle Pfeiffer was well-cast as the harrowed control 
freak who tries to juggle all those balls on her own, and the two kids 
are personifications of the word "cute." It does go on for way too 
long, but ONE FINE DAY makes for a good date movie (not that 
_I'd_ know about such things) and a not-half-bad teenybopper chick 
flick. I don't fall into either of those categories, at least not on a 
surface level, but still found the movie pleasantly entertaining.</P>
