<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 stars</P>
<P>My first reaction after viewing Head On was to take a long, deep breath.</P>
<P>Ana Kokkinos' fiery Melbourne-based film is a tense and bold character
study - one that is almost haunting in its realism.  Perhaps the most
daring of its production assets is the film's dramatic script, which
positions its protagonist in various off-putting homosexual,
confrontational and drug induced acts.  Disturbing stuff, that's for
sure - and Kokkinos knows it.  The reason why Head On is so
uncomfortable to watch is because its director knows how to use
unsettling images for intrigue, not for shock appeal.  This is a
powerhouse Australian film that is in many ways more confronting than
the likes of Saving Private Ryan, for the reason that it depicts issues
that are very real in today's society. Kokkinos boldly looks at
sexuality, ethnicity, drugs and gender in a raw and explicit manner.
With tight editing and a rigid, unusually urban cinematography, Head On
is a grating piece that explores the dissatisfaction of youth, and
society in general.</P>
<P>Ari (Alex Dimitriades) is a nineteen-year-old Greek bisexual, who is
confused by life and constantly searches for a path to happiness.  He
doesn't find it in drugs or alcohol, nor does he in regular and
unsatisfying sex.  The film chronicles one day in Ari's life, an intense
twenty-four hours full of pain and occasional joy.  Ari realizes the
pathetic state of his life but fails to do anything about it - one gets
the feeling that he is so far down and out that he will never quite be
able to regain status.  Ari has pushed on, day by day, meeting men and
women, and not thinking about what life might offer him.  He is too busy
taking everything a step at a time in the busy city of Melbourne (at one
moment, much to my delight, there are shots of Flinders Street Station
and Crown Casino).</P>
<P>Ari's character works because of the revealing screenplay (which was
adapted from the novel 'Loaded') and Alex Dimitriades' gutsy
performance.  I thought that Russel Crowe's choice of role in 1994's The
Sum of Us was game, but compared to this it looks ordinary. Dimitriades
is one hell of a brave actor.  Limiting the emotional success of this
story is its lack of characters; aside from Ari, there is really nobody
else the audience can relate with.  But perhaps this is done
intentionally, as Ari alone provides the basis for an intriguing
character study since he is such a complicated person.  His actions are
not always understandable - but that's how people are sometimes.
Whenever his life seems to be lightening up (if only for a few moments),
we are brought down once again into his depressing state of affairs.</P>
<P>Some of the final words spoken by Alex Dimitriades are cynical and
somber considering all that we have witnessed his character go through,
yet they express the moving and painful expression that this film
generates.  "I'm sliding toward the sewer, not struggling, I can smell
the shit - but I'm still breathing.  I'm gonna live my life.  I'm not
going to make a difference, I'm not going to change a thing."</P>
<P>If you're feeling brave, take a long, deep breath and watch Head On.</P>
