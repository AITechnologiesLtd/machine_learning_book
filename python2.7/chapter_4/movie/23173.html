<P>All legacies have to end at some point. In the case of `Scream', the
most popular horror movie franchise of all time, I was praying the final
chapter would permit the series to wrap up on a positive note and that
dignity would be maintained. Horror sequels are hazardous waters to be
treading into, and although director Wes Craven was able to pull it off
marvelously with the cheeky follow-up `Scream 2', I was fearing that
`Scream 3' would adhere to the tiredness of formula and that the series
would expire with a sour departure. But, in this particularly rare
instance, all's well that ends well.</P>
<P>The first positive sign in `Scream 3' is that all the primary characters
who survived the original films have returned. The familiar faces of
bloodbaths' past certainly help to establish the cushion-padded comfort
zone that makes this entry so enjoyable. Let's begin with Sidney
Prescott (Neve Campbell), the innocent victim-girl who has been through
dilapidated hell ever since her boyfriend celebrated the one-year
anniversary of her mother's death by going on a knifing rampage. Sid has
left the town of Woodsboro (the original site of the killings) and
changed her name to live incognito. Meanwhile, over in Hollywood,
production on `Stab 3 - Return to Woodsboro' has just commenced. Our
beloved Dewey Riley (David Arquette) has retired from police work and
accepted a job as technical consultant on the film, while level-headed
news-hound Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) hosts a second-rate
`Entertainment Tonight' rip-off called `Total Entertainment' and paws
around the set of the latest `Stab' installment, searching for a decent
scoop without authorization. Liev Schreiber also reprises his role as
the wrongly convicted Cotton Weary, having finally found stardom on his
own television program `100% Cotton'.</P>
<P>Enter Ghostface, the masked murderer with a motive. The actors in `Stab
3' begin getting systematically slaughtered in the same order their
characters die in the movie. Unfortunately, to avoid leaks onto the
Internet, three different endings were devised for the film.... meaning
the next victim could depend on which version of the script the killer
read. Everyone is in possible jeopardy - from hot young screen sensation
Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey), who plays the film version of Gale
Weathers, to Sarah Darling (Jenny McCarthy), who portrays a
fictionalized character named Candy and is probably intended to increase
the audience of adolescent males for `Stab 3'. Of course, everyone is a
suspect. Additional characters include the snoopy Detective Kincaid
(Patrick Dempsey), the millionaire Roger Corman-esque producer John
Milton (Lance Henriksen) and the up-and-coming music video director
Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), who takes the reins of the latest `Stab'
project.</P>
<P>Speaking of taking the reins, screenwriter Ehren Kruger (`Arlington
Road') has inherited the daunting task of replacing the uncanny wit of
former scribe Kevin Williamson in `Scream 3'. This is no easy chore, but
to his credit, Kruger's script contains an ample amount of crisp,
effectively staged frights and character development that remains loyal
to his predecessor. Some of the plot movements are clever and
surprisingly acute. In the department of murder sequences, Kruger
delivers a few real humdingers (one involving a fax machine, another
with a rack of Ghostface costumes and a set of rubber props). But most
of it's just the same old drill: the killer chases down an anorexic
victim, through dark corridors or steep stairwells, and plunges a knife
into their back repeatedly with swift precision. After the tense,
well-executed (but somewhat unexceptional) opening murder sequence, it</P>
<P>becomes gratingly obvious that `Scream 3' will settle for a simple
interpretation of Williamson's work. Fortunately, Kruger is a better
interpreter than most. And whenever the screenplay hits a rough patch,
Wes Craven's nimble direction is there to rescue it. I was frightened by
the film, and all of the creepy atmosphere and unexpected jolts are
courtesy of Mr. Craven's veteran expertise in the field of horror
movies.</P>
<P>`Scream 3' is more generic and conventional than the first two films,
but it has enough tricks up its sleeve to compensate. Cameos abound,
including an appearance by ill-fated `Scream'-er Randy Meeks (Jamie
Kennedy), who appears briefly on a videocassette to explain the Rules of
a Trilogy for our survivors. The scene is so subtly effective and clever
that it makes you wish Randy would return from beyond the grave for an
elongated period of quick-witted comic relief. Luckily, the living cast
members perform just fine. Campbell has never been more convincing as
the sullen `why me, Mr. Ghostface?' victim Sidney. The newlywed
Arquettes don't create the spark they captured in `Scream' and `Scream
2' (no, they have good chemistry - the script doesn't give them much
romantic interaction), but both continue to build their memorable
characters. David, in particular, is phenomenal as the lovable doofus
Dewey. It's the role of his career, and the actor capitalizes on all of
his chances to elevate the character to new heights. Indie queen Parker
Posey (who made a mainstream jump into `You've Got Mail' in 1998) is
wonderfully peppery in her spot-on impression of Gale Weathers, and
Patrick Warbuton (from `Seinfeld') has his moments as her protective lug
of a bodyguard. A few one-liners echo Williamson's self-aware touch,
including a particularly dim-witted character refusing to take a shower
because she's seen `Vertigo'.</P>
<P>The original `Scream' was not a landmark achievement among horror films,
but due largely to it's cleverly caustic screenplay about teens who know
the clichés of the genre, it developed into an unexpected phenomenon.
`Scream 2' was accepted on a more positive note by critics, although
audiences seemed relatively mixed. The third (and reportedly final)
chapter will not disappoint fans of the series. `Scream 3' delivers the
nail-biting goods in such a manner that teeny bopper thrill-seekers will
have trouble arguing. The overwhelming sense of closure during the
climax is a token of gratitude toward all us fans who have been
anticipating this film. Kruger finishes the cycle effectively, tying
certain events back to the original in a fashion that, while not without
plot holes, is more than satisfying. Sure, `Scream 3' occasionally
becomes the movie the first two films were lampooning, but it's executed
with style and compassion.</P>
<P>The audience at my screening seemed to be enjoying the film. They
laughed and they screamed, even if the formula was getting a bit stale.
Sure, the final half-hour, set inside a mansion with trapdoors and
secret passageways, is a bit frenetic. A large portion of the supporting
cast is obviously expendable. And yes, the whodunit is somewhat
underwhelming..... I was expecting a more startling surprise. It may be
the least of the trilogy, but I still had a hell of a time at `Scream
3'. I'll now rest easier knowing that the `Scream' series has been given
a proper burial.</P>
