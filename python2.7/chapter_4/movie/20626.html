<P>   Sometimes you get the idea that the slogan of the
American Medical Association is, "If it ain't broke, we fix it
until it is."  Doctors, with all their education and degrees--nay,
because of their education and degrees--sometimes mess us
up really good.  Since so many of our ailments originate in
our heads, or at least partially so, maybe we'd be better off
being "treated" by a good friend or by any nice guy willing to
listen carefully and comment graciously on their take.  Ivan
Reitman acquitted himself just fine six years ago with a
similar concept, his "Dave," about an incapacitated president
who is replaced by a lookalike phony, an ordinary, likeable
fellow, who even hires a local accountant to take care of the
federal budget. The country prospers.</P>
<P>   "Mumford," like "Dave," is a godsend to those of us who
believe that we could well strip away a good deal of jargon-
filled fields and substitute good common sense for fancy
diagnoses and treatments.  Specifically relating to the
profession of psychoanalysis, the movie directed by Lawrence
Kasdan ("Body Heat") from his own script could have you
leaving the theater feeling so good that the eight bucks you
paid for admission could be a better value than the $200 you
might pay to a shrink for two sessions on the couch.  The
story's amiability can be credited largely to the down-home
performance of Loren Dean, in the role of a true Mr. Nice
Guy All-American (despite his commission of a criminal act),
who shrinks the heads of a number of people of his village.
resolving age-old problems and bringing happiness and good
cheer.  Of course none of this is believable.  Dean's
character, Dr. Mumford himself, concedes at one point that
psychologists can't do a heck of a lot for people whose
problems originated in their early childhoods.  Then again,
maybe a good friend and not a professional head-doctor
could do the job: and that's exactly what Mumford is--a
phony, a quack, and a stroke of luck to the village in which
he works.</P>
<P>   Crosscutting in a conventional manner, sometimes jaggedly
from one patient to another, "Mumford" establishes the tone
of an outwardly friendly town whose residents are anything
but dangerous but whose lodgers have difficulties they take
to the doctor's couch.  Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis) has been
diagnosed with Epstein-Barr syndrome and is so regularly
exhausted that she at first cannot even make the walk to the
psychologist's office.  Skip Skiperton (Jason Lee), as
congenial a fellow as you want to meet, has made three
billion dollars by cornering the market on the production of
modems but cannot have a relationship with a woman
because he is sure they are all after his money (and he's
right).  Althea Brockett (Mary McDonnell) is trapped in a
loveless marriage with a wealthy industrialist (Ten Danson)
who is a jerk and consoles herself with compulsive mail-order
whopping while Henry Follett, the fat and balding local
pharmacist, has perpetual fantasies that he is a sexy
character in a noir movie being vamped by cleavage-rich
femmes.  One by one, Mumford finds a solution within
months for each of these delightfully troubled people, but a
discovery made by two envious psychologists (Jane Adams
and David Paymer) with the help of the town's snotty lawyer
(Martin Short) creates a predicament for Mumford and a loss
for the entire town.</P>
<P>   Mumford" is an oddity.  Starting off with a blast of music
and a black-and-white scene from a detective story that sets
a tone of danger and tension, Kasdan settles into a
phlegmatic style.  The entire picture seems to lack energy--
whether a deliberate choice from the director who is taking
his audience from the usual Hollywood slam-bang comedy
ambience or has himself gotten a touch of the Epstein-Barr
bug.  I like to think the former is the case.  After a summer
barrage of obscene, edgy, heart-pounding, and would-be
hilarious fare, maybe this is just the ticket to provide a
transition to the fall--which promises to include more of the
usual melodrama and highly-paced, strenuously directed
moviegoing experiences.  Loren Dean's a real find, a
lookalike and soundalike for Charles Grodin, and Jason Lee
turns in an appealing aw-shucks performance of what Bill
Gates could very have been like a decade or so ago. 
"Mumford" was filmed in Sonoma and Napa County California
with all the spirit that has made California the archetypically
laid-back locale of the States.  Despite that area's wide-open
spaces, Kasdan has kept the scenes close and intimate, with
generally only two people in the frame at one time.  That's all
to the good--a restful, realistic remedy for the past summer's
wild ride.</P>
