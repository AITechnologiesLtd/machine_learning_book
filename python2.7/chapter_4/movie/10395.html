<PRE>        "Titanic" -- An Unforgettable Experience
        by Homer Yen
        (c) 1997</PRE>
<P>In 1912, the Titanic would set sail on it's first and only voyage across 
the chilly North Atlantic.  History has well-documented its inevitable
doom, and expeditions have just recently discovered the remains of the
Titanic resting peacefully in its watery grave.  But, what must have
it been like to be a passenger on board the greatest and most
luxurious ship of its time?  What stories are hidden deep beneath the
Atlantic?</P>
<P>For one particular passenger, Rose (Kate Winslet), the Titanic was
nothing more than a prison ship escorting her to America, where she
will marry an odiously snooty but terribly wealthy Cal Hockley (Billy
Zane) in order to help her cash-poor mother.  But to Rose, the
engagement is the equivalent of a slow death.  One of the passengers
that she eventually meets up with is an artistic drifter, Jack Dawson
(Leonardo DiCaprio). While his social status is far beneath that of
hers, a romantic bond begins to develop as she begins to identify with
his sense of freedom.  Soon they're gallivanting through the
corridors, cargo holds and steerage sections - all the places that a
proper lady ought not to go.  Her mother is furious, her fiancé is
madly jealous, and all attempts are made to thwart their continued
relationship.  It may take an act of God (or an iceberg) to tear these
two apart.  Can a relationship work out on a 'ship of dreams' even
when doom is imminent?</P>
<P>This is just one of the terrific elements that makes this movie
unsinkable.  Through an ingenious storytelling technique, Camerron
allows the audience to absorb ourselves with the developing romance
without being distracted by the ship's fate.  Oscar-worthy Winslet is
charming and strong as the free-spirited socialite.  DeCaprio is also
appealing as the young vagabond that introduces her to the ways of the
wicked world.  Their tale is engaging and is a terrific, all-around,
old-fashioned love story.  But this movie is more than a fictional
account of two lovers from dichotomously different backgrounds.
That's just the tip of the iceberg.</P>
<P>It's also an eye-popping historical piece.  No doubt, much of the
purported $200 million spent on making this movie was used to recreate
an almost-full-scale Titanic.  Director James Camerron gives us little
peeks into an era that was dominated by class and social distinction
and into the Titanic, a symbol of the times.  We see the luxury of
first class, replete with ornate rooms, fine crystal and china.  After
dinner, the tuxedo-clad men retreat from their wives to smoke fine
cigars and sip fine brandy amongst themselves.  In the engine room, we
feel the sweat of the men that furiously shovel coal into the furnaces
that power the steam engines.  We revel with the people in steerage
who dance among themselves and drown themselves in beer.  But the most
impressive sequence comes in the latter part of the movie just after
the Titanic runs into that fateful iceberg.  Not only is the technical
production of the Titanic's sinking spellbinding, but we get a further
glimpse into the panic, chaos and brief moments of courage displayed.
Steerage passengers are forced to wait as first class passengers are
allowed to evacuate first; lifeboats can only accomodate less than
half of the passengers; and Rose and Jack desperately try to cling on
to each other, their love and their lives.  Despite the pandemonium,
Camerron's Oscar-worthy direction skillfully manages to keep our
attention focused on Rose and Jack, never for a moment allowing us to
stray from the central love story.</P>
<P>This movie is a 198-minute epic that successfully brings history and
drama into proportion.  And if Camerron had the time to tell us more,
I would have gladly sat and watched for another 3 hours.  Visually
stunning, intelligently constructed, and thoroughly engrossing, this
film is a wondrous achievement about an era and a ship that was
equally so.</P>
