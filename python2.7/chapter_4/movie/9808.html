<PRE>THE GAME
(R)</PRE>
<PRE>A review by E. Benjamin Kelsey</PRE>
<PRE>* * (out of four)</PRE>
<P>I had high hopes for this film. I was told it was one of the few movies out
there that I would not be able to guess at all. Well so far, it merely
deserves the "Most Insulting to My Intelligence" award. In fact, I have to
question if two stars wasn't a bit excessive. But, due to a plot that with
quite a bit of work has real potential, and thanks to the decent acting, I
will leave it how it is.</P>
<P>The rumors were right. I didn't have a clue as to what was in store. I get
the impression that the writer might not have either. The plot? A lot of
weird crap happens to a guy and we don't really know why or who is behind it.
In reality, there isn't a lot more to it. It seems as though the writer may
have started this project without knowing what was going to happen next
either; like he just sat down and started writing. After dragging on for two
hours, he finally threw in a lame ending simply to wrap it up.</P>
<P>Warning: I am about to divulge several key elements to the plot that, if you
plan to see this film, will definitely ruin the surprises. But it is crucial
to discuss these in order to show you the absolute absurdity of the movie.
Supposedly there is a company that is meant to spice up your boring life by
playing a game with you, a game you know nothing about, such as how to play,
what to do, or when it will end. Nonetheless, they go to elaborate measures
to find out EVERYTHING about you, then pretty much make you think you're
going to be killed and that they have emptied all your bank accounts. Gee,
that sounds fun.</P>
<P>Supposedly this company knows every single move you're going to make. They
know just where you're going to end up, and exactly when. They don't really
want to kill you . . . it's just all for effect! Such as when they drive you
into a river while locked in the back of a taxi cab. It's a good thing they
know you're going to get out and nothing will go wrong. It's good that when
they drug you and leave you in a graveyard in Mexico, that they know you're
going to make it back, fine and dandy. It's good that they know that you're
not actually going to kill any of them when they're supposedly trying to kill
you! It's a good thing that they know just what day you'll show up at their
office (as if they'd even know that!), and that they know for sure that
you're going to end up running up to the roof. And it's a good thing they
know that you're going to jump off the roof at the exact spot they want you
to. Oh, and by the way, when you find out EVERYTHING they've done wasn't
real, that it was just a prank, and that no, you didn't really kill your
brother and you didn't succeed in killing yourself, it's good that you'll
just smile and shrug it off and join the birthday party they have prepared
for you.</P>
<P>Just talking about this movie gets me so angry that they would try to feed
this to us! The more I think about this movie, the madder I get!
Unfortunately they did too well of a job at their B.S. story that I can't
give them a lower grade. But trust me, THE GAME does deserve special
recognition for its shortcomings! THE GAME is absolutely lame!</P>
