<PRE>                                 THE WITCHES
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Jim Henson's last film is a charming
     modern fairy tale of a boy foiling a plot by the witches of
     England.  It captures some of the fun horror of traditional
     fairy tales.  Unfortunately, it loses some of its inspiration
     about mid-film.  The story would be ideally suited to
     animation and doing it in live action is an impressive if not
     altogether necessary feat.  Rating: low +2.</P>
<P>     The perfect medium for showing imaginative images visually is
animation.  With animation, if you can visualize it, you can put it on a
screen.  1973's FANTASTIC PLANET, while lacking in story values, may well be
the most visually imaginative science fiction film ever made.  Unfortunately
for animated fantasy, STAR WARS came out four years later and showed that
imaginative live action was coming of age and animated fantasy became a
sideshow.  Only the Japanese seem to recognize the possibilities of
animation as a medium for fantasy, and even in Japan fantastic animation is
falling short of the real potential of the medium.  In the United States and
Europe audiences want live action even if it is at the expense of
imagination.  Films such as BATMAN and DICK TRACY are trying to impress the
world with how well they can overcome problems that would not even arise
with animation.  DICK TRACY was able to make some expensive boxoffice stars
really look much like the comic strip characters.  BATMAN was less
successful visually in making Jack Nicholson look like the Joker.  Both of
these films could have had better stories and looked absolutely perfect had
they been animated, but they would have died at the boxoffice.  Audiences
really want live action and are quite willing to sacrifice story values and
imagination for the thrill of seeing things done in live action.</P>
<P>     THE WITCHES is a fine new live-action fantasy film that almost matches
in imagination and charm what Walt Disney was able to do with animation back
in the 1940s.</P>
<P>     Fairy tales are not all sweetness and fun, and they are not just for
children.  Most fairy tales are horror stories told on a level that all ages
can appreciate them.  And that is just what THE WITCHES is.  From the very
beginning this film lays down some blood-curdling folklore about witches.
Some of it is really the stuff paranoia is made of.  Witches can live right
next door, they smell children from great distances, they have no toes.
Take note, those of you who feel children must be protected from the sort of
scary stories that children have been raised on from time immemorial.  The
stories are told to young Luke (played by Jasen Fisher) by his Norwegian
grandmother (played by Swedish actor/director Mai Zettering) and it is a
good thing she told him.  He shortly has to fight a convocation of the
witches of England in their plot to turn all English children into mice.
And shortly is how he has to fight them, since he is one of the first two
children turned into mice.</P>
<P>     Jim Henson used his Muppet technology to portray the mouse Luke when he
does something non-mouselike.  When a trained mouse can be used, it is.  The
problem there is that the Muppet mouse has a cute face that the real mouse
apparently found very difficult to mimic.  The combining of realistic mouse
movements with a humanlike personality for the mouse would be, of course,
much simpler for Disney to do in animation than it was for Henson to do in
live action, and the result would have been much more successful.  The
makeup for the witches is similarly nicely executed.  Anjelica Huston's
Grand High Witch makeup fails to convince totally that this is really the
face of a living being, but it is well-detailed.</P>
<P>     THE WITCHES is, and is likely to remain, Nicholas Roeg's only
children's film.  (He claims he made it for his own newly-born child.)
Allan Scott's script, based on the novel by Roald Dahl, raises some
gooseflesh early on, but loses much of its power to chill once Luke is a
cute mouse and the story concentrates more on his mission than on the horror
of the witches.  Scott also manages to throw in some double entendres
clearly not intended for the younger audience.  In smaller roles there is
Rowan Atkinson (television's Black Adder) as a hotel manager clearly of the
Basil Fawlty style.  Bill Peterson (Dickie Bird in Bill Forsyte's COMFORT
AND JOY) plays the father of a mouse who once was a gluttonous child.</P>
<P>     It would be unfair to down-rate this film because it is not doing
anything to advance animated film.  The film as it stands *is* charming and
works (at least generally) in live action.  It is a nice fantasy and
deserves some credit for not aiming specifically at a youth or teenage
market.  It is just a decent fantasy film that is there for whatever
audience it finds.  I rate it a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
