<PRE>BACKSTAGE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>Chris Fiore's BACKSTAGE, a documentary about touring hip-hop groups from 
Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings, is a movie for hip-hop fans 
only.  But even die-hard hip-hoppers will probably be disappointed by 
BACKSTAGE's proclivity for teasing its audiences with brief excerpts 
rather than complete songs from the groups' touring concert footage.</P>
<P>Starring Jay-Z, DMX, Method Man, Redman, Ja Rule, and Bennie Seagel, the 
movie does have energetic pacing, but I'm at a loss to find anything 
else good to say about it.  With its shameless self-promotion, the 
documentary could just as easily have been a television infomercial were 
it not for the movie's plethora of profanity and its sexual episodes.</P>
<P>Among its low points are the scenes involving the groupies that hang 
around the stars.  When these women pull up their tops or perform oral 
sex on the music performers, cheesy yellow bubbles are superimposed over 
their faces.  On these, Fiore has added "cute" little sayings like "Your 
Face Here" and "Your Ad Here."  See, he is saying, you too could hang 
around these guys and degrade yourself just like these women.  It's a 
message that we certainly could have done without.</P>
<P>Many of the scenes have "staged" written all over them.  One of the 
groups, for example, shows us a copy of GOOD WILL HUNTING to prove that 
they watch more than just gangster movies.  The performers, in one of 
their many commercial moments, brag that hip-hop outsells all other 
types of music.  This, for all I know, may be completely true.  But 
their saying it smacks more of gratuitous self-promotion than anything 
else.</P>
<P>Let me remind Fiore that good documentaries can appeal to a wide 
audience.  This one ignores that rule entirely in favor of cheap 
theatrics.  And, as I've already said, this film doesn't deliver as it 
should even for its intended audiences.  It is also haphazardly edited 
and poorly shot.  Many much better films than this one have been unable 
to obtain a theatrical release, so it is a shame to see this one getting 
released to theaters.  It should have gone directly to video.</P>
<P>BACKSTAGE runs 1:39.  It is rated R for strong language, nudity and drug 
content and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older.</P>
