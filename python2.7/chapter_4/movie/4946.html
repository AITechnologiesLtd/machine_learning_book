<P>     A couple years ago, writer/director/actor/ex-cabby Eric Schaeffer,
along with his co-everything pal Donal Lardner Ward, made the very
funny, ultra-low budget MY LIFE'S IN TURNAROUND.  (Actually, one of the
better of films of 1994, as I recall.) The two went on to television--
on "Too Something," on Fox-- and now Schaeffer's back on film, with Ward
nowhere to be found.  Too bad.  This super- sleight New York romantic
comedy could use a helping hand.</P>
<P>     The premise has longtime roomies Schaeffer and Sarah Jessica Parker
(playing a therapist, no less!) vowing to take a dive off the Brooklyn
Bridge if they don't find love by age thirty.  Which is in one month.
Off they go to find romance, which, of course, is right in front them.
Yawn.  There isn't much substance to IF LUCY FELL; the loosely played
laughs come and go, and the emotion behind the romance just isn't there.
If there's a reason to watch this film-- on tape, of course, after
renting MY LIFE'S IN TURNAROUND-- it's to enjoy Schaeffer's endearingly
goofy performance.  He's a natural, even if his movie isn't. </P>
