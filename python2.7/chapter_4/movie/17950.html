<PRE>8MM</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix
Directed By Joel Schumacher
Running Time: 2 hours 3 minutes</PRE>
<PRE>(Columbia Pictures)</PRE>
<P>8mm, written by Seven scribe Andrew Kevin Walker, has an interesting idea
which is ruined by Hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder
mystery. Nicolas Cage plays family man detective Tom Welles, who is asked by
upper class toff Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter) to investigate an movie found
in her recently deceased husbands safe. The movie happens to be an mythical
'snuff movie', where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally
slashed. All Mrs. Christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed
or not. Welles agrees, and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of
porn movies, with video clerk Max California (Phoenix) as his guide.</P>
<P>Although the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream
cinema, 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a
bit sicker than most. The snuff movie within the movie is certainly
disturbing, although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of
the shock away. 8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much, and
apart from a few moments, most of the action in the film is nothing you
haven't seen from another standard thriller.</P>
<P>The cast help towards the entertainment, apart from an hideous performance
by the increasingly lazy Nicolas Cage. While he was fun and breezy in
earlier films such as Raising Arizona (1987), ever since Leaving Las Vegas
(1995), Cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on
autopilot, such as in the terrible Snake Eyes (1998.) Here, in 8mm, he's
boring, uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice. And in this overlong
thriller, these virtues do not help keep the suspense up. Only when Cage is
onscreen with the excellent Phoenix does the film start moving, as Phoenix
is a true talent. His performance is a great break away from the gloom, and
he's just purely enjoyable to watch. Catherine Keener is completely wasted
as Cage's wife, although she delivers a far better performance than her
character deserves. Her character, though, is hugely underwritten, one of
the most wasted characters of the year. Also fun is Fargo's Peter Stormare
as the wildly over the top snuff film director.</P>
<P>As this film is written by the person behind Seven, 8mm is filled with doom
and gloom, and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch. Unlike
Seven, 8mm isn't too clever, and the twist is pathetic and startlingly
obvious when it arrives. Lacking the strong characters Seven featured, 8mm
ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise, and relies on the graphic scenes
to provide any entertainment. But director Joel Schumacher, the completely
wrong guy for the job, puts style over content, and while the direction and
look are good, it's just not very disturbing. Schumacher also has no idea
how to shock and audience, and though we are meant to be looking at the
'dark belly' of the porn industry, it doesn't exactly leave an haunting
impression on the viewers mind, which misses the point. Also, the last 20
minutes are so hackneyed, so cliched, it's amazing to think it's the same
film you're watching.</P>
<P>8mm is far from an success, a 'snuffed' opportunity. With a boring lead
character, 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial, and a
director obsessed with looks, what could have been one of the most shocking
films of the year is a dumb thriller. Ultimately, 8mm is probably worth
renting on home video, unless your desperate to see what the snuff film
within the film looks like. And trust me, the rest of the 2 hours are not
worth it.</P>
