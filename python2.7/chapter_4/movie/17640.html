<P>Written & Directed by Larry & Andy Wachowski</P>
<P>The cinematography is stunning!  At the beginning of the film at the
discotech, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss are face to face...the
camera closes in on Keanu with a blue light throbbing in the
background...that sets the tone for the rest of the film.  For two and
a half hours we get breathtaking shots and bleak gloom and doom, it is
quite a contrast.</P>
<P>A friend noted how there was much dialogue and less action for the
first portion of the film (Kevin Maynard's review on Mr. Showbiz
pointed out Keanu has limited dialogue...interesting... hey, how many
words did Arnold Terminator speak in the first movie? 64???)...</P>
<P>Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus is quite good.  At first he seems evil -
would you trust him?  Then he becomes the teacher - "morphing" Keanu's
character to this next level of development.</P>
<P>Hermetic Philosophy, Star Wars, Bruce Lee, ahh...but the real twist is
how this film is in reality a combination of Total Recall and
Terminator 1 and 2.  That is the key which makes this work on many
levels.</P>
<P>Where so much science fiction is derivative in a bad way, watering
down what came before (how many bad Star Wars clones will emerge in
July and August after Chapter 1 gets unleashed?)  ..The Matrix is a
clever script, solid acting (Joe Pantoliano's best role...you won't
recognize him for awhile)...this movie gets you thinking.</P>
<P>The Oracle is the other side of Yoda.  Her "students" are thought
provokers, and through it all, one wonders if The Matrix isn't really
Morpheus (a combination of Morphing and Orpheus), and The Oracle
playing mind games to help an individual get to their next level of
existence.</P>
<P>In other words, Keanu Reeves isn't only "The One", anyone walking the
path is a candidate.  Anyone.</P>
