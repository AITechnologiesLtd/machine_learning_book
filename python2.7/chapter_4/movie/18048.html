<PRE>THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU (M).  
(REP)
Director: Nick Hamm
Stars: Joseph Fiennes, Monica Potter, Rufus Sewell, Tom Hollander, Ray 
Winstone
Running time: 88 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Romantic comedies like French Kiss, Sleepless In Seattle and
When Harry Met Sally have explored the idea that our life is often a
frustrating and sometimes unsatisfying search for the perfect partner
to share our lives.  A number of recent films in this overdone genre
have also looked at how coincidences and accidents can shape our
lives.  This charming, funny and very enjoyable British comedy shares
a number of themes and ideas in common.</P>
<P>The film's central premise deals with an unusual romantic
triangle that involves three friends who all fall in love with the
same woman.  Frank, Daniel and Laurence have been friends since
childhood.  Then Martha (Monica Potter) comes between them, and her
presence tests the nature of their friendship.  An American who is
leaving her messy life behind her, Martha is determined to begin a new
life in London.  In a series of chance encounters, the three friends
all meet Martha separately, and believe that she is their perfect,
ideal woman who will make their miserable, vaguely unfulfilled lives
richer.</P>
<P>Daniel (Tom Hollander), a narcissistic record company
executive, is the most successful of the three.  Returning from a
business trip in America he first meets Monica on the plane and tries
to impress her.  Frank (Rufus Sewell) is an unemployed and
unsuccessful actor lacking in confidence, who always suffers stage
fright and misses auditions.  He meets Monica in Hyde Park, and tries
to empathise with her about their own shared hardships.  Laurence
(Joseph Fiennes, from Shakespeare In Love, etc) is a sensitive artist
who also teaches bridge to elderly ladies.</P>
<P>The story unfolds largely in a series of extended flashbacks
as Laurence relates the story of how Monica's presence strains their
friendship to a psychiatrist (Ray Winstone), who conveniently lives in
a downstairs apartment.  Misunderstandings snowball with comic
consequences.  But, with a charming and witty script from Peter Morgan
and some deft direction, the idea actually comes off.  The film's
structure is occasionally a little clumsy in the early stages, but
once it hits its stride The Very Thought Of You becomes an intriguing
little tale of friendship, love and deceit.  Nicholas Hamm directs in
a suitably light manner that keeps the film bubbling along.</P>
<P>Fiennes, who injected the sex appeal into the Elizabethan era
in his two previous period films, slots perfectly into this more
contemporary setting.  He smoulders his way across the screen, and his
sympathetic performance here builds upon his previous solid credits.
Potter (recently seen as the romantic interest in Patch Adams) looks a
lot like a younger version of Julia Roberts, and she brings much of
the same beguiling charm and screen presence to her role.  The pair
develop a wonderful chemistry that lifts the film whenever they are on
screen together.</P>
<P>Sewell has a glum and brooding presence, and he seems a little
too intense for his role.  Hollander brings some humour to his
performance as the self-obsessed, obnoxious and immature Daniel.</P>
<P>The choice between these three lovesick lads would seem pretty
obvious, although Hamm manages to stretch out the suspense.  Hamm also
brings London to life, beautifully using the city as a backdrop to the
action.</P>
<P>The film's title is pretty clunky, and only marginally better
than the original, awkward, but far more revealing Martha - Meet
Frank, Daniel & Laurence, which says it all, really.</P>
