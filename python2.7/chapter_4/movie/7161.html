<P>I suspect Peter Jackson's latest offering will mark a division between
his fans.  There will be those who accuse him of copping out with a
commercial soft sell (Michael J. Fox?  In a Peter Jackson movie??) and
there will be others happy to see the larrikin New Zealand film-maker
getting his foot in the Hollywood door.</P>
<P>Jackson and co-writer Fran Walsh (who'd collaborated with him on his
earlier film HEAVENLY CREATURES) have thrown together a grab-bag of
ideas for this big-budget comic thriller.   Fox plays Frank Bannister,
a conman who makes his living performing fake psychic cleansings
house-to-house in the small coastal town of Fairwater.  He is aided in
his work by three less-than-enthusiastic spirits who are awaiting
their crossover to the `other side'.  Apart from an unrecognizable
John Astin, this ghostly trio doesn't provide as many laughs as they
should, and Fox's familiar mannerisms don't promise to lift THE
FRIGHTENERS much above the level of a ho-hum supernatural sitcom.  But
not all is lost.  Jackson soon shifts gears, and as things begin to
get serious, so does Fox - his performance improves as the movie goes
on.  Oddball characters begin to spring out of the woodwork (notably
an unhinged FBI agent played by Jeffrey Combs), and the plot takes new
turns:  Bannister is trying to help nominal love interest Lucy (Trini
Alvarado) cope with the recent death of her husband;  Lucy is trying
to help a housebound woman (Dee Wallace Stone) escape from her
domineering mother; the local sheriff is trying to find the cause of a
series of fatal heart attacks plaguing the town; FBI agent Milton
Dammers is trying to pin the blame for these on Bannister.  At the
core of all this is a mysterious dark figure, at first glance the Grim
Reaper (marvelously realized as a furious, flapping streak of robes),
that is causing murder and mayhem throughout Fairwater.  It's up to
Bannister, of course, to stop it.</P>
<P>The most impressive thing about THE FRIGHTENERS is the amount that
Jackson has managed to stuff into it.  In fact there is almost too
much of everything: plot, laughs, suspense, special effects, action,
imagination.  Its only puzzle is why, ultimately, it fails to impress.
 The fans of Jackson's earlier films BAD TASTE and BRAIN DEAD will be
disappointed that his gore has now become computer-generated; fans of
HEAVENLY CREATURES will no doubt see his new film as a step backward
to his splatter days.  But for every weak moment there is a
directorial flourish that compensates (one of my favorites is a wild
scene in a cemetery where all four protagonists are fighting each
other off simultaneously); and who would have believed that a film
touted as a  comedy could contain a sequence as chilling as the one in
which Bannister relives flashbacks of a mass murder?  It is best,
perhaps, to think of THE FRIGHTENERS as Jackson's Ghost Train.  It is
an amusement park ride of a movie, although one tailored to the
director's own tastes.  As Jackson himself laughs it off, "I went to
Hollywood to make a movie, and I blew it".  It's obvious that he saw
his chance to grab the brass ring, and made the most of the ride while
he could.  As should any prospective audience of his new movie.</P>
