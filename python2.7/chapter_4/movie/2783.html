<PRE>                                 THE MASK
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     THE MASK is a remarkably enjoyable film, for a movie without much
of a plot or characters.  What it does have is Jim Carrey, who is very
fresh and exciting (though he seems to be using up his talent in the
fastest possible way), Cameron Diaz as this year's full-lipped object
of desire, and a remarkable blend of morphing and cartoon-like special
effects.  Also a cute dog.  What more could you ask for?</P>
<P>     Carrey plays a nebbish accounts exec at a bank who finds a mask
which has a mysterious power to transform him into a cross between a
superhero and, well, Jim Carrey.  The gag works pretty well, because it
fits Carreys style so well and allows him to make a film out of
outrageous impersonations.</P>
<P>     I thought the musical numbers were great, especially "Cuban
Pete."  I still find myself recalling the wonderful transition when
"Pete"'s mysterious power takes hold of the female cop and she joins
in.  It's a thrilling sequence.  These bits are somehow exactly how
those dance sequences should have been done all along--with the
appropriate super-real enhancements.  At these moments, and in the
final confrontation, the movie becomes a work of real, hilarious,
vision.</P>
<P>     But most of the time, while we're waiting for Carrey to get hold
of the mask (which transforms him into a kind of super-hero) we're just
waiting, and even Jim Carrey can't think of much to do with this very
weak script and shallow direction.  The Carrey-Diaz romance is no
diversion; when Diaz is around him she seems to undergo a reverse
transformation and change into a nice but conventional neighborhood
girl.</P>
<P>     As they say, let's see how Carrey does in a good film.  The
problem is that many comics never get that good film (or only get one
or two out of a career of far too many movies)--they end up being
exploited in one bad movie after another until their audience shrinks
to nothing and they disappear.  Think of Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor,
Gene Wilder.  What works is to transition into another genre of film
(like Eddie Murphy action films); Carrey better get moving soon if he
wants to still be making films in 1996.</P>
