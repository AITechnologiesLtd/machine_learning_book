<PRE>American Psycho (7/10)</PRE>
<P>Some outraged self-appointed guardians of public morals have been
getting their knickers in a twist about the very idea of a film being
made of Bret Easton Ellis's novel, with its reputation (apparently well-
deserved) for stomach-turning descriptions of violence, often against
women. Now that we can see the film itself, this outcry seems rather
silly, because instead of a puke-inducing gore-fest, what we get is a
dark satire on the 1980s with not much on-screen violence. Thanks to the
screenplay co-written by Guinevere Turner and director Mary Harron, the
film is also a very funny critique of men and their vanities, while
shaming them for their treatment of women as possessions. American
Psycho is a slasher movie with the slashing taken out and feminist
analysis put in. The audience's expectation of violence is cleverly
exploited in the opening credits, and similar teasing takes place in the
film's use of a clip from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Blood-and-guts
fans will be very disappointed.</P>
<P>Christian Bale is very impressive as psycho super-yuppie Patrick Bateman
- a master of the universe who has a fabulous job doing... well... very
little, it seems, except arranging his social calendar. Bateman and his
fellow ubermenschen are not materialists in the sense that they value
possessions, but their lives revolve around appearance and one-
upmanship. Bateman's narration details, with a complete lack of irony,
the various body scrubs and facial creams he uses as he performs his
morning grooming and workout routine. This stuff is important to him.
Rather than comparing penises, these men express superiority over one
another by their relative ability to book a table at this week's
fashionable eatery. The best scene in the film occurs when Bateman and
his friends, if friends they are, compare business cards and the bottom
falls out of Bateman's world when he realises that a colleague's card is
classier than his.</P>
<P>Bateman's scary shallowness is also demonstrated in the scenes in which
he prepares to indulge in murder or joyless professional sex by giving
those he is about to butcher or bed an admiring and pseudo-intellectual
analysis of the music of Whitney Houston, Phil Collins or Huey Lewis and
The News. It's hilarious stuff, but will audiences today get it? Tom
Wolfe satirised the 80s in The Bonfire of the Vanities, but he did it
before the decade was over. A typical movie-goer in his or her mid
twenties would have been ten years old in the mid eighties, so might be
too young to have the appropriate cultural reference points. Too young
to remember the 80s. What a thought.</P>
<P>The film's ending leaves things confused and unresolved. I have no
problem with ambiguous endings, and I do not know whether the ending is
taken from the source novel, but the trick anti-resolution to this
thinly-plotted movie was a big let-down. After my initial confusion at
the end of the film, there is only one explanation that seems to make
sense, and it's a complete cop-out.</P>
<P>American Psycho is a fine satire wrapped up in a mediocre thriller. And
it seems to have a commercial problem: the people who would probably get
most out of it are the very people who would be least likely to want to
see it. The marketing boys have done nothing to address this problem and
if the movie bombs, it's they who should get chopped into little pieces. </P>
