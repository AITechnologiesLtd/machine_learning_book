<P>     While it would be unfair to pigeonhole the entire French film 
industry with one sweeping statement, it is true that when the American 
public thinks of a French film, something like BEAUMARCHAIS, THE 
SCOUNDREL frequently comes to mind.  An impeccably-acted costume drama, 
this film transports us back in time more than two centuries to a France 
where growing social unrest is soon to doom the Bourbon monarchy.  The 
movie essays approximately ten years in the life of playwright Pierre-
Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais (Fabrice Luchini), the celebrated author 
of "The Barber of Seville" and "The Marriage of Figaro".  The film is, 
by turns, an adventure, a dissection of the creative process, and a 
social commentary.  Through it all, one thing remains constant:  the 
script, by director Edouard Molinaro and Jean-Claude Brisville, refuses 
to relinquish its grasp on a tongue-in-cheek approach.</P>
<P>     Molinaro is no stranger to films with a humorous edge – his LA CAGE 
AUX FOLLES took a serious theme and cleverly concealed it in a 
screenplay that was rich in comedy.  BEAUMARCHAIS isn't as openly funny, 
but a constant sense of wit and satire underlies the production.  One 
prominent reason for this is Fabrice Luchini's breezy performance, which 
depicts the title character as a likable rogue who, despite spending a 
lot of time in prison and suffering several significant lifestyle blows, 
never takes things too seriously.  Beaumarchais may be a scoundrel, but 
he's the sort that it's easy to sympathize with.</P>
<P>     BEAUMARCHAIS opens with a rehearsal of "The Barber of Seville" (in 
1773) and closes with a performance of "The Marriage of Figaro."  In 
between, Beaumarchais undergoes a series of adventures, including a trip 
to England as a secret agent and an association with America as an arms 
dealer.  The latter earns him the praise of Benjamin Franklin and a 
letter of heartfelt thanks from the Congress of the United States, but 
not the financial riches Beaumarchais had hoped for.  He has dealings 
with both Louis XV and his successor, Louis XVI, yet remains a popular 
figure with the masses because of his incessant attacks on the Court of 
Lords.  Though he travels in the circles of the pampered and privileged, 
and enjoys the patronage of a prince, Beaumarchais' sympathies are 
clearly with the common man.  At one point, he presages what is to come 
with a simple statement:  "Paris is dangerous.  Too much poverty.  Too 
many taxes."</P>
<P>     Two other, lesser characters wend their way throughout the entire 
narrative.  The first is Beaumarchais' devoted protégé and would-be 
biographer, Gudin (Manuel Blanc), a handsome young man who comes to 
Paris to work as an aide to the man he views as the world's greatest 
writer.  He learns, to his disappointment, that while Beaumarchais has a 
talent for writing, his energy is often expended elsewhere.  Then 
there's Marie-Therese (Sandrine Kiberlain, of A SELF-MADE HERO), 
Beaumarchais' devoted third wife, who remains by his side even while 
aware of his many sexual indiscretions.  Many of the smaller, supporting 
roles are played by well-known actors.  Michael Serrault is Louis XV, 
Jean-Claude Brialy is a priest, and Michel Piccoli is the Prince de 
Conti.</P>
<P>     What BEAUMARCHAIS, THE SCOUNDREL does best is to convey a sense of 
the era in which it transpires without drowning the audience in the 
ponderousness that often accompanies period pieces.  BEAUMARCHAIS is 
very much a light film, like last year's RIDICULE or the as-yet-
undistributed MARQUISE, yet it is not without substance.  Beaumarchais' 
exchanges with Gudin explore the process of synthesis and compromise by 
which great art comes into being (there is a fascinating scene in which 
Beaumarchais nervously reads through "The Marriage of Figaro" before a 
group of censors).  And, overshadowing all, is the growing feeling of 
political unrest.  In viewing BEAUMARCHAIS, we are looking at the 
twilight of France's monarchy, which would fall five years after the 
film's end.</P>
<P>     Unlike many American period pieces, French films tend to stick 
close to the facts. Beaumarchais' adventures, while fleshed out by 
Molinaro, are contained in the historical record.  As a result, 
BEAUMARCHAIS, THE SCOUNDREL functions as an episodic biography of ten 
critical years in the writer's life, as well as a superficial overview 
of a segment of European history.  This isn't a great film – it is 
occasionally disjointed and lacks an ambitious scope – but it is 
entertaining, especially for those who have an appreciation for one of 
the best-known products of French film makers:  the costume drama.</P>
