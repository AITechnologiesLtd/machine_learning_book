<P>starring Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman, J.E. Freeman
written by Joss Whedon
directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet</P>
<P>The title has a double meaning. In this fourth installment of the
series, not only do producers David Giler and Walter Hill revive their
beloved Ellen Ripley (Weaver), who met her fate last time around, but
they attempt to resurrect the franchise itself: the financial unsuccess
of Alien3 was thought to have killed it.</P>
<P>You can't keep a good monster down. Unfortunately. What was a wonderful,
complete trilogy is now a quadrology that ends with the promise of more,
and if this resurrection is any indication, I'm talking about a series
in decline.</P>
<P>The premise is this: Ripley is revived through genetic cloning on a
military ship. A band of ne'er-do-wells arrive on said ship for a cargo
transfer. One of them, Call (Ryder), fears Ripley when they meet, for
she is aware that the clone is part-alien. What she is not aware of are
the twelve aliens also aboard the vessel-military doctors are trying to
teach the monsters good manners. Must I write that the experiment goes
awry?</P>
<P>Jeunet, famed French director of `Delicatessan', has tried to combine
the spirits of the second and third films. `Resurrection' is artfully
made, aesthetically pretty like David Fincher(`Seven')'s part three, and
it contains some rousing gun play and chase sequences, as in James
Cameron's `Aliens'. But I get the sense that Jeunet's language
difference presented great problems in his assessment of the script,
which is half-baked and desperately familiar. For example, he casts
several colourful-looking people in supporting roles only to hand them
the kind of dialogue you'd hear in `Independence Day'. They're unique
ducks in the same shooting gallery we've been to three times before. And
the alien logic has worn thin-I never did understand which one was
laying eggs, or why this was happening since the script went to great
pains explaining that the queen now had a womb.</P>
<P>Turn off the sound and one is left with a stunning motion picture, a two
hour Romantic painting. The effects are impressive, and there is one
dazzling, showstopping setpiece (involving swimming aliens). But great
art direction does not equal great filmmaking, and therein lies the
problem: the most basic movie element--the screenplay--is still the most
important, and `Alien: Resurrection' made me nostalgic for the original
trilogy, which is not what a sequel should do.
