<PRE>Girl on the Bridge (La fille sur le pont)
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright © 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>It's always rewarding to find in today's cinema a stark reminder of how
powerful the emotion of love can alter perception, reality, and reason
within a person.  Girl on the Bridge (La fille sur le pont) is one of
those stark reminders, a brutally grim and honest film of unacquainted
desire and the fearful reservations that follow two individuals looking
for that unattainable completion of one's faith and one's heart.</P>
<P>This disturbing and brilliant new film by renowned French filmmaker
Patrice Leconte - director of such films as Monsieur Hire, The
Hairdresser's Husband, and Ridicule - follows the tale of Adele, a
lovelorn girl who has been through too many one night stands and
promises of purposes.  She remarks in an unflinching five-minute opening
monologue, "I see my future like a waiting room in a train station, and
I sit there waiting for something to happen."  In this grim monologue,
the director Leconte portrays Adele, played with striking beauty and
prose by French singer Vanessa Paradis, as neither a slut nor a vixen
but as an emotionally confused girl who doesn't understand the
difference between love and sex.</P>
<P>Later, Adele ends up later that night on the edge of a bridge
overlooking the Seine, contemplating the murky waters below.  From the
darkness appears an older man named Gabor, played by the great French
actor Daniel Auteuil, a knife-throwing expert in need of an assistant
for his performances.  He tries to persuade Adele from jumping but she
ends up in the river; naturally, he saves her.  While in the hospital,
Gabor convinces Adele that her luck is changing by demonstrating his
extrasensory talents.  She joins him as his assistant, and during their
first performance, Adele develops a telepathic link with Gabor that
directs his blades.</P>
<P>Their journey continues to places such as Monaco and San Reno as Adele
and Gabor use their clairvoyance to win big at casinos and amaze
audiences with the knife-throwing performances.  But their relationship
sours because of the attention Adele gets, and the film gets more
disturbing from there.</P>
<P>Director Patrice Leconte chose the shoot the film in black and white to
add to the timelessness of the picture.  He also chose a variety of
music, such as Benny Goodman, Marianne Faithful, Brenda Lee, and the
Istanbul Oriental Ensemble, to make the movie sound quite diverse.  The
tight dialogue follows a solid pattern of delivering poignancy with the
pretensions of the subject matter as Adele and Gabor subconsciousness
move towards each other's hearts and minds.  The telepathic connection
between the characters is handled with conviction and makes you believe
that the link is solely derived from the unity of the two minds and
hearts.</P>
<P>The film also holds distinct elements of a dream state.  The first
moments of the film give ground for interpretation that the mysteries
and travels of Adele are in fact the fantasies of a lonely and depressed
girl looking for something, anything in this world.  The direct honesty
of Gabor and his unadulterated feelings for Adele seem to reach out to
the audience and pull them into the complexity of his love and desire
for this woman.  His words are brutal but fair and demand no sympathy
from Adele.</P>
<P>Admittedly, French cinema is a tough beast to understand.  The stark
dialogue is uncommon in American cinema and the development of
characters is sometimes without a roadmap and lacks the emotional
shortcuts of Hollywood.  Good French cinema is powerful and demands your
attention for full appreciation.  Give Girl on the Bridge all of your
mind.</P>
