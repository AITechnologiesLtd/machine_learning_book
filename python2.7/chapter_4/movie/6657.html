<PRE>                         THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     What a huge gamble, to make a movie about "Hustler" magazine
founder and die-hard porn king Larry Flynt and his turbulent life.</P>
<P>     Whether or not it's successful, the filmmakers deserve every bit of
praise for having the guts to make a movie like this, especially in an
age where Washington constantly cries foul over Hollywood's depictions
of sex and violence.  And believe me, THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT has
plenty of both.</P>
<P>     Following Flynt's (Woody Harrelson) life from juvenile Kentucky
moonshiner to Ohio strip joint owner to the multi-millionaire ruler of a
publishing empire, the film lays out the facts and doesn't make any
judgments.  Instead, we are invited to decide for ourselves, as the
movie turns around Flynt's almost perpetual run-ins with the law, with
anti-porn crusaders like Jerry Falwell and Charles Keating, and folds in
Flynt's loving (and kinda sick) relationship with his wife Althea
(Courtney Love).</P>
<P>     The biggest surprise in FLYNT is a five-star performance by
Harrelson.  After a series of idiotic movies like INDECENT PROPOSAL and
MONEY TRAIN, who knew there was an actual *actor* under there?  Edward
Norton also redeems himself from the boneheaded PRIMAL FEAR, playing
Flynt's long-suffering attorney Isaacman.  Again, another pleasant
surprise.</P>
<P>     But what truly baffles me is how Harrelson's finest hour is being
overshadowed in the press by the performance of Courtney Love, who is
undoubtedly one of the worst actresses I've ever seen, even in a role
that was custom-made for her meager talents.  That Love is perfectly
credible as a stripper/drug addict is no surprise; it's her credibility
as an actress (i.e. when she opens her mouth) that is more difficult to
swallow, and it is her laughable performance that almost manages to
topple FLYNT from greatness.  I can only assume that people are
confusing acting ability with a good makeup job.</P>
<P>     LARRY FLYNT is not particularly well-written, glossing over a ton
of details, often favoring shock value to storytelling.  Considering
this is the life of Larry Flynt, you can't really fault the writers for
this, but the linear plot progression often feels incidental to the rest
of the picture.  Still, Flynt's story is compelling enough to provide
its own momentum, and with Milos Forman (AMADEUS) behind the camera, it
does.</P>
<P>     As to whether Flynt is a crusader for freedom or the Anti-Christ,
you'll have to draw your own conclusion.  In the meantime, here's
something to think about:  Why is the movie called THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY
FLYNT when the big case in the film is Flynt vs. Falwell?  Discuss
amongst yourselves.</P>
