                          BACK TO THE FUTURE III
                            [Probable Spoilers]
                          Reviewer: Jaye Mathisen
                        Copyright 1990 Jaye Mathisen</PRE>
<PRE>     Summary:
          Marty and Doc take on the wild west, in a final
          attempt to set all the various timelines aright.
          This film is much lighter then BTTF II, and most
          certainly more enjoyable.</PRE>
<P>     Marty and Doc do their level best to make the Universe safe for non
time-travelers.  All the old characters, including Biff are back in new
roles, along with the old ones.</P>
<P>     I really liked this movie.  Almost as much as I liked part one.
Sure, Marty and Doc don't resolve all the paradoxes that
occurred/might have occurred from the jumping about through the
space-time continuum, but they have a lot of fun doing it, and so did I.</P>
<P>     Doc is at his zaniest best, from the gigantic ice-tea making
machine, to the telescope strapped to his rifle.  And of course, to make
it complicated, Doc's gotta meet a girl (Mary Steenburgen, another
fave).</P>
<P>     Mad Dog (Biff) is truly the epitome of the old-west sleazoids.
However, there was one oddity about Mad Dog.  Doc and Marty are looking
through a history book, and discover that one of the reasons Mad Dog has
his name is because of his tendency to drool.  Gallons of slobber
dripping off of Mad Dog's chin in the first meeting with Marty must've
been left on the cutting room floor, so Mad Dog's name really didn't
make sense.  But if that's the only thing I can find to complain about,
the movie can't be too shabby.</P>
<P>     The ending is certainly corny, but fun.  It certainly looks like
this is the end of the series, and not much of a chance for any more.
Of course this was a given anyway.</P>
<P>Rating:
     The movie's light, moderately fast-paced, and very enjoyable.  It
     helps to riffle through BTTF II before seeing III, just to refresh
     the old brain cells, as the plot still has its twists and turns.
     The special effects are as good as always, and I almost fell out of
     my seat at the time-traveling steam engine.  I give it 4 stars
     (****,excellent) out of 4.</P>
<P>Enjoyability
     All the above.  Don't miss it, it's great fun.  4 stars again.</P>
