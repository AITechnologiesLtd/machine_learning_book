<PRE>                                 NICK OF TIME
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1995) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        As Perot would say, this is just sa-a-a-a-ad. NICK OF TIME 
openly rips off Hitchcock by exploiting the fact that it is filmed in 
"real time" (that is, one screen minute equals one real life minute -- no 
cutting to later that day or two weeks later), but it's all boring enough 
that it resembles life's real time. I've already written about movies that</P>
<P>are boring and padded and still only ninety minutes long and NICK 
OF TIME is definitely one of those. It could have been an hour-long 
episode of any one of the "Playhouse" shows of the 50's and 60's or 
maybe a half-hour tale from the crypt today.</P>
<P>        The film opens with a giant closeup of a clock. Get used to 
that image because you'll see at least fifty others before NICK OF 
TIME is over. The director constantly and needlessly shoves the 
real-time thing in our faces and -- you know what? -- it isn't even 
accurate. By the time the movie clock goes from 12:00 to 1:30pm, 
only seventy-six minutes have passed. So much for the integrity 
of "real time."</P>
<P>        Johnny Depp plays a CPA who is unwillingly drawn into a 
murder conspiracy as Christopher Walken approaches him and his 
young daughter in a bus station, flashing a badge and asking in his 
usual creepy tone if Depp will accompany him to his van. He does 
and, once he gets there, he discovers his daughter will be held 
hostage by Walken's accomplice until Depp assassinates the 
governor. Any attempt to tell the police or anyone else about 
his dilemma will bring instant death to his daughter.</P>
<P>        So, for the next hour or so, Depp wanders aimlessly around 
a hotel with gun in pocket, making repeated attempts to tell people 
his "big problem," after which Walken will pop up and remind him 
his daughter will die if he doesn't kill the governor by 1:30. Soon 
enough, we discover almost everyone in the governor's administration 
is in on the conspiracy, which raises an inevitable question. If people 
on the inside are involved in this, why wouldn't one of them 
orchestrate the murder himself instead of having Walken find 
a guy off the street to kill her? I mean, if it was just Walken and 
his accomplice acting out some terrorist fantasy, it would make 
sense, but if the governor's own husband wants her dead, he can 
find a way to do it and make it look like an accident. But then we 
wouldn't have a plot, would we?</P>
<P>        NICK OF TIME mixes a gimmick and premise that could 
have worked incredibly well together and instead drives it into the 
ground by showing us a lot of nothing. The whole movie is basically 
Depp wandering around aimlessly with Walken in the background, 
making sure he doesn't go to the police. And those closeups of the 
clock get old fast. As far as the whole time metaphor goes, I'd only 
suggest watching NICK OF TIME on the October night we turn our 
clocks back. That way, you'll only waste half-an-hour on this lifeless 
thriller instead of the full ninety minutes.</P>
