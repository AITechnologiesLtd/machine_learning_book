<P>PLOT:
A cool guy and a nervous guy break out of jail and begin robbing banks together,
by kidnapping the bank manager on the nights before their robberies, and getting
them to hand over the money early in the morning. One day, they stumble onto a
woman named Kate, whose life sucks with her husband, and who decides to latch on
to these outlaws. It isn't long before each of the boys has a crush on her, and
their life on the run gets more complicated.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Very ho-hum. This movie isn't about anything original, so that's out the window.
The trailer makes it look funny, but after having seen the movie, I can
guarantee you, it's not a comedy, so let's drop that to the side. The dramatic
elements in the film are few and far between, and to be honest, not all that
interesting either. So that's in the sack. Hmmmm...what else? Oh yeah, the
acting...yes, that's pretty good, but nothing extra-ordinary. So what the hell
is it about this 2-hour movie that makes it worth seeing, you might be asking
yourself? Well, not too much according to me, and you can definitely skip it in
the theatres, because there ain't much here in which you should invest your
hard-earned bucks. Rent it on video, you ask? Sure, it's a decent time-spender
(that is, if you have two hours to kill and don't mind slowly prodding through
this thing) and the opening jail break-out scene is pretty cool, the ending
surprising (although pretty unbelievable) and Billy Bob Thornton, a joy to
watch. But the basic idea behind the film is played out after the first half
hour and the film just goes into major "re-dial" mode soon after that. Alright,
we get it, they're "clever" bank robbers who found a unique way to rob
banks...but what else?!? Is a love triangle really worthy of another plot-line?
Not really. I thought the film was supposed to be about these bank-robbers
(hence, the title), but most of the time, it seemed to rotate around this whole
three-way love tryst, and it rarely stimulated anything original, engaging or
interesting in that respect.</P>
<P>Sure, Cate Blanchett is fun in her role, but how many dysfunctional people can
you fit inside a movie before you lose any true relation to them and stop giving
a crap? I was sorta into this movie the whole way through but it just dragged on
for too long, went over the same things over and over again, and didn't really
have much of a point or entertainment value to it. And what's with all of the
characters being strangely abnormal? Willis' cousin in the movie seems to start
off as a "goofball" but progresses into a full-blown mentally-challenged
individual by the end of the movie. Was that done on purpose or was he just
over-playing his stupidity role? Also, why was his lame little sub-plot in the
film at all...or that bogus "America's Most Wanted"-type TV show? (this was
parodied in NATURAL BORN KILLERS back in 1994, guys...give it a rest!) So why am
I even giving this film that high of a rating? Well, I really dug Thornton's
hypochondriac character and Blanchett is generally pretty solid in anything she
does. I also liked the opening and ending sequences, the latter fooling me into
believing something that wasn't there, and I also enjoyed most of the banter
between Willis and Thornton. But overall, the film goes on for too long, doesn't
bring much originality to the "bank robbing" movie motif and rarely cracked me
up (but comedy is a very subjective thing, so it might just tickle your funny
bone). So are you bored and interesting in seeing a so-so movie in the comfort
of your own house? Look no further, this generic flick might just be the ideal
rental for your basic needs. Now is that a hearty recommendation or what?!? </P>
