<P>     I'm willing to forgive NEVER BEEN KISSED many of its failings
because, for all practical purposes, it's a fantasy.  I can over look the
irony of a film about an adult returning to interact with teenagers which
portray teens the same inane way adults usually think of them.  I can let
it slide that the tone is terminally bubbly when a touch of venom might
have helped.  I can even shrug my shoulders at the notion that Drew
Barrymore was ever a spat-upon teen wretch.  Sometimes a romantic comedy
can get away with being ridiculous as it strives to pull us into its wish
fulfillment.  What it can't get away with is being lazy or being miscast,
the two blunders that insure NEVER BEEN KISSED never had a chance.</P>
<P>     Our high-concept premise finds 25-year-old Chicago Sun-Times copy
editor Josie Geller (Barrymore) offered her first real reporting
assignment:  going undercover as a high school student.  The assignment
brings mixed emotions for Josie, a brainy high school outcast still
smarting from her adolescent ostracism.  As she begins her quest for a
story, Josie finds herself drawn back into the world of the "smart kids"
at South Glen South High School, including her new friend Aldys (Leelee
Sobieski).  That's before her editor (John C. Reilly) demands that Josie
get in with the in crowd, and before Josie's arrested adolescent
23-year-old brother Rob (David Arquette) also re-enrolls and helps turn
the one-time "Josie Grossie" into a potential prom queen.</P>
<P>     NEVER BEEN KISSED does a serviceable job of telling Josie's story,
exploring how a woman comes to terms with the person she was and is.  If
only the script had shown as much dilligence with the other elements.
Arquette's character is potentially even more interesting than Barrymore's
-- a jock who peaked at 18 trying to re-live his glory days -- but it's
generally watered-down and ignored.  The romantic angle between Josie and
her English teacher (Michael Vartan) is half-heartedly developed, muddles
the entire point of the story -- are we supposed to believe that Josie was
incapable of finding true love before re-creating her traumatic youth? --
and builds to a spectacularly clumsy conclusion.  Most depressing of all
is a ghastly device which finds Josie wearing a miniature camera,
contributing nothing more to the story than pointless cutaways to Josie's
co-workers gaping or cringing in embarrassment.</P>
<P>     There's plenty to gape and cringe at as Barrymore plays Josie.
You've got to admire how gamely Barrymore subjects herself to humiliating
situations, but she's all wrong for the lead role in her first feature as
executive producer.  Even the marketing people at Fox realize that she's
most appealing as a sweet object of desire, making the central image in
the film's publicity a photo of Barrymore smiling coquettishly with knee
drawn up to her chest.  As a star carrying this film, she looks out of her
depth.  It's slightly embarrassing watching her play the professional
Josie as a tightly-coiffed fussbudget correcting everyone's grammar and
usage; as implausible as she may be as a high school senior, she proves
even more implausible as a grown-up.</P>
<P>     You always want to like a film as good-natured as NEVER BEEN KISSED,
even though it wants so much to be liked.  There simply isn't a nuance to
the material that director Raja Gosnell manages to capture, not a moment
of sincere emotion, nothing that doesn't look like it wouldn't exist if
not for other movies about kids in high school.  When the script manages
to work in a wise observation -- like the idea that one popular person in
high school can dictate who's cool and who's not -- it feels like someone
tripped over it accidentally.  NEVER BEEN KISSED is most certainly a
fantasy for anyone who ever felt like the quintessential high school
outsider, but the film-makers are living in a fantasy world if they think
that's all they need to deliver.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 kissed opportunities:  4.</PRE>
