                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>GOLDFINGER (1964) ***1/2</PRE>
<P>        Here it is, the best James Bond movie out there, with 
DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER coming in a close second. It just makes 
me wonder why all the Sean Connery movies in the series couldn't be 
like this. The first two weren't (DR. NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH 
LOVE) and the two after this certainly weren't (THUNDERBALL and 
YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE). The formula that's utilized in all the 
other 007 films--death traps, chases, explosions, intriguing villains 
with plans for world conquest, girls, girls, girls--click together 
especially well here, making it the standout episode of the series.</P>
<P>        Goldfinger is certainly an intriguing villain. He's a roly-poly 
fat guy on the surface who has millions in gold bullion yet gets off on 
conning people for relatively small amounts. In the beginning of the 
movie, he has his secretary watch a card game through binoculars and 
tell him over a radio transmitter what cards the other man is holding. 
Bond thwarts that racket and later takes Goldfinger for five thousand 
pounds by utilizing some trickery of his own to win a game of golf. 
Goldfinger gets him back by capturing Bond halfway through the 
movie and taking him back to his hideout, where he tells him all about 
his plan to loot the gold reserve at Fort Knox. That's always the single 
biggest mistake of Bond villains--the inability to keep their damn 
mouths shut.</P>
<P>        Bond remains in captivity for the second half of the movie, 
mingling with other memorable villains on the Goldfinger compound 
as he repeatedly tries to escape. There's Oddjob, a beefy Korean who 
never talks, choosing instead to express himself through decapitating 
people by using his tophat as a frisbee. And, of course, there's Pussy 
Galore (That phrase, incidentally, also represents James Bond's main 
goal in life.), a sexy airplane pilot who is probably the only woman 
who has the balls (Wait a minute, you can't say someone named Pussy 
has balls. Let's change that to "guts.") to resist Bond's advances. He 
soon changes her mind, though, by forcing himself on her and making 
her his third conquest of the movie. Could the 60's have been a more 
groovy decade?</P>
<P>        GOLDFINGER takes the already-worn Bond formula to new 
levels. The death trap where a laser is advancing toward Bond's crotch 
(the Vasectomy of DEATH!) is one of the most tense scenes in the 
series, as is the movie's climax, involving Bond, an atomic bomb and a 
pair of handcuffs (which just happened to be left over from Bond's date 
the night before). While other 007 movies utilizing these elements 
have come off looking campy and ridiculous, this one works almost all 
the time. Well, there is a scene in the movie where planes drop nerve 
gas on an entire army and they all fall over simultaneously, but you 
have to give the director credit for trying.</P>
