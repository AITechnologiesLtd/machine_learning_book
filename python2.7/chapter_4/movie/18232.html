<P>Starring Matthew Broderick, Reese Witherspoon, Chris Klein. Rated R.</P>
<P>It comes as a walloping disappointment to moi that Election is being
actively marketed as the latest derivative teen flick. Derivative it
ain't, and it isn't a teen flick either, although mature teenagers are
likely to enjoy it. Instead it is a brilliant, biting satire about
crossing the very boundaries of dignity and sacrificing one's career for
something one believes in -- or thinks he believes in.</P>
<P>Matthey Broderick, whom I have never really appreciated as an actor (not
even in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which I think deserves to be a
classic) finally takes a step in the direction of thespianism. He plays
Jim McCallister, an extraordinary teacher who truly loves his job, loves
his profession, loves his life. His legacy and image are virtually
unscathed, until the latest Student Council Election comes along. You
see, there's this girl named Tracy Flick. She's your perfect example of
a know-it-all over-achiever -- she's the kind of student that is often
the only one to know the answer, leaving the teacher desperately looking
for another student to call on. Tracy is a member of every committee
imaginable; she spends long hours and weekends working on school
projects.</P>
<P>McCallister loathes her with all his heart. Perhaps he is jealous,
perhaps he is simply annoyed by her, but either way when she runs
unopposed for Student Council President, he can't stand to see her win.
He dreads that someday someone like her will rule the country. He is
afraid to imagine what it will be like then. The only thing to do for
him, it seems, is to launch a counter campaign. He singles out Paul
Metzler, a good, popular, albeit slightly slow guy to run against Tracy.
Unfortunately his anger soon leads him to go much farther than that to
prevent Tracy Flick from becoming the next Student Council Prez.</P>
<P>If satire is simply a witty exaggeration of ordinary events, then this
is satire at its brightest. Besides being an effective political satire,
this can be viewed as an affectionate take on what can happen when a
student becomes the pet peeve of an important teacher. But underneath
this is also a serious movie, one about sacrifice and revenge and it
works like a gem, emotionally sincere as well as scathingly funny.</P>
<P>Broderick is brilliant; his character is unabashedly subversive but he
makes him touchingly and unsentimentally sympathetic as well. I look
forward to Broderick doing more movies like this one (unfortunately, his
next project is Inspector Gadget). Reese Witherspoon (Pleasantville) is
not quite as effective, but she does a decent job as well, although
realism isn't one of her strong points in this one.</P>
<P>Those who argue that Election is morally depraved because it puts the
perfectionist Tracy in a bad light are missing the point by a mile.
That's not what this movie is about. It's about anger, it's about
revenge, it's about obsession. Director Alexander Payne's movie is about
important and significant things, and is above and beyond caring whether
it offends a select group of people who have no reason to be offended.</P>
<P>I love this movie. It's a satire that blends hilarity with resonant (but
not overwhelming) moral statements. It's brutal, it's funny, it's
brilliant.
