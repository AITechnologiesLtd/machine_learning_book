<PRE>RUBY CAIRO (1993)
(DECEPTION)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>In the last decade quality of Hollywood films declined, and
that phenomenon didn't manifest itself solely in the realms
of the finished products. Even the promotional trailers were
getting worse with time, and movie advertising became as bad
as the movies themselves. One of the rare films that should
pride itself with exceptional state-of-the-art trailer is
RUBY CAIRO, 1993 adventure thriller directed by Graeme
Clifford.</P>
<P>The heroine of this film is Bessie Faro (played by Andie
MacDowell), mother of three children and wife of Johnny Faro
(played by Viggo Mortensen), owner of air cargo company.
Bessie's idyllic life starts to fall apart when she gets a
word about her husband dying in air crash and the company
going bankrupt. In Vera Cruz she finds that her husband
actually stashed large sums of money on various off-shore
accounts. Using her husband's baseball cards as the only
clue she starts travelling across the world trying to
retrieve those funds. However, in some cases someone is
always one step ahead, emptying those accounts. The trail
leads Bessie to Cairo, where she would receive assistance by
Fergus Larb (played by Liam Neeson), humanitarian pilot who
would lead her to the unexpected discovery.</P>
<P>The trailer for RUBY CAIRO is a masterpiece of movie
advertising because it suggests an exciting and interesting
thriller set in exotic locations. In reality, RUBY CAIRO is
mostly disorganised mess of a movie, with contrived and not
very believable plot and mostly disinterested cast members,
especially Liam Neeson in tragically undeveloped role. Among
many other things, the subplot involving baseball cards is
going to be incomprehensible for most of the audience that
lives outside USA. On the other hand, Graeme Clifford tries
to compensate inadequacies of the content with style. The
movie features truly impressive shots of exotic Egyptian
locations, and the musical score by John Barry would remind
viewers of Bond movies, especially THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.
However, apart from providing some interesting information
about multi-cultural nature of modern Egypt, RUBY CAIRO
mostly fails to arouse viewers' attention and it is quite
understandable why it sank to oblivion almost immediately
after its production.</P>
