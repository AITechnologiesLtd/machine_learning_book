<PRE>       KISS THE GIRLS
       --------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           GRADE: C+</PRE>
<P>       Imagine, if you like, that SE7EN's Detective Somerset (Morgan
       Freeman) has come out of retirement. He's been drawn back
       into the homicide department by the disappearance of his
       beloved niece. The investigation draws him out of the
       previous film's nameless city to the relative serenity of
       North Carolina's Research Triangle, where he finds that his
       niece's case fits into a pattern of abductions of beautiful
       young women. Three of them have been found dead -- molested
       horribly and left in the woods to be eaten by animals -- but
       Somerset guesses that the others are being held captive by a
       "collector" of some sort. Set on stopping this guy, who has
       taken the vile nom-de-crime of "Casanova," Somerset puts his
       considerable compassion and wisdom to work at cracking the
       case. I guess you could call this fictional movie EIG8T.</P>
<P>       But in a nutshell, that's pretty close to what's going on in
       KISS THE GIRLS. Instead of Somerset, we have Washington,
       D.C.-based forensic psychologist Alex Cross, the protagonist
       from a series of crime novels by bestselling author James
       Patterson. Since he's also given flesh-and-blood presence by
       the formidable Freeman, the film already has echoes of SE7EN,
       which can't hurt since the latter film was a surprise smash
       hit. Even taken on its own, it's hardly a bad idea for a
       movie. Patterson's novel earned wide praise from fans of the
       genre, who praised the novel's characterization and were
       impressed by the story's twists and turns. The movie, I'm
       afraid, is another story.</P>
<PRE>       Blame the screenplay by David Klass, who I suspect made some
       bad decisions in his effort to trim down the original story
       to feature length. The plot is far more complicated than you
       might imagine, involving a bi-coastal investigation and a few
       red herrings. Problem is, in the course of just two hours we
       don't have enough time to process the information we're given
       so that we can be surprised when the movie wants us to be
       surprised. As long as the screenplay is on plot, it's short
       on characterization. Klass may have been better off
       jettisoning the West Coast element of the story -- which
       needlessly complicates the second half of the film -- and
       concentrating instead on beefing up his characters and giving
       us more insight on their emotions.</PRE>
<P>       Fortunately, Klass and director Gary Fleder (the forgettable
       THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD) are blessed with
       fine performances by Freeman and Ashley Judd, two actors who,
       I suspect, were more or less put on autopilot for this one.
       Freeman turns in an expert, off-hand performance that recalls
       the serene wisdom of Somerset. (Freeman's a good enough actor
       that he really doesn't need the early scene where he talks
       the gun out of a suicidal woman's mouth just to demonstrate
       his character's sensitivity and compassion.) Much as I enjoy
       that character, I'd like to see Freeman stretch out a little,
       and here's hoping that I'll get my wish in the next few
       months, when he stars in Steven Spielberg's AMISTAD and the
       not-a-disaster-movie-*really* HARD RAIN.</P>
<PRE>       Judd, cast as the kickboxing Kate McTiernan, is pretty
       ferocious, glomming on tight to her character's resolute
       refusal to be a passive victim, or to let Casanova strike
       again. She's an interning med student who's kidnapped from
       her home by Casanova. It's through her eyes that we're
       introduced to the underground dungeon where he keeps his
       young victims captive (he arranges them in a circle and paws
       them up and down as Cross's niece plays her violin). But this
       one escapes, tearing off through the woods (in a scene right
       out of THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE) and leaping into a
       river. Her memories of what she saw will be key to catching
       Casanova.</PRE>
<P>       As a thriller, KISS THE GIRLS is by the numbers. We've got
       the fish-out-of-water-with-a-badge, a cop who's gone outside
       his jurisdiction because he has a personal stake in the
       investigation. We've got the killer's hidden lair, which the
       cops must discover in a race against time to save his next
       victim. And while the scenes (two of them!) where Kate kicks
       righteous ass without the help of a male rescuer are
       tremendous crowd-pleasers, they're staged without much
       ingenuity. Judd plays Kate strong and smart, but I would have
       liked to have seen more emphasis on the smart. The so-so
       cinematography and catch-as-catch-can editing technique are
       augmented by a distracting sound mix that, if you see the
       movie in digital sound, has those already cliched wooshing
       noises careering through the movie theater in an attempt to
       whip up a sense of unease.</P>
<P>       We've also got the obligatory yucky relationship between
       Casanova and his pretty female victims. Their trauma is only
       hinted at -- I think a better (and probably darker) movie
       might have given us a longer look inside that makeshift
       prison block, and would have forced us to care about the fate
       of those women. (I'm told that the novel included a subplot
       allowing Kate a relationship with one of Casanova's other
       victims that's missing here.) Instead, the movie barely
       acknowledges their pain, and seems only fleetingly concerned
       with fleshing out the character of Casanova (the most
       unsettling insight coes from a scene where we find out that
       he's an Internet geek, swapping photos of his victims by
       email). I wanted to loathe him, but found myself not moved
       much by anything he did. Perhaps ironically, the unconvincing
       treatment of the villain and his deeds makes the movie's
       queasiest touches -- a post-mortem photo of one of the
       victims, badly battered, or the attempted rape scene in the
       final reel -- seem uncomfortably gratuitous, or even
       titillating. For a picture that deals with a sexual
       psychopath who I'd imagine makes Hannibal Lecter look like a
       gentleman, KISS THE GIRLS plays as pretty light
       entertainment.
