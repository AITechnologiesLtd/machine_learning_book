<PRE>                               END OF DAYS
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Here it is, November of 1999, and I thought we weren't going to get
a good end-of-the-world, Satan-conquers-all apocalypse movie (DOGMA
doesn't count).  Whew!  END OF DAYS arrives just in time (no pun
intended) to quench that Linda Blair thirst.</P>
<P>     If you know the basic plot of END OF DAYS (`Satan visits New York
in search of a bride') the question you'll be asking isn't, `Is this a
bad movie?'  Rather, it will probably be, `How bad can it be?'</P>
<P>     Pretty bad.  But for camp value, you aren't going to find a better
bang for the buck than END OF DAYS.  Imagine audiences rolling in the
aisles, talking back to the screen, cracking jokes:  You aren't far from
reality.</P>
<P>     Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose last bad movie was BATMAN & ROBIN,
really tries to show off his recent acting lessons as a deeply troubled
security guard (inexplicably hired to guard the invulnerable devil
himself).  Sidekick Pollack serves up the comic relief, and Robin Tunney
is proving herself to be a solid Designated Emotionally Scarred Damsel
in Distress in all manner of films, working here as the bride-to-be of
good old Lucifer.</P>
<P>     Gabriel Byrne makes as bad (and by that, I mean good -- I think) a
Satan as you're likely to see on film, but it's the groaner of a story
line that will really grab you.  To wit: Arnold's ex-cop does some
offhanded detective work that would put Sherlock Holmes to shame.  His
hunches are so uncanny... it's almost like... *he's working from a
script!*  The religious backstory, featuring Rod Steiger as a Catholic
priest, is so hokey you'll get dizzy from rolling your eyes.  The Y2K
stuff is predictable and, of course, played to the hilt.</P>
<P>     I'm not predicting any Oscars, but I have to say this is one bad
movie that's at least worth one of its two hours on comedic value
alone.  Just remember to say your prayers, kids.</P>
