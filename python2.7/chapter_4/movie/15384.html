<P>REVIEW: I Still Know What You Did Last Summer
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</P>
<P>Cast: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Brandy, Mekhi Phifer, Matthew Settle,
Freddie Prinze Jr., Jennifer Esposito, Muse Watson, Bill Cobb
Director: Danny Cannon
Screenplay: Trey Callaway</P>
<P>Australian theatrical release: November 26, 1998</P>
<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece): 1
star</P>
<P>In Scream, the killers are teenagers who slice their way into the news,
loving every second of rampaging across town weary kooky white masks.
In Urban Legend (which has been slated for a January '99 release), one
particularly troubled college student decides to bring myths like
"there's an axe-murdered in your back seat" to life.  Upon the release I
Know What You Did Last Summer, audiences tried to guess the identity of
the murderer, examining the four central characters then moving back
into sub-characters, then sub-sub-characters.  The dire mistake that was
made in the script of IKWYDLS was that the killer - a man with a very
nasty hook - was none of these characters, and revealing his identity
was just as useful as a poke in the dark with a sharp stick.</P>
<P>Well, the man with the hook is back.  And he, um, isn't happy.  Surprise
surprise, Mandalay Entertainment is taking a stab at a movie franchise,
this time hiring director Danny Cannon and screenwriter Trey Callaway; a
completely different combination from the Jim Gillespie-Kevin Williamson
duo responsible for the original.  The only man of these four whose
contribution is credible (if not crucial) is Williamson, the sharp
writer behind Scream, Scream 2 and Halloween H20.  Even though his
script for IKWYDLS failed to remain as quick-witted as some of his other
efforts, there were at least two or three genuinely well-written scenes.
Its sequel has no such luck.</P>
<P>It is now two years since the original group of teenagers (one of them
the lovely Sarah Michelle Gellar) committed hit and run on an abandoned
highway, but Julie James (the even lovelier Jennifer Love Hewitt) has
not been able to shake it from her memory.  When Julie's best friend
Karla (Brandy, of TV's Moesha) wins an all expenses paid trip to the
Bahamas, they both take their respective boy friends along and get ready
for the time of their lives.  Little do they know, fisherman Ben Willis
(Muse Watson) is still out to get Julie for aiding in the near fatal
accident, and decides to gatecrash their party with a splurge of blood
and revenge.</P>
<P>There is nothing in I Still Know that hasn't been done better before.
The thought of a killing spree on a luxurious holiday island is quite
appealing, but the setting fails to enhance the film because the setting
is not necessary.  Visions of sun and surf diminish when the island is
tormented by an aggressive storm; so what is left looks sort of like
parts of the theme park in Jurassic Park.  At least something that the
original film did was make use of its urban surroundings - the beauty
pageant, the street parade, the clothing store - but nothing that its
sequel does seems to justify its need for doing so.</P>
<P>Jennifer Love Hewitt is yet again gorgeous to look at, this time in a
"I'm not gonna die on this island" sort of way.  She carries the film as
far as she can, but good-looking actors in teen slasher films rarely
have much to do except look the part. Brandy doesn't contribute anything
that couldn't be found in an episode of Moesha, and the rest of the cast
looks suitably silly in barely developed roles.</P>
<P>Those even vaguely familiar with the horror scene with recognize the
usual cinematic traits: uncomfortable music builds up for the kill or
the bluff, characters make the worst possible choices for their
survival, and the killer is seen without a disguise only at the very
end.  Every one of these elements are included in I Still Know, and
Cannon makes it all so formulaically that the film is almost a satire.
It definitely could have been one, if the screenplay had not deluged
itself in its own seriousness. One of the reasons why Scream worked so
well was that it wasn't afraid to take the piss out of itself on
occasion moments, keeping tongue-in-cheek with the audience and
subsequently remained witty and sly. Calloway's screenplay suggests no
such accomplishments in this flick, as I Still Know's story is developed
with bad timing and the sluggishness of an inexperienced writer.</P>
<P>I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is a cheap thrill.  It is designed
for audiences who want a shriek and a squeal, and nothing in particular
to keep in their memory.  Get in…get out.  There are better killers to
watch.</P>
