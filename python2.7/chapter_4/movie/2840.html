<PRE>                       Telluride Film Festival 1994
                              (Part 1 of 2)
                       Film reviews by Wayne Citrin
                        Copyright 1994 Wayne Citrin</PRE>
<P>     I just came back from Labor Day weekend at Telluride and thought
I'd mention what showed there, what was good, and what was popular.
Maybe it was the excitement last year of being there for the first
time, or maybe I was paying more attention at the time to films that
were playing festivals abroad, but the selection here didn't seem quite
as exciting this year.  Last year we had the US premieres of such
widely heralded films as FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, THE PIANO, and FAR AWAY
SO CLOSE, as well as such discoveries (for me, at least) as RAINING
STONES (and other Ken Loach films), NAKED (and other Mike Leigh films),
BLUE, and THE JOY LUCK CLUB.  For those who liked big premieres,
though, the festival did have the world premieres of Michael Tolkin's
THE NEW AGE, Woody Allen's BULLETS OVER BROADWAY, and Tim Burton's ED
WOOD, as well as the premiere of the first Roadrunner/Coyote film
produced by Chuck Jones and Warner Brothers in over thirty years.</P>
<PRE>FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 2</PRE>
<PRE>THE NEW AGE (USA, 1994, approx. 120m)</PRE>
<P>     We arrived in town at 10PM after a long drive (8 hours), checked
into our room, and went and picked up a program.  (Programs are kept
secret until the start of the festival.)  We decided to catch the
premiere of THE NEW AGE, a new film by Michael Tolkin (dir. THE
RAPTURE, scr. THE PLAYER).  It was showing as part of a tribute to Judy
Davis.  THE NEW AGE stars Davis and Peter Weller (who both starred in
THE NAKED LUNCH) as an upscale Los Angeles couple who see the bottom
drop out of their lives as they both lose their jobs.  They try various
economic solutions and begin to examine their spiritual foundations,
but can't find any solutions.  The acting and production were flawless,
but I simply couldn't connect with the characters.  I simply could not
believe that such successful people could be so clueless about how to
keep their head above water.  I also found it hard to believe that
these people could be so spiritually bankrupt that their lives had been
completely unexamined up to that point.  It seemed that Tolkin spent
over two hours saying what might have been comfortably said in 20
minutes.  This film will probably get mainstream release, and it'll
probably (and rightly) be savaged by the critics.</P>
<PRE>SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 3</PRE>
<P>MURIEL'S WEDDING (Australia, 1994, 105m)</P>
<P>     We slept in on Saturday after the late night before.  This was
something of a mistake, since we missed the morning programs and made
it harder to see some of the things we wanted to see later.  The first
film we saw that day had been shown at the outdoor theater during an
open showing the night before, and we had heard people raving about
it.  (Word of mouth is the best way to get information in this festival
where approximately 30 programs show repeatedly over the course of four
days in five theaters in this small mountain resort.)  We had heard
that the film got a 15 minute standing ovation at Cannes this year.
Sometimes films are overhyped (THE PIANO, which I saw last year at
Telluride, didn't live up to the Cannes hype), but this time the film
was as good as the advance notices.  Muriel, a young woman from an
improbably dysfunctional family in an Australian seaside resort (with
the equally improbable name of "Porpoise Spit"), and a big ABBA fan,
learns to find her self-respect in a story that takes her to live on
her own in Sydney.  She originally believes that marriage will make her
somebody, but learns in the end what she really needs.  This is a
delightful comedy, a real crowd pleaser.  The ending was plausible and
not overly saccharine, despite the fact that some people said that,
although they liked it, they thought the film was a bit too "sweet."  I
believe that this will be a big hit in the US in the fall.  And, as the
director P. J. Hogan said before the showing, "if you don't know who
ABBA is, you'll certainly know after the movie is over."</P>
<P>     Before MURIEL'S WEDDING, Chuck Jones got up to introduce CHARIOTS
OF FUR (USA, 1994, 6m).  Jones, who looks great at 81 years old, said
that Warner had decided to revive their old movie animation operation
after 30 years, and asked Jones to come on board and teach a new
generation of cartoonists.  Jones made a few remarks about how, when he
had started as a young animator in his 20's, his producers were old men
of 40 and 50, and now "young men of 40 and 50 are running the studio."
He also said in the old days that you could tell how much Jack Warner
liked a film by how many times he had to leave the screening to pee.
Jones said he was fortunate that even Warner couldn't pee more than
once in the 6 minutes that it took to run a cartoon.  He also said that
they had decided to do a Roadrunner/Coyote cartoon because the
characters were simpler than, say, Bugs Bunny.  The film was good fun,
the typical Roadrunner stuff, although Jones said that he had
embellished the Roadrunner's character and made him a bit more "Harpo
Marxish."  The film will play in theaters this fall with WB releases.</P>
<P>STRAWBERRY AND CHOCOLATE (Cuba, 1993, 111m)</P>
<P>     Our passes included admission to an Opera House program "Writing
for Hitch," which would include live interviews with screenwriters
Charles Bennett (BLACKMAIL and THE 39 STEPS) and John Michael Hayes
(REAR WINDOW).  However interesting this sounded, Deborah and I had
decided that with our limited time we wanted to see films, particularly
new foreign and independent US films that were unlikely to make it to
local theaters.  Consequently we skipped the retrospectives and
tributes, and the Hollywood premieres.  We chose the Cuban film
STRAWBERRY AND CHOCOLATE, the showing of which at last year's Havana
Film Festival resulted in the exile of the festival's director.  How
the director avoided the same fate, I don't know.  STRAWBERRY AND
CHOCOLATE details the relationship of Diego, a cultured gay man, and
David, a university student, heterosexual, and committed Communist.
Diego attempts to pick up David on a dare, and after some difficulties
the two become friends, despite the government's anti-homosexual
policies.  This causes some tension between David and his comrades, and
the relationship eventually endangers both David's and Diego's
positions in society.  The film is well-acted and I enjoyed this
insight into everyday Cuban life--something quite alien to most
Americans, and all the more relevant now.</P>
<P>LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD (England, 1994, 102m)</P>
<P>     English director Ken Loach and his film RAINING STONES was one of
the big discoveries for me at last year's festival, and when I saw he
had a new film, I had to see it.  The new film tells the story of
Maggie, a woman who is judged as unfit to be a mother by the British
social welfare services and loses her children, then later has new
children taken away by the authorities despite dramatic improvements in
her life.  It's based on a true story, and treats issues very much in
the news these days.  Loach, the film maker of the British working
class, takes a very complex view of Maggie and her situation, and of
the  eminently reasonable policies of the bureaucracy and their
brutalizing effect on people.  Both of us were in tears by the end,
although Deborah, having never heard of Loach before, was even more
strongly affected than I was.  An extremely powerful, moving film, and
an amazing performance by Chrissy Rock as Maggie.  See this one, and
see any of Loach's other films that you can get your hands on.</P>
<P>     LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD was preceded by an English short called "Fever,"
about the problems of a young woman in an English city.  The woman was
played by Katrin Cartledge, who had a major role in Mike Leigh's NAKED
last year.  She played the same kind of character here, and although
she did a reasonable job, the film seemed to lack a point.</P>
<P>     After the film let out, the only thing we could make was a showing
of PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, as part of an Ed Wood retrospective, but
Deborah decided that we weren't that desperate to see another movie and
we called it a night.</P>
<PRE>SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 4</PRE>
<P>THE WOODEN MAN'S BRIDE (Taiwan, 1994, 105m)</P>
<P>     Having enjoyed FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE at last year's festival, and
being a fan of Zhang Yimou's films, I was curious to see this new film
by Taiwanese director Huang Jianxin.  The film, set in the 1920s, tells
the story of a young woman being brought to be a bride in another
house.  She's abducted by bandits but is recovered by the man who was
accompanying her.  In the meantime, the groom dies in an accident
during preparations for her rescue, and the family decides to continue
the wedding, marrying her to a wooden effigy of the young groom.  This
is a problem, since she feels oppressed by the arrangements and falls
in love with the man who brought her back from the bandits.  The film
was definitely inspired by the work of Zhang Yimou, particularly the
photography, but the story wasn't nearly as engaging, and the ending
was abrupt and implausible.  The film was ok, but not outstanding.</P>
<P>     Before the film, we were shown a short nature film by Swedish
director Stefan Jarl, "Land of the Lapps" (Sweden, 1994, 12m), who had
a retrospective at last year's festival.  The film attempted to show
the pressures on the traditional Sami people by modern Swedish society,
and although the photography was excellent, the presentation seemed
rather heavy-handed and uncompelling.</P>
<P>BAB EL-OUED CITY (Algeria/France, 1994, 93m)</P>
<P>     BAB EL-OUED CITY is a story of clash between modern life and
Muslim fundamentalism.  In Algiers, fundamentalists install
loudspeakers on roofs of buildings, playing sermons and readings from
scriptures both day and night.  One day a young baker, who can't sleep
because of the noise, tears out one of the speakers and throws it into
the sea.  The film tells the story of how the fundamentalists try to
find the person who did it, and the troubles the baker's act bring on
himself.  The film takes the position that the fundamentalists are
being manipulated by the Algerian secret police as a mechanism of
social control.  I felt that the film kept up a decent amount of
tension, and like STRAWBERRY AND CHOCOLATE lent insight into societies
and issues relatively unfamiliar to me, yet more and more important in
today's news.  Not one of the top films at the festival, but
interesting.</P>
<P>     Life begins to imitate art in that the director could not be
present at the screening because two of his friends had recently been
shot by fundamentalists.  The implication was that he was hiding
somewhere in Algiers.</P>
<P>     Before the film, we were shown a rather boring animated short
called "Etude" (USA, 1994, 5m), with abstract designs choreographed to
music.</P>
<P>FAMILY (England/Ireland, 1994, 115m)</P>
<P>     FAMILY, as shown at the festival, is a two-hour condensation of a
four-hour television series shown on British and Irish television this
year.  It is the first original screenplay by Roddy Doyle, the author
of the novels on which THE COMMITMENTS and THE SNAPPER were based, and
the author of this year's Booker Prize-winning novel "Paddy Clark ha ha
ha." FAMILY was a sensation in Ireland--the most talked-about TV
series in years.  No previous series had the graphic and realistic
language, sex, and violence of this series, and it provoked a
discussion of whether this was a typical North Dublin family.  Well, I
don't think this was the point--the point was that problems like this
exist and should be discussed.  The film has four segments, each on
various members of the Spenser family:  Charlo the husband, a
small-time thief and ne'er-do-well; John Paul, the oldest son who is
having trouble in school and is taking to drinking; Nicola, the oldest
daughter, who is in the process of escaping the home and fear possible
molestation by her father; and Paula, Charlo's alcoholic wife who is
trying to hold the family together.  The director, Michael
Winterbottom, reported that FAMILY may have a major influence on an
upcoming Irish referendum on the legalization of divorce.  You won't
see FAMILY in this form outside a festival, but the hope is that the
entire series will be picked up for television.  It was definitely
involving, and I suggest you look for it if it comes to television.</P>
<PRE>PORNOGRAPHIES ON/SCENE</PRE>
<P>     After dinner, we had about an hour to kill before the next film we
wanted to see, so we caught some of this presentation on pornography.
Two professors from the University of California lectured and showed
excerpts from various genres of pornography.  I have to admit that I
fell asleep, which astonished Deborah.  The lecture confirmed my
impression from the little pornography I'd previously seen: pornography
is boring.  I thought that the lecturers were completely off the mark
in neglecting the difference between pornography and erotica.  Erotica
uses the entire array of psychological stimuli to arouse--this may
include showing sex, or it may not.  In fact, some of the most erotic
scenes I can think of have no sex: the flamenco dances in Carlos
Saura's CARMEN, the eating scene in TOM JONES, and the scene where
Michelle Pfeiffer sings "Makin' Whoopie" and flirts with Jeff Bridges
while lying on Bridges' piano in THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS.  Pornography,
on the other hand, seems to rely entirely on portraying sex.  It seemed
that pornography is nothing more than an attempt at erotica by very
unimaginative people.  The two silent pornographic films from 1915
(FREE RIDE and ON THE BEACH) were kind of cute and innocent, though.</P>
<P>ONCE WERE WARRIORS (New Zealand, 1994, 99m)</P>
<P>     If I had to pick one thing that I would pronounce the best thing
at the festival, I would say that it was this film.  ONCE WERE WARRIORS
describes the lives of an urban Maori family, including the domestic
violence, the alcoholism, the unemployment, and the cultural
displacement.  The film is beautifully acted and photographed, and
there is a great soundtrack.  I think, though, that what's most
outstanding about this film is the writing and the characterizations.
There is a depth to these characters--even the worst ones are complex
and are attractive at times.  There's also a realization that not
everything is bleak--the good times are really good, and there can be
a great deal of real warmth in these lives.  The story of this film is
very similar to that of FAMILY, what with the ne'er-do-well husband,
the alcoholic wife, the domestic abuse, the son in trouble with the
law, and the daughter fearing sexual advances, but despite the fact
that FAMILY was written by a Booker Prize winner, the characters and
situations in ONCE WERE WARRIORS have a lot more depth.  I don't know
if this film will see mainstream distribution (I suspect not, but it
may well play in art houses), but I enthusiastically recommend that you
see it.  This is a debut film for the director, Lee Tamahori.  I hope
it's the beginning of a successful career.</P>
<P>     Before ONCE WERE WARRIORS, we were shown another New Zealand
short, "Avondale Dogs" (New Zealand, 1994, 15m).  The New Zealand Film
Commission seemed to have high hopes for this film and its director, as
it was distributing fliers for it, including sales and contact
information.  I thought it was a very lyrical and dreamy piece about a
young boy growing up in a suburban town in 1965, remembering one or two
events in his life that were very important but that he didn't quite
understand at the time.  I felt it had the qualities of a very good
short story, creating the characters and story in a fairly minimal
way.  I enjoyed it, and I hope that the director, Gregor Nicholas, goes
on to other things.</P>
