Analyze This (Reviewed on March 7/99)</PRE>
<P>Starring Robert DeNiro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow</P>
<P>When I originally saw the trailer for "Analyze This" a few months ago, I
must admit, I thought it looked kind of lame.  And then when the
commercials started popping up a week or two ago, I thought it looked
outright bad.  But then when "Analyze This" finally opened a few days ago,
an odd thing happened.  It got great reviews.  Critics were proclaiming it
"hilarious" and a "dead-on parody of mob movies".  Well, with praise like
that, I figured, it must be good and so I headed off to the theater.  You
know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts?  Well,
turns out that expression is more valid than I ever gave it credit for.</P>
<P>"Analyze This" is slow, unfunny, and badly acted.  Don't get me wrong, I
think that DeNiro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century,
but he is just out of his league here.  I think the problem is he didn't
quite know how to approach this material.  He plays his character, mob
boss Paull Vitti, somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama.  If
he had played the character straight, along the lines of Leslie Nielson in
the "Naked Gun" series, he probably would have been a lot more successful. 
As it is, though, he plays the character completely serious at some
moments, and for laughs at others.  This doesn't work.  It creates
an uneven character that never breaks out of the DeNiro mold; you always
know it's him.</P>
<P>And the movie is badly paced, too.  It never takes off.  It just crawls
from one scene to another without any forward momentum.  I think the blame
for this should be placed on the script.  It's obvious the writer had a
good idea for a movie, mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a
psychiatrist, but once this is established, the movie doesn't really go
anywhere.  The formula of the film seems to be this:  Billy Crystal says
no to DeNiro, DeNiro forces him, and much wackiness ensues.  This formula
of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie.</P>
<P>I've said it before and I'll say it again:  The only thing that matters to
me in a comedy is whether or not it's funny.  If "Analyze This" had been
funny, the pacing and bad acting wouldn't have bothered me.  I would have
been too busy laughing to notice.  But as it is, I only chuckled a few
times.  The only really funny scene is a dead-on parody of "The
Godfather".  Sadly, though, I don't think anyone in the audience I saw it
with realized it was a parody, because I was the only one laughing.</P>
<P>But my sense of humour, I have come to realize, is vastly different from
the general population.  I loathed "There's Something About Mary", yet
loved "BASEketball".  Now, if you want a movie that *I* think is funny, go
out and see "Office Space".  It's full of genuine laughs and won't leave
you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes, as "Analyze This" did.</P>
