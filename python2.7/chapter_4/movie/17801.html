<P>In recent years, director John Boorman's career has not
achieved the dizzy heights of either Point Blank or Deliverance.
However, his latest film is a well researched if slightly quirky
biopic of colourful Irish thief Martin Cahill, and heralds something
of a return to form for Boorman.  His assured and stylish direction
earned him the top prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival.</P>
<P>According to the production notes, the real Cahill once broke
into Boorman's home and stole, among other items, the gold record he
had been awarded for Duelling Banjo's, the theme from Deliverance.
Despite this, Boorman obviously has a lot of sympathy for Cahill.  He
paints him as something of a loveable larrikin, a kind of modern day
Irish Robin Hood, despite some of the more vicious acts he commits
along the way (crucifying one of his gang members on a billiard table,
for example).  The General is something of a labour of love for
Boorman, who has obviously spent plenty of time researching the life
and times of this colourful gangster.</P>
<P>This fascinating and unusually entertaining biopic traces
Cahill's life, from his early beginnings as a teenage thief in the
back streets of Hollyfield, a slum outside Dublin, through to his
assassination by the IRA in 1994.  Cahill earned the sobriquet of the
general for the way he commanded the loyalty of his small band of
thieves, and for the way in which he continually thumbed his nose at
the authorities.  Even though the police had him under blanket
surveillance, Cahill was often able to give them the slip and carry
out his cheeky crimes.  Cahill also had a cosy but unconventional
domestic arrangement in which he lived with his wife and her sister,
and even fathered children by both women.  Cahill had little time for
the divisive and violent politics of Ireland.  He was basically a
crook who robbed from the rich, but it was an art robbery that
ultimately proved his undoing.</P>
<P>Brendan Gleeson (from the recent I Went Down, etc) apparently
bears a resemblance to the real Cahill, and he gives a wonderfully
boisterous and enjoyable performance, and makes the most of his
biggest and best role yet.  He beautifully catches the inherent
contradictions in Cahill's character, lending an outrageous air of
irreverence to this off beat and at times acerbic portrait.  Jon
Voight also has many fine moments here as the weary police inspector
Kenny, increasingly frustrated at his impotence in bringing Cahill to
justice.</P>
<P>Seamus Deasy's cool black and white cinematography gives the
film something of a documentary feel, and also captures the look and
feel of those gritty British crime dramas of the '60's.</P>
