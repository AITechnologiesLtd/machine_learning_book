<P>As a sheer experiment in filmmaking, "Timecode" is audacious but as human 
drama, it fails to evoke much of an emotional response, though it has 
selective moments of humanism and it is often compelling. </P>
<P>"Timecode" takes place during a hazy afternoon in Los Angeles near Sunset 
Boulevard where a "creative meeting" is taking place among ad executives in 
an office building, and other events occur with different characters outside 
the building and beyond, including a psychiatrist's office and a limo that 
travels from some mansion to the aforementioned building. I don't want to 
sound too general with such a description, but that is about it. The 
characters merely float by us, making little introductions and soundbites. If 
this sounds like a documentary, in many ways, it is. Let me explain further. </P>
<P>As directed by Mike Figgis ("Leaving Las Vegas"), "Timecode" was shot in real 
time using four digital cameras that each recorded up to 93 minutes of 
footage in one single continuous take. Not only is this the longest long take 
ever devised on film (shot of course on video and then transferred to film), 
but it is also the first film to ever have four 93 minute takes in four 
quadrants of the screen projected at the same time. The idea of breaking up 
the screen in four quadrants is not a new visual trick but an entire film 
viewed in this manner is new and something to behold. Often, Figgis will 
drown out sound from one or more quadrants to focus on something significant 
in another. This aural technique makes me wonder why Figgis did not cut the 
film to focus on what he wanted us to be attentive to. Perhaps this is my own 
problem of trying to discover what the director intended but I much rather 
see such an experiment used as part of the underlying story, as opposed to 
just for the sake of style. </P>
<P>Some of the basic characters include a coke-sniffing security guard (Danny 
Huston), a jealous lesbian (Jeanne Tripplehorn, who spends most of the film 
in a limo), another lesbian with hopes of movie stardom (Salma Hayek), an 
attentive psychiatrist (Glenn Headley), and the founder of a film studio 
(Stellan Skarsgard) who is coming apart at the seams over a failed 
relationship. Skarsgard makes the biggest impression, creating a full-bodied 
character portrait of a lost soul, whereas the other characters sort of drift 
by, including a barely audible Holly Hunter as an ad exec. I did enjoy the 
frenetic Richard Edson, an unsung actor to be sure, as a low-budget film 
director with drug problems.  </P>
<P>Despite what is a literally mind-boggling visual experience to endure, the 
film is still quietly fascinating, and there are moments that break up the 
quiet, stately style such as a series of earthquakes, some screaming fits and 
a chilling finale. The use of music by Gustav Mahler gives the film some 
punch. All in all, a semi-successful experiment that will hopefully lead to 
more exciting uses for such an innovative technique. Although it is draining 
and sometimes repetitive, "Timecode" is certainly brave and risky fare. Just 
what we would expect from Mike Figgis.</P>
