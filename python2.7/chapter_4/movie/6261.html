<P>The review by a respected critic of a major weekly newsmagazine, had the
following dumdum headline :</P>
<P>"A Movie To Dine For. Big Night Makes Babette's Feast Look Like Pizza
Hut". </P>
<P>There's nothing in the critic's text that corresponds to that headline
--or to facts for that matter. Since writers almost never write their
headlines, this must have been put in by some kid at the copy-desk, some
new hiree who needs to see more films, to learn about cusine and to read
more Dave Barry.</P>
<P>The only connection between the superb "Babette" and the excellent --but
awkwardly and flatly titled -- "Big Night" is the gastronomic feast that
crowns both movies. </P>
<P>Scott and Tucci's film is set in the 1950's (when Cadillacs grew fins)
by the Jersey shore. It deals with two brothers who have been in the
States for a short time and are trying to make a go of their restaurant,
"Paradise." </P>
<P>Primo is the gifted chef who, in spite of the establishment's precarious
situation is a purist. He will not tolerate barbaric requests or
compromises in his authentic Italian cuisine. Played by an actor with an
Arabic-sounding name, Primo  looks and sounds entirely Italian, down to
the hot temper. </P>
<P>A funny opening scene (with a sad subtext) sets the tone.  One of the
rare customers does not understand the basics of risotto, wants a side
order of spaghetti (another pasta!) and, horrors, wants it with
meatballs, which is an American invention.</P>
<P>Younger brother Secondo, is the practical one, the manager who helps in
the kitchen (a primitive place that produces wonders) but whose main
task is to avoid losing the restaurant to the bank. He's pure of heart
yet also a realist who tries to reason with Primo. But the chef sticks
to his guns:"If you give people time, they learn." Secondo: " I don't
HAVE time." Yet, during the constant, affectionate tension between the
two, Primo insists: "If you comp[rpmise with my work, it dies." </P>
<P>Nearby is "The Grotto," one of those Italian eateries where waiters and
customers sing, where indifferent, inauthentic food is served, where
phony local color prevails, where (as per Primo) food gets raped
nightly... and where the cash register keeps ringing. The owner, cynical
friend Pascal, is played by that most British actor Ian Holm
convincingly transformed into an Italian.</P>
<P>The single real Italian in the film, Isabella Rosselini, plays
Gabriella, vaguely the hostess and not vaguely Pascal's mistress.</P>
<P>The brothers are handsome and molto simpatici, Primo in his unloquacious
way, Secondo in his natural elegance. They succeed (with, of course, the
filmmakers) in making "Big Night" into a genuine Italian movie set in
the land of plenty, "plenty" that is, if you conform, adapt and leave
ideals behind you. </P>
<P>Secondo goes to Pascal to search for a solution. It's not forthcoming --
until Pascal mentions that the popular band-leader Louis Prima (yes,
Virginia, there was such a person) is his pal and that he, Pascal, will
arrange for him to come to a special dinner at the Paradise. The
resulting PR and publicity will surely bring more customers.</P>
<P>With the brothers investing their last pennies and immense labor, the
feast does take place. It's a gathering of friends and new
acquaintances, from Pascal to Gabriella, from a nice Cadillac salesman
(just met by Secondo under slyly warm circumstances), to a florist lady
whom Primo is to shy to court, and so on, down to (or up to) the U.K.'s
Minnie Driver ("Circle of Friends") who, as Phyllis, Secondo's girl
friend, is amazingly genuine as a Yank. I say "up to" because the ladies
all tower above the men, not just the diminutive Ian Holm.</P>
<P>There are two surprises in store. One, I cannot mention without spoiling
things.  The other is the meal itself, a repast greeted by oohs and aahs
by the guests as well as the audience.</P>
<P>The menu, gargantuan and sumptuously delicious, starts with La  Zuppa
(Soup), goes on to I Primi (First Courses, in the plural), then I
Secondi (Second Courses, also plural) and I Dolci (The Sweets).  Even if
you find a top Italian restaurant you will not encounter the likes of
those dishes again, recipes of the pre-cholesterol, pre-fat calories
era, all under the sign of the stomach pump. (The brothers are also
chain-smokers). </P>
<P>We get to the meal well after one hour of film. It lasts no more than 10
to 15 minutes. Before all this, the movie followed the brothers in their
mini-odyssey, especially Secondo. He had taken us for a walk (plus a
ride in a Caddy) that, while sometimes a bit unfocused and slow, gave
his character dimensionality.  Among the asides was an almost hilarious
reversal of sex attitudes. Phyllis wants to cuddle, and much more,
Secondo reacts like a shy virgin. "I want the time to be right. It is
not right for you." Phyllis doesn't get it, while next --surprise!-- we
see Secondo in bed with Gabriella.</P>
<P>"Big Night" is studded with nostalgic Italian and Italian-American
period music in the background and with  sensitive, intelligent touches
in the foreground. The dialogue proceeds in shifts, indirections and
allusions. Almost incredibly for an "Italian" movie, this one has more
pregnant silences than talk and goes easy on loudness and theatricalism.
There are also some visuals of Phyllis and others by the sea, which may
remind you of Fellini or Antonioni yet are not copycat scenes. </P>
<P>The naturalist tone of the movie seldom abates. It is cannily recorded
and splendidly performed, although some bits do push verisimilitude to
its limits, notably Secondo's fluid command of the American language,
far too unlikely for a recent immigrant.  Some of the wines on the
banquet table look like Bordeaux bottles. But several other absurdisms
are humorous, such as Secondo's linguistic, didactic argument: "You
can't say 'It is raining outside,' since rain always falls outside.." </P>
<P>Some gastronomes may find food for thought in the comparative
celebrations of Italian cooking and Europe's champion cuisine, the
French, that was glorified in "Babette's Feast." </P>
<P>Filmically speaking, "BN"'s dialogue-less ending is a little gem as, the
morning after, Secondo makes a simple omelet for himself, his brother
and their assistant. The dish, like the mood, is in touching contrast
with the earlier, intricate relations, preparations and dreams. </P>
<P>The film won the Sundance Festival's script writing prize. Score another
win for  Sundance,  by now incontestably the breeding and launching
grounds for the New Independent America Cinema.</P>
