<P>Starship Troopers (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>Starship Troopers is Paul Verhoeven's return to familiar sci-fi ground
after the disastrous Showgirls, and it just might be the quintessential
Verhoeven film.  While it is not a complete rebound from the instant camp
classic of '95, it is a shining example of Verhoeven at his best--and,
unfortunately, his worst.</P>
<P>Based on the Robert A. Heinlein novel of the same name, Starship Troopers
details mankind's future war with giant bugs from outer space.  Why have
these alien arthropods decided to pick a fight with Earthlings?  We never
find out, not that it matters.  The wild and woolly battles with the CGI
bugs find the Dutch Verhoeven, who made his name in America with the
superlative sci-fi actioners RoboCop and Total Recall, back in top form.
No other action director can make mass impalings, decapitations, and
dismemberment so sadistically--and gleefully--over-the-top.  More prudish
viewers may find the bloody action repugnant, but the gruesome, almost
cartoonish, nature of the violence is exactly what makes Verhoeven
adventures so much fun.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, aside from a brief snippet of opening bug action, there is
an often laughable first hour of exposition and uninspired soap opera
subplots, during which we meet our focal slate of stock characters: Johnny
Rico (Casper Van Dien), hotshot soldier; his demure girlfriend, Carmen
Ibanez (Denise Richards), a military pilot; brash Dizzy Flores (Dina
Meyer), who carries a torch for the oblivious Johnny; pilot Zander Barcalow
(Patrick Muldoon), Johnny's rival for Carmen's affections; and Carl Jenkins
(Neil Patrick Harris), an intelligence officer whose psychic abilities only
extend to animals.  Every film needs its expository time, and this section
of the film is an obvious timekiller before the war heats up, but Verhoeven
and screenwriter Ed Neumeier put forth very little effort, if any, to make
these characters and their situations halfway interesting.  More energy and
thought is expended in the acidly satiric news bites and fascistic military
recruitment propaganda that pepper this first half.  How do the filmmakers
expect the viewers to care about the characters if they obviously do not?</P>
<P>If anything could have saved this first hour and more "dramatic" moments
that come later in the film, it would be the acting, but, as so painfully
exemplified in Showgirls, Verhoeven does not have much of an eye for young
talent.  Van Dien, whom I remember not-so-fondly from his stints on ABC
Daytime's One Life to Live and the amusingly cheesy but little-seen 1990
syndicated women-in-prison soap Dangerous Women, can bark out "Kill 'em
all!" with the best of them, but he has little acting skill to offer beside
his square jaw.  It also does not help that he, Richards, and Meyer make
the WASPiest Argentines since... well, Jonathan Pryce in Evita; and that
they, Harris, and Muldoon look much too old to be the high schoolers their
characters are supposed to be at the film's opening.  The only cast member
displaying some signs of life--aside from Michael Ironside, who is usual
stern, effective self as teacher/commanding officer Jean Rasczak--is Meyer,
who infuses Dizzy with moxie and spunk.</P>
<P>And while Verhoeven is miles away from Joe Eszterhas (thankfully so), some
post-Showgirls fallout is still in evidence, most blatantly in a
ridiculously gratuitous co-ed shower scene, and more subtly so in its
anti-feminism.  I usually do not like to include spoilers in my reviews,
but I cannot address this point without giving something away, so skip the
next paragraph if you wish not to have some details spoiled...</P>
<P>When a male character is able to destroy a humongous tanker bug, he is
celebrated as a hero; when a female character does the same--which no other
person save that one male is able to do--she receives no credit.  A female
soldier mortally wounded in combat bravely accepts her impending death, but
not because she did her part in saving the human race.  In the end, her
passing is worth it to her because... she had the chance to sleep with a
studly conquest.  A female character supplies a critical coup de grace
against the aliens, but who is carried on everyone's shoulders like a hero
at the end?  A male who did not do much of anything.</P>
<P>Its problems aside, Starship Troopers does deliver what the audience comes
for, which is two-plus hours of no-brainer entertainment, filled with the
graphic ultraviolence that has become associated with the name Paul
Verhoeven.  But as fun as much of the movie is, its superficiality is quite
dismaying coming from Verhoeven, who once upon a time melded electrifying
action with plot and character in RoboCop and Total Recall.  Starship
Troopers is not the return to form for Verhoeven many have called it--in
the end, it is just a step in the right direction, albeit a fairly
entertaining one.</P>
