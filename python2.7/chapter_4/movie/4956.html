<P>     In an era when movies are again turning to classic literature for 
inspiration, it was only a matter of time before a new version of 
Charlotte Bronte's JANE EYRE reached the screen.  One of the best-loved 
of all the Victorian novels, JANE EYRE combines social commentary with 
gothic romance.  This new film, directed by Franco Zeffirelli (best 
known for his 1968 Oscar-nominated ROMEO AND JULIET), remains faithful 
to the original narrative in general, if not in all the particulars.</P>
<P>     Of necessity, the story has been condensed, since it isn't possible 
to reproduce a full-length book as a two-hour movie.  Screenwriters 
Zeffirelli and Hugh Whitemore have elected to retain JANE EYRE's full 
scope while elimiting many of the nuances.  The result is a reasonably 
fast-paced story (with a confused sense of time) that occasionally 
struggles to develop its characters to their maximum potential.  
Ultimately, this film is on par with the 1944 Orson Welles/Joan Fontaine 
version.</P>
<P>     We are introduced to ten-year old Jane (Anna Paquin) in the early 
1830s at Gateshead Hall, where she lives with her aunt and cousins.  
Orphaned at an early age, Jane has grown up unloved and unloving, and 
now her aunt has decided to send her to the Lowood Charity School, 
citing her as willful, obstinate, deceitful, and in need of a stern 
upbringing.  At Lowood, Jane finds life difficult under the tutelage of 
the cold-hearted Mr. Brocklehurst (John Wood) and Miss Scatcherd 
(Geraldine Chaplin), but she forms a pair of solid friendships that help 
her through the hardest times.</P>
<P>     After ten years at Lowood, an older, wiser, but still-spirited Jane 
(now played by Charlotte Gainsbourg) accepts a position as governess for 
the young French ward of Edward Rochester (William Hurt), master of 
Thornfield Hall.  Jane settles in quickly, forming solid relationships 
with her charge, Adele Varens (Josephine Serre), and Thornfield's 
housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax (Joan Plowright).  However, the master of the 
house makes the strongest impression on the young woman.  From her first 
meeting with Edward, when she offers aid after he is thrown from a 
horse, she is infatuated, but his natural reticence keeps her from 
confessing her feelings.  But there is something other than Edward for 
Jane to consider as she beomes established in her new situation, because 
Thornfield Hall hides a secret.  Who, or what, lives in the attic, under 
the stern and watchful eye of the semi-vigilant Grace Poole (Billie 
Whitelaw)?</P>
<P>     JANE EYRE is a love story, but, instead of the lighter romance and 
humor of Jane Austen's novels, this tale is marked by stark realism and 
a pervasive sense of misery.  The meticulously accurate settings and 
beautiful-but-gloomy cinematography establish the atmosphere.  Even the 
daytime scenes are drab and colorless, and many of the interior shots 
are so dark that it's difficult to see the characters' expressions.  
There's no doubt that one of the reasons JANE EYRE is so cheerless is 
because the shadows are often more important than the light.  At least 
in the end, there is a moment of joyful catharsis.</P>
<P>     With one exception, the acting is excellent.  Charlotte Gainsbourg 
(THE CEMENT GARDEN) brings Jane to life, and, on those occasions when 
the script fumbles because it's painting the narrative in too-broad 
strokes, she holds our attention and captures our sympathy.  
Unfortunately, Gainsbourg's opposite, William Hurt, lacks presence.  His 
is a passionless portrayal of a tragic figure.  The venerable Joan 
Plowright plays Mrs. Fairfax with grandmotherly goodwill.  Josephine 
Serre, Amanda Root (who had the lead in PERSUASION), and Anna Paquin are 
all solid in smaller roles.</P>
<P>     JANE EYRE is about the contrast between a plain-but-spirited woman 
and a beautiful-but-venal one.  It's about obligations and taking 
responsibility for one's actions.  And, most of all, it's about the 
maturation of an unloved girl into a sensitive woman.  JANE EYRE 
features one of literature's most independent, strong-willed female 
protagonists in a narrative brimming with repressed emotion and dark 
secrets. </P>
<P>     Zeffirelli's picture fits nicely into the recent spate of films 
based on classic novels.  It's a vast improvement over last year's hack 
job of THE SCARLET LETTER, but not as impressive as the "Jane Austen 
trio" (PERSUASION, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, and the BBC/A&E PRIDE AND 
PREJUDICE).  Nevertheless, for Bronte aficionados, lovers of Victorian 
romance, or those who simply appreciate literate love stories, JANE EYRE 
offers two hours of quality entertainment.</P>
