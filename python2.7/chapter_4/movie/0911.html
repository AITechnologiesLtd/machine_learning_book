<PRE>                                    AIR AMERICA
                       A film review by Jonathan Knight
                        Copyright 1991 Jonathan Knight</PRE>
<P>     AIR AMERICA is a wonderful movie which actually has the distinction
of making me laugh out loud in the cinema.</P>
<P>     I went to see AIR AMERICA having seen the trailer and thought it
might be a little light relief on a Friday evening.  The movie is based
in Laos while Tricky Dicky (President Nixon) was telling the whole world
that the US government was not in Laos.  Of course this sounds slightly
odd as we can see a vast collection of aircraft and government troops
exactly where they're not supposed to be.</P>
<P>     The government is in fact in Laos, but employing a collection of
civilian pilots to fly supplies to the army the US would like to win the
war.  As a sideline the US major is running a heroin factory and using
the pilots to fly the opium around.</P>
<P>     This then gives a nice set of interactions that the film uses for
both comic effect and also to serious and emotional effect which the
film just about brings off.  The dialogue is cleverly written and has
some beautiful lines which are extremely funny.</P>
<P>     Characters other than the two main ones are not explored, then tend
to be there for contrast and provide the setting for the scene.  The
story is enough to make the film move along at the right pace and it is
easy to follow what's going on and why (good news for Friday evening).</P>
<PRE>     I saw it on a wide screen with Surroundsound which is well used.</PRE>
<P>     I really enjoyed this movie, it fitted in exactly with what I
wanted to see.  It is far more funny than the trailer would lead you to
believe.</P>
