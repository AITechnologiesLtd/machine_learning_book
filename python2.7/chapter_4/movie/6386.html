<P>     JINGLE ALL THE WAY is the first film from Chris Columbus' 1492
production company which was not directed by Columbus himself, and I found
myself curious as to whether it would resemble the producing efforts of
his mentors Steven Spielberg and John Hughes -- more specifically, would
it look like a clone of Columbus' own films?  Just as an experiment, I
predicted to myself that JINGLE ALL THE WAY would involve an 
irresponsible/inconsiderate adult who, after plenty of broadly comic
trials and tribulations, learns What's Really Important.  That particular
combination of slapstick and sentimentality had served Columbus well in
two HOME ALONE films, MRS. DOUBTFIRE and NINE MONTHS (making him the third
highest grossing director in history behind Spielberg and Robert
Zemeckis), and there was no reason to suspect he wouldn't go to the well
again.</P>
<P>     Well, son of a gun, guess what.  JINGLE ALL THE WAY finds Arnold
Schwarzenegger playing Howard Langston, an irresponsible/inconsiderate
harried businessman who is forever disappointing his young son Jamie (Jake
Lloyd) by missing all the important events in his life.  Determined to
make it up to Jamie, Howard promises him that he will get the Christmas
present he wants the most:  the action figure of Turbo Man, a wildly
popular television action series character who has become a wildly popular
toy.  Unfortunately, Howard waits until Christmas Eve to make his
purchase, forcing him to go on a desperate search across Minneapolis to
find the scarce toy, and to battle with another equally desperate father,
mail carrier Myron Larabee (Sinbad), for one of the few Turbo Man figures
remaining in the city.</P>
<P>     And, of course, Howard walks away from his experiences having learned
What's Really Important.  I suspect Columbus may be fond of such
warm-n-fuzzy denouements because he wants to leave his audience with the
impression that it has watched something more meaningful than a
live-action cartoon.  The fact is that JINGLE ALL THE WAY is in many ways
a better cartoon than SPACE JAM, directed by Brian Levant (THE
FLINTSTONES) with an emphasis on absurd, elaborate sequences of physical
comedy which at least have a certain momentum.  Yes, some of them run on
past the point of diminishing returns, like a seemingly endless pursuit of
a bouncing ball, but other moments are keepers.  The "Turbo Man" TV
program is a neat little jab at "Power Rangers"-type shows in all their
over-marketed glory, and Schwarzenegger's encounter with an enraged
reindeer works better than it sounds.  Miraculously, there is also only
one scene of a kick to the groin in all the mayhem.</P>
<P>     It is when JINGLE ALL THE WAY turns message-y on us that it not only
loses steam, but demonstrates its crucial bit of mis-casting.  The guilty
party is Schwarzenegger himself, who has failed to understand the kind of
comedy in which he can be successful.  In the past, he has gone for laughs
playing against his image, his sheer physical presence -- see Arnie paired
with Danny DeVito as a mild-mannered genius in TWINS, see Arnie struggle
with toddlers in KINDERGARTEN COP, see Arnie pregnant in JUNIOR.  In
JINGLE ALL THE WAY, he is frequently put in the position of threatening
people to get his way, and it is not nearly the visual gag it could have
been when the massive Schwarzenegger is forced to play the part of Turbo
Man in a parade.  A Steve Martin, Michael Keaton or even Robin Williams
might have made Howard's quest more interesting, and the character more
sympathetic; with Big Arnold, JINGLE is simply frantic and a bit too
mean-spirited.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, Schwarzenegger has a pair of comic co-stars with more
sense for the material.  Sinbad plays a character with no consistent
personality -- sometimes a harmless nut, sometimes the film's villain --
but he can still make lame material funny (witness FIRST KID).  If JINGLE
ALL THE WAY had to star Schwarzenegger, it is to Levant and Columbus'
credit that they got someone both funny _and_ a physical match to be his
adversary.  Phil Hartman also has a fun part as the Langstons' next-door
neighbor Ted, who is like "The Simpsons'" Ned Flanders with a hyper-active
libido.  It is Ted's job to hit on Howard's wife Liz (Rita Wilson), which,
of course, helps Howard to realize What's Really Important.  What's really
important to remember about JINGLE ALL THE WAY is that its target audience
is probably under 12 years old, and that 90% of the humor involves bodily
injury, property damage, or some combination of the two.  Columbus wasn't
trying to discover any new worlds here.  He's already discovered a formula
which works.</P>
