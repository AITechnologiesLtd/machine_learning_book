<PRE>"How the Grinch Stole Christmas" Won't Be on Your Wish
List
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.  He's as ugly as a
cactus and as charming as an eel.  Living atop the
windy peak of Mount Crumpit, he peers out onto the
town of Whoville far below.  He's a solitary
curmudgeon whose sole source of enjoyment comes from
making life miserable for others, especially during
the holiday season.  Loathing their Christmas spirit
with their bright lights, non-stop singing, gift
giving, and general sense of gaiety, he devises a plan
to rob Whoville of their most precious holiday.</P>
<P>However, his foul mission is thwarted by the
kindhearted actions of little Cindy Lou Who (adorable
Taylor Momsen).  In a chance encounter with the Grinch
(an unrecognizable Jim Carrey), she believes that he's
not all bad despite what the rest of the town thinks. 
With her wide-eyed innocence, she hopes to bring out
his warm side hidden under all that green fur and
callous demeanor.</P>
<P>"How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a slightly revved
up version of the Dr. Seuss bedtime classic. 
Richly narrated by Anthony Hopkins, the film follows
the original basic outline.  However, it comes up
short on imagination and has lost a touch of its
sentimental spirit. </P>
<P>You would expect more in terms of design, considering
the Grinch universe takes place within a snowflake. 
The Whoville denizens look and act like mannequins. 
They possess hog-like snouts and sport a hairstyle
that looks like it was the result of a passing
cyclone.  And for a town that seems to be in a 24/7
preparation mode for Christmas, the whole place looks
oddly somber.  There is a noticeable lack of primary
colors, the palettes seem muted, and the entire set
design seems like something out of Candyland…or the
backlot of Universal Studios.  Of course, there are
some terrific special effects.  And its strongest
segment occurs when the Grinch goes on his raid during
Christmas Eve.  He employs a giant vacuum to suck out
the goodies, unleashes moths to eat the hanging
Christmas stockings, and even steals the visions of
sugarplums dancing in their heads.  But up to that
point, there's very little magic in the air.</P>
<P>Another shortfall was that the film didn't do enough
to generate enough sympathy for the Grinch.  Yes, we
learn of the Grinch's past and the root of his hatred
for Christmas and Whoville, but it spends an
inordinate amount of time establishing his meanness. 
This disqualifies the film from being a wholesome
child's tale, and moves it into dark territory that
may leave wee ones confused. Among other things, he
pushes little kids to the ground during a sack race
and eats shards of glass while he plots against the
town of Whoville.  This is a bad hero/role model for
children if they tend to mimic what happens on-screen.</P>
<P>Yet, the film has flashes of creativity, and kudos are
in order for Jim Carrey who worked exceptionally hard
to pull off this almost-impossible role.  Despite
being mummified under that green suit, he still
applies his unique brand of physical comedy while
snarling, growling, and scowling, and does his best to
show us a good time.</P>
<P>The movie does have its funny moments even if its
grander aspirations are unrealized.  
But it needed to be brighter to captivate and more fun
to enthrall.  
Like the Grinch who felt hatred towards those who had
him ostracized,
This film's heart is two sizes too small.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C+

L:        0 out of 3
V:        1 out of 3        General meanness and some lowbrow humor.</PRE>
