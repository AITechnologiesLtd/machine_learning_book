<PRE>Batman & Robin
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) When the first "new" Batman movie was released 8 years
ago, nearly everyone made something out of how dark it was. People
either loved the new tone of the movie or they missed the camp of the
old TV show. With the latest installment in the current series, it seems
that the pendulum is swinging back. </P>
<P>BATMAN & ROBIN is more campy and less dark than any of its recent
predecessors, but it's hard to decide if that's bad or good. On the one
hand, the dark tone was hard to sustain for two hours - both for the
filmmakers and for the audience. On the other hand, now we are bombarded
by dumb jokey lines like those from the TV series, and we don't have a
mute button. </P>
<P>In the first "action" sequence, after Batman (George Clooney) makes his
Fred Flintstone-like entrance via the frozen back of a dinosaur, hordes
of cartoonish villains "fight" Batman and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) while
everyone makes lame hockey jokes. This first sequence is the worst in
the film for cheesy camp, so at least the movie gets better as it
progresses. But those first impressions are hard to change. </P>
<P>This time around bat-villains Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and
Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) conspire to wipe out Gotham - Freeze in a
misguided revenge plot and Ivy in an attempt to end oppression of plants
by animals (notably men). </P>
<P>Freeze is a villain, no doubt, but he is also a dupe - he is much less
evil than Poison Ivy. Considering Schwarzenegger's shoot-to-WOUND role
in TERMINATOR 2, I wonder if he has a clause in his contract that
stipulates his characters must have some redeeming qualities. I also
wonder if his conservative politics had anything to do with evil Ivy's
association with environmental extremism. </P>
<P>There are some plot threads that deal with the addition of Batgirl
(Alicia Silverstone) to the family, the terminal illness of loving
servant and father figure Alfred (Michael Gough), and the jealous
sibling rivlaries that arise between Batman and Robin. </P>
<P>Actually, the "family" subplot of this movie was more thoughtful and
honest about family matters than most kids movies are. BATMAN & ROBIN
deals with trust, competition, caring for elderly family members, and
the sacrifices of parents for their children. Don't get me wrong. Most
of the movie is look and action; not plot. But still, it was nice to
include a bit of thoughtful fluff in this episode. And while the Michael
Medveds complain about a lack of "family"-oriented movies, a big bad
action movie gives them just what they asked for - but not necessarily
what they wanted. (Goes to show how misued the word "family" is in
political and critical circles.) </P>
<P>It's hard to evaluate "acting" in a movie like this, where the sets,
costumes and special effects take center stage, but a good performance
is still important. </P>
<P>I had very low expectations for Schwarzenegger, who got top billing. He
wasn't as bad as I had feared, which is not to say that he was very
good. Clooney gave the best performance yet as Batman/Bruce Wayne.
Michael Keaton made a good Bruce Wayne in the earlier movies, when the
neurosis of creating a superhero alter-ego was explored. But Clooney
makes a more confident, mature, approachable, and likeable Wayne. (Val
Kilmer was practically invisible as the last Wayne/Batman.) Chris
O'Donnell's youthful charm ordinarily makes him hard to take seriously,
but he's perfect for the role of Robin. </P>
<P>But as I mentioned, the stars of this movie are the modelmakers,
costumers, and special effects technicians. Gotham's architecture was
nicely displayed, the oppressive size and weight of the city came across
well, the cartoonish sets were elaborately decorated, and the special
effects were seamless. </P>
<P>There are significant differences between BATMAN & ROBIN and the
previous Batman movies, in scope, in tone, and in the details. But if
you've seen the others, then you know what you're getting into. If you
liked the last ones, chances are you'll like this one. </P>
<P>By the way, depending on your intestinal fortitude, you may want to
stick around for the credits. The second song that plays over the
credits - GOTHAM CITY by R. Kelley (aka Love Theme from Batman & Robin?)
- is really awful. It's so bad that it's funny, but it is not for the
weak.</P>
