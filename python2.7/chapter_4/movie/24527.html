<P>"Titus," a gruesome tale of the sweetest revenge, can be summed
up flawlessly by the opening line of the
musical "Chicago," "Murder, greed, corruption, violence,
exploitation, adultery, treachery - all those things we hold
near and dear to our hearts."</P>
<P>I doubt Shakespeare scripted orgies, arcade video games, or
obnoxiously banal bookends for his deliciously appalling
tragedy, "Titus Andronicus." Yet here we are, 400 years later,
soaking in Julie Taymor's campy and freakish adaptation of the
Bard's most sanguinary work which she says, "speaks directly to
our times, when audiences feed daily on tabloid sex scandals,
teenage gang rape, and the private details of a celebrity murder
trial, when racism, ethnic cleansing, and genocide have almost
ceased to shock by being so commonplace and seemingly
inevitable. Our entertainment industry thrives on the graphic
details of murders, rapes and villainy, yet it is rare to find a
film or play that not only reflects on these dark events but
also turns them inside out, probing and challenging our
fundamental beliefs on morality and justice. For Titus is not a
neat or safe play, where goodness triumphs over evil, but one in
which, through relentless horror, the undeniable poetry of human
tragedy emerges in full force, demanding that we examine the
very root of violence and judge its various acts."</P>
<P>Today on "Where Are They Now?" we have Academy Award winners
Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange, Tony Award winners Alan
Cumming and Julie Taymor, and the self-proclaimed greatest
writer of all time, William Shakespeare. Hopkins, who won an
Oscar for playing Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter in the 1991
film "The Silence of the Lambs," is back in another human flesh
munchfest, this time one written by The Bard. Although the
performance as the great Roman general Titus is powerfully
preeminent, it lacks the bite that made Hannibal such a kick to
watch.</P>
<P>The Queen Bee is Titus' archenemy. No, not Li'l Kim! I'm talking
about the venomous Queen of the Goths played libidinously by
Jessica Lange, Tamora who is married to Saturninus, played by
Alan Cumming, Queen of the Cross-Dressing Broadway Singers and
Dancers. See, Tamora is PMSing because Titus slew her first-born
son despite her begging for his life. And now, she's planning a
number of dirty double crossings and revenges to be exerted upon
him, his friends, his family, his reputations, his sanity....</P>
<P>And the woman helming it all is none other than that evil
mastermind also behind the Broadway adaptation of "The Lion
King," Julie Taymor. Like Baz Luhrmann (Romeo + Juliet) before
her, Taymor tries a number of attention-grabbing concepts to
update this Shakespearean work, and like Luhrmann before her,
several of them fail horribly. Some are fiercely disturbing and
memorable; some are obliviously insipid and uninspired. There's
an MTV music video halfway through the film that is absolutely
vapid and just takes up precious screen time.</P>
<P>Julie opens "Titus" with a strikingly lame introduction that is
supposed to link the play to modern times. A young boy with a
paper bag over his head plays with toy soldiers and sprays
ketchup on them. This sequence lasts an astoundingly tedious 5
minutes. Whatâ€™s worse, is that the film ends with this same boy
walking into "the light." Talk about disrespecting The Bard.</P>
<P>There are only two ways to review a Shakespearean play and a
Shakespearean adaptation. If the Shakespeare play has great
dialogue, nothing else matters, it's a Shakespeare play that's
main objective is to have great dialogue, monologues, and duets.
For a Shakespearean adaptation to be successful, all that is
truly necessary is adequate interpretation and superb acting
performances. And you bet your ass "Titus" has excellent
performances.</P>
<P>However, like most Shakespearean adaptations, there's always a
couple of weak links, and this is no exception. For every
strikingly stirring Shakespearean rant and rave spewed by a
veteran actor or actress (Hopkins, Lange, Harry J. Lennix, Colm
Feore), there's a boring and juvenile high school performance by
what seems like amateurs (Cumming, Matthew Rhys, Jonathan Rhys-
Meyers).</P>
<P>No matter how many shots I take at "Titus," nothing can fade a
movie that is this far-out. Any movie that can be
called "Shakespeare on Crack" is untouchable. "Titus" is the
freakshow we have no choice but to stare at with uncontrollable
awe.</P>
