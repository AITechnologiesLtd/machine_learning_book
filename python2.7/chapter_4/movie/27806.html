PRESTON TYLK
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>"You better face it, Mr. Tylk," the seedy detective, aptly named Dick 
(Dennis Farina), warns his new client.  "Your number is up."  The 
sharp-tongued Farina, looking like an unemployed longshoreman, is the 
best part of writer/director Jon Bokenkamp's PRESTON TYLK.</P>
<P>With his usual uneasy edge, Luke Wilson (BLUE STREAK) plays the film's 
lead, Preston Tylk.  When we meet Preston, he is borderline happy for a 
few seconds until his wife, Emily (Mili Avital), announces that she's 
been having an affair, which is now over.  A few seconds after that the 
phone starts ringing, and, you guessed it, it's her ex-lover, Jonathan 
(Norman Reedus), demanding a recount.  As the story's villain, Reedus 
delivers an incredibly bland performance, which effectively cancels out 
the positive effects of Farina's work in the picture.</P>
<P>>From there, Preston's life sinks into the abyss.  After his wife is 
killed, he is chased by the cops and by Jonathan, who has an uncanny and 
unbelievable ability to follow him like a shadow.  He enlists Dick's 
help in obtaining some key evidence.  Most of the movie is a standard 
chase picture with Jonathan and the cops pursuing Preston and Dick all 
over town.  One thing is certain.  Tacoma, Washington, where the story 
is set, has the best police force in the entire nation.  Whenever they 
are needed, a half dozen cop cars show up within seconds.  This all 
makes for a thriller that stretches plausibility a bit too often.</P>
<P>The impressive score by Kurt Kuenne (SCRAPBOOK) does a terrific job of 
setting the mood.  He was at our screening and filled in some details 
about the production.  The score, for example, only accounted for twelve 
thousand of the almost two million dollar budget.  The surprise was that 
their distributor, in a deal that baffles the filmmakers, will be 
retitling the movie to BAD SEED when it is released this summer directly 
to DVD and video.  This is a movie without anyone that could be so 
called.  He asked us to play a game to guess who the bad seed could be.  
We couldn't come up with any plausible candidates.</P>
<P>PRESTON TYLK runs 1:33.  It is rated R for violence and language and 
would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
