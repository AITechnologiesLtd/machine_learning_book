Bang (Reviewed on Jan. 9/99)</PRE>
<P>"Bang", filmed on a budget of $20 000, is proof that a big budget
is not necessarily needed to produce a quality motion picture.</P>
<P>The movie opens with a young woman being kicked out of her house
for failing to pay her rent.  She's not too concerned, though,
as she is scheduled to audition for the leading role in a movie
opposite "Dustin" and "Julia".  However, when she arrives at 
the producers house, it is quickly made quite apparent that his 
only motive for asking her there is to sleep with her.  She 
refuses his advances and is thrown out without haste.  Outside,
she bumps into a somewhat insane homeless man (played very well
by Peter Greene), who starts literally trashing the street.
He exits, and leaves the woman to be arrested by a police officer
who offers to drop all the charges in exchange for "sexual
favours".  She grabs his gun, handcuffs him to a tree, and steals
his uniform.  The remainder of the film follows her exploits as
she roams the streets of Los Angeles dressed as a cop.</P>
<P>"Bang" is one of those films that, while not heavy on plot, it
always keeps you interested, just because you want to see what's
going to happen next.  Through the main characters eyes, we get
to see both the perks (free coffee) and downsides (the 
responsibility of the job) that come with being a police officer.</P>
<P>The film has been shot in a kind of pseudo-documentary style, 
with a hand-held camera following the characters around.  Whether
this was a conscious decision by the director, Ash, or a budget-
induced constraint does not really matter; the technique gives
the movie a realistic feel. . .almost as though this actually
happened.  And on that same note, there isn't one performance
here that doesn't ring true.  Even the smallest roles have been
filled by actors who seem real.  It's not often you see a movie
in which no-name actors actually do better than mainstream
Hollywood actors would.</P>
<P>"Bang" is a movie that needs to be seen by Hollywood producers.
It just goes to show that you don't need a gargantuan budget
to create a good movie; you just need qualified actors and a
well-written script.</P>
