<P>If this person were alive today, the inventor of the gun might be troubled
by the lack of use of them at the proper time in 'Reindeer Games'.  While
there really are no good guys in this film, how many times have we seen the
Hollywood cliche of the villains holding someone at gun point while the
audience is frustrated that the silly and simple action of pulling the
trigger doesn't come at the right time.  Even when we don't want to see
someone get shot in the picture because he or she is the hero, it still
smacks of a lack of credibility.  The only time I found this acceptable was
in the old 'Batman' t.v. series, where the villains wouldn't or couldn't
shoot straight and the dynamic duo was always put into some kind of campy
trap from which they always managed to escaped.  To roughly quote 1976's
'Network', "No matter how much trouble the hero is in, just look at your
watch and you'll know when all will be resolved".  By rights, Ben Affleck
should have died about five times throughout the course of 'Reindeer Games'
and while I'm not giving away the fact as to whether he lives or dies in the
film, the keyword for this film is "duh"!</P>
<P>Affleck plays Rudy, a convict on the verge of release where, when released,
he will meet with a young woman who will help him get his life back on
track, supposedly.  He's never met her and she's never met him.  They met
through letters written.  But wait!  This is only a smoke screen.  Rudy
passes himself off as his cell mate, a man who was killed in a prison riot
who was supposed to meet this woman.  While finding the company of women
irresistible after getting released, Rudy gets more than he bargained for
when his new main squeeze Ashley (Charlize Theron), has a supposed brother
named Gabriel (Gary Sinise) who wants Rudy to help him knock over a casino.
It seems that Rudy's cell mate wrote Ashley that he used to work at this
casino, run on a native American reservation in Michigan, near Detroit, and
Gabriel, thinking this is him, wants instructions on the casino's
construction, pattern of security and other tidbits of information that will
make the casino heist successful.  Of course, Rudy can only bluff his way
through the scam since he isn't the right or real person intended for this
crime.</P>
<P>The film is so full of plot holes, you could drive a transport truck through
its openings and believe me, they try this also!  At one point Rudy tries to
explain that he isn't the right man and a hand written letter is produced by
Gabriel so to establish if this is really the right guy, why didn't they
just take a sample of Rudy's hand writing to see if it's the same guy.  Rudy
also has several chances to contact the police but we see that admitting to
the police that he is being held by criminals would be a violation of his
parole, therefore landing him back in the slammer.  Even if this is beyond
his control?  Several confrontations between the characters are also
laughable and the film is full of smug humour and novice plot twists that
don't seem exciting, plausible or even remotely entertaining and something
is also wrong when the leading man can't get any support from the audience.</P>
<P>Director John Frankenheimer ('The Manchurian Candidate', 'Birdman of
Alcatraz' 'Grand Prix', 'Black Sunday' and more recently 'Ronin', directs
this film with his usual look of perplexity.  The trouble is, that while
crafting his vision for this film, he overlooked the flaws in the screenplay
by Ehren Kruger who wrote 1999's 'Arlington Road', a crackling thriller
about
terrorism and 'Reindeer Games' doesn't even look like it's written by the
same guy.  Perhaps the desire to be completely different threw Kruger off
course and he faltered badly with this film.  Several other mishaps that
make the film somewhat aloof involve Rudy trying to make an escape from the
casino and getting caught in the wilderness.  We see that he has a knack for
hot wiring cars.  There are plenty around in this scene.  Why not just
hi-jack one and make a run for it.  Oh, the irony of it.  Geeeeeesh!</P>
<P>Characters played by Dennis Farina, James Frain, Donal Logue, Danny Trejo,
Clarence Williams III, and Issac Hayes are given no real focus and some of
them have major time on screen and this is only an added and unwanted
annoyance.  John Frankenheimer has tried his hand at hack second rate
pictures before such as '52 Pick-Up', 'The Holcroft Covenant' and 'Year of
the Gun' and had little or no success with them.  He is a director capable
of so much more but falls into the rut of making movies like 'Reindeer
Games' and for a man whose been in the business for 50 years, you'd think
he'd know better.  It isn't evident here.  Perhaps a better name for this
film would have been 'Silly Games'.</P>
