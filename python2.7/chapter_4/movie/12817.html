<PRE>Take Me Out to the Ball Game (1949)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 81</PRE>
<P>Musicals have long been out of vogue.  Thin plots, synchronized
dancing, corny arrangements and an emphasis on smiling and
costumes are not elements considered important to making
a great movie.</P>
<P>But Hollywood magic can visit musicals as well.  "Take Me Out
to the Ball Game" is surprisingly good, and only drags
for brief stretches in its second half.  The many musical
numbers are impressive, especially in the choreography.</P>
<P>Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly are the co-stars.  They are
star players on a circa 1910 baseball team, whose pennant
drive is threatened by a new owner and love interest
(Esther Williams) and a crooked gambler (Edward Arnold).
The shallow plot mostly serves to provide a series of settings
for the musical numbers.</P>
<P>Kelly and Sinatra have good chemistry together.  This was
the second and least-noted of their three films together,
coming after "Anchors Aweigh" and before "On the Town".</P>
<P>Sinatra may have been the better singer and the bigger
star, but Kelly was the better actor and dancer.  Kelly also
choreographed and directed the musical segments, which of
course are vital to the film's quality.</P>
<P>Esther Williams, one-time world record-holder for the
100 meter breaststroke, is relegated to a supporting role.
She has an obligatory bathing scene, wearing a one-piece suit
complete with bathing cap.  She is beautiful and confident,
and can even carry a tune.  Despite its obscurity, "Take Me Out
to the Ball Game" may be the best of her vehicles, discounting
"A Guy Named Joe" where she had a lesser role.</P>
<P>Betty Garrett plays Sinatra's love interest, just as she
would in "On the Town", also made in 1949.  She also appeared
in another watchable Williams vehicle from that same year,
"Neptune's Daughter."</P>
