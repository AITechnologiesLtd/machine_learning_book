<P>   While you're still trying to figure out the answer to the
classic philosophic question, "If a tree falls in the forest with
no witnesses, does the tree make a sound?" you can ponder
yet another one.  If a movie billed as a comedy has not a
single laugh, can it still be called a comedy?  This movie is
yet another parody of the type of event that is itself so
asinine it needs no satirist.  "Drop Dead Gorgeous"--so
named to exploit a double meaning (one of which being an
implicit quote from the principal character, "Drop dead,
gorgeous"--this film features vulgarity for its own sake rather
than crudeness in the pursuit of humor.  The inspiration for
the movie is perhaps Michael Ritchie's 1975 production
"Smile," which spotlighted a superior cast including Bruce
Dern, Barbara Feldon and Melanie Griffith centering on
behind-the-scenes activity at a California "Young American
Miss" pageant.  While "Smile" symbolized the emptiness of
American middle-class existence, "Drop Dead Gorgeous"
goes after targets too vulnerable to defend themselves,
including the mentally retarded, the deaf, poor Mexicans,
anorectics, small town rubes and trailer trash.  In taking pot
shots at rural hollowness, director Michael Patrick Jann does
not even opt for the miscarried outrageousness of Harmony
Korine's plotless dud "Gummo"--about poor white trash in a
desolate Ohio town whose citizens get their jollies from
shooting cats and selling the bodies to the local supermarket.</P>
<P>   "Drop Dead Gorgeous" features Kirstie Alley in the role of
Gladys Leeman, the town's richest women, who is emceeing
a teen beauty contest but is hardly impartial.  Her
own daughter, the vacuous Rebecca (Denise Richards), has
been trained by Gladys to push all the right buttons to score
points with the judges.  </P>
<P>  To get a measure of the numbing inauspiciousness of
Alley's performance as an assassin, one need only compare
her dispatch of the hackneyed role with that of Holly
Hunter--who won an Emmy for her portrayal of the obsessed
Houston housewife who plots to kill her daughter's
competitors for spots on the cheerleading squad in Michael
Ritchie's "The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged
Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom."</P>
<P>   Directed like Myles Berkowitz's "20 Dates" as a mock
documentary, scripter Lona Williams's story spotlights Alley's
ineptitude but focuses as well on the two 17-year-olds
considered the leading contestants in a teen beauty pageant
held in a heartland Minnesota town.  The confident Rebecca
Leeman (Denise Richards) is pitted against a perpetual
motion machine, Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), the
contestants now numbering eight when one of the girls is
mysteriously burned to death in a tractor accident.  Though
the two major contenders are from different sides of the track
in the town of just over 5,000 people, they are equally
ambitious. Ultimately, Amber will conclude the movie in a
scene that recalls Tracy Flick's triumph in "Election."  Director
Jann is himself attempting ineffectually to capitalize on that
film's critical and box office success.</P>
<P>   While vulgarity need not be off-putting and can, in itself, be
the source of considerable humor (witness the hilarious
inventiveness of "South Park" and "American Pie"), in "Drop
Dead Gorgeous" the boorishness is plain obtuse.  Examples:
Amber gleefully dances about the room of a funeral home
while she tackles her evening job as an embalmer.  The teen
queen of 1945 is taped moaning that after she won, she "did
not even get to keep my damn tiara--I had to turn it in for
scraps."  The billboard that announces the town to drivers
has an obsolete picture of its "oldest living Lutheran," but the
mayor groans that "sons of bitches would not even remove
the sign."  Two enormously fat guys--one a judge, the other
his mentally challenged brother--slap each other around for a
while.  A dance instructor teaches the teens their steps while
dangling a cigarette from her lips.  Later, when one of the
other judges, disgusted with the disabled man's behavior,
asks rhetorically, "Why don't you leave him with a sitter," he
gets the answer, "That's not nice--you know the sitter is
dead."  And when Amber's trailer mysteriously catches fire,
her mom, Annette Atkins (Ellen Barkin), is seriously burned,
her can of beer soldered to her hand.  </P>
<P>   One of the questions asked of the contestants by a judge is
"If you were a tree in the forest, what would it be?"  Here's
another one--for the production team: "If you were asked to
turn out a comedy, when do you think you could arrange it?"</P>
<PRE>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 96 minutes.  (C) 1999
