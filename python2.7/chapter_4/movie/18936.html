<P>   In New York the emergency medical technicians who drive
ambulances for critically ill people are complaining.  Their
jobs are being taken away by the fire department, whose
employees are doing the job of resuscitating folks with heart
attacks, people in shock from auto accidents, and fellows with
gunshot wounds. In L.A., apparently, the paramedics are still
on the job, but what is most amazing is that according to
Scott Ziehl's film, "Broken Vessels," these important workers
are taking home minimum wage despite the importance of
their job and the requirement of a college degree to hold such
a profession.</P>
<P>   People earning little more five dollars an hour typically work
two or more jobs to make ends meet. Tom (Jason London),
who has been driving an ambulance long enough to be the
senior person in a small company, sells drugs on the side,
which is bad enough.  What's worse is that he also does
drugs, and does them on the job--smoking what looks like
crack which he takes in an unconventional way.  Jimmy
(Todd Field) has the misfortune of being teamed up with
Tom.  Jimmy is a clean-cut lad from Altoona, Pennsylvania,
recently out of college, who has moved out west to L.A. to
make a clean break.  He has a skeleton in his closet whose
bones rattle each time cinematographer Antonio Calvache
teases us with a quick flashback to Pennsylvania's Amish
country.</P>
<P>   Recent films about the drug world have contributed some
original takes on substance abuse.  "Trainspotting,"
considered by some to be pro-narcotics, has one character
say that heroin will give the taker a high equivalent to an
orgasm multiplied 1,000 times.  "Leaving Las Vegas" uses
two top actors to capture the poignancy of a down-and-outer
on a suicidal mission to America's gambling capital. 
"Permanent Midnight" focuses on a guy who is derailed from
the fast track in the movie business because of his constant
need to shoot up.  The trouble with "Broken Vessels," by
contrast, is its conventionality.  The movie looks from
beginning to end like the sort of film you'd show to high-
school kids about the tragic consequences of taking
substances that speed up the heart or quiet anxieties.  Never
in a single moment do we find out what makes narcotics
attractive to these people. They take the poison because they
are addicted, yet even at the moment of the rush, they seem
to feel nothing but relief from the pangs of withdrawal.</P>
<P>   The stereotypes include an old man, Tom's grandfather
(Patrick Cranshaw), who lives in a nursing home and relies
on bi-weekly visits from Tom to keep him from climbing the
walls.  Yet another is the obligatory good girl, here played by
Roaxana Zal who, as Elizabeth the nursing intern, is attracted
by Jimmy but is put off after being stood up for a date with no
explanation.  Later she re-appears to offer him the option of
checking into a clinic to get clean.  </P>
<P>   Scott Ziehl trots out the fast girls, the violent sellers on the
street, the justifiably irritable manager of the ambulance
business, Mr. Chen (James Hong)--who offers a comic touch
to the proceedings.  The film excels in showing Jimmy's
descent under the satanic guidance of his partner and
mentor, Tom, from Mr. Clean to a thoroughly burnt-out case. 
Todd Field and Jason London make a good, credible pair,
even giving the impression that there's a straight line from
drinking beer out of a bottle to snorting, sniffing and shooting
the harder stuff.  But "Broken Vessels" is weighed down by
its didacticism.  If addicts puke behind their living room sofas
without bothering to clean, lose girls friends, jobs, money,
and even get shot at, what did they ever see in these
chemicals in the early stages?  Ziehl never shows us the
attraction of the substances--only the freaks, the promiscuous
women, the babbling neighbor, even an explosion in a drug
factory that blows up a ramshackle house.  And despite the
use of the occasional fast-motion photography and
hallucinogenic frames, the story is told in a surprisingly
prosaic manner.</P>
