<P>Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982) 98min</P>
<P>The first thing that struck me about this film was the title. First of all
it is a sequel (third in the series!!) and second of all "season of the
witch" was such a ill thought of sub-title. I was not exactly expecting the
best in the Halloween series.</P>
<P>I was barely born when this film was first released but I hear that it was
not exactly a popular film. One cinema manager once said (refering to Texas
Chainsaw Massacre 4) "We have not seen a public reaction to a film like
this, with rioting in the cinema, and arm rests thrown at the screen, since
the reaction to Halloween III". I must say however I was pleasently
surprised.</P>
<P>This is the only film in the series which does not have "Michael Myers" as
its main character. Instead, having nothing to do with the other films, it
takes on an interesting story about a halloween mask factory trying to take
over the world. I know it sounds very tacky, but the resulting film is
quiet scary. The director, Tommy Lee Wallace, plays an advertisement for
the masks, over and over again throughout the film. The ad's eerie tune
lingers in your mind as you hear it hibitually.</P>
<P>I have only seen the first three Halloween films, but the only one that
even remotely compares to the original in suspense has got to be Halloween
III.</P>
<P>I highly recommend it to the Horror fan who has seen everthing.</P>
