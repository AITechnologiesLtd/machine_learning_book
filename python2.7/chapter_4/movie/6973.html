<P>There is a danger in producing films that take on `big themes',
especially if they spring from masterfully written source material:
they give more for the critics to pick over.  Despite much praise for
his first two features, stage-director-turned-film-director Mike
Nichols was unable to avoid dismissive reviews for his
much-anticipated film version of Joseph Heller's classic anti-war
novel.  But perhaps filmgoers were expecting too much - if not the
impossible.  As anyone who has read the book can tell you, adapting
Heller's labyrinthine work for the screen would be a monumental task
for even the most seasoned of film-makers.  It's time to give Nichols
his due: he and writer Buck Henry (who also appears in the film)
manage to retain the novel's panoply of characters and distinctive
blend of satire, philosophy, farce, and horror.  Nichols also makes an
effort to retain the mood of the book by casting Alan Arkin in the
pivotal role of Yossarian -  his charismatic performance effectively
guides the audience through the fractured narrative of Heller's story.</P>
<P>In essence, film is about Yossarian, a bombardier trapped in a WWII
airforce base situated on a Mediterranean island.  He wants out of the
war, but the army has conveniently provided a loophole - catch-22 -
that will prevent him from ever leaving until they are through with
him.  The circular logic of this catch is Heller's metaphor for the
self-serving logic of the military in wartime, and Nichols exploits
its farcial nature for all it's worth, keeping much of Heller's giddy
dialogue: sometimes it's hard to tell if a scene is being played
straight, or for laughs.  Nichols confounds this further by compiling
a staggering cast of actors both comic (Bob Newhart, Richard Benjamin,
Norman Fell, Jack Gilford) and dramatic (Martin Balsam, Anthony
Perkins, Jon Voight - memorable as Milo Minderbinder - Martin Sheen,
and Orson Welles, who was offered the part of General Dreedle after
being beaten to the punch by Nichols in adapting Heller's book for the
screen).  Who plays who isn't really important anyhow: each character
is so wound up in their own private routines, schemes, or enterprises
that they remain oblivious of their absurd situation.  It's only
Yossarian, who appears to be in a state of extreme agitation
throughout the film, that really seems to know what's going on - but
as he is brainwashed by the eponymous catch-22 even he can't be sure
whether or not he is crazy.</P>
<P>As would be expected from Nichols, performances from the cast are fine
all round, but he also uses his setting to explore cinematic territory
unavailable in the domestic scenarios of his earlier films.  He uses
every inch of the wide-screen frame to good effect - this is
definitely one to see in a cinema.  Also with:  Art Garfunkel, Paula
Prentiss, Charles Grodin, Bob Balaban.</P>
