<PRE>                                    CON AIR
                       A film review by Fred M. Hung
                        Copyright 1997 Fred M. Hung</PRE>
<P>When the Bruckheimer/Simpson team brought Crimson Tide to the screen
back in 1995, I was incredibly surprised.  I had previously associated
the duo with such popcorn successes as Top Gun and Days of Thunder. 
Never did I expect a clever and taught thriller that challenged the
audience with theoretical dilemmas as well as entertained with gripping
drama.  When The Rock emerged in 1996, again, I was impressed by the
charismatic chemistry between Connery and Cage, in addtion to the
awesome performance of the misled anti-villain like Ed Harris' Gen.
Hummel.</P>
<P>After the death of Simpson, Bruckheimer ventures alone (you can tell by
the slightly modified lightning intro that marks each of their films)
with his entry into the summer season, CON AIR, with Nicolas Cage, John
Malkovich, and John Cusack.  Cage is a US Army Ranger wrongfully
imprisoned.  Unluckily, on day of his parole he finds himself on a
hijacked plane filled with the Justice Department's most wanted.</P>
<P>Simply put, to the extent that a film's purpose is to entertain, Con Air
accomplishes just that -- and no more.  Many of the current
Bruckheimer/Simpson patents are present, including the news footage of
military action to start, the very Hans Zimmer-ish score by Mark
Mancina, and a script that again seems edited by Tarantino.  Since the
script does not offer much range within the protagonists, Cage comes off
competent, as does Cusack.  Cage's character, Sgt. Cameron Poe, is
almost caricature -- terse, deadly, but at heart a family man.  Cusack's
Deputy Marshal Larkin, however, is basically Cusack with gun.  </P>
<P>Malkovich, however, is underused.  While certainly capable of so much
more (refer to In the Line of Fire, Dangerous Liasons, and the Killing
Fields), Malkovich is just having fun in his maniacal portrayal of Cyrus
"the Virus."  To his credit, the image of Malkovich holding Cage's bunny
hostage will should go down in the annals of film history as one of the
funniest hostage moments ever.  Unfortunately, much of these clever
moments are eclipsed by pyrotechnics.  </P>
<P>Buscemi steals the show in his limited moments.  It is difficult to
describe accurately his role, a sort of Shakespearean narrative clown
crossed with Hannibal Lecter.  His presense in the film is nonetheless
ambitious as the screenwriters remind us that all is in good fun.  </P>
<P>The action is solid.  Bruckheimer and company are geniuses when
combining testosterone soundtracks, TNT, and intense close ups.  In a
way, expectation may be Con Air's greatest enemy.  The audience is
already expecting high explosions, chases, and mounting body counts. 
Although Con Air delivers adequately all these, in the end one might
leave somewhat anti-climatic.  After all, how thrilling is it to put on
a familiar pair of old shoes?</P>
