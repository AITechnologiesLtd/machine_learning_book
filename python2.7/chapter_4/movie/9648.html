<P>MONDO (France,1996) *** 3/4.  Directed by Tony Gatlif. Written by
Jean-Marie Le Clezio  from his short story. Produced by Michèle Ray-Gavras.
Cast: Ovidiu Balan, Pierette Fesch, Philippe Petit, Jerry Smith, et al. A
Shadow release. In French with subtitles.77 min. Not rated.</P>
<P>First things first. I would give "Mondo" a rating of G while stressing that
adults will find this wonderful, warm realistic-poetic work totally
engrossing. Mondo is  a handsome gypsy boy who cannot read, does not know
his age (he must be 10 or 11), whose provenance is unexplained and whom we
meet wandering about Nice, that picturesque city  of 350,000 people on the
French Riviera, close to Monte-Carlo and the Italian border.</P>
<P>In 1929, Jean Vigo who was  called "The Rimbaud of cinema" and died at age
29, made an experimental, classic short called "A Propos de Nice," in which
he treated slices of life in that city, juxtaposing with irony the wealthy,
mostly old, tourists and with affection, the locals. In a sense, "Mondo" is
the inheritor of that film. It is about the meanderings of its young
protagonist, explorations that are put in the context of the city and
several Nicois (Nice dwellers). All , like Mondo, are treated with immense
sympathy and not a hint of mockery. And none of them reacts to the
youngster in the standard way, i.e. "Gypsies are undesirables, thieving and
smelly."</P>
<P>All the performers are amateurs. Mondo is played by Ovidiu Balan, a
Rumanian gypsy about whom I know nothing (I am writing this review without
benefit of press information) except that after the movie was made he and
his family were deported back to Rumania.  He lives by what is commonly
known as "his wits, " but without  all the tricks and illegalities this
expression may imply.</P>
<P>First he is seen at one of those great farmer markets where he scrounges
for discards. He sleeps outdoors on the grass. (In a surreal sequences, he
is near statues of famous men and there's a voice-off commentary. One of
the busts is Balzac's)  \</P>
<P>One of the first locals he meets is a man on a bench, reading Flaubert .
Out of a blue sky the kid asks him "Will you adopt me?" It's a brief,
heart-rending moment that will be repeated later to a passerby. (In both
cases the boy runs off). Mondo is curious, friendly, lovable. His smile is
infectious, irresistible. I would adopt that boy without thinking twice
about it.</P>
<P>He then encounters a kindly ex-sailor who is fishing, teaches the child,
discusses exotic ports with him, and later teaches him the alphabet in the
most ingenious way. In succession, Mondo also meets  aged Dadi (aka Dove
Man, as he keeps two birds) who is played by real homeless Scot; a magician
played by  famous tighrope walker Philippe Petit; an older woman, Thi Chin
in her big house and garden (of Eden?) who cares for him when he has a
fever and befriends him. Seeing her garb he asks  "Are you Vietnamese?"
"No, I am a Jew born in Vietnam and I came here years ago." The cast
includes a Turkish Kurd woman, a political refugee, who sings
beautifullyand adds to the splendid variety of music here;  a postman who
is areal postman; and other "real people."</P>
<P>As Mondo explores the world around him, looks and listens, asks questions,
tries his first elevator, gets soaked in rain and still scrounges for food,
the persons he comes in contact with are just about all kind, including a
bakery lady who repeatedly offers him bread. There'something both subtle
and obvious as Mondo is placed in an environment of enticing French foods,
supermarkets, fresh fruit and  vegetables--yet at times has to get his
sustenance from nature.</P>
<P>J.M. Le Clezio, one of France's best writers, has found an ideal director
in Mr. Gatlif. Their collaboration results in something entirely fresh,
novel, yet in the great French tradition of films in which children are
seen with undertsanding, love, realism but also imagination. As in the
classic "Zero for Conduct" by the same Jean Vigo mentioned above. As in the
films of Francois Truffaut and several filmmakers of all periods.</P>
<P>Is it an accident that a welfare officer says that Mondo is "a wild child,"
the title of a Truffaut movie? Or that in Truffaut's "The 400 Blows" the
child hero worships Balzac whose statue we see and who is also the author
of "Colonel Chabert," a name that appears on a prospectus that the postman
hands Mondo as "mail for you"?</P>
<P>The appeal, the warmth of the boy Mondo and of the movie "Mondo" cannot be
described. Tony Gatlif, the filmmaker of Rom (Gypsy) lineage who made,
among other Rom-themed movies, "Latcho Drom," combines in with much talent
and in credible ways, fact and imagination, emotion without sentimental
schlock, selective realism --extremely well photographed and edited
--without cheating.</P>
<P>Mondo disappears as mysteriously as he had appeared. His absence, like
Gypsy magic, causes odd perturbances. The last  words of the film's are
voice-off: "We looked for Mondo everywhere. Then we forgot a little."</P>
