<P>GODZILLA (1998) ZERO STARS (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (<A HREF="mailto:wchamber@netcom.ca">wchamber@netcom.ca</A>)
(Ugh. This is becoming so routine... Just visit my damn website, FILM
FREAK CENTRAL.
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/7504">http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/7504</A>
Send me some hate mail, recommend a movie, read the journals...just
have as good a time as you can there.)</P>
<P>starring Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria, Maria Pitillo, Godzilla
screenplay by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich
directed by Roland Emmerich</P>
<P>The team of Emmerich and Devlin scored a giant b.o. hit last time out
with their alien picture, Independence Day.  That film was critically
dissed largely because of their use of stereotyping and clichees to
define an ensemble of characters: we knew who the smart guy was
because he wore glasses and a pocket-protector; who the gay guy was
because he ran around squealing like a panzie for his mother; who the
hero was because he promised to "whoop E.T.'s ass". This time out,
Devlin and Emmerich have solved the problem by making no attempts
whatsoever to define their ensemble of characters. Not only is New
York City a shambles when Godzilla is through with it, so is the film,
a disaster-picture in every sense of the word. This may be the most
uncompelling summer movie contender in the history of the sport.</P>
<P>I'm going to give away the plot of this movie with relish, for all the
security surrounding this non-story before the May 20th release was
non-sensical, to say the least. To say the most, it was merely an
attempt to keep the publicity machine well-oiled: on-screen sponsor
Fruit-of-the-Loom is entangled in a breach of contract lawsuit after
revealing early sketches of Godzilla on the Internet. How about suing
Steven Spielberg for revealing the new monster's design in his
Jurassic Park films? For Godzilla, like the movie itself, is a most
derivative creation.</P>
<P>The movie begins with Broderick driving out into an open field at
Chernobyl to examine some mutated earthworms.  Then a helicopter
inexplicably lands before him, and stiffs in suits exit the chopper
and announce to him that his years of earthworm research have ended:
he has been reassigned to investigate giant footprints. Broderick
deduces that the footprints belong to a Polynesian lizard that has
grown to an enormous size because of "years of French Polynesia
nuclear testing". His hypotheses - which also include that the beast
is the first of its kind, and that it is pregnant (he deduces that one
with the aid of an over-the-counter home pregnancy kit) - eventually
prove accurate.  For reasons never explained, asexual Godzilla wishes
to lay his eggs in "The City That Never Sleeps" (that's how New
York City is billed!). So he does, in Madison Square Gardens, but only
after crushing a lot of taxi cabs - NO MENTION OF HUMAN CASUALTIES IS
MADE. So Broderick, his stupid ex-girlfriend (Pitillo), a
French-Polynesian top secret agent guy (Reno--the most enjoyable human
presence here), and a ballsy cameraman (Azaria) team up to get trapped
in Madison Square Gardens.</P>
<P>The filmmakers' idea of genuine comic relief is to name the mayor
Ebert (rotund Michael Lerner) and have his advisor, Gene (haha),
always slap Ebert's hand away from food. Oh, look, a fat guy wants
food. The filmmakers' idea of a plot development is to have said
stupid girlfriend - who is also an aspiring anchor beauty - discover a
top secret videotape with footage of a frightened Japanese man
repeating "Gojira...Gojira..." She knows this is a top secret tape
because it is labeled such, "Top Secret", and she seems to know how
bottom-of-the-barrel her news program is because they take the bait
and air the snippet as a top story. Then Ebert wants more food! Said
broadcast winds up getting Broderick fired, so he and Pitillo have a
fight, and break up again. Who cares? Until the night before, they
hadn't seen each other for EIGHT YEARS. And when they met up again, it
was only to EXCHANGE THE WORST WRITTEN EX-LOVER TO EX-LOVER DIALOGUE
THE SCREEN HAS POSSIBLY EVER KNOWN. To quote Ebert - the critic, not
the mayor (by the way, during the two times I met the man, he was not
eating) - in his review of North, I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate this
movie. GODZILLA is an entirely charmless 139 MINUTES(!), unlike the
Japanese counterparts which inspired it. Boring as hell, seemingly
edited with a machete and some Scotch tape, weighted by a screenplay
that makes Titanic's read like Edward Albee, GODZILLA is the worst
cinematic experience I've had in years. Flamers, take note: I am not
demanding hyperrealism from a movie about a giant lizard, nor am I
requesting good dialogue, even. I'm asking for entertainment, pure and
simple: for the reported $130 million budget, I want to mainline
unadulterated summer movie fun. Not even the effects held my interest
- they turn to digital mush in too many spots.</P>
<P>If this is reading a little too much like one of Harry Knowles'
Ain't-It-Cool caveman test-screening reviews, my apologies. It isn't
too often a movie sparks a fire in me like GODZILLA, a steady, burning
rage. Independence Day was a terrible movie, but terribly
fun. GODZILLA's cinematogrpohy and production design can't even match
the pastel appeal of ID4's images: almost every shot is a rain-soaked
bore. (Ladies and gentlemen, let's officially seal that moratorium on
homages to Blade Runner.) Perhaps I can't fully convey why I despised
this movie so much without slipping into incoherence, but it looks
like I may not be alone in my camp: despite months of hype, the
weekend late show of GODZILLA at a brand new multiplex saw an audience
of half-capacity. If we're lucky, Godzilla's damage won't end at the
credits: it will put an end to bloated, scriptless event pictures for
a good long while.</P>
