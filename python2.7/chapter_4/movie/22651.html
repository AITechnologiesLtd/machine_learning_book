<PRE>                            THE THIRD MIRACLE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     In the immortal words of singer Fats Waller, "I believe in
miracles...."  Who else is a believer?  Agnieszka Holland, best known
for poetic period pieces like WASHINGTON SQUARE and trite garbage like
TOTAL ECLIPSE, who finally ventures into the modern era (or reasonably
modern: 1979) with THE THIRD MIRACLE.</P>
<P>     Based on the poorly-received novel of the same name, THE THIRD
MIRACLE follows a down-and-out drunk of a priest named Frank Shore
(Harris), on his assignment to debunk (or bunk) a claim of sainthood
regarding a Chicago woman named Helen.  The main case for sainthood?  A
young girl who prayed to the woman has been cured of lupus.  Now the
statue where that girl prayed is crying Helen's Type-A human blood.
People are flocking from around the nation.</P>
<P>     Shore, a man of lost faith who lives in a tenement building, is
called back to active service thanks to a perfect record of finding
fault with every saint applicant that crosses his path.  During his
investigation, he reexamines that faith, spars with an archrival
Archbishop (Mueller-Stahl), has a very unlikely and unbelievable fling
with Helen's daughter (Heche), and generally becomes an all-around good
guy.</P>
<P>     The film, on the whole, is intriguing and keeps your interest
throughout.  It's hardly a laugh riot:  This is serious stuff, and
oftentimes it's a damnation of Catholicism.  It's DOGMA, but with
feeling.  But the film's self-importance and rambling, often-lost
narrative (a perpetual problem in Holland's work) robs it of its
luster.  For religion buffs, it's a must-see.  For the typical
moviegoer, it's a toss-up.</P>
<P>     One question by way of spoiler (quit reading now if you intend to
see the film):  What's the deal with the title?  Catholic tradition
requires three miracles for sainthood, and Helen languishes with a mere
two.  At the film's end, Anne Heche shows up with a newborn daughter.  A
more cynical critic might point out that *that* would be a miracle
indeed.</P>
