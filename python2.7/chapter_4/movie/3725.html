<PRE>                                 CONGO
                               [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Rob Furr
                        Copyright 1995 Rob Furr</PRE>
<P>     Ask yourself this question: "How much would I pay to spend about
two hours in an air-conditioned, dark room?" If your answer is higher
than the price of a movie ticket in your area, then, by all means, go
see CONGO this week.</P>
<P>     That's the only real reason to go see CONGO.  If the temperatures
in your area are above ninety degrees, it's humid, the air conditioning
in your apartment is out, there's only one theatre in town, and you
only have two hours to kill before you have to be somewhere, then it's
possible that going to see CONGO might be worth while.</P>
<PRE>     Maybe.</PRE>
<P>     It's been a long time since I've seen a big-budget summer action
film as boring as CONGO.  It's been about as long since I've seen a
movie as badly made as CONGO, and, I hope, it'll be even longer since I
see a movie like this again.  (Of course, with WATERWORLD coming out
soon, my hopes are not high.)</P>
<P>     Remember those dreadful cheap jungle flicks from, oh, the
mid-eighties?  THE PERILS OF GWENDOLINE IN THE LAND OF YIK YAK?  That
sort of thing?  The makers of CONGO obviously derived their inspiration
from those films, instead of the jungle action films from the black and
white era that were actually good.  The plot makes as much sense (i.e.,
none,) the characterization is of the same quality (i.e., rotten,) the
acting is of the same caliber (i.e., pretty damn rotten,) and the
effects are just as good (i.e., not very.)</P>
<P>     The story is ... well, I'll try to sum up: An expedition to the
Congo finds really nifty diamons, which can be used to turn a laser
into the Death Star's main gun.  Unfortunately, just as they find the
laser, the expedition gets killed by ugly thingies.  The leader of the
expedition is the son of the evil nasty businessman, who sends his
son's fiance' into the jungle to find the diamonds.  He doesn't care
about his son, he just wants the diamonds, because, apparently, he
needs a laser that can vaporize people on the Moon.  This irritates the
fiance' to no end.  Meanwhile, a primatologist and his buddy (who has
VICTIM stamped on his forehead in big letters from the instant he
appears) decide that their ape, who's learned sign language, wants to
go home.  They can't afford to take her home, until a Rumanian shows up
and offers to pay for the trip.  Meanwhile, the fiance also shows up,
takes over the expedition, and everybody flies to the Congo, where the
evil nasty businessman has arranged for porters and equipment and
guns.  At this point, for no readily apparent reason, things start
exploding.  Things continue to explode for about half an hour, as the
expedition, which is showing signs of Hollywood Conflict, proceeds into
the jungle.  We discover that the Rumanian wants to discover the Lost
City of Zinj, where Solomon got his diamonds from, and he thinks the
ape that's going home knows where it is.  We also discover that Tim
Curry can't do a Rumanian accent, but that's not important right now.
What is important is that nothing much happens for another half an
hour, until the expedition reaches the Lost City of Zinj, and people
start getting their heads ripped off.  One thing leads to another, and
eventually everybody dies except for three people, who escape from the
ugly thingies, the exploding volcano, and the Shaking Hollywood
Disaster Landscape (left over from EARTHQUAKE, I'd assume), in a
balloon, which completely ignores the fact that, during the half an
hour when things exploded, we discovered that the area around the Congo
is filled to the brim with surly people with anti-aircraft missiles who
don't like people flying over the landscape.  Regardless, the evil
nasty businessman gets his, the ape gets laid, and everybody who's
still alive is happy.</P>
<PRE>     There.</PRE>
<P>     You now no longer need to see CONGO.  You'll note, by the way,
that the ugly nasties, who are the major advertising point of the film,
are pretty damn unimportant.  They rip everybody's heads off, but in
such a way that you don't *care* who ripped whose head off.  For many
of these characters, missing one's head could only improve things.</P>
<P>     However, the plot synopsis only shows one thing--the utter
silliness of the plot, and a silly plot is not enough to make a movie
bad.  What makes this movie bad is the rest of it--*every* aspect of
it is rotten.  The cinematography manages to completely fail at
capturing any sense of spectacle or grandeur.  The special effects are
bad--the people in gorilla suits look like people in gorilla suits,
which, in a film like this, is fatal.  The sets look like sets.  You
can tell immediately when the film moves from shot-on-location to
shot-in-a-warehouse-somewhere.  The acting is boring (except for Ernie
Hudson and Bruce Campbell, who are so much better than the rest of the
actors in this piece of tripe that you feel sorry for them wasting
their talent like this.)</P>
<P>     And, what's more offensive, it's stereotypical Crichton.  Yup.
Mister I-Hate-Science himself is responsible for this travesty.
There's a truly insulting sequence where one scientist, who
theoretically has a doctorate, asks another scientist why he taught an
ape to speak.  The answer is *incredibly* annoying ("No reason," he
says,) and the question is more so--in essence, the screenplay
portrays science as something that is done for either a: completely
ruthless exploitation, or b: aesthetic reasons which will never ever
amount to anything.  I can only imagine what happened to Crichton when
he was young: possibly, he was frightened by Mister Wizard and has
harbored a deep and abiding loathing of anyone daring to figure
anything out ever since.</P>
<P>     The movie doesn't even get bad *enough*, which is the worst bit of
all.  If it had gone through rottenness and out the other side, it
could have been entertaining, if not good.  It could have tried for
camp, for tongue-in-cheek thrills.  It didn't.  It played it straight,
and it's the worse for it, because it is so utterly, unredeemably
boring.  On the Furr Scale (I rate films on ambition as well as quality
- you can't rate EVIL DEAD II on the same scale as THE RIGHT STUFF, for
instance.  An okay movie that tried to be great is different from a
great 'bad' movie.  ROBOCOP, for instance, is a three-star three star
movie; a pretty good movie that aimed fairly high.  HEAVEN'S GATE was a
one-star four star movie; a bad movie that tried to be great.  SOAPDISH
was a three-star two star movie; a very good movie that didn't aim as
high as it might,) CONGO is a one-star three star movie.  Boring, dull,
and uninvolving are the *best* words to describe it--I could be more
descriptive, but that'd make this review R, instead of PG-13...</P>
