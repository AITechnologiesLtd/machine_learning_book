<PRE>                                    SCARFACE
                       A film review by David Landers
                        Copyright 1997 David Landers</PRE>
<P>RATING: *** 1/2 out of **** - 8.0 out of 10.0
CAST: Al Pacino (Tony Montana), Steven Bauer (Manolo Manny Ray), Michelle
Pfeiffer (Elvira), Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina), Robert Loggia
(Frank Lopez) 
DIRECTOR: Brian DePalma
CERTIFICATION: R (USA) for excessive language and violence 
YEAR OF PRODUCTION: 1983</P>
<P>SCARFACE, a remake of the 1932 film of the same name, is a very gripping
and, as far as I know, a true-to-life story of how power and violence lead
to corruption.  Al Pacino, as Tony Montana (for whom the movie is named),
also provides a brilliant performance as a Cuban refugee who comes to
America with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly
respected and feared drug lords in Miami.  Oliver Stone also penned the
screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles.</P>
<P>The film begins by disclosing the story of now Fidel Castro ordered
thousands of Cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the United
States.  Many of these Cubans had criminal records, such as Tony Montana,
a cocky, fast-talking man who has the look of crime.  Nearly right after
his arrival in Miami, Tony is thrust into the gangster life when he
participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry.</P>
<P>Along with his friend and partner, Manolo (Steven Bauer), Tony rises in
the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with Frank Lopez (Robert
Loggia), a high-roller in the organized crime field.  Tony also begins to
fall in love with Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer), who at the time was Frank's
lover.  Of course, sooner or later in this industry, betrayal and
corruption amount into a force greater than anything else, and Tony is one
of the ones who fall victim to this force.  This is not before he becomes
one of the most respected, and often feared, men in Miami.  Tony gets to
the point where he cannot trust anyone, and everyone he knows basically
feels the same way towards him.  No one can trust him, and basically, no
one does.</P>
<P>SCARFACE, although incredibly violent, is one of the best crime films of
its time and stands out as another great performance for Al Pacino.
Although he did not receive any recognition from the Academy for his
performance, it truly is a very good one.  In fact, his accent and facial
movements alone are enough in my mind to win at least a nomination
(although he did get a Golden Globe nomination). </P>
<P>Another element that stands out when someone mentions this film is the
profanity.  A figure tagged to the film boasts that the word "fuck" and
it's uses are uttered 206 times throughout the film, which is apparently a
record.  The thing is, the vulgarity fits rather well with the movie.  As
odd as it sounds, it's true.  In the end, SCARFACE is a very powerful film
that hits home hard.</P>
