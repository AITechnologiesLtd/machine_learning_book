<P>         At one time or another everyone has entertained the idea of
being able to go back and change the past. Usually, these thoughts are
sparked by some kind of regret: "If only I hadn't ordered another
pitcher. . ."; "If only I'd saved my money for tuition instead of buying
that New Kids on the Block box set. . ."; "If only I hadn't moved to
Portage. . ."</P>
<P> For John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel), the gaping hole in his life
is the absence of his father Frank (Dennis Quaid), a firefighter who
died while battling a blaze 30 years ago. Through a truly cosmic twist
of fate, John gets the opportunity to remedy that, only to learn that
once you start playing with the past, you invariably alter the present
as well.</P>
<P> That's the premise of "Frequency," a combination
fantasy/tearjerker/thriller with several dizzying twists. It's the first
screenplay of former film industry executive Noah Emmerich, and it all
but overflows with imagination, suspense and big ideas. Ultimately,
Emmerich gets so caught up in his own yarn he writes himself into a
corner, although the flawed finale by no means dampens the rest of the
movie.</P>
<P> In the same way "The Sixth Sense" managed to be something more
than a spooky horror film, "Frequency" sets itself apart from most
science-fiction by focusing on its human components instead of throwing
a lot of hardware in our faces. If there's no real familial resemblence
between the soft-spoken, dewy-eyed Caviezel (the sensitive,
contemplative soldier in "The Thin Red Line") and the congenial,
devil-may-care Quaid, it's still easy to buy them as father and son
because the actors establish such a wonderful rapport with each other.
Even more impressively, they do this without actually being able to
appear onscreen together: All Caviezel's scenes take place in 1999,
while Quaid's character is still in 1969. They communicate via an old
ham radio set John inherited from Frank.</P>
<P> As he demonstrated with Edward Norton and Richard Gere in
"Primal Fear," director Gregory Hoblit is not afraid to stand back and
give his performers some room when it's required. Quaid and Caviezel
reward him -- and us -- with thoughtful performances. As realities shift
and relationships change because of John's interference, Hoblit artfully
uses double exposures and slightly blurred images to reflect the
timeline being knocked out of whack.</P>
<P> The only really objectionable detour in "Frequency" is
Emmerich's inclusion of a plot strand involving a serial killer who
eventually figures prominently in the lives of both heroes. While some
of this is handled innovatively, it eventually overcomplicates an
already tricky storyline and Emmerich is forced to reach into the
reliable old cliche bag to come up with an ending for it. Hoblit adds
insult to injury by slapping a blaring Garth Brooks power-ballad over
top of the final scenes; it's shameless, but it sure isn't "Shameless."</P>
<P> Those missteps aside, "Frequency" is mostly fun and often
touching. It's surprisingly thought-provoking, too, since it's all but
impossible to leave the theater without asking yourself, "What if I
could reach back in time and save (insert relative or friend of your
choice)?" Maybe he or she could have prevented you from buying that New
Kids collection. James Sanford</P>
