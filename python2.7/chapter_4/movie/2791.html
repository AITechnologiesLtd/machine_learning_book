<P>     Where's John McClane when you need him?  If nothing else, the main
character from the two DIE HARD films would have livened up proceedings
in this pathetically inept psychological thriller.  Bruce Willis is in
desperate need of something to revive his gasping career, and I can
guarantee that COLOR OF NIGHT's Dr. Bill Capa isn't going to be the
actor's panacea.</P>
<P>     Jane March, taking on her first big Hollywood role, doesn't appear
clothed any more often here than during her previous screen credit, THE
LOVER.  Admittedly, she is a very alluring woman, but this particular
motion picture needs more than her exotic sexuality to save it--a
whole lot more, in fact.</P>
<P>     By nature, thrillers rely heavily upon their plots, and it's in
that area that COLOR OF NIGHT displays its greatest weakness.  The
storyline is routine and the so-called "twists" are obvious enough to
be guessed far in advance of their revelation.  This rather unfortunate
situation leads the audience to believe that the on-screen characters,
who are far behind the viewers in their deductions, are stupid.</P>
<P>     Bill Capa (Willis) was a thriving New York psychologist before one
of his more disturbed patients threw herself out his office window and
splattered all over the sidewalk below.  Unable to continue seeing
patients, Bill heads west to Los Angeles to spend time with his fellow
shrink and old college chum, Bob Moore (Scott Bakula).  It turns out to
be as much business as pleasure, though, as Bob asks him to sit in on
the infamous "Monday night group session."  There, Bill is introduced
to several interesting cases, including Sandra (Leslie Ann Warren), a
woman obsessed with sex; Buck (Lance Henriksen), a bitter, aging man
who can't get past the deaths of his wife and daughter; and Clark (Brad
Dourif), a lawyer suffering from an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
(Note that COLOR OF NIGHT isn't particularly sympathetic towards any
character with psychological problems.)</P>
<P>     When Bob is murdered several days later, Bill believes the guilty
party to be a member of this group, although the police detective in
charge of the case, Lt. Martinez (Ruben Blades), suspects him.
Beginning with Bob's murder, things get progressively worse for the
visiting doctor, culminating in his car being rear-ended.  However,
when he gets a look at the driver, a hauntingly beautiful young woman
named Rose (Jane March), he starts to believe that maybe things aren't
as bad as they seem.  That is, until he opens his mailbox and a
rattlesnake pops out.</P>
<P>     The most interesting elements of COLOR OF NIGHT deal with the
characters' psychological dysfunctions, subjects which are given the
most perfunctory treatment allowed by the needs of the script.  What
we're left with is a big-budget exploitation film that suffers from
awful directing.  Usually it's the actors who go over-the-top, but this
time that fault can be ascribed to the people behind the camera.
Someone involved with this production certainly fell in love with slow
motion shots.</P>
<P>     It would be nice to say that somewhere amidst this massive
overdramatization, there's something to redeem the film, but about the
best I can say is that the dialogue between Capa and Martinez is honed
to a fine edge.  Those who stick through COLOR OF NIGHT to the end are
in for a rather unpleasant surprise.  It would be nice if it was
possible to believe that the final ten minutes represent a clever
parody of the norms of the genre, but that would be giving COLOR OF
NIGHT too much credit.  It takes itself distressingly seriously, which
is something few viewers will be able to do.</P>
