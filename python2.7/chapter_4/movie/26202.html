FLESH & BLOOD (1985)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Most of the books belonging to Fantasy genre tend to base
their imaginary worlds on medieval Europe, often painting
them in most positive light and portraying Middle Ages as
simpler, kinder and gentler time than our own. This
perception of Middle Ages seems to be dominant in popular
culture including Hollywood, despite plenty of historical
books that use another, more appropriate term for that
period - Dark Ages. Although Hollywood had its share of
films that approached medieval Europe with more realism,
hardly anything can surpass FLESH & BLOOD, 1985 historical
adventure by Paul Verhoeven, Dutch director known for large
quantities of naturalistic sex and violence in his works.</P>
<P>The plot begins in some unidentified country of Western
Europe in 1501. Arnolfini (played by Fernando Hilbeck) is
nobleman who had been exiled from his city. He returns with
an army and takes the city back with a help of cutthroat
mercenaries, led by Captain Hawkwood (played by Jack
Thompson). Those mercenaries get carried away while raping
and plundering after the successful battle, so Arnolfini
decides to get rid of them with the help of treacherous
Hawkwood. Among mercenaries forced out of the city without
arms and loot is a band led by experienced Martin (played by
Rutger Hauer) who swears revenge on Arnolfini. Opportunity
for that arises when Arnolfini arranges political marriage
between his young bookworm son Stephen (played by Tom
Burlinson) and princess Agnes (played by Jennifer Jason
Leigh). Future spouses are to be introduced to each other
during the hawking trip, but their caravan gets attacked by
Stephen's band. Before Stephen can do anything about it his
father is seriously wounded and future bride abducted, so he
must again use Hawkwood's services against his former
comrades. In the meantime, Stephen falls in love with his
beautiful prisoner, while his band takes shelter in isolated
country castle.</P>
<P>FLESH & BLOOD is the last Verhoeven's film made in Europe
and it shows. Unbound by Hollywood standards of censorship,
he filled the movie with incredible amounts of extremely
graphic violence and gore (which probably didn't cause much
problems with MPAA censors giving it R rating for American
distribution) and equally large amounts of sex and nudity
(which probably did). But large amounts of such scenes, and
some of them might be quite revolting (for example, one of
the most romantic scenes in the film happens bellow two
decomposing corpses), isn't exactly gratuitous. The idea of
Verhoeven and his co-screenwriter Gerard Soeteman was to
present Middle Ages as times when the human life was short,
hard and in constant danger of famine, plague and war (which
would, in one form or another, hit protagonists of this
film). Soeteman and Verhoeven argue that it was quite
natural for people to make some sense out of their miserable
lives by succumbing to all possible forms of
self-gratification, even those that might be most deplorable
to us who live in more civilised and enlightened times. Same
goes for the alternatives that went into another extreme in
the form of religious fanaticism. In order to present those
times with as much authenticity as possible, great deal of
work was invested in creation of late 15th Century costumes
and props, and Spanish locations provide very good scenery.
Basil Poledouris, author best known for his work on another
quasi-historic epic CONAN THE BARBARIAN, provided excellent
soundtrack. On the other hand, Verhoeven took too much
poetic license with some medical issues, thus compromising
credibility of the events in the last segment of the film.</P>
<P>However, medieval characters by being authentic created
certain problem for Verhoeven. Since all of them were, from
our standpoint, bad, it was hard to create believable
conflict. Verhoeven solved this problem by setting the plot
in time of Renaissance, when the old medieval world collides
with the forces of science and enlightenment. Those who are
familiar with this period of European history might find
plenty of references to the people and events of Renaissance
Italy - Stephen mentions Leonardo da Vinci as his role
model, Arnolfinis are based on Medicis, Hawkwood on real
life English mercenary leader of the same name, and Agnes is
described as "Prince Niccolo's" daughter - reference to
Niccolo Machiavelli and his "Prince", the book that seems
inspired by Agnes' actions in this film. This conflict
between Dark Ages and Renaissance is transformed in the
conflict between Stephen, noble who represents law, order
and civilisation on one side, and Martin who represents
primordial human instincts on the other side. Two of those
men are fighting for the love of Agnes who can't really make
up her mind until the very end of the film.</P>
<P>The acting in this film is very good. Rutger Hauer, who used
to play in many early Verhoeven films, has rather difficult
task of bringing complex and not very likeable character
closer to audience. His Martin might look superficial and
not very well written at first sight, but in a relatively
short time he must pass through various transformations -
from loving father to bloodthirsty soldier of fortune; from
passion to jealousy and murderous rage and vice versa.
However, this role relies more on Hauer's Bad Boy charisma
acquired in BLADE RUNNER than on some genuine breathtaking
acting effort. Naturally, his job was definitely
overshadowed by young Jennifer Jason Leigh. Her role of
Agnes was one of the first in which she displayed not only
her remarkable talent but also her taste for the roles of
women subjected to terrible ordeals. While most of the male
audience would appreciate her willingness to appear
completely nude in front of the camera, those who appreciate
good acting would be pleased even more. Her Agnes is one of
the most unconventional female characters we had opportunity
to see in modern cinema - young, innocent virgin who
suddenly becomes forced to make some rather practical
decisions and whose feelings take second place to her
interests. Tom Burlinson as the third part of love triangle,
seems somewhat shallow in comparison with Hauer's charisma
and Leigh's intensity, but this is all compensated with
great supporting cast where late Brion James and Bruno Kirby
are doing nice job, as well as almost unrecognisbale Jack
Thompson.</P>
<P>All in all, FLESH & BLOOD is not the film for the everyone,
but those who are able to overcome their squeamishness would
be awarded by one of the most underrated gems of 1980s.</P>
