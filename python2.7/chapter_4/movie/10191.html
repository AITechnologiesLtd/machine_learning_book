<P>Late at night, a beautiful young woman clinging to a makeshift raft looks 
up into the distance. The sky over the Atlantic Ocean is cloudless and 
her tired, desperate eyes gaze at the stars, glistening in the heavens so 
very far away. The scene is simple, elegant and haunting, nicely 
illustrating why "Titanic" works. Director James Cameron uses a grand 
sweeping backdrop to tell an elementary love story, and he tells it very 
well. "Titanic" contains some of the most spectacular visuals ever to 
appear on screen, but despite the jaw-dropping special effects, it's the 
human story that lingers after you leave the theater. Cameron has crafted 
an epic that triumphs because he remembered the crucial fact that affairs 
of the heart are far more compelling than any special effect.</P>
<P>"Titanic" received massive press coverage for production delays, clashes 
on the set and, of course, its record-breaking $200 million dollar budget.
 Over the last decade, we've become a nation of media insiders, receiving 
tremendous amounts of behind-the-scenes information from the 
entertainment world. At the end of each weekend, movie buffs study the 
box office results as if they were football scores, measuring the success 
of a movie by how much money it takes in, rather than by evaluating the 
actual substance of the film. It's an absurd mindset; one that needs to 
be put aside in order to best enjoy "Titanic." Production and budget 
information may be intriguing, but the only question that really matters 
is whether or not the film is any good, and "Titanic" certainly is. </P>
<P>The story begins in the present, as an explorer (Bill Paxton) and his 
crew search the wreckage of the Titanic for a legendary diamond called 
"The Heart Of The Ocean." Framing the historical saga with present-day 
scenes is more than a gimmick. Cameron uses the conceit to give the story 
an almost fairy-tale quality. Additionally, the crew presents a computer-
graphic simulation of the precise mechanics of the Titanic's sinking, 
making it much easier to follow what's happening when the disaster 
finally occurs. 
Rose, an elderly Titanic survivor (Gloria Stuart) joins the group after 
recognizing some personal possessions from a news report of the 
expedition. Peering into the glass of a hand mirror recovered from the 
ship, she quietly says "It looks the same as it did when I last saw it, 
but the reflection has changed." Her ancient eyes grow distant as she 
recounts her tale to the crew.</P>
<P>Cut to April, 1912, as the Titanic prepares for her maiden voyage. The 
opulent ship is magnificent, a paean to Victorian excess. Cameron 
provides a leisurely tour of the vessel as the passengers board and we 
meet the two central characters. Young Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) 
is desperately unhappy. She dreads her pending marriage to wealthy snob 
Cal Hockley (Billy Zane,) but can't break off the engagement. Despite 
their upper crust trappings, Rose and her mother (Frances Fisher) are 
broke and need the financial security the marriage will provide. In a 
moment of panic, Rose climbs over the rail of the ship, contemplating a 
suicidal dive, when penniless artist-at-large Jack Dawson (Leonardo 
DiCaprio,) who won his ticket in a poker game, intervenes and romance 
blossoms between the two.  </P>
<P>James Cameron states adamantly that "Titanic" is not a disaster film and 
he's right. Disaster films generally take 10-15 characters and try to 
tell all of their stories. The result is typically a jumbled mess of 
clichés. Cameron instead chose to take the very basic story of one 
representative couple and keep his focus there. Jack and Rose are just a 
couple of kids experiencing the awkwardness and exhilaration of first 
love, but they matter. Against the backdrop of a doomed vessel, these two 
young lovers come alive, and we feel all the poignancy of their situation.
 The magic Winslet and DiCaprio generate underscores the tragedy 
befalling everyone on the ship. </P>
<P>Winslet is splendid, by the way. Her wonderfully nuanced performance is 
among the years best. And DiCaprio, one of the most annoyingly smug 
actors in the business, is warm and winning here. </P>
<P>And then there's the wreck. Despite some occassionally shaky special 
effects, Cameron's realization of the Titanic's crash and collapse is 
flat-out breathtaking. He fills the screen with images of devastation on 
a scale unlike anything ever seen in a movie before. By putting the human 
story ahead of the effects, the nightmarish scenes carry an emotionally 
resonance far beyond mere spectacle. Tragic, beautiful and haunting, 
"Titanic" uses 90s technology to create an old-fashioned Hollywood 
blockbuster. It's three hours and fifteen minutes long, but the time 
flies by, and you can't pay a movie a higher compliment than that.</P>
