<PRE>_Steal_This_Movie_ (R) ***</PRE>
<P>        Just about one thing separates _The_Cell_ from a pulpy thriller
you'd find premiering on late night cable or your local video store.  But
it's that solitary difference that not only makes it special, but a
cinema landmark or sorts--the visionary imagination of director Tarsem
Singh.  In the hands of this music video veteran and first-time feature
director, a by-the-numbers story becomes the incidental backbone of one
of the most visually arresting films of recent memory.</P>
<P>        Writer Mark Protosevich obviously enjoyed
_The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_, for much of _The_Cell_'s story particulars
mirror those of the Oscar-winning film.  There is a young woman (Tara
Subkoff) trapped in a specialized prison in a dog-loving serial killer's
(Vincent D'Onofrio's Carl Stargher) lair--in this case, a glass cell that
is timed to incrementally fill with water, ultimately drowning the
prisoner.  There is an intelligent, resourceful young woman (here,
psychologist Catherine Deane, played by Jennifer Lopez) who must find out
the location of the latest victim before it's too late.  The high concept
twist?  Stargher is quickly captured, but soon comatose--and the Hannibal
Lecter whom Catherine must consult with is Sargher's own unconscious
mind, by way of a futuristic technology that enables her to enter the
dangerous world inside the killer's head.</P>
<P>        The sci-fi spin is intriguing, but not much else Protosevich
comes up with is.  For a film that is a psychological thriller, the
psychology is dismayingly simplistic.  In her exploration of Stargher's
mind, Catherine uncovers the root of his psychosis, and it's nothing
particularly shocking, if not completely predictable.  There is also a
fleeting reference to an incident in Catherine's past that is implied to
have factored in her career choice as child psychologist.  The heady
issues that are addressed are obvious and shallow.</P>
<P>        But when speaking of Singh's final, finished film, complaints
such as these are almost moot.  _The_Cell_ is a clear, classic case of a
director's vision invigorating standard material.  The film moves at an
effectively erratic pace: action in the real world moves fairly swiftly,
but once it's in the world of the mind, the pace becomes more languid,
befitting the surrealism of dreams.  It is in this latter realm that the
film really soars.  Dream worlds in movies are nothing new--witness the
oeuvre of David Lynch or, for a less highfalutin example, the
_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_ series--but the visual ideas put forth by Singh
are spectacular and unique; there's an atmosphere of excess that hasn't
even been reached in Lynch's famously bizarre work.  Tom Foden's
production design and Eiko Ishioka's costumes are gloriously outré, one
standout being the garishly frightening look of the "demon" Stargher and
his "throne room."  Also adding immeasurably to the mood are Paul
Laufer's grainy yet vibrant cinematography and the CGI work by visual
effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug.</P>
<P>        For all the film's flights of fancy and the script's derivative
nature, _The_Cell_ maintains a foothold in reality through the cast. 
Lopez is convincingly, appealingly smart and vulnerable as the headstrong
heroine; Vince Vaughn is effective in the by-the-book role of FBI Agent
Peter Novak; and D'Onofrio manages to make a lasting, eerie impression in
a very dialogue-light role.  The smaller roles surrounding the lead trio
are all played by familiar, reliable actors, such as Dylan Baker,
Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and Pruitt Taylor Vince.</P>
<P>        It has been said that it's not what you have, but what you do
with it, and that statement applies to Singh and _The_Cell_.  As written,
the film is not terrible, but just average; as executed, _The_Cell_ is,
to use a cliché, something that truly hasn't been seen before.</P>
<P>        D'Onofrio has a lot more lines--and more of a character to work
with--in _Steal_This_Movie_, Robert Greenwald's biography of legendary
'60s activist Abbie Hoffman.   D'Onofrio plays Hoffman, who is best
remembered as the flamboyant leader of the Chicago Seven, a protest group
that stood trial for inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic National
Convention.  This, as well as Abbie's retreat to the underground in 1974,
are the key moments in Greenwald's decades-spanning film, which uses a
flashback framework where a reporter for _Newsweek_ (Alan Van Sprang)
interviews loved ones (Abbie's wife Anita, played by Janeane Garofalo),
associates (Abbie's lawyer Gerry Lefcourt, played by Kevin Pollak), and
Abbie himself for a piece sometime in the '70s.</P>
<P>        Aside from Anita--and to a lesser extent Gerry and Johanna
Lawrenson (Jeanne Tripplehorn), the woman with whom Abbie hooks up while
underground--the background players in _Steal_This_Movie_ are barely
developed.  When the Chicago Seven stands trial, the presence of the
other six are barely noticeable, and we don't get to see exactly how some
relationships with key cohorts deteriorated.  However, this being a film
of Abbie Hoffman's story, this isn't too troublesome.  Greenwald (through
his energetic, sometimes anarchic, direction) and D'Onofrio (through his
charismatic performance) bring the man to vibrant life--emphasis on the
word "life."  Aside from the requisite "what happened" text card, the
film doesn't go near the circumstances surrounding his death, which is
perfectly in line with this engrossing film's intent: to be an
inspirational story about standing up for who you are and what you
believe in.</P>
