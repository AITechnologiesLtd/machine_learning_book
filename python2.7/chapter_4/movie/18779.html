<PRE>AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>"Do you smoke after sex?" the voluptuous Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth
Hurley) asks her new husband, Austin Powers (Mike Myers).  "I don't
know," he replies with his boyish grin.  "I've never looked."</P>
<P>Yes, that "International Man of Mystery" is back.  This time, in AUSTIN
POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, he goes back to England in the Swinging
Sixties to recover his mojo.  Can't be a world-famous playboy if your
mojo is not working.  Even a huge clump of chest hair two inches thick
isn't enough to wow the women if your mojo is missing.</P>
<P>In a hilarious opening sequence, Austin discovers that his television
remote control, including the fast forward, mute and alternate language
selection buttons, command his new wife.  Once again Myers, who shares
the writing credits with Michael McCullers, has clearly put enormous
thought and effort into the design of every sight gag and every snippet
of dialog in the movie.</P>
<P>The first AUSTIN POWERS film was a bit too cluttered and hurried, as if
Myers wanted to pack it with every joke imaginable.  This second one
goes down a bit easier since it is the more relaxed and good-natured of
the two.  This time Myers seems more confident of his abilities so he
gives his picture more room to breathe.</P>
<P>The good-spirited movie has great fun ripping off a host of other
pictures, especially Bond films.  The names of the characters, à la
Bond, are a particularly enjoyable source of mirth.  A Russian sexpot
named Ivana Humpalot (Kristen Johnston) engages Austin in an erotic game
of chess.  Another character's name is Robin Swallows, but her maiden
name was Spits.  You can probably guess where the writers go with that.</P>
<P>Full of self-deprecating humor, the movie is never happier than when it
is making fun of itself.  One drive, supposedly in England but clearly
filmed in the hills above Los Angeles, has a sign proclaiming "English
Countryside."  Austin remarks that Southern California doesn't look
anything at all like England.</P>
<P>And if you're tired of all those ridiculously blatant product
placements, the movie parodies the most hyped company in the movies
today, Starbucks.  One of the scenes, spoofing a typical council chamber
scene from STAR WARS, is set in a huge space needle with a hundred-foot
high Starbucks sign on the outside.</P>
<P>The plot has Austin's nemesis, Dr. Evil, going back to 1969 to steal
Austin's mojo, which renders him powerless in the present.  Austin goes
back to recover his mojo.  The plot is actually more complicated than
this, and Austin makes fun of its logical flaws.</P>
<P>Myers also plays Dr. Evil, as well as a couple of other hard to spot
roles.  Dr. Evil clones himself into a miniature version of himself
called Mini-Me (Verne Troyer).  At one-eighth Dr. Evil's size and
looking and acting exactly like him, Mini-Me is treated as a cross
between a loyal dog and a favorite son.</P>
<P>In the present, Robert Wagner repeats his role as Number 2.  In the
past, Rob Lowe gives a dead-on performance as the Young Number 2.  Lowe,
in an uncanny performance, looks and acts so much like Wagner that one
could be convinced that they were father and son in real life.</P>
<P>The best part of the casting is the addition of Heather Graham (BOOGIE
NIGHTS) as CIA operative Felicity Shagwell.  As Austin's fellow spy, she
provides a playfulness and an innocence that lightens up the story,
which has a tendency to go too much over the top.  The sexual chemistry
between the two leads is delicious and genuine.  (Without giving too
much away, let's just say that Austin spends most of the picture as a
bachelor.)</P>
<P>The dialog has little gems of wit.  After a one-night fling, Dr. Evil
expresses some regret the next morning.  "I can't let my feelings for
you interfere with my taking over the world," he admonishes his
paramour.  Other lines make little sense but Myers delivers them so
confidently, they work anyway.  ("He's the snake to my mongoose," Dr.
Evil says of Austin, and then admits that it might be the other way
around.)</P>
<P>Some of the best bits in the film are visual.  Austin and Heather are
shown in silhouette inside a tent.  She appears to be doing unspeakable
things to his body.  The camera periodically cuts to the inside of the
tent so we can see that nothing unnatural is happening.  Even knowing
how the joke is performed doesn't diminish its humor or keep you from
squirming as you watch.</P>
<P>With energetic music, including such old favorites as "American Woman,"
and with intricately planned comedy, this latest AUSTIN POWERS should
delight the fans of the original as well as attract new ones.  This time
the sequel is better than its predecessor.</P>
<P>AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME runs 1:33.  It is rated PG-13 for
sexual innuendo and crude humor and would be fine for kids around 11 or
12 and up.</P>
