<PRE>Review: Simon Birch
A Review By Ryan Davis</PRE>
<P>        I saw Simon Birch in a basically sold out theater, on a Sunday
afternoon.  When the movie was over and the audience was exiting, I didn't
hear one negative comment, and I didn't have any to offer.</P>
<P>        Simon Birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old
boys, Simon (Ian Michael Smith) and Joe (Joseph Mazzello), and what destiny
holds for both of them. Simon is a dwarf, who was not supposed to last
through the night after birth due to a weak heart. Surprisingly, he does, and
now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle.  Simon thinks
God has a plan for him, a purpose for his life, and his condition, he just
doesn't know what.  Joe is an illegitimate child(referred to both comically
and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard), who's mom (Ashley Judd)
won't tell him who his father is.</P>
<P>        Simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem, the people in the town
don't really like him, because he isn't "natural". Even his own parents don't
care about him, and are disappointed they didn't have a "normal" son.  He is
also  harassed in church by the local pastor, Rev. Russell (David Strathairn)
and Simon's chain smoking  Sunday school teacher played by Jan Hooks. The only
person, other than Joe, that really cares for Simon is Joe's mom, who he also
looks up to as a mother.</P>
<P>        It would be just Simon's luck, that he would accidentally kills Joe's
mom, something you are told at the beginning of the movie.  Joe, now
motherless as well as fatherless, feels the need to find out who his real
father is. With the help of Ben (Oliver Platt), the local drama teacher and
Joe's mom's current boyfriend(before her death) , he will attempt to locate
his dad and get in a little trouble on the way. Most of this trouble is laugh
out loud funny, although not all of it is. Simon will also look for God's
plan for him, although he loses a little faith along the way.</P>
<P>        Starring in the first (and last) five minutes of the film is
Hollywood's newest dramatic actor, Jim Carrey. Jim plays the adult version of
Joe and does a impressive job starting the film off, and then tying it up just
right. This is the first character Jim has played that is not over the top in
anyway, and he does a commendable job.</P>
<P>        Simon Birch is written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, this is his
first film as director, but he has written several films, including the Grumpy
Old Men series.  He does an outstanding writing and  directing job here, the
film's structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly. The dialog goes
from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat.</P>
<P>        The cast is excellent. Joseph Mazzello gives the stand out
performance. Joseph is outstanding for someone of any age, not alone someone
who just turned 15. Ian Michael Smith, in his film debut, has such a strong
physical presence that you believe he is Simon without any hesitation. Other
great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast.</P>
<P>        I loved this movie, it is far and away one of the best films I have
seen all year. Take your whole family to see Simon Birch, it is a magnificent
film- An American Masterpiece.</P>
