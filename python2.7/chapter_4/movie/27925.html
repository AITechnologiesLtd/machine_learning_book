15 MINUTES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In 15 MINUTES, Oleg Razgul (Oleg Taktarov), a self-styled Frank Capra, 
has just landed in the USA and is ready to make a "great American movie 
with what America wants -- sex and violence."  With the camcorder that 
he stole in broad daylight from a Times Square electronics store, he has 
the wherewithal to make his magnum opus if he can just find the right 
subject material.  Given that he has arrived with fellow crook Emil 
Slovak (Karel Roden), a murderous miscreant, material will not prove a 
problem.  (Roden is such a dead ringer for TRAINSPOTTING's Robert 
Carlyle that many moviegoers may misidentify him.)</P>
<P>The action starts when Emil commits a double murder as Oleg films it.  
Most of the rest of the movie has Oleg and Emil trying to keep the only 
witness, Daphne (Vera Farmiga), from revealing their identity.  Chasing 
Oleg and Emil are two cops, Eddie (Robert De Niro) and Jordy (Edward 
Burns).  Following the typical buddy cop formula, they start off at 
odds, but end up best buds.</P>
<P>The cigar-chomping, wise-cracking, hard-drinking and (literally) 
hard-driving Eddie is a homicide detective who is so famous that he has 
had his picture on the cover of People magazine.  This high profile cop 
dates a rising network news star.  When Eddie speaks, New York City 
listens.  And when people find out he's on the double murder case, the 
large newspaper headlines reassuringly proclaim, "Eddie's On The Job."</P>
<P>In contrast to the telegenic Eddie, Jordy is an arson investigator used 
to working behind the scenes and never getting into any trouble.  Well, 
there was this one time when he handcuffed a mugger to a tree in Central 
Park and forgot about him, but other than that minor infraction, Jordy 
is a cop who has always kept his nose clean.  The catalyst that brings 
this unlikely cop pair together is the fire that Emil sets to hide the 
evidence after the murder.</P>
<P>"I love America," Emil decides after overdosing on television shows like 
"Roseanne."  "No one is responsible for what they do."  With this 
knowledge, Oleg's tape and help from a sleazy newsmagazine host, Robert 
Hawkins (Kelsey Grammer), Emil devises what he believes to be a 
foolproof scheme to gain fame, fortune and freedom.  Hawkins, whose 
motto is "If it bleeds, it leads," is always ready to sell his soul if 
the price is right.</P>
<P>Written and directed by John Herzfeld (2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY), the uneven 
movie has trouble deciding what kind of picture it wants to be.  At 
first, it goes for light comedic drama, and the parts of the bad guys 
could easily have been played by Robin Williams in his full comedic 
schtick mode.  This light heartedness gives way to an intense and 
sometimes quite violent crime drama.  The intriguing movie works in fits 
and spurts but keeps you with it even with some troubling logical 
problems.  The criminals kill some witnesses but not others, and the 
cops are slow to call for proper backup.  Still, De Niro and Burns are 
both terrific, so it is a movie whose flaws can be easily overlooked.</P>
<P>15 MINUTES runs two hours.  It is rated R for strong violence, language 
and some sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers.  </P>
