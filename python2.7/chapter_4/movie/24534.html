<P>   A picture with the same amusing spirit as Kirk Jones's
"Waking Ned Devine," Nigel Cole's "Saving Grace" is one of
those insular comedies of people living on tight little islands,
having little contact with the outside world, only to be
compelled by misfortune to enter into the rough-and-tumble of
big city politics.  Such a situation is earmarked for whimsy,
and given the talent at director Cole's call, that's what we
get.</P>
<P>   The story is photographed in the Cornish city of St. Isaacs
in an area of the world that for Europeans could be called a
lands end--nobody just passes through and doubtless few
residents even bother to make the trip to London.  The
fanciful tone is set in the very first scene just after the
dissolute husband of Grace Trevethan (Brenda Blethyn) has
jumped or fallen out of a plane without a parachute and is
buried by people who mutter curses rather than
benedictions under their breath.  We soon find out why.  The
man--who proves to have had an affair unbenownst to his
wife--was heavily in debt, having mortgaged his home and
borrowed heavily to finance a series of disastrous business
ventures.  With creditors swamping Grace for payment and
taking away her furniture right down to the motorized
lawnmower which had been secured on time payments,
Grace, who is merely an amateur albeit remarkable gardener,
is about to become homeless.  Under advice from Matthew
("The Big Tease"'s Craig Ferguson), her now underemployed
gardener, she transforms her well-lit greenhouse into fertile
soil for the growing of marijuana.  Just as the entire village of
Tallymore (pop. 52) in Kirk Jones's fable is aware of and
hiding the fact that Ned Devine, winner of a lottery, was
dead, so are the inhabitants of this Cornish coastal town hip
to the desperate measures that Grace must pursue to save
herself from bankruptcy.</P>
<P>   While the plot is amusing enough, "Saving Grace" is too
derivative to stand on its own as a comedy the likes of Robert
Asher's 1960 movie "Make Mine Mink," about a former soldier
who organizes a band of fur thieves.  This film is driven not
by plot but by its inhabitants, who are far enough removed
from the pressures of urban conformity to cultivate their
separate eccentricities in much the way that Grace and
Matthew cultivate their plants.  </P>
<P>   In the sort of story that brings broad smiles to the faces of
the audience rather than loud guffaws, "Saving Grace"
subverts the idea that money does not grow on trees, as
director Cole uses his keen eyes and ears to supply each of
his personalities with erratic individuality.  Best of all is
Brenda Blethyn, who appears in virtually every scene and
who proves that she is as able to coax grins in this picture as
she had brought tears to our eyes in Mike Leigh's poignant
"Secrets and Lies."  We watch her grow from a naive and
accepting backwater matron unable even to express her
sexual frustration to her unscrupulous husband, to a
cosmopolitan women human being.  She does this by briefly
taking up a career in what is still ludicrously considered a
crime, making a trip on her own to London, and consorting
with an urbane international drug dealer (Tcheky Karyo) who
takes quite a fancy to this dauntless individual.  </P>
<P>   While the conclusion of this deft little comedy is scarcely
believable and, in fact, is resolved with an unforeshadowed
contrivance, we revel in the gentle fun the story makes at the
expense of village people, some of whom turn out to be not
as dumb as they appear.  Keystone Cop Sgt. Alfred (Ken
Campbell) could easily remind you of "Waking Ned Devine"'s
daft Michael O'Sullivan (played by David Kelly)--a
slightly bemused officer who dreams of the fame he would
receive if only he can catch the local salmon poachers. 
Martin Clunes as Dr. Bamford is the kind of physician we
hope to find, at least when we're not gravely ill--the sort who
hardly takes himself seriously and is up for a toke or a drink
at any time.  Among other comic scenes is one involving 
women who have the time of their lives when they
unknowingly down cups of tea made from marijuana leaves.</P>
<P>   Mark Crowdy, who wrote the story and is its producer, tells
us something about the history of the movie.  Crowdy, who is
from the very Cornwall of the narrative, heard about a man
driving a Land Rover who had a sneezing attack so bad that
his head pitched forwarded and got stuck in the steering
wheel.  His car swerved from the road, crashed, and the man
died.  In the hands of "The Ice Storm"'s Ang Lee, this could
be a take-off point for a tragic tale, but Crowdy uses the
inspiration to carve a daffy yarn of a woman who turns to a
crime of the most harmless kind to save herself.  </P>
