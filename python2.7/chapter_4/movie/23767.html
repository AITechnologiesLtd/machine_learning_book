<P>Z (France-Algeria, 1969) ****  Directed by Costa-Gavras (Constatine
Gavras) Written  by Gavras & Jorge Semprun from the eponymous novel
by Vassilis Vassilikos. Photography: Raoul Coutard. Music: Mikis
Theodorakis.  Cast: Yves Montand, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Jacques
Perrin, Irene Papas, Charles Denner, Francois Perier, Marcel Bozzufi,
Georges Geret et al.  127 minutes. Available  without cuts on a
superior Criterion laser-disc</P>
<P>In 1963, Grigorios Lambrakis, MD,  a popular leftist Member of the
Greek Parliament, was assassinated in Thesssaloniki by goons employed
by the extreme Right. Eventually the right-wing establishment fell
and a precarious democracy was established, only to lead to  a coup
on 21 April 1967,  by a military junta. The colonels' dictatorship
lasted for 7 years.</P>
<P>A Greek writer, Vassilis Vassilikos, recounted the events around the
Lambrakis murder in a thick novel, Z , in 1966. The title comes from
a combination of the sound of the Greek letter Z , which  is
pronounced  approximately like  "Long Live" , and the English sound
of Z, which means in Greek, " he lives, he is alive" . Such shouts
were  uttered by the record crowd which attended Lambrakis' funeral
in Athens. (Some people think that Z symbolizes the end, but the last
letter of the Greek alphabet is Omega.)</P>
<P>When the movie came out, the Junta was already in place. The film was
made with French money. It could not, of course, be shot in Greece,
so Algeria was used as a substitute. Sharp-eyed viewers will detect
Algerian faces and places, but overall the stand-in country works
nicely.</P>
<P>The movie never mentions Greece by name, but its anonymous country is
patently and transparently Greece.  The uniforms are Greek, the
references are Greek, the names are Greek Among others, note the
scene of  Yves Montand, (The Deputy and victim-to-be)  in a police
office : he looks up and  sees  on the wall the portraits of King
Paul and Queen Frederica,  but with faces hidden by the reflection of
lights on the glass frames.</P>
<P>Z was a sensation in its time and, even today, when shown to students
who don't even know the first thing about the American Civil War and
the two Word Wars --not to mention modern Greece! -- the film works
very well as a high-pitched, easy- to -grasp, technically excellent
thriller.</P>
<P>Z is a film of Greek inspiration, made by a Greek filmmaker, but as a
=46rench production it  straddles French and Greek cinema , and is
considered a part of the French repertory.</P>
<P>Costa-Gavras is really Constantinos Gavr=E1s  (note the accent). His
father, a Greek from the USSR, has  started to emigrate from Russia
to  the USA--but his stopover in Athens became a permanent residence.
The son, Constantinos (Costas for short) was born in Athens in 1933.
The father, a small bureaucrat, was suspected of communism and
harassed, even after the war, at a time when leftists could be denied
such niceties as passports, driver licenses and entrance to the
university.  The son suffered much of that.</P>
<P>Costas went to Paris at age 20 to study literature at the Sorbonne.
Later he went to the main French film school, the IDHEC. He worked
with major directors, made a fine  murder thriller, THE SLEEPING CAR
MURDERS, which starred Yves Montand and his then-wife Simone Signoret.</P>
<P>C-G's next work was about choice and conscience set among the French
Resistance in World War II.   Fame came with Z.  In the meantime the
name had been fancifully and mysteriously changed by the French (and
the acquiescent director) to the easy, hyphenated, Costa-Gavras.</P>
<P>In Z, Gavras used a simple trick, so to speak, but a revolutionary
one. His innovation  was  to combine European political  awareness
and commitment with  the vigorous , dynamic, well-paced style of
Hollywood action movies.  The combination was unique and uniquely
effective.  There had been political films in Europe but these were
in the intellectual mold or -- in the case of the more familiar ones
-- in the shape of propaganda movies, whether Eisenstein's  classics
on the Russia Revolution (The Battleship Potemkin, 10 Days That Shook
The World, etc.) or  Leni Riefenstahl's paeans to Naziism ( The
Triumph Of The Will, Olympia) .</P>
<P>Gavras' s method  was not free from good-guys  vs. bad-guys
reductionism, but it was fresh. It  appealed  both to finicky
film-lovers and to the masses . It popularized, and awakened a new
interest in ugly problems of contemporary  political history.</P>
<P>Z 's rousing cinematography, music, kinetic editing and clear-cut
figures ,  as graspable as the white hats and the black hats in
westerns , made the film an unmistakable political statement. Later,
when the novelty was dimmed, came the usual gripes about of
commercialism and slickness. But  no one has, to my knowledge, come
up with  suggestions of how Z might have been made in a different,
more subtle way, yet retained its impact.</P>
<P>In fact, even by commercial standards, Z is to this day is a much
more skillful movie than most  others in the  political thriller
genre., partly because it is well made and partly because the film is
angry, and not the work of opportunistic movie-making as is mostly
the case in big films dealing with political or social causes.  Z
also  sets the tone for what would become  a remarkably consistent
Gavras specialty : docudramas on  contemporary history, directed
against  the abuse of state power.</P>
<P>Gavras's subsequent work in this vein was increasingly less manichean
and  more shaded , and  did some  serious probing of minds and souls.
Many of those films starred Yves Montand,  the director's fetish
actor.</P>
<P>With THE CONFESSION Gavras took on another kind of extreme right,
that of the Stalinist purges in the Czechoslovakia of the 1950s, and
he explored the nature of True Believers in communism.  STATE OF
SIEGE dealt with the CIA in Uruguay, while exploring  dramatic
problems of conscience and of  moral ambiguity. Ironically, it was
made in then-democratic Chile, just before the fall of  Allende.
SPECIAL SECTION denounced the French collaborationist  tribunals of
the Occupation during World War II.  MISSING was on the overthrow of
Allende in Chile and the U.S. role in it .  HANN  K. dealt with
justice,  Palestinian  and Israeli. Called pro-Palestinian, it had a
very short life in theatres. BETRAYED does not denounce state power
but the power of lunatic fringes within the state: it takes off from
the infamous murder of Jewish radio personality Alan Berg and exposes
neo-fascist organizations in America. The underrated THE MUSIC BOX
tells of a man (German actor Armin Mueller-Stahl in his first US
movie) who immigrated to Chicago after World War II, was a pillar of
the community and the father of brilliant lawyer Jessica Lange. In
the 1980s he is accused of war crimes.</P>
<P>In his best films, the strongly political ones, C-G does not
propagandize for a special point of view, but illustrates the
oft-quoted (and oft-misquoted) "Power tends to corrupt and absolute
power corrupts absolutely."</P>
<P>Almost all those movies were anchored in fact. All were
controversial. In film after film  Gavras pleased many people and
alienated  others: Greeks, Czechs, sundry die-hard  Stalinists,
Americans (including  the State Department, Washington agencies or
white supremacists), French lawyers and lawmakers, Latin Americans
and  more.</P>
<P>Back to Z.  An example of its impact. I saw it in London during the
period of the Greek colonels' dictatorial, far-rightist and imbecilic
regime.  The movie was playing in a small art house full of attentive
people. At the end they cheered,  while looking as though they had
undergone a mystical experience. Outside the theatre, a collection
was being taken up for an  anti-junta cause. The  departing
spectators, British, Greek, Cypriots, East and West Indians and
others, did not merely give change but also pound notes, with a
generosity that few had ever witnessed before.</P>
