<P>Starring: Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Beverly D'Angelo, Fairuza Balk.
Rated R for graphic violence and language, strong sexuality and nudity.</P>
<P>"American History X" is one of the most powerful, most involving movies I have
seen in a while. The whole movie is simply amazing, shooting off the center
minor times but quickly picking up where it left off. I think Edward Norton's
performance in this movie is one of the best performances in a movie to me on
record. He gets into his character so deep, he believes what the character is
doing. After a while we start to believe him, it's absolutely incredible. The
supporting cast more than supports Edward, they almost do just as great of job
as he does. The rest of the cast includes Edward Furlong, Beverly D'Angelo and
Fairuza Balk.</P>
<P>The movie starts out with some guys trying to break into Derek's (Edward
Nortan) car. His younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) walks in during him and
his girlfriend having sex to tell him someone is robbing his car. Derek gets up
quickly, grabs his gun and shoots the three guys outside. The police come and
Derek is put in jail for three years. Derek is also a neo-natzi skinhead.
Before all this happened he had a group of other skinheads, meetings and
robberies. </P>
<P>Danny having seen what happened, wants to follow in his brother's footsteps and
he too becomes a skinhead. His grades in school start to drop, he hangs out
with the wrong crowd and does other misc. stuff. Three years later Derek gets
out of prison. A changed man no longer a skinhead, but a person who respects
other people. Danny learns that when Derek was in prison, he was partnered with
a black man to do jobs and found out, there is no reason to hate these people.</P>
<P>Now years before Danny and Derek's father was killed by a drug dealer while
fighting a fire. Since then Derek has been a skinhead. His mother played
superbly by Beverly D'Angelo can not understand where she went wrong. Her other
three kids are not like that. Derek a changed man, no longer a nazi has to
fight his past when he returns, and fight the people from his past to change
his brother into a regular person.</P>
<P>'American History X' is definately one of 1998's best films. It has superb
acting to go along with it's excellent storyling. It's extremely believeable in
all senses, very very powerful and emotionally involving. We actually live the
lives the characters live. We are there right beside them the whole time
through the rough times and the good times. When the ending comes we are
shattered but left with a good message. </P>
<P>Now the whole movie is nothing but a message. It deals with race and how we
shouldn't base someone precisely on the color of their skin, but what they are
inside. Edward Furlong gives a performance that is not only great, but his
character is really the star of the film. It's the story through his eyes, what
he sees, and what he doesn't see. If you want to see a movie that will disturb
you while making you cry, see 'American History X' it's one of the best films
made.</P>
