<PRE>                                  TRIAL AND ERROR
                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Even if you don't like Jeff Daniels, you've got to give him credit 
for being a good sport.  During his career, he has played second fiddle 
to the likes of huge spiders (ARACHNAPHOBIA), screaming matches between 
Shirley McLaine and Debra Winger (TERMS OF ENDEARMENT), Jim Carrey's 
rubber features (DUMB AND DUMBER), Keanu Reeves and a speeding bus 
(SPEED), and now Michael Richards' antics.  If there was a Hollywood 
award for the quintessential team player, Daniels would be in 
contention.   </P>
<P>     TRIAL AND ERROR casts the actor as hot shot lawyer Charlie Tuttle, 
who has been on the fast track ever since graduating from Yale Law 
School.  He has just been made a partner in a lucrative L.A. law firm, 
he has a 37th story office with a view, and he's engaged to the boss' 
beautiful-but-heartless daughter.  So, when his future father-in-law 
tells him to fly to the tiny town of Paradise Bluff, Nevada to request a 
continuance for a friend of the family, how can he refuse?  
Unfortunately, the unexpected trip conflicts with his bachelor's party.  
That's no problem for the ever-resourceful best man, actor Richard 
Rietti (Michael Richards), who has been Charlie's best friend since he 
was nine years old.  If Charlie can't come to the party, why not bring 
the party to Charlie? </P>
<P>     So, Richard drives out to Paradise Bluff and shows his friend a 
great time -- too great a time, as it turns out, because Charlie ends up 
getting punched out by a couple of burly guys at a bar, then overdoses 
on pain killers.  As a result, he's in no shape to appear in court the 
next day as the representative of Benny Gibbs (Rip Torn), who's being 
charged with fraud (at $17.99 a pop, Benny's "copper engravings of the 
Great Emancipator" turned out to be nothing more than pennies).  But the 
ever-helpful Richard has a brainstorm -- he'll impersonate Charlie, 
request the continuance, then both of them can get out of town.  There's 
just one snag -- while the judge (Austin Pendleton) doesn't have a 
problem with Richard's motion, the prosecutor, Elizabeth Gardner 
(Jessica Steen), does, and the case ends up going to trial with an actor 
posing as the defendant's lawyer. </P>
<P>     If TRIAL AND ERROR resembles MY COUSIN VINNY in a broad sense (big 
city lawyer caught in a small town trial), it's no accident.  Director 
Jonathan Lynn, who presided over VINNY, allows this film to develop in a 
similar, lighthearted manner.  The script, credited to Gregory 
Bernstein, Sara Bernstein, and Cliff Gardner, isn't a comic masterpiece, 
but Lynn gets the most out of it.  There are several dull patches and 
more than a few jokes don't work, but these are counterbalanced by some 
hilarious sequences and a surprisingly winning romance. </P>
<P>     TRIAL AND ERROR is designed as a showcase for the talents of 
Richards, who is best known for his role as the off-the-wall Kramer on 
TV's SEINFELD.  And, while Richards tones down his buffoonery here, 
there's still plenty of physical comedy involved.  However, as enjoyable 
as some of the actor's outrageous stunts are, he is upstaged by the 
deftly-handled relationship between Charlie and a local barmaid named 
Billie (played by Charlize Theron, the spandex-clad blond from TWO DAYS 
IN THE VALLEY).  Both Daniels and Theron are likable, and they really 
click together.  Daniels' portrayal of Charlie is just another variation 
of his usual screen personae; Theron plays Billie with an adorable 
combination of sexiness and sweetness.  The result is that this subplot 
becomes more interesting than the main story, and it's easy to grow 
impatient during some of the longer, drawn-out court sequences (not to 
mention an ill-conceived romantic interlude involving Richard and the 
prosecutor). </P>
<P>     TRIAL AND ERROR is reasonably effective for what it intends to be -
- a genial comedy offering a change of pace from the mayhem of THE FIFTH 
ELEMENT, THE LOST WORLD, and CON AIR.  The structure is a little 
awkward, but its not hard to overlook this and other problems if you're 
in the market for several hearty laughs, a few smiles, and an 
unambitious-but-agreeable time at the movies. </P>
