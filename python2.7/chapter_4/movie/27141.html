<P>Can Mel Gibson ever do any wrong? Even when he stars in a goofy picture such
as this, he still manages to come out smelling like a rose. Unfortunately, a
solid performance by Mel, charming as usual, and the great shots of him
without his shirt, you can bounce quarters of that six-pack of his, still
don't save this film from saying very little about anything. It's a very,
very "surface" kind of movie...with lots of songs packed into its
best-selling soundtrack-to-be. Great performance by Mel, enjoyable overused
tunes and a few funny moments and you've got yourself a perfect example of a
"video date movie".</P>
<P>PLOT:
A macho, rich, jerk suddenly gets the power to read women's minds and
decides to use it to help him make his life better. He wants to better his
job, better the relationship he has with his daughter and better the way
that he treats the women in his life. Will it work? Will it fall apart? Will
we be suffocated by the many cute "Mel" moments before being treated to an
actual story? Find out below.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
See Mel Gibson dance around by himself to Sinatra tunes. Hear Mel do his
best Sean Connery impression. See Mel walking around shirtless half the
movie. Hear Mel sweet talk women and become a sensitive guy overnight. See
Mel relate to his daughter over a loud montage featuring Christina
Aguilera's "What A Girl Wants", as she tries on different prom dresses.
Sigh. See women swoon as all of this takes place on the big screen. Hear men
moan as they sit there next to their ladies. This one ain't for us, fellas.
In fact, I wouldn't even recommend this to any women either, unless they
were just looking for a fluffy ol' time. This movie has a great premise, and
I mean a GREAT one! Here's a man who by some crazy fluke of an accident, can
actually hear what women think. Wow. Isn't that a great way to start a
movie? Yup, sure is. Unfortunately, the makers of this movie decided to
concentrate more on the number of musical interludes that they would have in
the film, rather than any actual story! Let's add another Sinatra number
here, and another cool song from the soundtrack there, and wouldn't it be
cool if we added a montage with another song playing as Mel moves from place
to place here? Uuuuuhmm, I guess someone forget to tell the filmmakers that
they were actually producing a movie...not a soundtrack!</P>
<P>Ugh, one of the most blatantly commercial movies to come down the pike in a
long time. And by commercial, I mean a film so OBVIOUSLY created for a
certain target audience. We've got the sad sack emotionally vulnerable
character drifting in and out of the movie, for the sake of depth.
Disposable secondary characters based on their obvious proclivity to the
target audience (females 30-45). Remember who women chose as the most
sensitive guy back in the old days? Alan Alda, that's right, he's in this
movie! And what's any "chick flick" without Bette Midler. Oy vey, is right!
I don't know, maybe I've seen too many of these types of movies in my day
and the whole schtick is getting to be a little too see-through for me, but
even without the obvious manipulative stuff going on behind the scenes, the
story here is really quite underdeveloped. Mel gets this great power and
does barely anything with it. He makes a few cute remarks to the ladies
around his office, he uses it for obvious relationship reasons, he uses it
to suck up to his daughter's friends...very flighty stuff.</P>
<P>And despite several cute and funny moments, especially the whole scene in
bed with Marisa Tomei (tough shoot, hey Marisa?), the film just never really
does much with its initial great concept. In fact, the wrap-up of Mel's
newfound "power" is handled in an extremely clumsy way. Things just never
seem to go under any type of surface in this movie, but if that's the kind
of film that you're looking, then you might just enjoy this fluff piece. And
no offense to Helen Hunt, whom I consider to be a solid actress, but am I
the only one that's a bit Helen-ed out? That's four movies with her in the
past six weeks! Phew. At least she had a "tan" in this one, despite the lack
of color in her character's persona. This film is a study into the art of
Nora Ephron romance movies gone awry!</P>
