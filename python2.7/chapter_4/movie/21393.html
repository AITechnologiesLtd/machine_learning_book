<PRE>"Princess Mononoke" Review
by Fontaine Lien
WARNING: CONTAINS PLOT INFORMATION</PRE>
<P>I swear to you the fact that I saw this movie at its premiere and the
fact that I met my favorite actress, Gillian Anderson, at this
premiere really has nothing to do with me liking this movie.</P>
<P>My encounter with Gillian is a story for another place, but here I'm
going to tell you about "Princess Mononoke."  Actually, I don't even
remember a character in the story called Mononoke.  I guess I was too
distracted.</P>
<P>The gist is, I was a bit disappointed, because I am a big fan of This
Guy (I don't know his English name . . . he's the main artist and
creator of several popular anime flicks such as this one); but this
project did not exceed the quality of his previous works like "Totoro"
or "Grave of the Fireflies" (most of his films are wonderful, but for
your sake I suggest you visit IMDB instead of relying on my memory :)
It lacked delicacy and bittersweet qualities.  But, I think it is
proof of this film's merit that despite the fact that Gillian was
sitting only a few rows behind me, I was still held captivated by the
images and sound.</P>
<P>The sound.  The music was wonderful, alternating between the majestic,
the innocent, the humorous, and the tragic.  My favorite voiceover was
that of Claire Dane's.  True, everyone did a great job and you could
sense a lot of emotion (I don't know which one was Billy Crudup--I
assume it was the main character--or Jada Pinkett *Smith*) from each
character, but I'm sorry, was it necessary to give the monk a
hillbillie accent (courtesy of Billy Bob) or the Iron Fortress lady an
Irish accent (from Minnie Driver, of course)?  Gillian went all out,
but I just couldn't get used to the fact that it was Gillian's voice
behind that ferocious white wolf.  Yes, the fault is all mine.</P>
<P>The images were simply breathtaking, and I wouldn't expect any less
from this artist.  They need a little softening, but I'd take this
over a Disney toon any day (don't get me wrong, I loved "Mulan" :).
The plot was perhaps overly complex and resolved too quickly and
sloppily at the end.  The dialogue was poor, and they were hitting us
over the head with the "humans vs. nature" theme a bit too heavily (a
recurring theme throughout all the artist's previous films).  The
action was exaggerated, even for a cartoon.  But when I walked out of
the theater, I realized that I didn't care.  It didn't matter anymore
that I was disappointed; because in a way, I was satisfied.  It didn't
matter that I sat in the second row and my neck hurts like hell,
because I got the feeling I always get after watching one of this
guy's films (that by the way, I don't often feel after a Disney toon):
that there is beauty even in the tragic; that there is something
spiritual and unexplainable in the human soul and within the depths of
nature.</P>
<P>Rating: B+ (First viewing, 10/20/99)</P>
<P>*Watch for those tiny tree goblins.  They are *so* adorable.  They
look like tiny white aliens</P>
