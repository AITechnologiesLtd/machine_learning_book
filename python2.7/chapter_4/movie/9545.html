<PRE>EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX (BUT WERE AFRAID TO ASK)
(1972)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Woody Allen
Writer: Woody Allen (from the book by David Reuben)
Starring: Woody Allen, Louise Lasser, Lynn Redgrave, Gene Wilder, Tony
Randall, Burt Reynolds, John Carridine, Regis Philbin, Lou Jacobi</P>
<P>Many people know about the popular book, "Everything You Always Wanted
to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask)," which was a
straight-forward sex book (obviously), and this is the basis for the
film.  However, this is not some striaght-forward outline of the book
(just picture Woody demonstrating sodomy on some chick like Louise
Lasser or Diane Keaton - sorry for the imagery).  Instead, this is a
collection of short films, very, very, very loosely based on some of the
chapters from the book, each taking a concept from a specific chapter,
and going totally crazy with it.</P>
<P>I will rate each of the little films individually and make some kind of
average for the whole film.  So here we go:</P>
<P>1. "Do Aphrodisiacs Work?" - In this hysterically comical film that gets
funnier by the second, Woody plays a really bad court jester who becomes
obsessed with his queen (Lynn Redgrave), and gets an aphrodisiac so he
can get to know her a little better (nudge nudge).  Things get
complicated, some things don't go as planned (although some do), and we
get a hilarious finale.  Woody's one-liners are perfect here (especially
in the intentionally bad joke-laden beginning, and the spoof of "Hamlet"
- "T.B. or not T.B, that is the conjestion..."), and he's at his
funniest acting, which is not a shock.  The little film moves quickly,
and is paced near perfectly.  So...</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
<P>2. "What is Sodomy?" - This could have been a one-joke premise, but
thanks to the writing, it only gets funnier.  But it's just not as good
as the first one.  This one stars Gene Wilder (doing some of his manic
funniest as the film goes on) as a family doctor who falls in love with
a sheep.  Hence, sodomy (use your randy imagination).  The film includes
such little jokes as asking for grass at a hotel ("No, real grass"), the
sheep wearing garters, and the brilliantly done ending where Gene weeps
for his long-lost love by drinking Woolite.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
<P>3. "Why Do Some Women Have Trouble Reaching Orgasm?" - Done all in
Italian with sub-titles, this one is about a swinger (Woody) who marries
a beautiful woman (Louise Lasser, from "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" and
his "Bananas"), but finds that she can never achieve an orgasm with
him...until he finds out she has a fetish for public sex.  It's
deifinitely not the funniest film, and doesn't end the perfect way, but
sure knows how to be clever, and, well, it's hilarious.  And the Italian
works.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
<P>4. "Are Transvestites Homosexuals?" - Not involving Woody again, this
one centers around a middle-aged couple who go over to their future
in-laws for supper, but the husband of the visiting family (Lou Jacobi)
goes upstairs to the foreign bedroom to indulge in his big fetish:
transvestitism.  But while parading around in women's clothes, he's
almost caught, and has to flee the house, cover up his moustache, talk
in high falsetto, and try to figure out how to get back inside without
being noticed.  It's one of the funniest things I've ever seen, and only
gets funnier as it moves on with good pacing.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
<P>5. "What are Sex Perverts?" - Funny skit is probably the only
disappointing one here, even though it's funny.  The film, shot on
purposely bad film, shows an episode of a very liberal game show (in
black and white, no less) called "What's Your Perversion?," feautring
guests who come on and are asked questons by a panel (including Regis
Philbin - not even kidding) who try to come up with the guest's fetish.
It never really goes anywhere, but is still hilarious.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): **1/2</PRE>
<P>6. "Are the Findings of Doctors and Clinics Who Do Sexual Research and
Experiments Accurate?" (almost longer than the title) - Uneven but
undeniably hysterical little vignette about a sex scholar (guess who?
okay, it's Woody) who goes to the mansion of a famous sexual doctor
(John Carridine) with a journalist to interview him on his various and
contreversial sexual explorations.  Turns out the guy's a mad scientist
who's doing such bizarre things as pumping a woman full of silicone, and
doing the old cliche of switching brains.  Also, he has an Igorian
servent who's hunchbacked only because the doctor gave him a prolonged
orgasm (through an experiment).  But this film switches identity, and
when the doctor's house is burned down by the scholar and the journalist
(long story), what emerges and wreaks havoc on the countryside
is...(eerie music) a gigantic breast.  How they catch it is classic.  So
is the sketch.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
<P>7. "What Happens During Ejaculation?" - The hands-down most brilliant
and funniest sketch, ending it on a great note, this little film deals
with the inner-workings of the brain during sex.  Inside all the
specific body parts are little people, working their asses off to help
create sex.  In the brain is "Mission Control," with Tony Randal as the
cheif and Burt Reynolds as a switchboard man (with the classic Reynolds
line "Proceed with erection; all systems go."), and as a sperm is (big
shock) Woody, as the most insecure of them all ("What if he's
masturbating?  I'll end up on the wall!")  It only gets funnier and
funnier and funniet, and is paced beautifully, with little problems
jumping in at just the right time (a saboteur of the mission turns out
to be a little inner priest).  With great acting, great writing, and,
well, some cool sets and special effects (for a 70s comedy), we get a
perfect way to end the movie, and one of Woody's funniest pieces of
work.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
<P>So, "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to
Ask)" is a hilarious movie, made just for the twisted neurotic fans of
Mr. Allen AND people who love great sketch comedy that isn't afraid to
insult and outrage.  Yes, it has its peaks and valleys, but overall,
it's a fantastic piece of comedy, and a great film to watch.</P>
<PRE>AVERAGE RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
