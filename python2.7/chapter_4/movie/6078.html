<PRE>                               ED'S NEXT MOVE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     ED'S NEXT MOVE is a charming little low budget picture where the
actors seem less like actors than people on whom you are getting to
eavesdrop.  In the press kit, writer and director John Walsh says that
after failing to secure funding, he "decided to make the film the old
fashioned way: on credit cards."  I glad he did for this delightful
film had me in constant chuckles.  My only big laugh came in the
perfect conclusion, but every comedy does not to be a laugh riot like
TOOTSIE to be worth seeing.</P>
<P>     ED'S NEXT MOVE tells of the travails of Eddie Brodsky (Matt Ross
from TWELVE MONKEYS) as he moves from placid Wisconsin to the hectic
pace and strange rhythms of New York City.  Eddie earns his living
studying the genetics of rice plants and he comes to NYC to study under
an expert in the field, but having little money, he goes on a hunt for
an apartment to share.</P>
<P>     Actually, his life and this film is spent in search of a woman
with whom he can have a relationship.  Ross is terrific as the classic
awkward and shy guy, and his awkwardness mirrors the awkwardness of the
script, funny thought it is.  Although Eddie is twenty-five, his boyish
looks make him look much younger.  He had a girlfriend in Wisconsin,
but she dumped him and even compiled a list of her complains about him.</P>
<P>     Ray Obregon (Kevin Carroll) agrees to rent Eddie part of his
apartment, but when they meet, Ray starts bragging of his sexual
prowess.  Ray tells how he recently got into an elevator and four of
his ex-girlfriends were in it.  Depressed Eddie says, "Four women in
the same elevator.  I haven't been with four women in the same time
zone."</P>
<P>     There are several little imaginary vignettes in the film.  In one,
Eddie and his old girlfriend get together with translators who tell
each other what the other is really saying.  When his ex says she
doesn't like Eddie anymore, her translator says what she mean is,
"there's a guy at work who makes the zipper on my jeans melt."</P>
<P>     Another vignette involves the distribution of "Official Nice Guy"
ID cards.  Guys can use these when meeting a woman to show that they
been certified not to be a weirdo or a loser.  It is a great take-off
on the late night cable TV commercials.  All of the humor in the show
walks the fine line between dialog that you laugh at versus laugh with.
For me the script is precious and it works, but the two other reviews I
have seen of the show range from a near perfect rating to a near bomb.
Actually, I can understand both perspectives, but as Eddie says, "in
some things, the more I analyze them the less clear they become."
Don't analyze this film, just kick back and laugh with it.</P>
<P>     Predictably, Eddie does finally get a woman, Lee Nicol (Callie
Thorne), to go out on a date with him.  Her main problem with him is
that "You're so, so normal."  Before she arrives, Eddie gets in an
argument with Ray about his attitude about sex.  Eddie corrects him,
"Sex is not a transitive act.  It is an intransitive act."  Disgusted,
Ray informs him that, "If you talk like that to her, it will be a
non-existent act."  All three of the principle actors show promise, but
Ross is the best.  His false starts in kissing are classics, but the
funny setups provided by the script should get some of the credit.</P>
<P>     The picture is helped by an excellent score which is quite unusual
in a low budget film.  At first the music is dominated by jazz pieces
composed for the film and played by Benny Golson.  Toward the end of
the picture, it switches to funny folk songs sung by the San Francisco
alternative band Ed's Redeeming Qualities.  One of their best songs
ends with the line, "I wish there were more bad times to see you
through."</P>
<P>     ED'S NEXT MOVE runs only 1:28.  It is rated R for a few cuss
words, one very brief sex scene, and a two swing fist fight.  There is
no nudity.  I think this sweet and upbeat little picture would be fine
for all teenagers and probably some slightly younger kids as well.  I
had fun with the show and recommend it to all except those of you who
need a highly polished product.  The show gets ** 1/2 from me.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
