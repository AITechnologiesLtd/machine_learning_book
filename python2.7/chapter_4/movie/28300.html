<P>Susan Granger's review of "THE LUZHIN DEFENSE" (Sony Pictures Classics)</P>
<P>  It's all about chess and madness, set in 1929 in the Lake
Como region of Northern Italy, where the World Chess Championship is
underway. The now-grown Russian prodigy Alexander Luzhin (John
Turturro) is the favorite, and his mind is totally focused on winning
- until he encounters a lovely Russian Emigre, Natalia Katkov (Emily
Watson), whose mother is determined to marry her off to the French
nobleman Jean de Stassard (Christopher Thompson), a chess enthusiast
who's come to watch the tournament. Socially inexperienced and inept,
Luzhin proposes marriage and, surprisingly, she accepts. But there's
opposition in the form of Luzhin's former manager, Valentinov (Stuart
Wilson), who is determined to see him lose. The suspense intensifies
as the contest comes down to Luzhin and Turati (Fabio Sartor), the
Italian Grand Master. Under intense mental pressure and becoming
increasingly unstable, the obsessed Luzhin devises a brilliant set of
moves, which come to be known as the Luzhin Defense. Checkmate!</P>
<P>    From the nicotine stains on his fingertips to his
disheveled clothes and clipped, mono-syllabic speech, John Turturro is
a superb actor but he goes overboard in demented eccentricity,
muttering to himself and spinning circles in the rain, while Emily
Watson exudes the required propriety and nurturing instincts. Based on
"The Defense" by Vladimir Nabokov, adapted by Peter Berry and directed
with a heavy-hand by Marleen Gorris ("Antonia's Line,"
"Mrs. Dalloway"), it's as slow and ponderous as the game it depicts,
soon the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Luzhin Defense" is a
sedate, simplistic, even dispiriting 5.  If you're intrigued by chess,
I recommend renting "Searching for Bobby Fischer" (1993), a far
superior film.</P>
