<P>     Frankly, the *last* thing that I wanted to see on a Saturday night
was yet another John Grisham flick, about yet another young law dude
(Matt Damon) tackling his first big case.  (This is, what, the *third*
such story in a row, after THE CHAMBER and A TIME TO KILL?)  Imagine my
surprise to find adaptation #6 possessing a strong, often broadly played
comedic streak.  Sure, the outcome is predictable, duh, but the road to
get there is refreshingly lighter-hearted.  Francis Ford Coppola, who
wrote and directed, serves up ample humor at every turn, from those de-
liriously tacky Memphis locales to the occasional bit of outright slap-
stick.  (The scene-stealer, here, is DeVito.  In a smaller role, Mickey
Rourke is oily fun.  And don't miss Dean Stockwell's delightful hacking-
cough cameo.)  The courtroom scenes have the requisite surprises, but
not nearly enough dramatic punch.  The tone is breezy, almost whimsical;
the pacing is methodical, though we could use a bit more urgency toward
the end.  Trickier is the subplot involving Claire Danes as an abused
young wife (and potential love interest), but the filmmakers pull it
off.  (That is, except for Elmer Bernstein's score, that too often in-
trudes upon the couple's quiet time.)  And, as the main character real-
izes by the end of the movie, there's no small irony in a story about an
ambulance-chasing, money-grubbing law firm going after a claims-denying,
money-grubbing insurance agency.</P>
