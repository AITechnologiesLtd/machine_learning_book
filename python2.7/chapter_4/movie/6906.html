<P>     DANTE'S PEAK is obviously predicated on the dubious idea that 
bigger is better.  1996's TWISTER brought in hundreds of millions at the 
box office by showcasing relatively small (if something so destructive 
can be gauged as "small") natural disasters -- namely, tornadoes.  The 
next logical step would be to go for something larger and more 
devastating.  Apparently, hurricanes weren't deemed visually impressive 
enough and earthquakes have been done to death, so Hollywood has set its 
sights on volcanoes with not one, but two, similarly-themed disaster 
flicks.  Let's just hope VOLCANO shows a glimmer more intelligence, not 
to mention a higher energy level, than DANTE'S PEAK.</P>
<P>     No one is ever going to accuse TWISTER of being a masterpiece of 
originality, but, as roller-coaster movie go, it's a great deal of fun.  
Part of the reason is the effective use of audio and visual effects; the 
other part is that director Jan de Bont knows how to get the adrenaline 
flowing.  TWISTER is a rush.  DANTE'S PEAK, on the other hand, is a 
bore.  Oh, it has its moments, but most of them are concentrated in the 
final forty-five minutes.  The first hour, which is all typical disaster 
movie setup, is interminable.  </P>
<P>     In keeping with time-tested formulas, we have a male/female 
pairing, children and animals in danger, a voice of reason that no one 
listens to until its too late, and a character with a tragedy in the 
past.  Volcanologist Harry Dalton (Pierce "Bond, James Bond" Brosnan) 
lost his beloved girlfriend four years ago when they were studying an 
erupting volcano in South America.  As a result of this incident, he 
tends to be jumpy about any possible volcanic activity, and when there 
are signs that the snowcapped mountain overlooking the tiny Washington 
state town of Dante's Peak (population 7400) may be about to blow its 
top, Harry calls for an evacuation.  The local mayor, Rachel Wando 
(Linda Hamilton), backs him up, but the others on the town council 
aren't so sure.  Enter Harry's boss, Paul Dreyfus (Charles Hallahan), 
and his group of roving geologists (who look like refugees from 
TWISTER's ragged band of storm hunters).  Paul, sensitive to the 
delicate political situation of spreading panic without proper 
scientific evidence, calls off the evacuation.  So, of course, when 
disaster inevitably strikes, people are needlessly killed.  </P>
<P>     The first hour of DANTE'S PEAK is spent getting to know the 
characters.  Not that we need that much time, since they're all familiar 
types.  In addition to Harry and Rachel (who predictably become 
romantically involved), we're introduced to two kids, an independent old 
lady, and a dog.  If you manage to stay awake through fifty-five minutes 
of drivel, you'll be rewarded with some nifty special effects as the 
mountain throws everything it has at the town:  fire, water, air, and 
earth.  No stone (literally) is left unturned.  It's pretty impressive, 
I admit, but there's an unwelcome sense of deja vu.  As recently as the 
aforementioned TWISTER, we've already been there and done that, and it 
was a lot more enjoyable last time around.</P>
<P>     Brosnan and Hamilton gamely try to generate some chemistry, and, 
while both are appealing in their own right, the moronic plotline and 
dumb dialogue defeat them at nearly every turn.  It will come as no 
surprise for astute viewers to learn that the screenwriter for DANTE'S 
PEAK, Leslie Bohem, also wrote Stallone's DAYLIGHT.  Both movies feature 
some similarly embarrassing bad lines.  Meanwhile, director Roger 
Donaldson (NO WAY OUT, THE GETAWAY) fails repeatedly to do anything 
interesting to enliven the proceedings.</P>
<P>     Even discounting the first hour, DANTE'S PEAK still isn't all that 
satisfying.  I suppose there's a certain degree of tension as Harry and 
company flee rivers of molten lava and volcanic shockwaves in their 
attempt to get out of town before it's buried in ash, but, with 
everything being done according to a well-established formula, the level 
of excitement stays low.  Once the film is over, you'll likely 
acknowledge that, although there's some nice eye candy, the experience 
as a whole leaves something to be desired.  </P>
<P>     And there aren't even any flying cows to redeem the situation.</P>
