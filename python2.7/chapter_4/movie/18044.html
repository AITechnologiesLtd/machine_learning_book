<PRE>Entrapment (20th Century Fox)
Rated R
Written by Ronald Bass and William Broyles, Jr.
Directed by Jon Amiel</PRE>
<PRE>Review by Victory A. Marasigan</PRE>
<P>There must be a stipulation in Catherine Zeta-Jones' contract which
says that her face must be lit so that her eyes twinkle in every shot
in which she appears.  In Entrapment, the flashy follow-up to her
breakthrough role in The Mask of Zorro, there is nary a scene in which
she doesn't look like a team of makeup people just powdered her nose.</P>
<P>Zeta-Jones is Gin Baker, an eager insurance investigator who sets out
on an impossible mission of sorts to catch master art thief Robert
MacDougal (Sean Connery, in a variation of his escaped con role in The
Rock) in the act.  After tracking him down in London, Baker offers the
aging entrepreneur a sweet deal: he'll aid her in the theft of a
jeweled gold mask at an art exhibit and get a share of the profits
from its sale.  Of course, the sexual tension in their strange
partnership starts building immediately, giving rise to plenty of
boring romantic scenes during which the audience can go to the
concession stand and get refills on their popcorn.</P>
<P>Is Baker setting MacDougal up for a fall, or is she just as cunning
thief as he is?  An even more pressing question: Will director stop
teasing us with his cheesily non-revealing shots Zeta-Jones in the
altogether?  Will we see the liver-spotted skin (ugh) of Mr. Connery
mixing it up with own Ms. Zeta-Jones' own Ivory-soap bod?  Do we dare
keep our eyes open to find out?</P>
<P>Admittedly, when hokey romance isn't getting in the way, the film is
fun to watch.  With its expertly executed heists and sometimes
heart-poundingly tense quandaries, Entrapment actually manages to
reach an adequate level of excitement.  In one memorable scene, Gin
performs a ballet-like navigation of a room criss-crossed by invisible
lasers, moving with the same caution Tom Cruise evoked when he did his
Peter Pan impression in Mission: Impossible (It's probably no
coincidence that M:I's Ving Rhames appears in a supporting role as a
comrade of MacDougal).  But even with all the film's meticulous
dissections of the art of thievery, certain ponderous aspects of their
skill seem to be taken for granted. For example, do all master thieves
have the ability to zip in and out of the tightest places without
being seen, the limits of their own agility and the laws of physics
notwithstanding?  How do the hell do they do this?</P>
<P>Interestingly, the objects of the thieves' passion -- the artworks
themselves -- are given very little scrutiny.  The script never allows
the characters to explain what their fascination is with the pieces
they steal.  Instead, a little more than halfway through the film,
MacDougal and Baker become greedy bank robbers who'd rather go for the
big score than collect priceless masterpieces.</P>
<P>When all's said and done, and the credits roll over the film's
aw-shucks ending, you're left with the echoes of a few cheap thrills,
and also with the idea that there wasn't really that much to be
excited about.  The thieves' nifty gadgets (not to mention their
acrobatic stunt doubles) are the real stars here.  And they hold their
own quite well, considering that Zeta-Jones' face tries its very best
to hog screen time.</P>
