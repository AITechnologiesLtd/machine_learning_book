<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>The Luzhin Defence was a dull, middle-brow film about an eccentric Russian-born
Grand Master chess champion approaching his biggest match ever and making things
more complicated by falling in love for the first time. It is a pretentious arty
film set in 1929, which failed to be credible or involving. The story was
emotionally flat and the contrived ending was ludicrous (this was not the same
ending in the novel). It is hard to find what Dutch feminist filmmaker Marleen
Gorris' (A Question of Silence/Antonia's Line/Mrs. Dalloway) tried to say in
this Merchant-Ivory styled literary film. It was a drawn out glossy affair
stuffed with empty gestures to the arts, and I could never figure out what John
Turturro was trying to do with his role as the chess genius, who is both a
social misfit and someone who is mentally unstable, except to ham it up by
acting over-the-edge. He plays Alexander Luzhin, the child prodigy, who comes to
a lush Northern Italian villa in Lake Como to compete for the World Chess
Championship against arch rival Turati (Sartor). There just never seemed to be
any point or excitement to this film, as adapted by screenwriter Peter Berry
from Vladimir Nabokov's ironic novel. This film is devoid of Nabkov's wit and
irony, it reminded me only of a film that was concerned with showing a pretty
face, some pretty scenery to look at, and eschewing any controversy. The film
was devoid of any Fascist's presence, even though Mussolini had come to power in
the early part of the 1920s, so even the period film's background history is
distorted. </P>
<P>Luzhin has been addicted to chess since 10, and it is the only thing he likes
and can do well. He has immersed himself totally in chess, supposedly at risk to
his health. In continual flashbacks we see what his despondent childhood was
like, as he is raised in a socially upstart bourgeois household in Russia by
overbearing parents who sent him to the best boarding school possible and
expected him to climb the social ladder to success. It is disappointing to them
that after going through a lot of trouble to get him accepted there, that he's
asked to leave because of poor schoolwork. When his father (Tandy) realizes he's
good at chess he gets him out of his hair by turning him over to a slimy chess
teacher, Valentinov (Wilson), who exploits him for as much winnings as he can
and when Luzhin loses an important match he thinks the kid is not of a champion
caliber, so he dumps him unceremoniously in a city that's strange to Luzhin.
Luzhin is childlike and can't function in society, but to the chagrin of the
villainous Valentinov he is now competing for the world chess title. It has been
10 years since the two were together and when Luzhin sees him at the match,
there's no feeling of love or anger. Luzhin is obviously a person not possessing
all his marbles, therefore whatever happens to him seems misplaced in
importance. These flashbacks were an attempt at making crass amateur
psychological explanations for Luzhin's emotional unstability due to his
wretched upbringing. </P>
<P>Valentinov is such a vindicative person that he comes to the chess tournament
only to curry favor with Turati to make sure Luzhin loses the match, as he hates
Luzhin so much that he wants him to lose so badly that he will do anything to
sabotage him. He tells Turati all Luzhin's weaknesses while he pressures,
distracts, and even has his chauffeur take Luzhin for a ride to leave him
stranded in the countryside, so he can miss a match. These scenes are
conventional and added little meaning to Luzhin's personal dilemma. </P>
<P>Vacationing in the fancy resort is the regal Russian émigré Natalia (Emily
Watson), a quiet beauty who falls for the seedy looking and socially awkward
chess genius. She tells her snobbish and Jew-hating mother (Geraldine James),
who states the Jews invented radio to control the media, that she has just met
the most "fascinating, enigmatic, and attractive man" - much to the displeasure
of her mother. Her reaction is to break up this unlikely and embarrassing
romance as quickly as she could, as she wires her husband in Berlin to come down
here and help her in this endeavor. Mother is shocked that she chooses someone
as socially unacceptable as this one, over the more socially desirous fellow she
had in mind for a suitor. </P>
<P>The maternal romance that develops between the overly dependent Luzhin and the
wealthy debutante who likes a simple man, seemed stuck in a vacuous
sentimentality. Everything about Luzhin seems heavy-handed and done only for
effect and not to develop his character. The comedy and romance attempted had
the feel of a Charlie Chaplin venture done with Charlie being played by someone
who couldn't stop doing pratfalls. His nervous breakdown and eventual suicide
before the big game, seemed not to come about from his own inward treachery but
from the treachery of others. Whatever happens to him seemed overwrought and
artificial. His over-acting and the way the film tried to make this unfeeling
love affair into a real one, had a disingenous feel to it. This film felt heavy
at all times, like it was load of manure being dumped on a story that deserved a
better fate than this film was able to give it. </P>
