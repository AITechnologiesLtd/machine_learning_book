                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>Chad'z Rating: *** (out of 4 = OK)
1996, R, 121 minutes [2 hours, 1 minute]
[thriller]
starring: Mel Gibson (Tom Mullen), Gary Sinise (Jimmy Shaker), Rene Russo
(Kate Mullen), Delroy Lindo (Agent Lonnie Hawkins), written by Cyril Hume,
Richard Maibum, Alexander Ignon, Richard Price, produced by Brian Grazer,
Scott Rudin, Kip Hagopian, directed by Ron Howard.</P>
<P>"Ransom" is a typical Hollywood thriller, but it presents itself in a rather
original manner. It becomes overly dramatic and action-packed at times, but
everything is connected by such an interesting and suspenseful story it works
quite well.</P>
<P>Mel Gibson stars as Tom Mullen, a rich CEO of an airline company. Tom and
his wife Kate (Russo) host a science fair in New York's Central Park, and the
second they turn their back on their pre-teen son, he is gone. Suddenly the
story becomes fast-paced and the suspense element kicks into full gear. When
the kidnapper calls we hear a scary, distorted voice which works well.
However, I think the film tries too hard to be modern by having the Mullens
receive a picture of their son handcuffed to a bed via e-mail (couldn't they
just look at the address of the sender to find out who the kidnapper is?). </P>
<P>The film does not focus solely on the Mullens, it also takes time to
establish the kidnappers and their efforts to extort $2 million from the
Mullens. The kidnappers themselves are the most surprising element to the
movie: they are both high and low tech at the same time. It's hard to believe
a handful of second-rate computer hackers would be able to elude the FBI as
they do. However, the fact they do not fit the organized crime mold is
original. We even get some comic relief and good characterization despite the
choppy story.</P>
<P>The film is able to balance the drama of the Mullens' grief with some
exciting action and an interesting crime story. Gary Sinise is excellent as
Jimmy Shaker, a corrupt cop who is the criminal mastermind. He seems to have
a personal vendetta against Mullen, but we never really find out why. You
love to hate him because he's always in control and there aren't any cheesy
evil laughs.</P>
<P>Mullen turns the tables on the kidnappers by refusing to pay their ransom,
and instead offers it as a reward for their capture and the return of his
son. I thought this plot device was great, the only problem it causes is lots
of melodramatic screaming arguments between Tom and Kate, between the
kidnappers, and between both. </P>
<P>Twist endings are the backbone of great thrillers and crime stories, and
this film is no exception. The game of cat and mouse is essentially reversed
throughout the last act. It's difficult to describe all the details and
twists, but the final act is loaded with them.  Both sides win and lose at
the same time, unfortunately, this is accomplished through a completely
over-the-top sequence the film seemed to be avoiding all along.</P>
<P>It's difficult to make films that combine drama, crime, action, and
suspense, and although "Ransom" isn't perfect, it's still a good effort. </P>
