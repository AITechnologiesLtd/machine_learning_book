<P>Both "Simon Birch" and "The Mighty" feature sweet tales of friendship 
between two boys. Both films are also quite flawed, albeit in different 
ways, and your tolerance of those flaws will likely depend on whether or 
not the central storyline strikes an emotional chord with you.</P>
<P>Like "Simon Birch," "The Mighty" deals with a pair of young male outcasts 
who bond together. Kevin Dillon (Kieran Culkin) is unusually small and 
can walk only with braces, the result of a progressive, degenerative 
disease called Morquio syndrome. The bright kid spends most of his time 
in the world of books and the imagination, where, unencumbered by his 
physical limitations, he can slay dragons and rescue damsels in distress 
as a knight in King Arthur's court. </P>
<P>Maxwell Kane (Elden Henson) is a stocky, quiet and very lonely illiterate.
 The boy lives in his grandparents' basement, hiding from the cruel 
taunts of classmates and his own painful memories of one horrific night 
that tore his family apart. When Kevin (also known as "Freak") and his 
loving, fiercely protective mother (Sharon Stone) move in next door, 
everything changes. The 13-year-olds eventually become friends, each 
making up for the others limitations. With Kevin perched atop Max's 
shoulders, they become a powerful single unit. As Max puts it, "Freak was 
the brain, and I was the legs." Together, they venture forth confidently 
as a symbiotic knight in urban Cincinnati. </P>
<P>Based on "Freak The Mighty," the beloved Rodman Philbrick novel, "The 
Mighty" is a solid, often moving story about the pain of being ostracized 
and the healing power of friendship. Unlike "Simon Birch," which used an 
overbearing score and contrived situations to emotionally bully the 
viewer, "The Mighty" avoids overt manipulation. The central storyline is 
strong enough to play without orchestration, although a subplot involving 
Max's dad and his miscreant friends is heavy-handed, to put it mildly.</P>
<P>With a creation like this, chemistry is everything and the producers of 
"The Mighty" made some interesting casting decisions. 21-year-old Elden 
Henson is perfect as 13-year-old Max, despite the startling age gap. He 
captures the tortured young man's bottled-up pain splendidly, projecting 
strong emotions with an economy of expression. Henson is so good that he 
nearly makes up for Kieran Culkin's deficits. </P>
<P>Reportedly, "Simon Birch's" Ian Michael Smith, who has Morquio syndrome 
in real life, was turned down for the role of Kevin, and Culkin is simply 
too big to play the part. Beyond the physical incongruity, Culkin 
projects an extremely arrogant, smarmy air. While I empathized with the 
character, I didn't like him. Despite his distasteful smugness, though, 
there is an undeniable chemistry between the boys.</P>
<P>Sharon Stone is quite strong as Kevin's devoted mother, giving one of the 
best performances of her career, and Gena Rowlands and Harry Dean Stanton 
are solid, if underused, as Max's grandparents. Two other supporting 
performances must be noted. Meat Loaf plays Max's father and as an actor, 
he's a good singer. Finally, Gillian Anderson is embarrassingly bad as a 
drunken floozy, coming off like a bush-league version of Faye Dunaway in 
"Mommie Dearest." </P>
<P>Had the filmmakers cast Ian Michael Smith as Kevin and given the heave-ho 
to some of the film's secondary elements (including Gillian Anderson), 
"The Mighty" would have been a much more satisfying production. The film 
still resonates as is, thanks to its universal themes and Elden Henson's 
fine work, but, like "Simon Birch," "The Mighty" ultimately plays as a 
charming portrait of friendship trapped in an unexceptional movie.</P>
