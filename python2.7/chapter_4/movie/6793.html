<PRE>                                 MOTHER
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     "I like my cheese in ounces," middle-aged son John Henderson tells
his mother Beatrice.  "When they start weighing as much as a Fiat, I
stop being interested."  She has just taken an enormous and ancient
mound of cheese from her freezer so she can slice him a piece with her
electric carving knife.  After gagging on this and other petrified
pieces of food, he tells her in disgust, "You're running a food museum
here."</P>
<P>     The son, beautifully played for deadpan laughter and insight by
Albert Brooks, has gone back to live with his mother, done with
sweetness and determination by Debbie Reynolds.  She has the delightful
look of a geriatric pixie.  As the press kit information says, the
movie MOTHER is her first movie starring role in 27 years.</P>
<P>     After two divorces and other failed relationships, John has
decided he needs to conduct an "experiment."  He figures that his lack
of success with women must stem from the problems he has always had
with his mother.  If he can just go back and stay in his recreated
bedroom, perhaps he will discover the root cause of his distress.  That
is, if he and his mother don't kill each other first.</P>
<P>     The two seem as different as night and day.  He loves to indulge
himself whereas she will buy only the cheapest items to save money.
She does not consume them immediately, but instead squirrels them away
for some later date.  When he suggests that they splurge together on
some 91-cent extravagance from the grocery store, she is aghast.</P>
<P>     Albert Brooks is one of the best comedic actors, directors and
writers in America today.  His brilliance in this picture shines
through as he does all three roles with grace and perfect timing.  Just
as in his hilarious LOST IN AMERICA, his writing collaborator is Monica
Johnson.  Together they fashion an intelligent script so funny that a
few times I laughed so hard that I almost made myself sick.  I
understand now why Janet Maslin of the New York Times had MOTHER on her
best ten of the year list.  Although it did not make mine, it is a
comedic gem.</P>
<P>     What I like even better than the humor in the story is the
freshness of the character of the mother.  Usually, strong mothers like
Beatrice dissolve into Jewish mother cliches with lots of overbearing
lines delivered with heavy overacting.  This is not at all the
character that Reynolds gives us.  Reynolds's characterization of a
mother is a senior citizen with a love interest, among others.  "Dear,
we're not intimate," she tells John about her friend Charles (Peter
White).  "We just have sex occasionally."</P>
<P>     Beatrice is happily in control of her life so naturally she is
sure she knows what her son needs: food, albeit cheap food, and plenty
of it.  This causes him to exclaim, "Stop.  No more food.  It's like
FANTASIA."</P>
<P>     John is a science fiction writer, but not a particularly
successful one.  His brother Jeff (Rob Morrow), however, is a wealthy
sports agent.  Jeff is also a "mama's boy," who obsesses about talking
to his mother every day, and he hates the idea of sharing his mother
now with John.</P>
<P>     The movie is filled with great 60's style songs, but the best is
the "Mrs. Robinson" song that plays as John drives up the coast to go
to live with his mother.  They have changed the words to match MOTHER's
plot, but I will not reveal any of them.  They are precious.</P>
<P>     The biggest problem I had with the movie occurred 1:35 into the
picture.  I suddenly realized that the movie was about to end.  I was
upset.  I had grown to like these people and did not want them to leave
me.</P>
<P>     Since I pride myself in warning my readers about shows that can
prove troubling, let me do just the opposite with MOTHER.  I want to
allay your fears.  The ads clearly and accurately reassure us that, "NO
MOTHERS WERE HARMED DURING THE MAKING OF THIS MOTION PICTURE."</P>
<P>     Some movies work best for certain audiences.  I think this film
has a wide appeal, but for those of us with mothers of Beatrice's age,
it holds an extra fascination.  My mother is not at all like Beatrice,
but she has the same diminutive size and approximate age as Reynolds,
so in the scenes with Beatrice just barely seeing over the steering
wheel I got several extra chuckles.</P>
<P>     Although I invited my wife to the press screening and she loved
the movie too, I probably should have invited my mother instead.  On
the other hand, I still remember when I was twelve and invited my
mother to this new Hitchcock film called PSYCHO.  When the nude shower
scene suddenly came up, I was really worried about what she would think
of me for inviting her to see such as a show.  It worked out fine, but
I still remember my fear -- not of the scene, but of having lost face
with someone I respected.  Mothers are like that.  Good ones and bad,
they maintain an influence over your life forever.</P>
<P>     MOTHER runs 1:45.  It is rated PG-13 for the mature themes and
some mild profanity.  There is no sex, nudity, or violence.  The show
would be fine for kids say ten and up.  I recommend this charming
comedy to you and give it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
