Lander-Duke</PRE>
<P>   Mr. Abramowitz, (Oleg Yankovsky), the title character who
frames the picture, is an unimportant person from the point of
the view of the film's photographer and director but is the
most important person in the life of his daughter, Suzie,
known as Fegele in the birthplace which has been her home
for ten years.  Suzie's attachment to her dad is almost
Oedipal in intensity, but you can't blame her since the
unfortunate fellow, a cantor in the small Russian shtetl of
Borisov, was compelled to leave her behind when he
departed for America in 1927 in search of a better life--
intending to make enough money to send for Suzie later on.</P>
<P>   "The Man Who Cried" is yet another in the line of films
with motifs dealing in part with the domination of Europe
by the Nazis, which in the past year have included "Divided
We Fall," "Into the Arms of Strangers" and "Left Luggage." 
(Add "The Crimson Rivers" to that list if you include the
influence of Nazi thought on a modern-day French university.) 
While Sacha Vierny's photography is stunning, particularly
when contrasting the dirt-poor village that housed the Jews
with the opulence of an exquisite flat in Paris, and Osvaldo
Golijov's lovely music a welcome antidote to "Pearl Harbor"'s
deafening soundtrack, Herve's Schneid's editing gives the
entire movie the look of a series of trailers tacked on to one
another.  Sally Potter, who wrote the script to "The Man Who
Cried" as well, spends quite a long time in Europe slowly and
painfully developing the story for its ultimate payoff--which
proves to be almost anticlimactic in dramatic value.</P>
<P>   Christina Ricci inhabits the role of Suzie, seen first at about
the age of 10 (Claudia Lander-Duke) who, despite her
mellifluous singing voice stands out by adopting the silence of
the perpetual outsider.  When Cossacks invade the town and
burn the village, she escapes using the few gold coins that
her father had saved in the sugar jar and though clueless
about the destination of the ship, winds up not in America
where she expects to reunite with her dad but in England.
She is adopted by a Christian family with whom she remains
until she leaves ten years later for Paris to work in a chorus
line.  Taken under the wing by another Russian, the
gold-digging, Lola (Cate Blanchett), she acts like the
proverbial locked-out college roommate when Lola begins an
affair with an Italian opera singer, Dante Dominio (John
Turturro), who has a contract with producer Felix Perlman
(Harry Dean Stanton).  Luckily for Suzie, though, she loses
her virginity and gains a pair of starry eyes when she gains
the attention of a handsome but often sullen gypsy (Johnny
Depp).</P>
<P>   Sally Potter, whose "Orlando" is an engrossing, imaginative
tale of someone who lives for four hundred years--first as a
man and then as a woman--comes across this time with a
story as pedestrian as "Orlando" is innovative.  None of her
characters gets a three-dimensional treatment.  Cate
Blanchett's Lola is a caricature of the flirt and while John
Turturro benefits from the excellent dubbing of an operatic
voice,  Johnny Depp sleepwalks through his signature role as
a gypsy.   Christina Ricci's character is so repressed that we
are unconvinced of her ability as a singer.  Nor does she
inspire Johnny Depp, with whom she conducts a ho-hum little
love affair.  She's adept at learning Yiddish, though, and that's
a big plus for a nice, 20-year-old Santa Monica gal.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 100 minutes.  (C)2001,
