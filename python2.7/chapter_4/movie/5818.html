<PRE>                             ACT OF BETRAYAL
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     ACT OF BETRAYAL is a 1988 Australian movie about Northern Ireland
and how its troubles are not confined to its own part of the globe.
Although the film was made almost a decade ago and many of the actors
have aged since then, the story seems fresh out of this morning's
newspaper.  Elliott Gould stars in it and gives one of the best
performances of his career.</P>
<P>     The only other movie I have seen about Northern Ireland is the
excellent, and better, film CAL from 1984.  I am sure there may have
been many others, but I do not recall them.  At any rate, ACT OF
BETRAYAL is too long and too slow, but manages nevertheless is to teach
and to mesmerize.  If I could just get my hands on the editing table, I
could craft a great film by throwing away all of the extraneous
material.  With a finger poised on the fast forward button, you can
attempt to simulate this in your own home.  Don't give up on the show
because the second half features a great performance by Gould and turns
the show into an excellent thriller.</P>
<P>     The plot is that after another senseless bombing of innocent
victims including children, IRA terrorist  Michael McGurk (Patrick
Bergin from SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY) decides to turn himself in and to
tell whom the five leaders of the Belfast wing of the IRA are.  The
British army whisks away his family, wife Eileen (Lisa Harrow) and
young teenage son Sean (Krister Greer), to a safe haven in some army
barracks.</P>
<P>     Michael testifies against the IRA leaders in court, and they vow
to see that he and his family are murdered in cold blood.  His family
does not understand why he has turned against his old friends.  Michael
is alone.  They are given a new identity and sent to Australia to hide
for the rest of their lives.  The original policeman, Brian Kennedy
(Bryan Marshall), whom Michael turned himself in, accompanies them to
get them established in their new life.  The show is about whether they
will be found out and whether retire sleeper IRA agent Callaghan
(Elliott Gould) will be able to find and kill them.</P>
<P>     The director Lawrence Gordon Clark goes for the understated
approach which works well with the inherently sad material.  Too bad
his sense of pace isn't better.  One can be low key and still have
proper movement.</P>
<P>     The acting is all good.  Gould is great as a hit man who should
have retired years ago.  He is excellent as an overweight man trying to
chase his prey.  You feel exhausted just watching him.  The movie is at
its best when showing the tedium of the hunt.  Most of Callaghan's job
is mundane.   Also good is the strong but sentimental performance by
Bryan Marshall as the caring cop.  Patrick Bergin is a bit reserved,
but effective as the IRA agent turned confessor.</P>
<P>     The film is a good mixture of gritty and lush cinematography by
Breffni Byme and Peter Hendry, but the background sound is unrealistic
and bothersome, and the music (Bruce Smeaton) is pretty lackluster.</P>
<P>     Overall the story and the acting carry the show.  Still, too many
scenes in the first half are pointless and interminable so that it may
drive you nuts watching it.  Hang in there because the second half is
worth it.  The writers (Michael Chaplin and Nick Evans) do paint
themselves in a corner toward the end, but manage to extricate
themselves better than I thought they would.</P>
<P>     ACT OF BETRAYAL runs over three hours.  It is not rated, but would
be PG-13 for its subject matter.  There is no sex or nudity and the
violence is not graphic.  The movie would be fine for any kid 10 and
up.  I recommend the show to you flaws and all and give it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
