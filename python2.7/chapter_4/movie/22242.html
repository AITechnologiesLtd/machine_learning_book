<PRE>Anna and the King 
A film review by Marty Mapes 
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes </PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) ANNA AND THE KING is a joy to sit through. The lush,
exotic setting; a stirring performance from Jodie Foster; and a charming
Chow Yun-Fat make the two and a half hours drift by. One could easily
enjoy an afternoon at this movie.</P>
<P>But ANNA AND THE KING is full of problems, mostly coming from the script
of Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes. There are gratuitous explosions,
edits, subplots, and songs, not to mention a muddled message and fuzzy
focus.</P>
<P>The movie starts in Bangkok in 1862, just as Anna Leonowens is to
arrive. The British schoolteacher is here to teach King Mongkut's
children in the ways of the West. It's the story told in THE KING AND I,
and it's based on the diaries of Leonowens.</P>
<P>My own prejudiced notions say that this story should be about the
culture clash between Siam and Britain, and more to the point, the way
this clash works its way into a personal relationship.</P>
<P>For a while, this is exactly the focus of the movie. Anna settles in to
the new culture without giving up her Britishness. Her bold, cocky ways
make the Siamese bristle, but she remains proud and stoic. Because he
invited Anna, King Mongkut knows he should not restrain her. (He quickly
learns he CANNOT restrain her). Instead, he watches her efforts with
charmed amusement.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Anna truly IS arrogant, at one point stating
unquestionably that "The ways of England are the ways of the world."</P>
<P>Their relationship is flirtatious at first. Their mutual affection
reaches its peak at a great Western-style dinner party, where Anna and
Mongkut dance.</P>
<P>Afterwards, Mongkut presents Anna with a generous gift -- an elaborate
gold ring. She of course refuses the gift, which is far too great a
token. It represents a new level of seriousness in their relationship
where Anna will not go.</P>
<P>Her refusal of the king's gift casts an ugly light on Anna. The king no
longer sees her as charming, but as an arrogant, ungrateful guest, a
teacher who needs to be taught a lesson.</P>
<P>The first half of the movie works very well. The chemistry between
Foster and Chow is enjoyable and believable. The themes of power,
propriety, and respect are played out in every conversation. But the
movie loses its focus and intensity. It becomes less about cultures and
relationships and more about conflict and resolution.</P>
<P>Little problems abound, but worst of all are the two subplots that
hijack center stage. One is of a young couple's forbidden love, the
other is of a military coup. Both ostensibly tie in with the main
characters' relationship. But they are so prominent and distracting that
you forget whose movie this is.</P>
<P>The movie loses credibility in its handling of the subplot of the
lovers. Mongkut tells Anna that their cultures differ in every respect –
including love. The editor (Roger Bondelli) makes a point by immediately
cutting to the two lovers who are as Western as Romeo and Juliet. In
other words, the movie is choosing sides. It says that Mongkut is wrong
about love and that the Western way of love is correct. A movie about
culture clashes needs to be more open-minded than this.</P>
<P>It does even worse in its handling of the military coup. What started
out as a thoughtful movie about a relationship (a chick flick) now has
stunts, plan-blabbing villains, and even a gratuitous explosion (a guy
flick). All the while Anna (remember her?) is nowhere to be found. At
this point, the entire subplot is irrelevant. The movie's main
relationship has run its course. The 20 minutes it takes to follow the
"guy flick" plot should have simply been cut.</P>
<P>If there is a single problem that encapsulates all of the little
problems, it is that the movie panders. An explosion for the guys, Romeo
and Juliet for the gals, some cute children for the parents, and a pop
song over the credits for the teens. There's no mystery as to why the
movie panders: it's a big-budget studio picture with a Christmas
release. It bends over backwards to please all, which it can only do if
it is spineless.</P>
<P>I can't decide if the great-looking spectacle was enough to outweigh the
pandering plot. What I am sure of is that this movie could have been so
much more.</P>
