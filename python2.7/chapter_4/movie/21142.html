<P>   When "Gone With the Wind" hit the screens, the Civil War
was one of the most popular topics in America.  You couldn't
keep books about that tragic, if oxymoronic, event on the
shelves.  Now, high school kids think that the U.S. fought in
"The Silver War" and that the event occurred in ancient times
(about 1955).  "Ride With the Devil" is an entertaining way of
jogging our memories while providing a look at one particular
state which was--as the journalists commonly say about
families during that time--torn apart by the momentous,
appallingly self-destructive event.  Why self-destructive? 
Simply because the U.S.--unlike the other great powers of
now and then such as the former Soviet Union and just about
all the sovereignties of Europe--has been protected from
foreign aggression by two great oceans only to stupidly battle
its own countrymen!  </P>
<P>   "Ride with the Devil" takes us behind the scenes of a
chapter in the history of the Civil War with which few today
are familiar.  In fact, only those who have read Daniel
Woodrell's novel with the woebegone title "Woe to Live On"
would have the foggiest notion that a band of guerrilla
fighters began harassing and killing Northerners even before
the firing on Ft. Sumpter started the war officially, and that
these ragtag groups called Bushwhackers actually continued
a pattern of vindictive killing up to ten years after General Lee
signed off on the peace!  Maybe we here in the U.S. are not
so different from civil warriors of far less developed countries
like, for example, Vietnam, where the southern part during
the war were composed of people with divided loyalties--
some fighting for the Communist side, others staying loyal to
the pro-Western forces.</P>
<P>   "Ride with the Devil" is a long film at 134 minutes, a period
of time that could have been justified had the movie dealt
with the Civil War on a broader basis.  But focussing as it
does on the feelings of brotherhood and of tension among
these Bushwhackers with a dollop of romance and a
considerable amount of humor thrown in, the picture could
have been curtailed and tightened.  As a force for our
enlightenment about a forgotten chapter in our history, the
movie is invaluable.  As a piece of entertainment, it is spottier
in that some of the hostilities within the guerrilla group are not
sufficiently developed and the tragic massacre at Lawrence,
Kansas in which 180 civilians were killed, was over in a
couple of minutes.</P>
<P>   The picture is directed by Ang Lee, the Taiwanese born
helmer whose "The Ice Storm" was one of the most
discussed films of its year and who, as a man who might be
considered an outsider, is an ideal person to make a film
centering on two outsiders.  The action takes place around
the Kansas-Missouri border, with Kansas fighting on the
northern side and Missouri, though a slaveowning state,
surprisingly loyal as well to the Yankees.  But the state of
Missouri is far from unified, and these Bushwhackers are
determined to delete those forces within the area that are
loyal to the North and also to plunge across the border to the
abolitionist-centered city of Lawrence, Kansas.  </P>
<P>   Essentially Jake (Tobey Maguire), the son of a German
immigrant raised in Missouri is tight with the Jack Bull Chiles
(Skeet Ulrich), who as the son of a plantation owner is
anything but an outsider.  They meet up with a freed slave,
Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright) who is loyal to his former master
and like a surprising number of other blacks actually fights on
the Confederate side.  The big villain in the piece is the
sociopathic Pitt Mackerson (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), a
bloodthirsty outlaw who regularly badgers Jake because of
the latter's foreign ancestry (German-Americans were
generally loyal to the Union side) and has threatened to kill
him.  Complicating the plot is the presence of Sue Lee
Shelley (played by the pop singer Jewel in her first acting
role), a liberated widow who has the briefest of affairs with
Jack, becomes pregnant, and because of a turn of events
winds up as Jake's fiance.</P>
<P>   James Schamus's script eschews the sweep of "Gone with
the Wind" by delving into the topic of Bushwhackers, but the
dialogue is not what you'd call particularly sharp or edgy. 
Battle scenes, on the other hand, featuring scores of stunt
people and filmed in the style of the old Westerns but in a
way that might have warmed the heart of Akira Kurosawa,
look darn good.  The massacre at Lawrence, Kansas does
spare the women (these are southerners after all) but we get
the impression that most of the killing is being carried out by
the more psychotic types among the Bushwhackers since,
after all unarmed local residents are slaughtered, their stores
burned to the ground.</P>
<P>   Jeffrey Wright, who wowed the Broadway world in his role
in Tony Kushner's "Angels in America," gives a subtle
performance of an illiterate former slave who takes on a low-
key guise as a guy willing to fight for the southern tradition
while dreaming of buying freedom for his mother in Texas. 
Skeet Ulrich doesn't get to do much, but Tobey Maguire is
contributes a warmly humorous performance as a 19-year-old
who agrees to a shotgun wedding despite his virginity, and a
few other big names like Zach Grenier and Tom Wilkinson
add class to a reasonably solid Western on an little known
subject.  The subtext--that this war brought forth a nation of
greater freedom and equality than had been known before
but at the sacrifice of a great deal of tradition--is
demonstrated effectively.</P>
