                 A Film Review by James Kendrick
                         * (out of ****)<HR></PRE>
<P>Director: Carl Schenkel || Screenplay: Bayard Johnson and J.
Anderson Black || Stars: Casper Van Dien (Tarzan), Jane March
(Jane Porter), Steven Waddington (Nigel Ravens) || MPAA Rating:
PG<HR></P>
<P>"Tarzan and the Lost City" is one of the most anemic movies to
come out in quite a while. Not only it is poorly written, badly
acted, and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas, it is
thoroughly uninspired and insipid.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, it's not bad in the way great, colossal misfires
like "Heaven's Gate" (1980) or "Ishtar" (1987) were bad. 
Instead, it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody
wanted to be associated with, which begs the question of why it
was made in the first place. With all the good scripts lying
around Hollywood un-produced, how does needless drek like this
make its way to the big screen?</P>
<P>Of course, Tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of
motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films,
which have ranged from the very good (1984's "Greystoke: The
Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes") down to the really bad
(1981's "Tarzan, the Ape Man" with Bo Derek). Most of these films
were just cheapie B-movies made in the thirties and forties,
starring ex-Olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps.</P>
<P>Therefore, if another Tarzan movie is to be made, one might
assume that it would have something new to offer - a different
angle, an original storyline, anything to set it apart from all
the others. "Greystoke" added a never-before-seen level of
realism to the pulpy tale, and even "Tarzan, the Ape Man" at
least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a
vehicle for Bo Derek's bare breasts.</P>
<P>"Tarzan and the Lost City," on the other hand, has absolutely
nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad
dialogue. The script, by Bayard Johnson and J. Anderson Black is
about as formulaic and generic as they come. Comic books have
better plots than this. The movie is so bad, in fact, that it
retains that ridiculous Tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked
in last summer's comedy "George of the Jungle." Didn't the
producers think to leave that back in the old Weissmuller
pictures where it belongs?</P>
<P>The story starts with the legend of Tarzan already firmly
established: a quick opening narration tells of Tarzan (Casper
Van Dien) being found in the jungle after having been raised by
apes, and his return to England where he assumes his Greystoke
heritage. When the movie starts in 1913, he is a civilized
English gentleman (without an English accent), and he is to marry
Jane (Jane March) in less than a week.</P>
<P>However, when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named Nigel
Ravens (Steve Waddington) begins hunting for the fabled lost City
of Opar, one of Africa's last great secrets, the witch doctor of
an ancient African tribe summons Tarzan back to the jungle. At
first, Jane refuses to go, pouting about how it will interfere
with their wedding; but after Tarzan leaves she changes her mind
and tracks him down, therefore assuring lots of lame smooch
scenes between her and her ape-man.</P>
<P>Once the film gets going (in its own sluggish way), it delves
into a series of jungle adventures, as Tarzan, Jane, and the
natives attempt the thwart Ravens and his crew from discovering
the city. Most of the so-called adventures are cheesy,
predictable, and unexciting, with no pace, tension, or action to
speak of. There are sequences stolen from innumerable recent
adventure movies, ranging from "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981)
to "The Goonies" (1985). When the movie is running short on
action, it includes a few Greenpeace-friendly scenes of Tarzan
freeing caged animals, releasing a baby elephant from a trap, and
throwing ivory tusks into the river.</P>
<P>The movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality. For
instance, when Tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by
a cobra, he doesn't even attempt to suck the venom out like any
semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do. Instead, he ties a
tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with
no plan for survival.</P>
<P>Of course, one can't help but notice how fundamentally misleading
the title is. Not to ruin the ending or anything, but there is no
lost city. There is, however, a lost pyramid, which I suppose is
all the resource-strapped FX department could come up with (the
special effects are not worthy of a made-for-TV movie). Which
also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to
slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost
pyramid, when it's sitting right out in the middle of an open
field?</P>
<P>Strictly speaking, "Tarzan and the Lost City" isn't even bad
enough to have camp quality, although Casper Van Dien's laughably
stiff performance comes real close. This movie proves what
"Starship Troopers" only hinted at: he cannot act, but he sure
looks well-groomed, even in the deepest heart of the African
jungle. Van Dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an
effective Tarzan; he's a Calvin Klein model in a loin cloth. I
also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it
outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 Steve Perry haircut.</P>
<P>Waddington makes a decent villain, although he's like a charmless
version of Belloq from "Raiders of the Lost Ark." As Jane, the
ex-model Jane March has little to do but smile and look pretty
next to Tarzan. She does fire off a gun at the evil treasure
hunters a time or two, but whenever a snake comes into the
picture, she is reduced to a hysterical mess.</P>
<P>However, amidst all this complaining, I do have one piece of good
news. "Tarzan and the Lost City" is so lacking in ideas both new
and old, that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of
celluloid. So, we can say this much for it: at least it had the
decency to be short.</P>
