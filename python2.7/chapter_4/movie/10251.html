<P>Losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing. Reacting to such a personal
setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare. While
we all might feel the desire to blow someone's head off with a shotgun when
they don't seem to grasp our point of view, actually threatening them with one
is usually something we avoid. This isn't the case with Sam Baily - John
Travolta's slightly askew average-joe persona in MAD CITY.</P>
<P>"I don't think people listen to guys like me," Sam laments during an exclusive
interview from behind the walls of a museum. Just a few days ago, Sam was a
guard at this same museum, but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his
security position, Sam's apprehension resulted in a brash decision. In an
effort to get his ex-boss, museum director Mrs. Banks (Blythe Danner), to
"just listen", he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded
shotgun, taking the uncooperative Banks and a group of school children
hostage.</P>
<P>Sam's overall concern is valid enough - if he loses his job, his paycheck, his
benefits, etc., his wife and two children won't be provided for. He's not a
lunatic or a hot-tempered madman, he's somewhat like a child - panicky,
compulsive, and running on emotion - and his naive intentions aren't helped
any by the fact that Banks wasn't overly compassionate with the let go.
Overall, he's just like you and me - except that he has the capacity to view
the line we'd deem "far enough" as the starting mark of some crazy race.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, television reporter Max Brackett (Dustin Hoffman) is also on the
scene. Covering a "fluff" story for the evening news concerning the museum
cutbacks, Max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggest-breaking
news story he ever could've hoped for. Having been demoted from network
newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting, Max is anxious to turn this into
his, and only his, story.</P>
<P>Max immediately bonds with Sam. Max even coaches Sam thru hostage negotiations
and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone. At first,
Max's intentions don't stretch beyond high ratings and a good boost to the ole
pride factor, but as he gets to know Sam more personally, he begins to
sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him. The media,
however, is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as
often as a diesel truck moving downhill. The accidental shooting of ex-co-
worker Cliff (Bill Nunn), a black security guard, becomes one of the main
factors in the controversy over Sam's honest ambitions.</P>
<P>Also involved in this film are Robert Prosky as Lou Potts, head of the news
department of the station Max falls directly under, and Alan Alda as the
nationally famed reporter Kevin Hollander, who uses his network power to try
and outshine Max. Alda and Prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like
gloves on their acting abilities. Then there is Mia Kirshner, who plays the
young TV station intern Laurie. She falls under Max's wings only to become a
student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting. Kirshner's
credits are relatively small for now, including roles in films like EXOTICA
and the forgettable sequel to THE CROW. Still, Kirshner's character
transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl and
kinda-bitchy-in-a-reserved-way roles. I wouldn't mind seeing her in some more
prevalent parts, where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully
onscreen.</P>
<P>While the viewpoint of the media as a greedy, self-righteous monster has
indeed been tackled before, MAD CITY provides a solid two hours of
enjoyability. Hoffman and Travolta are both excellent actors, and seeing them
together is a real treat. They both do a great job at smoothly and naturally
becoming their characters, and they provide enough chemistry for us to
genuinely care for both. There is quite a bit of humor in this film, and
without it, it could've fallen into a drab, cliched social statement more
likely to garner sleep from the audience than applause. This isn't a flick
that will grip at both your funny bone and your heart, but it will lightly
touch both, making for a recommendable movie. If for nothing more than the
opportunity to watch both Hoffman and Travolta at the same time, I urge you to
check this one out.</P>
