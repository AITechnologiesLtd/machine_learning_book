<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A thoroughly enjoyable film about a pitiless serial killer of
middle-aged women, that is played for laughs at the expense of the women
victims. It is a black comedy, acclaimed for its stellar performances,
especially by Rod Steiger as Christopher Gill, the psychologically
warped killer, with a severe mother fixation, who uses a number of
disguises to commit the murders and performs the murders as if he was
on-stage, being only natural, considering that he is an accomplished
Broadway actor and well-known theater owner, and the son of a great
actress.</P>
<P>George Segal is the likable Jewish detective, Morris Brummel, who is
assigned to investigate the murder case. He also has a mother problem,
as his stereotypical Jewish mother, Eileen Heckart, offers him her
possessive love and could nag with the best of them. This presents an
interesting contrast with the way the killer handles his neuroses.
Segal, who lives with his mother, takes his daily punishment in stride,
offering a bon mot here and there and sometimes just a resigned look,
but without really complaining, rather feeling resigned to his fate and
accepting it like a mensch (man). His performance is endearing and
Heckart's is amusingly right on target. Also noteworthy, is the
beautiful and giddy shiksa (non-Jewish woman), Lee Remick as Kate
Palmer, who will become romantically involved with the nice Jewish boy
as a result of the case. She is delightfully refreshing, offering her
beauty, sensitivity, and comedy in a splendid performance. Her romance
with the bashful Segal was well-conceived, as she leads him on by her
womanly flirtations and draws out of him how much he loves her as a
whole person and not just for her body, as her past lover did. She also
has this great line, in response to him complimenting her on her looks,
"Getting dolled up is easy; looking natural takes time." This is an
actor's film and they all make the most of it.</P>
<P>In the first scene, Steiger is disguised as an Irish priest, merrily
walking into his first victim's tenement building whistling and when
seeing Remick on the stairs, saying "top of the morning" to the art
museun guide who lives in the victim's building and will be called on to
become an eyewitness to identify the killer. Steiger knocks on Mrs.
Mulloy's door and gains entry by saying he is the new priest in the
neighborhood. He drinks some port with her, tells her some absurd
stories, and he begins to tickle her like his mother liked to be
tickled, and, as she goes into a ticklish convulsion, he strangles her
to death. He leaves her in the bathroom with his trademark signature for
the murder, lips smeared on with lipstick across her forehead.</P>
<P>Segal is assigned the case and is quoted in the paper as giving the
killer a rave review, saying how well-planned and executed the murder
was. Steiger calls him the next day and offers to become Segal's
telephone confidant, but tells him, "Remember, I am smarter than you
are." He will commit five murders and only fail to call Segal after the
first and fourth.</P>
<P>Steiger next poses as a German plumber and after eating some home-made
cake with the middle-aged woman who was born in Frankfort, a place where
he pretends he's from, he strangles her and does his lipstick bit again.
He then calls Segal and gives him the latest victim's address.</P>
<P>This role is a hammy actor's dream, a role in which Steiger gets a
chance to outshine the indomitable Peter Sellers, the master of
disguises. Steiger will also be disguised as a gay hairdresser, a police
officer, a woman, and an Italian waiter with a southern accent. He will
do Cary Grant, W.C. Fields, and Maurice Chevalier imitations, as well as
calling the detective from different places, such as an art gallery,
Sardi's restaurant, and from Remick's apartment.</P>
<P>There is one very funny scene where a midget confesses to the crime, but
who becomes upset that Segal doesn't take his confession seriously. When
told an eyewitness says the killer was of normal height, the midget
responds, "See, I'm a master of disguises."</P>
<P>It was difficult not to find this witty film funny and its romantic
subplot equally charming. It was adapted from William Goldman's novel.</P>
