<PRE>_Go_ (R) **** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Since the surprise success of the 1994 Quentin Tarantino film, many films
have tried to become "the next _Pulp_Fiction_."  Films ranging from studio
efforts like the 1996 MGM release _2_days_in_the_Valley_ to the recent
British indie import _Lock,_Stock_and_Two_Smoking_Barrels_ have, in the
name of achieving commercial success and cinematic "cool," purloined at
least one characteristic of that modern-day classic: the seedy underworld
milieu, quirky canvases of characters played by large ensemble casts,
twisty plot threads linking these characters, "hip" dialogue heavy with pop
culture references, and--above all else--ultraviolence.  More often than
not, though, the films end up not so much cool but cold--as in dead (on
arrival).</P>
<P>With its large cast, crime world setting, and timeline-overlapping
storylines, _Go_, written by first-timer John August and directed by Doug
Liman (who created a different brand of cinematic "cool" with 1996's
_Swingers_), could not tempt failure more dangerously.  Yet of all the
_Pulp_ knockoffs I've seen, this is the first that truly understands and
captures what made that film such a triumph.  It wasn't the casting (though
that definitely helped); it certainly wasn't the violence; nor was it the
snappy dialogue of Tarantino and Roger Avary's Oscar-winning script--at
least not that aspect of the screenplay, anyway.</P>
<P>The elusive quality in question is the element of realistic surprise.
_Go_ spans one eventful 24-hour span, during which the life paths of Ronna
(Sarah Polley), a teenage supermarket clerk who tries her hand at drug
dealing; Ronna's British co-worker Simon (Desmond Askew); and friends Adam
and Zack (Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf) constantly crisscross through Los
Angeles and Las Vegas.  While following these three threads, August and
Liman find unpredictable yet completely plausible ways to link the stories
and take them in their own wild, roller coaster-like directions--without
ever falling into the cheap trap of gratuitous violence.  To say anymore
would be to rob the viewer of this film's greatest delight: that of discovery.</P>
<P>Not too far behind is the August's sharp sense of humor (suffice it to
say, his hilarious dialogue and original comic situations do have snap) and
the sterling ensemble.  Everyone does a standout job, but especially
noteworthy are Polley, so good in Atom Egoyan's _The_Sweet_Hereafter_, who
takes a surefooted step toward the mainstream; Askew, a newcomer to this
side of the Atlantic; creepy William Fichtner, playing a cop with a hidden
agenda; and Katie Holmes and Taye Diggs shine in more secondary roles.  Not
to be ignored, though, are the efforts of Liman.  He shows a disarming
visual flair never hinted at in _Swingers_ (which was more of a
script-dependent movie than a director-dependent one), and it is his
guiding voice that assembles the numerous parts into a finely calibrated
thrill machine.</P>
<P>Because of its largely youthful cast, _Go_ is in danger of--and, in fact,
already has, to some extent--being pigeonholed as a "teen _Pulp_Fiction_,"
and given the films' similarities, that title is not entirely undeserved.
But _Go_ deserves a more favorable comparison.  While not in the same
league as its precursor, what August and Liman have done is use _Pulp_
basics to create a film that is, by its own merits, a fiercely original and
exhilarating entertainment.</P>
