<PRE>WILD THINGS
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Kevin Bacon; Matt Dillon; Neve Campbell; Theresa Russell & Denise
Richards</P>
<P>If you were to judge Wild Things based on the advertising alone, it may be
reasonable for someone to conclude that it is nothing more than Hollywood's
version of a soft core porn flick. Considering most clips feature the very
well endowed Denise Richards walking around in very skimpy clothing. Of
course by now, most people have heard about the menage-a-trois involving
Kevin Bacon, Neve Campbell and the afore mentioned Ms. Richards. If that
wasn't enough you have also no doubt heard about Kevin Bacon's full frontal
nude scene. So with all this T&A being hyped and talked about, does the
movie have anything else besides sex and nudity. Much to my surprise, Wild
Things is a really good movie. Now I have to admit up front that the main
reason I went to this film, other than to review it, was for the over hyped
lesbian scenes. (Judging by the large proportion of males in the theater,
I'm not the only one who went because of that.)</P>
<P>Now Wild Things is sort of difficult to write a synopsis on. Not that it's
confusing, it's just one of those movies that you can't say too much about
before you start giving things away.
Wild Things revolves around a spoiled rich girl, Kelly Van Ryan, (Denise
Richards) and her claim that one of her high school teachers, Sam Lombardo,
(Matt Dillon) raped her. Kevin Bacon plays the police detective assigned to
the case, and Neve Campbell is the girl from the wrong side of the tracks
who comes forward with a similar charge against the teacher. Obviously not
everything is as it appears in Wild Things, but to say too much would ruin
the film. Let's just say that it is worth your time to go find out for
yourself. By the end of the movie nothing will surprise you anymore. This is
one well thought out movie.</P>
<P>As to performances -- having never been a big Matt Dillon fan I was
pleasantly surprised at how good he was in this film. Kevin Bacon also gave
one of his better performances in a while. Denise Richards who's only other
claim to fame was Starship Troopers does a good job here. She has a great
deal of potential, hopefully she will get recognized for her talent and not
just she looks. Too often talented actresses who happen to be well-endowed
fall into the trap of taking roles that involve nudity over substance.
(Natasha Henstridge is a good example.) Although,
I digress. Neve Campbell does a fair job, but seems to be taking roles that
are becoming more and more annoying. Theresa Russell also is in the film as
Denise Richard's over sexed mother. My question was, why? The woman is in
her 40's and they have her prancing around in a bikini. It was just
embarrassing. Robert Wagner has a cameo as Denise Richard's lawyer, while he
overacts in a way that would make William Shatner proud, it is good to see
him again in a film. The one to watch is Bill Murray as Matt Dillon's
attorney. Murray, as always is great, and unlike some of the films that he
has done in recent years, this time the writing backs up his talent. Murray
steals every scene he is in.</P>
<P>One other point about the movie that is interesting to note, is the end
credits. In recent years directors have taken to showing out takes and
bloopers during the end credits. Wild Things goes a step further. During the
credits they show how the events of the movie came to be. It's kind of like
a mini prequel. Its worth the extra few minutes that you have to stay in
your seat.</P>
<P>So if you want lots of sex, and shots of Denise Richards topless, then Wild
Things is the movie for you. If you are interested in a movie with a great
story and good overall acting, Wild Things fits the bill there too. It's
certainly going to rank as one of the most fun movies of the year.</P>
<P>8/10 (I would even rate it that high if Denise Richards wasn't naked)</P>
