<PRE>Days of Wine and Roses (1962)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 74</PRE>
<P>Alcoholism is an excellent dramatic theme.  The
director is given many ideas to work from.  The
personalities and fortunes of the characters
can be contrasted before and after they have been
drinking.  The effects on their health, both mental
and physical, their families, and their job can
be explored.  There can be an enabling character,
who helps the alcoholic remain afloat.  There can be
a rescuer, who attempts to stop the alcoholic from
drinking.  There can be recoveries and relapses, hopes
raised and dashed.  And the ending is in limbo,
maintaining suspense.</P>
<P>So it is no wonder that there have been many good
films about alcoholics.  "The Lost Weekend" is
probably the best of the genre, but "Days of Wine
and Roses" is also very good.  Blake Edwards directed
and Jack Lemmon has the lead role, although both are
better known for comedies.  While the script is
sometimes heavy-handed, and one suspects that the great
majority of alcoholics do not fall from successful
businessman to flophouse bum, the symptoms and effects
of excessive drinkings are effectively depicted.</P>
<P>Jack Lemmon is a gregarious public relations executive,
who wooes and wins waifish Lee Remick.  Lemmon is
already an alcoholic, and soon Remick is one as well.
Things go from bad to worse, with Lemmon losing his
job, and Remick neglecting her child.  Charles Bickford
plays Remick's sullen father, an enabler who even
offers Lemmon a drink.  Hope arrives with rescuer
and Alcoholics Anonymous member Jack Klugman, but
can Lemmon overcome his dependency and save his marriage?</P>
<P>The second half of the film has several extraordinary
scenes.  Lemmon is shown in a straightjacket: screaming,
kicking, biting, and sweating.  Later, he is strapped
on a bed for days, delirious and half-naked.  Remick
comes off little better, shown comatose on a couch,
drinking heavily and watching Warner Brothers cartoons.
(At least Remick remains loyal to the studio that is
producing the film.)  While unintentionally entertaining,
these scenes validate Klugman's prediction: sooner or
later the bottle becomes God.</P>
