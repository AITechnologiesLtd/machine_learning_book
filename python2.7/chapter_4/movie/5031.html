<P>     It's said that nothing new comes out of Hollywood these days, and 
that's certainly the case with MRS. WINTERBOURNE, a romantic comedy 
based on Cornell Woolrich's I MARRIED A DEAD MAN.  This film creates a 
sense of deja vu that may have viewers flashing back to last year's 
WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, a remarkably similar story.  However, while 
SLEEPING boasted the talents of a charismatic Sandra Bullock and affable 
Bill Pullman, MRS. WINTERBOURNE has an irritating Ricki Lake and bland 
Brendan Fraser.  It's not hard to guess which is the better movie.</P>
<P>     Stripped to its bare bones, MRS. WINTERBOURNE is about a lonely 
woman finding a family and romance when she pretends to be the wife of a 
dead man.  Connie Doyle (Ricki Lake) is abandoned on the streets of New 
York City when she refuses to abort her boyfriend's child.  Nine months 
pregnant and homeless, she stows away on a train to Boston, where she 
meets Hugh Winterbourne (Brendan Fraser) and his expecting wife, 
Patricia (Susan Haskell).  The train is involved in a wreck, and Hugh 
and Patricia are killed.  As a result of certain artificial 
circumstances, Connie is believed to be Patricia, and her baby, who is 
born just after the crash, is accepted as the late Hugh's son.  The pair 
are invited to the Winterbournes' Boston mansion to meet Hugh's mother, 
Grace (Shirley MacLaine), and his twin brother, Bill (also Fraser).  
While Grace accepts Connie's story without question, Bill is suspicious, 
especially when she signs a check "Connie Doyle" instead of "Patricia 
Winterbourne". </P>
<P>     Perhaps because it bears such a marked resemblance to WHILE YOU 
WERE SLEEPING, MRS. WINTERBOURNE comes across as stale and recycled.  
The plot is littered with the kinds of contrivances and coincidences 
common to all mistaken identity stories, but, instead of dealing with 
such issues in a fresh and intelligent manner, the script treats them 
with a workmanlike, sit-com approach (not surprising, considering that 
co-screenwriter Phoef Sutton worked on CHEERS).  And, although MRS. 
WINTERBOURNE offers a few humorous moments, the comedy isn't consistent.</P>
<P>     As I've often said in the past, chemistry is critical to a romantic 
comedy's success.  Here, there's precious little between leads Ricki 
Lake and Brendan Fraser.  Fraser, who hasn't given a good performance 
since SCHOOL TIES, makes Bill ineffectual and uninteresting.  Lake, a TV 
talk show host and veteran of John Waters movies, does a credible Rosie 
O'Donnell imitation -- that's to say she's equally aggravating.  At 
least Shirley MacLaine is her usual solid self, but, although her 
presence saves a few scenes, she can't rescue MRS. WINTERBOURNE.  </P>
<P>     For director Richard Benjamin, who debuted behind the camera with 
1982's MY FAVORITE YEAR, MRS. WINTERBOURNE isn't likely to be a stand-
out on his resume.  This film mistakes action for energy, ridiculous 
circumstances for comedy, and a mismatched male/female pairing for 
romance.  Those in search of a lighthearted love story would do better 
checking out THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS, or, for something really 
similar, renting WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING.  Unlike MRS. WINTERBOURNE, 
neither of those films is mired in mediocrity.</P>
