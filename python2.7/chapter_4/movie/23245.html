<PRE>                             REINDEER GAMES
                    A film review by Christopher Null
                      Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>     REINDEER GAMES is one of those movies that thinks so much of itself
it sports a special cover sheet over the press notes, reading, "REINDEER
GAMES is filled with twists and turns that we hope will keep the
audience guessing," followed by a plea that critics will not spoil the
fun by divulging these twists and turns to the gentle readers.</P>
<PRE>     All of which assumes there is some fun to spoil.</PRE>
<P>     Set on a cold Christmas Eve in Michigan, REINDEER GAMES borrows
heavily from its northern brethren FARGO and A SIMPLE PLAN, leaving the
best elements of both those films on the cutting room floor.  Writer
Ehren Kruger (ARLINGTON ROAD, SCREAM 3) has tried his darnedest to
create a formula heist movie that breaks from the formula.
Unfortunately he has given us something barely worthy of Arnold
Schwarzenegger.</P>
<P>     The plot starts off with promise: Rudy (Ben Affleck) and his
cellmate Nick (James Frain) are set to get out of prison in 3 days, but
the day before release, Nick gets killed (oh no!).  Rudy takes one look
at Nick's pen-pal Ashley (Charlize Theron) and decides, what the hell,
he'll impersonate his best jail-friend to get a little nookie.  But Rudy
quickly gets drawn into a casino-robbery scheme by Ashley's evil brother
Gabriel (Gary Sinise), and then the twists begin.</P>
<P>     Of course, by that time a long and lonely hour has passed.  The
first half of REINDEER GAMES just sits there, spiked with droll
voice-over setting up the notion that Ben Affleck just might be the next
big action hero.  (He's not.)  While Kruger and all-star director John
Frankenheimer try to imbue REINDEER GAMES with that FARGO mystique, they
mainly end up relying on Theron's bared breasts to captivate the
audience.  Mind you, movies have been carried on less before, but the
ho-hum thrills and coincidental mystery of these GAMES will likely leave
you shrugging with indifference on the way out the door.</P>
<P>     How could a two-inch shiv kill Nick?  Why would anyone believe Rudy
is Nick?  Why does Gary Sinise look like he did in FORREST GUMP?
Whether you bother to worry about the details is up to you.</P>
<PRE>     Not to mention, Christmas was two months ago.</PRE>
