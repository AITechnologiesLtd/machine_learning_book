<P>     From its opening minutes, HILARY AND JACKIE promises intriguing spins
on a couple of time-worn dramatic set-ups:  the competitive siblings, and
the tortured artistic genius.  We first meet our sister protagonists as
children in 1950s England -- Hilary Du Pre (Keely Flanders) soaring on the
flute while Jacqueline (Auriol Evans) saws flatly on her cello.  It is
Hilary whose talent lands her on a BBC broadcast, earning her adulation
from her parents and others which spurs Jackie to a ferocious commitment
to improving her own musical skills.  Soon it is Jackie whose performances
are receiving standing ovations, the adult Jackie (Emily Watson) who rises
to international aclaim while Hilary (Rachel Griffiths) slips into
comfortable domesticity with her husband Kiffer (David Morrissey).</P>
<P>     Director Anand Tucker's adaptation of Hilary's memoir (co-written
with brother Piers) introduces some provocative questions regarding how
and why a prodigy becomes an artist.  Jackie's success surpasses Hilary's
not through superior inate talent, it is suggested, but through superior
effort, exemplifying the 99% perspiration in that aphorism about what
makes genius.  The film also introduces a wild card in the form of the
dance and movement classes both girls take, lessons which seem to
contribute to Jackie's uniquely passionate style but hinder Hilary's
efforts to excel at her own instrument.  The tension between the sisters
is set in what happens after their apparent childhood destinies flip-flop:
how Hilary abandons music altogether, and how Jackie comes to feel trapped
by her own success.</P>
<P>     If Tucker and screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce had explored the
siblings' relationship as effectively as they explore their respective
careers, HILARY AND JACKIE might have been a brilliant film.  As it
stands, it's a pretty good one which offers wildly disparate insight into
its two main characters.  At one point in the first hour, a title card
with the single word "Hilary" launches us into one sister's world when
Jackie's success first divides them.  This leaves us with Hilary, whose
interior life is left something of a mystery to us as she chooses marriage
and family over music.  There's a spark of curiosity as Jackie makes an
incredible request of her sister, but we never get a clear enough sense of
why Hilary grants that request.  The author chooses to remain enigmatic
herself, allowing the spotlight to shift entirely to Jackie in this story
with the same questionable selflessness she chose in life.</P>
<P>    There's hope that their relationship will become clearer when the
"Jackie" section begins, but that's not the case.  Instead, the story
begins a fascinating look at Jackie's love-hate relationship with her
music, which she feels is the only reason anyone loves her.  Emily Watson
gets a showy role as the artist who struggles with her own identity and,
eventually, with multiple sclerosis.  It's a great performance as a great
character, yet it's disappointing that we watch her interact with her
cello nearly as much as she interacts with Hilary.  Though Jackie's sense
of isolation is the theme of the film's second half, it doesn't allow us
to understand what these two women were to each other.  HILARY AND JACKIE
is a revelation when it allows us to see what people surrender for art, as
well as why people surrender their art.  As a family affair, it's more
labor than genius.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 sister acts:  7.</PRE>
