<P>Several "experiments" were tested in the film industry this year. Director
Mike Figgis decided to put together a slew of actors with no script and tape
them for 90 minutes straight and turn it into a film entitled TIME CODE. An
interesting experiment which was also entertaining, at least, in my point of
view. Director Kenneth Branagh also tested a small experiment when he mixed
Shakespeare and old-time musicals in a bag and came out with LOVE'S LABOUR'S
LOST. Another interesting experiment which was for me, even highly
entertaining, despite its fluffiness.</P>
<P>And now comes Lars Von Trier, winner of the 2000 Cannes Palme D'Or award,
with a dramatic motion picture starring singer Bjork in her acting debut, in
a film which courageously attempts to mesh an extremely serious dramatic
story with Hollywood musical interludes? Yup...let's see how that worked
out.</P>
<P>PLOT:
An immigrant woman who is slowly losing her sight is saving up money to give
her kid an eye operation so that he will not go similarly blind in the
future. Her neighbor is a married copper who needs dough to pay the mortgage
and maintain his wife's standard way of spending money. The two become
friends and share their troubles with one another, until the day things
begin slowly disintegrating in both of their lives. Expect musical
interludes during the film, as the lead character escapes reality via a
fantasy world of Hollywood musicals.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A very strange, provocative film which cannot leave you without an opinion,
featuring some great acting, some interesting musical numbers but ultimately
an experiment that runs too long and doesn't provide for much true emotional
attachment or appreciation. Now before every art lover begins to bust my
balls, here's what didn't work for me in the film. This movie reminded me a
lot of those modern pieces of art. You know, the kinds of pieces which
amaze, delight and touch many quite deeply, while others shrug them off as
just plain junk...and pretentious to boot! Well, I certainly wouldn't call
this film junk (pretentious, natch), in fact, I admire it greatly for its
courage to break all of the rules and try something very different, but for
me, the overall film wasn't anything more than that...an experiment. And
despite appreciating the acting throughout most of the film, I didn't
particularly get attached to any of the characters, and could not feel
anything for them as negative elements began to touch their lives. Perhaps
it was because of the musical interludes which led me to interpret it all as
one big fantasy, or perhaps it was because the film just moved too slowly
and the lead character was too irrational and sacrificial for me to believe,
but whatever the reason, the film itself left no emotional resonance on me.
That's not to say that the movie stunk, but it certainly didn't overpower me
as it did many others who apparently left the theatre deeply touched and/or
moved. I enjoyed the performances, particularly Bjork, who should definitely
get a nod for this, the songs and dance numbers, which were shot using 100
locked-down video cameras and a look different from the rest of the film,
and the ambitiousness of it all. Mind you, I didn't particularly care for
the lyrics of the songs, which were "spoken" rather than sung and just
seemed kind of...well, lame. You haven't seen a movie until you've seen
David Morse dance and "talk along" with a musical ditty. Trust me, see it
and be afraid...be very afraid.</P>
<P>But here you have this very, very serious story being told by a woman whose
motivations I just didn't buy into. She seemed to be writing off everything
else in her life, just to get her son that operation. And even though I
appreciate her altruistic sentiment, the film just wasn't able to pull me
into its corner in that respect. And let's not kid each other here, this
film is not for everyone. The so-called "art-house" crowd will undoubtedly
eat it up, but I don't see most regular movie-goers appreciating much about
this film. Films generally fall into several categories: fun cheese (which
this is not and doesn't pretend to be), entertaining and light (which this
is not and doesn't pretend to be), deep and emotional (which this wasn't for
me but does pretend to be) or just interesting as a watch (which this was
for me and did pretend to be). The film is also partly shot in Dogme95
style, natural lighting, lots of handheld cameras, a real "documentary"
feel, which may or may not turn off certain people. I enjoyed the acting,
appreciated the originality of it all and liked the songs by Bjork (but then
again, I've always been a fan of hers), but didn't really "get into the
story", thought it moved too slowly and ran way too long, and didn't buy
into the lead character's motivations. Admittedly, there was one pretty
harrowing scene in this film featuring one of the most realistic murders
that I have seen on screen, but I guess that overall, you could say that I
am on the fence with this one. I liked the experimental aspects of the
movie, but not so much the complete movie itself. Now that was easy, wasn't
it? Yipes.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Bjork's last name is Gudmundsdottir. She has one son with ex-husband Thor.
She comes from Iceland and used to be the lead singer for the pop-punk band,
"The Sugarcubes". Since leaving the band, she has led a successful solo
career of her own. She won the award for Best Actress for this film at the
2000 Cannes Film Festival, after which she apparently noted that she would
never act again. She was originally hired by director Von Trier to compose
the songs for his "radical anti-musical", but after spending a year
identifying with the doomed, self-sacrificing heroine in the script, she
finally decided to accept Von Trier's continuous pleas to portray the woman
on camera.
Director Lars Von Trier's advice to Bjork in regards to her character was,
"Please don't act. I hate acting; feel yourself through it." So Bjork claims
that she kind of "became her".
Ironically, this film features continuous references to one of the greatest
musical movies of all-time: THE SOUND OF MUSIC. In fact, Bjork's character
is set to play Maria in the theatrical version of the film in this movie.
Cameo appearances in this film include Stellan Skarsgard, Udo Kier and Joel
Grey.
Despite this film being set in the state of Washington, most of it was shot
in Sweden. The rumor is that this was done because director Lars Von Trier
doesn't take airplanes.</P>
