<P>_Three_Kings_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>        At the end of the Gulf War, a group of four--_not_ three--American
soldiers (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze) head
out to the Iraqi desert to claim millions in stolen Kuwaiti gold as their
own.  Much like their seemingly simple journey, there is more to
_Three_Kings_ than one expects.  Writer-director David O. Russell,
heretofore best known for the idiosyncratic indies _Spanking_the_Monkey_
and _Flirting_with_Disaster_, establishes a quirky sense of humor in the
film's lighthearted early treasure hunting stages, then midway shifts
gears into a thoughtful--but never heavyhanded--examination of the
post-war plight of the Iraqi people.  The shock comes in not the
suddenness of the transition but in how the change is barely noticeable. 
Russell juggles comedy, drama, traditional war and action-adventure movie
elements in _Three_Kings_, and their seamless blending makes for a studio
picture uncommon in its unique sensibility and personality.  </P>
<P>The latter, of course, owes a great debt to the ensemble.  As the
ringleader of the gang, Major Archie Gates, Clooney is his typically
charismatic self, and it's a testament to his costars' work that his
formidable screen presence never dominates.  Wahlberg and Cube more than
hold their own as Sgt. Troy Barlow and Chief Elgin, respectively (even if
the latter is saddled with a fairly limited role), and more secondary
players like Nora Dunn (as TV reporter Adriana Cruz) and Jamie Kennedy
(as the slightly-off soldier Walter Wogeman) are given their share of
moments to call their own.  But the surprising standout is Jonze, who, in
his acting debut, proves to possess talents that go beyond his claim to
fame in music video directing.  His funny and ultimately moving work as
Pvt. Conrad Vig, who intensely admires Troy, is the film's true buried
treasure.</P>
