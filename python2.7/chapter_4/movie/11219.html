<PRE>Mission: Impossible
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1996 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Supposedly based on the television series from the late sixties and early
seventies, this film directed by Brian De Palma is only barely. It does have
the series title, a character's name (although certainly not the _same_
character) and some hi-tech gobligoop, but that's all that connects it to the original.</P>
<P>The series featured a team that pulled off a complex operation each episode
that featured disguises, split-second timing and usually completed its task
without anyone from the outside knowing what had happened.</P>
<P>The movie gives us a `James Bond-Lite' lone agent (Tom Cruise) who blows up a
bunch of stuff.</P>
<P>The first few minutes lull the audience into a false sense of a Mission:
Impossible film with a group assigned to catch the thief of a NOC list naming
undercover agents. Unfortunately for the team and the film, most of them
shortly meet an untimely demise including Emilio Estevez, easily the most
interesting Mission member.</P>
<P>The only survivors are Cruise and Emmanuelle Beart ("Manon Of The Spring"), an
actress of skill but in a fairly worthless role here. The spy bosses have
known for some time that there was a mole on the team and since Cruise
survived, decide that it is him. Cruise and Beart have to go after the bad
guys while ducking the good guys. Any of this sound familiar?</P>
<P>The film is an action movie disguised as a mystery in the guise of Mission:
Impossible. And not a very good one of any of them. The few action scenes are
physically impossible although well paced. The mystery is easily solved
moments after it is posed. The one remaining M:I character, Jim Phelps (Jon
Voight, originally Peter Graves) has nothing in common with the original. Fans
of the series will not recognize much.</P>
<P>Cruise's boyish appeal complete with trademarked grins doesn't play very well.
Bond he ain't. Besides the disappearing and uncredited Estevez, there are only
two actors with much charisma. Veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave shines in what
is an unusual role in films: an extremely sexual older woman. Oddly cast, big
tough-looking Ving Rhames ("Pulp Fiction") is fascinating as the kind-hearted
but devious computer hacker.</P>
<P>Selling out even at mid-afternoon matinees, the movie has enough explosions to
rake in the big bucks for Paramount and make it a summer blockbuster. If
you're looking for quality though, you might want to save your money.</P>
<P>[This appeared in the 5/25/96 "Bloomington Voice", Bloomington, Indiana.
