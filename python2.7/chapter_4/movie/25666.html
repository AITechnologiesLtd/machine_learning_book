<P>
The most popular comic book characters since the 90's finally make their film 
debut the way you'd pretty
much expect it to be: assemble of familiar characters, a lot of cool 
superpowers and special effects and a
story about saving the world from a really evil villain and his nasty 
henchmen. </P>
<P>Those expecting a lot of action will probably be dissapointed - there isn't a 
whole lot of comic book-style
violence and fighting going on here. Yes, there is a showdown between the 
good guys and the bad guys
but it's unoriginal, poorly directed and predictable. In effort to make a 
film like this appealing to the general
movie-going, non-comic book-reading public, the Hollywood hotshots made it a 
bit too tame. Maybe a
little Joel Schumacher "Batman"-style campiness would have made it more fun. 
A better screenplay would
have helped too, the entire story seems like a big prelude to nothing. </P>
<P>Nevertheless, I'm sure kids will love the movie but it doesn't have that 
certain charm that will appeal to the
kid in us all... not all of us at least. </P>
