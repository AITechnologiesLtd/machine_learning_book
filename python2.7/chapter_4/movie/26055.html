<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<PRE>"Dying is easy, comedy is hard."</PRE>
<P>That's a cliche, to be sure, but it's also true. Much of it comes from the
fact that the act of killing is reasonably straightforward, whereas making
people laugh is considerably more elusive. And, by extension, it's because
while being dead is a pretty objective state (certain metaphysical 
concerns notwithstanding), being funny is a lot more personal and
subjective. What I find absolutely uproarious might be stupid or silly or
just plain boring to somebody else. Sense of humour is as individual as we
are.</P>
<P>As such, I will not really attempt to assess how funny "The Original Kings
Of Comedy" is. I will merely indicate that I didn't find it at all 
amusing. Certainly, there were moments which elicited a few chuckles, but
I spent most of the film's nearly two-hour duration sitting in my seat
slack-jawed, wondering what I was missing. Because not only does the
audience in the movie clearly love the act (it'd be a curious concert film
otherwise!) but many others at the screening I attended got a kick out of
it too. So the humour in the picture clearly has an appeal -- just not for
me.</P>
<P>All that said, though, there are aspects of "The Original Kings Of Comedy"
which are candidates for discussion and which are not quite so subjective
as the quality (or lack thereof) of its humour. It is in many ways a very
flawed undertaking and while those who appreciate its brand of comedy may
be able to overlook this, it makes the experience all the more intolerable
for those who do not.</P>
<P>"The Original Kings Of Comedy" is spliced together by director Spike Lee 
from two performances in Charlotte, on February 26th and 27th of this
year. The show consists of four respected (if not exactly famous) black
comedians plying their trade. DL Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and 
Bernie Mac are presented in single individual segments running about 
thirty minutes each. Introducing each act is Steve Harvey, which is to
basically say that Harvey gets three separate ten-minute blocks of stage
time to put on his act instead of an unbroken half hour like the others.
The picture is also peppered with brief behind-the-scenes clips which add
little to the proceedings as a whole.</P>
<P>The film's major problem is the sheer lack of variety amongst the four
comedians, virtually all of whose humour runs along similar lines. All
four indulge in lots of "black people versus white people" commentary
(which is often hilarious, but gets really tedious on its umpteenth
iteration in the span of two hours). All four stay confined to very 
broad-based topics, largely eschewing any political or intellectual
commentary. And all of them lace their monologues with an endless litany
of profanity. Whereas the best comedians know to use swearing to punctuate
their punchlines, here it is often used in place of one: a much lower
brand of humour for sure.</P>
<P>Further, there is little insight offered through the jokes. There is a lot
of racial content, but it mostly consists of potshots at Caucasians and/or
African-Americans. Certainly, we are afforded only the barest of glimpses
into what it is like to be a black man in America. These comedians are
happy to talk about the world around them, but reveal precious little
about themselves in the process. Most of the comedy is of sitcom variety,
and while this is fine in half-hour doses on prime time television, it
feels like an opportunity wasted in a major motion picture.</P>
<P>The comedian who comes closest to achieving some sort of relevance with
his segment is Bernie Mac, who discusses the effects of his sister's drug
habit on his family (he is now sharing custody of her three children with
his brother-in-law). Unfortunately, Mac couches this portion of his 
monologue in exceedingly unpleasant jokes, constantly referring to his six
year-old nephew as a "faggot" and talking about physically beating his own
child. Mac's brand of humor is extremely edgy, maybe too much so; it makes
for an uncomfortable performance which straddles the line between comedy
and cruelty and, perhaps, goes a little too far.</P>
<P>Mac's half hour also illustrates the restrictions imposed by recording
the film in a live environment. Mac has a thick accent (as does Cedric, to
a lesser extent), and I found that the concert's sound facilities --
obviously a poor comparison with anything that would be taped in a studio
-- often distorted his words to the point of unintelligibility. Lee is
also occasionally forced to choose some rather poor camera angles, though
in general he does a good job of setting things up to capture the 
performers at the best possible angles.</P>
<P>Of the four comedians, I found Harvey's material the best. This may have
been aided by the fact that, alone amongst the quartet, his screentime
is split up, so that he does not overstay his welcome. Intriguingly,
Harvey's best material comes when he is adlibbing to the audience. For
example, when a Rastafarian-looking man in the front row tells him that
he's doing computer technology education, Harvey retorts that the last two
words that come to his mind when he looks at the man are "technology"...
or "education". He also has a few amusing rehearsed skits, like one about
black people on the "Titanic".</P>
<P>But good gags like this are few and far between. I found "The Original
Kings Of Comedy" to be an unpleasant morass, a sterile waste of a long two
hours. Maybe my sense of humour just isn't geared in the right way. Maybe
I'm not the demographic that the "Kings" are appealing to. I guess much
the same reaction would be had if Newfoundland's comedy troupe Buddy
Wassisname and the Other Fellers were dropped off in the South Bronx to do
a show. If you understand the reference, I expect you'll see the point. If
you don't understand the reference... well, maybe that makes the point,
too.</P>
