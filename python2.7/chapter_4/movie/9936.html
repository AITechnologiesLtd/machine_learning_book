<PRE>                              SWINGERS 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                       2 :-) :-)  for finding love</PRE>
<P>In this tale about human mating rituals, we have the scenario of a down
and out comedian in L.A. who has recently been dumped by his long time
lover and is wallowing with depression. His juvenile friends, despite
being childish and irresponsible attempt to cheer him up by getting him
up and out to mingle with society. This is a good idea, but becomes
annoying when they give him mostly wrong advice. Advice like you can't
call someone out for a date until 2 days post first meeting. Leaving it
for several weeks is a better option. Or you need to look cool, be
slightly arrogant and throw money about for people to notice you.</P>
<P>Yes, people will start noticing you, all the wrong sorts. For this
lonely, otherwise pleasant young man he seems to be searching for the
right woman in all the wrong places i.e. bars, night clubs etc. Places
conducive for sex, drugs and alcohol but not ideal for a generating a
more lasting union. So night after night he searches for true love,
toddling behind his high ‘swinging' friends whose main intent is to get
laid, whilst he is searching for a more meaningful relationship. My
advice to him is to look for love elsewhere. He stands a better chance
of finding a prospective partner who hasn't slept with all his friends
and a hundred different people let's say at a church picnic. The crowd
that haunts the night scene is also a festering pool of crime, suicide
and sexually transmitted diseases waiting to happen. When one gets older
this lifestyle loses its charm because it is based on youth, good looks
and vitality. When these virtues disappear it becomes evident how
‘rootless' this way of life truly is.</P>
<P>This movie makes a good study about the evolving rituals of courting in
late 20th century males. Where the subject matter, a man in his twenties
unexpectedly finds love in a bar. He takes a chance by not following the
usual conventions described to him by his friends. It also makes a good
study on resisting peer group pressure and making your own stance and
decisions in life. I was very proud of him when he actually decided not
to force himself on the girl after their first meeting, and remained a
gentleman throughout the encounter. This is a movie I started out hating
because of all the misconceived notions it suggests about courting, but
ended up liking because it declared how wrong these notions were.</P>
