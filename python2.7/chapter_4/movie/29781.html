<PRE>Zoolander – In Need of a New Look 
by Homer Yen 
(c) 2001 </PRE>
<P>"Zoolander" is a little comedy that says to itself, "I 
think I can – I think I can."  But try as it might, it 
never quite makes it over that hill. </P>
<P>While trailers make it seem like a spy flick parody, 
"Zoolander" is practically the opposite of Austin 
Powers.  AP is a shagadelic, bespectacled spy that 
touches the world of fashion.  Ben Stiller's 
"Zoolander" is a fashion model that touches the world 
of spy.  Apparently, there is a subtle conspiracy 
taking shape in the world of fashion.  Male models are 
being groomed to become lethal assassins.  Why?  Male 
models are in top physical condition, they can gain 
access into the most secure areas, and they always do 
what they're told to do.  "That's not true," protests 
our dim hero.  "Yes it is," replies a shadowy figure! 
"Oh, ok," says Zoolander, cowering in agreement. </P>
<P>That's pretty much the heart and soul of this film, a 
sputtering satire of the fashion industry and the 
dim-witted milksops that inhabit it.  It's funniest 
aspect pokes fun at the extreme vanity and intense 
competition among the top models.  Hansel (Owen 
Wilson) is an up-and-coming rookie that threatens 
Zoolander's dominance.  Clearly, this new threat riles 
the vain veteran.  It eventually leads to a 
challenge/walk-off in which these two get to strut 
their best and funniest stuff down a runway.  Another 
funny segment involved an aging hand model whose hand 
was encased in a hyperbarbic chamber. </P>
<P>Regardless of the way Zoolander moves down the catwalk 
or the sighs from women when he purses his lips and 
flashes his patented 'blue steel' pose, he is 
gloriously empty-headed.  The cure for any of his 
problems is a cup of orange mocha frapaccino and an 
impromptu water fight.  </P>
<P>His general state of ineptitude catches the eye of 
evil fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell).  Our 
villain is facing a crisis in Malaysia where the newly 
elected leader has promised sweeping labor reform. 
Without the cheap labor that Mugatu has been 
exploiting, his already-pricey fashions will 
skyrocket.  He will need to kill the leader and will 
'recruit' Zoolander to do the deed.  Ferrell is the 
life of this party and obviously enjoys hamming it up 
for a laugh. </P>
<P>Stiller also displays convincing enthusiasm for his 
work (so much so, that his character could have been 
called Zealander).  Yet despite the concerted efforts 
of everyone, the gags and the overall silliness wears 
out faster than last season's fashions.  "Zoolander" 
just doesn't have enough going for it beyond the 
dumb-as-nails/narcissism angle.  In fact, the entire 
essence of the film is captured in those Heineken beer 
commercials. </P>
<P>Did you ever notice that when a company tries to 
promote a product, it uses stars as testimonials? 
That seems to be what's happening here.  Cover models 
Christine Taylor and Milla Jovovich have supporting 
roles while a host of Hollywood medium-weights show up 
in cameo roles.  And, as this is a VH1 production, 
they would be remiss in excluding trendy rockers like 
Lenny Kravitz and David Bowie.  Well, you have to give 
them credit for really trying.  But perhaps Frankie 
Goes to Hollywood said it best when they sang, "Relax, 
Don't Do It." </P>
