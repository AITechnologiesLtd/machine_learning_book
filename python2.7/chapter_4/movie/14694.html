<PRE>PLEASANTVILLE (New Line)
Directed by Gary Ross</PRE>
<P>        Back in the mid-1960s, my uncle worked for RCA and managed to get my
family a deal on what was then a state-of-the-art color TV. When we had
"company" over, there were always a few people who insisted on looking at
the set; my sisters and I used to giggle everytime the NBC peacock would
spread its rainbow-hued tail across the screen and prompt amazed gasps from
our guests. What was the big deal? we wondered.</P>
<P> It's been a long time since anyone made much of a fuss over seeing
colors, but writer-director Gary Ross' "Pleasantville" might change that.
This ambitious, multi-layered movie can be read in a number of different
ways: as a charmingly eccentric fish-out-of-water comedy; as a parable about
the time when the cheerful conformity of the 1950s gave way to the "do your
own thing" vibes of the 1960s; as a rich "Wizard of Oz"-style fairy tale. Or
you can simply choose to appreciate it as a truly rewarding piece of
escapist entertainment. Regardless of how you choose to see "Pleasantville,"
this smart, funny, visually dazzling film is the kind of moviegoing
experience you're unlikely to forget.</P>
<P> Putting a modern fable onscreen is extraordinarily difficult, the
kind of assignment that's perplexed even veteran directors such as Steven
Spielberg (in the charmless "Hook") and Barry Levinson (whose ghastly "Toys"
was a box office disaster), and though Ross' delightfully clever scripts for
"Big" and "Dave" were both Oscar-nominated he did not direct either film.
For a first film, "Pleasantville" is remarkably smooth without seeming
slick, and crucial tonal transitions in the story that could easily have
proven forced instead seem effortlessly natural.</P>
<P> What sets Ross' work apart from that of most fledgling directors is
its focus; not only does he know exactly what he wants each scene to say, he
understands how to best get his points across. "Pleasantville" teems with
allusions to the Bible (a burning bush, a radiant red apple), references to
vintage TV ("Andy Griffith Show" star Don Knotts plays the character who
sets the tale in motion) and parallels to historical events, including
Hitler's rise to power and the Krystalnacht he ordered in 1938. It all
sounds far too heavy and portentous to be easily incorporated into what's
essentially a story about contemporary teen twins David (Tobey Maguire) and
Jen (Reese Witherspoon) trapped in the black-and-white confines of an eerily
wholesome 1950s series called "Pleasantville," but against considerable odds
all these diverse elements come together splendidly in the course of two
hours.</P>
<P> For the socially awkward David, a chance to live among placcid,
predictable people is a dream come true, especially since he's a
"Pleasantville" fanatic and knows all the intricacies of such episodes as
"Trouble at the Barber Shop" and "Bud Gets A Job." For Jen, who prides
herself on being sexually adventurous and grimly anti-intellectual, the
prospect of mingling with the compulsively cheerful and resolutely
celibate -- even married couples sleep in separate single beds --
Pleasantvilleans looks like an opportunity to make some major alterations in
this insular little hamlet. To paraphrase the Talking Heads, Pleasantville
is a place where nothing ever happens; when these outsiders disrupt the
monotony, the results terrify some residents and liberate everyone else.</P>
<P> The dissention even spreads to David and Jen's hollowly happy home
away from home, where their bland dad George (William H. Macy) is unnerved
by the abrupt changes in mom Betty (Joan Allen), who's no longer always
around when it's time to serve the pineapple kabobs to guests, or to prepare
copious amounts of biscuits, pancakes, bacon and hamsteak for each morning's
breakfast; she'd rather hang out with a soda shop owner (Jeff Daniels) who
dreams of becoming an artist. Bob (J.T. Walsh), Pleasantville's mayor, frets
over such new developments in town as workers who decide to walk off their
mundane jobs in search of more rewarding careers and teens who have suddenly
taken to splitting their time between the library and Lovers Lane. Once
intellectual and hormonal passions have been aroused, there's no turning
back, and the mundane grays of Pleasantville slowly begin to give way to
vivid living color.</P>
<P> The staggeringly beautiful scenes that depict this transformation
were created by visual effects supervisor Chris Watts and scores of
assistants. But breathtaking as it is, the technical wizardry would be
pointless were it not for the movie's emotional content and resonant
performances by the entire cast; these are the things that elevate
"Pleasantville" out of the realm of pure fantasy and into the category of
human drama. Beyond the digitally composed imagery is a haunting, deeply
affecting story about learning to love, fulfilling your potential and
refusing to be bound by conventionality.</P>
<P> "Your senses will never be the same" was the tagline used to
promote the splashy, thunderingly loud 1975 film of the Who's "Tommy." But
that slogan could just as easily be applied to "Pleasantville," a brilliant
"art-film" in the very best sense of the term and one that -- for a while
anyway -- may well change the way you look at the world.
