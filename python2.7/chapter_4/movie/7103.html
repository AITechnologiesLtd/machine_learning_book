<PRE>                             JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>This live comedy is one the kids will love.  Adults should take a grain
of salt along but, hey, if you are looking for a movie that will make
the young ones stay in their seats because they won't want to miss a
moment of what is happening on the screen, you have come to the right
place.</P>
<P>JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE  has all the elements found in a movie for children.
It has comedy, including of course the slapstick variety.  It also has
the exotic flavor of  a 14-year-old boy who is more at home in an
Amazon jungle than he is in the rat race of the big city where his
father lives. And there is even a touch of puppy love (but no puppies),
with pretty Karen (LeeLee Sobieski.)</P>
<P>Michael (Tim Allen)  is the boy's father.  Allen  is no newcomer to
Disney films as he starred in The Santa Clause and in Toy Story where
he was the voice of Buzz Lightyear.  On TV, Allen has many credits and
is  probably best known for HOME IMPROVEMENT.</P>
<P>Michael would like to marry Charlotte (who wouldn't?) (Lolita
Davidovich) but before he can do that he has to get divorced from his
current wife, Patricia (JoBeth Williams).  So Michael hops a plane to
the Amazon jungle where Patricia, a doctor, is currently working.
Imagine his surprise when he discovers that a 14-year-old boy, with the
adorable name of Mimi-Siku (Sam Huntington)  who wears a headband and a
native "skirt" is his son he never knew he had.  Patricia had neglected
to tell him she was pregnant when they separated.</P>
<P>Michael decides to take Mimi-Siku back to New York City and that is
when things begin to roll as Mimi-Siku does not readily adapt to his
new surroundings.  At this point the comedy shifts into high gear.</P>
<P>Helping to make the film a children's delight are Martin Short, David
Ogden Stiers, Bob Dishy and Valerie Mahaffey as well as others.</P>
<PRE>Directed by John Pasquin.</PRE>
