<PRE>SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        For a big-budget studio film, there are a lot of art house
pretensions in Scott Hicks' "Snow Falling on Cedars."  Artistic shots of
young lovers catching raindrops on their tongues in the bowels of a tree,
or making out behind dimpled glass.  A non-linear narrative structure so
complex that you could be excused for thinking the lead character (played
by Ethan Hawke) actually stumbles across himself washed up on a beach, many
years older and ravaged by war.  An intricate, distracting soundtrack abuzz
with overlapping dialogue, babies wailing, wind and rain beating down on an
old creaky courthouse, all set to strings that swell and swell some more.</P>
<PRE>        And snow.  Lots of it, some of which falls on timbers.</PRE>
<P>        Fans of David Guterson's best-selling novel will probably wish that
Hicks, the director of "Shine," would just shut up and get on with the
story.</P>
<P>        That story is a post-World War II courtroom drama cum love story
set in the high country of Washington state where the cedars touch the sky
and everything is blue and gray (except for the occasional red of the
women's lipstick).  The courtroom drama results from the death of a local
fisherman and the accusation of a Japanese landowner for his murder.  The
love story is one from the past: how a local reporter named Ishmael
Chambers (Hawke) once loved the accused man's wife (Youki Kudoh).  This all
transpires in a time and a place when anti-Japanese sentiment was at its
zenith.</P>
<P>        Earnest, handsomely mounted, and empty, "Snow Falling on Cedars"
takes a difficult chapter in this nation's history--how the United States
interred thousands of Japanese-Americans in concentration camps following
Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor--and forsakes a lot of hard questions in the
process.  Max von Sydow's defense attorney does, however, deliver a darned
good closing argument as this two-hour film draws to a close.  Hicks knows
it, and doesn't cut or pull back for a second.</P>
<P>        It's a rare moment of truth in a film that exploits its cinematic
strengths--exquisite photography, manipulative music, and a fractured
narrative style--at the expense of honest storytelling.  Von Sydow is
magnificent in this scene.  Magnificence, alas, is a quality that "Snow
Falling on Cedars" strives, yet fails, to achieve.</P>
