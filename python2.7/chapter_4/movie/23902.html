<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>In recent years the animation genre has greatly improved. Computers are leading
the way into a new dimension of thinking about animation. Witness the deep,
luscious jungles of Tarzan, or the amazing computer work in Toy Story 2. There
have also been animated films aimed at adults (like Antz, Princess Mononoke,
and South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut) that have seen success at the box
office. But for every Iron Giant, there must be a Pokemon: The First Movie.
While the images of The Road To El Dorado are beautiful, it's missing what an
animated kids movie needs most: A good story, humor, and memorable characters.
This movie is most likely to quickly fade away, just like the golden sun of the
city.</P>
<P>It's 16th century Spain, and Miguel (Branagh) and Tulio (Kline) are con men
trying to escape from Pamplona city guards. They stow away on a ship with the
mighty Cortez and are washed up on the island where El Dorado is. The two
journey through the forests and jungles until they reach the magical place. It
is marvelous indeed. Gold lines everything in sight, the two are in heaven. Due
to several natural occurrences and misunderstandings, the two men are mistaken
as gods and are worshipped by all of the people. They are hailed with gold and
riches, if they keep this up, who knows how much gold they could rack up? The
two decide to stay for several days,  rack up all the gold they can, and head
back to Spain. Soon sexy villager Chel (Perez) is also in on the con game. A
crazy priest (Assante) who believes that the gods deserve sacrifices also comes
into the picture, he's just one of the many badly motivated people in this
film, which is littered with potential bad guys. All of this builds up to a
predictable and inevitable conclusion.</P>
<P>The major rave I can give to the movie is the astounding animation. The hues
are vibrant and exciting, they really bring this movie to life. It's too bad
there wasn't a decent story to back this thing up. I found no real interest in
the two main characters, or their situation throughout the entire movie. Miguel
and Tulio have little chemistry or appeal and the most interesting character (a
horse with human emotions and no lines) kept catching my interest rather than
the human characters. Character and plot structure are so lackluster that, if
not for the bright colors, I could have easily fallen asleep amid the boring
middle of the film. I think the real clincher for me on this movie would be the
songs. They are so out of place and so easily forgettable that while trying to
recollect a single lyric from any one of them after the movie, I came up with
nothing. This is really a disappointment, considering the songs were written by
Tim Rice and Elton John who did marvelous work on The Lion King. The theme may
also worry some parents, the two leads lie, cheat, and steal...and usually get
away with it.</P>
<P>My only theory as to the creation of this film was that Jeffrey Katzenberg is
trying to prove to Disney that Dreamworks has just the same amount of
technology behind their animation studios as the mouse ears do. But Disney
films (and others like The Iron Giant) know that in order for a family animated
movie to be good, it must capture the imaginations of children and maybe even
some of the adults who accompany them. There is little sign of this here, the
visuals are there, but the inspiration, and sense of wonder are lacking. The
Road is rocky and unpaved, and certainly not filled with gold.</P>
