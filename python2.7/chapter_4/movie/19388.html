Running time: 87 minutes.</P>
<P>Over the past decade, John Waters seems to have adopted a more
mainstream ethos with his decidedly off beat comedies that satirise
certain elements of contemporary culture (Hairspray, Cry Baby and
Serial Mom).  However, Baltimore's most notorious cult film maker has
still not lost his flair for tasteless and tacky observations about
human nature.  Those more familiar with Waters' past work will
probably not be surprised that the director seems to have mellowed
with age and experience.  Nor will they be overly surprised at the
almost uncharacteristic restraint shown in Pecker.  Although Pecker is
nowhere near as outrageous as his earlier films (Pink Flamingos, etc),
there are still many moments in this clever and quite funny film that
will shock or upset some elements within the audience.</P>
<P>One of Waters' better and more accessible films, Pecker is a
dry, witty and deliciously off beat take on the nature of celebrity,
which often comes at a high price.  This is territory that has been
explored recently by Woody Allen (Celebrity) and Ron Howard (Edtv),
but Waters gives us his own idiosyncratic take on the issue. The film
also pricks the pretensions of the sycophantic art world and New York
(although sometimes the two are synonymous).  Waters also takes a
gentle swipe at the narrow minded attitudes and hypocrisy of the
working class in insular, small town America.</P>
<P>Pecker primarily traces the loss of innocence of its eponymous
hero, played with a wonderful combination of appeal and naiveté by
T2's Edward Furlong.  Eighteen year old Pecker is an amateur
photographer who snaps candid shots of the residents of his hometown
of Hampden.  When he arranges a small exhibition inside the sandwich
shop where he works, Pecker's life changes.  He is discovered by Rorey
(Lily Taylor, from I Shot Andy Warhol, etc), a voracious New York
dealer who quickly transforms him into the next big thing in the art
world.</P>
<P>But as fame and potential fortune are Pecker's for the taking,
he finds that the unwelcome spotlight of media attention also falls on
his culturally challenged family as well as his friends.  His
girlfriend Shelley (beautifully played by teen indy queen Christina
Ricci, in a role originally intended for Ricki Lake), who officiously
runs the town's laundromat, finds herself alienated from Pecker and
his sudden fame.  His kleptomaniac best friend Matt (played with
enthusiasm by Brendon Sexton III, from Hurricane Streets, etc) also
finds his lifestyle altered as he is unable to enter those stores
where he practised his "five fingered discounts."</P>
<P>Even the townsfolk of Hampden turn on the gay subculture and
the sleazier elements that they had reluctantly tolerated for years,
until they were thrust into the public spotlight through Pecker's
pictures.  Pecker is faced with the choice of pursuing his art at all
costs or returning to the unassuming small town amateur he once was.</P>
<P>Waters traces Pecker's getting of wisdom with a raunchy humour
and a real affection for the character.  He obviously identifies
strongly with Pecker, and Furlong's sympathetic portrayal also endears
him to the audience.  The ensemble cast all deliver solid performances
and bring to life Waters' wonderfully colourful gallery of eccentric
characters.</P>
