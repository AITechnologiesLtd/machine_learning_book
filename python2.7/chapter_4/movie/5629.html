<PRE>                          TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1969) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        It's the Woody and Clyde story in Woody Allen's first 
outing as writer, director and star. In this mock documentary 
satirizing the crime films of the 30's (and of course 1967's BONNIE 
AND CLYDE), Woody plays the most inept criminal on the planet, 
the kind of guy who robs a bank by giving the teller a letter reading, 
"I am pointing a gun at you." But the teller thinks it says "gub" and 
calls over another teller to get a second opinion. Finally Woody is 
sent to the manager's office because the teller can't hand out money 
without written authorization. By the time Woody realizes what's 
going on, the cops are there.</P>
<P>        That's the kind of movie TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN is, 
so wacky it's surreal. A lot of the other early Allen films had that 
kind of feel to them, movies like BANANAS and SLEEPER. Those 
were both twice as funny as TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN, which 
has at least one failed gag for every successful one. The movie 
begins with an early biography of Allen's character, explaining 
that he took up a life of crime to pay for cello lessons.</P>
<P>        There's a shot of Woody playing the cello in a marching 
band -- sitting in a chair and playing for a few seconds, then 
running to catch up with the rest of the band and sitting back in 
his chair (one of the gags that works) -- followed by a comment 
from his embarrassed parents, so embarrassed that they are wearing 
Groucho moustaches to disguise themselves (one that doesn't) 
that Woody didn't know how to play the cello at all. He blew into 
it (works). The movie alternates between the ones that are funny 
and that aren't while always being watchable.</P>
<P>        So he's carted off to jail, something he narrowly avoided 
a few years back. (You've heard of the women-in-prison movie 
genre -- here's the Woody-in-prison movie.) As always, there are 
opportunities aplenty for jokes, both verbal and visual, mixed 
together expertly like only he can. One minute Woody's telling 
the prison psychiatrist an ink blot looks like "two elephants making 
love... to a men's glee club" and the next he's escaping prison using 
a bar of soap carved into a gun, until it starts raining and his gun 
turns into soap suds.</P>
<P>        It wouldn't be a Woody Allen movie if he didn't work 
romance in somehow. Woody meets a girl (Janet Margolin) on a 
park bench and narrates, "After fifteen minutes I was completely 
in love with her. And after thirty I had completely given up the idea 
of stealing her purse." If only we could all experience such bliss, 
but even Woody has problems when he ends up in jail again, on 
a chain gang this time. The man is a genius for manufacturing 
premises that lead to a variety of joke-producing situations, 
although this movie has its share of classic moments, that 
genius isn't as fully developed in TAKE THE MONEY AND 
RUN as his comedies of the early 70's.</P>
