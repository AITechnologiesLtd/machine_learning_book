<PRE>                                    DAMAGE
                                  [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Grant Heinrich
                        Copyright 1993 Grant Heinrich</PRE>
<P>Directed Louis Malle.
Stars Jeremy Irons, Juliette Binoche (Teresa in THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS
      OF BEING).</P>
<P>     Irons and Binoche play two aliens stranded on earth in human form 
and only able to communicate through involved eyebrow wiggling and 
insertion without foreplay.  Irons is a wacky English MP.  Bincohe 
reprises her role from THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING, only this time
without the benfit of good scripting--certainly, Damage allows no room
for anything resembling characterisation or, indeed, any form of acting 
whatsoever beyond stoicism and the occasional smirk during orgasm.</P>
<PRE>Spoilers:</PRE>
<P>     Here's the plot:  Irons is a talented actor who picked a bad
script.  Dressed as an well-toned MP, he drags Binoche around France and
Britan, looking for some place more uncomfortable than the last to fuck.
Binoche is his son's girlfriend.  The rest is easily filled in: the
octopus position, the half-nelson with triple pike position, the losing
control of a two-wheel scooter because of an inexplicable manifestation
of  Cthulu position.</P>
<P>     Since it's impolite to giggle in the cinema (even when everyone
else does), wait for the video.  Personally, I enjoyed Damage, but I'm
a big fan of the badly-executed highbrow wanking flick.  Well, not a
fan.  Not really.  But I seem to see a lot of the things.</P>
<P>     Good points: the first ten minutes.  The last half hour works.  
The closing music is stirring.  The actress playing Binoche's mother 
has a grey stripe through her hair; she looks and sounds like a Python 
character--doesn't suit the movie, but she's fun to watch.</P>
<P>     Winnner: the 1993 "Close my Eyes" award for sexual banality.  This
award is named for the '92 film, notable for trite dialogue, inept
direction and anatomical correctness.</P>
<PRE>Avoid.</PRE>
