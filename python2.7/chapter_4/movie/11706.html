<P>  Toward the end of this picture, Cynthia (Mara
Hobel), a young, would-be journalist who is rooming
in Greenwich Village with recent college graduates,
has a breakdown.  "I want to go home," she wails--
which is no wonder considering that her parents live in
Long Island palatial splendor while she walks up half
a dozen flights of stairs.  Now, there's nothing wrong
with "Broadway Damage" that an adjustment in timing
could not fix.  Simply have Cynthia articulate her
magic words at the very beginning, send her packing,
and concentrate for the next 100 minutes on the other
characters.  "Broadway Bound" is not likely to be
considered even by its writer-director, Victor Mignati, to be a
major offering, but without its lead female it might
have redeeming albeit modest virtues.  But the obese Ms.
Hobel, who hardly has a smidgen of the comic sensibility of a
Bette Midler, a Chuck Farley or a Roseanne, is difficult to
watch, given her charmlessness and the character she
portrays--a shopaholic sponging on her daddy's credit cards
who is apparently too exalted to do wash her own dishes. 
Though some of her problems are resolved during the course
of the story, a typical patron in the audience could hardly
care.</P>
<P>   Might we care about the others in the cast?  Perhaps.  But
Marc (Michael Shawn Lucas), Robert (Aaron Williams) and
David (Hugh Panaro) are too wet behind the ears, too lacking
in mature qualities at this stage of their lives to warrant
concern or empathy--though, heaven knows, no critic can
speak for all or even necessarily a large segment of the
audience.</P>
<P>   This sentimental little romantic comedy could have been
inspired by that mushy song, "The Boy Next Door"-- from
Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane's song for the 1960 musical
"Meet Me in St. Louis," the first two lines of which is "How
Can I Ignore/ The Boy Next Door."  The handsome, struggling
actor Marc seeks stable lovers everywhere but in his own
apartment, drooling over David, the musician he spots in the
flat just below his.  Little does he realize that his own
roommate Robert, a writer of musical comedy tunes, is ga ga
for him, but is simply too shy to confess his love.  Oh, yes,
"Broadway Damage" is of the gay genre, featuring a few "in"
jokes which, judging by a recent critics' screening, just might
be appreciated by one portion of its audience while unlikely to
possess crossover appeal.</P>
<P>   Director Magnatti's cameraman, Michael Mayers, takes his
camera inside an actual building in Greenwich Village and to
various areas around Manhattan including Central Park, the
blocks surrounding the Empire State Building, Bloomingdale's,
and other on-site areas exploiting 16mm lensing. And while
it's good to see the Big Apple increasingly used as locales by
the movie industry, it's sad to report that this trivial story is
lacking in genuine humor, wit and originality.  Marc meets
David, is disappointed, takes a couple of auditions, is
discouraged.  Cynthia seeks an interview with high-profile
magazine editor Tina Brown, is disheartened when her calls
are not returned, continues to bomb Ms. Brown's office with
resumes and ultimately a catchy collage, is dismayed.  David
has a relationship with Chuck (Jonathan Walker), the
relationship goes awry, he's discouraged, he can't pay the
rent, he becomes downright melancholy.  What this means in
the tradition of formulaic writing is: Resolution is on its way.</P>
<P>   When you consider that Marc is an actor and Robert a
writer of musical comedies, you might be surprised that the
Broadway of the title is woefully underutilized, coming to the
fore in spots, as when Marc auditions, and even here,
unconvincingly.  Not Rated.  Running time: 109 minutes.  (C)
