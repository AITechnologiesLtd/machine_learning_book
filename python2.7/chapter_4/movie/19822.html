<P>There was a time when films like JAWS and THE SHINING (9/10) scared the
beejesus out of us. Nowadays, special effects have taken over the movie
industry and Hollyland expects us to be thrilled by computer-generated
houses and sharks. THE HAUNTING (4/10) failed miserably at this task, DEEP
BLUE SEA on the other hand, chewed right into it and bit off my thumb up!</P>
<P>PLOT:
A team of research scientists genetically toy with sharks in order to find a
cure for the human disorder of Alzheimer. When things go awry, the sharks
get smarter, angrier and stronger. They also want to chew up those damn
humans!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
In my mind, the definition of a "fun summer popcorn flick" has something to
do with turning off your brain at the door, enjoying the thrills and chills
of a preposterous yet interesting situation, laughing, biting your
fingernails, and having a blast, whilst digging into your preferred snack de
la jour (Nachos, cheese and salsa for me, thank you very much). If you go
into this movie expecting to find the answers to genetic testing on animals
and its ability to cure human diseases, you will be highly disappointed. If,
on the other hand, you are going into this film expecting to find some
cool-looking sharks chewing on human bodies, one-liners galore, over-the-top
situations which hold you in bated breath, and a motley cast of diverse
characters just waiting to be ripped to bits by these mutated sharks...then
this puppy is definitely the summer movie for you! Think...JAWS on speed.</P>
<P>Unlike THE HAUNTING (4/10), this summer film doesn't rely solely on its
special effects to do the trick. It adds interesting and entertaining
characters, a plausible plot, some nice style, a heart-pounding score and
even some genre-bending surprises here and there. I personally would have
liked to have seen more of those rapid-fire sharks crunching into folk, but
hey, I'm just a guy munching on nachos down here. The plot also doesn't take
long to get going, and once it does, you could expect all kinds of crazy
shark action. The story is obviously not rich in breadth, with a simple
"shark angry-let's get away from the shark" explanation covering the rest of
the film, but director Renny Harlin makes sure that we all have a blast in
the meantime. Actor-wise, it is LL Cool J who steals the show with his
one-liners, with the "Sam Jackson scene" being the most memorable, and the
shark wrangler dude, Thomas Jane, also pulling in a fine performance. If you
can't stomach scenes featuring humans being chewed up by large sharks, well
guess what, stay away from this movie! But if you're looking for mindless
entertainment, with a diverse cast, fun thrills and some super cool sharks,
sharpen your fins and get your ass on over to your nearest multiplex, and
prepare to dive right into this deep blue sea of blood (Okay, okay...no more
puns!).</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
The "L" in Samuel L. Jackson's name stands for Leroy. Sam was an admitted
drug user until he completed drug rehab two weeks before playing a drug
addict in Spike Lee's JUNGLE FEVER. Some may remember him as Stacks Edwards
from Martin Scorsese's 1990 mob flick GOODFELLAS (10/10). He also played the
character of "Black Guy" in the 1989 Al Pacino thriller SEA OF LOVE
(7.5/10). His city of birth is Washington, D.C.
Director Renny Harlin's birth name is Lauri Mauritz Harjola. He was born in
Finland. He stands 6'4" and was married to tall actress Geena Davis for
about four years.
Thomas Jane's (The Shark Wrangler) mom is an antiques dealer and his dad is
a biogenetic-engineer. He has five younger siblings.
In the "wink or you'll miss it category", note that director Renny Harlin
can be seen leaving the seaport facilities with the rest of some folks near
the beginning of the movie. Guess he didn't want to stick around for any of
the carnage, eh?
This film was originally titled TIME OUT.
The first scene of this film could easily be interpreted as an homage to the
JAWS films.</P>
