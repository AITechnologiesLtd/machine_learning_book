<PRE>                      HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>** (out of 4 = fair)
1992, PG, 120 minutes [2 hours]
[comedy]
starring: Macauly Culkin (Kevin MaCallister), Joe Pesci (Harry), Daniel Stern
(Marv), Brenda Fricker (The Pigeon Lady), written and produced by John
Hughes, directed by Chris Columbus.</P>
<P>The idea of a small boy somehow separated from his family at Christmas, and
then proceeding to befriend a misunderstood person, outsmart adults, and
torture criminals in a cartoonish style is an idea that can (and should) be
used once. "Home Alone 2: Lost In New York" is such a retread of the original
it is one of the most predictable films I've ever seen. This story tries a
too hard to be a lighthearted family movie and thus becomes very corny and
sappy.</P>
<P>The film basically starts out the same as the first one, with the house full
of people running all over the place, preparing for a family Christmas
vacation in Florida. We get a lot of the same jokes with Kevin (Culkin) being
dumped on and his mischievous antics, most of them provided by his Talkboy
tape recorder (one of the most blatant plugs I've ever seen). </P>
<P>The funniest moment occurs near the beginning when Buzz, (Devin Ratray)
Kevin's oldest brother, embarrasses him during his solo at a Christmas
pageant, to which Kevin retaliates by punching him which causes a domino
effect knocking the entire 100-kid choir off the stage. Perhaps this is just
foreshadowing the jokes to come; lots of slapstick we've seen before that
don't often work.</P>
<P>Through a series of cartoony coincidences and cliches, Kevin ends up on the
wrong plane bound for New York City while the rest of the family heads to
Orlando. But he is even more clever this time and proceeds to check himself
into the Plaza Hotel.</P>
<P>Most of the film is plotless, it is just the adventures of Kevin alone in
New York with a lot of money (he had his father's wallet with him) and a wild
imagination. The problem is it's just too dumbed down, and that's saying
something compared to the original.</P>
<P>Those idiot criminals Harry and Marv (Pesci, Stern) are back, and proceed to
run into Kevin again (and again...). They are planning to rob a toy store,
and tell him all the details, which of course he captures on tape. In fact,
the Talkboy plays act as as an important source for plot and jokes. It allows
Kevin to constantly fool people, but I found it impossible to believe no one
realizes what they are hearing is a tape.</P>
<P>Of course there is the token scene where Kevin and his house of tricks (this
time his uncle's abandoned for renovation townhouse) nearly kill Harry and
Marv, but that's the entire premise of making and watching these films. I
found myself laughing, but only a little bit. After a while the slapstick
seemed just too painful and too fake to watch.</P>
<P>"Home Alone 2" doesn't work as a comedy, although I'm sure kids will like
it. From beginning to end it is filled with cliches and complete retreads of
all the jokes that worked in the original. Incredible coincidences and
outrageous slapstick comedy are devices that can only work once (if at all),
but Hollywood thrives on sequels. </P>
