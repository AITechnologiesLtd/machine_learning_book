<P>Earlier in my many diatribes about the world of celluloid, I have described
my paradigm for grading a film.  The more fodder to which it provides me in
the form of raw insults, one-liners, and pot shots that need to be taken,
then a critic's level of verbosity is directly related to the cinematic
quality of the film.  The higher up the quality ladder a film goes, the more
a critic is forced to resort to oftentimes clichéd praises, such as `great
acting' or the ever-dreadful `best film of the year.'  High enough up into
the quality stratosphere, and the greatest of films initially provide almost
no response.  They're pondered over.  Introductory paragraphs are mulled
over for hours, and philosophical diatribes that earn us insults such as
`elitist prick' ensue.</P>
<P>In case you haven't yet caught on by the ironic tone of that BS introductory
paragraph, I really liked The Doom Generation.  In fact, it was good enough
that the initial response provoked was a sensory overload, and a mere two
words escaping my lips: `Fucked up.'  In the two years since initially
watching this masterpiece of perversion and post-apocalyptical philosophy, I
have come up with other descriptors.  Ironic.  Incredible.  Intelligent.
Sardonic.  Satirical.  Irreverent.  Beautiful.  Homoerotic.  Pensive.  In
fact, this is one of those movies where I can make up an adjective for each
letter of the alphabet to describe The Doom Generation.</P>
<P>Sadly, two of those adjectives happen to be `subversive' and `underground,'
resulting in a generalized lack of awareness as to what The Doom Generation
is.</P>
<P>The Doom Generation, put as simply as possible, is a near-apocalyptic
joyride through the netherworld of Los Angeles that takes pot shots on all
that America considers Holy… and makes any ardent lover of cult films want
to bow to director Gregg Araki's greatness.</P>
<P>It starts off at a techno party in the land of wherever, LA, America.
Lights flash, Nine Inch Nails blares, and we are greeted with a title card
that says `A Completely Heterosexual Movie by Gregg Araki.'  Then Amy Blue
(Rose McGowan, whose largest parts have been the female lead in Jawbreaker
and playing Tatum in Scream) says, `fuck.'  Like everyone else in LA, she's
in post-riot mode.  Confused, thinking the end time is nigh but not wanting
to put it into religious terminology, and in a quasi-steady relationship
with Jordan White (James Duval).  Having gone out for a really long time (a
month), Blue and White are about to consummate their relationship in a
really cheap car when Xavier Red (Johnathon Schaech) gets into a fight right
outside, begins stabbing people, and ends up being let inside of their car.
Red, White, and Blue grab a hotel room for the night, Amy keeps being
mistaken for everyone's former girlfriend, and Red and White keep sleeping
with Blue as a way to deal with their homoerotic potential.</P>
<P>If you think it's crazy now, wait until the end of the movie.</P>
<P>One of the few films where complete and utter absurdity doesn't hurt the
plot, The Doom Generation careens down LA freeways with the top down and its
middle finger extended.  If you're able to stand a film that knows no
boundaries, then The Doom Generation is for you.  You will find pearl after
pearl of anarchistic wisdom within Gregg Araki's vision, and laugh after
laugh at the prevalence of bizarre experiences (and the number 666).  But if
you're a conservative who has somehow made it past my mentions of gay sex,
satanic imagery, metal, and a satirizing of American values, than by all
means stay away.  Lock up your children.  Find out if any relatives of Joe
McCarthy are currently in the Senate.  Otherwise, enjoy.</P>
