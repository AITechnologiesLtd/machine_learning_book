<PRE> "That's it, we're finished, we're over!"
"Why?"
"You had sex with Jiff!"
"So?"
"Well I never thought of it that way."</PRE>
<P>Starring Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Heather Graham, Christine Baranski,
Adam Alexi-Malle. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Steve Martin is one of the most versatile actors in the business; he is
also one of the funniest comics, one of the few capable of making the
viewer believe any situation, no matter how farfetched. That much I knew
before Bowfinger. What I didn't know, and was pleasantly surprised to
learn, is that he is also a marvelous screenwriter. Mind you, this is
not Martin's first stab at scripting his own movie, but with the
possible exception of L.A. Story, it's his first real achievement in the
field (The Man With Two Brains, anyone? No? How 'bout A Simple Twist of
Fate?), a satirical yet good-natured, broad yet riotously funny spoof of
the movie business.</P>
<P>Martin is Bobby Bowfinger, a man with lifelong, so far unrealized dreams
of making a movie, who has kept his actress friend from taking many
promising opportunities with his hopes of making a Hollywood picture.
His accountant buddy writes a script for an action movie, "Chubby Rain".
Bowfinger brings the script to a big shot Hollywood producer. The
producer likes it and agrees to sponsor and release the movie under one
condition: Bowfinger must get Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), the biggest
action star around, to sign up for the project.</P>
<P>Ramsey says no but Bowfinger is not ready to give up on his lifelong
dream so easily. He decides to make the movie with Ramsey anyway:
without him knowing it. The problem is that Bowfinger's own performers
(a young, ambitious, sleazy wanna-be actress (Heather Graham) and a
self-proclaimed thespian (Christine Baranski)) both believe that they
are actually acting with Kit as opposed to coming up to him on the
street (in the parking lot, at a restaraunt, etc.), shouting lines and
having him run away in fear and confusion. Bowfinger tells them that
Ramsey's acting style dictates that he never socially interact with his
co-stars.</P>
<P>Sooner than later, a frightened Kit Ramsey starts hiding out and Bobby
must find an alternative method of starring the coveted actor in "Chubby
Rain". He holds auditions for Kit look-alikes (a requirement: a nice
ass, because Kit Ramsey, much like real-life Ewan McGregor, has a
running streak of showing his derrier on screen) and finds a near-twin.
Jiff (Murphy again) is exactly like Kit in everyway save the braces, the
stupid laugh and outgoing personality.</P>
<P>Bowfinger may not be the best satire of Hollywood ever but it's up there
with gems like The Player. It's also one of the best films of 1999.
Steve Martin's writing is sharp, witty and dead-on. Bowfinger, as a
whole, is a very, very funny movie but even during the the times when
the jokes take a break it's still entertaining because unlike a lot of
otherwise funny comedies it has a legitimate plot and characters we can
care about. Not even Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me could claim
that.</P>
<P>There is not a trace of anger in Bowfinger despite the fact that it is
rightfully classified as a satire. It exaggerates and it makes fun but
it's never mean or mocking. In fact, if I was asked for one word to most
aptly describe Bowfinger my answer would be "affectionate". Much like
the Austin Powers movies, here is a spoof that has no animosity towards
its subject. And that can make for good viewing.</P>
<P>In addition to his glorious script, Steve Martin's performance is
likewise on the ball; frantic, energetic, appealing and hilarious. He
put thought and love into his acting here and it shows: his Bobby
Bowfinger is one of the most likable -- and human -- screen characters I
have seen in a Hollywood movie. As for his similarly big-name co-star,
for the first time in years and possibly for the first time since he
became popular, Eddie Murphy contents himself with a supporting
performance. Indeed, he has only about half of the screentime that
Martin was allotted. Still, Murphy makes his presence felt. For the time
that he is on screen, he is as funny as ever. Eddie Murphy may be taking
the back seat on this one but damned if he isn't a good back seat
driver.</P>
<P>Bowfinger is entertaining, smart and unpretentious. It never claims to
be a meditation on the state of the film business but it is an effective
satire; a good-natured, funny and enjoyable combination of wildly
talented comics and a killer script.
