                       A film review by Shane R. Burridge

<PRE>Shine (1996) 104m.</PRE>
<P>True story of David Helfgott, a teenage pianist who won a scholarship
to The London Royal College of Music, had a nervous breakdown, and
returned home to Australia a forgotten recluse (although after the
Australian release of this film, the public showed a renewed interest
in him and he responded with a successful nationwide tour).  Three
actors play Helfgott - as a boy, a teenager, and an adult - but it's
the latter performance by Geoffrey Rush that's most absorbing.  How
much time did Rush and scriptwriter Jan Sardi spend with the real-life
Helfgott to capture his flustered, stream-of-consciousness speech so
naturally?  Rush's performance is such a powerhouse one (he doesn't
use a hand double for the piano-playing sequences) that it's easy to
overlook the similarly fine turns by his younger incarnations.  And
don't forget Scott Hicks' seamless directing job - it would be
tempting for any director to use the tormented-genius premise as an
excuse to go over the top, but Hicks keeps a tight rein on his story.</P>
<P>Emotional core of the film is harder to pin down - clearly it must be
Helfgott himself, but since he has been repressed by his father (Armin
Mueller-Stahl), a Polish Jew whose own father denied him access to a
musical instrument, he's not given to emotion easily (until his
wordless, memorable final scene on stage).  Also it's kind of
difficult to empathize with (a) mental instability, and (b) musical
genius.  The emotional focus of the story is instead directed toward
Helfgott.  Everyone he comes in contact with responds to him
positively; everybody loves him -  writer Katharine Prichard (Googie
Withers), his mentor Cecil Parkes (John Gielgud, still going strong),
his wife-to-be Gillian (Lynn Redgrave), and his family.  Despite all
the feel-good overtones, story never gets sappy, sentimental, or
manipulative.  Only point to consider after viewing is why no
explanation is offered for the cause of Helfgott's dysfunction.  Was
it simply too much strain that led to a mental collapse?  Were his
problems impressed on him from the start by his obssessive father? 
Was it purely medical in cause?  Or are we to be left with the
assumption that genius goes hand-in-glove with it's own special
madness?  As the film doesn't say one thing or another about any of
these possibilities it is the last one that might leave you with the
strongest impression, and since the expression `shine' is never
equated with Helfgott during the course of the film it's natural to
assume that it refers to the light of his talent which burned too
bright and too fast.  Or perhaps he `shone' because his father was
part Polish.  I know, I know.  I'm sorry... it was too hard to resist.</P>
