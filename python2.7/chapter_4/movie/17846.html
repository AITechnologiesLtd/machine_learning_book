<P>              SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER [1977]
           A retro reveiw by: Richard Matich
This film was not only made in the 1970s, it was the
1970s! Fresh from his stint as a high schooler in the
tv sitcom "Welcome Back Kotter", John Travolta became
both a household name and an idol to millions of
adoring fans. Grease [1978] would rocket him into the
stratisphere in the coming year. Long before</P>
<P>Travolta was in Pulp Fiction, he was getting his first
Oscar nomination for this film. The story is based on a
magazine article on the New York night lives of some
working class young people. The film hasTravolta as a
guy that is tough, street smart, and "oh so much" the
womens favorite on [and off] the dance floor. The dance
moves had all of America talking back then. People
would get their hair cut the way Travolta had it done</P>
<P>for the movie. The clothes made the "disco look" out
pace the "Annie Hall look" [women with neckties, vest
and/or baggy chinos] of the same year. Discos became
the hot destination for countless Americans [and even
in other countries] all because of Saturday Night
Fever. The soundtrack to the film won</P>
<P>Grammys and set records for albulm sales for years to
come. At one time it seemed as though everyone had that
soundtrack! The story works well enough and it remains
a cultural benchmark. It made a lot of people plenty of
money at a time when the U.S. economy needed "anything"
to get it going. Travolta &</P>
<P>company helped the nation's finanial and emotional well
being more so than did the Ford and Carter
administrations combined! The power of film!!!</P>
