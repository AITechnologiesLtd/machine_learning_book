<P>     Hamburg.  Nazi Germany.  1939.  Peter (Robert Sean Leonard),
Thomas (Christian Bale), and Arvid (Frank Whaley) are three "Swing
Kids"--young rebel Germans who have fallen in love with the forbidden:
"American movies, British fashion, and Swing music."  When the evil
specter of Nazism hovers over them in the form of a seemingly-benign
member of the Gestapo (Kenneth Branagh), Peter and Thomas must begin to
re-evaluate their priorities and values.</P>
<P>     SWING KIDS is a movie with a multitude of problems, the biggest of
which is its loose treatment of history and the Nazis.  While it's
undeniable that members of the Hitler Youth and the Gestapo were goons,
SWING KIDS portrays them as such in a cartoonish manner.  They are not
chillingly menacing; simply nasty.  Motivation is not a major concern.
The kind of mentality that sent millions of Jews to their deaths is
only weakly in evidence.  In fact, the entire Holocaust is given only
token screen time.  The need to sanitize this film to make it palatable
to mass audiences has robbed SWING KIDS of much of its power.
Trivializing Nazism is never a smart move.</P>
<P>     There's another, more subtle flaw in the script.  Everyone in
Germany who isn't a "Swing Kid" is regarded as a Nazi.  This was simply
not the case.  Most Germans were not members of the National Socialist
Party, and many citizens regarded Nazis with fear and distrust.  The
Luftwaffe was definitely not a "Nazi organization", yet SWING KIDS
makes no distinction between Luftwaffe officers and the Gestapo.</P>
<P>     Aside from the aforementioned problems, the plot is lacking when
it comes to originality.  That shouldn't be a surprise, however, coming
from Hollywood Pictures, well-known for regurgitating formula movies.
What is unusual is that some of the elements of this film do not allow
it to fall into the "happily ever after" category.  In that sense, it
takes a little risk.</P>
<P>     There are several scenes of high melodrama where the film comes
close to parodying itself.  While the two leads, Bale and Leonard, have
been competent in previous roles, they are merely adequate here, and
sometimes not even that.  Barbara Hershey is completely wasted.
Kenneth Branagh, in an uncredited role (it's more than just a
cameo--he's in a number of scenes), is unsurprisingly one of the bright
spots about this film.  He manages to create a sympathetic Nazi without
resorting to audience manipulation.</P>
<P>     Undoubtedly, the best part of SWING KIDS is its musical numbers.
The choreography and energy of these scenes is excellent.
Unfortunately, they are too few and far between and by the second half
of the movie, they've all but disappeared.</P>
<P>     SWING KIDS will undoubtedly appeal to the masses--and especially
the teen masses--who go to the movies simply to escape.  In fact, some
of those with little knowledge and less concern about the historical
period portrayed may even find this movie "powerful."  At its heart,
however, SWING KIDS is seriously flawed, and, while it isn't a terrible
movie, the best way to describe it may be "unfortunate."</P>
