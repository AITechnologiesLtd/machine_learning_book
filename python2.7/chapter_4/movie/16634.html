 Message in a Bottle (1999) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Kevin Costner, Robin
Wright Penn, Paul Newman and John Savage.</P>
<P> Theresa Osborne is a woman with a hole in her life. She is divorced and
devotes her time between her job as a researcher at the Chicago Tribune and
caring for her son, Jason.</P>
<P> But underneath this seemingly dependable, confident woman is an
unfulfilled soul yearning for that special someone to help her reconnect.</P>
<P> Sounds like a romance novel, doesn't it?</P>
<P> Well, Message in a Bottle is a glossy love story, a star-studded date
movie that's not as soapy as it sounds.</P>
<P> Strong performances, crisp directing and first-rate photography have
meshed to create a compelling story, based on Nicholas Sparks' best-selling
novel, that while a bit long at two hours and 15 minutes, maintains your
involvement with the protagonists.</P>
<P> While jogging on the beach, Theresa finds a bottle containing a letter.
Her soul reaches out to its author for his words are filled with pain and
regret. The writer has lost his wife, his "true north" and his letter deals
with his sorrow.</P>
<P> Theresa's boss publishes the letter, which leads to the discovery of a
second and a third. Theresa makes it her mission to find the writer. Her
sleuthing leads her to the Outer Banks of North Carolina and to sailboat
builder Garret Blake (Kevin Costner).</P>
<P> She convinces the paper to send her to North Carolina, where she contrives
to meet Garret.</P>
<P> Of course, a romance blooms. But Garret is still grieving for his lost
Catherine. He finds it difficult to extinguish the past, even as his salty
old dad, Dodge (Paul Newman), pushes him to get on with his life.</P>
<P> The two best aspects of Message in a Bottle are Newman's performance and
the cinematography of the legendary Caleb Deschanel.</P>
<P> Newman's Dodge is an alcoholic who has given up the bottle. He limits
himself to two beers a day. Newman adds heft and complexity to Dodge that
surprasses what could have been a one-dimensional, cliched character.</P>
<P> The sequence is which he confronts Garret, who has brushed him off,
telling him that what Garret does is none of his concern, is one of the
strongest in the film. Newman shows the pain a child's errant word can
cause.</P>
<P> Deschanel, whose credits include The Right Stuff, The Natural, The Black
Stallion and Fly Away Home, is a master of bringing whatever environment he
is filming into the audience's lap.</P>
<P> In Message in a Bottle, you feel the spray of the ocean, the power of the
waves, as the wind captures the sails of Garret's boat.</P>
<P> As Garret, Costner is not afraid to show his character's vulnerability. In
such films as Dancing With Wolves, JFK and even the dreadful Waterworld and
The Postman, Costner has created larger-than-life characters. It is a
relief to see him playing a regular guy with flaws and doubts.</P>
<P> The only quibble about his performance is that - on land - he seems too
slow, too deliberate, as if he is allowing his grief to envelop him and
debilitate his natural rhythm. At sea, Costner seems to allow his Garret to
be freer, more spontaneous.</P>
<P> As Theresa, Robin Wright Penn is radiant and intelligent. She tries to
hide her insecurities behind a carefree nonchalance about what is lacking
in her life.
This is an intimate story and director Luis Mandoki, best known for White
Palace and When a Man Loves a Woman, intersperses the love story with many
closeups, especially of Wright Penn's eyes.</P>
<P> Mandoki also is adept at using silence to forward the story, especially in
a scene in which Costner's Garret and his feuding brother-in-law, Johnny
(John Savage, in a small, but effective, role), resolve their differences.</P>
<P> Gerald DiPego's script is not perfect. Theresa's co-workers, for example,
come across as types, cliches, rather than full-blown characters. This is
too bad, since Theresa's best friend is portrayed by the titanic-talented
Illeana Douglas. Wasting that great actress's gifts is a high crime.</P>
<P> Overall, though, Message in a Bottle is an entertaining outing. Your date
may enter the theater with reluctance, but he may exit with a tear in his
eye.</P>
