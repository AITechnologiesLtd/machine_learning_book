<PRE>                               MADADAYO
                    A film review by Rachel Gordon

<P>It seems only fitting that Akira Kurosawa's last film (which he wrote
and directed) be an homage to teaching.  After all, he inspired many of
today's respected directors and is taught in film schools
internationally.  Madadayo is a sweetly overlong portrayal of an
interconnected community whose center is a beloved professor.</P>
<P>Madadayo opens with a Professor (Tatsuo Matsumura) announcing to his
class that after 30 years of teaching, he is now choosing to write in
retirement.  The young sing his praises and previous alumni move the
Professor and his wife into a new home.  The pair is as hospitable to
everyone as if they were children returning from college.</P>
<P>His students visit him constantly, trying to repay all his work with
whatever token of comfort they can.  Though he is still called Professor
and spins new tales, the relations no longer have the condescending
quality of talking down to a pupil.  The generation lines are blurred
more as the youths build a house for the couple when their new home has
been destroyed by air raids in the second World War.</P>
<P>With the perfect mix of humility, humor, and acceptance, it's easy to
understand the Professor's popularity.  He is idolized even when most
vulnerable.  It is also accepted when his alumni refuse to allow him to
wallow in self-pity.  As the standard of living decreases, the Professor
accepts his pupils as equals that much more, for each chips in to help.</P>
<P>Every year after his retirement, a Maadh Kai (translation: Are you
ready?) party is thrown in the Professor's honor.  They shout verses
back and forth to jokingly confirm to the entire community that he isn't
ready to die yet.  The tiresome length of these scenes is somewhat
abated by the contagious laughter and various toasts as to the nature of
the Professor's lessons.</P>
<P>The Professor is never shown in front of a class again, so his pupil's
words are the strongest indications of the type of mentor he was.  Added
to this is that the only time the young peers are shown communicating
without the Professor around is when they are talking about him. 
Matsumura carries the nucleus of the film well, with his subtle sarcasm
and silent revelry.  The script is also intelligent enough to display
the wonderful impact he has had on others' lives without having to bear
witness to a school lecture.</P>
<P>As kind and humbling as Madadayo is, the plot becomes monotonous.  Each
section simply presents something going wrong with the Professor's life,
and his students then resolve the issue.  One unending series of scenes
revolves around the revered older gentleman losing emotional control
over a cat that disappears.  The beauty of his visions about the missed
feline is intoxicating, as are the verses spoken, but the effect wears
off due to the long interval.</P>
<P>As with other foreign subtitled films, some of the culture-based jokes
won't have the same strength when translated, leaving the viewer at a
loss to understand why the characters are laughing.  The unique
collaboration between age groups is pleasant but it's difficult to
accept that these lads risk setting their mentor on the correct
emotional track only once.</P>
<P>Impeccably shot by Takao Saito, who was also the cinematographer for
Kurosawa's Ran and Dreams, it can be difficult to concentrate on what is
being said.  From lush gardens to stark devastation after World War II,
cultural details seem to flow past the screen.</P>
<P>Similar to Stand and Deliver and other "perfect teacher" movies,
Madadayo is a feel-good experience worth a rental, if only because the
central character is flawed, and therefore a more interesting study. 
The humor is contributes unexpectedly poignant satire, which is rarely
found in the peers of this genre.  However, for a truly brilliant
Kurosawa experience, check out his earlier work first.</P>
