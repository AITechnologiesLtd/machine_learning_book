<P>For those of you who couldn't get enough of Albert Brooks' 1999 film The
Muse (and I know a lot of you couldn't, considering it didn't even recoup
its $15 million budget) and thought, "Gee, it sure would be great if this
were based on truth...and set in turn-of-the-century Vienna...and a drama
instead of a comedy," then, people, I have got a film for you.  Bride of the
Wind is a drama based on truth that is set during turn-of-the-century
Vienna, and instead of its main character inspiring the likes of James
Cameron, Martin Scorsese, Jeff Bridges and Meathead, she motivates real
artists of that time.</P>
<P>The muse is Alma Moll (Sarah Wynter, The 6th Day), the social-climbing
daughter of a popular stage actress.  Bride opens, after some handsome
opening credits that show old Austrian film clips, in 1902 Vienna, which is
atwitter with the news that the great composer, Gustav Mahler (Jonathan
Pryce, Stigmata), is taking up residence in their fair city.  Everyone
rushes to kiss Mahler's ass, but Alma gets his attention by criticizing his
music.  Mahler in intrigued, but tells Alma, "A symphony is like the world;
it must contain everything."  I think Baz Luhrmann incorporated the same
practice into Moulin Rogue.</P>
<P>Mahler is easily seduced by Alma, and they eventually marry, but he forces
her to give up her burgeoning music career to focus on things like balancing
his books.  Alma squirts out a couple of kids, and after one of them dies
she heads for the sanitarium, where she falls in love with Bauhaus architect
Walter Gropius (Simon Verhoeven).  Alma still accompanies Mahler in his move
to New York City, yet continues to yearn for Gropius.</P>
<P>Then she falls for Impressionist painter Oskar Kokoschka (Vincent Perez, I
Dreamed of Africa), whose first attempt at a physical relationship with Alma
is greeted with a squeeze to the ol' twig-and-berries (she's some lady, this
Alma). After Kokoschka, she moves onto left-wing author Franz Werfel (Gregor
Seberg), who looks a lot like SNL's Darryl Hammond. Alma marries a few of
these four men (it's honestly difficult to keep track of her latest hubby),
and, although it's not shown in the film, continues to bed famous men.
Alma's poor daughter, Anna, obviously confused by the carousel of men, just
calls them all "Uncle."</P>
<P>We're never really given a clear reason why she hops beds so frequently.
Bride is, I think, supposed to show Alma as a pioneer feminist (and, indeed,
the script was written by a woman, first-timer Marilyn Levy), but winds up
portraying her as a flaky horn-dog who is easily bored with men. To make
matters worse, Wynter isn't that great of an actress. Other than her cute
pout (think Cate Blanchett crossed with Renée Zellweger, only without the
talent), there isn't much going on, other than her willingness to
participate in a lot of lingering sex scenes.</P>
<P>Wynter isn't the only performer who disappoints. The usually reliable Pryce
turns in a performance reminiscent of the great Frank Langella. It doesn't
help that the story is poorly written and full of silly dialogue, or that it
casually mentions major historical events as if they were an afterthought,
like when somebody literally sticks their head into one scene to shout about
the assassination of the Archduke. Given the short running time, I wouldn't
be surprised to learn that the original cut from director Bruce Beresford
(Double Jeopardy) was much longer and a bit more detailed but shoddily
edited to a more reasonable length. And I'm not even sure you could consider
Alma a muse. She's more like a starfucker than anything; an early ancestor
of Bonny Bakely.</P>
<P>And the title of the film, in case you were wondering, comes from one of
Kokoschka's paintings.
1:38 - R for sexuality and nudity</P>
