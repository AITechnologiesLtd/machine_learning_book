<P>Susan Granger's review of "JEEPERS CREEPERS" (MGM/UA Entertainment)</P>
<P>  This nasty, little horror film begins as a bickering brother (Justin
Long) and sister (Gina Philips) are driving through the desolate countryside on
their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrapped-up bodies down a
drainage pipe. When Long decides to investigate, there's nothing but trouble.
"You know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid
and everybody hates them for it? - Well, this is it!" Philips warns. What he
finds in the basement of an old, abandoned church  is a dying boy with a
horrifying, jagged-stitched incision from his neck to his navel, plus hundreds
of other mutilated bodies, stitched together on the walls and ceiling like a
disgusting tapestry. Long flees but now the monstrous, winged Creeper (Jonathan
Breck) is after both of them! Eileen Brennan appears briefly as the Cat Lady and
Patricia Belcher is Jezelle, a psychic who explains the evil creature's bizarre
feeding habits. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Jeepers Creepers" is a
fiendishly visceral 2 with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion, giving new
meaning to the old song "Jeepers Creepers."</P>
<P>   And now - as Paul Harvey would say - for the rest of the story.
What's more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that
writer/director Victor Salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped
himself having oral sex with a 12 year-old actor in California. Sentenced to
three years in prison, he served 15 months and completed parole in 1992. When
Salva made "Powder" (1995), the story of an albino boy with supernatural
abilities, Disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his
prior conviction as a pedophile. And now, once again, in this MGM/UA film, that
fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio.</P>
