<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>        It's not a good sensation to walk away from a film feeling hungry for
more.  At the end of Twilight, when the image blacked out and I saw the
word "Cast" peek up from the bottom of the screen, I was wondering where
the other three or four reels had gone.  Much to my dismay, it turns out
that I saw the whole thing.  Twilight is a mystery that runs just over
90 minutes; there are three extremely interesting and well-acted
characters that are given a depressingly short amount of time to make
their appearances and tell their stories.  I can't think of a film that
feels more rushed and unexplored as this one.</P>
<P>        The first scene is unimpressive, and had me prepared for an overall bad
film.  Paul Newman stars as Harry Ross, who, in this opening scene, is
in Mexico to retrieve a young woman (Reese Witherspoon) who is on
vacation with her boyfriend (Liev Schreiber) without the consent of her
parents.  Things go wrong, and she accidentally shoots him in the leg. 
The scene is dry and poorly choreographed, and is plagued by an insipid
and unoriginal music score.  </P>
<P>        Fortunately, things pick up a little.  We are transported two years
past the time depicted in the first scene; we learn that Harry lives
with some old friends, wealthy actor/actress couple Jack and Catherine
Ames (Gene Hackman and Susan Sarandon).  Basically, Harry is Jack's
personal private investigator.  Jack sends Harry on a job that he
describes as "safe"--he must deliver a package to a woman.  When Harry
arrives at the address, he finds a bleeding man who has been shot (M.
Emmet Walsh), and he tries to kill Harry.  Quickly, Harry finds himself
caught up in a web of criminal activities, and his primary motive in
attempting to bring the issues to closure revolves around his wanting to
know if the Ames are responsible.</P>
<P>        In the end, I found myself disappointed not in the film's execution,
but in it's completely limited approach to a situation that is so
complex and interesting.  Perhaps the best thing about the film is
Newman, who is a fantastic, seasoned, and completely engaging performer
to watch on screen.  He's great here--Harry is funny and well-written,
and he has a life outside of what we see.  Newman's performance is deep
and sympathetic, and he had me hooked immediately--he plays his part
like a pro.</P>
<P>        Hackman and Sarandon are equally good, and are both given fascinating
characters to embody.  Jack, who is dying from cancer, is a very flawed
individual, but Hackman elicits our sympathy and makes us like him
despite some of the things he does.  And Sarandon, as the woman who will
do anything for her husband, is also excellent:  she shows all of the
depth and complexity that she did in Dead Man Walking, but in half the
screen time.  There is also a colorful supporting cast, including James
Garner and Stockard Channing.</P>
<P>        These characters are so well-written that I simply can't believe
writer/director Robert Benton didn't do more with them.  Twilight could
have been a full hour longer without overstaying its welcome.  I wanted
to see these people in more situations; I wanted to see them interact
with each other more.  I wanted to see moments of emotional rage, and
moments of quiet, probing tenderness.  There are small bursts of all of
these things in Twilight, but the moments are so short and yet so tasty
that I felt kind of the same way I do when I eat just one potato chip on
an empty stomach.</P>
<P>        And it doesn't help that there are things here that I didn't like.  The
subplot involving a delusional man who thinks he is Harry's partner is
intrusive and pointless.  Much of the dialogue feels forced:  in one
scene, Witherspoon (who plays the Ames' daughter) meets Harry as he is
watching Jack and Catherine cuddle on their bed.  "This is their story,"
she says.  "You and I just have bit parts."  And while it's a nice
comment and probably holds a lot of truth, it feels wrong as dialogue,
and is certainly out of place from a girl who we're lead to believe is
of questionable intelligence.</P>
<P>        It's common to criticize a film because it feels long and tedious; I
criticize Twilight because of the opposite.  Benton rushes the
fascinating story to a premature conclusion, and the result is a film
that feels incomplete.  The three hours of Titanic feel swift, but we
are fulfilled and exhilarated when it's over.  The 90 minutes of
Twilight feel alarmingly brief--they whet our appetites for a main
course that will never arrive.</P>
