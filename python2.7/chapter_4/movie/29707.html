<PRE>LANTANA
A film review by Rachel Gordon
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Men have feelings too.  Men cry, despite the stigma attached to their
gender, or at least they want to more than they let on.  It's all
societal conditioning.  That's the pretentious premise of this
never-ending, two-hour look at couple dysfunction.</P>
<P>With a highly acclaimed cast that includes Anthony LaPaglia, Barbara
Hershey, and Geoffrey Rush you would hope this idea would provide great
material for such illustrious actors to sink their teeth into. 
Unfortunately, having been adapted for the screen from a play, by the
playwright himself, much of the emotional impact is lost in
overwhelmingly dramatic dialogue.</P>
<P>Valerie (Hershey), married to John (Rush), is a therapist, and her
patients' lives are starting to intrude on her own mental state.  Her
daughter was horribly murdered two years before and her marriage has
been stagnant ever since.  She and John love each other but cannot
connect.  One of Valerie's patients, Patrick, is a homosexual who
continually talks of an affair with a married man.  Slowly, Valerie
becomes convinced that the divide between she and John is larger than
she thought, possibly as a result of Patrick.</P>
<P>Then there's Leon (LaPaglia) a cop married to the beautiful and vibrant
Sonja (Kerry Armstrong), who is secretly going to Valerie for therapy. 
Leon is having an affair with Jane (Rachael Blake), though he is still
in love with his wife, as an attempt to feel something.  Jane herself is
consistently lonely after separating from her husband and often spies on
the family next door.</P>
<P>These circles become claustrophobic because Valerie suddenly disappears
one evening.  Leon is put on the case as a detective and breaks off his
affair with Jane, but still can't get his life in order.  These factors
combine to create many a scene in which men are trying to express
emotions and mistakes to one another, and fail miserably.</P>
<P>To give the film some credit, it is able to portray masculine anxiety in
reacting to a situation too much like a stereotypical woman would.  The
real problem is that during sympathetic moments, emotive speeches seem
forced on all the characters that are uttering them.  While the acting
is basically impeccable, the conversations are unreal and difficult to
accept, even at their most dramatic climaxes.  It doesn't help that,
when these men are trying to talk to one another, there is repetitive
whining about how men aren't suppose to cry or show emotion.</P>
<P>Still, what keeps things interesting is that every person involved is
heavily flawed.  They lie and cheat and find it difficult to learn from
their mistakes.  There's always hope, in a new scene filled with
tension, that some kind of new barrier will be breached, that some
catharsis will come through.  The plot is hazy enough, as are its
characters, that any growth or change is unpredictable.  To see the
little details that spring from the characters' effects on each other
rings true enough.</P>
<P>What also works are the dysfunctional marriage scenes between husband
and wife.  Communication comes through looks and stares instead of
accusatory speeches.  The annoying chatter present when it's two
movie-character men talking is thankfully left out.</P>
<P>Lantana's strengths and weaknesses, like its characters, balance each
other out.  Not a flaw can be found in how it articulates difficulty
within a marriage.  If only it would stop complaining about how men are
raised.</P>
