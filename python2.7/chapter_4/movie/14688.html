<P>Holy Man prompts me to ask the question, "Do shopping networks
broadcast live?"  The film, which stars Eddie Murphy as a strange and
spiritual individual, hinges entirely on the assumption (or is it a
fact?) that shopping networks broadcast everything live.  If this is a
fallacy, then nothing in this film is even remotely possible, for every
plot development lies on the shoulders of scenes that have Eddie Murphy
spewing "insightful" nonsense on a live shopping network.  If the
network didn't broadcast live, then the producers could have edited out
everything he says, or kicked him off, and he would've been nothing more
than a crazy Peter Finch-wannabe who likes talking into the camera. </P>
<P>You may be wondering why I'm asking such a silly question.  It's
because this is such a silly film.  Holy Man a movie that wants to be
deep and satirical, but is neither one.  It's unintentionally ironic,
though, which is a quality that's fun to mock.  What really bothers me,
aside from the dumb script, is that Holy Man doesn't really know what
it's about  -- it's a satire that unconsciously satirizes itself.  So,
due to inept production values, the film's appeal rests on the appeal of
the three lead actors:  Murphy, Jeff Goldblum, and Kelly Preston.  They
carry it to a point, but they can't hide the fact that the film just
isn't well-conceived.  </P>
<P>Goldblum actually has the main role as Ricky Hayman, a producer of the
shopping network.  The film begins with Ricky's career in trouble --
sales have been going down, and the boss, McBainbridge (Robert Loggia),
is breathing down his neck to do something, and quick!  McBainbridge
brings in Kate Newell (Kelly Preston), who has some bright ideas about
where they should take the image of the network.  Just when things start
going really bad for Ricky, he meets an odd, serene individual named G
(Murphy).  Kate is instantly entranced with G, but Ricky finds him
annoying.</P>
<P>At this point, I figured the film would be pretty straightforward: 
they put G on air, ratings soar, conflicts arise, happy ending, blah
blah blah.  I was right, but only partially so:  everything happens as I
said, but there are about forty-five minutes of down time in the middle,
featuring scenes in which G stumbles onto the live shopping network sets
and speaks to the salespeople who are trying to sell laundry detergent
balls and chainsaws.  Then, of course, Ricky has to struggle to get him
off the stage so he doesn't make a fool of himself.  It's only after
this happens for half the film that the ratings and sales finally
increase, and then we're allowed to watch the plot trudge through all
the bland banalities of the Happy Family Film formula.</P>
<P>It's not really an awful film, but it reminds me that Hollywood, for
the most part, can't articulate a theme in even the most pathetically
misguided way.  It also reminds me that talented actors are often forced
to take certain roles to keep their careers alive.  Now, I probably
would have really disliked this film if it weren't for Goldblum -- the
guy is very funny, even when his lines aren't that good.  He's a
commanding screen presence, but he's also a good actor; he wrings at
least a little bit of feeling out of the obligatory "touching" scenes
towards the end.  Preston is also appealing, but, expectedly, the token
female role in this particular film isn't exactly fleshed-out.  Loggia
is good but annoying, while Jon Cryer, as Ricky's assistant, is
surprisingly funny.</P>
<P>That leaves us with Murphy, who has clearly made this movie because it
has some kind of message.  What, exactly, is that message?  Well, he
spends most of the film delivering trite, underdeveloped sentences like,
"Don't rely on material goods for happiness!" and "Admire the beauty of
grass!"  (By the way, I read somewhere that grass is one of the most
unnatural environments; it can not exist freely in nature, and is
basically nothing more than controlled weeds.  This makes me wonder how
"in touch" G really is with his surroundings.)  When G gets on TV, he
urges people *not* to buy things, and this leads to two things:  1) 
massive increase in sales, and 2) a nationwide G-craze.  The film
therefore implies that everyone watches shopping networks, which is also
a pretty silly thing to say.</P>
<P>Hey, satire is a great thing.  Failed satire, however, is pitiful. 
Holy Man is just another Hollywood movie, made specifically to rake in
cash with its big-name stars.  The fact that Hollywood tries to satirize
an industry that closely resembles itself is pretty odd, especially when
it fails to realize the irony in doing so.  There's a big difference
between a film like this and one like The Truman Show (which, by the
way, succeeds), because Holy Man isn't bold or biting -- it fits a
formula down to the last detail.  A formula film that says, "Don't fall
prey to consumerism!" is, in effect, saying, "Don't watch the film
you're watching!"  For a film that wants to make money, I fail to see
the logic in all of this.</P>
<P>On top of everything, the story is just so bland.  And, if you want to
know the history behind G -- his name, religion, why the hell he acts
the way he does -- you won't find it here.  Holy Man provides absolutely
no insight into its namesake, which creates a big problem when the
producers are expecting audiences to understand this man and believe
what he says.  This simply adds to the dominating flimsiness of the
film's claims.</P>
<P>It's not all bad though; aside from the amusing acting, there are some
pretty funny scenes (the two ladies with the laundry detergent balls is
pretty good).  Director Stephen Herek, although relentlessly
heavy-handed (his tactics worked better in Mr. Holland's Opus) at least
keeps the film interesting to look at.  It also got me to ask some
pretty challenging questions about the shopping network industry (do
they really broadcast live?).  Overall, I'm left as a fantastically
confused viewer:  didn't anyone notice that Holy Man is a self-defeating
endeavor?  A film that really wants to take a shot at satire should
first take a good look at itself, just to make certain that it's not at
the butt of its own joke.  </P>
