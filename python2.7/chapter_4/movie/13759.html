<PRE>MAFIA! (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Jim Abrahams
Writers: Jim Abrahams, Greg Norberg, and Michael McCamus
Starring: Jay Mohr, Lloyd Bridges, Christina Applegate, Billy Burke,
Olympia Dukakis, Pamela Gidley</P>
<P>"Mafia!" comes from one third of the creators of "Airplane!," a film that
defined the gag-a-minute form of comedy, and did it with such sheer surreal
delight that it's even more of a classic than the film it was parodying,
"Airport."  That person is Jim Abrahams, who is also one of the creators of
"The Naked Gun" and "Hot Shots!" movies, which were also hilarious films. 
Why were they hilaroius?  Because a good percentile of the millions of
jokes told were funny.  A film like this can never really fail as long as
there are funny jokes, and it only works incredibly well if the jokes are
not only funnier but frequent.  The longer the space between the good
jokes, the worse the film gets.</P>
<P>Such a film is "Mafia!," a gag-induced treatment of three mafia pics - "The
Godfather," "The Godfather: Part II," and "Casino" - as well as assorted
other flicks, everything from "Forrest Gump" to "The Gold Rush" to "Il
Postino."  I did laugh during this film, but there are two differences
between this film and the other earlier greater films: 1) when I laughed,
it was more of a chuckle then a whole-hearted laugh, and 2) these laughs
were widely spaced between jokes that just fell completely on their ass and
got more of a "nice try" reaction than anything else.</P>
<P>Take one early scene in the movie: Lloyd Bridges, in his final role, plays
the Brando part in the first "Godfather" movie, and during his daughter's
wedding, a tall henchman dressed as a priest walks up to him and says, "Say
hello to my little friend."  Instead of wipping out a gun like Pacino did
in "Scarface" when he said this line, he opens the crease in his pants, and
a little dwarf comes out with a gun and shoots Bridges.  I laughed
(although I laughed harder when I saw it for the first time in the
previews).  Then the dwarf continues to shoot Bridges over and over and
over and over and over again, and as he's being shot, he starts doing what
looks like dances, and the band plays whatever dance they think he's doing,
everything from Swing to the Macarena.  Just not funny.  Nice try, though.</P>
<P>I'm not sure why the jokes aren't that funny.  Abrahams is very adept at
creating gags-a-second on his own, gags that are for the most part pretty
hilarious.  And he has some good performers on hand, like Jay Mohr, who was
killer during his brief stint on "Saturday Night Live" and awesome as a
scene stealer in "Jerry Maguire."  He even has Bridges, bringing comic
grace a la an older Leslie Nielsen, and giving it the right note of
sentimentality since we loved him and he's gone.  My god, he even somehow
got Olympia Dukakis to show up in an all-too-brief performance as Bridges's
aging, hunch-backed mother who at one point drinks prune juice during a
parody of a famous scene in the first "Godfather."</P>
<P>Maybe it's not that funny because basically the plot of the parody, if you
can call it that, it extremely sloppy.  Even "Airplane!" had a coherent
plot, sorta, one that you could say was well-laid out.  The jokes in that
movie came out of the scene itself, which were milked for all its comic
worth.  Here, the story moves primarily because of the plot.  When a scene
is over, it's because the writers ran out of jokes, and the parodies of the
three chief movies just don't work together.  The film opens with a parody
of the opening scene of "Casino," with Jay Mohr playing the DeNiro
character being blown up in his car, and then goes back to his father's
childhood and early adulthood a la "The Godfather: Part II," then goes to
the opening of the first "Godfather."  These films don't it together as
well, though, and even though I probably shouldn't be complaning that a
plot is sloppy in a film like this, it may be part of the reason why it's
just not that funny.</P>
<P>But the main problem with this film is the jokes aren't that funny.  The
best parts are the ones in the casino, where there are games like "Chutes
and Ladders," "Candyland," as well as games like "Guess the Number" and
"You Can't Possibly Win This Game."  The worst parts are things in between
the good jokes, the fillers, like how everyone runs into things and knocks
them over.  Maybe the biggest travesty is they do next to nothing with
Lloyd Bridges.  It's not that I'm sad he didn't get more screen time
because it was his final performance - he was a great comic actor and he
deserves more than a scene where he just falls down and closes venitan
blinds on his head.  They don't even allow him to do a Brando
impersonation, the key to any joke made at the "Godfather" films.</P>
<P>But really, who wanted to see a parody of these films anyway.  They're so
intensely serious that any joke that had been made at them has probably
been made already.  Brando's performance is a laugh in itself - show me one
person who can't at least try to do a Brando imitation?  I said a film like
this couldn't entirely fail, but this one comes pretty damn close.</P>
