<P>Alexander Nevsky (1938, Sergei Eisenstein)</P>
<P>A retrospective review by David M. Arnold</P>
<P>The year was 1938.  Russia had signed a non-aggression treaty
with Germany.  Stalin, perhaps  since he was cut from the same
cloth as was Hitler, understood better than the other Allies that
the Germans couldn't be trusted.  Like many totalatarian
regimes, Stalin's believed the purpose of Art was as a tool
of the State to communicate to the masses.</P>
<P>Sergei Eisenstien, the great Russian filmmaker and theorist
was approached by Stalin to make a film that would help prepare
the Soviet population for war with Germany.  Eisenstien chose
as the subject of his film a historic event:  The defeat of the
Teutonic Knights by the Russians under the leadership of Alexander
Nevsky in 1242.  Sergei Prokofiev provided the score, and Stalin
gave Eisenstein access to the Soviet army as extras.  The result,
"Alexander Nevsky" is a classic, both as cinema and as propaganda.</P>
<P>Prince Alexander (Nikolai Cherkasov) has returned from defeating
the Swedes at the Battle of the Neva River, from which he earned
his surname  "Nevsky".  His band of followers is approached by a
Mongol prince, who upon learning Alexander's identiy immediately
offers him a high position in the Horde.  Alexander demurrs and
the Mongols go on their way.  One of Alexander's lieutenants
suggests they should drive the Mongols away, but Alexander
ominiously states that there are more dangerous threats.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the city of Nogovorod is shown as a prosperous medieval
town.  Vasili (Nikolai Okhlopkov) and Gavrilo (Andrei Abrikosov),
two noblemen vie for the affections of a Olga (Vera Ivasheva). Ignat
(Dmitri Orlov), a master armourer, hawks his wares.  Then comes
word of the fall of the neighboring city of Pskov to the Teutonic
Knights, a German religious order that strives to unite the entire
Christian world under the Holy Roman Emporer. The people of Nogovorod
debate whether to bribe the Teutons for peace or to assemble and
fight.  The decide to fight under the leadership of Domash (Nikolai
Arsky), but Domash insists that they need a stronger leader, one
with a clearer head.  They need Alexander.</P>
<P>A delegation is sent to Alexander's headquarters to ask him to
help defend Nogovorod.  Alexander says he knows nothing of defense,
he will attack.  And, he will need not only his own troops and
those of Nogovorod, but they must mobilize and arm the peasants
as well.  The Teutons, with the help of the traitorous Tverdilo
(Sergei Blinnikov), the ex-mayor of Pskov, march towards Nogovorod.
They meet Alexander's forces on a frozen lake, and what is perhaps
the largest staged medieval battle ensues.</P>
<P>Totalatarian Art is full of symbolism, and Eisenstein lays it on
with a trowel.  The spiritual leader of the Teutonic Knights is
an archbishop whose crest looks very much like a stylized swastika.
The Teutons themselves wear helms that look like inverted milk pails
with cross-shaped eye and nose openings: Faceless opressors; while
the Russians wear open, onion-shaped helmets.  (The Teutons employ
impressed mercenaries who wear helmets that look remarkably like
German WW-II army gear, except with eye holes that again render them
faceless.)</P>
<P>The Teutons are bent on converting or eliminating any who refuse to
bow to the Holy Roman Emperor:  This means the Russians because they
are Russian Orthodox.  To demonstrate the cruelty of the Teutons we
are shown old men being hanged, women burnt at the stake and infants
and small children thrown into fires.  (Actually, if one substitues
Judaism for Russion Orthodoxy, Eisenstein was remarkably prescient).</P>
<P>The film itself is remarkable for the massive battle scene, although
the rest of the film seems weaker in comparison.  Eisenstein's
theories on montage that are epitomized in his 1925 film "Battleship
Potemkin" seem more subdued here.  Since each character is a symbol
for Something Else, the performances are decidedly one-dimensional.
Overall, "Alexander Nevsky" does succeed in evoking 13th century
Russian life, the sets and costumes look authentic.</P>
<P>"Alexander Nevsky" plays like a silent film, and it might as well
have been one:  I don't speak a word of Russian, and the soundtrack
is so muddy I doubt I could have  understood a word of it even if I
did speak Russian.  Prokofiev's score comes through, dimly, and it
is a wonderful marriage of folk tunes and original melodies that
pump up the nationalistic fervor of the film.  Stalin must have been
mightily pleased with what Eisenstein had delivered.</P>
<P>Nothing "Alexander Nevsky" achieves negates the fact that this is
State-sponsored propaganda.  Today, in the wake of the Littleton
tragedy, I hear blame being placed on films.  I hear calls for
controls on film content.  Although I believe that many modern
films do cross the line of common sense and decency, I also firmly
believe that we cannot allow Film to slip into proscribed content
controls.  The ultimate end to that slippery slope is State Art,
and we could end up only with films like "Alexander Nevsky".</P>
