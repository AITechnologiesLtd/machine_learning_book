<P>Every once in a while, a film comes along that causes me to disregard all of 
my writing skills because, when truth be told, just thinking about it seems 
to notably decrease my IQ. There is no way to be intelligent when discussing 
a movie so repugnantly atrocious and unintelligible as "Battlefield Earth," 
reportedly John Travolta's dream project for ten years and based on the cult 
sci-fi novel by L. Ron Hubbard. Incompetent in every way possible, it is a 
collision course of non-ideas, zero-dimensional characters, shoddy special 
effects, blase performances, and a complete disregard for anything that could 
possibly make any kind of sense to a human being watching such an 
embarrassment. </P>
<P>The plot is fairly incomprehensible, but it goes something like this: Set in 
the year 3000, when "man is an endangered species" on Earth, a 9-foot-tall 
alien race known as the Psychlos have wiped out almost all human existence, 
with only a minority of earthlings left to do the Psychlos' bidding. Jonny 
Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper, and yes, that's his character's real name) is 
captured by the Psychlos, headed by Terl (John Travolta) and his henchman 
(Forest Whitaker), and sent to Ft. Knox to steal all of the gold that has 
been locked up in a vault for the last one-thousand years. I think that's 
some of the plot; I can't be too sure.</P>
<P>Thinking back on "Battlefield Earth," the movie is a giant, 2-hour haze, not 
only because I was struggling to keep focus on the film and not drift into 
slumber for the middle section, but because the picture is a jumble of 
already bad ideas that were made far, far worse when actually translated to 
film, under the phenomenally inauspicious helm of director Roger Christian. 
There are no characters to care about (or even get to know), the villains are 
disposable and unthreatening, and the action sequences about as exciting as 
the entirety of 1982's "My Dinner With Andre." Let's not forget the laughable 
matte paintings, which looked more realistic in 1939's "The Wizard of Oz." Or 
the screen wipes that, without fail, were used as the transition from each 
scene to the next, a 'la "Star Wars," ad nausea.</P>
<P>Prior to its release, John Travolta set off on a countrywide promotional tour 
to support this film, but my question is, had he even seen the finished 
product? Was he really there when filming was underway, or was that his evil 
doppleganger, out to sabotage his career a second time? You'd have to see 
"Battlefield Earth" to believe it, but don't, under any circumstances, see 
it. Some movies have the quality of being so bad they are entertaining. 
"Battlefield Earth," on the other hand, is so bad it's depressing. I would 
never throw around such words lightly, but on the evidence presented here, it 
may very well be one of the worst motion pictures I have ever had the 
misfortune of sitting through. A disaster of epic proportions!</P>
