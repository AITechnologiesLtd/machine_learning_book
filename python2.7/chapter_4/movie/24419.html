"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>I don't know when it started, but films that open with shots of suburbia
give me the chills.  Oak-lined streets, white picket fences, moms
watering the lawn, kids playing basketball, dads barbequing – should I
really find them that creepy, or is American Beauty still fresh in my
mind?  You practically expect something alarming to happen, like for the
camera to pan down and reveal a human ear lying in the grass (a la David
Lynch's Blue Velvet).</P>
<P>It's no Blue Velvet, but The Virgin Suicides has a development just as
disturbing.  And all it takes is one line to snap you out of the
suburban daydream – `Cecilia was the first to go.'  The images of moms
and dads and lawns and fences are replaced with one of a
thirteen-year-old girl in a bathtub filled with crimson-tinged water.
It's akin to a slap across the face.  And like Lester Burnham's opening
monologue in American Beauty, that line gives you an idea of what to
expect from the rest of the film.</P>
<P>Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall, young Jenny in Forrest Gump), we learn, is the
youngest daughter in the Lisbon family.  The Lisbons (James Woods, Any
Given Sunday and Kathleen Turner, Baby Geniuses) are the parents of five
beautiful teenaged daughters that look like they just stepped out of a
Golden Grahams commercial.  There's fourteen-year-old Bonnie (Chelse
Swain, sister of Lolita's Dominique), fifteen-year-old Lux (Kirsten
Dunst, Dick), sixteen-year-old Mary (A.J. Cook) and seventeen-year-old
Therese (Leslie Hayman).  Together, the Lisbon daughters form their own
little clique of well-developed, blonde girls, which, as you might
expect, attracts the attention of every teenaged boy within pheromone
range.</P>
<P>But the Lisbon parents are maniacally strict, barely allowing their
voluptuous flock to leave the house, let alone date boys, which only
makes the forbidden girls more tantalizing.  In fact, Suicides is told
from the point of view of a boy that lived in the neighborhood (Giovanni
Ribisi, Boiler Room, provides the narration but does not appear in the
film).</P>
<P>Like other similarly aged young men that lived near the Lisbons, the
narrator explains their infatuation with the girls led them to find and
collect Lisbon memorabilia.  They still talk about them, even though the
events that play out in the film transpired twenty-five years ago.  The
boys-turned-men have a burning desire to know what went on in the Lisbon
house, but just don't have enough information to piece the past
together.</P>
<P>While Cecilia's suicide was a major catalyst for the actions of the
other Lisbon girls, Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett, Here on Earth) was
certainly another.  The most popular boy in school, Trip successfully
woos Lux with his rock-star swagger (and a wig like Kelso on That ‘70s
Show), but then ditches her after a school dance, setting off a chain of
tragic events in the Lisbon house; events that nobody seemed to care
about but the narrator and his friends.</P>
<P>Suicides is full of amazing performances from everyone, including the
interchangeable Lisbon girls.  Woods character gets nuttier and nuttier
as the film progresses and things in his house begin to spin out of
control.  The luminous Dunst chalks up another fantastic performance –
it's hard to believe she just turned eighteen.  But the surprising
standout acting-wise is Hartnett, who gets so far into his role that
you'll likely forget that it's him.  Scott Glenn (Firestorm) and Danny
DeVito (Drowning Mona) also appear in one scene apiece.</P>
<P>Suicides is the directorial debut of Sofia Coppola, the daughter of
Oscar winner Francis Ford Coppola, who, until now, was probably most
famous for playing Mary Corleone in The Godfather, Part III or, at best,
the wife of last year's Oscar-nominee Spike Jonze (Being John
Malkovich).  But Sofia proves here that's she's just as talented as her
pop, her Oscar-winner cousin (Nicolas Cage), her Oscar-winning grandpa
(Carmine Coppola), her Oscar-nominated aunt (Talia Shire) or her
husband.  Coppola adapted the script from Jeffrey Eugenides' debut novel
of the same name, and pumped the music full of great period music (but
not stuff that you're tired of hearing in films), like Heart, Todd
Rundgren, ELO and Janis Ian.  The standout score was provided by the
French band Air.</P>
<P>1:38 - R for strong thematic elements involving teenagers</P>
