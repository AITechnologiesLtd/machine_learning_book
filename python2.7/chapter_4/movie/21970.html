<PRE>The Exorcist
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Ellen Burstyn; Max Von Sydow; Lee J. Cobb; Jason Miller & Linda
Blair</P>
<P>As you can probably glean by the title of the film, The Exorcist revolves
around an exorcism. Specifically, the exorcism of a little girl. When little
Regan (Linda Blair) starts to behave strangely -- like killing family
friends and float in mid-air over her bed -- her mother (Ellen Burstyn)
becomes concerned. Add to that the fact that Regan also claims to be
possessed by the Devil, and it's obvious that the family has a problem on
its hands. Her mother consults every member of the medical profession that
she can think of. None seem to be able to help the little girl, who
continues to get worse. One psychiatrist suggests that Regan's problems may
be more spiritual than mental. Since she thinks that she is possessed, he
suggests that maybe an exorcism might snap her out of it. Little do they
know, she really is sharing her body with something sinister. A Jesuit
priest who works at nearby Georgetown University as a psychiatrist is called
in to examine Regan. He decides that an exorcism is the girl's only hope.
The rest, as they say, is history. More specifically, the rest of the movie
focuses in on the exorcism. At the time, the exorcism scenes were some of
the scariest ever shot.</P>
<P>First let me say that I would like to nominate Ellen Burstyn for the William
Shatner award for overacting. This has got to be one of the worst
performances that I've ever seen in a film (and I've seen Pauley Shore
movies). Quite frankly, I didn't really find any of the characters in this
movie were particularly compelling. Although the performances of the priests
(Max Von Sydow and Jason Miller) who performed the exorcism, and Lee J.
Cobb, who played the police officer investigating the death of the
afore-mentioned deceased family friend, were decent. I have no idea why
Linda Blair became a star over this film. I can find nothing great in her
performance.</P>
<P>The Exorcist looks dated. It was made in the early seventies, and it is
really showing its age. Like most other "classic" horror films, The Exorcist
doesn't exactly fit my definition of a scary film. What might have been
shocking or even frightening nearly 30 years ago doesn't hold up today. The
characters spend far too much time talking about Regan's problems, and very
little time actually doing battle with the thing possessing her. My estimate
is that less than a half an hour is actually spent on things that might
have, at one time, been considered frightening. The only redeeming quality
about The Exorcist is that it involves the very real procedure of the rite
of exorcism. The Roman Catholic Church still practices this ritual to this
day. (In extremely limited circumstances.) I personally have always been
fascinated by this procedure, so some of the movie I found to be
interesting. But I don't generally watch a horror film for the knowledge.
Call me demanding, but I generally like a few scares, or at least a high
amount of tension. The Exorcist has neither.</P>
<P>The only thing that I got out of this movie was a little bit better
understanding of the Catholic Church's rite of exorcism. This is hardly a
compelling reason to recommend a horror film.</P>
