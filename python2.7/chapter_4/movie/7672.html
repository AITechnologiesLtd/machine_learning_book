<PRE>                          NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     NIGHT FALLS ON PLAUSIBILITY, oops I mean NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN
is the gritty new crime drama written and directed by Sidney Lumet.</P>
<P>     The key police witness chews gum on the witness stand in the
biggest case of the year.  An assistant DAs slaps his indigent client
when he isn't paying proper attention to the questions.  Police get
spooked and gun down another cop BONNIE AND CLYDE-style.  Police use
cocaine to pay off their stool pigeons so they can catch the big drug
dealer.</P>
<P>     And in the piece de resistance, Ron Leibman, as District Attorney
Morgenstern (Morgie) , climbs on top of a desk and, shamelessly
overacting, screams his orders to a hundred of his minions huddled
around him in a crowded hallway.  They will drop all of their cases and
work for 72 hours straight so that they can catch the drug dealer,
Jordan Washington (Shiek Mahmud-Bey), that killed some cops.</P>
<P>     When Jordan is caught, whom does Morgie appoint to try the highest
profile case in years?  Why, green Assistant DA Sean Casey (Andy
Garcia), whose father, Liam (Ian Holm), was wounded by Jordan.  Since
Morgie's chief prosecutor, Elihu Harrison (Colm Feore), might run
against him in the next election, Morgie gives the case to someone with
less than a year of experience.  And these are only a few of the
improbabilities.</P>
<P>     Holding back your laughter as one incredulous scene after an
another rolls across the screen is not easy.  Still the film affords
several guilty pleasures -- watching Garcia's hair being chief among
them.  In his casual scenes his bangs are carefully tossed in front of
his face in exactly the same way each time in order to avoid any
continuity errors.  When he dresses for business, the make-up
department uses a superglue-like gel to make sure that his hair stays
properly in its place.  Nuclear weapons could not move it in these
scenes.</P>
<P>     Even the ridiculous aspects of the film create laughable fun.
Peggy Lindstrom, the assistant to the William Kunstler clone defense
attorney, Sam Vigoda (Richard Dreyfuss), is played by the ever radiant
Lena Olin.  Before the trial's conclusion, she will take Sean to bed
solely because she has the hots for him.  This part of the plot leads
nowhere and only serves to titillate the audience.  Neither actor shows
any skin or much emotion.</P>
<P>     Ian Holm gives the only genuine and moving performance in what is
otherwise a plastic show, despite the realistic grimness of David
Watkin's cinematography and Philip Rosenberg's sets.</P>
<P>     The ultimate failing of the picture is Lumet's inability to ever
set the proper rhythm for the picture.  Individual parts of the plot
work, but they are never drawn into a convincing whole.  Couple this
with the picture's lack of energy, save the periodic overacting, and
the shows bogs down hopelessly with the weight of its implausibility.</P>
<P>     NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN runs 1:54.  It is rated R for violence
and profanity.  It would be fine for most teenagers.  The film has
little worth recommending so it's thumbs down and * 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
