<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>     The talents of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are terrific.  They
probably have more comic chemistry between the two of them than any other
comedy team working today.  They are about four weeks into making a sequel to
1968's 'The Odd Couple' which is scheduled to be released next year to
celebrate the 30th anniversary of the first film.  'Grumpy Old Men' (1993)
and 'Grumpier Old Men' (1995) are hilarious parodies on finding love late in
life and both actors excelled in those movies as well as they did many years
ago in 'The Fortune Cookie' (1966) for which Matthau won the Oscar as Best
Supporting Actor.  Lemmon directed Matthau in a touching and poignant story
of elderly life in 'Kotch' (1971) for which Matthau was nominated for Best
Actor.</P>
<P>     'Out to Sea' has the two buddies playing brothers in law.  Lemmon was
married to Matthau's sister and she is now deceased and widower Lemmon
reluctantly goes on a cruise with Matthau and innocently searches for love
while Matthau's got (quote) "lonely rich broads" (unquote) on his mind.  Upon
arriving aboard the cruise ship, Matthau informs Lemmon that instead of
paying for the cruise, he signed them both up as dance hosts.  Lemmon is
outraged and tries to get off the ship before it sails to no avail.  </P>
<P>     This movie has all the fun of a jack in the box with jokes popping up
everywhere and the comedy is equally funny both verbally and physically as
Lemmon and Matthau avoid giving the film edge and cruise along smoothly
(almost effortlessly) in their comic genius much in the way they did in the
'Grumpy' movies but their characters are much different and much more
attractive.  Director Martha Coolidge does an excellent job of keeping the
timing intact in all the routines and the closing credits feature outstanding
and hilarious outakes which are only appropriate to show in comedy films.  To
dislike this film would be difficult because its simplicity and wholesome
appeal is equal to spending a quiet afternoon with your grandparents.  It's a
joy.</P>
<P>     Other cast members include Dyan Cannon, Brent Spiner, Gloria  DeHaven,
Elaine Stritch, Hal Linden and dancing legend Donald O'Connor.</P>
