<P>Time and again, someone tries to discover America and its nether regions, 
hoping to make the definitive cultural statement about this country. The 
problem is that no one can make the definitive statement when America 
continually grows from one year to the next. Even the state I live in, New 
Jersey, is full of stories and historical backgrounds, going back several 
decades and centuries (read the cult magazine "Weird N.J." for a better 
perspective). The narrator of the film "Road Scholar" even states how times 
have changed in America in the last twenty years. "Now Spanish is spoken as 
much as English," the narrator observes. </P>
<P>The narrator is Andrei Codrescu, a Romanian-born Jew who became an American 
citizen in 1981. He is best known as an NPR commentator for the program, "All 
Things Considered," and is a well-known poet. He is witty, urbane, sarcastic, 
and shrewd. Andrei uses his satiric prose and poetic sensibilities to come up 
with his own interpretation of America by way of a cross-country road trip. 
He gets a driver's license, and is off in a cherry-red '68 Cadillac 
convertible to explore America. Andrei comes up against a community of 
Christian Communists in upstate New York, accustomed to poverty on the 
margins despite a profitable business; New Age mysticism, religious militant 
groups and Native American habitats in New Mexico; the virtually empty, 
economically ravaged city of Detroit; homeless, crack-addicted Haitian 
immigrants in New York City; last-minute marriages in Las Vegas (including 
drive-thru marriages!); a Vietnamese author in San Francisco who is aching to 
go back to his homeland; an artist who lawfully places a car in her lawn 
proclaiming it as a piece of art; and so on. </P>
<P>"Road Scholar" has enormous fun in arriving at these different locales and 
points of interest in America, and it is continuously absorbing in 
investigating different patterns of life. My major complaint is that certain 
vignettes could have benefited from more screen time, such as the Detroit 
artists who place shoes and sneakers on the streets as a reminder of people 
who once populated a sparsely populated, poor neighborhood. There is also too 
much time invested on New Mexico mystics and healers - I used to live in 
Santa Fe and have had enough exposure to them. They are pure "kitsch," as 
Codrescu often refers to certain aspects of life or to the Statue of Liberty. 
Other moments show the loss of innocence in America, as in the traveling bus 
of peace-loving denizens who want to bring back the 60's free love ideals and 
such without benefit of drugs. I also found a strangely melancholic passage 
in the depiction of lost dreams in Detroit. One example is the movement of 
Motown sound from Detroit to the big leagues and how it affected an entire 
community who felt the music was theirs. In fact, the Detroit section of the 
film is the most astute as one gathers understanding of how America can let 
go of one of their cities in times of economic hardships. </P>
<P>If this were just an ordinary documentary about America in the 90's, it would 
have worked just fine with its look at people of different nationalities. 
Alas, using Andre as a witty commentator on the scene enlivens the 
proceedings enormously - he is sometimes sardonic but he also identifies with 
most of the people, particularly the immigrants who came to this country in 
hopes of fulfilling their dreams. Some did, and many did not. Andre became a 
poet and wrote books, and was allowed to have the power of freethinking 
without getting arrested. His story is just as insightful, and proves just as 
entertaining. He also recognizes, as reminded to him by the late poet Allen 
Ginsberg, that America is "an Indian thing." For a relatively fast-paced, 
inspirational tour of America, you can do no better than "Road Scholar." </P>
