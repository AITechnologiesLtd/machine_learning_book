<PRE>                                 CLOSET LAND
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  A great idea for a film disappointingly
     squandered.  This is a two-person play about a woman accused
     of treason and a government interrogator trying to force her
     to sign a confession.  This could have been a powerful
     statement for Amnesty International, but its special power is
     lost on far-fetched plot contrivances and misjudgements in
     atmosphere.  It's still worth seeing, though.  Rating: 0 (-4
     to +4).</P>
<P>     Charlie Brown asked it after a particularly bad performance by his
baseball team: "How can we lose if we're so sincere?"  Sad to say, sincerity
is not enough.  Radha Bharadwaj wrote the play CLOSET LAND and directed the
film with what I am sure was nothing but great sincerity and the best of
intentions.  And if this film had been done correctly, it would have been a
film that is desperately needed with what is a very important message.  That
message is blunted with what turns out to be a contrived plot and a set of
unbelievable circumstances.</P>
<P>     In an unnamed country a woman (played by Madelaine Stowe) has been
kidnapped and is brought before an interrogator (played by Alan Rickman).
At first it appears to have all been a mistake.  She is non-political--a
simple writer of children's stories.  One of the stories, "Closet Land"--
still unpublished--has fallen into the hands of the government.  They
interpret it as a bitter anti-government allegory and now the government
wants the woman to sign a confession of sedition.  She is put through a
mind-numbing succession of mental and physical tortures to debase and
humiliate her in an attempt to get her to sign.</P>
<P>     So far, so good.  If that was all there was to this film it would be a
painful film to watch but it would make a powerful statement for Amnesty
International, for whose benefit this film seems to have been made.  The
incident portrayed here could be seen to be in many ways typical of crimes
committed by far too many governments today.  This view of government
political sadism is and should be a bitter pill to swallow.  But there is
more of a plot to CLOSET LAND than that and there is where the film goes
frustratingly wrong, making this incident anything but typical.</P>
<P>     When we see the real reasons behind the woman writing her story "Closet
land" and the real motives of the interrogator, both seem extremely
contrived and built around an incredible coincidence.  The interrogator
pulls off a number of odd deceptions; some require talents beyond even the
capabilities of Rickman to bring off.  One doubts that a man as talented as
the interrogator would become a government interrogator/torturer.  Surely we
are not meant to believe most people in this profession are this
intelligent.  Further undercutting the credibility is the set design of the
interrogation center.  One suspects in real life such places are at best
utilitarian.  This chamber, with its fancy furniture, its sound and light
equipment, its decorative columns, its functional yet decorative file
drawers, creates just the wrong feel.</P>
<P>     What is needed is a story that one can tell oneself is being  repeated
on a daily basis in many countries around the world.  Instead, we have a
story we doubt could have ever happened.  That makes this film a curiosity
rather than a powerful statement.  I give it a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
