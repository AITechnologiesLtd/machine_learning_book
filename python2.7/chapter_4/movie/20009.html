<PRE>METROLAND (Lions Gate Films)
Directed by Philip Saville</PRE>
<PRE>         "Would you still love me, no matter what I did?"</PRE>
<PRE> "You must be joking."</PRE>
<P> If you thought that exchange was taken from director Stanley
Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut," you're wrong, but not terribly far off the
mark. It's actually from "Metroland," a British drama based on Julian
Barnes' 1980 novel. Both "Metroland" and "Eyes" deal with a comfortable
marriage jeopardized by temptation, but whereas Kubrick's film had the
wife (Nicole Kidman) instigating the conflict, in "Metroland" it's the
husband who opens Pandora's box.</P>
<P> "Metroland" is set in 1977. Chris (Christian Bale) has settled
down comfortably in a middle-class London suburb with his wife Marion
(Emily Watson) and their baby daughter. He's got the job, the mortgage,
the car payments, the backyard garden and all that goes with it. Then
Chris' old pal Toni (Lee Ross) shows up, still living the swinging life
in his mid-30s. Now Chris has something else to deal with: self-doubt.</P>
<P> He flashes back to his days in Paris almost a decade ago, when
he wore black turtlenecks, attended Truffaut movies and dreamed of being
a photographer. Did he make the right choice in leaving behind that
bohemian lifestyle for the safety and tranquility of his homeland? Would
he have been happier had he stuck with his free-spirited French lover
Annica (Elsa Zylberstein), instead of abandoning her to go off with
Marion? The primary difference between the character of Chris in
"Metroland" and Bill (Tom Cruise) in "Eyes" is that while Bill went
looking for thrills in the present day, Chris is probing his past,
looking back on what he's already done.</P>
<P> "Metroland" is likely to strike a chord with a lot of young
husbands, especially those who find themselves sometimes envying their
single friends. Though the movie is considerably more straightforward
than "Eyes" and doesn't have an enormous amount of ground-breaking
information to impart about making marriages work, Bale and Watson are
utterly credible, as is the beguiling Zylberstein in a role that might
have gone to Teri Garr 15 years ago.</P>
<P> Adrian Hodges' script manages to mix a bit of fantasy into
Chris' mundane existance without throwing off the tone of the film, but
his real strength is his dialogue; some of his words have surprising
sting. Especially memorable is the first conversation between Chris and
Marion, in which he insists he'll never get married and live in the
suburbs. "I think you will," she tells him. "You're not original enough
not to."  James Sanford</P>
