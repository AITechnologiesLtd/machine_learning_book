<P>     Imagine a country where few people had ever seen an Arnold
Schwarzenegger film (it's hypothetical, work with me here).  Imagine that
ERASER was the first of his films to get a wide release there, and that it
became a moderate success.  If you have the rights to COMMANDO, TRUE LIES,
the TERMINATOR films and all the rest, think of what a gold mine you would
suddenly find yourself sitting on.  That is Miramax's good fortune after
RUMBLE IN THE BRONX finally became Hong Kong action legend Jackie Chan's
American breakthrough, and RUMBLE was supposed to be one of Chan's weaker
efforts.  SUPERCOP has the same high-flying action as RUMBLE, a much
stronger story, a bit less of a sense of absurd fun, and presents the
distraction of terrible dubbing.</P>
<P>    In SUPERCOP, Jackie Chan plays Kevin Chan, a Hong Kong police
detective selected for a dangerous undercover assignment.  Working in
conjunction with the Chinese government, and their Chief of Security Yang
(Michelle Khan), Kevin infiltrates a drug ring by helping one of its
leaders, Panther (Yuen Wah) to escape from prison.  With Yang posing as
his sister, Kevin is brought into the cartel's inner circle, including its 
ruthless leader Chaibat (Ken Tsang).  The only potential problem:  Kevin's
girlfriend May (Maggie Cheung), who is unaware of his assignment, and
inadvertently threatens to blow his cover.</P>
<P>     SUPERCOP is actually the third film in the popular POLICE STORY
series, but that is almost as relevant to the story as it was when Steven
Seagal did UNDER SIEGE 2.  Jackie Chan, for the most part, is about a
persona, not a character.  His goofy grins and self-deprecating manner
make him a uniquely likeable action hero, and his ability to get out of
impossible situations often seems as much a product of resourcefulness as
sheer physical ability.  As amazing as some of his fight sequences can be,
he is just as appealing in scenes like the one in which he is taken by
Panther to the home town of his undercover identity, and forced to
improvise with the assistance of several "family members" he has never
seen before.</P>
<P>     Chan's sense of humor is such an asset that it is unfortunate
SUPERCOP doesn't integrate it into the story very smoothly.  In many ways,
SUPERCOP is a straightforward formula action film of the kind we tend to
see a lot of in America, with evil drug lords, can-you-top-this stunts and
a minimum of distracting characterization.  When director Stanley Tong
decides it's time for comic relief, he tends to stop SUPERCOP in its
tracks for funny business like the aforementioned visit to the phony home
town, or for a squabble between Kevin and may which results in the
ever-popular shove into a swimming pool.  RUMBLE IN THE BRONX may have
been silly, but it was silly start to finish, and Chan's fight sequences
were part of the humor.  SUPERCOP feels more divided, half Jackie Chan the
action hero and half Jackie Chan the clown.</P>
<P>     To give SUPERCOP its due, there are some significant ways in which it
is more than a typical American action film, and nowhere is that more
evident than in the presence of Michelle Khan (Michelle Yeoh to her Hong
Kong fans).  Capable female action stars are a non-entity in Hollywood,
but Khan packs a wallop both literally and in her screen presence.  Yang
never seems to be just a foil or a sidekick for Kevin; she is a partner,
and saves his skin as often as he saves hers.  She also gets two of
SUPERCOP's best stunts -- a leap onto a moving truck, and a motorcycle
jump onto a train -- providing just some of the thrilling action moments
typical of Chan's films.  It is also a lean and mean 85 minutes; American
action directors could take a lesson in efficient editing.</P>
<P>     Action has always translated well on an international level, which
makes it all the more annoying when making a film like SUPERCOP acceptable
to American viewers requires dubbing which seems to have been recorded in
a tin outhouse (although a theme song by Devo is almost as baffling).  If
Miramax is serious about making Chan's films an American staple, they
should consider investing in some decent sound mixing.  Solid efforts like
SUPERCOP will continue to build Jackie Chan's audience; now it's time to
bring on the big guns.  Anyone for POLICE STORY 1, 2 or 4?</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Chan's encounters:  7.</PRE>
