<P>     Harvey Keitel re-teams with feminist director Jane Campion for another
journey back to the land down under. This time Keitel is the world's best
"cult deprogrammer" and his subject is a religiously confused Kate Winslet.</P>
<P>Holy Smoke is one of those art films that probably won't appeal to the
biggest of audiences because of its tone and harsh storyline. Kate Winslet
continues to grow as an actress with this risky and risqué venture. But it's
her spirit and screen presence which brought me in. As her emotions and
beliefs crossed with her parents, we began to actually see the two worlds at
war for this young girl. These were magical scenes which Campion did a
wonderful job with. But as Campion delivers a generous telling of the story
and makes it very compassionate and direct for us, we are shocked when
Keitel's man's man drop his pants in a comfort scene. And you begin to
wonder if this guy is a professional and if he should be looking after a
vulnerable young woman. Both in 1996's Portrait of a Lady and in 1993's
Piano, we saw this destruction of a man. And Campion continues her escapade
here as Keitel delivers quotes of morals but never really believes a word.
He self-destructs and delivers his own fiery flight into the flesh of an
innocent woman. What made me really cringe was the running time on Keitel's
destruction. Campion would never let up and this reminded me a lot of the
Piano as well. Is Campion saying that women destroy men or that men destroy
themselves with sex? Another begging question is why did a fully nude
Winslet have to deliver a "golden shower" before they could embrace and seal
his eminent fate? Is this a symbolism of a lost vulnerability and innocence?
A cross-dressing Keitel screams after a shoeless Winslet as they stumble
through the Australian outback this results in his final undoing and her
final deliverance from him. A lot of clouded symbolism and half truths had
me scratching my head. Or maybe "Holy Smoke" just isn't for everyone. (2.5
of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.</P>
