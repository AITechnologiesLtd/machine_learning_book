<PRE>                           THE FIRST WIVES CLUB
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     The biggest crowd-pleaser of the year is upon us -- the powerhouse
trio of Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, and Diane Keaton foisting their
womanness on us with a vengeance.  Sure to revive the debate over
whether films like this are "man hating," THE FIRST WIVES CLUB is, in
reality, a harmless big screen sitcom that actually manages to appeal to
a large audience.</P>
<P>     Rambling through its first 30 minutes with no real direction, THE
FIRST WIVES CLUB eventually turns into a story about three old friends
who want to exact vengeance on their wayward ex-husbands.  Elise (Hawn)
is an aging movie star, obsessed, as most aging movie stars are, about
her looks.  Brenda (Midler) is a bitter ex-housewife who loves her son
and bemoans her lack of funds to support him -- and hasn't changed her
hair since 1969.  Annie (Keaton) is basically a middle-aged version of
Annie Hall, only now she has a lesbian daughter and an intrusive mother,
and Woody Allen is nowhere to be seen.</P>
<P>     The most visible of the ex-husbands is Brenda's estranged hubby
Morty (Dan Hedaya), an electronics kingpin who has moved on to the
greener pastures of Shelly (Sarah Jessica Parker).  He becomes the
centerpiece of an intricate scam the women put together to basically
drive the three husbands to madness, ruin, and poverty.</P>
<PRE>     Hey!  It's a comedy!</PRE>
<P>     I must admit, that for all its middle-aged woman-bent humor, THE
FIRST WIVES CLUB still managed to be amusing to this 25 year-old man,
mainly due to some really fine acting, good jokes, and a fresh story. 
Keaton is the best, as usual, and Hawn also does a fine job. 
Desperately trying to steal the show (and ending up as the only wife who
I didn't really care about) is Midler.  But when was the last time
Midler played a character who *wasn't* an overbearing loudmouth?</P>
<P>     It's also a manipulative little film -- pulling those heart strings
about as hard as you can without jumping out of the comedy genre.  There
are loads of cameos -- the only person they forgot was Charles Nelson
Reilly.  Basically, everything works to give WIVES a sitcom feel (I
wouldn't be surprised if they adapted it next season...).  Just to seal
the issue, they even put Bronson Pinchot in a supporting role.  (Ironic
fact:  almost everyone behind the scenes of the film (including the
director, screenwriter, and producer) is male.)</P>
<P>     Parting words of advice:  Guys, prepare yourselves to be dragged to
the movie theater by your wife or girlfriend.  Ladies, please don't get
any bright ideas.</P>
<PRE>     Rating the film is almost impossible.  Here's my best cut at it:</PRE>
<PRE>If you're a woman: ****
If you're a divorcee: ****1/2
If you're a bitter divorcee: *****</PRE>
<PRE>On its merits:</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***1/2</PRE>
<PRE>|------------------------------|
 \ ***** Perfection             \
  \ **** Good, memorable film    \
   \ *** Average, hits and misses \
    \ ** Sub-par on many levels    \
     \ * Unquestionably awful       \
