<P>Susan Granger's review of "SNOW DAY" (Paramount Pictures/Nickelodeon)</P>
<P>        What kid hasn't listened to the radio for that oft-anticipated 
but rarely realized announcement: "Schools are closed. It's a snow day!"?</P>
<P>After a groan from the grown-ups, the fun begins. But how to spend a
lovely snow day? For the Brandstons of Syracuse, there are many
possibilities.  Dad (Chevy Chase) is a TV meteorologist, actually the
wacky weatherman who predicted that an unexpected blizzard would hit
the area. Mom (Jean Smart) is attached to her cellphone, working on a
business deal in Beijing. So 15 year-old Hal (Mark Webber) is free to
pursue the perfect girl of his dreams (Emmanuelle Chiqui), who has
never acknowledged his existence, while taking for granted the genial
companionship of his best friend (Schuyler Fisk, daughter of Sissy
Spacek). Hal's 10 year-old sister (Zena Grey) has a bigger ambition:
she's seriously determined to defeat the demonic Snowplowman (Chris
Elliott), a suburban Darth Vader in a ten-ton truck who haunts the
kids' snow days. He has a pet crow, his rig's called Clementine, and
legend has it that he makes chains for his tires from the braces of
kids he's run over. And Hal's brother (Connor Matheus), the terrible
toddler, just wants to go outside and play. Writers Will McRobb &
Chris Viscardi and director Chris Koch deliver slippery slapstick
sketches with only a few slushy moments. Yeah, there are flatulence
jokes but they get big laughs from the smallfry audience. And the
adults snicker when they recognize punker Iggy Pop as the ice rink DJ,
playing old Al Martino records. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
Snow Day is a flaky 5 - silly, wintry fun for the kids and not too bad
for their parents either.</P>
