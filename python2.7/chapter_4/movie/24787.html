<PRE>TIME CODE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>For those who think that what movies need today are more elaborate
gimmicks, TIME CODE is the answer, since it is nothing but one long,
insufferable gimmick.  Simultaneously using 4 digital cameras shooting
without stopping until their 90 minute tapes ran out, director Mike
Figgis (LEAVING LAS VEGAS and THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE) made 4
movies which he displays in static quadrants on the theater screen.</P>
<P>Collectively these 4 movies form one story with the characters moving
freely between the sections of the screen.  The most exciting parts are
when the characters place cell phone calls across quadrants for a little
chitchat.</P>
<P>The result is the artistic type of experiment that seems designed to put
film critics in ecstasy over the movie's showy, avant-garde techniques.
The film would seem destined to be played and discussed ad nauseam at
college film courses.</P>
<P>It should be pointed out that one can achieve almost the same effect any
afternoon at your local Sears store by turning 4 adjoining television
sets on 4 different soap operas.  Yes, this approach will not permit the
interaction between frames, but soap operas are so alike that you can
easily imagine that the characters in the various shows are conversing.</P>
<P>Most viewers, however, will be more likely to point out TIME CODE's two
fatal flaws.  First, none of the stories in TIME CODE are worth
including in a normal movie.  Most of the stories will have viewers
alternating between wondering what they are about and not caring what
the answer is.  Second, although having multiple screens is undeniably
cute, it is just a distraction.  Sony's new marketing campaign suggests
that viewers see the movie four times, watching a different quadrant at
each session.  Since it's only the interaction between the quadrants
that make the story the least bit compelling, concentrating on one would
be painful.</P>
<P>The large, stellar cast improvise their parts based on a written
outline.  In one segment Jeanne Tripplehorn is a rich, jealous lover who
suspects that Salma Hayek is unfaithful.  Figgis raises the audio level
in the quadrant on which he would like us to focus, but even when he
tries to get our eyes elsewhere, it's hard to look away as these two
actresses in the back of a limo play kissy-face like a pair of
love-struck teens.</P>
<P>The only completely satisfying part of the production is the music,
especially a long, dreamy section of a Gustav Mahler symphony.  Closing
your eyes enhances the pleasure, but you run the risk of falling asleep.
This is also a problem with your eyes open.</P>
<P>One of the stories involves the casting of a new movie called BITCH FROM
LOUISIANA.  The producer for that film pitches another idea of his.  He
wants to make a film called TIME TOILET, a sci-fi comedy in which human
waste will travel across time once it is flushed away.  I would rather
have seen that movie than TIME CODE.</P>
<P>TIME CODE runs a slow 1:30.  It is rated R for drug use, sexuality,
language and a scene of violence and would be acceptable for older
teens.</P>
