<PRE>LARA CROFT:  TOMB RAIDER
------------------------</PRE>
<P>Lady Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie, "Gone in 60 Seconds") lives in a
mind-numbingly huge British estate with her butler Hilary (Chris Barrie of 
the British series "Red Dwarf"), who attempts to get her to dress more
femininely, and personal techno-geek Bryce (Noah Taylor, "Shine"), who
devises things like a huge killer robot (straight out of "Robocop") to
keep Lara at the top of her game.  That game is tomb raiding for antiquities,
a career taught her by her beloved, now deceased dad (Jon Voight, Jolie's
real father).  A once-every-5,000 years convergence of the planets combined
with the discovery of a ticking 'key' sets Lara off on her latest worldwide
adventure to stop the evil Illuminati from stealing the power of time itself in
"Lara Croft:  Tomb Raider."</P>
<P>Having never played the videogame, I have a question - is the name Lara Croft 
code for Large Cups?  Angelina Jolie, with the help of some bust boosting,
personifies the vidgame heroine - a tough, motorcycle riding chick with an
inhuman figure encased in tight clothing and a personal arsenal.  She can
apparently hear the ticking of a clock encased within a stairwell from 100
yards and a sound sleep, pull in favors from secret ops groups and beat the
living daylights out of a score of men firing a hail of bullets at her without
suffering a scratch, yet doesn't have the sense to employ Bryce to protect
the key to earth's destruction from being stolen.</P>
<P>Screenwriter Michael Colleary ("Face/Off") has provided an idiotic premise
that trots Lara to Cambodia (where huge stone temple creatures come to life
only to be shattered like clay pots by a bullet or two), Venice (for no reason
whatsoever other than to have a conversation with bland bad guy Manfred Powell 
(Iain Glen, "Beautiful Creatures")) and Iceland (to look cool dog-sledding
before an inane climax right out of "The Avengers").  His one good idea is
to surprise the audience when a second shower scene doesn't pan down to the
figure we expect.</P>
<P>Cinematographer Peter Menzies Jr., blessed with these exotic locations, 
serves up a muddy looking, visually bland film.  Simon West's ("Con Air," 
"The General's Daughter") direction is so flat-footed, that boredom sets
in just as Lara's adventure is beginning.  Not a single member of the cast
is given an opportunity to breath life into their characters, although
Daniel Craig ("I Dreamed of Africa") shows a glimmer that somehow got past
West as Lara's former boyfriend, mercenary tomb raider Alex Marrs.</P>
<P>Sitting through "Lara Croft:  Tomb Raider" had me wishing I'd brought a 
PlayStation to the theater because the entertainment sure wasn't on the 
screen.</P>
