<P>   Photographer Chedli Chaouachi spares little effort to make the
complicated and often heartbreaking film, "The Season of Men,"
into a travelogue.  There is nothing here to coax Westerners,
already wary of traveling to Tunisia, to any of its tourist locations,
particularly Djerba--which resembles nothing more than a barren
location whose people have nothing to do but weave carpets.  In
one brief scene, a blonde tourist, presumably from France (which
afford the small North African country the lion's share of tourist
income), is gyrating in a discotheque, but otherwise we see little of
the capital city of Tunis or the sun-drenched island of Djerba to
the south of the country.  Moufida Tlatli, who wrote and directed
the family-centered story, has more important items on his
agenda in a story that will strike us in the non-Islamic nations of
the world with one well-represented theme: that of family
dysfunction.  Added to the usual conflicts that break out among its
women, also including the unhappy men is the clash between
traditional Islamic ways and the modern culture.</P>
<P>   If this film had centered in modern-day Afghanistan, no such
conflict would have existed, given the complete repression which
the Taliban-governed country has imposed on its people.  But in
Tunisia, which second to Turkey comes across as already one of
the most liberated states in the Muslim world, the struggle
between young women who crave a freer way of life and their
patriarchs (and older matriarchs) who rule over them is hardly
subtle.</P>
<P>   Flashing back and forth between the current year and the life of
a family circle ten and fifteen years ago, Tlatli's film observes two
generations in the same family who are at odds with each other
and in at least one dramatic case with itself.  Aicha (Rabiaa Ben
Abdallah) is shows a decade earlier weaving carpets on the island
of Djerba for sale by her husband, Said (Ezzedine Gennoun), in
Tunis.  Like most of the women in the family, Aicha is living apart
from her husband, who visits only once a year at which time the
females, alternately brooding and laughing in their daily
companionship with one another desperately hope to become
pregnant.  Aicha has a young son, Aziz (Adel Hergal), whom only
a mother could love: he is autistic, mute and difficult to manage. 
Aicha's problems are compounded by her tyrannical mother-in-
law, who does want the island home to be reduced to a workshop, 
and pushes her power to the limit in demanding that Aicha's
young daughter, Emna (Lilia Falket), remain home instead of
going to school.</P>
<P>   The plight of the women is seen in the present time as the
grown Emna ( Hend Sabri), a professional violinist, is in love with
the conductor (who refuses to divorce his wife) and appears
misogamistic, given the dead marriages of the women she has
known for a decade or more.  Other suffering women including
Aicha's sexually-frustrated friend Zeineb (Sabah Bouzoutia),
whose husband left her for good and is living in France and who
suffers from psychomatic pain throughout her body, and Emna's
sister Meriem (Ghalia Ben Ali), who as a child was almost raped
and now refuses to consummate her six-months'-old marriage to a
man who is losing patience.</P>
<P>   "The Season of Men" relates to the one month of the year that
the men who are working in Tunis visit their wives but could
describe as well the permanent condition of the male gender in
the conservative Islamic world.  The story is moving, its principal
drawback being the confusing ways that Tlatli shifts back and forth
in time.</P>
