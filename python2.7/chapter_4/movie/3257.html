<PRE>                            MURDER IN THE FIRST
                       A film review by Scott Tobias
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Tobias</PRE>
<P>     There's a good, and timely, story trapped deep within the excess
of MURDER IN THE FIRST, a new movie about the abuses of our prison
system.  With a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime
issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy,
this expose would offer something rare to recent American movies--a
point of view.</P>
<P>     But director Marc Rocco makes it clear from the beginning that
pretentious, often nauseating, camera movements and slick, MTV- style
lighting and editing are far more important.  There's not a moment in
the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling.  And
everything suffers.</P>
<P>     Christian Slater and Kevin Bacon star as defense attorney and
Alcatraz inmate, respectively.  After spending an unprecedented amount
of time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape, Bacon murders
another prisoner and faces trial.  His young lawyer (Slater) is fresh
out of law school but determined to "put Alcatraz on trial" for the
abuses of it warden (Gary Oldman).  The result is the usual courtroom
theatrics- imagine a Stanley Kramer production shot by hyperactive film
school students.</P>
<P>     There's very little to praise here outside of Kevin Bacon's
earnest overacting and the appropriate story.  There's a lot of
overacting from everyone--you know you're in trouble right away when
R. Lee Ermey (the drill sergeant in FULL METAL JACKET) is cast as a
judge, the center of reason and moderation.  Slater has never been
convincing and certainly isn't here and Oldman is on a bad streak of
hammy performances.</P>
<P>     But the worst feeling you get while watching MURDER IN THE FIRST
is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good
story.  There are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not
even moving near the characters, let alone with them.  How frustrating
it must be for actors to work under these conditions.</P>
<P>     If there's anything that has alway distinguished American films
over the rest of the world, it is our ability to tell a good story.
Have we forgotten?</P>
