<PRE>                                 BORDELLO OF BLOOD
                       A film review by Paul-Michael Agapow
                        Copyright 1997 Paul-Michael Agapow</PRE>
<P>The second outing from the "Tales From the Crypt" crew: the prim
Katherine (Eleniak) works for moneyed evangelist Reverend Current
(Sarandon).  However her brother (Feldman) has gone missing and
she turns to sleazy two-bit detective Guttman (Miller).  He in
turn is lead to a funeral home which is a front for a brothel run
by arch-vampire Lillith (Everhart) ...</P>
<P>There is a big problem at the heart of the "Tales from the
Crypt" formula , TV and movies, which is difficult to put a
finger on.  But the epicenter is this: for the writers (4 on
"Bordello of Blood") and producers (11!)  this is not so much an
attempt to create a new story as it is to slavishly imitate a
genre.  Or perhaps to slavishly imitate their idea of a genre.
Thirty years ago, cheap and nasty four-colour comics titillated
15 year-olds.  Now those 15 year-olds have translated the comics
to the big screen, with much sentiment and little creativity.</P>
<PRE>It's not scary.
It's not meant to be scary, you say.
It's not very dramatic.
It's not supposed to be dramatic, you reply.
It's not especially funny.
It's not really a comedy, you explain.
So what is it?</PRE>
<P>In fact "Bordello of Blood" is not much of anything. Even at
the very concise runtime of 87 minutes (around 80 if you cut out
the superfluous shrieking bookends by that muppet with Tourettes,
the Cryptkeeper) it has barely enough to do.  The creators are
simply trading on the resonances of the movie, wanting you to say
"This is just like those old schlocky horror films and comics!
Great!"  But as the current revival of old TV favourites (Brady
Bunch, Flintstones, the Saint etc.)  demonstrates, bringing a
small idea to the big screen with big production values does not
necessarily make that idea big.  More the converse - a movie
length production demands movie size ideas and story, not just
money.  Those are things that "Bordello" ain't got.</P>
<P>Occasionally "Bordello" does spark, never to the extent that
its predecessor "Demon Knight" did, largely when some meta-joke
occurs.  Confronted with the vampiric bordello, the detective
Guttman starts theorising "duchovnian riffs".  Teenybopper
heartthrob Corey Feldman shows up just long enough to be
slaughtered mercilessly.  The cast is competent if unspectacular,
Eleniak and Everhart being present purely for their looks.
Sarandon alone shows some life, perhaps being not a great actor
but a good one.</P>
<P>About the worst thing you could say about "Bordello of Blood"
is that it's self-indulgent and largely harmless.  Perhaps the
"Tales" producers will retire the series or at least think more
before hauling it out next time.  [*/misfire] and velvet-covered
furniture on the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
