<PRE>                                   COPYCAT
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Hot on the heels of SEVEN, another very unconventional thriller
has arrived in theaters:  COPYCAT, an equally creepy film with the
thematic premise that there really are an awful lot of sick people out
there.</P>
<P>     Judging from COPYCAT, there's more of them than we're giving
credit to.  COPYCAT is the story of a serial killer apparently chasing
psychologist Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver).  The only problem is,
some thirteen months earlier, another killer (Harry Connick, Jr.)
almost got her, and the experience was enough for her to lock herself
into her snazzy apartment for good.  When killer #2 comes around, two
detectives, M.J.  (Holly Hunter) and Ruben (Dermot Mulroney) try to
solve the mystery.  This is a much more disturbing and difficult task
than it first seems, entangling everyone in an intensely engaging plot
full of surprises and "rule-breaking" twists.</P>
<P>     The acting in COPYCAT is top-notch.  Even the normally blas
Mulroney seems to be remarkably cognizant of his surroundings and
manages to bring his character to life.  Weaver is typically good,
nearly reprising her fabulous role in DEATH AND THE MAIDEN, but Hunter
frequently steals the show from everyone.  Connick is immensely
disturbing in his small part, with which he obviously had a lot of fun;
you won't hear his crooning the same again.  Jon Amiel's direction is
similarly good.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, much like SEVEN, COPYCAT has a number of *long*
periods of expository drama at its beginning, plainly attempting to
replicate the cool interaction among the characters in THE SILENCE OF
THE LAMBS.  This is where SEVEN and COPYCAT both failed:  it's simply
impossible to figure out why the killer is that interested in the
heroes, or to become that enthralled with them ourselves.  Luckily, by
the time we hit 45 minutes, the almost painful suspense has far
overtaken the sappy melodrama.</P>
<P>     And that suspense is worth it.  COPYCAT is well-paced and
inevitably reaches a nail-biting conclusion that I wouldn't dare
reveal.  Not to mention, the film actually has the first really
worthwhile denouement I've seen in years.  Be sure to stick around
until you see the credits roll.</P>
