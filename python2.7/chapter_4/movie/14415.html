<PRE> Reviewed by Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 Artisan Entertainment
 Director: Ken Loach
 Writer: Ken Loach
 Cast: Louise Goodall, Peter Mullan</PRE>
<P>   There are probably those who will say that Ken Loach is a
director more to be respected than enjoyed. It's not that we in
the audience need to see Mary Poppins feel-good movies all
the time to consider ourselves entertained.  After all, the
current film festival in Toronto featured a spate of hard-edged,
cynical works about dysfunctional families including one which
Universal refused to allow its subsidiary, October films, to
release.  But Loach's view of British working-class society
is so bleak, with such unresolved conclusions, that we
sometimes long for closure, for some tying up of the loose
threads by the time we leave the theater.</P>
<P>   "My Name is Joe" is an example of such a movie, one
which will appeal mightily to the right audience because of the
superior acting by its principal performer and its bitter bite of
reality.  What's more the story becomes increasingly involving
and the romantic relationship it underscores is treated with
such authenticity that it is far more believable than those
invented by the Hollywood fantasy-factory.  Loach remains so
true to his portrayals of the lumpenproletarians of his country
that once again--as in "Carla's Song"--the Scottish dialect is
all but unintelligible (think "Trainspotting") to Americans. 
Happily, though, the situation is remedied by the use of
subtitles.</P>
<P>   The tale centers on Joe Kavanagh (Peter Mullan), a 37-
year-old guy who is balding but manly and looks every bit the
hale-fellow soccer coach that he portrays.  With his fine
appearance and compassion, he should not have had
problems, but he is a recovering alcoholic who has been on
the wagon for ten months and who is following the 12-step
problem of Alcoholics Anonymous religiously.  He has a keen
interest in the young men he coaches, working-class fellows
with a knack for getting into fights over nothing on the football
field.  [He will soon find himself in deep trouble for going to
the defense of one foolhardy friend, Liam (Davie McKay).] 
His life changes dramatically when he falls in love with a pert,
middle-aged health worker, Sarah Downie (Louise Goodall), a
woman who doles out solid advice to poor women trying to
care for their infants.  Unattached herself, she is gradually
drawn into Joe's orbit and seems relatively accepting when
Joe remorsefully relates an incident that occurred during one
of his drunken blackouts when he punched and kicked his girl
friend.  His relationship with Sarah comes to crucial point
when he goes to the aid of Liam, who is heavily in debt to the
local drug lord, McGowan (David Hayman) and who is trying
to make a go of his marriage to his volatile, drug-addicted
wife Sabine (Anne-Marie Kennedy).</P>
<P>   Loach's current work, a sensitive, intimate portrayal of the
difficulties faced by the lower working-class of Glasgow,
highlights the self-defeating but good-hearted foolishness of
its principal character.  In a previous offering, "Carla's Song,"
bus driver George (Robert Carlyle) goes through with a
quixotic scheme of running after the love of his life who has
gone to Nicaragua to find her own boy friend.  Similarly, while
chasing after his romantic interest, Joe risks his very life and
by doing so endangers his connection with a wonderful
woman who could turn his days around.  </P>
<P>   The movie is not without humor, some verbal, as when Joe
tells Sarah why he, a man with limited education, plays
classical music at home--in his wilder days he stole boxes of
cassettes and sold the country and western; he could not get
rid of the Beethovens.</P>
<P>   While the story begins with a loose texture to define the
daily routine of these down-and-out Gaswegians--the long
waits at the medical clinics, the refusal of doctors to grant
prescriptions, the power of gangs over basically decent
people--Loach tightens the narrative, building the tension to a
catastrophic, climactic scene.  This is obviously the work of a
man whom the BBC at one time refused to produce: his
"Cathy Comes Home" was apparently too raw a slice of
London life for its listeners.  Unlike "Carla's Song," none of
the dialogue comes across as improvised and though Loach's
left-leaning politics is implied it is not as obvious as it was in
that Nicaragua-based romance.  Even if bleak dramas of this
sort are not your cup of tea, you'll have to admire Peter
Mullan's first-rate acting, a performance which gained him the
Best Actor award at the last Cannes festival.  His is the sort
of accomplishment that could not be duplicated by one suited
to more commercial dramas, such as Malcolm McDowell and
Terence Stamp, who were, in fact, responsible for the failure
of the director's "Poor Cow."</P>
