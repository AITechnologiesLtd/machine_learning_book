<P>"The Rangers taking their off-time to go to some cold village and play
pond hockey with eskimos: it's a joke!"</P>
<P>Starring Russell Crowe, Burt Reynolds, Colm Meaney, Hank Azaria, Mary
McKormick, Lolita Davidovich, Maury Chaykin. Rated R.</P>
<P>After watching Mystery, Alaska, I decided to do a little research. I
ventured over to the Internet Movie Database, the premier source of
movie information on the net, to test a theory. I searched for movies
and tv series about hockey, baseball, football, and basketball. When I
searched for baseball, it returned 145 movies and tv shows. Football
gave me 145 and basketball came up with 68. But when I did a search on
hockey, the result was a measly 44 references. Why is hockey so
underrepresented in pop culture? Hard to say, but while audiences seem
to be tired of sports movies of late, a hockey film or two is not
unwelcome, provided it doesn't have the words "Mighty Ducks" in the
title.</P>
<P>Mystery, Alaska is a hockey town. Life revolves around the "Saturday
Game", a weekly pond hockey match-up. It's not a competition. They
don't keep score. The teams are decided at random. The game is more
than a tradition: it's a legend, a way of life. A veteran of
the "Saturday Game", John Biebe, who has played for some thirteen years
is about to be honorably discharged. He's a good player, but he is
getting old and his agility on skates isn't what it used to be. He has
to be liquidated to make room for an ambitious up-and-comer, a lighting-
fast high-schooler with relationship issues.</P>
<P>Just then, a cocky former Mystery resident who has abandoned the town
for a career in Hollywood returns -- on a helicopter, no less. But he
doesn't come empty-handed. He brings word that the New York Rangers are
going to fly to Alaska for a game of pond hockey with the "Mystery
Boys". It seems some genius at the National Hockey League had an idea
for some good, cheap promotion: why not fly the league's premier hockey
team to the middle of nowhere and have them play a sort of charity game
with mysterious "Eskimos"?</P>
<P>But not so fast. It seems the Rangers aren't too keen about taking
their precious free time to play pond hockey in Alaska. The players'
union files a grievance demanding that the arrangement be cancelled,
and Mystery sends their lawyer (Maury Chaykin) to represent the town
and hopefully maintain what dignity they have left. As if that wasn't
enough, crises arise in the homeland as well. The team needs a coach.
The town Mayor (Colm Meaney) wants John to do it as a sort of
retribution, but John wants to play, thereby pressing the old hockey
expert/town judge (Burt Reynolds) to take the job.</P>
<P>Mystery, Alaska is not only full of cliches, it clings to them as if
they were lifeblood. I don't take notes when I watch movies, but I wish
I had brought a notepad and a pen for this one just so I could write
down at least a significant portion of the countless examples of idea
recycling that goes on in this movie. To name a few: kids spontaneously
cursing for laughs, a guy who piles an inordinate amount of [fill in
food here; in this case, mashed potatoes] onto his plate when he is
distracted during dinner, a guy watching sports during sex and
screaming out when a goal is scored, and of course, the obligatory "Big
Game" ending, which we know can turn out one of two ways. I'll leave it
to you to guess which one is used here.</P>
<P>I've always thought of director Jay Roach as some kind of weird genius.
He is the man behind the legend that is Austin Powers and its sequel.
Both are delightful, no-holds-barred comedic masterpieces, always
reveling in their own outrageousness. With Mystery, Alaska, Roach tries
to get accustomed to the limitations of a more conventional narrative
and he doesn't always succeed. I'm not saying that he is incapable of
making good "standard" movies, far from it, I'm sure that if given the
right project he could very well extend his range. But here, working
from a script by tv vet David E. Kelley, he wants to burst out. As a
matter of fact, he finds some outlets to do just that, one of them
being -- whe else? -- Mike Myers, having oodles of fun with an
exaggerated Canadian dialect as a smarmy hockey commentator. There are
times when you sense the Jay Roach from Austin Powers coming out of the
woodwork, and those tend to be the high points. But for much of the
movie he has to restrain himself, and with a script as average as this
one it feels forced.</P>
<P>Nevertheless the film stays afloat. There is something about its pure,
well-intentioned affection for hockey that won me over. If, to a sports
movie, the game it's portraying is nothing more than a part of a
formula, it will not work, which is why none of the three Mighty Ducks
movies ever went anywhere. But when we feel a love for the sport, the
oldest of formulas can seem almost as good as new.</P>
