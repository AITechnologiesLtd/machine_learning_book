<P>     WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, a sort of post-mortem romantic fantasy-drama,
shows us a world which is unlike any we've seen before on screen.  Oh
sure, plenty of films have ventured into the realms of the afterlife, from
the sublime (DEFENDING YOUR LIFE) to the ridiculous (JACOB'S LADDER).
This, however, is a heaven of a different, considerably gaudier color.
It's the heaven created by Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams), a pediatrician
who dies in an auto accident.  Torn from his wife and soul-mate Annie
(Annabella Sciorra), Chris finds the transition easier when his personal
Paradise, complete with the family dog, resembles one of Annie's oil
paintings -- bright, shimmering and fairly sticky, since it is actually
composed of oil paint.</P>
<P>     Those scenes in Chris's heaven-of-his-own-making highlight WHAT
DREAMS MAY COME at its finest, creating spectacularly imaginative visions
of the Next World.  Production designer Eugenio Zanetti (Academy Award
winner for RESTORATION), in conjunction with the special effects team,
conjures up impressionist landscapes, a golden city on a hill, and visions
of eternal torment which are genuinely transporting.  Unfortunately, those
same scenes also highlight the film's most glaring weakness.  As Chris
explores the new world of his afterlife, he is instructed first by his
one-time medical mentor Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) then by a mysterious
Tracker (Max Von Sydow) in various rules and regulations.  They explain
what Chris can do, and why, what he can't do, and why, how he might want
to proceed on his journey of discovery, and why.  And WHAT DREAMS MAY COME
grinds...to...a...halt.</P>
<P>     It's an inevitable part of metaphysical fantasies like this that
someone has to bring the audience up to speed on exactly what they're
seeing and why.  That doesn't make it any less tedious, especially when
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME isn't supposed to be about what makes particular
cosmic gears turn the way they do.  Based on a novel by science
fiction/fantasy legend Richard Matheson, it's a story of intense human
emotions, and the desire of one soul to make right in death what went
wrong in life.  The scenes of Chris's earthly life with his family, strewn
throughout the film in a near-subliminal series of flashbacks, form a
potent back-story of a life which isn't as suburban-ideal as it first
appears.  There's something compelling about the suggetion that love
doesn't have to be perfect to be powerful.</P>
<P>     Those emotions should have carried WHAT DREAMS MAY COME to a
transcendent level, if not for those nagging distractions.  It's not just
the constant exposition which causes the problems, either.  An even bigger
distraction is Robin Williams, whose performance can't quite capture the
aching love he's supposed to be feeling.  Williams is certainly a fine
performer, but there are times when he's giving a "serious" performance
that he looks like he's trying way too hard.  The furrows in his brow, the
perpetually fidgeting lip and the over-dramatized line readings turn too
many interpersonal moments into exercises in How Not to Act on the Big
Screen.  Annabella Sciorra's convincing anguish could have grounded the
story in heart-breaking reality if Williams hadn't kept pulling it into
melodrama.</P>
<P>     Eventually, reality gives way entirely to a re-telling of the Orpheus
myth, with Chris searching for Annie's doomed soul on a journey through
the Other Place.  Again, the marvelous look of the film draws you in, as
Annie's shattered mindscape takes the form of the Nielsens' home turned a
desolate grey.  And again, a viewer is pulled away from the look of the
film by tortuous exposition and emotional confrontations which only feel
genuine on one side.  WHAT DREAMS MAY COME will likely wring tears from
those entranced by the GHOST-like prospect of romance beyond the pale.
For others, it will seem like a missed opportunity.  If a tale of primal
fears and primal emotions can't grab you without a nattering narrator,
something's very wrong.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Orpheus-capades:  6.</PRE>
