<PRE>Out of Sight (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Chemistry between romantic leads can make or break a film, and never in
recent memory has it more "made" a film than in Steven Soderbergh's witty,
slick, sexy adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel.  _Out_of_Sight_ jumps
back and forth in time to tell the twisting tale of suave bank robber Jack
Foley (George Clooney, rebounding well after his disastrous turn as the
Caped Crusader), out to make one big score after escaping from prison; hot
on his trail--and hot _for_ him--is tough U.S. Marshal Karen Sisco (the
ever-sultry Jennifer Lopez), who falls hard for Jack's charms after being
briefly locked in a trunk with him during his prison break.</P>
<P>Although _Out_of_Sight_'s intricately structured plot requires the
audience's undivided attention, Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Frank
(who also adapted Leonard's _Get_Shorty_) are less concerned with story
than they are dialogue and the quirky characters that deliver it, and the
film offers a wide array of memorable personalities, such as Jack's
collaborators in the planned big heist: stoner Glenn (Steve Zahn); the
menacing Maurice, a.k.a. Snoopy (Don Cheadle); his clumsy bodyguard White
Boy Bob (Keith Loneker); and Jack's partner Buddy (Ving Rhames).  Most
memorable of all, though, is the central duo of Jack and Karen, who are
both acutely aware of the danger of their mutual attraction yet are
completely powerless to resist the thrill.  The impossibly glamorous and
charismatic pair of Clooney and Lopez absolutely sizzle from their first
moment together; the soulful, smoldering gazes they lay upon each other are
sexier than any explicit scene could ever be.  It is their effortless
rapport that carries the film and jumpstarts its sometimes-flagging energy.</P>
