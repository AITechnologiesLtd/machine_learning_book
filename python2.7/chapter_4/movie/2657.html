<PRE>                                   EROTIQUE
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1994 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     EROTIQUE is an anthology film by three directors, Lizzie Borden,
Monika Treut, and Clara Law.  The casts of their three short films
include Kamala Lopez-Dawson, Bryan Cranston, Priscilla Barnes, Camilla
Soeberg, Tim Lounibos, and Hayley Man.</P>
<P>     EROTIQUE received its world premiere at the Seattle International
Film Festival and I understand is booked to return to Seattle later
this year (in fact I saw a trailer for it last night when I went to
KIKA).  Frankly, the fact that EROTIQUE has found a distributor and
bookings surprises me because the film is so uneven overall.  The first
part has the best story; the second has the highest kink contents; the
third part looks like outtakes from a much longer film.</P>
<P>     "Let's Talk About Sex" is directed by Lizzie Borden and written by
Borden and Susie Bright.  In it, Kamala Lopez-Dawson is an aspiring
actress who is being offered only humiliating roles of hookers and
barmaids who have a sex scene and then never heard of again, because
she's not blonde and anglo.  She supports herself by working in a
phone-sex boiler room.  She rebels against having the same, blonde-big
hooter fantasies imposed on her by customers until she finds one (Bryan
Cranston) who want to hear her sexual fantasies.  The final upshot of
this is a surprising and sexy last scene meeting between the two.  The
scenes in the boiler room, the women who work the phones and the johns,
the man who goads them on to keep the suckers on the line, and calls
they handle are hilarious and interesting.  The fantasy sequences
demonstrate why it is probably imprudent to talk about sexual fantasies
to strangers, but the interactions and growing telephonic intimacy
between Lopez-Dawson and Cranston is sexy and intriguing.  Overall,
this the best segment.</P>
<P>     "Taboo Parlor," directed by Monika Treut, involves two drop-dead
lesbians (Priscilla Barnes and Camilla Soeberg), the younger of whom
has yen for seducing men from time to time.  They go to a ship-board
nightclub in the Hamburg docks (look for Marianne Sagebrecht as the
dance mistress) and find a particularly dangerous stud to take home.
The three-way develops in a direction that surprises him and us, but
him more finally.  In the end, the whole smacks a little of the evil
lesbian of pulp homophobic literature and left me uncomfortable and not
a little puzzled, but the sex was erotic and something of a turn-on, if
that was the point because it was pretty hard to find a point to this
film.</P>
<P>     "Wonton Soup," directed by Clara Law and set in Hong Kong, is the
story of a Chinese-Australian (Tim Lounibos) who is persuaded to return
to his cultural roots and ancient Chinese sexual techniques to win back
his lover (Hayley Man).  The scene where they work their way their the
manual is hilarious, but the rest of it is undeveloped and fragmentary
at best (interestingly, in the trailer there is scene from this story
that is not in the released version I saw).  And as the last part of
EROTIQUE, it makes one exit with a decidedly negative impression of the
entire work.</P>
<P>     I cannot really recommend EROTIQUE, even though some of its parts
are stimulating in one way or the other.</P>
