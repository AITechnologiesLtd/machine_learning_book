<P>The 1990's will be remembered in twenty-first century film schools as
the Decade of the Digital Disaster.  This is the time when new advances
in computer graphics and modeling are leading to... well, not bigger and
better movies, but bigger and better explosions, anyway.  Like any good
group of little boys, the disaster moviemakers are using their powerful
new tools to take things apart and blow them up.  Want to see the White
House explode by an alien attack?  Want to see a great green atomic
lizard flatten New York skyscrapers?  Want to see a giant tidal wave
wash away the Brooklyn Bridge?  You want it, the CGI boys can do it.
(Although God knows why they're so hard on New York.)</P>
<P>But it's one thing to have these new toys, and quite another to make
good movies with them.  Snappy computer graphics can't save movies
without believable storylines or interesting characters -- case in
point:  Alex Proyas's Dark City -- while the same quality graphics
integrated with classy acting and writing (and all the other things that
Titanic had going for it) can make a movie magical.</P>
<P>Somewhere right in the middle is Deep Impact.  The graphics quality is
first-rate, although most of it is at the end of the movie, and the
filmmakers wisely limit the scenes of death and devastation.  Deep
Impact takes the road less traveled in disaster genre movies, choosing
to focus on people and their relationships instead of action and
suspense.  While other movies have concentrated on the wholesale
destruction of landmarks and cities, Deep Impact saves much of its
concern for the destruction of families and friendships.  While it's
possible to sit back, munching popcorn, contemplating the destruction of
a digital Manhattan with an awed "Cool," there's something moving about
the ending of human relationships, no matter how badly or inexpertly
handled.</P>
<P>The problem with Deep Impact isn't the genuinely touching and wrenching
moments, easily the best part of the movie.  The moments and the
emotions would be there no matter how well the movie was written.  The
problem is that the people we follow throughout the movie almost seem to
be chosen at random: the crew of the space vessel sent to stop the
comet, the family of the teenage astronomer who discovers the comet, the
MSNBC news team who follows the story:  The end result is something
reminiscent of Tim Burton's Mars Attacks!, another end-of-the-world epic
with a large and unwieldy ensemble cast.  (Any other similarity is
incidental, Deep Impact is nothing if not sincere, and levity is sorely
lacking.)  And by picking a large number of ordinary people to suffer
through the end of the world, what you get is a very ordinary movie.</P>
<P>It doesn't really help that almost everyone in the movie is a refugee
from NBC's Thursday night lineup.  (It certainly doesn't help that the
MSNBC network is referenced at every conceivable point.)  Most notably,
you have Tea Leoni (The Naked Truth), a gifted comic actor who looks
woefully stiff and out of place behind the anchor desk.  Throw in Bruce
Weitz (Hill Street Blues) and Laura Innes (ER) on the news team, and Ron
Eldard (ER), Blair Underwood (L.A. Law) and Jon Favreau (Friends) aboard
the oddly-named Messiah spacecraft, and what you have is a Must See
TV-Movie.</P>
<P>The two leads are, thankfully, America's Greatest Actor -- Morgan
Freeman -- and Robert Duvall, who's not that far behind.  Unfortunately
-- and this is a chronic complaint of mine -- neither of them are given
enough to do.  Freeman is the President, but (outside of an early
conflict with Leoni) he is never seen doing anything Presidential.  He
is the oracle, the narrator, providing reassurance, oratory, and plot
points.  Which is fine, and he's great, but it's not enough.  On the
other hand, Duvall is at the heart of the action, aboard the spacecraft,
and he is -- Chuck Yeager!  Yes!  Supercool, lollygagging around up
there in outer space, the sole standard-bearer for Tom Wolfe's righteous
stuff, all ready for the next comet landing or spark plug commercial...
and it's a mold that he never breaks out of.  I suppose parts like this
are the price that Duvall -- and the rest of us -- have to pay for the
privilege of movies like The Apostle, so I won't comment too severely on
his choice of scripts.</P>
<P>The one thing I took out of the theater from Deep Impact was the
sterling quality of the THX system in Austin's Lincoln 6 theater.
Whenever the camera pans past the comet in space, the THX emits this
rumble that made the walls shake -- sort of like a low-level
Sensurround.  (Never mind that real comets couldn't possibly make that
rumble in the soundless vacuum of outer space.)  Despite the movie's
refreshing attention to relationships over explosions (there's only one
completely mindless and extraneous explosion, early in the film), when
the standout part of the movie is the sound system, something's
missing.  There's a lot missing from Deep Impact, a perfectly ordinary
and middle-of-the-road disaster flick in every regard.</P>
