<PRE>EYES WIDE SHUT
Rating: ***1/2 (out of four)
R, 1999
Director: Stanley Kubrick
Screenplay: Stanley Kubrick and Frederic Raphael
Starring Cast: Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack</PRE>
<P>EYES WIDE SHUT arrives in theaters as one of the most anticipated 
releases of 1999, overshadowed perhaps only by STAR WARS: EPISODE I - 
THE PHANTOM MENACE. The reason for all the hype, of course, is that 
it is not only the first film from Stanley Kubrick in thirteen years, 
but it is also his last, as he died shortly after showing an initial 
cut to the cast and to studio executives. This situation has led to 
some controversy over whether or not the film, as released, truly 
represents Kubrick's intentions for the final product, especially 
after it became known that digital images were inserted during one 
scene in order to ensure an R-rating. Adding to the hype has been one 
report that Kubrick had told a friend that, in his estimation, Eyes 
Wide Shut was his best film yet.</P>
<P>I don't think that EYES WIDE SHUT is, or could have been, Kubrick's 
best film yet. It does not reach the heights of DR. STRANGELOVE or 
2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and I doubt that any post-production tinkering 
would have changed that. But with all the attention that EYES WIDE 
SHUT has received, we tend to forget that Kubrick probably never 
conceived of this film as any sort of "grand finale." He simply set 
out to make an original and thought-provoking drama, and at that task 
he has succeeded admirably.</P>
<P>As EYES WIDE SHUT begins, we are introduced to a wealthy New York 
couple, Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole 
Kidman). They go to a party hosted by Victor Ziegler (Sydney 
Pollack), a patient of Bill's who moves in an even more elite crowd 
than the Harfords. At the party, both Bill and Alice, after having a 
few too many drinks each, flirt briefly with others, but nothing 
comes of it and they go home. The following evening, while the two 
are smoking pot in their bedroom, Alice asks Bill about the women who 
were with him at the
party. They quarrel over whether or not there is any jealousy present 
in their relationship, and finally she recounts a story about a 
handsome naval officer she noticed on their family vacation years ago 
and claims that, had the officer shown any interest in her, she might 
well have left Bill and their young daughter for him.</P>
<P>Bill is understandably upset, but before he can resolve things with 
Alice, he is called away to the home of a patient whose father has 
just died. After he leaves, he goes out for a walk and encounters a 
variety of sexual temptations, but never actually acts on any of 
them. He goes to the apartment of a prostitute, for example, but his 
cellular phone rings before the two of them do anything. Eventually 
he makes his way to an isolated mansion, where he finds a strange 
ritual taking place that seems to be a hybrid between a religious 
ceremony and a sexual orgy. All the participants are masked, and a 
secret password is required to enter. A woman approaches Bill and 
warns him that he is in danger, and soon the masters of ceremonies 
realize that he is not supposed to be there. It seems inevitable that 
he will somehow be "punished" and possibly even killed, when suddenly 
the unidentified woman intervenes on his behalf. He is ordered to 
leave immediately, and no one will tell him what will become of the 
woman now.</P>
<P>At times, it seems as though EYES WIDE SHUT is about to settle into 
the mode of a classic thriller, with a single protagonist on the run 
from powerful, shadowy forces. Bill has reason to believe that the 
mysterious woman from the orgy, as well as the acquaintance who 
illicitly gave him the password, have been killed. When he tries to 
determine their whereabouts, he is warned in no uncertain terms to 
stay away, and the safety of his family is threatened. There are a 
few elements that are disappointingly conventional, such as an 
ominous figure in a trenchcoat who seems to be tailing Bill, or the 
two anonymous men who approach him in a black car and step out to 
deliver him a typewritten note. (There is, however, at least a hint 
that this stereotypical, clichéd 'bad guy' behavior may have been 
intentional.)</P>
<P>For the most part, however, Kubrick and co-writer Frederic Raphael 
keep the focus on the emotional suspense, as Bill and Alice continue 
to deal with their personal fears and insecurities about themselves 
and about each other. One of the most interesting aspects of the 
story is that their relationship nearly falls apart over sexual 
jealousy despite the fact that neither of them ever actually cheats 
on the other. Instead, they are driven apart by mere suggestions, 
possibilities, and even dreams -- one night, Bill comes home to a 
distraught Alice, who has had a nightmare in which she imagined 
herself having sex with countless men at once and laughing at Bill as 
he looked on. And even as he fears for his life, Bill continues to 
flirt with the New York City sexual underworld, still never actually 
betraying his wife but coming dangerously close at least once more. 
The thriller plot is composed similarly out of suggestion and 
ambiguity, as it is never clear if any real violence has taken place 
or if the entire situation is just a combination of unusual 
coincidences and intimidation tactics. The conflicts in EYES WIDE 
SHUT arise not out of actual events but out of the possibilities that 
exist in the minds of Alice and Bill, as they contemplate sexual 
abandon and, in Bill's case, physical danger. Issues of internal 
moral character become more important than legalistic details of what 
exactly happened (or, in this case, didn't happen) and why and when.</P>
<P>Kubrick's talent for hypnotic style and masterful orchestration makes 
him an ideal director for this sort of material, which relies more on 
thematic coherence and on the intensity of the psychological 
experiences than on its intentionally flimsy plot. He creates a 
convincing cinematic landscape, with an emphasis on the bleak and 
slightly decadent aspects of life in New York City, then utilizing 
them to construct a nightmarish excursion into the sexual underworld 
that is at once frightening yet believable. The orgy scene in 
particular is a perfectly composed piece of surreal tension, as the 
participants chant in a foreign language and engage in mechanical, 
ritualistic sex as Bill wanders through, perhaps fascinated, perhaps 
repulsed, and perhaps both. What little dialogue the scene contains 
is spoken from behind masks, creating the eerie impression of voices 
dissociated from the actual persons, floating in a void where 
ordinary human interactions have no place.</P>
<P>As is typical of Kubrick's films, the characters' quandaries arise 
out of a form of dehumanization, in this case the possibility that 
simple, impersonal sex could replace devotion and love as the center 
of Bill's and Alice's lives. Despite its explicit content, EYES WIDE 
SHUT is not an exhortation to the mindless sort of "sexual freedom" 
that permeates Hollywood. (If anything, it gets a little too 
obviously preachy; a brief subplot involving an HIV scare can't help 
but come off like something out of a high school sex-ed video.) The 
scenes of nudity, which are used almost exclusively to suggest 
infidelity and objectification, are more disturbing than anything 
else, and are certainly not intended to be erotic or sensational: 
stylistically, EYES WIDE SHUT has much more in common with BLUE 
VELVET or EXISTENZ than it does with the latest soft
core direct-to-video garbage.</P>
<P>There are times when the psychological drama and the suspense 
thriller seem to rest awkwardly side-by-side, but Kubrick and Raphael 
effectively resolve both threads at once in a conclusion that is 
low-key but appropriate and actually somewhat optimistic. There are 
no real scenes of confrontation in the final reels of EYES WIDE SHUT. 
Instead, the threat of physical harm and conspiracy is marginalized 
to the point where Bill feels he can safely leave behind the strange 
events of recent days, and he and Alice seem ready to count their 
blessings and move forward. And yet this is not a picture-perfect 
ending. There are some lingering doubts in their dialogue in the last 
scene, and it is not lost on them that they may have been saved 
partly by coincidence and lack of opportunity.</P>
<P>Kubrick has always been known as a somewhat pessimistic filmmaker, 
perhaps not without reason: A CLOCKWORK ORANGE imagined a future 
world overrun by selfishness and violence, DR. STRANGELOVE ended with 
nuclear holocaust, and the "happy" ending of 2001 showed a character 
who achieved enlightenment only when he ceased to be human. EYES WIDE 
SHUT demonstrates that he can play the other side of the coin as well 
and create characters who are not defeated by the unavoidable dangers 
of his troubled universe. Bill and Alice don't quite descend all the 
way into the abyss and climb back out, as is par for the course in a 
cautionary tale with an optimistic conclusion, but at the very least 
they step right up to the edge of the abyss and still manage to turn 
away.</P>
