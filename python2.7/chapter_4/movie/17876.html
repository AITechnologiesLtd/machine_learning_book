<P>Starring Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence. Rated R.</P>
<P>When comics can restrain themselves, heaps of good can come of it. Billy
Crystal gave one of the best performances of his career in the recent Analyze
This all because he acted like a normal person. Adam Sandler's The Wedding
Singer was a gem because Sandler was sweet and gentle instead of maniacal and
repulsive. In the new prison dramedy Life we have two top notch comics, Eddie
Murphy and Martin Lawrence One of them restrains himself and the other goes
all out. Guess which one of tem succeeds.</P>
<P>Life tracks the lives of two people as they enter a Mississippi penetentiary
(sentenced to life in prison) for a crime they didn't commit. Ray (Eddie
Murphy) was a happy-go-lucky bootlegger, smuggling alcohol during the time of
prohibition. The other one, Claude (Martin Lawrence) is a relatively normal
guy, who plans to start a new job and a family. Of course, both of their
plans are shattered when a sheriff frames them for the murder of a poker
hustler.</P>
<P>The film spans their lives from 1932 to 1998, including their repeated
attempts to escape, their bickering and their fighting. By the end of the
movie we almost have an African American Grumpy Old Men. Not that there's
anything wrong with that because much of it is often very funny, in an almost
improvisational style.</P>
<P>Eddie Murphy is ordinarily goofy as Ray, over-the-top and sometimes annoying.
Eddie Murphy is Eddie Murphy. There is nothing outstanding in his
performance, although he is funny as much as he always is. Martin Lawrence,
on the other hand, shines. If you've ever seen his dismal tv show Martin, you
know that he is a talented, but a "Jim Carrey Type" comic. Thus many times he
fails to entertain because he does to his scripts what God never meant for
him to do. In Life, however, he restrains himself enough to be hilarious but
at the same time real. This is essential because Life is not completely a
comedy. It is a drama, too; sentimental and poignant with very subtle but
effective social commentary. Director Ted Demme, working from a script by
Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone is not afraid to stray from the teen movie
that the trailers may lead you to believe Life is. The commentary, mostly on
racism as well as the criminal justice system, here is prevalent enough to be
obvious but subtle enough not to be preachy.</P>
<P>Life bears fleeting similarities to The Shawshank Redemption as well as some
other Eddie Murphy movies such as The Nutty Professor. It's as funny as the
latter (which was overrated anyway), thanks to the chemistry between Lawrence
and Murphy. At the risk of sounding redundant, Life is beautiful.
