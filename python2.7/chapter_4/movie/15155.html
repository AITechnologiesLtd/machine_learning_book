<P>You might argue that MAJOR LEAGUE started it this one, back in 1989,
spawning the misfit sports genre. The formula isn't unheard of: a bunch
of unlikelies suddenly find themselves in the middle of the league
championship and the media spotlight for the first time in an insanely
long amount of time. Or perhaps you'd argue that the real fuel for this
movie came from 1994's FORREST GUMP, a classic pearl of a movie about
those with less-than-average IQs finding the real hero inside of
themselves. But maybe you'd most like to argue that Adam Sandler - of
all people - could never do justice to either. </P>
<P>You'd be right on all three accounts, because the latest from the people
that brought you THE WEDDING SINGER is a step down for Sandler and
company. Although the comic himself undoubtedly finds his newer role
more comfortable, he sacrifices a lot of charm and uniqueness simply to
play the buffoon. The producers won't mind - Sandler is in a league of
comics that can draw a sufficient box office minimum and often do more -
but Sandler himself is lacking the maturity that is necessary for him to
have an extended career in Hollywood. </P>
<P>The cast is one big stereotype dictionary, and a lot of the supporting
roles add to the idiot humor. Sandler himself is the Forrest Gump town
idiot and experienced waterboy named Bobby Boucher. At 32 years old,
however, he's finding it hard to keep a job, and eventually winds up at
the degenerate South Central Lousiana State University. There, a
football coach named Klein (Henry Winkler) recognizes his newfound
waterboy as a tackling savant and immediately recruits him to play
linebacker. Although against his overprotective mother (Kathy Bates)'s
wishes, he's cheered on by his girlfriend Vicki (Fairuza Balk) and the
rest of the university as he leads the team to the conference
championship. </P>
<P>Anything on the character side of this movie is taken straight from
FORREST GUMP - be it Bobby's mother, his girlfriend, or the friend in
Coach Klein. And everything else, on the football side, is MAJOR LEAGUE
redone for gridiron glory - the screwloose announcer, the drunken
cheerleading squad, and the two fans sitting in the bleachers. Neither
works particularly well in a Sandler movie - the humor isn't intelligent
enough for that - but between the two, enough of the movie manages to
come out above water. In all, there's a certain bottom line to Sandler
movies: if you've been out of college for a good while, you're never
going to get it. But for the adolescents, it's their night away from the
folks, and THE WATERBOY is worth the bucket of popcorn.</P>
