<P>Handed the reigns of the moribund "Alien" franchise, French director Jean-
Pierre Jeunet ("City Of Lost Children") faced the daunting task of 
breathing life into a horror series that virtually died in its last 
installment. The pallid "Alien 3" climaxed with Ellen Ripleys swan dive 
into an ocean of fire, a sacrifice to protect humanity from the alien 
growing within her own body. With the heroine fried and most fans of the 
series either angered or bored, whats left to do? Raise the dead, of 
course, and thats just what Jeunet and writer Joss Whedon have done, 
with some intriguing side trips along the way. </P>
<P>"Alien: Resurrection" contains the requisite extended chase scenes, but 
thats the least interesting part of the movie. The appeal of the film 
lies in the fringes, as Jeunet employs grotesque visions and kinky sexual 
imagery to flirt with some intriguing notions, including what exactly 
constitutes the very nature of identity. While too cold and formulaic to 
fully satisfy, "Resurrection" has enough darkly rewarding moments to 
warrant a visit.</P>
<P>A little history for those who missed the first three films. The aliens 
are incredibly vicious predators with acid literally coursing through 
their veins. An alien grows by emerging from a pod and springing onto the 
face of an unwitting host, then shooting its seed down the gullet of the 
victim. After an incubation period, it bursts through the hosts chest 
and scurries off to finish the growth process. Rumor has it that 
telemarketers are bred the same way.</P>
<P>The film begins with the quasi-resurrection of Ellen Ripley (Sigourney 
Weaver), depicted in a series of stylish fade-ins. On a military 
spaceship 200 years after the last film, scientists clone Ripley in order 
to retrieve the alien queen from her body. Proving that government 
stupidity is timeless, the boys in charge plan to raise a herd of the 
hyper-violent creatures, taming and training them for some unexplained 
evil purpose. Following the surgical extraction of the queen, Ripley 8 
(the first seven clone attempts were nightmarish failures) is kept alive 
for curiosity value alone. A disdainful officer spares her life, while 
declaring "As far as Im concerned, Number 8 is just a meat by-product." </P>
<P>Ripley 8 grows, and we learn that, due to the alien DNA used in the 
cloning process, she isnt entirely human. Thanks to the racial memory of 
the aliens, the clone retains the memories of the original Ripley, but 
her strange smile, reptilian movements and acidic blood make it clear 
that she is something very, very different.</P>
<P>Enter the Betty, a commercial freighter crewed by mercenaries. Theyve 
hijacked the cryogenically-frozen bodies of a group of miners, to sell 
them as hosts for the first batch of aliens. However, one of the 
mercenaries, junior mechanic Call (Winona Ryder,) has a decidedly 
different agenda.
In short order, all hell breaks loose as the mercenaries take over the 
ship and the aliens get loose, forcing the soldiers, Call and Ripley 8 
into an uneasy alliance.</P>
<P>"Resurrections" action sequences move along well enough, particularly an 
underwater chase scene, but the characters are too disposable to be 
engaging on an emotional level. The blue-collar crew of the Betty is an 
unpleasant lot, sketchy stereotypes mostly, and its hard to look at them 
as much more than Alien Chow.</P>
<P>Thankfully, Sigourney Weavers enigmatic Ripley 8 is a fascinating 
creation. She clearly remembers who she was, but what exactly is she now? 
Did Ripleys soul make the jump to this new body, or is Ripley 8 just a 
Xerox, an alien hybrid with stolen memories? Weaver and Jeunet work well 
together, examining the whole notion of individual identity through this 
unique creature. Weaver gets to deliver a number of deadpan one-liners as 
well, adding a welcome touch of humor while maintaining the cryptic 
nature of the character.</P>
<P>Throughout the film, Jeunet toys with the freaky sexuality that has 
always been an undercurrent of the series. A scientist holds his lips 
close to an aliens face, separated only by protective glass, in one of 
the more obvious moments of perverse sensuality. A shrink would have a 
field day with the whole notion of face-hugging alien breeders, and 
Jeunet knows the real horror story lies there.  Unfortunately, instead of 
pursuing that truly disturbing line, he returns to the tired chase format 
and, despite the inventive set pieces and rich Gothic-industrial art 
direction, weve seen this stuff too many times before. The horror of 
"Alien: Resurrection" doesnt come from the idea of monsters chasing us. 
It comes from the exploration of why we want them to. </P>
