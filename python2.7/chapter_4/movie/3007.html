                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Mary Stuart Masterson, Brian Benben, Ned Beatty, Michael
Lerner, Jeffrey Tambor, Anita Morris, Stephen Tobolowsky.
Screenplay:  Willard Huyck & Gloria Katz and Jeff Reno & Ron Osborn.
Director:  Mel Smith.</P>
<P>     A couple of years ago, director Barry Levinson made a movie based
on a twenty-year-old idea.  This pet project was loud, heavy-handed
and self-indulgent, and clearly showed why it hadn't been made twenty
years earlier:  it wasn't a very good idea.  However, Levinson had
acquired the cachet to make any movie he wanted to make, so he made
TOYS.  George Lucas has even more cachet, and he also decided to
produce a twenty-year-old idea.  The result, unfortunately, is similar
to TOYS.  RADIOLAND MURDERS is an attempt at farce that is simply
chaotic and grating, and its frantic pace can't disguise the fact that
it just isn't funny.</P>
<P>     RADIOLAND MURDERS is set in 1939 at WBN, a Chicago radio station
that is planning to launch a fourth national network.  On this evening,
the station owner (Ned Beatty) is entertaining potential affiliates and
a live studio audience with a sampling of the shows the network will
offer.  However, there is a lot more going on backstage than onstage.
Writer Roger Henderson (Brian Benben) is desperately trying to convince
his wife Penny (Mary Stuart Masterson), the station's do-everything
assistant, that he hasn't been unfaithful; the writing staff is
desperately working against the clock to make the changes ordered by
the chief sponsor (Brion James).  And someone is killing off members of
the station staff, with Roger becoming the chief suspect.</P>
<P>     For nearly its entire first hour, RADIOLAND MURDERS succeeded
primarily in giving me a terrible headache.  The story rockets from
character to character, lingering just long enough to let us see that
each one is defined almost exclusively by a single annoying character
trait.  The incompetent director (Jeffrey Tambor) has a bad toupee; the
station manager (Larry Miller) has a German accent; the head writer
(Harvey Korman) is a mush-mouthed drunk; another writer (Bobcat
Goldthwait) is...well, Bobcat Goldthwait.  Subtle nuance in
characterization may be too much to expect from a broad comedy like
RADIOLAND MURDERS, but it's still a problem when virtually the entire
cast is so irritatingly one-note that you begin hoping various
characters will be the next to die.  They are also stuck with dialogue
that must have had whiskers on it in 1939, like the ever-uproarious
"You may think you know what I know, but I don't think you know what
you think you know" bit.  The slapstick is better, but it too is simply
too stale to sustain the energy.</P>
<P>     The second half is a significant improvement, focusing on Roger's
attempts to stay one step ahead of the police and solve the murders
before he himself is arrested for them.  Brian Benben (of HBO's "Dream
On") is a charming comic actor, and his gifts with physical comedy make
a perilous descent down the side of the station building and dressing
in a Carmen Miranda get-up far funnier than they have any right to be.
But director Mel Smith (THE TALL GUY) makes the horrendous decision to
keep cutting away to the performers on stage.  Every time he does so,
RADIOLAND MURDERS just stops dead, and it's not worth the jerky ride
simply to see cameos by Billy Barty, Rosemary Clooney and George
Burns.  Benben is the best thing RADIOLAND MURDERS has going for it,
but Smith doesn't seem to realize it.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, that decision is indicative of what is most wrong with
RADIOLAND MURDERS:  no one seems clear exactly what it is supposed to
be.  An homage to the days of live radio?  A backstage farce a la
NOISES OFF?  A murder mystery?  A romantic comedy?  Lucas and his team
of screenwriters seem to want it all, and as a result they end up
without much of anything.  RADIOLAND MURDERS is one of those
unfortunate films which equates loud and fast with entertaining, when
in reality it's simply noisy and busy.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 radios:  3.</PRE>
