<P>   When John Carpenter's "Halloween" (also featuring Jamie
Lee Curtis) hit the screens in 1978, it scared the heck out of
people who thought they were too sophisticated to be fazed
by horror films.  Roger Ebert called it an "absolutely merciless
thriller, a movie so violent and scary that I would compare it to
'Psycho.'"  "Halloween" was about a six-year-old kid who
commits a murder at the beginning of the movie and is
counseled by a psychiatrist who recommends--as psychiatrists
are not usually wont to do--that the kid stay
in jail for a long long time.  The kid's name is Michael Myers,
he had killed his brother, and though he is thought to be
dead, his sister, Laurie Strode, fears for her life.  For two
decades, Myers has not shown his face in town, seeming to
confirm that he is no longer with us, but now, on October 31,
1998, he is doing what he does best.  In his attempt to get at
his sister, now in her late thirties and the head mistress of an
exclusive prep school in California, he must first clear away a
few other people whose predicament is that they are seen as
buffers to the frightened and enraged Strode (Jamie Lee
Curtis).  Some time back, Laurie had changed her name to
Keri Tate, has been unsuccessful at fighting her problems
with alcohol and prescription drugs, and is much too
protective of her 17-year-old son, John (Josh Hartnett).</P>
<P>   "Halloween H20" is yet another sequel that cannot match
up to the glories of its precursor and, in fact, is considerably
less hair-raising than recent horror films like "Scream,"
"Scream 2," and even "Mimic."  Directed by Steve Miner--who
is unable to mine the "Psycho"-like terror of John Carpenter's
original, "Halloween H20" spends much of its brief 85 minutes'
duration establishing the atmosphere of a quiet town which
harbors the exclusive and secluded high school presided over
by Keri Tate.  She has taken a mere guidance counselor, Will
Brennan (Adam Arkin) as a lover, and against the usual rules
of pedagogy includes her own son in her literature class.  The
story, scripted by three people(!), strives for metaphoric
content, highlighting a class discussion of the novel
"Frankenstein" (which only one student seems to have read),
but otherwise lays no claim to cerebral satisfactions.</P>
<P>   Several flaws are responsible for this picture's relative lack
of nail-biting tension.  For one, Miner has mined the
conventions of the genre leaving little for originality.  Principal
among these protocols is the repetition of false alarms, as
when a guy would seeming sneak up to a potential victim, lay
his hand on her shoulder, and amid her screams turn out to
be no-one more dangerous than the next-door neighbor.  For
another, the chief villain, Michael Myers (Chris Durand),
commits his murders purely for reasons never known to the
audience.  He may be having fun as he butchers his victims,
but given the white Halloween mask he never removes, we
see no expression on his face when he commits
mayhem, nor do we know a thing about him except that he's
a psycho.  He has no conscience and presumably feels no
pain; so where is the thrill of acquiring retribution over him?  </P>
<P>   Like other creeps in the genre, this mosntrous guy never
runs after his intended victims but rather walks like the
Frankenstein monster and as a result misses out on some
juicy killings; nor does he make his profession easier by
using anything more lethal than a kitchen knife.  Only one
murder is shown in vivid, close-up horror; that of quarry who
does not simply roll over and die when stabbed but who
actually has frightening tremors during his brief but eerie
death-rattle.  </P>
<P>   LL Cool J plays a nice guy, a security guard who is an
aspiring novelist and spends much time on duty phoning his
woman with chapters from his salacious works-in-progress. 
He's not the sort of fellow whom the audience would allow to
be sliced up, so not to worry.  As the high school sweethearts
John and Molly, Josh Hartnett and Michelle Williams are from
stereotype city.  John does not exactly get a chance to shine
when he's given lines like "Mom, you've got to let me live my
own life."  As the adult sweethearts, Tate and Brennan seem
made for each other.  Tate, an alcoholic prone to hysteria, is
too flawed to sympathize with, and Brennan turns in a
stick-like performance this time around.  What's more Steve
Miner gives us a teasing glimpse of what he could have done
with this movie by flashing a few seconds of "Scream" on the
teens' TV screen; "Do you want to die tonight?"  Now that's
scary.</P>
