<P>"The Belly of an Architect" is an interesting example of a film that
applies metaphors to everything it presents.  It's not so much concerned
with telling a story or introducing characters as it is introducing one
kind of a character, and trying to bring him down to what he really is. 
Films like these are challenges for the audience because they have to pay
attention to every little thing that happens, remember lines that may come
into context later on as they take on different meanings, and then later on
try to figure out the themes its trying to present.  In other words, it's a
fun film for those who enjoy a film that's a puzzle.</P>
<P>The architect (and belly) being referred to in the title is Stourley
Kracklite (the ever-likable Brian Dennehy), a man who arrives in Rome from
Chicago with his much-younger wife, Louisa (Chloe Webb, the Nancy from "Sid
and..."), to head an exhibition of the work of an older favorite architect
of Kracklite's, Etienne-Louis Boulee.  Arriving in the city, he is greeted
with lots of warmth from the people working with him, and seems to be doing
exactly what he wants to do with all the freedom he can have.</P>
<P>However, he soon begins to suffer some pains in his lower chest, and his
life begins to tumble down in front of him.  He learns that Boulee himself
suffered pains much like his, and pretty soon is convinced that his wife is
trying to poison him, since that is what happened to the Roman Emporer
Augustus, whom he sculptured once.  As he becomes more and more obsessed
with what he thinks is a stomach tumor (a doctor confirms it's just a case
of bad gas...and egotism), his wife feels more and more distanced, and
finds herself succumbing to the flirting of one of Kracklite's collegues,
Caspasian (Lambert Wilson).</P>
<P>The film was directed by Peter Greenaway, one of the most controversial and
overall intriguing directors working today (he's directed such films as the
NC-17 "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover," "Prospero's Books,"
and "The Pillow Book").  Greenaway's a director much more interested in
themes and creating certain sensual moods than really really telling a
story, and here he blows us away with some truly gorgeous shots of Rome and
its many sculptures (photographed beautifully by his usual D.P, Sacha
Vierny), and overwhelms us with some truly cinematic moments, most notably
a scene where Kracklite discovers a colleague of his has been secretly
taking photographs of him when he didn't think he was being photographed,
and a scene where he watches his wife sleep witih Caspasian.</P>
<P>Of course, there's the themes that Greenaway is aiming at, like the way
that artists are often too influenced and consumed by what came before,
shown in the way that many of the things that happen to Kracklite were
things that happened to Boulee.  But he also shows the other side of this,
exploring how sometimes artists TRY and be like other artists, shown in
some of the ways that Kracklite actually takes steps to make sure that what
happens to him is what happened to others before him.  The way that these
two play with one another is obviously the thing that Greenaway is playing
with here, and after awhile, we're not sure if it's one or the other or
both that is coming into play in this film.</P>
<P>And we get to see another one of Greenaway's odd fascinations, things that
he brings into perspective and concentrates on that no one else really
finds interesting but him...until, of course, they see his movies.  In
"Prosero's Books," it was those damn books; in "The Pillow Book," it was
the fetish of writing calligraphy on bare flesh; in "The Belly of an
Architect," it's, well, the belly.  We see Kracklite come up with a really
big fascination with his belly, which he thinks is being eaten away from
the inside by a nasty tumor, a fascination that makes him go as far as
xeroxing pictures of the bellies of various statues in Rome, and then, um,
hold them up to his own belly.  Seeing his room adorned with pictures of
stomachs is one of the weirdest, oddest images I've seen in my short
lifespan.</P>
<P>Of course, there are a bunch of problems which pull this down from what it
really wants to be.  One of the things Greenaway is best at is bringing
about his themes without actually mentioning them, leaving everything up to
the imagination.  This film blatantly tells us everything we need to know,
having the characters actually dicuss the themes.  This makes everything
seem much more bland than it actually is, and since there's nothing really
fascinating to watch after the themes have been stated, the film seems to
really, really drag.</P>
<P>It also doesn't help that this film is way too fable-like - everything
anyone does is so that Greenaway can bring out his themes.  This makes
everything seem so less poetic, especially that ending, which instead of
being disturbing or somber merely comes off as being contrived.  I have no
problem with fables, but when they come off like this, it undermines
everything a whole lot than it really should have.</P>
<P>But there's really more to reccomend than to dislike here, even if the film
comes off as way too pretentious for its own good.  The one thing that
really makes it worth viewing is the performance of Brian Dennehy as
Kracklite, who brings so much life to his role as well as so much humanity
that you can't help but feel bad for him as he takes a nasty descent into
madness.  The film is actually a lot like a one-man show: everyone is
merely there as a supporting role for him, and almost every scene features
Dennehy either talking with people, or by himself, sometimes even writing
bizarre letters to the long-dead Boulee, confessing his deepest thoughts. 
Dennehy's such a good actor and makes everything seems so real that he
gives the only real human feel to the film, and makes it seem a lot better
than it really is.</P>
