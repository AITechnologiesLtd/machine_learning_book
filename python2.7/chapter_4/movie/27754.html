<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The sequel of Fritz Lang's popular silent movie made a decade earlier,
on the criminally insane gambler, Dr. Mabuse (Rudolf Klein-Rogge),
adapted from the novel by Norbert Jacques. In this film, Mabuse has
escaped incarceration by being placed in a mental institution and is
placed under the charge of the asylum's director, Dr. Baum (Oscar
Beregi, Sr.). The doctor has built his reputation by studying the mad
criminal genius and his use of hypnosis, as he gives lectures about him
at the university. But Mabuse uses his hypnotic powers to control the
director without him being aware of it and thereby continues his mad
scheme to rule the world.</P>
<P>Lang used Mabuse as a symbol at first for corruption and decadence in
Germany's Weimar Republic and in this film the parallel is drawn to the
menace of Nazism, as Mabuse utters Nazi messages of hate from the asylum
prison, much like Hitler did when imprisoned, brainwashing a band of
criminals to carry out his plans of mass destruction. Here, Mabuse
gets thugs to blow up chemical plants, rob banks, and commit acts of
brutality. Goebbels recognized what Lang was doing and made the director
change the last reel, while offering him a position as head of the film
industry in Nazi Germany (supposedly to make propaganda films for the
Nazis). Lang opted to leave in a hurry overnight, going to Paris and
soon to Hollywood. His screenwriter wife, Thea von Harbou, chose to join
the Nazi party and remain in Germany.</P>
<P>Inspector Lohman (Otto Wernicke), the very popular and respected lawman,
who is comfortably overweight and loves to smoke cigars, is drawn into
the case when he receives a call from Hofmeister (Karl Meixner), a
policeman dismissed for taking a bribe, who tells
him that he found a gang of bank forgers. But, while on the phone,
Hofmeister disappears before he could mention names and places, but not
before he scratches the name Mabuse on the window pane. This is the same
Lohman from Lang's 1932 M, who chased Peter Lorre down.</P>
<P>The film was well-crafted, perfectly photographed in B&W, as it
maintained a breezy pace and threw into the story some comedy and
romance. The comedy came at the expense of Lohman, as he loses his hat
during a car chase, feels disgruntled that he receives an emergency call
that makes him late for the opera, and is befuddled as he scratches
himself wondering why Dr. Kramm (Loos) was killed in heavy traffic. The
romance takes place between one of Mabuse's henchmen, Kent (Gustav
Diessl), who fell for Lily (Vera Liessem), as she lent him money when he
got out of prison after serving over four years for murdering his
sweetheart and his best friend. He tried to get an honest job but
couldn't and now tells her he is a thief. She talks him out of staying
in the criminal ring, but the two are taken by force to the secret
criminal headquarters and are locked in a room and told they will die in
three hours for his refusal to follow an order to rob a bank and replace
the stolen money with forgeries. They are not told how they will die
until they hear a loud ticking sound.</P>
<P>The chief mastermind, who no one sees, orders his henchmen around by
using a record player and placing it in a room no one can enter. When
Mabuse dies, a visiting Dr. Kramm finds the brilliant criminal testament
of Dr. Mabuse on the floor and compares a news report of a jewelry
robbery to what he is now reading and tells Baum that he is going to
report it to the police, but is killed by Mabuse's elite Section 2B
hitmen on orders from the unseen leader.</P>
<P>Mabuse, though now dead, nevertheless has hypnotized Baum so that he now
thinks he's Mabuse and the criminal ring continues undeterred. There are
even ghosts seen walking around (they represent the dead from the
previous war who seek violent vengeance for what happened to them and
their country). The whole feel of the movie is that it's brilliant
hokum. Aside from its serious political message, this was a slapstick
comedy, and a mystery story much influenced by those American serials,
which were very popular at the time. It is definetly worth seeing.</P>
