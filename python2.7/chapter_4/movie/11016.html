<PRE>Scream 2 (1997)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 20 December 1997 with Lynne and Sandy at the Great Neck Squire for
$24 for their birthdays. </P>
<P>Sequels, especially to successful horror movies, are renowned for their
failure to retain the spirit and character of the original. But, director
Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson have teamed up again and created
not only a sequel that stands up on its own, but another effective horror
movie. </P>
<P>It's a year after the murders in *Scream*, and a movie, "Stab", is
capitalizing on the sensationalism. This puts the spotlight on Sidney
Prescott (Neve Campbell) again, and it puts her in danger again, as
murders mirroring the incidents from the year before start happening
around the campus. Also back from the original are Jamie Kennedy as the
geeky Randy Meeks, David Arquette as the bumbling deputy Dewey Riley,
Courteney Cox as the ambitious TV reporter (and "Stab" author) Gale
Weathers, and Liev Schreiber as the innocent victim and possible killer
Cotton Weary. </P>
<P>There are also a lot of newcomers, and a lot of dead people by the end of
the movie.</P>
<P>There is also a lot of parodying from other horror movies, and from
*Scream* itself. Having seen *Scream* is a plus, but I think *Scream 2*
succeeds on its own. But, if you saw the first movie, seeing Tori Spelling
recreating the opening of Scream in the opening of "Stab," it's a lot more
fun--more than just how funny it is seeing Tori Spelling in *anything.* </P>
<P>Unlike most horror movies, *Scream 2* actually shows the intelligence of
its creators in the dialogue and the cinematography. Added but not
necessary are discussions of sequels that were better than the originals,
the film within a film, Gale being hounded by grade-B local reporter
Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf), and the terror for Sidney as she is
surrounded by masked figures while rehearsing in a Greek tragedy. There is
also a wonderful scene where the killer has called his next victim on a
cellular phone while in the middle of a campus quad. </P>
<P>I don't want to give too much away, so I'll just finish by saying that the
movie plays with the cliches without succumbing to them, and that the cast
really does a great job in this surprisingly literate film. It's always
wonderful to watch a movie of the genre created by people who love it.</P>
<P>The only thing I didn't like about the movie was its title. I would've
liked any of the alternate working titles: *Scream Again*, *Scream
Louder*, or *Scream: The Sequel*. Then there's my idea: *Keep Screaming*. 
Apparently, there is a Scream 3 in the works. Let's hope it lives up to
its two predecessors. </P>
<P>Also starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Elise Neal, Jerry O'Connell, Jada
Pinkett, Omar Epps, Rebecca Gayheart, and Malcolm McDowell as the film
professor. Cinematography by Peter Deming.</P>
