<P>Actor, part-time Calvin Klein model and all-around greazy-looking guy
Vincent Gallo takes his first shot at directing, in this
semi-autobiographical movie, which he also wrote and provided the original
music. Christina Ricci, best remembered as the character of Tuesday from the
ADAMS FAMILY films, grows up, sloshes on some make-up and a frilly
cleavage-friendly tap-dancing dress, and comes into her own in this hybrid
comedy/drama. Let's all hope that Gallo doesn't call me up and tell me off
because of that "greazy-looking guy" comment now....hehehe.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Frenetic con man gets out of jail and returns home to see his parents.
Having invented an existence without prison and a new wife to his folks, the
man kidnaps a girl to play his wife for his one visit home.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
One of the few real independent movies to come out in 1998, this film
combines an excellent troupe of actors, a quirky, humorous and sometimes
serious script, with an amazing new set of visual techniques purposely
orchestrated by the man behind all of the magic, Vincent Gallo. This film's
style blends elements from many an independent director's early works, like
Tom DeCillo's JOHNNY SUEDE (8/10), Martin Scorsese's MEAN STREETS (7/10),
David Lynch's BLUE VELVET (8.5/10) and Gus Van Sant's MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO
(7.5/10). Gallo also wrote a pretty funny screenplay filled with interesting
characters, idiosyncrasies galore, and a decent romance between two very odd
lead characters.</P>
<P>Christina Ricci plays an excellent victim in this movie, and rises to every
occasion to shine whenever her character takes center or back stage. She
comes across as a very sexy, mature and interesting actress, primed to take
off in her career. I haven't seen much of Gallo on film, but he most
certainly does exude a hunk o' charisma despite his character's utter
despicability, and convinces as the double, and triple-talking, prick. One
particularly peculiar scene in the photo booth will have the words "spanning
time" resonating in your head for years to come. Trust me, this guy's nuts
and hilarious. The parents as played by Ben Gazzara and an unrecognizable
Anjelica Huston also come through in spades, and the conclusion in the strip
joint is an eye-full to beware. An overall unique style, with a unique
story, a unique actor and a great supporting cast, and the great Christina
Ricci.</P>
<P>Mind you, if you don't like movies that are different from the norm, don't
see this film. If you enjoy a little paprika in your dinner every now and
again, taste this original spice and watch the low-class dirt from the movie
ooze right down into your gut. Note: Alongside Tony Kaye's AMERICAN HISTORY
X (8/10), this film is one of the most visually stunning movies of the year.
Ironically, both directors are extremely vocal in their displeasure of
anyone who opposes their views.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actors Vincent Gallo and Kevin Corrigan both had parts in the 1990 classic
Martin Scorsese mob film, GOODFELLAS (9/10). Gallo played a member of Harry
70s crew, while Kevin played Ray Liotta's younger brother, Michael Hill.
Vincent Gallo was actually born in Buffalo, NY. His real father's voice,
Vincent Gallo Sr., is the actual voice that you hear during Ben Gazzara's
"serenade" of Christina Ricci.
Gallo has been known to shoot off his mouth in real-life, and even had
conflicts with Anjelica Huston and Christina Ricci on the set of this movie.
Susan Sarandon no longer speaks to him because he called her "an old hag."
He called Leonardo DiCaprio "a good-looking girl" and director James Cameron
"a pig." He turned down roles in both RESERVOIR DOGS (9/10) and BOOGIE
NIGHTS (7.5/10). He claims not to drink, smoke or do drugs, and portrays
himself as a rather right-wing Republican. He also has a personal collection
of over 5,700 videotapes. "Very ordinary, corny movies are ones that I seem
to like the most."
Gallo first wrote the screenplay for the film in 1989, and was satisfied
with a final draft completed with Alison Bagnall in 1996. He apparently
cannot spell or use a typewriter. The film cost $1.5-million to make, and
was shot entirely in Buffalo, NY. He's had 15 one-man shows of his artwork,
and an early Super 8 film of his appears briefly in the movie BASQUAIT (as
does Vincent himself). He has also played in several bands including The
Plastics, Gray (with the real-life Basquiat), Bohack and Bunny.
Christina Ricci was turned down for the role of Claudia in INTERVIEW WITH
THE VAMPIRE (8/10), as well as roles in JURASSIC PARK (7.5/10) and LITTLE
WOMEN.</P>
