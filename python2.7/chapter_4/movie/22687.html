<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Tod Browning  (DRACULA (30)/FREAKS (1932)/THE UNHOLY THREE (1925)/ THE
BLACKBIRD (1926)/ THE ROAD TO MANDALAY (1926)/DEVIL DOLL (1936)) has a
long and distinguished career in making silent and talking pictures. His
predilection is for most of his heroes to be deformed or have suffered
heavily at the hands of another. They also melodramatically face the
conflict between the better and worse sides of their natures which are
usually split into two identities.</P>
<P>The film opens in a London Music Hall with Phroso the magician covering
up a coffin with a skeleton inside it and when he opens it again, there
is his lovely wife Anna (Jacquelin), whom he adores, appearing there.
She is part of his illusion act. But she will break his heart, having
fallen in love with a handsome African ivory trader, Crane (Lionel), who
is seen kissing her backstage. She couldn't bear to tell her kindly
husband that she is running away to Africa with him, and so the brusque
Crane says, I'll do it. In his confrontation with Phroso, he pushes the
magician over the balcony causing him to be crippled, as his back is
broken and his legs become useless.</P>
<P>When he is told some years later that his wife has returned with a child
and is in the local church, he crawls like a baby to her side, as she is
lying there dead, in front of the statue of the Virgin Mary with the
child next to her. He thereby vows to the Virgin to get revenge on Crane
and his brat daughter.</P>
<P>The scene next shifts to the Congo eigthteen years later and the area
west of Zanzibar, where he assumes the name of Dead Legs and is a
changed man, who is lecherous, embittered, and ruthless, surrounded by
drunken henchmen. His followers include a drug-addicted doctor (Baxter)
to treat him, and two strong-armed men to carry out his nefarious work,
Tiny (Tiny) and Babe (Kalla). He is now an African trader, and he keeps
the cannibal natives under his control by using illusionary tricks on
them, where he dresses up in a mask and tells them he is a God who can
keep the evil spirits away.</P>
<P>He begins to extract his revenge by hatching a plot to rob ivory from a
trader, Crane, and to have him and the girl, Maize (Mary), brought to
him. She is the daughter his wife gave birth to, and unbeknownst to her,
he is the one who had her raised by a madame and kept her working in a
dive as a prostitute.</P>
<P>When arriving in his jungle retreat, she witnesses a ceremony according
to the cannibal custom, that when a man dies- they always burn his wife
or daughter with him. That is the law of the Congo.</P>
<P>The plan of Dead Legs takes on a change, when Crane tells him that the
girl couldn't be his daughter because Anna refused to run away with him
after that incident, therefore she must be your daughter. But it is not
possible for Dead Legs to stop the natives from carrying out their
custom, since they would never believe him now after he told them that
Crane was her father and that he should be killed by them to bring away
the evil spirits.</P>
<P>The simplistic plot can be seen from a mile away as to how it will
develop and turn out. It exhibits the kind of racist outlook shown to
the natives that movies will not allow today. The film treats the
natives as savages, who eat their victims, as being inferior to even the
white rabble, who are merely mercenaries, thieves, and drunks. What
distinguishes this film, is the virtuoso performance of Chaney as a
villain, as he transforms himself into a fearsome character, and his
expressive face keeps changing with his different moods. He could be
tender and fatherly at one moment and the next moment he could have a
menacing look. His unbelievable pantomine skilled was learned from
childhood, where he had to learn how to communicate with his deaf
parents. He also has a flare for wearing just the right makeup for the
part he plays; here he looks almost bald, giving him the extra chilling
look he needed to have for the part. His speciality in the grotesque
made him a silent star icon, someone who will not be forgotten, who
could get the audience's attention by either inspiring them with the
vulnerability of his character or by his morbid sense of getting into
his character. In "West of Zanzibar," he is the one who makes the film
work so well. The film is a strangely curious relic, not because of the
story, but because he played this legless man so convincingly. It should
be noted that his wife, Hazel, had earlier been married to a legless
man.</P>
<P>Kongo (32) was a remake with Walter Huston.</P>
