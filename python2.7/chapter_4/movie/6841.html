<P>     Despite his immense popularity on stage, Rodney Dangerfield doesn't 
have a sterling reputation as a motion picture lead.  With the exception 
of BACK TO SCHOOL, a delightfully dumb 1986 comedy, every movie to 
feature Dangerfield prominently (CADDYSHACK, EASY MONEY, LADYBUGS) has 
been a dud.  MEET WALLY SPARKS, a lame, late-January film dumped into a 
sluggish market, may well finish the aging comic's screen career.  
There's nothing in this movie that warrants the price of a video rental, 
much less a trip to a theater.</P>
<P>     Generally, about the best one can hope for from a Dangerfield movie 
is a cliched storyline filled with crude-but-humorous gags and one-
liners.  That is, after all, basically what BACK TO SCHOOL delivered, 
and it worked on that basis.  MEET WALLY SPARKS never comes close, 
because there's hardly a laugh to be found from start to finish.  It 
amazes me that Dangerfield, who in the past has been able to make the 
simple act of walking into a room funny, has turned out such a dreadful 
motion picture.  MEET WALLY SPARKS is easily among the ten worst 
comedies I've seen in the past two years.  </P>
<P>     It's hard to put a finger on why Dangerfield isn't funny here.  He 
certainly doesn't seem to have invested his character, tabloid talkshow 
host Wally Sparks, with much vitality.  The sex jokes, even when you 
can't see them coming, are old and tired, as if we've heard them a few 
times too many.  This shtick is worn-out; it might still work in comedy 
clubs, but any spontaneity is lost on screen.  And, unfortunately, the 
one or two potentially-amusing moments have been shown to death in the 
previews, so their comic effect is ruined.  Even Dangerfield's intention 
of lampooning the current generation of talk shows isn't successful.  In 
spite of numerous cameos (by the likes of Geraldo, Morton Downey Jr., 
Jerry Springer, Bob Saget, Roseanne, Michael Bolton, Ron Jeremy, Tony 
Danza, Tim Allen, Jay Leno, and others), MEET WALLY SPARKS is too absurd 
to retain any sense of verisimilitude.  Without that quality, there's 
little chance for satire to be effective.   Yet probably the worst thing 
about WALLY SPARKS is its failed attempts to inject character 
development and human interest into a one-dimensional story.  By aiming 
for pathos, this movie comes across as pathetic.  </P>
<P>     The sole bright spot is the opening montage, which compares THE 
WALLY SPARKS SHOW to its moderate TV competitors (GERALDO, OPRAH, etc.) 
by means of quick edits.  Once the credits have concluded, however, it's 
all downhill -- fast.  The film's premise involves Wally toning down his 
show to stem the tide of deserting sponsors.  The network president 
(Burt Reynolds) gives him one week to clean up his act, or he's off the 
air.  The show's producer, a no-nonsense woman named Sandy (Debi Mazar), 
decides that Wally's best chance at respectability is to get his 
longtime opponent, conservative Governor Preston of Georgia (David Ogden 
Stiers), as a guest. Complications ensue when the talkshow host is 
injured at one of Preston's parties.  And, as if that wasn't enough, 
Sparks becomes an unwitting player in a scheme to blackmail the 
governor.</P>
<P>     Enduring MEET WALLY SPARKS is akin to watching a multi-car pileup, 
as each successive failure leads to a bigger thud.  By the end of the 
movie, I didn't know whether to feel angry at being subjected to such a 
loathsome experience, or saddened and embarrassed for Dangerfield and 
the others involved.  By his own admission, Rodney's not a happy person, 
and the public and critical response to MEET WALLY SPARKS isn't likely 
to bring much sunshine into his life.  This is truly a movie that 
doesn't deserve any respect.</P>
