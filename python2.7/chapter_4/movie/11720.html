<PRE>It starts...</PRE>
<P>This is where Joel Schumacher takes over.  Luckily for us, at this
point, Warner Bros. and producer Tim Burton keep Schumacher's crazy
vision of Batman on a leash, and we end up with a movie that's not
half-bad, even if it can't compare to Tim Burton's first two
installments.  </P>
<P>This is where it becomes obvious that the Batman series could be the
next James Bond franchise.  This series could go on forever, just think
about it.  There's endless stories to tell.  There's gadgets, girls, a
cool, actor-changing hero (as the reviewer who calls himself "Stimpy"
pointed out, yes, aside from being one hell of a tailor, cook, and
mechanic, Alfred is quite the plastic surgeon).  As long as they don't
kill off all of the villians, it's the perfect eternal franchise.  It
doesn't even have to repeat itself like Bond often does!  They just need
to make sure that the installments don't end up being all crap, and then
Batman can truly go on forever.  But I digress.</P>
<P>Well, Two-Face, the villian with two sides to his personality, half a
face scarred by acid, and who makes his good-or-evil decisions based on
whether his trusty two-headed (two faces... amazing, huh?) coin comes up
with the clean "good heads" side or the beat-up "bad heads" side...
damn, this is a run-on sentence... is on the loose.  Of course, Batman
is chasing him, and, as we see in the well-done opening sequence, is
on-and-off in terms of his luck in the pursuit.  </P>
<P>Meanwhile, an employee of Wayne Enterprises (wondering how Bruce keeps
his fortune going, were you, non-Batman afficionados?), Edward Nygma,
has created a device which will make television viewers "feel like
they're inside the show" - a "3-D TV" invention, if you will.  Wayne is
reluctant to fund such a project, since it deals with brain
manipulation, and his fears are well-founded - Nygma soon discovers that
his machine has the interesting side effect of allowing him to utilize
the brain power of anyone using his 3-D TV to grow smarter.  Naturally,
he wants to use this discovery to aid him in his revenge against Wayne. 
Confused yet?  It gets worse...</P>
<P>The circus is in town!  No, not the Red Triangle Circus, you ninny. 
This is a kinder, gentler show, featuring the trapeeze artists known as
"The Flying Graysons," a family... what?  Yes I said "Graysons."  Yup,
that's right.  This is the Grayson family, one of which includes... Dick
Grayson.  If you know anything about Batman, then you know what THAT
means... it means that circumstances will lead to Dick needing to move
in with Bruce and Alfred, which will in turn lead to... oh hell, you
KNOW where this is going.</P>
<P>Did I mention Chase yet?  No?  Oh, goodie!  Well, Dr. Chase Meridian is
consulting with Commisioner Gordon on the Two-Face case, since she's an
expert on multiple personalities.  Multiple personalities, hmm... nope,
don't have any of those in Gotham.  Well anyway, Chase is attracted to
"the wrong kind of man," so of course she ends up having a thing for a
certain hero-in-black-rubber.  And Bruce Wayne ends up having a thing
for her.  But when Wayne likes Chase, and Chase likes Batman but not so
much Wayne, well gee, kinda like the old Lois/Superman problem, isn't
it?</P>
<P>After a list like that, you're probably looking for the kitchen sink. 
Well, here it is: Drew Barrymore shows up in a small role as one of
Two-Face's girlfriends (she plays the girlfriend to his good side, which
is exactly the opposite of what you'd expect from Drew, isn't it?). 
Just thought you'd like to know.</P>
<P>Schumacher is filling in for Burton, and his direction is a little...
off-kilter.  A few of the fight scenes are confusing due to his flying,
zooming, wacked-out camera work.  But most of the time, he does a fine
job keeping things from getting too odd.  His vision of Batman's world,
on the other hand, leaves something to be desired...</P>
<P>Gone are the dark, dreary streets of Gotham that we knew and loved, as
Schumacher, with the aid of production designer Barbara Ling, has made
Gotham into a land of, yes, some dark streets, but also of neon lights
that appear for no apparent reason, gangs that are lit up by
black-lights - again for for no apparent reason - and buildings that,
instead of being detailed, beautiful models, are basic, CGI-created
rectangular-style skyscrapers.  It's passable, but not anywhere near as
gorgeous as the vision of Gotham that fit so well with Batman in the
first two films.  Even the Bat-vehicles like the Batmobile are
redesigned, and, though they look quite nice, Burton's versions remain
the ideal - perhaps in part because they came first, and also because
they weren't neon-lit.  As for the nipples on the Bat-and-Robin-suits,
gratuitous codpieces, and shots of rubbers rears, I only have to say -
why?? </P>
<P>Elliot Goldenthal is filling in for Danny Elfman, and, though he writes
a good and memorable score, it's not as majestic as Elfman's beautiful
work.  Still, it fits in with Batman just fine.</P>
<P>Now to the actors.  Okay, Val Kilmer... um... well, he's a good Batman. 
He speaks with gravel on his voice, as he should, like Keaton did.  But,
you know how theh thing you see most clearly in the Batsuit is the
chin?  Well, Kilmer's chin just doesn't fit in with the image as well as
Keaton's or even Clooney's.  I know that sounds odd, so I'll just blow
that off.  It's no big deal.  Kilmer also looks more like one might
expect Bruce Wayne or Batman to look than Keaton did - he's just a more
imposing figure.  But as Wayne, he always wears black, which is just
wrong - Batman is the morbid one, and Bruce Wayne is supposed to be the
facade of a light-hearted bachelor.  Oh well.  He still does alright in
the Batsuit, even if he does play Bruce in too wooden a manner.  Kilmer
isn't as good as Keaton, but still does alright.  At least it's nice to
learn more about Batman's origin, and spend a little more time with the
hero of this picture than we did in BATMAN RETURNS (1992).</P>
<P>Carrey acts like Carrey, leaping around and doing his best to steal
scenes, and he does get his fair share.  He's appropriately psycho as
the Riddler (do you capitalize the "t" in names like "The Joker," "The
Penguin," or "The Riddler?"  Just curious... I suppose it doesn't
matter.), but even though, at times, he plays a fine disturbed villian,
he also ends up playing what basically amounts to himself at other
times, leaping around, cracking jokes, stretching his face.  But in the
end, it's hard to imagine that anyone else could live up to this vision
of the Riddler.  He does nicely.</P>
<P>It's Tommy Lee Jones who gets the movie's most interesting character -
Two-Face.  The duality of this villian makes him one of the most
intriguing in the Batman mythos - but, on a few occasions in BATMAN
FOREVER, Two-Face is played a little too one-note, as just another
wisecracking, over-the-top enemy.  Still, on all those times when he
shows off his dual nature, he's easily the most fascinating person to
watch, and that's when Jones chews plenty scenery of his own.  He and
Carrey seem to battle for who can steal the most scenes, and in the end,
they both have come out about even as far as I'm concerned.  </P>
<P>Nicole Kidman plays Chase Meridian well enough, but, like Vicki Vale in
the first film, this is another love interest/damsel in distress that is
often thankless.  Even so, she has scenes where she shines, and she's
certainly not the same character as Vicki or Selena were.    </P>
<P>And what of Chris O'Donnell?  Of the more understated performances in
this movie, the actual truth is, his is probably the best, believe it or
not.  Dick Grayson/Robin (who, in another no-apparent-reason touch,
wears an earring for most of the picture) turns out to be an interesting
character, and he and Kilmer do have a brotherly chemistry that comes
across to the viewer.  His reasoning for wanting to become a vigilante
partner to Batman is well-acted and believable, and his eager teenage
side that pops up on occasion is likable, too.  Yes, for this film,
O'Donnell and Robin are likable guys.  Don't expect it to last into the
next one, though... although that's not entirely his fault.  But I'm
getting ahead of myself... I can talk about that in the BATMAN & ROBIN
review.</P>
<P>In the end, despite not being as good as the first two movies, BATMAN
FOREVER is actually not bad.  Some of the little touches are especially
nice - Alfred calling Bruce "Master Bruce," Two-Face's henchmen calling
him "Face," Two-Face referring to himself as "we" or "us." Still, the
warning signs of Schumacher start to creep in here, and act of portents
of the downhill slide to come.  Michael Gough, by the way, is and always
remains a great Alfred, and a fine actor.  Pat Hingle seems miscast as
Gordon, but that may just be because he hasn't had a big enough role
yet.  In the end, even though Batman may ignore some laws of physics
here, he does okay for himself.</P>
