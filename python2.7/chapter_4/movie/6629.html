<PRE>                               MICROCOSMOS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Drama, comedy, sex, violence, and
          jaw-dropping beauty, and all for free.  You only
          have to walk into your back yard, and the show is
          every afternoon.  The hitch is you need special
          eyes to see it.  Or you can see MICROCOSMOS.  Two
          French biologists have developed cameras that have
          such eyes and have recorded a delightful 77 minutes
          of nature.  MICROCOSMOS is a film it would be
          nearly impossible to dislike.  It is educational,
          entertaining, and often quite funny.  Rating: high
          +2 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 10 positive, 1 negative, 0 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Few animal documentaries have ever done well as feature films.
Perhaps the last successful feature film about insects was THE
HELLSTROM CHRONICLE, made just over a quarter of a century ago.  But by
anybody's standards MICROCOSMOS is a remarkable documentary.  What we
have is a close-up look at a French meadow on a nice day.  We are here
in a secret garden to appreciate the afternoon of the fauna.  In the
course of the film we are going to spend a pleasant interlude just
admiring the very small forms of life, mostly insects, and learning to
appreciate their beauty and their noble traits.  Occasionally we see
something a big as a pheasant, and it does look grotesquely big and
ungainly as it pecks up unsuspecting ants.  But more often what we are
watching are ladybugs, caterpillars, and the occasional snail.  True
these are mostly animals you found boring in biology class, but in
MICROCOSMOS you will see them like you never saw them before.  This is
a G-rated film that is full of erotic sex and violence like your
teacher would never have wanted you to see.  Your high school would
have never let you observe the chance afternoon encounter and love-
making between two snails.  This is the scene that had members of the
audience panting.  For violence there is a knock down drag out fight
between two beetles that is genuinely exciting, even if you can't tell
one beetle from the other.  Spiders capture grasshoppers, spin webs and
knit them up, then suck their blood. Then there is the sheer beauty and
symmetry of a mosquito emerging from water, stretching its wings and
then disappearing faster than the eye can see.</P>
<P>     In the course of the film some of the creativity of insects is
amazing.  A water spider builds an underwater sanctuary by repeatedly
going to the surface, catching air on her body, returning underneath
the surface to contribute the air to a growing bubble.  When the bubble
is finally large enough, the spider pulls herself and her prey into the
bubble to peacefully enjoy a well-earned under-water meal.  Then there
is the dogged persistence of a scarab beetle rolling a ball of dung up
a hill, accidentally impaling it on a thorn, and then having to figure
out why it will no longer move.  Now admittedly, much of what we see
might be able to see free on NOVA.  But there they probably would
insist on telling you what you were seeing.  But the insects live
perfectly happily without names or words and with the exception of a
sentence or two at the beginning and end of the film the film is just
music and a few humorous sound effects.  There is no shortage of humor
and surprisingly some insects are natural comedians.  For example,
wonder turns to humor as we are watching a long caravan of caterpillars
walking nose to tail.  As they walk they merge with another line of
caterpillars like two traffic lanes merging for a tunnel.  When the
camera pulls back we realize that the line of caterpillars has merged
with itself and in now walking around in a pointless loop.  Or for the
pure amazement of it we watch an ant trying to break through the
surface tension of a drop of water to get a drink from the interior.</P>
<P>     MICROCOSMOS is directed by two French biologists, Claude Nuridsany
and Marie Perennou.  It took three years to shoot with special
photographic equipment that took two years to develop and with a
knowledge of wildlife that took fifteen years to accumulate.  Nuridsany
and Perennou have an incredible savvy for finding the parallels between
animal and human behavior, or just a knowledge of what is beautiful in
the animal world they take us to a prehistoric world with huge and odd
vegetation and strangely-shaped creatures.  They fumble, crawl, and
tumble for 77 minutes.</P>
<P>     MICROCOSMOS is entomological "Candid Camera."  Besides a few
overly corny sound effects, there is little to fault the film on.  I
rate it a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
