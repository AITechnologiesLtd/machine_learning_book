<P>     Were it better written and directed, this unaffecting fantasy might
come across as something other than leftovers from a high-powered
Hollywood lunch.  ("Let's get Whoopi!" "Yeah, and pair her with...  that
Frenchman!") There isn't much subtlety to this story of a little boy
(Haley Joel Osment), his imaginary friend (Gerard Depardieu), and the
grumpy guardian that the boy goes to live with (Whoopi Goldberg) after
his mother is killed in a car accident.  Spoon-feeding is the order of
the day and director Norman Jewison (MOONSTRUCK) overstates nearly every
emotion and related plot point.  (The incessant musical cues are also
tough to take, though I didn't mind hearing Louis Prima's "Banana Split
For My Baby" played during a soda-fountain fantasy sequence.)  Worst of
all is Whoopi's characterization.  Instead of coming across as a lovable
party poop, her self-absorbed actions suggest a level of negligence that
might send a social worker screaming from the theater.  Mercifully, the
darkness is cursed by two luminaries.  The kid, Osment, is a natural and
that Frenchman, with his loopy smile and bulbous nose, is an imaginary
giant for all ages. </P>
