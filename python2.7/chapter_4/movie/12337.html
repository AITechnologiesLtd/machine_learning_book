<PRE>DAWN OF THE DEAD aka ZOMBIES</PRE>
<P>Written and Directed by George A. Romero
Produced by Richard P. Rubenstein</P>
<PRE>Starring
Ken Foree ---- Peter
David Emge ---- Steven
Gaylen Ross ---- Fran
Scott H. Reineger ---- Roger</PRE>
<P>This is without doubt the greatest horror movie ever made,
and we should accept this without any further ado or arguments.
  You can forget Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare On Elm Street
or Scream, this is the one that got them all started.</P>
<P>A follow up to Romero's 1969 classic 'Night Of The Living Dead' see's
four main protagonists alone, scared and couped up in a large shopping
mall after fleeing the city, with the walking dead everywhere.</P>
<P>Up to the point where the group get to the mall is pretty much run of
the mill, social satire, city folks panicking and not wanting to hear
what they are being told, TV station controllers sending people out to
their deaths just to boost ratings and in the country, Rednecks using
the situation for target practice and a huge party.</P>
<P>When they reach themall the style of the film changes, if not the
points being made by Romero, and it is here where the film comes into
it's own, as we see the group transform from isolated outsiders
looking in on a situation to becoming drawn into the world of
consumerism that is staring them in the face.</P>
<P>At this point the film could have gone dead, but enter Tom Savini and
his gang of hells angels, with only one intent, taking the consumerist
goods for themselves.  What do they want them for? Where can they use
them?  It doesn't matter, they just want them, they just need them to
remind them of a world that once was.</P>
<P>Overall Romero leaves you with the question 'Who actually is worse,
the zombies who only attack the humans, or the humans who attack each
other for seemingly no reason at all?
O.K the performances from everyone (With the exception of genere fave
Foree) are somewhat lacking, but what the hell, this isn't an actors
movie, it's Romero's, and what a bloody good job he makes of it as
well.</P>
