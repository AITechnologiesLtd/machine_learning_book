<P>        No matter how many times you've seen "Pretty Woman," there's
still plenty about the Richard Gere/Julia Roberts film you don't know.</P>
<P>For instance, when Roberts first appears onscreen as the
down-on-her-luck hooker Vivian, she's wearing a coat the movie's
production team bought off a theater usher. A young Hank Azaria
("Tuesdays with Morrie," "Godzilla") plays the detective lurking around
outside her Hollywood
Boulevard apartment. And if you look carefully during a breakfast scene,
you can watch a pancake in Julia's hand turn into a croissant and then
back into a pancake again.</P>
<P>These and scores of other behind-the-scenes secrets are revealed
in director Garry Marshall's commentary on the "Pretty Woman - 10th
Anniversary Edition" DVD (Buena Vista Home Entertainment). In addition
to Marshall's often funny observations about the impact of the
enormously successful romantic comedy -- "tourists to this day still
come to the Regent Beverly
Wilshire looking for Julia Roberts or Vivian or ladies of the night;
they're not there," Marshall says with a sigh - the DVD adds an extra
six minutes worth of scenes left out of the theatrical release, some
candid video of Gere and Roberts horsing around on location, the
original trailer for the film, and a music video for Natalie Cole's
"Wild Women Do."</P>
<P>What are most intriguing, however, are the bits of gossip and
trivia Marshall dredges up. He's willing to identify the brief shots in
which a body double was employed for Roberts and quick to point out
every editing gaffe, noting in his defense that he'd rather make his
actors look good than worry about whether his heroine is holding a
pancake or a croissant in her hand.</P>
<P>In case you've forgotten, Roberts and Gere both look very good
indeed in "Pretty Woman," the movie which single-handedly elevated her
from ingenue to A-list star and revived his career, which had slumped
badly since the steamy days of "An Officer and a Gentleman" and
"Breathless."</P>
<P>Despite their different approaches to acting ("Richard liked to
rehearse; Julia liked to wing it," according to Marshall), the stars
proved to be electrifying together, a feat they repeated in last year's
"Runaway Bride." "Pretty Woman" certainly has its share of clever lines
and seductive moments, but it was ultimately the combined magic of Gere
and Roberts that propelled this modestly budgeted film to a worldwide
gross of $438 million.</P>
<P>"A nicer couple you rarely find," Marshall says of his stars.
Audiences obviously agreed. James Sanford</P>
