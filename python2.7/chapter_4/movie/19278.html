<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 and a half stars</P>
<P>Recently some of my readers have expressed their belief that I look for
depth and meaning in films even when I shouldn't be; that is, I look for
a profound message when I should be enjoying the ride for what it is
worth.  Whilst there is probably some truth behind this argument, in my
defense is this review of Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, a movie
that is as deep as a blonde joke and half as meaningful.  Yet there is
something entirely satisfying with Mike Myers' comedic formula that
makes this film a delightful romp from start to finish.  Occasionally
overworked and very occasionally problematic but never boring or
unfunny, The Spy Who Shagged Me has been accused of all sorts of
cinematic sins, but none that make it any less enjoyable for the viewer.
Thanks to an even livelier atmosphere than the first film, this piece of
lavish cinema is better than its predecessor in terms of wit, energy and
fun.  Which, I suppose, is what Austin Powers is all about - celebrating
life with a warped sense of humor and an acute sense of the absurd.  Or
perhaps, Mike Myers is just having fun.</P>
<P>Agent Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley, sexy star of the original) is
quickly and effectively disposed of in the opening scene of The Spy Who
Shagged Me, paving the way for Austin Powers' (Mike Myers) new partner,
Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) who he meets in 1969.  You see,
Austin's archenemy Dr Evil (Mike Myers) has traveled back in time and
stolen his "mojo", the thing that gives him his super shagedelic powers.
Austin must not only regain his mojo but also save the world from
destruction, as Dr Evil has built what he calls a "death star" on the
moon (Evil's son, Scott, played by Seth Green, is well aware of his lack
of ability to choose an original name).</P>
<P>The film movies smoothly along, introducing a spectrum of quirky
characters.  Fat Bastard (Mike Myers again) is an obese evil spy;
Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) is Dr Evil's one-eighth replica; and Frau
Farbissina (Mindy Sterling) is Dr Evil's peculiar love interest (well,
sort of).  Memorable moments include cameos from Jerry Springer (who is
fortunate to star in one of the film's best scenes), Woody Harrelson and
Willie Nelson; a hilarious rendition of 'What if God Was One of Us'; and
a clever scene that utilizes silhouettes on the side of a tent.</P>
<P>Everything is directed with a good sense of bad taste by filmmaker Jay
Roach, who succeeds on both commercial and artistic levels.  The Spy Who
Shagged Me has a colorful and engaging visual feel that captures the
lively spirit of the swinging sixties perfectly, thanks to its costume
design and cinematography by Ueli Steiger (Godzilla).  This film is one
of the better sequels of late, and definitely one of the funniest
comedies I've seen for awhile.  It's a refreshing picture that reminds
you of how good it is to laugh, and laugh loudly.  How would I feel
about another sequel?  Groovy, baby.</P>
