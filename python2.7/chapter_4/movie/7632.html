<PRE>                                CHASING AMY
                       A film review by Marty Mapes
                        Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) There is something about Kevin Smith's style that I just
don't like. I enjoyed Chasing Amy while I was watching it, but
afterwards I was glad it was over. In that sense it was like Pulp
Fiction. Both are fun to watch, but I was relieved to come out of the
theater and see that reality isn't like what was on screen.</P>
<P>To chase Amy is to regret having ruined your once-in-a-lifetime
relationship, as Holden (Ben Affleck) learns the hard way.</P>
<P>Holden lives with Banky (Jason Lee), and the two of them collaborate on
the comic book "Chronic and Bluntman." After a comic book convention,
they join two friends, Hooper and Alyssa (Dwight Ewell and Joey Lauren
Adams) for drinks.</P>
<P>While Banky and Hooper argue over the sexual orientation of the
characters in Archie comics, Holden and Alyssa get to know each other.</P>
<P>Alyssa invites Holden to a night club the next day and they hit it off
well. Holden is just starting to see the beginnings of a relationship
when Alyssa runs into her girlfriend and starts making out with her.
Naturally, Holden is disappointed and shocked. Later, while Alyssa and
Banky compare cunnilingus-related injuries, Holden moves from
disappointment to disgust and despair.</P>
<P>A few days later, Alyssa shows up to make amends with Holden. She
doesn't want their friendship to end. They become very good friends,
but Holden still wants more.</P>
<P>It turns out that Alyssa loves Holden enough to allow the relationship
to grow beyond friendship and all is well until Holden learns of her
sexual history with men.  This is too much for him and he calls the
relationship off. There is much soul-searching by all of the characters
before the movie reaches its logical conclusion.</P>
<P>The story is a refreshing twist on the standard romantic comedy, but
something about Kevin Smith's style leaves me feeling a little dirty.</P>
<P>First of all, this movie (like Clerks, his debut) is very
sex-centered.  His characters talk a lot about sex, which makes for
interesting, honest, and funny dialog, but the sum of the movie, then,
feels -- well, dirty. It seems that these characters live in a
mystical land far away from this reality -- another world where
everybody has sex with ten different partners by high school
graduation, then talks about it at length with strangers and
acquaintances.</P>
<P>Also, this movie has a very heterosexual male point of view. One might
say it borders on prejudice. Holden is okay with Alyssa's promiscuity
as a lesbian, but he can't accept the idea of her promiscuity with men.
Also, Alyssa's homosexuality is "cured" when she meets the right man.
The movie does handle this issue sensitively and carefully -- it is
within Alyssa's character to choose Holden -- but the whole idea seems
heterosexist. Imagine a counterexample: two friends, both male, one
gay. Imagine the gay friend falling hopelessly in love with the
straight friend. The straight friend is not likely to be swayed, no
matter how persistent the gay friend is. In fact, the awkwardness of
the situation might ruin their friendship.  But we accept the situation
when a charming heterosexual man wins over a sexually confused
lesbian.</P>
<P>Still, Chasing Amy has good characters, good dialog, and a good
screenplay.</P>
<P>Alyssa is a well developed character. She is not merely the object of
another character's desire, as is too often the case in romantic
comedies.  Hooper is a minor comic character but his wisdom adds a
rational voice to the movie. He is funny as the flaming homosexual
cartoonist whose plays the angry African-American in order to sell more
copies of his comic, "Cracker-Hatin' Coon." (This is another instance
of Smith the screenwriter walking a fine line between creating
interesting autonomous characters and furthering stereotypes.)</P>
<P>Banky and Holden share some good dialog. They disagree enough that
their discussions are always interesting, exposing all sorts of
different layers within different topics. When Holden and Alyssa talk,
they reveal their hearts to each other with a bare honesty uncommon in
most movies.</P>
<P>The story is simple enough, but Holden introduces an interesting twist
near the end which itself would have made for a clever ending. Smith
carries the story just a little further to explore the consequences of
that twist.</P>
<P>As repellent as I sometimes find Kevin Smith, I must admit that he is a
talented filmmaker. Chasing Amy appears to have been made on a
shoestring (albeit a bigger one than Clerks). Smith realizes that he
doesn't need special effects, slick lighting, or expensive sets to make
a good move. A good script, a few friends, and a promise to thank all
of his backers in the credits is all he needs.</P>
