Susan Granger's review of "REMEMBER THE TITANS" (Walt Disney Pictures)</P>
<P>  Back in 1971, when high school football was everything to
the residents of Alexandria, Virginia, local officials were forced to
integrate the schools and hire a black man, Herman Boone, as head
coach of the T.C. Williams Titans. First, he and the older, beloved
white coach with more seniority, Bill Yoast, had to learn to work
together. Then they were faced with molding a group of rebellious
teenage boys into a winning team while teaching them valuable lessons
about becoming men. Their respect, friendship and determination healed
a town torn by fear, ignorance and prejudice. Based on a true story,
scripted by Gregory Allen Howard, first-time director Boaz Yakin
propels the gradual process of discovery and bonding among the
participants. A highlight is the pre-dawn cross-country run,
culminating at the Gettysburg Battlefield, where Boone notes: "50,000
men died on this same field fighting the same battle we are still
fighting today...If we don't come together on this hallowed ground, we
too will be destroyed." Denzel Washington radiates intensity as the
tough-yet-fair taskmaster Boone, who divides his enraged players into
color-blind squads, offense and defense, at training camp, saying,
"football is about controlling that anger, harnessing that aggression
to achieve perfection," reminding them how, in mythology, the titans
were greater than the gods. Bill Patton strikes a different note as
the gentle, quiet, taciturn Yoast with his precocious, outspoken,
football-obsessed daughter (Hayden Panettiere) who provides comic
relief. What distinguishes this film is its honesty, a credit to the
young ensemble actor/players. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Remember the Titans" is an inspirational 8, an emotionally-uplifting
testament to the power of the human spirit.</P>
