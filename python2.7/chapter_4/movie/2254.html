<P>     THE PIANO is a film about passion, the most basic and primal
element of human nature.  No matter how thick the veneer of
civilization is, or how deeply-buried beneath layers of social
repression those latent emotions are, passion ultimately cannot be
denied.  This is something that the three principals of this movie
learn in various, not-always-pleasant, ways.</P>
<P>     In the mid-1800s, Ada (Holly Hunter) arrives on the stormy shores
of New Zeland, a mute bride sold by her father to a British emigrant
named Stewart (Sam Neill).  In addition to a normal assortment of
baggage, Ada brings with her eight-year old Flora (Anna Paquin), her
illegitimate daughter, and a piano.  Initially, Stewart declares that
the piano is too bulky to move from the beach, and resists bringing it
to his house despite Ada's wordless pleadings.  Next, he sells it to
fellow Englishman Baines (Harvey Keitel), a man who has embraced the
local Maori ways.  In addition to the piano, Baines wants a reluctant
Ada as his teacher.  When he offers her a deal to get the instrument
back, she is unprepared for the price she must ultimately pay.</P>
<P>     THE PIANO has powerful emotional themes resonating through it, all
dealing with the release of repressed passion.  Baines, who has
embraced the native Maori methods of living, no longer clings to the
values of British society, and is therefore quite capable of expressing
himself freely--which he does, albeit in some strange ways.  Stewart,
however, views the Maori with suspicion and hostility and, in clinging
to the tenants of English society, refuses to allow himself to feel
until one violent moment when everything comes pouring out.  Ada,
hampered as much by her lack of voice as by social pressures, is
yearning to break free, and only through Baines does she find the
courage to do so.</P>
<P>     Jane Campion's story is often stirring and occasionally
gut-wrenching; the latter perhaps to a fault.  There is a single
visceral scene in this movie which becomes the most stark and enduring
image taken from the theater.  While definitely an expression of
passion, this is perhaps not intended as the single defining moment of
THE PIANO, although it may be remembered as such.</P>
<P>     Symbolism abounds, and most of it is clear enough for even the
casual viewer to grasp.  Ada's piano is obviously more than a source of
music - it is her voice; her only means of expressing herself.  The
Maori society is representative of released inhibitions.  Stewart's
rejection of this, like Baines' acceptance, defines the basis of who he
is.  The final scenes of THE PIANO abound with symbols, the recognition
of which will help in understanding all the facets of the ending.</P>
<P>     The three main actors give dazzling performances.  Everything
previously written about Holly Hunter is true.  To be able to convey
this much energy and emotion without ever speaking a word (except in a
pair of short voiceovers) requires someone of astonishing talent and
ability.  Hunter's Ada is every bit as powerful a presentation as
Anthony Hopkins' Stevens in THE REMAINS OF THE DAY.</P>
<P>     Harvey Keitel is as good, although the complexities of his
character don't allow for quite as obvious a standout performance.  Sam
Neill has the most incomplete material to work from, but he does all he
can with Stewart.</P>
<P>     Like their adult counterparts, child actors come with varying
ranges of ability.  Anna Paquin is one of those who shows capabilities
far beyond her years.  While not in the category of a Valentina Scalici
(from IL LADRO DI BAMBINI, and who I have stated is the best child
performer I have ever seen), Ms. Paquin is ultimately believable in her
role, and a great asset to the film.  She compliments the main trio
effectively.</P>
<P>     As good as Ms. Campion's basic story is, both characterization and
technical presentation are lacking.  Taken in tandem, these flaws
prevent THE PIANO from attaining its full potential.</P>
<P>     While Ada is as fully-rounded as she can be, the others all have
elements missing from their personalities.  Stewart never attains
three-dimensionality, despite Sam Neill's best attempts, and Baines is
occasionally little more than a sounding board for Ada's emotions to
reverberate off of.  Flora's personality undergoes a radical shift
that, at best, is only partially-motivated by what we see on screen.</P>
<P>     The editing of THE PIANO is choppy, at times causing the narrative
to seem disjointed or confusing.  More than one transition is jarringly
abrupt.  There were several instances when my connection with the film
was broken because of this.</P>
<P>     It's odd that, with a name like THE PIANO, one of the weaknesses
is the score.  There are instances when Michael Nyman's themes are
inappropriate for the scenes where they are used, and it has been
pointed out to me that the New Age strains coming from Ada's instrument
have no place during the time period in which THE PIANO is supposed to
have taken place.</P>
<P>     THE PIANO is a good film with a potent message and occasional
splashes of genius, but it is not remarkable experience, except perhaps
where Holly Hunter's performance is concerned.  While it's true that
individuals will attribute different importance to the various flaws,
there exists the distinct possibility that those going to see THE PIANO
with the expectation of watching the best movie of the year, will leave
the theater disappointed.</P>
