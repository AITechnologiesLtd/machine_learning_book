<P>Susan Granger's review of 'THE MOD SQUAD" (MGM)</P>
<P>       Let's face it..."The Mod Squad" wasn't that cool when it was on
ABC television 30 years ago (Sept.'68 to August '73) and it certainly
hasn't improved with age. If anything, it's deteriorated - and today's
teenagers, who are the target audience, weren't even alive when the
series aired. For those who don't remember, "The Mod Squad" were
juvenile delinquents - Peggy Lipton, Michael Cole, and Clarence
Williams 3rd - who plea-bargained their way out of custody by agreeing
to work with The Man fighting crime undercover. It was a
counter-culture thing that appealed to the late '60s, early '70s
mentality.  This time 'round Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, and Omar
Epps are the teenagers who are enlisted to work as undercover police
operatives, reporting to gruff but kindly Dennis Farina.  The plot -
and I use that word loosely - revolves around a cache of drugs that
disappears from a police evidence locker. "The Mod Squad" is supposed
to find it. "I'm getting too old for this," they moan, just as they
did on the TV series, but it's a line that's far more believable when
muttered by Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in one of the many "Lethal
Weapon" sequels. Basically, the dialogue is drivel. Written by Stephen
Kay, Kate Lanier and Scott Silver, and directed by Mr. Silver, this
film has nothing, absolutely nothing to recommend it except that it's
short, so you only waste 94 minutes of your time. So, on the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Mod Squad" is a thudding 1. It's the Clod
Squad. There is no excuse for a movie being quite this lame and
stupid.</P>
