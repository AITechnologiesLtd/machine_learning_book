<PRE>Princess Mononoke (1997)</PRE>
<P>Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki
Re-released and dubbed by Miramax in 1999</P>
<P>More than half way through the movie, I was reminded of Tsui Hark's
classic Hong Kong movie "Once Upon a Time in China." What can a Kung fu
political movie possibly have in common with a full-length Japanese
animation, you might ask? Well, they both have a complicated and
melodramatic story, a large number of characters, exciting visuals,
somewhat ambiguous morals stands, and way too many conflicts.</P>
<P>The story of Princess Mononoke is actually the story of a young man
named Ashitaka, who is infected with a deadly curse on his arm after he
kills a boar-turned-demon that is terrorizing his home town. In search
for a cure of this curse that's slowly eating him away, he gets on his
elk and sets for the far and away land full of gods and spirits, demons
and monsters, all sharing and fighting over the biggest forest you have
seen on a screen.</P>
<P>The real Princess Mononoke (San, dubbed by Claire Danes), was not
seriously introduced after almost 1/3 into the movie. Before that, was a
mingled and busy introduction of a bunch of other characters, including
Jigo, a monk on a undetermined mission (dubbed by Billy Bob Thorton),
Lady Eboshi, the leader of an industrial town that destroys the forest
for iron and hire former brothel-girls to make firearms (dubbed by
Minnie Driver). The plot takes way too long to cut into the central
conflict with the forest spirit and the wild animals on one side and the
iron town and the hunters on the other. But the ambitious filmmakers are
not satisfied with just one conflict, so he throws in a group of vicious
samourai, a tribe of boars driven out of their own home land, a bunch of
skeptical apes, an army of hunters wearing animal skin. Non of these
groups are exactly allies or simply enemies. The audience, just like
Ashitaka, have a real hard time taking sides and root for any one of
them, because the movie takes a lot of time (too much, I think) to
convince us that Lady Eboshi, even though she wants to destroy the
forest and animals for her own gain, is also a good leader and
compassionate woman. The monk Jigo, even though he wants to cut off the
forest spirit's head and sell it as the fountain of youth to the
Empiror, is a rather humorous character. Although our environmentalist
urge pushes us toward the side of the wolf girl San, her wolf tribe, and
the forest, the wild animals are obviously not just the victims and
often show their hostility and sharp teeth to the hero.</P>
<P>The moral ambiguity makes the story interesting, but the noise from all
groups and so many side characters dilute the main conflict and make the
plot cluttered and confused. The most annoying is the ape tribe, who
showed up convenient to serve no other purpose but to slow down the
heroes and the story by throwing small objects at them and making mean
comments. I'd rather see Miyazaki completely abandon some of these
miscelleneous subplots and concentrate on the main story line.</P>
<P>Another consequence of the moral ambiguity is the feeble and naive plea
of Ashitaka -- Hatred is bad. Can't we all get along? The appeal of the
central character is significantly impaired. Ashitaka is perhaps the
most bland hero I've seen for a while. He is so boring, dull, and blah,
that I secretly cheered the ending that did not have the two lovers live
together happily ever after. In fact, there is almost no chemistry
between San and Ashitaka. With far less screen time, San still comes
through as more interesting than her boyfriend, benefiting little more
than a fierce presence. The most fascinating character, however, is the
powerful and mysterious Lady Eboshi, calm, intelligent, dominating,
seductive.</P>
<P>The biggest merit of this movie is its incredible visual imagination.
There is no substitute for the sheer rush of seeing the breath-taking
images of mythical spirits towering over the land, thousands of cute
little tree ghosts (looking very much like aliens in The X-files except
being white instead of green) raining down, trees dying and falling. I
repeatedly have chills running down my spine at every shot of the
ferocious battle between the Nature and humans. I have never seen any
image in animation so powerful that it blows my mind. The magic and
creativity and sheer power of the battle scenes make Disney's The Lion
King look like a joke.</P>
<P>I never thought animations can transmit the impression of natural
surrounding so well. Simply imitating reality is not enough. Here
Miyazaki and his team successfully replicate the FEEL of the Nature, and
the audience have the illusion of being actually engulfed in the
mythical forest.</P>
<P>Another interesting achievement is the fight scenes in this movie.
Albeit short and sporatic, the fights are exciting and well drawn. The
excessive gore and blood, however, seem a bit over done.</P>
<P>The English dialogue is competently done, from the script translation to
dubbing.</P>
<P>The conflicts between the advancing humans and wild animals actually
remind me of the conflict between white men and Native Americans, even
though that was probably not what Miyazaki had in mind. With a more
interesting hero and more concentrated writing, it could have been an
animation that is not only incredible-looking, but also
thought-provoking.</P>
