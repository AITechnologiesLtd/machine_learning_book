 Walt Disney Pictures

Lisa Ann Walter, Elaine Hendrix</P>
<P>   In the movie "Love and Death on Long Island" Giles De'ath
(John Hurt) tells young Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley) that
if Shakespeare were alive today, he'd be making movies like
"Hot Pants College."  An exaggeration perhaps.  A more
realistic project for the Bard, were he alive now, would be a
film like "The Parent Trap."  Nancy Meyers's romantic comedy
has the elements that Elizabethan audiences were so fond of:
mistaken identity, outrageous coincidences, and parallel,
romantic subplots.  If Dan Quayle were a member of the
Academy, he'd vot, er, vote an award for "The Parent Trap"
not because it's Shakespearean ("what's that"?) but because
it epitomizes family values.  How could it not?  "The Parent
Trap" is essentially the story of twin girls, eleven years old,
who are despondent because each one is missing one
parent.  When their folks got divorced while the little girls were
just a few months ago, one went to live with her dad in
California's Napa Valley while the other hung out with her
Mom in the Belgravia section of London.  The twins were
quite comfortable financially, but you just can't beat the
healthy, two-parent family.</P>
<P>   The 1998 film is a re-make of the sunny 1961 comedy
which starred Hayley Mills in both roles.  They appeared
together in various scenes then, but you could always tell that
they were just one kid pasted onto the other.  With special
effects at the current high level, only an expert could tell that
Walt Disney productions needed to pay only one salary.</P>
<P>   The story begins as Martin (Simon Kunz), London butler to
clothing designer Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson) bids
a tearful goodbye to Elizabeth's daughter, Annie (newcomer
Lindsay Lohan), who is about to spend an eight-week season
in a camp in Maine.  Coincidentally, the twin sister she has
never met, Hallie Parker, is also a camper, a girl who lives
with her dad Nick (Dennis Quaid) in the Napa Valley
vineyards.  At first, they spot a resemblance.  It takes them
quite a while to compare notes and to realize that they have
matching DNAs, and from that time on, they are determined
to live together under one roof with both parents.  They
concoct a delightful plan to bring their folks together by
rekindling their romance.  As in all romantic comedies, the
man and woman must encounter many obstacles, becoming a
collective only in the final scene. The principal deterrent here
is that dad is about to marry a gorgeous publicist, Meredith
Blake (Elaine Hendrix), so the girls must use all their charm
and cunning to get her out of the picture.</P>
<P>   The two-hour length of the movie may signify that director
Meyers--who wrote the screenplay together with Charles
Shyer and David Swift--is targeting an adult audience.  The
movie does have an appeal to kids (it's from the sort of novel
that junior high school teachers used to call a girls' story). 
But while the excellent Lindsay Lohan is in virtually every
scene, "The Parent Trap" is really about the parents.  We
don't know why they broke up so soon, almost twelve years
ago. After all, they enjoyed an idyllic honeymoon aboard the
QE2.  All we grasp is that "he made me nuts," as Elizabeth
says in passing.  In other words, you don't spend your life on
the QE2 and re-marriage, even with yet another honeymoon
on the Big Lady, is likely as not to end in divorce.  We don't
want to think of that possibility, though, because everyone in
the film--with one exception--is so charming and bubbly.  The
one character we don't like is the money-grubbing publicist,
Meredith, who may have a thing for Nick's physique as well,
but who simply does not like kids or camping the way he
does.</P>
<P>   "The Parent Trap" is filled with comic moments: the kids
play ingenious but devastating tricks on one another in camp
and in a couple of cases, they give their nemesis, Meredith,
enough rope to hang herself in Nick's eyes.  Lisa Ann Walter
and Simon Kunz are the congenial subplot, butlers of the
principal adults, who mirror their bosses with their own
romance.  Natasha Richardson, usually known for tougher
roles, is enormous appealing as the vulnerable albeit
successful woman, Dennis Quaid's grin is as fetching as ever,
and Lindsay Lohan turns in a striking turn with flawless British
and American accents as the girl who puts her folks through
an experience twice upon a time.</P>
