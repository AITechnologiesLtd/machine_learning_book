<PRE>"Babies are obviously more dangerous than we thought."
                                - Mantegna to Pantoliano & Haley</PRE>
<P>     Expand the final fifteen minutes of HOME ALONE into a
feature-length film and you've got BABY'S DAY OUT--an agreeably
amusing children's comedy about a bumbling band of kid kidnappers who
are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant.</P>
<P>     The plot tracks a trio of crooks-posed-as-photographers (Mantegna,
Pantoliano, Haley) who steal nine-month-old Bennington August Cottwell
IV, aka Baby Bink, from his old-money home.  But the plan goes awry
when Baby crawls out an open window and into the streets of downtown
Chicago!  Following the path of his favorite story, called "Baby's Day
Out," Baby rides a bus and visits the zoo and winds up at a skyscraper
construction site.</P>
<P>     While Baby stays unscathed, the crooks fare worse for the wear.
The stooges get hit by boards and dropped from roofs and, of course,
suffer multiple crotch injuries.  (John Wayne Bobbitt should probably
steer clear of this one.)</P>
<P>     Like he did in PLANES, TRAINS, and AUTOMOBILES, John Hughes again
demonstrates his mastery of the simple set-up and extended execution.
Here, he's aided and abetted by a director, Patrick Read Johnson, whose
choreography could rival a Coen brother.  Best bit: baby crawling
across a busy city street.</P>
<P>     BABY'S DAY OUT has only two emotions--awww and ouch--and the
actors play them accordingly.  Forget the cartoon concern of Lara Flynn
Boyle or Cynthia Nixon, disposable as mom and nanny, respectively, the
ones to watch are the ones who are wincing.</P>
<P>     Joe Mantegna is a great head stooge, barking lines like "that
little doo-doo machine is my retirement money." Brian Haley has a great
scene with a gorilla, while Joe Pantolianto plays Curly to Mantegna's
Moe. *He* is funny.</P>
<P>     Needless to say, twins Adam and Jacob Warton are adorable beyond
belief.</P>
<PRE>Bottom Line:   BABY'S DAY OUT is an agreeable children's comedy with
               noticeable nods to Looney Tunes, Rube Goldberg, O.  Henry,
               and Moe Howard.  Perfect for kids and well as any adult
               diagnosed with the Y-chromosome anomaly commonly called
               "the curly gene."  Nyuk nyuk nyuk.</PRE>
