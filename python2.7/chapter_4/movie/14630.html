<PRE>.                             PERMANENT MIDNIGHT
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Well, there's nothing like missing a fad by a few years to show
how *really* behind the curve you are.  PERMANENT MIDNIGHT, the new
film about the rise and fall... well, mostly the fall... of TV writer
Jerry Stahl should prove to be the final nail in the short-lived, and
now painful-to-watch, genre: the drug movie.</P>
<P>     Perhaps best known as the chief influence behind the TV show
"ALF," MIDNIGHT is a simplistic retelling of Stahl's tell-all
autobiography.  Ben Stiller, the only remotely passable part of this
film, plays Stahl with gusto, but twenty minutes of Stiller going
berserk as a strung-out junkie are more than enough.</P>
<P>     Sadly, that's all this movie is: a whopping 85 minutes of Stiller
on heroin.  There's precious little about his life before or after his
addiction.  It's just a few pages out of the life of a junkie.  And I
couldn't have cared less.  Plot development?  Ha!  First-time director
Veloz obviously feels it's beneath him.</P>
<P>     Maybe the worst part of MIDNIGHT is that it's told completely in
flashback, as Stahl reminisces to some blonde girl who picks him up at
a fast food joint.  Played by Maria Bello, this outta-nowhere
character is so devoid of, well, of *anything* that my cat could have
played her with the same conviction.  Bello had best start rethinking
that "ER" departure, *pronto*.</P>
<P>     I won't waste any more time droning about how bad PERMANENT
MIDNIGHT is.  But I will say one thing: at least it explains a lot
about "ALF."</P>
