<P>America's Sweethearts could have been the summer's best romantic comedy but
will instead be remembered as one of the season's biggest disappointments.
Don't get me wrong - the film isn't awful, and, at times, it's quite
entertaining.  Given the A-list cast, however, things should have clicked a
little louder and a lot more often.</P>
<P>Sweethearts points its magnifying glass at the seedy world of Hollywood
promotion - specifically, the press junket for a film called Time Over Time,
which re-teams America's two favorite actors, husband and wife Gwen Harrison
and Eddie Thomas (Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusack from High Fidelity).
Time is the 10th film the lovebirds have made together, but there are two
major problems giving the film's producer (Stanley Tucci, Joe Gould's
Secret) fits of anxiety.  For starters, Gwen and Eddie split up over a year
ago, and to make matters worse, the director (scene-stealing Christopher
Walken) has hijacked the final cut of the $87 million picture, leaving a
beleaguered publicist named Lee (Billy Crystal, Analyze This) to do some
creative spin control.</P>
<P>Lee's plan is to make the junket media believe Gwen and Eddie are back
together, because "When (they're) together, the press forgets there's no
film."  Easier said than done, considering Eddie has spent the last 18
months at The Wellness Center with a Bowfinger-like Svengali (a hilarious
Alan Arkin).  Gwen won't be any easier to sway as she is convinced Eddie is
a homicidal maniac out to get her and is currently involved with a Latin
lover type named Hector (Hank Azaria, Tuesdays With Morrie).</P>
<P>Julia Roberts (The Mexican) plays Kiki, the careworn assistant (and sister)
of Gwen, who, as we learn in a flashback, used to be 60 pounds heavier and
has always carried a torch for Eddie.  Kiki is the calm, kindly, intelligent
Ying to Gwen's bitchy, self-centered and dumb Yang, and thusly, we must root
not for Eddie and Gwen to reconcile, but for Eddie to realize he really
loves Kiki.  He's Lloyd Dobler, for Christ's sake - he should be with a real
girl.</P>
<P>In addition to failing to go far enough in its attempt to satirize the star
mentality, Sweethearts also delivers the moral that you can't win the guy
unless you lose a bunch of weight.  Aside from Roberts, the leads are all
way too annoying and bland, and are easily outshined by each supporting
role. And if it seems to you like Crystal gets all of the script's good
jokes, it's because he wrote it (with Bedazzled's Peter Tolan).  This is the
first film directed by Joe Roth since 1990's Coupe de Ville (he's the guy
who left Disney to create the studio that made Sweethearts).</P>
<P>The Hector role, which was supposed to go to crackhead Robert Downey, Jr, is
completely overused and becomes an increasing aggravation in Sweethearts
final reel.  The more Hector talks, the more he sounds like a gay Apu from
The Simpsons.  What's with the white guy playing a Latino, anyway?  Why not
get Antonio Banderas or Luis Guzman?  And, Jesus H. Christ - is anybody else
tired of seeing celebrities in fat suits?  Hope not, because after Julia
(and the talentless Martins Short and Lawrence), we'll see Gwyneth don one
in a few months for the Farrelly brothers' Shallow Hal.</P>
<P>The more clueless critics who are familiar with junkets will love the inside
jokes (a la Roberts' Notting Hill) without realizing the film is making fun
of how incredibly stupid they are.  The audience gets the same treatment,
learning that the quality of a film doesn't matter one bit compared to what
the tabloids are writing about its stars.  But the ultimate irony is that a
film that preaches about the promotion of a dud is itself a dud.</P>
<P>1:40 - PG-13 for language, some crude and sexual humor</P>
