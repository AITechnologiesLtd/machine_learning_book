Capsule Review - July 19, 1999.</P>
<P>One of several movies Drew Barrymore made in 1997 that dodged the big screen 
and are only now reaching home video, Adam Park's "Wishful Thinking" is at 
least a step above "Best Men," which is also currently available on video, 
but that isn't saying much. The film is clearly an indie and not a big-budget 
studio picture, which may have been another reason it bypassed theaters, as 
it recounts the troubles that a close couple are having from three different 
points-of-view: Max (James LeGros), the jealous boyfriend; Elizabeth 
(Jennifer Beals), the misunderstood girlfriend; and Lena (Drew Barrymore), 
Max's co-worker at a movie theater who pines for him from afar. All three 
leads are charismatic (particularly Beals, who deserves more film roles), and 
the unorthodox structure is similar to "Pulp Fiction" and "Go," but the 
screenplay, including the dialogue, too often wanders into unnecessary 
silliness, and the ending leaves something to be desired. Jon Stewart, as a 
good-natured man Elizabeth falls for, is a standout. Too bad the movie itself 
isn't as entertaining as he is. </P>
