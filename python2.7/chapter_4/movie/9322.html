<PRE>Soul Food       
Review by Larry McGillicuddy
Copyright Larry McGillicuddy</PRE>
<P>**** (out of 4)
Directed by George Tillman Jr.
Starring Vanessa Williams, Vivica Fox, Nia Long, Brandon Hammond, Mekhi 
Phifer, Michael Beach, Irma P. Hall, Gina Ravera</P>
<P>There is a scene early in Soul Food, George Tillman's comedy-drama about 
a large African-American family and the ordeals they go through during a 
crisis, that caught me completely off guard. During a wedding, the groom 
is flirting with some tramp, and in an attempt to to prevent a scene, his 
mother in law, played by Irma P. Hall, comes to the rescue. The way in 
which she does this makes me think Irma P. Hall is one of the greatest 
actresses around right now. However, this is just one magical moment in a 
movie filled with them.</P>
<P>Vanessa Williams, Vivica Fox, and Nia Long star as three sisters who have 
each gone their own way in life. Williams is Teri,  a successful lawyer, 
who is frustrated by her husband Miles attempts at a music career. Fox is 
Maxine, the strongest of the sisters, which can be confirmed by the 
stability of her marriage and the wisdom of her son Ahmad, who narrates 
the film. Long is Bird, a hairdresser who is the last of the three to get 
married. Her husband Lem is an intense passionate individual whose temper 
gets the best of him sometime but never stops loving. At the center of 
everything is Irma P. Hall, as Big Mama Jo.</P>
<P>Every Sunday, the family gathers together for dinner at Mama Jo's house. 
There is lots of conversation, lots of laughs, and the occasional 
controversy. Mama Jo presides over the family like all mothers should. 
She is stern and disciplined, but also caring and forgiving.</P>
<P>Everything is going fine, until a tragedy befalls Mama Jo. All of a 
sudden, a chain reaction of events begin to destroy the family. It gets 
so bad, Sunday dinner is even cancelled. Without Mama Jo's guidance, 
there is noone to keep the family together, which frustrates Ahmad.</P>
<P>Miles and Maxine's marriage begins to fall apart, as he focuses on his 
music and flirts with the troublesome Faith. Lem's temper gets the best 
of him when his convict past starts to catch up to him. And Teri tries to 
prevent Maxine's efforts to sell Mama Jo's house. The third act of the 
film deals with Ahmad's attempts to patch things up. He decides to take 
over where Mama Jo left off, and tries to get the family back together 
for one more Sunday dinner.</P>
<P>The acting by everyone in the ensemble is outstanding, with special 
notices to Irma P. Hall and Brandon Hammond. Hall gives a performance 
that deserves to be recognized by the academy. Her Mama Jo is one of the 
most memorable characters I have ever encountered in a movie. Brandon 
Hammond is an actor with a bright future. He is wise enough not to play 
cutesy and shows an admirable range and depth, and speaks the final lines 
of the movie on the perfect note.</P>
<P>Tillman obviously based this movie on his own memories of growing up. 
Every scene in the movie is purposeful and convincing (except maybe an 
odd flashback sequence). The dialogue is beleiveable and funny. And then 
there's the food. Tillman gives us several close ups of the soul food, 
and it indeed looks very tasty. I can see why Sunday dinners became such 
a tradition for this family. Soul Food is one of the most purely 
entertaining movies of the year. </P>
