<P>How many people remember when Bill Clinton, soon after being elected in
1992, appeared in the spring of 1993 mingling with a group of working
folks, complete with a hard-hat, tool belt and work boots.  Clinton took
it upon himself, after the meeting, to discipline an aide using
profanity after the aide supposedly stepped out of line during the
address.  This was evident as the President's microphone was still on
and the media had a field day.  In fairness to Clinton, every politician
has two faces, one for the cameras, and one for the private
confrontations with staff, family members and advisers.  What's the
point of all this?  Simple, 'Primary Colors' gives us an insight into
the REAL people running for office.</P>
<P>In 1995's 'The American President', Michael Douglas portrayed a stable
and popular President who was seen spending time with his daughter over
her school work, playing pool in private with his chief of staff and
courting a young woman with all the style, personality and conflict of
regular people.  Although 'Primary Colors' takes a deeper and more
iconoclastic look at politics on a much different scale, it has
chronological scenes of strategic planning necessary to win a political
campaign and it manages to entertain and inform while being precariously
off beat.</P>
<P>The major players are John Travolta, simulating brilliantly, a very
Clinton-like Presidential candidate, complete with the right hair,
weight and upbeat, pleasant southern accent.  Given the name Jack
Stanton by screenwriter Elaine May, 'Primary Colors' is based on the
novel by Anonymous, now revealed to be former Newsweek writer Joe Klein
and Stanton's mannerism is that of a man who cares about the people,
even in private as his campaign candidly admits that their political
tricks are a defensive mechanism to prevent the status quo from stealing
the election.  One scene has Stanton sitting alone in a doughnut shop
talking to a doughnut baker and night server, an employee who works long
hours for little money.  Stanton realizes that these are the real
people, the majority avoiding the trappings of special interest.  It's a
very memorable scene.</P>
<P>At his side is Stanton's wife and aspiring first lady, portrayed
impressively by Emma Thompson who loses her English accent completely to
play an American.  Stanton is joined in his quest for the White House by
Henry Burton (Adrian Lester), who is the grandson of a civil rights
leader and the story is told largely from his point of view.  Billy Bob
Thornton ('Sling Blade') is an adviser to Stanton who never lets his
true redneck colors interfere with the strategy of winning the people
over.  Rounding out the perennial cast of memorable players is Kathy
Bates as a political spin doctor, brought in to counter the dirty tricks
of Stanton's opponents.  Her contribution to the film is of the highest
calibre and she is already a candidate for a Supporting Actress Oscar
next year.</P>
<P>'Primary Colors' asks us to believe nothing,.  Using very adult language
and situations, it only intends to expose the inner workings of a
presidential campaign as its running time of 2 hours and 23 minutes is a
swift one as director Mike Nichols re-invents the characters situations
many times to seem like their fresh when they are really relevant to the
previous scenes of vigour, reality and determination to conquer the only
cherished object of politics.....power.  And while the film lacks a
certain amount of depth, it makes up for it by itemizing the true nature
of what politicians are, fallible human beings like the rest of us.</P>
