<P>"Dancer, Texas Pop. 81," is one of those minor small-town films in which 
not much happens, but it is enjoyable nonetheless just to watch the 
characters.</P>
<P>The title gives way to the setting of the movie, which is a tiny desert 
town that, yes, has a population of only 81. At the start of the film, 
four teenage friends are about to graduate from high school (their class 
only consists of one other person), and promised each other when they 
were 12 that once they graduated, they would set off together for L.A. 
At the head of the group is Keller (Breckin Meyer), the person who is 
the most positive he wants to get out. Terrel Lee (Peter Facinelli) is 
being forced to help out with his father's oil business, and doesn't 
know how to break the news to his friends that he can't go. Squirrel 
(Ethen Embry) is the most eccentric of the group, and has a very bad 
family life, living in a motor home with a father who doesn't really 
care about him, or know what's going on half the time. And John (Eddie 
Mills) is also unsure about going, after his father tells him he has a 
great talent for ranching, which is something he loves.</P>
<P>There are no big, dramatic scenes in "Dancer, Texas Pop. 81," nor are 
there any big plot developments. Instead, it is simply a series of 
scenes and vignettes involving all of the characters, and director 
McCanlies, making his film debut, proves that he is a very assured 
writer. The cinematography, with the open skies and empty landscapes, 
are gorgeous to look at.</P>
<P>There actually are no real problems with the film; it is just that it is 
so laid-back and slight that the picture couldn't possibly be any better 
than merely "good." </P>
<P>The four main actors are all fine, but it actually is a few supporting 
performances that stand out, particularly Ashley Johnson, as John's 
12-year-old sister, Josie, and Alexandra Holden, as Keller's female 
friend whom he always confides in with his problems.</P>
<P>"Dancer, Texas Pop. 81," is by no means an earth-shattering, important 
film. It is neither complex nor any sort of award-winner. But it is 
quiet and entertaining, and I'm glad I saw it.</P>
