<P>     If there was ever an action movie that didn't warrant a sequel, 
it's SPEED.  However, the film grossed enough money to be numbered among 
the big summer hits of 1994, and the unfortunate result is this film, 
which reunites director Jan de Bont with leading lady Sandra Bullock, 
while leaving Keanu Reeves somewhere safe and dry, "working on his 
music" with his band, Dogstar.  Considering the dubious quality of the 
final product, this may be the wisest decision of the young actor's 
career.  SPEED 2 can be numbered among the worst second chapters ever 
made. </P>
<P>     The original SPEED was an entertaining jolt of pure adrenaline that 
took everyone by surprise.  De Bont was an instant success and Bullock 
became a hot commodity.  It was almost inevitable that any sequel, no 
matter how thrilling, would be a letdown.  What no one anticipated was 
how sharply the downturn would be.  Not only is SPEED 2 missing the 
first movie's main character, but the excitement seems to have departed 
with him. </P>
<P>     This time around, Keanu Reeves' Jack Traven has been replaced by 
Jason Patric's Alex Shaw.  For the most part, they're the same person 
(it shouldn't surprise anyone to learn that Alex was originally written 
as Jack), and their function is identical.  The highest paid member of 
the cast, Sandra Bullock, is back as Annie.  Now, having broken up with 
Jack, she's in the midst of a long-term relationship with Alex.  Things 
are a little rocky between them, so Alex comes up with a solution:  a 
romantic cruise to the Caribbean on the SEABOURN LEGEND.  However, just 
like John McLane in the DIE HARD series, Annie is about to find herself 
in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Also aboard the SEABOURN LEGEND 
is a mentally-unstable computer genius named John Geiger (played without 
any panache by Willem Dafoe) who intends to take over the ship, crank 
the engines up to full power, and crash it into something very big. </P>
<P>     SPEED 2 is a classic example of "sound and fury, signifying 
nothing."  Only, in this case, that "nothing" isn't bolstered by the 
high-energy tension and tremendous special effects of de Bont's previous 
excursion, TWISTER.  SPEED 2 is lackluster -- the plot methodically 
drives the film from one action set-piece to another, and the visuals 
are merely adequate.  In fact, the only real thrill offered by SPEED 2 
comes during the bloated movie's final half-hour (as the ship's 
collision course becomes apparent).  By then, it's too little, too late. </P>
<P>     The original SPEED was frantically paced and featured a number of 
individuals that, in spite of their two-dimensionality, were likable and 
exhibited human characteristics.  We felt like we were trapped on the 
bus with them.  This time, the pace and characters are mechanical, and 
it doesn't seem as if we're actually on board the endangered cruise 
ship.  Instead, we're watching form a detached vantage point, noticing 
details that we're not supposed to be paying attention to (like what 
kind of lighting best highlights Bullock's features) or waiting in vain 
for someone to break into a chorus of "The Love Boat." </P>
<P>     Jason Patric has one mode: serious.  The actor, who is best suited 
to introspective, brooding roles (as in THE JOURNEY OF AUGUST KING), 
treats this ridiculous screenplay like it's WAR AND PEACE.  There's no 
sense of fun or goofiness.  I never thought I would admit to missing 
Reeves, but that's the situation here -- at least he understood the 
right tone to adopt.  Meanwhile, Bullock plays the same part the same 
way (albeit for a lot more money) -- she looks cute, gets involved in a 
couple of action scenes, and is taken hostage.  But she and Patric never 
click; their chemistry is glacial. </P>
<P>     Since Dennis Hopper's Howard Payne was decapitated at the end of 
SPEED, the sequel needs a new villain.  Enter Willem Dafoe, who's 
usually a good psycho.  Not here, though.  Geiger has no manic energy, 
and Dafoe doesn't seem particularly excited to be playing him.  SPEED 2 
is the kind of film that demands a strong opponent, but Geiger isn't it.  
Meanwhile, there are a few interesting cameos:  Tim Conway and Bo 
Svenson have small parts, and SPEED veterans Joe Morton and Glenn 
Plummer are on hand for a couple of scenes. </P>
<P>     Watching SPEED 2, I felt embarrassed for everyone involved.  Sure, 
they're all being well-paid, but no one wants a $120 million flop on 
their resume.  And, once the word gets out about how disappointing this 
movie is, crowds will dwindle.  There are enough action alternatives out 
there to sate the public's summer appetite.  Someone should have 
recognized what an appropriate metaphor the climactic sequence (which 
features massive destruction) is for the entire film.  SPEED 2 appears 
headed for a box office disaster of titanic proportions.  Creatively and 
entertainment-wise, it's already sunk. </P>
