<PRE>BY SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>There is a scene in "The Replacements" (actually, two scenes, since the
film has a tendency to repeat itself for the benefit of those with short
memories) where a dim-witted stripper-turned-cheerleader enthusiastically
joins in one of those "Give me an 'E'!" cheers, only to forget the letter
she's supposed to announce. Fortunately, though, she's so happy and so
dim that she just keeps going along with the others as if her gaffe had 
never happened in the first place.</P>
<P>This sequence is perfectly representative of "The Replacements" as a 
whole. This is a pretty dumb movie, but it is so cheerfully dumb that, in
the end, it's hard to really dislike it. It's got an embarrassingly 
recycled plot, tepid character development, and mostly lame humor. But 
Hollywood has produced far poorer movies, and maybe that's the best way to
think about "The Replacements" -- not great, but think of how it could
have turned out!</P>
<P>I can almost guarantee that you've seen the story before; it's the same
old underdog-team-makes-good template, just recast in a new setting. "The
Replacements" takes place during the 1987 professional football players'
strike, albeit in a parallel universe where the NFL teams have been
replaced by squads with different nicknames. Edward O'Neil (Jack Warden),
owner of perpetual also-rans the Washington Sentinels, is determined to
see his team finally make it into the playoffs after seven years. 
Washington just needs to win three of their last four games, and they're
in. O'Neil decides to finish off the season using replacement players, and
hires coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) to assemble them.</P>
<P>Instead of bringing in a semi-pro team like some other franchises have
done, McGinty seeks out a group of has-beens and never-weres. This motley
group includes such notables as a sumo wrestler, a pair of gangsta
brothers, and a lightning-fast receiver with permanent butterfingers. The
quarterback is Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), a college star who has never
recovered mentally from a crushing Sugar Bowl defeat. The movie proceeds
in typical fashion from there. We experience the trials and tribulations
of the scab Sentinels as they try to bond as a team, deal with the
resentful striking players they've replaced, and find themselves on a
collision course with the inevitable Big Game which will decide the
season. No points for guessing how it all pans out.</P>
<P>There is, of course, an obligatory romantic subplot, between Falco and the
head cheerleader (Brooke Langton). This scenes are excruciating in their
contrivance. It is painfully obvious that the romance has been added to
the movie because the filmmakers felt it was a necessity of the genre,
rather than a natural outgrowth of the story. It is telling that the
camera and film editor do more work to establish the relationship than 
Reeves and Langton. The scene where they first meet is particularly
embarrassing -- just count the number of times we cut back and forth 
between their wistful glances at one another. It would be hilarious if it
wasn't played so straight. Langton's is the most superfluous character in
"The Replacements", and the fact that she never develops any semblance of
an interesting personality doesn't help matters.</P>
<P>And this is unfortunate, because the other subplot involving the
cheerleaders -- namely, the fact that the hastily-assembled squad is
mostly made up of exotic dancers -- is surprisingly well-handled. It's a
very funny notion, and is not carried too far. The only thing that doesn't
make much sense is just why a new group of cheerleaders would have been
required in the first place; why in the world would a players' strike
affect them? (Of course, the same could be said about the need for O'Neil
to hire McGinty.)</P>
<P>Neither Reeves nor Hackman turn in particularly memorable work here. It
seems obvious that the part of their brain normally devoted to acting is
instead being put to work figuring out just why they agreed to appear in a
such a run-of-the-mill movie. Some of the supporting players are more
effective, simply because they seem to be have a lot more fun. Rhys Ifans,
as the Welsh kicker Nigel "The Leg" Gruff, is a delight. Jon Favreau as
SWAT-team-member-turned-blocker Daniel Bateman, who seems to share a few
branches of the family tree with Animal from "The Muppet Show", is
enjoyable as well.</P>
<P>But perhaps the most curious aspect of "The Replacements" is its treatment
of the whole strike scenario. If it had just been left in the background
as an excuse for a group of sadsack football players to wind up in a major
game, that would have been fine. But instead, the striking players are
presented as the movie's villains, particularly Eddie Martel (Brett 
Cullen), the Sentinels' regular quarterback. Cullen portrays him as
arrogant, seedy, and thoroughly obnoxious. No thought is ever given to
the players' side in the labor dispute. Right from the start they're
painted as lazy and greedy: a player gives up a possible touchdown in the
dying seconds of the last game before the strike, rather than risk injury.</P>
<P>Certainly, it seems absurd that people already making millions of dollars
should go on strike to protest their wages. But what must be borne in mind
is that the owners rake in significantly more money and -- most
importantly of all -- the fans are willing to pay inflated ticket prices
to watch the games. Player salaries have attained these exorbitant levels
not through some artifice on the part of their union, but essentially
because this is what the market has determined they can and should earn.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, "The Replacements" is so eager to have a group of 
characters that can be labelled as the bad guys that none of this is so
much as considered. And that is as good an indicator as any of the
complacency which grips this project. The result is a movie which is good
for an occasional laugh but, before long, will be mercifully forgotten.
Reeves and Hackman deserve better.</P>
