<PRE>                            KEEPING THE FAITH
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     It truly is the oldest joke in the book: "A priest and a rabbi walk
into a bar..."  Okay, so you've heard this one.  Well now you can watch
the movie of the joke!</P>
<P>     Keeping the Faith may not be quite that bad, but it's nothing to,
ahem, preach about.  Setting the film up with all the trappings of your
classic, neurotic, New York relationship comedy, Faith wants to be a wry
When Harry Met Sally tale of opposites attracting and love conquering
all.  Oh, the opposites aren't the rabbi Jake (Ben Stiller) and the
priest Brian (Ed Norton) -- that might actually be a movie worth
watching.  The kink in this picture is Jenna Elfman's Anna, the old
childhood friend of Jake of Brian, who swishes into town and promptly
falls in love with our rabbi.</P>
<P>     While Keeping the Faith has some genuinely funny moments, you've
probably seen them all in the trailer.  The rest of the jokes often
involve someone falling down or otherwise injuring themselves.  The
exception to this rule is Ken Leung's bit part as a crooning karaoke
machine salesman (don't ask), who steals the show from the rest of the
players.</P>
<P>     Not that it's tough: what a dismal job these guys do with their
parts!  After proving herself to be genuinely dippy in bombs like
Krippendorf's Tribe and EdTV, Jenna "Dharma" Elfman as a high-test
corporate consultant stretches the boundaries of reality to the breaking
point.  Stiller is all right but uninspired, and Ed Norton seems like he
has cotton in his mouth for half the film, he mumbles his lines so
badly.</P>
<P>     Normally I'd blame the director for something like this, only... Ed
Norton is the director.  And judging by this, his debut performance
behind the camera, I think it's safe to say the phrase, "And the Oscar
for Best Director goes to Edward Norton!" is something we shall never,
ever hear.</P>
<P>     Thanks to a sappy script that runs more than two hours (and this is
a comedy!) and features a stroke, an ostracized son, and a
near-excommunication, Keeping the Faith is a clear example of a huge
collection of bad choices being paraded on the screen, one after
another.  But the worst sin of the film is its interminable blathering,
with characters droning on and on with no point, so much so that I just
stopped paying attention altogether.</P>
<PRE>     Sounds like a sermon to me.</PRE>
