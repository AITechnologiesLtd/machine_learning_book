<P>Every week at WAFFLEMOVIES.COM, I review a different independent film or big
studio picture that deserves a second chance on video.  If you like the review
below, I hope you will visit WAFFLEMOVIES.COM.</P>
<PRE>In Country </PRE>
<P>It's very easy to forget why we celebrate Memorial Day. We get so wrapped up in
the barbecues, fun at the beach and excitement of having a day off from work
that the real meaning of the holiday is lost. That's why it's a good idea to
watch In Country starring Bruce Willis and Emily Lloyd. </P>
<P>Made in 1989, the movie addresses the war America wishes it could forget -
Vietnam. As someone who grew up in the eighties, I remember this period of soul
searching. The 80's brought a series of movies that addressed these forgotten
warriors, including Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, Full Metal Jacket,
Missing in Action and Rambo. Before the Persian Gulf War, America suffered from
a "Vietnam Syndrome" where every military action was feared because we didn't
want "another Vietnam". We face that today when debating the use of ground
troops in the Yugoslavian bombing campaign. </P>
<P>In Country stars Emily Lloyd as Sam, a young Kentucky high school graduate.
Like every new graduate, she is questioning where her life is going and faces a
number of very important decisions regarding her college education and a
marriage proposal she received from boyfriend, Lonnie. Sam also is questioning
her past. </P>
<P>Her father died in Vietnam before she was born. Her mother (Joan Allen) has
left behind all memories of her life with Sam's father, remarried, had another
child and moved away to Lexington. She even leaves Sam behind. However, Sam has
always wondered what her father was like, why he died and what he died for. </P>
<P>One day, she finds a series of letters written by her father when he was in
Vietnam; what veterans refer to as "in country". She reads these letters in an
attempt to learn about the father she never met. She also wants to learn about
her Uncle Emmett. </P>
<P>Emmett, played by Bruce Willis, is a Vietnam veteran haunted by his
experiences. He still has flashbacks of different battles and suffers from
other unspecified physical ailments that he refuses to see a doctor about. Like
his group of Vietnam veteran buddies, he resents never being honored for
service to his country like veterans in wars before them. He lives a simple
life trying to deal with his pain. Sam persistently attempts to force him to
explain what happened in Vietnam, but he refuses because it brings up too many
memories that she could never understand. </P>
<P>Sam's quest becomes complicated when she is given a series of diaries written
by her father. She is suddenly faced with the truth about Vietnam. Like
millions of Americans, can she face that truth and still respect her father,
Uncle Emmett and his buddies? </P>
<P>See In Country for two reasons. First, you need to be reminded that Bruce
Willis can act. While most of us remember him for his TV sensation Moonlighting
and the Die Hard movies (and want to forget him for dreadful fare like Hudson
Hawk), he is a talented actor. Willis has always done a fantastic job of
balancing big blockbusters with smaller fare like In Country and future
WaffleMovies.com selection Nobody's Fool. It is refreshing to see the bluster
Willis shows as a leading man disappear when he takes smaller challenging roles
such as this. Someday, a role like this could lead to more recognition of his
immense acting ability. </P>
<P>In this movie, Willis deftly portrays a man slightly on the edge, but sane
enough to realize that he is troubled. He shows the frustration his character
feels with his mental anguish and the sorrow he feels because he came back when
many of his friends did not. </P>
<P>The second reason to rent In Country is the powerful closing scene at the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. You must remember that the
memorial was in its infancy when this movie was made and many were only
starting to learn about it. Willis steals the show as Emmett finds the names of
his fallen comrades and finally faces his experiences in Vietnam. </P>
<P>In Country is a short history in America's reaction to Vietnam and the veterans
of that war. All of the Vietnam veteran characters portray the attitude that
many held when they came back from Vietnam; no one cares what happened to us,
how we feel or what we faced. They feel abandoned. On the other hand, Joan
Allen's character portrays the attitude held by Americans who didn't go to war;
let's forget the past and move on. All of these beliefs are challenged by Sam
just like they were challenged by the film-makers of the eighties and many
people my age who always heard about Vietnam, but wanted to know what it was
all about. </P>
<P>The movie does have some drawbacks. While other reviewers believe Lloyd was
fantastic, I find her annoying. Her character is played too naïve even for
1989. Another drawback is the use of "I'm on Fire", a brilliant song by Bruce
Springsteen. While I am a huge Springsteen fan, the song is not well utilized
in this movie. It is thrown in gratuitously when it should be used to shine new
light on a situation or provide a better understanding of the action taking
place on screen or in our character's mind. </P>
<P>Overall, In Country is a good movie. Director Norman Jewison puts together a
wonderful opening sequence as well as a powerful closing. If you are a fan of
Bruce Willis or want a better understanding of the pain felt by Vietnam
veterans, rent it tonight. </P>
