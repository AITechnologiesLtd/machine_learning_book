BIG, BAD 'GODZILLA'</PRE>
<P>a review by Jeff ("spoilers") Pidgeon</P>
<P>        If you've never seen "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", "Jaws",
"Jurassic Park", "Aliens" or "The Professional", you might be find the latest
remake of "Godzilla" tolerable.  For me, Roland ("ID4") Emmerich and Dean Dev-
lin's latest super-production was yet another patchwork quilt of lifted shots
and scenes from several other films.  One might expect a certain amount of
old familiar feelings -- this is after all, a remake; but it's mostly that 
and only that; a huge bundle of predictable moments delivered with plenty of
carnage but not much excitement.
        It starts out promisingly -- creepy titles of video nuclear testing
footage all shot in a nasty toxic yellow color over David Arnold's ominous
score (the credits grow as we watch them) -- but almost from the moment the 
film gets underway (with an attack on a Japanese fishing trawler), everything
feels trumped-up and cloned, as if the sole motivation for the film was to
out-do every other film in existence: "Oh, so the shark in 'Jaws' attacks a
little boat?" "Well, we'll have Godzilla attack a BIG boat!" "The shark drags
one boat around?" "We'll have our beastie drag THREE!!" "Terrific!!"  A couple
of these Spielberg-esque attacks, and we're on our way.  Using this "Close 
Encounters" technique of hiding The Big Surprise from view for the first
half hour or so works well when you're not really sure what you're going to
get at the end (i.e. little ships and -- whoa! -- the mothership!), but here,
since we do know, it mostly builds impatience to see The Monster in The City.
        Like "ID4", "Godzilla" has a number of plots running at once: Nick
Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) tries to save New York from getting completely
squashed while seeing if he really is still estranged from his one-time
-fiancee/aspiring reporter Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo, who plays one of 
those characters that you frequently pray will get stepped on or eaten). 
Audrey is trying to decide between Love and Her Career, having stolen a video-
tape of Godzilla's exposition and leaked it to the press.  Animal (Hank Azar-
ia) and Lucy (Arabella Field) seem to exist to round out a "Twister"-esque
band of characters with cartoonish Noo Yawk accents thrown in for flavor.
Philippe Roche (Jean Reno) plays a sinister member of the French secret ser-
vice who at first works against, then alongside our main characters to defeat
the creature.  Apparently, French atomic tests were responsible for the darn 
thing, and they want to cover it up.  Good luck convincing everybody that 
those crushed buildings were just swamp gas, guys!  New York mayor Roger Ebert
(Michael Lerner) -- yes, he has a balding assistant named Gene and they fight
all the time -- butts heads with the the Main Army Guy (Kevin Dunn) and with
Nick over whether or not Godzilla is actually Goddess-zilla, or Godzillette;
are eggs being laid somewhere on Manhattan?  Of course!
        We're even nudged to empathize -- her rampage is actually just Mommy
trying to raise her vicious, blood-thirsty little chicks in peace.  Aww!
Sorry folks, I thought they should have soaked that whole "Lost World" island
in nerve gas.  I mean, these aren't spotted owls we're talking about here --
these are HUGE, CARNIVOROUS MONSTERS THAT BREATHE RADIOACTIVE FIRE!  Kong and
Frankenstein clearly weren't violent unless provoked, and they were certainly
happy left in their own territory.  They didn't go building nests in Madison
Square Garden!  Sorry!  No sympathy!
        This is spectacle on such a grand scale that the quality is stretched
pretty thin.  Most of the technical work in the film remains firmly in the 
middle ground -- not pie-plate awful, nor ground-breaking innovation.  Most
of "Godzilla"'s effect's work feels at best uninspired and at worst rushed to
completion.  Much like "Lost In Space", the overall effect that the filmmakers
seem to be reaching for is a benumbed awe rather than any sort of suspenseful
rhythm or build.
        To be fair, a couple of the effects sequences are built on entertain-
ing ideas -- Godzillette isn't invulnerable in this film, she's just really
fast -- fast enough to evade surface-to-air missiles and underwater torpedoes
(Whether you want to buy this is another thing, but it makes for a nice vari-
ation, as opposed to the our-weapons-don't-seem-to-hurt-it stuff).  I liked 
the way the fire-breathing was suggested rather than blatant, and the cab 
chase in Manhattan (culminating on the Brooklyn Bridge) caught my eye as de-
cent spectacle.  Vicki Lewis plays a cute scientist that I was hoping to see
more of, but was squashed beneath the wheels of the central romance. 
        Most of these moments, though, are glints on a two-hour-plus stretch
of asphalt.  The film's sense of humor falls flat the vast majority of the 
time, and its attempts to connect you with its characters induce wincing.  
Most of my friends who are Godzilla fans say that it isn't a Godzilla movie.
Others say it's more of a remake of "The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms" than "God-
zilla".  Not being all that familiar with those films, I can't say.  But 
there's a lot of books I would recommend you start reading with those two 
hours that you'll save by not seeing "Godzilla".  Not Recommended.</P>
