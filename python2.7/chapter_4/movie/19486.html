<PRE>                            RUN, LOLA, RUN
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a very high-energy German
          film using some experimental cinematic techniques.
          The film tells three alternate timelines for a
          woman who has twenty minutes to get 100,000
          Deutsche Marks.  Lola makes different decisions and
          different coincidences occur so the event has three
          very different outcomes.  The film sometimes is
          contrived and does not play fair with the viewer,
          but for a low-budget film, this is worth seeing.
          Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It has been suggested that history is a random walk affected by
uncountably many tiny events, most too small to even notice.  Chaos
theory suggests that tiny changes lead to immense differences later in
time.  RUN, LOLA, RUN is a very clever low-budget film from Germany in
which explores this idea.  We see Lola (played by Franka Potente with
day-glow red hair) live the same twenty or so minutes of crisis in
three different ways (though each involves running a great deal).  And
we see how the outcome is different because of those choices.</P>
<P>     Lola has lived with her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) for
about a year when the crisis takes place.  Manni has a job acting as
courier in a drug deal.  In a moment of confusion Manni leaves a bag
with 100,000 Deutsche Marks (roughly $50,000) on a subway.  In a few
minutes Manni will have to face his bosses.  If he is without the
money, he will probably be killed for his mistake.  Rather than do
that, Manni decides he will probably take his chances robbing a
grocery. In a moment of panic he calls Lola and tells her what he is
going to do in just twenty minutes.  If Lola can get to him in twenty
minutes with 100,000 Marks, he will abort his planned robbery.  What
does Lola do?  In three different futures she handles the situation in
three somewhat different ways and things turn out differently because
of her efforts.</P>
<P>     In the opening this film, written and directed by Tom Tykwer,
talks about universal questions and suggests that this film will be
driving at some answers. However any conclusions that RUN, LOLA, RUN
draws are really suspect.  The individual stories are contrived in many
ways.  Some coincidences are acceptable, but there are too many to make
these three futures believable.  In a cinematic version of snapshots we
see the future for some of the tangential characters and it seems very
different based on how Lola runs past the person. No mechanism for what
is causing the differences is shown.  In addition, Lola has some
strange power that can only be called a "magical shriek" that has
powers never explained.  It makes the film a fantasy, in spite of
otherwise realistic treatment of the alternate worlds.  So in some
senses this film is not as good as SLIDING DOORS, another film, far
from perfect, on a very similar theme.  And another problem is that the
timing seems inconsistent between segments.  If the first story took
twenty minutes, they other two should have taken considerably longer.
But even more serious is the fact we do not really get to know the main
characters very well.  Nobody's character is particularly well
developed or made more comprehensible in the course of the film.</P>
<P>     On the other hand, this film effortlessly shifts gears among film,
video, and animation.  The use of the different media probably allowed
for some budget savings in what is clearly a low-budget film.  The only
time that the budget becomes an obvious problem is when the subtitles
in the United States version are white on a white background making
them impossible to read.  The pace of even the opening credits are
enough to leave the viewer panting.  It seems to be an amalgam of many
different cinematic styles, and the film makes that work.  We learn a
great deal about some of the characters by seeing them in the same
situation but handling it three different ways.</P>
<P>     RUN, LOLA, RUN is an unexpectedly provocative film that will be
remembered as a curious novelty, if for no other reason.  I rate it a6
on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
