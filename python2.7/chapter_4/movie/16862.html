<PRE>               A REVIEW OF "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL"
                       by Ryan Ellis</PRE>
<P>give me a buzz on the ol' e-lines, <A HREF="mailto:iluvmick@hotmail.com">iluvmick@hotmail.com</A></P>
<P>As Charlie Chaplin's classic "City Lights" told us, smile
though your heart is breaking, smile even though it's aching. And
if you can entertain your kid while you're at it, all the better.
Roberto Benigni's Italian film of a man's love for his family is
up for some of the high-profile Academy Awards (Best Picture,
Best Director, Best Actor, etc.), but it's just a notch below the
competition. The brilliance and star-power of both "Saving
Private Ryan" and "Shakespeare In Love" will probably relegate
"Life Is Beautiful" to winning lesser, yet still significant,
awards (Best Foreign Language Film, for example.)</P>
<P>As writer, director, and charismatic star of this Italian
comedy/drama, Benigni has created a remarkable character who
never loses sight of what's important to him. He's also written a
multi-dimensional script that takes us on an unexpected journey
through war-torn Europe during World War II. The first half of
the film is almost entirely comedy as Guido Orefice (Benigni)
meets his dream woman, Dora (Nicoletta Brashci), and keeps
running into her on purpose. Also working as a waiter, the
aspiring bookshop owner makes plenty of friends with his wit and
plenty of enemies with his irreverance.</P>
<P>The second half of the film takes a mild turn toward drama,
but, as I said, it doesn't lose its way. Guido and Dora
consummate their love and flash-forward to a few years later when
young Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini) is born. After years of marital
happiness, Dora returns home one day to find that Guido, his
uncle (Giustino Durano), and Giosue have been captured and
imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp. She asks the Nazis to
take her, too. Although the family can't be together (she's kept
in a separate women's camp), they don't lose hope that they'll be
together again.</P>
<P>The boy doesn't understand why they've been thrown into such
a place, so to keep him from panicking or even being gassed to
death (as children were in the camps), Guido makes it into a
game. He tells Giosue that they will be given a real tank if they
win the game. He makes up rules that will keep the kid safe if he
follows them. His antics are funny and the adorable boy falls for
it, thinking he and his father will win first prize if they
accumulate 1000 points. Ah, ignorance is bliss. If only everyone
who'd been placed in those horrible concentration camps could
have kept such a hopeful heart...</P>
<P>Man, it's hard to write about the holocaust. Such a hateful
display of politics and inhumanity is awful to imagine and
difficult to write about even in 1999. However, Benigni doesn't
allow his audience to brood over the horrors of WWII too long. He
keeps our spirits up when he entertains his son. I can't remember
smiling and feeling so terrible simultaneously in quite this way
before. I was both the boy AND his father during the final hour
of the film. I was scared for their lives and giggling at the
whoppers he would tell his son to keep him from knowing the
hideous truth. If all parents lied to their kids for such good,
loving reasons, maybe the global crime rates wouldn't be so
brutally high. Yes, I'm preaching, but parents can learn
something from this film about raising their kids under the worst
possible strain. So the Jeep stalls on the way to violin lessons,
tough noogies! It's easier than dragging anvils around all day
and then struggling to convince your son that the worst thing
that could happen is they won't win this supposed game. Sorry, no
more preaching...</P>
<P>Benigni is a naturally gifted artist. He occasionally evokes
the immortal Charlie Chaplin, which may be high praise, but it's
worthy praise. As director, he uses his supporting cast extremely
well, allowing many of their paths to cross in poignant or
humourous ways. As lead actor, he is excellent, but will be
hard-pressed to pry the Oscar away from Ian McKellan or Nick
Nolte. Still, his character is as well-developed as those and
he's more likable.</P>
<P>The film's conclusion is not spectacular or unexpected, but
it's quite emotional all the same. These characters are simple
and real and we fall in love with them. The film builds up and
becomes more enthralling as time ticks by. It's not quite
perfect, but "Life is Beautiful" is a unique piece of
story-telling. Once they draw you in, not even having to read
subtitles seems to be a chore. After all, if Guido can smile
though his heart is breaking, so can we.</P>
<P>USELESS TRIVIA--I'd like to have some, but I have no useless
trivia for this heart-felt movie.</P>
<PRE>This film gets a 9/10.</PRE>
