<P>I might as well go out and say it: I like Kevin Costner as an actor.
Some may argue he has little range, but that only assists in adding an
everyman appeal to the endearing actor. After taking such a lashing for
his post-apocalyptic bomb The Postman, Costner has returned to a subject
that has brought him much success: the American past-time of baseball.
For Love of the Game proves that, with Kevin Costner and baseball, you
really can't go wrong.</P>
<P>Joining an actor who is very experienced in this category is a director
who is not. Sam Raimi, best known for his gore-splattered Evil Dead
series, has made an amazing transition within the past few years. A
Simple Plan, his chilling tale of small-town crime, was widely hailed as
one of 1998's best films. And now Raimi (a fan of baseball himself) has
taken the reins of a project that is a total contrast to his 80's horror
films. It looks like the dedicated director may have success in any
genre (with exception of western, which he attempted in the ill-fated
The Quick and the Dead).</P>
<P>Costner plays aging Tigers' pitcher Billy Chapel, who is told by the
owner (Brian Cox) that the franchise has been sold. Pondering
retirement, Chapel steps out on the field at Yankee Stadium to pitch
what could be his final game. The spectators in New York greet the
pitcher with disgust (`Chapel, you suck!!!' and `You couldn't pitch a
tent!'), but he uses his concentration to block everything out. Chapel
begins to look back at his long and successful career, which also
revives memories of romance and family - mainly involving Kate (Kelly
Preston) and their relationship ups and downs through the years.</P>
<P>A friend of mine commented that he would have liked less Love and more
Game from the film, and I would have to agree. The baseball action is
used sparingly, but it captures the spirit and excitement of the great
game. The romance between Billy and Kate contains a few fundamental
flaws, but the stars have palpable chemistry and play their boundaries
perfectly. This is easily Costner's best performance in years. The
actor's undeniable appeal allows us to look past the lack of information
about Chapel's past. We see (unnecessary) flashbacks of his parents, but
know little about them. There is also great work from Preston, Jena
Malone, and John C. Reilly as a loyal catcher named Gus Sinski.</P>
<P>Raimi adds a swift momentum to any given situation. For Love of the Game
is solidly entertaining from beginning to end, which causes a refreshing
absence of flashing Indiglo watches during the show. The director
supports the material so well, perhaps with the one exception: a rushed
ending that denies the audience room to breath. The script Raimi has to
deal with is dependable but problematic. All the flaws seemed to be
drowned out by the consistent, reliable pace, which links romantic
flashbacks to the present game with seamless precision.</P>
<P>For Love of the Game also has wide appeal. Anyone who enjoys baseball
will be glued to their seats. I was a little disgusted to see a few
sports clichés - such as a couple of close calls involving hits that
just tail off into foul territory. But when Chapel begins to work on a
perfect game, Raimi handles the tension and unease perfectly. Romantic
film buffs will also love it, as will any Costner fan that still exists
(I hope there are still a few). Needless to say, this film is sure to be
a widespread crowd-pleaser for all ages.</P>
<P>I still prefer Field of Dreams, a wonderful fantasy that honors baseball
like a religion, to Costner's latest entry. But For Love of the Game is
an actual, genuine `good movie' from the Hollywood factory. I thoroughly
enjoyed it's loving tribute to a great game, and anyone with similar
feelings is sure to agree.</P>
