<PRE>DR. SEUSS'S HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS     * * *</PRE>
<P>Director: Ron Howard
Writers: Jeffrey Price, Peter S. Seaman
Cast: Jim Carrey, Jeffrey Tambor, Taylor Momsen, Christine Baranski
Rated PG, 102 minutes</P>
<P>Though the vicious halls of elementary school are known as breeding grounds 
for cruel treatment, no teasing was as mean or strangely inane as what our 
green fiend experienced in his childhood. It turns out the reason the boy got 
so fed up with Christmas in the first place was because he lacked shaving 
skills. Darn those razor blades! Oh yes, you heard me correctly. The young 
Grinch (Jim Carrey) once attended school with sweetheart Martha May Who-vier 
(Christine Baranski) and future major of Whoville (Jeffrey Tambor). The 
little major thinks Martha's his girl, and convinces his classmates the 
Grinch is hairy, ugly, and stupid, but Martha May's turned off by his mean 
ways. The Grinch tries his hand at a razor blade to remove the unwanted hair, 
and appeal to Martha. He gets cuts all over his face, and is subjected to 
public mockery the next day, so he furiously flees town to a nearby mountain 
and disappears forever. He still induces fear in the townspeople. </P>
<P>Why take such a long time to explain this small plot detail? Because it's 
filler, and that's exactly what most of this movie is. Except for a few 
inspired new moments, this holiday family film really doesn't deserve the 
title of "Dr. Seuss's The Grinch", "Dr. Seuss's The Grinch...Sort Of" is more 
accurate.</P>
<P>Years after the shearing incident, the town of Whoville is preparing for the 
Whobilation, a grand town anniversary coinciding with Christmas. The Major 
keeps citizens in order, hoping the Grinch won-t swarm down from his alp lair 
to foil activities. He does his share to encourage anti-Grinch propaganda, 
but is the emerald guy really so bad? One child, Little Cindy Lou-Who (Taylor 
Momsen) wants to find out. Confused by the true meaning of Christmas, she 
seeks for good in the Grinch's two-sizes-too-small heart. What she finds will 
only surprise you if you've watched no television around Christmas since 1966 
or read no books as a child.</P>
<P>But that's treating the movie too seriously and cynically. If one looks past 
extra patches of story, the result is quite magical. Production values are 
high and simply gorgeous with lush detail throughout the crazy world of 
Whoville. Every building has some kooky feature, and all characters a strange 
characteristic. You know it's a showy, flimsy film set, but it convinces as a 
city. In this year's Best Makeup Oscar category, makeup artist Rick Baker 
looks to be competing against himself. Whether his work in "Nutty Professor 
II: The Klumps", or the masterful job he does here will win is unsure. 
Regardless, he makes the movie much better than it could have been. Carrey 
contorts inside his extremely painful suit of lime-dyed yak hair and numerous 
face pieces with charming vigor. It makes for the year's most unique 
performance. He finds a suiting role better than his dual job in "Me, Myself 
& Irene". With no big contenders this year, "The Grinch" could finally mean 
an Oscar nomination for its star. The Whos look awesome too. They have long 
animal snouts, and each 90 some Who has completely different facial features. 
Watching a special on E! (I'm not quite above watching that network), and 
seeing every step taken to get the movie to feel and appear just right, it's 
downright amazing what they did. </P>
<P>Jim Carrey sings the original Grinch song with panache and no voice 
alteration other than the mouthpiece he already wears for the role. Among 
other treats include the Grinch doing a dead-on imitation of a director 
(presumably Ron Howard). Anthony Hopkins's key speaking role as the narrator 
gets handled with care and grace, an excellent choice.</P>
<P>Yet there's that extra story. It sticks out like a jagged icicle waiting for 
Sharon Stone's ice pick. Seuss's wife, who gave Howard rights for the film 
after waiting out for near eternity, had some control over the film. She 
demanded certain bathroom humor scenes be removed, a thankful thing. She 
apparently, however, had no power over the overall story. And what happens? 
The message gets muddled. </P>
<P>Watch the original 1966 television program before seeing the film to remind 
yourself as to the intention of its brilliant late author. After that, see 
the film. Despite its flaws, this is something you must see.</P>
<P>Early in the film Little Cindy's mother Betty Lou Who (Molly Shannon) is 
competing with Martha May in a Christmas light contest. Stringing bright 
lights as fast as possible with severe difficulty, Betty stops for a moment 
to talk with Martha about her fairly unadorned home display. Martha shows her 
a large Christmas light machine gun that shoots and staples illuminators to 
her house with stylish ease. Betty looks on, horrified. It's a classic moment 
in a film that could have been so.   </P>
