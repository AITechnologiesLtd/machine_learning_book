<PRE>                        THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is an old-fashioned murder
          story.  There is little real violence, no chases;
          it is just one very ingenious, very unscrupulous
          person trying to get away with what he can.  But
          the show is really how he does it and the suspense
          of wondering how long he can keep it up.  This is a
          fairly intelligent thriller with a villain that one
          almost has to admire.  The warm 1950s Southern
          Italy setting works for the film also.  Though he
          occasionally stretches credulity, this is a fun
          film to go along with.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), low +2
          (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     For me one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films is DIAL M FOR MURDER.
It is a stage play barely adapted for film, but it is a very good stage
play.  We have in it a murderer who is a formidable force.  His talent
is not that he strong or fast.  He does not come popping out at
anybody.  He does not outrun anyone.  His skill is that he thinks very
well on his feet.  You can actually just see him thinking out
possibilities and almost unerringly find the right one.  Once he makes
a decision he stays with it.  He never seems troubled by uncertainty.
THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is about a very similar sort of criminal
genius.  Quite a bit younger, but no less mentally agile is Tom Ripley
(played by Matt Damon).</P>
<P>     It is 1958.  Tom Ripley is, to use his words, "a real nobody," a
bathroom attendant and sometime piano player.  But he is good a mimicry
and at forging signatures.  He decides that it is better to be a fake
somebody than a real nobody.  When he comes in contact with the
Greenleaf family, wealthy from shipping, he passes himself off as a
friend from Princeton of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), currently in
Italy.  He is treated like one of the family for a while, and Dickie's
father Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) has a proposition for Tom.  He
will pay Tom $1000 to go to Italy and convince Dickie to give up his
playboy ways and return home.  Tom goes, meeting Meredith Logue (Cate
Blanchett) along the way.  In Italy Tom arranges a meeting and
befriends Dickie and his fiance Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow).  All
the while he is putting together plans to kill Dickie and, where
necessary for his plan, take his place.  Director Anthony Minghella's
screenplay begins with this setup and brings the characters together
and then lets them simmer together in the warm Italian sun for nearly
an hour, choosing the leisurely pace of a good Agatha Christie film.
The tempo is slow and thrills are cerebral, but we do get to meet and
understand the characters and it pays off in the second half of the
film.  We see that in more than one sense that Ripley is expert in
playing people.  His one failure is to fool the unctuous Freddie Miles
(Philip Seymour Hoffman), an old friend of Dickie.  Freddie takes an
immediate dislike to Tom, complicating the plan.  Eventually there is a
murder and Ripley has to be both himself and Dickie Greenleaf for a
while.  He is walking a tightrope and must remember with each person
what version of reality he is trying to project.  And as the film
progresses his step must become ever more careful.</P>
<P>     The roles must have seemed like a little bit of dj vu for the two
male leads.  Damon played the genius of lower class origins in GOOD
WILL HUNTING.  Jude Law played the aristocrat whose very identity is
borrowed by someone else in GATTACA.  In any case Law seems very much
at home in his roll as the young jazz-loving jet setter.  Damon seems
sufficiently controlled.  Paltrow is regal.  Special mention should be
made of one of the bit parts.</P>
<P>     One of the ever more familiar faces showing up in films is Philip
Baker Hall who in here has a small but important roll as an American
lawyer.  Hall, in his late 60s, is able to project an absolute
authenticity of authority and at the same time a magnetism of a person
in a position of power.  Anyone who has seen the film HARD EIGHT was
mesmerized by his performance from the very first scene.  He has been
in films since the early 1970s, but probably because of his performance
in HARD EIGHT he is showing up in a lot of major films.</P>
<P>     The plot of THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY does not take a whole lot of
thought before contrivances become apparent.  But under the influence
of the warm Italian sun, the audience is lulled into going along with
it and even being thrilled as Ripley gets himself into and out of minor
scrapes in his amoral attempts to steal a life.  I give the film a 6 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
