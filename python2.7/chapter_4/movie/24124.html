<PRE>SEX: THE ANNABEL CHONG STORY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>"I believe that sex is good enough to die for," Annabel Chong says,
talking about why she was willing to set the (short-lived) world record
for a gang-bang by having sex with 251 men in 10 hours.  Like the rest
of Gough Lewis's sensationalized but shallow documentary, SEX: THE
ANNABEL CHONG STORY, her brave boast doesn't hold up under examination.
The men either wore condoms or were HIV-tested porn stars, and Annabel
is just an exhibitionist who doesn't care much about anything other that
getting attention.</P>
<P>The documentary, however, tries with little success to paint a
completely different portrait of Annabel -- that of a modern-day
feminist.  Annabel, the film suggests, is in the porn industry for a
variety of reasons from the oppression of having to grow up in strict,
Christian Singapore to her rape in London.  Like much of the story, the
devil is in the details.  Her rape in London, for example, starts, she
tells us, with her enjoying consensual sex with a stranger in a filthy,
trash disposal area.  She says how excited she was when he brought in
his friend.  After others came along, it got out of hand and was
frightening for her, so she paints herself as a victim.  She doesn't own
up to causing some of her own difficulties.</P>
<P>Unlike the thoughtful and insightful THE GIRL NEXT DOOR about porn star
Stacy Valentine, this documentary is built with one cheap shot after
another.  It even opens with the king of schlock, Jerry Springer.  He
asks Annabel why she did her famous sex extravaganza, and she gives that
classic non-answer of "well, why not?"  The movie is filled with such
bad questions followed by even worse non-responses.  "What sort of
artistic statement were you making?" one fawning TV talk show host asks
Annabel.</P>
<P>Perhaps my least favorite throw-away question is the one that the
director asks Grace's mother.  (Grace is Annabel's real name.)   He
wants to know if Grace has always been an overachiever.  Guess, what?
The mother says, "yes."</P>
<P>There are many good questions that could have been asked.  One was how
Grace, a woman with a horrible set of teeth, a modest body, no acting
acumen and little to recommend her, ever made it in the porn business in
the first place.  Another might be, what was it that attracted men
enough to have them rent her tapes before the marathon sex session which
brought her notoriety.  This crude movie is more concerned with a quick
buck, so such informative questions are avoided.</P>
<P>The movie, which drones on and on, with one talking head after another,
feels like it will never end.  The movie concludes in a long and boring
segment set mainly at Grace's home in Hong Kong, where she cries as she
tells her mother that she'll make her proud again.  (Annabel's lack of
credible acting ability really shows through in these scenes.)  One
wonders if the director is trying to make the audience feel Annabel's
exhaustion during her sexual Olympics, as he drags out his movie way
past it's natural ending point.</P>
<P>A little mirth in such a dull movie would have helped.  It does,
however, contain one extremely funny bit of self-deprecating humor.  The
male porn star of a movie called "The Oral Majority," talks about
Annabel's sexual stunt.  "It's just giving porn a bad name," he
complains.</P>
<P>SEX: THE ANNABEL CHONG STORY runs a very long 1:26.  It is not rated but
would be NC-17 for strong sex scenes and language.  The film would not
be acceptable for those under 19.</P>
