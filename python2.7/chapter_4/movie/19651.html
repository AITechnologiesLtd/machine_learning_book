<P>Inglewood, California, known to many of its inhabitants as "the wood",
is a small, middle-class urban community populated mostly by
African-Americans. Minutes away from the airport and (former) home of
the Los Angeles Lakers, the Wood represents L.A. like few places
can. Inglewood is also the setting for Rick Famuyima's wonderful debut
film, "The Wood". "The Wood" is the tale of three young men, Mike,
Roland and Slim, who reminisce about growing up in Inglewood, on the
day of Roland's wedding. The narrator is Mike(Omar Epps as an adult,
Sean Nelson as a teenager), a self-described peacemaker who moved to
the Wood when he was in the eighth grade. On his first day of school,
he meets Roland(Taye Diggs as an adult, Trent Cameron as a teenager)
and Slim(NFL wide-receiver Richard T. Jones as an adult, Duane Finley
as a teenager), and they instantly become friends when the naive Mike
accepts a bet in which he has to grab the "booty" of fellow classmate
Alicia(Malinda Williams), whom Mike has a crush on.</P>
<P>Alicia turns out to be quite a strong girl, and as well as punching
him, she gets her older brother, Stacey(De'aundre Bonds), a gang
member, to beat Mike up after school.  However, for the remainder of
the year, she takes a liking to him, and Mike reconciles with her
brother in an unconventional way. The relationship between Mike and
Alicia builds up through high school, as things become more serious.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, back in the present day, Roland is unable to be found and
it is up to Mike and Slim to locate him so that the wedding can
happen. They end up finding him at the house of an old flame(Tamala
Jones), drunk and wasted on the couch. The three once again think back
to when times were different, and they feel hidden sadness for the
friend that they are about to "lose".  However, the real coming-of-age
occurs as the Mike and Slim watch their friend take the first steps
towards a more stable life; steps that even he is having second
thoughts about.</P>
<P>Writer/director Rick Famuyima is telling the true story of his own
adolescence in the Wood, and it is another story of African-Americans
growing up in "the hood", but it doesn't involve racism or gang
warfare. USC-grad Famuyima, unlike other urban black talents such as
Spike Lee and John Singleton, chooses to give his characters a human
portrayal without resorting to violence. Rick Famuyima is a filmmaker
with a positive message.</P>
<P>The flashback scenes are usually more effective than the real-time
scenes, despite the latter's fine cast of actors. Sean Nelson gives an
excellent performance as young Mike, going through an "American
Pie"-like coming-of-age. Taye Diggs and Richard T. Jones also take a
backseat while Omar Epps shows a lighter side, unlike his character in
"The Mod Squad".</P>
<P>"The Wood" is the first MTV Film that I can actually recommend
(although "Election" was downright ambitious), helped in a large part
by its funky soundtrack. The film hasn't amounted to much at the box
office in this crowded summer, but hopefully it will find its niche
beyond its target audience. Rick Famuyima is someone to watch.</P>
