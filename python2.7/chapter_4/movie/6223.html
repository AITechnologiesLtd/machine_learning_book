                      Trees Lounge (1996)
                 A film review by David Cowen
                  Copyright 1996 David Cowen</PRE>
<P>Tommy (Steve Buscemi) lives directly over the Trees Lounge, a local
bar like any other local bar.  He shares the counter with Bill
(Bronson Dudley), an old timer who keeps a pile of bills on the
bar to keep the drinks coming.  When he's not drinking, he's 
stalking Rob (Anthony LaPaglia) who stole Tommy's girlfriend 
Theresa (Elizabeth Bracco) after Tommy stole 1500 dollars of his
money.  Tommy's a mechanic with a car that doesn't run, so his job 
prospects are pretty slim.  Ultimately, he gets a job working as 
a Good Humor man after his Uncle Al (Seymour Cassel) who used to
drive the truck dies.  As he runs his route, Theresa's 17 year old
niece Debbie (Chloe Sevigny) hops on board to smoke and run the 
route with him, and as they grow closer, Tommy's life starts falling
apart.</P>
<P>The scenes between Tommy and Chloe have a genuine chemistry: a 
mascara-drenched Sevigny plays her lolita-esque part just right,
Buscemi's Tommy can be genuinely funny in a resigned and awkward 
way, and the scenes between those two are by far the best in the film.
Unfortunately, the film jumps from focusing on Tommy to the 
relationships between Rob and Theresa, Theresa's sister and her 
husband, and a relationship between bar regular Mike and his wife 
Marie.  These scenes are handled with all the wit and care of a 
sitcom, and the acting and writing in these scenes are sub-par at 
best.  The  movie only seems interesting or even genuine when 
Tommy and Chloe are on the screen, and that's just a quarter of 
the film.  </P>
<P>Strangely, the final shot of the film is one of the best I've 
seen -- a slow motion shot of Buscemi's face slowly and subtly 
contorting into expressions of confusion, derision and contempt -- 
a shot which unfortunately belies the nature of the rest of the
film.  TREES LOUNGE doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be
bleak or a comedy.  Most of the time it's a rather conventional and
uninteresting comedy.  Buscemi's film would have been much better off 
should he had settled on bleak.</P>
