<P>Religion and gambling make strange bedfellows. A rare subject for
literature,too, as in the book that, in 1988, won England's paramount
prize, the Booker, and became the source novel for the film "Oscar and
Lucinda." Yet, the most famous gamble in history is Blaise Pascal's wager.
The 17th century French writer,philosopher, mathematician, physicist bet on
the existence of God, in what is probably the biggest win-win gamble ever.
If God exists, you win. If He does not, you've lost nothing.</P>
<P>This bet is essentially reiterated in "Oscar and Lucinda," though Pascal is
not mentioned or credited. The bettor is Oscar, an Anglican minister whose
story is told in flasback by his great-grandson.</P>
<P>Oscar, born in Victorian England,was a country boy from Devon, who lost his
mother early. His father was a fundamentalist Christian, the leader of the
local Plymouth Brethren. He saw other sects --including the Anglicans --as
heretics, and even punished his son for tasting Christmas pudding, that
work of the Devil.</P>
<P>His fanaticism drove Oscar into the household of an Anglican preacher, then
to Oxford where he studied for the Ministry. An impecunious loner, Oscar
became friends with a schoolmate who introduced him to betting on horses.
The bug bit him with the strength of an Ebola virus. Rather than become
that standard type of fiction, the addicted gambler who loses all, Oscar
became a steady winner.He paid his debts, saved a pittance for his modest
needs and placed his winnings in poor-boxes.</P>
<P>After ordination,to avoid the temptation of gambling while serving God, he
decided to become a missionary in backwoods Australia. He made the long
sea-voyage even though he had aquaphobia, an intense fear of water. I was
amused by someone calling it "hydrophobia," which evokes rabid dogs, bared
fangs and awful drool, whereas poor Oscar is the soul of gentleness!</P>
<P>Lucinda was Australian, a girl with a will. She grew up in the country, had
a fascination for glass, was totally orphaned and inherited a nice fortune.
In Sydney she bought a glassworks and became that extreme rarity for her
day, a female entrepreneur. In her private life, Lucinda was also an
intense gambler who favored cards, played in the homes of known gamblers or
in Chinese dens, wore (how shocking!) bloomers. She shared her love of
glass with the Reverend Hasset. They became friends.All this made Lucinda
more than suspect in the eyes of the public and the clergy.</P>
<P>When Lucinda had gone to England for modern equipment, and was returning to
Australia, she and Oscar met on the ship, recognized their passion for
gambling and became friends.
Their relationship was not carnal, not even overtly amorous, although one
suspects that it was an "amitie amoureuse," -- stronger in Oscar's case.
But he won't say a word since he believes that love exists between Lucinda
and Hasset.</P>
<P>Now, Hasset, whose friendship with Lucinda has raised eyebrows among the
clergy, has been exiled, appointed to a nothing place far within the
outback. Oscar, in a strange move that allies glass and faith, has
Lucinda's works construct a glass church which will be taken to the faraway
boondocks to the Reverend Hasset.</P>
<P>"O & E" is an original tale, to say the least. The paperback edition of the
book is 448 pages. The film is 131 minutes. There is no way that the novel
could be transposed without huge cuts. As a result the movie is fascinating
yet puzzling; fresh yet frustrating; complex but meandering.</P>
<P>At its most basic, a motion picture is an assembly of scenes that contain
images that (generally) have movement in them. There are cuts and there are
cuts. Editing (or cutting) can be slow or fast. Many cuts don't belabor
matters yet convey the essentials. This is good. But when cuts make whole
sections disappear, they may leave gaps and the audience wonders about what
went on.</P>
<P>In "O & L" the absence of certain explanations diminishes
characterizations, motivations and plain facts. Why is Oscar scared of
water? (It is hinted at in the movie but not sufficiently explained). How
did young Oscar fare after breaking with his father? Does Oscar think that
there are no gambling opportunities in Australia? Why does he wear
Salvation Army-type clothes when he later could afford better ones? And how
is it that he can be a regular winner in the tricky area of gambling? What
is his "system"? What was the source of Lucinda's passion for glass and
where does her mother's wealth come from? What, for the public, are exactly
the Prince Rupert's glass drops? Why, in the expedition to haul  the glass
church, does the hitherto rather pleasant leader, Mr. Jeffris turn into a
killer?
(Yes, there's a critique of racism toward the aborigines but it feels
thrown in). Etc.</P>
<P>The film is disjointed and cloudy, although its beautiful photography, sets
and often lush settings can captivate and temporarily refrain you from
asking too many questions. The cast does very well with what it has, but it
is all too sketchy. A pity, as the better Australian movies are strong on
people, motivations and character developments, and that's also director
Gillian Armstrong's forte: "My Brilliant Career," "Mrs. Soffel," "Little
Women" and others.</P>
<P>"O & L" can be stunning with pictorials more than with its human psyches.
The most quoted line comes from the narrator. "In order that I exist, two
gamblers, one obsessive, one compulsive, must meet." Yet the difference
between obsession and compulsion is   murky at the very least.</P>
<P>Many touches of humor do make up partly for the film's frailties. The loss
of Oscar's virginity is both comical and crucial to the plot. The jewel of
the crown, however, is the transporting of the church, a sort of
Fitzcarraldo Lite. It too could have used lengthening within a movie that
needs an extra hour for catching up with the book.</P>
