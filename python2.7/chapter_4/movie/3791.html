<PRE>                                  APOLLO 13
                       A film review by Lewis Butler
                        Copyright 1995 Lewis Butler</PRE>
<PRE>In short:  Another nomination for Tom Hanks?  Almost certainly.
           Another win?  Well ... it could happen.  Go see it.
           (+3.0 of -4 to +4 [0 = avg])</PRE>
<P>     I can't help thinking of THE RIGHT STUFF when I start talking
about APOLLO 13, obviously the movies cover the same basic topic;
America's space program.  While THE RIGHT STUFF focused on the romance
and action and adventure and heroism, APOLLO 13 takes a different
tack.  THE RIGHT STUFF was an epic movie about a period of recent
history, APOLLO 13 is a smaller film in that sense, dealing only with
the events surrounding the near-fatal accident that was APOLLO 13.</P>
<P>     I haven't read LOST MOON, the book the film is based on, and I'm
just young enough that I don't remember the coverage first hand; so
this was all pretty much news to me.  The story, however, is gripping.
Fantastic.  Awe-inspiring.  All those adjectives that are overused so
often finally have something worthy of their use.</P>
<P>     Ron Howard directs a finely crafted film, carefully staging at
each step of the way so that the audience is instantly involved in the
action.  The inclusion of news footage from the time (Walter Cronkite
in horrid neon-esque colors!) serves to make the film almost a
documentary.</P>
<P>     The performers are all first rate, and I do mean all.  From Hanks
himself to the Will Wheaton look-a-like playing his son (sorry, I
missed the name, would not be at all surprised if he was WW's younger
brother, the resemblance to Wesley Crusher from "Next Generation"'s first
season is uncanny).  Gary Sinise and Kevin Bacon stand out in my mind
especially, and Ed Harris, of course, is in his element.</P>
<P>     What most surprised me is that even though I knew exactly how the
crisis turned out, there was a constant edge of suspense.  A remarkable
achievement, I think. I could hear the audience breath a collective
sigh of relief, right along with the crew at Mission Control.</P>
<P>     This movie has to be the early favorite for Best Picture, Best
Director, and certainly Best visual effects.  No, they're not as
spectacular as RETURN OF THE JEDI, but ILM had to recreate a *real*
environment, a rather more difficult task.  As far as a three-peat from
Mr. Hanks?  Well, if he doesn't get it it won't be from any failing in
this performance.  I wonder what Mr. Lovell thought?</P>
