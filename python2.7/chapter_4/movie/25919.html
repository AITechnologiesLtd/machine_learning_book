<P>This Audience Award winner from the 2000 Sundance Film Festival is a
touching story of an everyday Joe trying to live out the American Dream
in the 1950s.  Two Family House is funny and, at times, heart-breaking
in its painfully accurate portrayal of one man's ambitious dreams nearly
crushing the life out of him.</P>
<P>The house in the film's title refers to 19 West Street in Staten
Island.  It's a ratty, dilapidated domicile with an upstairs rental unit
in a well-kept Irish section of Staten Island, but the house's condition
doesn't scare off machine operator Buddy Visalo (Michael Rispoli, Jackie
Aprile from The Sopranos).  Buddy looks past the rotting floorboards and
broken windows to see what the shack could be – a popular neighborhood
bar.</P>
<P>Like any Ralph Kramden-style dreamer from the ‘50s, Buddy's plans have
more than a couple of major obstacles to overcome.  The first and most
obvious is the filthy drunk Irish tenant (Kevin Conway ) and his young,
pregnant wife (Kelly MacDonald, My Life So Far) who live upstairs.  The
occupants won't pay rent and refuse to leave and, thanks to a bizarre
loophole in an obscure local law, they don't have to.</P>
<P>And like Kramden, Buddy also has a loudmouth wife who takes great pride
in rubbing her husband's nose in all of his failures, which admittedly
are numerous and quite hysterical.  Buddy has always resented Estelle
(Kathrine Narducci, The Sopranos) for forcing him to abandon his big
chance at a singing career several years earlier.  Now he just grits his
teeth when his better half announces that Buddy is `pregnant with
failure.'</P>
<P>Working double-shifts at the factory, Buddy sinks all of his money and
time into the bar, and his wife's incessant nagging leads him into the
arms of Mary, the pregnant girl upstairs.  Mary's life makes Buddy seem
like Nelson Rockefeller.  She's flat broke and her husband takes off
when she gives birth to a very non-Irish looking son.  Like in any film,
Buddy and Mary can't stand each other at first, but the two grow closer
and closer as House progresses.</P>
<P>Buddy reminded me of Kevin James from King of Queens – another
goodhearted, loveable oaf from one of New York's boroughs.  The
character is the embodiment of the American Dream, whether you're
talking about the ‘50s or present day.  I mean, who doesn't want to
start their own business and trade their wife in for a hot little Irish
number?  Of course, back then, it was a much bigger deal, and that's
part of House's reflective charm.</P>
<P>House was written and directed by Raymond DeFelitta (Shadow of a Doubt),
who gives the film the nostalgic feel of an American fable.  Plus he hit
the Sopranos casting trifecta with Rispoli, Narducci and Vinnie `Big
Pussy' Pastore.  DeFelitta also chooses a unique character to provide
House's narration, which supply the film's ending with a pretty stirring
scene.</P>
<P>1:44 - R for adult language and mild sexual content</P>
