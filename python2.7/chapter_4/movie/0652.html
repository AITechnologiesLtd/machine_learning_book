                          FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY
                       A film review by Eugene Miya
                    This review is in the public domain</PRE>
<P>     This is yet another telling of the story of the development of the atomic
bomb.  I have been informed by a knowledgeable person (L. Badash) that the
total count of such films is between 4-6.  This story is well documented by
many historians: Hersey, Jungk, most recently, Rhoades, and dozens of other
authors.</P>
<P>     The story is important to the history of science because it happens about
the time when science in America became "big" even before Sputnik.  This makes
the story complex: few single people who stand out.  The perspective is largely
from Leslie Groves (whom many people don't realize built the Pentagon) played
by Paul Newman for star value.</P>
<P>     The second is from a new young physicist fresh from Chicago.  He is
involved in many aspects of the development (ignoring compartmentalization).
The other notable members of the physics and science communities are simply
blurs.  Time is compressed and distorted.  A post-war event with Plutonium is
added for dramatic effect.  In fact lots of stuff is sacrificed for dramatic
effect.</P>
<P>     The "affair" that Oppenheimer has in the movie did take place, but it was
overblown.  J. R. had more problems with his brother Frank (who founded the SF
Exploratorium and DID work at Los Alamos) and his Berkeley friends.  These are
the basic characters.</P>
<P>     Laura Dern plays a nurse involved the the young physicist.  The other real
people from Szilard to Stimson make appearances, but you have to know the
players in advance to know who they are.</P>
<P>     The scenery is spectacular.  It rivals (nearly) the real Los Alamos.  Oh,
to answer one quick question: NO, Richard Feynman does not appear as a
character.</P>
<P>     The film does not convey the fear that the physicists and other felt at
the beginning of the war.  If this film has been made closer to WWII, it would
have probably told a different story.  Such advantage different perspectives
allow.  Note that one scene involving radiation sickness probably had Dr.
Robert Gale (UCLA and Chernobyl) as a consultant.</P>
<P>     Place names, code names had to be removed (who ever heard of Oak Ridge
before the War?).</P>
<P>     The American Playhouse PBS series Oppenheimer with Sam Waterston is a
better accounting.  But it tends to make the physicists looks innocent.</P>
<PRE>     If you want a numeric rating an a scale from -4 to +4 (mine is Gaussian):
-1 to -0.  If you want a solid historical reference (non-standard):

        %A Joseph O. Hirschfelder

        %C Holland
        %D 1980</PRE>
<P>     Quick additional rating since, I was at odds with the IN COUNTRY review: -0 (contrasting to the +2).</P>
