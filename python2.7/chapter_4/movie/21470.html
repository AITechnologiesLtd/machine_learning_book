<PRE>                       MR. CANTON AND LADY ROSE
                   A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Jackie Chan's own favorite from among
          his own movies turns out to be a really strange
          curiosity.  It is a remake of the Frank Capra
          comedy LADY FOR A DAY done with a little nominal
          martial arts.  The problem is that Chan does little
          of real value that was not in the original film.
          He merely brings his familiar plot to new
          audiences.  And the LADY FOR A DAY plot is getting
          a little tired.  Still it is amazing this
          adaptation was attempted at all.  Rating: 6 (0 to
          10), high +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Jackie Chan is a Hong Kong martial artist with a sense of humor.
His films are already quite popular in the US.  This film (also known
as THE CHINESE GODFATHER) is reportedly his favorite of all his films
and it is also a genuine cinematic curiosity.  While there are some
martial arts sequences, for the most part it is a remake of an old
Frank Capra film that Capra himself remade.  The films from Capra are
LADY FOR A DAY and A POCKET FULL OF MIRACLES.  This is so unlikely a
story for Chan to want to remake as a martial arts film it had to be
seen.  Chan plays a sort of country bumpkin from Canton whose martial
arts temporarily save the life of a crime lord.  In spite of Chan's
efforts however the crime lord dies of a natural death.  As he is dying
he names Chan as his successor.  Chan attributes his success to having
just bought a rose from an elderly street vendor.  Chan decides to go
ahead and take the role as gang boss put pushes the new gang into
legitimate enterprises including opening a new night club.  Whenever he
needs luck he buys a rose from the same street vendor. From here the
story is a very much LADY FOR A DAY.  Most scenes are directly borrowed
from the Capra.  The rose vendor has convinced her daughter that the
family is affluent.  The daughter has a wealthy fiance whose family
wants to meet the bride-to-be's mother.  They would never consent to
the marriage if they knew the mother-in-law was a lowly street vendor.
Chan learns of the rose vendor's problem and determines to carry out an
elaborate ruse to make his friend appear to be the society woman she
has pretended to be.  Before he is done he has traditional enemies
cooperating in his good deed.  The alternate title THE CHINESE
GODFATHER is an allusion not to the crime elements but to the young
couple saying they want Chan to be the godfather of their first child.</P>
<P>     Chan takes the opportunity to make this film even more different
from his usual fare.  Included is an extended tracking shot that took
three days to film. While it does not stand up to the tracking shots of
THE PLAYER and TOUCH OF EVIL, it is remarkable that it is present. Also
for the night club scenes he has a lavish singing production number.
It took tremendous chutzpah to pass off this sentimental comedy to
audiences who had come for an action film, but the result could be
Chan's most unusual film and it certainly seems to be unique in the
martial arts genre.   The one complaint is that this is territory that
has so frequently been visited.  Capra, of course, did the story twice.
But also with a few substitutions the plot was reused for LA CAGE AUX
FOLLES and THE BIRDCAGE.  I rate this film a +6 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
