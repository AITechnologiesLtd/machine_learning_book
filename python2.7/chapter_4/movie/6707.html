<P>     Prague, 1988:  the twilight of communism in the Czech Republic.  As 
the Iron Curtain begins to collapse all across Eastern Europe, the 
collective voice of the Czech people is finally heard in what became 
known as the "Velvet Revolution."  Yet, even with such world-shaping 
events happening in the background, KOLYA is still a deeply personal 
motion picture that has far more to do with the human soul than with the 
political restructuring of a country. </P>
<P>     Even though KOLYA comes from Eastern Europe (the director, Jan 
Sverak, is a member of the new wave of Czech cinema), its message and 
intentions are universal in scope.  The film's essential kernel -- one 
man's discovery of the importance of love by caring for a child -- has 
fueled numerous other films through the years in many different 
languages.  Recently, such diverse works as IL LADRO DI BAMBINI, CIAO 
PROFESSORE!, and even last year's dimly-received BOGUS, have relied upon 
this theme.  </P>
<P>     The film opens by introducing us to Louka (Zdenek Sverak, the 
director's father, who also wrote the script), a 55-year old 
professional cellist who has three great passions in life:  music, 
women, and disdain for the Russians occupying his country.  Because of a 
past blunder, Louka is forbidden to perform in the Czech Philharmonic 
Orchestra, where he once held a revered post.  Instead, he must work 
menial jobs, such as refurbishing grave headstones and playing his 
instrument at cremations.  But Louka is fighting a losing battle against 
poverty -- he's in debt and sinking fast.  However, financial stability 
becomes a tantalizing possibility when his friend, Broz (Ondrej Vetchy), 
offers him a proposition. </P>
<P>     If Louka, a confirmed bachelor, agrees to a marriage of convenience 
with a young Russian woman (she needs Czech citizenship), he'll be 
rewarded handsomely.  Against his better judgment, he agrees, but the 
results are disastrous.  His new bride runs off to West Germany to be 
with her lover, and Louka is left behind minding her 5-year old son, 
Kolya (Andrej Chalimon).  Then a strange thing begins to happen -- the 
harder Louka tries to get rid of the boy, the more he becomes attached 
to Kolya. </P>
<P>     One of the reasons why KOLYA satisfies is that it effectively 
marries the metamorphosing political umbrella with the changes in 
Louka's personal circumstances.  Essentially, this is a tale of new 
beginnings.  Louka, who has wandered through life living only for his 
music and never wondering what it might be like to have a family, 
experiences not just a rejuvenation of his soul, but a rebirth, even as 
a different country is rising out of the ashes of the former socialist 
dictatorship.  Kolya opens Louka to experiences and emotions he never 
believed possible, and at age 55, he discovers new meaning in an 
isolated existence that had grown repetitious. </P>
<P>     Without question, KOLYA is a beautifully composed motion picture; 
there's an almost-poetic quality to the manner in which many of the 
scenes have been framed.  The film also boasts a strong cast.  Zdenek 
Sverak bears a resemblance to Sean Connery not only in appearance but in 
screen presence.  Complimenting him is young Andrej Chalimon, whose 
unaffected performance allows us to forget that we're watching an 
inexperienced actor.  Finally, Libuse Safrankova brings a great deal of 
appeal to the role of Louka's would-be girlfriend, Klara. </P>
<P>     Recently, the number of foreign-language films released in the 
United States has slowed to a trickle, and, of those that have opened 
here, few have been from Eastern Europe.  KOLYA represents Miramax's 
first major foreign-language release of the new year, and, for those who 
aren't intimidated by subtitles, it offers a charming, warm-hearted 
evening of cinema. </P>
