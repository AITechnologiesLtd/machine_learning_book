<PRE>October Sky (1999)
Review by Larry McGillicuddy 1999</PRE>
<P>Rating: **1/2 (out of 4) 
Directed by Joe Johnston 
Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Owen, Laura Dern, Chris Cooper, 
William Lee Scott, Chad Lindberg, Natalie Canerday </P>
<P>October Sky is a very frustrating film. Parts of the film are 
enormously entertaining. But the script is filled with too many age 
old cliche's about small towns, father-son feuds, and underdog 
heroism. Yes, I've been pretty kind to films such as Varsity Blues, 
which contains the very same cliche's. Then again, Varsity Blues 
never aspires to be a great uplifting film. It just intended to be 
fun, and on it's own level it succeeded. A brain dead cliche isn't so 
bad when you're making a fun, trashy, sports picture, but when you 
try to tell an uplifting true story and aspire to be the next Stand 
By Me it's unforgivable. </P>
<P>Homer Hickam is a young man who aspires to be more than a career coal 
miner. He wants to get out of his small town, but the only way people 
are usually able to do that is through a football scholarship, as 
Homer's brother does. As established early in the film, Homer is no 
great athelete, and of course his brother receives favorable 
treatment because of this. Homer is inspired by physicist Werner Von 
Braun, and decides he wants to build a rocket. The problem being that 
Homer has about as much mathematical knowledge as he does football 
skill. </P>
<P>Homer and his friends recruit a scrawny, awkward, social outcast 
named Quentin to help them out. Together, they begin work on building 
a rocket that will fly. These scenes are by far the most entertaining 
in the film. The four friends are wellplayed by a fine cast of young 
actors, and Jake Gyllenhaal is nothing short of terrific in his wide-
eyed, determined portrayal of Homer. If the film had just focused on 
this aspect of the story, it would have been quite an acheivement. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, the filmmakers bother us with a moronic father-son 
subplot. In Varsity Blues, it was equally moronic, but it took up 
very little screen time. In October Sky, it fills up just as much 
time, if not more than the rocket building scenes. Homer's father is 
a career coal miner, and he wants his son to join the business. He 
constantly belittles Homer's attempts to build a rocket. All of this 
nonsense has been done before, and better, and in less screen time. 
Here it takes up basically the entire second act. </P>
<P>The cliche's start pouring in during the third act. Homer's 
inspirational teacher Miss Riley becomes ill. Homer's father is 
injured in a coal mining accident, and Homer must take his place in 
the mines. A ludicrous subplot about a coal miner's strike provides 
an unnecessary roadblock towards the end of the film. The other kids 
have subplots about abusive stepfathers and living in poverty. </P>
<P>Why did the filmmakers have to do this? There was some great material 
here, so why did they feel the need to drown the audience with 
cliche's? I would have preferred a straightforward narrative dealing 
primarily with the rocket building and the friendships between the 
young boys. Teen romance subplots could have been expanded, and an 
examination of the relationship between Homer's parents would've been 
interesting. The film certainly has it's inspirational moments, but 
throws it all away in the name of utter predictability. </P>
