<P>     There's a line near the end of NELLY & MONSIEUR ARNAUD that, for 
me, sums up the entire movie:  "We all want love, but when we find it, 
we pull back.  It scares us."  Claude Sautet's feature is about the 
mysteries of the human heart and mind, and, while it doesn't pack the 
same emotional power as his 1992 film, UN COEUR EN HIVER, it deals with 
many of the same subjects in an equally intelligent manner.</P>
<P>     Some complain that Sautet's films are too intellectual, but, like 
Eric Rohmer, the film maker uses conversation to delve deeply into the 
core of his characters.  You don't start out feeling much for the men 
and women who populate his films, but, by the final reel, you empathize 
with them all.  In NELLY & MONSIEUR ARNAUD, Sautet injects the finale 
with a bitter dash of irony -- it's an unexpected twist that underscores 
his main theme.</P>
<P>     Nelly (the enchanting Emmanuelle Beart) is trapped in a dying 
marriage with her husband, Jerome (Charles Berling).  While he vegetates 
at home watching TV, she goes out and gets odd jobs, trying to earn 
enough money to dig them out of a 30,000-franc financial hole.  One day, 
Nelly's friend, Jacqueline (Claire Nadeau), introduces her to an elderly 
acquaintance, Pierre Arnaud (Michel Serrault).  Nelly and M. Arnaud talk 
for a while, and he offers her both a loan to cover her debts and a job 
typing and editing his memoirs.  She accepts.  Soon, the pair are 
spending several hours a day together, unwittingly becoming deeply 
involved in each other's lives as their outside relationships grow pale.</P>
<P>     NELLY & MONSIEUR ARNAUD is as close to a perfectly-acted motion 
picture as is likely to be found.  Emmanuelle Beart (MANON OF THE 
SPRING, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE), one of today's most attractive and 
accomplished French actresses, emotes as much with her eyes and gestures 
as with her words.  There's a scene where the slight cock of her head 
gives a poignant negative answer to the question, "Are you happy?"  Her 
co-star, Michel Serrault, matches her scene-for-scene with a towering 
performance of often restrained, but occasionally unleashed, passion.  
Jean-Hughes Anglade (as Arnaud's editor and Nelly's lover) and Claire 
Nadeau are solid in supporting roles.</P>
<P>     It's easy to see NELLY & MONSIEUR ARNAUD as a May/December romance, 
but it's more than that.  It's about longing for the forbidden fruit, 
shielding oneself from disappointment, and holding back from the thing 
most wanted.  Sometimes love involves passion; on other occasions, the 
two are separate.  As in Kieslowski's RED, the relationship between the 
beautiful, young woman and the aging ex-judge runs far deeper than a 
term like "friendship" can adequately describe.</P>
<P>     Sautet's film was nominated for a ton of Cesar awards.  It won two:  
best director for Sautet and best actor for Serrault.  Both are 
deserved.  This is a leisurely, compelling look at emotions that are 
common to all human beings.  When Nelly confesses to M. Arnaud that he's 
a part of her life now, she speaks for them both.  Like a couple that 
has been together for years, they confide in each other, quarrel, and 
reconcile.  They are well-matched in every way except age.</P>
<P>     There are times when NELLY & MONSIEUR ARNAUD seems a little 
sterile, and several secondary relationships don't consistently engage 
the audience.  But when Beart and Serrault are together on screen, they 
make the most unusual kind of magic.  These are two great actors giving 
top-notch performances, and the restrained romance they project is 
fascinating.  It's this quality, more than any other, that makes NELLY & 
MONSIEUR ARNAUD a rewarding motion picture.</P>
