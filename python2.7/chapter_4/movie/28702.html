<PRE>IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Some time ago the author of this review met certain
individual rumoured to be of questionable mental sanity. The
man in question seemed normal from the outside, but the
source of rumour claimed that he couldn't because he had
spent all of his free time reading books by Stephen King.
Few years later I remembered this anecdote when I watched IN
THE MOUTH OF MADNESS, 1995 horror directed by John
Carpenter.</P>
<P>Protagonist of this film, tough and cynical insurance
investigator John Trent (played by Sam Neill) is hired to
find Sutter Cane (played by Juergen Prochnow), mysterious
author of wildly popular horror novels that are prone to
cause interesting mental side-effects among some of their
readers. The novelist has recently vanished together with
the manuscript of his latest novel, and the publishers want
him found before enraged fans realise that the said item
won't arrive to bookstores. Accompanied by Cane's editor
Linda Styles (played by Julie Carmen) they begin the search
for the missing author and end in the sleepy little town of
Hobb's End. The real problem is in the fact that the said
town doesn't exist anywhere else than in Cane's imagination,
which apparently began to literally, invade real world.</P>
<P>There are many great novels by Stephen King that turned into
major disappointments on the big screen. It seems that even
the film that tries to approach Stephen King through the
parody of his work can't escape such curse. Instead of
comedy we are presented by utterly serious by-the-numbers
horror in which the series of shocking and brutal scenes
increases viewer's unpleasantness as rapidly as the
protagonist loses his ability to differentiate between real
and fictional world. In the second half of film scriptwriter
Michael de Luca makes another mistake by introducing motives
inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft, another great
writer of horror genre. In some cases, this combination of
horror parody and horror homage could have worked, but John
Carpenter, once considered to be the greatest film director
of the genre, sticks by his trademark 90-minute format. As a
result, the plot develops too rapidly, the characters are
undeveloped (or not particularly interesting, like in the
case of the one played by Julie Carmen) and the ending is
rather predictable. Although there are few interesting bits
and pieces (like Orthodox church being chosen as the symbol
of utter evil - the detail which would definitely bring
attention of the audience in Southeast Europe), the general
of impression left by IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS is
disappointment, unworthy of Carpenter, King or Lovecraft.</P>
