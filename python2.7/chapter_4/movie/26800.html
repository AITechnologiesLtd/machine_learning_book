<PRE>VENUS BEAUTY INSTITUTE
A film review by Norm Schrager
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>A movie that centers around the workplace can end up feeling like a
sitcom.  You have a couple of principal characters whose lives are
examined, and a small cast of others that are thrown in to add pizazz to
the storytelling.  This may work in a well-written 22-minute TV show,
but in Venus Beauty Institute it results in a film that eventually loses
its focus, trying to rely on passion that just ain't that passionate.</P>
<P>Pity poor Angèle (Nathalie Baye).  She toils away at the titular French
beauty salon during the day, and looks for quick sexual encounters at
night.  In her 40s, she feels too burned by the loves in her past to get
hurt again, and instead finds her happiness in hunting down men with
whom to have trysts.  Early in the film, she quickly approaches a
stranger in a cafeteria, tactlessly luring him away from dinner so they
can do it in his car.  We get the feeling that she wants more -- a funny
opening sequence where she gets dumped helps -- but she's too headstrong
for that.</P>
<P>Angèle won't commit, and neither does Venus Beauty Institute. 
Writer/director Tonie Marshall has the right idea for two-thirds of the
movie, putting nearly all her efforts to crafting Angèle, diving into
what could be a complex character.  We see her public side at the salon
as well as her private life, and Marshall surrounds her with a circle of
people in both, including an engaged, scruffy-looking guy who falls
instantly in love at the sight of her (what is it with the French and
leading men that look like Gerard Depardieu?!).  We get to see her new
relationship with him as well as her friends, acquaintances, and
customers at the salon.</P>
<P>But once Marshall starts spending more time with others, we lose
interest.  With the time invested in Angèle, we don't really care to see
the supporting characters from the salon outside of that setting.  With
its pink and peach color design in the midst of bustling Paris, the shop
provides a creative contrast to the rest of the movie, and some of the
film's best and quirkiest scenes are right there -- maybe the story
should've never left that set.  But when Marshall decides that we need
to know more about Angèle's buddies, the movie and the salon lose their
flavor.</P>
<P>As Angèle, veteran French actress Baye (The Man Who Loved Women) brings
out as much of this complex character as possible, and was nominated for
France's César Award (the movie won four, including Best French Film). 
Bearing a resemblance to Kathy Baker, she shows a life of weariness and
street smarts on her face, looking like she was once a stunning beauty
who now needs to remind herself of that.  Baye delivers Angèle's
aggressive come-ons and facial mannerisms with a matter-of-fact attitude
that shows off real natural talent.</P>
<P>But as lively as she makes Angèle, Baye can't hold up the finale of the
movie on her own.  The final act makes Venus Beauty Institute too long,
as Marshall stretches the story beyond a comfortable length, and throws
in some stupid, predictable plot points.  Thinking that this would be
great for say, a Sunday afternoon video rental, I was proven wrong by
the movie's finale.  And the final shot, meant to come off as magical
and romantic, is too contrived just like, well, many sitcoms.</P>
