<PRE>                                            "Spice World" </PRE>
<PRE>A Review by Ryan Kohler</PRE>
<P>Why do people hate the Spice Girls?  What exactly have they done wrong, 
other than perhaps offend the Fashion Police?  So what if they are not 
"great" singers---they ain't singing opera, folks, its pop music!  Who 
exactly IS a "great" singer? </P>
<P>Judging by that opening paragraph it is obvious that I like the Spice 
Girls.  They do what they do--sing some catchy tunes--and they do it 
pretty well.  They are able to carry that into their first film, "Spice 
World".  "Spice World" certainly isn't a great filmgoing experience. . . 
what it is what the Spice Girls are all about: fun, songs, and a lot of 
"Girl Power!" </P>
<P>Drawing from a number of different films (like the Beatles' "Hard Day's 
Night") "Spice World" chronicles the week heading up to the Girls' first 
concert at London's Albert Hall.  They get to tool around London in a 
big ol' bus (driven by Meat Loaf!) and generally have fun.  In order to 
through a semblence of plot into the film, there is an evil tabloid 
publisher played by Barry Humphries, better known to Americans, for 
about 15 minutes, as Dame Edna (remember her?)  He wants to sabotage the 
Girls' concert so he can sell papers. </P>
<P>Of course, the point in a movie like "Spice World" isn't plot.  The 
center of the film is the Spice Girls themselves: Ginger (the recently 
departed Geri Haliwell), Posh (Victoria Adams), Sporty (Melanie 
Chisolm), Scary (Melanie Brown), and Baby (Emma Bunton).  Each one has 
their own personality and, perhaps the best part of the film, look like 
they are having some honest-to-goodness fun, something that can't be 
said for a lot of people in films today. </P>
<P>Along for the ride are Richard E. Grant as their manager, Clifford, and 
various other characters making quick cameo appearances (including 
teriffic British actors like Richard Briers and Stephen Fry).  And, 
every once and a while, Roger Moore pops up as The Chief to spout odd 
koans (added bonus: he gets to, in the words of Craig Kilborn, dance, 
dance, dance.) </P>
<P>Watching this film was fun, for the most part.  There are a few slow 
segments, but overly, director Bob Spiers keeps things moving at a quick 
pace, with plenty of hummable Spice Girls songs in the background.  His 
camerawork is fairly pedestrian, though the final concert number is done 
quite well with effective use of editing.   </P>
<P>The look of the film promotes the high fun, with the design of the 
SpiceBus being quite original and eye-catching.  Add in wall-to-wall 
Spice Girls music and this film is lovable romp.  If you don't like the 
Spice Girls, you won't change your mind with this film.  But, if you 
find them at least tolerable, get ready to sit back and chill because 
the Spice Girls are here to entertain you. . . and do it QUITE well.  </P>
<PRE>Rating (out of 4.0): 3.25 </PRE>
