<PRE>                             THE LION KING
                       A film review by Mike Huang
                        Copyright 1994 Mike Huang</PRE>
<P>Disney Films
Featuring: James Earl Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Moira Kelly,
           Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, Cheech Marin,
           and a host of others
Music and Lyrics by Elton John and Tim Rice</P>
<P>     Just when you thought that Disney could do no better; just when
you thought that the pinnacle of an art form had been reached, Disney
dared to push the envelope, and make another animated feature.  To the
pleasant satisfaction of many, and in classic Disney style, this film
has outshined the sunrise over the African savanna.</P>
<P>     Disney has had a grand tradition of animated film, which has
spanned the greater course of this century.  Starting with such films
as SNOW WHITE, PINOCCHIO, and CINDERELLA, Walt Disney set the standard
by which all other animated features have ever been measured.</P>
<P>     This tradition wavered during the 1970's and early 80's, but made
a sensational return with its trio of films, THE LITTLE MERMAID,
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and ALADDIN.  Each of these films went back
to the tradition of a good story before excellent animation.  The magic
and charm of the art was brought back from a cellulose, near-death
experience.</P>
<P>     Throughout each of these films, not only did the Disney animation
house draw deeper upon their artful imagery, they also drew upon
stronger characters, and better vocal talents.  To this end, they have
drawn many a celebrity into the recording studio, including Robin
Williams, James Earl Jones, and Jeremy Irons, the latter two both
appearing in the Lion King.</P>
<P>     As the grandeur and spectacular sights and sounds of ALADDIN
thrilled audiences, and its timely, cutting-edge humor brought roarious
laughter, and an occasional tear.</P>
<P>     This film does one up from that, with spectacular vocal
performances, brilliant sights and more than a plethora of the
traditional Disney charm.</P>
<P>     The artful expression of the characters was wonderful, ranging
through the adorable Simba as a cub, to the evil Scar.  Not to be
outdone in expressing characters, Disney also went out of their way to
create beautiful scenic backdrops, with a sense of depth panning across
the wild African brush, often with hundreds of waterfowl flying across
the land.</P>
<P>     True to Disney style, the story is a tear-jerker, which is
apparently geared more towards adults than children, but which most
children will surely enjoy.</P>
<P>     This grand drama of a lion cub finding himself and his true place
in the call of the wild is a must-see, with some hilarious
characterizations, and charm which brings back great drama and art true
to the Disney tradition.</P>
<PRE>     A definite must-see.</PRE>
<PRE>     On a scale of 0 to 10 roars, this one gets 10.</PRE>
