<PRE>                                    RIPE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  1/2</PRE>
<P>     As any film festival goer knows, there are many movies made that
are so bad that their chance of finding a distributor for a theatrical
distribution are slim.  A direct-to-video deal is probably their only
hope of making money from the production.  The preposterous film RIPE
miraculously did find a distributor.  Perhaps the controversial topic
of underage sex sounded profitable.  This shamelessly exploitive
picture does not deserve a theatrical release even if first-time writer
and director Mo Ogrodnik tries to be sincere.  The result reeks.</P>
<P>     Rosie and Violet Wyman are fraternal twins played by Janna and
Donia Silver-Smith at age 5 and Daisy Eagan and Monica Keena at age 14.
As the show opens we find that their father likes to chase the
5-year-old girls with a loaded rifle.  We also learn that Rosie has an
obsession with killing animals as the animals have sex.  The highly
predictive script leaves no doubt that both of these behaviors will be
repeated later and with much more devastating effect.</P>
<P>     When a car crash kills the 14-year-old twins' parents, they
rejoice and go hide in an army base with the worst security imaginable.
They live in the base house of a civilian named Pete (Gordon Currie).
Although their pictures are on the front page of every newspaper with
World War III sized headlines about them, no one on the base realizes
the missing girls discussed in the newspaper are Rosie and Violet.  The
soldiers are too busy most of the time singing cliched songs like, "I
don't want no teenage queen; I just want my M-16."</P>
<P>     Carefully titillating without running afoul of the child
pornography laws, the girls go braless and run around with their
panties showing.  Although many scenes come within millimeters of
showing their private parts, none do.  The girls have sex, but again,
the director holds off just enough to keep from getting in trouble.  In
America you can show anything you want so long as the actors are
adults, but if they are under 18, all of the rules change.</P>
<P>     The director wanted to make a serious film.  One scene has Violet
shocked with her sudden onset of menstruation.  Pete comes in to
console her with "I'm sorry, (pause) God."  Currie's exceedingly bland
performance makes Pete less a character than a visual wallpaper for the
girls act in front of.  In a film where the actors seem to be competing
for the worst acting of the year award, Currie takes away the prize.</P>
<P>     To make sure that you realize how troubled and rebellious these
kids are, the script even has them take a Ferris wheel just so they can
spit on other riders.  The manipulative story wants us to sympathize
with the girls even when they commit crimes large and small, but their
characters are never developed beyond cliches so it becomes almost
impossible to care about them.</P>
<P>     The director seems incapable of getting even the small things
right.  When the girls go on a shoplifting spree, they open their
purses and their blouses and pour the loot in.  Never do they try to
hide their actions, and never does the clerk notice.</P>
<P>     The show's frequent lack of any background noise makes viewing
incredibly tedious.  RIPE does have one redeeming feature.  Eventually,
it does end although not before its preordained and tear-jerking
conclusion.</P>
<P>     RIPE runs 1:33.  It is not rated but might be NC-17 given its
subject matter.  There is sex, nudity, profanity, and drug usage.  The
movie is not appropriate for teenagers.  I detested the film and
recommend you not have to sit through it.  I give it just 1/2 of a
star.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
