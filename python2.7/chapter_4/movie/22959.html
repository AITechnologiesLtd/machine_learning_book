<PRE>_Gun_Shy_ (R) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Sandra Bullock co-stars and produces; Liam Neeson, whose recognition is
at an all-time high thanks to a certain sci-fi prequel, is the lead;
character actor extraordinaire Oliver Platt plays Neeson's foil.  An
impressive assemblage of talent headlines _Gun_Shy_, yet Buena Vista is
only giving the film an initial regional release.  It could be argued
that the comedy's unconventional nature factored into that decision, but
a more convincing argument would be that the film simply falls far short
of its ambitions.</P>
<P>Neeson, in a rare comic role, gamely but awkwardly plays Charlie Mayo, a
deep cover DEA agent whose legendary toughness has been broken after one
particularly traumatic failed sting.  Even so, he is assigned to bust
mafia hitman Fulvio Nesstra (Oliver Platt) and Colombian drug dealer
Fidel Vaillar (Jose Zuniga) in a complex money laundering scheme.  The
newly-spineless Charlie is deathly afraid of the famously hot-tempered
Fulvio, but behind his cold stare hides someone decidedly less vicious.</P>
<P>Writer-director Eric Blakeney was obviously shooting for something along
the lines of a previous Buena Vista release, _Grosse_Pointe_Blank_: a bit
of the madcap tinged with a bit of the dark.  The difference is that
while the makers of that film aimed for smart, ironic humor, Blakeney
contents himself with cheap physical and bodily function gags.  Fidel's
associate Estuvio (Michael DeLorenzo) gets a testicle shot off and walks
strange for the rest of the film.  An even more tiresome running gag is
Charlie's stress-related illness; he cannot control his bowels, so every
so often we hear his stomach grumble and see him run to toilets--not
exactly what I'd call hilarious.</P>
<P>Charlie's health is what leads him to meet Judy Tipp (Bullock), a nurse
for whom he quickly falls.  This romantic angle never feels of a piece
with the rest of _Gun_Shy_, and the blame falls largely on Bullock.  She
is an easily likable actress, and she looks beautiful throughout the
film, but she isn't right for the part.  Not only does she have no
chemistry with Neeson, she is a bit too generically sunny to belong in
this darker world.  Blakeney also holds some blame, for Judy isn't a very
interesting character to begin with; she's just the token love interest.</P>
<P>In fact, the only truly interesting--and truly funny--characters in
_Gun_Shy_ are the henpecked Fulvio, played marvelously by Platt, and his
tough cookie wife, Gloria, played by a scene-stealing and unrecognizable
Mary McCormack.  One wishes that Blakeney had written a film that focused
squarely on them, for Charlie's story and the half-hearted mystery
revolving around who's really behind the shady deals never catches fire. 
Platt and McCormack ignite from the start, and one gets the sense that
_Gun_Shy_ would have had they been the main characters.</P>
