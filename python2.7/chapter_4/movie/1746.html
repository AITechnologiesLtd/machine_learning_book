<PRE>                     NATIONAL LAMPOON'S LOADED WEAPON 1
                                [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Jaye Mathisen
                        Copyright 1993 Jaye Mathisen</PRE>
<PRE>     Summary:
          A very poorly done spoof on a whole slew of cop
          movies, most obviously, the "Lethal Weapon" series,
          some "Dirty Harry," and a couple others.</PRE>
<P>     You know, there are occasionally some well-done idiotic movies.
NAKED GUN wasn't bad.  HOT SHOTS wasn't bad.  As long as you took them
for what they were.</P>
<P>     Not LOADED WEAPON.  This was just plain stupid, more in the line of
THE PERILS OF GWENDOLYN IN THE LAND OF THE WHATEVER IT WAS" [YIK-YAK.
-Moderator].  A weak, nay, gasping for breath plot.  Emilio Estevez
apparently was supposed to play some macho cop walking the edge.  All I
got was that he was suffering from a combination of food that didn't
agree with him, and a mega-wedgie.  His acting was wooden.</P>
<P>     I can't remember who played his partner, other than he was in
PATRIOT GAMES, but whoever he was, he was definitely slumming, and
definitely didn't fit the part.  [Samuel L. Jackson  -Moderator]</P>
<P>     The only redeeming virtue in the whole show was a brief view of
Kathy Ireland in some rather interesting attire.  Not that it made up
for the cost of the movie, but at least it wasn't a total disaster.</P>
<P>     LOADED WEAPON kind of reminds me of the "little movie that could."
I think that a parody of LETHAL WEAPON and other cop movies could be
done, and done well.  But for whatever reason, the makers of LOADED
WEAPON really dropped the ball on this one.</P>
<P>Rating:
     1 star (does the system go any lower?) out of 4.  Just
     plain pathetic.  A few sight gags garnered a couple
     chuckles, but it couldn't overcome stilted dialog,
     plain acting, and a pathetic script.</P>
<P>Enjoyability rating:
     Ah, here it does go lower.  Don't go see this movie.
     Don't even suggest it to your worst enemy.  Don't rent
     it when it comes out on video.  Boycott theatres that
     are showing it, don't even go to the other movies at
     the same complex.  Write letters to the editor
     denouncing this piece of movie tripe.</P>
