<PRE>                                   MALCOLM X
                       A film review by Max Hoffmann
                        Copyright 1993 Max Hoffmann</PRE>
<PRE>Excellent! (highest)
MUST see on big screen; TV viewing of this film will diminish 33.3% of
its power.</PRE>
<P>STRONG POINTS: brilliant direction, strong cast, tight script, the
story itself, art direction and cinematography.</P>
<P>COLD SPOTS: (minor complaint) a poorly placed musical soundtrack that
often distracts from critical dialogue.</P>
<P>     The incredible spiritual journey and transformation of Malcolm X
would make fascinating viewing, even if you rewrote the story and took
away the fact that he was Black, or that it took place in America.  His
message still applies to many situations beyond Blacks and racism,
(listen to his "house nigger" speech on TV in light of gays in the
closet, or women and the "glass ceiling" in corporate America!)  Latent
racism has crept into most mainstream reviews, and many white critics
are threatened by this film because:</P>
<PRE>--      Malcolm X was a MAN</PRE>
<P>--      he found genuine redemption and salvation without Jesus</P>
<PRE>--      he was one of the most articulate and charismatic leaders in
        American History</PRE>
<PRE>--      the film gives a touching portrait of a very strong partnership
        between a Black Man and Woman, in which neither one is on drugs
        or a prostitute!</PRE>
<P>     Director Spike Lee avoids most of the pitfalls common to
biographies or historic epics, be they docu-dramas (JFK) or episodic
(GANDHI).  Spike doesn't over dwell on childhood flashbacks to "explain"
the adult character's motives, he doesn't attempt to reconstruct well
remembered historical encounters that clone newspaper photos.  And most
importantly, he *never* loses sight of his character's humanity or
dignity in favor of the "sweep" of history.</P>
<P>     A ground breaking first for American films *and* Lee, is that he
allows the main character's spouse to remain a significant presence and
influence throughout the film.  Typical Hollywood treatment would have
allowed Malcolm about five minutes for a "love story," we'd see his wife
again when she gives birth to their first child, she'd walk in the room
and place her hand on his shoulder saying something significant after a
threatening phone call, and then she'd show up again for the deathbed
scene!</P>
<P>     Instead, Malcolm's wife walks into camera range, and STAYS there as
a significant and compelling presence through the second half of the
film.  Her keening widow's wail at the end of the film will stick with
you for hours if not days after the film ends.  Spike never loses sight
of any of his character's humanity of dignity.  You will experience
their losses on a very visceral level.</P>
<P>     The film and story certainly have a grand sense of history,
(especially for any of us old enough to remember the latter years of
Malcom X).  But the characters don't turn into plaster saints or
pseudo-biblical prophets.  Contrary to what you may hear in some reviews
or commentaries, Spike Lee *does not* stoop to his own brand of racism
by painting all the white characters as "devils" or whatnot.  The
attitudes shown by the whites in Malcolm's life are a brutally honest
reflection of America at that time.  The death of Martin Luther King
gave many Americans the same kind of myopia about the late 60's that
JFK's death created over his lack of ability as a president.  Spike
throws a little Windex on the lens of our collective memories and shows
it like it was/still is ... warts and all.  Which is why many older
viewers will be offended by what they'd prefer to forget.</P>
<P>     I'm going to skip over comments on actor's and performances--they
are *all* brilliant.  Most magazine reviews have singled out Denzel
Washington as Malcolm, and rated the film weak overall, with comments
like Spike is out of his element in a sweeping historical film of this
scope.  NOT!  Although he'll probably get passed over at the Academy
Awards, Spike has essentially *reinvented* a nearly dead art form.  The
lion's share of credit goes to the dedication and courage of this one
man who successfully fought to bring his vision, intact (in all of its
3.5 hours of glory), to the screen.</P>
<P>     Frequently, in powerfully emotional scenes with Malcolm X behind a
podium, Lee gently tones down Denzel's performance to ensure that we
really listen to the words of one of the greatest Americans that ever
lived.  This film will send millions of young blacks and whites to their
nearest library or bookstore to find out more.  If this film
accomplishes nothing more than that, it will go down in history as one
of the most significant films of the last quarter of this century.</P>
