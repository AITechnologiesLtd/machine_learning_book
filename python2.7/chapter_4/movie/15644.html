<P>   "You'd better watch out for the quiet guys," they always
told us, and if you think that's just an expression, see
"Psycho."  Alfred Hitchcock's original 1960 version, based on
a novel by Robert Bloch and a screenplay by Joseph
Stefano, was so scary that three sequels followed, plus a TV
movie, "Bates Motel."  Some say that the Hitchcok murder
set-pieces are so potent, they can frighten even a viewer
who's seen them before.  Because every detail of the
Hitchcok offering was flawless, even the endlessly imitated
score by Bernard Hermann, you can't blame Gus Van Sant
for wanting to direct this third sequel--almost exactly following
the script, design, and music of the classic terror trip made
thirty-six years ago.  And why not?  There's a whole
generation out there that has never seen the archetype, nor
are many of its members the sort who'd rent videos of
movies that are more than two years old.  </P>
<P>   Unfortunately, times have changed.  The 1960 "Psycho"
whose shower scene broke new ground in gore, is tame. 
The extra blood generated by the design team doesn't make
a dent in shock value.  Strangely enough, though, the prosaic
poster showing murder victim Marion Crane (Anne Heche)
behind a shower curtain was banned in Boston, but not even
her limp body, now thrust across the bathtub's borders with
backside gravity, would stir anyone who is even slightly less
repressed than Ken Starr.</P>
<P>   If it were simply a matter of time's passing the fever-pitch
thriller by, we could tell director Van Sant, "Nice try."  But
while he has followed the master's style almost religiously,
what's missing is the indispensable factor that separates art
from technique.  There's an indefinable something that
Hitchcock brought to the movie, but if we were to define
what's missing in four words, think "Anthony Perkins" and
"Janet Leigh."  Anne Heche is a fine actress but in this
slightly dumbed-down version she is apparently directed to
express her inner state by a series of grimaces and tics and
moans.  Janet Leigh did not need to do this: less is more. 
Not appreciating this concept, Van Sant installed a
masturbation scene.  When Marion undresses for her shower
and is spied on through motel owner Norman Bates' one-way
glass, Bates (Vince Vaughn) masturbates in much the style of
Billy (Rufus Reed) in "Happiness," and Ted (Ben Stiller) in
"There's Something About Mary."  Not only is this overkill, but
as Harry Knowles points out in his website review of the
movie, homicidal maniacs do not get off by masturbation but
only by killing.</P>
<P>   "Psycho" deals with a young woman, Marion Crane (Anne
Heche) who steals $400,000 form one of his boss's clients
and, while hightailing it to some island, is forced by a storm
to stop at a motel off the beaten path.  Welcomed by the
friendly Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn), who is obviously
turned on by her, she has a sandwich in his office and then
retreats to cabin 1 for a shower and sleep.  She never gets
past the tub.  When her boy friend (Viggo Mortensen) and
sister (Julianne Moore) search for her, they are at first
charmed by the gregarious motel director, but find him not so
pleasant and his mother even less fetching. Everything has
been brought up to date except for the private investigator,
who is played by William H. Macy as though he had just
come out of a time machine from the 1940s.  </P>
<P>   Vince Vaughn simply does not convey Norman's inner
madness with Anthony Perkins's elan, nor can Viggo
Mortensen, who comes across as somehow eccentric, match
the undeviating John Gavin in the 1960 work.  Perhaps the
producers should have heeded critic Leonard Maltin, who
said thirteen years ago in reviewing "Psycho III," "just some
gratuitous blood and unpleasantness...Good night, Norman."</P>
