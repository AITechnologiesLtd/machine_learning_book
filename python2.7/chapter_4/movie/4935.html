<PRE>                             FLIRTING WITH DISASTER
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     You know, I was in a real downer of a mood when I went to see
FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, but, incredibly, the raw comedy of this film could
only cheer me up.  And I thought I was a cynic....</P>
<P>     The sophomore effort of writer/director David O. Russell (whose first
film, SPANKING THE MONKEY, was a real jaw-dropper by virtue of its title
alone) is a comedy/romance that somehow captures the feel of both a home
movie and an acid trip together.  On the surface, the story of Mel Coplin
(Ben Stiller) and his search for his birth parents is a tried-and-true
tale.  In reality, FLIRTING WITH DISASTER has more twists than a French
braid and as much comedy as, well, as much brash and uncompromising comedy
as anything else has given us this year.</P>
<P>     Stiller is his typically wacky self but is not as overbearing as he's
been in films like IF LUCY FELL and REALITY BITES.  Instead, Stiller's
presence is deftly underplayed as he balances the performances of his
supporting stars, which include wife Patricia Arquette, Mary Tyler Moore &
George Segal as his brash adoptive parents, Richard Jenkins as a staunch
yet progressive ATF bureau employee, Alan Alda & Lily Tomlin as Mel's real
folks, and Glenn Fitzgerald as Mel's psychotic real brother.  The writing
and dialogue here are fantastic, and after a somewhat slow start,
Russell's film quickly speeds into overdrive and never lets up.</P>
<P>     And how can I go without mentioning co-star Ta Leoni as a
drool-inducing homewrecker/adoption agency employee who all but steals the
show?  I can't!  Leoni is nothing short of fantastic here, and I'm so
enthralled with her graces that I'd probably watch two hours of her doing
her laundry.</P>
<P>     Russell's greatest achievement with FLIRTING WITH DISASTER is his
ability to draw us into the tale he is weaving, to make a fresh and
outrageous film that is completely believable and, incredibly, ethically
upstanding by its end.  It's also a pleasant reminder that, hey, no matter
how miserable you are, it really could be a lot worse...and it could turn
out for the best.</P>
