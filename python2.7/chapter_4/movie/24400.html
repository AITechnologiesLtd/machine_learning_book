Susan Granger's review of "EAST-WEST" (Sony Pictures Classics)</PRE>
<P>  Oscar-nominated as best foreign film, France's "East-West"
begins in 1946, when Stalin launched a propaganda campaign aimed at
Russian emigrants living in the West, offering amnesty and a chance to
participate in the post-war reconstruction of the USSR. So an
idealistic physician (Oleg Menchikov), his French wife (Sandrine
Bonnaire), and their young son return to his homeland with high hopes
of a bright future. But as soon as they land in Odessa, they discover
they've been duped. The zealous military is convinced that 90% of the
expatriates are "imperialist spies" and, as such, are subject to
constant supervision and brutal interrogation. The doctor and his
family are assigned to a tiny apartment in a dilapidated building
which houses five other families who share a communal bathroom and
whatever black-market goods they can steal. "They can't force us to
stay," the wife reasons. But her husband knows otherwise, begging,
"Forgive me."  While he works within the system, trying to secure his
family's release, she becomes involved with a passionate, 17 year-old
competitive swimmer (Serguei Bodrov Jr.) who is just as eager to
escape as she is. Then a visiting French actress, Catherine Deneuve,
offers the victims a glimmer of hope. Writer/director Regis Wargnier
("Indochine") captures the dismal dreariness of social repression and
political enslavement but fails to create compelling,
three-dimensional characters. For example, after two years in a Soviet
labor camp, Sandrine Bonnaire emerges looking exquisite - with
perfectly manicured fingernails - and the escape "attempt" at night in
a wintry sea is so far-fetched that it strains credulity.  On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "East-West" is a bleak, flimsy 5. It's
too slick and simplistic to be truly engaging entertainment.</P>
