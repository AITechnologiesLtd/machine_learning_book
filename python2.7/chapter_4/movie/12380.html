<PRE>                     THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
               3 :-( :-( :-(  for not getting what ya want</PRE>
<P>Cast: Jennifer Aniston, Paul Rudd, John Pankow, Timothy Daly, Amo
Gulinello, Allison Janney, Alan Alda, Nigel Hawthorne
Director: Nicholas Hytner

Screenplay: Wendy Wasserstein based on the novel by Stephen McCauley</P>
<P>There are some things in life that you just can't have, no matter how
much you tear your heart out trying to get it. These include a good seat
on Santa's Reindeer Express, meeting Uncle Walt at Disney land, happily
married men in general, or getting a gay man to change his sexual
orientation in order to marry you. Ladies, spare yourself the
unnecessary heart-breaking, tear-jerking disappointment. Turn your eyes
from the cute guy, flirting with the rugby captain in the change rooms,
and find yourself a dependable, straight guy who will be home in time to
help you set the dinner table. If you persist with the impossible
thought, you will only end up hurting yourself badly against a brick
wall.</P>
<P>Having said this, I have more or less revealed how this movie will end
and sadly, how pointless it becomes. Jennifer Aniston is Nina Borrowski.
Her flat mate, George Hanson (Paul Rudd), a first grade teacher has
recently broken up with his lover, Timothy Daly. Nina and George become
the best of friends (as always), before Nina becomes unexpectedly
pregnant to her casual boyfriend, Vince McBride (John Pankow). When Nina
doesn't want the child to be raised by Vince, but by George, strange
things start happening in Brooklyn. So much so, that George not only
becomes Nina's object of affection, but also her object of fixation.
When George can't return her love, you can't say you didn't try to warn
her!</P>
<P>Part of the reason why many people will not enjoy this movie, is because
of the preconceived notion that this is a romantic comedy. I will be
forward and spare you the heartache, there is no romance and there is
very little comedy. Part of the blame lies with the marketing of this
movie. The billboard poster entails Paul Rudd holding Aniston in a
romantic fashion - implying they fall in love, even though this is not
the case. An innocent bystander, deceived by the billboard into watching
the movie, gets a rude shock when they suddenly realise that this is not
your regular ‘guy meets gal' love story.</P>
<P>The plot is jumbled and there is so much bed hoping, that you lose track
of who is whose official partner, and who gets to sleep with whom in
which room. Leaving the viewer extremely confused about everybody's
sexual orientation by the end of the movie. It certainly isn't as
bizarre as CHASING AMY, but when Paul Rudd kisses Amo Gulinello, a lot
of the women gasped with shock. Like they weren't pre-warned that guys
actually kiss guys, in a movie where half the characters are gay - once
again an error on the part of marketing.</P>
<P>If you're feeling sorry for yourself, don't mope alone. Join Jennifer
Aniston and you can't both wallow together, at not being able to obtain
the object of your affections.</P>
