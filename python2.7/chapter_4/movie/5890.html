<P>     Writing the script for SOLO must have been like putting together a 
puzzle:  a piece of TERMINATOR 2, a piece of ALIENS, a piece of THE 
MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, a couple pieces of ROBOCOP, and so on.  The problem 
is, these disparate plot elements don't fit together too well, so 
screenwriter David L. Corley has forced them, sometimes in the most 
inelegant and illogical manner.  Worst of all, not only is SOLO totally 
devoid of originality, it's a bore.</P>
<P>     Derivative movies are nothing new, but director Norberto Barba has 
chosen to follow the trail blazed by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich 
(STARGATE, INDEPENDENCE DAY):  pilfer early and often.  SOLO is a 
cobbled-together mess that exists in the hope that viewers have such 
short memories that they won't recognize so many obvious steals.  It's a 
dreadfully dull pastiche of moments that were fun in their original 
incarnations, but, here, have been stripped of all energy. </P>
<P>     The hero is an android soldier designed by the U.S. army to replace 
the grunt.  He's the perfect solution:  disposable, replaceable, and 
stronger than 10 men.  In the words of the general in charge of the 
project, "If he's wounded beyond repair, we throw him away.  No one will 
cry when he's gone."  There are a couple of problems, however.  Solo 
(Mario Van Peebles), as he's called, is developing emotions.  He also 
costs a lot of money -- $2 billion has already been spent on the project 
-- so the big-wigs at the Pentagon are furious when he fails a field 
test by refusing to endanger non-combatants during a Latin American 
military operation.  When his commanding officer, Col. Madden (William 
Sadler), orders him to set off explosive charges with women and children 
in the proximity, Solo refuses.  The resulting bureaucratic fallout puts 
the android's continued existence in danger, so Solo follows his prime 
directive -- "survive" -- and escapes.  Soon, he is organizing the local 
peasants to fight against the better-armed rebel troops while being 
hunted by Madden's goon squad.</P>
<P>     Mario Van Peebles, who normally radiates charisma and energy, is 
dead-on-arrival in this role.  Supposedly written for Sylvester 
Stallone, the part of Solo is designed like an action version of Data 
from STAR TREK.  Van Peebles plays his character without much emotion, 
resulting in a personality that's as dreary as the worn-out script he's 
working with.  In contrast to Van Peebles' underplaying, William Sadler 
is in his usual, way over-the-top mode.  There are other actors in this 
film besides Van Peebles and Sadler, but they're so unmemorably bland 
that none is worth a mention.</P>
<P>     SOLO spits out all the typical action sequences:  foot chases, 
helicopter chases, explosions, and gun fights.  There's also a child-in-
danger scenario and a "surprise" second climax (recognizing that the 
first climax comes at the seventy minute mark, it's expected that there 
has to be something else).  It's all painfully formulaic.  There have 
been a lot of high-adrenaline movies this summer, but SOLO fits in more 
as a bastard stepchild than a true member of the family.  This film 
seems designed to remind us how lucky we are that the majority of recent 
action releases have attained an acceptable level of style and 
entertainment -- qualities lacked by SOLO.</P>
