<PRE>**1/2 out of four</PRE>
<P>"What happened during those two minutes?"</P>
<P>Starring Charlize Theron, Johnny Depp. Rated R.</P>
<P>In many ways, The Astronaut's Wife is a very decent Hollywood thriller.
It is utterly compelling for most, if not all of its running time;
intense and well acted, moments had me on the edge of my seat. So it is
only in retrospect that I was able to discern its many prevalent
inadequacies. As the story unspools the film seems to work but after it
is over you realize that cerebrally The Astronaut's Wife did not begin
to live up to its admittedly impressive visceral effect.</P>
<P>Jillian Armicaust's husband, Spencer (stoic Johnny Depp), is the
respected commander of a space shuttle. On his latest mission there is
an accident. As Spencer and his partner are trying to fix a satellite
there is an explosion. Houston (we have a problem) loses contact with
the two austronauts for two whole minutes. When communication is
regained they are immediately brought back to Earth. Spencer seems fine
but his partner has a massive stroke and dies.</P>
<P>Soon Charlize is pregnant with twins. It is then that she begins to
notice strange things about her husband. Nothing apparent, but little
things that are off. At first she pays no mind, and when a concerned,
fired NASA official comes to her claiming that there was something very
odd about those two minutes alone in space she shoos him off, in obvious
denial. But then she realizes that something is very wrong and begins to
suspect that there is something in those mysterious two minutes, in her
husband and inside her that may not be of this earth.</P>
<P>As I ran the scenes over in my head after the movie I got the feeling
that Ravich was afraid of getting caught on a plot contradiction and
decides to prevent that by being as neutral as possible. He suggests
things about the nature of the aliens but he never develops the
concepts. He gives clues but he never provides specifics. Not only is
this frustrating to the viewer, not only does it detract from the movie,
but it's also a sign of laziness on the part of the writer.</P>
<P>Charlize Theron (The Devil's Advocate, Mighty Joe Young) is a
magnificent actress, and she is terrific in The Astronaut's Wife. In a
role that could have easily been played over-the-top B-movie style,
Theron maintains her dignity throughout and delivers an intense,
satisfying performance. Johnny Depp fares just as well. Towards the
climax where it would have been easy, once again, to overact and make
his character cheesy he remains calmly menacing; clearly a force to be
reckoned with.</P>
<P>We never get to know Spencer before the change so it's hard for us to
compare them, which is another thing detracting from the movie. How are
we supposed to believe everyone who insists that there's something wrong
with him when we don't know what he's like when there isn't anything
wrong? That's a fundamental problem; a flaw in the film's very structure
and one that would have been corrected had anyone involved in the making
of this film used his common sense.</P>
<P>Despite its many detriments, The Astronaut's Wife is still a moderately
satisfying affair. It's the kind of film that I generally tend to like;
the kind where quiet intensity rather than cheap thrills is what engages
the audience. This particular film is often quite effective as far as
adrenaline is concerned but it quickly falls apart if you try and
actually think about what just went on.</P>
<P>I'm not sure if I can come out and recommend The Astronaut's Wife to
you, but if you do decide to see it I doubt you'll feel like you wasted
your money. I didn't like this movie but I can't say that it
disappointed me either. It's certainly not bad; it's just a shame that
it isn't better.
