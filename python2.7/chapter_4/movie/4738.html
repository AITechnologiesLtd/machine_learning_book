<P>     There's nothing quite like watching screen veteran Al Pacino 
overact, something he accomplishes with unparalleled style and verve.  
Such grandstanding won him an Academy Award for SCENT OF A WOMAN after 
decades of finely-tuned performances failed to get him past the 
nomination stage.  In CITY HALL, there are a few of these over-the-top 
moments, including one wonderful, pulpit-pounding tirade where you're 
just waiting for the "hoo-ha!" that never comes.  Yet, in the context of 
this unspectacular tale of political wheeling, dealing, and corruption, 
Pacino's "spotlight scenes" become the film's only memorable moments.  
He's no closer to top form here than in either HEAT or TWO BITS, but he 
still draws the camera like a magnet.</P>
<P>     CITY HALL is an example of what happens when there are too many 
writers.  As with last year's OUTBREAK (in which the numerous script 
doctors were uncredited), subplots start vying with each other for 
screen time and the bridge connecting them becomes dangerously unstable.  
Here, the least interesting -- a thriller with John Cusack set up as the 
hero -- comes out on top.  Shunted aside is a potentially more 
interesting examination of the political machinations that go into the 
day-to-day business of running a city.  </P>
<P>     The city in question is New York, and the mayor is John Pappas 
(Pacino), the best man to preside over the five boroughs since 
Laguardia.  His hand-picked deputy, Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack), handles 
all of Pappas' leg-work:  gathering background information, doing damage 
control, and putting in appearances at certain social events.  When a 
cop and a six year-old boy are killed in a North Brooklyn street 
shooting, and the mayor refuses to distance himself from the potential 
fallout, Calhoun swings into action.  His investigation uncovers high-
level corruption involving one of the city's most respected judges 
(Martin Landau), a political boss in South Brooklyn (Danny Aiello), and 
a reputed mob chief (Tony Franciosa).</P>
<P>     Of course, putting aside the question of what the deputy mayor is 
doing playing a "gumshoe", the various elements of CITY HALL's 
thriller/mystery aspect come together a little too neatly to be readily 
acceptable.  We also never get much sense of danger or tension.  Kevin 
is like someone putting together a jigsaw puzzle -- all the pieces are 
on the table, so we know he'll eventually fit them in place.  Along the 
way, he gets some help from Marybeth Cogan (an underused Bridget Fonda), 
a lawyer representing the slain policeman's widow.</P>
<P>     There are times when CITY HALL sparkles, but rarely do these 
instances relate to Calhoun's investigation.  The mayor's struggle to 
erect a bank exchange, along with all the attendant favors called in and 
trade-offs made, lends a realistic flavor to the proceedings.  When CITY 
HALL works, this is the sort of thing that propels it.  The main story 
isn't overwhelming, but at least the background is rich and varied.</P>
<P>     Despite the presence of three top-line actors and a fine supporting 
cast, CITY HALL never lives up to its promise.  There's too little grit 
and too much predictability, and even the central character, Calhoun, is 
never better than half-developed.  Director Harold Becker (SEA OF LOVE, 
MALICE) keeps CITY HALL well-paced, so boredom never threatens.  Even 
so, as political thrillers go, this one stands below the likes of even 
Kevin Costner's NO WAY OUT, and isn't close to the same category as ALL 
THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.  There's not enough substance or energy here to 
warrant more than a lukewarm recommendation.</P>
