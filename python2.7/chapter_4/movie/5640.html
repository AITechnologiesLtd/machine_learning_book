<P>THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS should really be called THE
TRUTH ABOUT  HOW TO DRESS IN A HOLLYWOOD FILM. On the
surface it may seem to be what everyone says it is: a Cyrano de Bergerac
story with a gender twist and a sweetheart ending blah blah blah ... 
Yawn.
This we know, and the ending we can guess without even stepping into this
film. In THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS, Janeane Garofalo is an
intelligent and cultured animal guru who runs--yes, get this--a radio 
show,
where she soothes away her callers' pet problems by recognizing and
diagnosing every symptom they decribe. Garofalo  plays the violin,
reads thick books and is one with every single animal she meets, except 
for
men. Men ignore her because she is short and brunette, and does not wear
concealer.</P>
<P>Unlike her beautiful neighbour Uma Thurman, who lives in a terraced
ground floor apartment, has never received gift books without pictures
(how many times have we heard that one?), who always wears long, swishy,
 spring dresses, sweaters tied around her waist and is blonde, tall, thin 
and
cutely dorky with her oversized, liquid eyes and sharp cheekbones and 
dewy
skin, Janeane is a little rounder, she's petite, she wears dark colors, 
but
most of all, she wears her hair in a Kathy Bates do  from MISERY. In
MISERY Kathy Bates played a psychotic nurse who breaks handsome
James Caan's legs so that she can keep him in her house with her. Kathy
Bates was also overweight, and she was plain and didn't have a boyfriend,
so, clearly, she was insane. In DIABOLIQUE Kathy Bates wore her hair in
a slightly more decent style, but she wore pants all the time and didn't 
comb
her hair, so, clearly, she was a man-basher with lesbian tendencies. 
Unlike
Kathy in both films, Uma Thurman is a blonde goddess for
whom things always work out. As Janeane herself puts it: "when you burp
men think it's cute, when you throw up they want to hold your hair back."
In CATS &  DOGS, Uma dresses in pastel colours all the time and has a 
cute,
layered wispy haircut, but because she is so beautiful she also isn't 
afraid to
pull her hair back for that sixties' "no fringe" look that makes women
look baldfaced unless they have good bone structure.</P>
<P>What this all goes to show is that in the fabled worlds that Hollywood
creates for us to lose ourselves in, women are women and men are men.
Men, of course, can sometimes be women, as Patrick Swayze and Denzel
Washington proved in TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING,
JULIE NEWMARR, but when women dress like men it means that men don't
find them attractive. So although Janeane is short and dumpy, she wears
*skirts*, which proves that she is potentially attractive to men, and
that all she needs is better hair and some pore minimizer.</P>
<P>But when Janeane falls in love with a man, she doesn't go out and get a
makeover as you would expect, but instead convinces gorgeous Uma
to pretend to *be* her. Throughout the whole movie, Janeane is very
insecure about her looks, and director Michael Lehmann, who also directed
HEATHERS and AIRHEADS, is always pointing out to us, the audience,
that men ignore her but cannot stop looking at Uma. Men don't hold
doors open for Janeane, but when it comes to Uma, they get into accidents
because their eyes are on her crossing the road instead of
on the cars in front of them. Naturally, Janeane, who has already lost a
lot of weight since her portly days in REALITY BITES,  is somewhat 
perturbed
 about this, and even though she and Brain (Ben Chaplin) hit it off on 
the
phone and connect so well that they can have sex without even meeting
each other, she worries that when Brian, who is sexy, arty and has an 
accent,
finds out he has been shtupping her instead of the Goddess Uma, he will 
be
angry and
she will lose him.</P>
<P>Unaware that she is in the safe zone and will in all likelihood get her
man--she wears skirts, is not as huge as Kathy Bates, and also looks
very nice in russet tones--Janeane gets very tangled in the process
of deceiving poor Brian, who, bless his soul, is a dimwit not to realize
that Janeane, whom he talks to on the phone all the time, has a much
richer and lower voice than Uma's higher-pitched, perky drawl. Things
 get rather messy towards the end, but you'll probably want to find
out how it turns out for yourself. The movie mostly champions Janeane's
cause, although Uma is portrayed as a nice, well-meaning person, and all
through it I wanted to reach out and comfort her, and say,
"Janeane, it's really ok. You're almost there. You were only Wynona's
best friend in REALITY BITES, but you've lost so much weight that
you're now a lead veterinarian. Ricki Lake lost a hundred pounds and
they gave her the number two talk show in America. Oprah is number
one only because 9 million people tune in every day just to see how much 
weight
she's lost or put on that day (I say "lost or put on" because with Oprah
it's such a mystery all the time, and that's why I watch Oprah too). One
day, Janeane, you'll be thin enough to have your own bathing suit scene,
and then you'll be the topactress in Hollywood."</P>
<P>Although its overall premise is a little silly, I enjoyed this movie very 
much
because of Janeane herself, who is funny, sharp and delivers her lines 
with a
wryness that reminds me of old Hollywood wise-cracking heroines like
Bette Davis. And despite the silliness of her being so hip that Brian 
gives
her a book of letters from Sartre to Simone Bouvoir, yet still inable to 
fathom
that Brian loves her for her brain and not for Uma's body, this movie
moves along quickly, has some nice, funny lines that will make you smile,
and is a relief from movies with Tom Cruise wearing rubber masks and 
dangling
from ceilings.</P>
<P>The Flying Inkpot's rating system:
 * Wait for the video.
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend.
 **** Amazing, potent stuff.
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
