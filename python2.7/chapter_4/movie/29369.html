<P>Synopsis: Ten years after defeating the mummy Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), 
Rick (Fraser) and Evie (Weisz) must confront the immortal Egyptian menace 
again when his servants kidnap their son, Alex (Freddie Boath). With the 
assistance of their old friends, including Evie's brother Jonathan 
(Hannah) and enigmatic Ardeth (Oded Fehr), Rick and Evie must stop Imhotep 
from seizing the power of the Scorpion King (The Rock), an ancient warrior 
who controls the armies of Anubis, god of the dead.</P>
<P>Review: Although "The Mummy Returns" is by no means a model for all future 
movie sequels to follow, it's an enjoyable enough rehash of "The Mummy", 
1999's surprise hit. Writer/director Sommers hews closely to the original, 
but manages to throw in enough new material to keep viewers interested. 
The whole thing still feels like "Indiana Jones"-lite, and moves even 
farther away from its horror roots, but "The Mummy Returns" is fun summer 
popcorn fare nonetheless. The returning cast slide back into their old 
roles comfortably, and there is even a nice usage of the Egyptian mythos 
surrounding the Mummy to flesh out the background of some of our heroes.
For younger viewers, "The Mummy Returns" includes Alex as a point of 
entry, and fortunately Boath is not too cutesy or annoying. The inclusion 
of a new threat unaligned with Imhotep, the Scorpion King, is inspired, 
making the movie's final stages less predictable than would normally be 
the case. Visual effects are splendid, with the notable exception of the 
poor computer animation of the Scorpion King, which stands out like a sore 
thumb. Sommers' screenplay does feel sketchier and less cohesive than the 
first outing, though, and suffers from some appalling dialogue. When one 
character makes reference to the "next" Armageddon, the audience is left 
to wonder how we could have possibly missed the first one.</P>
