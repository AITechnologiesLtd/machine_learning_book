<PRE>A Price Above Rubies</PRE>
<P>The popular culture likes to think that community is good, family
is good, all those emotional things that keep people bound to
each other whether or not they want to be are good. If A Price
Above Rubies has a message, its a cautionary one. Be especially
careful of the ethnic group you are born into--it might bite you
hard.</P>
<P>Sophia is married to a young up-and-coming scholar and yeshiva
teacher; they are members of an otherwise unidentified Orthodox
sect in Brooklyn. Sophia's father was a gemologist who taught his
daughter a thing or two, but she has had to give that up until
her brother-in-law, who owns a jewelry store in Manhattan and a
smalller one with an elite clientele in the neighborhood, hires
her on as a buyer. He has a rather novel way of conducting a job
interview and Sophia and the brother-in-law are having an affair,
a one-sided affair conducted mostly on one desktop or another.</P>
<P>Sophia's marriage is barren of passion--she has to subordinate
her needs, especially her sexual needs to her husband, who is
quite aware that God is in the bedroom watching them have sex.
They have an infant son. Sophia wanted to name him Yossi, after
her brother who died when he was ten (and who is still very much
present). The husband instead names him after the Rebbe.
Everything the husband does seems calculted to ingratiate himself
to the Rebbe. The bright young scholar comes across as a brown
nosing careerist.</P>
<P>Sophia is a good buyer, one who can spot a composite jewel ten
yards away. She spots a gorgeous piece that she traces to a
jeweler named Ramon, who works as a jewelry clerk by day and as a
sculptor by night. She thinks he does the most beautiful work in
the world and she wants to take him on, for either her good or
for his. At this point, of course, everybody thinks she is having
an affair with Ramon and she loses everything, absolutely
everything. Such is the price of pursuing your muse.</P>
<P>The ethic of A Price Above Rubies is old-fashioned, in the sense
that 70s-era look-at-me-ism is old-fashioned. It's a
do-you-own-thing movie, where if you are in any sense a creative
person you will find that any number of sacrifices are justified
in the pursuit of who you are. Although I can strongly sympathize
with Sophia, who is almost a dictionary definition of repression,
I find that this message is out of place in the 90s where at
least part of the popular culture celebrates family and origins
and roots and responsibility and another part of the culture
celebrates license.  The movie has a quaint sensibility in its
stance of sacrifice in the pursuit of the self.</P>
<P>Overall, Rubies gives a close look at a deeply religious milieu
of the sort not often seen in recent movies. It looks at that
milieu respectfully, though with full awareness of the damage it
can inflict on nonconformist members. The plotting is a little
too formulaic and some of the characterizations are a little too
blunt and stereotyped (Juliana Margulies as the sister-in-law in
particular plays an authority figure with little depth). The
story relies a little too heavily on magic realism to get from
point to point--the vision of the dead Yossi in particular seems
like a crutch. Renee Zelwiger is good as Sophia, mixing just the
right blend of frustration and edgy competence that blossoms when
she gets a chance to show her stuff. The scholarly husband is a
cypher, however, and that seems to make the choices Sophia faces
too easy. With no sense of what she might be missing by leaving
the Orthodox community, the film has to resort to extremes to
show that her choice has costs. This is director Boaz Yakim's
second film. His first, Fresh, was a far different look at a far
different life and community. Fresh was one of the best films of
the 90s. A Price Above Rubies is just sophomore slump.</P>
