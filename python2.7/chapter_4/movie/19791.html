<PRE>TARZAN</PRE>
<P>  I have a complicated relationship with Disney movies. In 1988, when Who
Framed Roger Rabbit came out and revived the American animation industry from a
creative and financial coma, I was about to enter high school. I had recently
become obsessed with Popeye and Rocky and Bullwinkle, and the Richard Williams
directed, Tex Avery inspired animated antics of the Toontown characters were
enough to push me over the edge into a permament fascination with animation.
And unless you're a white male in his 20's (which I am) who thinks that
animation is only sophisticated if it has big breasted women being raped by
demons and/or taking showers with giant robots (which I am not), being an
animation buff means watching every new Disney feature hoping that it will be
one of the good ones.
  And I have done that, enjoying all of the modern Disney features on some
level, including the unpopular ones. The widely criticized Pocahontas is one of
my favorites, combining more complex emotional situations than most Disney
features with some of Glen Keane's best animation acting - I like to cite the
silent first meeting between Pocohontas and John Smith as some of the greatest
character animation ever created. My absolute favorite of the modern Disney
movies is The Rescuers Down Under, which seems to be mostly ignored for the
most inane possible reason: disappointing box office returns. But to me it is a
great piece of entertainment. It inventively elaborates on the miniature mouse
society from the first Rescuers film, stands out from other Disney films by
being a full fledged action adventure, and contains awe inspiring animation of
a giant eagle (again, the work of Glen Keane) which is still impressive after
ten years of innovations in animation technique. In a way it, not The Little
Mermaid, should stand as the marker between old and new Disney, since it was
the first to use the CAPS system for computerized coloring.
  I do recognize the limitations of the Disney formula and am frustrated by the
company's tendency to be conservative. Therefore, I find that Disney movies are
best appreciated taking into account the constraints of the Disney formula, and
in comparison to other Disney movies. When compared to, say, The Nightmare
Before Christmas or The Thief and the Cobbler, Disney's version of Hercules
wouldn't be particularly striking in the design department. But compared to
other Disney features it seems shockingly adventurous, a near revolutionary
departure from the house style. And I admire the boundaries Disney pushes in
tiny steps, because I'm anxiously waiting for them to push hard enough that the
whole formula breaks and they aren't able to put it back together for a while.
  I also have somewhat of a bias against musicals. Some of my best friends are
musicals, such as The Nightmare Before Christmas and Willy Wonka and the
Chocolate Factory. But I have a definite preference for the Nightmare style of
musical, where the songs are impossible to separate from the story. They push
the plot along - most of the time, they *are* the plot - and they illustrate
the characters' emotions with a vividness that just could not be accomplished
with dialogue. What frustrates me is the Lion King style of musical, where the
songs seem to be there just because someone higher up wanted to have songs in
the movie. A lot of them really don't seem to have a strong enough story or
character purpose, and I'm reminded of the way Beavis and Butthead's storyline
is constantly interrupted by irrelevant music video breaks. The Lion King is
often held up as the pinnacle of Disney achievement, but to me it's the nadir.
Scenes like the death of Mufasa and the adult Simba's meeting with Rafiki are
dramatic and powerful, but I have a hard time appreciating them because I am so
distracted by the movie's tendency to spin off on tangents like the very
popular song about the farting warthog.</P>
<P>  All this is to establish why, without bursting out of the Disney formula,
Tarzan is the kind of Disney movie I have been waiting for. There's enough
tradition in there to satisfy the mothers and fathers who want to know what to
expect from a Disney movie before they buy their kids the video. But it
emphasizes the aspects of Disney movies that I like (emotional drama,
tremendous and at times subtle character animation) while playing down the ones
that I don't (unfunny comic relief, musical numbers). It's my kind of Disney
movie.
  For starters, Tarzan is not a musical. I didn't think Disney would ever try
this again after the financial failure of Rescuers Down Under (which also
wasn't a musical) but perhaps the success of Toy Story taught them that it's
possible make piles of money and even sell soundtracks without having sing
along songs. The catch is, the non-musical Disney formula requires the presence
of songs by cheeseball white rockers (in this case, Phil Collins, whose songs
are far less tolerable than Randy Newman's). It's a sacrifice I'm willing to
make, though, because without farting warthog tangents the story and characters
feel far more developed. Even the montages seem designed to tell the story
without the song lyrics, rather than just being there to illustrated the lyrics
with wacky antics.
  Before the release of Tarzan, there were rumors circulating that the more
serious tone of the film would be damaged by a musical number performed by a
scatting Rosie O'Donnell character named Terk. These reports were greatly
exaggerated. Tarzan purists looking for a serious, dramatic translation of the
story have every right to be disappointed. But when looked at as a Disney
movie, in relation to the studio's body of work, the song doesn't prevent the
film from being surprisingly serious. The scene, in which animals innocently
destroy a human camp, is more of a musical sound effect collage than an actual
musical number. It's playful and entertaining and organic to the story. I
would, however, like it better if Terk were breaking plates in awe like the
others, rather than dancing around conducting the whole primate orchestra. 
  Other than that there's not much emphasis on Rosie O'Donnell, and she doesn't
come across as embarrassingly unfunny as previous Disney comic relief
characters like Timon and Pumbaa and the Wisecracking Gargoyles. She doesn't
even fit the formula of the pasted on comic relief character, because she's
central to the story, having grown up with Tarzan and being bitter to see him
taking on relationships with humans. Terk's elephant buddy Tantor is a little
harder to swallow, because his design is more cartoony than the other animals,
and it's not clear whether he wanders away from his elephant troop to hang with
the gorillas, or whether he actually lives with them. There's also an
unfortunate incident of Tantor using his trunk as a periscope, which seems more
out of place than it would in other Disney movies since the movie for the most
part avoids that type of joke.</P>
<P> The main advantage of an animated Tarzan, of course, is the way Tarzan moves.
It's Glen Keane to the rescue again, and it's hard to imagine another animator
pulling it off so well. Tarzan is a nearly naked mass of muscles, and he swings
deftly from vine to vine, barefoot surfs across trees and walks on his knuckles
like a gorilla. He even uses his toes as fingers, something I have a hard time
imagining in live action. He's an animal inside a human body, and he does his
best to mold his body into the proper animal shape. It's hard to imagine that
this portrayal of Tarzan will ever be topped, at least physically.
  My favorite character is an actual gorilla, though - Kurchak, the patriarch
of the gorilla family. His design is more realistic than most Disney animals,
but his arms are practically the size of an entire human. Voiced grimly by good
ol' Lance Henriksen, his menace and his relationship with Tarzan are the
emotional center of the film. All of the gorillas are afraid of Kurchak, but
Tarzan has particular reason to fear him, because he has never been accepted as
a real gorilla. When Tarzan discovers that there are other "creatures who look
like me," he threatens to endanger the gorilla family by leading humans to
them. Kurchak intimidates Tarzan, fiercely telling him to stay away from
humans. It's sad for many reasons, not the least of which is Tarzan and the
audience's knowledge that Kurchak is probably right.
  From childhood on, Tarzan is always trying to prove himself to Kurchak, but
of course it's not easy. When a vicious leopard attacks Kurchak and injures
him, Tarzan saves the day for the first time in an intense fight sequence which
culminates in Tarzan raising the droopy corpse of his opponent in the air and
making his trademark primal yell. The conflict is all in the facial expressions
as Tarzan tries to address Kurchak, not certain whether he's made him proud or
only humiliated him. Both in dramatic sophistication and in raw brutality,
sequences like this contradict Disney's reputation as a studio interested only
in kiddie fluff. Kurchak's final scene with Tarzan is even more powerful, and
the animation of the gorilla's facial expressions is incredible.
  Jane is also a strong character, far more memorable than most Disney heroines
due to a humorous vocal performance by Minnie Driver. Jane isn't the usual
blandly positive role model for young girls. She's humorously high strung, and
a little self-deprecating. Her first scene with Tarzan is a classic scene, far
more spot-on than Disney usually is when it comes to being funny. </P>
<P>  Tarzan is also more action packed than most Disney films. A new computer
technique called Deep Canvas allows Tarzan and Jane to swing and swoop and
slide in every direction through complex, three-dimensional jungle backgrounds.
There are a few vine-swinging chase scenes that look and feel like
rollercoaster rides - a nice, unexpected touch.
  But what makes Tarzan more memorable for me are the quiet, subtle moments. I
like the way they approach the language barrier between animals and humans.
Tarzan has a talent for mimicking sounds, and uses it to learn a few phrases
from Jane. When he teaches Jane how to speak to gorillas, he teaches her to say
"Jane stays with Tarzan," and giggles like a little boy as he does it.
  There are many scenes where the animals only speak in animal noises. The
whole scene where Kala discovers baby Tarzan and decides to keep him is sad and
scary and entirely without words. Even when the characters do talk, it's the
physical gestures that end up saying the most - like the way Kala backs away in
fear when Tarzan brings humans to see her, or the way her eyes tear up when she
sees Tarzan wearing human clothes.</P>
<P>  The only major weakness in the film is in its villain, Clayton, a member of
Jane's party who secretly (but obviously) wants to poach the gorillas. His
design is inelegant, his voice is typical of Disney villains and his character
has far less dimension than the others in the film. He does, however, have an
emotional final showdown with Tarzan and Gets His a little more brutally than
other Disney villains. Ouch.
  I'm also not a fan of Jane's father, Porter, who looks suspiciously similar
to Belle's father in Beauty and the Beast. However, the only time he really
interferes with the story is in the finale, when he rather awkwardly invites
himself to move in with his daughter and her new boyfriend.
  But these aren't the things you come away from Tarzan thinking of. You
remember Kurchak's eyes as he dies, and young Tarzan noticing that his fingers
are different from his mother's, and Tarzan looking unnatural whenever he tries
to move like a human. 
  With some Disney movies, I always remember the unfortunate parts I didn't
like. When I think of  Hunchback of Notre Dame, I think of those ridiculous
comic relief gargoyles inappropriately joining in the climactic battle before I
think of the movie's attempt to deal with more serious, adult themes like the
lust of priests. But Tarzan strikes a better balance, so when I think of it I
think of nothing but classic scenes.  I don't think Tarzan is as perfect an
animated drama as, say, Kiki's Delivery Service. But I do think it's one of
Disney's best.</P>
