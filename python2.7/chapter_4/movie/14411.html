<PRE>RUSH HOUR
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Brett Ratner, the director behind Chris Tucker's surprisingly funny
buddy comedy Money Talks, tackles yet another Chris Tucker buddy comedy
with Rush Hour.  Can lightning strike twice? Yes, particularly when
Jackie Chan gets involved.</P>
<P>James Carter (Chris Tucker) is a fast-talking streetwise cop who only
hates one thing more than authority:  the idea of having a partner.
Hmmm...since this is a buddy cop movie, guess what...he's going to get
one.</P>
<P>That partner is Detective Lee (Jackie Chan), Hong Kong's best detective.
Lee is summoned to the United States when his friend, and former boss,
Consul Han (Tzi Ma) has a problem.  His young daughter, Soo Yung (Julia
Hsu), has been kidnapped by a Hong Kong criminal organization seeking
revenge against Han.</P>
<P>The F.B.I. don't want to babysit a foreign cop, so they draft Carter for
the duty.  However, neither Carter nor Lee are content to stay on the
sidelines, and they begin pursuing leads of their own.</P>
<P>In his first fully American movie (at least the first since his American
"discovery"), Jackie Chan might not have the same volume of stunts as
usual, but the quality is just as good.  When watching the film, prepare
to be awestruck several times.</P>
<P>But Rush Hour takes the traditional Jackie Chan actionfest one step
further by adding something usually missing in his films:  good, quality
dialogue. And this is where Chris Tucker really shines.  His
fast-talking wit is nearly as spectacular as Jackie's stunts.</P>
<P>It's a shame that these two dynamic performers, the excellent stuntwork,
and all the humor are put in the service of such a mundane plot.  There
haven't been any fresh developments in the buddy-cop genre since the
mid-1980s, yet it is this old stalwart that we confront yet again.  And
that's not the only hoary cliche which rears its head here.  No, the
film is chock full of them.  (We even meet a demolitions expert, played
by Elizabeth Pena, whose career has entirely been made by making that
50-50 gamble: the red wire or the blue wire.)</P>
<P>But, still, there's more innovation here than in most of Jackie Chan's
recent efforts, and his pairing with the wildly funny Chris Tucker makes
this one worth watching despite the familiar plotting.</P>
