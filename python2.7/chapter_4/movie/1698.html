                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     The central question of BODY OF EVIDENCE is whether Rebecca Carlson
(Madonna) used her body as a deadly weapon.  Her latest paramour, a
millionaire who has willed 8 million dollars to her, dies of a heart
attack.  District Attorney Robert Garrett (Joe Mantegna) believes that
Rebecca killed him with sex, knowing that he had a weak heart and
intentionally driving him over the brink so that she could get the
money.  It's the job of lawyer Frank Dulaney (Willem Dafoe) to prove
that she is innocent.  Even though he has doubts about his client's
innocence, he nevertheless becomes involved with her in a
sadomasochistic relationship.</P>
<P>     For those who have a desire to see Madonna in the altogether, the
$6.00 spent on a ticket for BODY OF EVIDENCE is far less than the cost
of her book SEX.  Other than that, however, there is no reason why a
thinking, rational human being would subject him/herself to this
embarrassing excuse for a motion picture.</P>
<P>     The first clue that this is a bad movie comes with the initial
lines of dialogue, which are as stilted as they are dumb.  Things
don't get better as the movie progresses.  There is one especially
painful exchange between Carlson and Dulaney where Rebecca defends sex,
saying things like, "They've taken something good between two people in
love and made it dirty."  She goes on to condemn society's puritanical,
hypocritical values in a scene custom-designed to allow Madonna to make
a speech in her own real-life self-defense.</P>
<P>     It goes without saying that there's a lot of gratuitous nudity and
sex in this film.  That is, after all, the kind of movie it's billed as.
Madonna's isn't the only naked body that parades across the screen.
Dafoe has his moments, as do Julianne Moore (who plays Sharon Dulaney,
Frank's wife), and a body double for Anne Archer (Joanne Braslow, the
dead man's secretary).  Oddly enough, however, the sex scenes generate
more boredom than heat.  There is no chemistry between Madonna and Dafoe
and the direction by Uli Edel is pedestrian.</P>
<P>     Buried beneath the exploitation is an inane thriller that delivers
more yawns than thrills.  Putting aside the fact that it's completely
implausible, there's no suspense.  Whether Rebecca did it or not
becomes irrelevant.  The courtroom scenes that probe the "burning
issues" of the film are plodding, replete with BODY OF EVIDENCE's
characteristically silly dialogue.</P>
<P>     The less said about Madonna's acting, the better.  As a sex symbol,
she leaves something to be desired as well.  Her character is constantly
referred to as "beautiful," the kind of woman a man would alter his will
for, yet the lighting and makeup people behind the scenes at BODY OF
EVIDENCE have gone out of their way to show her as a plain, rather
unappealing person.</P>
<P>     Most of the other actors seem to have taken their cues from
Madonna.  It's been a long time since Joe Mantegna and Willem Dafoe have
turned in such limp performances.  Anne Archer, who has never shown
great range, isn't any better.  The only one who acts like he wasn't
completely bored by the proceedings is Frank Langella.</P>
<P>     Comparisons to BASIC INSTINCT are inevitable.  However uninspired
the Paul Verhoeven sex-and-blood-fest may have been, it's superior to
this effort.  There were a few genuine performances turned in for the
1992 thriller, coupled with a plot that, hard as it was to believe, is
more credible than that of BODY OF EVIDENCE.</P>
<P>     Speaking of BASIC INSTINCT, this film shares another trait with
it--the lack of a likable protagonist.  Willem Dafoe's character is
sleazy and despicable--a lawyer who, by his own admission, defends the
mostly-guilty and who, with little provocation, becomes involved in a
highly-unethical extra-marital relationship with a client.</P>
<P>     In general, thrillers are one of the easiest classes of movies to
do poorly and one of the hardest to do well.  BODY OF EVIDENCE takes the
easy road, and ends up being a shambles from the start.  It's not just a
poor effort, it's unforgivable.</P>
