<P>Bus depots are not cheerful places. Often the people found inside are
down on their luck, running away, or just poor. It is appropriate that
a bus station is the setting for this film. It is a story of people
towing their emotional baggage through the dreary way-points of their
lives, trying to reach a better destination.</P>
<P>Siblings Judith (Heather Matarazzo) and Wesley (Zach Braff) are in
transit, both literally and figuratively. They have just returned from
a visit with their uncommunicative, institutionalized mother Trix
(Bebe Neuwirth). Now they are waiting at the depot for buses that will
take them to different destinations. Wesley is starting college, but
Judith is still in high school. Their father Darrell (Mark Blum) has
severed all ties with them, so they are virtually orphans. As the
story opens, it is clear that Wesley and Judith have had a difficult
family life, although the nature of their problems is not initially
specified. It is clear that the two of them have provided the support
to each other that has been denied by their parents.</P>
<P>While waiting for the buses, Judith is approached by Jimmy (Michael
Weston), who claims he went to high school with her. Since her family
has moved so many times, Judith cannot recollect if she has ever seen
Jimmy before. She initially tries to avoid him, but due to boredom and
the desire to distance her from the studious and dour Wesley, she
begins talking to Jimmy. Mostly she listens because it is difficult to
out-talk the loquacious Jimmy. He says he likes to travel, and at the
very least he demonstrates this by going to different places in all
the stories he tells. He talks of some of the regulars in the station
and also constructs the stories of other travelers whose conversations
he has overheard.</P>
<P>The film is an adaptation of short stories by celebrated modern
American author Joyce Carol Oates. It is based on three separate
stories from the collection "Heat". Although in the book the three are
not connected, screenwriter and director Lisanne Skyler weaves them
together by having the characters voice them to each other. This
clever technique allows the stories to be told in a context where they
are relevant, and it also allows the characters to reveal themselves
in the process of telling and interpreting the stories.</P>
<P>The story begins opaquely as the characters are wrestling with a past
that is unexplained. However, as the narrative progresses, the events
that shaped the individuals form. Through flashback, Judith and
Wesley's family life is reconstructed and understood. Judith (and the
viewer) slowly connects with Jimmy by listening as he reveals himself
in the stories he tells, and as other characters in the bus station
contribute their own stories about him. The siblings are at an
important time in their lives. As children they have always been
together and relied on each other, but they are becoming adults, they
are going their separate ways. The film captures the essence of their
struggle, how people cope with difficulty, and how life experiences
shape them and influence their decisions.</P>
<P>The film is not flawless. The drama is sometimes forced, and it
sometimes feels the need to explicitly reveal events and situation
that have already been implied. This is especially true as Jimmy is
understood. Everything that needs to be understood about Jimmy is
revealed indirectly in the stories and other conversations, so when
his character is explicitly uncovered, it feels redundant. However,
these flaws are easily forgivable because so much of the story is done
right. One of the main themes is about using storytelling as a means
of traveling, not to distant places, but to the interior of both the
storyteller and the listener.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. The film is both well written and well acted. The
narrative adeptly cuts between multiple stories and flashbacks without
feeling disjointed or obtuse. Although it is not a cheerful film, it
is compelling and engaging, and well worth seeing.</P>
