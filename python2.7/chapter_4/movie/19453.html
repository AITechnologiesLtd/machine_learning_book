<P>"Perect Blue," directed by first-time filmmaker Satoshi Kon, was my first 
foray into the world of anime films, a contemporary animation style from 
Japan, and as such, I can also call it the most outlandish animated film I've 
ever seen. Definitely not for children, it is a violent and bloody thriller, 
but one that is thoroughly likable, thanks to the amicably sympathetic lead 
character.</P>
<P>The film tells the story of Mima Kirigoe, the lead vocalist of a Japanese pop 
band called Cham, who decides to quit her rising singing career to pursue 
acting, despite the caution of her manager. She quickly garners a pivotal 
role on a televison series, but begins recieving threatening letters and 
faxes, and also learns of an internet site that tells everything she does 
each day, down to the smallest detail. Someone must be watching her every 
move, Mima decides, but that's far from her only problem. A lookalike of Mima 
starts to appear everywhere she goes, threatening to restart her music 
career, posing as her.</P>
<P>"Perfect Blue" is a wildly inventive creation that is just about as adult as 
an animated film can get, and at times, I even started to forget that it was, 
in fact, animated. The filmmaking process of the soap opera Mima stars in is 
shown in a techincal, realistic light, and it occasionally could waver over 
into the category of being creepy, particularly the climax, which involves a 
twist that I not for once saw coming. </P>
<P>The unique animation style is one of the highlights of viewing the film. 
Although not up to the artistry of a Disney picture, it nonetheless remains 
almost life-like, particularly in the drawings of the characters and the city 
landscapes that can be seen from Mima's apartment. The colors are bright and 
stylized, and the animation always seems reality-based, rather than Disney's 
often exaggerated features. </P>
<P>Since it is the character of Mima that guides us through the film, it was 
improtant that the viewer could see eye-to-eye with her. Mima loves her music 
career, but doesn't want to be known as a "pop star," and so she finds 
herself in a situation in which she gets stuck doing a graphic television 
series that, in one scene, requires her character to be raped. Somewhat 
ashamed of herself, and for defying her best friend, Rumi, who didn't want 
her to do the scene, Mima finally blows up in her room when she sees that, 
not only is someone stalking her and she has a crazed doppleganger running 
around, but her pet fish have all died.</P>
<P>At 80 minutes, "Perfect Blue" runs at a brisk pace, but still manages to grow 
tedious and slightly confusing in the middle half-hour, which becomes 
particularly repetitive. The exciting, gory climax boosts the film up a 
notch, however, with a chase across the rooftops of buildings and through the 
city streets. Best of all, with the final line of dialogue that comes from 
Mima in the last scene, I noticed a definite growth on Mima's part, as she 
finally realizes she can do whatever she wants for her career, just as long 
as it makes her happy. "Perfect Blue" isn't quite as perfect as the title 
suggests, but it is still a film that I could easily recommend to those 
searching for something a bit more original than the norm.</P>
