<PRE>JAWBREAKER
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>The high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment.  With
She's All That and Varsity Blues behind us, and several more set for
release later in the year, the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its
own Renaissance.  However, you wouldn't know it from the quality of the
latest entry:  Jawbreaker. This shockingly bitter candy definitely has a
sour center.</P>
<P>The most popular, and most feared, clique at Reagan High School have an
unexpected dilemma.  They have accidentally killed one of their own, the
"teen dream", Liz Purr (Charlotte Roldan), choked on a giant jawbreaker
during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday. Now the three surviving
girls must decide what to do.  It takes little time at all for the
group's leader, Courtney (Rose McGowan), to decide to cover it up.</P>
<P>The ditzy Marcie (Julie Benz) is game to go along, but the clique's
final member, Julie (Rebecca Gayheart), has a guilty conscience.  To
make things worse, another student, the hopelessly geeky Fern Mayo (Judy
Evans Greer) accidentally discovers the truth.  The girls' cover is
surely blown...</P>
<P>Not so fast.  Thinking quickly, Courtney offers Fern a
once-in-a-lifetime chance.  After a quick makeover, Fern is transformed
into Vylette, the beautiful "new girl" at school, and a full-fledged
member of the popular crowd.  Does this mean that popularity is the key
to getting away with murder?  Or will this finely honed plan crack over
time?</P>
<P>Jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the Heathers of its generation,
and failing miserably, I might add.  It manages to capture the mix of
murder and teen social observations, but misses three crucial elements:
sharp dialogue, witty characters and the much-needed humor.</P>
<P>It is possible that Jawbreaker might have succeeded in being (darkly)
humorous if it wasn't shackled to its dead-weight plot.  The film's most
innovative twist is the makeover of Fern Mayo.  At this point,
Jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths.  But
then,  all of a sudden, the innovation stops.  The film becomes mired in
the murder-and-cover-up plotting, which quickly saps what little life
and energy there was right out of the film.</P>
<P>In the film, Rose McGowan fares the best.  As the manipulative clique
leader, she truly dominates every scene she's in (not a difficult feat
in a crowd such as this, however).  It's a character crying out for a
better movie (or at least another decently drawn character with which to
interact.)</P>
<P>Jawbreaker doesn't quite know how to handle its semi-likable characters:
Fern and Julie.  Either one could effectively end the movie at any time
by simply revealing what she knows.  The lengths to which the film goes
to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from
these characters.  As their motives become murky and unclear, the film
finally falls to the point that it doesn't really matter who wins or
loses, since all sides have become equally detestable.</P>
<P>"Detestable" is a good word to describe the film, Jawbreaker.  It's
certain that, like the murder weapon described in the film's title,
Jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience.</P>
