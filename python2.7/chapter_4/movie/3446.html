<P>     Ultimately, it's of minor import how much of ROB ROY is based upon 
historical fact and how much has been embellished by the pen of 
screenwriter Alan Sharp.  As a hero of 18th century Scotland, Robert Roy 
MacGregor is known to have walked through the mists of the Highlands, 
living by the code that made his name a legend.  This film takes the 
skeletal myth and builds a real person around those bones.  As embodied 
by Liam Neeson, Rob Roy is a tremendous protagonist--a naive man whose 
belief in honor and whose love for a woman, family, and clan make him a 
figure to cheer for. </P>
<P>     ROB ROY has great villains as well.  Tim Roth, one of today's finest 
character actors, takes on a role so different from that in PULP FICTION 
that it's only his distinctive face that identifies him.  Roth plays 
Cunningham, a fop with effete mannerisms and a deadly blade.  He's a 
sociopath who kills and rapes without compunction or remorse, and whose 
primary goal in life is to make the best out of a tormented existence in 
Scotland.  Hunting down Rob Roy gives him something to do--something he 
enjoys. </P>
<P>     Veteran actor John Hurt plays Cunningham's "keeper," the Marquis of 
Montrose, a Scottish lord who has become so used to a pampered life that 
he can't imagine things not going his way.  Like his henchman, his sole 
objective is amassing wealth.  He doesn't care who gets hurt in the 
process, and is willing to turn a blind eye to Cunningham's immoral 
actions as long as the net result is his own profit. </P>
<P>     The fourth major player is Rob's wife Mary (Jessica Lange).  Her 
relationship with her husband is one of the cornerstones upon which ROB 
ROY is founded, and her inner strength makes her a character to be 
reckoned with.  This is no mere "stand by your man" role--in many ways, 
Mary is as important to the story as Rob himself. </P>
<P>     It's the forcefulness of the characters and the talents of the 
actors who play them that give ROB ROY its soul.  After all, almost 
everyone loves a movie with admirable heros and detestable villains.  But 
there is more to this film than that.  The story is well-developed, 
exciting, and visceral, and works equally well as an epic drama or an 
historical adventure.  Those who enjoyed THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS and 
LEGENDS OF THE FALL will almost certainly find ROB ROY to their taste.  
By almost any standard of film making, this motion picture is in the same 
league.   </P>
<P>     Director Michael Caton-Jones, who has helmed such films as SCANDAL, 
MEMPHIS BELLE, and THIS BOY'S LIFE, adds another impressive credit to his 
resume.  This movie, like his previous efforts, capably blends diverse 
motion picture elements into a satisfying whole.  It's the depth of 
character development and uncompromising devotion to an intelligent 
narrative that mark ROB ROY as a standout of its genre.  It's refreshing 
to find a movie that makes the effort to set up things before entering 
the meat of the tale.  Too often, background is given by a quick voice-
over at the film's outset.  Not so here. </P>
<P>     The picture is well-crafted, with expert editing, impressive 
camerawork, and an atmospheric musical score.  Composer Carter Burwell 
has combined traditional Scottish folk songs with original material to 
form an audio tapestry that compliments the lens work of Karl Walter 
Lindenlaub (whose last job as a cinematographer came on STARGATE).  With 
all the elements coming together so flawlessly, Caton-Jones can be 
justifiably proud of ROB ROY, sure to be one of 1995's most absorbing and 
exhilarating epic adventures. </P>
