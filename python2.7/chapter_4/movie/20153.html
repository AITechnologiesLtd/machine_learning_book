<P>In the past 5 years, animation has come a long way; or so it
seems. New formats, including high-tech computer animation are
threatening to take the glamour away from Disney's yearly
"masterpiece".  However, it is a film like "The Iron Giant", without
any sidekicks or musical interludes, that I think can make the most
change for the genre. "The Iron Giant" is a wonderful film for adults
and kids that just happens to be animated. It is the story of a boy
named Hogarth(what?)  who, in 1950's Maine, discovers an iron giant
made by a foreign country as a weapon. However, this being the movies,
the iron giant turns out to have a heart of gold, and learns to
triumph over his impulses. Christopher McDonald voices a government
agent who is after the iron giant because he believes he can cause
harm, and Jennifer Aniston is Hogarth's single mother. While the story
is kid-friendly, adults will enjoy the precise reworking of small-town
1950, where people fear the dropping of "the bomb" and learn to "duck
and cover". Despite being a fine film, "The Iron Giant" feels a lot
like a tired rehash of "E.T." But director Brad Bird has a lot of
creative vision, and writer Tim McCanlies("Dancer, Texas Pop. 81")
makes the dialogue sound real; a rare quality in an animated film.
"The Iron Giant" is a successful experiment that might have been
better, but its heart is in the right place, and it truly is a film
that adults will enjoy just as much as the kids. Take a chance and see
this flick.</P>
