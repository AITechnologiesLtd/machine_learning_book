<P>Susan Granger's review of "HOLY SMOKE" (Miramax Films)</P>
<P>With last year's Hideous Kinky and now Holy Smoke, Kate
Winslet seems determined to reach beyond her classic Titanic
heroine. In this psychosexual drama, Kate plays Ruth Barron, a young,
vulnerable Australian tourist in India who succumbs to the spiritual
"enlightenment" of a charismatic guru. Ruth thinks she's found
salvation and transcended into bliss, but her horrified parents are
sure she's lost her mind. So they lure her back home to a Sydney
suburb and hire an American "cult exit counselor," P.J. Waters, played
by Harvey Keitel, to deprogram her. Dressed in black from his dyed
hair to shiny cowboy boots, the tyrannical P.J. is a jaded, slick,
persuasive brain-washer who demands to be left alone with sari-clad
Ruth in an abandoned shack in the Outback for three days. There, they
play brutal mind-games while exploring their carnal lust, engaging in
a fierce battle of wills and, oddly, reverse roles. Ruth uses her
voluptuous body to sexually dominate and mentally control P.J.,
dressing him in drag and then savagely humiliating him, leaving him
whimpering. Australian writer/director Jane Campion (The Portrait of a
Lady, The Piano, Sweetie) collaborated on the script with her sister,
Anna Campion (Loaded) and, despite a few moments of comic relief from
Ruth's grotesque family of wackos, they're heavily into the
provocative issues of religion, sex and power. Brooding tough guy
Harvey Keitel is simply overmatched by willful, outspoken Kate
Winslet. You know from the beginning that he doesn't stand a chance
against her, particularly when cinematographer Dion Beebe exquisitely
bathes her nude body in sensual, shimmering light. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Holy Smoke is a bizarre 4, presenting a
frustrating battle of the sexes that seems unfairly matched.</P>
