<P>_Forces_of_Nature_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck make one hell of a sickeningly attractive
couple.  I saw just how much at the premiere of their romantic comedy,
_Forces_of_Nature_, in Westwood last week.  In person, Bullock's
slow-simmering sexiness erupts to a mad boil; and Affleck perfectly
complements her by appearing more boyishly handsome (and I mean
_boyish_--he looks about five years younger) than he does in film.  Above even
their shared brunet beauty, the pair's innate charm shone through: the
perky Bullock waved and smiled especially at me, and the smooth Affleck
one-upped her by actually winking at me (though I, must say, I would have
rather they "traded" their respective greetings).</P>
<P>It is that charm that carries _Forces_.  Apart from Tom Hanks and Meg
Ryan, have two more effortlessly likable been paired onscreen?  When we
first meet Affleck's Ben Holmes, an uptight copywriter days away from his
wedding; and Bullock's Sarah, a veritable firecracker of a young woman he
meets on a plane from New York to Savannah, Georgia, we immediately want
them to get whatever they want.  For Sarah, it's to return to Savannah in
time to sell off a bagel shop she co-owns (long story); for Ben, it's
arriving in time for his wedding to one Bridget (Maura Tierney).</P>
<P>Come to think of it, though, the audience will probably not want Ben to
achieve his goal.  After a freak but fairly minor plane crash, Ben and
Sarah find themselves on the road, attempting to reach their destination by
train and automobile in addition to plane.  Along the way, the duo find
that they're not so mismatched after all, feeling, as Ben says, "a certain
chemistry."  And there's no disagreeing with him--Bullock and Affleck's
compatibility lookswise translates into an engaging rapport.</P>
<P>It must be said, though, that Bullock and Affleck click more than combust,
and that sort of makes the force drawing their characters together feel
more like one of script mechanics than that of nature.  Still, that's more
than can be said of Affleck's rapport with Tierney, but the weakness there
says more about Marc Lawrence's screenplay than the two actors.  He and
director Bronwen Hughes don't develop Ben and Bridget's relationship
satisfactorily enough to make make certain crucial turns of events
completely convincing.</P>
<P>As such, while Lawrence and Hughes do come up with some good comic scenes
(a strip club scene is a highlight) and coax good performances from their
Tierney, Steve Zahn (a zany delight as Ben's first man), and their two
wildly appealing leads, _Forces_of_Nature_ never quite generates enough
power to become sweep up the audience like the long-brewing hurricane that
hits at the film's climax.</P>
