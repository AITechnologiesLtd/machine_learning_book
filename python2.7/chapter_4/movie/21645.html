<P>Wayne Wang is a masterful filmmaker who first proved in 1993's "The Joy Luck 
Club" that he has a talent and affinity for telling wonderfully accurate 
stories about female characters, and carries that right into "Anywhere But 
Here," which is one of the most truthful and affectionate films about a 
mother-daughter relationship in many years, and ranks well within the same 
league as 1983's "Terms of Endearment" and 1989's "Steel Magnolias." The 
fundamental ingredients for a manipulative sap-fest are all in place, and yet 
the film never once seems to be pulling at your heartstrings for the main 
reason being to get you to cry. The richly textured, multi-layered 
screenplay, by Academy Award winner Alvin Sargent (1980's "Ordinary People"), 
is too assured to aim for simple melodrama, and the performances by Natalie 
Portman and Susan Sarandon are just about as remarkable as two performances 
could possibly be. They raise the already-winning material to an even higher 
plateau of success.</P>
<P>Based on a 1986 novel by Mona Simpson, "Anywhere But Here" begins as the 
eccentric, middle-aged Adele (Susan Sarandon) is driving through the desert 
with her 14-year-old daughter Ann (Natalie Portman), headed for Beverly 
Hills. Adele, at times a childish and frustrating woman who doesn't listen to 
what others tell her, is set on putting her MA degree in early education to 
positive use and getting Ann into showbiz. Ann, however, wants nothing to do 
with acting, and is distressed to have just been yanked from her hometown of 
Bay City, Wisconsin, leaving her relatives and particularly, her soulmate, 
and cousin, Benny (Shawn Hatosy). Getting a small apartment "outside of the 
posh section of Beverly Hills, but still in the school district," Adele 
easily gets a job teaching, while Ann starts school at Beverly Hills High, 
where she comments, "everyone looks like they're going to the beach." Longing 
to be back east but willing to stick things out for love of her mother, Ann 
quickly makes some new friends at school and catches the eye of a charming, 
poetry-loving classmate Peter (Corbin Allred). </P>
<P>Refreshingly without a flashy story device, "Anywhere But Here" is that rare, 
perceptive Hollywood film that is about the characters and their emotional 
growth and conflicts. Admittedly, not a great deal happens plot-wise, but 
more occurs underneath the surface than most films would even dream about. </P>
<P>The fate of the film hinges almost completely on its realism and details, and 
it gets everything exactly right. The relationship between Adele and Ann is a 
complex one, and although the dependent Adele drives her crazy, Ann 
unconditionally loves and respects her, even when she wishes things could be 
more normal for them. Adele has a big personality, and always is using her 
charm to solve problems, sometimes with unfortunate results. Ann often feels 
like the mother between the two, as she always seems to be comforting Adele 
when things don't go her way. As the years pass by and high school graduation 
approaches for Ann, she desperately wants to go to an eastern college, and 
knows that it's about time she branches off on her own, but also fears that 
her mother may not be able to make it on her own. Adele loves her daughter so 
much, and even though she realizes she isn't the perfect, ideal mother, she 
confesses at one point that Ann "was the reason I was born."  </P>
<P>In "Anywhere But Here," every element converges together to create a film 
that is nearly flawless in its authenticity, right down to the smallest 
detail. The delineation of teenagers and friendship, despite being a minor 
element in the story, is perhaps more genuine than in any other film this 
year. When Ann makes several girlfriends, we wisely are not shown when or how 
they meet, because it is a trivial detail. Instead, our first scene with Ann 
and her new friends, set in gym class as they are running around a track, 
captures the exact nuances and conversations that occur between teenagers in 
such a situation. Breaking through the wall of cliches, Ann's friends 
actually act and speak like kids who are 15 or 16 years old, as they do not 
acquire a vocabulary as large as the Webster Dictionary, and are performed 
with an air of naturalism that is wholeheartedly believable, by Heather 
McComb (1998's "Apt Pupil"), Ashley Johnson (TV's "Growing Pains," 1998's 
"Dancer, Texas Pop. 81), and Heather DeLoach (1995's "The Little Princess"). 
They are small roles, but vitally important and commendable.</P>
<P>Another area in which the film excels in is its depiction of how time changes 
things. Spanning a period of four years, one of the most fully touching 
interludes occurs midway through when tragedy strikes back in Wisconsin, and 
Adele and Ann travel to attend the funeral of a relative. At this point, they 
have been gone for two years, and as Ann observes, "the houses seemed 
smaller, the streets more narrow." There is a quiet, powerful scene between 
Ann and her best friend whom she hasn't seen since they left, Mary (Thora 
Birch, 1999's "American Beauty"), and it perfectly shows how people evolve, 
for better or worse, over the years. Thora Birch, appearing unbilled, makes 
quite a striking impression in only two scenes.</P>
<P>The innocence of young romance is also warmly done, and one scene with Ann 
and Peter in which she instructs him to strip, only for them to end up 
embracing in a hug, is purely gratifying without being needlessly 
exploitative. Corbin Allred is charismatic, funny, and virtuous as Peter, and 
works well with Portman. The same goes for the lovely, almost nostalgic, 
friendship between Ann and Benny, likably played by Shawn Hatosy (1999's 
"Outside Providence"), who may be cousins but truly love each other. One 
sequence, in which Benny comes to visit them in California, and he and Ann 
stay up late at night chatting away, is filled with such a sense of childhood 
purity, as they are on the verge of becoming adults, that it easily 
transcends even its aspirations.</P>
<P>Amidst all of the wonderful supporting players, others of which seem to have 
been edited down, such as Bonnie Bedelia and Eileen Ryan, as Ann's aunt and 
grandmother, respectively, the film always keeps its focus on Ann and Adele. 
In a role that could very well be a landmark in her career, Susan Sarandon is 
dynamite as the outwardly headstrong, but insecure, Adele. Early on, one 
wonders what exactly is wrong with Adele, with a possible personality 
disorder looking more and more likely, but we progressively learn that she is 
not mentally ill, but simply enraptured in her undying love for her one and 
only daughter. Sarandon handles each second she is on screen with the exact 
amount of sympathy and idiosyncrasies, and not once allows Adele to appear 
"wacky" or exaggerated.</P>
<P>If Sarandon is a marvel to behold, 18-year-old Natalie Portman is nothing 
less than extraordinary, and with this film joining her other Oscar-caliber 
work in 1994's "The Professional" and 1996's "Beautiful Girls," Portman has 
the chance of becoming Gen-Y's answer to Jodie Foster; she's that good. As 
with most teenagers, Ann is someone who occasionally can be spiteful and even 
a little mean, but whom we grow to care deeply about because she is also an 
intelligent, caring young woman whose mother is the most important person in 
her life, which makes things even more difficult for her when she wants to 
leave for college. In one heartbreaking sequence, she is forced to audition 
for a film, and when Adele sneaks in to watch Ann's monologue, she discovers 
her daughter making an obvious mockery of the way she acts. </P>
<P>At first glimpse, "Anywhere But Here" may appear to trudge through well-worn 
dramatic territory, and it might have had it been put into lesser hands. The 
meticulous writing, verifiable direction by Wayne Wang, effective music score 
by Danny Elfman, picaresque cinematography by Roger Deakins, and astonishing 
performances from every member of the entire cast (even Megan Mullally, of 
TV's "Will and Grace," leaves a major impression in one late scene), all add 
up to make "Anywhere But Here" an exceptional motion picture that shouldn't 
be degraded by being unfairly labeled a "chick flick." It is a true-to-life 
examination of the bond between a mother and a daughter, and has universal 
appeal for anyone who has ever had a parent. My guess is that that's a fairly 
large percentage of the viewing population.</P>
