This is John Woo's third film in America.  He's the supreme Hong Kong
action film directory, best known for a certain balletic violence.
Dead-eyed men with unlimited ammunition shoot at each other in a
landscape of easily shattered glass and pottery.  In slow motion.  Amid
doves and billowing sheets.  Usually with choir music in the
background, or with silences amplifying the sound of spent shells
hitting the ground.  No, really, I think this is terrific, just easy to
get carried away with, and easy to mock when that happens.</P>
<P>The problem with Woo's first American film, "Hard Target", was that Van
Damme was in it.  There are flashes of the Woo style, but they're
overwhelmed by the Van Damme-ness of the exercise.  "Do not hunt what
you cannot kill", spoken in that thick Flemish accent of his.  The
second film, "Broken Arrow", was less restrained, much more exuberent.
I remember a review noted that the reason there wree two nuclear bombs
in the movie was so that Woo would have a chance of blowing up one of
them somehere in the middle.  And that wouldn't be the most spectacular
piece of action film making.  This movie was an improvement over the
Van Damme film, but the occassional moments when Woo had his trademark
scenes felt forced, and easily mocked: Travolta, too cool for this
world, lighting a cigarette in slow motion, walking away from an
explosion while doing so, synth music filling the air.  And there
wasn't enough glass to shoot out in the movie, not enough vases to
shatter.  The movie takes place in a desert, after all.</P>
<P>In the first 15 minutes of "Face Off", there was a serious danger of
Woo's trademarks being overused.  The shot with Nicholas Cage getting
out of the car at the airport in slow mo, the wind whipping up his long
coat, too cool for words, as the worst of them.  But the film picked up
after these first gaffes.  The Woo signature shots were more
understated, not really calling attention to themselves.  Yes, there
was the bit near the end, with white doves and billowing white
curtains, but that felt appropriate.</P>
<P>The plot of the movie is a bit like "The Prince and the Pauper", I
suppose.  The bad guy and the good guy switch places, and live each
other's lives for a while.  But don't pay too much attention to the
plot (which isn't half bad), and ignore the small facts about
establishing identity in the modern world.  Too much attention  to that
and the problems of carrying around that much ammo will get in the way
of virtuoso action film making.  There are Mexican standoffs (Though
nothing will touch the Mexican standoff from "The Killer", when the men
have their guns trained at each other's heads, and a blind girl is
trying to serve them tea, unaware of the lurking violence.  They circle
through a small apartment, 9mm and tea service in hand.  The glory of
this scene is that it was damn funny -- Woo seems to have become less
funny, actually, though after working with the less-than-humorous Van
Damme who can blame him? -- and has a certain, "Can you top this?" feel
too it, as he extends to scene for more minutes than you think he
possibly could.), lots of glass being broken in slow motion, a fair bit
of jump-to-one-side-a-gun-in-each-hand shooting (in slow motion), and a
speed boat sequence that suggests Woo may miss Victoria Harbor (not in
slow motion, except the explosion at the end).  The most inspired
moment is in the gangster's penthouse, just after Travolta says, "I
guess we'll just have to kill each other." I won't spoil it, like some
of the TV commercials spoiled it, but it was inspired.</P>
<P>In any case, the new Jackie Chan movie will be out in a couple of
weeks.  He's clearly survived the Mountain Dew commercial, so who wants
to catch this on openning night?</P>
