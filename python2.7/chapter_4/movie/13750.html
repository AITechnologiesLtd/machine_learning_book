<P>Plot: The Mortal Kombat has been won, meaning that Earth is safe for 
this generation, but the rules are suddenly broken by the warlord Shao 
Khan who invades the Earth with an army from Outworld, intending to 
destroy the world in six days time and merge the two realms into one. 
The Earth's fate lies in the hands of Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Kitana and 
Rayden who must discover new fighting skills and new allies if they are 
to defeat Shao Khan.</P>
<P>Before 1995's `Mortal Kombat', the selection of films based on video and 
computer games had been an extremely deplorable one, with only the 
woeful likes of `Super Mario Bros.' (1993), `Street Fighter' (1994) and 
`Double Dragon' (1994) on offer. But `Mortal Kombat' succeeded in 
contradicting the trend to become an unabashedly, unpretentiously 
enjoyable all-out action vehicle. And it did so by dint of the single 
blindingly obvious thing that these other videogame adaptions somehow 
neglected - it approximated the very style of the videogame itself by 
offering up wall-to-wall action, all run over by a pounding techno 
soundtrack. Now comes this slightly lesser but no less enjoyable sequel. 
Anything that remotely resembles plot has been stripped to a bare 
minimum to provide the film with a series of fantastic martial arts 
set-pieces that are slung together in the most directly linear 
connection possible. The downside of this is that the film tends to all 
blur into one single shapeless action sequence. Nevertheless it is the 
sheer fantastique bravado of the fight sequences where the kombatants 
battle centaurs, four-armed opponents, use razor-tipped hair-braids, 
unleash ice and sonic voice blasts and launch missiles built into their 
chests that gives it a uniquely watchable edge.</P>
