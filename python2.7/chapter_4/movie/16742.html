<P>   During the Renaissance, the Italian writer Niccolo
Machiavelli wrote a classic handbook, "The Prince," full of
advice to rulers of Italian city-states on how to seize and
maintain power.  He also served as adviser to some of the
potentates of his time.  If he were alive today in America, his
occupation would be obvious: he would have been hired on to
President Clinton's legal staff to tell the chief executive how
to maintain his hold on government.  He might later write a
tell-all book detailing precisely how the president seduced
that woman.  Or was it the other way around?  Now that,
rather than any political treatise, would be a best-seller.  If he
were a screenwriter, though, ol' Nick might use his inside
knowledge of presidential dalliance to dabble with a racy plot
about a two lusty villains--one who gets his jollies from
seducing and abandoning members of the female sex, the
other from egging him on to do just that.  The story would
look like Christopher Hampton's hit stage play, "Les Liaisons
Dangereuses" which was effectively adapted to the screen
ten years ago by Stephen Frears, called "Dangerous
Liaisons."  "Cruel Intentions" is obviously inspired by that
story.</P>
<P>   In "Dangerous Liaisons" the remarkable Glenn Close
performed in the role of The Marquise de Merteuil, a bitch if
ever there was one, a woman determined to crush the spirit
of young women brazen enough to fall in love.  She had a
great lover herself, but when he abandoned her to marry the
innocent Cecile (Uma Thurman), she assigned the Vicomte
de Valmont (played by John Malkovich) to seduce her before
she could present herself to her husband as a virgin.  But the
Vicomte instead becomes interested in the married and
virtuous Madame de Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer), who is
ironically fired by the very evil in the Vicomte and decides to
find out what it means to become a bad girl.  Naturally the
Vicomte and the Madame fall in love.</P>
<P>   In writing and directing "Cruel Intentions," Roger Kumble
("Dumb & Dumber," "Kingpin," "National Lampoon's Senior
Trip") targets a younger audience, changing the locale from
the boudoirs of France to the elegant old houses around New
York's Central Park.  More important, he cuts the age of the
characters, putting them in a fancy prep school for
teenagers.  His reasoning--according to the production notes-
-is that high-school kids are a mischievous lot and so a plot
of Machiavellian dimensions would not be unusual for the
preppy set. </P>
<P>   Unfortunately that very reasoning is the picture's flaw. 
While any audience could take the sinister machinations of
Glenn Close and John Malkovich seriously, especially when
pitted against the innocence of folks played by Uma Thurman
and Michelle Pfeiffer, we have a hard time locating any real
profundity in the young brats of "Cruel Intentions."  The movie
intends to be like an 18th century comedy of manners with
tragic undertones.  Instead, while it possesses an effectively
amusing initial half, Kumble's attempt to mine anguish of
tragic proportions becomes no more than a display of sappy
melodrama.  </P>
<P>   The story takes shape when Kathryn (Sarah Michelle
Gellar) loses her boy friend Ronald (Sean Patrick Thomas) to
the innocent Cecile (Selma Blair).  To get revenge on
Ronald, she becomes determined to turn her successful
competitor into a slut.  He advises Cecile to sleep with as
many boys as she can, assigns her step-brother Sebastian
(Ryan Phillippe) to deflower her, and to inflict damage on
Sebastian as well, he bets him that he cannot seduce the
lovely and virginal Annette (Reese Witherspoon).</P>
<P>   Once the acrid workings of conspiracy give way to the
honeyed charm of love, the film loses its edge.  Sarah
Michelle Gellar, best known for her TV series as Buffy the
Vampire Slayer, is hardly the right choice for a Lady
Macbeth, given her irritatingly nasal voice and all-too-precious
features.  She tries to pass herself off as a veritable monster
but comes across more as a kewpie doll that would
perpetually whine "hug me."  For his part Ryan Phillippe as
the scheming Sebastian Valmont looks more like a
super-senior too effete to play soccer with his fellows, a guy
not too likely to charm today's teenage women--who may not
know how to read but who should be able to see right
through his faux allure.  The one principal winner in the
picture is Reese Witherspoon as Annette, the headmaster's
daughter, who had written an article in Seventeen Magazine
about her intention to stay pure until she marries her
boyfriend.  Her performance is perfectly natural, believable,
and affecting.</P>
<P>   We do come away with the awareness that Kathryn and
Sebastian plot mayhem against the young women in the story
because of the attraction, even adoration, that they have for
each other, a fascination they appear unable or unwilling to
declare.  When love is repressed, it may come out in
perverse ways; thus, the diabolic schemes of the two
frustrated lovers.  By the somber conclusion of the story we
are not moved by a sense of tragedy but by a feeling that
we've witnessed fun and games of two silly but smart teens,
both of whom confront a more serious justice than they
deserve.  A suspension from school for a week would seem
more to the point.</P>
<P>   The work is filmed splendidly in some of Manhattan's
posher areas around Central Park, home to bluebloods and
nouveau-riches alike--effectively transplanting 18th Century
French aristocracy to the Big Apple.  </P>
