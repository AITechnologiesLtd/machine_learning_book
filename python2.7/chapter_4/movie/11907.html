<PRE>If Lucy Fell
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1996 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>Sarah Jessica Parker and Eric Schaeffer renew a suicide pact to jump off the
Brooklyn Bridge together if they are not involved in fulfilling relationships
by the time she turns 30. There's a heavy deadline because her birthday is in
a month so they are both out there looking for the loves of their lives and
hot to find them in four weeks.</P>
<P>If you can accept the premise, and that's a difficult task, there are a few
decent scenes and a couple of great lines. Besides swallowing the outrageous
concept ("We believe in reincarnation, so if we're not happy and in love in a
few days, we'll kill ourselves."), you have to immerse yourself in the
Generation X world (although at 30, the characters must be elder
statespersons) where serious conversations are about spit and "Whatever" is a
complete sentence.</P>
<P>There's not much interesting about the two main characters. They both seem
superficial and the actors don't go very far towards livening them up. The two
objects of their affections -- an inarticulate artist and the beautiful woman
next door (Elle Macpherson) -- are infinitely more faceted.</P>
<P>The theme of the film, people stuck in the same ole same ole get on with
their lives when they set a deadline, holds some universal appeal. Parker
moves on a career plan, dumps her sorta boyfriend and starts dating. Schaeffer
has an art show of his paintings and finally approaches the woman he has
admired for year.</P>
<P>Unfortunately the film is filled with cliches (two long-time friends go
looking for love, guess who they end up with) and long periods of time where
nothing happens. Some nice music though.</P>
<P>[This appeared in the 3/14/96 "Bloomington Voice", Bloomington, Indiana.
