<P>All those who were offended by There's Something About Mary should not
tread in the waters of American Pie, a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster
ride of raunch. And while this uproariously funny, gross-out summer
movie is basically an exercise in bad taste, it also demonstrates a
surprising sweetness in the end.</P>
<P>American Pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare
this season. I must question the studio that releases a movie like this.
The producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd, but while
pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an R-rated film. Some
have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded NC-17, a rating the MPAA
gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a Restricted movie.
American Pie was threatened with an NC-17, but after snipping a few
scenes from the finished product, it was given an R. But at least this
new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like South
Park. It is sick, perverse, and ultimately disgusting - not to mention
extremely funny.</P>
<P>American Pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose
their virginity by prom night. Jim (Jason Biggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian
Nicholas), Oz (Chris Klein) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) are a quartet
of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something
they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead. Jim inquires
what it feels like when you reach third base, to which one of his
friends replies: `Like warm apple pie...'. Of course, this prompts the
scene unfairly exposed in the trailers, in which Jim and a freshly baked
pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner. There are many
moments, such as this, in which director Paul Weitz uses a game-plan
similar to the one frequently displayed in Mary: to cause the audience
to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief. American Pie is a
hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick
with it.</P>
<P>I loved the young cast in this movie. Consider the subject matter that
these actors have dealt with, obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in
any of their previous projects, and you should appreciate their
performances. Biggs is more than enjoyable, and Chris Klein (who
recently played a similar jock in Election) is obviously a young talent
on the rise. But in a teen-dominated movie, the best performance comes
from comedian Eugene Levy (of television's SCTV), who is unexpectedly
brilliant as Jim's uneasy father. Scenes in which the familiar
father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the
funniest moments to be found in American Pie. After Levy discovers Jim's
new use for apple pie, he tells him, `I did a fare share of that sort of
thing when I was your age. But I never used baked goods.' It is
performances such as his, and Bill Murray's in Rushmore, that are often
unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out.</P>
<P>There are some less-than-original aspects of the film. A bathroom
incident involving Finch and a bottle of Ex-Lax is something we've seen
before. If Weitz is planning to take after the Farrelly brothers, then
this is a decidedly unwise move: the same prank was pulled in the
brother's Dumb and Dumber, and used to greater effect. Secondly, the
characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more
artificial than amusing. But at one point, in which we discover that
American Pie does have a heart of it's own, Biggs asks his buddies why
he's going through so much pressure for something that's `not very
important anyway.' And so we realize that while the film is expressive
about a subject that is hardly appropriate, it still manages to be
mature. In it's own way.</P>
