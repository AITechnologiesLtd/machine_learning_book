<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>Like Ang Lee's previous film, this one is funny, sad, wonderful, boring,
interesting, all wrapped up into one package.  As ususal, the story is about
the chinese in a new place and time, in America, and their  adjustments to
life, in general.</P>
<P>But, unlike, THE WEDDING BANQUET, this one is funnier for many reasons. The
word is eccentric.  And the bottom line is that we will never understand one
man's thinking, let alone one woman's. And the inevitable suggestion is that
a misplaced national of any kind, makes even more irrational decisions.  And
EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN, gives us just such a wonderful twist.</P>
<P>Chu, has been a master chef for a long time.  And since his wife died, his
way of enjoying life has been to cook up feasts for his three daughters at
least once a week on Sundays.  But the meal is overdone, in that there is
too much which the daughters can not even eat or touch anymore.  For chu,
burying himself in work life this is easier than facing the world, or his
daughters, with their ever present love life.  His is nil.</P>
<P>And one day, he has finaly gotten tired of the lack of appreciation by his
family.  He decides to make a little time for himself, and even comes up
with a girlfriend.  But, here the surprise is unwrapped, like a sumptuous
meal.  And, like a great chef, another dish is served.  But this time it is
not in the restaurant or the home.  It is his feeling, that has finaly been
defined enough, that he does something about.</P>
<P>With some nice touches here and there, the cinamatography around the food is
rather interesting.  It uses a fast cutting style, to show the fast way that
a chef thinks and acts in most cases.  But, in life, it is all slow.  The
daughters can never make up their minds, and Chu can't decide between
retirement, or hiding.  Well, he ends up doing neither.</P>
<P>A fun film to enjoy, it does stand out.  Ang Lee is letting us see a side of
the chinese life, that we never had anticipated in the  movies.  And for
once, the characters are not card board, or stereo types.  And it has some
nice touches.  The food is just amazing.  Makes your mouth water.  The film
isn't quite that good, but it sure teases enough.</P>
<PRE>Worth seeing
