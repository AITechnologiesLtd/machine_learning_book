<P>On 3BC's "Viewer Voices" webboard, Chris Utley mentions that in numerous
other reviews of THE BROTHERS, some [begin code word] mainstream [end
code word] critics are complaining that it's "just another flick in the
same vein as THE BEST MAN and THE WOOD and the films in this genre of
young Black professionals seeking romance, etc."</P>
<P>Yeah; lord knows we need to get back to the days when the only Black man
in a movie, played the ObThug.  What's that now: FIVE "Professional
Black Man/Woman Seeks Fulfillment And The American Dream - Just Like
Their White Counterparts" movies to UMPTEEN "Hoodrat/Thug/Drug
Dealer/SkantchHoe/Pimp/Ig'nant Shuffling Sambo..." flicks?</P>
<PRE>[rolls eyes]</PRE>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
THE BROTHERS literally starts with a bang, as Dr. Jackson Smith (Morris
Chestnut) recounts the nightmares he has of a mysterious woman in bridal
attire coming after him with a gun, to his therapist (Vanessa Bell
Calloway).</P>
<P>And speaking of brides, Terry Wright (Shemar Moore), one of Jack's
running buddies (a group of four professional Black men who call
themselves "The Brothers") announces that he's about to jump the broom
with his girlfriend of two months, BeBe Fales (Susan Dalian).  The
Brothers are underwhelmed by this news, especially lawyer Brian Palmer
(Bill Bellamy), who's never met a Black woman without Issues [listen
closely, and you can almost hear the Black Sista 3-Snaps-Up from Angela
Brooks as the spurned Judge], and thus looks to a White woman (Julie
Benz) to fulfill his needs.  And speaking of not having one's needs
fulfilled, fellow Brother Derrick West (D.L. Hughley) is also not quite
enthusiastic over Terry's news; Derrick speaks from experience, as his
wife Sheila (Tamala Jones) refuses to, as the youngsters say, "give
Derrick brain", or to entertain thoughts of letting D's mother (Marla
Gibbs) live with them.</P>
<P>Jack also has Intimacy Issues, stemming from the way his father (Clifton
Powell) abandoned his feisty mother (the wonderful Jenifer Lewis),
leaving them and his wacky sister Cherie (Tatyana Ali) to fend for
themselves.  But Jack's world is about to be turned upside down, as he
meets and falls for freelance photographer Denice Johnson (Gabrielle
Union); Denice *seems* normal enough at first glance, but like most of
the women in The Brothers' lives, she has a skeleton in her closet, too.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Even with my eyes rolling at my fellow critics, it pains me to say that
THE BROTHERS just didn't Do It for me; not because of some misguided
notion that the Black Movie Role scale has been balanced now that it's
finally hitting the positive end more often - sorry Mr. Charlie, we're a
*lonnnnnng* way away from things being Even, Steven - but because it
paled in comparison to the much better THE BEST MAN, and indeed, was too
derivative of that movie.  One could easily switch the actors in both
movies, and except for the more balanced strength of TBM's cast (sorry
Shemar Moore and Bill Bellamy; you're no Morris Chestnut/Taye Diggs and
Terrence Dashon Howard), come away with nearly the same concept, though
not nearly the same strong movie.</P>
<P>Not to say that there weren't some good-to-great performances in THE
BROTHERS.  Morris Chestnut, as always, put in solid work as Jackson
(even though his character's main conflict made absolutely no sense to
me), and had wonderful chemistry with Gabrielle Union as Denice.  D.L.
Hughley had me absolutely rolling as the sexually frustrated Derrick
West, and put me in mind of, strangely enough, Burgess Meredith in
GRUMPY OLD MEN (made more evident by the outtakes shown at the end).
And Jenifer Lewis once again ran away with a movie, in a role (the
mother) that was probably supposed to suppress her power, but you might
as well ask the sun not to shine as to try to tuck Lewis' abilities to
Bring It, away.</P>
<P>But Bill Bellamy ought to go back to stand-up comedy, or MTV-hosting,
because - as his scenes with his movie mother proved - the man can't
act; more's the pity, because his character's playa-hating and "jungle
fever" *could* have had much more pivotal impact, given a better actor.
Ditto Shemar Moore, who stood there looking as pretty as he wanna be,
but added little to the movie itself.  In his case, though, I fault the
writing and directing more than the actor.  Where Bellamy was given *too
much* to do with too little talent to support it, Moore simply wasn't
given the tools he needed to make Terry much more than a bad plot
device.</P>
<P>And the women in THE BROTHERS?  Besides the powerhouse that is Ms.
Lewis, and Union's good showing, the women came off here pretty badly.
Not that I was surprised by that; after all, the Black Males In
Female-Driven Black Movies scale is also unbalanced with an
overabundance of McMillanesque No Good Black Men.  "Touche", I guess.</P>
<P>My biggest gripe?  It's not so much that women, as a gender, get blasted
in "Brothers" - hey, some of my sisters *deserve* the thrashing - but
that putting a penis on a skreech, doesn't improve the skreech.
Apparently, Terry McMillan doesn't have the corner on Black
gender-bashing.  Writer/director Gary Hardwick had the beginnings of a
good idea, but let it get away from him, failing to support his idea
with a solid storyline, believable backstory, or straightforward
character development.  What started out as a near-copycat of THE BEST
MAN ended up as WAITING TO EXHALE in drag, with an implied Oedipal
conflict thrown in for "good" measure.</P>
<P>The Interview:
I had the honor of interviewing Morris Chestnut before the special
limited showing of THE BROTHERS in which he came to Lansing (yes, I was
shocked, too) to introduce the movie to our audience.  As I expected, he
was quite charming, rivetingly handsome (though slimmer than I expected,
especially after seeing him in THE BEST MAN last year), and serious
about his craft.  We spoke about his breakout role in BOYZ IN THE HOOD
and how he's grown as an actor since then; he told me that he looks for
roles with depth and meaning, and that his long-term plans are to get
involved behind-the-scenes as a producer and director, and to continue
to elevate his art.  He seemed proud of THE BROTHERS; and though I don't
share his enthusiasm with the overall product, Chestnut's solid
contribution to it, as with his past performances, warrant his pride.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
I struggled with this one - I truly did - but in the end, I had to mark
it down a notch from the conditional green that I *wanted* to give THE
BROTHERS, because its miscues, lack of direction, and derivative nature,
overshadowed the solid performances by Morris Chestnut, Gabrielle Union,
Jenifer Lewis, and the hilarious D.L. Hughley.  I *will* have to see it
again, though - the ghettofabulous crowd made me miss too much the first
time.</P>
<P>THE BROTHERS (rating: flashing yellowlight):
But still, I'd take a thousand "Brothers" over one more Black Gangsta
flick, *any*day.</P>
