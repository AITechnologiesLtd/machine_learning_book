<PRE>               A film review by Michael Dequina</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1997 Michael Dequina</PRE>
<P>Shadow Conspiracy (R) no stars (out of ****)</P>
<P>Movies released in January typically come in three types: (1) wide
releases of year-end limited engagements (Evita); (2) unpretentious
crowdpleasers (Metro); and (3) long-delayed movies that are finally cleared
from the studio shelves.  Falling under the latter category (along with The
Relic) is Shadow Conspiracy, and after sitting through this Charlie Sheen
thriller, it's no mystery why it has collected dust for nearly a year--it
stinks.</P>
<P>Sheen stars as presidential assistant Bobby Bishop, whose brilliant
speechwriting skills won the nameless Chief Executive (Sam Waterston) a
second term.  After a prominent professor is mysteriously murdered, Bishop,
with the help of reporter--and, natch, former flame--Amanda Givens (Linda
Hamilton) uncovers a deadly conspiracy lurking within the shadows of the
government (hence the film's title).</P>
<P>It would be easy to dismiss Shadow Conspiracy on the terms of its
writing and directing, which is abysmal.  Adi Hasak and Ric Gibbs's script
is not only predictable and hackneyed, but cornball as well.  It's quite
telling when the film's most original moment is also its most ludicrous--the
unintentionally hilarious climax where an armed, remote-controlled toy
helicopter mows down a room full of people.  For all the chases director
George P. Cosmatos packs into the film (which is pretty much one long
chase), there's no excitement, no energy.</P>
<P>Cosmatos's biggest mistake, however, comes in the film's most
glaring flaw--the casting.  No offense to Mr. Sheen, but it's quite hard to
buy him as a brilliant presidential assistant whose skill with words is held
solely responsible for the President's reelection.  Not helping matters is
the fact that we get virtually no scenes where he's doing his job; the
casting wouldn't be so hard to swallow if we saw the guy at work.  Hamilton
is a talented actress, but after the indelible impression of her machisma in
T2, she just can no longer be bought as "the girl" in an action film,
regardless of how hard she tries.  But it's not like she tries hard, or at
all, here anyway.  Aside from miscasting, there's typecasting.  Donald
Sutherland plays Sheen's enigmatic mentor at the White House.  Do you think
_he_ could have something to with the conspiracy?  Sutherland as a bad guy?
You think?</P>
<P>After what is sure to be the poor box office performance of Shadow
Conspiracy, folks at Hollywood Pictures will probably wish they had left
this wretched excuse for a thriller collecting dust in the shadows of the
Disney vault.<HR></P>
