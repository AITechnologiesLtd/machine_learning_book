<PRE>                          THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     It is not likely that many people imagine an American President's
life is easy.  Director Rob Reiner has made a most delightful film
about what goes on behind the scenes in running the country, and still
made it a most entertaining movie.  The film not only has humor but it
packs a powerful punch at our Right Wing (with the dastardly Senator
Rumson played by Richard Dreyfuss.)  It also takes on the NRA and those
who would destroy our environment, comes out convincingly in favor of
the ACLU and why free speech is so important. Even media harassment is
covered.  Terrific.</P>
<P>     President Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) is a widower with a
young teenage daughter.   Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening) works for
an environmental group where she is in the forefront of trying to get
their agenda voted on and passed by Congress.  When the President and
accidentally meet, at the White House, Sydney meet, he is, to use an
old but charming word, smitten.  He has got it bad.</P>
<P>     After a series of humorous incidents where she does not believe
the phone calls to her sister's home where she is staying, are really
coming from the White House, they finally get together.  When the
President invites her to a State dinner, the right wing goes into
action to smear him and to find out what they can about her past life.
And when you look, you find.</P>
<P>     As part of the President's staff are Martin Sheen, Michael J Fox,
Anna Deveare Smith, Samantha Mathis, Shawna Waldron and David Paymer.
Great cast, great story, great entertainment.  Oscar, here we come.</P>
