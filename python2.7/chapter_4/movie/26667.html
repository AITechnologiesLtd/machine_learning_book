<P>_The_Little_Vampire_ (PG) ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>"But it's only a kids' movie."  That's the likely response to any
criticisms leveled at _The_Little_Vampire_, a fantasy-adventure-comedy
that is unmistakably made for the younger set--who, I have no doubt in my
mind, will react positively to the film.  Yes, the movie is clean.  Yes,
the movie will hold the tots' attention.  But should that be ample reason
to subject your children to such a shoddy product?  I don't think so.</P>
<P>Jonathan Lipnicki plays Tony Thompson, who along with his mother (Pamela
Gidley) and father (Tommy Hinkley), has just moved from America to the
Scotland countryside.  Tony's problems fitting in at school are made
worse by his recurring dreams about vampires--the reasons for which
become clear one night when he is visited by Rudolph (Rollo Weeks), the
little vampire of the title.  The two quickly become best friends, and
soon Tony finds himself helping Rudolph and his family--father Frederick
(Richard E. Grant), mother Frida (Alice Krige), sister Anna (Anna
Popplewell), and older brother Gregory (Dean Cook)--locate the missing
piece of an amulet that could grant them their greatest wish: to become
human again.</P>
<P>Sounds all nice and cute, which it probably was in Angela
Sommer-Bodenburg's original novels.  But something has been lost in the
translation.  While the effects, photography, and costuming (though
Rudolph is made to look like a miniature member of the '80s band a-ha)
are decent,  Karey Kirkpatrick and Larry Wilson's script has a fair share
of irritating plot holes (just exactly why is Tony able to have psychic
visions?), and the comic sequences are rendered annoying by director Uli
Edel's (yes, the same Uli Edel who last directed the 1993 Madonna
fuckfest _Body_of_Evidence_) heavy hand.  Case in point: a subplot
involving a weirdo vampire hunter (Jim Carter).</P>
<P>What proves most ruinous, however, are the performances that range from
phoned-in to barely-there.  The central performance falls in the latter
category.  Four years after stealing scenes in the not-for-kids
_Jerry_Maguire_, the now-10-year-old Lipnicki is given his first starring
vehicle with _Vampire_, and the moppet proves far from up to the task. 
Adult actors certainly can't coast by on cuteness alone, and that goes
tenfold for child stars, whose smiles and giggles can get really annoying
really quickly.  The case of the bespectacled Lipnicki is even worse, for
his cuteness factor is rapidly diminishing; now that the size of his body
is about caught up with that of his head, there's nothing distinctively
"cute" about him.  One's left to focus on whatever acting ability is
there, and between his robotic line readings and stone face--which, it
seems, can only be smiling or sullen--one would be hard-pressed to find
any.</P>
<P>One would also have difficulty finding much of anything in
_The_Little_Vampire_ that will appeal beyond the target kid audience. 
For some parents, that will be enough, but shouldn't a so-called "family
film" truly have something of worth to offer to everyone of every age?</P>
