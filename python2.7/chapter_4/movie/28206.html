<PRE>THE MILLION DOLLAR HOTEL
Reviewed on April 10th, 2001
By Jerry Saravia</PRE>
<P>"The Million Dollar Hotel" is the kind of film that is suffused with 
fantastic imagery, splendid cinematography, offbeat atmosphere and frankly, 
little else. it's a film to feast the eyes but not the heart. Plainly put, 
Wim Wenders' new film flies off of the handle so often you wonder if it will 
ever sit to ponder. It never does. </P>
<P>Based on a story idea by good old Bono, "The Million Dollar Hotel" is set in 
the year 2001 in L.A., focusing on a fleabag hotel called The Million Dollar 
Hotel (the site of Bono's music video "Where The Streets Have No Name.") 
Apparently, a peculiar hotel guest named Izzy Goldkiss (Tim Roth) jumped off 
the roof of the hotel, but could he have been murdered or did he commit 
suicide? That is what an unlikable FBI agent (Mel Gibson) is out to discover, 
and not with the help of these hotel misfits. The most notable is a 
slow-witted, naive punk (Jeremy Davies) who is in love with a woman (Milla 
Jovovich) who claims she is not real - she is fiction, a nobody. </P>
<P>And that may be the problem with "Million Dollar Hotel" overall. These 
characters are shallow misfits with no interesting personalities or 
remarkable insights. Actors such as Jimmy Smits, Gloria Stuart and Peter 
Stormare (as a supposedly fifth Beatle) run through the screen without making 
much of an impression. It is like watching a wax museum of fuzzy, anonymous 
portraits with no pulse. However, it is nice to see Stuart cussing up a storm 
with the film's one memorable line: "We are all f***ed up!" </P>
<P>What saves the film somewhat is the tender love story between Davies and 
Jovovich, though it does become tedious after a while. I also liked Mad Mel 
who is far more restrained than usual, resembling the Frankenstein monster 
with scars in his back and a neck brace. The slow pacing and long takes are 
often breathtaking (sometimes recalling Wenders' own "Wings of Desire.") The 
songs by Bono are pointed and haunting, and the film does fascinate. It just 
doesn't involve us.  </P>
