<PRE>The Stupids (1996) 94m</PRE>
<P>This silly comedy by John Landis could have been created for the screen 
without any reference to the children's storybooks by Harry Allard and James 
Marshall, but I suppose a copyrighted title like 'The Stupids' was too good 
to pass up.  The film utilizes the stories' characters and their pets 
(computer-animated in the style of Marshall's illustrations) but the plot is 
far trickier than their simple adventures in print.  What's great about THE 
STUPIDS is that its storyline is made of the flimsiest of ideas, thrown 
together with such abandon that you'll probably think scriptwriter Brent 
Forrester made the whole thing up as he went along.  Without giving away the 
gag that sets the story into motion, Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) believes 
there is foul play at work in his neighborhood.  After launching his own 
investigation he concludes that he has discovered a dastardly scheme of 
global proportions.  His wife and two children, who are just as oblivious to 
the real world as he is, don't need much convincing.  Living up to their 
family name, all four of them embark on a series of misadventures, which, of 
course, ends up with them unraveling a genuine conspiracy playing out right 
under their noses.</P>
<P>The humor of THE STUPIDS is a lot smarter than its title suggests, although 
like many comedies it resorts to slapstick for the finale.  The film's 
highlight has Arnold explaining his conspiracy theory to the rest of the 
family while we see it being played out for us in his mind (Christopher Lee 
is a hilarious asset to this scene).  It perfectly encapsulates both the 
world the Stupids live in and the rationale of the script, which derives its 
humor from the way that Stanley and his family create bizarre hypotheses to 
explain the most ordinary of day-to-day situations.  Clearly, the children 
have been brought up with the same insulated logic as their parents - they 
too misinterpret the most basic of encounters.  This allows the characters 
to interact in different combinations without having any one smarter family 
member offsetting the balance - for example, Father and Daughter believe 
they have died because the lights have suddenly been turned off (this is 
taken from the original stories); Mother and Son figure out that an elevator 
must be a time machine; Brother and Sister are convinced that their parents 
are being held for ransom in a Chinese restaurant; Mom and her children try 
to use a computer and blow up the office; Mom rushes into a wig shop to get 
a disguise and emerges covered entirely in wigs; and of course the family's 
patron, Stanley, creates mayhem wherever he goes on his crusade to save the 
world (he also gets to sing a hilariously complicated song about his family 
tree).</P>
<P>THE STUPIDS was generally slammed by critics and didn't do as well as other 
films by Landis, which is a shame as it has a goofy, easy-going charm that 
is absent in many of his later films.  One likely reason for its failure is 
that the public had had enough of Tom Arnold's tabloid-grabbing antics with 
former wife Roseanne Barr.  But I think Arnold, happily traipsing about in 
his powder-blue suit and straw hat, is a good choice for Stanley Stupid.  
Bigger comedy stars would have no doubt stamped their own brand of 
personality over the top of the character - they would have certainly 
outshone the rest of the family, whose parts are conspicuously underplayed.  
I have to assume that this flat acting style was a conscious choice of 
Landis, who didn't want his cast to mug it up.  Landis fans will also be 
quick to spot his trademark 'See You Next Wednesday' message incorporated 
into the film, a sight gag he uses to show that he has included material 
from an unused screenplay he once wrote as a teenager.  His other trademark 
- using fellow directors in cameos - is a little harder to spot, unless you 
really know your film-makers.  Film buffs may recognize Robert Wise as 
Stanley's neighbor.  Wise/Stupid.  Do you think that's another Landis 
in-joke?  Look for the re-named London Symphony Orchestra in the final 
credits.</P>
