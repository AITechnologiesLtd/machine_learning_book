<PRE>                         BABE: PIG IN THE CITY
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The second BABE film is more creative
          than the first, but it is also darker in tone.  We
          are back in the world where animals talk to each
          other, but never to humans.  Babe is taken to the
          big city in an attempt to save Hoggett farm.  But
          Babe gets separated and has adventures with a whole
          menagerie of animals.  The art direction of this
          film is almost as big a feature as the animal
          animatronics, but it may be confusing for younger
          children.  Still, parents will find that they will
          have to go a long way to find a film so enjoyable
          both adults and for children.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10),
          high +1 (-4 to +4).  A minor spoiler follows the
          review.</PRE>
<P>     The second Babe film, BABE: PIG IN THE CITY, had plenty of room to
repeat what was good about the 1995 BABE. Co-writer and director George
Miller really did not need to change the film's approach.  But Miller
was not content to rest on his laurels.  The sequel is quite a
different film and gives the audience much that is new and quite
different to enjoy.  Is it as good as the first film?  To my mind it is
not quite as good.  The story is a little less a coherent story and the
big climax of the film is more slapstick and less subtle excitement.
Like BABE this is family entertainment, but I think it offers a little
less for the children and perhaps a little less for the adults also.
The tone is definitely darker and more disturbing.  But like BABE,
BABE: PIG IN THE CITY is probably the best family film of its year.
And it is one of the rare family films that may well be better
appreciated by adults than by children.</P>
<P>     The Hoggett Farm is certainly having its ups and it downs.  After
a series of adventures related in the first film Babe has won
international fame as the pig who is a sheep dog.  Things are going
well until Farmer Hoggett is disabled in a freak accident.  (Note: the
scenario of this accident was a joke told as early as the Fred Allen
radio program in the 1940s and has appeared other places since.  It may
even be older than that. But to the best of my knowledge, this is the
first time anybody filmed this strange sequence of events.) With Mr.
Hoggett unable to care for his farm it falls on hard times and the bank
is ready and anxious to make the times even harder.  Mrs. Hoggett takes
the famous pig to display him at a fair.  But events conspire to maroon
Mrs. Hoggett in the city with her pig and then to leave her pig all
alone.  Babe finds himself the new animal in a house full of animals
with dubious human supervision.  Among the animals Babe meets is a
Damon-Runyan-esque pit bull, a family of chimpanzees, and a taciturn
orangutan.</P>
<P>     The film is told in the same style as the first Babe film but
differently.  Again the story is divided in chapters whose titles are
read to us by the trio of singing mice.  The Classical and popular
music is back including the theme from Saint-Saens's Third Symphony.
Miller has managed to get the same cast back, though James Cromwell has
a much more limited role as Farmer Hoggett and Magda Szubanski has a
much larger role this time continuing as Mrs. Hoggett.  Again the
comedy is genuinely funny and sometimes very funny.  The acting and
voicing seems to have all the same people in the same roles.  The major
characters are all present, even if their roles are much foreshortened.
And as with the first film, the animals are frequently three-
dimensional characters with interesting personalities.  But the city
Babe visits is not so much a city as a Disneyland-modified city-
concentrate.  It seems like a Frankensteinian grafting together of many
of the great cities of the world.  Looking out a window, Babe sees
landmarks of cities all over the world.  The interior of the city is an
expressionist wonderworld looking like something out of Disneyland.
While the first film had some physical comedy, this new film has a long
slapstick sequence that seems out of character for the person involved.</P>
<P>     This is more expensive and a cut below its predecessor, but it
still is a good outing for the whole family.  I give this film a 6 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     Spoiler... Spoiler... Spoiler... Spoiler... Spoiler... Spoiler...</P>
<P>     Like ANIMAL FARM, BABE: PIG IN THE CITY may have many allegorical
meanings and perhaps even religious overtones.  Babe wins over his
enemies with kindness and feeds his flock, but then allows an enforcer
to stand over feeding and no animal is allowed to partake of the food
without thanking Babe, under apparent threat of violence.  What begins
looking like an allegorical Christ turns into more a Huey Long
allegory.</P>
