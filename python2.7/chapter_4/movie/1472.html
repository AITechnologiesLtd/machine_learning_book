<PRE>                             DEATH BECOMES HER
                       A film review by Eric Walker
                        Copyright 1992 Eric Walker</PRE>
<P>     I remember reading a short story about the Fountain of Youth back
in high school; the story's title was something like "The Strange
Experiment Of Professor Heidigger."  It was the story of a group of old
men (and one woman) who had wasted their lives in frivolous pursuits,
and they come to the Professor seeking a second chance.  He gives them
the Fountain of Youth, and they become young and beautiful once again--
but have they learned their lesson?  Heck, no; within a few minutes
they're at each other's throats, engaging in the petty squabbles amd
making the same mistakes they made the first time around.</P>
<P>     This is the moral of DEATH BECOMES HER, a supernatural black
comedy from today's number-one slapstick Hollywood director, Robert
Zemeckis.  It doesn't matter how old or how beautiful you are--it's
what you are on the inside that counts.  We've heard this message
before, of course.  Supposedly, it's taught to us from day one, though
in truth the idea of "beauty" is forced upon us by our very society,
which believes that in order to be beautiful you have to be young and
thin.  Grow old and fat, and forget it--you're history.</P>
<P>     The movie revolves around Meryl Streep, playing the character of
Madeleine Ashton.  She's an aging stage star, but she refuses to admit
it: she is absolutely, completely obsessed with being young and
beautiful.  She applies enough makeup to herself to keep the whole
cosmetics industry rolling in dough; she makes weekly trips to her
plastic surgeon; and she still sees young men in order to promote the
illusion that she's still young and beautiful.  Of course, all of her
efforts to stop aging are futile.</P>
<P>     Goldie Hawn, meanwhile, is Helen Sharp, who has an obsession of her
own.  All her life, Madeleine Ashton has been stealing her boyfriends
from her, and the last straw happens in 1978, when Maddy seduces and
marries Ernest Menville, her fiance (played by Bruce Willis).  This last
one leaves Helen's life in shambles, to the point where she will do
anything for revenge.</P>
<P>     Cut to 1992.  Madeleine is growing old fast, and Ernest is reduced
to a drunken mortician who interns Hollywood corpses.  Maddy's life is
at a dead end--until she attends a party thrown by Helen, and sees that
her rival has mysteriously remained young and beautiful.  She has her
revenge, it seems--and Maddy is willing to sell her soul to be young
again.</P>
<P>     Here's where DEATH BECOMES HER takes off.  Maddy meets an
incarnation of the Devil himself, played with relish (and without much
to wear) by Isabella Rossellini.  She gives Maddy a potion that will let
her live forever--*if* she takes good care of her body.</P>
<P>     And so the stage is set.  The two ladies begin fighting again like
two cats on a fence, with poor Ernest caught in the middle.  I don't
want to spoil the comic moments (of which there are many), so let it
suffice to say that this battle royale is a special effects
extravaganza, where some scenes will make your eyes gape and you'll
wonder "How'd he *do* that?"</P>
<P>     Robert Zemeckis truly has a gift for comedy.  Of the movies he's
directed so far, his masterpiece was 1988's WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT."
It's easy to see why: Zemeckis has the heart of a cartoon director.  He
can do slapstick in the style of the great comedians of old (and in the
style of the Warner Bros. cartoons, too), and his sight gags and visual
comedy style is superb.  The special effects and the slapstick are where
the laughs come from in DEATH BECOMES HER: this is a live-action
cartoon.</P>
<P>     And here lies the movie's greatest fault: like a cartoon, there's
nothing underneath the gags and the laughs.  There's nothing *wrong*
with the story, and the plot holds together quite well.  Meryl Streep's
performance is great, as she threatens to go over the top into comic
farce but in fact remains firmly in control; Goldie Hawn easily holds
her own and balances the movie nicely.  Bruce Willis' role is good, if
unexceptional.  But the lessons and the "theme" of the movie (vanity
will be your undoing) are laid out in the first five minutes of the
film, and after that you can effectively shut off your brain and just
laugh at the sight gags.  This is a very funny movie--it's just not very
"deep."</P>
<P>     DEATH BECOMES HER is good summer fare--despite its morbid subject,
it's actually a very light-hearted comedy.  It's better than most of the
other big-budget movies to come out in 1992; there are no real flaws to
spoil the audience's entertainment.  Go see it; you'll get lots of
laughs.</P>
<P>     Just don't bother *thinking* about the movie afterwards.</P>
