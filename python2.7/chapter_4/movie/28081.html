<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a muddled human interest/comedy story about the travails of a
large Polish-American family living in a Detroit suburb (which looked
like the small Illinois hometown of the director, because that's where
it was filmed). It's an old-fashioned type of film, that has the main
characters talking in phony Polish accents and throwing out schmaltzy
dialogue at will, as it suffers so much from being poorly scripted. In
one ponderous scene, Lena Olin as Jadzia Pzoniak, a Polish-American
cleaning woman, tells her not-so-secret office boss lover Roman (Rade
Serbedzija): "There was a reason for marrying my husband, but I can't
remember what it is." There must have been a reason why neophyte
director/writer Theresa Connelly made this film into a nostalgia story
that wants to look like it was made in the 1950s, I just wish she
included that reason as part of the storytelling and dropped all those
clichés to explain every situation. In the realm of movies that try so
hard to please its audience, this one almost begs for audience approval,
but the only thing that should please the crowd is the sex appeal of the
beautiful looking ensemble cast.</P>
<P>In a low-income Detroit suburb, a hard working, easy-going baker, Bolek
(Gabriel Byrne), and his sexy wife Jadzia, live with their children,
four obedient sons and one strong-willed, attractive teenage daughter,
Hala (Claire Danes), along with a daughter-in-law and a grandchild who
is always crying, in two adjoining cramped single-family houses.</P>
<P>Mother and daughter are supposed to be mirror images of each other, each
with questionable values but a love for children. Mother sneaks out one
night a week pretending she's going to a meeting of the Polish Ladies'
Auxiliary, instead she goes to Roman, which is hard to understand why,
since there was no heat on screen between them.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Hala sneaks out nightly through a basement window, and on one
of these outings is attracted by the young neighborhood policeman
Russell (Adam Trese), which soon leads to her pregnancy. The unrealistic
plot in this basically plotless film, is about how the family rallies
around her condition and the middle-aged matriarch marches her sons over
to Russell's house to force him to marry Hala. Jadzia is proud that she
married Bolek when she was 15 and pregnant, and she sees nothing wrong
with her daughter's pregnancy. In fact she loves children and wants more
grandchildren. In a moment of deep reflection, Jadzia says, "making life
and love" are her "religion." I'm sure there could have been some comedy
over this, but the film was so flat, it couldn't draw out the comedy or
any worthwhile observation about this zany situation. The situation
becomes even messier when Hala is chosen to impersonate the virgin in an
annual church procession and fails to tell the priest that she's no
longer a virgin.</P>
<P>To give the film a decidedly Polish flavor, the domineering mother is
shown as an excellent ethnic cook, making her own homemade pierogi,
duck's blood soup and keeping a cellar full of homemade pickles. It was
supposed to be a film of small moments and the farce was supposed to be
endearing, showing how a large, functioning ethnic family can struggle
with each other; but, in the end everything will turn out to be just
peachy, which will include a Polish wedding after all the obstacles to
the marriage are pushed aside. It didn't work for me, I got no warm and
fuzzy feeling for this working-class family. It was a film of many
vignettes, all coming together with the themes of family values, sex,
and religion, but none of the themes is brought to any fruition where it
could register with any credibility.</P>
