<PRE>                                PRIMAL FEAR
                       A film review by Scott Marcus
                        Copyright 1996 Scott Marcus</PRE>

Grade: B+</P>
<P>Richard Gere is not one of my favorite actors. However, I like
courtroom dramas, and this film looked good enough to take a chance
on. I wasn't disappointed. It wasn't a great film, but it was
interesting, and took several unexpected turns. One thing: what's with
the title? Not only is it extremely forgettable, it doesn't really
have much to do with the film, as far as I could determine. In the
long run, it will probably hurt the film, as people won't be able to
think of or remember it.</P>
<P>Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a grandiose defense attorney. He loves
the money and the fame that go along with defending (successfully)
rich scum, such as mafia men and drug-dealers. Once he sees that the
accused killer of a prominent Chicago Archbishop is a baby-faced alter
boy, he wants in on the case, presumably for the press he'll get. We
soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover, Janet
Venable (Laura Linney). Vail himself is a former prosecutor, and quit
because of tensions between himself and the District Attorney, played
very well by John Mahoney (Frasier's father on the TV series).</P>
<P>There is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie: people have
public faces, and private faces. We see this in the murdered
archbishop, in the accused, and, most strongly, defense attorney
Martin Vail.</P>
<P>Richard Gere does a fairly good job. At first, he appears to be a
money- and attention-grabbing lawyer, with no consideration of the
truth. But we see another side, as he becomes a seeker of justice, and
comes to believe in his client.</P>
<P>Alfre Woodard, as the judge, is capable, though somewhat wasted in a
standard role. Laura Linney also does journeyman work; nothing
spectacular, but acceptable. Her relationship with Vail is believable;
their verbal fencing adds to the film. The actor who playes Vail's
investigator (unfortunately, I don't remember his name) is quite good.
His female assistant (she looked very familiar, but I can't remember
where I've seen her) was also capable, but unspectacular. The best
performance in the film was by Edward Norton.  He was excellent, as
the timid altar-boy turned alleged "Butcher Boy of St. Mike's".</P>
<P>I was impressed by the depth of the plot; there are red-herrings, and
dead-ends, that in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending. I
liked the plot twists the film took, and most of the supporting
characters, thus I give PRIMAL FEAR a respectable B+ rating.</P>
