<PRE>                           MURDER AT 1600 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
       2 :-( :-(  for a rather ordinary corpse in the White House</PRE>
<P>Cast: Wesley Snipes, Diane Lane, Dennis Miller, Daniel Benzali, Alan
Alda, Ronny Cox Director: Dwight Little Screenplay: Wayne Beach & David
Hodgin</P>
<P>A dead body in the bathroom makes a smelly, blood stained mess on the
floor. The mystery gets a little more baffling when the homicide takes
place in the White House. The victim is a blonde, Caucasian female in
her mid twenties who has had the honour of sleeping with Uncle Sam and
the dishonour of also sleeping with his son. Such is the shroud of
secrecy and hidden motives behind this slaying, that blame or suspicion
falls on anyone having come in contact with the woman, including the
janitor. The scene opens with the victim having gratuitous sex on the
president's desk, before moments later being bludgeoned to death in a
toilet cubicle. This is probably not the most sordid deal to have passed
over the polished wood of this most distinguished table, but it does
bring to mind that candid question - how many presidents have used this
table for recreational purposes other than political?</P>
<P>Wesley Snipes has reprised his role as a tough guy, no-nonsense homicide
officer assigned to uncover the layers of truth submerged beneath
thicker layers of lies. Teamed with Diane Lane posing as an Olympic
sharp shooter turned White House Secret Service Agent, together they
strip away the thick coats of mystery to find the President at the
bottom of the cake. This otherwise non-inspirational thriller has its
moment of pure silliness when we witness a game of ‘murder in the dark'
in a maze of secret tunnels beneath the White House. The evil navy seal
is about to break Snipes neck in a death grip. Lane points her gun and
finds her mark between the Seal's eyes and should perhaps win the award
for best sharp shooting in the dark. If finding a target was this easy,
give me a blind fold, put an apple on your head and I promise I won't
miss.</P>
<P>This is the fifth tale involving the American President this year and
takes a rather ordinary fourth place behind the more thrilling AIR FORCE
ONE, the more corrupt ABSOLUTE POWER, and the more light hearted MY
FELLOW AMERICANS. When access to 1600 gets as easy as opening a couple
of metal grates, and roaming a few underground tunnels, I find it
surprising that nobody has tried to blow the Institution away with some
home made explosive. As for the excitement over a dead body in the White
House, well people die every day.</P>
