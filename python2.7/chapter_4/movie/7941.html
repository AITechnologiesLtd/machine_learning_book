<PRE>                              LA PROMESSE
                       A film review by Jun Yan
                        Copyright 1997 Jun Yan</PRE>
<P>        In some way this very little publicized (at least here in the
States) Belgian film reminded me of an American film a couple of years ago
named "Fresh."  They both follow a boy's journey through a world that's
falling apart and in which they grow up too fast.  </P>
<P>        As the film opens, it makes no secret that our central character
Igor, about 14 years old, is a ruthless little thief.  It also explains to
us why -- he lives with his father Roger, a scumbag in the business of
smuggling illegal immigrants into Europe.  In Igor's world, all the adults
are thugs, low-lives who lie, steal, rob, cheat, betray and bribe whenever
necessary.  Morality is merely inexistent.  One cannot help blending in
with his world.         </P>
<P>        Assita and her baby are newly arrival from Bugina Faso, Africa to
unite with her husband, who work illegally in Belgium for minimal income,
live in the dumpester apartment provided by the blood-sucking Roger.  Soon
there is a hardly detectable affection developing between Igor and Assita.
One day in a frentic rush to escape the inspection from the Labor
Department, Assita's husband fell from the building while working for
Roger and bled to death because Roger refuses to take him to a hospital.
Before he dies, Assita's husband asks Igor to take care of his wife and
baby.  Igor makes the promise, thus the title.  </P>
<P>        The promise, it turns out, is not so easy to carry out.  Assita
grows more suspicious everyday about disappeared husband.  Roger tries
every way possible to cover up his track and forbid Igor's attempt to help
her.  As conscience begins to awaken within Igor, conflicts with his
father becomes inevitable.  The film makes it clear that it's hard to do
the right thing and it doesn't get any easier as you try to carry it on.  </P>
<P>        When Roger finally decides to get rid of Assita by selling her
into prostitution, Igor faces the ultimate choice: to do the right thing
and split with his only family in the world, or to stand aside and salvage
his relationship with his father.  Keep in mind that he is still merely a
child with a heavy moral burden on his heart.  Meanwhile, the deceived
Assita is still pressing the burning question "Where is my husband?"  </P>
<P>        The film is about how morality and conscience emerges in a young
mind that has never been exposed to such concept.  The uncompromising
script makes the situation every bit difficult as it could be for our
young man Igor.  Roger, the disgusting scumbag is also the only person in
the world that cares about him and vice versa.  From the obvious
affection, sometimes shown in his own way, we suspect Roger needs Igor
even more badly than his son's need for him, for Igor is the only human
connection he has and the only one he does not have to use and deceive.  
The relationship between this pair of father and son is peculiar as well
as familiar to us, which makes Igor's dilemma feel closer to the
audience. </P>
<P>        Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne brought their years of experience in 
documentary filmmaking into this dramatic story.  The dialogues are cut
to a minimum as well as the display of emotions.  Every actor except
Jeremie Renier was given very little close shots to their faces.  Even the
extremely intense final confrontation is handled in a flat, almost
monotonous manner.  Soon I felt I was putting myself in the characters'
positions and empathize with them.  The motivations, conflicts, choices
and feelings are so real, almost as real as the dirty slum and the illegal
immigrants living in it.  </P>
<P>        Renier is required to carry this film on his slim shoulders.  With
the camera constantly staring at his face, he has to walk the fine line
between over-acting and being obscurity.  There is nothing in his
performance that struck me as unnatural; and we feel the pain with him as
he torn between his conscience and father, the dark secret he cannot tell
and Assita's trusting face.  As usual, it is harder to hold back than to
be over-the-top.  Oliver Gourmet is absolutely the most realistic rogue
who is uncompromisingly repulsive from his appearance to his actions, yet
never a simplistic villain.  A good villain makes the audience feel
threatened and intimidated, because he is real (I said "he" because a
realistic female villain has yet to come to my mind) and reminds us of the
ones we meet and know in real life.  Without the verbal showdown, Roger in
some way resembles Dwight Yokam's Doyle in "Sling Blade" because they feel
"real."  Even though his muttering and frozen expression are the other end
of the spectrum, I feel the same chill as I had watching Doyle.  Assita
Ouedrago, who already made 3 films in her country Bugina Faso, was not
given enough close attention from the directors to dig her role, but I
just love the conviction she displays when she slaughters a chicken and
reads her husband's whereabout from the chicken's gut.  Everyone else
looks like they are dragged right from the streets.  </P>
<P>        As Assita, holding her baby, and Igor wandering through the cold,
dark streets, it feels like a world sinking and falling.  In a time more 
sociatal decay  is blamed on juvenile delinquents and harsher punishments
are demanded on younger criminals, the film questions how children can
develop sense of morality, conscience, and value in a corrupt world like
this.  It's also one person's inner journey of struggling to do the right 
thing, however hard it is.  It is nail-biting drama as well as a slice of 
true life.  I give it a B+.  Well done. </P>
