<P>        There are some smart ideas and pleasant performances in ``Hav
Plenty,'' an attempt at a modern screwball comedy involving several
affluent African-Americans, and it's easy to admire writer Christopher
Scott Cherot's ambitions - especially after such recent low-brow
turkeys as ``Ride'' and ``I Got The Hook-Up.''</P>
<P>  But though its heart is in the right place, ``Plenty''
doesn't quite click. Perhaps in the end Cherot spread himself a bit
too thin: In addition to authoring the screenplay, he also produced,
directed, edited and starred in his movie.</P>
<P>  It's his performance as homeless young writer Lee Plenty
that handicaps the picture most severely, since, in order for the
story to work, we must believe Lee is a charmer who proves to be prime
date-bait for the women he meets. Though Cherot dons a threadbare
sweater and tattered jeans to look suitably down-at-the-heels, the
charisma the part requires eludes him.  He tries to make up for this
lack of sparkle by playing cute - blowing bubbles in his juice with a
straw, affecting a hangdog look, making little asides to the audience
- and few things are less attractive than adults trying to be
adorable.</P>
<P>  In form, ``Plenty'' is vaguely similar to director Paul
Mazursky's fondly remembered ``Down and Out In Beverly Hills.'' Lee,
living in his car since he lost his lease on a New York apartment,
accepts a last-minute invitation from sophisticated friend Havilland
Savage (Chenoa Maxwell) to spend New Year's Eve at her family's home
in Washington. Once in the house, Lee is practically attacked by
Havilland's lusty pal Caroline (Tammi Katherine Jones), Havilland's
unhappily married sister Leigh (Robbine Lee) and, finally, by
Havilland herself.</P>
<P>  The ladies just can't resist ... the discreet charm of the
destitute?  Whatever allure Lee possesses, it's not on-screen. Sex and
nudity are also conspicuous in their absence, sort of a surprise in a
movie of this type.</P>
<P>  Cherot's direction is more assured than his acting, and he
gets generally strong performances from his cast. Lee and Maxwell make
strong impressions, generating a sisterly friction that feels
true-to-life, and Hill Harper appears to be having some serious fun as
a Puff Daddy-ish musical impressario.</P>
<P>  If the cinematography by Kerwin De Vonish is sometimes a bit
on the fuzzy side, it's worth noting that ``Hav Plenty'' was made for
only $65,000, a pittance by Hollywood standards. Even so, Cherot
managed to attract Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edwards to supply a seductive
soundtrack, including a Babyface/Des'ree cover of Bruce Springsteen's
``Fire'' that undoubtedly will burn up the charts this summer.</P>
