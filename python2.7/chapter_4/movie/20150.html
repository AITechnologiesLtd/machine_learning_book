<PRE>Sunset Boulevard (1950)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 62</PRE>
<P>"Sunset Boulevard" is one of Billy Wilder's
most commercially successful and highly praised
films.  Nominated for eleven Academy Awards,
including all the major ones, the film later
was adapted into a long-running musical by
Andrew Lloyd Webber.</P>
<P>"Sunset Boulevard" has a great story.  A hack
screenwriter (William Holden), bitter and broke,
is hired by an imperious has-been actress from
the silent era (Gloria Swanson).  Much younger
than her, he becomes her kept man, living at
her luxurious estate with her devoted, humorless
manservant (Erich Von Stroheim).</P>
<P>Norma Desmond (Swanson) has written a dreadful
screenplay, which she believes will launch her
comeback as an actress.  But her handpicked director,
Cecil B. De Mille, continues to gently put her
off.  As the gap between her aspirations and
reality widens, Desmond loses her sanity.</P>
<P>Some consider "Sunset Boulevard" to be a black
comedy.  But it is too gloomy and pessimistic
to be anything but a drama, with Swanson playing
her role for tragedy rather than campy laughs.
von Stroheim may have considered his role as
a servant to be humiliating, but it is a sizeable
role and his character is the most sympathetic.
It is odd seeing Jack Webb, later typecast as
robotlike Joe Friday, playing the film's liveliest
character.  Silent film star Buster Keaton has a
cameo, ironically without any lines.</P>
<P>"Sunset Boulevard" opens by giving away the ending:
Holden is shown floating dead in a swimming pool.
This adds tension to the film, knowing that the
Holden-Swanson 'romance' has a tragic end.  Still,
and this is only my opinion, I feel that "Sunset
Boulevard" is overrated.  Holden's character is
so misanthropic and ill-humored that it seems
unlikely that Desmond would fall for him, much
less perky Nancy Olson.  People seem all too willing
to accept the character of Norma Desmond, as if
middle-aged women are indeed prone to becoming
imperious, conceited, desperate lunatics.  Most
disappointing for me is the film's somber, pessimistic
tone, which seems to be more a condemnation of human
relationships than a commentary about Hollywood.</P>
