<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Plays that become movies usually have a different feel than normal pictures. 
Few rise above the play on film point, and most often those who see it 
onstage like it the best. The strange Parker Posey comedy The House of Yes 
comes to mind when thinking of the unsatisfactory play to film movie cooked 
up by several independent studios. The Big Kahuna is the same in lots of 
ways. It takes away any chance for visual originality and instead puts the 
movie on the shoulders of the actors. Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, and Peter 
Facinelli brilliantly play the main characters. Add Roger Rueff’s smart 
adaptation of his play to the mixture. The result is a comedy turned drama 
that asks serious questions and forces the audience to think. It never dips 
below the satisfactory mark.</P>
<P>Larry (Kevin Spacey), Phil (Danny DeVito), and Bob (Peter Facinelli) 
represent an industrial lubricant sales company. They are attending a 
convention in a Kansas hotel. Larry is an individual who is not afraid to be 
frank when talking to people. He often voices his opinion loudly and says 
what’s on his mind. Phil is an alcoholic who is starting to lose interest in 
the lubricant business. He is Larry’s best friend and acts in a middle child 
way. He rarely participates in Larry’s oral sparring matches and tries to 
promote peace with himself and others. Bob is a young, devout Baptist whose 
religious and traditional ways clash with Larry’s beliefs. All three are 
hoping to catch the grand kahuna. A deal with a company so big, it would put 
their tiny business on the map. As the search for the kahuna goes on, the 
characters begin to search inside themselves for answers to their confusion 
about life, mortality, and the heavens.</P>
<P>It may take place almost entirely in a hospitality suite, but The Big Kahuna 
is never boring or familiar. Things are constantly changing for the trio and 
the script moves around as well. What starts as a wickedly sharp comedy ends 
as a solemn and meaningful drama. There is not as much tension as the recent 
one room drama Deterrence, and in the end that is a better thing. The film 
always moves along in a relaxed and comfortable way. Kevin Spacey is 
marvelous as fast-talking Larry. His performance reminds one that he is not 
only a great leading man, but a creative character actor as well. Danny 
DeVito makes a wonderful recovery from Drowning Mona and Screwed. His 
redemption here gives hope for his next movies. Peter Facinelli is excellent 
as well. While he has been bad in bad movies (like Can’t Hardly Wait or 
Supernova) he shows the excellent promise here that he exhibited in Dancer, 
Texas Pop. 81. When the actors work together, they create a fantastic 
chemistry unseen in recent movies.</P>
<P>The questions asked and advice given from character to character is 
unparalleled. Among the subjects examined are life, death, fidelity, and God. 
Everything has such an air of truth to it. A character will handle and often 
defend their position when met with a judgement of himself in a real way. 
Nothing ever feels fake, and the depth that’s reached is astonishing.</P>
<P>This is a verbal movie of conflicting views. Despite being a tad slow near 
its end, it is always interesting and perfectly fits its short running time. 
The acting is superb, and the script well written. The Big Kahuna should be a 
pleasing surprise for adults. It has the rare qualities of being smart, 
poignant, and reality based. This is a true wonder indeed.</P>
