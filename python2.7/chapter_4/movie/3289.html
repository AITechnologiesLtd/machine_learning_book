<PRE>                                  CHINA MOON
                       A film review by David Wong Shee
                        Copyright 1995 David Wong Shee</PRE>
<P>     CHINA MOON is an important recent production in the tradition
known as film noir--the cinematic manifestation of the Marlowe style
detective novel.  CHINA MOON reanimates the set piece stereotypes of
the detective story, rendering the classical motifs of the genre
flawlessly: a woman in distress who may or may not be a femme fatale;
the hard bitten homicide detective; bar room conversations rich in
seduction, mystery and promise; and the nesting of conspiracies within
conspiracies, of games within games like that metaphorical set of
Russian Dolls.  These conspiracies are notably as much those of chance,
accident and misfortune as they are of conspiracies of human design and
intention.</P>
<P>     The most striking thing about this movie was the
uncharacteristically touching portrayal of the relationship which
develops between detective Kyle Bodine (Ed Harris) and the beleaguered
Rachael Monro (Madeleine Stowe).  This greatly sharpens the tragic
elements of the story through to the final climactic scene which
unfolds in a style not unlike the closing scene of Hamlet.  Similarly,
in a Shakespearean mode, Rachael exhibited several qualities
reminiscent of Lady Macbeth.</P>
<P>     In general CHINA MOON achieves a accuracy of detail in the
emotional landscape that was well above your average melodrama.  In
particular, the state of mind that might lead a battered woman in an
abusive relationship to seek retribution instead of simple escape the
situation were for me convincingly illustrated.</P>
<P>     The element of film noir not strongly represented in CHINA MOON is
that of a burnt out cynicism toward life and love.  This is in spite of
it's pain staking depiction of the destruction of a "good man" through
the influence of perverse motives such as greed, envy and revenge
operating in those closest to him.</P>
<P>   I will leave the finding of fault in this film to others.  My view is 
that this is a MUST SEE for devotees of film noir.</P>

<PRE>POSTSCRIPT</PRE>
<P>     Which is worse do you think, taking the movies too seriously, or
taking life too seriously?  What do people think the popularity of film
noir says about the way late Twentieth Century people see themselves
and their destiny?</P>
