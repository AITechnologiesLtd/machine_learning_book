<PRE>                               CHAIN REACTION
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1996 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Rachel Weisz, Fred Ward, Kevin
Dunn, Brian Cox.
Screenplay:  J. F. Lawton, Michael Bortman.
Director:  Andrew Davis.</P>
<P>     Most of the time, it is fairly easy for me to put my finger on why a
film didn't work for me:  sloppy performances, inane writing, lackluster
production, leaden direction, what have you.  Then there are cases like
CHAIN REACTION.  There is nothing aggressively unwatchable about this new
action thriller, no glaring stupidity; even Keanu Reeves didn't make me
want to run screaming for the parking lot.  Yet I left the theater not
just unimpressed, but unsatisfied, as though I had just left a restaurant
without getting a bite to eat.  CHAIN REACTION may be one of the most
generic film experiences I have ever had, a chain of events without a
single speck of personality.</P>
<P>     Reeves plays Eddie Kasalivich, a machinist at the University of
Chicago working on a project to create a clean, limitless fuel source from
water, funded by a foundation headed by Paul Shannon (Morgan Freeman).
One night, Eddie stumbles onto the final piece of the puzzle, and a new
era seems right around the corner.  That is before one scientist on the
project is killed, another disappears, and an explosion at the research
facility levels several city blocks.  Suddenly, Eddie finds himself
suspected of espionage along with physicist Lily Sinclair (Rachel Weisz),
and the two take off on the run from the FBI.  Of course, the Feds prove
to be the least of their worries, as other parties seem eager to get their
hands on Eddie and Lily first, and Paul appears to be the only person they
can trust.</P>
<P>     It would be easy enough to pick on CHAIN REACTION for its obviousness
-- if you aren't aware that the government and oil companies would
conspire to bury alternative fuel sources, you clearly haven't been doing
your street-corner-leaflet reading -- but obviousness tends not to be
terribly troublesome to most genre film viewers.  No, the real problem is
that CHAIN REACTION traffics in a kind of monotonous obviousness.  We know
our hero is going to be in for a series of chases until he ultimately
proves his innocence, and that everyone is suspect except the spunky love
interest.  Those chases are fairly flat, however, and even paranoia
becomes mundane in CHAIN REACTION.  Director Andrew Davis appears content
to do a remake of his own THE FUGITIVE, with a wrongly-accused man,
traitorous colleagues and a hard-nosed but ultimately sympathetic law
enforcement agent (Fred Ward as the lead FBI investigator).  I suppose you
can't blame Davis for returning to familiar territory after the dismal
STEAL BIG, STEAL LITTLE, but the familiar in this case has left him wholly
uninspired.</P>
<P>     I think there is also a rather important lesson which Davis failed to
take away from THE FUGITIVE, namely that for a plot of that kind to work,
it is fairly important for the hero to be someone you want to root for.
Harrison Ford's Richard Kimble may not have had a complex history, but at
least you knew he had a history.  Eddie and Lily aren't even stock
characters in the service of this plot...they're non-characters.  The
script by J. F. Lawton and Michael Bortman gives us exactly one piece of
information about Eddie (he once blew up a lab by accident) and exactly
one piece of information about Lily (she's British), and neither one make
an ounce of difference.  One of the reasons CHAIN REACTION feels so dead
is that every person in the film might as well _be_ dead, even the
ordinarily ultra-sinister Brian Cox as a nasty CIA operative.  I was so
desperate for a character with some life that when Eddie announced that he
and Lily were going to hide out with an old friend named Maggie, I said a
silent prayer that she would turn out to be a lovably eccentric scientist.
And she turned out to be Joanna Cassidy playing a bland astronomer.</P>
<P>     I will give CHAIN REACTION credit for casting Keanu Reeves in a role
where he can do little damage.  Eddie probably has two dozen lines in the
whole film, and a quiet Keanu is a tolerable Keanu.  I will also give
credit for casting Morgan Freeman, period.  Even in a torpid piece of
film-making like this, he commands attention, and his speech about the
consequences of this new fuel takes on weight just because it is Freeman
who delivers it.  And I will give credit for a welcome refusal to explain
the pseudo-science which allows the water-fuel to work.  I just wish it
could have generated some energy for this film.  To borrow the over-worked
comparison of action film to amusement park ride, CHAIN REACTION is more
like the kiddie train at a petting zoo.  It just goes around and around
and around...and then stops.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 slow reaction times:  3.</PRE>
