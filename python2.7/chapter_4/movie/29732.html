<PRE>TOGETHER (Tillsammans)
----------------------</PRE>
<P>When Elisabeth's (Lisa Lindgren) husband Rolf (Michael Nyqvist) hits
her for the second time, she bundles up her kids Stefan (Sam Kessel)
and Eva (Emma Samuelsson) and moves into her brother Goran's (Gustaf
Hammarsten, "The Best Intentions") commune.  The wildly divergent commune
members and the people Rolf meets now that he's alone will take each
member of this family on a unique journey that ultimately brings them
all back "Together."</P>
<P>Writer/director Lukas Moodysson ("Show Me Love") creates a warm
comedy about a group of people forced to reconsider preconceived
notions and how only those willing to take a chance on change are able
to make the connections that count in life.  While Moodysson doesn't give
equal weight to all his characters, making his film's structure unbalanced,
his fine cast and true human observations are ultimately what count.</P>
<P>Goran tries to be all things to all people, including his sex-mad girlfriend
Lena (Anja Lundqvist), whose proclamation of and action upon their 'open 
relationship' is slowly driving him mad.  Medical student Lasse (Ola Norell) 
humorously speaks his mind, summing up situations in a no nonsense manner that,</P>
<P>while it may sting, is always on target.  His ex-wife Anna (Jessica Liedberg)
embraces meditation, hairy armpits and lesbianism, while homosexual 
Klas (Shanti Roney) yearns for nothing more than to be a housewife for Lasse.
Erik, (Olle Sarri) a strident member of the Communist, Marxist, Leninist, 
Revolutionary League, argues that his welding job keeps him from 'rotting
at university.'  Signe (Cecilia Frode) and Sigvard (Lars Frode) are hippies
who reject meat and materialism.</P>
<P>When Elisabeth and her kids arrive from the bourgeois world (just as Lasse's
dropped his pants in protest of Anna's bottomless kitchen attire!), everything
shifts.  Anna immediately sets her sights on Elisabeth, loosening her up
and strengthening her resolve to stay away from Rolf.  The kids suffer
until Stefan connects with Tet (Axel Zuber), Lasse and Anna's Vietnam War
named son, over forbidden Legos, war games and 'playing Pinochet' and Eva 
begins a tentative romance with Fredrik (Henrik Lundstrom), the equally 
four-eyed outcast son of next door's disapproving neighbors Margit (Therese 
Brunnander) and Ragnar (Claes Hartelius).  Meanwhile, after a disastrous 
evening with his kids which ends with him drunk in prison, Rolf quits the booze</P>
<P>and strikes up a friendship with lonely widower Birger (Sten Ljunggren), who 
urges him to woo back his wife.</P>
<P>Moodysson's nostalgic look back at 1975 Stockholm of 'ugly clothes and
bad music' proves that styles may change, but people pretty much stay
the same.  His gradual reconfiguration of the Tillsammans household is
canny and uplifting and his cast are uniformly excellent.  Except for
its small imbalances (the action shifts away from the household for too
long a stretch, Signe and Sigvard exist only to leave in protest), the
film's lone drawback is the amateurish cinematography by Ulf Brantas
("Show Me Love").  Brantas zooms and pans like someone with their first
videocamera, although editors Michal Leszczylowski and Fredrik Abrahamsen
make the most with the footage they have.</P>
<P>"Together" is a life-affirming comedy.</P>
