<P> Just after the climactic moment in "Dancing At Lughnasa," the five
Mundy sisters stand facing one another, breathless and yet strangely
invigorated. They look at each other in silence, perhaps sensing for the
first time how much they need each other. Or maybe on a subconscious
level they each know it's only a matter of time before their way of life
comes to an end.
 "Lughnasa," adapted from Brian Friel's acclaimed play, so beautifully
captures the details of its time and place and its characters' lives
that it's difficult to resist being drawn in. Director Pat O'Connor did
a similarly fine job evoking 1950s Irish life in the lovely sleeper
"Circle of Friends," and here he recreates 1936 Ireland, specifically
rural Donegal, where the Mundys live quietly on a tiny farm that has
probably seen better days.
 The same can be said for most of the women. Self-righteous
schoolteacher Kate (Meryl Streep) rules the roost, ordering her siblings
around like servants. Her sole delight seems to come from seeing others
take a fall: "Her dancing days will be over," she smirks, when a snooty
former student is forced into marriage. Clownish Maggie (Kathy Burke)
does what she can to inject a little levity into the house. Quiet Agnes
(Brid Brennan) looks after the mentally challenged Rose (Sophie
Thompson); the youngest sister Christina (Catherine McCormack) looks
after her eight-year-old son Michael (Darrell Johnston), the result of
her affair with a devil-may-care Welshman named Gerry (Rhys Ifans), who
drops by every 18 months or so.
 None of the sisters have had much luck with love or money; their only
luxuries are a bicycle and a wireless set that occasionally picks up a
bit of music. When brother Jack (Michael Gambon) returns to Donegal
after doing missionary work in Uganda and announces he thinks he's come
home to die, Maggie gasps, "Jesus, don't! We can't afford to bury you."
 Jack's reappearance is just the first harbinger of changes for the
Mundys. He went to Africa as a Catholic priest but has since become
obsessed with the rituals and practices of the natives, much to the
dismay of Kate. Instead of saying Mass at the local church, Jack would
rather investigate the celebrations of the pagan Feast of Lughnasa, in
which drunken participants leap over bonfires and dance.
 Dancing becomes a recurring motif in the film as the only way the women
can escape the drudgery of their day-to-day routines. Small wonder Kate
and Agnes look on with just a touch of jealousy as Gerry waltzes with
Christina; the only thing better than dancing is dancing with someone
else.
 With very little in the way of plot, "Lughnasa" must rely on character
development for its drama. In lesser hands, Kate might have come off as
a stern, humorless old maid, but instead we can see how much she really
cares about keeping her family together and holding on to their home. As
expected, Streep's accent is flawless but what's even more impressive is
how she brings out Kate's hidden colors, which this woman has cloaked in
multiple layers of acid and ice.
 Burke's buoyant Maggie, McCormack's tolerant Christina and Brennan's
timid Agnes also reveal unexpected personality traits as "Lughnasa"
progresses. The screenplay falters only in a slightly melodramatic
episode involving Rose's infatuation with an unsuitable man; that
O'Connor intercuts scenes of a fox raiding a henhouse into this sequence
doesn't help matters.
 "Lughnasa" is much more effective at showing how the Mundys manage to
survive their many disputes and differences and find some peaceful
common ground. Like most families, they're often so busy worrying about
the future that they don't realize how happy they should be. They may
not be wealthy or blessed with much in the way of material possessions,
but the women of "Lughnasa" prove that sisterhood can truly be powerful.</P>
