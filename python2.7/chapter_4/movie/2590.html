<PRE>                               THE CROW
                       A review by The Phantom
                           (<A HREF="mailto:sbb@panix.com">sbb@panix.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>     All the ingredients were there--that's for sure.  Friday night
in Times Square, sitting in a just-this-side-of-sleazy movie theater
among the kind of audience that can really make a picture like this.
We had KFC on the right, and--not to put too blunt a point on it--a
certain controlled substance on the left.  And the movie itself?  Well,
what more could one ask for than Brandon Lee coming back from the dead
to settle and old score in the most violent way possible?</P>
<P>     And yet it didn't take too long for the Phantom to realize that
things were not going as planned.  He should have been having a great
time watching THE CROW--reveling in the soundtrack, the slick
cinematography, the timeless theme of revenge, revenge, and more
revenge.  But instead he (and the rest of the audience) was growing
increasingly restless; it seemed for a while that the entire auditorium
was in perfect psychic sync: all of a sudden, 400 perfect strangers
found that their expectations were not being met.</P>
<P>     It took a while for the Phantom to figure out why he wasn't
enjoying THE CROW as much as he expected to, but somewhere between the
opening narration (always a worrisome sign in a genre picture; after
all, what could possibly be unclear about someone returning from the
grave to seek vengeance on those who put him there?); the fourth camera
swoop through the miniature Gotham that is its setting; and the tenth
bucketful of rain that comes close on the heels of at least a thousand
more, it became clear.  Too much style, and not nearly enough attention
to what makes a good genre picture good.</P>
<P>     People are often fooled into believing that action, horror, or
exploitation films are easy to make, but they're not.  Though they may
not require inspired writing, acting, or plotting, genre pictures do
require solid direction, if only to make up for the lack of nearly
everything but a straight-ahead story and good special effects.  Steven
Spielberg--who is responsible for four of the best genre pictures of
our time (DUEL, JAWS, POLTERGEIST, and most recently JURASSIC PARK) --
knows this, which is why his latest blockbuster opens not with
ponderous narration by a precocious, death-culture waif, but with
someone being eaten by a dinosaur run amok.  Consider what happens
during the first 10 minutes of DIE HARD or LETHAL WEAPON, and you'll
understand why John McTiernan and Richard Donner are among the best at
what they do.</P>
<P>     Straight-ahead action, horror, or revenge is best accomplished
without a lot of window dressing, but although THE CROW is a genre
picture to the core, so much time and energy are spent making it look
alternately like BATMAN, BLADE RUNNER and any of a number of "stylish"
videos on MTV that it's sometimes hard to tell. Although Miramax and
Dimension would very much like you to believe that THE CROW is a
mainstream film, it's not.  Not even close.  For underneath the by now
familiar urban dystopia setting; the death culture gloss; the trendy
soundtrack filled with retailer-friendly cuts by industrial/alternative
bands; Brandon Lee himself, who until his untimely death as a result of
a stunt mishap always seemed to be on the brink of major mainstream
success--underneath all of this lies the cold-blooded heart of a
sleazy revenge flick.  Take all the window dressing away (and there may
perhaps be more window dressing than window in THE CROW) and you're
left with THE EXTERMINATOR.  And much as the Phantom enjoys a good
revenge flick, he knows full well that very few other people do --
crows or no crows.</P>
<P>     Too, revenge flicks need to be carefully crafted.  THE
EXTERMINATOR, like DEATH WISH before it, succeeds where many pretenders
fail, by placing the audience in the position of an average man who
suffers a terrible wrong and does what he must to put things right
(which always means taking revenge; after all, no one in his right mind
is going to pony up $7.50 to see 90 minutes of personal injury
litigation).  James Glickenhaus has some feeling for this particular
cinematic niche, and his exceedingly seedy film works precisely because
it is so completely straightforward.  The "everyman" in his film could
be any man in the audience; when he goes about methodically taking his
revenge (and employing some particularly inventive ways of dispatching
the bad guys), we're with him precisely because he is so completely
two-dimensional.  To put it another way, THE EXTERMINATOR succeeds as a
revenge flick in large part because it is *not* stylishly filmed;
because it *isn't* raining all the time; and because no one crawls out
of a grave and dresses himself up as a mime with a very bad attitude.</P>
<P>     Well, maybe not a mime, but Lee does go to some lengths to look
like the lead singer of The Cure (or, come to think of it, of The Black
Crowes, which seems appropriate).  It's not every corpse that enjoys
access to water-proof theatrical makeup, but hey, that's this film's
schtick.  That and the crow who serves as Robin (so to speak) to Lee's
Batman--it is the source of his superhuman powers as well as an
early-warning system that lets Lee see things from a bird's eye view.
All of this is fine and well; perhaps a little much for a movie about a
guy who finds and kills the bad guys who seriously aggrieved him, but
it's workable.  What is less workable is all the window dressing that
the filmmakers obviously felt compelled to pile on top of such a slight
plot.  Had THE CROW stuck to basics, it might have worked better than
it does.  But then it wouldn't be THE CROW; nor would it any longer be
based on the successful comic book character of the same name.</P>
<P>     But style (and exposition) in a comic book don't obscure action,
whereas on the screen that's all they can do.  The Phantom presumes
that a lengthy preparation for The Crow's return from the grave works
reasonably well in a comic book; on the screen, however, it seems like
nothing more than the worst kind of wheel-spinning.  The idea that a
crow guides souls from the land of the living to the land of the dead
(and sometimes back again when they have some unfinished business to
take care of) is not one that requires a lot of explanation, and yet
explanation is all we get for the first 10 minutes of the film.  Even
after Lee crawls out of the grave, it seems like we endure another 10
minutes of pointless flashbacks before the film finally gets into
gear.  Perhaps only the Phantom believes that THE CROW might be a lot
more enjoyable had Lee simply climbed out of the grave and killed
someone in the first 10 minutes; instead we get an overwhelming amount
of exposition, narration, and ultimately frustration as the filmmakers
succumb to the worst case of Enterprise-itis since STAR TREK: THE
MOTION PICTURE.  Do the obvious miniatures that comprise THE CROW's
obvious tribute to BLADE RUNNER and BATMAN's Gotham look good?  Yes, at
first.  The very first time the camera swoops through the city streets,
over rooftops and down alleyways, it looks pretty good.  The second
time it looks a little less good.  The third time the Phantom started
worrying that the filmmakers might have even more miniatures in store
for him--perhaps the camera would swoop through miniature cow
pastures and past miniature 7-11's, around miniature farm animals and
miniature Big Gulps.  After the third time, the Phantom lost count, but
suffice it to say that the budget did not permit any more interesting
swoops--THE CROW sticks loyally to the three-square-block radius of
miniatures it can afford.  By the last swoop, it seemed to the Phantom
that the filmmakers needed only a jolly king, a trolley, and Mr. Rogers
dressed in black to complete the transformation from urban dystopia to
Evil Land of Make Believe.</P>
<P>     Putting aside a setting which even the characters themselves feel
compelled to comment on (says the annoying little girl who --
incredibly--serves as the only character with which we can identify:
"It can't rain all the time, can it?"  "Not all the time," answers
Lee.  "I'm sure it will," replied a waterlogged Phantom who at that
point in the film had thoughts of a warm and dry bed dancing in his
head), there's the cinematography, which is--without trying very
hard--the absolute worst of every music video cliche of the past few
years.  This is not entirely unexpected--after all, the director Alex
Proyas does quite well for himself directing commercials and music
videos in Australia--and yet it still took the Phantom aback.  What on
earth was all this fancy camera work doing in an action film?  Didn't
anyone associated with the production realize that action sequences
cannot be shot as if they were music videos or Diet Pepsi commercials?
Or that music videos can support the kind of jumpy, hyper-stylish
camera work that so plagues THE CROW precisely because they are not
required to maintain any sort of coherent narrative flow?  Strobe
lights, incessant rain, a camera that can't stop jumping around--this
is not the formula for a successful film of any kind, let alone an
action film.  After all, what good is a fight sequence if you can't
tell where anyone is, what they're doing, or who they're shooting at?
As coldly stylish as BLADE RUNNER was, at least Ridley Scott knew
enough to leave the camera in one place long enough for his audience to
get a feeling for where they were and what was going on.  Proyas lets
his cinematographer Dariusz Wolski (who is actually quite talented when
someone keeps him from going over the music video edge) run hog wild,
and the film suffers for it.</P>
<P>     The real problem with THE CROW, however, would exist even had the
entire picture been shot sans MTV fireworks.  The real problem is with
Lee's character, a small-time rock star who finds himself crawling out
of his own grave one evening because his great love for his fiancee has
prevented his soul from resting.  Assuming that the filmmakers wanted
to play this for straight horror, it would have worked almost as is.
But they don't--they want us to identify with Lee and so pile on
flashback after flashback showing Lee and his fiancee acting as if they
were in a extra-long Levis commercial: smiling, hugging each other,
having goofy stove-related accidents while making dinner ("We'll eat
out" declares Lee as his fiancee sets fire to a pot), lighting candles,
making love. This goes on and on, all throughout the film, and to what
purpose the Phantom cannot imagine. Because all the flashbacks do
nothing more than expose the paradox at the heart of THE CROW: if Lee
is such a wonderful, sweet-hearted guy, what on earth is he doing
dispatching the four people who killed him and raped and killed his
fiancee a year before?  And in ways gruesome enough to give even James
Glickenhaus pause?  If he's so nice, what is he doing stabbing a pawn
shop dealer in the hand and blowing up his store?  Is this guy THE CROW
or THE PUNISHER?</P>
<P>     Since a movie about an enraged mime with a bird on his shoulder
killing four neighborhood thugs wouldn't be long enough for theatrical
release, the plot is padded with a number of scenes involving Sarah,
the death-culture waif who hung around with Lee and his fiancee before
their untimely deaths.  Sarah exists as another mainstream sop--it
seems that in addition to making him a supernatural, revenge-crazed
killer, the screenplay has also tossed in a caring, tender side for Lee
to juggle.  One moment he's brutally killing a thug; the next he's
helping to reform Sarah's mother by leading her away from a life of
drug addiction and prostitution.  (By the way, the Phantom is fairly
sure that he was not alone in feeling puzzled by the earnest anti-drug
and anti-smoking messages in THE CROW.  Brutal vigilante revenge?
That's fine!  But just say no to anything you might want to inhale.)</P>
<P>     But although the scenes showing Lee's sensitive side do help pad
things out a bit (while making far worse the central paradox of the
film), the screenplay can't stop there.  Instead, in a futile attempt
at BATMAN-ization, the filmmakers throw in scene after scene of Top
Dollar (that's his name, believe it or not), who plays the Mr. Big of
THE CROW's Gotham, acting malevolently.  It seems that Top Dollar and
his henchmen are responsible for all the crime in the city, including
the "Devil's Night" fires that the camera swoops past once or twice
near the beginning of the film.  How is he tied to Lee?  Well, it seems
that he ordered some of his henchmen to clear out an apartment
building, and things got out of hand.  This (very) loose tie enables
the filmmakers to steer the CROW in a more BATMAN-like direction, but
it happens far too late in the proceedings to make much difference.
There's a lot of mumbo-jumbo by Top Dollar's Asian half-sister/lover;
people's eyeballs are bandied about; and meanwhile the audience is left
to wonder why, if Top Dollar is the King of all Bad Guys, he can't get
a decent hair cut.</P>
<P>     As Lee moves toward the final, inevitable confrontation with Top
Dollar, the last of THE CROW's major flaws is revealed to us.  Because
he's back from the dead and out for justice, it seems that Lee cannot
be permanently injured or killed.  If he's shot or stabbed, his wounds
disappear (courtesy of the hard-working folks at Dream Quest) T2-like,
which must have seemed very cool to the filmmakers.  But as it happens,
Lee's superhuman abilities do more to throw THE CROW off track than all
the rain and fancy camera work combined.  After all, if Lee is never in
any danger, what's the fun?  Do people really want to see a film in
which an invincible "good guy" finds and brutally kills four bad guys?
Even as one who loves the genre, the Phantom quickly realized that he,
for one, did not.</P>
<P>     It remains to be seen how well THE CROW will do.  Certainly the
film will benefit from Lee's untimely death and from the publicity
surrounding it and the digital tricks the filmmakers played to continue
shooting without him.  There was something undeniably spooky about
seeing Brandon Lee claw his way out of a grave; but one spooky scene
doesn't pay the rent.  As for the rest of the film, THE CROW is as good
an example as any of how good ideas can go wrong as they're
transplanted from one medium to another, and how--once
again--filmmakers can underestimate the effort and talent needed to
produce a quality genre picture.  THE CROW has all the right elements,
but the mix is all wrong.  And it is truly a shame that in real life
Lee won't be able to come back and do it again--but this time do it
right.</P>
