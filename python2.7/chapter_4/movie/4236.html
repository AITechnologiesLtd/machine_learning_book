<P>     Claude Lelouch's LES MISERABLES is one of the year's motion picture
triumphs:  an epic drama that takes the themes of Victor Hugo's novel
and transplants them to the twentieth century.  Rather than merely re-
telling a story that has previously been brought to life in a variety of
different incarnations (including a hugely popular musical), Lelouch has
chosen to take ideas, plot strings, and themes from the novel and apply
them in a unique and tremendously effective manner to the greatest
tragedy of this century:  World War II and Hitler's Final Solution.</P>
<P>     The film centers around four people whose lives are inextricably
entwined.  They come together, offer redemption and salvation to each
other, then are ripped apart.  The outsider is Henri Fortin (Jean-Paul
Belmondo), a former middleweight boxing champion-turned-truck driver who
has agreed to aid a Jewish family in their flight from Nazi occupied
France to Switzerland.  The refugees are Andre Ziman (Michel Boujenah),
a renowned defense attorney; Elise Ziman (Alessandra Martines), a
premiere ballerina; and their young daughter, Salome (Salome Lelouch).</P>
<P>     As Henri and his charges trundle across the French countryside, the
illiterate driver requests that Andre read to him from Victor Hugo's LES
MISERABLES.  As the story-within-the-story unfolds--complete with
filmed scenes lifted directly from the novel--Henri is enraptured,
seeing parallels in his own life to both LES MISERABLES' Jean Valjean
and Cosette.  Like Valjean after meeting the little chimney sweep, Henri
is determined to devote the rest of his life to the selfless aid of
others.</P>
<P>     The rest of the film follows Henri, Andre, Elise, and Salome as
their paths diverge and converge.  Like a master composer, Lelouch
overlays elements of Hugo's novel on each of their stories.  Those
familiar with LES MISERABLES will immediately recognize the boundless
symbols and references--some subtle, some obvious.  Those who have
never read the book, seen a previous filmed version, or experienced the
musical will not be left floundering, however.  Lelouch re-tells enough
of the original that a person would have to be blind not to see the
interconnections.</P>
<P>     It's difficult to emphasize what Lelouch has accomplished with this
movie.  No film that I'm familiar with has so ably intersected a
classical novel with a modern tale.  It's been tried, most frequently
with Shakespeare, but never has the result been such an unqualified
success.  This version of LES MISERABLES is a masterpiece precisely
because it doesn't merely regurgitate Hugo's tale.  It's something
simultaneously new and timeless.</P>
<P>     Above all, LES MISERABLES is a story of the indomitable nature of
the human spirit.  Despite the title and its attendant images of misery,
poverty, injustice, and oppression (all of which are present in one form
or another), the movie is a decidedly uplifting experience, because its
concentration is on the power to overcome.  To be sure, there's much
evil in this world, but there's good as well.  For every Gestapo
officer, there's a Henri Fortin or Jean Valjean willing to risk
everything to save a small child.</P>
<P>     Lelouch re-uses actors to underscore the parallels between Hugo's
book and his own story.  In fact, legendary French star Jean-Paul
Belmondo, who turns in one of the best male performances of 1995, takes
on three roles:  Henri, Henri's father, and Valjean.  Numerous other
actors do similar multi-character duty.  Names are also used to form
connections.  For example, Henri attributes the qualities of LES
MISERABLES' Marius to a young man of the same name whom he takes under
his wing.  Then, there are times when clips from a previous, black-and-
white version of LES MISERABLES are artfully intersected with Lelouch's
all-color images.</P>
<P>     Although Belmondo's performance is towering, his co-stars are
exceptional enough not to be reduced to scenery.  Michel Boujenah and
Alessandra Martines are more than capable of holding up their corners of
the story, but the real find is young Salome Lelouch, an impressive
young actress who deserves more exposure in future features.  As in
Nikita Mikhalkov's BURNT BY THE SUN (where the director's granddaughter
had a key role), this is a rare instance when nepotism uncovers an
acting gem.</P>
<P>     One recurring theme throughout LES MISERABLES is that there are
really only two or three stories that continuously repeat themselves
throughout history.  Lelouch uses his creative powers to drive home this
point, mixing not only tales from two different centuries, but carefully
developing similarities between Henri's life and that of his father, who
dies early in the film.  Themes echo and resonate through every minute
of the nearly-three hour picture.  The director is constantly reminding
us that what makes a story great, whatever the medium chosen for its
telling, is that in it we see ourselves and people we know.  Nowhere is
this more true than in LES MISERABLES.  Whether Hugo's, Lelouch's, or
both, you will rarely find a more powerful, cathartic, and ultimately
satisfying narrative to immerse yourself in.</P>
