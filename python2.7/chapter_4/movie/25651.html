<P>"American Pie" alums Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari star in this summer's 
attempt to capitalize on the youth
market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that 
combines generic Hollywood cute
couple-ness and zany comedy. It's about an A+ student (Biggs as "Paul") who 
gets a scholarship to some
college in New York City who sticks out like a sore thumb and falls for Dora 
(Suvari) a ditzy heroin-chic
Goth chick who has no ambition or self-respect whatsoever and allows herself 
to be pushed around just
like "hick-boy" Paul is. </P>
<P>So we've got a fish-out-water formula mixed with meet-cute romantic comedy 
which ideally should make
for a good movie. Unfortunately the atrocious screenplay and boring direction 
by "Clueless" auteur Amy
Heckerling successfully manages to screw up everything about the film. These 
characters are totally
unrealistic and unbelievable - it's as if everyone under age 30 is a stoned 
raver. There's no background or
details to anyone or anything, it's just a bunch of cartoon characters 
running into each other. Not to
mention the story itself which is virtually non-existant and contains so many 
plotholes it's like swiss cheese.
Even the basic editing is bad. </P>
<P>If you're looking for a romantic comedy stay far away from this one because 
it is neither romantic nor
funny. I saw this in a PACKED cinema on opening night and the audience barely 
laughed at all. If you've
seen the commericials you've seen all the "funny" parts (which are all from 
the first five minutes). </P>
