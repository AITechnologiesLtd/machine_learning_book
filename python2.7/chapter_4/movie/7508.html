<PRE>                             GRAY'S ANATOMY
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Spalding Gray is arguably the premier monologist of our time.
Although at his best in a live monologue, his screen adaptations shine
as well.  To most people, sitting through a movie where one guy talks
for an hour and a half sounds like torture.  (Even MY DINNER WITH ANDRE
had two characters to provide variety and for them to bounce thoughts
off of each other.)  Spalding Gray talks a blue streak in his
monologues, weaving tales so mesmerizing that he entrances his
audiences.</P>
<P>     Gray bases his stories on a single theme.  Although he generally
writes his routines himself, in his latest movie, GRAY'S ANATOMY, he
credits his longtime friend Renee Shafransky with helping with the
script.</P>
<P>     Unlike his previous monologue pictures, GRAY'S ANATOMY opens with
someone other than Spalding.  In a series of interviews, filmed in a
grainy black and white, ordinary people tell unordinary stories about
their eyes.  Each has suffered some horrific eye accident but has
miraculously survived.</P>
<P>     This eight minute introduction could easily have people heading
for the exits.  The stories' validity make them all the more hard to
think about.  One woman was tired and mistook Superglue for eye drops.
Another got a one inch sliver of metal from a lathe trapped in his eye.
And you can imagine the possibilities with oven cleaner and fish hooks.
You get the idea.</P>
<P>     Although this portion of the film diverges from the tradition of
featuring Spalding and only Spalding, it effectively sets the stage for
the film's topic -- Spalding's macular pucker.  If you did not cover
pucker in your biology class, don't worry, Spalding quickly turns you
into an expert.</P>
<P>     The fascinating story revolves around Spalding's attempt to save
one of his eyes and to avoid a painful operation by checking into
alternative medicines.  (He grew up as a Christian Scientist so
non-traditional health care comes naturally to him.  He even briefly
consults the leading Christian Science eye expert, who rebuffs him when
Spalding finally admits that he has talked with a medical doctor about
his condition.  Spalding gets lectured that he must choose since
Christian Scientists will not help those who are "duplicitous."  Only
true believers need apply.)</P>
<P>     The best part of the film surrounds the long story of his seeking
to be healed by visiting a Native American sweat lodge with a bunch of
Swedish looking men and women.</P>
<P>     Spalding always manages to find and talk about some of the world's
most interesting human beings, and this film is no exception.  He
relates how he consulted an aging doctor who is the world's most
accomplished dietary ophthalmologist, and maybe the only one.  When
Spalding mimics the doctor's 87 year old receptionist and mother, you
can visualize her as perfectly as if he had a hologram of her.</P>
<P>     Spalding has had small acting parts in thirty traditional films,
but has made only two previous monologue movies.  The first, and most
successful, was SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA, and the second was MONSTER IN A
BOX.  Directors do make a difference.  SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA was
directed by Jonathan Demme (THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and PHILADELPHIA),
and Demme understood and appreciated Spalding's unique talents so he
resisted the urge to embellish the film.</P>
<P>     GRAY'S ANATOMY's director Steven Soderbergh (SEX, LIES, AND
VIDEOTAPE) has no such respect for Spalding.  Soderbergh, lacking
confidence in the audience's intelligence, feels that he must jazz up
the production with cute camera work and bizarre lighting.  Although
Soderbergh's madness does have a purpose -- he wants you to feel what
it is like to lose you eyesight -- it, nevertheless, only serves to be
a tremendous distraction.  I want to see Spalding, not a talking shadow
or a man blurred with harsh backlight.  The cinematography by Elliot
Davis deserves one of those "worst of the year" awards.</P>
<P>     I was fortunate to see Spalding do MONSTER IN A BOX in a lovely
and intimate outdoor setting.  This is the way to experience him.  He
does not need Soderbergh's wizardry.  If you cannot see Spalding Gray
live, then do see his monologue films.  GRAY'S ANATOMY can be
infuriating, but Spalding makes it worthwhile.</P>
<P>     GRAY'S ANATOMY runs just 1:20.  The film is not rated, but would
probably be PG-13 for the brief profanity and sexual references.  It
should be fine for kids say 10 and up.  I would not have missed it, so
I recommend it to you and give it ** 1/2 for a terribly flawed but
intriguing monologue.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
