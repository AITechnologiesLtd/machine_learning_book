<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>"Chicken Run" is the first full-length feature from Nick Park, creator of 
the popular "Wallace And Gromit" series of short films. Like those 
movies, "Chicken Run" is done entirely in the Claymation style of 
animation (albeit far more advanced than those old Rankin-Bass Christmas 
specials from the Sixties that crop up on TV every December), and 
features a primarily British cast and setting. The result is a lovely 
family film, one which is sure to have tremendous appeal for the children 
while keeping the grown-ups quietly amused, as well.</P>
<P>The Tweedy Chicken Farm is home to hundreds of imprisoned chickens. Some, 
like Bunty (Imelda Staunton), RAF veteran Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow) and 
dimwitted Babs (Jane Horrocks) seem to accept their situation. Others, 
like the feisty Ginger (Julia Sawalha from "Absolutely Fabulous") and 
scientific Mac (Lynn Ferguson) are determined to escape. To this end, 
they devise numerous schemes of sometimes mindboggling complexity -- but 
every time, they meet with failure and are nabbed by the oafish Mr Tweedy 
(Tony Haygarth). Observes Ginger, it's not enough that just one or two 
chickens escape -- she wants everyone to be free of the Tweedys.</P>
<P>Then one day, Rocky Rhodes (Mel Gibson), a smooth-talking flying rooster 
from America, lands in the chicken coop with an injured wing. He claims 
he can teach the chickens to fly, igniting Ginger's hopes and dreams one 
more time. But the chickens' mission is given new urgency when 
profit-minded Mrs Tweedy (Miranda Richardson), tired of making 
chickenfeed (excuse the pun) selling eggs, purchases a fearsome new 
pie-making machine. "Chickens go in, pies come out," she declares. 
"Oooh," says Mr Tweedy, "what kind of pies?"</P>
<P>Visually, "Chicken Run" is a treat. It doesn't possess the same kind of 
awe-inspiring cinematography as the summer's previous kid-oriented 
picture, "Dinosaur", but rather allows the viewer to feast upon the 
details of its every frame. There's a lot going on in each scene of 
"Chicken Run", and I was particularly impressed by how so many of the 
Claymation puppets were given distinct mannerisms, like Babs' constant 
knitting. Claymation is a very different, more tactile style of animation 
than hand-drawn or computerised cartoons, giving the events an extra 
layer of reality, no matter how outlandish the goings-on.</P>
<P>This is particularly effective in scenes like one where Rocky and Ginger 
are trapped in the bowels of the pie machine. The dangers are still 
comical but they feel more real, and the entire voyage through the 
contraption is all the more fascinating because of it. Nowhere is this 
more true than in the movie's outstanding climax, a more thrilling and 
inventive ending than most films so far this year. You'll believe a 
chicken can fly... as it were.</P>
<P>The voicework is generally accomplished, particularly amongst the British 
cast: Mel Gibson does a fine job as Rocky, but he's clearly just playing 
a skewed version of his own public image here. The other artistes give 
their characters more personality, and as a result chickens like Ginger 
and Fowler come across as better-rounded individuals. Indeed, the animals 
of "Chicken Run" are by and large more interesting than the humans in most 
other movies this summer! Richardson, meanwhile, finds just the right 
note as the fiendish but not too-exaggerated Mrs Tweedy. And Horrocks is 
perhaps best of all as the simple-minded, put-upon Mr Tweedy, who is the 
only one aware that the chickens are plotting an escape ("The chickens -- 
they've organised!" he protests to his disbelieving wife).</P>
<P>As a comedy, "Chicken Run" is funny, but I suspect children will get more 
laughs out of it than adults. Certainly, I found the movie made me just 
smile more often than outright guffaw. That said, there are definitely 
elements intended for both age groups, and the screenplay by Karey 
Kirkpatrick slips in several references which only the grown-ups will get
-- the chickens meet in Hut 17, for example, a sly reference to the World 
War II internment movie "Stalag 17", starring William Holden. Viewers 
should particularly keep an eye out for the cleverly-named Nick and 
Fetcher (Timothy Spall from "Topsy-Turvy" and Phil Daniels), two rats who 
supply the chickens with merchandise -- for a price. This pair forms a 
hilarious double act, and steal virtually every scene they're in. Be sure 
to stick around for their post-credits conversation.</P>
<P>"Chicken Run" avoids the pitfall of many kids' movies by not being 
particularly preachy or heavy-handed in getting its message across. 
There's a lot of good stuff here, about teamwork and never giving up, but 
Kirkpatrick doesn't belabor the point. He trusts that his audience is 
intelligent enough to figure these things out for themselves; I wish 
other movies had this kind of faith.</P>
<P>Parents will also be glad to learn that, content-wise, "Chicken Run" 
should be suitable for just about any age. There are scenes of suspense 
(like the aforementioned journey through the pie machine), but these are 
tempered with a lot of humor and shouldn't prove notably frightening. 
Even scenes depicting the stark reality of the chicken farm -- a chicken 
who can no longer lay eggs is beheaded and cooked for dinner by the 
Tweedys, for instance -- are handled in a careful manner that gets 
the idea across without being unnecessarily traumatising.</P>
<P>"Chicken Run" is just what the box office needed amongst the tidal wave of 
big-budget summer actions flicks: a good-natured, funny movie that pretty 
much anyone can enjoy. Well-written, well-acted and certainly well-made, 
"Chicken Run" may by the best family movie this year.</P>
