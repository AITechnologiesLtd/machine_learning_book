<PRE>Title: Edward Scissorhands (1990)</PRE>
<P>The story of Frankenstein is probably one of the more known horror tales 
of this century, and the famous Boris Karloff image has certainly 
profligated.  Director Tim Burton's "Edward Scissorhands" takes some of 
the basic elements of this story and provides a whole new spin on it.  </P>
<P>The film, written by Burton as well, is about its title character,
Edward (Johnny Depp) and his hands made of scissors, who is a creation
of an old scientist living in a home in a secluded corner of
civilization.  One day, Edward, who lived alone after the scientist
died, is discovered in that castle by a door-to-door makeup
salesperson (Dianne Wiest)and is taken home by her.  At first he is
accepted and welcomed by the rest of the neighborhod, especially
because of his hedge sculptures and women's haircuts.  However, things
go awry when he is persuaded to break into someone's home, and the
whole town turns against him, with the exception of his new family,
especially thier daughter, Kim (Winona Rider), who has developed
feelings for him.</P>
<P>The most noteable element of this film is the presentation itself- it
comes off as a very simple, storybook-like tale.  First of all, it
actually is a tale being told by an old woman to her grandchild.  The
art direction, which is amazing, effectively uses colors without great
detail on neighborhood houses, while using dark, cold features for
Edward's palce of origin, both of which harken back to, once again, a
storybook-like feel.  This is a gorgoous looking film, as are most of
Tim Burton's works.</P>
<P>But beyond that lies the heart of the story- the ideas of the meaning
of humanity through the quickly changing perspective on Edward of the
townfolk, and Kim's realization of her feelings for him.  The
townspeople are in love with him first- but only as a novelty of
sorts.  After he 's caught breaking into a house, he is seen as
nothing but a terrible monster.  Either way, none of the neighbors
ever really saw him for the person he was beyond a superficial level,
except for Kim.  The power of the story is the combination of the two
elements- the expression of the heart through the feel of the story-
enahnces the power and emotion of the film.  The story this film told
moved me, and did so in an original way.</P>
<P>Aiding this, of course, are the performances of some of the actors.  Johnny 
Depp creates a very moving character in Edward, showing us his shy, 
innocent, childlike ways effectively.  Winona Ryder is also commendable, 
showing first fear, then frustration, then respect, then loveand making the 
transitions without much of a hitch.  Dianne Wiest was charming, in the 
doting, motherly role.  Only real weak link might be Anthony Micheal Hall, 
but I think his "Breakfast Club" identity might have gotten in the way.</P>
<P>These three main elements- the visual style of the film, the story
itself, and the performances, all combine under the master plan of
director Tim Burton to create an effective, moving film- truly a
Frankenstein with a twist.  On a scale of 10, I give this film an 8.</P>
