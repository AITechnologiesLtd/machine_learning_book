<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   Clint Eastwood's latest picture, the death-row drama TRUE CRIME, is a
   carefully deceptive one; given its core elements -- a man condemned to
   die for a murder he denies committing, a stubborn reporter hot on the
   trails of "discrepancies" in the case -- the obvious expectation is
   that of an urgent high-octane mystery thriller, and indeed, we're
   subjected to all the generic trademarks of the film genre: the
   meaningful shots of ticking clocks, the final walk to the death
   chamber, the lingering image of the direct line to the governor.
   Still, under Eastwood's characteristic quiet authority, the film
   distinguishes itself from the pack by being decidedly more of a
   character study than a potboiler, and despite its beat-the-clock
   scenario, the movie seems almost defiantly leisurely-paced.</P>
<P>   The central characters, journeyman newspaper reporter Steve Everett
   (Eastwood) and convicted murderer Frank Beachum (Isiah Washington),
   are introduced in parallel storylines kept so determinedly separated
   that they encounter each other but twice throughout the entire film.
   Nonetheless, there's a certain intimacy created as the picture closely
   observes their minutiae over the span of a fateful 24 hours.</P>
<P>   A somber dread permeates Beachum's narratively familiar storyline,
   which follows the doomed inmate through the hours leading up to his
   scheduled execution.  Convicted for the murder of a pregnant
   convenience store clerk, a hollowed Beachum steadfastly maintains his
   innocence but seems resigned to his fate.  While the scales are tipped
   a bit too far by painting him as a selfless born-again Christian, the
   thread is sufficiently poignant and affecting, and Beachum's final
   farewell scenes with devastated wife Bonnie (Lisa Gay Hamilton) and
   especially his confused little daughter are powerful and moving.</P>
<P>   Meanwhile, upon the untimely demise of a colleague, Everett inherits
   her piece.  Assigned to interview Beachum for the so-called "human
   interest" beat, he's immediately convinced that something's amiss with
   the capital case, and to the protests of the paper's editor-in-chief
   (James Woods) and exasperated city editor (Denis Leary), insistently
   delves into the story.  What follows is largely a routine
   investigatory procedural, as Everett visits the scene of the crime,
   wades through old case files, interviews witnesses and leeringly
   insinuates "But how could you see over the potato chips?"</P>
<P>   All standard fare for the typical clock-is-ticking thriller, to be
   sure, but where TRUE CRIME departs from the formula, and where, I
   suspect, Eastwood's interest truly lies, is with the loving
   construction of wily Everett as a fully-realised three-dimensional
   character with all his flaws and idiosyncracies intact; this is a
   picture whose fascination with character outweighs intrigue with its
   story.  Few have played flawed heroes more regularly than Eastwood,
   and he's in familiar territory as Everett, an aging womanizer and
   recovering alcoholic whose self-destructive behaviour inflicts
   suffering to those around him.  A washout as a husband and a father,
   and with a tendency to get on the bad side with his editors, Everett's
   life is a complete mess, punctuated by an endless series of casual
   (and not especially discreet) infidelities, broken promises and
   familial neglect.  We've seen this sort of character before, but
   rarely in a film which freely diverts from the storyline to indulge in
   illumination his ruefully thoughtless manner so attentively, and never
   in a thriller which gladly stops dead in its tracks to depict our hero
   racing carelessly through the zoo with his young daughter (Eastwood's
   own adorable child, Francesca Fisher-Eastwood) so that he can rid
   himself of her companionship.  While there's an obvious parallel
   between the film's two leading characters -- both of them have special
   relationships with their daughters and are in need of redemption --
   Eastwood makes the point with trademark subtlety.  With a refreshing
   novel-like emphasis on rich characterization, the film's appeal lies
   with observation of Everett's own personal struggles.</P>
<P>   While the film isn't afraid to address ethical issues involving
   capital punishment -- it's a conceptual challenge to develop a film
   where the hero has to rescue a man from death row which remains
   apathetic to the material -- it's not overly concerned with the topic
   either.  While leaning towards an anti-death penalty position, we're
   not browbeaten with rhetoric -- indeed, a surprisingly gentle and
   sympathetic eye is cast on the kindly prison guards and compassionate
   warden, who carry out their duties with stoicism and professionalism.
   If anything, what's vilified in the picture is narcissism; all of the
   dislikeable characters in the film are essentially self-serving, and
   the most unpleasant one reveals himself by the way he attends to his
   coif.</P>
<P>   Eastwood elicits typically solid performances from his ensemble cast,
   particularly from Washington, who turns in a reserved performance
   vastly different from his work as a violent would-be rapist in OUT OF
   SIGHT; he lends Beachum a nobility and dignity that renders his
   momentary emotional lapses especially stirring.  As always, it's great
   fun to watch Woods in action, but his gesticulating and animated
   facial expressions produce an energy level which are at odds with the
   tone of the rest of the film; something more subdued would be in order
   here.</P>
<P>   Loose but never slack, TRUE CRIME feels like a throwback to
   old-fashion filmmaking, before the days when testosterone narrative
   jolts replaced inexorbable accumulation of tension.  Eastwood oversees
   the proceedings with a cool confidence and, being the jazz fan that is
   he, freely riffs the picture with interesting moments which appear
   narratively cryptic but, in their own quiet way, reveal a great deal.
   There's an ostensibly pointless scene of a vagrant pestering female
   pedestrians with lewd behaviour.  In most pictures, the hero would
   knock some sense into the crude lowlife; TRUE CRIME is the sort of
   movie where the hero gives him ten bucks.</P>
