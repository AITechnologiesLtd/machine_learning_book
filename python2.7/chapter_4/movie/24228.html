<PRE>In Brief -- by Zachary McGhee</PRE>
<P>WHERE THE MONEY IS [Kanievska] -- Clever is the only word to describe
the sheer veracity contained in watching Fiorentino, Newman, and, to a
lesser extent, Dermot Mulroney, exchanging a silent -- or verbal, for
that matter -- battle over *everything that Kanievska has set forth. I
mean, it's just so c-o-o-l! I'm sure many of you cynics, who, y'know,
don't know how to enjoy a movie, would say that the characters are
lacking and the plot is a bit ludicrous, which I retort, to all you
naysayers: And? Fiorentino's motivation may be simplistic, and the
ending may seem too neat and tidy (as much as that can be under the
circumstances of a bank heist), but that's how classic movies are made,
right? I mean, when Paul Newman -- now three-quarters of a century old
-- and Linda Fiorentino flirt with the romantic subtext, we really
believe it, and why shouldn't we? It's a movie folks, and Newman is one
darn fine actor. My one criticism: If one is ever to question the power
of music, correct your inverted perception by attending this one: the
score by one Mark Isham (who's work has been so-so for the last five
years) is so horrendous and ultimately distracting -- like something
made for the latest movie-of-the-week, if they still had those -- that
it bumped this one down a notch. B+</P>
