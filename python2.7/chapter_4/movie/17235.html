<PRE>Mercury Rising
A movie by Harold Becker
Mit Bruce Willis, Miko Hughes, Alec Baldwin, Peter Stormare u.a.</PRE>
<P>9 year old autistic Simon (Miko Hughes) loves to solve all kinds of
riddles. But who would suppose that his hobby can put him into mortal
danger. One day, however, his caretaker gives him a riddle magazine
that has one very special riddle - the solution of which is a top
secret telephone number.</P>
<P>The American secret service has developed a new encryption code for
correspondence with their foreign contacts. The code is supposedly
unbreakable for computers, not to mention for the human brain. The
programmers came up with the ultimate test for the code: they hid an
encoded phone number in one of the riddles in a magazine. When the
phone actually rings and a kid is on the other end a torrent of events
is kicked loose that they can no longer control.</P>
<P>Lt. Nicholas Kudrow (Alec Baldwin) immediately gives the order to
silence the kid and his parents once and for all. But Simon manages to
escape the killers. FBI agent Art Jeffries (Bruce Willis) is put in
charge of the case, and a frantic run for the boy's life begins.</P>
<P>Even if this time only one little boy's life is at stake and not the
fate of the Earth as in THE FIFTH ELEMENT or ARMAGEDDON Bruce Willis
is more convincing in his unusual part as involuntary nanny. The
scenes with him and little Simon - very well portrayed by Miko Hughes
- raise this movie slightly above the average. Art Jeffreys differs
from John McClane of DIE HARD fame not only in that he doesn't sport a
bloodstained undershirt, he also is not so excessivly tough and
resorts to pills to calm his strained nerves. The man of steel seems
to have some dents, or what else is to be made of that? He survives a
fall out of a flying helicopter, though. So don't you worry, he's
still invulnerable.</P>
<P>Jeffrey's adversary Kudrow is a very different type. Alec Baldwin is a
good choice for the part. He's the kind of guy who never gets his own
hands dirty and always has his men for the ugly jobs. Not a very
likable guy. You can't help wishing for him to end up a grease spot.
Considering that kids are never seriously harmed in Hollywood flicks
and Bruce Willis always comes out on top you know full well who is
going to be alive when the end credits are start rolling. Minor
characters serve only to add some blood and noise to the action
scenes. As far as suspense is concerned MERCURY RISING is no better
than other movies of the kind.</P>
<P>The one riddle of the movie is Peter Stormare's short appearance, but
you won't need a Cray computer to solve it. I can offer the following
explanations: 1. It was a lifelong dream of his to fight on camera
with Bruce Willis. 2. He had some very urgent bills to pay. 3. After
everybody saw him in Spielberg's THE LOST WORLD he no longer believes
that doing an action movie is bad for his image. His talent was
completely wasted on MERCURY RISING, but the more famous names on the
poster the more people will want to see the movie.</P>
<P>Miko Hughes turns in a great performance as the autistic boy. Apart
from Bruce Willis, who simply does what he always does, Hughes is the
real star of the movie and makes the viewers stick out till the very
predictable ending.</P>
<P>No surprising plot twists or brilliant ideas, but easier to digest
than ARMAGEDDON, where the Last Judgement turned out to be just a
harmless shower of meteorites with a pompous prelude.</P>
