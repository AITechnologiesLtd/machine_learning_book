Eyes Wide Shut  (9/10)</PRE>
<P>14th and 17th September 1999: Cineworld, Bristol </P>
<P>I first heard about Eyes Wide Shut in March 1996. I had been an admirer
of Stanley Kubrick for twenty years, and in that time had only twice
been able to experience a new Kubrick release, so it was good to hear of
a new film starting production. It was nevertheless a bit of a
disappointment that Kubrick's next film would not be his much
anticipated project A.I., but would instead be a drama starring Tom
Cruise and Nicole Kidman.</P>
<P>For three and a half years, the Internet has been awash with speculation
and rumour about the cast and content of Eyes Wide Shut. Cast
replacements and secretive and protracted principal photography fuelled
the gossip, much of it outrageous, and nearly all of it incorrect.
Finally the film itself here, and in the most tragic of circumstances.
This is the last time we will ever see a new film from Stanly Kubrick.
He was a legendary figure - one of the few truly great film makers - and
a much misunderstood man. And now he's gone. </P>
<P>In Eyes Wide Shut, Tom Cruise plays New York doctor Bill Harford and
Nicole Kidman plays his wife Alice. Their marriage seems perfect, but
one night Alice admits to having had sexual fantasies about another man.
Bill is deeply disturbed by this revelation and in his jealousy and
desire for revenge enters a sexual underworld, the heart of which is a
masked ritual orgy that takes place in a country mansion and at which
things turn very dark for Bill and very weird for the viewer. </P>
<P>Is Eyes Wide Shut the fitting end to a great career that some reviewers
have claimed, or the monumental turkey that others have reported? I
think it depends on whether you get Kubrick films or not. Some are put
off by the feeling of cold detachment in many Kubrick films - we often
don't empathise with the characters or feel we are in the presence of
real people, but instead we observe the characters as subjects on a
microsope slide. This clinical formality can either be deeply off-
putting or can be the price you willingly pay for letting Kubrick in to
mess with your head. Personally, I'm willing to go along for the ride.
After first seeing Eyes Wide Shut, I wasn't sure what I thought of it.
Now it's had a chance to bed down a little, and I've seen it again, I
think it is marvellous, but overlong. The film is full of subtleties of
plot and theme that endlessly turn over in the mind. Questions are
raised in the film and apparently answered, but ambiguities remain, and
multiple interpretations are possible. A second viewing raises as many
questions as it answers.</P>
<P>The centrepiece of the film is the masked orgy sequence. From the moment
Bill arrives at the mansion gates to the moment he leaves, this
20-minute sequence is as good as anything Kubrick has ever done. The
interplay of image and music to evoke mystery, eroticism and fear is
spellbinding (although occasionally I had to wonder how satisfactory
oral sex can be when the participants are wearing masks). The American
release of Eyes Wide Shut was altered by placing computer-generated
figures over certain of the more vigorously copulating orgy-goers. This
was done to get the film an 'R' rating, rather than the more appropriate
but commercially difficult 'NC-17' rating. This has become known as the
"Austin Powers" version of Eyes Wide Shut. The digital cover-ups were,
apparently, approved in principle by Kubrick before his death. In the
U.S., hardcore porn is freely available, yet commercial considerations
mean that adults cannot see a serious mainstream film featuring
simulated sex in which no genitals are visible but which includes an
unacceptably vigourous level of thrusting. What a strange country
America is. </P>
<P>The film has an extraordinary visual quality. As he has done before,
Kubrick shot Eyes Wide Shut using low lighting levels. The film was
deliberately underexposed during shooting and overexposed during
developing to compensate. This produces a dream-like washed-out grainy
feel to the image. At times the scene seems alive with an orange glow,
and during some close-ups, the grain is so prominent that the image
seems to shimmer. (On a more practical level, low lighting levels also
means a relatively small crew, so daily rates can be kept low, thereby
allowing longer shooting schedules.) The look of the film is also
influenced by a recurring motif of christmas tree lights and many other
examples of similar tiny lights, such as in shop displays and cafes, and
in curtains of beaded light.</P>
<P>Although there are few of the obvious trademarks, such as dramatic
tracking shots through interior spaces, or the full-face shots of
characters on the edge of insanity, the film still has the distinctive
Kubrick feel. Interiors are framed and lit to provide not just a place
where the action is set, but a psychological location for the
characters. Colours scream out at you with significance. What that
significance is it is hard to say, but perhaps any attempt to put it
into words is to miss the point. Kubrick films work at a deep
subconscious level, creating moods and reactions in the viewer that are
not meant to be explained or understood.</P>
<P>As is usual with Kubrick films, the choice of music is eclectic and
mixes original compositions with existing recordings. The original
pieces are by Jocelyn Pook, whose sombre chamber music is central to
several parts of the film, including the masked orgy sequence. Kubrick
has again made use of the music of avant-garde composer Gyorgy Ligeti.
The use of Ligeti in 2001 was spot on, but the use of his piano music in
Eyes Wide Shut has come in for some criticism. To the untrained ear,
such as mine, it sounds like little more than a child playing individual
notes with little concern for melody or rhythm. Listening to the music
in isolation, it is austere and foreboding, but in the context of the
film, that damned piano music struck me at times as just plain
ridiculous and nearly destroyed what it sought to augment. </P>
<P>Another noteworthy aspect of Kubrick films is the performances he gets
from his actors. Tom Cruise is not an actor that seemed a likely choice
for a Stanley Kubrick film, having neither the emotional intensity of a
star like Jack Nicholson, nor the relative anonymity of the cast of 2001
or Full Metal Jacket. The casting of Cruise is reminiscent of that of
Ryan O'Neal in Barry Lyndon. In defending his casting of O'Neal, Kubrick
said in one of his rare interviews that "the personal qualities of an
actor, as they relate to the role, are almost as important as his
ability". Presumably similar considerations lay behind the casting of
Cruise, who carries the main acting burden, appearing in virtually every
scene. He is nevertheless hamstrung by his narrow range. Nicole Kidman
is generally fine, but even she sometimes seemed to chew the scenery a
bit. The minor roles are the usual collection of Kubrick eccentrics.
None of this is meant to be critical - it's the peculiar nature of the
performances, even those that would be deemed stilted or just plain bad
in other films, that contribute to the disconcerting other-worldly
appeal of Kubrick films. Sydney Pollack's performance as Bill's friend
Ziegler does, however, seem slightly out-of-place, his being the sort of
naturalistic performance we'd expect in a normal film.</P>
<P>The pacing of the film is often painfully slow. Scenes are dragged out
and lines... are... often... delivered... with... great... big...
gaps... between... words. Kubrick has been known to trim slow sequences
after critical test audience reaction (he did it with 2001 and trimmed
the European release of The Shining) and it is interesting to speculate
whether he would have similarly tightened-up Eyes Wide Shut if he had
had the chance. With his death, the film became untouchable. Despite
being half an hour too long, Eyes Wide Shut is the work of a master
whose ambition and vision makes a trip to the movies an experience that
transcends mere entertainment. It is magnificent, but occasionally a
magnificent bore.</P>
