                            BASKET CASE 2
                    A review in the public domain
                                  by
                             The Phantom
                      (<A HREF="mailto:baumgart@esquire.dpw.com">baumgart@esquire.dpw.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>     In his previous review (of NIGHTBREED), the Phantom's lead paragraph was
only slightly less self-referential than this one is, but there he did it only
because he admires style over substance in all things, his own reviews
included.  This review, however, does require the Phantom to discuss some of
the background of BASKET CASE 2, for without it he doesn't know what some of
his phans will make of it.  Certainly if one expects an ordinary "slasher/alien
pops out from behind a headstone/under a staircase and stabs/kills/rips the
limbs off of a hapless teenager just after/just before having sex" horror film,
one will be sorely disappointed.  BASKET CASE 2 may be a lot of things, but
ordinary it is not.  And with that said, please allow the Phantom to discuss a
bit of the film's background so that we may all understand exactly what it is
that he is reviewing.</P>
<P>     In 1982, Frank Henenlotter directed BASKET CASE, a film that in many ways
anticipated Stuart Gordon's later REANIMATOR.  It was a film that was part
horror and part comedy and was done with tongue firmly in cheek.  BASKET CASE
told the story of Siamese twins Duane and Belial (joined at the side), and of
what happens once they're separated.</P>
<P>     Although Duane is of average height and build and looks relatively normal,
his brother Belial stands about 2 feet tall, has arms growing out of the sides
of his head, and has very sharp, pointed teeth.  Actually, he doesn't really
stand at all, since he doesn't have feet in the commonly understood sense of
the word.  So how does he get around?  Well, Duane carries him in a large
wicker basket, which serves the dual purpose of getting Belial around the city
and keeping him hidden from those who might not be as understanding as his
brother.</P>
<P>     Sounds a little out of the ordinary, right?  Phans, Frank Henenlotter has
done some things that would make even Stuart Gordon look away in shame.  This
is the same director who last year brought us BRAIN DAMAGE, an equally bizarre
and offbeat horror/comedy about a man and the parasite who takes control of
him, forcing him to kill innocent people so that he (the parasite) can pop out
and eat their brains.  The parasite looks a bit like a snake with hands and
has, among other things, a marvelous singing voice.  "Offbeat" is clearly
putting it mildly.</P>
<P>     Duane is forcibly separated from his brother by his well-meaning parents
who want only for him to be able to live a normal life, and who think that
having an extra head with arms growing out of his side would at the very least
lessen Duane's chances of getting a date for the prom.  But Belial doesn't want
to be separated from his beloved brother, and neither does Duane, since both
brothers always enjoyed a, shall we say, close relationship, including the
ability to communicate via a form of ESP.  But separated they are, and in
revenge Belial kills the doctors who performed the operation and escapes to New
York City with brother Duane and his wicker basket.</P>
<P>     The Phantom won't give away any more of the original film, but suffice it
to say that things get steadily stranger from there.  You didn't think that was
possible, did you?</P>
<P>     BASKET CASE was notable for being shot on a shoestring budget (the Phantom
thinks it was transferred from 16mm, but he's not sure) and yet not being at
all compromised by a lack of special-effects funds.  It also became an
overnight cult classic in the way that most films become cult classics: by
being very silly, by looking somewhat amateurish, and by being a lot of fun.</P>
<P>     BASKET CASE 2 is, obviously, a sequel to the original.  The story picks up
where the last one left off, with Duane and Belial falling to their (assumed)
deaths from the top floor of a Times Square hotel room.  [Reviewer's note to
his New York City phans: this was before the days of the Marriott Marquis and
other 50-story midtown monstrosities.  Just as well, as no special effects
department in the world could ever design a creature as ugly as the Marquis.]
Do they die?  Well, no spoilers here, phans, but no, they don't.  Surprise!
Just remember, horror personalities never die, they just become Jason-ized, a
process that freezes the characters for a period of one year, or until the
video release of the last episode, whichever comes first.  In this case it just
took a little longer.</P>
<P>     So Duane and Belial are hospitalized, and before long they find themselves
in the home of Granny Ruth, a good-hearted soul whose mission in life is to
give "unique individuals" the privacy and respect they deserve.  By the way,
the Phantom likes that particular euphemism a lot and intends to use it the
next time one of his readers accuses him of holding freakish opinions.  No,
he'll retort, they are *not* freakish.  They're unique.</P>
<P>     Well, Granny has more than just a good heart; she also has an attic full
of what look to be NIGHTBREED extras.  These unique individuals are certainly
unique, but it's a shame that BASKET CASE 2 was released so soon after
NIGHTBREED, since some of the makeup loses its effectiveness that way.  It's
not that the makeup is inferior, it's just that at the moment we horror fans
are suffering from what the Phantom likes to call Jabba-the-Hut syndrome: too
much plot in service of the special effects department (particularly the makeup
department) and not the other way around.</P>
<P>     As expected, things don't stay calm and quiet around Granny's house for
long.  Soon a reporter from the local Enquirer clone ("BABY RAISED BY
HUMMINGBIRDS" reads one of the headlines on the publisher's wall) comes
snooping around, hot on the trail of the fugitive brothers and eager to start
raking in those book, paperback, movie-of-the-week, film, and video residuals.
Aren't we all?</P>
<P>     The Phantom won't go further with his plot synopsis, since the film
proceeds in fairly standard form from there.  So what makes BASKET CASE 2 a cut
above the usual horror fare?  A few things, but most notably the way
Henenlotter handles the age-old story of an individual feeling alone and
freakish, different from everyone else and so isolated from society.  This
film, like its predecessors BASKET CASE and BRAIN DAMAGE has a heart to it --
no matter how absurd things get, at base there's a story that people can relate
to, and it's possible to identify with the characters.  Well, at least Duane,
although there have been those Monday mornings when the Phantom thinks he knows
pretty much how Belial feels as well.</P>
<P>     He also thinks that it would be best if his phans would rent the original
before seeing BASKET CASE 2, since he doesn't believe that they would really
enjoy as much otherwise.  Unlike its predecessor, BASKET CASE 2 is low budget,
but not shoestring budget, and so the unsuspecting might not realize that deep
down it's still a jokey continuation of the original; although the Phantom
greatly enjoyed the film, he doesn't think that it could stand well on its own.
This is true, of course, of many sequels, but the Phantom thinks that it is
especially true of this one -- if you haven't seen the original BASKET CASE,
you might not get all the jokes, and if you don't get all the jokes you won't
enjoy yourself as much as you should.</P>
<P>     But don't be fooled into thinking that BASKET CASE 2 makes no sense on its
own -- it does, and it can certainly be enjoyed apart from the original.
Although the film tends to slow down at points, it is generally well-paced and
-plotted, and the makeup and special effects are used well.  The film's editing
and direction are tight and crisp -- Henenlotter has complete control of this
film from the very beginning, and he has a real flair for making even the most
outrageous of situations seem perfectly plausible.</P>
<P>     One of the most outrageous situations in the film is that of Duane
himself, since he's played by the same actor who portrayed him in the original.
Yet because the sequel begins only moments after the original ends, we're
suddenly confronted with an actor who is obviously in his thirties and who
looks nothing at all like he did when he starred in the original BASKET CASE
eight years ago.  It's a tribute to Henenlotter that Duane's appearance is more
difficult to accept than is Belial's.</P>
<P>     The Phantom was also delighted to see that Frito-Lay products --
especially Doritos -- and Jolt cola are the official snack foods of Duane,
Belial, and other unique individuals.  There are also a lot of Televideo
terminals about, and at times the Phantom actually found himself cringing in
his seat at the thought that someone would -- gasp!  -- use one.  "No!  Lady!
Don't go into that office!  Don't touch that keyboard!"  he found himself
screaming at one point.  The Phantom chalks this up to his own traumatic
experiences with Televideo equipment in his distant past; the reactions of
other viewers may, of course, be different.</P>
<P>     But the Phantom won't hold the blatant product placement against
Henenlotter and the film; after all, one must have some respect for a director
who could convince several major corporations to willingly lend support for a
movie like BASKET CASE 2, which even the Phantom must admit is rather out of
the mainstream.  A long way from Jay Leno to Belial, no?  Suddenly "Crunch all
you want -- we'll make more!" takes on a whole new meaning....</P>
<P>     The sound and music are both above average, and although the
cinematography is fairly standard, there is some interesting and clever camera
work at times.  And surprise of surprises, it ends well.  Imagine, a real
ending -- one that doesn't look like it was an afterthought or a "suggestion"
by the studio.</P>
<P>     What more could one ask for?  The Phantom heartily recommends BASKET CASE
2 -- as in fact he does all of Henenlotter's work -- and thinks that phans who
get in on the joke will enjoy this film more than some of its recent
competition, NIGHTBREED included.</P>
<P>     By the way, for those phans who are now intrigued by Mr. Henenlotter and
are slavering to know more about him, watch for his next film, FRANKENHOOKER,
currently scheduled for spring or summer release.  Previews for this epic were
shown before BASKET CASE 2 (as they're both from Shapiro/Glickenhaus); having
seen the preview and considered the title, the Phantom thinks that Stuart
Gordon is going to have to get cracking, since it appears that Henenlotter has
just upped the ante.</P>
