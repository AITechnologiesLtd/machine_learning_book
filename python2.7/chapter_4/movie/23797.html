<PRE>The Road to El Dorado (2000)</PRE>
<P>The latest fully animated offering from DreamWorks SKG is out just in time 
for spring breaks and spring fever.  THE ROAD TO EL DORADO is beautifully 
drawn, skillfully voiced, and nicely scored.  It is also threadbare of plot, 
save for the final minutes.</P>
<P>The heroes of the film, Tulio (Kevin Kline) and Miguel (Kenneth Branagh) are 
con men who mistakenly stow away on the ship of the very men they have 
swindled.  Their punishment upon being caught?  Well, it is supposed to be 
flogging and lifetime enslavement in the sugar plantations of Cuba (where 
they are headed aboard the ship belonging to none other than the infamous 
Cortez.  But we never see the pair suffer, just as we never witness scenes 
anywhere close to graphic).  So the heroes escape with a sidekick in the 
form of a portly horse named Altivo, and use a map in an attempt to discover 
the legendary city that gives the story its name.</P>
<P>Enter a supporting character, Chel.  She's a temple robber, a lovely though 
sneaky woman who begins to drive a wedge between Miguel and Tulio.  When the 
trio are captured and dragged  into the wondrous city, they commence to 
scheme their way into an escape with all the gold they can carry - a very 
familiar premise.  What complicates their machinations is another case of 
mistaken identity:  the ignorant natives take the white men to be gods, 
resembling an ancient image of a magical pair riding a serpent.  As the 
connivers battle their own greed as well as factions led by rival power 
figures within the tribe, the specter of Cortez stands in the background.</P>
<P>What helps to make the film move along is the characterization provided by 
the voice actors.  By this time Kevin Kline is a veteran animated movie 
star, the male lead of Disney's THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME under his belt.  
Kline lends a quirky panache to Tulio, causing us to like the money-grubbing 
would-be god.  Kenneth Branagh also turns in a solid performance as Miguel, 
even though his voice occasionally takes on the stock heroic tone we heard 
from him in HENRY V.  Both actors supply their own singing voices in the 
only song not sung by Elton John.</P>
<P>Rosie Perez's character is sketched to resemble her, and unfortunately we 
also see a lot of Rosie's head wiggling attitude transplanted to this 
paradise in Central America.  Enough said.  The other voice actors are more 
transparent.  Edward James Olmos plays the obese chief, his voice often 
understated and subtly wise.  As the wily Tzekel-Kan, Armand Assante does 
perhaps the strongest job of the supporting players.  His intonation is 
striking and clear, the hallmarks of all good "baddies."</P>
<P>How is Elton John's singing?  Not as good as Tim Rice's lyrics.  The songs 
do an adequate job of both furthering and decorating the storyline, though I 
would not go out of my way to purchase the soundtrack.  Often catchy and 
multi-layered, the music nevertheless falls short of being memorable.  After 
leaving the theater I could not remember one of the airs to whistle myself.</P>
<P>Its colors lush and vibrant, the animation takes up much of the slack of 
mid-movie.  We observe the greens of the wildly growing jungle, as well as 
the reds and browns of the wondrous city.  Every now and then we come across 
scenery that appears virtually realistic, as in the objects of gold given to 
the fake gods.  On the whole, images of Central American Indian art serve as 
an engaging motif.  Especially striking is a giant, fancifully animated 
green lizard manipulated by the insidious Tzekel-Kan.  Beyond its 
achievements in vivid aquas and reds and teals, the angles of the animated 
"cameras" are average; there are very few visual joyrides like we 
experienced in last summer's Disney offering TARZAN.</P>
<P>THE ROAD TO EL DORADO does not stand up to DreamWorks' previous success, THE 
PRINCE OF EGYPT.  My daughter, a few months short of twelve, commented on 
how much she likes the city - a compliment to the team of animators.  This 
is only one indication in my mind that the story might have been stronger.  
Writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio could have picked up the pace in several 
scenes of building action, but their ending is both picturesque and 
action-filled.  All ages would qualify to enjoy THE ROAD TO EL DORADO - it 
is a diverting buddy movie and a magnificent series of paintings, done by 
both humans and computers.  I don't know that it will end up in our home 
collection of videos, but I am not sorry we took the children to see it.</P>
