<PRE>                        THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS
                       A film review by Greg Bole
                        Copyright 1992 Greg Bole</PRE>
<P>          Mini review: A stunning action picture with a love story
     weaving the epic framework together.  Breath-taking visuals,
     and pulse-racing brutality.  Day-Lewis immersed himself in
     the role with obvious vigor, and his co-stars rise to the
     occasion.  Not absolutely flawless, but vastly impressive.  I
     rate this film with 4 stars out of five.</P>
<P>     Nathaniel Bumppo, the first American hero, also known as Hawkeye,
Deerslayer, Pathfinder...a mythic figure of epic proportions.  The
screenplay by Christopher Crowe, with re-writes by the director Michael
Mann, manages to capture perfectly James Fenimore Cooper's most famous
character.  The considerable acting and vocal talents of Daniel
Day-Lewis were added to create one of the most stirring screen heros of
recent history.</P>
<P>     Hawkeye is an orphaned white raised by a native American,
Chingachgook, as a brother to Uncas ... those two being the "Last" that
the title refers to.  The intensity of Day-Lewis' performance must be
noted.  And was boosted by his noble stone-faced "family."  The role of
his Indian father was filled by activist Russell Means, adding another
link to the current respect paid to issues of native Americans.</P>
<P>     Mann's background in visual-oriented projects such as MIAMI VICE
and MANHUNTER is still very much evident.  The action of the film is
conveyed through many cuts and hand-held shots.  The beauty of North
Carolina's Burke County in the the Blue Ridge mountains stands in for
the headwaters of Lake Huron, and it is a sight to behold.</P>
<P>     The film moves along at a good clip, and has many intense battle
scenes.  The graphic nature of the conflicts serve as important a role
in this film as did the violence in such films as UNFORGIVEN and THE
DEERSLAYER.  (Allusion intentional)  :^)  The frontier is seen as a
brutal place and the combatants are each fighting strong reasons: greed
and survival.  Still a good deal of the bloodiest acts happen out of
the view of the camera, but the results can be shocking.  These were
hardy men that could survive under such conditions.</P>
<P>     Madeleine Stowe seems to have found a choice female role in Cora
Munro, and she gives a touching portrayal of this strong-willed
heroine.  Cora provides the personal focus that involves the viewer in
this sweeping epic.  Steven Waddington is also a wonderful addition as
the noble but close-minded English officer Duncan Heywood.</P>
<P>     There are flaws of logic and editing, but none that can't be
overlooked with a little dramatic license.  The only other problem was
that the story really picks up right in the middle of Hawkeye's life
with little explanation of who he is until later.  Personally I enjoyed
this because he *is* a cipher, especially to Cora, and we get to know
him gradually, thus creating a greater impact.  The plot is also a
little convoluted, but can be followed with the attention that it
demands.</P>
<P>     Excellent use is made of subtitling the language of the Native
Americans, and it adds a very realistic feel.  The bright orange print
is also helpful in making them "viewer friendly."  The obvious detail
paid to costumes, make-up, and props deepens the reality.</P>
<P>     This movie is a real Oscar contender.  Possibly a shoe-in for
costume and make-up.  (But we'll have to wait for DRACULA and 1492 to be
sure.)  And it will definitely garner nominations in both acting and
production areas.  Will Day-Lewis grab his second Best Actor statue?
I would not be in the least disappointed or surprised.</P>
