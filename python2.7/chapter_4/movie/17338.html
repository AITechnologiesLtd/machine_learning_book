<P>Like some pseudo-exotic punch that mixes kiwi juice and strawberry
nectar, "Forces of Nature" combines the terrors of "Twister" and the
comic chaos of "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," tossing in a dash or
two of "It Happened One Night" for good measure.</P>
<P>But though Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck generate a certain amount of
goodwill and director Bronwen Hughes proves she can conjure up a
colorful scene, the comedy - like the airplane its central characters
meet aboard - doesn't quite get off the ground.</P>
<P>What's frustrating about "Forces" is that all the right elements seem
to be in place. The supporting cast (Steve Zahn, Blythe Danner, Maura
Tierney, etc.) is full of familiar faces and the movie is awash in
eye-appealing pastels and impressive computer-animated effects,
including slow-motion rain for the stars to run through. The only
thing missing is a comic spark to set the picture off.</P>
<P>Instead, Marc Lawrence's screenplay follows a familiar path, bringing
seemingly jinxed travelers Ben (Affleck) and Sarah (Bullock) together
on the long, long road from New York City to Savannah, Ga. Ben is
going south for his wedding; Sarah's got personal business to
settle. He's a "blurbmeister" who writes copy for book jackets (he
touts a romance set in Egypt as "a scintillating tale of erotic
mummification"); she's a semi-nutty jill-of-all trades, who claims to
have worked as a salesperson, an exotic dancer and a flight attendant
at various points in her career.</P>
<P>Detours along the way to their destinies include a drug bust, trouble
on a train and a stay in a motel that's even scarier than the ones
Diane Keaton photographed in her classic book "Reservations."
Meanwhile, Ben's bride-to-be Bridget (Tierney) is trying to withstand
the temptations of a good-looking lawyer (David Strickland) who woos
her with off-key renditions of old Phil Collins' hits.</P>
<P>Bullock, with purple highlights in her hair and a clingy wardrobe, can
play these kinds of charmingly ditsy roles in her sleep by
now. Affleck has a slightly tougher row to hoe, since Lawrence's
script doesn't exactly flesh Ben out. There's a sweetness in the way
they bounce lines off each other, but the film doesn't fully explore
the possibilities of either the stars' chemistry or the combination of
genres in its storyline; ultimately, "Forces" is all thunder and no
lightning.</P>
