<P>I feel betrayed by Ken Loach, one of my favorite film-makers. His
"Carla's Song" not only fails as art, it also fails to convey the
political significance of the Nicaraguan revolution, its purported
subject. Since Loach's "Land and Freedom" dealt so trenchantly with
the politics of the Spanish Civil War, it is a major disappointment to
find politics so poorly served in his Nicaragua movie.</P>
<P>The fault is in Paul Laverty's screenplay. He is a Glasgow lawyer who
worked with human rights organizations in Nicaragua in the mid-80s.
This sort of involvement does not necessarily mean that you are going
to dwell on the Nicaraguan people as victims of atrocity.
Unfortunately in Laverty's case this is the singular message he
conveys.</P>
<P>This comes across most clearly in his strategic esthetic decision to
make the sad eponymous Carla the central character of the film. It is
1987 and we find ourselves in bleak, rainy Glasgow. There we discover
Carla (Oyanka Cabezas) on a sidewalk dancing to a boom-box. She begs
for change after her performances. She somehow became detached from a
Nicaraguan dance troupe touring the British Isles and is now barely
functional. She is rescued by George, a completely apolitical bus
driver who soon falls in love with her. He brings this wounded bird
back to a friend who will shelter her in a spare room in his
apartment. Robert Carlyle, who plays George, also played a junkie
construction worker in Loach's great "Riff-Raff," as well as the
psychopath Begby in Danny Boyle's "Trainspotting."</P>
<P>Shortly after taking up residence in her new quarters, Carla cuts her
wrists. After George takes her to the hospital, he discovers from a
doctor that this is her second suicide attempt in six weeks. She is
apparently suffering from post-traumatic stress. As he sits by her
bedside, George can not resist taking a look at her medical record. It
states that a horrible battlefield incident has almost destroyed her
psychologically. This incident not only had a scarring effect on her,
it also had lasting damage on her lover Antonio.</P>
<P>In flashbacks, we see the contras mounting an attack on Antonio, Carla
and a group of young artists and teachers who are traveling by truck
in the northern mountains of Nicaragua. They are part of a literacy
campaign that the contras have targeted. The attack does even worse
damage to Antonio than it does to Carla, but we do not know exactly
what it is. This mystery serves as a central dramatic device in the
movie and it is not a very good one. Since we do not encounter Antonio
as a key player in the drama, it is difficult to have great feelings
about his plight. He is a symbol of Nicaraguan suffering and symbols
work far better in poetry than they do in movies.</P>
<P>Nearly half of the movie deals with the love affair of George and
Carla. They talk about everything but politics. Nicaragua only
functions as a faraway place where something terrible happened to her
and her lover Antonio. What a contrast to "Land and Freedom," where
the two lovers are a Communist and a POUM member, who live for
politics. Carla, the Sandinista militant, does not seem to be much of
a politico herself. Her defense of the revolution amounts to a
statement that the government is trying to help the people and bad
people are trying to stop it.</P>
<P>Laverty has obviously made the decision that middle-class audiences in
the wealthy countries will only swallow the bitter pill of Nicaragua's
suffering if it has a sugar coating: George and Carla's romance. At a
certain point, George decides that their love can never be consummated
as long as she is still uncertain about Antonio's fate. Therefore, he
decides to fly back to Nicaragua with her and search for Antonio.</P>
<P>Thus the second act of the movie commences and it is where things
begin to derail completely. Loach has the look of Nicaragua in 1987
nailed down, but there is not much substance beneath this. Filmed in
Esteli, "Carla's Song," is highly faithful to the period and the
place, as anybody who visited Nicaragua in this period can testify.
The Sandinista soldiers are constantly on the move as they seek out in
the contras in the countryside. The human rights activists bustle
about and convene meetings to come up with documentation on contra
atrocities.</P>
<P>Alas, what is missing is exactly what made Nicaragua memorable, namely
political conviction. For the entire time these characters spend in
Nicaragua, nobody discusses politics. The main topic of conversation
is what has happened to Antonio. The movie is not really that much
about Nicaraguan revolution, as it is the search for a missing person.
George and Carla roam from town to town asking "Have you seen
Antonio?" If Laverty had devoted some energy to the search for the
soul of the Nicaraguan people, then the movie might have been
interesting. Alas, this was beyond him.</P>
<P>In one of the most glaring false notes in the film, we finally
encounter somebody who knows the whereabouts of Antonio. That is
Bradley, played by Scott Glenn, a member of Witness for Peace. Glenn
is a thoroughly unlikable character and one can only wonder how the
human rights veteran Laverty could come up with such an unflattering
portrait. Perhaps some misgivings about the whole tarnished Nicaraguan
experience might have affected Laverty's judgement. We are living in a
period when it is awfully easy to bash the Sandinista cause.</P>
<P>In any case, Bradley seems to have very little interest in politics.
He thrives on gonzo brinksmanship and goes into the most dangerous
parts of the countryside to document contra atrocities. When he sits
down to have a beer with George, he stresses how dangerous it is and
warns him that he might shit in his pants if he gets close to the
shooting. Suffice it to say, that no staff worker with Witness for
Peace ever made macho displays like this. What motivated them was a
religious belief in human rights and a broadly defined sympathy for
Nicaragua's social revolution. We eventually discover that Bradley had
been a CIA operative in Honduras who had become disgusted with what he
was doing and went over to "the other side." This information is
simply revealed by Laverty's screenplay without any dramatic
background into Bradley's character. As such, it comes across as sheer
nonsense.</P>
<P>Someday somebody will make the definitive movie about Nicaragua and
they will not have to rely on specious devices such as a love affair
between one of "us" and the "other." Nicaraguans are capable of
telling their own story. A movie based on Omar Cabezas' memoir "Fire
in the Mountains" could not miss. Cabezas was a guerrilla who gave up
everything to fight against the Somoza dictatorship. When he is not
describing a fire-fight with the enemy, he is reminiscing about all
the things he has left behind and misses desperately: the food, the
drink, the parties, the sex. Since Nicaraguans are some of the most
joyous people on the face of the planet, this part of the story has
added poignancy. It is too bad that Loach chose such a depressing and
inaccurate story, since there are so many better ones available.</P>
