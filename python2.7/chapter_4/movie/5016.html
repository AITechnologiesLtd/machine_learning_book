<PRE>                              THE DREAM TEAM
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        THE DREAM TEAM is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four
loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane.  Billy, played
by Michael Keaton, is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose
short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble.  Christopher
Lloyd portrays Henry, an obsessive-compulsive who requires that everything
be neat, orderly, on schedule, and by the books.  He thinks he's a doctor
so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he
constantly scribbles notes and files reports.  Jack, played by Peter Boyle,
thinks he's Jesus.  And finally, there's Stephen Furst as Albert, a chubby
catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases.</P>
<P>        THE DREAM TEAM follows the misadventures that beset the four-some
when their psychiatrist, Dr. Weitzman, takes them out of the hospital for a
field trip to Yankee Stadium.  During a pit stop, they get separated from
Weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in Manhattan.</P>
<P>        The movie's charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry
between its delightful cast.  The four leads in the film play off each
other quite effectively; they never miss an opportunity to argue, bicker,
or insult one another.  Henry and Jack, for example, fight over who's going
to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game.</P>
<P>        The actors in THE DREAM TEAM have a lot of fun with their
characters and with each other.  Michael Keaton is well cast as Billy; he
gives his cynical character considerable complexity.  As the divinely Jack,
Peter Boyle succeeds in keeping his one-dimensional character funny and
fresh.  Although Stephen Furst's catatonic character is cliched, the actor
makes him sympathetic and endearing.</P>
<P>        While Keaton, Boyle, and Furst are good, it's Christopher Lloyd who
really makes the movie special.  Lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic
performance.  His body language (for example, the way he walks) and his
facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character.
Lloyd's brilliant performance yields a pathetic, moving, and memorable
character.</P>
<P>        THE DREAM TEAM is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you
might expect from its simple premise.  The characters are so appealing that
you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot.</P>
