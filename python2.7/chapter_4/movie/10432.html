<P>     With KUNDUN, director Martin Scorsese has taken a chance.  
Unfortunately, that risk goes no further than the film's casting and 
premise.  What reaches the screen is less a narrative than it is a 
travelogue or a political statement for the re-installation of the Dalai 
Lama in Tibet.  This film is sadly lacking in a number of important 
areas:  passion, energy, and drama, to name a few.  And, while KUNDUN 
boasts impressive cinematography (by Roger Deakins) and an effective 
score (by Philip Glass), the images and music aren't enough to hide the 
picture's essential hollowness.</P>
<P>     Scorsese is best known, of course, for movies about violence and 
corruption.  When his name is mentioned, most viewers immediately recall 
the likes of RAGING BULL, GOODFELLAS, TAXI DRIVER, and CASINO.  KUNDUN 
is not the director's first major departure from this familiar territory 
-- he has previously done period pieces (THE AGE OF INNOCENCE) and 
spiritual dramas (THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST).  But, because KUNDUN 
involves no familiar faces (the actors are all Tibetans with no previous 
professional acting experience) and takes place half a world away, it's 
unlike anything Scorsese has attempted.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, it doesn't really work, and the reason is evident.  
The director exhibits far too much reverence for the subject of this 
biography.  While there's no debating that the 14th Dalai Lama is a 
fascinating and important twentieth century figure, Scorsese reduces his 
history to a series of lifeless anecdotes.  Because KUNDUN regards its 
subject as an all-knowing font of wisdom, he is presented virtually 
without flaws, and that makes for a thin and uninteresting individual.  
Contrast KUNDUN's main character with the Messiah in LAST TEMPTATION, 
and it's easy to see the difference.  Christ transcended the two-
dimensional screen because he was beset on all sides by doubts and 
temptations.  It's rare for a similar spurt of vitality to awaken KUNDUN 
from its perpetual slumber.</P>
<P>     The film opens in 1937, when a Holy Man roaming Tibet discovers 
that the Dalai Lama, the secular and spiritual leader of the country, 
has entered his 14th incarnation and is presently a two-year old boy.  
The child proves his identity by flawlessly picking "his" possessions 
(those that belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama) out of a jumble of real and 
fake miscellany.  Several years later, the five-year old is brought to 
the city of Lhassa, where he is schooled in the teachings of Buddhism in 
preparation for fulfilling his mission:  to protect his people.  But 
conflict is close at hand.  Once the Communists come into power in 
China, Chairman Mao decides that the time is right for his country to 
absorb Tibet, and, when the Tibetans resist, they are ruthlessly 
slaughtered.  The Dalai Lama then faces a choice:  remain, capitulate, 
and risk his life, or flee to India, perhaps never to return.</P>
<P>     Despite casting all amateurs, Scorsese has assembled a believable 
group of actors.  Of the four to play the lead role -- Tenzin Yeshi 
Paichang (Age 2), Tulku Jamyang Kunga Tenzin (Age 5), Gyurme Tethong 
(Age 10), and Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong (Adult) -- none is less than 
convincing.  Most of the supporting players, including Tsewang Migyur 
Khangsar as the Dalai Lama's father, Tencho Gyalpo as his mother, Sonam 
Phuntsok as Reting Rimpoche, the man who finds him, Gyatso Lukhang as 
the Lord Chamberlain, and Tenzin Trinley as Ling Rimpoche, the Dalai 
Lama's spiritual teacher, are equally credible.  The problems lie not in 
the performances, but in the bland script.</P>
<P>     From time-to-time, KUNDUN manages a memorable moment.  One scene in 
particular stands out.  In it, the Dalai Lama is having a nightmare 
about the growing death toll in Tibet as a result of the Chinese 
invasion.  The camera pulls back to show him standing amidst a sea of 
his dead, red-robed countrymen -- the very people he has promised to 
protect.  It is a powerful, provocative image -- but too little of 
KUNDUN reaches this level of mastery.  Most of the film is dull and 
soporific.  Breathtaking photography without emotional involvement can 
take an audience only so far.</P>
<P>     One of KUNDUN's advantages is that there's no Brad Pitt (of SEVEN 
YEARS IN TIBET).  And, while Scorsese is not in top form, at least he's 
sincere about the project.  Anyone who stays until the last seconds of 
the closing credits will understand why the film is as respectful (and 
nearly worshipful) as it is.  Although Melissa Mathison is credited with 
the screenplay, Scorsese thanks "His Holiness the Dalai Lama" for 
cooperating with and contributing to the production.  That almost 
qualifies KUNDUN as an autobiography, and would anyone expect the 
religious leader to represent himself as less than saintly?</P>
