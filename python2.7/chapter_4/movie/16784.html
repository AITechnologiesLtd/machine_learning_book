Hard Rain (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Review by Christian Pyle</PRE>
<P>In "Hard Rain," an armored car carrying $3M is caught in a flood.  A gang of
thieves led by Morgan Freeman attack, and the surviving guard (Christian
Slater) must run off and hide the money.  The gang pursues Slater through the
flooded streets of a small, evacuated Indiana town.  Along the way, he runs
into a woman restoring a church (Minnie Driver), the sheriff (Randy Quaid), and
a bickering old couple (Richard Dysart and Betty White).  (Dysart and White
provide excellent comic relief.)  The various characters fight each other as
the waters rise and the dam nears the breaking point.</P>
<P>Though burdened with the dumbest title in recent history, "Hard Rain" is an
entertaining blend of the genres of disaster and action.  It offers many
thrills but little depth.  The script by Graham Yost  has the same strengths
and weaknesses of his other work (which includes "Broken Arrow" and "Speed"): 
interesting premise and effective pacing but little attention to character,
i.e. plenty of style, little substance.  The lack of character development in
"Hard Rain" seems especially disappointing because the characters are
intriguing.  The gang of thieves includes a kindly leader (Freeman), a
slow-witted teen (Michael Goorjian), a Bible-quoting young man (Ricky Harris),
and a school teacher (Dann Florek); I kept expecting this odd collection of
people to be explained and developed.  (It wasn't.)</P>
<P>So, what we have is action and thrills.  The action moves well, and Slater and
Driver find many opportunities to nearly drown.  Director Mikael Salomon  has
experience making a movie in and under water; he served as cinematographer for
James Cameron's "The Abyss."</P>
