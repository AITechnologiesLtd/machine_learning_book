<P> by Curtis Edmonds -- <A HREF="mailto:blueduck@hsbr.org">blueduck@hsbr.org</A></P>
<P>Imagine a movie with this premise:  After years of struggling with his
private law practice, a young Southern lawyer gets an opportunity to
work for a large New York law firm.  The work is absorbing, he feels the
need to prove himself to his partners, he likes the money -- so he
spends more and more time at work.  His wife, on the other hand, hates
New York, hates leaving her family and friends back home, hates the
people her husband works for and the New York social scene in which she
feels pressured to participate.  As her husband becomes more and more
engrossed in his job, she sees less and less of him and becomes lonely,
isolated and depressed.</P>
<P>The husband is handed the case all of New York is talking about, a
triple homicide committed by a wealthy and evil real estate developer.
As the evidence against his client mounts, however, the lawyer's wife
begins to deteriorate.  She begins to have hallucinations --
specifically, that the people her husband works with are possessed by
demons.  The lawyer must choose between the fame and fortune that will
come if he gets his wealthy, guilty client acquitted or dealing with his
wife's fragile mental health -- and then is forced to watch as his
choice goes tragically wrong.</P>
<P>Sounds like a great movie, doesn't it?  And it almost got made, too.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, this is not the movie we're reviewing today.  What we
have is The Devil's Advocate, starring Al Pacino as the Devil.  Pacino
is the senior partner at the New York law firm of the aforementioned
young lawyer (Keanu Reeves), and is trying to use the power of a
high-dollar silk-suit New York law firm to wreck the world.  (Not a bad
choice of tools, either.)</P>
<P>Reeves still can't act, and is not at all believable as a slick young
lawyer -- and especially not as a slick Southern lawyer (he never
masters the accent).  Let's not talk about him.  The heart of this movie
is two great performances, one from Pacino as Satan, and Charlzie Theron
as Reeves's neglected wife.  Both actors do a fine job -- however, their
hard work is ultimately wasted because somebody thought it would be a
good idea to put them both in the same movie.</P>
<P>Pacino is good in this movie because Pacino is good, period.  In the
climactic scene, where Pacino is revealed to be Lord of Hell, Pacino
gives a screaming, ranting polemic against God.  And he does such a good
job, and is so effective in the role, that it's not until after the
movie that you realize that what he's saying didn't make a word of
sense.  (I felt the same way about his rant at the end of Scent of a
Woman as well, if that tells you anything.)  Pacino isn't the best
screen Devil -- that would be Jack Nicholson in The Witches of Eastwick,
in my opinion -- but he's enjoying himself, he's a pro, and ultimately,
he's Al Pacino.</P>
<P>If Pacino is just living up to our high expectations, Theron surpasses
them.  We first see her as a Southern party girl, drinking, dancing and
romancing with her lawyer husband.  Later we see her as abandoned and
alone in an eight-bedroom apartment... and still later, heading down the
slippery slope to madness.  She goes from being completely superficial
and annoying to being heartbreakingly tragic in the course of this
movie.  It's an impressive performance in a very well-written part.</P>
<P>What makes The Devil's Advocate a flat failure is that it cheapens
Theron's performance.  By placing the blame for her collapse on Pacino's
diabolical schemes and manipulation instead of on Reeves, the filmmakers
have turned a potentially decent tragedy into a theater-of-the-absurd
black comedy.  There's a wonderful, haunting shot of Keanu Reeves
silently wandering down a digitally emptied New York street that should
have been the last shot in the movie.  Instead, it's just a segue into
the final supernatural confrontation with the Devil that's nothing more
than an excuse for Pacino to chew the scenery.</P>
<P>It's a shame that a really good performance by Theron, a really good
premise, and a really good town like New York (which looks wonderful)
gets wasted in a dumb, useless, John Grisham wannabe movie like this. I
suppose the filmmakers could say that "the devil made us do it", but I
doubt that he needed the help.</P>
