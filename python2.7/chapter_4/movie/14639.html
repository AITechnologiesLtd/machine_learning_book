<P>   A cartoon in the New Yorker magazine some years ago
features a young American tourist staring up at a disbelieving
guide and insisting, "But I don't want to see the REAL Paris; I
want to see the TOURIST's Paris."  Who can blame her?  If
writer-director Gaspar Noe's image of working-class areas of
Paris and a part of the French countryside in 1980 are any
intimation, this is not the country glorified by Jacques Demy
where most of the women resemble Catherine Deneuve. 
This is down-and-dirty terrain, and Noe portrays its
uncompromisingly bleak topography populated by denizens
who'd be more at home in the digs of Gorky's stories than in
Maxim's.  Taking a clue from Jean-Luc Godard with a nod
toward Bert Brecht, Noe films his drama of devastation with
screen-covering signposts advising viewers what is to come
or ironically pontificating with fortune-cookie slogans like
"Man is Moral." In one of his signposts that leave us
wondering whether to chuckle or bolt, he jackets the screen
with the admonition, "You have ten seconds to leave the
screening of this movie."  In case anyone out there has the
temerity to close his eyes rather than look at the nihilistic
violence, degradation and utter degeneration portrayed in this
hell-raising venture, Noe rouses him with a bang, a noise not
unlike the sound of an automatic weapon.</P>
<P>  "I Stand Alone," which could more literally be entitled "One
Against All" from the French title "Seul Contre Tous," is
narrated by a bankrupt, unemployed butcher who has nothing
to his name after thirty-five years of grinding up the
horsemeat loved by some in French society.  Himself
abandoned as an infant, he has an autistic daughter whom
he has given up to an institution, a fat pregnant mistress
whom he hates, and a despised mother-in-law who lives with
them in a tenement somewhere in the sticks of Lille. The man
is virtually franc-less and so self-destructive that he even
loses a chance to work as a deli man in a supermarket
because he is literally unable to smile.</P>
<P>   While there is some dialogue as the 50-year-old butcher
talks with his mistress, two prospective employers, some
people in a bar and eventually his attractive but mentally
challenged daughter, much of the action takes place in the
man's head as he turns from a reasonably decent person to
an increasingly obsessed and violent beast.  Noe does not
bother to inquire how this lumpen creature became almost
preternaturally frenzied, nor do we need to know much more
than the reality of his unhappy upbringing. We'll have to
accept the man as a representation of what any of us could
be capable of, though few in the audience could picture
themselves even punching their wives' or girl friends' fetuses
to death in a fit of rage.</P>
<P>   His father is said to have been a Communist and the
butcher possesses a view of France that runs the gamut from
Marxism to Fascism without a detour on the way.  He is not
political in the intellectual sense of the word but has visceral
inclinations against people in his country who he feels do not
belong there and against the powerful rich whom he judges to
be all "queer." He parrots slogans that he may have picked
up on TV such as the concept that the law exists simply to
protect the rich and should be ignored by the masses.</P>
<P>   Ideas aside, "Seul Contre Tous" is acted with passion by
Philipe Nahon, whose unsmiling countenance and fiery
surveillance of his limited world reflect a torment leading
rapidly into schizophrenia. The film--which includes hard-core
pornography, and an intensely violent close-up of a woman
spurting blood from the neck as she lay bleeding to death of
a gunshot wound--virtually clobbers the viewers with a vista
of a France so infected with racism, unemployment and
physical deterioration that it looks like a Gallic post-
Armageddon cosmos.  Unlike the Italo-Turkish film"Hamam"--
an optimistic picture which maintains that you can indeed
start out anew by changing your environment--"I Stand Alone"
stands as one of the bleakest, most nihilistic portraits of
debasement, decline and deterioration in memory.  While
some may say, "What's the point?" Gaspar Noe deserves
acclaim for furnishing us with an original piece of cinema
worthy of attention for its sheer audacity.</P>
