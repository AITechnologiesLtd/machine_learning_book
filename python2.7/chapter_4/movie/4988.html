<PRE>                              THE STAR MAKER
                          (L' UOMO DELLE STELLE)
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Foreign language films, when well made, have a charm all their own
and THE STAR MAKER is in that class.  It holds you in its grip as the
story unfolds and while nothing earth-shaking appears to be happening,
little by little what we have been missing begins to surface.</P>
<P>     From one little Sicilian village to another, Joe Morelli
(Sergio Castellio), a con man, travels selling dreams to the poor
inhabitants for a fee.  Morelli looks like a good man, which is a
requisite for that kind of job.  He comes with a truck laden with
camera equipment and reels of film (long since expired) and over his
loud speaker he offers the good people, the farmers and the workers,
and the women of the town, the chance of a lifetime.  For a fee he
will give a screen test, and if he thinks you have what it takes to be
a star who will make millions, he will forward the test to Rome where
big time directors will give their opinion and send for you.  He does,
however, make no promises.</P>
<P>     Naturally, Morelli finds in every face in the village a potential
star. He takes them inside the tent he has set up and cajoles them into
speaking.  If they do not know what to say, he gives them some famous
lines from GONE WITH THE WIND.  If they falter he encourages them to
say anything that comes to mind.  Thus the personal lives of the conned
are revealed.  The urge to do well spurs them on to tell all.</P>
<P>     One such is the beautiful girl, Beata (Tiziana Lodato) who was
brought up in a convent since she was a baby.  She dreams about going
to Rome and becoming a big star and is willing to do anything (which
she has never done before) to raise the money for the screen test.</P>
<P>     The film is, not surprisingly, very good as the director is the
one who gave us the wonderful CINEMA PARADISO.  STAR MAKER has its dark
moments but they only reveal the harm the con man has inflicted on
these poor people but gullible villagers.</P>
<PRE>                  In Italian with English subtitles.</PRE>
<PRE>                   Directed by Giuseppe Tornatore.</PRE>
