<P>     Here's something that you don't see every day:  a Hollywood action-
thriller that knows when to say when.  Never-aging actors Kurt Russell
and Kathleen Quinlan play a California-bound couple, whose bright red,
brand-spanking-new Jeep Cherokee (with Massachusetts plates) breaks down
on a secondary road, somewhere in the Southwest.  A trucker (J.T.
Walsh, Our Favorite Heavy) stops and offers them a ride.  She goes, he
stays, and, not much later, she's nowhere to be found.  Russell goes
slightly nuts, flags down the trucker, and hears those words that we
never want to hear outside of a movie theater:  "I've never seen you
before in my life." And you can take it from there.  (Or watch the
trailer, which reveals a bit more.)</P>
<P>     BREAKDOWN is balanced on every front, from pacing to photography to
suspense to sound effects.  (Is there a sweeter music than that of the
shifting of truck gears?) Most impressive:  director and co-screenwriter
Jonathan Mostow actually allows his everyman hero to *behave* like an
everyman.  (Well, okay, Russell does impersonate Indiana Jones in one
scene.) This guy has to think on his feet and, often, he's at a loss for
what to do.  And while some of his decisions are better than others,
*all* of our hero's actions are based on such determined determination
that you may catch yourself trying to talk back to the screen!  "No,
don't do that, do this!" Just rent the whole damn theater for yourself.</P>
<PRE>     Superb.</PRE>
