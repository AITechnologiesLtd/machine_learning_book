<PRE>A Video Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Twin Falls Idaho is certainly deserving of its private section at the video 
store. There has never been a movie quite like this one. It is a drama, but a 
unique one that will only settle right with a certain audience. Nothing is 
more unusual or extraordinary than the two stars who created this film. Blake 
(Mark Polish) and Francis (Michael Polish) are conjoined twins. Since 
conjoined (or Siamese) babies rarely live long, it is amazing that Blake and 
Francis have made it to their mid-twenties. They live a life where they must 
depend on each other for everything. The mere sight of them sends most people 
running and screaming into their world of normalcy and ignorance. Penny 
(Michele Hicks) is a prostitute that at first runs away when meeting Blake 
and Francis. Soon her conscience catches up with her, and she begins caring 
for the two. There is a growing attraction between Blake and Penny, and the 
two soon fall in love. Francis, however, despises Penny. The tragedy 
continues as Francis's situation worsens. One twin usually provides the life 
support for another, and Blake has always given his brother a strong heart. 
Despite this, Francis is getting weaker and weaker. This leaves Blake with a 
decision. He could die with his brother as he promised, or participate in 
separation surgery and spend the rest of his life with the woman he loves.</P>
<P>That is certainly a dramatic plot if I have ever seen one. One inconsiderate, 
stereotypical gay character aside, there is a drought of needed comedy. 
Nothing was there to lighten things up in the slightest. At first the 
haunting musical score and dreary plot are endurable. Michael and Mark Polish 
are dexterous as filmmakers and actors. Each has a remarkable range of 
emotions, and show true skill. I cannot wait to see what they do next. 
Newcomer Michele Hicks turns in a great performance as well. Her Penny is 
always believable and  mostly pure. The visual style of the movie fits well 
with the subject matter. The camera seems permanently tinted with dark blues, 
greens, and black. These colors also fill most of the images onscreen and set 
the somber mood. The script, written by the brothers, falters. Its first half 
is agreeable, after that point it gets increasingly gloomy. It keeps going 
downhill until it becomes what is essentially a well-acted soap opera. This 
is very bleak stuff. Add an ending that lacks closure, and you have a movie 
with an inferior second half that outweighs its superior first half. </P>
<P>Before viewing this slow and disheartening movie, try taking a dose of Prozac 
mixed with caffeine. This statement should not indicate this is a bad film, 
just one that conjures up assorted feelings depending on the mood of the 
viewer. Twin Falls Idaho is unique in so many ways. It is also very 
depressing, and reminds us to be thankful for the simplest things we take for 
granted. The movie is a mixed bag. Some should move on, while it is 
recommendable for others.</P>
