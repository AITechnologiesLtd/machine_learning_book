<PRE>Carreying the Show
Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>It's the same old story the Doc published back in 1957, but with some
tweaking. The Grinch's grinchiness back-story is told and wha'da'ya'know
there's a love interest involved. Also, little Cindy Lou isn't simply the
sweet faithful who of yester-century; this who's got some Christmas
suspicions of her own, "Presents? Isn't that superfluous?" Later she sings,
"Did Christmas change or was it just me?" The maturing child perspective
makes a nice addition to the collection of Holiday tales.</P>
<P>Bumpy, but fun second and third acts follow a very rough first act.
Translating a fictional cartoon into fictional cartoony live-action is a
daunting unforgiving task that this first act does not make look effortless.
Whoville will take some time to get used to and the silly bustling of whos
spills over with silly gags unable to carve a smile on the average adult.
But, Jim Carrey's resilient spirit, rubber bones, and love of charades,
carries the production like an over-packed sack of toys up the steep
slippery slope. Though, two sizes too small, it's his heart that saves the
show.</P>
<P>A couple of the more notably riotous elements include the Grinch trying with
all his might to scare the unscareable, ultimately adorable Cindy Lou and
the Grinch's cave from crawling socks to self-defeating answering machine.
Speaking of machines, kudos to the set and prop designers. Kids will love
the wacky mechanization.</P>
<P>Speaking of speaking, I swear Carrey's cheers scare up a share of the vocal
wares of one Sean Connery imitating Mr. Magoo. Whoever, it works.
Interestingly, the press notes are careful to point out that Carrey "with no
accompaniment or anything to alter his voice" sang the signature song
"You're A Mean One Mr. Grinch" from the 1966 animated classic. I must say,
Carrey's absolutely splendid vocal work on that musical piece pulls together
one of the film's strongest moments.</P>
<P>Incidentally, Theodor S. Geisel (Dr. Seuss), content with the 1966 version,
turned down any following offers to bring "The Grinch" into live-action.
After his death in 1991, his wife Audrey likewise shook her head at all
proposals ... until this one, that is.</P>
