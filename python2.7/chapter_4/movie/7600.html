<P>     THIEVES is Andre Techine's followup to his unexpectedly successful
1995 art-house entry, WILD REEDS.  In fact, Techine drew so much
interest for his installment of the French TV series, ALL THE BOYS AND
GIRLS OF THE WORLD, that Filmopolis Pictures rushed out and acquired the
distribution rights to Techine's previous film, MA SAISON PREFEREE. 
Now, the acclaimed director whose movies were once rarely seen beyond
New York's Walter Reade Theater is reaching increasingly larger and more
enthusiastic audiences.</P>
<P>     Actually, in the wake of MA SAISON PREFEREE and WILD REEDS, THIEVES
represents a slight step down.  Emphasis, however, on slight.  The film
features riveting performances by French icons Catherine Deneuve and
Daniel Auteuil as two points of a romantic triangle.  The third
component is essayed by the sexy Laurence Cote, who, despite ten years
of French screen credits, is a virtual newcomer to U.S. viewers.  The
acting, a hallmark of Techine's films, has never been stronger than in
THIEVES.</P>
<P>     Auteuil plays Alex, a French cop with a chip on his shoulder and a
penchant for keeping his emotions under lock and key.  Auteuil, who does
this kind of role so well (check out UN COUER EN HIVER for an example),
is perfectly cast, and never for the briefest of moments does his
portrayal ring false.  Deneuve, the ageless star who is returning
opposite Auteuil (the two played brother and sister in MA SAISON
PREFEREE), is superlative as Marie, the fragile philosophy professor who
falls in love often and easily.  On the other hand, although Cote gives
a strong performance, her character, Juliette, is more of a catalyst
than a three-dimensional individual.  Juliette's presence remains
enigmatic and sketchily drawn, and is all-but-forgotten during the
movie's final third.</P>
<P>     The event that jump-starts THIEVES is the murder of Alex's criminal
brother, Ivan (Didier Bezace), who was the head of a car-stealing ring. 
Juliette is somehow mixed up in the ring, but the situation is
complicated because she's sleeping with Alex, who has been trying to
gather enough evidence to put his brother behind bars.  Marie,
Juliette's other lover, becomes involved in the investigation when
Juliette disappears and Alex approaches her to see whether she has been
in touch with the young woman.  Through a series of flashbacks presented
from four different perspectives (Marie's, Juliette's, Alex's, and that
of Alex's adolescent nephew, Justin), Techine develops both plot and
characters.</P>
<P>     The best parts of THIEVES are the beginning and end, which
concentrate on Alex and Marie, both as they interact with Juliette and
with each other.  The middle section of the film is somewhat murky, and,
with Auteuil and Deneuve largely off-screen, less compelling.  Taking
nothing away from Cote's performance, she doesn't hold our attention the
way her co-stars do, in part because her character doesn't exhibit the
same emotional depth or breadth.  This segment of the movie also
features the most exposition, introducing us to the inner workings of
the thieves' ring.  Compared with the emotional tension choreographed by
Techine when he concentrates on the romantic triangle, this aspect of
THIEVES seems mundane. </P>
<P>     THIEVES' payoff occurs during the last third, when Alex and Marie,
ostensibly searching for Juliette, become entwined in each others'
lives.  This isn't love, at least not in the conventional sense, but
something that is, paradoxically, less profound and more complex.  As
the two of them try to establish a sense of trust, the normally-open
Marie finds herself shutting down while the emotionally-closeted Alex
discovers, much to his surprise, that he is capable of developing
feelings for a woman whom he initially treats with contempt. 
Ultimately, the film's anchor is Alex, whose highest hope for life is
not to feel pain, who never laughs and sees evil everywhere, and whose
personality alters with brilliant-but-unmistakable subtlety.</P>
<P>     Techine's development of Alex and Marie is masterful; Auteuil and
Deneuve keep our attention riveted to the screen whenever they're on. 
And, while the director doesn't succeed in plumbing the emotional depths
reached by MA SAISON PREFEREE, there are elements of THIEVES that touch
us nearly as forcefully -- those moments just aren't as plentiful.  So,
although THIEVES is strong and keenly-insightful, it is the least
imposing of Techine's trio of U.S. releases.</P>
