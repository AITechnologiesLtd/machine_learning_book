<P>     [Overheard in the rec room at the Old Chestnuts Rest Home for
Over-Worked Film Premises in Boca Raton, Florida:]</P>
<P>     MISMATCHED BUDDY ACTION COMEDY:  Hey, D. H., I hear we may be getting
a new arrival soon.</P>
<P>     DIE HARD-IN-A-CONFINED-SPACE THRILLER:  I don't know, Buddy, it feels
pretty cramped around here as it is.</P>
<P>     BUDDY:  Well, this one definitely needs a break.  The name is
Romantic Comedy Where a Couple Pretends to Be Together for an Ulterior
Motive, or some such.</P>
<PRE>     D. H.:  That's a mouthful.</PRE>
<P>     BUDDY:  Yeah, and she's been a busy little thing.  CAN'T BUY ME LOVE,
GREEN CARD, PRETTY WOMAN, HOUSESITTER...why, she even showed up in a cameo
already this summer, in MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING.  The latest is called
PICTURE PERFECT, starring that darling little Jennifer Aniston from
"Friends."</P>
<PRE>     D. H.:  She's a looker, all right.</PRE>
<P>     BUDDY:  She plays an unmarried advertising executive named Kate
Mosley who is feeling pressure from every direction to settle down.  Her
mother (Olympia Dukakis) nags her, her boss (Kevin Dunn) suggests that
only "stable" employees will get the choice assignments, and the office
Lothario (Kevin Bacon), who gets Kate all hot and bothered, is only
interested in girls who are unavailable.</P>
<PRE>     D. H.:  Sounds like young Kate needs a mate, or at least the
appearance of one.</PRE>
<P>     BUDDY:  You guessed it, D. H.  Enter Nick (Jay Mohr), a nice young
fellow with whom Kate had a picture taken at a wedding.  Everyone is led
to believe that Nick is Kate's long-distance fiance, which works out fine
until Nick becomes a minor celebrity and everyone wants to meet him.  So
Kate finds Nick and asks him to play the part.  And predicaments ensue.</P>
<P>     D. H.:  Predicaments...ha!  Running through broken glass in bare feet
from armed terrorists, now _that's_ a predicament.</P>
<P>     BUDDY:  Yes, well...anyway, Miss Aniston is fetching enough in the
lead role, with that kind of frazzled charm Sandra Bullock turned into
stardom.  The script by Arleen Sorkin, Paul Slansky and Glenn Gordon Caron
has a few clever moments, and Caron's direction is well-paced.  What
really makes it worth a look is an engaging, low-key performance by Jay
Mohr as Nick.  It's uncommon to find an actor who can make earnestness
interesting, or who can make an audience root for him by sheer force of
his good nature, despite an under-written role.  And we know that's not
the only angle Mohr can work, since he did a fine job of playing a
completely slime in JERRY MAGUIRE.</P>
<PRE>     D. H.:  Well, then, what's the problem?</PRE>
<P>     BUDDY:  The problem, as we both know, is that a script has to be
better than that to keep audineces watching when you know exactly how the
story is going to end.  It's only a matter of time before the two phony
lovers figure out they should be real lovers, and someone learns an
Important Lesson along the way.  Actually, everyone in PICTURE PERFECT
learns an Important Lesson along the way, undergoing an 11th hour
conversion so that there isn't a single moderately unlikeable character
remaining by the closing credits.  Only Mohr seems like a genuinely decent
person; everyone else reads the lines of a genuinely decent person because
the formula demands it.</P>
<P>     GRITTY, PROFANE CRIME CAPER (from the corner):  Hey, will you two
shut the *&%$ up before I blow you the *&%$ away?</P>
<P>     BUDDY:  Sorry.  Anyway, it's a cute enough little picture, but it
strains that thin premise to its limits.  She could certainly stand a few
months here.</P>
<PRE>     D. H.:  I have to agree with you there.</PRE>
<P>     BUDDY:  You see, even though we seem completely different, I knew we
had something in common all along.</P>
<PRE>     D. H.:  Yippee-ki-yay, mother...</PRE>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 old chestnuts:  6.</PRE>
