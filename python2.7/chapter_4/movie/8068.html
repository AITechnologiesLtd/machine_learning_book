My Best Friend's Wedding - Like All Weddings, Some Bliss, Some Boredom</PRE>
<P>Julia Roberts plays a confident and driven woman named Julianne.  As a   
food critic, she is very busy, independent, and too rapt up in her   
ambitions for love.  At dinner with another friend, George (Rupert   
Everett), she reminisces about her best friend, Michael (Dermot   
Mulroney).  He is someone who she had loved but dumped in college.  Now,   
she and Michael are best friends.  They've shared the most intimate   
stories, they've trekked through life's worst woes, and they've even made   
a blood pact.  When Julianne turns 28, if neither of them has gotten   
married, then they will marry each other.</P>
<P>Of course, it is just a few weeks before her 28th birthday, and Michael   
has left a message on her answering machine for her to call him.  Could   
this be the moment when she faces the consequences of her pact?  She   
doesn't know what to think, but when she finally calls him back,   
partially expecting a proposal, he gives her some news that literally   
floors her.  He's calling to explain he's engaged to be married in three   
days.  Her heart has been squashed.  She now realizes that Michael is no   
longer her best friend, but the man that she truly loves.</P>
<P>She flies to Chicago to meet up with Michael.  But secretly, she will try   
to do whatever she can to separate the two and take him back.  Her task   
is formidable.  His fiancee is Kim Wallace (Cameron Diaz).  She is sweet   
as pie, smooth as vanilla and her father is a tycoon.  What we get is a   
sequence of episodes where Roberts craftily tries to create a rift, but   
somehow the plan always backfires.  But, she deserves to be with   
Michael…or does she?</P>
<P>As a whole, this is a semi-sweet movie about friendships and hidden   
feelings and trying to cross that boundary when it may be too late.  And   
it was nice to take a break from all those   
smash-em-up/crash-em-up/shoot-em-up films.  However, the movie seems to   
be undecided as to its dedication towards Julianne's quest for her man or   
Michael's love for Kim. There wasn't too much romantic tension among any   
of the three.  Also, when our sympathies begin to shift, the movie loses   
its direction.  Further, Michael doesn't seem to have an ounce of   
chemistry with either woman, so the story tends to drag as it looks for   
some kind of burst of energy.  Fortunately, we get an antidote of playful   
wisdom from George, who is Julianne's boss.  He is gay and steals his   
scenes with deft comic charm.  More than just a co-conspirator for   
Julianne, he provides moments of levity and good transition as the movie   
tries to navigate through this three-day story.  But when he's not there,   
the movie begins to drift.</P>
<P>Yet, it's nice to welcome back Julia Roberts who recently endured roles   
for which no one cared (Michael Collins and Mary Reilly).  Romantic   
vehicles are where she excels, and she delivers a charismatically   
luminescent performance in MBFW.  Rupert Everett is also a joy to watch   
and adds an unexpected comical dimension as Julianne's boss and soul   
mate.  This movie would have been a lot stronger if it focused more on   
these two.  The interplay between Michael and Kim is quite dull.  The   
interplay between Michael and Julianne was only mildly interesting (and   
just between you and me, I would have preferred one of the cast of   
FRIENDS - maybe Chandler or Joey - play Michael.  At least, the   
relationship would have been more interesting if not funnier).   
 Fortunately, Julianne and George are instrumental in the film's closing   
scenes, and thus helps to lift MBFW from a boring wedding to one with a   
couple of moments worth savoring.  Still, there are better affairs of   
which to be a part.</P>
