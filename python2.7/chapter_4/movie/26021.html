<P>If this movie does not get released during the holiday of Thanksgiving, it
will be one of the worst cases of marketing/distribution decisions ever made
by a studio at any time. This is the ultimate American Thanksgiving holiday
movie. Jodie Foster's HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS was a decent start but this film
basically takes all of the required elements from that movie, the touches of
humor, the emotions, the family issues and multiplies them across four
different cultures celebrating the holiday on the same day.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Four families from different cultural backgrounds (Jewish, Latino,
Vietnamese, African-American) celebrate the holiday of Thanksgiving in
respectively intertwining stories. Many issues are comedically and
dramatically discussed here including adultery, racism, cultural
ethnocentricity, teen accessibility to guns, homosexuality, mother-in-laws,
parental pressure, old school mentality, interracial dating and much, much
more.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A well-rounded blend of stories combine to create an ideal picture for all
families to see in respect to the holiday of Thanksgiving. This movie has
many of the elements needed to create a good movie, including plenty of
humor, dramatic moments, confident directing and wonderful acting
performances. Alongside that are all the elements needed to generate
resonant feelings of Thanksgiving, including the cozy nature of the picture,
the light, agreeable soundtrack, the wonderful presentations of food and
drink, and the ultimate feelings of love and anger shared by family members
throughout. I truly enjoyed this movie because it didn't really allow me not
to like it. It presented me with four stories, each of which was as
interesting as the next, many engaging characters, most of whom shared
issues and tribulations to which I could relate, and a lot of cultural
differences, many of which are universally appreciated. The film is well
presented, easily understood and doesn't overdo the "sappy" stuff.</P>
<P>In fact, that is sort of related to the one thing which sort of disappointed
me about the film, and that was its lack of powerful closure. The film
cleaned up all of its stories by the final frame, but I honestly expected
more of an emotional punch from each. The conclusions were all generally
well-handled, but after spending so much time with each family, I was hoping
to feel a little more from their stories, but alas, t'was not to be.
Overall, the film worked on various levels including its humor, which seemed
to particularly rile up the older members of our audience, and its
characters, all of which were played admirably by its actors, none of whom
particularly stood out more than the others. And despite a little
stereotyping (to be expected since most stereotypes do derive from a little
bit of fact), all of the families were very evenly presented here and giving
more than enough opportunity to ingratiate themselves to the audience. A
perfect movie for the holidays, one that presents a universal theme of highs
and lows of family life within different cultures, this movie has the
laughs, the drama, the direction and the characters to complete its
interesting story presentations. Gobble-gobble and prepare to get real
hungry after seeing this film, as the dishes presented within are quite
droolable!</P>
