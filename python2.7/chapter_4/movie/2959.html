<PRE>                             TERMINAL VELOCITY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Charlie Sheen, Nastassja Kinski, James Gandolfini,
Christopher McDonald.
Screenplay:  David Twohy.
Director:  Deran Sarafian.</P>
<P>     Most of the time, I see a new movie on its opening weekend, and
it's not just so that my reviews can be fairly fresh.  It is also an
attempt to avoid, to the extent that it is possible, pre-conceptions
based on other reviews.  Such was not the case with TERMINAL VELOCITY,
which had the chance to accumulate a mountain of negative response in
the two weeks between its opening and my screening.  It's difficult to
preduct how those pre-conceptions will affect my own reaction.  In this
case, they allowed me to be pleasantly surprised.  TERMINAL VELOCITY is
frenetic and uneven, but it has a certain bone-headed charm thanks to
Charlie Sheen's improbably dense hero.</P>
<P>     Sheen plays Richard "Ditch" Brody, a skydiving instructor with
something of a reckless streak.  It is that reckless streak which is
blamed when a young woman named Chris (Nastassja Kinski) plunges to her
death while Ditch is giving her a lesson.  The threat of a manslaughter
charge inspires Ditch to do a little investigating of his own, during
which he discovers that for a corpse, Chris appears remarkably lively.
He also discovers that she is a former KGB agent, trying to prevent
other former KGB agents from financing a coup in Russia.  Somewhat
against his will, Ditch becomes Chris' partner in a battle to prevent a
new Cold War.</P>
<P>     The plot of TERMINAL VELOCITY is not exactly what you would call
inspired; it's basically classic Hitchcock crossed with classic James
Bond.  The plot's few twists and turns are spelled out in huge letters
from the outset, and a bit clumsy in the execution.  Equally
distracting is a tone which careens from brutal to near slapstick in
moments, making for a schizophrenic experience which isn't as purely
enjoyable as it might be.  Director Deran Sarafian drives the action
forward relentlessly, which is usually an ideal choice for a film of
this genre, but often seems merely hyperactive here.  TERMINAL VELOCITY
sometimes feels like a cockroach race -- moving fast, but in no
particular direction.</P>
<P>     Its saving graces are the characterizations and interaction of
Charlie Sheen and Nastassja Kinski.  Sheen's Ditch Brody is just a
handful of brain celss removed from his goofball HOT SHOTS! persona,
but it's a character that comes off as extremely refreshing in an
action thriller.  Rather than being either inordinately brilliant or
dumber than virtually everyone in the audience, Ditch is just simple.
He is quite entertaining in scenes where he is infuriated by Kinski's
references to his dim-wittedness, but he maintains a kind of affable
puppy-dog eagerness to please.  In one scene, he opens a cylinder which
is supposed to contain valuable information.  When what he finds (a CD
rom disk) isn't what he expects to find, he taps the cylinder on the
desk to make sure there's nothing else inside.  It's a simple gesture,
but funny because it's clear this is no rocket scientist we're dealing
with.  Kinski is also quite good as the tough, edgy agent.  She is
clearly smarter than Ditch, and it's a credit to screenwriter David
Twohy (THE FUGITIVE) that he lets her maintain the upper hand; even
when Ditch has to rescue her late in the film, it never seems as though
she's merely the "woman in distress."</P>
<P>     That rescue, a wildly inventive stunt, is certainly TERMINAL
VELOCITY's highlight.  Plunging through the air in a convertible
Cadillac, Ditch has to fight off villain Christopher McDonald, free
Kinski from the car's trunk and release his parachute before hitting
the ground.  It's a gag worthy of the best Bond films, and it sends
TERMINAL VELOCITY off on a note of high energy.  But it's not an
isolated moment.  TERMINAL VELOCITY is full of well-staged action
sequences, and Twohy's dialogue is rich with fine one-liners.  Though
it sometimes seems a bit too busy and scattershot for its own good,
it's still a perfectly enjoyable no-brainer worth a few solid laughs.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 parachutes:  6.</PRE>
