<PRE>                        Seven Years in Tibet</PRE>
<P>At the time the movie was being made, the filmmakers were unaware
that Heinrich Harrer, had been a member of the Nazi Party; in 1933
he joined the SA (Sturmabtelung) and then the SS (Schutzstaffel) in
1938.   This was revealed  by STERN Magazine after principal
photography had been completed.   When the film- makers learned the
news they added some voice-overs mentioning Harrer's  Nazi
connection.</P>
<P>Harrer (Brad Pitt) was a famous mountain climber.    When asked
about his Nazi association, he claimed that it was to enable him to
have more freedom to travel and engage in mountaineering.   For the
movie's sake, let us assume that it is true.  From what the film
tells of his character, it is likely that what he said is true.</P>
<P>It is known that Harrer was interested only in himself and in any
glory that would accrue to him from his expeditions.   In fact, he
left his wife who was in the last months of pregnancy, giving us a
good idea of how self-centered he was.   As the film opens, he and a
fellow-Austrian,  Peter  Aufschnaiter (David Thewlis) are leaving
Austria to set out to climb one of the highest peaks in the
Himalayas, Nanga Parbat.</P>
<P>When WWII breaks out, he and Peter are captured by the British and
put in a prisoner of war camp from which they later escape.   After
two years of impossible trekking in snowy mountains and through
India they arrive in a land that is very strange to them: Tibet.
This was a time of much trouble in Tibet, their ongoing rebellion
against China's rule.   The filming site was actually in the Andes,
in the Chile-Argentine borders where there were lots of mountains
and snow, both very much needed.</P>
<P>The film shows the change that takes place in Harrer when he meets
the young Dalai Lama whom he teaches about the Western world.  At
this time the Dalai Lama was a mere 14-years-old.  As he grew to
adulthood, he and Harrer, according to Harrer's book on which the
film is based, became fast friends until the present.   By film's
end, Harrer is a changed person from what he was when he left
Austria and his wife.</P>
<P>The crawl at film's end tells us that China, determined not to let
Tibet secede, was responsible for the death of a million Tibetans
as well as for the destruction of many thousands of monasteries.
Little wonder that China has banned the film from being shown in
China.</P>
<P>Beautifully filmed and acted, this is a superb movie.  In addition,
the photography is awe inspiring in its breath.    And bringing the
camera down to earth we are shown the beautiful Tibetan people
lovingly photographed by Robert Fraisse.</P>
<P>Brad Pitt, with a great Austrian accent does a magnificent job as
does David Thewlis. Others, in supporting roles, are B D Wong, Mako,
Danny Denzongpa, Victor Wong. Ingeborga Dapkunaite, Jamyang Jamtsho
Wangchuk, Lhakpa Tsamchoe and Jetsun Pema.</P>
