<P>     Without exception, THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD is the best family 
film to come along thus far in 1995, topping such notables as POCAHONTAS 
and THE LITTLE PRINCESS.  Based on the popular book by Lynne Reid Banks 
and scripted by ET writer Melissa Mathison, the movie teaches lessons 
without preaching, and focuses on the magic of relationships rather than 
that of special effects.  This leads to a production as affecting for 
adults as for children. </P>
<P>     Omri, played with charm and enthusiasm by Hal Scardino, is an 
average nine-year old with a very unusual cupboard in his room.  
Whenever he places a figurine in it, turns the key in the lock, then 
opens the door, a living, breathing, four-inch high creature emerges.  
Omri's first transformation is the Onondaga warrior Little Bear 
(Litefoot), whose reaction upon seeing the "giant" boy is a mixture of 
awe and fear.  Gradually, however, Little Bear realizes that his 
caretaker is no god, and Omri learns that his newfound friend is a human 
being, not just a plaything. </P>
<P>     As THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD progresses, other things get 
animated, including a cranky Texas cowboy (David Keith), a wartime 
British medic, Darth Vader, and Robocop.  The visual effects that mix 
four-foot actors with their miniature companions are effective, but not 
ostentatious, and the lack of flash keeps the focus on the characters 
and their story.  Suspension of disbelief in THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD 
is surprisingly easy. </P>
<P>     This film is about friendships, responsibility, and ethics.  The 
bond between Omri and Little Bear illustrates that, regardless of size, 
shape, or race, any friendship is a rare and special thing.  Thirteen 
years ago, ET taught the same lesson to that summer's movie audiences.  
THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD also enforces the truth that everyone -- even 
a child -- must be responsible for his or her actions.  When Omri begins 
capriciously to give life to figurines, Little Bear reprimands him:  
"You should not use magic that you do not understand."  This prefaces a 
tragic epiphany for the young boy. </P>
<P>     Frank Oz, a director who always seeks original and challenging 
projects (one of his past successes was LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS), brings 
an uplifting sense of fun to this film.  THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD 
moves along at a nearly-perfect pace:  slowly enough to capture the 
nuances of the characters' relationships, but quickly enough to avoid 
stagnation.  Hopefully, the double-edged classification of being a 
"family feature" will not destroy THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD's chances 
at the box office.  It deserves a better fate than that normally 
reserved for similar fare because, ultimately, this movie is not only 
about magic -- it is magical. </P>
