<P>Every so often, most recently with Scream, a film will briefly try to
make the horror genre something it's not --- like creative,
entertaining, cool, or self-aware.  But The House on Haunted Hill is not
one of those films.</P>
<P>Instead, it's pretty much a copy of all the other haunted-house horror
movies that have run briefly in theaters over the years (and then run on
cable channels indefinitely, giving teenagers something to stare at for
a minute or two before leaving the house or switching channels).  I
understand that the beast of cable programming must be fed, but I still
don't understand why directors are still making new movies like this,
given the thousands that have already been made.  Why don't the cable
channels just run old ones from the late 1980s that nobody remembers?</P>
<P>Five people are invited to a party at a deserted former institution for
the criminally insane.  They've been promised a million dollars --- if
they get out alive.  I could summarize some of the other clichés in
Haunted Hill, but anybody who's had cable for a while can probably do it
for themselves.</P>
<P>There's nothing new or innovative about this movie except maybe for the
baffling presence of a few name actors.  Almost every actor or actress
is haunted by a few B movies, and hopefully the careers of Diggs,
Larter, and Kattan will get out alive.  But nothing can explain or
excuse the participation of Geoffrey Rush, who actually has won an
Oscar, for God's sake. Faced with the pressure of following up his work
in Shine and Shakespeare in Love, Rush choked, I guess.</P>
<P>I guess these movies are fun to make, but they're not interesting to
watch.  Please, no more!</P>
