<P>     This just in: The sincere romantic drama is not extinct. Make no
mistake, it's on the endangered species list; in this oh-so-ironic era,
sincerity sightings have been akin to those blurry shots of the Loch Ness
Monster and hubcap-like flying saucers. You don't expect mainstream movies
to deliver romantic stories that seem grounded in genuine feelings, and
you certainly don't expect it from Don Roos, who wrote and directed the
attitude-laden THE OPPOSITE OF SEX. Nevertheless, here comes BOUNCE
offering that rarest of Y2K big-screen commodities: an adult relationship
with some real emotion.</P>
<P>     It starts out, however, like a typical high-concept trifle. Buddy
Amaral (Ben Affleck), a cocky advertising executive, is on his way back to
L.A. from a business trip to Chicago when he meets Greg Janello (Tony
Goldwyn) in an O'Hare Airport bar. Greg is trying to get home to his
family on a snowy night with plenty of flight delays; Buddy is looking for
an excuse to stay the night with a woman he just met. Doing his version of
a good deed, Buddy hands Greg his boarding pass for his L.A.-bound flight.
Tragically, that flight crashes, leaving Buddy with a serious case of
survivor guilt. After a bout with the bottle, Buddy decides that the
closure he needs involves checking in on Greg's widow Abby (Gwyneth
Paltrow) a year after the crash to make sure she's doing all right.</P>
<P>     Naturally, a relationship grows between Buddy and Abby, complicated
by Buddy's unwillingness to admit to Abby that he was the person
responsible for Greg being on the ill-fated plane. The surprise is that
the relationship never feels like a wacky contrivance. Roos is a smart
writer with a nose for full characterizations, and the story development
as a whole rarely feels manipulated for the convenience of the plot (see
below for notable exception). He steps back as a director from some of the
most potentially exploitative moments, and injects his sharp wit in places
where it works organically (particularly in the person of Johnny Galecki
as Buddy's assistant). Though it's a romance with some humor, it never
ignores the basic sadness in both Buddy and Abby's lives that gives
resonance to their connection. Though it's a romance with tragic elements,
it never wallows in the tragedy so much that it turns into melodrama.</P>
<P>     BOUNCE could have been a true gem of a film if the leads had been
more evenly matched as actors. Gwyneth Paltrow is one of those performers
who appears doomed to be scorned and underappreciated for her talent as
long as she is still young and attractive, but let's get this straight:
She's a damned good actress. In BOUNCE, she's once again wonderful,
capturing Abby's strength and vulnerability. Affleck, on the other hand,
still has some growing to do as an actor. He's not a bad actor, but he
still carries himself on screen primarily with a swagger, even when he's
supposed to be emotionally wounded. Buddy the charming cad is a role
Affleck can make appealing in his sleep. Buddy the tormented alcoholic,
huddled in a shower with a drink in his hand, is too heavy a character for
Affleck to clean-and-jerk.</P>
<P>     Roos takes an unfortunately large mis-step during BOUNCE's third act,
when he introduces a sub-plot involving a court battle. Not only does it
once again place Affleck in the unfortunate position of getting all
mega-serious on us, it's also the only time BOUNCE starts to feel like
something that could only happen in a movie. There's nothing inherently
wrong with romantic dramas that take on that AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER-style
sense of heightened tragedy. It's just so unusual when a film gives you
the opportunity to explore romantic complications more simply. BOUNCE
makes it's share of mistakes, but it's always clear that its heart is in
the right place. How refreshing to spend time with a film willing to show
you its heart at all.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 soulful survivors:  7.</PRE>
