<P>After watching "Simon Birch" for the first time, I raced to a bookstore 
and purchased a copy of John Irving's "A Prayer for Owen Meany." I was 
anxious to read the novel for a couple of reasons. First, the 
relationship between the two young boys in the film was so utterly 
charming that I wanted to spend more time with them. Second, the credits 
stated that the movie was "suggested by," rather than "based on," 
Irving's novel, and I wanted to discover why. </P>
<P>Prior to reading the book, I found "Simon Birch" a delightful, if overly 
manipulative, "Stand By Me" derivative. The story tells of best friends 
Joseph Wenteworth (Joseph Mazzelo) and Simon Birch (Ian Michael Smith). 
Joe is a sweet, unassuming kid who wonders if his radiant mother Rebecca 
(Ashley Judd) will ever decide the time is right to reveal the identity 
of the father he has never known. Shunned by his parents, tiny Simon, the 
"smallest delivery ever recorded in the history of Gravestown Memorial 
Hospital," spends as much time with Joe and his mother as possible. 
Highly intelligent and extremely outspoken, Simon's faith is his dominant 
feature. God made him small as part of a divine plan and, regardless of 
what anyone says, Simon views himself as a miracle and awaits his heroic 
destiny.</P>
<P>"Simon Birch" is set in the same idyllic '60s small-town neverland as 
"Stand By Me." Both films use the same framing device, beginning and 
ending with an adult version of one of the characters reflecting on his 
childhood. In the closing seconds of each film, the adult's reminiscing 
ends when his own son demands attention in the here and now. Both films 
feature a central character who endures parents who treat him as if he 
doesn't exist. Both feature an eye-to-eye encounter with a deer in the 
still countryside. And both include a public event that goes riotously 
wrong, incorporating a barfing fat kid for comic effect.</P>
<P>If only "Simon Birch" had copied "Stand By Me's" score as well. As 
opposed to the wistful, understated orchestral music that accented "Stand 
By Me," Marc Shaiman's score in "Simon Birch" is cloying and overbearing. 
The bullying music is not only annoying, it is unnecessary. This is a 
story with enough oomph to stir emotional reactions without a 
manipulative orchestra nudging us through the film.</P>
<P>Despite its dictatorial score and "Stand By Me Jr." sense of cinematic 
deja vu, "Simon Birch" offers a number of pleasures. The portrait of 
resolute faith is stirring and the story of two best friends on a search, 
one for his father and the other for his destiny, is compelling. The 
central players are particularly well cast. Ashley Judd is luminous as 
Rebecca, a strong, devoted mother with a perpetually sunny disposition. 
Oliver Platt is warm and winning as Ben Goodrich, a beau of Rebecca's who 
acts as surrogate father to both boys. </P>
<P>As Joe, "Jurassic Park" veteran Joseph Mazzelo gives a terrific 
performance, so strong that he can carry scenes even when his costar's 
inexperience shows. At 3'1," Ian Michael Smith is certainly the right 
size to play Simon Birch and, despite occasional lapses into stiffness, 
he does fine work for a first time actor. Together, the boys are magic, 
captivating as utterly devoted best friends.</P>
<P>Thanks to their winning performances, I found "Simon Birch" appealing and 
moving despite the oppressive score and Mark Steven Johnson's heavy-
handed script and direction. And then I read the book. </P>
<P>John Irving's "A Prayer for Owen Meany" is remarkable; a rich, complex 
work of art betrayed by Johnson's adaptation. After reading the book it's 
easy to understand why Irving asked the filmmakers to change the names 
and use the phrase "suggested by." Even while making allowances for the 
daunting task of trying to adapt a novel of this scope to fit the 
confines of a feature film, certain of Johnson's decisions are baffling 
at best and infuriating at worst.</P>
<P>Why did he make Simon's parents grim troglodytes who pretend he doesn't 
exist? They weren't that way in the book. Why did he have Joe act sullen 
and standoffish around Ben for much of the film, when in the book he took 
to him almost instantly? Why did he turn most of the secondary characters 
into cardboard cut-outs or leering caricatures? Why did he remove the 
political overtones of the story? Why did he take an opus that spanned 
many years and compress it into one, forcing the invention of a climatic 
scene that feels painfully contrived? And most of all, why did he take 
the Christmas pageant scene, a harrowing, pivotal moment in the book, and 
turn it into a ham-handed farce of barf jokes and horny adolescent 
groping, with Simon exhibiting behavior completely at odds with his 
character?</P>
<P>But enough of that. These are questions that will likely never be 
answered. Maybe they'll make a film of John Irving's "A Prayer for Owen 
Meany" someday. Until then, there's "Simon Birch," a nice little story of 
friendship and faith that manages to charm despite its myriad problems. A 
bit of advice. If you're one of the many fans of the novel, put it 
completely out of your mind before you go to the theater, or skip the 
film entirely and reread the book. And if you haven't read the novel, be 
sure to do so...but for Pete's sake, wait after you've seen the movie. </P>
