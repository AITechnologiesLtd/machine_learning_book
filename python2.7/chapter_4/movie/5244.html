<PRE>                             MRS. WINTERBOURNE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     As an actor, Richard Benjamin always turned in a good
performance.  With rare exceptions, his directorial endeavors somehow
have fallen flat.  Mrs. Winterbourne is an example of the latter.  What
saves the film is the talent of Shirley MacLaine, who plays the title
role.  MacLaine is a born actress.  When, in the film, she does a
momentary movement of her hands and head I suddenly remembered that her
original fame was as a dancer.  The slight momentary movements were so
graceful, so delightful, so filled with Class.</P>
<P>     It is the story that turns the film down into little more than
just another ordinary movie.  The first scene is of a man lying on a
bed, a couple of bullet holes in him.  The TV is on but nobody is
listening.  He,  Steve DeCunzo (Loren Dean), is dead.. How and why and
by whom did DeCunzo meet his Maker?   Flashback.</P>
<P>     Connie Doyle (Ricki Lake) is a young woman on a train but neither
knows nor cares where it is going.  Homeless, broke and in the last
months of pregnancy she is sorely in need of a miracle.  The film's
author provides exactly that.  Based on the novel, "I Married A Dead
Man" by Cornell Woolrich, a series of unlikely events happen
unexpectedly.  There is a train accident and the penniless Connie ends
up in a hospital. She is mistakenly thought, by everyone, to be Mrs.
Wellbourne's daughter-in-law  (also pregnant) who was on the same train
on her way to meet her mother-in-law for the first time..  Both she
and her husband, Hugh Winterbourne (Brendan Frazer) are killed in the
derailment.</P>
<P>     Once we have accepted this series of coincidences, the film moves
along nicely even to the point where the dead Hugh has a twin brother,
Bill.  Connie has to keep the family from discovering who she really is
while her "brother-in-law'" Bill appears to be suspicious.  Because the
actors are so good, because Connie is so charming and Bill so handsome
we are in their rooting for them.  This mistaken identity bit is a
kind of romantic comedy . . . and story of a murder.  Well told.  And,
again, there;s MacLaine.</P>
