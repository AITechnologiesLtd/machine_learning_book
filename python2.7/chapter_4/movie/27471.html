<P>I'm not mad that DOUBLE TAKE ("DT") was, for the most part, a pedestrian
comedy with a fairly generic, and plot hole-filled, storyline.  I'm not
mad that most of DT's relatively funny scenes were shown in its trailer
(and of those, that they all came at the beginning of the movie).  I'm
not even mad that, if DT is successful enough at the box office, Orlando
Jones will likely get more Eddie Griffin-type roles offered to him than
Orlando Jones-type roles (confused?  I'll explain in a minute).</P>
<P>What I am mad about is that America has become so desensitized to the
cuss word "nigga" - yeah, you heard; I called it a cuss word - that even
in its liberal usage, DOUBLE TAKE can still get a PG-13 rating.  MPAA
President Jack Valenti, you oughta be ashamed of your two-faced self.
But not as ashamed as those of Us who keep using that ugly term as if it
were an honorific, should be.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Nothing fancy here: Daryl Chase (Orlando Jones) is a successful wall
street banker who stumbled across some Funny Money which is somehow tied
to the Mexican corporation he, his assistant Shari (Vivica A. Fox), and
his boss C.A. (Edward Herrmann) are trying to do business with.  Pretty
soon, Daryl discovers that he's being set up to take a fall, all the
while being pursued by Martinez (Benny Nieves), Norville (Daniel
Roebuck) and Gradney (Sterling Macer Jr).  When the frame job turns into
a charge of murder, he "borrows" the identity of the one person who
might be able to help him - a street hustler named Freddy Tiffany (Eddie
Griffin) - and on the advice of FBI agent T.J. McCready (Gary Grubbs),
heads to Mexico.  But, as Daryl soon finds out, appearances can be
deceiving...</P>
<P>The Upshot:
It's clear from the start that the story in DOUBLE TAKE is secondary to
its main purpose, which is, primarily, to showcase the talents of its
stars: standup comedian Eddie Griffin and comic actor Orlando Jones.  In
this sense, it worked, at least partially; especially as pertains to
Jones.</P>
<P>I've seen Orlando Jones in a few previous roles: as one of the funnier
players in the otherwise dull THE REPLACEMENTS; as The Black Guy [uh,
sorry about that] in BEDAZZLED; and, yes, as the Comic Relief in some
7Up pop commercials.  But in DT, Jones impressed me much more than in
anything else I've ever seen him in - to the point where DT gets a
flashing yellowlight rating solely on the strength of his participation.
Jones' Daryl Chase was that rarity of Black comic skit characters: he
was as believable playing Mr. Wall Street (importantly, without the
unneeded Sellout Uncle Tom overtones) as he was the Schlitz Malt
Liquor-seeking hoodie rat.   The refreshing thing about his character,
in Wall Street-mode, is that Jones portrayed him as a smart, ambitious,
but realistic - and still Old School - achiever.  In other words, Chase
was Everyday Black Folk.  As I said, my estimation of the movie was
raised a notch because of Jones.</P>
<P>Even given my lowered expectations of this type of movie [everybody who
expected Shakespeare In The Round, raise your hands.  Thought so... ]
there's still a limit on the amount of wiggle room I'll give a flick,
"low-brow" or not.  Eddie Griffin quickly reached that limit.  Unlike
Jones, Griffin never made me believe he was anything but the
nigga-spouting street clown he portrayed from the start.  Maybe I
shouldn't be too hard on the brotha - after all, he is more a standup
comedian than a bona fide actor - but hey, I calls it as I sees it.  And
as I sees it in DT, Griffin's welcome was worn out before the end of the
first act.  He lacked the charm of a Jamie Foxx or the depth of an Eddie
Murphy [or is that vice-versa?]; and without much substance to work
with, the flash he had, quickly dulled.</P>
<P>As expected, the supporting cast members were primarily in place to
provide Jones and Griffin characters to bounce their schtick off of,
though Garcelle Beauvais as Chase's sultry lingerie model girlfriend
Chloe, and especially Andrea Navedo as the multi-faceted Maque Sanchez,
provided a bit more than the standard Warm Place To Put It parts that
one might predict of the female leads in an action comedy (strangely
enough, Vivica A. Fox, the one cast member who might've added more to
the DT stew, makes an early exit.  Bad move, guys).  Of the remaining
cast, even a veteran character actor like Edward Herrmann seemed like so
much jetsom and flotsam floating in a lifeless sea - though "Delores" -
Freddy's lap dog - provided an unexpected chuckle or two of her own.</P>
<P>If it seems like I hated this movie, I really didn't; DT never went very
far with me, but it did have its moments, and truthfully, Griffin did
improve over time (once Freddy stopped playing Street, and stopped
spouting "nigga", he was tolerable).  DOUBLE TAKE just wasn't my cup o'
tea; Your Method May, of course, Vary.</P>
<P>I just hope Hollywood casting agents start sending Orlando Jones scripts
that allow him to showcase his acting and comedic skills without always
and only requiring him to Act (their warped idea of) Black.  The Orlando
Jones I saw in DT wasn't the one-dimensional caricature that was his
okay-we-get-it-dammit! costar.  Here's hoping Jones allows his potential
to be challenged even further, regardless of the shortsightedness of
those who would typecast him.  Fingers crossed.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
I tried hard to keep my - can I make it plain? - my "boy, I hope White
Folk ain't diggin' this clown" kneejerk sensitivity in check; I truly
did.  And I genuinely liked Orlando Jones here; with a minimum of
over-the-top posturing, his Daryl Chase won me over, easily convincing
me that Jones' talent runs deep.  But there's only so much "nigga"ing I
can take.  And, along with it, only so much of the clowning Eddie
Griffin.</P>
<P>DOUBLE TAKE (rating: flashing yellowlight):
One take was quite enough, thankyewverramuch.</P>
