<P>     This one gets my vote for the year's most boring movie.  Taking his
twentieth (!) turn behind the camera, Clint Eastwood directs this
ambling, aimless adaptation of John Berendt's non-fiction bestseller,
about a Manhattan writer (John Cusack) covering the trial of a wealthy
Savannah socialite (Kevin Spacey) accused of murdering his gay lover
(Jude Law).  In the process of uncovering information for what he
decides will be a book, the journalist crosses paths with several
eccentrics, including a cackling voodoo priestess (Irma P.  Hall) and
the real-life drag queen Lady Chablis (played by herself).  While the
core story is certainly compelling, MIDNIGHT has nary a whiff of
dramatic urgency during it's long, long, *long* 154-minute running time.
(Shit, even the trial sequences are tame.  Have you ever seen such
polite proceedings?) On the up side, however, the locales are lush and
the accents authentic.  Making her acting debut (and scoring her fair
share of scenes), Ms. Chablis is remarkably unremarkable.  As is Spacey,
who underplays to the point of near disinterest.  Jack Thompson is a
stronger presence as the defending lawyer, as is Clint's daughter
Alison, as a love interest to the reporter.  She's a cutie.  Cusack,
however, is a loss-- a non-presence who wears the same slack-jawed
expression is every single scene.  Heaven help the straight man.  BTW,
was our projection bulb going bad, or were more than few scenes in need
of better lighting?</P>
