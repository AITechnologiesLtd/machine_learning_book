                                 [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Chris Hillery
                        Copyright 1990 Chris Hillery</PRE>
<P>     After reading Robert Dorsett's review of BIRD ON A WIRE, I have but
one question: did we see the same movie?  I thoroughly enjoyed this
movie, and disagree with nearly every point Robert made to the movie's
fault.  I feel I should at least offer this alternative review; I'll go
approximately in the same order as did he (have his review displaying in
another window; multi-tasking's grand =), so here goes...</P>
<P>     I thought the story, while not the world's most original, was far
more than "very, very weak"; it was considerably more literate than most
these days, with no real holes.  There were no great surprises (yes,
love triumphs; would the movie be as interesting if they ended up hating
each other?), but plenty enough twists and turns to keep things moving.
I didn't see much of Gibson "posturing"; he was merely trying to save
his life.  And Hawn was more than "cute"; she had a definite and
reasonably strong personality of her own.  Sure, there was plenty of
action (explosions, car chases (a really good one, I thought), etc);
why is this bad?  The movie is an action-comedy.  </P>
<P>     The one point Mr. Dorsett (don't that sound formal?  =)) made
several times was the Bad Guys (tm) were "inexplicable"; I didn't
understand how he arrived at this opinion at all.  Obviously they were
(somewhat stereotypical, granted, but hey...) corrupt drug cops, in
search of revenge against the narc that did them in (Gibson).  Fifteen
years in prison would be enough to give them a pretty strong grudge.
The FBI agent that deleted Gibson's file and otherwise helped the bad
guys trail him was being blackmailed by the two ex-cops.  The points
Robert lists in the "Spoilers" section of his review at the end...  I
didn't understand any of them.  Who were the "people the ex-DEA people
were doing deals with" that wanted Gibson dead?  I didn't see them; the
primary bad guys were the two bad ex-cops and the FBI agent they were
blackmailing.  He made a few other points too; as I said, I didn't
follow his logic or what he was saying.  At any rate, I don't think
there were plot holes relating to this aspect of the movie.</P>
<P>     Moving back to the first part of the review, on Product
Endorsements: I didn't see these to be big at all.  She was driving a
blue BMW, the police had to refer to it as such; they couldn't just be
on the lookout for a "blue convertible luxury car."  And the Apple
placement was similar, although a bit more noticeable (Apple emblem on
the side of the machine).  I guess my point is: so?  It'd be tough to
make a movie without tossing in a few brand names.  It wasn't
distracting or anything.</P>
<P>     In his "Downer" section, Robert again refers to Gibson as a "Sex
Symbol" and Hawn as a "Giddy Flake."  Again, I didn't see this.  Gibson
*is* a sex symbol, and again he was running for his life so I think he
was excused in being a Tough Guy (tm).  Casting against type is
difficult, and what's wrong with casting *with* type?  And, again, I
didn't see Hawn's character as being a giddy flake, or a rich spoiled
mover and shaker.  Sure, there were a few obligatory jokes by Hawn along
those lines ("I need food; I need a shower; I need a massage" when lost
in the woods, etc.) but these were nowhere near as frequent or silly as
many movies with similar openings.</P>
<P>     And on to the Spoilers section... guess I better stick one of
these things in although I guess I've let a few slip by already...</P>
<P>     As to the "left at the altar"/"grieving widow" contradiction, well,
I guess either Hawn was speaking metaphorically in one or the other's
case, most likely the latter.  At any rate, a minor nit-pick.</P>
<P>     I've covered the bad-guy debate, so: about the flying scene.  I
thought it was quite well done, and I'm usually on the lookout for bad
special effects as I hope to make a career in that field (good luck,
huh?).  What particular instance does he think he saw a model?  I
thought it was quite apparent in most parts that they were indeed using
a real plane/helicopter, and I didn't see any obvious models.  And about
the plane/helicopter number prefixes: didn't catch that, and come on...
that is a minor slip.  Most people don't know about those things
anyway...</P>
<P>     His appraisal of the zoo scene I almost can agree with; it was
pretty contrived and it probably wasn't necessary to have it there.
However, it was well done and had good tension, and was a reasonably
good climax.  I've seen a few better and many worse.  The two first
oddment he mentioned (tiger chasing Hawn's coat instead of her); well, I
guess maybe you have a point, that was a little daft.  But, it worked.
(=  As to the second, though (why tigers passed up fresh meat and kept
nipping at Gibson swinging there); don't most wild animals prefer to
hunt their meals?  This is why "playing possum" works, in at least some
cases.  The tigers were probably simply more interested in the prospect
of "hunting" the still-moving Gibson than preying on the already dead
and quite still Bad Guy.  This also goes to suggest that yes, indeed,
these animals were fed previously; a starving tiger will eat whatever,
whether or not it killed it personally.  And wasn't the Bad Guy still
lying on the electric fence?  The tigers had certainly learned long
before to avoid that sucker.</P>
<P>     Finally, he says, the movie seems to be intended for television:
virtually no profanity and surprisingly little violence.  Well, I for
one found it pretty refreshing to hear something other than four-letter
words every verse end.  As to little violence: there was a considerable
amount, I thought, granted not terribly graphic, but nonetheless
violence; I suppose "surprisingly" is a relative term, though.  It
worked for me.</P>
<P>     Overall, then, I almost fully disagree with Robert Dorsett's review
of this movie.  I thought it was a thoroughly entertaining, well-laid
movie with plenty of action and humor and enough romance to pass muster.
I don't think there were any real holes in the plot, and there was
enough depth to the plot to make it interesting to the thinking mind,
too.  I'd give it a solid 8 out of 10 (3 1/4 stars).  If you like action
movies with comedy, it's definitely worth a see.  Enjoy!</P>
