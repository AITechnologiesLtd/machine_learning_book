<P>A more appropriate title for Very Bad Things would be Absolutely
Disgusting Things That Defy Belief. The movie is indescribably nasty; so
graphically violent that it may cause your stomach to do a somersault as
you valiantly attempt to hold your cookies. For those who can withstand
it, and (most importantly) aren't easily offended, Very Bad Things is a
refreshingly daring black comedy boasting an admirable courage as it
goes completely overboard (and then some...) into bad taste.</P>
<P>I would encourage those you want to truly experience this film to not
read any reviews, and just plunge straight into the grotesque, macabre
proceedings that resemble a mixture of Shallow Grave and Quentin
Tarantino. But for everyone else, here is the process in which the plot
takes off:</P>
<P>1) Kyle Fisher (Jon Favreau) and his fiancee Laura (Cameron Diaz) are
preparing for their wedding. But first, Kyle and four of his typical guy
friends - Adam (Daniel Stern), Michael (Jeremy Piven), Boyd (Christian
Slater) and Charles (Leland Orser) - are off to Vegas for a bachelor
party. Once in their hotel, the five immediately suck back an ample
amounts of alcohol and drugs.</P>
<P>2) A stripper arrives. After entertaining the group for a few minutes,
she heads into the bathroom with Michael for a particularly frisky round
of wall-slamming sex. Unfortunately, Michael forces her against the wall
in a hazardous place, impaling the stripper on a towel hook. After
informing the other four about the accident, Adam suggests they call the
police. Boyd steps forward  and recaps the situation, saying they would
all be risking jail time if they told the authorities. He suggests Plan
B: take the stripper out in the middle of the desert, and bury her where
no one will ever know. Or, as Boyd puts it: `We have a 105 pound problem
that we have to get from point A to point B.'</P>
<P>3) The group decides to bury the body in the desert, just as hotel
security knocks on the door. After entering, the guard notices the
stripper in the reflection of a mirror. He runs to check the girl's
pulse, and the others hover around the door in frightened shock. But
Boyd grabs a corkscrew from the counter and stabs the guard twice in the
chest, blocking the doorway as he bleeds to death in the bathroom. Now,
as Boyd informs them, they have two bodies to dispose of.</P>
<P>4) But first, a trip to the grocery store, where certain items (shovels,
plastic bags, etc.) are picked up. The group returns to the hotel, where
they clean up the blood spattered bathroom. Boyd, using an electric
turkey carver, hacks up the bodies so they can be transported by
suitcase and buried in the desert. The spare parts are sealed in plastic
wrap, and the five take off to finish the deed.</P>
<P>If you think this is almost unbearable after reading about it, I
wouldn't suggest you watch the movie. Actually, there is much more to
the story after the friends return home, and attempt to carry on their
lives in petrified horror. Stern, in particular, does a marvelously
convincing job of portraying a middle-aged good Samaritan who
experiences a gradual mental breakdown. The scene involving his
frustrated desperation to find `Whizzers' in a convenience store (for
his screaming kids) is extremely funny, as Adam's paranoia gets away
from him.</P>
<P>Some people may not find this funny at all. But I found that director
Peter Berg (an actor, best known from Chicago Hope) nicely draws the
line to prevent this from toppling over into a macabre horror movie. The
occasional scene is perfectly realized, and you laugh (sometimes in
disbelief) at the lengths Berg has taken this outlandish situation.
There are standout performances from Stern, Slater (on a highly
believable psychopath auto-pilot) and Ellen's Jeremy Piven. For the main
protagonist, Favreau is almost too bland and lifeless for the movie
surrounding him.</P>
<P>As I expected, the formula doesn't last for the running time.
Character's actions get out of hand, and Berg runs out of clever detours
to take. But when Very Bad Things is good, it's excellent - capturing
some of the finest black comedy ever caught on screen. Or maybe `black'
is too light a word...</P>
