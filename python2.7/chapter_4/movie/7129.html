<PRE>                             PRIVATE PARTS
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                     Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: WNBC's all-the-stops-out shock jock
          tells us the story of his life and stars in the
          film adaptation of his own autobiography.  Mostly
          it is his side of the battles he fought to get and
          keep his brand of crude humor on the radio in spite
          of his management and at times the FCC.  Stern's
          antics are often funny, but the basic situation of
          the irreverent rebel against the dictatorial
          authority is well-trodden territory.  Rating: +1 (-
          4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 13 positive, 2 negative, 4 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Howard Stern will do just about anything to be funny on the radio
from having guests strip naked (could anything be more pointless in
this medium!), having another stick a thirteen inch kielbasa down her
throat, inducing a listener to have an orgasm from the vibration of her
woofer, and making dead fetus jokes the day after his wife's
miscarriage.  His humor is not so much off-color as two counties away
from being even near- color.  PRIVATE PARTS is his autobiography in
book form and the film based on the book.  Except for his personal
style of gags the plot is of how his straight-laced management at his
various jobs tried to tone him down and how he always reacted by
becoming even more of the Bad Boy of Radio.  This basic conflict is the
same sort of thing we saw in NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE,
MEATBALLS, STRIPES, and GHOSTBUSTERS.  Since each of those films was
either produced or directed by Ivan Reitman, it should come as no
surprise that he produced PRIVATE PARTS also.</P>
<P>     As the film Howard Stern (played by Howard Stern) opens is
performing a stage act as Fartman in a pair of pants tailored to leave
his butt cheeks exposed.  As Stern walks back stage he worries that his
humor is not appreciated by others as he gets disapproving stares from
other performers.  To a woman sitting next to him on a plane, he begins
to recount his life, told in a flashback.  We start with Stern as a
cute child with a father who seems constantly angry.  Starting as a
geeky teenager and then as a geeky adult (who looks a lot like Weird Al
Yankovic), he goes from one radio job to the next fighting
unsympathetic management and territorial fellow disk jockeys.  At first
he is usually the victim of these conflicts, and he drifts through jobs
in one city after another.  Stern finds himself in larger and larger
conflicts culminating in his being hired at New York City's WNBC whom
we are told hired him only on the basis of his high ratings at his
previous job at a Washington DC radio station.  When they found out the
nature of his radio program they decide it is necessary to tame him.
But in a series of battles Stern always wins eventually because he is
so popular with the listeners.</P>
<P>     Howard Stern could conceivably be a good actor with the right sort
of material, but here he is cast hopelessly against type.  He never
seems get much of a handle on his character and without an
understanding of what makes someone like Howard Stern tick, he seems to
be just going through the motions.  Along the way Stern picks up the
rest of his comedy team including his female straight man, Robin
Quivers playing herself.  Quivers is charming as is Mary McCormack as
Stern's long suffering and ever-perfect wife Alison.  Holding his own
for the comic drive of the film is Paul Giamatti as the NBC executive
who has vowed to tame Stern and who, at least to hear Stern tell it, is
hopelessly outclassed by the classless Stern.</P>
<P>     Ironically with all the sexist and sexual humor, the film was
directed by a woman, Betty Thomas (who some will remember played Lucy
Bates in "Hill Street Blues").  This is a cotton candy film, light,
pleasant, but without much substance and what little there is made to
go a long way.  If there is not a whole lot to think about here, at
least the film moves well and is entertaining.  Probably people not
offended by the style of humor will enjoy the show.  This is the kind
of film that generates from critics a lot of positive votes but not a
lot of enthusiasm.  I rate is a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
