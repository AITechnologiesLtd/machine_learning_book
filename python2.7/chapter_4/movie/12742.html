<PRE>FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>This is not a movie for everyone.  Its intense surrealistic drug imagery
is at once intriguing and revolting.  The film doesn't have a strong
point, but it tells it vividly and with an intense visual flair.</P>
<P>Johnny Depp stars as journalist Hunter S. Thompson (going under the
alias Raoul Duke).  In early 1971, he is given an assignment to travel
to Las Vegas and cover the Mint 400, a motorcycle race in the desert. He
hooks up with his attorney, Oscar Acosta (Benicio Del Toro) aka Dr.
Gonzo, and together they plan to visit Vegas on one of the most intense
drug and booze benders the world has ever seen.</P>
<P>Riding in a fire apple red convertible at top speed across the desert,
and with a trunk full of nearly every dangerous illegal drug imaginable,
the pair enter Las Vegas, where possession of mere marijuana carries a
20-year prison term.  But they don't let little things like laws or
societal norms stand in the way of hitting their psychedelic highs.</P>
<P>If the film has a statement, it is a portrayal of the aftermath of the
60s.  Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo are no longer heroes of a people's
revolution, but merely the distorted and discarded flotsam and jetsam of
time.  The purpose of the sixties had reached its final resting place:
the ultimate indulgence of self-gratification.</P>
<P>The film doesn't quite have a plot.  The shreds of one are lost in the
haze of the protagonists' drug induced stupor.  Instead, the film plays
as a series of vignettes detailing the steady descent from normality
into utter depravity.</P>
<P>More of a surreal experience than a movie, the film does manage to
capture the stream-of-consciousness feeling of Thompson's book. Whether
or not that is a good thing depends on your own particular tolerances.</P>
<P>A few of the sequences in the movie drag on a bit long, and the film
treads a thin line with its humor.  That humor comes in two varieties:
watching the hallucinating fools do foolish things, and observing the
clash between the normal Vegas folk and the drug fiends.  The former is
amusing at first, but quickly wears out its welcome...however, there's
enough of the latter to prop up the movie in its weak spots.</P>
<P>Johnny Depp is playing a broad caricature here, but he manages to make
the character interesting.  Benicio Del Toro goes deep into character...
so deep that he's hardly recognizable in the film. The rest of the film
is flooded with cameos by everyone from Cameron Diaz and Christina Ricci
to Ellen Barkin and Gary Busey. Even Penn Jilette and Lyle Lovett pop up
here and there.</P>
<P>If you enjoyed the book, you'll find the movie about as good an
adaptation as you could hope for.  If the description in this review
didn't sound the slightest bit intriguing...this film is not for you.
Whatever the case, if you see the film, you'll never look at hotel
carpeting the same way again.</P>
