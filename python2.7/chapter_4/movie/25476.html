<P>I've had slightly over a week to consider "Three to Tango", and the 
realisation hits me that it must not be called useless. This is a movie that 
will satisfy the curiosity of anyone wondering what it's like to be stuck in 
the cold next to a drunken alien at a bus stop for an hour and a half, who 
laughs at his own bad jokes despite the fact they don't have logical 
progression or punch lines.</P>
<P>I myself have never fantasised about that particular experience, and 
therefore found the movie an ordeal. The plot has nothing to do with aliens, 
but might as well have done, so strange are the actions of its humans. 
Matthew Perry stars as Oskar Novak, an architect asked by a millionaire 
client (Dylan McDermott) to make sure his mistress (Neve Campbell) doesn't 
get up to any mischief when out of sight. McDermott feels safe in this 
because he thinks that Perry is gay.</P>
<P>What we have here is yet another example of what James Blish called the Idiot 
Plot -- a story that would be over in a second if anybody in it had an 
inkling of brainpower. Dialogue tortuously contrives to avoid stumbling on 
the obvious truth that Perry ain't homosexual. McDermott and Campbell 
inexplicably laugh him off when he tries to clear matters up. And then later 
Perry gives a newspaper interview about the difficulties of being a gay 
professional -- why??</P>
<P>Much of the humour in "Three to Tango" is based around misunderstandings. 
Aside from the central dilemma, there are countless scenes where people 
mistake innocent suggestions for sexual propositions, such as when a 
secretary overhears Perry and his business associate (Oliver Platt) tell each 
other "We're partners, and proud of it!", or Perry when idly asks a guy at a 
party "What are you doing later?" Ho, ho, ho. This sort of thing could have 
been made funny in the 1930s, when there was more of a naivete to cinema, but 
now that trends of filmmaking and acting edge so much closer to realism, 
onscreen stupidity is rarely amusing and often embarrassing.</P>
<P>Nothing in "Three to Tango" makes sense. It's weird. Perry gets home to find 
Platt dancing around his apartment, sniffing his fingers and displaying a 
spiky hairdo. "What are you doing?" Perry asks. Platt's answer: "I was 
bored!"  Previously, we opened on shot of them walking down a street chanting 
animal noises, to psyche themselves up for work. The most inane moment comes 
when Perry runs through town, chickens are thrown at him from offscreen, by 
no one, for no reason. He stops, looks at the camera, and carries on running. 
What was going on in the mind of the director when he ordered those chickens 
thrown? Did he really think it would have us rolling in the ailes?</P>
<P>I will resist making a cheap crack about the main actors being television 
stars, because they've done good work in movies before, and there's just no 
opportunity for them to breathe life into this indefensible material. One 
more oddity to wonder about, though: where does the title come from? There 
are either two or five main characters, depending on how you look at it, but 
not three. I can picture the story conferences, where savvy executives no 
doubt realised that if they were going to greenlight a project in which 
nothing made sense, it couldn't do any more harm to name it after an 
unrelated song.</P>
