<PRE>                         CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER returns Harrison Ford to the screen as
Jack Ryan (PATRIOT GAMES), now taking over as the Deputy Director for
Intelligence of the CIA from James Earl Jones.  Unfortunately for him,
the President of the United States, played by Donald Moffat, is once
again planning an illegal war, and Ryan is supposed to be the fall
guy.</P>
<P>     This is a conventional spy-thriller, as you'd expect.  I found it
a little bit boring towards the end.  Somehow this kind of action film
doesn't seem to me to be quite suitable for Ford, though he's played
them often enough.  I'm thinking of THE FUGITIVE, where Ford and the
bad guy, both middle-aged, spend fifteen minutes or so running around
bashing each other.  Something very much like that happens again here.
It's like watching those B-grade sci-fi flicks of the Fifties, made
with plastic-model dinosaurs, which always seem to move with jerky
slowness, even when they're trying to bite each other's arms off.</P>
<P>     The thing I liked best about this film is Anne Archer, who plays
Ryan's wife in a small role.  She's aging, beautifully.  There are not
many roles for middle-aged women anywhere; they get discarded once they
can no longer play someone in their twenties, regardless of how
talented they are (Meryl Streep), as stewardesses used to be.  I'm
happy Anne Archer, at least has found a part she to which she can bring
her elegant beauty for at least a few more years.</P>
<P>     Willem Dafoe puts in a nice turn as the ambiguously evil
free-lance CIA operative who runs the war.  But I would've preferred
Chuck Norris in this role.  After all, we know Dafoe can play this kind
of part, can Norris?  He would've fit the action-hero scenes better,
too.</P>
<P>     Harrison Ford doesn't get to use his trademark confused-intensity
look here much.  He says it himself, "I hate this job."  He's supposed
to be much more of a direct-action type here than he was, say, in
PATRIOT GAMES, where his family was at risk.  His only conflict is over
loyalty to the President, which is oddly downplayed in Philip Royce's
direction (given that its the only source of dramatic conflict.)  As a
result, he just doesn't have that much to be confused about.  Pity.</P>
<P>     The script is about average for this kind of film.  I've given up
expecting great attention to detail; it just doesn't seem to be an
issue anymore.  For example, when Ryan buys something expensive, you'd
think that no one in the world has ever gone to a South American
country pretending to be associated with the CIA and trying to get
something for nothing, or South Americans are unbelievably stupid.  Or
the nonsense about breaking into computers, or a scene which reminded
me of the joke about a blackmailer handing his intended victim an
incriminating photograph: "Be careful, that's the only copy I've got."</P>
<P>     Overall, it's an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours, but
not a terribly entertaining way.  It's not as good as TRUE LIES, though
you may find yourself put off by TRUE LIES tongue-in-cheek approach to
spy thrillers (though I didn't.)  This is meat-and-potatoes fare,
served up a little too cold.</P>
