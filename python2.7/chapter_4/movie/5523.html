<PRE>(1986) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        HANNAH AND HER SISTERS is an intricate, well thought-
out ensemble drama from Woody Allen, who began with this movie 
a string of adult dramas like CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, 
SEPTEMBER and ANOTHER WOMAN. This one follows the loves 
and ambitions of one extended family, all of whom are connected 
by a woman named Hannah (Mia Farrow). Michael Caine, her 
current husband (and probably the only man who looks goofier 
than Woody Allen), is infatuated with Hannah's sister Lee (Barbara 
"Collagen Lips" Hershey), who is married to a moody artist (Max 
von Sydow).</P>
<P>        Then you've got the two other sisters, Holly (perennial 
Allen favorite Diane Wiest) and April (Carrie Fisher), in 
competition for the same man, along with Farrow's ex-husband 
(Allen), the hypochondriac producer of a sketch comedy show 
(In a rare moment that reveals a little too much of Woody, he 
complains about a sketch that the censors have ordered cut, 
wondering why they could be so narrow-minded, when his head 
writer Julie Kavner replies, "Child molestation is a very touchy 
subject.) who comes face to face with death and eternity when 
he finds out he may have a brain tumor.</P>
<P>        As if all these story lines weren't enough, Allen manages 
to work in a few of his customary flashbacks, one a scene in which 
he and Mia find out he's infertile and have to ask two of their best 
friends if they wouldn't mind donating some sperm for a worthy 
cause, and the other a comic sequence of a blind date from hell with 
Allen and Wiest. The latter is loaded with the usual Woody Wit and 
figures into the plot toward the end, the former is unnecessary and 
is never resolved. We see the friends react in disgust at the 
comment, "All you have to do is masturbate into a cup" (which 
Woody would no doubt videotape), but later we find out Woody 
and Mia had two kids together. Who's the father, out of curiosity?</P>
<P>        Although the whole sperm storyline is out of place, the 
others are delicately balanced so that we retain interest in all of 
them as they develop and eventually intertwine. Allen has an 
obvious talent for juggling multiple story lines even if the 
resolutions for some of them aren't ideal. In HANNAH AND 
HER SISTERS, he tackles his familiar topics of adultery and the 
philosophical mysteries of life as his character receives a reprieve 
and gets a new lease on life for only a little while before realizing 
death is still inevitable and life is still as meaningless as ever. 
He tries to convert to Catholicism and later Hari Krishna, but to 
no avail. Only Woody could make so many serious points about 
an issue like that while also keeping the comedy going. HANNAH 
AND HER SISTERS marked the beginning of a new era of large 
scale seriousness in comedy from Mr. Allen.</P>
