<PRE>                          THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD
                       A film review by Thomas Wheeler
                        Copyright 1995 Thomas Wheeler</PRE>
<P>     As with CASPER, I went to THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD uncertain of
what to expect, and not really expecting a whole lot.  It looked
amusing, and certainly interesting from a special effects standpoint,
and it was based on a British children's story book, many of which are
wonderful adventures (I recommend the original version of 101
DALMATIANS to anyone).</P>
<P>     And, as with CASPER, the movie far, *far* exceeded my
expectations.  THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD is a truly wonderful,
marvelous, and magical adventure.  For those unfamiliar with the story,
a young boy named Omri receives, among other birthday presents, an
antique cupboard and a small plastic Indian.  Placing the Indian in the
cupboard (!) and locking it with a special key somehow (and they never
explain how, but this isn't "Star Trek," people--they don't *have* to
explain) brings the Indian to life.  Or more accurately, brings a
miniaturized Iroquois Indian named Little Bear to the cupboard. (I have
to say, it makes you wonder if there's a six-foot plastic Indian out
there in the past someplace after that).</P>
<P>     Omri soon learns a number of lessons, *none* of which are, thank
God, crammed down the audience's throat.  One is that such a wonder as
this cupboard must be treated carefully, as he learns when he crams
Darth Vader, a G.I. Joe, Robocop, a Jurassic Park dinosaur, and a Star
Trek Ferengi and Cardassian in the cupboard, and miniaturized chaos
ensues for a truly hysterical multiple cameo.</P>
<P>     Omri also learns that the little Indian must be treated with care
and respect.  It's a person, not a toy.  It's a lesson that Omri's
friend is a little slow to pick up on, as this youngster brings a
cowboy and horse to life.  But even he learns eventually.</P>
<P>     There are subtle lessons on friendship, respect, life and death,
all woven through the picture, but none pounded over your head.  You're
left with, as I said, a truly wonderful and magical adventure whose
special effects are just as carefully and subtly woven throughout the
movie.  If you've got kids, go see it.  If you don't have kids, go see
it anyway.  I don't, and I still enjoyed it.</P>
