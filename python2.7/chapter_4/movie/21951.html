<P>The Blair Witch Project   Dirs: Edward Sanchez and Daniel Myrick. Starring
Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard.</P>
<P>The pitch: Three student filmmakers disappear in the forests of rural
Maryland while shooting a documentary about the legendary Blair Witch. A
year later, their footage is found.</P>
<P>This no-budget faux documentary was hyped last summer as the scariest movie
ever made. Don't believe it. Creepy, yes. Scary? See Hitchcock's Psycho.
Blair Witch is mainly nauseating, since the shaky, hand-held camerawork will
make some viewers wish they'd brought a bottle of Dramamine to go with the
popcorn.</P>
<P>The brilliant gimmick behind Blair Witch can be found in the synergy between
the movie and a detailed web site developed by co-director Sanchez. More
than a year ago he posted an elaborate back story about the legend of the
witch, dating to the 18th century. Thanks to market saturation, now almost
everyone knows that this is a work of fiction, an exploitation film, really,
that may eventually become the most profitable movie ever made. The
directors let their actors film the picture during an eight-day shoot in the
forests of a Maryland state park. The result is amateurish at times -- itchy
and scratchy to be sure -- but that's precisely the point. Realism is the
movie's strong suit.</P>
<P>Heather, Josh and Mike think they're terribly cool. And Heather, for one, is
wrapped a little too tight for her own good. She's pushy as hell and that's
what gets the trio in trouble. Making constant quips and mocking the locals
they've come to interview, the students are quite impressed with themselves
and Heather's project – to shoot a documentary tracing the lore of a
murderous spirit. The Blair Witch has supposedly been haunting the woods of
Burkittesville, Md., for two centuries. Heather, the director, keeps a
chronicle of the behind-the-scenes story, shooting everything they say and
do with her Hi8 videocamera. Josh handles the 16mm camera, shooting black
and white film. Mike wields the digital audio tape recorder. Their skills
with film equipment contrast sharply with their incompetence in the woods.</P>
<P>After interviewing the local yahoos about the witch, they venture into the
forest and are lost within a day. About the same time they discover their
predicament, someone or something begins stalking them. Strange totems
appear outside their tent in the morning. Soon they are rabid with fear,
living like hunted animals.</P>
<P>To tell more would be unfair. The buildup to the shocks is slow and
sometimes tedious, as the directors seem to be padding out their footage to
get the picture up to feature length (it runs a scant 82 minutes). But when
the ride starts, grab something and hang on. Ultimately, Blair Witch
succeeds on the basis of what it doesn't show us. The terror builds in our
imaginations as we wonder what is out there, just beyond the range of
Heather's camcorder light. Obviously something terrible will happen – we
know that much from the opening titles. The suspense comes from wondering
what will happen.</P>
<P>The final image, though ambiguous, becomes meaningful if careful attention
is paid during the first half-hour. Subtle clues are peppered throughout the
picture, although there is no definitive explanation before the credits
roll. Stick around after the film. On video, the directors have added about
five minutes of `newly discovered' footage, which consists of the actors
yakking in their tent at night. The conversation is clearly intended to
offer more clues about what happened to Heather, Josh and Mike, though it's
still far from concrete.</P>
<P>Some viewers will not be satisfied by the vague ending. We think there's a
different problem altogether (hey, if this movie can play games with
reality, then so can we): Filmmakers who go into the woods on a witch hunt
ought to have enough sense to pack heat and extra ammo. At Cinema Uprising,
our motto is `be prepared.' If the Blair Witch came a-creeping in the night,
and tried to unzip our tent, well, by gawd we'd be ready. `Say hello to Mr.
9mm,' we'd tell the old hag, or whatever the hell is slinking through the
forest, disturbing our sleep. And pop, pop, pop: No mo' witch. We might not
have enough footage for a feature-length film, but we'd come back with a
cool short subject. And a trophy for the den. Problem is, most campers just
aren't ready for an extended stay in the wilderness. So we wind up with
these herky-jerky horror films instead.</P>
<P>As such, Blair Witch delivers several good jolts for viewers who can stick
with it through the slow beginning. Its real triumph, though, is an
exploration of group dynamics – how three friends slowly unravel in the
woods and turn on each other, clamoring to get away.</P>
<P>Rated R for language. No gore, no onscreen violence, minimal blood.</P>
