<P>_American_History_X_ (R) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>"A Tony Kaye film."  "Directed by Tony Kaye."  Whether he likes it or not,
after a still-developing war of words (and very expensive trade ads) with
the higher-ups at New Line Cinema and the Directors Guild, the embattled
first-time feature director has his name on the credits of the release cut
of _American_History_X_.  Much has been made of the issues of artistic
integrity and free speech, but precious little has been made of the film
itself--except that, according to Kaye, it no longer reflects his original
vision.  I do not know what exactly Kaye had in mind for his _X_, but the
film I saw, flawed though it may be, definitely works on its own merits. </P>
<P>The main reason for the film's effectiveness the impassioned work of
Edward Norton.  He stars as Derek Vinyard, a young man who turns to a
racist gang after his firefighter father is murdered.  Head shaven and with
a swastika tattooed to his chest, Derek is hate incarnate, and his rage
leads to the brutal murder of two black men and a prison sentence.  After
three years, Derek emerges from prison a changed man, determined to let go
of a violent life that, of course, won't so easily let go of him.  It's a
formulaic character progression, but Norton's intensity makes it fresh and
involving.  His depth and nuance convincingly meshes his character's two
sides: utterly despicable and chilling as the skinhead Derek and
sympathetic but--crucially--no less edgy, as the post-prison Derek.</P>
<P>The character of Derek and his personal journey are riveting, but less so
are writer David McKenna's additional narrative touches--namely the focal
relationship between younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong), who idolizes
his brother and appears headed down the same destructive path of hate.
Derek's attempts to steer Danny in the right direction is the central
dramatic issue, but there's no real tension.  Danny is less a character
than a plot device, with no clearly defined personality trait other than
his emulation of his brother, thus there's very little suspense as to
whether or not Danny will change.</P>
<P>While Kaye has disassociated himself from all aspects of the film, one
other thing his name is attached to aside from the direction is the
cinematography, and he does a stunning job.  The story mostly unfolds in
flashback, with Derek's despicable actions and brutal prison experience
shown in black-and-white--no doubt a visual extension of the race theme.
But the absence of full color also lends the more violent scenes an added
roughness, and, in turn, a heightened sense of reality.</P>
<P>_American_History_X_ ends on a fairly predictable note, but the resolution
effectively reinforces the film's strong anti-hate, anti-violence message.
Perhaps in Kaye's editing hands the film would have been more well-rounded,
less formulaic, and, as such, more powerful and profound.  Alas, as it
currently stands, the incendiary _X_, for all its faults, still makes a
lasting, thought-provoking impression.  (opens October 30)</P>
