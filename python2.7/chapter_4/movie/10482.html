                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
                        Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: *** (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>Easily the most anticipated, most delayed film release of 1997, James
Cameron's $220 million "Titanic" steams into theaters with a slew of
questions to answer, most notably was it worth the wait, the hype, and all
that money?</P>
<P>Well.  "Titanic" is big, that's for sure.  The size and scope of the
production are evidenced by a massive, detailed replica of the White Star
liner, impressive visual effects, countless extras, and a love story
transcending the Atlantic ocean itself.  That, plus the fact that the
storyline is played out over three and a quarter hours, and we're talking
epic proportions here.</P>
<P>"Titanic," alas, doesn't quite live up to its promise or its
much-ballyhooed pricetag.  But it's an entertainment on a grand scale
nonetheless.</P>
<P>Water-bound dramas are rarely without their production problems.  Cameron's
own "The Abyss" had its fair share, and those dogging "Waterworld" (prior
to "Titanic," the most expensive movie in Hollywood history) are legendary.
On "Titanic," it's clear that Cameron the get-it-right-and-budget-be-damned
director fairs far better than Cameron the sounds-about-right screenwriter.
While the ship sinks convincingly and spectacularly enough, leads Leonardo
DiCaprio and Kate Winslet get saddled with lots of cornball situations and
dialogue.  Cameron's trump card was to make "Titanic" first and foremost a
love story.  However, his straightforward approach to that fateful night on
April 15th, 1912 lends itself better to his visual overtures than his
romantic undertones.</P>
<P>DiCaprio plays Jack Dawson, a freewheeling, penniless (are there any other
kind?) artist from steerage who's smitten by Winslet's Rose DeWitt Bukater,
a stifled society damsel from the upper decks.  Cameron paints the haves
and the have-nots a little too black and white--the rich are all stuffy,
boring snots while the poor are the only ones who really know how to have
fun--but on the darker side, Billy Zane is particularly good as Rose's
suave, callous fiancé Cal Hockley.</P>
<P>Of the innumerable versions of this ocean-going tragedy, this one might be
the first to imply that the Titanic hit the iceberg because its lookouts
were distracted by a couple making out on deck.</P>
<P>However, even at its epic length, "Titanic" is never boring.  Time skips by
quickly, and there are more than a few decent supporting performances to
enjoy, including Frances Fisher (as Rose's disapproving mother Ruth) and
Bernard Hill, in an underwritten role as the ship's ineffectual captain.</P>
<P>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film occurs during its
present-day setup, when a rugged salvage expert (played by Bill "We're
toast, man!" Paxton) has one of his staff explain, via a fascinating
computer animation, how the ship went down in the icy waters of the North
Atlantic, sending 1,500 of its 2,200 passengers and crew to their deaths.
All this, of course, is represented in larger-than-life Cameron-a-rama
later in the film, when the tragedy of 1912 is stunningly recreated.</P>
<P>At this point in "Titanic," DiCaprio and Winslet take a back seat to the
spectacle and, like the rest of us, hang on for dear life.</P>
