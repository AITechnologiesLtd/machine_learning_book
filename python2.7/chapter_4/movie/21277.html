<P>I'm not going to lie to you.  Just the very thought of Mrs. Dalloway
sent shivers down my spine.  It's a period costume drama (Strike One).
It stars Vanessa Redgrave (Strike Two).  It's based on a Virginia Woolf
novel (Strike Three).  Still, I kept my mind relatively open.</P>
<P>The title character, played by Redgrave (Julia), is a snooty old
socialite.  She wakes up on the morning of her big party and won't
frigging shut up about it for a second.  Then, she finds out that Peter,
an ex-suitor from about 100 years ago, happens to be in town on the very
same day.  Apparently, Dalloway has always questioned her decision to
marry her current husband instead of this Peter.  The trouble is that
they're all a bunch of corpses now, so who really gives a crap?</P>
<P>There is also another story line about a shell-shocked war hero who
perpetually thinks that he is seeing a guy named Evans blown to bits
right in front of him.  That's right.  Explosions.  Smack dab in the
middle of this frighteningly boring story.  My guess is that the
explosions were put in to wake the sleeping viewer and, I'll have you
know that my neck snapped up so hard that my glasses almost flew off.
That's powerful filmmaking!</P>
<P>The only bright spot radiated from Natascha McElhone (The Devil's Own),
who played the young Dalloway in a series of mind-numbing flashbacks.
It was still hard to enjoy her, knowing that she would grow up and
become the annoying bird that can only seem to fixate on her party and
how any number of uncontrollable sources could effect its success.  And
you just know there's going to be a big dance scene.  YAY!</P>
<P>So, I'm basically saying that I really enjoyed Mrs. Dalloway and that
the people who are responsible for making it should not be killed or
harmed in any way.  Or something…</P>
