Susan Granger's review of "VELVET GOLDMINE" (Miramax Films)</PRE>
<P>Set in the sex-and-drug London music scene of the '70s, this
surreal, sensual musical romance divided critics at the Cannes Film
Festival but won film-maker Todd Haynes a special prize from the jury
for best artistic contribution. The sheer glitter and glitz of its
energetic soundtrack may lure hip movie-goers, along with its MTV
rock-video approach to film-making. Presented in an ambitious
pseudo-documentary style, lifted from Orson Welles' "Citizen Kane,"
it's the story of a fictional glam rocker, Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys
Meyers) who, in a publicity stunt in 1974 while at the height of his
popularity, faked an assassination attempt on his life. When the hoax
was revealed, his career evaporated as his disillusioned fans
abandoned him. Ten years later, a British journalist and former fan
(Christian Bale) goes searching for Slade and interviews his former
lover, a flamboyant star (charismatic Ewan McGregor), and former wife
(Toni Collette). Problem is: Orson Welles' classic 1941 mystery
revolving about the motivations of a wealthy publishing tycoon had
intriguing characters, while Todd Haynes' androgynous pop-idol has
little to reflect upon except a short life of promiscuous bisexuality
and decadent excess. "We set out to change the world," McGregor muses,
"and ended up changing only ourselves." The message of the movie is
simply: "It doesn't matter what a man does with his life. What matters
is the legend that grows up around him." On the other hand, the visual
presentation is colorful, splashy and splendid. So, on the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Velvet Goldmine" is a frenetic 6. Caution:
its sexual content, nudity, profanity, and drug usage make it
unacceptable for most of the young teenage audience at whom it's
directly aimed.</P>
