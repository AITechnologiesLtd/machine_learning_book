<PRE>He Got Game
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) When he's on his mark, Spike Lee is one of America's most
evocative directors. The look and sound of a well-made scene can make you
nostalgic for a time and place you've never experienced. </P>
<P>DO THE RIGHT THING put the audience right in the Bedford-Stuyvesant
neighborhood of Brooklyn on the hottest day of summer in 1989.HE GOT GAME
puts us in Coney Island during a May weekend in 1998. Lee's decision to use
Aaron Copland music for the score to HE GOT GAME is unexpected, and the
results are surprisingly effective. The music takes the Coney Island story
and makes it representative of the whole nation. And why not? Basketball is
as American as George Washington, apple pie and Aaron Copland. The daring
decision proves that Lee's instincts are very good when it comes to evoking
a time and place. </P>
<P>School's almost out. High School kids are thinking about graduation and
college. One kid in particular, Jesus Shuttlesworth (that's "Jee-zus", not
"Hay-soos", played pretty well by Ray Allen, an NBA athlete), has to decide
which of the many scholarships he will accept. The whole country is waiting
for his decision because he is the best high school basketballer in the
country. </P>
<P>Shuttlesworth the elder (Denzel Washington) is in prison for the murder of
his wife. He is promised a quick parole if he can convince his son to sign
with the governor's alma mater. He's strapped to a radio transmitter and
released to find and convince his son. Jesus gave up on his father long ago
and wants nothing to do with him, making Shuttlesworth's task all the more
difficult. </P>
<P>There are myriad relationships in HE GOT GAME, fraught with all sorts of
almost melodramatic conflict. No two people meet without having some sort of
deeper relationship. For this, Spike Lee should be praised. In lesser films,
characters share the screen but exist in different universes - they trade
dialogue but they don't really talk to each other. </P>
<P>Not so in this film. For example, Shuttlesworth runs into some of Jesus'
friends. We know all of the characters on screen, but they have never met
each other. Everyone involved is motivated by the same objective - to do
what's best for Jesus - but they interact with a certain amount of hostility
and mistrust. Shuttlesworth suspects the youths of golddigging, and they
know of Jesus' hatred for his father. The characters are solid in their
integrity. Nobody is played up as "the bad guy" because each person is true
to what they know about Jesus. We may be frustrated that they can't
cooperate, but the characters are rightly jealous and mistrustful.  </P>
<P>However, the relationship that matters most in this film, that of Jesus and
his dad, feels contrived. The betrayed son and overbearing father are more
icons than characters. Some twist in their predictable relationship would
have made them more real, more human. A small deviation from the
stereotypical father-son conflict could have given the movie more
credibility, and could have even added an element of irony, which would have
helped a lot. Instead, we quickly recognize these archetypes and then,
having identified them, dismiss them. </P>
<P>Relationships aside, some of the characters suffer from Spike Lee's
cynicism. Bill Nunn plays one such character. Nunn (who was great as the
sullen, stubborn Radio Raheem in DO THE RIGHT THING) is Jesus' golddigging
uncle, whose only apparent interest in the boy is the money he feels he is
owed for bringing up the Shuttlesworth children IN LOCO PARENTIS. The prison
warden (acting on behalf of the governor) is another. The warden and
governor manipulate and toy with Shuttlesworth for the apparent sole reason
that Lee's wants his filmed world to be cruel. </P>
<P>If one insists on crediting these characters with motives, then they must be
unbelievably selfish or inexplicably evil. But these characters are not
handled as motivated people, they are handled as obstacles in the
Shuttlesworth environment. The presence of these two-dimensional characters
only draws attention to the fact that many of the other characters were much
better developed. It's an unfortunate aspect to a movie with lots of potential. </P>
<P>One final comment is worth mentioning. Without giving anything away, I can
say that Lee made another daring but effective decision in making the final
scene mystical and metaphoric (with the added pomp of Copland's score). If I
had liked the body of the movie better, the ending would have been as
interesting and as perfect as the ending to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY or the
ending to BREAKING THE WAVES. The ending was still interesting and touching,
but because the movie wasn't as grand as it set out to be, the ending felt a
little self-indulgent on Lee's part. </P>
<P>Spike Lee's DO THE RIGHT THING was excellent. Ever since then, his films
have captured some of that excellence in part, but never the quality of the
whole. HE GOT GAME is great for looking at a sense of time and place and at
the web of relationships that describes the community in the film, reasons
enough for setting this film above many others. But gaps in other
departments keep this Spike Lee Joint from being another masterpiece.</P>
