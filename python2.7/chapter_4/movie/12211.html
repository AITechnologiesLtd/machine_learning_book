<PRE>The Big Hit (1998)
1/2 *
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Dumb dud of an HK-clone action movie that isn't satirical enough to
be funny. Walberg's fine; the rest is not.</P>
<P>The more I think about this movie, the more I hate it. THE BIG HIT is a loud,
obnoxious, and doltish-supposed-to-be-funny attempt at a Hollywood Hong Kong
shootsploitation movie that falls smack on its face on nearly every count.</P>
<P>Kirk Wong is the latest director (after Tsui Hark) to be dragged kicking and
screaming into Hollywood. His first U.S. film, THE BIG HIT, plays like a cheap
clone: it looks and smells like it was made by people who had *seen* a couple
of HK action movies, but had no idea how to be *inspired* by one.</P>
<P>Mark Walberg is a hitman who works with his cohorts (Bokeem Woodbine and Lou
Diamond Philips, both wasted) in the employ of a boss figure (played nicely by
Avery Brooks, but with a little too much saliva around the corners of the
mouth). They get into improbably complicated shootouts that, while exciting,
have no more real intrinsic interest than a video game. Targets pop up, get
wasted, get replaced. Reload. The movie also cheats pretty blatantly: one
moment involving Wahlberg appearing as if by magic in an elevator had everyone
groaning.</P>
<P>Wahlberg is strapped, no thanks to one girlfriend who's a gold-digger and
another who's determined to marry him no matter what anyone else says,
including her parents. He goes along with a kidnapping that's supposed to rake
them in a ton of money. Only trouble is, the father of the girl they kidnapped
is dead broke (like we couldn't see that coming) and is also the god-daughter
of their own boss.</P>
<P>All of this is nothing but fodder, however. The movie is a dreary mess. Bokeem
Woodbine's character is distinguished from the rest of the crew by his foul
mouth and his compulsive masturbation. The father of the kidnappee threw all
his money into a movie called "Taste the Golden Spray". One of the plot
elements is an overdue copy of KING KONG LIVES. I am not leaving out very much
here, nor do I think I want to.</P>
<P>Hong Kong movies are very adept at mixing and matching genres and tones
without seeming like a compromise. I think part of that is because, at least
when we deal with a movie of this caliber, there's never a moment when we know
we're supposed to take it seriously. THE BIG HIT keeps attempting to enlist
our emotions in lots of stupid little ways, and then throws in more obnoxious
sight gags. Nobody made a decision early on about what kind of movie they
really were making. If it was a parody, then we didn't need the shapeless and
distasteful material about the future in-laws (a pair of snotty Jewish-parent
stereotypes). If it was serious, then they should have wiped the slate clean
and started from scratch.</P>
<P>THE BIG HIT is not even enjoyably ridiculous. It's the kind of movie you feel
bad for renting with your beer, because you could have bought that much beer
for the cost of the rental and had a better time. I suspect the only reason I
didn't downgrade this film's rating even further was because I'd be wasting
too much venom on it.</P>
