<PRE>                        INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE
                       A film review by Nizam Ahmed
                        Copyright 1995 Nizam Ahmed</PRE>
<P>     INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE: THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES.  It doesn't
exactly trip off the tongue, does it?  Why the extraneous subtitle was
added I guess we will never know.  What we do know is that this film is
shortly to get its video release here in the UK.</P>
<P>     We all know about Anne Rice's horror as she realized her dark,
sexually ambiguous hero Lestat from her novels was to be played by Tom
Cruise, but it's hard to see what all the fuss is about.  Despite
having his name in lights above the movie poster, Cruise is nothing
more than a supporting role.  Brad Pitt plays Louis, the focus of the
film. as he recalls his centuries-old, unaging life to an interviewer
(Christian Slater).  He tells of his creation by another vampire,
Lestat, their life as they set up home together, his own creation of a
vampire "daughter" Claudia and his search in Paris for Lestat's
creator.  The story encompasses hundreds of years, and ends in the
present day.</P>
<P>     The whole structure of this film is S-L-O-W.  You really do get
the feeling that 300 years have passed when you leave the cinema!
Every camera shot, every scene is done majestically, taking in the
sumptuous sets, the fabulous scenery.  You can sense the sadness and
despair that immortal creatures would face, unable to die as everything
around them changes.  But this is also the main flaw of INTERVIEW WITH
THE VAMPIRE--if good production values are not what makes a film for
you, it's boring.</P>
<P>     Brad Pitt is apparently a "sex symbol."  Throughout this film, he
looks and acts more like Neil from THE YOUNG ONES.  He can't carry the
weight of the film alone, so it is up to the others to support him.
Cruise is good.  His strange manic energy fits his role, but a
ludicrous sequence which reminded me of a bad monster movie, with
Cruise coming back to life after multiple killings, ruined a good
character role.  Walking and talking with a body looking like charcoal
is a real credibility-loser.  Of the others, Kirsten Dunst who plays
Claudia is annoying, although that's probably how she was scripted, and
Antonio Banderas (Armand) is just another good-looking young actor
recruited to grab the punters.</P>
<P>     In fact, the whole thing reeks of marketing:
     "Hey, let's get three hunks together and cast them as vampires!"
"We could get Neil Jordan to direct and maybe pick up an Oscar or two!"
"Yeah, that would boost attendances, wouldn't it?"  "Quick! Let's get a
best selling novel and adapt it."  Any artistry that may have existed in
this production is muted by the sheer commercialism of it.  In the end,
you fail to see what it's trying to be.  A horror?  Not really.  A
drama?  Nah.  A romance maybe?  Hard to say.  Looks great, shame about
the story.</P>
