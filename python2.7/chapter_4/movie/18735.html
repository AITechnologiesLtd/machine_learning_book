THE CROW
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>There are some movies that present a rather difficult
dilemma towards the reviewers. Those dilemmas are often
associated with circumstances not directly related to the
film itself. One of the examples is THE CROW, 1994 dark
fantasy film directed by Alex Proyas. Instead of being
remembered by its own merit, this is film that will always
be associated with the tragedy that happened during its
shooting - the accident that claimed the life of its lead
actor, 28-year old Brandon Lee. As it usually happens with
stars who perish in their youths, they become immortal and
legend of THE CROW also grew from many rather sinister
coincidences. Brandon Lee was the only son of Bruce Lee,
legendary star of 1970s kung fu movies, whose death was also
premature. And the story of THE CROW is also macabre one,
based on dark underground comic book. All that ensured that
THE CROW would almost immediately get cult status, many
critics raved about it, and such status was kept for the
next five years. But now, we are faced with the question -
is it really worth it? Or is it cruel to trash movie for
whom some people literally gave their lives?</P>
<P>The plot of the film is rather simple one, and it shouldn't
surprise anyone, since it is based on a comic book by James
O'Barr. In Detroit, city that resembles dark, gothic visions
of Burton's BATMAN, night before Halloween is called
"Devil's Night" because local hoodlums, led by evil Top
Dollar (Michael Wincott), organise mass arsons in
residential areas. During one of such instances, rock
musician Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) is killed together with
his fiance in the eve of their wedding. But one year later,
the crow, which, according to legend, leads the souls of the
dead to another world, brings Eric back from the grave. Now
he is back on earth in order to make things right and avenge
his own death and the death of the loved ones. His revenge
would be witnessed through the eyes of Sarah (Rochelle
Davis), little girl who used to be Eric's friend.</P>
<P>Brandon Lee was killed before the movie had been finished,
and it shows in the final product. Filmmakers used variety
of techniques - stunt doubles, special shots and new,
computer-generated graphics - in order to hide that fact,
but those efforts, although very effective and commendable,
still failed. And, as a result, the main character - The
Crow - simply isn't as charismatic and effective as it
should have been. The screenplay by David J. Schow and John
Shirley did another disservice to his character, because it
provided him with corny, forgettable lines and made other,
minor characters, more memorable. Brandon Lee as an actor is
capable in his last role, although his action routines are
more effective than his acting. Still, this film showed that
he had a lot of potential, and the his death, in the light
of this fact, becomes even more tragic. The acting belongs
to minor actors, and this film features plenty of them -
Ernie Hudson as sympathetic detective, Michael Wincott,
Michael Massee, David Patrick Kelly and Jon Polito as
villains, Rochelle Davis as Sarah.</P>
<P>However, the acting can't hide the fact that this film is
less about story and characters and more about visuals and
atmosphere. Proyas, who had begun his career directing
videoclips (which became rather disdainful background these
days) employed a lot of talent in order to make this film
heavy with the dark atmosphere of gritty, rainy megalopolis
without hope for its inhabitans. This atmosphere is helped
with the very effective cinematography by Dariusz Wolski and
impressive musical score by Graeme Revell. On the other
hand, like many directors who came to Hollywood from
videoclip industry, Proyas has some problems in direction of
action scenes, especially when they engage more than few
characters. On the other hand, scenes of Crow's revenge on
individual villains are quite effective, although heavy
metal tunes often seem annoying.</P>
<P>So, finally, I can finish this review by stating that THE
CROW doesn't deserve its cult status. But, in the same time,
it must be praised as very good film, better than most of
the Hollywood products in comic book adaptation category.
And, last, but not least, THE CROW is more than sufficient
cinematic epitaph for Brandon Lee.</P>
