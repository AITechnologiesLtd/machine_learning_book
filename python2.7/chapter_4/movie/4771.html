<P>     When it comes to golf comedies (not a very popular genre, 
apparently), the film residing at the dubious pinnacle is Rodney 
Dangerfield's CADDYSHACK. HAPPY GILMORE, the new release featuring 
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE alum Adam Sandler, tries gamely to attain 
CADDYSHACK's level.  Alas, this picture just isn't on par with the 
passable 1980 farce.  Sandler's movie is worth a few laughs, but not 
many of the comic sequences are original, and even fewer are inspired.  </P>
<P>     I feel compelled to mention that this is undoubtedly Sandler's best 
outing to date.  However, considering the quality of his other films --
AIRHEADS, MIXED NUTS, and BILLY MADISON -- that's not an especially 
impressive statement.  Nevertheless, despite the mediocrity of HAPPY 
GILMORE, it's apparent that Sandler has some aptitude for physical 
comedy, which puts him on a significantly higher plane than, say, Pauly 
Shore.</P>
<P>     Actually, one of the biggest problems with HAPPY GILMORE is that it 
pretends to have a plot.  Sandler's comic skits would have worked better 
had they not been burdened by the silly, unnecessarily storyline that 
results in a lot of virtually intolerable tripe linking the funny parts 
together.  And, during the film's numerous golf matches, why are we 
forced to endure Verne Lundquist's inane voiceovers as he provides TV 
coverage?</P>
<P>     HAPPY GILMORE starts off like THE CUTTING EDGE on grass.  Happy is 
a hockey player at heart, but, since he can't play his favorite sport 
(he's not a very good skater), he tries his luck at golf.  One day, 
while bashing 400-foot drives at a driving range, the local pro (Carl 
Weathers) spots him and encourages him to enter a tournament.  The lure 
of big money attracts Happy -- not because he's greedy, but because he 
needs $275,000 to buy back his grandmother's house from the U.S. 
government.  Happy wins the tournament, and, as a result, joins the PGA 
tour, where he becomes an instant phenomenon.</P>
<P>     Along for the ride is a beautiful publicist (Julie Bowen), who 
becomes (surprise, surprise!) Happy's girlfriend; a haughty pro 
(Christopher McDonald), who is embarrassed by the presence of such an 
uncouth player on the tour; and a hulking fan (Richard Kiel, Jaws from 
THE SPY WHO LOVED ME and MOONRAKER), who's always ready to jump to 
Happy's defense.  Making cameos as themselves are Lee Travino and Bob 
Barker.  The latter provides one of the film's most-advertised moments 
as he gets into a nationally-televised brawl with Happy -- and wins.  </P>
<P>     Product placement is out-of-control, with every corporation from 
AT&T to Pepsi getting a mention (each fake golf tournament is 
"sponsored" by a real company).  In the most blatant motion picture 
advertising campaign since Sinbad hawked McDonalds in last year's 
HOUSEGUEST, Subway gets an interminable amount of screen time.  A little 
product placement is usually inoffensive; taken to these extremes, 
however, it becomes distracting.</P>
<P>     HAPPY GILMORE could have been a lot funnier.  As it is, at least it 
offers more to chuckle at than most of the dead-in-the-water "comedies" 
of early 1996.  And, thankfully, we're spared the flatulence jokes that 
have become the staple of many similar films (DUMB AND DUMBER comes to 
mind).  Nevertheless, irrespective of how many comic moments it 
provides, HAPPY GILMORE is still several strokes short of a respectable 
finish.</P>
