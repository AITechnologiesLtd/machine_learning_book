<P>     With the exception of one production aspect, ON HER MAJESTY'S 
SECRET SERVICE is by far the best entry of the long-running James Bond 
series.  The film contains some of  the most exhilarating action 
sequences ever to reach the screen, a touching love story, and a nice 
subplot that has agent 007 crossing (and even threatening to resign 
from) Her Majesty's Secret Service.  The problem is with Bond himself.  
Following Sean Connery's departure after YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, the film 
makers had to come up with a replacement.  The man they chose, a model 
named George Lazenby, is boring, and his ineffectualness lowers the 
picture's quality.</P>
<P>     ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE plays with Lazenby's introduction.  
At first, we don't see his face -- just the back of his head in an over-
the-shoulder shot.  The "James Bond Theme" is playing, however, so 
there's no doubt who's supposed to be on screen.  Then, after the beach 
fight where Lazenby's features are revealed, Bond makes an oblique 
reference to the actor switch:  "This never happened to the other 
fellow."  Later, Moneypenny remarks that Bond is "still the same James."</P>
<P>     Lazenby can handle the action sequences, but that's about all he 
masters.  For most of the film, he's stiff and uncharismatic, exhibiting 
little of the style and charm that marked Sean Connery's interpretation.  
Worse, Lazenby seems to be intentionally imitating his predecessor (a 
mistake that Roger Moore did not make in LIVE AND LET DIE), which only 
reminds us what we're missing.</P>
<P>     Even considering the leading man's limitations, however, ON HER 
MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is still a fine motion picture.  It's the only 
Bond film where 007 genuinely falls in love.  The object of his 
affection, Tracy (Diana Rigg), is the troubled daughter of a European 
crime boss, Draco (Gabriele Ferzetti).  After Bond saves Tracy's life 
and pays off a 20,000-franc debt, Draco becomes interested in acquiring 
the British agent as a son-in-law.  Bond declines his offer of one 
million pounds to marry Tracy, then proceeds to fall in love with her 
anyway.</P>
<P>     The romance comprises most of the film's first forty-five minutes, 
as well as the final fifteen.  For a series known for its action, the 
sensitivity of the James/Tracy pairing is surprising.  Rigg does a 
marvelous job holding up her side, and, after viewing her performance, 
it's not hard to understand how Bond could fall for the headstrong 
Tracy.  Lazenby, on the other hand, manages to be merely adequate -- 
this is the only occasion when a Bond woman upstages 007.  ON HER 
MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE contains three of the most tender moments ever 
to appear in any Bond film:  James wiping away Tracy's tears at her 
father's birthday party, the marriage proposal, and the final, 
heartbreaking scene.</P>
<P>     The movie isn't all love-and-kisses, however.  The main storyline 
involves the return of Blofeld (Telly Savalas in this incarnation).  
This time, he plans a campaign of biological warfare to be waged from a 
"research clinic" high in the Alps.  Posing as a genealogist (Blofeld 
wants to legitimatize his claim as Count de Blochamp), Bond visits the 
place.  Despite their face-to-face meeting in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, 
Blofeld doesn't recognize his adversary (maybe the change to Lazenby 
confused him), but a minor mistake blows 007's cover, and he's soon 
running for his life, with Blofeld and his imposing assistant, Irma Bunt 
(Ilse Steppat), right behind him.</P>
<P>     The climactic half-hour of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is 
almost non-stop action.  There's a stunning night ski sequence, a car 
chase down icy streets and through the heart of a stock car race, an 
avalanche, a helicopter raid on Blofeld's clinic, and fisticuffs on a 
speeding bobsled.  Director Peter Hunt has a flair for these kinds of 
scenes, and he keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.</P>
<P>     Of the eleven Bond films scored by John Barry, the composer's work 
for ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is his best.  Despite the absence of 
title song lyrics, the opening number is rousing (it was later used as 
incidental music during the teaser of A VIEW TO A KILL).  The love song, 
"We Have All the Time in the World", sung by Louis Armstrong, provides a 
perfect accompaniment to James and Tracy's growing attachment.  And the 
placement of the "James Bond Theme" is without flaw.</P>
<P>     After the relative commercial failure of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET 
SERVICE, Lazenby thankfully retired from the role, and Connery returned 
for one more go-around.  It's sad to consider what this film could have 
been with the original lead, but encouraging that it's so good without 
him.  Even featuring an inferior 007, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is 
a landmark change-of-pace, and an exhilarating and affecting piece of 
entertainment.</P>
