<P>Animation! An art form that has been on a continuing ebb and flow in motion
picture history. Once solely the domain of Walt Disney, pen and ink drawings
have come back to many studios but not always with the same success. With the
release of Warner Bothers' "THE IRON GIANT", we have a chance to view a solid
piece of work that rivals anything done by the former.</P>
<P>The year is 1957, and all of American is aware and watching as Sputnik circles
the globe. But one night a meteorite bursts through our atmosphere, crashing
into the ocean off the coast of Maine. Earl Stutz (voiced by M. Emmet Walsh) is
fighting to stay afloat in his fishing boat as a rough storm tosses him.
Searching frantically for the lighthouse, he crashes into a huge monolith.
Looking up he sees something with two burning searchlights. Knocked of his boat
by a crashing wave, the old man is thrown into the sea. He wakens on the rocks
just below the lighthouse.</P>
<P>Hogarth Hughes is a nine-year-old boy, being raised by his single Mother, Annie
(Jennifer Aniston). Hogarth loves monster movies and comic (as most any kid
does), and is giving to telling tall tales to avoid punishments for poor
judgment. One night while watching a scary movie on television (against his
Mother's wishes), he hears a noise from outside. Suddenly the reception of the
television goes out. Hogarth runs to his bedroom, and looking out the window
discovers that the antenna has been broken off. He then sees large footprints
leading from his house into the forest. Thinking that an invasion from outer
space has begun, Hogarth grabs up his Space Cadet regalia and sets forth in
search of the invader.</P>
<P>Hogarth stumbles through the woods, following the trail of broken trees to an
electrical station. As he approaches, the ground starts to rumble, trembling
with heavy blows. Suddenly a huge 100 foot metallic man appears above the trees.
Hogarth runs, just avoiding being crushed by the giant's feet. The steel
behemoth stares down at the power station, eating first the security fence and
then trying to eat one of the power conduits. Electricity bolts out from all
directions. The giant falls back against the high-tension lines, becoming
entangled. The surge of electricity causes the giant to shake and shudder in
anguish. Hogarth cowers as the giant smokes and burns in the electrical storm.
Finally, feeling some sense of remorse, runs to the main cut off switch and
pulls the circuit closed. The giant falls back unconscious, crashing  to the
ground. Hogarth, frightened and amazed runs home to tell his Mother. Meeting her
at the edge of the forest, she scolds the boy for leaving home so late at night
and takes no heed of his tall tale.</P>
<P>The next morning, Hogarth returns to the forest in an effort to photograph the
giant. Waiting for long hours, sleep overcomes him. Finally Hogarth wakens and
finds that his bait (a sheet of corrugated steel) is missing. He turns to leave
and discovers the sheet of steel behind him. He slowly raises his gaze to see
the Iron Giant standing above him. Laid out nearby is the cut off switch from
the power plant. Hogarth realizes that the Giant understands the boy had rescued
him. Hogarth now has visions of being a super hero, and a secret friendship is
begun. And it's a secret that doesn't remain one for very long.</P>
<P>Director Brad Bird, who cut his teeth directing episodes of  'The Simpson' and
'King of the Hill' has produced one of the most enjoyable 'boys tales' ever to
grace the screen. His attention to detail is wondrously complete. The character
designs are both charming and engaging to a degree that we haven't seen since
the classic shorts by Chuck Jones. In fact the whole design of the film could be
seen as a loving tribute to the style and wit of Chuck Jones and Bob Clampett.
The script by Bird and Tim McCanlies is rich in both character and subtext.
There is an honest to goodness feel of the 1950's in this film that it almost
seems to be a product of that era and not a current production. That is not to
say that the animation is stilted or of poor quality. On the contrary, the
animation of "The Iron Giant" is some of the best animation we've ever seen
outside of the Disney Studios. The movements of all of the characters is finely
detailed and beautifully controlled, but never in a way that makes one forget
they are watching animation. The idea of realistic movement is not the point
here. But great character animation and detail to expressions and design are.
The inclusion of Computer animation is so seamless as to be (at times) confused
with the traditional methods. A wonderful and charming alliance or technology
and art.</P>
<P>The cast assembled for the voices of the characters are all remarkable deft at
portraying they're parts. Most effective are Harry Connick Jr. as the beatnik /
junkyard artist Dean McCoppin. His delivery of his lines is so on target that
you forget the actor and absorb the character he portrays. Kudos as well to
Christopher McDonald as Government Agent Kent Mansley, a performance as manic
and inspired as anything done by Mel Blanc. And too much cannot be said about
the performance of Eli Marienthal as Hogarth Hughes. The tone and nuance of this
performance is so on key that if the Academy ever decides to dedicates an award
to voice actors, Mr. Marienthal should surely be up for a nomination.</P>
<P>Based on the marvelous Children's Book "The Iron Giant" by the late Ted Hughes,
Brad Bird's adaptation is a rich and enthralling film. Full of rich animation
and characterization, along with strong moral questions about friendship and
identity. And there is so much depth to the film that adults can take away as
much, if not more from the viewing, as any child can. Absolutely one of the
summer's best surprises, as well as one of this years best films.</P>
<P>On a scale of one to five, 'The Iron Giant' rates full five stars. A wonderful
film that will continue to entertain and enchant both young and old alike, for
years to come. Absolutely, a Classic!</P>
