<P>Shallow Grave  *** (out of four)
R, 1995
Directed by Danny Boyle. Written by John Hodge.
Starring Ewan McGregor, Kerry Fox, Christopher Eccleston.</P>
<P>While watching "Shallow Grave," I found myself periodically noticing thematic
similarities to the Coens' "Blood Simple." Both are good films in which
several characters, none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the
earth but still are not really evil, indulge in an act of deception that soon
necessitates more serious crimes. The body count rises, and before long
seemingly normal people have blood on their hands.</P>
<P>Both films are also flawed, but for different reasons. "Blood Simple" is
unrelentingly dark and moody, but its characterizations were a little hollow.
"Shallow Grave," on the other hand, is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty
minutes, and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they'd accomplished
for a more standard, audience-pleasing ending. The events of the film were
sufficiently intense and disturbing that I honestly felt quite troubled by
what I was witnessing on screen most of the time, yet there was a slight grin
on my face at the end.</P>
<P>As the film begins, we are introduced to Alex (Ewan McGregor), Juliet (Kerry
Fox), and David (Christopher Eccleston), a Scottish trio living in an
apartment in Glasgow. They are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious, but
other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch. A man named Hugo moves
into the apartment's remaining vacancy, and the next morning he is found dead
of a drug overdose. Juliet is about to call the police when Alex discovers
that Hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash
(presumably from criminal activities).</P>
<P>The three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death; after a
drawing of straws, the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so
as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to David, who had been the
most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning. All of this
transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film, and part of what
makes "Shallow Grave" so brilliant for a while is that I honestly had no idea
what was coming next. Other than the obvious question of why they don't report
the death and simply hide the cash, which is not addressed, the plotting and
characterization, while sometimes predictable, worked in a way that kept my
attention and, on more than one occasion, gave me chills.</P>
<P>I will, therefore, attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn't give
away too much of the plot. Broadly, the trio are in danger due to Hugo's
underworld connections, as two goons search for the money and kill several
people in the process. A police inspector (Ken Stott) is clearly suspicious
and visits the apartment, asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the
three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with
a junior detective. David, meanwhile, becomes increasingly paranoid, moves
into the attic, and develops an affinity for sharp objects. Director Danny
Boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in
the apartment, and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other.</P>
<P>While I do not consider myself the "happy endings are automatically stupid"
type, I thought that "Shallow Grave" really should have ended in tragedy - a
realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would
indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison, in
the mental hospital, or in the morgue. This could have been accomplished,
quite credibly, but then Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge seem to flinch and
opt for a more conventional "caper" ending in which we get a kick out of
seeing who outsmarted whom, and nothing more. Granted, this isn't really a
"happy" ending, but it's still pretty light-hearted compared to what preceded
it. I really shouldn't say anything more about the ending as far as details
go, but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also
inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable.</P>
<P>Yes, this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes, but ultimately
it left me feeling as if I'd been cheated. Still, "Shallow Grave" was
brilliant most of the way through, and it does at least meet the minimum
requirements for an entertaining thriller, and I am therefore awarding it
three stars. I guess I just can't help but think about that fourth star that
Boyle and Hodge let slip away.</P>
