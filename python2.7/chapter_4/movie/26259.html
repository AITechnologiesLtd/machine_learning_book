"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Since premiering at this year's Cannes International Film Festival, Lars
von Trier's Dancer in the Dark has radically divided its viewers into
two distinct camps – those that love the film, and those that think it's
a piece of garbage.  The film won both the coveted Palme d'Or (for best
feature) and the Best Actress award at Cannes, but the announcement was
met with boos and hisses.</P>
<P>Critics are just as split as the audiences in Cannes, some hailing it as
a stunning success while others reserve their harshest condemnations for
von Trier's (The Idiots) picture.  Fine Line Features, Dancer's U.S.
distributor, uses the shocking disparity on the home page of the film's
official website, with Entertainment Weekly gushing words like
`exhilarating,' `astonishing,' and `a triumph,' while Variety grumbled
it was "artistically bankrupt on every level."</P>
<P>Despite all of this, I was surprised to find Dancer extremely mediocre.
It's certainly not a bad film, but it isn't a great one, either.  I
thought the best part about it was the performance of Björk, and my
critique is more positive than negative because of her.  Admittedly, I
am a huge fan of the Icelandic pop star, so people that don't care for
her music may like Dancer considerably less.</P>
<P>Dancer is set in small town in Washington State during 1964.  Björk
plays Selma, an immigrant from the former Czechoslovakia living in a
trailer located in the back yard of a local policeman named Bill (David
Morse, Bait).  Selma works in a factory, but her job performance is
hindered by a hereditary disease that will rob her of her sight within a
year.  The possibility of being rendered sightless doesn't seem to
bother Selma, who works double shifts at the factory to squirrel away
money for her 12-year-old son Gene (Vladica Kostic) to have an operation
to correct the inherited ocular disorder that he will soon develop.</P>
<P>Selma also has a fondness of musicals, spending her spare time at the
theatre with co-worker and best friend Kathy (Catherine Deneuve, East
West), and is even set to play Maria in a local production of `The Sound
of Music.'  As her eyesight becomes worse and worse, Selma is forced to
make changes to her daily routines, but her spirits remain high, and her
desire to save money for Gene (named after Gene Kelly?) becomes only
stronger.</P>
<P>Oh, and there's singing, too.  Dancer features six musical numbers
(written and performed by Björk).  Song is Selma's means of escape from
her dreary, monotonous job, with the rhythmic clatter of the machines
helping her daydream about dance routines like the ones she saw in
American films as a child in Czechoslovakia.  `I've got little games I
play when it goes really hard,' Selma says, `I just start dreaming and
it all becomes music.'  And, boy, does it.  The choreographed musical
numbers are a striking contrast to the dowdy appearance and feel of the
rest of the film.</P>
<P>It's hard to watch Dancer and not think of von Trier's Breaking the
Waves.  Both pictures were filmed using handheld video cameras, giving
the final products a shaky, dizzying look.  Both are set years ago in
tiny towns with close-knit communities.  And both featured stunning
debut performances from female leads (Björk here, and Emily Watson in
Waves) that play haunting and, ultimately, doomed characters that seem a
little kooky, but end up making sacrifices that the rest of us would
never dream of.</P>
<P>Even the opening of Dancer is reminiscent of Waves.  Here, von Trier
begins with a three-minute overture played over abstract paintings that
slowly dissolve into one another.  You might remember Von Trier doing
something similar before each `chapter' in Waves.  While both films are
both triumphant and tragic, Dancer has an ending that's a vast
improvement over the disappointing epilogue in Waves.</P>
<P>It's tough to say whether the eccentric Danish director was trying to
make a film that shows a strong, pure character making the ultimate
sacrifice for a loved one, or if it was just a tongue-in-cheek poke at
the allure that sweeping American musicals have on susceptible children
in other countries.  Imagine thinking that America is one big, gaudy
song-and-dance number with a happy ending, only to get here, work your
fingers to the bone and then go blind.</P>
<P>von Trier has indicated that his parents strongly disapproved of big
Hollywood musicals.  But, then again, your typical Hollywood musical
usually doesn't have a seen where a guy gets his head bashed in.  I
wonder if they'd be happy with Dancer.</P>
