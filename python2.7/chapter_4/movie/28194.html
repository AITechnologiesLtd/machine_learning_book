JOE DIRT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>JOE DIRT, which has the second worst trailer this year (FREDDY GOT 
FINGERED's are even worse), is pretty much what you'd expect from a 
movie produced by Adam Sandler.  Full of bathroom humor, food fights and 
humping dogs, it's the kind of movie beloved by its target audience and 
correctly shunned by others.</P>
<P>Starring David Spade, who shares the writing "credits" with Fred Wolf, 
the movie concerns a boy abandoned by his parents when he was 8.  A guy 
who is treated like his last name, Joe has spent the last 15 years 
trying to find the folks who "lost" him.  Speaking of lost, Spade, last 
seen starring in LOST & FOUND, which I regretfully found, was worse then 
than in JOE DIRT.</P>
<P>Joe tells his life story in flashback to LA radio talk show host Zander 
Kelly (Dennis Miller), as LA waits with bated breath by the radio.  
Although Kelly maligns Dirt, calling him "exquisitely pathetic" and "a 
white trash idiot," Dirt just keeps dishing out his story to Kelly's 
eager audience.  Eventually, Kelly grows to respect his guest, upgrading 
his status to "white trash treasure."</P>
<P>In one of his stories, Dirt is literally "covered in crap."  The movie 
is like that.  Last week's TOMCATS is a comedic masterpiece next to JOE 
DIRT.</P>
<P>JOE DIRT runs 1:26.  It is rated PG-13 for crude, sex-related humor and 
language and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
