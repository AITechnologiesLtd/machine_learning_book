<P>Capsule Review:
Warrant Officer Ellen Ripley's back from the dead and fighting more of 
the most Freudian bugs in the universe in a flick that, while nowhere 
near the quality of the installments helmed by Ridley Scott and James 
Cameron, is still a pretty fun ride. By far the shortest film in the 
series, this sacrifices some potentially intriguing ideas about genetic 
responsibility in favor of sheer balls-to-the-wall speed. (I became a 
little more disappointed with the film thinking about it on the way home 
after the rush had worn off.)
Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children) 
seemed like a good choice for reviving the franchise, but his 
ultra-quirky style mingles uneasily with the one-liner intensive script 
by Joss Whedon (significantly, the two best sequences - a kickass 
underwater chase and an encounter with some eerily resonant failed 
experiments - are both virtually dialog free), resulting in a film that 
wavers between the moods established by the first two installments, but 
never quite finds an distinct identity of its own. Still, the set design 
and lighting (by the great Darius Khondji, who also did Se7en) are 
fabulous, Sigourney Weaver scores some subtle variations on her usual 
persona, and most importantly, it's a far more entertaining movie than 
the misbegotten Alien 3. Bring on part 5.</P>
