<PRE>                          THE CIDER HOUSE RULES
                    A film review by Christopher Null
                      Copyright 1999 filmcritic.com
                             filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>     I went into THE CIDER HOUSE RULES with a blank slate, knowing
nothing about the movie at all.</P>
<P>     I didn't even know how to pronounce the title.  It could've been
"The cider house-rules," meaning "This is the cider house, and these are
the rules."  Or it could've been "The cider house *rules*!" meaning
"That cider house is damn cool!"</P>
<P>     Wiser readers have probably already figured out that the former is
correct, and while this isn't a movie about a bunch of rules, it comes
awfully close.  Based on John Irving's novel (he also wrote the script),
CIDER HOUSE has that "adapted from the book" feeling -- like the writer
didn't want to edit out any of the chaff because it was all too
precious.</P>
<P>     Well, CIDER HOUSE is a sloppy mess because of it.  We start with
the 1930/1940's childhood of main character Homer (Maguire), his
adolescence in a remote Maine orphanage, his apprenticeship to the
orphanage's OB/GYN and abortionist Doctor Larch (Caine), his infatuation
with a patient who comes in for services (Theron), his decision to
become an apple picker, and... okay, are you bored yet?</P>
<P>     Try as I might, I can't even make it sound interesting, much less
exciting.  How this book became a film is beyond me.  Obviously
searching to recreate the magic of introspective period dramas like THE
ICE STORM and DEAD POETS SOCIETY, THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is an
exceedingly poor imitation that just doesn't work, mainly because
nothing happens in its two-plus hours.</P>
<P>     To enjoy the film at all, you'll need to take pleasure in the
details.  Maguire is typically excellent as the brooding Homer.  Caine,
doing his first American accent, is surprisingly effective as Homer's
counterpoint.  The supporting cast is uniformly good, excepting the
inexplicably cast musician Erykah Badu.  As a character study, CIDER
HOUSE is mild entertainment, but it's not enough to merit recommending
the film.</P>
<P>     THE CIDER HOUSE RULES, you'll be interested to know, represents a
13 year struggle to make it to the big screen.  Oh, how you feel that.</P>
