<P>I have a confession to make: I'm a closet Pro Rasslin' fan ["Rasslin'", 
by the way, is a different creature than "wrestling".  The latter is 
what high school, college, and Olympic grapplers, do; the former is what 
crazy men and women dressed in tights of various fit and style and in 
cahoots with one another, do for little to no pay, or for crazy amounts 
of money, depending on many factors, some of which will be addressed 
below.  But yet again, I digress].</P>
<P>Ahem. I repeat: I'm a closet Pro Rasslin' fan--or at least, I used to 
be.  I watched it a lot as a kid back in the days of "The Sheik" and 
"BoBo Brazil", and like most of America, lost interest in it, until the 
heyday of the likes of "Hulk Hogan", Randy "Macho Man" Savage, and my 
personal favorite, "The Ultimate Warrior".  But though I've glanced at a 
few current World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and World Championship 
Wrestling (WCW) shows from time to time with my son, I've lost interest 
in the spectacle that is Pro Rasslin', because in its current 
incarnation, it's way too raunchy, soap opera-ish (and bad soap opera, 
at that), blatantly stereotypical and misogynic (all part of the soap, 
I'm sure they'd say), and when you get down to it, unabashedly aimed at 
the lowest common denominator.</P>
<P>Most people know, and even accept, that these "fights" are pre-ordained 
in their outcome--boxing promoter Don King would be a natural in this 
business--but the big question remains: is it fake?  And if is not, who 
are these fools and why would they subject their bodies to the pain?</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
The documentary Beyond The Mat takes a look at the Sports Entertainment 
industry of Professional Wrestling from the viewpoint of three of its 
major players: Terry Funk, a 53-year-old wrestler nearing the end of his 
career; Mick Foley, a gentle father and husband, but an all-out lunatic 
within the ring; and Jake "The Snake" Roberts, formerly a "golden boy" 
with the WWF, but now a crack addict whose glory days have come and 
gone.  It also addresses the differences between the minor, independent 
leagues and the "big three" of Pro Rasslin': the WWF, WCW, and Extreme 
Championship Wrestling (ECW), itself a controversial entity because of 
its high violence content.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
There was one overwhelming emotion that hit me as I was watching this 
documentary: sadness.  Above all else, I felt incredibly sad for each of 
the characters--make that, each of the three main people--being 
discussed, and even more, for their families.  Of the three, Mick Foley 
(aka "Mankind", "Dude Love", and "Cactus Jack") seemed the most centered 
and stable outside of the ring, and clearly he loved his family as much 
as they loved him.  But the kinds of horrific punishment he puts himself 
through for love of his (pseudo) sport was sickening to watch for me as 
an outsider; I shudder to think what his young children dream of every 
night, after they saw it up close and personal.  Terry Funk's mindset 
was just beyond my comprehension; why he would continue to, basically, 
slowly kill himself, is something I do not understand.  I do give him 
props, though, for being able to swallow such punishment at his age--and 
compared to Muhammed Ali in his degenerative state, Funk is not so bad 
off.  But then again, say the name "Ali", and you get instant 
recognition.  Say "Funk", and most people think of a righteous bass 
groove... </P>
<P>But by far, my heart went out most to Jake "The Snake" Roberts.  Foley 
is one of the new(er) kids on the block; Funk is from the *original* Old 
School--but The Snake was from back in my rasslin'-fan day.  Jake's 
trademark move, the DDT, was something to watch.  His sneer would 
quickly turn into a smile that you knew hid teeth that would just as 
quickly bite you.  And though those huge pythons he carried to the ring 
never seemed to a real threat, you went along with the charade when he 
tossed them on his opponent, because, after all, Jake wasn't The Snake 
without them.  But like many of the older WWF (and then later, WCW) 
characters, Jake took a back seat to the new, younger guys--and then one 
day, he was gone.  And by then, I'd gotten older, and my interest in 
Rasslin' faded, so I hadn't thought much about Roberts, until this 
documentary.  That he had gotten older and fatter was no real surprise; 
it happens to the best of us.  But to hear that he was a crack 
addict...man, that threw me for a loop.  I'm glad that filmmaker Barry 
Blaustein got Roberts to open up to him, but unfortunately, the viewer 
never really gets as much of Roberts as we do of Blaustein talking about 
Roberts' problems.  </P>
<P>Along with the three featured athletes (and clearly, these folks are 
athletes; though their moves are choreographed, they are real...and real 
scary to watch when the mask is pulled off and you see it for what it 
is) and their families, Blaustein interviews some veterans in the 
profession as well as some up-and-comers.  Among these are: WWF owner 
Vince McMahon, whose family has been in the business for a very long 
time, and is very, very rich; Darren Drozdov, a former NFL player (as 
are many Pro Rasslers) who has the distinct "talent" of being able to 
vomit on command; female Rassler "Chyna", built like a man but made like 
a woman; Paul Heyman of the ECW, a league that has little respect for 
the WWF or WCW, but with all of their violence, seems to respect the 
individuals within its own organization; Tony Jones and Mike Modest, 
part-time Rasslers trying to get into the WWF with the help of their 
promoter, Roland Alexander; and current WWF heartthrob Duane "The Rock" 
Johnson, shown here competing against Foley as a Bad Guy (though last 
time I watched, The Rock is now a Good Character).</P>
<P>As interesting a documentary as it is, I wonder why Beyond The Mat was 
released in theaters instead of on TV; there have already been quite a 
few "Pro Wrestling Expose" types of documentaries on the small screen, 
so why this one here, now?  And I have to wonder about something else, 
too.  Stay with me here: writer/director Blaustein makes no bones about 
his love for the pseudo-sport, and it's clear that the athletes involved 
are pretty comfortable, even chummy, with Blaustein.  The  official 
"Beyond" website proclaims that this documentary is something that WWF 
President Vince McMahon "Doesn't want you to see!"--but isn't that 
something you would expect someone involved with the likes of McMahon, 
to say?  Hmmm...and didn't this documentary beat the WCW's theatrical 
"comedy" debut, Ready To Rumble, to the theaters?  Hmmm...and weren't 
there an awful lot of WWF "superstars" in this documentary, and no WCW 
stars to speak of?  Say it with me now:  HMMMMM...</P>
<P>There were many issues that weren't addressed in this documentary that I 
wish had been: namely, the blatant misogyny, stereotype characters, the 
history of the pseudo-sport (highlighting the way it's changed over the 
years), the way the fans are manipulated, the oodles of money gleaned 
from said fans (McMahon's WWF was reported to be worth almost a billion 
dollars, true, but a closer examination could've been done), the raising 
of the violence bar (namely, with the ECW) and what its logical 
progression will be, and especially the athletes' reactions to the death 
of WWF star Owen Hart last year.  Perhaps that's another documentary for 
another time--by another filmmaker not so in love with the world of Pro 
Rasslin'.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor"  [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
And speaking of "stereotype characters"...</P>
<P>For as long as Pro Rasslin' has existed, at least in the United States, 
there have been stereotype characters involved, but as time has gone on, 
things have become more and more blatant.  For every one average joe 
"The Rock" characters out there, there are a dozen shameful characters 
like "Razor Ramon" (a greasy latino caricature, formerly from the WWF), 
and "The Godfather" (a "pimp daddy", also from the WWF, who struts down 
the aisle with skanky hoochies in tight dresses; he calls them his 
"Ho-Train"--rarely, if ever, doing any actual Rasslin').  While I can 
ignore, for the most part, everything else about the three-ring circus 
known as Pro Rasslin', these types of characters are intolerable.</P>
<P>There is one upside to the "Godfather" character and his "Ho-Train", 
though: there haven't been any Black women on it.  So far.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line: 
I've flip-flopped on my final rating on this, but in the end decided on 
a greenlight, primarily for all the millions (ObRock: and millions) of 
Pro Rasslin' fans who think it is something to be emulated.  They 
*really* need to go see this one.  And that's my final answer, Regis; 
now take your rooty-poot candy ass outta here, ya jabronie, 'fore I send 
you to the Smackdown Hotel!   Uh...</P>
<P>"Beyond The Mat" (rating: greenlight): 
I still wonder whatever happened to The Ultimate Warrior.</P>
