<PRE>                        DEATH BECOMES HER
                    A film review by Too FAT Guys
                    Copyright 1992 by Roger & Me</PRE>
<P>Roger:  Say Roger, isn't Meryl Streep a Serious Actor?</P>
<PRE>Roger:  Yes.  Why do you ask?</PRE>
<P>Roger:  I was wondering, why does she keep squandering her talent on
        these pitiful comedies?</P>
<P>Roger:  She tried it once and she liked it?</P>
<PRE>Roger:  Possibly.  It's a shame no one else does.  Which brings us to her
        latest film, DEATH BECOMES HER.  Streep plays Madeline, a
        self-consumed actor in the twilight of her career.  After a
        disastrous performance, she steals her old friend Helen's
        fiancee, Ernest (Bruce Willis).  Seven years later, Helen
        (Goldie Hawn) is still traumatized by her loss and is put into
        a mental hospital, presumably for depression.  There she finds
        a new purpose in life:  Eliminating Madeline.  Again seven
        years later, Helen, looking remarkably well preserved, returns
        to prey on Madeline and Ernest's crumbling marriage.  Madeline,
        in turn, prays for a miracle cure for her aging, which she
        finds in the form of an immortality potion.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  Much of the film's humor is derived from the playful things
        that Industrial Light & Magic can do to immortal bodies.  Many
        of the sight gags come off quite well, and the film gets extra
        points for its creative use of stairs.  I have a penchant for
        dark and morbid humor, so I enjoyed parts of this movie
        immensely.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  While I did enjoy some of the outrageous special effects, I
        think that the film lacks several crucial elements.  First, the
        plot is full of holes, among them, why Helen also takes the
        magic potion.  Second, if there once was a theme in this movie,
        it seems to have been sacrificed to the Hollywood gods.  Or at
        least fatally obscured.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  Right, unless you count "women are using, lying, vain, bitches"
        as a theme.  I think the intended theme was "beauty is skin
        deep," but with all the contradictions, the "bitches" theme is
        all that's left.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  One of these contradictions is particularly offensive.  During
        Helen's depression, she becomes very obese.  Amazing special
        fat-effects aside, the tone of the fat segment is extremely
        negative.  While she is overweight, the shots are low angle
        closeups of her buttocks and legs, whereas while thin, the
        camera showcases her radiant smile and cleavage.  Fat jokes
        just don't cut it with me.  What did you think of the acting,
        Roger?</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  I found it refreshing to see Bruce Willis get away from his
        wise-cracking, tough guy roles.  Both Goldie Hawn and Meryl
        Streep were competent, considering the poor source material.
        Isabella Rossellini, on the other hand, is magnificent in her
        bit part as a talking pair of breasts.  I understand that they
        needed to provide a source for the magic potion; I fail to
        understand why she needed to be naked for the role.  A few
        laughs just weren't enough to make up for all these failings.
        I give this film a thumbs down.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  The movie was humorous enough to entertain me while I was at
        the theatre.  I give this movie a mild thumbs up to anyone who
        can resist the temptation to think about it afterwards.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  Well, that's one thumb down and a mild thumb up.  That's all for
        now -- the tty is closed.
