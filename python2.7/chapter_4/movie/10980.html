<P>  If you could have whatever you wanted just by imagining or
dreaming, would you accept the offer?  Just think: if you like a
book, say, "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea," you could not
only conjure it up, but you could make it a best-seller in 1998
simply by placing a mental order for 100,000 copies!  You
could wish Saddam Hussein a nice life in exile in Tierra del
Fuego, or hope for a puppy for Christmas to your exact
specifications.  The folks who populate Barry Levinson's new
film, which could best be described, genre-wise, as
psychological sci-fi, did indeed possess this awesome potency
and yet realized, as the wise men in those interminable
monster movies of the 1950s that "perhaps we were not
meant to interfere with Mother Nature."</P>
<P>   Featuring an all-star cast of Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone,
Samuel L. Jackson and Peter Coyote and including also Liev
Schreiber (a favorite of the 20-somethings) and Queen Latifah
(in a laughably insignificant guise), "Sphere" is a
conglomeration of science fiction ideas that seems to
introduce every concept of the genre from the 1950s onward. 
It contains a few monsters (snakes, killer jellyfish); a team of
luminous scientists (two of whom received their first Ph.D's
before they were 19); a UFO; time travel; a black hole;
explosives which have convenient digital readouts so that the
movie audience can watch the proverbial race against time; a
few dazzling special effects; a romance and a few twists and
some witty dialogue.  Making yet again the mistake that more
is more, director Barry Levinson piles on the concepts with
such increasing rapidity that clarity takes a back seat to
spectacle, and believability is stretched to the breaking point.</P>
<P>   Levinson does have a way with timing, at least at first, as
the narrative opens slowly, its cleverest dialogue bunched up
against a background of relative calmness.  "Sphere" gathers
momentum compellingly but ideas are bounced off hither and
thither before the audience can catch its collective breath to
sort out the import.  </P>
<P>   When the appropriate U.S. governmental authority is led to
believe that a sunken craft lies 1000 beet beneath the sea, a
team of professionals is sent to the scene to explore the
object, the group including a marine biologist, a
mathematician, an astrophysicist and a psychologist. 
Submerging themselves, the explorers discover what looks
like a spacecraft that landed in the ocean in 1706, but are
startled by an array of surprises that cause them to be
alternately ecstatic and despondent.  Early on they are
stunned to discover a severely deteriorated corpse of an
American holding a bag of snack food, apparently
done in by a blunt blow to his skull by an enraged
assassin.  Little did these voyagers realize that history would
repeat itself: that the current company of men and women
were themselves in danger of turning against one another
with murderous rage.  Like the rest of us, each person in this
super-bright group of pilgrims has a dark side and, if given
the power to carry out their negative feelings, they could turn
their expedition into bedlam.  What furnishes them with this
very might is the eponymous sphere, a perfect circle which
appears to be a living being trapped under water for almost
three centuries and desperately lonely.</P>
<P>   To Barry Levinson's credit the director does not at any point
turn his movie into juvenile mayhem, the error made by Paul
Anderson in last year's poorly received "Event Horizon." 
Crew members do not become squashed against walls or
drowned in an ocean of blood, nor does this supernatural
sphere throw off little green monsters or vampire-like
essences.  Keeping the film more within the controlled
boundaries of Robert Zemeckis's cerebral "Contact," Levinson
does allow a few of the characters to become victimized by
lethal undersea creatures but in each case averts his camera
after summoning just a glimpse of the bloodshed to convince
us that the crew are in mortal danger.  </P>
<P>   While Norman Johnson (Dustin Hoffman) and Beth Halpern
(Sharon Stone) provide the obligatory romance (at one time
they had an affair but Norman never told Beth that he was
married), the chemistry between these two superstars is close
to zero.  But while Hoffman in no way enjoys the role he
captured so cleverly in "Wag the Dog," he still provides the
lion's share of the movie's wit while Sharon Stone lends the
picture some brief periods of psychotic breaks.  Samuel L.
Jackson contributes some knowing, low-key humor to the
piece and Peter Coyote, as the ship's leader, Harold Barnes,
does well as the authoritarian straight man.</P>
<P>   From time to time we are treated to some National
Geographic-type shots of the creatures of the deep, some of
which do not provide the relaxation they are known to
dispense when swimming about the constricted space of a
home aquarium.  At other times we are furnished the more
typical suspense of characters trying to outrun a menacing
time bomb.  We human beings are our own Frankenstein
monsters, as scripters Stephen Hauser and Paul Attanasio
strongly imply, but this notion--that we have the power to
destroy but do not possess the power to stop our destructive
tendencies--is submerged beneath a film that throws enough
perceptions for three movies.</P>
