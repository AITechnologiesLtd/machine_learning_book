<P>For the first time since June of 1998's CAN'T HARDLY WAIT, a large
collection of Gen-X talent masses together to produce something other
than a slasher-horror flick. The change is a welcome one, if perhaps a
bit awkward for Hollywood, for their talent is half a generation ahead
of their target group. Now, formulas which have worked for the last five
years must be revised for application to a new generation of youngsters
born after 1980. SHE'S ALL THAT, the first bigscreen feature from
veteran TV director Rob Iscove, tentatively tests the waters of teenage
fanship before risking all on a muddled strategy. </P>
<P>The strategy is to borrow from other sweet-hearted romances -- most
explicitly PRETTY WOMAN -- and mold them into the teenager/high school
setting. This works initially, until the movie falls into a repetitive
cycle. The end, which barely breaks from this cycle, is unsatisfying. </P>
<P>The repetitive feeling comes after the novelty of our characters has
worn off. Zack Siler (Freddy Prinze Jr.) -- Harrison High soccer star,
honor roll student, and heartthrob to every girl in his class -- comes
back from Spring Break to find that his girlfriend Taylor (Jodi Lyn
O'Keefe) has just dumped him for Brock Hudson (Matthew Lillard), star of
MTV's "The Real World." The break-up is a wooden stake to the heart for
Zack, since Taylor is the most popular girl in school, but on the
rebound he bets his friends that he could make any other girl just as
popular. The guinea pig is Laney Boggs (Rachel Leigh Cook), recessive
art student extraordinaire, and Zack has six weeks to turn her into the
prom queen. </P>
<P>The R. Lee Flemming Jr. script seems worthless because the character
types are so overused. Although Flemming goes to all lengths to paint
Zack as a likeable guy -- which he accomplishes to some degree -- both
Taylor and Laney become predictable. Neither of the three leads do
anything substantial with their roles, and all are there simply for
visual appeal. The supporting roles, as well as their interactions with
the main cast, manage to add some humor which helps to break the
monotony. </P>
<P>For the most part, the movie has a surreal or unrealistic feeling to it.
Teenagers are likely to eat it up, though, and that's what counts. SHE'S
ALL THAT works on its level, just not anywhere else. </P>
