Susan Granger's review of "HANGING UP" (Columbia Pictures)</PRE>
<P>No doubt, Columbia Pictures and the producers wanted this to
be a baby-boomers' version of The First Wives Club; i.e.: a wise,
witty chick's flick about three blonde, beautiful sisters coping with
their sibling rivalry while dealing with their philandering old father
who's suffered a minor stroke. But something went wrong from the
script to the screen. What's left is an overdose of cheery cute. Meg
Ryan's perky as ever as the sensible middle sister, a party planner
whose motto is "No surprises."  Which puts her in direct conflict with
Walter Matthau, her charming, curmudgeonly dad who not only drinks too
much but loves to surprise women by pinching their posteriors.  Diane
Keaton's the hip, super-successful, self-involved older sister, while
Lisa Kudrow's the youngest, a ditsy, semi-successful TV actress on one
of those daytime hospital dramas. Adapted by Delia Ephron from her
1995 novel, co-scripted by sister Nora Ephron, and directed by Diane
Keaton, its title comes from the family's addiction to cell phones
which are annoying enough in real life but become unbearable on the
screen. Delia Ephron reveals, "I live half my life in the real world
and half on the telephone" - and that cliche-filled, whiny jabbering
is the premise of the story. There's also some metaphysical connection
between hanging up the phone and disconnecting yourself from your
problems. But the movie is uneven in pace and tone. Sometimes it's
goofy, concentrating on quirky, if banal, verbal sibling encounters;
at other times, it goes for pathos - what with dad's
dying. Predictably, ultimately, there's reconciliation and
redemption. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Hanging Up is a
flimsy, floundering 4. Be thankful you don't share the phone gene in
this family's DNA - nor their frenzied phoniness.</P>
