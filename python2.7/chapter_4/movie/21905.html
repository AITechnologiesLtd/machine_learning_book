<P>In "Buena Vista Social Club," Wim Wenders has made another important film.  
This story follows a group of aging Cuban musicians from their neighborhoods 
in Cuba to various concerts across the world, and finally to Carnegie Hall.  
It is a documentation of guitarist Ry Cooder's journey to Cuba to preserve a 
vanishing music, and the culture behind it.  As such, "Buena Vista Social 
Club" serves one of the more noble functions of documentary films.</P>
<P>The most watchable dimension of the film is the music.  Anyone would want to 
own the soundtrack of this film.  Hearing the guitar of 90 year-old Compay 
Segundo, the piano of 80 year-old Ruben Gonzalez, and the voice of 70 
year-old Ibrahim Ferrer, we know the reason behind making the film.  These 
legends of Cuban music should not fade.  And when we have the opportunity to 
watch their movements and expressions as they perform, we know we are 
witnessing history.  Wenders and director of photography Jorg Widmer use 
overlapping music to seamless and astonishing effect:  many times we listen 
to an artist's performance, and then fade into an interview featuring his or 
her views on music, or Cuba, or the world.</P>
<P>Interviews are extensive and crucial to the narrative.  Especially 
interesting are the views of Ibrahim Ferrer, who sports a thin goatee and 
cap, and brings us into his apartment.  He speaks of various inspirations, 
and we sense the hardships he's experienced - enough to make him retire from 
singing so he might shine shoes - before his resurrection through this 
project.  Near the end, Ferrer's observations on New York are touching;  the 
man's consideration of others, his lack of arrogance, his suave singing 
voice - these make him the leading man of the movie.  Others are almost as 
interesting.  Mr. Segundo tells of being five years old and lighting his 
grandmother's cigars.  (He confesses to having smoked for 85 years!)  We are 
also treated to the words of Ruben Gonzalez, who was able to record his 
first solo album at age 77.  There's an irresistible scene in which Mr. 
Gonzalez plays his piano for a group of small girls in a huge Havana dance 
studio.</P>
<P>Through seeing the decaying infrastructure and transportation of Cuba, we 
conceive a better understanding of the conditions of its people.  Hence we 
better comprehend what these musicians have survived, what obstacles they 
have  faced, in order to keep their music alive.  It's worth commenting that 
not once do we hear a bitter comment about the political situations 
responsible for the crumbling buildings surrounding these vibrant people.</P>
<P>Mixing clever storytelling techniques - like a series of nifty "steadicam" 
shots that encircle the musicians - with implicit awe for these special 
styles of music, "Buena Vista Social Club" stands out as a non-fiction film. 
  In short, it makes the viewer want to visit Cuba hoping that maybe, just 
maybe a place like the Buena Vista Social Club still exists.</P>
