A Movie Review by David Sunga </PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Andrew Davis</PRE>
<P>Written by: Patrick Smith Kelly. Based on a play by Frederick Knott</P>
<P>Starring: Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen, David
Suchet</P>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Ex convict, rich husband and wife who don't get along</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
This movie is about various battles between three characters. Steven
(Michael Douglas) is a greedy old rich guy whose fortune is going down
the tubes, fast. But he stands to inherit extra money if his heiress
wife dies. Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow) is Steven's beautiful unfaithful
wife. She is a United Nations linguist who doesn't love Steven, and is
having a steamy affair with artist David. Meanwhile David (Viggo
Mortensen) is a manipulative money grubbing ladies man who has targeted
Emily's riches. </P>
<P>The story opens with Emily and David committing adultery, and Steven
secretly finding out about it. From then it's a question of who plans to
kill whom, and who foils whom. The greedy and clever Steven gets the
lion's share of the battles and schemes, battling both David and Emily.
Of course, one of the three plots a perfect murder, hence the title.</P>
<P>An interesting side character is introduced in the form of Detective
Mohamed Karaman (David Suchet) a sharp police chief who noses around
investigating the murder. </P>
<P>Opinion: 
On the good side, it's interesting to see which one of the three
strategists - - David, Steven, or Emily - - will emerge victorious in
the end. On the bad side, the matchups are kind of lopsided. Steven and
David seem to be masters of deceit, while Emily's the kind of person who
- - soon after being brutalized by a thug - - deliberately wanders
around alone in a seedy lower class neighborhood. Emily shows promising
multilingual abilities which she uses to make the acquaintance of
Detective Karaman and some Hispanic tenants, but it turns out she can
just as easily complete her strategies without them, and in English.</P>
<P>I was a little bit disappointed in the weak alliance between Emily and
Karaman. As soon as Detective Karaman arrives on scene to investigate
the murder, there's an instant feeling of electricity. Here's a guy who
can read human nature from a mile away. Karaman is brilliantly played by
David Suchet (he also plays Agatha Christie's Inspector Hercule Poirot
in the PBS detective series). He takes compassion on Emily, and
likewise, she connects to his Middle Eastern culture and language, but
unfortunately, the two don't partner up as in cop buddy movies.</P>
<P>If you liked Michael Douglas as the heartless corporate raider Gordon
Gekko in Oliver Stone's WALL STREET, he gives basically the same
performance here. Meanwhile - - as the sleazy, long-haired artist - -
Viggo Mortensen does a complete about face from his crew cut navy Master
Chief John Urgayle role in GI JANE. Mortensen does a great job as the
reprehensible young artist. Of the three, Gwyneth Paltrow probably has
the most complicated character. Is she a cold and unfaithful vixen who
has latched on to a wealthy marriage of convenience, or is she just a
naïve linguist in search of empowerment?</P>
<P>It's tough to root for any of the three main characters when the
winner's got to be either an adulteress, a sleazy young manipulator, or
a greedy old manipulator. What good is a schlumpy, morally relativistic
message, right? However, it's interesting from a dramatic standpoint to
watch the actors/actresses one-up each other. </P>
