<PRE>                              FLATLINERS
                    A review in the public domain
                            by The Phantom
                      (<A HREF="mailto:baumgart@esquire.dpw.com">baumgart@esquire.dpw.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>     It's been a long, tedious, and violence-prone summer for the
Phantom, and he's been getting a little edgy.  Reviewing's in his blood
now, and it's been nearly three months since his last reviews (for CLASS
OF 1999 and BRAIN DEAD).</P>
<P>     Since then, he's been subjected to more violence thinly disguised
as pop entertainment than even Steven King, in his wildest dreams,
possibly could have imagined.  The combined body counts of TOTAL RECALL,
ROBOCOP 2, DIE HARD 2, and PRESUMED INNOCENT (well, to be fair, PRESUMED
INNOCENT's body count *was* on the low side) exceeded even the Phantom's
threshold for violence sometime in mid-July; for him, the cold, dark
days of autumn and winter, and the dozens of horror films they'll bring,
will seem like welcome relief indeed.</P>
<P>     Which brings us, in a rather roundabout way, to the subject of this
review.  For a film that is ostensibly about dying, it's curious that no
one dies in FLATLINERS -- at least not for long.  Although the film is
as much of a horror film as was THE OMEN and THE EXORCIST, FLATLINERS
ties PRESUMED INNOCENT as the summer's film with the lowest body count.</P>
<P>     (Before the Phantom even gets started reviewing the film, he would
like to say that he finds this both remarkable and quite refreshing; it
wasn't too long ago that filmmakers knew how to make films, both horror
and legitimate, in ways that didn't involve killing more people on
screen than they disappointed in the auditorium.)</P>
<P>     FLATLINERS starts with the tired old notion of "near death"
experiences, takes a detour somewhere around ELM STREET, and winds up as
a visual homage to one of the most stylish horror films of all time: THE
HUNGER.  Along the way, the director, Joel Schumacher, reminds us of
just what made 1987's THE LOST BOYS so enjoyable, and why he is one of
the best and most stylish directors making B-grade movies today.</P>
<P>     The film itself is best described as a rollercoaster ride -- a lot
of fun while you're speeding around turns and checking your seat
restraints, but not very memorable afterward.  To its credit, the film
makes believable the shaky notion that a bunch of photogenic medical
students with no homework, labwork, and just the occasional round to
make, can repeatedly induce brain death in each other for periods of
time greater even than the length of the commercials preceding the film,
and then unfailingly resuscitate each other, bringing each other back to
life and suffering no more brain damage than has the script.</P>
<P>     Having established that, which is no mean feat, Schumacher uses the
near death experiences to fashion a film that blends the best of the ELM
STREET series with the sensibility of a 90-minute MTV longform video.
Yet regardless of what you think of the subject matter, or even of the
film itself, there is no denying that Schumacher's cinematography, his
ability to set a scene and generate suspense, and his ability to use
sound effects and lighting techniques effectively is virtually unequaled
in the world of the horror film.  Sam Raimi and the Coen brothers have
shown the same skill with the EVIL DEAD series, BLOOD SIMPLE and RAISING
ARIZONA, and of course Ridley Scott's films define the genre of
techno-style, but Schumacher's talents have improved in the years since
THE LOST BOYS, and at this point the Phantom has to rank him right up
there with Sam, Joel, and Ethan.</P>
<P>     Schumacher keeps the film moving along, and it's good that he does,
since otherwise the audience would have time to consider just how trite
and obvious the plot is.  The Phantom is not going to drop any spoilers,
but if there is a single phan out there who can't guess both where the
film is going and how it ends by the time Kevin Bacon goes under, the
Phantom will be most surprised.  THE LOST BOYS suffered from similar
problems, of course; as modern-day vampire stories go, it doesn't hold a
silver bullet to NEAR DARK.  But at least THE LOST BOYS had interesting
characters, generally witty dialogue, and a script that doesn't sound as
if the closest it ever came to a second draft was when the writer left
some of the windows in his apartment open.  To say that the characters
in FLATLINERS are two-dimensional would be to insult the Cartesian
coordinate system; they each have one dimension, and they each stick to
that dimension throughout the film.  Kiefer Sutherland is the driven,
slightly bad guy; Kevin Bacon is the brilliant, unstable yet reliable
guy, Julia Roberts keeps us all waiting for the scene where they perform
CPR on her and in general never allows the word "collagen" to leave our
thoughts, etc., etc.</P>
<P>     But we don't go to horror films expecting great originality, do we
phans?  Although the occasional diamond in the rough like the EVIL DEAD
series or last spring's BRAIN DEAD helps us recall that it is possible
to be both creative and stylish, all too frequently we are forced to
settle for films that are neither.  That FLATLINERS is so very stylish
is a distinct plus, and Schumacher handles the film so well that the
Phantom was more than willing to overlook the bumpy plot and the less
than surprising surprises.</P>
<P>     The film is set in Chicago, but only barely.  As he did with THE
LOST BOYS, Schumacher has used various unrelated sets and city backdrops
in a way that creates a private world for the film; FLATLINERS is not
set in any recognizable part or suburb of Chicago, though alumni of
Loyola may recognize some of the more striking buildings in the film.
But for the most part, the characters in FLATLINERS exist in their own
world, a world of colored lights, fog, and the night (it's almost always
night during the film, and when it isn't night it's dark or cloudy).
Phans of THE LOST BOYS will recognize some of Schumacher's signature
elements of style, but FLATLINERS has many of its own; it is obviously
related to THE LOST BOYS, but it doesn't look like a clone.  One
interesting new affectation is having large sheets of clear plastic
draped over almost everything in sight; this was done to such excess
that the Phantom thought that all of Chicago was undergoing massive
asbestos removal procedures.  And Schumacher's swooping and diving
camera is back, but his technique has improved in the years since THE
LOST BOYS.  In FLATLINERS, he makes use of all the tricks of the music
video trade, including black & white photography, purposely grainy or
flat photography, washed out or oversaturated color, etc.  There are
also a good number of monitors of various kinds scattered throughout the
film, and Schumacher even cribs a bit from SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE.  For
better or worse (and the in the Phantom's opinion, better), FLATLINERS
plays more like a longform video than like a film.</P>
<P>     By the film's end, the Phantom was reminded of Tony Scott's 1983
film, THE HUNGER, a vampire film that was exquisitely bad, though very,
very stylish.  Schumacher is not a talentless hack like Scott;
FLATLINERS is nothing if not entertaining.  Whereas THE HUNGER was a
feast for the eyes and a famine for the mind, FLATLINERS keeps us
entertained and happy as long as we don't spend too much time trying to
predict the outcome of the next scene (or even what the next scene will
be) -- for alas, all too often we are correct and left to wonder why
someone didn't put as much effort into the story as Schumacher had
obviously put into filming it.</P>
<P>     And it's at the end, when things start winding down and heading
toward their all-too-predictable conclusion, that the Phantom found his
interest in the film flatlining (or at least faultering).  FLATLINERS is
a good 10 minutes too long, and the ending is so disappointing that it
stands a good chance of ruining what is otherwise a very entertaining,
if brainless, film for those phans who expected to see a horror film
that had the courage of its convictions.</P>
<P>     The ending, phans, is an ending only a studio executive or a parent
could love; it is a near-perfect mass-market movie-of-the-week ending.
The Phantom even felt that it gave THE ABYSS a run for its money as the
world's most abysmal ending, but in the end his conclusion is that THE
ABYSS is still reigning champion.  Things start going astray once it
becomes obvious that the film has a GHOST-like heart to it; all the
malevolence, chills and thrills of the first half start to disappear
like a vampire exposed to daylight, and the audience is left with 20
minutes of pointless exposition that leads inexorably to a conclusion
worthy only of our strongest excoriation.  (All right, perhaps that was
reaching a bit, but the Phantom hasn't visited his old friend Roget in
quite a while.)  In a word, phans, the ending is execrable.  (Now *that*
was reaching...)</P>
<P>     But don't let the lousy ending keep you from seeing FLATLINERS;
after all, if the Phantom avoided every film that ended badly, he'd be
able to get his library books back on time and he'd rarely have to clean
the heads on his VCR.  Like THE LOST BOYS, FLATLINERS is wonderful fun
while you're in the theater, and though you will most likely be groaning
along with the rest of the audience by the film's end, you won't be
bored for the 90 minutes preceding it.</P>
