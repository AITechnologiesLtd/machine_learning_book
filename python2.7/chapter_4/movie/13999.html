<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>This is a film produced in Ireland which was a big hit at the Sundance
Film Festival. For the life of me, I don't know why they liked it.</P>
<P>Most foreign films come supplied with sub-titles, but when the actors are
speaking English, there's no such help, even when they have heavy Irish
brogues.  I heard the same complaint about "The Full Monty", and "Brassed
Off", but the plots of those films overcame the problem.  In "I Went
Down", you miss a lot of the humor because you can't understand them.</P>
<P>The movie involves a small time gang boss and his stooges.  Our Lead has
just gotten out of prison [a term he served to protect his father, I
think?] and he becomes a pawn in a caper to recover a man who has $25,000
pounds of the boss's money, or does he?  By the end of the film, you
finally figure out what's going on, but by that time, you really don't
care.</P>
<P>The sex scenes seem to be in the movie simply because they wanted to have
sex scenes in the movie.  They could have been eliminated without changing
the plot.  It's a sad commentary when you don't remember much about a
movie except for ridiculous things, such as one guy's sideburns and shoes,
and another guy's birthmark on his face.</P>
<P>If this movie comes on free TV some evening and you have nothing better to
do, you might want to watch it, but don't lose sleep over it.  I give it a
D.</P>
<PRE>See you at the movies.     </PRE>
