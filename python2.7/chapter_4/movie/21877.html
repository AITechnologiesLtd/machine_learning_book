<P>*DOGMA* (rated R, 125 minutes, Lions Gate Films)- "Dogma", the most
ambitious and highly anticipated film from comic auteur Kevin Smith
("Clerks", "Chasing Amy"), opens with a disclaimer.  It states that the
film, which puts a satirical spin on Catholicism, is not meant to be taken
seriously.  The disclaimer, which was recently added after many pointless
protests and death threats from Catholic radicals, contradicts what I think
Smith was trying to accomplish.  "Dogma" is more about faith than it is
about blasphemy, but how can anyone realize that if they don't take the film
seriously?  </P>
<P>The convoluted plot of "Dogma" involves an abortionist (Linda Fiorentino)
who finds out that she is the only remaining descendant of Jesus.  Along
with Smith regulars Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith himself), she
must save the world from two bad-boy angels (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) who
plan to pass through the arches of a New Jersey church and thus negate all
existence.  Along for the wild ride are George Carlin, Salma Hayek, Jason
Lee, Alan Rickman, Chris Rock, Janeane Garofalo, who play some of the most
quirkily conceived characters I've ever seen (and yes, Alanis Morrisette
plays God).  </P>
<P>Once you get over just how funny "Dogma" is (it provides as many laughs as
I've had this year), you may realize that just about everything else about
the production is flawed.  Linda Fiorentino doesn't make a competent lead as
Bethany, and the Affleck/Damon pairing adds up to no more than a
distraction.  Kevin Smith wrote "Dogma" before his "Jersey Trilogy" and it
shows.  Smith, who mixes toilet humor with profound existential statements,
takes a step back into adolescence with this flick.  When compared with the
simplicity of "Clerks", or the unexpected poignance of "Chasing Amy", the
overly ambitious and overlong "Dogma" just doesn't cut it.  </P>
<P>It takes a couple viewings to really cut deep into "Dogma", and to realize
that its biggest surprise is an emotionally hollow center.  On the surface,
there's too much going on to absorb in one viewing, but deeper down there's
not enough emotion to fill even half of that.  In the end, "Dogma" doesn't
tell us much about the nature of belief (besides the opinion that
African-Americans are underutilized in the Bible), and the flat, cartoony
result is more like Kevin Smith's beloved pastime; a comic book.  After
watching this hilarious but overblown mess, I wanted to see something as
different as possible.  I wanted to see a Kevin Smith movie.  (now in
theatres)</P>
