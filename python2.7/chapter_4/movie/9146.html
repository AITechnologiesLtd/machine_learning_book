<PRE>THE PEACEMAKER (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>The Peacemaker is going to be scrutinized because of it being the first
release out of the much-touted DreamWorks SKG production company. Can
director Mimi Leder ("ER") and acting dual George Clooney and Nicole Kidman
make this be a great debut film for DreamWorks SKG?</P>
<P>It's interesting to note that four big players from the hit TV show "ER"
are part of The Peacemaker production: Award winning director Mimi Leder,
executive producer John Wells, actor George Clooney, and executive producer
Steven Spielberg. With these big names attached to the film, it has to be
good, right?</P>
<P>A group of terrorists steal ten nuclear warheads and create an incident
with one of the warheads. Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman) is the head of
the group that is looking into this incident. She requests the assistance
of someone with a specialty in this field, and that someone is Tom Devoe
(George Clooney). He's a specialist in dealing with terrorism of this type
and at also dealing with illegal arms dealers. Together, Kelly and Devoe go
hunting for the rest of the nuclear warheads. Added to this is the
political plot of a "Serbian, Bosnian, and Muslim" man, who in the script
is attempted to be humanized with a sub-plot about his family being killed
off by terrorist.</P>
<P>What is strange is that the opening incident is dropped quickly after its
purpose is found out. I would have really liked to see what could or would
have been done to correct that incident, but it is dropped quickly to let
the action start. Which, in the case of The Peacemaker looks like a good
thing to have done, but it would have been interesting to see what could
have happened.</P>
<P>The best way to describe The Peacemaker is a two-hour chase scene.
Peacemaker has locations in Italy, Bosnia, Russia and the US. The world
travel is handled well. Each site has one action scene attached to it. I
especially love the car chase in Venice that plays like grown men in bumper
cars. Most of the action, though well done, is hardly imaginative and very
uninspired. The car chase is about as creative as the action scenes get.
The opening action sequence seems to take too long for what it is meant to
show. There is also the unnecessary gore that is used throughout the film.</P>
<P>Mimi Leder shows that she knows how to use the camera effectively.
Sometimes too effective and making some of the camera work unneeded and
distracting. Some of her shots that use the camera in motion are just for
the hell of it, and it is more distracting that anything. About halfway
through the film, you get the sense, even if you didn't know that Leder was
a director on ER, from her camera work that she is an ER director. The
constant fluid motion of the camera is a constant reminder of the camera
work in ER. Whereas in ER the camera fluidly follows a gurney or fluidly
does a 360 around a gurney, here in The Peacemaker the camera fluidly
follows another object or fluidly does a 360 around a character. </P>
<P>The performances in The Peacemaker are nothing special. Kidman does OK as
Kelly. In one scene where she cries over the loss of nine soldiers, she
sheds a tear, gets up, and makes a call about a different matter. So quick,
so fast, and so brief was her cry that we don't really get the sense that
she really cared about those soldiers. Clooney does his usual character
role. Lost are his nervous ticks from ER which makes him look more
confident, but, he's not doing anything new here. His character is
likeable, but we don't really get to know his character enough to care for
him.</P>
<P>Hans Zimmer does the score for this film, and this is the best thing about
the film. The score is pulse pounding and follows the action well.</P>
<P>The Peacemaker is an average action film that has its thrilling moments.
Though the film is a bit on the long side, it does keep a good pace. I
recommend seeing The Peacemaker, but only during a matinee showing. I hope
that Dreamworks SKG has better films lined up to release after this mildly
entertaining and easily forgettable debut. </P>
