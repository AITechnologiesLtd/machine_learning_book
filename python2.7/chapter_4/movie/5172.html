<P>     THE MONSTER is a mediocre motion picture wrapped around a number of 
very good scenes.  Starring Italian comic sensation Roberto Benigni 
(JOHNNY STECCHINO, SON OF THE PINK PANTHER), this enjoyable-but-
inconsistent slapstick farce rolls through peaks and valleys of 
laughter.  When it's funny, it's very funny; when it's not, it borders 
on tiresome.</P>
<P>     Benigni is a gifted physical comic with a manic style incorperating 
elements from the repertories of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, John 
Cleese, Steve Martin, and Robin Williams (to name a few).  There's no 
doubt that THE MONSTER was designed as a showcase for Benigni -- after 
all, he not only stars in it, but he also directed, co-wrote, and co-
produced it.  From beginning to end, this film offers a sample of his 
considerable talents.</P>
<P>     The plot borders on irrelevant -- it's just a useful envelope for a 
number of variably funny sketches.  When THE MONSTER opens, we learn 
that there's a serial rapist/killer on the loose.  Over a span of 12 
years, he has killed 18 women, and the police have become desperate to 
get their man.  Aided by a profile compiled by the psychiatrist (Michel 
Blanc) assisting on the case, the cops begin a comprehensive search for 
this monster, this "Mozart of vice."  Through a series of bizarre 
coincidences (which I won't describe here, since they wouldn't be funny 
in print, but are on screen), a nerdy, out-of-work, petty thief named 
Loris (Benigni) is pegged as the chief suspect.  An attractive female 
police officer (Benigni "regular" Nicoletta Braschi) is sent under cover 
to use her charms to catch Loris red-handed.</P>
<P>     THE MONSTER starts out slowly, with only a few sparse laughs during 
the 30-minute setup.  After that, however, it's a roller coaster ride, 
with the lulls coming as unwanted distractions between comic peaks.  
There's a lot of sexual humor here, but, unlike American productions, 
where such comedy usually consists of a few stale, dirty jokes, 
Benigni's material is fresh, uninhibited, and sidesplittingly funny.</P>
<P>     As a curious aside, it should be noted that because this film was 
released into the mainstream Italian market, where it became a huge hit, 
it's in Italian.  However, four of the actors (including Michel Blanc) 
either don't speak the language, or speak it poorly.  As a result, their 
voices were dubbed into Italian, and the poor synchronization of speech 
creates an unintentionally amusing side effect -- a subtitled movie with 
embedded dubbing.</P>
<P>     THE MONSTER is Roberto Benigni's film, and, watching him roar 
through it like a tornado, it's easy to understand his immense 
international appeal.  Whether ogling women, disposing of a dead cat, 
fending of Nicoletta Braschi's advances, or dousing a (literal) fire in 
his pants, the actor is a delight to watch, and THE MONSTER is 
worthwhile because of him.  This isn't a masterpiece of comedy, but 
there are enough hilarious moments to earn it a lukewarm recommendation.</P>
