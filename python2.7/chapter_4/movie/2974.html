<PRE>                      I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
                       A film review by Eric Mankin
                        Copyright 1994 Eric Mankin</PRE>
<P>     The translation of the title doesn't convey the stuffiness of the
original.  DE ESO NO SE HABLA is more, "THAT IS NOT DISCUSSED."  The
reference is to the airtight hypocrisy of the seaside Argentine town
that is the setting of this astringent tale by director Maria Luisa
Bemberg.</P>
<P>     It is the early 1930s: the formidable widow Leonor (Luisina
Brando) refuses to accept the fact that her daughter Charlotte
(Alejandra Podesta) is a dwarf.  On one level, she's Mrs. Gump of the
pampas--"Short is as short does"--but in Bemberg's film the
mother's refusal merges serenely into a municipality-wide structure of
denial.  Everyone in the town systematically avoids discussion of all
unpleasant truths, from the mayor's idiocy to the existence of the
brothel where the entire male population spends every night drinking,
whoring, gambling and listening to scratchily recorded Carlos Gardel
tangos.  The agreement not to communicate is only disturbed when
Ludovico D'Andrea (Marcello Mastroianni) an emigre Italian who is the
only cultured or imaginative man in the town, falls in love with
Charlotte.</P>
<P>     Mastroianni is perfectly cast as the silver-tongued, gallant and
rueful expatriate Don Ludovico.  His presence and the richly detailed,
knowingly satiric period provincial setting both recall Fellini, but
the style is very much Bemberg's own.  The story, narrated by the voice
of an outsider whose identity is one of the film's better revelations,
has a slippery rhythm as catchy and pungent as one of Gardel's
plaintive hymns to love as screwy masculine self-absorption, love in
which the love object is nearly irrelevant.  Bemberg treats Don
Ludovico with affection, but doesn't let her affection for him spoil
her fun.</P>
