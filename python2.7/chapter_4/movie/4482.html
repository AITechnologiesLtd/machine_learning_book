<PRE>                               THE PROFESSIONAL
                       A film review by Lons Ponschock
                        Copyright 1995 Lons Ponschock</PRE>
<PRE>A film by Luc Besson
Starring Jean Reno, Natalie Portman, Gary Oldman</PRE>
<PRE>                   Matilda :  Is life always this bad
                              or just when you're a kid?</PRE>
<PRE>                      Leon :  Always.</PRE>
<P>     THE PROFESSIONAL is a carefully crafted story of revenge ... sort
of what THE CROW tried to be but couldn't compared with this.</P>
<P>     Matilda (Natalie Portman) is a twelve-year-old who has lost her
family in a firefight over drugs.  She seeks refuge with Leon (Jean
Reno), a professional killer.</P>
<P>     So here we have the makings of what could be a piece of
sentimental claptrap arrived just in time for the holidays.  But these
are the makings only.  The story here is wonderful, the language and
script well-done and the revelation of detail occurs in a way that I
wanted the film not to end ... not for a long time.</P>
<P>     *That's* when a picture is really good.  They don't come around
that often and that's the reason that you will see writings here on the
occasion of that triumph and not on the occasion of wasted time on
trayf.</P>
<P>     Mention should be made of the fine performances by Gary Oldman and
Danny Aiello as well.  They always deliver superb performances and
their work here is no exception.  Jean Reno as Leon could be GIGOT in
another era: living out of a suitcase, friendless--with nothing but
his work.  Natalie Portman in what might be a first role makes the part
of Matilda her own in a truly captivating way.</P>
<P>     Captivating is a good word for THE PROFESSIONAL.  It will steal
your heart in a way that other child-adult 'buddy pictures' like
AMERICAN HEART could not reach.  And what you are able to touch in this
film is the emotion of the moment:  a rare gift.</P>
<PRE>                            * * *</PRE>
<P>     It's probably just coincidence, but you know what Leon
spelled backwards is, right?  I knew you did.</P>
<PRE>     Happy Holidays.</PRE>
