<P>   Some movies consider second chances--Brett Ratner's
"The Family Man," for example--about what sort of life we
might have had if only....  Other movies in a similar vein are
more realistic.  We can't change what happened years ago,
but Michael Winterbottom's "The Claim" instructs us about
what one man does when given the chance to make up for a
moral failure in the past.  "The Claim" is not about a guy who
goes to summer school to make up for his 55 in Computer
Science.  In fact the film takes place principally in 1869, 
before computers or electric light bulbs were invented and
about the time that cameras began taking snapshots and
views of town life.  In fact thanks largely to the invention of
photography, Winterbottom's crew, particularly production
designer Mark Tildesley, were able to reconstruct a California
town just as it looked 130 years ago--not the easiest job
considering that the hamlet was erected in minus thirty
degrees temperature with winds sometimes gusting to one
hundred miles per hour.  </P>
<P>   Winterbottom's camera man, Alwin Kuchler, captures the
majesty of Fortress Mountain high in the Canadian Rockies to
simulate the wild west town of Kingdom Come, California--
some twenty years after the discovery of gold led to the
migration of a half million people of pioneer spirit in search of
wealth and a greater degree of independence than the East
could afford. Winterbottom's picture, then, is a western
complete with a town bar (although the manager here is not
named Kitty), with just a fraction of the gunplay of the
traditional genre movie popular during the forties and fifties,
and with some moments of peak drama of the sort exploited
by Fred Zinnemann's "High Noon." </P>
<P>   Inspired by Thomas Hardy's "The Mayor of Casterbridge"
this tale of greed, guilt, and redemption scripted by Frank
Cottrell Boyce centers on a man who is more than the chief
political honcho of the town of Kingdom Come, Daniel Dillon
(Peter Mullan). Dillon runs the town because he owns
everything in it--the bar, the brothel, the bank, the respect of
all who know him and never call him anything but Mr. Dillon. 
In a few brief flashbacks that take us back twenty years, we
find out that he acquired his wealth when, trudging in knee-
deep snow out in nowhere with his wife and newborn baby,
he agrees to a Faustian bargain.  In return for a bag of gold
from a man who insists that he needs a woman more than
the money, he sells his wife Elena (Natassja Kinski) and his
newborn, Hope (Sarah Polley).  During the years of living the
high life, Daniel enjoys the carnal companionship of barkeep
and brothel manager Lucia (Milla Jovovich) and appears to
lack only a railroad to pass through the town--without which
the village could not long prosper.  As Donald Dalglish (Wes
Bentley) scouts areas to find the ideal locations for the tracks
that his company is prepared to construct, he is courted by
Dillon (who tries unsuccessfully to bribe the young man) and
in turn by the lovely twenty-year-old Hope--who has traveled
to the burg with her mother unaware that Dillon is her sell-out
dad.</P>
<P>   Winterbottom presumably shows us what California was
like without the glitter and gloss that slickly commercial
westerns have afforded.  We see that the men rarely change
their clothes and are the sorts that we today would probably
move far away from if traveling with them on the very tracks
that were built over a century ago by thousands of
immigrants making just pennies a day.  The views of the
Rockies are stunning; covered with snow, streams running
through, still virgin land beginning to smart at the
rapaciousness of the builders and miners.  </P>
<P>   What the movie lacks, however, is sufficient character and
plot development.  Moviegoers could be confused by the
flashbacks were they not aware of the ill deed done twenty
years earlier by the principal character, whose feeling of guilt
comes dramatically to the surface when confronted by his
wife and daughter.  The romance between Hope Dillon and
railroad scout Donald Dalglish is odd.  Though love at first
sight does indeed exist, only Sarah Polley's in the role of the
innocent but curious twenty-year-old comes across
convincingly.   Nastassja Kinski, remarkable in Roman
Polanski's "Tess" (also based on a novel by Thomas Hardy),
gets little to do but flash her ghostly, consumption-ridden
pallor across the screen.  Peter Mullan's rendition of a virtual
Nineteenth Century baron--whose fate is foreshadowed when
one of the locals performing in the bar delivers a rendition of
Percy Byshe Shelley's poem "Ozymandias" written in 1817--
overshadows the rest of the cast whether loudly shutting up
the chatty denizens of the bar during a recital by his daughter
or simply looking morose when ultimately considering the
meaninglessness of his wealth.  The Glaswegian perfomer is
well suited to a cast representing the large body of European
immigrants (in this case from Ireland) who had left their
famine-stricken lands in search of gold and glory.  </P>
<P>   While all that glitters is not gold in Winterbottom's film of
American pioneers, many of whom left the claustrophobic
confines of effete cities while others fled from the insularity of
their European homelands--"The Claim" is a reasonably good
meshing of a personal story with a chapter of America at a
time that rugged individualism, and not paper shuffling in
office cubicles, was the order of the day.</P>
