<P>     I mean no disrespect to the burgeoning Bhutanese film industry when I
suggest that being selected as the Bhutanese representative for the Best
Foreign Language Film Oscar doesn't automatically qualify as an impressive
achievement. In fact, THE CUP is the first ever film selected as an
Academy Award candidate from Bhutan, made by a revered Buddhist teacher
making his first film. It's understandable that THE CUP would warrant some
unique attention on this basis. The question is whether anyone would be
paying much attention to THE CUP if it didn't happen to offer a unique
cultural perspective.</P>
<P>     It's always tough to say, but I'm guessing not. There are certainly
some charms in this fact-based bit of whimsy, set in 1998 at a Tibetan
Buddhist monastery-in-exile. The monastery's leaders are awaiting two new
arrivals as the film begins, brothers attempting to make the escape from
occupied Tibet. When they finally do arrive, Palden (Kunsang Nyima) and
Nyima (Pema Tshundup) find the young monks-in-training are currying a
passion for something more than Buddhist teachings: the ongoing World Cup
soccer tournament. The young monk Orgyen (Jamyang Lodro) has taken to
sneaking into town after dark to watch BBC satellite broadcasts, but when
he and some fellow monks are caught by chief disciplinarian Geko (Orgyen
Tobgyal), it looks like no one will be seeing the final match -- unless 
the abbot (Lama Chonjor) grants their request to rent a television to
watch the match in the monastery.</P>
<P>     There's no denying that THE CUP may be worth seeing simply for its
sociology lesson. The monastery is depicted not as a relentlessly somber
place, but as a sort of boarding school with boys who will be boys no
matter their national origin (passing notes during prayers, sewing
another boy's robe to a mat, scribbling nationalist graffiti on the
monastery walls). American films with Tibetan Buddhist themes -- SEVEN
YEARS IN TIBET and KUNDUN -- have often seemed to be so concerned with
telling the story of an important political issue that the personal side
has been lost. It is certainly refreshing to see a story in which Tibetan
people are seen as people, and not merely as martyrs.</P>
<P>     And then one moves past that humanizing appeal, and doesn't find a
whole lot more. Writer/director Khyentse Norbu understands his people, but
he has a lot to learn about structuring a narrative. Even at only 93
minutes, THE CUP drags along towards the monks' eventual efforts to gather
enough money to rent the television and satellite dish, then try to get
the whole apparatus working. It's worth a few chuckles to see the monks
trying to navigate the technology; it's considerably less entertaining
watching the film meander, dabbling in the crowd-pleasing qualities of
shadow puppets and a sort of "Gift of the Magi" sub-plot involving Orgyen
and a younger monk's beloved keepsake.</P>
<P>     The pacing of THE CUP may be perfectly representative of the culture
from which it originates, just as the story itself may be perfectly
representative. I find myself leaning towards a recommendation simply
because it showed me something I didn't know before, which is one of the
reasons I love film in the first place. There's just not much substance to
THE CUP worth getting enthusiastic over, unless the mere notion of Tibetan
monks playing pranks and watching soccer is enough of a hilarious
incongruity to carry your viewing experience. The amateur cast and rookie
director can't make the film soar on its own terms. Khytentse Norbu might
have been better served making a documentary about life among young
Tibetan monks ... or about making Bhutan's first Oscar contender.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 protective cups:  6.</PRE>
