<P>Final Destination: chronicle of a death foretold</P>
<P>Emily Dickinson started one of her poems off 'Because I could not stop for
death / He kindly stopped for me.' James Wong's Final Destination pretty
much just removes the 'kindly' from that idea. It gets going just as the
trailer promises, too: with a fiery plane crash. Meaning we know that this
planeload of students on their senior trip isn't making it to Paris alive.
Meaning this first sequence should, by all counts, be void of all tension,
as we already know the outcome, already know that all these 'portents' Alex
(Devon Sawa) is cueing into aren't just projections of his fear of flying,
but are in fact glimpses into the immediate future. In spite of this
foreknowledge, though--or, perhaps, because of it--Wong's still able to
generate all the nerves the sequence requires and then some (by focusing on
how Alex will get off the plane, not if), which sets the tone for the rest
of the movie, where Alex is the one with foreknowledge. He just doesn't
always know 'how' until almost too late. It's a very effective device.
And of course it's been done before, too, in every slasher movie to roll off
the assembly line. We know Michael/Jason/Freddy/etcetera is going to get
their quota of teens, we just don't always know how. Where Final Destination
distinguishes itself from the crowd, however, is that there's no Michael or
Jason or Freddy. In fact, there's no visually satisfying physical
manifestation of the Grim Reaper at all, which is quite a gamble. It pays
off, though: by keeping Death immaterial, it gains the ability to be
everywhere, charging every moment with the possibility of its presence. In a
way, too, we want Death to be there, to be picking off these people who
should have already died. It answers our need for balance, equilibrium,
justice.
This doesn't mean we want this unlikely crew of survivors to die, either,
though, which is part of the pleasure of Final Destination. Most of the time
it's enough to compel the drama forward via conflict between the characters,
their situation, all that. Final Destination ups the ante a little, by
placing the conflict in us, manipulating us into both sympathizing with the
stalker (Death, who was cheated) and the stalked (who seem to have done
nothing to deserve death, other than being between 12 and 19 in a horror
film). As if this wasn't enough, Final Destination also smuggles the whole
Boethian dilemma into the works: is Alex (God, here, though he denies it)
just 'seeing' all these events before they happen, or are they happening
because he's seeing them? To add to all this, too, there's a wonderful
spooky cameo by Tony Todd (Ben from the Night of the Living Dead remake?).
Here he's a mortician called Bludworth, and--though his role in Final
Destination is more myth-based (he's a 'helper'), and thus not really in
sync with all the slasher conventions--still, his performance is cool enough
that none of that matters. We're too busy listening to the owls calling
everyone's name, the bells tolling for him and him and her, a Faustian death
calling in its marker, all that fun stuff. And yes, 'fun stuff' does include
some lines like "I've got to get my head together" spoken moments after a
decapitation, but, unlike Scream etcetera, Final Destination doesn't live
and breathe by such cuteness. Instead, it just tacks it on here and there,
mutes it down enough to where it's there if you're listening, but doesn't
get in the way if you're not.
Granted, Final Destination is more or less a serious treatment of, say, Bill
& Ted's Bogus Adventure, where they also have to outwit Death (by playing
Battleship, among other things), but it's something in it's own right too,
simply because it rarely takes the easy way out, doesn't go for the cheap
scream each time. In this regard, it feels a lot like Disturbing Behavior,
only it's got a little more substance to it. And, like Lord of the
Illusions, it holds just enough back for--in Nix's words--"one final
illusion." All horror tries to do this, and only few succeed. Final
Destination is in the latter category here. And it gets there by not
breaking the rules it's already established, which is something of a feat in
itself, to say nothing of how elaborately that last death is staged, Mr.
Rube Goldberg. Never has 'how' been so fun to answer.</P>
