<P>An early Wednesday evening at home.  Walk in the door, open a bag of chips,
check e-mail.  Nothing interesting, much.  Change clothes, put on running
shoes.  Walk outside.  Raining too hard.  Walk back inside.  Decide to wait
and see if rain stops.  Turn computer monitor back on, pull up game for a
few minutes.  Rain gets heavier, thunder gets louder.  ZOT!!!  Power goes
off.  Power stays off.</P>
<P>Hunger builds, dinnertime approaches.  No microwave, no oven, no
refrigerator, even.  Dry cleaners close at seven.  Walk to car in driving
rain, start engine, get to dry cleaners five minutes before close.  Still
hungry.  Stop by Chuy's, get chicken enchiladas in green chile sauce.  Have
to stop eating like this.  Diet starts soon.</P>
<P>Rain stops on drive home.  Check mailbox on way in.  Get electric bill.
Chuckle at irony.  Get dry cleaning out of car.  Rain stops.  Walk in door,
power still not on.  Open window, read paper until too dark to read
anymore.  Power still not on.</P>
<P>True Crime starts in twenty minutes at dollar theater.  Clint Eastwood
stars and directs.  Better than sitting around in dark room.</P>
<P>Drive to movie theater, arrive as previews start.  Trailer for The Mummy
looks cooler than expected.  Never Been Kissed trailer looks stupid.
Wonder who would ever want to go back to high school.</P>
<P>Movie starts.  San Quentin Prison, exterior scene.  Didn't know San Quentin
was on the Pacific.  Scene where warden talks to condemned criminal.  Blah
sort of scene.</P>
<P>Here is Clint, at a bar, with a young girl.  Clint drinks a tall drink with
a stalk of celery in it.  Wonder how much celery a bar goes through in a
week.  Clint chats up the girl, tells her he stopped drinking, hits on her
a little.  Girl feels uncomfortable, leaves bar, drives away.</P>
<P>Girl is driving drunk in the rain.  Worse yet, girl decides to change radio
stations.  Girl comes up on Deadman's Curve, spins out, dies in horrible
preventable car crash.  Yet another innocent life sacrificed to make a
corny plot point.  Wonder when we will ever learn from these tragedies?</P>
<P>Clint is needed to replace girl on story about imminent execution of
condemned criminal from first scene.  James Woods and Denis Leary talk bad
about Clint behind his back.  Woods actually looks like he's doing a Denis
Leary impression.  Denis Leary glowers a lot, not wanting to upstage Woods
while he's doing his Denis Leary impression.</P>
<P>Clint comes into newsroom and is shocked and horrified over girl's death
for about two minutes.  Clint starts to investigate story, asking questions
about murder that the condemned man allegedly committed.  Clint stops to
light up cigarettes over protests of co-workers and to have a boring
conversation with his secretary about sexual harassment.  Wonder if anybody
ever told Dirty Harry Callahan to stop smoking.</P>
<P>Clint also calls his wife, who is Diane Venora, who was pretty good in The
Jackal, which was otherwise pretty bad.  Clint's wife reminds him to take
his daughter to the zoo.  Clint intersperses investigation into innocence
of condemned man with family life, doing neither well.  Dirty Harry
Callahan never would have stopped to take anyone to the zoo that he wasn't
feeding to the tigers.</P>
<P>Scenes go in in prison in the meantime.  Michael McKean plays a
smarmy-looking prison chaplain who gives a bad name to chaplains
everywhere.  The warden and the prison guards are nice enough people, doing
their jobs.  The condemned man shares some awkward moments with his
family.  He decides to have steak for his last meal.  Would choose some
more of those chicken enchiladas myself.</P>
<P>Clint drives around Bay Area, confronting people.  Eventually, he confronts
the condemned man (Isaiah Washington), who explains why he is not guilty.
Clint believes him, so he must not be guilty.  Can Clint save him before
time runs out?  Remind self that Clint is the director and the producer and
Clint can pretty much do what he wants.</P>
<P>Finish watching movie.  Marvel at silliness of ending.  Wonder if this is
just a potboiler for Clint to make other, better movies.  Hope that this is
indeed the case.  Respect the quality of Clint's acting, and the good work
of the supporting cast, but wonder what the screenwriter was thinking.  Ask
self if this was really better than sitting alone in a dark room waiting
for the power to come back on.</P>
<P>Leave theater disappointed.  Drive home.  The power is back on!  Write
review, reset clocks, go to sleep.</P>
