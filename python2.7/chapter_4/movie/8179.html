                    THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Featuring the voices of Tom Hulce, Tony Jay, Demi Moore, Kevin Kline,
Paul Kendall, Jason Alexander, Charles Kimbrough, Mary Wickes, David
Ogden Stiers Directors: Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise Story for the
Screen by Tab Murphy, freely adapted from the novel by Victor Hugo
Music: Alan Menken Lyrics: Stephen Schwartz</P>
<P>Friendships develop from common interests and similar situations. So it
is not surprising when a beautiful gypsy girl, who is considered an
outcast, befriends an ugly, hunchback, who is alienated from human kind.</P>
<P>What is considered by fellow critics as a dark, Disney venture, is in
fact the most true to life cartoon epic to date. 'Alladin' was fun,
'Beauty and the Beast' was romantic, but unrealistic, 'The Lion King'
was about good and bad animals, and 'Pocahontas' well, that  little
Indian Princess was a little too much for me. In 'Hunchback' there's no
beast that transforms into a prince at the end, and the 'hero' does not
end up happily ever after. The road he walks can only be filled with
life's difficult hurdles created by the misfortune of his deformity.</P>
<P>This is a tale of living with ridicule, triumphing over self-doubt and
understanding self-worth, where sacrifice over selfishness is the
ultimate gift. Like most of us, the Hunchback ends up alone without the
'pretty girl'. His only reward for his good deed, being a better
understanding of himself, and a steadfast belief of what he is capable
of.</P>
<P>Comment: What next? The Elephant Man?</P>
