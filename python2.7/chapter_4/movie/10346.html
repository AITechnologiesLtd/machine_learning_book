<P>Review of "The Man Who Would Be King" (1975), by Regis M. Donovan</P>
<P>John Huston's adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's "The Man Who Would Be
King" is a classic swashbuckler about two former British soldiers who
decide, in true colonial imperialistic style, to take their guns,
march into the untouched wilds, and carve out a place among the
savages so they can live as kings.</P>
<P>The two errant adventurers, Danny Dravot (Sean Connery) and Peachy
Carnehan (Michael Caine), head into the unknowns of Kafiristan where
they find a kingdom untouched by the modern world and ruled long ago
by Alexander the Great.  After the help of some incredible
coincidences and a few Masonic symbols, the two manage to convince the
priestly rulers that Dravot is a god.</P>
<P>Of course, hubris like Dravot's must be followed by a fall, and
eventually things collapse into fighting, heroic endings, and British
stiff upper lips.</P>
<P>Originally conceived as a vehicle for Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart,
Huston provides an adventure that received 4 Academy Award nominations
including one for best adapted screenplay.  Connery and Caine
admirably head a marvelous cast including Christopher Plummer (as
Rudyard Kipling) and Saeed Jaffrey.</P>
