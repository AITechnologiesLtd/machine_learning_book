 Gone in 60 Seconds (2000) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Nicolas Cage,
Angelina Jolie, Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Duvall, Delroy Lindo, Will
Patton and Vinnie Jones. Screenplay by Scott Rosenberg. Directed by
Dominic Sena. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P> I was not looking forward to Gone in 60 Seconds. I was expecting an
overblown multimillion stunt extravaganza featuring non-stop, repetitive
car chases, crashes and explosions.</P>
<P> I turned out to be a bit off center. Gone in 60 Seconds is one of those
movies for which you buy a bucket of popcorn, put your brain in neutral,
sit back and enjoy the ride.</P>
<P> The movie is a noisy bit of entertainment with a surprising touch of
characterization to boot. Itís nothing more than preposterous fun.</P>
<P> Borrowing only the basics from the 1974 original that was a Southern
drive-in favorite of that era along with such titles as Eat My Dust and
Grand Theft Auto, Gone in 60 Seconds centers on a gang of car thieves
headed by Randall ìMemphisî Raines (Nicolas Cage).</P>
<P> ìMemphisî had quit the business six years earlier and fled Los Angeles,
But he is forced to take up his old career after his brother, Kip
(Giovanni Ribisi), is jammed up by a big-time operator who threatens to
kill him unless his order of 50 exotic cars is met.</P>
<P> ìMemphisî has four days to gather up his old crew, plan and execute the
thefts.</P>
<P> Considering the title and its origins, there is not as much activity as
youíd expect in Gone in 60 Seconds.</P>
<P> While the centerpiece of the original was a 40-minute chase, there are
relatively few action pieces in this remake. Most of the film deals with
the planning of the various heists, plus the interaction of the
characters.</P>
<P> Which is not to say that Gone in 60 Seconds is all talk and no
movement. The car chase finale is an exciting sequence of stunt driving
by all involved. Smartly, the filmmakers build to this muscle-vehicle
finale.</P>
<P> The glue of the film is its cast. Cage is likable as the reluctant
ìMemphis,î forced back into a life he was happy to abandon, while Ribisi
is the resentful, bitter younger brother who feels abandoned by his
legendary sibling.</P>
<P> Others in the cast include Robert Duvall as an old-time carjacker; Will
Patton as a tough, but honorable former colleague of ìMemphisî; and a
dreadlocked Angelina Jolie as ìSway,î the former girlfriend and member
of the ìMemphisî crew.</P>
<P> Also worth noticing is Vinnie Jones as Sphinx, the silent member of the
gang. He is compelling to watch without saying a word.</P>
<P> Delroy Lindo is straight and stalwart as the police detective out to
nab the gang.</P>
<P> The movieís score by Trevor Rabin at times is a bit too pounding and
overwrought.</P>
<P> The too-good-to-believe finale is, of course, totally illogical, but,
by then you donít mind. After all, this is fantasy, not a documentary.</P>
<P> Those expecting 100 minutes of high-speed driving, grinding metal and
fireballs may be a tad disappointed by Gone in 60 Seconds. It's not a
big-screen version of Foxís ìScariest Police Chasesî series.</P>
<P> Gone in 60 Seconds is merely a good-time, fast-track feature. Merely
take it at face value ó and donít forget to buckle up.</P>
