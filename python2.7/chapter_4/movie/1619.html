<PRE>                                    ALADDIN
                       A film review by Roger Snappy Rubio
                        Copyright 1992 Roger Snappy Rubio</PRE>
<P>     Walt Disney and Company have done it again.  They've managed to
take a well-known tale of a boy and his lamp and infuse new life into
it.  This movie is the kind that all critics call an 'instant classic.'
Well, I don't know about that, but it will definitely take it's place
among the other Disney masterpieces.</P>
<P>     If you don't already know, ALADDIN is the story of a young street
rat who is the only one who can enter the Cave of Wonders and retrieve a
magic lamp, which, of course, houses the famous genie that this story is
so famous for.  Aladdin himself, however, doesn't know this, and the
only one who does know is the evil Jafar, counsel to the Sultan.
Meawhile, Princess Jasmine, daughter of the Sultan, is trying hard to
escape from any kind of arranged marriage, so she runs away, only to
bump into our hero, Aladdin.  The rest is, shall we say, a la Disney.</P>
<P>     Disney is famous for taking fairy tales and turning them into
movies so happy that audiences scream for them.  Not to be cynical, but
movies like this are in large demand and short supply.  You might think
that Hollywood would supply more of these kinds of movies, but I guess
there's all that killing and raping and psychological torture out there
to cover.  Hollywood can't forget about that.  If Hollywood can't
forget, then why is it that G-rated movies are among the top grossing
movies at the box office?  You would think Hollywood would get the
message.</P>
<P>     Well, Disney has certainly gotten the message.  Even though ALADDIN
has the prerequisite evil person (in this case Jafar) who's purpose is
to scare the beejeezers out of the little kids, the movie as a whole is
still a delight.  I've noticed that the Disney films as of late have
been getting a little violent even for their G-ratings, but I believe
it's just a function of society.  And society is demanding more violence
in their movies, mostly due to desensitization.</P>
<P>     But don't let that scare you away.  ALADDIN is still a treat.
Unfortunately, it is the last effort of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman as
a song-writing team, because Ashman died of AIDS during the making of
this film.  As a result, ALADDIN doesn't have as many songs as their
other collaborations, THE LITTLE MERMAID and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  It
is also a little different from those two.  But it stands on it's own,
and should not be discounted.  The animation is first-rate, the
characters are varied and, as usual, very distinct from each other, and
the story is the perfect vehicle for the Disney style.  The genie (voice
by Robin Williams) is hilarious, and it is he who really gives this
movie it's life.  After all, what is the story of ALADDIN really famous
for?</P>
<PRE>     Check it out.  It will, at the very least, bring a smile to your
face, whether you like it or not.</PRE>
