<PRE>                                 THE HILL
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>The Hill (1965) ***1/2 out of ***** - Cast:Sean Connery, Harry Andrews,
Ossie Davis.  Directed by: Sidney Lumet.  Running Time: 122 minutes.</P>
<P>The "hill" refers to a 60 foot high pile of sand and rocks which is used to
discipline soldiers in a British military prison during World War II.
Soldiers are forced to run up and down the hill at full speed in full combat
gear, under a blazing hot Africa sun. </P>
<P>Sean Connery plays Joe Roberts, imprisoned at the camp for disobeying an
order that surely would of gotten him killed. The story follows him and
his cellmates as they are subjected to brutal punishment for their crimes,
punishment that gets one of them killed. The remaining soldiers in the
cell then have to fight the system in order to bring the guard responsible
for the man's death to justice. But it's not an easy task.</P>
<P>I had two problems with the film. One is that the actor's accents are very
thick and at times difficult to understand. The other is that the film
builds and builds, getting very tense going into the final scene. Then
something odd happens as the words "THE END" appear on screen. The story
wasn't over yet! But no, this is one of those 60's films that doesn't have
an ending, something which I cannot stand. But, the cast gives great
performances, specifically Andrews as the Sergeant Major in charge of the
camp. There is some excellent camera work here too, especially the opening
shot.</P>
