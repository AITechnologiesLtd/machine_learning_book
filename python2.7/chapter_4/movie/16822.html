<P>Black comedies -- those movies which make light of serious and usually
morbid situations -- come in a number of different varieties, each with
their own levels of hilarity and cleverness. GROSSE POINTE BLANK is a
good example of a well-done black comedy: subtle, witty, and
straightforward. It moved quickly to keep expectations high, and it
ended up doing much better than expected. ANALYZE THIS, the latest for
this genre from CADDYSHACK helmer Harold Ramis, does not have these
elements perfected; instead, it's a lighter, breezier comedy of
outrageous situations. </P>
<P>The outrageous situations are supposed to draw laughs in their own
right: mob boss seeks psychiatric help. But the premise lends itself to
very little thematically, causing the movie to fall into a repetitive
order. The leading names, Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro, add some
life to their roles but don't give them excessive dimension. </P>
<P>De Niro is New York mobster Paul Vitti, head of one the many crime
families struggling for dominance in the area. After a lengthy monologue
which establishes his place in the crime scene, Vitti luckily avoids an
assassination attempt. Unfortunately his friend takes the bullet
instead, and Vitti is shaken by the affair. Having in his possession --
by a bizzare chain of circumstances -- the name of psychiatrist Ben
Sobol (Crystal), he seeks help and proceeds to drag the unwitting Sobol
into the comically portrayed mob life. </P>
<P>This story is simple enough, and has moments of comic genius, most of
which are manifested by a Vitti henchman named Jelly (Joe Viterelli).
Unfortunately, most of the movie sees this character dragging
psychiatrist Sobol out of his life so he can "help" Vitti, and his
efforts are wasted. The movie does manage to break this pattern toward
the end of its running time, picking up steam with some great comedy
sequences from Billy Crystal. Even with a GODFATHER parody, though, the
movie never really manages to muster any true comedy. </P>
<P>Instead, it plays out like to A-list actors goofing around. It's easy to
see that Crystal and De Niro are having fun, but the real question is
whether or not the audience is having fun. And in this case, the answer
is: not as much as they should have. </P>
