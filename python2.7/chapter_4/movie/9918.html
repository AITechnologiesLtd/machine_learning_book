                MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL</PRE>
<P>The following review may contain spoilers.  Those who do not wish to be
spoiled should stop here, but anyone who is not a Kevin Spacey fan might
as well pass this film, and I'll explain why. </P>
<P>It is unfair to call the entire movie boring and terrible.  Unfortunately,
it's likely the impression of the viewers as they walk out of the theater,
because the 2nd half of the film leaves very little favorable traces in
their memory.  I was quite fascinated and impressed by the first hour or
so of this movie, in which a New York reporter comes down to Savanah to
write a 500-word essay about the famous Christmas party given by local
celebrity Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey), an antique and art dealer who
specializes in reviving old houses of Savanah.  Through the eyes of the
reporter John Kelso (John Cusack), the audience are led into the bizzare
and interesting world of colorful characters, beautiful architecture,
voodoo practioner, and social small talks that you wouldn't expect to hear
anywhere else.  </P>
<P>I have not read the book, so I can only judge from what on the screen.
Although fregmented and seemingly unconnected, these elements are very
enjoyable as we watch Mr. Kelso stroll through the streets of Savanah and
Mr. Williams' Mansion filled with paintings, antiques, Faberge eggs, and
hundreds of other dazzling props all over the place.  My attention was
held tightly throughout the first part of the film with these scattered
pieces, until the murder takes place.  Mr. Williams shot his homosexual
lover Billy Henson (Jude Law) in his study on Christmas night.  He claims
self-defense, but the prosecutor put him on trial for first degree murder.
The big trial thing is supposed to be the center of the film, and the
second half of the film spend almost every minute on it, which basically
ruined the film.  </P>
<P>The second half of the film abandons the mixture of surprises, fascination
and fun of the first half, and focuses on 3 characters only -- Kelso,
Williams' lawyer Sonny Seiler (Jack Thompson) and a drag queen Lady
Chablis (played by him/herself).  At first funny and eccentric, Lady
Chablis quickly degenerates into a bunch of old drag jokes that lack
neither local flavor nor originality.  Seiler provides some really
overblown courtroom drama that is not nearly to the level of any episode
of "Law and Order".  Kelso is the least interesting character, which is
natural, since he's from the Big Apple, yet he is given a lot of time on
screen to go through the boring and predictable P.I. act trying to clear
Williams' name. </P>
<P>I have a big problem with the screenplay (written by John Lee Hencock),
which handles this material so weakly and poorly.  The characters are
drawn only superficially while dumb and tiring "who-done-it" senario goes
on and on and on.  I found my mind drifting away and growing more and more
impatient everytime the camera returns to the courtroom.  The filmmakers
mistakenly believe that the audience care about the mystery of whether
Williams is guilty and whether the jury will convict or aquit him, both
totally beside the point.  I cannot care less about either, and am hungry
for more about the motivation, relationship and emotions of the
characters, especially that of Williams.  No real attempt was made to
describe his affair with Hanson, or with anyone else in town.  It is
particularly disappointing since Kevin Spacey gave such a mysterious and
intriguing performance as the art dealer. </P>
<P>Kevin Spacey once again gains a commanding presence in every scene he is
in and makes me miss him in every scene he is not in.  He plays Jim
Williams with elegance, confidence, class, subtlety, and hidden
complexity.  Unspeakable charm oozes out of him and spills all over the
screen.  Looking exquisitely appealing with a thick mustache and grey
hair, he sustains a style that is similar to that of Jack Vicennce in "LA
Confidential" yet visibly different and distinct.  He contains so much
mystery in his character that I wish to know more -- is his relationship
with Hanson like that of William Somerset Maugham? why did he request
Kelso to cover his party? how did he make his fortune?  Most important,
how is his conscience after killing his lover?  Alas, he was given minimal
time and lines in the later hour and half of the film, which is a huge
mistake.  From a female point of view, I feel that the character's
homosexuality is not very convincing and a little contrived in Spacey's
performance, but I could be wrong. </P>
<P>I have nothing against John Cusack, but he is not given too much to work
with here.  His character goes through a series of facial expression of
astonishment in the first half of the movie, and then a series of
expression of embarrassment with prolonged plot involving Lady Chablis'
affection for him.  He is simply not very interesting, and the filmmakers
make him even duller in an effort to emphasis the fact that John Kelso is
a straight man.  They even go as far as shooting a routine and sketchy
romance between Kelso and local blonde Mandy Nichols (Alison Eastwood)
that contributes nothing to the film.  Somehow I got the impression that
the filmmakers do not feel that a gay character like Jim William can carry
the film and the audience need a straight, plain character like Kelso to
root for, so Kelso becomes the center of the story.  But they truly
underestimated Spacey's charisma and capability. </P>
<P>As Williams' line near the end of the film, "Truth is in the eyes of the
beholder."  I did not care for a moment to find out if he is indeed
guilty, or if the jury will let him go.  The character himself is far more
fascinating than any event happening outside of his mind and his slick
smiles (which tickles me every time he flashes them!).  The terrible
editing replaces the shots of beautiful Savanah scenery with dreadful
courtroom.  The voodoo lady Minerva (Irma P. Hall) never does provide any
words of depth or revelation no matter how fancy the acts are.
Allison Eastwood's character is incredibly blurry and dull that we
practically know nothing about her and her past by the end of the
film.  The happen ending feels ridiculously forced and dumb.  Jack N.
Green's cinematography is gorgeous, but like Kevin Spacey's performance,
it is not given nearly enough time.  Superficial, uninvolving, the movie
feels like a piece of good work that never happened.  I give the film a
C+.  However, Spacey makes the two and a half hour entirely worthy.  </P>
