<PRE>Review:</PRE>
<P>For those who consider themselves fans (or perhaps scholars) of the Coen
brothers' work, this movie could perhaps be somewhat of a disappointment --
not because it isn't absolutely incredible, but because        I think it's more
accessible and (though still noticably Coenian) less, shall we say,
"quirky".</P>
<P>Anyway, I think that 85% of the critics' problems with this movie can be
attributed to the success of "Fargo".  I really wasn't much of a fan of
"Fargo", but it seems that I am pretty much the only person who can honestly
say that.  I think my point is that you shouldn't go into this movie
expecting "Fargo" (or "Raising Arizona" or "Millers Crossing" or "Barton
Fink").  Where most of their other movies have humor that sort of peeks out
from under a bunch of violence or weirdness or both, "The Big Lebowski" is a
great deal more straightforward.  Don't get me wrong, the film is actually
quite confusing -- just not that weird.</P>
<P>The movie is about a middle aged, unemployed, pot-smoking, White Russian
drinking fellow who calls himself "The Dude" and was, according        to the
interview included on the DVD, based on a friend of the Coen brothers, which
I found interesting.  It's the laid back attitude of "The Dude" that is the
basis for most of the humor in the movie.  Whether he's saying "Hey,
careful,
man, there's a beverage here!" as someone muscles him into the back seat of
a car or trying to placate Walter (John Goodman), his friend and bowling
partner who pulls a gun on the lanes, it's The Dude's drug-induced calm that
makes you laugh.</P>
<P>The only thing about the movie that I really am not fond of is the presence
of a couple of small musical numbers.  Fortunately, they are easily
overlooked
and don't hurt the movie to a great extent.  In        closing, try the movie if</P>
<PRE>        A) the idea of examining the life of a middle-aged slacker
           against the backdrop of the kidnapping of a young trophy
           wife is appealing to you
        B) you like the Coen brothers
        C) you like jokes about lanky, child-molesting bowlers named
           Jesus.</PRE>
<PRE>Personally, I would go with "C"</PRE>
