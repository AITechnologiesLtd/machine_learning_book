<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   Among science-fiction and fantasy aficionados, few film sagas have
   captured the imagination as much as the ALIEN movie franchise, which
   started off with a bang in 1979's unbearably creepy Ridley Scott
   'haunted house-in-space' entry, and continued with a new bent in
   James Cameron's pulse-pounding action-thriller ALIENS in 1986 (an
   exceptionally well-crafted piece of storytelling which I maintain is
   among the best films of its type ever made).  While David Fincher's
   artsy neo-bleak take on the series in 1992's ALIEN3 only succeeded in
   largely alienating (no pun intended) the sizable mainstream audience
   which the prior two films had accumulated and was deemed a box-office
   dud, it was imbued with a collection of interesting new concepts
   which, given the death of feisty protagonist Ripley at the film's
   conclusion, appeared would never be built upon -- until the
   announcement of a fourth entry in the series: ALIEN RESURRECTION,
   whose marketing tagline is "Witness The Resurrection", but might as
   well have been "Ripley's Back!".  About twenty minutes into the
   highly-anticipated new film, I was suddenly struck by the realisation
   that I found myself experiencing something that I'd never expected to
   occur during the screening of an entry in the venerable ALIEN series:
   I was bored.</P>
<P>   Despite all of the horrendous one-liners in the film -- it's hard to
   believe that Joss Whedon actually wrote this dialogue -- and a basic
   scenario which is woefully stale, one can definitely see the seeds of
   intrigue that enticed star Sigourney Weaver to pull her Ripley
   character out of mothballs for this fourth entry in the series.
   (Let's ignore, for the moment, the $11 million paycheque as an
   alternate motivating factor).  There are some interesting and
   imaginative new concepts in this film, and the strange symbiosis
   between the aliens and Ripley here logically follows from the
   previous three films which have seen the two entities increasingly
   intertwined in an idiosyncratic love-hate relationship.  For a $70
   million-budgeted entry in a huge commercial franchise, there's daring
   evidence of a curiously awkward fusion of arthouse sensibilities with
   the film's basic chase narrative.</P>
<P>   However, the film fails to fully develop upon its more intricate
   elements, and instead teeters precariously between conventional
   action and allegorism, failing to satisfy fans of either camps and
   often resulting in unintentional laughs.  More critically
   problematic, however, is the wretched dialogue in the film, filled
   with snappy, attitude-ladened quips which pander to the audience and
   come off as desperately soundbite-friendly.  Or even less so: when
   Ripley matter-of-factly uttered her one-word retort to the exhibition
   of a fork during her period of re-education, I felt my heart sink.</P>
<P>   Danny Boyle (of SHALLOW GRAVE, TRAINSPOTTING, and A LIFE LESS
   ORDINARY fame -- well, maybe not the last one) was originally courted
   to take over helming duties for the project, but after he ultimately
   turned the job down, THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN's Jean-Pierre Jeunet
   signed on for the project.  Under his wing, the film is predictably
   stylishly directed and filled with Mr. Jeunet's trademark striking
   visuals; there's a distinctly dull, ugly ocher look permeating the
   film, even becoming occasionally grainy as shot by celebrated
   cinematographer Darius Khondji (who won well-deserved plaudits for
   his stunning work in SE7EN), but the impressive (if overly familiar)
   grungy look doesn't make up for the film's more fundamental problems.</P>
<P>   Chief among them is the absence of rich characters in the film.  For
   the most part, the space pirates which eventually make up the hardy
   band struggling to survive the alien onslaught are nondescript and
   lack personality (except, perhaps, for the crass loudmouth Johner
   (Ron Perlman) --  he simply has a bad one).  The characterization in
   Mr. Whedon's screenplay is woeful -- contrast the ALIEN RESURRECTION
   group against the characters in ALIENS, where even minor characters
   like Vasquez and Gorman are well-developed and consequently memorable
   -- and the resultant effect is very little inherent interest in the
   fates of the film's characters and whether they live or die.  For a
   film whose latter half is essentially an extended chase sequence,
   this is not fortuitous.</P>
<P>   Even worse, our beloved heroine Ellen Ripley, newly revived as a
   clone restored from preserved DNA blood samples, isn't entirely human
   -- she's an alien/human hybrid that's consequently more reptilian in
   nature (ineffectively depicted in a scene where she plays
   *basketball*, for crying out loud), possesses a cold and passionless
   demeanour, and has acidic blood coursing through her veins.  It's an
   innovative idea and definitely a new approach to take with the
   character, but it doesn't work: heartlessly ruthless and caustic,
   she's hardly a compelling character, and it's difficult to be engaged
   or really touched by the plight of such a frigid, dryly-observed
   protagonist.</P>
<P>   ALIEN RESURRECTION also suffers from a mundanely straightforward
   storyline which is overly rehashed from previous entries in the
   series.  It's a given from the outset that the film will eventually
   settle into a familiar predicament where Ripley and her company of
   mercenaries will attempt to escape from the marauding aliens, but the
   degree to which this echoes the scenario from ALIENS (heroes must
   evade monsters and reach escape ship before the venue is
   cataclysmically destroyed) is striking, and the sudden leap involved
   between the chase sequence and the initial thread of the scientists
   onboard the Auriga space station studying and attempting to cultivate
   the aliens (highlighted in a scene which plays as a less sympathetic
   rendition straight out of George Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD) is
   remarkably jarring; it's as if the filmmakers were vainly struggling
   to figure out how to get the film between points A and B, and finally
   threw their arms in the air.  The identity and motivations of a
   mysterious entity amidst the space corsairs, an elfin mechanic named
   Call (Winona Ryder -- umm, what happened?) is far less enigmatic that
   desired, while when the "8" tattoo on Ripley is revealed, indicating
   that she's the successful byproduct of the eighth cloning attempt,
   it's inevitable that the results of the seven previous attempts will
   eventually be encountered.  This sequence, strongly reminiscent of a
   similar scene in Tobe Hooper's goofy THE FUNHOUSE, attempts to be so
   filled with pathos that it's mildly disconcerting that the end result
   is near-laughable due to distractingly poor model work.</P>
<P>   The one impressive sequence is that of the film's heroes being
   pursued underwater, a visually impressive and mildly surreal
   experience in an interesting new context where the tension in the
   scene is heightened by deliberately slowing down and drawing out the
   pace of the action.  It's a smart section of the film -- there's
   nothing quite as dreadful as seeing your demise slowly unfold in
   front of you, and being completely helpless to do anything to prevent
   it -- and I only wish that more of the film had been as adept.</P>
<P>   At one point in the film, there was a briefest of glimpses of the
   vulnerable, fearful, and engagingly humanized Ripley which was so
   compelling in the first two entries of the series, and that reminds
   one of just how potent and riveting this film series once was; that's
   the Ripley that I wanted to see.  The susceptible Ripley temporarily
   fought its way to the surface, but was quickly shunted away, usurped
   by her new ultra-cool, wisecracking, bad-ass persona.  With ALIEN
   RESURRECTION, the series has finally collapsed under a weight of
   style and attitude.</P>
