<PRE>                               BLADE 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
               1 :-) out of 4 for a new breed of dark hero</PRE>
<P>Cast: Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright,
Donal Logue.
Screenplay: David S. Goyer, based on the character published by Marvel
Comics.
Director: Stephen Norrington</P>
<P>In an age when sane, clean-cut superheroes like Superman, are becoming
redundant, up rises a new generation of wannabe superheroes, that are
labelled complex, on virtue of their personality disorders alone -
namely BATMAN, SPAWN and now BLADE. I guess today's generation finds a
hero with a dark psyche, more fascinating, and an anti-hero more
appealing.</P>
<P>In a day and age when vampire movies rarely see the light of day, a vain
attempt is made to bring life back into the genre. The creator has
decided to make Blade an extra special vamp with more blood on top. His
mom was bitten when he was still in her womb, thus giving Blade the
special powers of a vampire, yet retaining his humanity. Blade can fly
at night, but he can also walk in daylight.</P>
<P>This is pleasant enough, but one doesn't sense the anguish or turmoil of
what is like to be a half-breed. Wesley Snipes (BLADE) manages an
abandoned look whenever he discusses his inner torment, and convulses
adequately enough, whenever he takes a serum to suppress his blood
sucking urges; but this is a rather superficial look at a man-vampire
who is living in a nightmare. Like that other guy SPAWN (don't bother
watching), deep inside WE KNOW there is a lot more going on than just an
ability to kick butt, severe heads, dismember limbs and special effects.</P>
<P>Move over BUFFY, your days of coy vampire slaying are over. BLADE's
arrived and will give you a better run for your money when it comes to
high grade, state-of-the-art, artillery and weapons. Yes, the special
effects are good, and there is enough blood, explosions and noise to
satisfy the cravings of any violent viewer. A particular scene that
misuses the sprinkler system to feed vampires is not for the faint of
heart. The ending is also rather coy, where a blood sucking scene is
used to imitate love making, before BLADE is then inspired to beat the
bad guy, Frost (Stephen Dorf). Who says you shouldn't have sex before a
big match?</P>
