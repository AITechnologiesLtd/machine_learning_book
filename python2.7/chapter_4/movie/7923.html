<PRE>                        MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND
                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>
<P>Those wonderful Muppets, they sing, they dance, they laugh and have a
lot more fun than a lot of humans -- gosh, I wish I was a Muppet, puppet.</P>
<P>The entire gang is back, they've converted Robert Louis Stevenson's
classic drama 'Treasure Island' into a musical comedy for children of
all ages.</P>
<P>They sing to the tune of Hans Zimmer, bleating out corny lyrics with
great enthusiasm; we actually get to see their feet when they dance;
they run about wildly beating each other up, with the occasional torture
scene for added variety. The kid Jim Hawkins sings with a high soprano
voice that makes me squirm; Long John Silver has a talking lobster, not
parrot, who is a proficient masochist; Kermit is the decent, lovable
captain and Miss Piggy is the Queen of the Island natives.</P>
<P>Have you ever seen a pig dressed in a tight, low cleavage, tiger skin
patterned cocktail dress? Well there's only one pig that can wear it
well, and believe me it clings marvellously to her, revealing all of her
feminine charms as she hangs upside down, dangling from a burning rope
tied to a tree over a cliff.</P>
<PRE>Miss Piggy is a Goddess.</PRE>
<P>The thing I like about the Muppets is that they are never self conscious
about what they do. They are bold and daring without being crude or
obnoxious and are out to entertain with their easy going, frolicking
style.</P>
