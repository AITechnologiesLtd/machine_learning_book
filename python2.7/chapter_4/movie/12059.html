 Sony Pictures Classics
 Director: Brian Gilbert
 Writer: Julian Mitchell from Richard Ellmann's "Oscar Wilde"
 Cast:  Stephen Fry, Jude Law, Jennifer Ehle, Tom Wilkinson,
Vanessa Redgrave</P>
<P>    Oscar Wilde once said "In this world there are only two
tragedies.  One is not getting what one wants, and the other
is getting it."  This can be paraphrased by a similar axiom,
"Don't wish too hard for what you want.  You may get it." 
Why is this philosophy the central conceit of "Wilde," a
heartfelt biopic of the great 19th-century writer's later years? 
Simply this. Wilde was married to a woman he loved and was
devoted to the children he had with her.  Had he remained
faithful while dashing off successful plays like "The
Importance of Being Earnest" and stories like "The Picture of
Dorian Gray," his tragedy would be his failure to give in to his
deeply felt homosexual longings.  He would, in fact, be the
very hypocrite he disparaged in another marvelous theatrical
piece, "Lady Windermere's Fan," which uncovers a scandal
that threatens the idyllic early married life of Lord and Lady
Windermere in turn-of-the-century London.  To avoid the
tragedy of hypocrisy, he gives in to his natural inclination--his
love for his fellow man--is found out, disgraced, tried for
violation of England's sodomy laws and imprisoned at hard
labor for two years.  </P>
<P>   Yet the anguish which afflicted him could have been
avoided.  Wilde could have continued enjoying his double life,
retaining the loyalty of his devoted wife, had he not blown his
cool and attacked one of the most powerful people in London
society.  "Wilde" is the story of the fatal flaw that not only
propelled the writer's downfall but contributed directly to his
death at the age of 46.</P>
<P>   As portrayed by Stephen Fry--whose formidably large
demeanor is strikingly similar to the writer's--Wilde is a
colossus of a man whose wit matches his height and girth
and whose appeal is so broad-based that he can wow a
crowd of Colorado miners as easily as he captures the
attention of London bluebloods.  The film opens, surprisingly
enough, in the Wild West, where Wilde delivers a talk on
Socrates to a rapt body of grimy workers in a Leadville,
Colorado quarry in 1882.  After completing a one-year's
lecture tour in the U.S. and Canada, he is wed to the lovely
Constance (Jennifer Ehle) and has two sons, though it's
obvious from the way he had looked at the bare-chested
fellows in Colorado he has yet to mine nature's entreaties to
indulge in the sensuous company of men.  Enlightenment
arrives in the form of a Canadian guest, Robbie Ross
(Michael Sheen), who intuits the writer's bent and exposes
himself while Constance is bedding her two sons.</P>
<P>   As though to demonstrate the theory that it's not what you
do that matters to anyone, it's what you appear to others to
be doing, Wilde's alleged activities in male dens of iniquity
cause society to buzz while at the same time the well-heeled
of London flock to his plays, enjoying the manner by which
the author satirizes the hypocritical customs of the upper
class.  It becomes apparent that the so-called rent boys with
whom he fraternizes can safely ignore the country's laws
against homosexuality since they are young and cast a low
profile outside their usual haunts.  Wilde's fall from grace
begins when he is introduced to the dashingly handsome but
petulant and promiscuous Alfred Douglas, aka Bosie (Jude
Law), who hates his homophobic father and thereby insists on
flaunting his relationship with the author.  When Bose's dad,
the miserable Marquess of Queensberry (Tom Wilkinson),
discovers the liaison, he threatens to cut his son off from the
estate and poison-pens the writer, accusing him of being a
sodomite.  Wilde goes ballistic, unsuccessfully sues the
cantankerous and much-feared patrician, and is himself
charged with criminal violation of England's anti-
homosexuality laws.  Jailed at hard labor for two years by a
judge who treats the poor man as though he were a serial
killer, Wilde suffers a physical decline, his creativity all but
destroyed.</P>
<P>   Though director Brian Gilbert's name has hardly been a
household word, his "Wilde" is conclusively the best of the
three accounts of the author's life to date.  Ken Hughes's
"The Trial of Oscar Wilds" (1960) was a triumph for Peter
Finch in the title role and "Oscar Wilde," released at the same
time by Gregory Ratoff, displayed an ideally cast Robert
Morley as the hapless essayist.  This production, however, is
particularly blessed by featuring a man who resembles the
writer most closely and moves the audience all the more
because it focuses on Wilde's continued love for his enduring
wife and for the children he was ultimately forbidden to see. 
Nothing in the version thirty-eight years ago boasts the gloss
of the opening, unconventional scene in the American West,
nor can the previous versions strut absolutely stellar
supporting roles such as those of "Pride and Prejudice"'s
Jennifer Ehle as wife Constance, blond god Jude Law as the
love of Oscar's life, and Tom Wilkinson as the disagreeable
marquess.  As a result, Wilde's wit comes across most
sharply, and we are motivated to read works featuring such
bon mots as: "The only way to get rid of a temptation is to
yield to it," "Work is the curse of the drinking class," and the
especially pertinent one, "A man cannot be too careful in the
choice of his enemies."  Not Rated.  Running time: 115
minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
