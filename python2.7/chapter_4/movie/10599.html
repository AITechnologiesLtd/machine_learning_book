<PRE>Fallen
 Directed by
 Gregory Hoblit </PRE>
<P> `Fallen' is what's known as a supernatural thriller. That means that the bad
 guy is a ghost or a demon or something weird like that. The question is in
 these things, who do you want to win? The insufferable good guy who is morally
 pure or the demon/ghost/devil?</P>
<P> The i.g.g is John Hobbes(Denzel Washington), a heroic cop, who when we meet
 him, is at a state prison to witness the execution of Edgar Reese(Elias
 Koteas), a serial killer[serial killers are tres chic, you know] who's been
 taunting  Hobbs for years.</P>
<P> We soon learn that  Hobbs lives with his extraordinarily wimpy brother Art
 (Gabriel Casseus) and Art's son Sam (Michael J. Pagan) and that because of
 this his girlfriend had moved out. Guess who's going to get it...</P>
<P> But this is a supernatural thriller and Reese isn't just Reese. He's also
 Azazel, Satan's left hand man, who can possess innocent people and other
 mammals and can move from one to the other by touching them. A nifty gimmick
 that while giving a lot of actors work, begins to grate on one after a while. </P>
<P> This version of `the wave' isn't  quite as fun as those at baseball games
 because, unfortunately, most of the film is a sophomoric rehash of every other
 supernatural thriller made over the past twenty years.</P>
<P> Most of the cast is okay. John Goodman, Donald Sutherland and James Gandolfini
 are good as Hobbs' fellow clueless colleagues, Embeth Davidtz overacts as the
 theologian daughter of a cop Azazel has played around with thirty years before
 and who gives some vital clues, and Robert Joy has a good time as Azazel's new
 temporary digs.</P>
<P> But the film takes itself too seriously, and the use of narration and the
 ending are both cheats.</P>
<PRE> Definitely video fodder...</PRE>
