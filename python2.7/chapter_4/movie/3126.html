<PRE>                        Montreal Film Festival
                            (part 1 of 2)
             Film reviews and commentary by Mark R. Leeper
                     Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>     I had never been to a film festival before and I was curious what
made them click.  Is it just a lot of films being shown various
places?  Are there any central activities?  How does it work?</P>
<P>     Well, first some large numbers.  People who attend the full
festival get their choice of 250 films to see.  There are roughly
300,000 attendees.  Four movie theaters participate but because two are
large multiplexes there are as many as eleven different films showing
at the same time and perhaps a twelfth if you include the free
screenings of films in the park.  Filmmakers from all over the world
provide films and on one screen you may have a real mixed bag of films
showing in one day.  A typical theater will show in one day:
     DINNER'S ON THE TABLE (Canadian)
     LES AMOUREUX (French)
     BANDIT QUEEN (Indian)
     FAUT PAS RIRE DU BONHEUR (French)
     I LOVE YOU ROSA (Turkish)
     NOT ANGELS BUT ANGELS (Czech)
     SHE LIVES TO RIDE (US made-for-TV)</P>
<P>     Uh, monolinguals like myself have to be a little careful.  I
wanted to see a film about Joan of Arc and then Evelyn noticed it was
just in French.  Of course they seem geared to boorish US visitors:
their description of the film explained who Joan of Arc was.  (It turns
out education seems to be failing Canadians just like it is failing US
people.  If anything, you see more people listing prices like .99 cents
here than you see in the US.</P>
<P>     There are two handbooks of the festival.  There is a free handout
with schedules at the various theaters and an index so that you can
find when a given film is playing.  It also has a page or two of
descriptions of the film, but not nearly enough.  For C$16 you get a
catalog of films 3/4-inch thick and heavier than you might want to
carry around.  It has a page on each of the feature films.  The printed
materials are poorly designed.  If you look through the catalog and a
film looks interesting, but you are not sure it will be in English you
have to go to the handout and look up in the index to see when the film
is playing.  But that is only a time and date.  You then have eleven
different listings to search to find which theater is showing the film
you want.  (Evelyn points out that there the index does tell you in an
encoded form which theater has the film, but I am just slowly catching
on.)  Then you look at that listing to find the language.  Some are
English, some are French with English subtitles.  You might have picked
a film that is in Dutch with French subtitles.  It is not quite that
bad because you can look at the title of the film and usually can guess
what language the film will be in and usually the non-English films
will have English subtitles.  But the listings could be a lot more
convenient to use.</P>
<P>     Oh, and you are currently reading not just the best description of
the rules of how the fest works--well, that goes without saying--you
are reading the only one.  We have not found in French or in English
any explanation of how things work at the festival.  We missed the
first night's film because we did not know about exchanging tickets in
advance, but that is getting a bit ahead of myself.</P>
<P>     Tickets for the showings (other than three or four free films
shown out of doors--mostly concert films like the director's cut of
WOODSTOCK) are inexpensive compared to evening tickets at home.  They
are C$6.50 individually or C$45 for a book of ten.  (In US currency
$5.08 and $35.16 respectively.)  You basically have to pick up tickets
in advance or risk the film selling out.  Evelyn assumed that only if
you pay the C$6.50 you can reserve a place at the film.  That made all
the difference.  She thought that if they "sold out" all their seats
with individual tickets, nobody could get in using tickets from the
ticket books.  By this misunderstanding that is what happened Thursday
night, the first night of the festival.  They had two featured films,
KABLOONAK and NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  We did not know we could get
advanced tickets with the book so both were sold out.  Instead we went
to another film, one not showing as part of the festival, but playing
at a non-participating theater to the same audience.  It is:</P>
<PRE>     ARCHITECTURE OF DOOM</PRE>
<P>     This is a 1992 Swedish documentary (in German--perhaps for German
television?) by Peter Cohen examining Hitler's philosophy and National
Socialism as an aesthetic movement and an attempt to impose by force a
single aesthetic sensibility on the world.  It was a fanatical effort
by any Procrustian means necessary to make the world fit his personal
idea of what is beauty.  Hitler's aesthetic was, it is suggested, built
on three pillars: the town where he was born, Wagner, and Classical
art.</P>
<P>     Cohen sees the entire political career of Hitler from this point
of view.  Hitler was a failed painter and architect who saw the
collapse of the world coming led by degenerate art and tolerance of
what he personally considered ugly.  His inspiration was Rienzi, a
knight in a Wagnerian opera who wanted to return to the grandeur of
Mediterranean Classical cultures but was betrayed.  According to Hitler
the Classical age was entirely beautiful, but that the protection and
preservation of so-called "genetic defectives" like the mentally and
physically handicapped as well as Jews was a threat to what he saw as
an ever-diminishing proportion of the population who were people of
pure and untainted blood.  He considered himself "a political Robert
Koch" ferreting out the impure genetic microbes in society and
restoring society to health.  He brought 45% of German physicians into
the Nazi party and then had them institute programs of what he called
"euthanasia" to murder those who had impure blood.</P>
<P>     Cohen's Hitler did not want art that pointed to social ills in his
new world.  The only acceptable art would portray man as noble and
living in harmony with an idealized nature.  He himself designed the
uniforms, insignia, and standards of his followers.  Part of his plan
was to make over Berlin as a fantastic futuristic city based on
Classical artistic principles decorated with huge statues, thirty feet
tall or higher.  Part of the design was that even the ruins should
outdo Roman and Greek ruins in magnificence.  Cohen shows us all this
with remarkable new documentary footage and places more familiar
footage in a new context.</P>
<P>     At first it seems a trivialization of Nazism to consider it an
aesthetic movement--an attempt to beautify the world.  It also at first
glance seems to be literally adding insult to injury for Hitler's
victims.  This certainly is not the point of view of the of
ARCHITECTURE OF DOOM and Cohen's interpretation only serves to make
Hitler seem more perverted.  He fashions himself a heroic exterminator
of pests without giving any thought to the equalizing of humans to
lice, rats, and insects in his attempts to get to his idealized vision
of a squeaky clean world.  This film serves as an admonition to those
who would regulate art forms like rock and rap the extremes to which it
is possible to go and how destructive the results can be when carried
to fascist extremes.  I am not accusing those who would limit and
censor lyrics of going to the extremes of a Hitler, but there may be
similarities in the impulses and the film is a warning against trying
too hard to re-form the world to fit some idealized view of how things
should be.</P>
<P>     This film is a major reinterpretation of history, but it is not
clear that any really useful conclusions can be drawn from it.  Does it
make a difference whether people are murdered from a motive of hatred
or aesthetics?  In fact, might it not even be the same thing?  While
the value of ARCHITECTURE OF DOOM's conclusions might be questioned, it
is a totally engrossing documentary which has a lot of very striking
archival footage.  I rate it a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     At this writing it is the second day of the festival.   Montreal
is a city that has, if anything, more panhandlers than Manhattan.  They
are a much narrower ethnic mix, but Rue Ste. Catherine seems to draw
them.  Ste. Catherine is the center of the festival.  All the theaters
are on Ste. Catherine or are a short distance off of it on a side
street.</P>
<P>     Waiting in line for our second film we talked to a gentleman from
the Bronx who told us what was wrong with the festival.  We told him
what films had looked interesting and he told us what bad taste in
films we had.  Ah, New Yorkers!  Well, he has to get in line if he
wants to insult my taste.  Come to think of it, he did.</P>
<P>     On our way in we got had news and good news.  The bad news was
that they did not just take coupons from the book for entrance, we had
to go back and pick up tickets for the specific film.  The good news
was that Evelyn was wrong and we could get advance tickets with our
book coupons.  We had erroneously bestowed upon ourselves the status of
second-class citizens because we had bought tickets in bulk.  Well, no
problem.  We probably saw a better film--although a really bad print--
as a result.</P>
<PRE>     Our second film is an ironic juxtaposition with ARCHITECTURE OF
DOOM.</PRE>
<P>     THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT</P>
<P>     This is a film that has gotten a lot of favorable critical comment
and that is in large part because it is a nice pleasant enjoyable film
that takes no chances beyond those obvious in the premise.  The story
is of three drag queens making a journey across the Australian desert
from Sydney to Alice Springs to make a performance engagement.  Knowing
that, about two-thirds of the script more or less writes itself on
auto-pilot.  Of course they run into bigots along the way and have a
violent scene with them.  Of course their gaudy show clothing looks
really strange on the backdrop of the desert.  Of course there are
conflicts among the three and some deep realizations along the way.  Of
course aborigines, children, and other people pure of heart accept them
without a second thought and it is mostly their parents and boozy men
in bars who have problems accepting them.  Of course every love song
will have a second interpretation when sung by this crowd.  (It is not
unlike the game of adding the phrase "in bed" to fortune cookie
fortunes.) This film is about as daring as wearing white socks with
black shoes and is certainly in no worse taste.  That aside, many of
the cliches it uses are cliches because they are entertaining and this
film that wants so much to be shocking is nothing more than light,
pleasant entertainment.</P>
<P>     Felicia, Mitzi, and Bernadette, born respectively Adam, Anthony,
and Ralph, played respectively by Guy Pearce, Hugo Weaving, and Terence
Stamp, dress in gaudy women's show clothing and mouth the lyrics of
popular songs.  Hey, it's a living.  The first two are drag queens
while Bernadette is a transsexual.  They have to get to Alice Springs
for an engagement so Felicia buys an old tour bus and christens it
"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert."  Tensions are constantly present as
they try to outdo each other in being catty to each other.  But the
first real strain on their relationship comes when Mitzi admits to
having a wife in Alice Springs.  Not too unpredictably the bus breaks
down and getting going again is a minor adventure in itself.</P>
<P>     Director Stephen Elliott has very little insightful to tell us
about drag queens.  I would like to assume that these people are
somewhat deeper than this film's slightly insulting behavior.  One, for
example, has as her great ambition to climb to the top of King's Canyon
in drag.  Elliott can tell his audience that this is an innocent enough
ambition but isn't he being insulting by making his character so
superficial?  Much has been made of the departure this film is for
Terence Stamp.  Until now he has played mostly straight-laced anal-
retentives.  Bernadette is not straight-laced but if anything she is
even more anal-retentive than Stamp's usual characters.</P>
<P>     This film is really little more daring than having Whoopi Goldberg
dress as a nun.  Unless you reject the well-labeled premise from the
start, you will probably find this a surprisingly wholesome feel-good
sort of film, a little strong on manipulation and weak on credibility
in spots, but rarely failing to entertain.  I found it to be about a +1
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     After the film we queued up to get the tickets for upcoming
showings.  We got near the door to enter the theater when an employee
of the theater came to fold the line with posts and velvet ropes.  One
placed a post to my left about two feet from the door and attached a
rope to it going back and another hooked to the doors to its left.
"That's not right," I thought.  The line shouldn't have a bend here.
This is where the line should end.  A second employee came out, saw the
same thing we did and tried to explain to the first why what he was
doing would not work.  The first employee went off to take down the
first rope.  The wiser rolled his eyes in an expression that
transcended the language barrier.  Eventually we got in and got tickets
for everything else we wanted to see.  Though it did not at first
appear so, Luck of Leeper was positive for once.  The weather could be
nicer, I suppose.  But ARCHITECTURE OF DOOM seemed to have
reverberations in PRISCILLA and also in our next film.</P>
<PRE>     JACK L. WARNER, THE LAST MOGUL</PRE>
<P>     There are many accusation made these days about the Jewish people.
It is claimed that they controlled the State Department... totally
untrue.  It is claimed they control banking and finance... also an
invention.  It is claimed they control the film industry.  Well, that
one really was true at one time.  They didn't just control it, they
WERE the film industry.  Jews invented it, often risking all they had
on it.  The major studios were all founded by Jews before there was a
film industry.  But unique among the major studios was Warner Brothers.
It was actually owned by a family.  They made running a studio a family
business.</P>
<P>     JACK L. WARNER is a television documentary made for one of the
Turner stations, written and directed by Gregory Orr, the son of a
step-daughter of Warner.  It covers much the same territory as the book
HOLLYWOOD BE THY NAME by Cass Sperling, another grandchild of Warner.
Orr's documentary style is workman-like, but the film benefits from
particularly interesting subject matter.  Warner's career spans the
film industry from the time of Edison's Kinetiscopes up through the
film 1776.</P>
<P>     The brothers were four of the five sons of a Polish shoemaker who
came to America fleeing the oppression of Cossacks.  The fledgling
cinema industry was the last of several businesses the boys tried,
first projecting, then exhibiting, then distributing, and finally
making films.  They might have remained just a minor studio that would
have quickly died but for their gamble on sound which made them into a
major studio.  The documentary covers their carving out a niche of
films appealing to the common people without the high gloss of an MGM.
Crime and gangster films were their mainstay.</P>
<P>     But while Jack was trying to appeal to the common viewer, his
second wife was building his house into a palace and price was no
object.  Orr says the studio made the first anti-Nazi feature film,
CONFESSIONS OF A NAZI SPY.  At the request of FDR they also made the
pro-Russian MISSION TO MOSCOW.  It was a favor they would come to
regret.  The film covers the war period, the decline in the post-war
era, Jack's cooperation with HUAC, and the power struggles at the
studio with their roots in the earliest family days.</P>
<P>     The documentary gets off to a slow start with Orr telling his
childhood reminiscences of the Warner mansion and showing an amateur
film he made as a boy.  That is the worst touch of the film and it is
over quickly enough.  But Orr continues to put himself too much into
the film.  There is also a disorienting effect from Orr taking events
in semi-chronological order, but straying once in a while.  We hear
CASABLANCA discussed before we are told about the studio's response to
the US getting involved in the war.</P>
<P>     Orr uses interviews of people famous and not so famous who knew
Jack Warner.  But the greatest insights come from Neal Gabler who seems
to put Warner into a context better than Orr can.  Also, of course,
there is a wealth of documentary footage, old home movies, and of
course clips from the films made.</P>
<P>     Gabler's insights include observations that the United States
seems to have gotten its image of itself from movies created by
outsiders, recent immigrants mostly.  Warner in particular made film
about characters a lot like himself: short, feisty underdogs, often
recently emigrated from Europe.  That description fits Cagney,
Robinson, Raft, and Muni.  Gabler cites the conflicts between Harry
Warner with his Old World ways and Jack Warner who was more a product
of the Americas.  This conflict is reflected in the rabbi and his son
in THE JAZZ SINGER.</P>
<P>     JACK L. WARNER, THE LAST MOGUL is nothing great, but how wrong can
it go in covering so much of the history of the American film industry
through one of its most pivotal figures?  It gets a tremendous boost
from the cinematic interest value.  My rating would be a low +1 on the
-4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     Montreal is a very good restaurant town.  There is a really good
ethnic mix of restaurants.  Dinners out so far have been "Smoked meat
Pizzaghetti."  For a Yankee like myself that name had the greatest
number of mysteries to unravel.  That turns out to be more segregated
than the title implies.  "Pizzaghetti" is just a small pizza with a
side of spaghetti.  For local food, a great favorite seems to be the
mysteriously named "smoked meat."  I am not used to ordering anything
with a name so vague.  (Even "hot dog" is specific if not accurate.)
Smoked meat turns out to be what we would call "corned beef."  At least
I hope so.  I think there was a horror film once called MOTEL HELL in
which food was similarly just called "meat" without being more
specific.  The meat turned out to be what the pirates used to call
"long pork" or "long John."  How many readers of TREASURE ISLAND
recognize the delicious irony of having a ship's cook named Long John
Silver?  But that is one heck of a digression.  Our second night was
had Arab fast food and our third night we had a nice meal of Hungarian
food.</P>
<P>     Our third day we again got to the theater early.  This time we met
while waiting a very kindred spirit.  He is into exotic cuisine,
philosophy, know mathematics, and of course he likes cinema.  Herb
Louis was his name (or perhaps Lewis) and he is the former head of a
philosophy department at a Canadian university.  He made some
restaurant recommendations that we will probably use.  I made a
reference to Evariste Galois and he knew a fair amount about him.</P>
<PRE>     MISS AMERIGUA</PRE>
<P>     The town is Amerigua, perhaps in Paraguay.  Maybe eighteen years
ago when it was little more than a few dirt farms, Colonel Banderas
murdered a discontented activist farmer in front of the eyes of the
farmer's family under the pretext that the farmer was a Communist.
Everisto, the farmer's young son, responded by attacking the Colonel,
then fleeing the country.  There have been many changes since then.
Now the country, while every bit as corrupt, pays lip service to the
ideals of democracy.  Still, the entire village lives in the shadow of
Colonel Banderas, now an important national figure.  Rather than justa
few farms Amerigua looks like a town.  It has a town hall; it has a
radio station.</P>
<P>     This is a big day in Amerigua.  There will be a big beauty pageant
in the evening where the village will choose the most beautiful woman
in the village.  Colonel Banderas has decided in the name of democracy
that just the right woman should win and will tell the judges whom they
must choose, once he finally makes up his mind if it should be his
daughter, his son's fiance, or his mistress.  Important people will be
coming to Amerigua, some on the morning train, and a Japanese diplomat
will be coming to town to be one of the judges.  The concert will be
sponsored by several international companies who trade in this country.</P>
<P>     But for a short prologue, the entire film takes place in one day
as we get to meet the village.  First we meet Innocencio, a nerdish
young radio reporter never seen without huge large earphones and a huge
microphone.  We see the preparations for the big day, and petty
political squabbles over what should be the color of the welcoming
carpet.  The various contestants waking up for the big day.  Front-
runner for the competition is Maria (who looks very much like Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio) engaged to the Colonel's son and due to be
married the same day as she vies for the title of Miss Amerigua.
Carmen, the Colonel's daughter is willful and spoiled.  Rosa,
Everisto's sister who does not get along with her mother, is now the
Colonel's mistress willing to do all she needs to in order to get out
of Amerigua.  Then there is Reencarnacion, the gay hairdresser with a
penchant for Tarot and the supernatural.</P>
<P>     There is something about a beauty pageant that reveals greed,
hypocrisy, superficiality, and vanity.  Something about women vying to
be chosen as the most beautiful just seems a natural target for satire.
Much of this film is reminiscent of Michael Ritchie's underrated SMILE.
But this film mixes into the cocktail heavy doses of politics and even
some fantasy.  This film is written in the style of magical realism in
which minor fantasy elements get mixed into the plot.  Minor touches
include a harp that refuses to be played and a bust that makes comments
on what it sees.</P>
<P>     Luis Vera's MISS AMERIGUA is a good satiric comedy, at times quite
funny, that deserves release in the US.  It needs a better job of
English subtitling, but with that it could do very nicely on the art
house circuit in the US.  I would rate it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     The Desjardins Center is a shopping mall that also is a sort of
center of the film festival's activities.  An open area in the center
is given over to displays of film posters of films in the festival,
film art, and press conferences.  The film art look as lot like the
media art one sees in the art shows of science fiction conventions.  We
saw a conference with Michael Austin and Mark Abraham talking about
their film PRINCESS CARABOO.  The area was really full, but that was
because the second press conference scheduled was some American
comedian and actor named Steve Martin.  Uh, lest you be confused I
hasten to point out that is the actor's name and it has nothing to do
with the character Steve Martin, who was played by Raymond Burr in the
film classic GODZILLA, KING OF THE MONSTERS.  Apparently this comedian
picked the same name for recognition value.  The story for PRINCESS
CARABOO is apparently true, though some of the press questioned if
things could have happened like shown in the early 19th century.</P>
<P>     The next film is one that I do not expect to be of quite so higha
quality as the ones I have seen to this point.  I have a special
interest in fantasy films so I am curious to see anything new in that
field.  The catalog said a some intriguing things about TOM THUMB, but
how good can it be on that subject?</P>
<PRE>     THE SECRET ADVENTURES OF TOM THUMB</PRE>
<P>     The film BRAINSTORM had as one of the details of its plot that
there existed a tape such that if the person merely saw the tape it
could result in permanent psychosis.  Until I saw THE SECRET ADVENTURES
OF TOM THUMB I doubted that such a thing could exist.  This is a very
grim and dark fairy tale reminiscent of ERASERHEAD done with the
animation of NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  The film is mostly done in
model animation with some pixilated live-action and though the film is
only 61 minutes, it has the feel of a nightmare that goes on a lot
longer.</P>
<P>     The story takes place in a grimy fly-ridden future.  A mistake in
an artificial insemination factory leaves fly organs in a bottle of
sperm.  The result is that a laborer and his wife give birth to child
only six inches high.  They name him Tom.  Their joy is only short-
lived as two faceless Kafka-esque government agents break into the
laborers' flat and steal the child, taking him to a scientific lab
where sadistic experiments are performed on him.  Tom escapes down a
waste drain with the help of some bizarre skeleton creature he
befriends at the lab.  In the outside world he finds a race of small
people almost his scale.  They wage constant war against the humans--or
"giants" as they call them--who, oblivious to their existence, come
tramping through their neighborhoods causing terrible destruction.</P>
<P>     This film is mostly the creation of Dave Borthwick who directed,
wrote, and edited the film.  Together with Frank Passingham he also
animated the film and did the photography with animation techniques
very reminiscent of Czech films.  Here he creates a bleak and grimy
world of huge fascistic government agencies, troglodyte wage-slave
laborer citizens, and a secret society of tiny people.  His little
people live in constant terror of the oblivious humans.  In short, this
is a very good job of creating a very good film that is darn
discomforting to watch and that can be recommended to only a razor-
narrow audience.  THE SECRET ADVENTURES was my kind of film and I could
only barely stand the images I was seeing.  See this one if you dare
but don't bring your mother or your kids.  While I say that, I cannot
imagine where this film will find a distribution even in video stores.
It is too short to play as a feature film, too downbeat to show to
children, and too animated to get an adult audience.  This is a
challenging film but not totally without its rewards.  I rate it a high
+1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     To fill out the time with a somewhat lighter film from the same
producers, Richard Hutchinson and his Bolexbrothers Ltd. have included
the nine-minute piece, "The Biz," which uses live-action people with
animated masks covering their faces.  This animated film is about a
cocktail party to honor Ed, whose new film was just screened to rave
reviews.  We see that various people who talk to Ed at the party.  The
masks help to show us what Ed is thinking and help to characterize the
other guests.  It also seems made for the BBC and would be a good film
to have included in one of Expanded Entertainment's International
Tournees of Animation.</P>
<P>     That was better than I expected it to be.  I suppose the fact that
the films are pre-screened and have to be selected will mean that it is
more likely that the films will be good.  Certainly I am averaging
higher ratings for films that I see here than I would for films I see
at home.  I have yet to see a film I have not liked.  Of course I have
to break that streak tonight since I will be going to a film I gave up
on after fifteen minutes the last time I tried it.  I will be going to
the free showing of WOODSTOCK.  Concert films are definitely not my
thing.  Certainly rock concerts film are not.  But before that I will
be seeing one of the most highly-recommended films showing here this
year.</P>
<PRE>     WHAT HAPPENED WAS...</PRE>
<P>     This is a film that already has rally stripes.  Tom Noonan wrote,
directed and starred in this film which he made for only $300,000 and
took only eleven days to shoot it.  They finished editing the film just
hours short of the deadline for entering it in the Sundance Film
Festival.  But the effort to get the film done in time was repaid.  At
Sundance it won the Waldo Salt screenwriting award and Grand Jury
prize.  Samuel Goldwyn snapped it up for an immediate profit.  Noonan's
face may be familiar to filmgoers for other films in which he has
acted.  He has played psychopathic killers in films like MANHUNTER (the
earlier of the two "Hannibal Lector films") and THE LAST ACTION HERO.
It is good to see him in a more normal role.</P>
<P>     WHAT HAPPENED WAS... is basically a one-act play for two people
produced as a film.  But for a few scenes at the beginning, the film is
all one scene taking place as it happens in front of the camera.  This,
however, is not to imply the film was made in a single take but it does
give the film a certain immediacy.  A woman has invited a co-worker to
her Manhattan apartment for dinner.  Both work in a legal office,
Jackie as a secretary, Michael as a paralegal.  She has been impressed
by his sense of humor and is intrigued by his apparent working on some
secret project of his own.  She has invited him to a candlelight dinner
at her apartment.  The evening begins very awkwardly.  Each has a
talent for choosing just the wrong thing to say to the other.  The date
appears not to be working out at all.  But on and off the wine seems to
be loosening each other up.  They begin trading confidences and
dropping defenses.  Eventually each will know more about the other than
either of them really want.</P>
<P>     Tom Noonan's Michael is controlled and systematic.  Karen Sillas's
Jackie lives with emotional tides that Michael has been able to
suppress in himself.  He is mechanical and she is disturbed.  Noonan's
script gives hints as to how each has gotten that way, but in the end
much is left to conjecture.  Both performances have impressive
authenticity.  My one complaint would be that film is not really the
proper medium for this script.  More appropriate would be the live
stage.  Noonan's direction intentionally makes little use of the
advantages that cinema has over the live stage while it certainly could
benefit from the additional intensity and immediacy that live
performances would have given it.  Making the film more cinematic would
probably have further sacrificed the immediacy.  Noonan at least does
not repeat Hitchcock's error in ROPE of trying to create immediacy by
simulating a single take.  In ROPE Hitchcock apparently realized the
technique became a distraction and he did not repeat his error in DIAL
M FOR MURDER.  Occasionally Noonan misjudges the pacing of his
material, but his direction was usually on-target.</P>
<P>     In spite of the critical acclaim this film is getting, it is not
nearly as original as the rumor mill would have it.  It was reminiscent
of other dramatic works and very similar to a play produced on PBS in
the 60s called, if memory serves, "Birdbath."  While falling short of
my expectations for the film, I would still give it a respectable high
+1 on the -4 to +4 scale.  You won't see much else like it in the
theaters soon.</P>
<P>     This is where a lot of people are going to discover they do not
agree with my taste, if they haven't already.</P>
<P>     Worm's-eye-view editorial: Traditional musical instruments do not
put out a sound that can be heard very great distances.  This is why
electrical amplification was invented.  It was intended to reflect with
fidelity the sound that the musical instruments were making.  They did
that within their designed range of amplification.  Go outside that
range and the sound would be distorted.  Often what you would get would
be a loud howl much like the howls of a person in pain.  Music is
supposed to evoke an emotional response in the listener.  But not every
sound that evokes an emotional response is music.  These howls which
had a definite pitch and which did evoke emotional responses--like
music did--came to be considered music.  Many musicians used electronic
distortion as an integral part of their music.  What helped immensely
with the acceptance of this sort of noise as music is that it often
carried with it a political message that was popular, even if less than
eloquent or more rhetorical than well-reasoned.  This is not to say the
message was wrong, but these were not very good arguments for their
point of view.  Jimi Hendrix did a version of the "Star-Spangled
Banner" at Woodstock that was made up entirely of electronic howls.  At
a time when America was probably making serious ethical mistakes
Hendricks was saying less-than-eloquently, "America bad!"  Atrocious
noise from someone who agrees with your politics does not constitute
music.</P>
<P>     Following WHAT HAPPENED WAS... we went to see what remained of the
director's cut of WOODSTOCK.  This was an outdoor showing and the area
was packed.  We sat on a hill to the side and watched.  We heard
basically something with a beat and a lot of audio distortion.  Joan
Baez then sang about Joe Hill.  I am not all that fond of her music,
but it does have melody.  However I did tell Evelyn that she should
decide if we stay or walk out, and the next performer was another
distortion artist whose beat we could feel on our backs as we went in
the opposite direction.</P>
