<PRE>LITTLE NICKY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Steven Brill's LITTLE NICKY, starring box office champ Adam Sandler as 
Little Nicky, is a surprise in more ways than one.  Starting off 
abysmally bad, it manages to atone for its early sins and turn into a 
very funny comedy.  The credit for the success of its humor falls on a 
superlative supporting cast and a director who manages to coax the most 
out of each of them.  The special effects and the humorous sets add 
immensely to the revelry.  One wickedly funny scene features hundreds of 
charging spiders with Adam Sandler faces, à la THE FLY.</P>
<P>The negative surprise is that, with raunchy humor like a cross between 
AUSTIN POWERS and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR, LITTLE NICKY is a PG-13 comedy 
that would have been more appropriately rated R -- more on some of the 
reasons why later.</P>
<P>The story has Little Nicky's Dad (Harvey Keitel), a.k.a. the Devil, 
literally falling apart after his two other sons, Adrian (Rhys Ifans, 
NOTTING HILL) and CASSIUS (Tommy Lister) escape to Earth.  Unless Nicky 
can bring them both back home to Hades, Dad will slowly disintegrate 
like the Cheshire cat, leaving only his frown behind.  Rodney 
Dangerfield, in one of many hilarious cameos, plays Lucifer, Dad's dad.  
(Quentin Tarantino, in another of the film's wild and wacky cameos, 
plays a blind preacher.)</P>
<P>Sandler plays his usual stupid character, only stupider this time.  A 
bulldog named Beefy serves as his guide in New York City where Nicky's 
brothers have gone to wreak chaos worthy of Batman's villains.  With 
lovable crudeness, the spike-collared dog tells it like it is.  Beefy's 
girlfriend is a sewer rat.</P>
<P>As Nicky's groupies, two stoner dudes and devil worshipers, Peter (Peter 
Dante) and John (Jonathan Loughran), follow him wherever he goes.  
Patricia Arquette, as Nicky's sweetness-and-light girlfriend, provides 
the perfect complement to a story brimming with wickedness.</P>
<P>Although a cogent case could be made for Beefy's being the best part of 
the movie, my vote would go to Reese Witherspoon (ELECTION and 
PLEASANTVILLE), who plays an angel named Holly.  After setting most of 
the film in either hell or New York City -- yes, you can tell the 
difference -- the story switches briefly to visit a heaven that looks 
like a parody of the Robin Williams film, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME.  Holly 
is the reigning teen princess in the land of the eternally juvenile.  
Witherspoon, an extremely intelligent actress who usually plays control 
freaks, is a ditzy Valley girl type this time.  She plays wonderfully 
against type, and her every word and gesture had me in stitches.</P>
<P>The level of sexual humor and language should have gotten the film an R 
rating.  The movie opens with a peeping tom (Jon Lovitz) in a tree, 
spying on a woman getting undressed in her bedroom.  This causes him to 
go straight to hell, literally.  Other stronger bits of crude humor 
include a transvestite (Clint Howard) getting his kicks from hot wax on 
his nipples, Hitler (Christopher Carroll) in a frilly dress being 
tortured by having pineapples shoved up his rear and Hell's Gatekeeper 
(Kevin Nealon) being punished by having breasts grow out of his head.</P>
<P>>From the angels we get the inside scoop on God's brain power.  "God is 
so smart!" says one angel.  "Like Jeopardy smart!" adds another.  And 
LITTLE NICKY, for all of its coarseness, is a surprisingly smart comedy.  
It's the first Adam Sandler film that I've ever recommended.  (I could 
almost recommend THE WEDDING SINGER.)  But, as I said, it is the 
ensemble cast, not Sandler himself, that makes LITTLE NICKY sizzle.</P>
<P>LITTLE NICKY runs 1:28.  It is officially rated PG-13 for crude sexual 
humor, some drug content, language and thematic material, but, as I 
said, I think an R would have been more appropriate.  Depending on the 
kid, the movie would be acceptable for kids around 12 or 13, and up but 
take in account my previously mentioned examples.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, thought the movie was pretty good and gave it ** 
1/2.  His favorite character was the bulldog.  His friend John, age 12, 
thought the film was a really good comedy and gave it *** 1/2.  His 
favorite character was Dad's dad.  John's twin, Steven, thought it was 
really funny and gave it ***.  His favorite characters were the stoner 
dudes.  All of the boys commented that the film should have been rated R.</P>
