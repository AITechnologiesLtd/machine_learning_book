<P>HOME ALONE 3
(Twentieth-Century Fox)
Directed by Raja Gosnell
 Less a sequel than a haphazard remake of the original "Home Alone," "Home
Alone 3" is a shining example of desperate studio executives trying to
squeeze a few more drops out of a dying cash-cow. It's also further
proof --as if any were needed-- that John Hughes-scripted movies are now a
thing to be feared instead of anticipated, as they might have been ten years
ago during his "Breakfast Club"/"Planes, Trains and Automobiles"/"Pretty in
Pink" heyday.
 At least the producers had the good sense to retire the ungracefully aging
Macaulay Culkin, whose performances in his most recent films (such as the
acclaimed "Getting Even With Dad" and the unjustly-snubbed-by-Oscar "Richie
Rich") smacked of smug self-indulgence. Unfortunately, the filmmakers have
not found a young actor with the comic timing of the younger, less affected
Culkin: Alex D. Linz, who takes the lead in this installment, seems like one
of those little dolls who's been told far too many times exactly how
adorable he is. There's a fine line between precocious and precious, and
young Mr. Linz continually errs on the side of  cutesy-poo.
 In fact, there's nothing adorable about "Home Alone 3" at all, despite
Hughes' dumping of a load of gooey sentimentality into the midst of the
proceedings, as beguiling moppet Alex (Linz) defrosts the glacial heart of a
bitter old neighbor. The spies-chasing-microchip plot is nothing more than a
facile excuse for a second act that's stuffed to the gills with poorly
executed slapstick that director Raja Gosnell obviously has no feel for. Say
what you will about the first two "Home Alone"s, but at least they were
professionally made entertainments; this one seems to have been shot and
pasted together by the least-promising students in a community-college film
class. Despite the title, the real story that's being continued here is
Hughes', and it's a depressing tale of a once-bright talent stuck in a
continuing downward spiral.</P>
