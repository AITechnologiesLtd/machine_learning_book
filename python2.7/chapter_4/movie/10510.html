<P>It would be easy to dismiss the entertaining, but decidedly lightweight 
action film "Hard Rain" as mere fluff, were it not for the memories of 
last summer's dreadful "Speed 2: Cruise Control." That leaden monstrosity 
served as a primer on how to screw up an action movie. Bloated and dull, 
"Speed 2" was two hours of forced spectacle and frantic movement that 
generated little tension and virtually no fun. Conversely, "Hard Rain" 
takes a simple concept and turns it into an unassuming, efficient action 
film. Sure, you'll probably forget about it an hour or so after you've 
left the theater, but at least you'll have a good time while you're in 
there.</P>
<P>Set in Huntingburg, Indiana, "Hard Rain" is about an armored car heist 
and a whole lot of water. After flood waters force the evacuation of the 
small town, the local sheriff (Randy Quaid) and his deputies patrol by 
boat, searching for any local stragglers and keeping an eye out for 
looters. Meanwhile, an armored car breaks down on the outskirts of town, 
stranding drivers Tom (Christian Slater) and his Uncle Charlie (Ed Asner.
) A radio call for help results in the arrival of Jim (Morgan Freeman) 
and his crew, but their goal isn't assistance. They want the armored 
car's treasure, $3 million in cash. When the "rescue team" opens fire, 
Tom snatches the money and takes off on foot into the ever-deepening 
waters. The chase is on, with everyone pursuing Tom. Shifting allegiances 
and some snazzy action sequences keep the proceedings lively, as the 
flood waters continue rising higher and higher.</P>
<P>Water is notoriously hard to handle, so the creators of "Hard Rain" moved 
the production into a contained environment, building an extremely 
detailed replica of Huntingburg in a massive aircraft hangar in Palmdale, 
California. 50 wooden buildings were set in a tank two football fields 
long and one football field wide. Behind the faux downtown setting, the 
largest backdrop ever made, 72-feet high and 2,000 feet long, completed 
the Huntingburg re-creation. Then the whole set was flooded with five 
feet of water, deep enough for the actors to flail about convincingly, 
but shallow enough to allow them to find their footing when necessary. To 
simulate the rising floodwaters, the filming was divided into several 
stages. At the end of each sequence, all of the structures were lifted 
into the air, allowing crew members to cut away the bottom portions of 
the buildings. When the sets were lowered, the illusion of rising waters 
was complete. Ultimately, flood waters 16 feet deep were simulated for 
the production.</P>
<P>After finishing 75 days of shooting on the Palmdale set, the crew finally 
moved to the real Huntingburg, for a week of outdoor location filming. 
For the first time in Indiana history, a highway was closed to traffic 
for filming, as sandbags were placed at the junction of Interstate 231 
and Main Street, which was then covered with a few inches of water to 
simulate the early stages of the flood. </P>
<P>"Hard Rain" was originally called "The Flood" and was scheduled for 
release last summer, but the film was pulled from the schedule and the 
name changed due to fears it would be mistaken as a disaster movie. In 
press materials, producer Mark Gordon stressed the difference between 
"Hard Rain" and a disaster film. "In those type of stories, the twister, 
flood or volcano serves as the antagonist. In our picture, Morgan Freeman 
is the antagonist, Christian Slater is the protagonist and we play out 
the action against the flood."</P>
<P>The action gets pretty spectacular, highlighted by two particularly nice 
set pieces; a jet ski chase through the flooded halls of a school, and a 
nifty dual speedboat crash through the stained-glass windows of a church. 
The acting isn't bad, either. Christian Slater mercifully avoids his 
chronic Jack Nicholson impersonation, underplaying Tom in straightforward 
heroic fashion. Morgan Freeman is grimly effective as the very focused 
leader of the bad guys, and Randy Quaid puts his snarky qualities to good 
use as the town's morally ambiguous sheriff. Minnie Driver, excellent in 
"Good Will Hunting," has a minor, but pleasing turn as a restoration 
expert who reluctantly gets drawn into the action, and Betty White makes 
an amusing cameo appearance as a feisty local who refuses to vacate her 
home. </P>
<P>Despite the qualifications of the cast, don't look for any deep personal 
insights. Like its storyline, the characters in "Hard Rain" are 
streamlined; archetypal players making fast decisions in a volatile 
situation. "Hard Rain" is simply an action movie, but it has a certain 
elegance because of its lack of bombast or pretension. They're just 
trying to show us a good time here and, bless their little hearts, that's 
exactly what they do.</P>
