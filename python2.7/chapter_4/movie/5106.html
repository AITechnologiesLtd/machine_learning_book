                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1996 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>"Nixon" is the best and worst of Oliver Stone. If it is an
interesting chronicle of America's cardinal political scandal, it
still smacks of a researcher so proud of his work that he can't
bear to leave anything out. It's too damned long.       </P>
<P>>From his White House bunker, Nixon tries to snuff out the
Watergate brush fire by jettisoning his advisors in ascending
order of importance. First, the break-in team:  Hunt, Liddy,
McCord, Martinez, Sturgis; next, White House staffers Erlichman,
Haldeman, and Dean; then friend and attorney-general John
Mitchell. </P>
<P>At the end, he is surrounded by players from the bench: the
inept Ron Ziegler, the ambitious Al Haig, and the infamous Henry
Kissinger, who can barely contain his glee at the possibility of
being the hero who saves the country from a sick man. In the
"Deep Throat" guessing game, it's worth noting that Kissinger is
the one figure who needed two decades of secrecy in order to
continue his career as international power broker.   </P>
<P>The facts of Watergate were proven long ago and confirmed
repeatedly by the testimony of the participants, leaving little
for Oliver Stone to posit or prove. A sitting president committed
at least 39 felonies, orchestrated a cover-up, lied profoundly,
and taped himself in the act. When the Supreme Court ruled 8-0
that the president could not use executive privilege in a
criminal case, the game was over. </P>
<P>Reaching for a purpose for his film, Stone decides to
explore and explain Richard Nixon. He paints his portraits in the
emotional, questionable brush strokes of psychohistory. Did Nixon
really fuel himself with scotch?  Was his Quaker mother so devout
that she defused all human emotion by hiding behind the cloak of
her faith?  Is it fair to hypothesize about the intimacy of the
Nixon bedroom?</P>
<P>Stone tells us that the slights and snubs of childhood
produced the paranoid star of the Watergate tapes. In the final
hour, he hammers his point home by cutting his camera wildly
through Nixon's visions in flailing excess that threatens to
overwhelm the stark truth. This is melodrama where none is
needed.   </P>
<P>Anthony Hopkins, with his head seeming to grow from
somewhere in his chest, catches the awkward stance and tension
that informed Nixon's behavior. He has captured perfectly the
sudden smile that burst from a dark scowl under pressure.
Supported all the way by a strong cast, Hopkins turns in a
performance that is an uncanny suggestion of Nixon's core. </P>
<P>As Nixon's wife, Joan Allen is every bit as enigmatic as the
real Pat Nixon. She conveys beautifully the sense of the
claustrophobic prison that surrounds her. The actress's
compassion for Mrs. Nixon is palpable.</P>
<P>The drama of peeling away the layers of guilt until Nixon
stands exposed needs no embellishment. At the end of his tortured
farewell speech, he stands naked before the nation, fake to the
end, riveting in his transparency. This is one story that did not
need Oliver Stone.  </P>
