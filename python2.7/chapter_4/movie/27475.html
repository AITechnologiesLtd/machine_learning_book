DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>TV director Danny Leiner's DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? tells an oft-told tale 
about a couple of stoner dudes whose IQs match their age.  Trying to 
find something original, first-time writer Philip Stark's script 
includes a transgendered lap dancer, space nerds and sexy 
extraterrestrials.  In more competent hands, the silly plot might have 
been developed into something funny.  PSYCHO BEACH PARTY, from earlier 
this year, had a similarly ridiculous story which turned out much 
better.  Even if DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? would rate a zero on the 
Laugh-o-Meter, at least it is a fairly good-spirited and colorful film 
that produces a few smiles.</P>
<P>A kitchen sink comedy, it throws in every gag that it can think of 
within the bounds of a PG-13 rating.  (Speaking of bounds, the PG-13 
rating apparently permits animals to smoke dope until they are wasted so 
long as the animal is a dog and not a human.)</P>
<P>Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott play Jesse and Chester, a couple 
of guys who got so stoned that they don't remember the previous night 
and where they left their car.  Going in search of the auto, they find 
that the house of their twin girlfriends, Wanda (Jennifer Garner) and 
Wilma (Marla Sokoloff), has been trashed by the party that they can't 
remember.  </P>
<P>It is a shame that they can't recall the previous night since people 
keep running into them to remind them about it.  One is a buxom blonde, 
Christie Boner (Kristy Swanson), who only dates hunks but who apparently 
made an exception for them last night.  She offers a free feel of her 
"ho-hos" to rekindle their memory.</P>
<P>The real excitement begins when five self-described "hot chicks," show 
up to offer Jesse and Chester sexual pleasure in exchange for something 
called the "continuum transfunctioner."  This is a device from outer 
space whose "mystery is only exceeded by its power."  Yes, you guessed, 
these chicks are really aliens who are up to no good.  In addition, some 
space nerds, who make Trekkies look like rocket scientists, want the 
device so that they can travel into space.  The nerds wear "interstellar 
jumpsuits" made of ordinary bubble wrap.  </P>
<P>Although I haven't even touched on other subplots like the one involving 
killer ostriches, you probably know more than enough to get a good sense 
of the movie.  This much can be said in its defense -- it is far from 
the worst movie this year.  It wouldn't even make the bottom 10.  That 
may not exactly be a recommendation, but it is the best that can be 
said.  Well, I guess I can think of one other -- I never considered 
walking out.</P>
<P>DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? runs a quick 1:23.  It is rated PG-13 for language 
and some sex and drug-related humor and would be acceptable for most 
teenagers.</P>
