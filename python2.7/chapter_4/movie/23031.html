<P>         "Guinevere" is a movie that's likely to hit home with a lot of
viewers, even those who haven't personally been involved in either side
of an older man/younger woman relationship. You don't necessarily have
had to walk in the shoes of 21-year-old Harper Sloane to understand why
she took the path she did or why she willingly put up with a lover most
women her age would have steered clear of in the first place.</P>
<P> It all comes down to acceptance. For many people in their teens
and early 20s, that's something that's surprisingly hard to find in
their homes, in their schools, even in their own peer groups. As
adolescents struggle with their changing bodies, attitudes and emotions,
most of them look for some kind of confirmation that they're on the
right track and they're not nearly as awkward or uncouth or stupid as
they often feel.</P>
<P> Sometimes this kind of reassurance comes from an understanding
teacher or an older friend. Or it may come from someone who doesn't
necessarily have the young person's best interests at heart. In Harper's
case, it comes from a man named Connie Fitzpatrick, who is more than
twice her age and who may or may not be a positive force in shaping her
life.</P>
<P> Harper is played by Canada's answer to Jodie Foster, the
radiant Sarah Polley. She first came to prominence as a child star in
movies such as "One Magic Christmas" and director Terry Gilliam's "The
Adventures of Baron Munchausen," and in the 10 years since, she's become
an exceptionally versatile actress who's particularly good at getting a
handle on characters who rise above their circumstances. She was a
schoolgirl who slept with her father's friends to pay the bills in
director Atom Egoyan's "Exotica," a crippled survivor of a near-fatal
accident in "The Sweet Hereafter" and, perhaps to show she can lighten
up a bit when she needs to, she gave a saucy, funny performance as a
savvy grocery store clerk who successfully marketed chewable aspirin as
a designer drug for the rave set in director Doug Liman's terrific
sleeper "Go."</P>
<P> Here, Polley immediately zeroes on Harper's insecurities and
quiet fears and brings them delicately to the surface. Despite her
intelligence and poise, Harper feels utterly out of place among her
wealthy family and does her best to fade into the wallpaper as everyone
she knows gathers to celebrate her sister's wedding. Connie (Stephen
Rea) has been hired to photograph the reception and he and Harper bond
immediately. He sees the unexplored potential in Harper and draws her
into his life. She follows willingly, and he christens her "Guinevere."</P>
<P> Not long afterward, Harper will find out she's the latest in a
substantial string of Guineveres. In some movies -- and in a lot of
romances -- that would be the end of the story, but not here.
Writer-director Audrey Wells realizes these two still have much more to
learn about -- and from -- each other.</P>
<P> Wells previously wrote the wonderful 1996 comedy "The Truth
About Cats and Dogs," in which Janeane Garafolo was cast as a young
woman who hid behind jokes and sarcasm in the hope no one would see her
romantic side. "Guinevere" offers the flip side of that story. Instead
of hiding from love, Harper is starving for a little bit of art and
idealism after having grown up in a house full of cynics. Garafalo's
character in "Cats and Dogs" was ultimately softened up by her first
brush with passion, but we know Harper will experience just the opposite
effect.</P>
<P> Wearing his bohemian air as comfortably as an old sweater, Rea
makes Connie likable, even though we may question his motives and
morals. Harper may be Guinevere, but Connie is not the dashing Lancelot,
nor is he the dream-driven Arthur. He's just a middle-aged man who wants
someone to look up to him, and Harper's mother (Jean Smart) nails him
down perfectly when she tells him the one thing Harper can give that the
50ish Connie can't get from a woman his own age: that sense of youthful
awe.</P>
<P> When Connie and Harper are together, you don't get a sense of
great passion, but rather a feeling you're watching a couple of people
who are getting what they need from each other at this particular
moment. That kind of reciprocity may not be the basis for a timeless
love story, but it's exactly what you'll find in a lot of friendships,
relationships and marriages. As this resonant movie clearly illustrates,
many of us don't find that elusive Camelot, especially not the first
time out. James Sanford</P>
