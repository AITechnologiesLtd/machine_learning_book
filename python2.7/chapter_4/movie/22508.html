WILD AT HEART
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Once I was asked why I don't give highest grades to the
recently released films. The answer is rather simple - too
many times I had been blown away after watching the film for
the first time, only to see more and more flaws with each
subsequent viewing. As a result, many films that I used to
call masterpieces now seem overrated to me. So, in order to
spare myself of critical embarrassments, I tend to be
cautious and give highest grades only to those films that
pass the test of time.</P>
<P>One of such examples is related to the career of David
Lynch, American director who used to be rather obscure
figure in the film world, known only among lovers of "artsy"
cinema. His unexpected success with TWIN PEAKS television
series brought him to the mainstream audience, and being
Lynch fan became fashionable. At the apex of his popularity,
in 1990, he directed WILD AT HEART, strange combination of a
road movie, melodrama and black comedy which would bring him
his first "Palme d'Or". But his stunning success was marred
with very vocal minority that booed his film at the Cannes
Film Festival. Such event foreshadowed the strong division
among the critics when they discuss this film -some hail it
as genuine Lynchian masterpiece, and some call it cheap
exploitation of his mainstream popularity. At first, I was
blown away with this movie and thought of it as one of the
best films of 1990s, truly remarkable event. Later, I began
to see its flaws and now I don't see it as especially
important chapter in the history of cinema.</P>
<P>The plot of the film is based on the novel by Barry Gifford.
Sailor Ripley (played by Nicolas Cage) and Lula Fortune
(played by Laura Dern) are couple whose passionate love to
each other withstands all the challenges, including bizarre
attempt on Sailor's life that ended with Sailor serving two
years for manslaughter. Sailor gets out of prison and Lula
agrees to come with him to California. While two of them
head west, stopping in flea-bag motels in Deep South, Lula's
psychopathic mother Marietta (played by Diane Ladd)
desperately wants to separate them and hires services of
private detective and her part- time lover Johnny Farragut
(played by Harry Dean Stanton). However, her motive is not
just the well being of her daughter; Sailor used to work for
Marcello Santos (played by J.E. Freeman), local crime boss
who also happened to be Marietta's partner, both in business
and bed. While Santos' men join the pursuit in order to
silence Sailor, the couple is faced with more immediate
problem. Sailor and Lula run out of cash and get stranded in
small town in Texas, so Sailor is accept the offer by
menacing-looking criminal Bobby Peru (played by Willem
Dafoe) to take part in one of his capers.</P>
<P>Initial success of WILD HEART could be explained with the
strong impact felt by the first-time viewers. Even those
members of the audience who used to be familiar with Lynch
and his style of filmmaking, including the author of this
review, were caught by surprise when exposed to the very
original way he approached the story and the characters.
Naturally, Lynch used unusual editing techniques, camera
angles, suggestive photography and haunting musical score by
his composer Angelo Badalamenti to create dark and surreal
atmosphere, which actually helped the not so original plot
(doomed lovers on the run). But, the most interesting thing
in WILD AT HEART is barrage of shocks - Lynch bombards us
with unexpected events and character traits, often
challenging the endurance of the more squeamish audience.
For example, the lead character of Sailor in the beginning
of the film is attacked; he reacts with the most savage (and
very graphically depicted) act of violence. Only few scenes
later, he reacts to the similar act with equally irrational
and almost surreal chivalry. Few people like Lynch are ready
to combine so contrasting elements in the same movie, and
even fewer are ready to use them in the same scenes. One
second we are subjected to the sappiness, chivalry and
child-like innocence that belong to fairytales, only to be
brought down to earth with foul language, graphic violence,
explicit sex and, of course, Lynch trademark scenes
featuring various forms of physical and mental deformity.
That barrage of shocks and unexpected twists keeps the
viewers at their seats - they simply must see what is going
to happen next.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, somewhere in the second part of the film,
shock begins to wear off, some of those bizarre twists and
characters begin to look predictable and repetitive, most
notably numerous WIZZARD OF OZ references (except the last
surreal scene). Lynch also loses the sense of rhythm, there
are many scenes that go nowhere or should have been trimmed
a bit. The dialogue is also often weak, at least compared
with BLUE VELVET, Lynch's true masterpiece. Finally, after
two hours, some viewers begin feeling that Lynch didn't take
this film too seriously; whole purpose of WILD AT HEART
seems to be to Lynch's parody of himself and his cult of
filmmaking. One of the last scenes, with its ironic homage
to Kurosawa's YOJIMBO, foreshadows the incoming reign of
another cult favourite who had based his reputation on such
homages - Quentin Tarantino.</P>
<P>Whether Lynch took plot and characters seriously might be
debatable, but the cast definitely put great efforts.
Nicolas Cage played one of the great roles of his career -
Sailor Ripley is strange combination of street thug with the
heart of gold and Elvis impersonator. Cage managed to make
him both funny and human in the same time; we both laugh at
him and sympathise with his plight. Unfortunately, his
partners weren't up to the task, mostly due to Lynch's idea
to have his characters as bizarre as possible, and his
directing probably encouraged overacting. Laura Dern puts
too much effort to make her Lula as different as possible
from squeaky-clean all-American girl from BLUE VELVET; the
result is creature that engages in chain-smoking, swearing
and torrid sex and, unfortunately, has disturbing tendency
to make rather unappealing facial expressions. Her mother,
played by Laura Dern's real mother Diane Ladd (who deserved
"Oscar" nomination for this role) plays one of the most
embarrassing incarnations of evil in the history of cinema -
sex-crazed, drunk and downright stupid creature, way below
the high standards set by Wicked Witch of the West. Even
Willem Dafoe, who probably enjoyed opportunity to play Bobby
Peru, character as far away from his best- known role of
Jesus as possible, seems wasted here. His character appears
too late to stick in memory compared with deformed and
demented villains played by Grace Zabriskie and David
Patrick Kelly. Always reliable Harry Dean Stanton, who plays
only comparatively normal character in the film, is
tragically underused. Luckily, there are many Lynch's old
associates that improve impression about film with
interesting and memorable parts in cameos - Jack Nance,
Sherilyn Fenn, Isabella Rosselini and Sheryl Lee.</P>
<P>All in all, WILD AT HEART has some flaws, yet it is still
one fine example of Lynch's directorial talent. Evident
imperfection of this film shouldn't be the reason to discard
it with the same zeal as it was hailed as masterpiece ten
years ago. WILD AT HEART is still an interesting piece of
cinema and it can still provide intense viewing experiences,
at least for those who watch it for the first time.</P>
