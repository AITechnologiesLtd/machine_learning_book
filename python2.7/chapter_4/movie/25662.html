<PRE>Space Cowboys </PRE>
<P>There really isn't a thing in "Space Cowboys" that isn't totally predictable 
and familiar, and yet it's a really
fun, feel-good movie that doesn't make you feel like you're being pandered 
to. </P>
<P>Maybe that's because it's got four great actors or that it's got a good 
producer/director at the helm or that
it offers an original take on an otherwise paint-by-numbers summer popcorn 
flick. It's kind of a military
thriller, it's almost a sci-fi flick but not one of those movies aimed at a 
sci-fi audiences. It's a grown-up
adventure movie that knows how to execute its story. </P>
<P>Clint Eastwood stars as a retired Air Force pilot and engineer who is called 
upon by his old boss at NASA
because a satellite is about to crash into the Earth and the technology is so 
obsolete even today's rocket
scientists can't figure it out. Yadda yadda yadda, Eastwood and his three 
old* military buddies are the only
ones who can fix it and must adapt to the new technology rapidly while at the 
same time showing up the
young hotshots who think they're geniuses. </P>
<P>It's pretty easy to tell what's going to happen here right? Fish-out-of-water 
stuff, "Let me do it my way
junior"-lines and attitudes, an executive commander who's obviously a weasel 
and a really fantastic ending
involving "we'll just barely make it if our calculations are 
correct"-climaxes. But as much as it sounds like
"Apollo 13," "Space Cowboys" really has a lot going for it. Sending four old 
men into space doesn't seem
like all that far-fetched of an idea (not after John Glenn), and Eastwood and 
company seem to be having a
great time here. The screenplay is thorough with its characters and doesn't 
waste our time trying to explain
the details of the "real" conflict going on. It doesn't matter, everyone here 
is doing such a good job it's
actually, uh what's that word - enjoyable. </P>
