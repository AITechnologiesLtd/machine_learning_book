<PRE>                                   NORTH
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Elijah Wood, Jon Lovitz, Mathew McCurley, Jason Alexander,
           Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, Bruce Willis.
Screenplay:  Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman.
Director:  Rob Reiner.</P>
<P>     In 1987, director Rob Reiner brought to the screen a satirical
fantasy that was thought to be unfilmable, William Goldman's THE
PRINCESS BRIDE.  Though uneven, it basically worked thanks to a genuine
sense of whimsy and Goldman's own clever adaptation.  The relative
success of THE PRINCESS BRIDE would seem to suggest that if anyone
could make a movie out of Alan Zweibel's goofy fable NORTH, it would be
Reiner.  Wrong.  Instead, he has turned out a smug, tedious and
wrong-headed mess which wraps the moral of THE WIZARD OF OZ in a
thoroughly unappealing package.</P>
<P>     NORTH is the name of a multi-talented eleven-year-old (Elijah
Wood) who feels that he is being ignored by his self-involved parents
(Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss).  He decides that he deserves
better, and declares himself a free agent, offering himself to the most
attractive pair of parents.  A judge grants North's request under the
condition that he make his final choice in two months or face being
sent to an orphanage.  North then sets off on a globe-spanning quest
for the perfect parents which inspires a kid's rights movement,
masterminded by North's devious classmate Winchell (Mathew McCurley)
and an ambulance-chasing lawyer (Jon Lovitz).  Along the way, North
receives advice from a ubiquitous man (Bruce Willis) who acts as his
guardian angel.</P>
<P>     For a few moments at the very beginning, NORTH looks like it might
be on the right track.  There is a clever little sequence showing North
as a brilliant student, a top athlete and a budding star of the musical
theater, pitched at just the right level of low-key surreality; a bit
later, a series of parents chastise their children with all the things
that "North wouldn't" do.  But very early on, NORTH takes a precipitous
dive into near-unwatchability.  North's encounters with his prospective
parents (including Dan Aykroyd and Reba McIntire as "How-dee" Texans,
and Kathy Bates and Graham Greene as Eskimos) are repetitious and
annoying, all variations on the same theme.  In order for the
fairy-tale one-dimensionality of these parents to work, they all need
to represent something unique, not interchangeable levels of
stupidity.  Most surprising, Reiner paces everything at a crawl,
including a production number in the Texas sequence which should have
pumped some life in the proceedings.  Instead, it's just another part
of an 89 minute film which feels 85 minutes too long.</P>
<P>     There is yet another massive misstep with an emphasis on the
subplot involving Mathew McCurley as the miniature Machiavelli and Jon
Lovitz as his attorney-toady.  McCurley is allowed to chew the scenery,
lisping ruthless-beyond-his-years dialogue and mincing about in
suspenders and slicked back hair (as sure a sign of cinematic evil as a
"666" tattoo).  Cringing is Lovitz's forte, and he gets to do a lot of
it, playing to all of his worst instincts.  The youth revolt might have
worked with a lighter touch, but Reiner makes it too nasty, darkened
further by a murder plot which engenders a pointless chase.</P>
<P>     Where did so much talent go so dreadfully wrong?  Reiner has been
box-office gold; co-screenwriters Zweibel (an original "Saturday Night
Live" scribe) and Andrew Scheinman (this summer's pleasant fantasy
LITTLE BIG LEAGUE) have some great product under their belts.  Elijah
Wood, a talented young actor, is a rather obnoxious North, taking the
book's more measured nine-year-old protagonist and turning him into an
adolescent packing a serious attitude.  Reiner probably called in every
favor he had to pepper NORTH with cameos, but they serve only to show
that it's possible for an entire supporting cast to be as bored making
a film as the audience is watching it.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the biggest mystery of NORTH is for what audience it
was intended.  It's too slow and full of dopey in-jokes to keep kids
interested, and too simplistic for adults.  Rob Reiner had better
check his compass; he got dreadfully lost trying to find NORTH.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 sets of parents:  2.</PRE>
