<P>THE MIGHTY (M).  
(Miramax/Village Roadshow)
Director: Peter Chelsom
Stars: Sharon Stone, Gena Rowlands, Harry Dean Stanton, James Gandolfini, 
Gillian Anderson, Meatloaf, Keiran Culkin, Elden Henson, Joe Perrino,
Jennifer Lewis
Running time: 100 minutes.</P>
<P>This moving and ultimately uplifting tale explores the unusual
friendship that develops between two twelve year old outcasts.  The
Mighty is also an inspiring fable about the power of the imagination
and friendship to heal scars, both emotional and physical.  Based on
the book by Rodman Philbrick, The Mighty is also free of the
excessively saccharine and overtly manipulative narrative structure of
the recent Simon Birch.  While the two films share a number of themes,
The Mighty is by far the warmer and more broadly appealing film.
However, the later stages may prove a little too intense for younger
children.</P>
<P>Max (Elden Henson) lives with his grandparents (Gena Rowlands
and Harry Dean Stanton).  Because of his hulking size he is the object
of much fun at school.  His new next door neighbour is Gwen (Sharon
Stone), a single mother, and her crippled son Kevin (Keiran Culkin),
who suffers from a degenerative wasting disease.  Gwen has raised
Kevin alone ever since his father ran out on them as soon as the
doctor announced that the child was suffering from a genetic disorder.
Despite their initial mistrust of each other, Max and Kevin quickly
develop a strong friendship when they realise that they can each offer
the other something.</P>
<P>Kevin teaches Max to read and helps him appreciate the world
through the power of imagination.  Max is afraid that he will turn out
to be a vicious killer just like his father (James Gandolfini), but
Kevin calms his fears.  In return, Max provides Kevin with a pair of
legs and helps him travel around the city, taking in the sights and
enjoying activities that would normally be beyond his grasp.
Eventually their friendship opens up new worlds of possibility for
both of them, and together they take on the world like modern day
counterparts of King Arthur and his legendary knights of the round
table.</P>
<P>But events take a nasty turn when Max's father suddenly
reappears and takes his son away.  The crippled Kevin charges to the
rescue.  These scenes may prove a little too intense and scary for
some audiences.</P>
<P>British director Peter Chelsom (Funny Bones, etc) has a
feeling for the offbeat and the unusual, but he handles the material
with insight and compassion.  A former director of commercials he
brings a strong visual style to the movie without sacrificing the
emotional content of Charles Leavitt's screenplay.  He injects a sense
of realism into the movie through clever use of locations around
Toronto and Cincinnati.</P>
<P>Stone is impressive in a smaller role, and delivers one of her
better screen performances.  The film boasts strong supporting
performances from a truly scary Gandolfini, veterans Rowlands and
Stanton, and The X Files' Gillian Anderson, playing against type in a
more down beat role.  However, it is the solid and likeable
performances of Culkin and Henson that carry the film and provide its
emotional punch.  The pair, both of whom are also featured in the
recent She's All That, are enormously appealing, and deliver heartfelt
and natural performances.</P>
<P>This mighty film is much better than the recent Simon Birch,
as it explores how friendship and the power of the imagination help
our two off beat heroes transcend their harsh environment.  Its quaint
flights of fancy prove surprisingly effective!</P>
