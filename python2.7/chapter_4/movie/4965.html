<PRE>                             A FAMILY THING
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     It has been only two days since the Oscars were awarded and
already I am certain that the film I saw last night,  A FAMILY THING,
is going to be one of those nominated for the 1996 Oscar's Best
Picture, Best Actors and Best Supporting Actress.    This is a film
with an original story , written by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom
Epperson.   This one will get to you.</P>
<P>     Earl Pitcher, Jr. (Robert Duvall) who is in his sixties, lives in
a little town in Arkansas. Very soon after the film opens, his aged
mother dies.   Several days later he is given an envelope by a trusted
friend of the family who had been instructed by the dying woman to
give the envelope to Earl when she died.   Upon opening the envelope,
Earl is in for the shock of his life. He discovers that the woman he
thought was his mother and who had raised him was not his mother at
all.   Some sixty years ago, his father had "slept" with a young,
pretty, black woman and she became pregnant.  When the child was born,
it was white.   Earl's father's wife decided she would raise the
child.</P>
<P>     The letter speaks about a half-brother, gives his name , Ray
Murdock (James Earl Jones) but is vague as to his whereabouts
somewhere in Chicago.    Earl confronts his father, Earl Sr.. (James
Harrell) and  the guilty look is evidence that the story is true.
Earl sets out for Chicago to try to find the truth of what happened,
who his blood family really is.   Before the film ends he learns a lot
about  "life" and about blacks and mostly about himself.</P>
<P>     The film's direction is perfect with pathos and hilarity vying
with each other every moment. Beautiful support is given by Ray's
Auntie (Irma P Hall), a blind, old lady who does not give an inch as
she raises her nephew and his son, Virgil (Michael Beach) to be decent
human beings. No attempt is made to soften the "bad" sections of the
black area.  Everything about the film rings true.    You will be
talking about it long after you have left the theater.  Excellent.</P>
