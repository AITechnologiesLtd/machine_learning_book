<PRE>Review:                WAKING NED DEVINE</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Ian Bannen, David Kelly</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>There is more than one definition for the word, Wake, and when you learn
that this is an Irish movie, you realize which definition it has.  This is
a truly enjoyable, funny film from the moment it begins until the final
sunset.</P>
<P>There are few people who haven't dreamed of winning the lottery.  All
those millions of dollars would certainly change our lives, but how? 
Would we spend it?  Invest it?  Give it away?  Share it with friends? 
When a winning lottery ticket is sold in the town of Tulaigh Mhor,
Ireland, a town of only 52 residents, the question is….who owns the ticket?</P>
<P>Ian Bannen and David Kelly set out to uncover the winner by being
especially nice to the one[s] they suspect hold the coveted ticket. 
First, they buy drinks for `Pig' Finn when he suddenly appears in a sports
car. Then, the lady at the post office [who sold the ticket]. But, the
real comedy begins when they discover that Ned Devine bought the winner,
and the shock of seeing the numbers was too much for him.  As Ned had no
heirs, the money will go to the state.  They are sure that Ned wouldn't
have wanted that to happen, so they concoct a scheme to claim the jackpot
for themselves.  </P>
<P>The humor that follows is clever and original.  There is a scene with
David Kelly on a motor scooter that will stay in my memory for years.  The
telling of the plot cannot take the place of seeing it for yourself.  In
the course of the story, you learn about most of the 52 residents of the
town.  You get to know them and you care about their lives.  And, the
question remains, what would Ned Devine have done with the money?  The
plot takes one turn after another, but they are always believable.  You
can foresee some of the things that occur, but they aren't always what you
expect.</P>
<P>An audience member remarked to me that she was surprised that there were
no four-letter words in an Irish movie.  It was a strange statement, I
thought.  The same could be said about American movies.  Waking Ned Devine
is an excellent example of wonderful dialogue that doesn't need to stoop
to that level for humor.</P>
<P>I cannot wait to see this movie again.  And, I want to take others to
see it as well.  I hope that this gets the same word of mouth that `The
Full Monty' got.  People who see it will love it, even though there are no
big name stars.  I give it an A-.</P>
