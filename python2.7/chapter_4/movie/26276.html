SMILING FISH AND GOAT ON FIRE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>SMILING FISH AND GOAT ON FIRE is a sweet little slice of life story 
about three guys in search of love.  The first two are brothers, Chris 
and Tony Remi, played by real-life brothers Derick and Steven Martini.  
The Martini brothers share the writing credits with the film's director, 
Kevin Jordan.  </P>
<P>The third man on a romantic mission is Clive Winter, played with the 
most charisma in a consistently likeable cast by veteran actor Bill 
Henderson.  Over a half-century older than the twentysomething Remi 
brothers, Clive hopes, with a little help from some killer sweets, to 
join his long-time love in heaven.  In the meantime, Clive preaches the 
gospel of "the potential for magnetic perfection." Once a soundman on 
old Paul Robeson pictures, Clive sees everything through the magic of 
sound, treating it with spiritual reverence.</P>
<P>Clive's character, as fascinating and original as it is, is relegated to 
the side ring.  The movie is about the brothers, who were named Smiling 
Fish and Goat On Fire by their grandmother, who was half Italian and 
half Native American.  (Tony is Smiling Fish, and Chris is Goat On Fire.  
Or is it the other way round?  It doesn't matter if you can't keep them 
straight since the story barely mentions the nicknames.)</P>
<P>As the movie opens, the brothers, who live together as best friends, are 
both in the process of being dumped by their girlfriends.  Tony's 
girlfriend, Nicole (Heather Jae Marie), leaves in a huff, believing that 
Tony has been cheating on her.  More complicated is the situation with 
Chris's girlfriend, Alison (Amy Hathaway).  A recent weeper during sex, 
she claims that her proclivity to vomiting doesn't mean she's pregnant.  
She starts to tell Chris what is on her mind, only to stop in 
mid-thought and clam up entirely.</P>
<P>Girlfriendless, the two handsome guys find love with others.  Tony, an 
unemployed actor, hits it off with his postal carrier (Christa Miller) 
and her little daughter (Nicole Rae).  The daughter and Tony audition 
together for different parts in the same movie.  Any story that uses a 
female mail carrier as an object of romantic desire deserves some extra 
credit.  Name another movie where that has happened.</P>
<P>Chris meets and falls for a fetchingly beautiful Italian named Anna 
(Rosemarie Addeo), who is an animal wrangler of chickens for a music 
video -- the film is set in a short-sleeved L.A. during the Christmas 
season.  An accountant, Chris finds himself accidentally using the worst 
come-on line in the book on Anna.  "Come on by," he tells her.  "I'll do 
your taxes."  He is completely embarrassed by his lack of grace as soon 
as the words leave his mouth.  If there were an undo function for 
speech, he would have selected it immediately.</P>
<P>The good-spirited movie is likeable although forgettable fluff, but its 
charm easily wins you over, even if its script is a bit thin.  Its most 
lasting result, however, is that it makes you want to see more of 
everyone associated with the production.</P>
<P>SMILING FISH AND GOAT ON FIRE runs a fast 1:30.  It is rated R for 
language, some sexual content and brief drug use and would be fine for 
most teenagers.</P>
