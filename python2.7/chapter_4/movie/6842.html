<P>     SHADOW CONSPIRACY marks Charlie Sheen's second consecutive=20
conspiracy thriller.  Of course, there are several notable differences=20
between this and THE ARRIVAL, the most obvious of which has to do with=20
basic quality.  For, while last summer's alien invasion film used a=20
reasonably smart script to frame its action sequences, director George=20
P. Cosmatos' SHADOW CONSPIRACY doesn't seem remotely concerned with the=20
concept of "intelligence".  This movie, which was originally slated for=20
an October 1996 release, got thrown in the "wait until January" dumper=20
with the likes of TURBULENCE and IN LOVE AND WAR.  Anyone who wastes=20
their time seeing the movie won't have to wonder why.</P>
<P>     For an action flick to work on any level, it's necessary to get the=20
audience's adrenaline pumping.  Routine, workmanlike sequences featuring=20
characters we don't care about in situations that aren't interesting are=20
more likely to produce boredom than excitement, and that's exactly what=20
happens with SHADOW CONSPIRACY.  Here, we have stereotyped villains=20
involved in a generic, high-level conspiracy, and a couple of equally-
bland heroes on the run.  Even although there's supposed to have once=20
been a love affair between the two protagonists, Bobby Bishop (Charlie=20
Sheen) and Amanda Givens (Linda Hamilton), they exhibit absolutely no=20
chemistry. =20</P>
<P>     The story starts out with an extended sequence demonstrating how=20
adept Presidential aid Bishop is at diffusing politically dangerous=20
situations.  Soon, however, he has the great misfortune of being in the=20
wrong place at the wrong time.  He's a witness to the murder of=20
Professor Yuri Pochenko (Theodore Bikel), and, as a result, becomes a=20
target himself.  To stay alive, he's forced to go into hiding. =20
Meanwhile, the Vice President (Ben Gazzara), the President (Sam=20
Waterston), and the Chief of Staff (Donald Sutherland) want him found=20
and brought in.  Eventually, Bishop goes to his old flame, WASHINGTON=20
HERALD reporter Givens, and the two of them end up on the run together,=20
with a crack hit man (Stephen Lang) never far behind.</P>
<P>     As always seems to be the case in conspiracy films, the identity of=20
the real villain is kept hidden.  By the time this mastermind in=20
unveiled -- and it's not a revelation that should shock anyone -- we=20
simply don't care.  This dismal motion picture never manages to engage=20
us with its meandering plot and moronic dialogue, and the longer it=20
runs, the less interested we become in anything except the arrival of=20
the end credits.</P>
<P>     Charlie Sheen is completely wrong for the role of Bishop.  We don't=20
believe him as the savvy spin doctor at the White House, nor do we=20
accept him as an action hero.  Linda Hamilton isn't any better.  Her=20
character's chief purpose consists of finding different ways to ask=20
Bishop, "What are we going to do now?"  It's something of a comedown for=20
the heroine of two TERMINATOR movies.  As for Donald Sutherland=85 this is=
=20
just another mail-in performance from an actor who has done this part=20
far too often in recent years.</P>
<P>     SHADOW CONSPIRACY even manages to disappoint once you get beyond=20
the regurgitated action sequences, limp acting, and dumb dialogue. =20
Despite being projected with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, the film has a=20
cheap, low-budget appearance.  The camera work is flat and dull, and the=20
sets are uniformly unconvincing.  Everything about this movie looks=20
cheesy, and it hurts our ability to take even the smallest details=20
seriously.  At one point, Donald Sutherland's character makes the=20
following statement: "In reality, it's nothing but shallow, superficial,=20
pompous manipulation."  And, while that line isn't supposed to be a=20
commentary about the movie, it might as well be.</P>
