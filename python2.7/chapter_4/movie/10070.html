"Flubber" Has Bounce
        by Homer Yen
        (c) 1997</PRE>
<P>Bowling balls bounce high into the air and out of sight.  Basketball
players make incredible slam dunks by leaping from mid-court.   Golf
balls ricochet off walls like a pinball.   All this thanks to a
mysterious rubber polymer called Flubber.  It's unique characteristic
is that when you apply a little amount of energy, it gives off an
exponential amount in return.  This breakthrough was discovered by
Professor Philip Brainard (Robin Williams), a genius when it comes to
science but a forgetful dolt when it comes to daily routines.  He goes
to the wrong class to teach, he easily forgets names, and worst of
all, he has already twice missed his wedding ceremony.   "One more
chance," says finacee Sara Jean Reynolds (Marcia Gay Harden), who is
also President of Medfield College where they both work.  But Sara
Jean has more than an absent-minded professor to worry about.
Medfield is also bankrupt, and a greedy creditor is about to
foreclose.</P>
<P>Brainard knows that Flubber holds the answer to his woes.  As an
alternative energy source (he modifies his old car so that it can
fly), companies would pay millions.  He could save the college and
salvage his relationship all at once.  However, people soon learn
about his discovery and want to steal it including the creditor and a
rival scientist.</P>
<P>This is a  pleasant film, but it's appeal is geared towards a younger
audience.  Robin Williams gives a charismatically manic performance as
the memory-challenged professor.  He is likable, but his fellow
performers seem kind of silly.  The comedy is purely slapstick, and
thus begins to curiously look like one of those Home Alone movies.
People get hit by flying objects, they slip and fall, and everyone
generally winds up with a head full of lumps.  If there is any proof
that the comedy is pure silliness, all you have to know is that two of
the hired goons are named Smith and Wesson.  But this is also a Disney
production, and Disney's brand of wonderful magic is present
throughout the film.  Flubber takes on a cute, life-like quality (it
whimpers and whines); there is a terrific sequence that involves a
basketball game pitting jocks versus 'flubberized' nerds; and there is
an incredible dancing sequence which I can only describe as the
Flubber Mambo.  The professor is also aided by a cute, self-aware,
floating, mechanical assistant named Weebo.  She flashes images on her
miniature television screen from various shows to convey her feelings.
Why didn't the professor just create more of these?  They'd sell like
hotcakes!  He probably forgot.</P>
<P>While flubber may ultimately save Medfield college, it isn't enough to
make this movie anything truly special.</P>
