<PRE>                             'TIL THERE WAS YOU
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     A cute idea with questionable delivery, 'TIL THERE WAS YOU is a
romantic comedy for the very patient among us.  Clocking in at almost
two hours, my biggest complaint is the desperate need for some
cut-cut-cutting -- editing which would have made the film a much more
enjoyable experience.  It's a cute idea:  Gwen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and
Nick (Dylan McDermott) are meant for each other, but they never seem to
cross paths.  Also in the picture is Francesca (Sarah Jessica Parker), a
now-grown-up child actress who ends up being the catalyst that
inevitably brings the couple together.  Written by "My So-Called Life"
scribe Winnie Holzman, the story is absolutely dripping in the expected
melodramatics and sentimentality -- but that's not necessarily bad. 
It's just that when you combine the film's tedious length with
questionable casting decisions (Parker disappoints, & Jennifer Aniston
plays a surgeon(!?)) you get a fine mess that eventually redeems
itself... just not all the way.</P>
