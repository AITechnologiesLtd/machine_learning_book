The Conversation (1974)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 65</PRE>
<P>It is ironic that "The Conversation" was released the same year
that Nixon resigned.  Nixon was forced out of office largely
because he was caught committing crimes on tape.  And "The
Conversation" is about the consequences of bugging.</P>
<P>Gene Hackman plays a professional wiretapper.  He is well-paid
getting the scoop on others, but is very secretive, to the
point of paranoia, about guarding his own personal life.
He tapes a young couple's conversation, and begins to worry
about what may happen to them.  The man says to the woman,
"they'll kill us if they can."</P>
<P>Hackman refuses to turn the tapes in to his client, despite
increasing pressure from a young Harrison Ford, who is a
cheerless bad guy.  In fact, everyone in this movie is cheerless.
It is also slow, which is good for character development,
except the only character getting screen attention is
Hackman, and he doesn't reveal very much.</P>
<P>Women seem to want Hackman.  This seems odd, given that
he is middle-aged, nerdy, secretive, and withdrawn.
He also spies on them.  And others spy on him.
The theme of everyone under surveillance was better
developed, with more humor, in "The Anderson Tapes" (1971)
although "The Conversation" has the better cinematography.</P>
<P>John Cazale has a supporting role.  The only other movies I've 
seen him in are the Godfather films, "The Deer Hunter" (1979)
and "Dog Day Afternoon" (1975).  He sure found his way into 
good films.  I guess his goofy looks kept him from being cast
in insipid romantic comedies.</P>
<P>Look fast for Robert Duvall as the shadowy, well-guarded Director.</P>
<P>An interesting film, and a chance to see Shirley (Cindy Williams)
without Laverne, and Ford as a laconic villian (rather than a 
laconic hero).  Nominated for best picture, "The Conversation" is 
a bit overrated.  Towards the end it is hard to tell what's real 
and what's not, but then the surrealist moments are the best 
in the film.</P>
