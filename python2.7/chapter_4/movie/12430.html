<PRE>HE GOT GAME (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Sports movies are a hard genre to work with, especially if you don't want
to make a comedy or a family film - categories which most sports movies
fall into.  But, every once in a long while there comes a sports film that
is neither, and that really hits home.  The one that I remember most is
Field of Dreams.  I haven't seen a good sports film in a long time.</P>
<P>I'm certain that had He Got Game been done by any other writer/director it
would have failed, but in the hands of Spike Lee, He Got Game is one of the
best films of 1998 and will probably make my top 10 list.</P>
<P>Who's got game?  A kid named Jesus Shuttlesworth (Ray Allen), who's a
graduating senior at the real-life Lincoln high school on Coney Island.
Jesus is so good at basketball that every college wants him and every NBA
team wants him.  What is Jesus going to do?</P>
<P>Someone else has game also, though. Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington)
is the father of Jesus.  He's currently serving time in a prison with 15
years to go.  What landed Jake in prison?  He killed his wife.  With this
act, he split his whole family apart - turning Jesus into an embittered
young man who has taught himself to believe that he has no father.  With a
week to go before Jesus needs to decide about going to college or going
pro, the governor has a proposal for Jake.  He will try to reduce Jake's
sentence and help him get early parole if Jake will convince Jesus to go to
the governor's alma mater, Big State.</P>
<P>What Spike Lee does with He Got Game is amazing.  He slowly unravels a
story which on the surface looks and feels like a run-of-the-mill sports
film.  But underneath, he starts to reveal the pressure and events that
happen around a star basketball player ready to make "the most important
decision of his life."  Lee starts showing us that from sex, to money, to
new cars, the people around Jesus will try anything to convince him to do
what they want.  And with this, they also want a piece of what Jesus will
be making.</P>
<P>He Got Game relies directly on the relationship between the father and son.
 Onscreen this relationship lives, and lives only because of a brilliant
performance by Denzel Washington.  Washington puts his all onscreen and it
shows.  This time around, Washington is not playing an egghead - as in
Crimson Tide - or an everyday man - like in the forgettable but enjoyable
Fallen.  No, this time he plays a poor man with a lot of failings,
including the killing of his wife.  I walked in thinking that Washington
would play Jake as a hard-nosed embittered man, but my hunch turned out all
wrong.  The only embittered one was Jesus.  Washington plays Jake as a guy
who regrets most of the things that he has done in his life. </P>
<P>The weak link in all of this is the stiff performance by Ray Allen.
Although Lee coerces Allen into a decent performance, it's not enough to
take He Got Game from a great film to an all-time great film.  It is a good
start for Allen, though, and I wish him well in his further acting jobs.</P>
<P>Spike Lee has always been a favourite writer and director of mine.  His Do
The Right Thing is one of my favourite films (and for those of you who
don't know me personally, my nickname is Mookie, which is the name of Lee's
character in Do The Right Thing.)  With He Got Game, Lee has one-upped
himself and this is now my favourite Spike Lee film.  Lee has a particular
style in the way that he shoots his films and this all shows in a wonderful
opening montage of people playing basketball across America.  This is one
of the best openings I've ever experienced and shows the love of basketball
that Lee has. </P>
<P>What's interesting to note is that although He Got Game is about
basketball, there are no extended sequences of basketball in the movie.  We
only see a one-on-one game between Jake and Jesus.  We get some flashes of
basketball games, but the focus is never on the sport - Spike Lee uses it
to explore the things that go around the game.</P>
<P>Worth mentioning is the music by Aaron Copland, which is downright
American.  Copland's music along with Lee's imagery is wonderous.</P>
<P>Next to Ray Allen, there are two smaller weak links in He Got Game.  One is
a sub-plot about a prostitute (Milla Jovovich) and Jake.  And the other is
the awkward symbolic ending, which irked me the most.</P>
<P>He Got Game is a Don't Miss movie that never fails to entertain.  This film
is powerful, moving, and all the while it holds our attention with a
well-written relationship between a father and a son.</P>
