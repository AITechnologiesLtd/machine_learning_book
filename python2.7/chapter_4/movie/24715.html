<P>Way back when, I fell in love with a movie called THE BEAR, a film that 
explored the non-animated, non-comical lives of two bears fighting 
against man and nature.  When it finally came out on DVD, I bought it, 
savoring the memory of having seen a rousing story told without the 
trickery of singing beasts and wisecracking sidekicks. I mention this 
because, for a short while, I had a glimmer of a hope that - given the 
beautifully epic sweep shown in its previews - DINOSAUR could also tell 
its tale without smarminess, or at least with the finesse of a TOY STORY.</P>
<PRE>And then, the monkeys spoke.</PRE>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
After being mistakenly dropped, as an egg, into a group of lemurs--among 
them, father and group leader Yar (Ossie Davis), mother Pilo (Alfre 
Woodard), Zini (Max Casella), a hopeful (hopeless?) bachelor and Comic 
Relief, and daughter Suri (Hayden Panettiere)--Aladar the dinosaur (D.B. 
Sweeney) is brought up as a member of the lemur family.  Aladar and the 
lemurs' world is changed forever when giant meteors fall onto their 
island, and they find themselves among other plant-eating dinosaurs, led 
by Darwin-loving Kron (Samuel E. Wright), his heart-of-gold sister Neera 
(Julianna Margulies), tough guy Bruton (Peter Siragusa), Baylene the 
slow-moving Brachiosaur (Joan Plowright), and Eema (Della Reese), a 
Weary Ol' Styrachosaur--all searching for the "nesting grounds", while 
trying to stay two steps ahead of the dreaded meat-eating Carnotaurs.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Actually, I'm probably being unfair to DINOSAUR in comparing it to the 
cinematic wonders of a "Bear" or the Fun Enough For An Adult (But It's 
Made For A Kiddie) fare found in a "Toy Story"; then again, with the 
oodles and oodles of dough Disney dumped into this project, you'd think 
they'd remember the number one rule: make the story interesting.</P>
<P>Instead, they blew their wad on making the pretty pictures, and 
scripting some awfully pedestrian lines which were proffered up by good 
actors like D.B. Sweeney, Ossie Davis, Joan Plowright, and Alfre 
Woodard--all actors whose talents belie what sounded like mere 
journeymanism on their parts.  I was never convinced that these were 
anything but actors reading scripted lines (don't laugh; Toy Story had 
me every step of the way); instead of seeing big dinos and silly little 
monkeys, I found myself listening for familiar voices ("yep, that's 
Julianna Margulies reading 'Neera', sounding a whole lot like 'Carol 
Hathaway'...and hmmm, I wonder what James Earl Jones would've sounded 
like as 'Kron'...").    </P>
<P>The filmmakers seemed to count on childrens' love of dinosaurs (and, uh, 
hasn't that fad played out by now?  Last I checked, Pikachu was the 
in-thing with the young'uns) and All Things Disney, to carry the day by 
coming to see this movie in droves.  That they'll get the kids in, I 
have no doubt.  Will the movie keep their hyperactive attention?  Well, 
that's another story.  Will it reel in the adults?  Well, it's a 
certainty that it didn't keep my attention.  </P>
<P>Why?  That one's easy: it lacked the spirit of fun, going instead for 
the preachiness of  pounding a number of morals into the audience's 
head, to the point where I went begging for aspirin for the headache I 
developed.  It certainly didn't help that for some bizarre reason, a 
narrator was tacked on to the beginning and ending, a'swingin' away with 
the Whifflebat Of Exposition.  I reckon it's not A Good Thing when you 
start rooting for the bad meat-eating dinosaurs to corner the cute 
little plant-eaters and thrash them about the head until they just shut 
up, ya think?  And if I see and hear another wisecracking movie monkey, 
I think I might do Damage.</P>
<P>[And at risk of being roasted by parents of young kidlets everywhere - 
"This is a children's film, you insensitive cad!" - let me just say that 
Black folk ain't the *only* ones who talk at the movies.  Maybe It's 
Just Me; maybe it's asking too much to expect parents to tell their 
children that, no Billy, it's not polite to scream at the top of your 
lungs every time you get bored and want more JuJu Beans.  Yeah.  It's 
probably Just Me.]</P>
<P>DINOSAUR certainly had its Moments.  On the technical front, it was 
drawn beautifully, and the creatures' movements seemed to be handled 
realistically (as much as one could expect); the lemurs, for instance, 
were made to move in a somewhat-sideways gait, not the straight-ahead 
walk of, say, apes. [And, speaking of lemurs, correct me if I'm wrong--
but since when would there be dinosaurs occupying the same era as lemurs?
I mean, *talking* lemurs are bad enough; d'ya really expect me to swallow
the lemurs talking before their proper time? I think not!]  Story-wise, 
I chuckled a few times at Della Reese's Weary Ol' Black Chick lines.  
And if you've seen the long trailer--the one without the talking 
lemurs--you've pretty much seen the most exciting part of the flick.  
But a few Moments here or there do not an interesting story make, 
especially in a movie that's supposedly a Big Summer Event.  The 
animation-lover in me was dazzled by the drawings, but like a 
badly-dubbed karate flick, the pictures and the sound didn't quite match 
up.</P>
<P>I don't doubt for a second that this movie will make a gazillion dollars 
this year and beyond, judging from the number of rather loud (but, 
noticeably, not laughing) kids in my audience.  Still, box office 
considerations aside, DINOSAUR is a big and pretty airhead of a movie.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
DINOSAUR may have been great eye candy to look at--and until the monkeys 
first spoke, it was indeed beautiful, without distraction--but they 
forgot to build something into this movie: heart.  Fun- and story-wise, 
the toys in Toy Story and the ants in A Bug's Life ran circles around 
the big dino brutes.  One thing in its favor, though: at least there 
were no singing prehistoric critters.</P>
<P>DINOSAUR (rating: flashing yellowlight): 
This one's sense of wonder went extinct about 10 minutes in.</P>
