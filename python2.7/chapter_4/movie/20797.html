<PRE>Five Easy Pieces
**** out of four</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Bob Rafelson</PRE>
<P>Written by Carole Eastman (as Adrien Joyce) and Bob Rafelson</P>
<PRE>Starring:

Fannie Flagg as Stoney
Sally Struthers as Betty</PRE>
<P>The calling card of Five Easy Pieces is Jack Nicholson's line "I want you to
hold it between your knees." And indeed, nearly 30 years after it was
released, this is what is ultimately remembered about the film: Jack
Nicholson demanding from a waitress that he wants two slices of wheat toast
and his explanation on how she should get it. A chicken salad sandwich, with
wheat toast, hold the chicken. "You want me to hold the chicken?"</P>
<P>I can't tell you how many times I've heard that line imitated by people
trying to do a Jack impersonation. Most times, people get it wrong, saying
"stick it" rather than "hold it". It's famous, I guess, because it deals
with our frustrations of never getting what we want. Nicholson has to go out
of his way simply to get two slices of wheat toast. Imagine how challenging
it must be when there are far greater possessions for him to obtain: love,
respect, dignity, reliable transportation, etc...</P>
<P>However, it's unfortunate that the film is left standing by the side of the
road with only that scene. People don't recognize it as a moment of
frustration, only Nicholson saying something really Jack-like. Surrounding
the famous line is a truly great and completely intelligent character study.
Here, we see so many real people go in and out of this movie, providing
layer upon layer of wonderful dialogue, moments and life. Now it's a chicken
salad sandwich without the chicken salad. </P>
<P>Nicholson plays a drifter, who at the start of the film works on an oil rig.
He soon quits, I think, because he realizes he's too good for this kind of
work? Why? Because he used to be a talented musician, raised in a musical
family. Instead of using those talents, he lives the life of someone who
always wants something more, mistreating and hurting the things that he has.
He mentally abuses and degrades his girlfriend, the only person in the film
that seems to be able to love somebody unconditionally. But he's not
interested in unconditional love, instead he does whatever he can to get her
to run from him. </P>
<P>This is slow paced film, and I imagine that's a reason that this movie isn't
mentioned in the same breath with other great films made in the seventies.
Current movies must move incredibly quickly, with sharp editing, fast
dialogue and speeches that can never be said. Even recent character studies
won't allow characters to elaborate because it would take up too much screen
time and make for slow pacing. Five Easy Pieces gives the audience a chance
to savor its speeches and long moments of silence and reflection.  Consider
Nicholson's speech to his father, admitting his failures to man who cannot
speak back, only sit in a wheelchair with condemning. It is moment that is
as moving and powerful as the closing speech to "Death of a Salesman", full
of agony and regret. </P>
<P>This is one of Nicholson's best performances, a variation on his character
studies of men in search for purpose in an age when their role was
dramatically shifting after 200 years of static.  It reminds me, in a way,
of Dostoyesky's Crime and Punishment, about a character who believed himself
as a superman - so intellectually above the society he lives in that he feel
he can do whatever he wants, regardless of consequence. Nicholson acts in a
similar manner, wandering through people's lives and hurting them, mostly
because he's too selfish to understand how not to.</P>
