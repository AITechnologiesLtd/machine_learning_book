<P>Many local reviewers have already unfairly dismissed this film
before they have even seen it - purely because they dislike its star
Adam Sandler.  However, there are many people out there who seem to
like Sandler's deliberately low brow, dumb brand of humour, and
ultimately they will judge this film on its merits.</P>
<P>The romantic comedy The Wedding Singer showed a slightly
different side to Sandler's talents, and appealed to a broader
audience.  While Big Daddy is not quite as enjoyable, it is still one
of Sandler's more genial and pleasing efforts, and should also prove a
big hit.</P>
<P>Sandler often plays the petulant, eternal adolescent who is
eventually forced to grow up and face up to his responsibilities.  Big
Daddy takes this familiar premise, but adds a cute kid and some
emotional punch to the trusty formula.  Sandler plays Sonny Kouvacs, a
law school graduate who prefers the easy life, living off a
compensation deal from an old accident.  His girl friend Vanessa
(Kristy Swanson) despairs of him ever making a serious commitment to
their relationship.  When an accident of fate temporarily leaves Sonny
in charge of five year old Julian (newcomers Cole and Dylan Sprouse),
he finally sees fatherhood as a way of taking the next step in his
life.</P>
<P>However, Vanessa has dumped him for an older man, leaving
Sonny to raise the child alone.  Although initially reluctant to take
on any sort of responsibility, he gradually finds himself warming to
the boy, and a relationship develops between the pair.  Sonny finds
that Julian's presence helps in establishing a meaningful relationship
with beautiful lawyer Layla (Joey Lauren Adams, from Chasing Amy,
etc), who happens to be the sister-in-law of his former room mate.
Sonny is eventually forced to take the final step into long postponed
adulthood when he has to step into a courtroom to fight for his right
to adopt Julian.</P>
<P>Big Daddy has been written by Steve Franks, but Sandler and
regular collaborator Tim Herlihy have tailored the material to suit
the star's screen persona.  There are no great surprises here, as Big
Daddy is fairly formulaic stuff.  There are plenty of jokes about
urination, vomiting and other bodily functions, but it is all handled
with surprising restraint given the nature of the material.</P>
<P>Dennis Dugan, who previously directed Sandler in Happy
Gilmore, seems to know how to get the best out of his star.  He draws
a more restrained and thoughtful performance from Sandler.  The
Sprouse twins add to the cuteness factor with their irresistible,
hugely endearing turn as Sonny's foster son, and they will play a
major in the film's success.  Steve Buscemi is wonderfully droll in a
small role as a homeless derelict.</P>
<P>Big Daddy is often very funny.  But it also has enough heart
to appeal to audiences not usually drawn to Sandler's childish and
often puerile sense of humour.</P>
