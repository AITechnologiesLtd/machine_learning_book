<PRE>                                CHASERS
                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>
<P>Directed by Dennis Hopper, Written by Jon Batteer, John Rice and Dan
Gilroy Cast Tom Berenger William McNamara, Erika Eleniak, Crispin
Glover, Dean Stockwell, Gary Busey, Seymour Cassell, Federic Forrest,
Marilu Henner, Dennis Hopper</P>
<P>This movie is a poor excuse for a comedy. There is no plot and plenty of
running about with nothing better to do (I guess that's why they called
it CHASERS because there is no other relation to the plot that I can
see.)</P>
<P>The story revolves around two navy officers (Berenger and McNamara) who
are assigned to transport a beautiful, young female navy officer
(Eleniak) to her court martial. She tries to escape numerous times; they
fall in a pit where they all have to strip in order to escape; the
younger officer (McNamara) sleeps with his prisoner (totally unethical),
then falls in love with her and, the Captain (Berenger) takes pity on
them and helps them to escape to Mexico.</P>
<P>All this in the name of comedy? What utter rubbish!
At least my video recorder had a good work out with my constant
thumb-pressing on the fast forward button of my remote control.</P>
<PRE>Poor direction, writing and acting.</PRE>
<PRE>Comment: Don't bother.</PRE>
