<PRE>                             BODY OF EVIDENCE
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Body of Evidence (1993) NO STARS out of ***** - Cast: Madonna, Willem Dafoe,
Joe Mantegna, Anne Archer, Frank Langella. Directed by: Uli Edel. Running
Time: 99 minutes.</P>
<P>First of all, let me explain again that I do not care for films which rely
heavily on sexual scenes. It's not that I'm a prude or anything, far from it
actually. Sex in movies is boring. It has nothing to do with the film
itself. The plot's moving along, then sex happens. You wait for them to
finish up, and then the story can continue.</P>
<P>Even putting that bias aside, erotic thrillers are always poorly written,
with unsympathetic characters. It's difficult to like a film when even the
"good" characters are just as sleazy as the bad guys. "Body of Evidence" is
a perfect example of this type of retarded filmmaking, and easily joins the
list of the worst movies I've ever seen.</P>
<P>"Body of Evidence" stars Madonna, who has just about perfected the art of
making bad films. She plays Rebecca Carlson, a severely disturbed dominatrix
who will sleep with anyone to ensure she gets what she wants (she added some
singing and remade this film as "Evita", you might recall). She is accused
of murdering her elderly, extremely wealthy lover. The plot twist here is
that she's on trial for killing him with sex. You see, the old man had a
heart condition and their sex session were quite intense.</P>
<P>Enter the worst lawyer on the planet, Frank Dulaney (Willem Dafoe). Frank is
a good family man with an attractive wife and a young son. After Frank has
gathered up what he considers enough evidence to defend Rebecca, the trial
begins. After the first day of testimony, Frank and Rebecca have dinner
together and then he drives her home. Instantly the two are having sex (he
must really love that family of his). And this isn't your average sex
encounter either. It involves scolding hot candle wax dripping onto his
flesh, and he's actually aroused by it. A few days later after court, Frank
and Rebecca have sex in the parking garage of the courthouse (!) on a pile
of broken glass (!!).</P>
<P>Eventually, Frank's wife gets word of what is happening between Frank and
Rebecca and throws him out of the house. Frank reacts to this by immediately
going over to Rebecca's house, handcuffing her to a tree, and raping her.
This is our hero ladies and gentlemen!</P>
<P>All that's left after the ridiculous sex scenes are the courtroom scenes,
and they are equally ridiculous. First, Madonna must have had a clause in
her contract which states that if she acts poorly, everyone else must be
worse in order to attempt to make her look good. Everyone gives bad
performances. Then you've got a judge who finishes unknown euphemisms which
are begun by the lawyers in their arguments. Also, you've got the dumbest
courtroom audience ever assembled. Every word of testimony shocks them and
they must discuss everything amongst themselves. After so many outbursts,
the judge clears the court. The next day, the crowd is allowed to return.
They didn't learn their lesson though, as they keep causing a ruckus until
they get thrown out AGAIN.</P>
<P>The final scenes (if you can even make it to the final scenes) are SO inane
that I can't even begin to describe them. But the very last shot is the most
disturbing, when Frank's wife welcomes him back WITH OPEN ARMS! Come on! I'm
just thankful that there was no "Love Theme from Body of Evidence" by
Madonna, or any songs by Madonna for that matter. [R]</P>
