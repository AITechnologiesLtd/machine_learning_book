<P>  Maybe Tolstoy was not completely correct when he said that
all happy families are alike.  Take Kaylie Jones's family, for
example.  Ms. Jones, whose novel is adapted for the screen
by the Merchant-Ivory team (co-scripted by Ruth Prawer
Jhabvala), speaks of her childhood in Paris where she
attended French schools, then returned with her family to the
U.S. at the age of fourteen.  When you understand that her
father, James Jones, wrote "From Here to Eternity" and "The
Thin Red Line," you see just how closely she has described
her own experiences in a fictionalized autobiography,
"A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries."</P>
<P>   The movie portrays her as the daughter of an American
expatriate couple with the one misfortune of being
culturally neither here nor there, and yet inhabiting two worlds,
the French and the American.  Who better to bring to life the
strains of class/cultural prejudices than the Merchant-Ivory
team, whose masterpiece, an adaptation of E.M. Forster's
"Howard's End," illustrates the unwillingness of people of
different value systems to connect?</P>
<P>   "A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries" joins this year's parade
of coming-of-age stories ("Slums of Beverly Hills," "Home
Before Dark," "The Butcher"), this one told through the eyes
of Channe Willis.  Channe, played as a 15-year-old by Leelee
Sobieski and as a child by Luisa Conlon), is loved by her dad,
an expatriate writer by the name of Bill Willis (Kris
Kristofferson) and by her energetic and free-spirited mom,
Marcella (Barbara Hershey).  When the family take in a six-
year-old French orphan named Benoit (played as a child by
Samuel Gruen and as a teen by Jesse Bradford), only a
smidgen of sibling rivalry develops until Benoit and Channe
accept and learn to love each other.  They attend a bilingual
school together, where Benoit has a difficult time fitting in
because of a French prejudice against orphans.  When
Channe herself cannot adjust to school, she is befriended by
Francis Forescue (Anthony Roth Costanzo), who has a
wonderful, soprano, operatic voice and is himself ostracized
because of his sensitive, artistic nature.  After the family move
to New York (Bill, who has a congenital heart disease, wants
to be cared for by American physicians), Channe goes
through the usual rites of puberty.  Shut out in an American
high school like her brother--whom her classmates calls a
"Frog"--she throws herself into sexual affairs in an effort to
gain kindness while her depressed brother takes to moping at
home day and night in front of the TV.</P>
<P>   Though the Merchant-Ivory team favor Europe and India as
locales for their films, this is not the first work situated largely
in the U.S.  Having adapted "The Bostonians," and created
the trilogy of stories of lonely New Yorkers in "Roseland," they
are in their elementj. Here they show the U.S. to be neither
the class-tormented setting that defines European cultures nor
the home of unfettered democracy.  Their films are often
berated by American critics for their Masterpiece theater
ambiance (as critic Howard Thomson puts it, "prestigious, well
furnished, accurate, prettily cast and bland, anonymous, and
stealthily interchangeable").  Thomson feels that Ivory "does
not seem to ask large questions about his characters' options
nor is he inclined to employ robust or dangerous American
actors" (he used Paul Newman in the American movie "Mr.
and Mrs. Bridge").  </P>
<P>   The same reproach could be made for "A Soldier's
Daughter Never Cries"--the 61-year-old Kristofferson is sturdy
but hardly burns up the screen while Barbara Hershey does
not come near her exquisite performance in "The Portrait of a
Lady."  Yet the movie succeeds as a heartfelt portrayal of a
daughter's enduring love for her dad against the background
of France and America during the 60's and 70's, a period
dominated by the Vietnam War (which gets scarcely a
mention in the film).  Kristoffersen's Bill Willis is the sort of
father many a kid wishes he had, though some matronly
women might be horrified by the liberal attitude he holds
toward his daughter's sexuality.  It's no wonder that Channe's
latest boyfriend is surprised and delighted when dad asks his
daughter whether they're sleeping together and, when
Channe gives him an honest answer, is told that they might
as well sleep together under his roof rather than the back of a
car.  Bill Willis comes across every so often with strong
opinions such as one he holds against the Church.  When his
housemaid, the Portuguese-born Candida (Dominique Blanc)
refuses to marry Mamadou (Macha Meril) because at the age
of 40 she's "not ready for marriage," Willis chides the priests
for telling "the peasants" that they should wait for pie in the
sky when they die.  Barbara Hershey's Marcella shows her
intrepid side in throwing sand in the face of her young son's
French teacher, who customarily locks Benoit into the closet
for punishment.</P>
<P>   Leelee Sobieski turns in a remarkable performance as the
adolescent Channe, a classic presentation of a daughter's
unbridled affection for her father--as shown most poignantly
by her wish to be with him and not at a major party on New
Year's Eve when she hears that he may die within a year. 
Anthony Roth Costanzo is also noteworthy as a boldly artistic
isolate, that rare teenager who is absolutely gaga over opera
and is predictably shunned by his French contemporaries for
his sensitivity.</P>
<P>   Photographer Jean-Marc Fabre throws in a few sharply
etched scenes of Paris but does best in his filming the beauty
of New York's upscale Long Island communities.  More casual
than "The Bostonians," more restrained than "The Wild Party"
and even more poignant than "Roseland," the trilogy "A
Soldier's Daughter Never Cries" effectively portrays family
members split between two national cultures whose love for
one another transcends both their daily dilemmas and their
ultimate anguish.</P>
