                       A film review by Steve Kong
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Breakdown is a tense, tight and lean thriller.</P>
<P>To summarize the story in this review would ruin the movie for those who 
haven't seen it. But, I can, carefully, tell the premise without giving away 
the film. Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan play a married couple, Jeff and 
Amy Taylor. They are on a cross-country road trip in their new red Jeep Grand 
Cherokee. As Jeff is driving, out from nowhere swerves a pick-up truck and 
barely hits them. Jeff speeds up to put some distance between him and the 
pick-up truck. But at the next gas station, the guys in the pick-up truck meet 
up with Jeff. They exchange a few words and that's the end of that. At least 
that's what Jeff thinks. As he and Amy speed off from the gas station, they 
get so far and then the Jeep dies in the middle of the desert. They don't know 
what to do. And to make matters worse, the guys in the pick-up just past them, 
and are perched somewhat further up the road watching Jeff and Amy like 
vultures. That is until a good Samaritan 18-wheeler truck driver stops by and 
helps push the Jeep off to the side of the road. The 18-wheeler truck driver, 
played by J.T. Walsh, looks at the Jeep, but is unable to fix it. He then 
offers to drive Jeff and Amy to the next rest stop. Jeff wants to stay with 
the Jeep but Amy wants to go to the next stop to make a call to have a tow 
truck get the Jeep. So they split up. Jeff staying with the Jeep and Amy going 
off to the rest stop. Jeff quickly finds the problem to the Jeep and drives 
over to the rest stop to pick up Amy. But, she is not there. The owner has not 
seen her. Jeff, now frantic, drives around and spots the 18-wheeler. He forces 
the 18-wheeler to stop and questions the driver he says he doesn't know who 
Jeff is and has no idea what he is talking about. And it is here where the 
story goes full speed ahead.</P>
<P>There are enough twists and turns in this movie to make one's head spin. The 
collection of bad guys is more than enough. The movie takes a very basic 
approach to get the audience to follow along, and that is with the question, 
will Jeff find his wife? And it is this basic approach that gives the movie 
it's tense, tight and lean feel. Kurt Russell does a good job at portraying a 
desperate man with a strong want to find his lost wife. And worth mentioning 
is Basil Poledouris' haunting score to the film. The director and co-writer 
Jonathon Mostow does a good job at keeping the film moving and keeping our 
attention focused on Jeff's problem at hand.</P>
<P>Breakdown is a great thriller released in a slow season. If you have a chance 
to catch this film in the theatres, do so. If not, be sure to put this film on 
your video must-see list. </P>
