<PRE>                            AMERICAN PSYCHO
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a sharp-edged black comedy
          set in the Reagan era.  In the high profit but
          scruple-less, rarefied atmosphere of Wall Street
          finance, one corporate vice-president relieves the
          boredom with murder and sadism.  Nobody seems to
          notice.  That one joke is done excruciatingly well,
          but unfortunately that is the only joke the film
          has.  The soullessness of people at the top is
          hammered home again and again as they impassively
          commune and compete with each other in pristine
          dress and surroundings. Though Bale's acting and
          shifts of mood are impressive, basically this
          remains a one-joke comedy.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), +1
          (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It would seem that Ed Gein has inspired yet another film.  The
real Ed Gein was a retired Wisconsin farmer who in November 1957 was
discovered to be a serial killer.  He made a hobby of killing at least
fifteen women and eating or playing with the parts including wearing
the skin of his mother.  His crimes were the inspiration for the films
PSYCHO, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, and now AMERICAN PSYCHO.  To date
almost all serial killers have been portrayed on the screen as being
lower class or at best lower middle class.  AMERICAN PSYCHO asks, "What
if such a person were in Wall Street's high-earning elite?"  For the
purpose of satire, Bret Easton Ellis's controversial novel looked at a
wealthy young financier at a serial killer.  The intent is not so much
horror but as a satirical view into the lives of the rich, successful,
and vacuous.  Canadian Mary Harron, who scripted and directed I SHOT
ANDY WARHOL, has scripted and directed AMERICAN PSYCHO based on the
Ellis novel.</P>
<P>     As Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) readily admits to himself and
to the audience, he is empty.  Patrick Bateman is in most senses just
"not here."  Nobody greatly notices.  Bateman is one of a set of nearly
identical vice-presidents of a Wall Street financial firm.  He makes a
salary that is at least six figures and probably more.  He wears the
perfect suits, he eats in the best restaurants, and he comes close to
having the perfect business cards, though this is a field of great
competition among the vice-presidents.  Like the other vice-presidents
he does everything so perfectly that they are really impossible to
differentiate him from the others and themselves have problems telling
each other apart.  Bateman's one distinguishing characteristic is his
hobby of sado-masochism and murder.  If Patrick Bateman really did
inhabit his body he might have some feelings about the killing, but as
he sees himself as an empty shell he might as well enjoy the momentary
respite from total monotonous boredom.</P>
<P>     Much of the film is just a view into the wealthy lifestyle with
people who feel no human emotion but greed.  They go to absurd lengths
to get reservations at the finest restaurants but will return only to
those whose bathrooms that have the best facilities for snorting
cocaine.  Bateman takes the luxury a step further with a home gymnasium
where he can exercise to the strains of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and
pornographic movies.  Every once in a while he will do in a homeless
beggar or a co-worker.  At work he seems to do little real work beside
tell his secretary (Chloe Sevigny, Oscar-nominated for BOYS DON'T CRY)
what to wear.  He has a fiancee (Reese Witherspoon) and a mistress
(Samantha Mathis).  Both are very spacey though it is a little harder
to tell with the fiancee since her condition does not come from
chemicals.</P>
<P>     Christian Bale plays his role cool, making seamless shifts from
dapper to ripper.  But he seems really to enjoy his hobby of killing.
Reese Witherspoon has just a small part, but now every role she takes
reminds me of the high school prig she played in ELECTION.  Willem
Dafoe plays a police detective is the traditions of Columbo.</P>
<P>     It is curious how this film echoes other recent films.  Bateman's
descent from the rich and stylish into his netherworld of violence
resonates with a similar descent in EYES WIDE SHUT.  In this film
Bateman readily tells people that his hobby is murder, but people just
do not connect with him as we saw in GROSSE POINT BLANK and THE SIXTH
SENSE.  Bateman's money seems to go into entertainment gadgets, not
unlike the people we saw in BOILER ROOM.  One could even say that
Bateman's secret anti-social actions resound with THE FIGHT CLUB.</P>
<P>This is a film that makes a sharp, strong, but surprisingly simple
statement.  But perhaps the one statement is less than we should expect
for a feature-length film.  I rate this a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a
+1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
