<PRE>SOUND AND FURY
--------------</PRE>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Cochlear implants are bionic devices which feed sound waves to the brain's
auditory nerve.  When surgically implanted in young deaf children, the 
results can be amazing - a child deaf since birth can be speaking completely
normally within a couple of years.  Sound like a no-brainer of a medical
solution?  Director Josh Aronson's "Sound and Fury" documents the incredibly
complex arguments both for and against the device by following just one
family on Long Island, New York.</P>
<P>First we meet Peter Artinian, the deaf father of three deaf children.  He
states 'I'm happy being deaf.  It's very peaceful.'  Upon the birth of
each of his children he was happy to find they were 'just like me' and
his wife (their mother) Nina.</P>
<P>His hearing sister Mary and her husband are horrified to find that her
family's deafness has been inheritted by their son and are told about
cochlear implants.  They witness a five year old girl hearing and speaking
like a non-handicapped child two and a half years after receiving a cochlear
implant and are convinced that this is the way to go.  Peter is not only
incensed, he's very 'vocal' about it.  Then his eldest, Heather, expresses
interest in becoming a hearing child as well.  Family battle lines are
drawn for three generations.</P>
<P>While the advantages may be obvious, the surprise is that there are compelling
arguments made against the procedure, not the least of which is the
invasiveness of the surgery and device itself (it must be implanted within
the skull and is connected to the ear via a rather large plastic piece
plugged in behind the ear).  The nature of deaf culture is explored
as is the relationship between deaf/hearing parents and their deaf/hearing 
children.  The deaf adults even have some good comebacks when pressed on
the educational advantages of hearing.</P>
<P>The filmmakers use some ingenuity to showcase the argument.  We witness
the silence of deaf communication and then see a signed conversation that
is dubbed rather than subtitled to illustrate the difference between the
two worlds.  'Talking head' interviews begin with Peter Artinian and
are intercut with various family members in various groupings out in the
real world - gradually, more 'talking head' one-on-ones are added as the
arguments and their offshoots begin to take shape.  Irony is allowed to
speak for itself, such as when Heather says 'I don't want to sign, I
want to speak' - in sign.  Peter and Mary's deaf father makes some rather
arresting observations.  Things get really interesting when Peter's
wife Nina, begins to sway to the pro-implant side, even considering the
procedure for herself.</P>
<P>"Sound and Fury" is a provocative documentary that is sure to make its
audience consider things about deafness and handicaps in general that 
it might not otherwise.</P>
