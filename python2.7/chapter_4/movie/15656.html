<PRE>.                             HILARY AND JACKIE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     It's getting to the point where I've just seen enough movies about
crazy musicians and whacked-out siblings. HILARY AND JACKIE gives us
both(!), so if you haven't had your fill of these two genres, here's a
chance to knock both out at once.</P>
<P>     The true story of the Du Pre sisters, we get to see them grow up
and become famous musicians. Hilary (Griffiths) ends up opting out of
the limelight to raise kids and chickens in the country. Jackie (Watson)
goes all-out in her quest to be a solo cellist, and of course, she goes
totally bonkers before too long.</P>
<P>     The film meanders along, mainly following Jackie's psychosis and
later, her development of multiple sclerosis, from which she died at the
age of 42. The film is made in a bizarre style - the kids grow up
together, then the movie focuses on Hilary's life, then it backtracks
and tells us what happened to Jackie during the same period of time.
Obviously an attempt to (a) be clever, and (b) break away from typical
story structure, HILARY AND JACKIE ends up failing at the former, more
important, task. The movie ends up being repetitious and, frankly,
annoying by the time it's over.</P>
<P>     Still, Watson's performance and the ambition of the picture can't
be denied. The music sounds great in surround sound (I screened it on
video), and the cinematography is quite lush. Too bad it all doesn't
come together very well.</P>
