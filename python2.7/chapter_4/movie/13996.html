<PRE>THE AVENGERS (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>A few months ago I was ask by former director, now turned film critic, Alan
Smithee to be his backup advisor for the film The Avengers. The director,
Jeremiah S. Chechik, wanted to have a film critic on the set to advise him
what to do and what not to do. I found that Smithee was quite an ill man,
and therefore I found myself on the set of The Avengers more than expected.
This would have been great for a budding film critic like me, if it had not
been for a few problems.</P>
<P>Following is a script showing the few times that I was on the set of The
Avengers. All personalities are computer generated.</P>
<PRE>---
INT - CHECHIK'S OFFICE – DAY
Sitting in the room are: JEREMIAH S. CHECHIK and STEVE KONG.
Steve is FRANTICALLY flipping through a script. In walks
UMA THURMAN.</PRE>
<PRE>                THURMAN
        Nice office.</PRE>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        Thanks. Uma, I think you know why I
        wanted to meet with you. I want to
        cast you as Emma Peel, super-secret
        agent. You'll star in The Avengers,
        a remake of a classic TV show.</PRE>
<PRE>                THURMAN
        Sounds good. Who will I be working
        with?</PRE>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        Dunno yet. But, here's a large lump
        of cash.</PRE>
<P>Chechik hands over a large sum of money.</P>
<PRE>                THURMAN
        That's great. After my horrible
        performance in Batman and Robin,
        any movie should be good. Where do
        I sign?</PRE>
<P>Chechik hands over piece of paper and a pen. Thurman signs
and leaves the office. Steve is DISAPPOINTED that he wasn't
able to get an autograph.</P>
<PRE>A KNOCK.</PRE>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        Come!</PRE>
<P>In walks RALPH FIENNES. Fiennes takes a seat opposite Steve.</P>
<PRE>                STEVE
        I loved you in Strange Days!</PRE>
<PRE>                FIENNES
        Why thank you. Jerry, what's up?</PRE>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        I noticed you have been doing a
        lot of good work lately, like
        The English Patient and the
        forementioned Strange Days.
        Thought you might want
        to work in something with more
        fluff than dialogue.</PRE>
<PRE>                FIENNES
        Who will I be working with?</PRE>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        Uma Thurman.</PRE>
<PRE>                FIENNES
        Not sure if I'll have any onscreen
        chemistry with her. Wasn't she also in
        that horrible movie Batman and Robin?</PRE>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        She might have been. Here's a large
        sum of money. Is that enough?</PRE>
<P>Chechik hands over a large sum of money. Fiennes's eyes go WIDE.</P>
<PRE>                FIENNES
        Looks fine to me. Where do I sign?</PRE>
<P>Chechik hands over paper and pen. Fiennes signs and leaves. Another KNOCK.</P>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        Come!</PRE>
<P>In walks SEAN CONNERY. Steve stands up, SHAKES Connery's hands.</P>
<PRE>                STEVE
        You're…You're…You're…</PRE>
<PRE>                CONNERY
        Sean Connery.</PRE>
<PRE>                STEVE
        That you are.</PRE>
<PRE>                CONNERY
        Good to meet you, chap.</PRE>
<PRE>                STEVE
        My pleasure.</PRE>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        We need you in a skirt.  Then we need
        you in a teddy bear suit.  And finally
        we need you to really overact.  Here's
        a large sum of money.</PRE>
<P>Chechik hands over a large sum of money. Connery signs papers
and leaves.</P>
<PRE>                STEVE
        You didn't even consult me.</PRE>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        Later, chap, later.</PRE>
<P>EXT – AVENGERS'S SET – DAY
FIENNES, THURMAN, CONNERY, CHECHIK, and STEVE are on set. Steve
is sitting in his own chair. Fiennes, Thurman and Connery are on
set acting.</P>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        No! No! No! Ralph and Uma! You're
        acting! I don't want acting! I want
        you to be deadpan. I don't want
        chemistry either! Sean! What's wrong
        ole chap? I want more acting! Overacting!
        Now, let's do this take again!</PRE>
<PRE>                STEVE
        But, they were doing just fine. </PRE>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        Shush, chap. I'm the director.</PRE>
<PRE>                STEVE
        I'm here to advise, though.</PRE>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        Later, chap, later – Sean! Sean! Here's a
        few more dollars, I want overacting!</PRE>
<PRE>STEVE'S head hangs low.</PRE>
<P>INT – EDITING ROOM – DAY
CHECHIK, STEVE, and editor MICK AUDSLEY are at the editing console.</P>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        I want this movie short.</PRE>
<PRE>                AUDSLEY
        That's fine ol' chap.</PRE>
<PRE>                STEVE
        But, you shot all that footage. Some
        of it actually came out looking pretty
        good. And most of makes sense.</PRE>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        No, I want it short.</PRE>
<P>STEVE sighs. AUDSLEY begins to edit the film. </P>
<P>LATER – AUDSLEY is sitting back. STEVE and CHECHIK are viewing the
final cut of the film.</P>
<PRE>                STEVE
        None of this makes any sense! Sure,
        there is some good cinematography
        by Roger Pratt, but that's all lost
        to this horrible editing, bad acting,
        and loss of continuity!</PRE>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        Chap, this is the best film I've ever
        seen.</PRE>
<PRE>                STEVE
        This film stinks!</PRE>
<PRE>                CHECHIK
        Chap, here's a few hundred dollars.
        Write something good about the film.</PRE>
<PRE>                STEVE
        I will not take that money! And further
        more, don't credit me as an advisor for
        this film. This film is an absolute
        horror. I wouldn't recommend this film
        to anyone.  Everyone should skip this
        film! It looks gorgeous, but that's
        about all that's good about this movie.</PRE>
<P>Steve gets up and STORMS OUT of the editing room.</P>
<PRE>---
And that was my experience as a film critic/advisor.</PRE>
