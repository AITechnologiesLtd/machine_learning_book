<PRE>School's Better
Snowday</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Growing up in the north, I, too, longed for that prized announcement over
the early morning radio, "SNOWDAY, Schools are closed!!!" In its attempt to
recreate the elation a blizzard brings to children, "Snowday" slips and
slides all over itself.</P>
<P>Fundamentally a formula family picture, "Snowday" adds little to the four
story lines it borrows from countless other pictures. Each conflict
resolving wholesomely, but with little power.</P>
<P>In the primary saga, the teen son (Mark Webber) chases a beauty out of his
league while ignoring gal-pal Schuyler Fisk. A few endearingly unique
moments grace this tale, but for the most part, it evolves just as expected.</P>
<P>Next, the boy's little sister must conquer her demon -- the evil snowplow
man. Not only will he "steal" a second snowday by clearing the streets, but
he delights in mowing towards blissfully sledding children. The chains on
his tires are said to be made from "the braces of kids that didn't get out
of his way."</P>
<P>Thirdly, mom is a workaholic who ignores her family's needs. This plot line
pains viewers as she tends to the phone while family chaos ensues.</P>
<P>Lastly, dad Chevy Chase plays the town's second best weatherman. In order to
be free of gimmicky costumes meant to maintain his ratings, Chase must
snatch top guy status from his super slick rival. Chase's charm keeps this
subplot above ice water.</P>
<P>Strong music wisps with the magic of "E.T." and "Close Encounters"
desperately trying to make a snowman from this slush. But the visuals and
story, like it's poster, feel quickly cut out and pasted together by busy
people with other things on their minds.</P>
