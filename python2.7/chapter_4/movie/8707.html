<PRE>                            BRASSED OFF 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
            3 :-) :-) :-) for the plight of the human spirit</PRE>
<P>Cast: Pete Postlethwaite, Tara Fitzgerald, Ewan McGregor, Stephen
Thompkinson, Jim Carter. Screenplay: Mark Herman. Producer: Steve
Abbott. Director: Mark Herman.</P>
<P>When swamped by the sorrows of life, when day becomes night, and the
will to survive sinks with the burden of each breath, some of us will
sing, some of us will cry and some will blow their ‘flugel'. It's during
these times of turbid turmoil, when the power of music can for a brief
moment, lift us above the troubled waters which is bitter with despair.</P>
<P>This is the story of music and the struggle of the ordinary working man
to keep his job, support his family, and keep the passion for music
alive. In a small Yorkshire community the coal miners work by day and
play the music of ‘brass' by night. A shift of fortunes brings our
mining musicians to face the threat of mine closure, the end of their
livelihood and the dilemma of ‘how can we play music when there is no
food on the table.'</P>
<P>The director Mark Herman has nicely blended the music of ‘brass' with
the struggle of the human spirit. Sit and listen, and the two become
one, as the miner's plight is as much felt in the music they play as
seen on screen. When the corporate powers of the world attempts to bind
the fight of these men, we have the transformation of emotions into
music, which is the blend of ‘brass' and sorrow, and the creation of one
of the most powerfully moving yet lamented sweetness that is heard.</P>
<P>The ending may not be as triumphant as one would have hoped for, but for
a brief moment these few men soared the ‘high places' where most of us
only dream. Strong performances by Pete Postlethwaite as the Brass band
conductor dying of ‘Coal Miner's Lung', and good supports from Tara
Fitzgerald and Ewan McGregor.</P>
<P>Comment: On the seventh day the trumpets sounded and the Walls of
Jericho fell.</P>
