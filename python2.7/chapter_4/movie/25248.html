<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>I can remember watching "The Bullwinkle Show" when I was young -- it was 
in syndication by then, of course -- but I can't really say that I was a
big fan. It's hard to recall, but I think I found the primitive animation
somewhat off-putting, and I don't think I really caught on to the brand of
humor espoused by series creator Jay Ward. And Rocky's voice really got on
my nerves.</P>
<P>Nearly two decades later, I find my reviewing the characters' first
feature-length film, "The Adventures Of Rocky & Bullwinkle". Not only are
the title creatures back, but so are their Pottsylvanian arch-nemeses
Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader. Oh, and the Narrator. Rocky's voice
still bugs me a little, but I guess I've learned to accept it over the
years. If only that was the sole problem I had with this movie!</P>
<P>Unfortunately, "Adventures" has far deeper flaws than this, most of them 
stemming from this simple fact: movies are not just television on a bigger
screen. Although superficially similar, the two media are very different.
Story ideas which work well as an eight-minute cartoon short are often not
quite as successful as a ninety-five-minute big-budget film. But that's
what "Adventures" amounts to -- a movie which just takes a stock TV
plot, dresses it up with cornball "Rocky & Bullwinkle" humor, and does
nothing more to justify its existence. About the only nod to this being a
movie and not a TV episode are cameo appearances by big name stars 
(including Janeane Garofalo, Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg -- as Judge
Cameo, no less). But with the exception of John Goodman, who gets one good
line, these are all gratuitous and boring.</P>
<P>And it's a shame, because "Rocky & Bullwinkle" feels like it could have
been a much better movie. Certainly, it has moments of inspiration. Take
the opening scene, which is done in old-fashioned Ward animation style. We
revisit Frostbite Falls, home of Rocky and Bullwinkle. The town has been
stuck in reruns for the past thirty-five years (Bullwinkle gets a
residuals cheque for three-and-a-half cents) and the downtime has taken
its toll. Buildings have fallen into disrepair, the forest has been
clear-cut, and even the Narrator has been reduced to living with his
mother and narrating the events of his own dull life.</P>
<P>Within minutes, however, this inventive beginning gives way to scenes set
in the Real World, and "Adventures" never quite recovers. There is some
nice wordplay, and some lovely in-jokes (the medical facilities at 
Bullwinkle's alma mater, Wottsamotta U, are housed in "J" Ward). But it is
all trapped in a desperately routine plot, with obvious and prosaic 
moralising and -- most glaringly -- a lot of gags that just aren't funny.
Consider the riff on Robert De Niro's famous "Are you talkin' to me?"
scene from "Taxi Driver": it's so uncomfortably shoehorned into the movie
that watching him endure it made me cringe.</P>
<P>De Niro plays Fearless Leader who, along with Boris (Jason Alexander) and
Natasha (Rene Russo), has connived a way to escape into our world.
Fearless Leader has concocted a scheme to brainwash America using his own
cable network, RBTV (Really Bad Television). The FBI decides that the only
people who can stop the Pottsylvanians are Rocky and Bullwinkle (voiced by
June Foray, returning from the original cartoon, and Keith Scott), so they
send Agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) to find a way to extract the
animated duo from Frostbite Falls. Soon, the three heroes are en route to
New York City, with Boris and Natasha dogging their every step.</P>
<P>There are enough jokes about the many cliches littering "The Adventures Of 
Rocky & Bullwinkle" that I'm honestly not sure if the movie was written
this way on purpose, or if the jokes were added in afterward when the 
filmmakers realised that their script wasn't quite up to snuff. But 
recognising a problem and actually doing something about it are two
different things, and so although acknowledging some of the movie's less
logical developments (why are Boris, Natasha, and Fearless Leader "real"
but Rocky and Bullwinkle still animated?) results in some laughs, it 
doesn't make up for the movie's much larger problems.</P>
<P>Perhaps the biggest flaw is the character of Karen Sympathy. Newcomer
Perabo has a lot of charisma and does a pretty good job with the material
she's given, but the character's pairing with Rocky and Bullwinkle is
ill-advised at best. From her first appearance onward, there is no doubt
that Karen is a "Rocky & Bullwinkle" fangirl, and while the movie makes
some pretense of her trying to act gruff, the effort is thoroughly
transparent. As a result, the interaction between the three heroes is
mostly bland and uninteresting -- there is little conflict between them,
even of a good-natured variety. Things would have been a lot more dynamic
if Karen had been replaced with a genuinely tough-as-nails agent, like her
FBI superior (who does share a hilarious scene with Bullwinkle).</P>
<P>De Niro, Alexander and Russo do their cartoon-character impressions well,
albeit with little substance. Just count the minutes between Russo's
first appearance and her first line of dialogue not spoken in concert with
Alexander! Foray picks up where she left off with Rocky as if not a day
had passed, and Scott is an effective replacement for both Bullwinkle and
the Narrator (substituting for Bill Scott and William Conrad,
respectively).</P>
<P>But "The Adventures Of Rocky & Bullwinkle" is one of those movies that is
ill-conceived from beginning to end. Kids aren't likely to get a lot of
the jokes, and adults are bound to be bored silly by the storyline. It's
not a terrible film, and it's affable enough that I'm reluctant to give it
a failing grade, but you need to dig awfully hard to find the good stuff.
Sadly, this is yet another in a long line of TV-to-movie disappointments,
seemingly designed to leave you in your seat groaning, "Oh no, not again!"</P>
