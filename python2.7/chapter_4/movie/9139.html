<P>MARTIN (HACHE)
 By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.

 Cast: Federico Luppi, Juan Diego Botto, Eusebio Poncela,
Cecilia Roth
   Family dysfunction, drug abuse, suicide and other
pathologies are alive and well and living in Argentina...and
Spain, at least in the circles traveled by Martin (Federico
Luppi), a successful film director in Adolfo Aristarain's new
film.  "Martin (Hache)," which had a screening at the 1997
New York Film Festival, is a rather long work about a father
who is estranged or distant not only from his 19-year-old son
but from his best friend, wife, and lover as well.  In giving
another example of how money does not buy happiness or
even contentment for many who possess it, director Aristarain
has assembled a small cast with uneven acting skills, or at
any rate, one which is so dominated by the superior talent of
Mr. Luppi that the supporting performers have little to do but
overact or, in one case, come across as a near-zombie.
   The unusual title is actually the designation given to the
teenager who, like his dad, is named Martin (Juan Diego
Botto) officially, but Hache (Jay) for short.  He lives in the
Argentine capital with his mother, but the air he breathes is
not Bueno.  His mother wants him out.  His father lives
thousands of miles away in Madrid and has little contact with
him.  His 16-year-old girl friend who insists that she loves him
very much dumps him.  No wonder he is found in a coma,
near death from combining whiskey with "dog" (a canine
tranquilizer), and considered a victim of attempted suicide. 
Hearing the news, his dad has the decency to fly to Buenos
Aires where his estranged wife makes clear that she wants
the kid out of the house.  He takes the lad back to his fairly
lavish home in Madrid where Hache meets a homosexual
drug-taking actor Dante (Eusebio Poncela) and his dad's
much younger lover Alicia (Cecilia Roth).  Almost needless to
say, the kid does some growing up around such hip
characters and like Catherine Sloper in Henry James' novel
"Washington Square," he emerges a stronger individual--his
own person.
   "Martin (Hache) is so talky it makes Eric Rohmer's "Claire's
Knee" look like "Con Air."  Considering that the audience sits
through over two hours of neurotic and borderline psychotic
behavior, it's a bit much to ask the paying guests to put up
with a stream of yada yada yada, particularly when blended
with Cecilia Roth's, cocaine-induced hyper performance and
Eusebio Poncela's almost campy, pretentious palaver about
the meaning of life.  As Martin Senior, Mr. Luppi gives new
meaning to Greta Garbo's signature quote, "I vant to be
alone."  Verbally abusing his lovely and loving druggie girl
friend by insisting, in effect, that he prefers solitude to her
company, he drives her to a tragic end.  He alienates his best
friend, Dante, to such a degree that Dante can scarcely
believe the behind-the-scenes support given him by his
director pal, who has been asked to make a big-budget movie
without the acting services of Dante.  Martin does have
redeeming features, particularly the attention he know gives to
his suicidal son, who truthfully confesses that he loves to be
with his father.  But then again who wouldn't if he is taken to
Madrid's best restaurant, introduced to some of the world's
finest wine, and even administered to seductively by the
passionate Alicia?
   More attention should have been paid to the exterior
scenery.  Madrid is a lovely city and Buenos Aires probably
has its glories, but cameraman Porfirio Enriquez is restricted
largely to indoor photography as though "Martin (Hache)"
were a staged play.
   The most amusing scene shows Dante performing in a
show before an engrossed audience, suddenly cutting out of
character to show his utter contempt for the congregation
who, he advises, must feel good about themselves for
applauding a left-wing play but who then go home and
change nothing about their lives.  The folks in "Martin
(Hache)," by contrast, do make changes in their own lives
during the course of the movie, but except for one case, that
of the teen, the metamorphosis is too late. Not Rated.
