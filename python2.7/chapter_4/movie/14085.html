McCormack, Ryan Reynolds</PRE>
<P>   "The Alarmist" is filled with characters who delight in
mugging for the camera and in striking absurdist poses; and
why not?  The movie, which is based on a play by the
imaginative writer Keith Reddin, is an absurdist comedy.  Not
that's it's far-out like something by Ionesco or Beckett.  It's
quite accessible.  The first half is an absolute gem, but Even
Dunky, who adapts the staged work for the screen, cannot
sustain the momentum once the narrative turns serious, even
tragic.  He must be given credit for taking the risk: he
precariously walks the fine line between waggery and woe in
showing that life, despite its anguish, is well worth
living, and manages to send up capitalist shibboleths without
giving up the light touch.  While the con game played here will
bring to mind some treasures by David Mamet such as "The
Spanish Prisoner" and "Glengarry Glen Ross," "The Alarmist"
does not really have unique style like those major prizes. 
Its rewards are ample, however, making a trip to the movies a
worthwhile one.</P>
<P>   The con involved here does not involve selling a defective
product or any sort of fly-by-night scheme.  The commodity, a
security alarm system, works well, but considering its
price--which we do not unearth but which is apparently quite
high--it requires some creative selling. What is being sold is
not so much a security system for one-family homes as much
as fear.  If the clients can be persuaded that they need to
install the alarm setup despite a steadily declining crime rate
in the area, some hard sell is needed.  That's just what is
provided by Tommy Hudler (David Arquette), a naive young
man being trained for the job by Heinrich Grigoris (Stanley
Tucci), the leathery, cynical owner of the company.  The
comic highlight of the 93-minute story occurs near the
beginning as Heinrich carries through a sale in the home
office to a fearful woman, Sally (Mary McCormack), whose
husband is deadly ill and who cries voluminously, protests the
high cost of the system, but is persuaded to sign.  When
Tommy goes into the field, he proves to be an effective
merchant indeed, but what he did not count on was falling
instantly in love with an older woman, the widowed Gale
Ancona (Kate Capshaw), who has a precocious teenaged
son, Howard (Ryan Reynolds).  The comic gives way to the
cataclysmic as a double-murder leads Tommy to suspect his
boss. After all, he has discovered that his mentor makes most
of his income not on the product he sells but on the jewels
and cash he burgles, burglaries which keep the neighborhood
fearful and thereby increase sales.</P>
<P>   The film, particularly during its initial, better half, sustains a
theatrical feeling, with characters from widow Gale to Tommy
to Tommy's father Bruce Hudler (Louis Arquette) adopt
exaggerated facial expressions.  In the staged work, which
was performed in 1990 in New York prestigious off-Broadway
Manhattan Theatre Club, ghosts appear on the platform
including the phantom of the 16th Century Calvinist thinker,
John Calvin.  Concepts like sin and predesination were
explored there but dispensed with in debut director Dunsky's
filmed adaptation.  Stanley Tucci continues to amaze us with
his comic depth, striking clever poses in films like Woody
Allen's "Deconstructing Harry" and especially in his role as a
gourmet chef in one of the great indies of 1996, "Big Night." 
David Arquette is a convincing protege allowing Kate
Capshaw--as the older woman--to get her groove back in a
dazzling little love affair.  Uneven that this movie may be, it
conveys the humor and misery of life in a series of bright
vignettes which, for the most part do work, but do not quite
cohere.  The movie is, on the whole, a worthy first incursion
by Mr. Dunsky.</P>
