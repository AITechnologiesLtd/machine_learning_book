<P>    PHANTOMS is the new Dean Koontz crap-fest, about a remote Colorado
town where some 700 people have disappeared, save for a few things left
behind:  a body here, a body part there, a conspicuous pile of
"undigestibles" (buttons, watches, pacemakers, etc.) over in the corner.
Two sisters (Joanna Going and Rose McGowan) make the grim discovery,
after arriving in the empty town.  One's a doctor, so she suspects an
epidemic and they both begin poking around, instead of immediately
heading for the hills.  (They'd have to hoof it, though, as neither
theirs nor any other car around will start.) As night falls, they're
joined by the local law (Ben Affleck presiding) and they continue to
poke around, though now accompanied by periodic gunfire.  (They shoot at
stuff.) Later that evening, they're joined by a tabloid-employed, Army-
escorted expert on mass disappearances who happens to look exactly like
Peter O'Toole.  And they continue to poke around.  And more gunfire
happens.  And, soon, we begin to learn exactly who or what is menacing
the town and causing these actors to take themselves so seriously.</P>
<P>    Despite dim dialogue and even lousier lighting, the first half of
PHANTOMS *does* pull off a few well-wrought frights.  (My neck hairs
might've risen to the occasion, had I not been walking to and fro,
asking the management of the Cary Imperial about an audio problem that,
to these ears, sounded like a speaker with a blood- soaked blanket
thrown over it.) Things get scary in a different way in the second hour,
with cruddy CGI effects and increasingly insipid plotting.  (I liked the
sheriff's snap conclusions about the invading menace.  He's seen his
share of "Star Trek" episodes.) You'll yawn, you'll wince, but if you
walk out early, you'll miss Liev Schreiber's return.  (He first appears
as an intense deputy.  In later scenes, he's back, hamming it up as "one
of them.") Oh, and at the end, there *is* one huge, helluva hearty laugh
to be had, at O'Toole, standing in the snow and delivering a monologue
to... an open manhole.  Friends, now *that's* entertainment.  Directed
by Joe Chappelle (HALLOWEEN 6) and scripted by Koontz, from his 1983
novel.  (Rated "R"/95 min.)</P>
