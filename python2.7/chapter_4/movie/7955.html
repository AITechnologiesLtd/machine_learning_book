<PRE>                                NICK OF TIME
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 3 = good)
1996, R, 89 minutes [1 hour, 29 minutes]
[thriller]
starring: Johnny Depp (Gene Watson), Christopher Walken (Mr. Smith), Marsha
Mason (Gov. Eleanor Grant), Charles S. Dutton (Huey), written by Patrick
Sheane Duncan, produced and directed by John Badham.</P>
<P>"Nick Of Time" might not be the greatest film ever made but it is definitely
a landmark in filmmaking as it takes place in actual, real time. It does
become the standard thriller it is trying to avoid, but it's always
interesting and fun to watch.</P>
<P>Criminals tend to be pretty dumb in the movies, but here we get a conspiracy
to kill a governor through a brilliant method - by blackmailing a common
person into committing the act for them. The only problem here is that the
people who want to assassinate this person are nearly all the members of her
security force and even her husband.</P>
<P>Johnny Depp stars as Gene Watson, an accountant who is about to board a
train with his young daughter when he is stopped by who he believes to be
police. These people turn out to be terrorists of sorts who threaten to kill
him and his daughter if he doesn't assassinate Gov. Eleanor Grant (Mason) in
90 minutes. Their calculated and precise method of operation is impressive,
and shows achievement on behalf of the film's writer, Patrick Sheane Duncan
("Circle Of Friends," "Mr. Holland's Opus").</P>
<P>The immediate sense of shock and fear displayed by Depp is sympathetic,
especially considering how vile Walken is as Mr. Smith - the man constantly
watching him. Smith almost has a supernatural presence because everywhere
Watson turns he sees him and cannot avoid him. In a way this makes the story
a little too sensationalized, but it does enhance the chilling, suspenseful
mood.</P>
<P>In the course of an hour and a half, Watson goes from ordinary John Doe to
Batman. The clock is constantly ticking and his mind is racing. If he kills
the governor he will probably be killed too, but if he doesn't he and his
daughter will both be killed. It's a no-win situation, but somehow Watson
keeps his cool.</P>
<P>Watson puts together a mini-conspiracy of his own, as he befriends Huey
(Dutton), a brave shoe-shine man, along with threatening one of Gov. Grant's
top aides, and even confronting the governor himself. All of the individual
scenes are quickly paced and detailed, and surprisingly enough, I didn't find
myself doubting the credibility.</P>
<P>Still, "Nick Of Time" is a good, solid movie that is unlike anything I've
seen in a long time. It's not the most realistic story, but it works for what
it is. Maybe it does become a bit cliche, but its overall originality and
actual breakdown work fine. </P>
