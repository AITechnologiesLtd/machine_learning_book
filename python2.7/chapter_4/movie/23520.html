<PRE>My Dog Skip (2000)</PRE>
<P>Jay Russell's MY DOG SKIP is a charming small film for family members of all 
ages, but it is no HUCKLEBERRY FINN.</P>
<P>We see images of Mark Twain's masterwork in several segments of SKIP.  It 
appears behind the opening credits, in shots of period objects - furnishings 
from kids' rooms of the 1920's and '30's.  Then the protagonist Willie 
Morris (Frankie Muniz) receives a hardback copy from his grandfather.  
Mostly the filmmaker crafts images that are supposed to be from a lost age 
in America - shots you might find in a catalog from a Norman Rockwell show.  
In one sequence, Willie and his Becky Thatcher-like friend Rivers Applewhite 
(Caitlin Wachs) tramp along a path, and later they paddle down a sleepy 
creek in a canoe.  It doesn't matter that the film is set during the Second 
World War, almost 60 years after HUCK FINN was published.  Russell is out to 
evoke a mood of nostalgia, an emotional tone of innocence mixed with 
virtually any genuine American ethic you can think of: hard work, 
independence, freedom, and so on.</P>
<P>The only problem is, these elements combine to create a batch of clichés, 
and they end up taking undue attention from the plot elements that are 
trying their hardest to hang together as a story.  Even the set decoration 
is overdone, from the vintage baseball and football gear to the product 
advertisements cluttering the main street or painted on brick walls.  The 
actors playing the parents of Willie's hero, next-door neighbor Dink Jenkins 
(Luke Wilson), are shown pausing (a real Rockwell moment) after they hang a 
small service banner from the porch ceiling.  (Weren't these star flags hung 
in windows, by the way?)  It may have been more appropriate to suggest a 
hint of the '40's, instead of flavoring the film so strongly.</P>
<P>The coming-of-age story is good enough.  Loner Willie's only guests at his 
birthday party are elderly relatives and his own parents.  Against her 
husband's wishes, Mrs. Morris (Diane Lane) gives Willie a dog, an "only dog" 
for an only child.  What follows is a series of episodes typical of growing 
up stories.  We watch Willie in various stages of happiness and sadness in 
the town of Yazoo, Mississippi.  At times both Willie and his pooch fall 
into jeopardy - scenes mainly involving a couple of bootleggers hiding their 
hooch in a cemetery.  These scenes are also reminiscent of Twain: Tom Sawyer 
this time.  And the head bootlegger Junior might be compared to either Injun 
Joe or Huck's Pap.</P>
<P>The boy-and-his-dog story is engaging.  Frankie Muniz (from the television 
series "Malcolm in the Middle") is a pleasant discovery, his face expressive 
and boyish enough to play a few years younger than his actual age.  Muniz 
has a way of crinkling his smallish mouth to show anger or frustration, and 
he's also convincing in his onscreen crying.</P>
<P>His dog - the title character - is played by the Jack Russell terrier Moose, 
who also portrays the rascally Eddie on the t.v. show "Frasier."  Excepting 
the brief shots in which you can see Moose staring off-camera at his 
trainer, this dog is wonderfully photogenic and clever.  And he seems to 
have a true bond with Willie.  He's the reason the film tips the scales more 
toward success than failure.</P>
<P>Willie has three enemies that become friends, and unfortunately these boys 
do not act their roles as comfortably as many other child actors would.  
Perhaps this is also a result of stereotypical characterization:  the dim 
follower, the dirty towheaded sidekick, the suspender-wearing, loutish 
bully.  None of these young actors can match Muniz's air of ease.</P>
<P>As Willie's father, Kevin Bacon tries valiantly to be a gruff but loving 
presence.  His character lost his lower leg in combat in the Spanish Civil 
War, and now rides out his work life as an accountant, hiding his injury 
behind a desk.  A small snag is that Bacon is not as old as the character 
he's playing, and he does not display a convincing Mississippi accent.  
(Most characters don't, if you want the truth, with the possible exception 
of Rivers.)</P>
<P>It's admirable that one of the film's agendas is to promote tolerance.  
Willie talks briefly with an African-American boy, who brags about a black 
athlete named Waldo Grace in the same way Willie brags about Dink Jenkins.  
We see blacks occupying the balcony seats in the town movie palace, and 
black families sitting around their part of town; at the end we even spot 
Willie and his friends watching Grace pitch and hit the horsehide at the 
Negro ball ground.</P>
<P>MY DOG SKIP is a mixed bag of pleasures and conventions.  I would recommend 
it for both children and adults, though adults may find a few of its minutes 
taken up by sentimentality.  It's worthwhile for its PG rating as well: my 
11 year-old daughter liked the scenes featuring Willie and Rivers (or should 
I say Huck and Becky, or even Forrest and Jenny?)</P>
