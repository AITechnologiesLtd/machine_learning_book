<PRE>"The Dish"</PRE>
<P>The manned landing on the moon on July 20, 1969, was the first, truly
worldwide media event ever. 600 million people watched in awe when they saw
and heard Neil Armstrong say, "That's one small step for man and one giant
leap for mankind." What few of those viewers knew is that a remote
Australian radio telescope team was responsible for those historic images
and their story is told in "The Dish."</P>
<P>Director Rob Stitch, whose earlier comedy, the wonderful and goofy "The
Castle," takes a different trail with this true-life story of the
Australia's contribution in making possible for millions to actually see
one of man's greatest accomplishments. The action takes place in the small
town of Parkes, New South Wales, Australia where sheep are the main
industry and the skyline is filled with the giant radio telescope called,
simply, the Dish. The advent of America's mission to land a man on the moon
brought the power of the Dish to the attention of NASA and an official
request for help was made to the Aussies.</P>
<P>Cliff Buxton (Sam Neill) is the director of the Dish project, but the
worldwide visibility of the moon mission prompts NASA to send their own man
to take over the show. Al Burnett (Patrick Warburton) is a high-powered
NASA tech sent on site to assume command of  the Australian operation and
is resented by the local technicians as a know-it-all interloper. As the
Apollo 11 launch date approaches, tension run high at the dish site.
Personal conflicts seem destined to overwhelm the important space mission.
Then, real disaster strikes!</P>
<P>An unexpected power outage in the town also hits the Dish station. One
problem mounts on the next when the backup generator fails to kick in. It
is discovered that Burton's main opponent, Mitch, forgot to prime the fuel
pump, causing all the computers to lose their programs and, most
importantly, the coordinates of the Apollo 11 spacecraft. The crisis unites
the team, Aussie and Yank alike, and they work hard together to make things
right - after blatantly lying to NASA about their problem. When the time
does comes for the first link with the astronauts, the plucky team of
astronomers overcome monumental challenges to fulfill their own mission to
the world.</P>
<P>As the landing approaches, NASA decides that the Parkes dish will be in the
best position to receive the first televised images from the moon. But,
things get even more complicated when high winds suddenly whip the area and
threaten to stop the Dish and its crew from accomplishing their own special
task for posterity. It's science's chance to be daring and the telescope
team is ready to risk it all to give the people of the earth their first
glimpse of the first moon landing.</P>
<P>Helmer Stitch works with many of the same folk that made "The Castle" such
a charmer. Where the earlier film used comedy to tell a quasi-serious
serious story of a man saving his home from ruthless developers, "The Dish"
takes a real, historical event and tells the story in a straightforward
fashion. What keeps the film from being just a docudrama is the keen wit
and humor that underlies the serious subject. Besides the Dish folk and the
government mucky-mucks that descend upon the station are the oddball
characters that live in the town of Parkes.</P>
<P>The large ensemble cast breaths life into the characters of the town and
dish station, making Parkes the kind of place you'd like to visit some
time. The crew  members of the Dish, led by Neill, are real people with
real hopes and dreams. They are proud of their abilities and talents and
come across as a true team. Roy Billing, as Parkes' mayor Bob McIntyre, is
politically ambitious and sees the big event as his chance at the big
times. He, his wife May (Genevieve Moy) and military academy-attending son
Billy (Carl Snell) lead the sometimes quirky townsfolk in their celebration
of the town's involvement in the great event. Tayler Kane, as the Dish's
goofy security guard Rudi Kellerman, get the most outright guffaws with his
not-quite-with-it perf.</P>
<P>The on-site locations and solid cinematography by Graeme Wood give the film
a majestic look of man's technical capabilities. Amazing detail is given to
the production design, by Carrie Kennedy, capturing the 60's period feel
and look - especially of the now-archaic computer equipment that was
state-of-the-art at the time. We're so used to super fast computers and the
internet, it's nice to get a realistic glimpse of where all our modern
technology came from.</P>
<P>The goofy comedy that is liberally sprinkled throughout the film is
represented in a single scene where the local band is requested to play the
American national anthem for the visiting US ambassador (John McMartin). I
won't spoil the gag, but the tune they play definitely ain't The
Star-Spangled Banner.</P>
<P>The Aussie humor may not hit home ever time for American viewers of "The
Dish," but the sincerity and warmth given to the telling of such a
momentous event will appeal to everyone everywhere. I can't wait to see
what Rob Stitch and company will come up with next. I give it a B+.</P>
