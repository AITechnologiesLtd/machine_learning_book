<P>Have you ever seen a film that could possibly have been successful, but was 
basically ruined due to an ad campaign that gave away literally every secret 
the picture has to offer? It's a common occurrence, but never before has a 
trailer blatantly spoiled a film the way Paramount's ads for "Double 
Jeopardy" do. If you are able to disregard this almost-fatal flaw, you will 
find that the film really is a highly servicable thriller, full of fine 
performances and blessed with brisk pacing that consistently saves the film 
from ever becoming tedious. While you watch "Double Jeopardy," you enjoy it, 
but even if the ad campaign hadn't given away every secret, it still would 
have been rather predictable, and ultimately can't escape its formulaic 
plotting.</P>
<P>Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd) has it all; a generous, caring relationship with 
her husband, Nick (Bruce Greenwood); a cheerful 4-year-old son; a love for 
sailing; and a beautiful, lakeside home in the northeast. While spending the 
night together on the boat Nick just bought for Libby, she awakens to 
discover she, as well as the boat, is covered in blood, and her husband is 
missing. The sea-rescue squad catches her holding the knife she has just 
found on the deck, and when Nick's body is never recovered, Libby finds 
herself facing serious time behind bars, and before long, is sentenced to a 
9-year prison term. Heartbroken that she has to be separated from her son, 
who is thus adopted by her best friend, Angela (Annabeth Gish), Libby decides 
to make the best of her time there, becoming friends with some of her fellow 
inmates and working out a lot. Then, to her horror, Angela and her son 
disappear for a month, but she is able to track them down by a telephone 
operator, where they are now staying in San Francisco. To make a long story 
short, Libby overhears her son on the phone exclaim, "Daddy!" and all of a 
sudden, she realizes that she was intentionally framed for the "murder" by 
her husband himself. A former lawyer and matter-of-fact cellmate (Roma 
Maffia) explains to Libby about a process called Double Jeopardy, in which a 
person cannot be convicted of the same crime twice. So if, say, Libby wanted 
to actually murder him once she's released, she could, and there's nothing 
anyone could do about it. </P>
<P>Switch to six years later, Libby is granted a three-year parole, and is sent 
to live at a community house for recently-released convicts, run by the 
flawed parole officer Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones), who supposedly was in 
a car accident years before that killed his wife and daughter. Since then, 
Travis hasn't been able to lay off the alcohol, but he does catch on rather 
quickly to Libby's ulterior motives, and attempts to stop her when she 
escapes from his custody.</P>
<P>You know, I may have given away quite a few of the major plot points, but 
they were also all discussed in the theatrical trailer. And you know what 
else? The trailer also had the shameless nerve to unravel even more of the 
story, right up to the climax in New Orleans, with Libby holding the gun at 
Nick, only for it to go off. After watching a 2 1/2-minute cliffs notes 
version of the 106-minute film, one wonders why anyone would even be 
interested in spending their hard-earned money on something that they already 
know the outcome of, but judging from the fairly-packed theater last night, 
it didn't stop any of them.</P>
<P>Beginning with a painfully obvious 15-minute prologue in which the "murder" 
takes place, I sat back in my seat, expecting to suffer through the remainder 
of a film that had "Mainstream Hollywood" written all over it. Once Libby is 
sent to prison, however, "Double Jeopardy" quickly improves, due in large 
part to Ashley Judd's superb, touching performance, as a woman who, in a 
moment's time, finds her whole happy existence seriously altered. With an 
acting career that began with her best-ever work in Victor Nunez's small 1993 
masterpiece, "Ruby in Paradise," Judd has followed this up with some 
disappointing commercial projects (1997's "Kiss the Girls") that have 
nonetheless helped to buoy her star potential, and has wisely intermixed 
these with more independent efforts (1997's "The Locusts," 1998's "Simon 
Birch"). "Double Jeopardy" belongs squarely in the commercial category, but 
that doesn't keep Judd from creating a believable, strong-willed character 
that we easily root for.</P>
<P>Tommy Lee Jones, in a role that is nearly a carbon copy of everything he has 
appeared in in the last six years (save for maybe 1995's "Batman Forever"), 
manages to pull off a strong performance that is more satisfyingly-written 
than most of his other recent efforts. While his character, like the film 
itself, is an utter cliche (the troubled, alcoholic man who finally comes to 
terms with his past mistakes), Jones sparks it with more life than there 
might have been had a lesser actor been cast in the part.</P>
<P>It makes you wonder, though. Would I have thought more highly of "Double 
Jeopardy" if, going into it, I knew nothing about it? There would have 
definitely been some extra surprises that most likely would have been 
unpredictable, and I probably would have found the premise more ingenious. 
Despite this, the film really is needlessly implausible on the basic story 
level, and the climactic showdown resorts to that reliable struggle scene 
that ends with a gun going off and killing one of the characters. But which 
one? I'll give you a hint: there's no way Paramount would have allowed the 
picture not to have a happy ending in which Libby and her son reunite. With 
all of the film's virtues and flaws weighed equally, let's just called 
"Double Jeopardy" a near-recommendation: a well-made thriller, to be sure, 
but just about as banal as they come.</P>
