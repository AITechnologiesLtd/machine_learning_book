SALON KITTY
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>In 1970s, many European intellectuals, especially those on
the left political hemisphere, became obsessed with the rise
of Fascism. Which wasn't so hard to expect, because the
social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed
to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies. In
such times, when political involvement could be associated
with noble passion, many filmmakers tried to warn the
present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the
look of pre-war Europe and circumstances that led to
phenomena like fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Of course,
there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other,
less noble reasons. For them, moral depravity of Fascism
could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing
sexual depravity of those era. Which, naturally, made some
of those films very popular among teen audience.</P>
<P>One of such filmmakers was Italian director Tinto Brass, who
later made career shooting expensive, stylish soft porn.
SALON KITTY, his 1976 film, is very losely based on the
novel by Peter Nordern, book that deals with bizarre yet
true story that took place in the first years of WW2. In
1939, Walter Schellenberg, one of the heads of Nazi
intelligence service has set up the elite, exclusive brothel
in Berlin with clientele comprised of top Nazi officials and
foreign diplomats. None of the customers knew that the girls
were all Nazi agents, and that all the rooms happened to be
bugged. The most bizarre thing is the fact that not even
Kitty, nominal madame of the brothel, didn't know the real
purpose of that enterprise.</P>
<P>Screenplay by Tinto Brass, of course, simplifies the story
and changes few names. Schellenberg is now Wallenberg
(Helmut Berger), ambitious Nazi official who wants to use
the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top. Kitty
Kellerman (Ingrid Thulin), apart from being madam, has a
second job as a cabaret singer. Caught in the net of
depravity is sweet, innocent girl Margerithe (Theresa Ann
Savoy) thrown into brothel. There she falls in love with
customer Hans Reiter (Bekim Fehmiu), disenchanted pilot of
Luftwaffe. When Margerithe discovers that her lover had been
executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel, she
finds out that the place is bugged. She informs the madam of
the real situation, and both women decide to confront
Wallenberg.</P>
<P>Those who tend to bash Benigni for exploiting Holocaust as
the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this
film, that uses the darkest pages of European history for
cheap sexploitation. But, although SALON KITTY doesn't
happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and
expensive soft porn (although not very successful; some of
supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing), it does try
to have more multidimensional characters and even something
resembling dramatic conflict - this time between
power-hungry and scruples Wallenberg and hedonistic
womanhood symbolised by Kitty. Unfortunately, Brass seems to
overuse other cinematical references, probably thinking that
he could repeat the successful interaction of Berger and
Thulin in Luchino Visconti's THE DAMNED, but the most
noticeable and irritating is Ingrid Thulin's unsuccessful
attempt to imitate Lisa Minelli's musical numbers from
CABARET. All in all, SALON KITTY is failure, although with
some very interesting moments.</P>
