<P>   I'm envious.  Here's why.  I taught high school kids for over
thirty years in much the way that the guy in Akira Kurosawa's
thirtieth and final movie taught in college.  Never once did the
pupils ever stand at attention when I entered the room. 
Occasionally when the bell ran concluding the final class, a
couple of youngsters would come up to shake my hand, but
usually they just walked right through me to their next class. 
They never built a house for me and they never helped me
look for a lost cat. (OK, I never had a cat, just a dog, and he
never got lost.)  You think all this is too much to ask?  Not if
you see "Madadayo," a reflection based on the life of an
actual professor who became a noted writer in Japan after his
retirement and who was virtually worshipped by his loving
students and later by the students' children and even their
grandchildren.  </P>
<P>   But if the name "Kurosawa" is synonymous in your mind
with some cool battle scenes (think "Ran") you're in for a
surprise.  This man, whom Roger Ebert called in 1993 "the
greatest living director," has often proven himself capable of
knocking out films on a wealth of themes.  (Kurosawa had
since died at the age of 88.)</P>
<P>   "Madadayo" means "not yet" in Japanese and is an
expression used as repeatedly in this absorbing film as "you
know" is used in Gen-X-targeted movies produced by
Hollywood.  "Madadayo" is a reflection on aging and
friendship, two of life's major themes--though the former is
not the sort of focus that most of us have taken in during our
moviegoing days.  While it deals, as stated above, with the
life of a real person named Hyakken Uchida--and, by the
way, one that could remind film buffs in America of John
Ford's "The Long Gray Line"--this story stretches over a
period of seventeen years in the life of the teacher, beginning
during the war years in 1943.  </P>
<P>  Uchida, called simply "professor" or "sensei" throughout the
tale, opens the movie by entering a room filled with highly
disciplined male college students, calling them to attention,
ordering them to bow, and then employing the sense of
humor that permeates the film he announces that he will
retire to spend his twilight years writing books.  Some of his
students soon go to his small house to converse and share
saki and tea with him, but when the house is destroyed by B-
29's in an air raid, the students proceed to build him a larger
place to live.  In addition to the professor's meeting with his
favorite students, he is feted each year on his birthday right
to the age of 77 at a catered affair, obviously a function
showing the material success of the men.  Though there is
little physical action in the movie--for example Kurosawa
would not think of showing you an actual bombing raid since
his aim is a contemplation of aging with its expectation of
death--one incident is particularly poignant.  When the
teacher's cat Nora disappears, the man is broken up.  He
cannot eat or sleep, cries most of the day, and eventually he
and his students go all-out to locate the truant feline.</P>
<P>   For a story on such a sober theme, there is considerable
good cheer and humor throughout. For example early on, told
that his small house had under previous tenancies been the
source of burglaries, the professor puts up signs saying
"Burglar's Passage," "Burglar's Recess Area" and "Burglar's
Exit" to the laugh-out-loud amusement of his favorite ex-
students Takayama (Hisashi Igawa) and Amaki (George
Tokoro), who pretend one night to be burglars simply to see
whether the place has been secured.</P>
<P>  This picture will be looked at with affection by all
moviegoers who have had heroes like this gentle and witty
man and should result in many leaving the auditorium after
the screening with broad smiles on their faces--as the director
specifically hoped that they would.  The film is warm,
whimsical, tender, and genuinely heartfelt.</P>
<P>Not Rated.  Running time: 134 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
