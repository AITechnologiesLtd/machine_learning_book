<PRE>The Faculty
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Elijah Wood; Jordana Brewster; Clea Duvall; Laura Harris & Josh
Hartnett
When I went into The Faculty I was expecting a typical teen horror flick. I
figured it may be a bit above average considering that Kevin Williamson
(Scream, Scream 2) had written the screenplay. My theory was that if
Williamson was involved, at the very least this movie was going to be
entertaining. Not only was the movie entertaining, but Williamson has proven
once again that he is one of the most gifted writers in Hollywood. Add to
that Robert Rodriguez' great job in the director's chair and you have the
makings of a pretty good film. When you throw in a great young cast, you
have a winner.</P>
<P>Elijah Wood plays the school whipping post, who works at the school
newspaper with the head cheerleader (Jordana Brewster). In the course of
looking for leads for a new story, they discover an even bigger one. Their
teachers have been taken over by aliens, which are rapidly taking over the
rest of the school. It then falls to them and four of their classmates, the
only six people left in the school unaffected, to find a way to stop the
aliens before they can take over the world. OK, it sounds a little corny,
but it actually comes off pretty well. There is never any real point at
which you start saying to yourself "As if that would happen". Of course, you
have to get by the whole alien invasion thing. After gettting passed that,
you are home free.</P>
<P>In terms of casting, The Faculty is fairly impressive. To make up for the
relatively unknown, but extremely talented cast of high school students, the
producers decided to cast some familiar faces in the roles of the faculty.
They include Robert Patrick (the liquid terminator in Terminator 2), the
high school principal is Bebe Neuwirth (Cheers), and the school nurse is
Salma Hayek. (I'm betting every guy in that school gets sick at least once a
week.) If Salma weren't enough, adding to the babe factor is Famke Janssen
(Goldeneye). Among the young cast of students is only a couple of
recognizable names, they are Josh Hartnett (who played Jamie Lee Curtis' son
in Halloween: H20) and Elijah Wood (Free Willie). Singer Usher also makes a
brief appearance in a small role. Adding some heat to the younger generation
are up a coming hotties Jordana Brewster and Laura Harris. I enjoyed the
performances of the whole cast. Of course, this is a horror movie and not
Shakespeare, so nobody was really stretching their acting talents to the
limit. As horror movie casts go, this one was fun to watch.</P>
<P>Unlike the early slasher type films of the late seventies and eighties, The
Faculty actually had a production budget and it shows. This film wasn't shot
on any shoestring budget, nor where the special effects cooked up in
somebody's garage. The Faculty lives up to the high production values that
were set by Scream a few years ago. So it's no coincidence that Kevin
Williamson was involved in both films. Maybe it even raises the bar a bit.
Considering that this was a movie about aliens, visual effects are a little
more important.</P>
<P>It's a great movie. Although, parents should be warned -- The Faculty is not
for the kids, even though it seems to be marketed towards them.</P>
