<PRE>                             A LITTLE PRINCESS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A World War I vintage children's book
          by the author of THE SECRET GARDEN is given a very
          nice production.  Unfortunately, there is good
          reason why they don't write children's stories like
          this any more.  How the virtuous young heroine's
          kindness and bad luck gets her into trouble is a
          lot more believable than how she gets out.  Still,
          this is a well-crafted film and one that adults can
          appreciate as much as children.  Rating: low +1 (-4
          to +4)</PRE>
<P>     In 1993 Warner Brothers scored a coup with the critics for their
adaptation of THE SECRET GARDEN by Frances Hodgson Burnett.  That wasa
cloyingly sweet if unconvincing moral tale for children.  Perhaps
sensing the mood of the country is moving back to the same sort of
sympathies it had at that time, Warner Brothers is again adapting one
of Burnett's stories, this one--A LITTLE PRINCESS--has been done twice
before, once with Mary Pickford in 1917 and again with Shirley Temple
in 1939.  I will say at the outset that this is not the kind of story
that does much for me,  It is not that I do not like children's films,
but Caroline Thompson's excellent BLACK BEAUTY is much closer to what
would appeal to me.  In spite of the fact that that film is a story
told by a horse, I found it far more touching and believable than this
exaggerated and contrived tale.  A far better treatment of similar
themes was in another example of a better children's film THE JOURNEY
OF NATTY GANN.</P>
<P>     As with THE SECRET GARDEN, this film opens with a young girl
brought up in India but having to return to her native country.  In
this case it is imaginative Sara Crewe (Liesel Matthews) who loves the
tales she has been told from the Ramayana.  But it is 1914 and called
to war is Sara's widower father (Liam Cunningham, who also plays the
blue-skinned Prince Rama in the too few dramatized sequences from the
Ramayana).  Sara is placed in Minchin School for Girls in New York.
The school is ruled over by the very repressed and autocratic Miss
Minchin (Eleanor Bron, veteran of films going back to the great
BEDAZZLED).  Minchin is clearly jealous of the advantages that wealth
has brought Sara.  But the audience knows that Sara's popularity is the
result of her story-telling ability which she uses to enliven the lives
of the other students.  Sara believes that a happy fantasy is better
than a grim reality.  When Sara's fortunes are reversed, however, Miss
Minchin is quick to turn Sara from a pampered student into a cruelly
used slave.  Sara is forced to give up her studies and work in the
school instead.  Still Sara has the ability to make and keep friends
including the other girls at the school and (from across the way) the
enigmatic Indian servant Ram Dass (Errol Sitahol) and his monkey
called--what else?--Hanuman, after the king of monkeys from the
Ramayana.</P>
<P>     Top billing goes to Eleanor Bron with a Frankensteinian shock of
gray hair.  Second billing goes to Liam Cunningham as the slightly too
good to be true father.  Liesel Matthews, who carries the film, must be
content with third billing because she is a child and a newcomer.
Almost all to the other cast members are unfamiliar, but the acting is
uniformly good.</P>
<P>     A LITTLE PRINCESS, like THE SECRET GARDEN, wants to be a moral
tale but falls more into the realm of kiddie film noir.  It is not her
virtue that saves Sara.  Coincidence is what saves her.  And her
virtues are a big part of what gets her into the trouble in the first
place.  The film does, to its credit, show some of the value of
imagination.  The villainous Miss Minchin is trying to eradicate any
imagination from her girls.  Yet it is the escape that comes from the
imagination that the girls really need.  This would be a very
interesting film to see paired with Peter Jackson's HEAVENLY CREATURES.</P>
<P>     Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron gives the film a nice feel for a
New York girls' school of the time (though actually the novel was set
in an English girls' school).  His film most comes alive when he is
portraying scenes from the Ramayana and he seriously might consider
lengthier dramatizations of that epic work.  He gets some details
wrong.  My wife noticed that his map of World War I Europe included a
Yugoslavia that would not come into existence until after the war.  His
depiction of gas warfare might be strong stuff for children if they
really understood what they were seeing.</P>
<P>     But the biggest fault is this.  A LITTLE PRINCESS is a superbly
contrived story in which a young girl seems destined to be badly
punished for being intelligent and imaginative.  Then the extremely
unsubtle hand of the author reaches out and saves the poor girl at the
last possible moment by a series of unconvincing and nearly impossible
coincidences.  There is little doubt that in the real world Sara would
not have been so fortunate.  Boy, am I glad I didn't read this one when
I was young and impressionable.</P>
<P>     I am afraid that I am just not destined to like any film based on
Frances Hodgson Burnett books.  This was only a little better than THE
SECRET GARDEN and I give it a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
