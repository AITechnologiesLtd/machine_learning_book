<PRE>_Slam_ (R) **** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Marc Levin's _Slam_ is a powder keg of a movie, exploding with emotional
honesty and truth and the exuberant passion of raw young talent.  It is an
uplifting and exhilarating experience, a powerful work that deservedly won
the Grand Jury Prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival.</P>
<P>Newcomer Saul Williams plays Ray Joshua, a talented Washington, D.C.
rapper/poet whose dealings in the drug biz land him in jail.  There, given
the choice of falling into the trap of violence or hone his gift, Ray
chooses the latter, and with the help and love of prison writing teacher
Lauren Bell (Sonja Sohn), he discovers the transcendent power of his words.</P>
<P>The "finding oneself through art" premise isn't entirely original, but
what makes _Slam_ such a triumph is the freshness of its voice.  The first
scene where Ray "slams," with the help of an inmate (Momulu Stewart) in the
next cell, is dazzling in its sheer energy and percussive force.  "Force"
can also be used to describe Williams and Sohn, who are not only talented
poets but charismatic screen presences and extraordinary actors.  The two
are downright electrifying; one highly charged confrontation in which she
tries to convince him to own up to his past mistakes packs an overwhelming
emotional potency.  The same can be said of the entire film, which Williams
has called--and rightfully so--"more of a movement than a movie."  (opens
