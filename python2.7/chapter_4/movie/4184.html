<PRE>                            THE SCARLET LETTER
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     It takes a lot of chutzpah (nerve) to take a classic book and
change the story around, including the ending.  Hawthorne, wherever he
is, must be seething.  Hollywood has done it again.  If you read the
book you will not believe the ending that was slapped onto the film.
Should anyone care, the screenplay was written by Douglas Day Stewart,
produced and directed by Roland Joff.</P>
<P>     If you read the book, beautifully written, many years ago, you may
want a refresher.  It takes place in the early 1700s when the Puritans
in Massachusetts ruled the colony with a strictness that took any joy
out of life.  As well, superstition and witches were prevalent.  The
story opens with a description of the Boston prison, the women
parishioners, in particular, outside the prison, a mean and vindictive
lot, who are angry at the light sentence given Hester Prynne (Demi
Moore), in the jail for adultery. After months of imprisonment she is
sentenced to wear the scarlet letter "A" for the rest of her life so
everyone would know her as an adulteress, a pregnant adulteress who
would not name the father of the child she was bearing.</P>
<P>     How she bears her punishment, how she earns her living are
described in the book but not in the film.  Many are the omissions and
changes made to Hawthorne's story.  Despite a mostly fine cast, (Gary
Oldman as Arthur Dimmesdale, the best-liked preacher, Robert Duvall as
Hester's husband, Robert Prosky as one of the ministers, Joan Plowright
as an independent and fearless woman destined to be accused of being a
witch) the film does not begin to come near the excellence of the
book.</P>
<P>     Hester looks like the Demi Moore we know, right down to the
shower in the nude, to a replica of the famous Vanity Fair cover where
she posed with her huge belly and navel.  None of that was necessary.
Hester's daughter, Pearl, eventually age seven, who in the book is an
important character is here relegated to being about three-years-old and
except that a birthmark "proves" she is a witch, she is not anyone of
note in the film.</P>
<P>     But it is the "cowboys and Indians" type of ending that was chosen
as the film's laughable ending that put the final stamp of mediocrity
on this version of THE SCARLET LETTER.</P>
