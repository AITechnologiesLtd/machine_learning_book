SCARLET STREET
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>In few last decades Hollywood producers were very often
using critically and commercially successful film from
France for their own remakes. For many critics, such
practice was the sign that American cinema, at least the
segment associated with big studios, begins to lack the last
sparks of originality. However, remaking French films isn't
such new phenomenon in Hollywood. It happened even half a
century ago, but the results were usually much better than
today. That was the case with LA CHIENNE, 1931 classic by
Rene Clair. In 1945 it was remade as SCARLET STREET, classic
film noire by Fritz Lang.</P>
<P>Plot of the film is set in New York City. Christopher Cross
(played by Edward G. Robinson) is cashier who has nothing in
life except his job, gold watch and shrewish wife Adele
(played by Rosalind Ivan). One night he accidentally
stumbles in dark alley and rescues beautiful Kitty March
(played by Joann Bennett) from a street thug. Almost
immediately he falls in love with her, never knowing that
Kitty actually works on the streets for living and that the
thug happened to be her abusive boyfriend Johnny (played by
Dan Dureya). Of course, Christopher, blinded by the feeling
of love he hadn't felt for decades, lies too. Since his
hobby is amateur painting, he presents himself as successful
and wealthy artist. Kitty sees that as an opportunity to get
a lot of money, and these misunderstanding are just the
first in the spiral of events that would lead to ironic and
tragic finale.</P>
<P>Although SCARLET STREET belongs to the realm of film noirs,
viewers accustomed to more conventional examples of that
genre would have some difficulties cataloguing it as such.
Reason is in the script by Dudley Nichols, which brings
refreshing mix of drama, tragedy and devastatingly black
humour, that would seem somewhat out of place in standard
film noirs. People are not supposed to laugh at the
characters and situations in film noirs, but this is the
case here. To make this achievement even more unusual, the
characters are played by small army of very capable actors.
Edward G. Robinson as Chris Cross gives probably one of his
best performances; his character is flawed, artistic soul,
intelligent enough to deceive people but blinded by feelings
and unable to detect deception himself. Since we could meet
such small, inconspicuous people every day at street, his
tragedy gets very close to viewers. Joann Bennett is also
very good as not so bright femme fatale, but Dan Duryea
steals the show. His character is painted in most
unflattering light, he even doesn't look like someone who
could steal women's hearts, but Duryea plays him as someone
who could invoke audience's sympathy in the end. Fritz Lang
as director brought some of the European feeling into this
film. First of all, his New York doesn't look like American
metropolis. Instead, it looks like any big European town,
with slang phrases spoken by Bennett and Duryea as the only
clear national identification. But the biggest original
contribution by Lang is his ironic portrayal of New York art
world - critics, dealers and artist wannabes (with
always-reliable Vladimir Sokoloff in one of such supporting
roles). It is a real shame that the movie was made in black
and white; paintings that play important role in the plot
should have been displayed in their full glory. However,
this isn't the only problem SCARLET STREET had. Tragicomical
irony of the film and unexpected finale is compromised with
too dark overtones in the epilogue. Those last scenes,
although powerful in its own way, seem somewhat out of place
and nothing more than Lang's concession to censors, unable
to digest unconventional finale. On the other hand, despite
those flaws, this film is real gem of the Old Hollywood, the
one that justifies the existence of remakes.</P>
