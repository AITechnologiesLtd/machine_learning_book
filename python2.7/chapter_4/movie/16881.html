 Twilight (1998) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Paul Newman, Gene Hackman,
Susan Sarandon, James Garner and Stockard Channing. Directed by Robert
Benton.</P>
<P> A feeling comes over you while you're watching Twilight. The simplest way
to describe it is reassurance, a confidence that the movie will not
disappoint you.</P>
<P> This feeling, no doubt, can be attributed to those involved both in front
and behind the camera of this laid-back mystery. Twilight stars Paul
Newman, Susan Sarandon and Gene Hackman, plus it features James Garner and
Stockard Channing. And, the movie is directed and was co-authored by
Oscar-winner Robert Benton (Kramer vs. Kramer, Places in the Heart,
Nobody's Fool).</P>
<P> With credentials like these, Twilight can't fail.</P>
<P> Well, that depends. For today's young audiences, used to MTV-style rapid
cuts, dramatic explosions, testosterone machismo and music loud enough to
drown out inane dialogue, Twilight will seem quaint.</P>
<P> But for the serious filmgoer - those who, no matter what their age, can
appreciate crisp dialogue and good acting - Twilight will be a treat.</P>
<P> It is a languid melodrama, set in contemporary Hollywood and features
stock characters familiar to those who enjoy the film noir genre. There's
the burned-out ex-cop-retired private eye who, though he observes the world
through cynical eyes, nonetheless still retains a modicum of idealism.
There's the rich movie star couple who, behind the facade of having it all,
share dark secrets. There's the rebellious, sexpot young daughter who's too
mature for her age. And there's the decent police detective who, though
bound to do her duty, also is compassionate enough to bend the law to aid a
friend.</P>
<P> Newman is Harry Ross, ex-cop, ex-P.I., who has fallen on hard times. He
lives above the garage of the mansion of his last clients, screen legends
Jack and Catherine Ames (Hackman and Sarandon). Two years earlier, Ross was
hired by Jack Ames to go to Mexico to retrieve Ames' then-17-year-old
daughter.</P>
<P> Ross caught the teen, but in the ensuing struggle, she got hold of his
gun, which discharged, hitting him in the upper leg. However, as Ross was
to learn later, the rumor circulating around L.A. was that he was shot in
his manhood.</P>
<P> It is two years after the shooting incident and Ross, who claims to be
retired, is asked by Jack Ames to deliver a package.</P>
<P> Being this is Hollywood and a murder mystery, the package, of course,
contains hush money for a blackmailer. From this starting point, the bodies
and mayhem begin to pile up.</P>
<P> Like most types of tales in this genre, there are some lapses in
plausibility, but the script is so slick, the acting so intriguing, that
it's not until you are leaving the theater that you pause and ask yourself,
"Hey, why didn't he just ...?"</P>
<P> Newman, as Ross, glides through his role. His voice has the raspiness of a
man who has downed a hundred too many Jack Daniels, and his observations -
especially in his voice-over narration - are that of a weary man who has
seen too many double-crosses and listened to too many lies.</P>
<P> Wisely, Sarandon is not a smoldering femme fatale, but a mature woman who
exudes sexuality without needing to advertise it. She is fierce and sharp.</P>
<P> Hackman's character, the onetime matinee idol, is the weakest of the
three, both literally and figuratively. He is dying of cancer. But, despite
his illness, he remains a shrewd observer of the human condition, playing
on Harry's guilt to get the detective to work for him.</P>
<P> Garner, as Ross' colleague and rival, matches his longtime friend's
cynicism. What he lacks is the moral center that Ross is still able to
maintain.</P>
<P> Channing, as the police lieutenant and Ross' former partner, again
demonstrates what a fine actress she is. Her Verna is a good cop with
divided loyalties, first to the department, the other to her ex-partner.</P>
<P> Twilight is a stylish film. Benton's dialogue is mature and wry. The
musical score by the legendary Elmer Bernstein is appropriately plaintive.</P>
<P> Twilight, though set in contemporary L.A., has a nostalgic aura. It
doesn't rush its story, allowing the viewer to get to know its protagonists
as it ambles along. It's a first-class production.</P>
