<PRE>SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE (1989)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: Steven Soderbergh
Starring: James Spader, Andie MacDowell, Peter Gallagher, Laura San
Giacomo</P>
<P>In an age where sex is shown in its entirety, where graphic sex scenes
seem to populate more and more movies, it's a blast to see a film that
blatantly talks about sex but never features any actual skin.  And it's
even more of a shock that not only is there no skin and very little
actual sex, but that it's actually more erotic than all of those little
cheapie films.</P>
<P>"sex, lies, and videotape" was the film that basically made the indie
film chic, back in its early days of the late 80s.  Writing the
screenplay in about 7 days, Steven Soderbergh made this very talkative
film, sent it to Cannes, and came home with the coveted "Palme D'Or." 
Truthfully, it's not a masterpiece, really, but really a fantastic
character study out to prove a point: talking about sex is more of a
turn-on than actualy sex.  And it makes its point wonderfully.</P>
<P>The film is about, well, sex, lies, and videotape.  Centering around
four characters, all with some screwed-up aspects of sex in their
individual respects, it's a fascinating film that holds one's focus for
its full 100 minutes.  It unfolds like a wonderfully-written novel,
introducing us to characters one-by-one, then tying them together
brilliantly.  This is not only brilliantly written, but also brilliantly
directed and acted, with all four leads giving no less than amazing
performances.</P>
<P>James Spader plays Graham, who basically lives in his car, and roams the
country like a drifter or nomad.  We learn very little of him at a time,
and he's the most intriguing character in the whole film.  Anyway, the
film's plot takes off when he arrives at the home of his old college
roomate's, John (Peter Gallagher), a lawyer who's married to a sexually
barren wife, Ann (Andie MacDowell, before she became moderately big),
who thinks sex his over-rated.  But John is really conducting an affair
with Ann's more liberal sister, Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo, from "Pretty
Woman" and the current sitcom "Fired Up").</P>
<P>Ann is as fascinated with the mysterious Graham as we are, and ends up
apartment shopping with him one day.  Following this little shopping
excursion, they have lunch together, where they do a bit of flirting,
and begin confessing a bit, where Graham announces he's impotent.  He
ends up buying an apartment, and when Ann goes over to see him, she
finds a bunch of tapes he's made with woman.  At first, she thinks there
kinky tapes of him having sex with woman (then she remembers he's
impotent), but he kind of calmy announces that they're his personal
project: videotaping women talking about sex.  She, and we, are
disturbed (and with good reason), but are undeniably fascinated by
what's going on.  She leaves awkwardly, turned off, but, of course, not
being able to put this away in the back of her mind.</P>
<P>Thins happen with the four characters, and soon, not only does Cynthia
find Graham's little fetish intriguing as well, but she has soon made a
tape for him, finding it much more of an actual turn-on than actual sex
with John.  When Ann makes a tape, it's probably the best scene in the
movie, since it becomes the enzyme which fuels the characters to come
out in the end the way they do.</P>
<P>This is, of course, a film primarily fueled by characters.  The plot is
moved only by characterization, not some cheap plot device.  The use of
videotaping sexual confessions is not a cheap plot gimmick, but rather
an outlet that is created by one of the characters to compensate for a
lack of interest in sex.  This is really true-to-life, since sex is
basically interesting for a while, but gets old, but talking about it is
pretty much immortal.  The scene where Graham interviews Ann for the
camera is one of the greatest film scenes in recent film history, as it
shows the characters opening up in ways they wouldn't before.  Each
character is mysterious, but soon shows they are human and unique.</P>
<P>The acting is superb from all four leads.  James Spader, who has never
made it big, but is pretty much a great actor in most of what he does,
has created a role which would be laughably bad if done by a lesser
actor, but he hits all the right notes, making him mysteriously
seductive, yet still human.  Spader's one of the more underrated actors
around, but shows us here that he is a fantastic actor.  Andie
MacDowell, who is often criticized for her acting, is also amazing here,
and also hits all the right notes in her character.  She seems like she
would be the wrong choice for the role, judging by what she usually does
in her work as of late, but shows she's a very talented actress, making
her character multi-leveled and human.  Peter Gallagher, who's also very
underrated, has the tough part in the respect that he's the least
likable character in the film.  He's the adulterous, lying husband, who
never really fully understands the videotaping, but is nevertheless
brilliantly acted by Gallagher.  And Laura San Giacomo, who also never
made it big (I'm sensing a trend here), rocks in the free-spirited role
of Cynthia, making her likable even though she's doing a horrible thing
to her sister.</P>
<P>Alas, this film is brilliant, but is probably not one of the greatest
films of all time like it may seem.  It's definitely one of the most
important films, and one of the best executed films I've seen, but it's
not a film that has a ton of depth to it.  But the message gets across,
and it gets its job done, and gets it done with flying colors.  It's
mildly erotic, but always interesting.  So, it might not have absolutely
deserved the "Palme D'Or" (I have no clue what else was up that year),
but it's a landmark film in indie history, and it's just a great film to
watch.</P>
