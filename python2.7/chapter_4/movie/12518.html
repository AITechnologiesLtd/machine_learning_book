<PRE>WOO
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Daisy v.S. Mayer directs this blind date comedy that's more
uncomfortable than a bad date.  Boring, uninteresting and pointless, the
film wastes both its talent and your time.</P>
<P>Woo is the name given to Jada Pinkett Smith's free-spirited character.
Beautiful and smart, she's also a handful...so much so that her cousin
Claudette (Paula Jai Parker), with whom she's staying, schemes to get
her out of the apartment for one night.  She asks her husband Lenny
(Dave Chappelle) to set up a blind date between his friend Tim (Tommy
Davidson) and Woo.</P>
<P>Tim is a legal assistant studying for the bar, and a very nice guy.  Too
nice, or so his friends think.  His last girlfriend used and abused him,
and now, on the rebound, he reluctantly agrees to the blind date.</P>
<P>Of course, the blind date turns into the disastrous date from hell. But
it's not all bad...at least they didn't have to sit though a movie like
Woo. Woo is never groundbreakingly awful.  Well, ok...the chicken sex
fetishist was disturbingly bad, but the movie is more bland than
horrible.  The film is packed with endless unfunny setups that lead
nowhere. You're sure that there's going to be a payoff soon...but it
just never comes.</P>
<P>Jada Pinkett Smith deserves a better film than this one.  Her role here
has some substance, but it is lost in the morass of the film's bungled
attempts at humor.  Tommy Davidson fills the needs of his role:  nice
but boring. There's not much to be said for the supporting cast.  Tim's
trio of buffoonish friends particularly suffer from the film's lack of
humor.</P>
<P>The film is not "Run Away!" bad, but it is bad...and not one which I
would recommend to anyone besides an insomniac.</P>
