<P>Within the first ten minutes of For Love of the Game, Detroit Tigers
pitching ace of 19 years Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is informed that
his team is being sold and that he is being traded to San Francisco as
part of that deal. He is offered the choice of retiring with dignity,
but he only has a day to consider his decision. In an unrelated move, he
gets dumped by the love of his life, who is leaving for a job in London,
and will miss the Big Game. As Chapel suits up to pitch what could be
his final game as a Tiger, Cranky sat in his seat thinking, gee, I
betcha he pitches . . . [think about it for a second. It's so damned
obvious that my college screenwriting professor would've slapped my
hands with a ruler.]</P>
<P>It doesn't matter. Neither does it matter that I've laid out as much of
the story as I have. For Love of the Game is Costner's third baseball
movie; he's scored twice before with baseball themed flicks and his
record continues to be perfect with the latest, and presumably last
(unless he decides to try on a manager's uniform) four bagger story. For
Love of the Game is a much smaller story than Bull Durham or Field of
Dreams; it's the story of one man trying to figure out what's really
important to him, his life (baseball) or his love. Or maybe a way to
balance both.</P>
<P>As the Tigers take the field for the last game of the Season against the
New York Yankees, in the House that Ruth built, Chapel sorts out the
previous five years in his mind. His random meeting with Jane Aubrey
(Kelly Preston) and the rocky start to their relationship. Its ups and
downs. The player friends that deserted Detroit by going free agent. The
players who weren't good enough to survive a season. A couple of
personal crises that threatened both career and love. When these lapses
draw him away from the reality of the moment, Chapel has his partner
teammate, catcher Gus Sinski (John C. Reilly) to draw him back to
reality.</P>
<P>It's a character driven story, and the only character we get to see
develop and change is the one who is central to all the lives of the
story. Jane and Gus and Chapel's parents all serve to mirror particular
points in this man's journey; it's a role that Costner has played
perfectly before and he does so again. Writer Dana Stevens and Director
Sam Raimi has properly balanced Costner's flashbacks against the current
events of the game in progress. Even if you guess the outcome early on,
the events of the game are so well choreographed that you'll be sucked
into a fannish appreciation. The audience I sat with broke into
spontaneous applause twice as the game played out.</P>
<P>It's a small story. An adult popcorn movie whose only flaw is the almost
nonstop use of songs to drive the emotional elements of the movie along.
The sound mix is so bad that the lyrics drown out the dialog; every time
a song comes up it draws attention from the story. It was overkill for
me, but I paid almost ten bucks to see the flick in a theater whose
speaker cones were cracked, so the mix may not be a problem for you.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to For Love of the Game, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$6.50</PRE>
<P>Cranky has a teevee critic friend that saw For Love of the Game in a
private room last week, and hated the thing. I walked in recalling
Costner's most recent bombs, but walked out with warm fuzzies. The rest
of the crowd, especially the women, were making negative comparisons
between Kelly Preston's role and Susan Sarandon's (from Bull Durham).
That's apples and oranges to me, folks. Even with that negative, the
overall reaction to the flick was positive.</P>
