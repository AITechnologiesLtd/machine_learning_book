<P>El Niño has screwed up our weather patterns so much that the first
summer movie has arrived in early May. Some of the haste in presenting
Deep Impact is an attempt to put as much distance as possible between
this film and the July release of Armageddon. Both films bring us an
Earth threatened by collision with a Big Rock From Space. A recent news
release caused a buzz about this very thing, but it was quickly refuted.
One account said that the alarmist scientist was linked to one of these
films. Welcome to the information age.</P>
<P>The movie starts with a young MSNBC reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni),
who thinks she has uncovered a cabinet-level scandal. The "Ellie" that
Jenny suspects of being a homewrecker turns out to be an E.L.E. project
- "Extinction Level Event." In less than a year, a Manhattan-sized comet
will strike the Earth. This gets her on the inside track as the story
develops, and vaults her to an anchor's desk, perhaps before she is
ready. Her newscasts move the story along. And there IS a story.
Although Dreamworks spent good money for special effects, they also
hired real scriptwriters, and many good actors.</P>
<P>Casting Morgan Freeman as president is perfect - he always radiates a
cool intelligence that could get him the real job if he wanted it. His
grave press conferences give the film an emotional depth. Robert Duvall
plays an aged astronaut, added to a space team that will try to
intercept and destroy the comet. The  young crew resents his insertion
into their practiced team, but he proves his worth.  Charles Martin
Smith opens up the film with a good, brief role as the astronomer who
discovers the comet.  Elijah Wood plays the high-schooler who brings it
to his attention, achieving co-discoverer status. The kid's new fame
forms one of the side stories, as it merges with another - the
government lottery to see who will get to hide below the surface and
survive the impending nuclear winter. Another sub-plot gives Vanessa
Redgrave some good scenes as Jenny's mother, and she makes them genuine
enough to transcend their "filler" status.</P>
<P>Tea Leoni may not have been the best choice to play Jenny. She has
demonstrated that she is a brilliant, beautiful comedienne, but this
role uses none of her strengths. Jenny never smiles, never shows any
skin, and always looks tired. Seeing her weary, hollow face so often, I
caught myself wondering if she shouldn't put on a few pounds.</P>
<P>Some scenes in such an epic write themselves: disarrayed traffic; heroic
gestures, successful and futile; heartfelt farewells. It would serve no
purpose to elaborate on the ending, except to say that it clearly shows
a lot of thought and respect for the audience. That respect did not
preclude some fairly blatant product placement, though. While showing
stockpiles of Ensure may save some lines of dialogue, it was done more
than once. And is there any reason our reporter has to work for MSNBC
and not some other, CNN-like, cable news outfit? Other movies substitute
other letters of the alphabet without breaking stride. Small gripes for
a decent effort. Deep Impact makes a reasonable addition to the genre,
and it doesn't make the audience swallow much to buy into it.</P>
