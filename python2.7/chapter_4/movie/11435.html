<PRE>                            MRS. DALLOWAY
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The title character has spent a
          lifetime of taking the easy route, choosing comfort
          over making her life meaningful.  Now her big
          concern is that her party is a success.
          Contrasting, we see the story of a shell-shocked
          WWI veteran haunted by memories and self-
          accusation.  Virginia Woolf's cat-like claw takes a
          swipe at the British upper-class.  Rating: 6 (0 to
          10), high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Virginia Woolf wrote MRS. DALLOWAY as a stream-of-consciousness
novel taking place in the title character's mind.  Now Eileen Atkins
has adapted the story as a somewhat non-linear narrative jumping
forward and backward in time.  There are two story lines, tangent at
many points but never really converging into a single story.  We have a
view of Clarissa Dalloway as a young woman (played by Natascha
McElhone) and as an older woman (Vanessa Redgrave), and we have the
story of Septimus Warren Smith (Rupert Graves).  More on his story
later.  Even as a young woman Clarissa could not commit to anything but
comfort and ease.  Now as an older woman she has attained comfort and
ease and her big concerns at the moment we see her all over the success
of one of her own parties.  She is an empty shell woman inside whom
thoughts bounce around un-weighted by any real profundity.  She is
nostalgic for a past in which she consistently chose the path of least
resistance in spite of frequent temptations to show a little character.
As an adult she is an antique and a relic of a dying way of life with
little inkling how irrelevant she is outside of a small circle of
friends.  She has little understanding of the hard world outside that
circle.</P>
<P>     Nearby and yet so far away is Septimus Smith who fought in the
Great War and saw a close friend blown to pieces by a land mine.
Already in shock from the war, he felt nothing at seeing his friend die
so horribly.  Now he is coming out of the initial shock and the meaning
of what he has seen is haunting him.  He blames himself for feeling
nothing at the death of a friend.  And he hates his doctors who seem as
out of touch with the harsh realities of life as Mrs.  Dalloway.  They
cannot even understand Smith's painful howl and instead pallidly
prescribe a rest cure at an asylum.  They see Smith as insane when the
pain he feels is more real than anything in Mrs. Dalloway's entire
useless life.</P>
<P>     The theme of the two worlds is curiously reminiscent of Sidney
Lumet's THE PAWNBROKER with Holocaust survivor Rod Steiger telling
well-meaning do-gooder Geraldine Fitzgerald that he comes from a whole
world that she knows nothing about and whose people are of an entirely
different species.  MRS. DALLOWAY is in some ways very much like THE
PAWNBROKER told from the viewpoint of the genteel Fitzgerald character.</P>
<P>     Mrs.  Dalloway's friends and, in fact, her whole class seem to be
out of touch with harsh reality.  In a particularly telling sequence, a
friend of Dalloway's decides that the best thing for England would be
to take all the returning WWI veterans who have been unable to find
work on their own and effectively exile them to Canada.  Her friends
who know a little more decide to humor her in spite of the foolishness
and probable illegality of the plan.</P>
<P>     Virginia Woolf's MRS. DALLOWAY must have been a difficult novel to
adapt (by all accounts, I have not read it) and the script has some
technical problems made worst by some casting problems.  The telling
drifts from present into the past with little signal and it is not
always obvious that it has happened.  It is very difficult in the
flashback sequences to match the younger versions of characters to the
older ones since the characters are played by different actors who
often are physically quite different.  The young Clarissa and her
friend Sally are nearly the same height in their 20s and considerably
different in height what is probably their 50s.  We are led to assume
that having children has shortened Sally by what must be six inches.
It might well have been better to use only young actors and age them
much as Orson Welles aged himself in CITIZEN KANE.  But for these
problems in the casting, most of the roles seem well-played with
veteran British actors in several of the roles.</P>
<P>     This film is for the most part gentle, but deep-down there seems
to be a lot of anger in the telling, perhaps more than one would find
in even an E.  M. Forster or John Galsworthy story.  It would be
interesting to read the novel to see if Woolf has the same disdain for
the characters that the film seems to have.  I rate MRS. DALLOWAY a 6
on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
