<PRE>                                NATURAL BORN KILLERS
                       A film review by David Gregory Platt
                        Copyright 1994 David Gregory Platt</PRE>
<P>     Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN KILLERS is both less and more than
you'd expect.  Less in that the violence is not of the disgusting gore
variety that it's been trumped up as, and more in that disturbing
images and ideas are presented at a quick-cut, insane pace.</P>
<P>     The story is already famous, or infamous.  Micky (Woody
Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) Knox are two young,
charismatic outlaws who kill everybody that gets in their way (leaving,
of course, one behind to tell who did it).  Stone catches them midway
into their spree, with a freakish sceve in a roadside diner.  From
there, the carnage continues, with several road sequences in which Mick
and Mallory do little more than slaughter people and profess their love
for each other.</P>
<P>     The pair's story is taken up by Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.),
host of the fictional trash TV show "American Maniacs" (think Geraldo
with a touch of Rupert Murdoch).  Having used tasteless remakes of the
two's crimes to great ratings reward, Gale inadvertently makes them
media heroes, with a worldwide following (one montage shows mall kids
from major capitols praising the pair as icons, lampooning the global
MTV mentality).</P>
<P>     In addition to the TV parodies, the movie is filmed in several
different stocks, from 16mm to regular film.  Intercut are flashes of
bizarre footage (everything from the famous eye from 2001 to
cheap-looking monsters and demons) that sometimes comment on the
action, sometimes not.  As well, the killers' odyssey through the
southwest is not always presented literally, but with strange rear
projection behind their vintage Dodge.  These techniques recalls
Stone's own JFK, in which the inserts and effects were used as visual
aids to otherwise dull pieces of evidence.  Here they are less
coherent, and seem to emerge from some bizarre shared mindset of Micky
& Mallory.</P>
<P>     Micky & Mallory are eventually tracked down by superstar cop Jack
Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore), who understands the psychopaths far too
well.  The capture is presented as an event predetermined by the media,
eerily predicting the O. J. Simpson hysteria (the film does feature an
obligatory O. J. reference, but no doubt this scene predates it.)</P>
<P>     The final sequence, with a live interview by Wayne Gale and a
subsequent prison riot, all shown live during the Superbowl, tends to
drag a bit.  Although Tommy Lee Jones adds color as a sneering warden,
the prison scenes are bogged down by the endless carnage and Micky's
speech explaining his philosophy.  It's hard to tell whether or not the
diatribe is satire: it's insane, but not too off the mark, and Stone
films it in the same solemn fashion as Kevin Costner's final remarks
in JFK.  Maybe Stone is lampooning himself.</P>
<P>     The multimedia technique is disorienting, but it's not new.  To
anyone who's ever seen a Guns 'N' Roses video, it's nothing you haven't
seen before.  It is so unrelenting that the movie's flow suffers for it
In his "Entertainment Weekly" review, Owen Glieberman suggested that it
denies Micky and Mallory "'reality.'" However, without this "reality,"
there's no point where you can latch hold and get into the story, so
instead it simply goes over you like an endless barrage.  What suffers
most are the TV parodies.  (There's nothing new to them, either:
stylistic parodies date back to MOBY DICK) The American Maniacs
sequence is shot through with pointless cuts to the black- and-white
footage.  It also ruins the illusion in the infamous sitcom scenes, in
which Mallory's horrific past with her abusive father (Rodney
Dangerfield) is presented on garish video and with a laughtrack.</P>
<P>     Dangerfield's performance leads the pack in a movie with some
strong, over-the-top satirical acting.  Dangerfield unleashes the
brutality that has been hiding in his comedy for a long time, and
essentially makes you forget the stunt casting apparent in the choice.
If Scorsese's watching, he should consider him for a mobster role.
Similarly, Harrelson erases all memories of his kindly persona on
"Cheers." Juliette Lewis is good as always (although she may be in
danger of being typecast as a female Travis Bickle type), and Tom
Sizemore plays Scagnetti as a perverse Scorsese thug (if that's
possible).  Tommy Lee Jones, representing a more banal evil than the
Knoxes, plays the warden as a hardened refugee from a '70s
crime-as-big-social-problem movie.  Russell Means, as an old Indian
Shaman, provides a small bit of gentle humour in the only natural,
human performance in the movie.  The only weak performance is by Robert
Downey, Jr., who hits too many wrong cartoonish notes.</P>
<P>     (A note about the music: instead of a musical score, the movie
features a mix of popular songs from Leonard Cohen to The Specials,
supervised by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor.  The practise is
not as revolutionary as it's been touted, and has been done to much
better effect in GOODFELLAS, among others.)</P>
<P>     NATURAL BORN KILLERS is the first "critic-proof" art movie since
2001.  Simply put, those who don't itlike will be told they "don't
understand it."  However, unlike 2001, it's the director's ineptness,
not his skill, that makes it hard to understand.</P>
