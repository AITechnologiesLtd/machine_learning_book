HARD EIGHT
A film review by Chris Loar</PRE>
<P>Starring Philip Baker Hall (Sydney), John C. Reilly (John
Finnegan), Gwyneth Paltrow (Clementine), Samuel L.
Jackson (Jimmy)
Written and Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson</P>
<P>HARD EIGHT is Paul Thomas Anderson's debut feature, and it's
not so different in most respects from his much-hailed BOOGIE
NIGHTS.  True, NIGHTS offers us an Altman-esque sprawl of
story and character, while HARD EIGHT focuses on a small
cast and a simple tale.  But Anderson is repeating himself
thematically, and those who liked NIGHTS' family of porn stars
and low-grade filmmakers will also appreciate the strange, slightly
seedy surrogate family he creates here.  One hopes that
Anderson will start to broaden his horizons a bit, but the fact
remains that in HARD EIGHT we have a competent piece of
storytelling from a precocious young director; the film is a
vehicle for some very good performances and has a pleasant
visual style that hints of better things to come.</P>
<P>HARD EIGHT is essentially the story of Sydney (Philip Baker
Hall), an aging gambler who takes a young fellow named
John Finnegan (John C. Reilly) under his wing, becoming a
stand-in father to him.  We meet both Sydney and John during
the film's prologue outside a dingy roadside coffeshop in Reno.
John is sitting outside in the dirt, very visibly down on his luck.
He's just lost his money in Vegas, and in the process lost the
chance to give his mother the funeral she deserves.  Sydney
takes John inside, buys him a cup of coffee, and offers to help
him bury his mother and perhaps put his life back together --
by showing him how to play the casino system for everything
it's worth.  John, though skeptical, accepts the offer.</P>
<P>We skip over the next two years to get to the heart of the film.
John and Sydney have become friends -- or, rather, family.  John's
missing both his parents, and it's obvious from the get-go that
Sydney serves as a surrogate father to him.  They're an
appropriate match; John is an overgrown child, all puppy-dog
eyes and naivete, while Sydney as played by Hall has a powerful,
relaxed presence.  Hall's an actor of impressive talents, and while
his performance here is slightly uneven, he is perfectly cast; the
lines in his face convey far more than those the script gives him.
He hints at restraint and secret knowledge with every blink of his
heavy eyelids, and he's a delight to watch.  Reilly is also good
here as the weak and gullible son; his lack of experience is
written all over his well-intentioned face.</P>
<P>The only other two characters who matter are Gwyneth Paltrow's
Clementine, John's slightly troubled love interest, and Samuel L.
Jackson as Jimmy, John's disrespectful, irreverent, and slightly
dangerous friend.  Jackson and Hall are particularly good when
onscreen together; Hall's old-school Mafia conservatism -- his
deference to women, his dislike of anything loud or flashy --
contrasts vividly with Jackson's crass, upstartish muscleman
with a gun.</P>
<P>The rest of the story really ought not be revealed; the film traffics
in Sydney's secrets, and it's important to see it the first time
without knowing where the plot is going.  Suffice it to say that
Sydney's relationship with John is more complex than is initially
obvious.</P>
<P>I said the film covers the same ground as BOOGIE NIGHTS,
and the films are nowhere closer than in their treatment of
their morally ambiguous father figures, Sydney and BOOGIE
NIGHTS' Jack Horner.  Both serve as ersatz parents to otherwise
lost young men, and both seem like strange choices for that role,
with their seedy lifestyles and questionable morals.  But Sydney
is a more interesting and complex variation on this theme -- more
fleshed-out than Horner.  For while Horner doesn't see his own
sins -- just his own impending obsolescence -- Sydney knows
how many secrets he has, and needs to pretend to be much that
he is not if he is to serve effectively as John's father.  And that's a
very interesting way of looking at fatherhood in general; for I
suppose that many fathers must feel at times that they're playing
a role they simply aren't cut out for.  Fathers in stories (though
not, I suppose, in the real world) always hide their weakness and
their guilt from their children.  Sydney does this, too, and goes to
extraordinary lengths to keep John innocent of the knowledge of
his new father's sins.  It's not clear in the end if we're supposed
to see this as noble or as base, and whether we should feel love
or revulsion for Sydney.  Perhaps both.</P>
<P>Taken as a whole, HARD EIGHT is far from perfect.  There is much
in both the film's conception and its execution that could have been
handled more effectively, and everything from the lighting to the
dialogue suffers from amateurism at times.  But unlike many
imperfect films, it has a number of perfect moments:  Sydney
sitting quietly at a casino table, chatting in a fatherly way with
Clementine; Sydney drinking coffee, offering a young man a second
chance at life; John and Clementine chatting nonsensically about
rigging the pay-per-view system in the hotel, slowly falling in love.
Anderson is simply superb at creating moments like these; I'm
hoping that his ability to tie these moments together into whole
movies will soon catch up.</P>
