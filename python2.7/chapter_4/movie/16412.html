 The Man in the Iron Mask (1998) 2 stars out of 4</PRE>
<P>  Randall Wallace's adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask, more rightly
should be called "The Boy in the Iron Mask." This is not a criticism of the
acting ability of Leonardo DiCaprio, who assays the dual role of King Louis
XIV and his twin brother, Phillippe.</P>
<P> It is based more on DiCaprio's physical appearance. As he has proven in
such works as This Boy's Life, What's Eating Gilbert Grape  and Basketball
Diaries, DiCaprio is a powerful screen presence.</P>
<P> Yet his boyish, almost effeminate, looks work against him in this costume
drama. While he matter-of-factly displays King Louis' arrogance and
cruelty, he seems to lack that inner strength, that regal bearing that sets
a king apart from his subjects.</P>
<P>  To his credit, DiCaprio creates two distinct personalities. His use of
his eyes to distinguish between the cold king and his more compassionate
twin is a fine piece of acting, but he is undercut by Wallace's script,
which has the young actor mouthing some rather hoary dialogue.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, it is not only DiCaprio who suffers from Wallace's very
loose reworking of the Alexander Dumas classic. This sequel to The Three
Musketeers  has been filmed many times before, dating back to one of
Douglas Fairbanks' last swashbucklers in 1929.</P>
<P> While Wallace has kept the basic plot outline - the aging Three Musketeers
plus D'Artagnan rescue the imprisoned twin of the young, cruel king of
France, the writer of the Academy Award-winning Braveheart has added
characters and subplots that probably would send Dumas spinning in his
grave.</P>
<P> Wallace even has lifted a subplot from his earlier screenplay involving
forbidden love between a commoner and a person of royalty.</P>
<P> Another of the film's problems is the conflicting acting styles between
the four brilliant actors playing the over-the-hill
"all-for-one-and-one-for-all" gang.</P>
<P> Gerard Depardieu, the only real Frenchman among the group, plays his
Porthos much too broadly and comically, almost as if he studied Frank
Finley's interpretation from Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers and The
Four Musketeers from the mid-1970s.</P>
<P>  John Malkovich as Athos makes no attempt at an accent, speaking in his
flat Midwestern tongue, but with the intensity and mannerisms he would
bring to a contemporary work back at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago.</P>
<P> Jeremy Irons as Aramis, of course, speaks with that upper-class English
accent that immediately brings back memories of his vocal turn as Scar in
Disney's The Lion King.</P>
<P> As D'Artagnan, Irish actor Gabriel Byrne seems content to merely sulk his
way through the proceedings, interpreting most of his lines in a pained,
whisper-like voice.</P>
<P> The biggest problem is a lack of chemistry among the quartet. These are
men, legends, who have a lifelong camaraderie, but the audience needs to be
constantly reminded of their glorious past through bits of dialogue because
they are unable to create it through their performances.</P>
<P> To be fair, this latest screen version of a Dumas work is more appealing
and better worked than the abominable Disney factory recreation of The
Three Musketeers of a few years ago in which Chris O'Donnell, Charlie Sheen
and Kiefer Sutherland were as believable as a group of high school students
performing their fall drama.</P>
<P>  DiCaprio fans won't be disappointed by The Man in the Iron Mask. Dressed
in his kingly robes, the young actor will melt the heart of many a young
teen, while there is enough swordplay and swashbuckling to keep their dates
interested.</P>
<P>  Overall, though, Wallace has taken too many liberties in trying to
modernize a timeless classic that did not need any improvement.</P>
