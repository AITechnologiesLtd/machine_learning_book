       THE SWEET HEREAFTER
       --------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            GRADE: A</PRE>
<PRE>       General kvetching aside, I'm starting to believe that any
       year that ends with a new release from Canadian director Atom
       Egoyan is a very good year indeed.</PRE>
<P>       Like his countryman David Cronenberg, Egoyan is one of the
       few great directors working today whose films reflect not
       only a consistent worldview, but also a numinous mood. (Also
       like Cronenberg, Egoyan has set one of this year's most
       memorable scenes inside of an automatic car wash.) Appealing
       no more strenuously to the intellect than to our innate sense
       for beauty, Egoyan's films look chilly but eventually
       surrender warmth. They alienate, distress and confound us.
       What's most miraculous is that they close up the wounds
       they've made.</P>
<PRE>       THE SWEET HEREAFTER is Egoyan's first adaptation. The source
       material is Russell Banks' highly acclaimed novel, in which
       four different narrators tell the story of a school bus
       accident and its devastating effect on a small town in
       upstate New York. Egoyan has relocated that small town to
       British Columbia, and has reworked the story into a brilliant
       riff on the tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin (watch, just
       watch), but his concerns remain those of the novel. It's
       about the effect of such a disaster on a community, and about
       the ways that grieving families can be seduced by the
       suggestion that somebody -- in fact, anybody -- is in fact
       responsible for that single wrenching moment when lives are
       taken away from us.</PRE>
<PRE>       The devil, of sorts, whispering in this community's ear is
       lawyer Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm, a fine actor who has
       never been finer than he is here), who wants to file a
       lawsuit on behalf of the parents who lost children in the
       accident. It's never clear exactly who he wants to sue,
       although the manufacturer of the school bus is mentioned
       several times as a likely target. (Failing that, perhaps the
       agency that installed the broken guard rail is to blame.)
       What he makes clear is that he's not acting to stanch the
       families' grief -- he's acting, rather, to indulge their
       anger. And, of course, he's acting to ensure that such a
       terrible thing never happens again.</PRE>
<P>       If some folks are won over by his rather transparent
       puppetry, it doesn't mean that Stephens is inherently evil.
       Clearly, he's a man doing his job, even if his speech seems
       far too rehearsed for there to be any sincerity left in his
       motives. And, in a positively Egoyanian turn of events, we've
       learned that Stephens is mourning over his own lost child, a
       drug-addled girl named Zoe who has grown into
       post-adolescence as one of the living dead. The film opens,
       in fact, with an idyllic image of Stephens and his wife
       sleeping with their three-year-old daughter between them,
       bathed in warm light. When we see this image for the second
       time, it is as the introduction to the second of two
       incidents that anchor the film. The first is the actual
       on-screen representation of the school bus accident. And the
       second is Stephens' mindscreen recollection of a terrifying
       morning when he found little Zoe swollen from spider bites.</P>
<P>       But never mind. Although THE SWEET HEREAFTER is an even more
       complex puzzle than Egoyan's previous EXOTICA, all these
       disparate elements reveal themselves in similarly good time
       to be an essential part of this multidimensional story.
       Egoyan jumps backward and forward in the narrative with a
       clever deliberacy that reveals bits and pieces of literal and
       metaphorical relationships all in their own time. It verges
       on soap opera: we learn that Wendell's wife Risa is having an
       affair with Billy the widower, whose babysitter is an
       aspiring rock star who's been lured into an unwholesome
       relationship with ... well, again, never mind. You just have
       to see it.</P>
<P>       And oh, is it something to see. Paul Sarossy's camerawork and
       Mychael Danna's music both belong on another plane entirely
       from this world of ours. Danna's exotic score, lending a
       tranquil quietude to the anxious proceedings, layers aural
       texture atop Sarossy's splendid Panavision cinematography
       (which will be wrecked, by the way, on videotape, so see this
       in a theater if you possibly can). The performers often
       inhabit only the very edge of this widescreen frame, their
       individualized reactions highlighted by the often shadowed
       spaces that surround them. The landscape, meanwhile, is
       repeatedly expressed as a richly detailed expanse of snowy
       ground spread beneath low clouds. Even with Sarossy on board,
       never before has an Egoyan film enjoyed a visual sensibility
       quite this keen.</P>
<P>       The pretty pictures provide a sweeping panorama for what is,
       barring perhaps the very different L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, the
       year's most assured ensemble of performers. Leading the way
       is Holm, whose fine performance elicits, by turns, distaste,
       anxiety, and sympathy. His narration of the incident
       involving his daughter and a pocketknife held at the ready
       generates more tension than a year's worth of Hollywood
       "thrillers." Also worthy of special note is the solid Bruce
       Greenwood, whom you may or may not recognize from EXOTICA,
       flexing his thespian muscle as gas station owner Billy Ansel,
       probably the most upstanding of all these characters and
       arguably the film's eventual moral center. And Sarah Polley,
       who had a small role as Greenwood's "babysitter" in the
       previous film, reprises that role here, and then some. (Her
       deposition in Mitchell's case, it turns out, will be key.)
       Longtime Egoyan collaborator Gabrielle Rose strikes an
       authentically daffy note as bus driver Dolores Driscoll, and
       Egoyan's wife Arsinee Khanjian (who had a memorable cameo in
       IRMA VEP) does her part as one-half of a couple whose
       "hippie" sensibilities are tested by the promise of making
       somebody pay for the loss of their adopted child.</P>
<P>       In the end, THE SWEET HEREAFTER rejects that particular idea
       of revenge, positing instead the notion that, shunning
       litigation, a community can care for its own (and suggesting
       that a lie, if told correctly and to the right people, can be
       a much-needed suture on a gaping wound). If that seems an odd
       tack for the impetuously modern Egoyan to take, consider that
       his films have often played out as cautionary tales dwelling
       on the effects of alienation and separation -- the
       substitution of voyeurism for sexuality, and of strained
       relations for companionship. Into this cycle, THE SWEET
       HEREAFTER fits neatly. For all the vigorous gyrations these
       characters go through in coming to terms with their loss,
       only the stubborn Stephens seems to remain an island, having
       run himself dry by the story's end.
