review: ***1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>Since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought Texas thriller
"Blood Simple," Joel and Ethan Coen have been one of the most eclectic,
original, and downright fascinating creative teams in modern Hollywood.
Their films are highly stylized, deeply embedded in a particular time
and place, and their characters are more often than not everyday people
who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances.</P>
<P>In "The Big Lebowski," their first cinematic offering since the multiple
Academy Award-winning "Fargo," the action takes place in Los Angeles
during the Gulf War, and the hero of the story is Jeff Lebowski, aka The
Dude. The Dude is played by Jeff Bridges -- one of Hollywood's most
underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since Sean Penn
stumbled through the halls of Ridgemont High.</P>
<P>The Dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties.
He has shaggy, shoulder-length hair, a grizzled goatee badly in need of
a trim, and he wears mostly stained tee-shirts, long shorts, and gellies
without socks. He smokes a lot of pot, drinks a lot of White Russians,
and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with
his two buddies, a slightly psychotic Vietnam vet named Walter Sobchak
(John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi), one of those guys who always
wants to be part of the conversation, but never quite makes it in.</P>
<P>One day, the Dude is confused with another Jeff Lebowski (David
Huddleston), this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy
wife, Bunny (Tara Reid), owes a lot of people a lot of money. The main
plot and all its accompanying side-plots and Coenesque diatribes are far
too complicated to get into here. Suffice to say that The Dude becomes
deeply involved with the Big Lebowski when Bunny is kidnaped and The
Dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money. By the time all is
said and done, Walter has become deeply involved, as has The Big
Lebowski's daughter, Maude (Julianne Moore), a feminist performance
artist, a pornographer named Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara), and a group
of German nihilists led by Peter Stormare, who was so great as the
silent but deadly kidnaper in "Fargo."</P>
<P>"The Big Lebowski" plays like an amalgam of all the Coen Brothers'
earlier efforts. It shares their previous films' strong sense of time
and place, as well as their send-ups of movie genres and political and
cultural ideologies. "Lebowski" has the same kind of crazed caricatures
that made "Raising Arizona" such a hoot; it has surrealistic dream
sequences (one of which involves a Busby Berkley-like dance number) that
characterized the ending of "Barton Fink"; and it has the same kind of
cartoonish look and feel that pervaded "The Hudsucker Proxy."</P>
<P>The film was shot by veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins, who has
worked with the Coens on three other films, "Barton Fink," "The
Hudsucker Proxy," and "Fargo." Deakins always gives the Coens' films a
distinctive visual style, and here he does a brilliant job of capturing
the bright colors of seedy Los Angeles in the early nineties, whether
that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by The Dude's main
competitor Jesus Quintana (John Turturro), or the strikingly manic dream
sequences, one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a
strike from a bowling ball's point of view.</P>
<P>If "Fargo" was the Coen Brothers' most restrained effort in years, "The
Big Lebowski" marks their return to over-the-edge filmmaking. It is
overflowing with style and attitude, which helps make up for the
scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end. The
Coens fill the screen with lighting, set design, music, and hilarious
performances from all the leads, especially Bridges and the always
reliable John Goodman, who shows real comic timing in his untimely
'Nam-inspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted
Judaism.</P>
<P>With Joel directing, Ethan producing, and both writing, the Coen
Brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out.
Their talent lies not in their ability to reflect the norms of reality,
but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life and bring
them to light. The Coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world, and they
put them center-stage to show that it's not just guys like The Dude who
are nuts, but the entire planet.</P>
