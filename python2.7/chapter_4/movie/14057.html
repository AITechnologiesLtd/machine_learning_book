Screenplay: Nat Mauldin; Larry Levin<HR>How much you like "Dr. Dolittle" is going to depend on your tolerance 
for butt jokes. This oddly cute update of the 1967 Rex Harrison classic 
casts Eddie Murphy as the titular doc who can talk to the animals, and 
replaces the then-G-rated whimsy with naughty humor that mostly revolves 
around the anal orifice. Objects (i.e., thermometers) are unwelcomely 
inserted and odors are noxiously emitted. Kids, therefore, will be 
delighted. As for adults, if fart-and-feces gags -- and some of them 
literal gags -- aren't your cup of tea, well, this movie'll have you 
groaning more often than giggling. But for those of us who enjoy a 
well-executed crude chuckle, this "Dolittle" achieves a lowbrow high 
unheard of since Murphy's own "The Nutty Professor." I dare you not to 
at least crack a smile at the protest put up by a dog who's about to be 
neutered. </P>
<P>Murphy's John Dolittle is an esteemed doctor (of course) whose 
relationship with his wife (Kristen Wilson) and daughters (Kyla Pratt 
and Raven-Symone) needs a little work, though much of his recent 
distraction can probably be attributed to the big financial deal he's 
about to sign at the office. Matters are complicated one night when he 
whacks his head during a car crash and is suddenly revisited by his 
childhood ability to communicate with all creatures great and small, 
namely the down-on-luck pooch (voiced by Norm Macdonald) that caused the 
accident and a brazen guinea pig (Chris Rock) belonging to his youngest 
child. There's also a subplot about evil HMOs and a greedy hospital 
colleague ("Bulworth"'s Oliver Platt), but they're largely dispensable. 
Before Dolittle knows it, word of his talent spreads to the entire 
animal kingdom and he's performing marriage counseling on pigeons and 
giving advice to an alcoholic monkey (one of the best bits). </P>
<P>"Dr. Dolittle" veers off course as it nears its end, when the tone 
abruptly shifts and the film asks us to emote over an ailing tiger 
(Albert Brooks) whose neurotic ramblings, up until then, have provided 
some of the movie's funniest moments. These climactic scenes blatantly 
attempt to tug at the heartstrings, but "Dolittle" is far more 
successful when it masks its moral ("You be who you are, and you love 
who you are") behind the guise of Murphy and his chatty critters. For 
the record, there's nothing wrong with positive messages, and the one 
here is particularly worthwhile, but it clashes with everything else 
when it's forced to the front of the film. Still, that's not as big a 
flaw as it might seem given that A) it's only apparent during "Dr. 
Dolittle"'s last reel, and B) the movie is a pretty irresistible romp 
beforehand. </P>
<P>Murphy, effective and genuine as a family man, holds his own against his 
furry, feathered co-stars; though they get all the best lines, he plays 
off them good enough to remain the real star of the show. The special 
effects that allow the menagerie to speak and the celebrities who 
provide their voices are a lot of fun as well; while much of what they 
have to say will be appreciated by the youngest audience members, "Dr. 
Dolittle" throws more than a few jokes the way of grown-ups. (A 
conversation between two rats: "If he dies, I don't know what I'll do!" 
"You'll take me outside and eat me!" "Only out of respect.") There are 
even punchlines that kids will guffaw at without really getting. ("Our 
butts hurt," a group of sheep complain to Dolittle.) While nothing 
incredible even as comedies come, the movie does its job and does it 
well, all inside of a running time that barely fills up 90 minutes. If 
laughter is the best medicine, then "Dr. Dolittle" should come in pill 
form.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck
