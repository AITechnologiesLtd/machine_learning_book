<P>Actor Matthew Broderick finally comes full-circle after several failed
attempts at a respectable career as a working actor in Hollywood, and
becomes a teacher in high school, a role diametrically opposed to his most
famous acting role to date, as the uncatchable student Ferris Bueller in
1986's classic John Hughes comedy FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (8/10). Anyone?
Anyone??</P>
<P>PLOT:
Overly ambitious student Tracey Flick is running for the student body
presidency and will not let anybody stand in her way. Not her twelve-year
veteran teacher Mr. M, not the most popular boy in high school who is also
running for the political prize, nor his lesbian sister, the other nominee
on the ballot.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Clever, somewhat predictable, stylish film features Reese Witherspoon's
greatest performance to date as the most annoying overachiever that you'd
ever NOT want to meet. Now despite generally enjoying this film, I could not
help but compare it to (what seems like its male counterpart) the superior
1998 film, RUSHMORE (8/10), which featured a stronger performance by its
co-star, Bill Murray, a more entertaining script, and many funnier moments.
But since any direct comparison is inherently unfair, I would say that this
film does succeed in its root of black comedy, with no huge laughs, an
interesting plot, and several great performances, with Witherspoon's showing
topping them all.</P>
<P>By its very nature, this scathing satire contains various contemptible
characters who essentially think of no one but themselves, and create that
sort of "Seinfeld" mentality in which the person making the least immoral
mistakes will win, if only by default. The one character that did feature
some conscientious behavior, the football playing popular-boy, struck me as
too big of a moron to appreciate as a true character, but maybe that's just
me. Too goofy, for my taste. One other thing to note is that this film is
definitely a comedy for adults, not for kids! Some teenagers may appreciate
it, but overall, me thinks this feature is geared towards the more cynical
segment of our modern day adult population. All in all, a superb performance
by Reese Witherspoon, a clever script, some funny moments, but ultimately
too similar to RUSHMORE to appreciate as an original story (for me, that
is).</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actress Reese Witherspoon is currently engaged, and carrying the child of
fellow actor Ryan Phillippe. Interesting little story about her from the
IMDb, "Shortly after she started acting she had an audition for a role in
CAPE FEAR (8.5/10). She was supposed to meet with Robert DeNiro and Martin
Scorsese for the audition, but at the time didn't really know who they were.
On the plane she was talking to the man next to her about her audition, and
the man started to rave to her about DeNiro and Scorsese. This made her so
nervous that she completely blew the audition and the role eventually went
to Juliette Lewis."
Matthew Broderick was at one time engaged to actress Helen Hunt, and another
time, to actress Jennifer Grey. He has now been married to actress Sarah
Jessica Parker since May 1997.
For first-time movie actor Chris Klein, it was during his senior year at
Millard West High School in Omaha that he literally bumped into director
Alexander Payne as he was scouting Klein's high school as a possible
location for ELECTION. After an audition for Payne, and only four weeks into
his first semester at Texas Christian University where he is studying
dramatic arts, Klein received the offer to star in ELECTION.
It is also the first time acting gig for actress Jessica Campbell, who plays
Chris Klein's sister in the movie. Her former acting coach asked
writer/director Alexander Payne to take a look at Campbell's audition tape
in consideration for a role in the film, subsequently landing one of the
production's lead roles.
Director Alexander Payne's first feature film was 1996's critically
acclaimed CITIZEN RUTH. Originally from Omaha, Nebraska, Payne received B.A.
degrees in history and Spanish literature from Stanford University. Payne
then earned an M.F.A. from UCLA's prestigious filmmaking program. His thesis
film, THE PASSION OF MARTIN, was screened at the 1991 Sundance Film Festival
and more than 20 other festivals around the world.
A couple of scenes in this film are in obvious homage to director Alfred
Hitchcock's PSYCHO.
This film is based on a novel of the same name by writer Tom Perotta.
Actress Thora Birch left the filming in Omaha on her third day because of
creative differences with director Alexander Payne.</P>
