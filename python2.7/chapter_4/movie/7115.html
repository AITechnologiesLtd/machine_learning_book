<PRE>                           THE ENGLISH PATIENT
                       A film review by Martin Rich
                        Copyright 1997 Martin Rich</PRE>
<P>So much has been written about 'The English Patient' - about its twelve 
Oscar nominations and about the interest that it has generated in 
America and about its relationship with Michael Ondaatje's novel, that 
it's hard to see it without huge expectations.  It is a film on a grand 
scale: its length, and the music, and the huge desert landscapes remind 
us of that, and the principal performances which are grand in their own 
right.</P>
<P>More importantly, the story is strong enough to support such a grand 
interpretation.  There are two intertwined stories, one in Italy during 
the second world war and one in North Africa a few years earlier.  They 
are linked by the English patient - Ralph Fiennes - who in the later 
story has suffered horrific injuries and apparently total amnesia.</P>
<P>In fact the patient isn't English at all - and we much later discover 
that he has every reason to feel bitterness at the English.  But this 
blurring of national identities is important to the film.  Both he and 
the French-Canadian nurse - Juliette Binoche - who cares for him in the 
wartime scenes, are individuals, nomadic and stateless, and are somehow 
united by their individuality.  It's a powerful portrayal of people who 
don't fit into conventional categories, and the characters in the film 
are stronger for their individuality.</P>
<P>The pre-war scenes centre around an affair between the patient and a 
young, recently-married, British woman - Kristin Scott Thomas.  There 
is a poignant remark about leaving different nations behind and trying 
to build something finer - just as the impending war makes this 
impossible.  In some ways that remark seems like a metaphor for 
twentieth century history.  Certainly the film has a lot to say about 
how the characters' patterns of friendship and trust shift as history 
passes.</P>
<P>Exceptional performances include both the principal actresses: Juliette 
Binoche conveys the most extraordinary range of emotions, and Kristin 
Scott Thomas shifts perfectly from the colonial wife to the flirtatious 
mistress.  But Naveen Andrews' performance as the Sikh bomb disposal 
expert, Kip, also deserves mention, especially in a particularly tense 
scene where he tries to defuse a bomb just as tanks are about to pass 
to celebrate the allied victory.</P>
<P>This is cinema for grown-ups, cinema which really works because it 
leaves points for the audience to interpret, and because it works at 
many levels.  Superficially it is an old-fashioned film, with much 
flying in biplanes and many heroic deeds by dashing men in uniform.  
But this is really a mere allusion to such films, and the way that 'The 
English Patient' addresses colonialism is very contemporary.</P>
<P>Look on it purely as a romance and you might be disappointed.  But look 
more deeply at the portrayal of the people, and their dependence on one 
another, and of the cruelty that's sometimes inflicted in the cause of 
patriotism, and this is one of the most memorable and moving films that 
I have seen.</P>
