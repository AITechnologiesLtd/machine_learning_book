Michael Rapaport, Bill Pullman</PRE>
<P>    Some decades ago, I thought that famous actors and TV
stars were not really people like the ones you see every day
on the street and assumed, therefore, that they did not have
the usual needs and wants.  I was puzzled, then, by the
articles that filled the pages in the supermarket tabloids,
particularly the most popular magazine of its time,
"Confidential," which talked incessantly about the marriages
and divorces of Hollywood personalities.  Somehow I believed
that celebrities filled up their lives with their work and had no
time or inclinations for the usual domestic adventures that
most of us took for granted, nor did they use their money for
their own trivial pursuits separate from what they needed for
their careers.  Had I seen "Lucky Numbers" thirty years ago, I
might have given up that image, because in Nora Ephron's
new comedy, scripted by Adam Resnick, a television
personality acclaimed by just about everyone in his area of
Pennsylvania is famous enough, but he is perpetually in debt,
regularly thinking up business schemes to create personal
wealth, and dependent on the pleasures of the bed provided
for him by yet another TV celebrity.</P>
<P>   With "Lucky Numbers," Nora Ephron no longer capitalizes
on her signature efforts such as the airy, romantic, laugh-out-
loud comedy "When Harry Met Sally" and the milder but
captivating "You've Got Mail," nor does she exploit the
quirkiness of her box-office flop "Michael," which showed that
an angel might be scruffy and randy but could still perform
heartwarming miracles during a periodic sojourn to earth. 
Instead, Ephron has dished up an unfunny caper story filled
with sloppy acting by John Travolta, a gruesome script for the
usually whimsical Bill Pullman, and a moronic and repetitive
set of thuggish actions for Michael Rapaport.  Were Tim Roth
not available for the side role of a malefactor's counselor,
"Lucky Numbers" would have been a thoroughly unamusing
yarn.</P>
<P>   If one thing could be said in the picture's favor, the
narrative does show us that some of the most confident,
popular, hale-fellows-well-met that appear on the tube are
thoroughly stupid and self-destructive when not basking in the
limelight of the studios or the adulation of the crowds who
bestow endless praise upon them.  In the role of Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania TV weatherman Russ Richards--who when we
first meet him believes he has everything--John Travolta
heads gleefully from home to his private space in the parking
lot of station WTPA, puts on a show, and is regularly
petitioned for snapshots by his fans who apparently like the
guy's friendly but cartoonish manner while reporting the day's
clime.  In debt for bad investments (currently a large store
selling snowmobiles which languish because of a dearth of
snow), he receives advice from his buddy, Gig (Tim Roth), to
team up on a scam with Crystal Latroy (Lisa Kudrow). 
Crystal, who has a gorgeous body to which she allows
access to both her boss, Dick Simmons (Ed O'Neill) and to
Richards, is responsible for drawing the numbers for
the Pennsylvania lottery on the same network that employs
Richards.  Together, Crystal and Russ concoct a scheme
involving Crystal's dim-witted, asthmatic uncle
Walter (Michael Moore) to fix the drawing so that the six
million dollar jackpot would be awarded to them, but through
a series of mishaps easily avoidable if the perps had half a
brain between them, they are hit upon but a succession of
thugs for a share of the booty.</P>
<P>   When a sometimes amusing script is wrecked by a director
whose sense of comic timing is off, the result is a flat piece of
work that wastes the talent of such notables as Lisa Kudrow
(who displayed her broad range in "The Opposite of Sex" but
who this time around simply mouths obscenities), and
Michael Rapaport (amusing enough when in the hands of
Woody Allen but who now performs as an airheaded thug
who commits mayhem with celebrity baseball bats).  To
nobody's good luck, this picture plays strictly by the numbers. </P>
