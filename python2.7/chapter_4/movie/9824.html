<PRE>Sorcerer (1977)
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
(C) 1997 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: A haunting remake of the French classic THE WAGES OF FEAR, which
takes on a vicious life of its own.</P>
<P>In principle I'm against remakes. Rare is the remake that is not a pallid
carbon copy of its predecessor, as was the case with the wretched DIABOLIQUE
(which, ironically enough, was created by the same man who also created
WAGES, Henri-Georges Clouzot). SORCERER is by William Friedkin and manages
to escape that trap through a show of surreal visual power. The movie
lingers in the mind long after others have evaporated, if for no other
reason than because it presents us with some really astonishing things to
look at.</P>
<P>Unlike the previous movie, which confined itself more or less to one locale,
SORCERER spends its first forty-five minutes globe-hopping and setting up
its four main characters. Nilo (Francisco Rabal) is a cold and dispassionate
killer of international repute. Kassem (Anidou) is a Palestinian terrorist.
Victor Manzon (Bruno Cremer), a French financial whiz, has a wife he loves
dearly, but he is forced to abandon her when a business deal goes south and
a partner kills himself. Finally, Scanlon (Roy Scheider) is a smalltime
Jersey hood who has to flee the country when he offends a mob boss by
knocking over the poor box in his church.</P>
<P>Three of them flee to an unidentified Central American country -- with all
the globehopping, it's the only locale that's not announced with a title
card -- and hide out as menial laborers for an oil company. The country is
overseen by a military junta; life is meager and hateful. There's no way out
-- until a well accident forces the company to scrounge for suicide drivers.
They need someone who can drive four cases of *sweating* dynamite (which
could explode for no reason at all) across 218 miles of jungle. The fourth,
the assassin, shows up later (he's been sent after Scanlon) and is roped
into the mission after a disaster forces them to get another man.</P>
<P>The movie quickly sets itself up as a case study in desperation. All of them
want out: the money promised by the company for the job will set them free,
but there's a good chance they'll blow themselves up in the attempt. They
have to build two trucks to haul the stuff more or less from scratch. The
odds they face are sickening: outdated maps, bad weather, and a rope bridge
they have to drive BOTH trucks across. (This last scene is most astonishing
for a number of reasons, not the least of which being that it appears to
have been totally unfaked.) At one point they are stopped cold by a fallen
tree; at another, they are held at gunpoint by soldiers. There's no easy way
out of anything -- not even death, which comes all too easy for the wrong
reasons. All of this is set to a mesmerizing and eerie Tangerine Dream score
that is well worth seeking out.</P>
<P>SORCERER is agonizing and draining, and in the end, highly existential. It's
not a movie you feel like celebrating life with, but it stays with you long
after it vanishes from your eyes. Comparing it with its original isn't
really the best thing to do -- better to see it as a brother. A very twisted
and ugly brother, but a brother nonetheless.</P>
