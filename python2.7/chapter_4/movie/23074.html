<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Hollywood has no courtesy to the older actors of their previous time. It seems
that countless films today feature an entire cast under 30 or treat old people
as the running joke, both of these have happened in a handful of films from the
past year. When older actors (or actors over 40) do get really good roles, it's
usually in a small independent picture that will be playing in the dark and
scary section of town in a small theater where you would never dare to go at
night. So let's broaden that phrase, Hollywood has no respect for people in
general. Not to mention animals. Which is why I was very concerned walking into
The Tigger Movie, one of Disney's Thanksgiving to June animated features (much
like The Goofy Movie) that is designed to hold us down until the big Disney
animated opus comes out in June. If Pooh and the gang were treated as a
throwaway film, imagine what that could do to disgrace the entire set of
classic featurettes and the future of the franchise. Fans of Pooh's earlier
adventures (kids and adults alike) will find plenty to be excited about, as
there are only a few things that have changed.</P>
<P>Tigger is feeling energetic, but alas, there is no one to bounce with. While
trying to find a bouncing partner, he interrupts the rest of the gang who are
trying to move a boulder off of Eeyore's house and they inform him that they
can't bounce with him because they are not Tiggers and can't keep up. Feeling
lonely he begins thinking. With the help of one of the six fabulous musical
numbers, he decides that there must be a Tigger family out there somewhere in
the Hundred Acre Wood. A suggestion of a Tigger family tree from Owl is all he
needs to go bounding off into the forest leaving the rest of his friends
behind.</P>
<P>There seems to be a very low chance of finding other Tiggers, so Roo (who tags
along with Tigger in almost all of his daily bouncing and non-bouncing
activities) gets the gang together and they decide on a plan. They will write a
letter to Tigger, pretending to be Tigger's family. This only complicates
things, Tigger thinks the letter says they will be coming to visit him tomorrow
and soon they are painting stripes on themselves and trying to dress up Eeyore
as one of Tigger's relatives.</P>
<P>Not a very complicated plot, but it's not a very complicated movie. The
original drawings of the Hundred Acre Wood were copied with the greatest of
skill and the result is remarkable. The beautiful forest that these creatures
live in always manages to be a feast for the eyes throughout the entire movie.
But there is also a rather large use of actual animation, drawn by actual
hands, in the characters as well. While some sequences are obviously digitally
animated, most of the rough black lines that outline the original cartoons are
still there, as well as a humorous change to the title sequence. Jim Cummings,
who's been Pooh and Tigger on the TV show and in the made-for-video movies does
a great job with his two characters, but the rest of the cast falls short. Even
Eeyore (who makes more amusing comments than ever before) seems to have lost
some of his depressed touch. The film also brings out Roo as a major character,
Roo wants Tigger to be his big brother and his constant idolizing (it's almost
worship) of him is the only thing that bugged me about the movie. Everything
also manages to keep fairly un-modernized while a funny song regarding the
family of Tiggers (that includes a homage to Marilyn Monroe) is sure to please
adults, there isn't much else going on. I kept waiting for Christopher Robin to
say, "Hold on, I have to go check my e-mail." Or, "Let's go play Pokemon
instead." But he didn't.</P>
<P>This one is definitely not suited for a video rental, it's rich colors are
grrreat and it may be the only time you ever see the gang on the big screen.
It's message is easy for children to grasp and kept the kids (and the EXTREMELY
NOISY teenage girls behind me) interested. But if you do need to go to
Blockbuster (or you are searching through your huge closet of movies you own)
take the time to see the original three Pooh featurettes, I bet you won't see
much of a difference. While I know it's cliched to say this, Walt would be
proud.</P>
