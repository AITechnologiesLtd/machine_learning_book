<P>   If we accept the premise that most parents want some day
to be grandparents, we'd have to go along with the view that
most parents would be disappointed to discover that their
only son or daughter is gay.  What should they do about the
situation?  The psychologically healthy folks would accept
reality and not make an issue of their frustration.  In New
York, some even cover up their discouragement by marching
in gay parades with signs reading "I'm proud of my gay son
(or daughter)."  Neither of these situations would make for an
amusing movie, so in her directorial debut, Jamie Babbit
plays with a bright premise, then proceeds to make a hash of
her film.</P>
<P>    "But I'm a Cheerleader" shows the influence of the
eminent John Waters on Ms. Babbitt, who even uses a
Waters favorite, Mink Stole, in the role of an Edith Bunker-
like parent.  But Babbitt repeatedly pulls back when her story
is on the verge of laugh-out-loud antics with the result that
her satire is at once too amiable and too obvious.</P>
<P>   The best thing about the movie is the casting of young
Natasha Lyonne ("Slums of Beverly Hills," "American Pie") in
the key role of Megan, a teenaged cheerleader whom her
parents suspect of being a lesbian.  What seems to give her
away to her folks is her fondness for tofu and vegetarianism--
yet despite her posting of a female pin-up in her high-school
locker, she is yet unaware of her own tendencies.  When her
dad, Mr. Bloomfield ("Harold and Maude"'s Bud Court) and
her mom (Mink Stole) whisk her off to a so-called
rehabilitation camp modeled on a series of steps like
Alcoholics Anonymous, Megan finally confronts her
homosexual tendencies when she develops on mad crush on
fellow inmate, Graham ("Girl, Interrupted"'s Clea DuVall). 
The young men and women who share bunks in the lodge
are all gay, all sent by their parents to be "straightened" out
by homophobic director Mary (Cathy Moriarty)--who employs
ex-gay Mike (drag performer Ru Paul Charles) to assign
manly chores like repairing cars to the guys while she
dispenses classes like diaper changing to the young women.</P>
<P>   Production designer Rachel Kamerman has conceived the
girls' rooms in bright pastel colors as befits this candy-coated,
emasculated satire,  making the thoroughly obvious point that
traditional America wants its women to be pretty in pink. 
Stereotypes abound, the homophobic Mary contrived as a
fundamentalist Christian while the boys and girls under her
tutelage with the exception of Graham and Megan are
nerdish, dull, even androgynous.  The picture has just a few
unintentional laughs, the enterprise coming not even close in
quality to Rose Troche's 1994 intelligently funny "Go Fish."</P>
