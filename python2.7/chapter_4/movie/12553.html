Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</P>
<P>     Terry Gilliam's FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS is about as faithful
an adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's 1971 "gonzo journalism" classic as I
can imagine...though that's not necessarily a good thing.  The book has
long been called "unfilmable," which probably referred more to whether it
_should_ be made than whether it _could_ be made.  As it happens, FEAR AND
LOATHING on film is nearly an event-for-event re-creation of the
adventures of journalist Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his attorney Dr.
Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro), kindred spirits who ingest every possible
controlled substance during a wild spree through Vegas, ostensibly while
covering an off-road race and/or a law enforcement narcotics conference.
It's wild, perverse, incoherent, sometimes very funny, and too visually
literal an adaptation of a book best left to a twisted imagination.</P>
<P>     In terms of tone, at least, it's a nearly flawless companion piece to
Thompson's book.  The writer's descriptions of tripping on everything from
acid to mescaline to ether never assaulted the reader with horror stories
of harrowing experiences.  They were essentially journalistic, clinical
analyses where even the most unpleasant situations were softened with a
dollop of deadpan, left-field humor.  Gilliam similarly finds the demented
gag in every situation, including a hallucinogenic orgy of lounge lizards
(rendered as actual reptiles by makeup whiz Rob Bottin), while still
acknowledging the squalor.  With Depp doing a hilariously spot-on
performance of Thompson-as-Duke and Del Toro sporting plenty of extra flab
as the unhinged Dr. Gonzo, FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS feels exactly
like it should feel:  a cockeyed white-water rafting tour down a polluted
stream of consciousness.</P>
<P>     It's also true that an episodic film like FEAR AND LOATHING is only
as successful as its individual episodes.  Some of the most memorable ones
are grand pieces of absurdist theater:  Duke trying to skip out on a hotel
bill as a desk clerk detains him; Duke and Gonzo doing coke at the
narcotics conference while surrounded by cops; a flashback to Duke's first
acid trip in a nightclub restroom.  There are also several scenes which
turn absolute fidelity to the source material into grinding sluggishness.
At nearly two hours, FEAR AND LOATHING could have used some judicious
trimming; once we understand the situation and the characters, encounters
like Gonzo's showdown with a diner waitress (Ellen Barkin) feel like
excess weight.  A head-trip film like this one is better suited for 90
minutes of damn-the-torpedoes pacing than for this kind of reverence.</P>
<P>     Gilliam also manages to extract Thompson's one and only "message"
regarding the drug culture of the 60s and early 70s.  The film's temporal
setting -- "this foul Year of Our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-one"
-- is defined as a turning point in the use and perception of drugs, with
the innocent notion of chemicals as reality-expanding tools giving way to
chemicals as reality-numbing tools.  Even here Gilliam's fidelity to the
source undermines him, as images of Vietnam and Nixon point a too-obvious
accusatory finger, with Thompson's own unapologetic voice subverted by
suggestions that he's just a victim of the times.  The audience for a film
as down and dirty as this one is limited anyway, but the now-anachronistic
incorrectness man not even appeal to the like-minded.</P>
<P>     FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS does do a solid job of capturing the
era's madness in a city which is a madhouse distillation of the American
dream; it's a scattershot rendering of a scattershot story told with
scattershot effectiveness.  It's also consistently intriguing, if for no
other reason than Gilliam's willingness to go every ugly place Thompson's
book went.  The only thing really wrong with Gilliam's FEAR AND LOATHING
is that it's a movie, bringing into vivid color that which should only
have lived on the page.  Gonzo film-making doesn't end up with quite the
same rebellious spark.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Strip trips:  6.</PRE>
