<P>        Chinese films are not known for their sumptuousness in production, and
their extravagant design in film. In most cases, the films are produced by
the film organization, and the director has a film he wants to make. This
film, is a break from tradition. This is a major undertaking, and film, and
it shows it. It has all the magnificent things that make an Akira
Kurosawa's RAN, or a David Lean's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, the two films that
one might say, it closely resembles in production style. It has the
cinematography and music to match, which makes this an absolute must see
film, and experience.</P>
<P>        THE EMPEROR'S SHADOW, is the story of one of the first attempts to unite
China, 200 years BC. But unlike another story that deals with merciless
rulers, this one has an edge. This leader thinks that the one thing that
might unite his kingdom, is "hearts and minds", rather than politics. And
the trigger for him, is a young man he had befriended in his earlier days,
when he himself was almost killed. He had been playing music at the site
where people were being punished with their lives. This friendship did not
continue easily. As the new leader slowly defeats the other kingdoms, and
makes a serious attempt at uniting China, he finaly comes to the last three
he has to face. Two of them are easily enough done. The third is tougher.
Gaio Jianli is now a well known musician and instrument maker, and the new
emperor wants him to be a part of the new Empire, as a composer. However,
there are serious oppositions to his choice of ambassadors for the public
campiagns. Most of the aristocratic party of his, is opposed to his naming
the musician to the court.</P>
<P>        As Gaio gets brought to the court, he undertakes a fast, and is finaly
taken out of it by the emperor's first daughter, who had been disabled and
could not walk. Their union, is dangerous, as the daughter has been offered
to one of the more important generals, who has been with the emperor from
the start. But Ying's desire is the musician, and their courtship is
outlawed. Which creates serious problems for every one around. In one
scene, the emperor has to undo the honor of his subjects by revealing that
they are not as clean and honorable as they make it sound. That their
concern is for all the things that they themselves are doing, instead of
the larger picture. This may have been right, but the political forces, are
trying like crazy to undermine the new emperor, and they are getting
stronger. Towards the end, the new Emperor is ready to be crowned, but he
has lost his important general, who was to be married off to Ying. The
general, it seems, decided that his new wife was a whore and killed her,
and the two servants of the crown killed him at that moment. All signs
point to the political adversaries as having gotten the victory here. And
that this victory is likely to be short lived since they do not really
support the new emperor in his quest to unite China in a meaningful way.
Many of them think that Gaio was the problem in the first place and should
have been done away with.</P>
<P>        A rather complicated story, and one that states that the kingdom lasted
only 15 years, but set the tone for the ones to come in the future. China
has had since then a rather complicated aristocracy, who has ruled the
masses, and is likely to fall into other hands, should this control
dissipate, or fall into competing interests, which at this time are not
exactly clear, or visible.</P>
<P>        What makes this film important, is its sumptuous nature, and beautiful
design, and care in so many details, as to make this a very important film,
and unlike any others that have come out of China in the past several
years. Up until now, many of the film makers have displayed a personal
story. This film is much less personal as a complete entity, although its
story is not. It deals with what might become of the future.</P>
<P>        The most outstanding thing in this film, and all of it is magnificent, is
undoubtedly the music of Zhao Jiping, who is demontrating his immense
ability, and shows that he is a major composer, not only for film, but all
of music as well. The soundtrack here is magnificent, and stands out
through out the whole film. Add careful visuals, and beautifully
photographed stuff, and you have the makings of a superb film.</P>
<P>        By all standards, the film is extremely modern. One always got the feel
that many other films from China were of lesser design, whereas this film
has a major studio like production and design, which China has not been
known for in film.</P>
<P>        With excellent perfomrances, this is a must see for true film lovers.
There are not many films that come off with such aplomb as this one does,
and it s directed with extreme care, and attention to detail.</P>
