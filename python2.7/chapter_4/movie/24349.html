<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P> Incest.  Treachery. Betrayal.  Videotape.</P>
<P> No, I'm not talking about the new version of Hamlet.  I'm talking about
The War Zone, a 21st century Kitchen Sink drama helmed by Brit
actor-who-should-stay-an-actor Tim Roth.</P>
<P> Tim Roth, who somewhere along the line got tired of being the butt of
European jokes in Quentin Tarantino movies has decided to move along and
become a director.  Rather than use his vast experience in films with
good stories to write his own script, he decided to take Alexander
Stuart's script for The War Zone as his first project.</P>
<P> The War Zone is the story of a London family who moves out into the
British boondocks.  Soon after moving to said boondocks, the wife (Tilda
Swinton) has a third child, the dad (Ray Winstone) starts getting
restless, and Tom (Freddie Cunliffe) discovers that daddy has been
getting it on with his sister Jessie (Lara Belmont).  Being a pathetic
virgin and having Fruedian issues besides, Tom spends about two hours
debating the `will I / won't I' that you can see done much better in any
rendition of Hamlet, all the while videotaping Dad and Jessie getting it
on in the W.W.II. Bunker nearby and struggling with his own sexual
morals.</P>
<P> If this sounds interesting in this slightest, I have failed.</P>
<P> The War Zone is a movie that is so boring that I would have walked out,
were I not a critic.  It wastes minute after minute of time spent in
utter silence as Tom watches the family do some particularly nasty thing
to itself.  This is just bad storytelling.  It's repetitive, unpleasant,
sensationalistic, and only serves as a metaphor for the first five
minutes (the next time Roth want to illustrate how much time has passed,
how about doing a montage instead of the same basic scene five different
times).</P>
<P> As one would expect from a movie by an actor, the acting is above par.
Swinton is especially good as the mother of a family tearing itself
apart from the inside out, and Lara Belmont's presence as the sexually
abused daughter is probably the only role in which any real dimension is
apparent.</P>
<P>After boring everyone for an hour and forty-five minutes, The War Zone
stops.  Unlike most films that stop and don't really end, I was glad
that The War Zone was over.  I wanted out of the theatre.  Pronto.</P>
<P>Face it, Mr. Roth: The Kitchen Sink drama is dead and it died for a
reason.  Don't try to revive it.</P>
<PRE>2 stars
