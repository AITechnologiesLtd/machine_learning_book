<PRE>`Austin Powers  -– Still Putting the GRRR in Swingrrr, Baby
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>If there's one thing I admire about Austin Powers-the man (Mike Myers),
it's that he has a boundless amount of energy and feel-good silliness
that could make the grayest skies turn blue.  He's a manic, I
want-to-fight-evil-and-shag machine that's constantly working in
overdrive.   Austin Powers will always be the man that every girl wants
and the only one who can thwart the mad schemes of power-hungry Dr.
Evil (also played by Mike Myers).  Dr. Evil knows that he can't defeat
Powers because the latter possesses something called ‘mojo', the
essence of what makes a man a man.  Having this enables a person to
have confidence, appeal, and ‘shagability'.   Powers's mojo is
especially strong.  So, he plans to steal it.  He presumes that if
Powers is mojoless, he won't have the self-confidence needed to defeat
him.  But as the story progresses, Powers learns a life-affirming
lesson that ‘mojo' isn't what makes a man.  It's something far greater
than what his playful mind can ever imagine.  And what is it?  I think
that Austin, between shags, is still trying to figure it out.</P>
<P>If you've seen the first `Austin Powers,' then you're already familiar
with the premise of this film.  At its core, it is a parody of every
James Bond flick that has ever been released.  And for the most part,
it'll put a smile on your face.  You have the femme fatales with the
libidinous names such as Robin Swallows and Ivana Humpalott.  Power's
also teams up with a CIA operative (Heather Graham) named Felicity
Shagwell (`Shagwell in name and shag very well in reputation,' she
growls).  There is the standout henchman with an oddball name who
possesses a special evil talent, in this case named Fat Bastard (also
played by Myers).  There are the secret lairs hidden beneath volcanoes
and even a pursuit that takes everyone to the moon where Dr. Evil hopes
to execute his grand plan.</P>
<P>Each of these elements is milked for all its worth and these kinds of
silly exaggerations are something that any James Bond-loving fan can
laugh at.  But there are also the nuggets of comedy that make this more
enjoyable than the standard parody. 
The opening credits features Powers strutting stark naked through a
hotel, but manages to hide his ‘jewels' from the audiences' view by
cleverly standing behind a large banana, a loaf of French bread, a
carefully placed pinwheel, and other assorted, suggestive items. 
Another clever sequence involved a series of scenes featuring people
all unknowingly making references to a man's sexual organ.  This is a
scene that must be watched in order to be appreciated.  I also like his
underappreciated, underloved son (Seth Green).  He and his evil father
go on the Jerry Springer show where his Dad says, `you are the Diet
Coke of evil – just one calorie – not evil enough.'  </P>
<P>What made the first one super-groovy, however, was that Austin and Dr.
Evil were products of the ‘60s, living in the '90.  They were both
absurdly out of touch with reality, and that was funny.  This obvious
target for laughs is not exploited here, and it instead relies on a
formula of straight parody.  The result sometimes borders on
Saturday-Night-Live-Skit-Mediocrity.  Half-way through the film, laughs
were harder to come by and too much time was devoted to Fat Bastard,
whom I found annoying.  Fortunately, Mike Myers shows commitment to his
character and zest for his antics.  What's not to like?</P>
