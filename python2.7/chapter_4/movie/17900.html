<P>A children's tour group is shuffled through an air traffic control center
and while the tour guide is trying to make his usual informative speech, one
nerdy little kid observes that air traffic controllers have one of the
highest stress jobs imaginable.  Describing the job that leads many of them
to become alcoholics, insomniacs, nervous wrecks, air traffic controller
Nick Falzone (John Cusack) says: "You forgot suicide, kid".  Suicide in this
line of work doesn't just mean the loss of life.  There are many ways to die
in this job.  Three mistakes in two and a half years by allowing planes to
come too close to each other on your radar screen means your job is killed.
Having an affair with a colleague's wife can mean the death of your
marriage.  And remaining in the building when a bomb threat becomes a
serious threat can indeed kill you.</P>
<P>What makes 'Pushing Tin' work so well the way it does is that the film is
layered with many whimsical anecdotes and makes a tediously old story of
marital infidelity seem fresh and alive with short controlled burst of
laughter rather than genuine belly laughs.</P>
<P>Nick's fellow colleagues in the air traffic control business are the kind of
people you want to socialize with.  They keep a sense of humour about
themselves during the most stressful points on the job.  They often place
bets on a colleagues performance and frantically exchange the money between
themselves when the payoff comes.  They often get together for barbecues,
play pool and drink while toasting to their job which, believe it or not, is
a real marvel.  An observation made in the film is that an air traffic
controller is responsible for more lives in one day on the job than a
surgeon is for his entire career.  The story is set around the New York City
area where three airports, JFK, LaGuardia and Newark International are all
within twenty miles of one another.  Incidents involving planes flying too
close to one another appear to be a regular thing if you believe the display
of events in this film.  I'm sure this will cause a lot of talk among
aviation analysts, the general public and air traffic controllers themselves
as well as the Federal Aviation Administration as to just how accurate this
information is.</P>
<P>Nick seems to be a happily married man.  His wife Connie (Cate Blanchett -
Oscar nominee from 'Elizabeth') is a loving wife and they have two kids.
Their lives are turned upside down by the arrival of Russell Bell (Billy Bob
Thornton) and his sex pot wife Mary (Angelina Jolie).  Russell is a
colleague of Nick's who has worked as an air traffic controller in many
locations around the U.S. and Nick has a one night stand with Mary while
Connie says she slept with Russell although we don't know if this ever
happened since we don't see it.</P>
<P>What makes the film work is that many of the scenes involving infidelity and
the talk surrounding it have many injections of off beat humour that are
appealing and director Mike Newell ('Donnie Brasco'), directs 'Pushing Tin'
in the same manner he did with 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'.  There is a
zany but realistic flare emphasized in the film's comic moments and pushing
tin is a slang expression which refers to the job an air traffic controller
has of directing huge aircraft safely through the skies of the world's most
hectic city.</P>
<P>The strikingly original screenplay is by Glen Charles and Les Charles based
on an article by Darcy Frey entitled 'Something's Got to Give').  The film's
score is also very entertaining and is by Oscar winner Anne Dudley ('The
Full Monty').</P>
<P>What's most interesting about this film is the excellent performance of John
Cusack.  Cusack has denied himself the opportunity to become a huge star
like Tom Cruise, Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford.  A group he can easily fit
into but he has instead purposely opted for the quirky and off beat roles
he's enjoyed and is one of the best actors out there.  But more than that is
the bizarre, and at times hilarious performance of Billy Bob Thornton.  He
has made a habit of playing bizarre and unorthodox characters in 'Sling
Blade' and 'A Simple Plan'.  And if you liked him in those films, don't miss
'Pushing Tin'.  His character in this film enjoys mind games, sleeping
through possible traffic accidents where he may be a victim, shooting hoops
without missing very often, and standing under 747's as they fly over his
head upon landing on runways and the concussion of the plane's sweeping
force lifts him off his feet and hurls him many feet into nearby fields
where he laughs his head off upon hitting the ground.  He reminds you off a
circus performer and free spirit at the same time.  All in keeping with the
film's general theme which is a balanced and totally redeemable comedy for
adults.  You may not want to fly for a while after seeing the movie as it
plays on the paranoia of air travel the way 'Jaws' played on the paranoia of
going swimming in the ocean.</P>
