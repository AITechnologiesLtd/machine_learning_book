<P>Susan Granger's review of "JAKOB THE LIAR" (Columbia Pictures)</P>
<P>I suspect that if "Life is Beautiful" had not won last year's
Oscar, this Holocaust film would be more appreciated. Unfortunately,
the similarities are superficially apparent - revolving around a
whimsical, imprisoned Jew who keeps hope alive and shields a small
child amidst the Nazi atrocities. In this adaptation of Jurek Becker's
1969 best-seller by French writer/director Peter Kassovitz, Robin
Williams plays Jakob, the latke (pancake) maker, who lives in a Polish
ghetto. He's a widower who gets caught, allegedly after curfew, and
sent to Gestapo headquarters where he overhears a radio bulletin
indicating that Russian forces are advancing on Warsaw. Cautiously
making his way home, he encounters a ten year-old girl (Hannah Taylor
Gordon), an Anne Frank look-alike, whose parents were taken to a
concentration camp and, sympathetically, shelters her. The next
morning, Jakob is so excited about the war news that he confides it to
one friend who tells another, who tells another, who tells
another. Soon the gritty ghetto is humming, and the assumption is that
Jakob has a forbidden radio on which he heard the broadcast. Suddenly
Jakob becomes a celebrity, a reluctant hero because of his wishful
thinking. "My crowning achievement: latkes and lies," he moans. But
it's this dark joke, a sunny day, and a hopeful rumor that helped a
few doomed Jews survive in 1944. Despite an awkward, indulgent
screenplay, Robin Williams delivers a solid, restrained
characterization, supported by Liev Schreiber, Alan Arkin, Armin
Mueller-Stahl, and Bob Balaban. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Jakob the Liar" is a serio-comic 7. Curious side-note: Kassovitz sent
the script to Robin Williams because he thought Williams was
Jewish. He isn't, but he found the concept intriguing.</P>
