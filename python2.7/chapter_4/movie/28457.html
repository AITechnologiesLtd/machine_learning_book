<PRE>DIVIDED WE FALL
---------------</PRE>
<P>Josef Cizek (Boleslav Polivka) is saddened when the Jewish Weiner family,
who provided employment to his Czech town, are ejected from their homes by
the Nazis and sent to a camp.  Josef must also endure visits from Horst
Prohazka (Jaroslav Dusek), a German he befriended and employed before the
war who obviously has romantic inclinations towards Josef's wife Marie 
(Anna Siskova).  When David Weiner escapes and returns to his hometown,
the Cizeks hide him in their storeroom and try to keep Horst off guard in
the 2000 Best Foreign Language Film nominee "Divided We Fall."</P>
<P>Roberto Benigni started a trend with "Life Is Beautiful."  While "Divided We
Fall" doesn't provide as many laughs as the Benigni film, it's more comical
than tragic and lays on the sentiment with a more cynical touch.  Director
Jan Hrebejk has crafted a humanistic story about 'what abnormal times can do to
normal people.'</P>
<P>Everyone in their town knows that Josef and Marie are childless through no
choice of their own.  The onset of WWII and the dissolution of the Weiner
factory has made Josef content to eat, smoke and lay on his couch while
Marie busies herself dusting the tapestry of her namesake, the Virgin Mother,
which hangs above it.</P>
<P>Horst, sporting a Hitler-like moustache, brings forbidden delicacies to his
former boss and his pretty wife.  Josef had befriended Horst when his fellow
Czechs didn't exactly welcome the German, and now that the tide has turned in
Horst's favor, must endure his prodding to come and join him working for the
SS Officer (Vladimir Marek) who's taken over the Weiner villa.</P>
<P>When David Weiner (Csongor Kassai) becomes their hidden secret, Josef and
Marie must play increasingly dangerous games to keep Horst's suspicions at
bay, until, at last, Marie concocts a false pregnancy which the sterile Josef
insists she make real with the assistance of David.</P>
<P>While Hrebejk's biblical references and baby making slapstick become somewhat 
labored, his gentle comedy nonetheless stands true to his title, where no man 
is condemned merely by the side history doles out for him.  Hrebejk is 
particularly blessed by a stellar performance from Dusek, whose initially 
coarse Horst is redeemed by the subtle complexities the actor brings to the 
man.</P>
