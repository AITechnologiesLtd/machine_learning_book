<P>TRAINING  DAY (2001) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke,
Scott Glen, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dog, Macy Gray and Tom Berenger.
Written by David Ayer. Directed by Antoine Fuqua. Rated R. </P>
<P> It's usually exciting to see an actor with a good-guy reputation putting on the
black hat and trying to portray the villain. </P>
<P> That is the main reason I was interested in Training Day, in which Denzel
Washington shucks his Boy Scout image to play Alonzo Harris, a veteran narcotics
officer, a rogue cop who crosses the line until there is not much difference
between himself and those he has sworn to put away. </P>
<P> But Washington's larger-than-life image is so burned into our psyches, that it
hard to accept him as a corrupt narc. The question arises, "Who's problem is
that  the audience's or the actor's? </P>
<P> In this case, it's a little of both. Washington cannot totally commit to the
dark side. His Harris is a deadly, charismatic, unpredictable charmer, always
ready with a laugh or a smile. He also can strike with the suddenness of a
rattler. </P>
<P> Good actor that he is, Washington tries to present a complex persona, not
allowing his Harris to plunge totally to the depths. His Harris, though
dangerous and deadly, is too flamboyant. Washington has not been able - or not
allowed himself - to totally immerse himself into his character's rank nature.</P>
<P> Training Day is a violent outing about the first day on the job for a new
narcotics officer, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). One of the movie's biggest problems
is that Hawke is a cipher. He is too wooden, too overwhelmed by Washington's
personality to find a voice as strong as that of his partner's. </P>
<P> Hawke spends most of the movie in Washington's shadow. His character lacks
vigor and verve. His Hoyt is emotionally light and his physical presence is too
slight to be considered an on-screen equal. He is too unworldly, too naive to be
a counterpoint to Washington's illicit dynamo. </P>
<P> The story, though, is interesting to follow, as hints to the main plot are
dropped here and there and in rather oblique ways. </P>
<P> The film begins unraveling during a scene featuring one of the most lame
coincidences ever put on screen. This sequence  which started out so promising 
drags the rest of the film down with it. </P>
<P> Still, the movie is a star turn for Washington. As Harris, he swaggers, struts
and parades around like a one-man band. He is a conniving con artist, ostensibly
trying to teach a rookie officer the way of the street, while continuing to plot
his secret agenda. </P>
<P> Nothing rings true here. The film has the feel of playing-acting cops, not
life-on-the-street police. Plus, it features one of those down-and-dirty fights
that would land lesser mortals such as us in the hospital for a month or two,
but from which both antagonists merely stumble away with the usual phony film
limp. </P>
<P> Training Day is a glorified lesser feature that does nothing for the careers of
either of its stars. Motivation is questionable, the script needed some more
polish and some of the action is cartoonish. </P>
<P> It may satisfy Washington's legions of fans, but that is as far as it goes. </P>
