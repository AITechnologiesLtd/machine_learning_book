<PRE>The Hurricane Review</PRE>
<P>  "The Hurricane" is hands down the most powerful film of 1999. Although it has
a few minor flaws, one can't help hide it's uplifting message, not to mention a
breakthrough for both Denzel Washington and director Norman Jewison.
  As you may or may not know, the film follows the life of the famous boxer
Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, Hurricane being his nickname. The film starts out
with a murder that was pinned on Rubin, but only we know that he's been
wrongfully accused. The story then focuses on a young boy named Lesra
(Vicellous Reon Shannon), who is struggling in life as well, until he reads the
autobiography of Rubin Carter, which gives him a little inspiration. So the
background story of Rubin basically unfolds as Lesra reads the novel. After he
finishes the book, he is determined to help Rubin out by any means, and he does
with a little help from his friends (Liev Schriber, Deborah Kara Unger and John
Hannah). This leads us to the 2nd part of the film, in which all 4 people
investigate the crime, so that they can give Rubin Carter a fair trial.
  I'll admit, I thought the trailer was a bit sappy, but I must have came into
the movie with an open heart, because I was blown away by it's emotional
impact. Sure it was formulaic and had a simple premise, but there was far more
to it then. A story is only a small portion of the film. The film's messages
are what really worked here, not to mention Denzel Washington's performance,
which I will get into later. The film mainly deals with the racism (in the
first half of the film) towards black men and woman during the 60's, and how
they were treated improperly, while the second half dealt with the inner
struggle to survive with love and hate by your side. It may not seem like much
in words, but is far more descriptive on screen. Absolutely uplifting.
  Unfortunately there are a few flaws. The whole investigation in the film
seemed to have brought it down a notch. I would have rather seen more of
Washington or something with meaning rather than these empty scenes. It just
didn't quite fit. Also as I said before, it is a typical Hollywood film with a
formulaic story. If it was not for that, it would have easily been an excellent
film, but it falls slightly below that. 
  Now for the real knockout in the film, Denzel Washington. Not only is this
his greatest performance, but it's also the best of 99. If someone else was in
his position, I doubt it would have been as believable, nor as powerful. He
delivered here big time. He's got an Oscar Nomination in the bag, maybe even a
win as well. Everyone else in the film did a good job as well.
  Director Norman Jewison has a hit on his hands for once. I have never really
been impressed with his work (with the exception of Moonstruck) up until now.
He has outdone himself and it's about time he's put his good direction skills
to work.
  I suggest you go see "The Hurricane" ASAP, because quite frankly next to "The
Green Mile" and "Toy Story 2" it's one of the best films playing in theaters
now. A must see.</P>
