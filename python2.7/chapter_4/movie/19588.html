<PRE>                             DEEP BLUE SEA
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     It's been a few years since a good shark movie, and while LAKE
PLACID played games with the monster movie genre, DEEP BLUE SEA aims to
please with an old-fashioned thriller where, once again, the beasts are
much smarter than the prey (the people).</P>
<P>     The story is familiar – genetic tampering makes sharks brilliantly
intelligent – and they want nothing more than to eat people.  Along the
food chain are Samuel Jackson, Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, and Michael
Rapaport.  But most notable is rapper LL Cool J as a cook/preacher who
provides much-needed comic relief to the proceedings.</P>
<P>     Burrows and Jackson are also fun (with Burrows redeeming herself
for the debacle of WING COMMANDER earlier this year), and a mostly
clever and zippy script keeps the film alive.  Director Renny Harlin
seems to be back in decent form, too.  And the CGI sharks are awfully
well-done, with some of the best biting-a-person-in-half sequences ever
put on film, he said, only slightly sarcastically.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, DEEP BLUE SEA lands somewhere between THE ABYSS and
LEVIATHAN in the pantheon of underwater monster thrillers.  It's not
great and it doesn't suck, but it'll get your date to jump into your
lap, and that's really what a movie like this is all about, right?</P>
