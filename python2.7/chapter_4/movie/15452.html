<PRE>CAN'T HARDLY WAIT
RATING:  7 / 10 --> Good movie </PRE>

<P>This film is basically a 90's retread of all the dopey 80's teenage
high school movies from the ultimate of all teenage films, BREAKFAST
CLUB (8/10), to the ultimate in all house-party-fantasy movies, WEIRD
SCIENCE (8/10), to all the geeks and geekettes in the all-American
black comedy classic, HEATHERS (8/10). Slap some Jennifer Love Hewitt
in a tight top into the mix, and you've got yourself a
testosterone-fest of beer, teenage heartaches, devirginizations and
love matches to which you could crack an egg. </P>
<P>PLOT:
The high school's most popular girl gets dumped by her boyfriend, who
happens to be the most popular guy, on the last day of school right
before the last big party before College. Everyone who's anyone goes to
the party that night, from nerds to jocks, hipsters to poseurs, all
looking for that last real high before their life of actual
responsibilities takes off. Love is in the air, but so is a lot of
alcohol and music. Pour over ice, mix well, and drink up!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Completely unoriginal idea for a film scores points for a great
soundtrack, a solid cast, a decent characterization of most every
stereotype, and a mostly funny, sometimes sentimentally nostalgic look
at the last days of the greatest days of most of our lives. Call me a
sucker for high school comedies that feature house parties, but this
film never bored me through its entire quick runtime, despite its
derivative nature, and generally kept me smirking and interested in the
lives of the characters presented therein. </P>
<P>For this accomplishment, I must give the props up to two of the actors
that portrayed their characters with the most believability and
sincerity, that being Ethan Embry and Lauren Ambrose. But don't get me
wrong, the rest of the cast was also quite adequate in their roles,
with Seth Green acting out a great fly white-young black-wannabee (a la
Gary Oldman in TRUE ROMANCE (9/10), I might add) but these two stood
out amongst the plethora of cardboard cutouts plastered through most of
this film. Having said that, I think the marketers of the film did a
piss-poor job of marketing this film as a Jennifer Love Hewitt vehicle,
since first of all, she is barely in it, second of all, is not all that
good in it, and third of all, is one of the least interesting
characters in the entire picture. I think they might've gained a wider
diversity of audience, if they were to have introduced more of the
characters in the previews, but then again, who am I to argue against a
set of gazongas?</P>
<P>All in all, this picture is interesting enough to watch, funny enough
to laugh at from time to time, and nostalgic enough to drift your mind
off to the days of old for a second or two. Also, the soundtrack of
this film really blew me away with its eclectic mix of heavy rock, rap
and punk, and any film that has the balls to feature Guns 'n Roses
"Paradise City" as one of its flagship tunes (During one of the best
scenes in the film) is allright in my book! Cameos by Jenna Elfman and
a dead-ringing jock Jerry O'Connell top this tasty tart of emptiness,
and the epilogues of all the featured characters stamp this film as the
ultimate impersonation of all films teenage. </P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This film was originally titled THE PARTY.
Macho-man Peter Facinelli had a baby-girl with 90210-famed actress
Jennie Garth in 1997. They named her Luca Bella.
Jennifer Love Hewitt was born in Waco, Texas. She has a cat named Don
Juan (She loves Johnny Depp), and also had a role in SISTER ACT 2: BACK
IN THE HABIT.
Some of you may remember fly-boy Seth Green from his part of Scott
Evil, son of Dr. Evil, in the shaggoliciously funny Michael Myers film
AUSTIN POWERS (7/10).
You might also remember Charlie Korsmo, who plays the nerd character
effectively in this film, from his earlier kid roles in HOOK, WHAT
ABOUT BOB? (7.5/10) and DICK TRACY, alongside Hollywood legend Warren
Beatty. He took a seven-year hiatus from acting to have a "normal"
teenage life and finish junior high and high school.
Actress Lauren Ambrose is also a classically trained opera singer.
Ethan Embry is one of the many actors to have portrayed Chevy Chase's
goofy son in the VACATION movies, as he was the one to portray Rusty
Griswold in 1997's VEGAS VACATION. His real last name is  Randall, but
he changed it to Embry because it was his grandfather's.
This is the directorial debut for both Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan.
