<P>If your idea of A Good Time doesn't include watching a two-hour movie
that scoffs at the laws of gravity, involves warrior chicks kickin' butt
and taking names, and does so without a single line of spoken English,
you might want to skip this review and the movie it speaks fondly of:
CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON.  Obviously, high fantasy isn't your
Thing.</P>
<P>I hope you'll forgive me if I snicker at some of you as I recall how
much you liked STAR WARS...</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
In 19th century Qing Dynasty China, warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat),
seeking a more peaceful existence, gives his Green Destiny sword to
fellow warrior - and the object of his desire - Yu Shu Lien (Michelle
Yeoh), asking her to deliver it to Sir Te (Sihung Lung) for safekeeping.
Yu Shu Lien regretfully does so, but soon afterwards, a stealthy thief
steals the sword from Sir Te's camp.</P>
<P>Suspicion falls upon members of the House of Governor Yu (Li Fa Feng),
who, along with Madam Yu (Hai Yan), their willful daughter Jen (Zhang
Ziyi), and Jen's Governess (Cheng Peipei), have come to visit Sir Te in
preparations for Jen's arranged marriage to nobility.  As Li Mu Bai and
Yu Shu Lien set out to find the thief, they discover there's more to Jen
than meets the eye - including her involvement with a desert marauder
named Lo (Chang Chen).</P>
<P>The Upshot:
It amuses me somewhat that the fantasy-like acrobatics, and the English
subtitles, would be an impenetrable barrier to anyone enjoying CROUCHING
TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (hereafter, "CT/HD"); with some of the tripe thrown
at American audiences during the M2K movie year, an inventive movie like
CT/HD should be like a breath of fresh air.  My amusement aside, CT/HD
did take some getting used to, I must admit.  But the learning curve
wasn't at all steep; after only a few minutes, the audience I was in
fully got into the spirit of the film, heartily applauding the
magnificent combat scenes, laughing during appropriate moments, and
generally following the story from start to moving finish.</P>
<P>CT/HD was worth any needed extra effort to watch it.  I've long
appreciated the vast talents of Michelle Yeoh (who I first saw in, of
all things, a 007 flick) and Chow Yun-Fat (one of the best things about
1999's ANNA AND THE KING).  They continued to please here, all around;
the actors and their characters seemed to effortlessly compliment each
other on, and off, the fighting arena, Yu Shu Lien's strength of
presence being a good match for Li Mu Bai's confident nobility.  Much
more a surprise was the striking Zhang Ziyi as the reluctant
bride-to-be, Jen.  She was, in every sense of the word, stunning; her
character as spirited as she was beautiful, it wasn't hard to see why Li
Mu Bai was enchanted by the willful Jen.  A strong supporting cast -
including Cheng Peipei in a dual role, Chang Chen as Lo, Jen's sensuous
desert lover, Gao Xi'an as the diligent guardsman Bo, and Li Li as his
diligent daughter Mai - helped to elevate the CT/HD storyline far above
the standard "You Killed My Master!" plot of most martial arts flicks.</P>
<P>Much of the credit for the depth of CT/HD goes to its brilliant
director, Ang Lee, and the equally-brilliant camerawork by
cinematographer Peter Pau.  Recognition and appreciation of movie
artists besides the actors, being my reviewing Achilles' Heel, I
definitely had to sit up and take notice of Lee's and  Pau's handiwork
behind-the-camera.  Credit, too, to CT/HD fight choreographer Woo-ping
Yuen, costumer Tim Yip, and to Yo-Yo Ma, whose cello provided CT/HD with
a haunting musical touch.  Thought THE MATRIX had it goin' on?  You
ain't seen nuttin' until you see Chow Yun-Fat walk on water, or Zhang
Ziyi knock big bad brutes back into yesterday.  And the weapons used
throughout this film kept me - a big-time weaponry fan - salivating (and
at one point, laughing; watch for a late scene with Michelle Yeoh and
Zhang Ziyi, to see what tickled my funny bone).</P>
<P>The lasting beauty of CT/HD is that its pageantry, its tender love
stories, and its humor are never eclipsed by its awe-inspiring action;
each element is as integral as the next.  Ironically, given the
aspersions cast upon the martial arts genre as a whole, the same can't
be said of many standard Hollywood movies these days.  This, I think, is
a key factor in why CT/HD has taken so many people by surprise: who'da
thunk a kung-fu flick could be *deep*?</P>
<P>Even at this length, my review can't do justice to CROUCHING TIGER,
HIDDEN DRAGON; any attempts I make to describe this genre-breaking
movie, fall woefully short of the mark.  Trust me; even if you have to
go out of your way to see it (as I did - Lansing "Podunkville Central"
Michigan still not being a Selected City), it's well worth the trip.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
You'll have to forgive me again - I know that gang involvement is not
truly a Black Factor issue, no more so than any stereotypically
monolithic and destructive activity Blacks are unproportionately
involved in - but I couldn't help but be struck by the parallels to
modern-day street gangs when Lo spoke of his affiliation with the desert
gang that he rode with as being "family", and a "noble" part of his
life.   Realities of gang warfare aside, I wonder how American movie
audiences would take to ongoing depictions of gang members as
sympathetic, even admirable, characters.  Not too well, I'd reckon.</P>
<P>GOODFELLAS and GODFATHERs, not inclusive.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
Once I accepted the gravity-lawbreaking, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON
was as moving a work of art as any I've ever witnessed; a majestic
master stroke from Ang Lee that takes martial arts cinema to a whole new
level.   I will be shocked - shocked! - if Oscar doesn't smile warmly
upon this film.</P>
<P>CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (rating: greenlight):
Say what you will about the inherent weirdness in CROUCHING TIGER,
HIDDEN DRAGON; but *one* thing's for sure: this ain't your father's
kung-fu flick.</P>
