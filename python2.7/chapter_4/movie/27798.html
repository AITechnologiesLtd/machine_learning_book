<P>   In Mike Nichols's landmark film "The Graduate," a naive
college graduate falls in love with the daughter of a woman
who has seduced him, arriving just before the younger
woman is to take her wedding vows with another man.  In the
movie's dramatic, concluding moments, he succeeds in
stopping the wedding and spiriting the bride away.  While
some brides have been known to flee from the altar moments
before tying the knot, such escapes rarely happen in such a
striking manner.  What's more common, however, is for a
man or woman to walk the aisle with a second choice--with
someone accepted because numero uno is somehow not
available.  Imagine what would happen, though, if just before
the marriage of convenience--and for months after the
occasion--one's true love shows up hither and thither to
rekindles the flame!  Such is the subject of Henry James's
mature novel, "The Golden Bowl," which in the hands of a
typical Hollywood studio could be made into broad comedy
with soapish sentiment but is treated by James Ivory with
much of the subtlety given the theme by the novelist.</P>
<P>   In a gorgeous film that embraces the theme of
class differences, Prince Amerigo (Jeremy Northam), a
member of Europe's impoverished aristocracy, must abjure
marriage to Charlotte (Uma Thurman), the love of his life, as
they are too poor to marry (much like Lily Bart and Lawrence
Selden in Edith Wharton's "The Mouse of Mirth").  The prince
is luckier.  When Charlotte re-enters the scene just before the
scheduled nuptials of her prince in shining armor to Maggie
(Kate Beckinsale)--who is the daughter of billionaire Adam
Verver (Nick Nolte)--the tightly-drawn coil begins to unwind.  </P>
<P>   Talky, this is.  But so what?  The talk is good: clever, witty,
ironic as all get-out and for suspense our attention is riveted
almost throughout the film on how the plot will turn out.  We
are persuaded that Adam, who has about the closest
relationship to his daughter Maggie that one can imagine a
dad having with his grown-up girl, will take violent action
against Amerigo for hurting her--for lying about his past affair
with Charlotte and even worse for continuing the affair during
the marriage to Maggie.  After all, Amerigo and Charlotte are
so dauntless in their attachment that they risk getting
caught time and again.  To foreshadow the potential of this
revenge, director James Ivory opens the movie in much the
way that Philip Kaufman opened "Quills."  In Kaufman's case,
a weeping aristocratic woman is being coarsely tied and led
to the guillotine by a brutal executioner.  Here, we see some
of Amerigo's ancestors (15th or 16th century I believe) caught
in bed with the wrong people, both led by an infuriated lord
to a beheading.  (One thinks of the revenge of Hannibal
against Pazzi in Ridley Scott's blockbuster movie: tossed out
the window and hanged in much the way a Pazzi of yore was
done away with.)</P>
<P>   The central symbol, the golden bowl, is a flawed gift which
Charlotte and Amerigo consider buying for Maggie, the flaw
representing the life led by the two rich Ververs which shield
them from the truth about their most important relationships.</P>
<P>   What a cast, with one exception.  What's Uma Thurman
doing in a Merchant-Ivory movie anyway?  To my eyes she's
unattractive: one can hardly understand the prince's undying
passion for her particularly when he is married to a rich and
awfully cute woman (that's Kate Beckinsale), but given the
debonair character of Amerigo with his sexy Italian accent
(well kept throughout by Jeremy Northam), one can
understand the fatal-attraction type love felt for him by Ms.
Thurman's character.  As for production design, tops.  A
costume ball contrasts with a scene of industrial America, the
latter indicating that Adam Verver made his money by paying
immigrant labor mighty low wages for a 12-hour 7-day week. 
Castles all over Italy and England were borrowed for the
occasion.</P>
<P>   Anjelica Huston plays the Maggie-Smith like role as the all-
knowing aunt (Fanny), nose-in-the-air with disgust at the
vulgar American culture which she fortunately need not put
up with in England, and Nick Nolte shines as the well-kept
rich guy with his collection of Holbeins and the like but with
an almost agoraphobic mistrust of the fresh air.  </P>
<P>   Since "The Golden Bowl" is considered by some to be
Henry James's most mature work, one wonders why it took
so long for the filmed version, given the existence of Iain
Softley's "The Wings of the Dove," James Ivory's "The
Bostonians" and "The Europeans," Agnieszka Holland's
"Washington Square,"  Peter Bogdanovich's "Daisy Miller"
and James Campion's "The Portrait of a Lady."  Perhaps
screenwriters were intimidated with the story's intricate,
sophisticated, even convoluted narrative and the difficulty of
putting subtle levels of analysis and character on the big
screen.  Nonetheless we're pleased that Ruth Prawer
Jhabvala has tackled the difficult job of trying to evoke the
subtlety of the novelist's language--James's bid to circle
around a subject without touching it directly.  While "The
Golden Bowl" is filmed by James Ivory on location in
England, Italy and a sound-bite in the U.S., cultural
differences are subordinated in the film (as they were in the
novel) in favor of an intense study of individual character in
this filmed version.  A startling production which would be of
interest to the Merchant-Ivory fans but too verbal for the MTV
crowd.</P>
