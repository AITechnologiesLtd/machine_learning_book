<P>DREAM LOVER (director/writer: Nicholas Kazan; cinematographer: Jean-Yves

Reardon), Madchen Amick (Lena Reardon), Bess Armstrong (Elaine), Larry Miller
(Norman), Fredric Lehne (Larry), William Shockley (Buddy), Clyde Kusatsu
(Judge); Runtime: 103; Gramercy Pictures; 1994) </P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A far-fetched thriller that bogs done in an incredible situation by the film's
last 20 minutes. Dream Lover takes the law into its sordid hands. James Spader
plays Ray Reardon, a successful, handsome architect, recently divorced and on
the lookout for the perfect soulmate in his quest of all his yuppie dreams.
Attending his obnoxious friend Norman's (Miller) art gallery party, he bumps
into an attractive and mysterious brunette who arouses his sexual curiosity. She
contrives to meet him again at a supermarket and he soon becomes intimately
involved with his so-called dream girl, Lena (Amick). </P>
<P>After several years of marriage, kids, and bliss, things begin to fall apart for
Ray. He catches her behaving strangely and in many lies: she lies about the
college she attended, where she's from, hiring temp workers to pose as her
friends, the bruises she has on her body, that she is sleeping with one of his
close friends Larry (Lehne), and how she setup the meeting with him to trap him
into marriage. Lena plays the villainous femme fatale without smoke. There's
something dry about her performance. There's also the lack of chemistry in the
relationship she has with the Spader character. Instead of steamy sex we get
absurd plot contrivances of how manipulative she is and how she gets the law to
back her in her quest to take Spader's money. The filmmaker wants us to believe
that Spader is suddenly, out of the blue, after a lifetime of being a model
citizen and a credit to the business world, ruled insane by the judicial system.
He is sent to a mental institution on only the word of his wife and her shrink,
all because he slapped her around after finding out she's been unfaithful to
him. Spader's attempt to tell about her false history and that  she's a
psychopathic liar are ignored by the judge. In the laughable trial at his
insanity hearing, no mention is made of all her deceits into roping him into the
marriage, or of any of the other things she did that were deceptive. He's
suddenly kept drugged in an mental institution and his only plan of escaping his
nightmare, is to conspire with Larry's wife Elaine (Armstrong) to come up with a
totally insane plan to get revenge on Lena. </P>
<P>This was not a very satisfying thriller: it lacked conviction, memorable
performances, and intelligent dialogue. An example of the film's inane dialogue
can best be heard in a typical conversation between the two protagonists.
Spader: You're a psychopath. Amick: Even psychopaths can still love somebody.
This kind of talk might be especially appealing to the psychopaths in the
audience. There weren't many layers to peel away from this story before
discovering how manipulative it was, how it was without a strong actor's
presence, and how it failed to make a strong psychological imprint; the
characters were made into objects of a contrived tale causing the film to lag. </P>
