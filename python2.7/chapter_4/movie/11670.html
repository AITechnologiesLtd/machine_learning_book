<PRE>THE DEFIANT ONES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ****</PRE>
<P>     As two convicts, one black and one white, wake up arm-in-arm like
a pair of sleeping Siamese twin babies, they look at each with an
instant rage.  They have been soaked to the bone by a torrential
downpour.  Asleep they nurtured each other, but awake their racial
hatred is rekindled with a vengeance in 1959's THE DEFIANT ONES.</P>
<P>     The great producer and director Stanley Kramer blessed the world
with a host of moving dramas that garnered him seven Academy Award
nominations (HIGH NOON, THE CAINE MUTINY, THE DEFIANT ONES, JUDGMENT AT
NUREMBERG, DR. STRANGELOVE, SHIP OF FOOLS, and GUESS WHO'S COMING TO
DINNER), but no actual statuettes other than the Irving G. Thalberg
Memorial Award.  His pictures, however, got won others numerous Oscars
as well as nominations.</P>
<P>     THE DEFIANT ONES received Academy Awards for Sam Leavitt's moody
cinematography with its sharp whites and gloomy grays and for Harold
Jacob Smith and Nedrick Young's crisp but powerful screenplay.  Notable
among the many Oscar nominations were the ones for best actor by Sidney
Poitier and Tony Curtis.  Poitier went on to win in his only other
nomination for LILIES OF THE FIELD, but Curtis was never nominated
again although he's done over a hundred movies.</P>
<P>     THE DEFIANT ONES begins when the vehicle carrying the two
convicts, John 'Joker' Jackson (Curtis) and Noah Cullen (Poitier),
crashes in a big storm.  They break loose, which sets up the story's
cat and mouse chase.  There are two parallel stories, the major one of
the prisoners on the loose and the more minor one of the law
enforcement officers and their rag-tag posse of local hunters and their
dogs.  Kramer cuts back and forth between them as each group has their
own arguments and squabbles.  The chase, although interesting, plays
out on a minor stage with the dialog within the two groups taking
center stage.</P>
<P>     In contrast to today's films, where the word "nigger" is thrown
about as if it means nothing more than any other profanity, this movie
treats it with the contempt it deserves.  In their first verbal
encounter in the picture, Joker uses the word nigger to refer to Noah.
Noah immediately lashes back with the furious retort, "Nigger!  You
call me that again, and I'll kill you!"</P>
<P>     When the trackers begin assembling for the big hunt, one of them
asks, "How come they chained a white man to a black?"  Sheriff Max
Muller, played in an Oscar nominated performance by Theodore Bikel,
says with disgust, "The warden's got a sense of humor."  But the
sheriff figures that the arrangement is to his advantage since it
surely means that "They'll kill each other in 5 miles."  And he's not
far off.  They taunt each other with insults of such ferocity at first
that their chance of survival does indeed look slim.</P>
<P>     After a while, however, their chained condition brings them
together and makes them realize the similarities of their conditions
and of their upbringing.  Both view their backgrounds and their
confinement as somehow having been caused by society's repression - one
for being black and the other for being poor.  Curtis laments that his
troubles stem not from his life of crime but from the fact that he was
not a big-time crook, since those guys always get away with it.</P>
<P>     Eventually, the two escapees run into a lynch-happy redneck and
his white buddies.  At this point jail begins to look pretty inviting.
Their newly found friendship beings to crumble when death looms
eminent.  Curtis boldly proclaims that they can't hang him because he's
white, but they aren't particularly impressed with this line of
reasoning.</P>
<P>     Kramer stages the scenes with such simplistic power that he gives
the outdoors almost the look of a stage play -- all the better to focus
the audience's attention on the words in the two dramas at hand.  He
shoots in tight close-ups to draw the audience into the story.</P>
<P>     With two superb performances and palpable tension, the film has a
strength that rises above the simplicity of the storyline.  As Siamese
twins, for example, their inevitable fistfight makes no sense and yet
seems perfectly natural.  If one knocks the other out or worse, the
other one will have little chance of dragging a dead body through the
countryside</P>
<P>     Among the many excellent small performances, Cara Williams,
another Oscar nominee, plays a man-starved widow, known only as "the
Woman," who thinks the handsome Joker is just about the best thing to
come to her remote farm in years.  Easily overlooking his past, she
feels nothing but sympathy for him.  Her sad, glistening eyes speak
volumes.  Although some scenes become a bit didactic, most have
remarkable subtlety.  When the Woman wants to show her willingness to
have sex with Joker, she merely lets her hair down with a knowing
smile.  One brief kiss, and the camera cuts away to the next morning.
Her look as she drops her hair is more erotic than most nude scenes
today.</P>
<P>     Although I would have preferred a more dramatic and surprising
ending, Kramer stages the inevitable one with efficient precision, and
the story seems to wind down rather than ending.  But it is in the
dialog that the film finds its power anyway and not the drive toward
some hokey conclusion.</P>
<P>     THE DEFIANT ONES runs a fast 1:37.  It is not rated but would be
PG-13 for adult themes and a little violence and would be fine for kids
around 10 and up.</P>
