<PRE>OTHELLO 1995
 A film review by Timothy Voon
Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Laurence Fishburn, Irene Jacob, Kenneth Branagh, Nathaniel Parker,
Michael Maloney Director: Oliver Parker Screenplay: Oliver Parker based
on the play by William Shakespeare Cinematograpy</P>
<P>Would you think your wife was having an affair with your best friend, if
you saw him with her handkerchief?</P>
<P>That's an unfair question. Handkerchiefs were probably significant items
of clothing in the days of Shakespeare, and this in particular, was a
special handkerchief. So let's rephrase the question.</P>
<P>Would you think your wife was having an affair with your best friend, if
you saw him with her panties?</P>
<P>I probably would not, because women's underclothing all look alike to
me, BUT Othello would.</P>
<P>Othello (Fishburne), the greatest general of his time, the respected
governor of Cyprus whose one failing was jealousy. Fed by the subtle
lies of Iago (Branagh), Othello is led to believe that his wife (Jacob)
is having an affair with his lieutenant (Parker). He is driven into such
a jealous rage that he has convulsions thinking about it (I didn't know
that Othello was an epileptic?). One can only be as jealous as much as
one loves, and Othello was jealous enough to kill his wife.</P>
<P>This is not one of the better adaptations of Shakespeare to screen. I'm
biased because I personally prefer Shakespeare performed as a play.
Nevertheless, the lesson must be taught, that jealousy breeds contempt,
and if you're having marital problems - seek a marriage counsellor or
you may end up with four dead bodies on your bed.</P>
<P>Strong performances from Fishburne, Branagh and the rest of the cast.</P>
<P>Comment: Shakespeare at his morbid best.</P>
