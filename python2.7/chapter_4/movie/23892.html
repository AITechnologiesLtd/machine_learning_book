<P>Return to Me (2000) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring David Duchovny,
Minnie Driver, Carroll O'Connor, Robert Loggia, David Alan Grier, Bonnie
Hunt, James Belushi and Joely Richardson. Written by Hunt and Don Lake.
Directed by Hunt</P>
<P> He's a successful young architect madly in love with his wife.</P>
<P> She's a waitress, lying in a hospital bed awaiting the heart that will
give her a second chance at life.</P>
<P> This is the setup for 'Return to Me,' a romantic feather in which you
know everything that is going to happen within the first five minutes.
There are no surprises, no sudden twists or deviations.</P>
<P> Yet, like dining at your favorite restaurant, you still enjoy the
experience even though you've done it hundreds of times.</P>
<P> I must confess that under this cynical exterior beats the heart of a
romantic, thus "Return to Me" was most appealing.</P>
<P> It has a quaint, old-fashioned quality to it. The characters are good
people, even though they are recognizable types. Nevertheless, you root
for these vulnerable protagonists  as they overcome their misfortunes
and rediscover happiness.</P>
<P> He's the still-in-mourning husband driven by work to battle the pain of
loss.</P>
<P> She's the chipper, warm-hearted young woman thankful for her good
fortune.</P>
<P> They meet cute when she serves him, his obnoxious and rude blind date
and some friends at her grandfather's tavern - O'Reilly's Italian
Restaurant.</P>
<P> They are attracted to each other and begin dating. Bob (David Duchovny)
begins to smile again. Grace (Minnie Driver) finds what she never
thought she would experience - love.</P>
<P> Together they make a handsome couple.</P>
<P> The only drawback is her reluctance to tell him about her transplant,
especially after she learns about the donor.</P>
<P> I don't believe I am giving anything away. Anyone with a rudimentary
knowledge of the genre can forecast what is going to happen with more
accuracy than a meteorologist predicting rain in April.</P>
<P> Duchovny and Driver make a sweet pair. You want to see their
relationship succeed. Both are charming, and both perform admirably.
Driver, especially, is a lovely actress, easy on the eyes.</P>
<P> Duchovny easily fits into the leading man persona, showing flashes of
wit, determination, pain and vulnerability.</P>
<P> The real star of "Return to Me" is Bonnie Hunt, who co-wrote the script
and directs, as well as plays a supporting role as Driver's best friend.</P>
<P> Her dry wit and observations are punctuated throughout the film.</P>
<P> An enticing supporting cast, including Carroll O'Connor, Robert Loggia,
Joely Richardson, David Alan Grier and James Belushi, add to the
enjoyment.
"Return to Me" is not a ground-breaking movie. It is a formulaic, but
its charm compensates for its minor flaws.</P>
<P> At about 115 minutes, "Return to Me" is a fine date movie.</P>
