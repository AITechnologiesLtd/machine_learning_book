<P>Starring Don McKellar, Sandra Oh, David Cronenberg. Directed by Don
McKellar. Rated R.</P>
<P>The end of the world is here, but in Canadian director Don McKellar's
feature debut Last Night, there are no Satans, no comets, no astronauts
and no heroes (well, in the traditional sense of the word). It's a
thoughtful, affecting film, one that pulls no punches and plays no
tricks. This isn't an f/x production and those expecting action would
do well to stay away; this is for those who would like a quiet
apocalyptic vision for a change. This is not about the end of the world
as a concept -- we never find out why the world is ending or how
everyone knows it's ending -- but about how real, normal people deal
with it and what they do in the last six hours of their lives.</P>
<P>McKellar, who wrote The Red Violin for François Girard, casts himself
here as Patrick Wheeler, an average, reasonably happy man (though his
previous wife died of cancer) who has decided that he wants to spend
his last six hours at home alone, quietly. His parents are pissy that
he doesn't want to spend the time with his family -- but family dinners
can be boring even on the last day of your life, and Patrick has no
intention of putting himself through it. He is adamant that these hours
will be his.</P>
<P>But along comes Sandra (Sandra Oh), who has lost her car to doomsday
raiders (read: those who want to take advantage of the apocalypse to
commit no-consequence crimes, thereby letting their anger out) and is
looking for her husband, who seems to have disappeared. She comes to
Patrick's door in desperation, begging to use his phone, not knowing
where else to go. He reluctantly lets her in. Her husband doesn't
answer. They start talking. Patrick soon finds out why she is so
desperate to find her husband and what is in that mysterious case she
is carrying: she and her hubby made a pact to shoot each other right
before the world ends.</P>
<P>In a seemingly unrelated plot line, a gas company employee spends his
last hours calling each of his customers assuring them that he
will "make every effort to keep their gas flowing right up until the
end." Patrick's friend wants to realize every sexual fantasy he's ever
had -- including, but certainly not limited to sex with his teacher and
sex with another man (he propositions Patrick). Meanwhile, those who
decided to party their brains out on the last day, party on.</P>
<P>Last Night has more than its share of humor and it's even being
marketed as half-comedic, when in fact, it epitomizes poignancy. This
lies in the characters. David Cronenberg's gas company employee is one
of the year's saddest, most touching characters; even more impressive
considering how little screen time he was granted. Sandra Oh's Sandra
is devastating as a woman who refuses to let the world take her life.
Patrick seems to be the only content character on screen, but even he
has undertones of sadness. The movie isn't a weep-fest or a melodrama
because it's too good for either genre and because it ends with a
decisive touch of hope and redemption.</P>
<P>The sex-fantasy subplot may be a bit too "out there" for a film
otherwise so subdued that even I felt like screaming "BIG BANG!" at the
screen sometimes. But it tends to balance out well and I can't call the
film uneven. Actually, it's quite the opposite: most of the movie is
hypnotic in its relentless stability and calmness. The antidote to End
of Days, Last Night is the patient person's Armageddon.</P>
<P>The key to the movie is that we don't know how or why the world is
ending. The only information we are given is that for the past few
weeks (months?), the sun has stayed up 24/7, the cell phones haven't
worked and the government has closed up shop. No explanation is ever
provided. This maybe frustrating to some -- even I admit to wanting
something concrete at points -- but it is the reason this movie
succeeds. Providing an answer to logistical questions would have
diverted attention from the movie's main focus, which is hardly the end
of the world in and of itself.</P>
<P>McKellar's directorial debut is entertaining, deeply moving, dignified
and the all-important ending is just perfect. Seeing Last Night the
same week as End of Days made me realize how important it is to be able
to see films produced outside of the American Hollywood movie-mill,
especially those from north of the border.</P>
