<P>     The science fiction/action arena is littered with entries of
varying quality, from the pulse pounding excitement of ALIENS to the
plodding and ill-conceived SPLIT SECOND.  NO ESCAPE, the latest
offering from mega-producer Gail Anne Hurd, falls somewhere in
between.</P>
<P>     Set in the year 2022, when the prison system has become big
business, NO ESCAPE opens with the incarceration of Captain J. T.
Robbins (Ray Liotta) in Leviticus, a maximum security prison for
unredeemable offenders.  The Warden (Michael Lerner) is a sadist who
delights in fiendishly vicious punishments and sends his worst
prisoners to the escape-proof island of Absalom, where savagery is the
norm and survival the sole objective.  It doesn't take long before
Robbins, a man who steadfastly refuses to take orders or acknowledge
authority, offends the Warden enough to warrant a one-way journey to
Absalom.</P>
<P>     If elements of NO ESCAPE sound vaguely familiar to those of last
year's FORTRESS, don't be disturbed.  This movie is far more
watchable.</P>
<P>     Most of the script, which is based on Richard Herley's THE PENAL
COLONY, is reasonably intelligent--or at least it doesn't astound with
its lack of intelligence.  The biggest plot problem is the existence of
Absalom.  It's never made clear exactly what the prison island's
purpose is, or how it was established.  Not that this is the only
"detail" glossed over by NO ESCAPE.</P>
<P>     Of course, many of the explanations could have been snipped from
the final print.  It's clear that the editors went to work on NO
ESCAPE.  Even at a two hour running length, it has all the marks of a
pruning job.  In most cases, especially the action sequences, this has
been expertly done, but it's apparent that a fair amount of what was
committed to film didn't make it to the screen version.</P>
<P>     The first half hour is reminiscent of a futuristic THE FUGITIVE in
that it doesn't give the viewer much opportunity to catch his or her
breath.  During the final three-quarters of NO ESCAPE, bursts of action
occur, but nothing--not even the climactic battle--rivals the opening
for generating tension.</P>
<P>     Ray Liotta might seem an odd choice for an action hero.  After
all, he doesn't have Schwarzenegger's biceps, Stallone's monosyllabic
speech patterns, Van Damme's accent, or Lundgren's woodenness.  In
fact, Liotta is an actor--and a pretty good one at that.
Nevertheless, despite this apparent "disadvantage", he's reasonably
convincing.  I think it's the steely eyes and no-nonsense expression.
It certainly isn't the few obligatory (and lame) one-liners he's forced
to utter.</P>
<P>     Development of Captain Robbins' character is spotty, and the movie
arguably might have been better had he remained ambiguous.  Before we
know his background, he's fierce and intimidating.  Learning the truth
serves to diminish him.</P>
<P>     The supporting actors, as is often the case, vary from good to
bad.  Lance Henriksen, who is making a career appearing in these sorts
of films, is merely adequate, as is Ernie Hudson as a mirthless
head-of-security.  Michael Lerner is miscast as the nasty Warden--his
sneer isn't good enough.  Far better is Stuart Wilson, who steals far
too many scenes from Liotta and everyone else, as the deliciously evil
Satan of Absalom, Merak.  The worst performance belongs to Kevin
Dillon, whose whiny, poorly-realized Casey should have been excised
from the screenplay.</P>
<P>     Filmed in Australia, NO ESCAPE boasts gorgeous scenery, and it's
easy to accept Absalom as a lush hell.  The special effects are
believable, although not plentiful.  And those members of the audience
who don't like rats will have to close their eyes during one very
creepy scene.</P>
<P>     NO ESCAPE is effective, but not superlative.  The more you think
about it, the less it holds together, but this is not a motion picture
designed to withstand careful scrutiny.  Put simply, NO ESCAPE is meant
to be an escape and, as such, it meets all the necessary requirements.</P>
