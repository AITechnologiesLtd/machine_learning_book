<P>Washington Irving's short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", first 
published in 1819, is a well-respected folk tale of supernatural secrets, and 
has survived the generations long enough to spawn several film adaptations -- 
among them an Emmy-winning mini-series for kids and a Disney animation. When 
Tim Burton, that distinctive director of twisted heroic journeys and gothic 
fantasies, decided to do his own remake of the Irving work, the project was 
expected to be his prestigious bid for Oscar success. If David Lynch can make 
a subtle movie with a premise as weird as that of "The Straight Story", 
people thought, surely Tim Burton can take a delicate approach to a classic?</P>
<P>Actually, this "Sleepy Hollow" is as Burtonesque as possible, a gory 
special-effects extravaganza set in 1799 that plays like a cross between 
Thomas Hardy and "The Evil Dead". Tim has determined to stay in his own wild 
world, and along with his screenwriters, Andrew Kevin Walker and Kevin 
Yagher, has confidently shuffled around the details of Irving's plot for his 
own purposes. Even the image of the famous literary figure Ichabod Crane has 
been altered -- he's no longer a lanky, curious schoolteacher who lives where 
the story is set, but a clumsy New York City police constable played by 
Johnny Depp.</P>
<P>Burton and Depp's Crane travels to the village of Sleepy Hollow to 
investigate the murders of three local men -- all of whom were found in the 
woods without heads. The town elders -- Van Tassell (Michael Gambon), 
Hardenbrook (Michael Gough), Steenwyck (Jeffrey Jones) and Phillipse (Richard 
Griffiths) -- inform Crane that they suspect the legendary 'Headless 
Horsemen' of the crimes, a warrior ghost who is said to stalk and decapitate 
the inhabitants of the area in search of his own noggin. But the constable 
does not want to listen, claiming to be a man of science and reason, and 
searching for a human culprit.</P>
<P>There is fun to be had in just watching Crane try to operate his newfangled 
scientific gadgets, which are elaborately designed for no visible purpose, 
with windows and panels and knobs aplenty, which constantly spring out of his 
control. Depp plays the character as a clearly preposterous man who 
nonetheless attempts to maintain serious authority, and who rigidly keeps 
eyes wide open, head upright and mouth poised properly even while cowering 
from a spider, or shrieking in peril under bed sheets.</P>
<P>The amusingly clumsy fellow soon learns that the Headless Horseman is indeed 
a real figure, and also finds such sights as a witch and a magical tree. 
Crane carries out silly interrogations, investigates town records and digs up 
the victims' graves for further research, getting closer to the explanation 
behind Sleepy Hollow's odd events, and to a violent confrontation with the 
villain responsible. There are slow patches, and at times the film gets 
tangled up in unnecessary confusing details on the way to its simple 
resolution. But the payoff redeems the flaws, thanks to Burton's visuals, 
which are not inaccurate to the location and period, but are larger than 
life, with the depth of Emmanuel Lubezki's photography slightly swelling 
every image and casting a sinister blue mist over the night air. When the 
horseman jumps out from these clouds, the camera rushes around in jarring 
close-ups to follow the havoc he wreaks, and this makes for stunning action 
sequences.</P>
<P>Admittedly, I expected terrific production values and an amusing Johnny Depp 
performance from "Sleepy Hollow". Burton, as I keep stressing, is one of the 
most visually astute of all working filmmakers, and Depp has performed 
creatively in the challenging title roles of the director's "Edward 
Scissorhands" and "Ed Wood". The pleasant surprise here is Christina Ricci, a 
young actress whose recent persona has only been fit for satire, with its 
rebellious, dead-eyed, flat-voiced arrogance. She is sincere and subtle as 
Katrina, the innocent maiden who loves and protects Icabod Crane, displaying 
versatility I believed her to have lost.</P>
<P>No doubt Ricci was just so amazed by the movie's carefully constructed 
atmosphere that she could not stand in the way of it with her usual 
distracting sarcasm. "Sleepy Hollow" proves -- as do "Pee Wee's Big 
Adventure", "Batman", "Edward Scissorhands" and "The Nightmare Before 
Christmas" -- that the offbeat crannies of Tim Burton's mind are worth 
visiting, and he knows how to take us into them.</P>
