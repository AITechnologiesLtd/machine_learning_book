<P>     The conventional three-act film storytelling structure may not be
sacrosanct, but if you're telling a conventional story, it's a really good
idea to use it.  Marketing sets up the audience to expect a specific
conflict for the second act, and to expect that certain characters and
relationships will be the focal points; familiarity with other films tells
them those elements will appear before they've finished their bags of
popcorn.  If you give the people what they expect when they're expecting
it, you're going to satisfy them nine times out of ten.</P>
<P>     BLAST FROM THE PAST is set up as a romance and a fish-out-of-water
comedy, and eventually it is both.  It simply takes foooorrreeeeevvveerr
to get there.  The prologue begins in October 1962 in Los Angeles, where
brilliant, highly paranoid scientist/inventor Calvin Webber (Christopher
Walken) and his nine-months-pregnant wife Helen (Sissy Spacek) are
well-prepared for the Cold War to turn hot.  The Cuban Missile Crisis and
a nearby plane crash conspire to convince the Webbers that nuclear war has
begun, so they lock themselves into their plush multi-room fallout shelter
to wait out the radiation.  Thirty-five years later the door opens, and
the Webbers' son Adam (Brendan Fraser) -- who has spent his whole life
sealed away with Mom and Dad in 1962 -- emerges for supplies and, perhaps,
to find a wife.</P>
<P>     A sensible film-maker would have realized that the Webbers' life in
the shelter was the set-up for the story, not the story itself.  Director
Hugh Wilson, working from his own re-write of Bill Kelly's original story,
decides that those thirty-five years will take up the first thirty-five
minutes of the film.  He juxtaposes details of their day-to-day lives with
developments in the world above -- the latter centered around an employee
(Joey Slotnik) in a malt shop-turned-singles' bar-turned-punk dive --
betraying his sitcom roots by spending infinitely too much time on wacky
peripheral characters. Helen becomes an alcoholic while slowly going stir
crazy, Calvin revels in his role as teacher-lord of his domain, the malt
shop/bar employee becomes a burnout, and who really cares?  Get Adam into
the real world let him cope with it.</P>
<P>     At long last he does get into the real world, and befriends a cynical
young woman named Eve (Alicia Silverstone).  Naturally he reacts strangely
to new-to-him phenomena like riding on a bus and looking at the sky, and
naturally other people react strangely to his anachronistic politeness and
friendliness.  The whole business is handled clumsily, though; like Adam
himself, the film waits so long to begin doing the things it should have
been doing much earlier, it appears unsure how to do them.  The
relationship with Eve develops with inevitability, but without making
sense of her softening towards Adam.  How much better spent that first
half hour might have been if the real world juxtaposition had been Eve's
childhood rather than the pointless Slotnik character, both for comedic
social commentary potential and for plot development purposes.  But no
such luck -- BLAST FROM THE PAST often feels like an assembly-line product
made by people who've never seen an assembly line.</P>
<P>     BLAST FROM THE PAST does have its charms, enough not to make the
experience completely frustrating.  Brendan Fraser does have the naif in a
strange land thing nailed -- he should, after ENCINO MAN and GEORGE OF THE
JUNGLE -- with his big lug build and goofy kid grin; Dave Foley gets the
already tired role of the gay best friend, but delivers his lines with
zest.  Wilson brings a silly energy to the second half of the film, giving
it enough cute moments to make it watchable, but he never pulls it all
together in a way that's completely satisfying.  BLAST FROM THE PAST is a
pretty lousy execution of a fairly simple idea, a textbook case of a
by-the-numbers plot that just doesn't add up.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 half-lives:  5.</PRE>
