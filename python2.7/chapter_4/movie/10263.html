<P>   Few people under the age of forty have even heard of the
legendary folk singer, Pete Seeger, who in his heyday had a
tendency to attach Marxist ideology to his strains and ballads. 
In one of his major melodies, "Titanic," he strums his banjo
and intones, "The rich refused to associate with the poor./  So
they put the poor below,/ They were the first to go,/ It was sad
when the great ship went down."  Committed to the left wing
even in his insistence on once stating that Franco was a
bigger villain than Stalin, Seeger could well be expected to
cut one of the world's great disasters with a strong
political edge.</P>
<P>   What larger point can be made from this insight?  Simply
this: in converting life to art, visionaries have the power (within
reason) to impose their interpretation on events, to highlight
those aspects of a true story which they wish to underscore
and ignore those which they consider of little relevance to
their imagination.  What James Cameron did in his smashing
direction of "Titanic"--whose screenplay he wrote as well--is to
emphasize four angles in his epic work about the fate of the
world's most celebrated cruise ship which left Southampton,
England, in April of 1912.  Foremost is the love story between
an upper-class, somewhat spoiled 17-year-old, Rose DeWitt
Bukater (Kate Winslet) and a lower-caste, self-confident and
handsome lad, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio).  Jack
intuitively senses the girl's rebelliousness, her unhappiness
with what she imagines will be a high-society life of endless
cotillion balls and inane conversation.  His own spirited style
becomes the anchor which is hungrily grasped by the
despondent young woman.   Cameron is obsessed, also, with
re-creating much of Titanic's actual dimensions, in effecting a
verisimilitude between the vessel of 1912 and the ship
designed for him in this film.  Given his $200 million budget--
which makes "Titanic" the most expensive movie of all time--
it's no wonder that he is able to hire the original manufacturer
of the vessel's carpet, reproducing the actual weave for an
audience which would hardly put much concern with such
literalness.  Thirdly, Cameron nutritiously feeds his public with
the disaster spectacle for which it has an insatiable appetite,
devoting the final forty percent of the three and one-quarter
work on the mayhem which follows the craft's collision with an
iceberg.  Finally Cameron deals with the political reality; that
snobbery and a fairly rigid class structure is alive and well not
only in Europe but in America as well.  "Titanic" never stops
beating up on the tuxedo-clad, corset-imprisoned crowd with
the money not only to ride first class but bring along maids,
bodyguards and even their favorite paintings to decorate their
staterooms.  Even in a film a lengthy as this one, fulfilling all
four missions is an imposing task, and Cameron rises to the
occasion so well that his audience is likely to accept without
sardonic laughter even the corniest playing-out of the
romance between Winslet's and DiCaprio's characters.</P>
<P>   To avoid the structure of a museum piece, Cameron wisely
opens his story in the present day, basing the scenario
around the actual discovery in 1985 of the body of the boat
deep beneath the surface of the North Atlantic Ocean.  Brock
Lovett (Bill Paxton), an American explorer who is not adverse
to capitalizing on the riches which may be found within the
wreck, is particularly interested in recovering a diamond
necklace said to have been owned by Louis XVI allegedly lost
in the wreckage. To his dismay he locates not the diamond
but a reproduction of the jewelry on a painting around the
neck of a nude woman who had posed for a sketch during the
ship's maiden voyage.  When news of this find hits the
airwaves, a 101-year-old woman who claims to be Rose
DeWitt Bukater (Gloria Stuart, actually 87) and the owner of
the necklace phones Brock expressing her willingness to tell
the story of the ill-fated voyage.  Cinematographer Russell
Carpenter hones in on the wreck which he is videotaping and
we are suddenly transformed into the glittering pre-war era of
1912 society as the Southampton-based craft labeled
unsinkable takes on passengers from the fabulously rich
to the penniless immigrants.  The first-class compartment is
lavishly appointed and filled with both "new money" and the
"old money" types who look down on the upstarts.  When
Jack Dawson wins a steerage ticket after a lucky hand of
poker just minutes before the ship is to leave the dock at
midnight, his life becomes so intertwined with that of the
lovely but suicidal society girl whose life he saves that he and
his Rose become as inseparable as Romeo and Juliet.</P>
<P>   Though the dialogue leans far more to the cornball and
inane than to the witty and scintillating, and while Cameron is
intent on exposing his audience to the most opulent and
profuse display of humanity yet recorded, the romance and
class struggle portrayed in "Titanic" is, curiously enough, of
greater interest than the disaster sequences--which, by the
way, have been chronicled in almost real time.  Jack and
Rose take their time to get to know and love each other, with
Rose torn between breaking her engagement to the
fabulously rich Cal (Billy Zane) and thrusting aside her humble
but relaxed and confident new beau, Jack.  Rose's resistance
to the penniless artist is overcome in the most predictable
way--she bolts from the asinine conversation of her peers to
join Jack at a "real" party of indigent immigrants dancing a jig,
taking part in hand-wrestling and generally have a rowdy
good time for themselves.  Her decision to pose in the nude
for the talented young man who has been earning his living
sketching women through Paris is the key moment of the
movie.  The chemistry between the two is so palpable, so
believable, that we are swept along despite our inclination to
dismiss the scenes as so much mawkish folderol.  We are
willing even to believe that Cal, the man whom Rose's mother
Frances (Ruth DeWitt Bukater) has chosen for her daughter
because her own wealth had been depleted, can be one
hundred percent Edwardian villain.  So scheming and
snobbish is this Cal that he seems unable to commit a single
ethical act throughout the entire film.  If he finds himself
outmaneuvered for his fiance's love by a member of the hoi
polloi he will stop at nothing, planting jewelry on him and
claiming robbery, even shooting at him as Jack skips around
the deck with his fair maiden.  The steerage people are all
fun-loving, sincere, authentic: the first class passengers--with
the exception of Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) who enjoys being
the comic center of the movie--are obnoxious almost to a
person.</P>
<P>   Even as Titanic hits the fateful iceberg, Cameron takes his
time in introducing the tragic nature of the collision.  At first,
the incident appears minor.  Yet like an early-stage cancer
that is operable, we are made to believe that the ship is going
to sink within two hours and that half of its population will die
because the owners, to avoid an appearance of clutter, did
not provide a sufficient number of lifeboats.</P>
<P>   Film critic David Thomson once said of James Cameron--
known for his off-the-wall sci fi films like "The Spawning,"
"Aliens," and "Terminator 2" that "no one did so much to
redeem the eighties genre of high-tech threat through the
overlay of genuine human interest stories."  Even given the
awe-inspiring technology that treats us to the mayhem on
board as the water seeps, then flows dramatically into each
compartment, Cameron does not smother his interesting,
romantic story with effects and apparatus.  "Titanic" is as
likely as not to sweep the Oscars, given the love of the
Academy for movies of epic grandeur.  It is perhaps the best
example in 1997 of a film which is pure, simple melodrama,
the sort which many Hollywood producers steer clear of
because of their perception that a modern audience will hoot
and holler at the screen, and yet one which works on us by
achieving an end-run around our intellectual defenses.  Rated
PG-13.  Running Time: 194 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
