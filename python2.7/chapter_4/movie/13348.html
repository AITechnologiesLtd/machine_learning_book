<P>Some films are difficult to discuss.  Either they are serious stuff that is
trying to make a point, or they are stuff that is just making fun of people,
and their ways.</P>
<P>DELICATESSEN is one of those films.  Amidst a totally surrealistic
atmosphere, that includes some mime work, and many dreams, this film plods
along until it finally finds a reasonable 'peace' in the end, by making sure
that all the characters that live in fear, and are involved in the making of
the ugly scares, are either gone, or have gotten their come uppance.  In
between a surrealistic group, that looks like the same group that was the
revolutionary statement in the film BRAZIL, is engaged to get some of this
work done, but never does, and may even  be at the wrong address.</P>
<P>After the war, this family, living in one house is full of people and
relatives that do not have a job.  A butcher is the leader of the house, and
one day hires a young man who has pledged to do a good job.  And amidst the
usual odd events is the fact that there is a 'butcher' that also scares a
few people with his cleavers, and occasionally uses them. The suggestion is,
that in the hard times, any mender of the family that is just dead space
will be hacked up to provide some money for everyone.</P>
<P>The newly hired young man is a curious sort.  He is an ex- circus performer
with a very famous name, and the trickery doesn't get him.  He returns in
kind, and becomes in the process enamored with the butcher's daughter, who
also likes him.  As soon as the butcher is aware of this, he decides the
young man is the next target.  But we never really know in whose mind this f
ear is living, or if it is real, except that in the end of the film, there
are only the two young lovers sharing a roof playing  their circus like
music in their instruments.  A measure of peace has been  established in
this house, so it seems.</P>
<P>In the middle of it all, it is a surrealistic bunch of segments that just
come and go, as the butcher helps us learn who the next victim is, and in
the case of the grandmother, she dies of a heart attack, by just
'imagining' the butcher with a clever ready to attack her.</P>
<P>A fun, and weird movie to watch, it is well written, and filmed with your
confusion in mind, which makes it fun to follow.  Every so often there is a
new wrench in the works, and you go ... what..?? is going on..?</P>
<PRE>FUN MOVIE.
WEIRD.
HAS SOME BLACK HUMOUR.
