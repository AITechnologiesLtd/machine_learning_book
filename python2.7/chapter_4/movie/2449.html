<P>     WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, from renowned Swedish director Lasse
Hallstrom (MY LIFE AS A DOG), is a grim tale about being trapped in
Endora, Iowa, the self-proclaimed "End of the Line."  Recounting the
unhappy life of Gilbert Grape, the movie is not the kind of experience
that many viewers are likely to find enjoyable.  Even the humor--what
little there is of it--is of the gallows variety.</P>
<P>     Gilbert (Johnny Depp) has the weighty responsibility of assuming
the role of father-figure in a dysfunctional family.  His real dad is
long dead, the victim of a suicide, and his exceptionally obese mother
(Darlene Cates) is generally incapable of moving from the sofa where
she spends most of her life.  Gilbert's brain-damaged younger brother
Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio) has to be constantly watched lest he climb to
the top of a watertower and throw himself off.  Away from home, Gilbert
works in the local grocery store, hangs out with his friends, and
carries on an affair with Better Carver (Mary Steenburgen), the wife of
a local insurance salesman.</P>
<P>     If you want to see someone who has it worse off than you, take a
look at Gilbert Grape.  Virtually nothing goes right for him, and
that's the reason why, while the film is well-written (albeit a little
too long) and competently acted (with one exception), GILBERT GRAPE is
often an unpleasant experience.  This is the kind of motion picture
that can get a viewer squirming in his or her seat.</P>
<P>     Gilbert is trapped, and this comes across with deafening volume
through the wonderfully understated performance by Johnny Depp.  We can
see the walls of his life threatening to crush him--the grinding
monotony of his job, the desperation of his affair, and the lack of
freedom demanded by his home life.  He is George to Leonardo DiCaprio's
Lenny, and it doesn't take a literary genius to recognize the OF MICE
AND MEN similarities.</P>
<P>     Into all of this gnawing monotony comes a fresh face in the form
of Juliette Lewis' Becky.  Of course, Gilbert falls in love with her,
and Arnie develops his own sort of crush.  Like most of the characters
in the film, what we see of Becky is vividly drawn, but there's not
much depth to her.  It's a full-color snapshot, but there's no way to
tell what lies beyond the borders.</P>
<P>     Part of the problem with Becky is Juliette Lewis.  The young
actress, who was so impressive in CAPE FEAR, has continuously turned in
one-note performances since then.  There's not a whole lot to
differentiate any of her characters from the others, and it's becoming
increasingly apparent that what we saw in her debut was the apex of her
abilities.  Since then, it's been all downhill, and GILBERT GRAPE
represents a new low.</P>
<P>     Leonardo DiCaprio is convincing as Arnie, even if his performance
is, of necessity, over-the-top.  For a more subtle and telling example
of his skills, see THIS BOY'S LIFE.  The rest of the cast handles their
roles with aplomb, especially Mary Kate Schellhardt, who makes the most
of limited screen time as Gilbert and Arnie's youngest sister, Ellen.
Judging by the job she does here, Ms. Schellhardt has a lot of
promise.</P>
<P>     If you're in the mood to be cheered up, WHAT'S EATING GILBERT
GRAPE?  isn't the movie for you.  The claustrophobia felt by Gilbert as
his world slowly suffocates him is effectively translated to the
audience.  Had the film been a little better-focused, this could have
been a devastating character study.  As it is, it rambles a little too
much.  This leads to an uneven, albeit stark, examination of the life
of one man trying desperately to escape a prison whose bars have been
fashioned by fate out of responsibility.</P>
