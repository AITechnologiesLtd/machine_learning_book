PRIMARY COLORS
Reviewed by Pierce Dalton
4 stars (out of 4)</PRE>
<P> President Clinton not withstanding, Senator Jack Stanton has an issue.</P>
<PRE> Make that a major issue.</PRE>
<P> It is only two weeks til the Presidential Primary, and he is being accused of
something he did not commit.  So we assume.</P>
<P> A very close friend says his daughter is pregnant, and Stanton is the father.</P>
<P> And you thought the Monica Lewinski deal was major.</P>
<P> A political satire that isn't, Primary Colors is a viciously funny, very real
comedy/drama about the ups and downs of Stanton's run for President.</P>
<P> Based on the novel by "Anonymous" (later revealed as a Newsweek writer),
Colors is a mirror image film: a film that is so real, it doesn't even play for
fiction.</P>
<P> John Travolta is so go as Stanton, I forgot that I wasn't watching Clinton
himself. Stanton is a dead ringer for Clinton.</P>
<P>  Emma Thompson is no Hilary.  Her Susan is a warm, kind person who wants to
win the primary for, not just herself, but for her and Jack.</P>
<P> The rest of Stanton's team includes Henry (British newcomer Adrian Lester),
who narrates the film, Richard (Billy Bob Thornton), Daisy (Maura Tierny) and
the investigator Libby (Kathy Bates - who's excellent.)</P>
<P> Colors is a brilliant, hystarical political comedy that is almost as good as
the classic Wag the Dog.</P>
<P> Its not only satire, but an important film that could very easily play for
history classes, aside from the R rating.</P>
<P> It doesn't just make Stanton look like a womenizer.  It makes him look human.</P>
