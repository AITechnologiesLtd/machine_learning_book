<PRE>Sullivan's Travels (1941)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 66</PRE>
<P>Preston Sturges wrote and directed a series of successful
comedies during the 1940s, all of which for some reason
co-star William Demarest.  Among these comedies was
"Sullivan's Travels".  While it received no Oscar
nominations (Sturges had won Best Original Screenplay
the year before for "The Great McGinty"), today it is
considered to be a classic.  It missed the recent
AFI top 100 list, but only after an effort by Steven
Speilberg, who tried to substitute "Sullivan's Travels"
for one of his own directorial efforts.</P>
<P>The story has successful comedy director John L.
Sullivan (Joel McCrae) wanting to make an 'important'
film about the poor.  He decides to live the life of
a hobo, to learn more about them.  Along the way, he
encounters a struggling actress played by Veronica Lake.
Eventually he learns just how badly the poor have it,
when his adventures result in his imprisonment for assault.</P>
<P>"Sullivan's Travels" is Sturges' social commentary
with several messages, one of which (ironically)
is that film directors should stick to entertainment
and not social commentary.  Another message is
that there is nothing glamorous or revealing about
the lives of the poor.  This is best stated in a speech
by Sullivan's butler:</P>
<P>"Poverty is not the lack of anything, but a positive
plague, virulent in itself, contagious as cholera, with
filth, criminality, vice and despair as only a few of its
symptoms. It is to be stayed away from, even for purposes
of study. It is to be shunned."</P>
<P>"Sullivan's Travels" only has a few obvious weaknesses.
The film makes jarring transitions from screwball comedy,
to satire, to social commentary.  Sullivan develops
a case of amnesia that ends only after his conviction
for assault.  His status as a famous Hollywood director
should not entitle him to a "Get Out of Jail Free" card.
While Veronica Lake is gorgeous, she fulfills the
predictions of Lebrand "but with a little sex" and
Sullivan "every picture has a girl in it".  (Lake dominates
the movie posters I have seen for this film, implying
that she and not McCrae is the star.)</P>
<P>"Sullivan's Travels" does provide many fine roles
for character actors.  I especially liked the black
preacher (Arthur Hoyt) and helpful convict Jimmy Conlin.
However, the sadistic guard is a stereotype, and none
of the bums that Sullivan encounters make much of an
impression.</P>
