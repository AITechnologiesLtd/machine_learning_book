<PRE>                                I LOVE TROUBLE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Julia Roberts, Nick Nolte, Saul Rubinek, James Rebhorn.
Screenplay:  Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer.
Director:  Charles Shyer.</P>
<P>     If you're making a list of movie terms you don't hear all that
often, "caper" has to be right up there.  It puts me in mind of
light-hearted mystery with a generous helping of romance, beautiful
people in danger but not hard-core danger; NORTH BY NORTHWEST comes to
mind, or the THIN MAN series.  I LOVE TROUBLE is an attempt to
resurrect the caper, and you've got to hand it to Nancy Meyers and
Charles Shyer for trying.  They've put two appealing stars with great
chemistry in a fast-paced film.  They just forgot to give them anything
to do.  As much as I found myself wanting to enjoy I LOVE TROUBLE, it
barely managed to divert me.</P>
<P>     Nick Nolte stars as Peter Brackett, a columnist for a Chicago
newspaper loved both by readers and by the ladies.  Due to a staffing
shortage, Brackett is sent out to cover a train derailment.  There he
meets Sabrina Peterson (Julia Roberts), a young reporter for a rival
paper who resists his advances.  When Peterson scoops Brackett on a
lead, his competitive juices start flowing, and the train story turns
into a good-natured game of one-upmanship.  However, it soon begins to
appear that the train wreck was no accident, and when bullets begin to
fly Brackett and Peterson form a reluctant and competitive
partnership.  Along the way, antagonism naturally turns to attraction.</P>
<P>     Shortly after I LOVE TROUBLE started, something began to become
clear: there were no characters.  Meyers and Shyer had thrown two
reporters of opposite genders into a movie without giving them
personalities.  At least there was an attempt to do something with
Brackett; he is shown as a self-plagiarizing narcissist who has
forgotten what real reporting is.  The problem is that that
characterization vanishes after the first fifteen minutes (easily the
film's best fifteen minutes).  Peterson is written as a good- looking
prop, a sparring partner who seems to have been born a minute before
the movie started.  Nolte and Roberts struggle admirably to generate
some kind of life for their characters, but all they can do is flash
their thousand watt smiles and hope for the best.  And they go farther
than they have any right to, purely on the strength of their charm.
When they smiled, I frequently smiled right along with them.</P>
<P>     It sort of makes you wonder what they could have done with a
remotely interesting story.  The big conspiracy at I LOVE TROUBLE's
center is...unique, to say the least, but it's fairly tedious stuff.
The identity of the villain is apparent from minute one, and I LOVE
TROUBLE takes far too long to get into its main plot.  In fact, I might
go so far as to say that the plot never gets going, nor is it designed
to.  It's just a device to take Nolte and Roberts from situation to
situation quickly, allow their romance to blossom, and give them a
chance to exchange witty banter.</P>
<P>     Only there isn't any witty banter.  All told, I have to wonder
exactly what it is that Meyers and Shyer did to earn their
screenwriting paychecks.  Their dialogue earns chuckles at best, their
sense of pacing is extremely suspect, and their characterizations are
wooden.  Like their BABY BOOM and FATHER OF THE BRIDE, I LOVE TROUBLE
seems designed only to move along affably, without spark or
inventiveness of any kind.  The fact is, there is nothing truly
off-putting about I LOVE TROUBLE.  Nolte and Roberts make an appealing
tandem, and Roberts' performance in particular is extremely energetic,
perhaps her best work to date.  But since a movie like I LOVE TROUBLE
is inevitable in its outcome--the two reporters *will* end up
together--getting there has to be more interesting.  Without any
excitement in the suspense storyline, and with two bland characters
contributing to a singularly vanilla romance, I was left watching two
beautiful people be beautiful.  It just wasn't enough.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 scoops of vanilla:  4.</PRE>
