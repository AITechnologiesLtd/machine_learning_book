<PRE>SLIDING DOORS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Chaos mathematicians have studied a phenomena called "the butterfly
effect", in which a single butterfly flapping its wings can cause
tremendous shifts of weather half a world away.  The unpredictable
effects of a relatively minor change are also explored in Sliding Doors,
which shows how a seemingly insignificant event can have drastic
effects.</P>
<P>Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a public relations executive whose life is
starting to fall apart on one fateful day.  She just lost her job, and,
on her way back home, she narrowly misses catching her train in the
London underground...or does she.</P>
<P>At this point, the movie splits in two, alternating back and forth
between two different worlds:  one in which Helen caught the train, and
the other in which she narrowly missed it.  It's one minor difference,
but the effects spiral away in completely different directions.</P>
<P>In the world where she catches the train, she arrives home in time to
catch her boyfriend, Gerry (John Lynch), in the middle of an affair with
another woman (Jeanne Tripplehorn).  Yet, as traumatic as this seems at
first, it makes her a stronger woman, as she pursues a new career, and a
new life with a new love, James (John Hannah).</P>
<P>However, when she missed the train, her life turns out radically
different. Gerry continues his affair with Lydia, unbeknownst to Helen,
who, in the meantime, is forced to work multiple menial jobs to support
the two of them.</P>
<P>Although the parallel storylines might seem somewhat confusing at first,
especially to someone who is unprepared for the premise of the film, the
filmmakers do an admirable job at reducing the inherent confusion. Each
Helen is marked in an identifiable way (first with a bandage, and then
later with differing hairstyles) so the confusion is kept to a happy
minimum.</P>
<P>Once confusion is laid to rest, the biggest problem with running
parallel storylines like this is that one of the storylines might easily
overpower the other.  This is somewhat the case here, but it never
becomes an outright disaster.  The "catches-the-train" Helen has the
more vibrant of the two plots, and though the other Helen might get more
pity, there's no question of which one we'd like to spend the time
with.  The trouble is each storyline gets roughly equal time, which
means you spend half the movie waiting for the other half.</P>
<P>Paltrow manages the double role well, proving that her recent doldrum
has been the result of poor material rather than a lack of talent.  Of
the two male leads, John Lynch actually comes out on top (even though
he's playing the shadier of the two men). John Hannah just doesn't have
that much to work with, playing a Mr. Right.</P>
<P>Sliding Doors deserves points for being original.  However, an
unfortunate side effect of its split perspective is repetition.  One
crucial plot point actually happens four separate times (nearly becoming
an unintentional running gag).  And (magical musical chimes aside)
there's never an explanation for the parallel stories.  Perhaps it's
just a mental exercise for the audience...anyhow, an ending revelation
nearly makes the whole thing pointless.</P>
<P>Still, the movie is enjoyable, and what more do you want from a romantic
comedy?</P>
