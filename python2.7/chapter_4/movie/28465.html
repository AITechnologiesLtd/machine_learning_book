<PRE>"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"</PRE>
<P>Lady Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is a rich and pampered heiress whose
hobbies are travel, photography, foreign language and visiting remote
archaeological sites. But this is just camouflage for her real passions:
raiding tombs, foiling bad guys and, now, saving the world in the
long-anticipated "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"</P>
<P>Good, bad or indifferent it doesn't matter a hoot what critics think about
the live action adaptation of the most popular interactive video character
in history. Lara Croft has been a fantasy figure to millions of horny
teenage boys and a role model icon to a like number teen girls, so no
matter what anyone says, this is going to be a big hit. I'm talking
franchise.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, there is little more than a video game in this star vehicle
for Oscar-winner Jolie. Angelina does a fine job with her extreme physical
performance, doing many of her own stunts. She is capable, smart and sassy
and shoots really big guns. Director Simon West and cinematographer Peter
Menzies work hard to keep the statuesque actress front and center for most
of the film. There isn't much depth to Jolie's performance, thesp-wise, but
she cuts a good action figure.</P>
<P>As if anyone that is going to see "Tomb Raider" really cares, there is a
story here. Every 5000 years, all of the planets in our Solar System come
into alignment at the precise moment there is a solar eclipse. At that
instant, when the eclipse is full, a power will be unleashed that will give
man the power of God, the power to control time. The Illuminists, an
ancient cult that has prepared (apparently for 5000 years) for this moment,
need to find the two halves of "the all-seeing eye" and join them at the
height of the alignment to take command of time.</P>
<P>Lara's dad, Lord Richard Croft (Jon Voight), it turns out, was one of the
Illuminists, but secretly worked to stop the cult's plan and save mankind.
His mysterious death leaves Lara in a quandary until he returns to her from
the grave in the form of a read-this-after-I'm-dead letter. The clues he
leaves point her to the plot of the Illuminists and daddy appoints Lara to
take on his quest and put a stop to the menacing scheme.</P>
<P>Lara has to contend with bad guys, of course, and is prepared to go
toe-to-toe with the cult's chief henchman, Manfred Powell (Iain Glen), a
suave, handsome, ruthless adventurer who has plans of his own for the
all-seeing eye. It's a race against the clock, the planets  and Powell as
Lara must travel to the corners of the Earth to find the two pieces of the
ancient triangle before the bad guys do.</P>
<P>The cast is a bland mix of unexciting characters that have little do except
help or hinder Lara. Noah Taylor (the young David Helfgott in "Shine") is
Lara's sidekick, Bryce, who is supposed to be some kind of techno-geek, but
comes across as just a plain geek. Iain Glen is a good-looking villain and
I thought a love/hate relationship was going to develop between him and
Lara. It turns out to be hate only. Chris Barry is given little to do as
Lara's loyal butler, Hillary, wasting what could have been a good
character. Daniel Craig, as Croft's once-colleague/now-adversary Alex West,
is underutilized. Finally, in typical Hollywood style, Jon Voight, Jolie's
real-life dad, gets work playing the same role in the movie. (One editorial
note: Jolie's breasts should have received their own billing, they are so
prominent in near every scene, with a tantalizing hint of exposure in more
than one scene.)</P>
<P>Production is uneven. There are lavish sets throughout, but there is a
fakeness to most of it that makes me think "soundstage" not "far-flung
ancient archaeological sites." The fight sequences are pretty good and will
entertain the fans as Jolie brings Lara Croft to life. A whole passel of
writers were involved in creating the story and the script and it feels
stilted. It's a succession of action-story-action-story sequences that have
the feel of the video game that spawned it all.</P>
<P>Fans will be in heaven as they watch the personification of their
electronic idol on the big screen. For the rest of us, go to another movie.
It's pretty much what I expected and, not being a fan, I give "Lara Croft:
Tomb Raider" a C.</P>
