<PRE>The Road to Wellville (1994) 120m</PRE>
<P>One-of-a-kind comedy by Alan Parker.  It boasts Anthony Hopkins at his 
most eccentric and appears to be an attempt to redefine the screen 
presentation of toilet humor - because nearly every moment of the story 
is devoted to a body function or orifice.  Story is set at the turn of 
the century, when the popularity of Dr John Kellogg's new breakfast 
food, corn flakes, was part of a society fad for health and fitness.  
Two storylines look at both sides of the craze - the main one has 
Matthew Broderick, who has chronic indigestion, checking into Kellogg's 
sanitarium with wife Bridget Fonda.  The second story follows attempts 
of John Cusack and Michael Lerner to break into the lucrative 
health-food market.  We take our morning cereal so much for granted that 
we don't think twice about the impact that the novelty of 'breakfast 
food' might have had on its first appearance.  Although he doesn't state 
it as such, Parker uses this idea to lampoon similar health crazes of 
contemporary times - the Victorian sensibility of going through personal 
suffering for a cleaner mind and body doesn't seem too far removed from 
the high-tech torture equipment of your local gym.  </P>
<P>Delivering one hilarious organic metaphor after another, Hopkins makes 
for a spirited Kellogg.  Every one of his scenes is a delight, 
especially those in which he confronts his rebellious, filthy son Dana 
Carvey - easily the biggest flake he was ever responsible for.  The 
flashback scenes to their early family life are highlights.  Kellogg's 
clinic puts every idea into practice - colonic irrigation, 
vegetarianism, aerobics, dietary restriction, mineral baths, surgery, 
and sexual abstinence.  As if that isn't enough, some of the female 
clients opt to undergo a highly suspect 'therapeutic massage' by a 
neighboring German physician.  Film is consistently entertaining, but 
nevertheless overlong.  It wouldn't have made much difference if the 
Cusack sub-plot had been cut entirely.  As with most comedies, this one 
is an acquired taste.  You may have to chew it over 23 times before 
swallowing.</P>
