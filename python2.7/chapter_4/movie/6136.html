<P>     &quot;It's a choice between a devil and a demon... Which would you 
rather get, the flu or the mumps?&quot;  That's the way one disillusioned 
voter describes the 1994 Virginia Senate campaign between incumbent 
Democrat Chuck Robb (the son-in-law of Lyndon Johnson) and Republican 
Oliver North (the former lieutenant colonel best known for his 
involvement in Iran-Contra).  A PERFECT CANDIDATE, directed and produced 
by documentarians R.J. Cutler and David Van Taylor, chronicles this race 
from the North camp's perspective, showing in frightening detail the 
insignificance of substance when it comes to getting someone elected.  
This is something that political cynics have long suspected.  A PERFECT 
CANDIDATE (like the similarly-themed THE WAR ROOM, also produced by 
Cutler) demonstrates it.</P>
<P>     A PERFECT CANDIDATE is fascinating, if more than a little 
depressing.  And, coming in the midst of a Presidential campaign, its 
relevance is undeniable.  The behind-the-scenes events of the Robb/North 
war aren't isolated incidents.  They happen again and again, whether the 
election is local or national.  The same kind of strategy meetings are 
going on right now, in both the Dole and the Clinton camps, as campaign 
managers and spin doctors fight to put the best face on their 
candidate's performance in the latest debate or poll.  Elections are won 
on image, not facts. </P>
<P>     In 1987, Oliver North became America's most infamous figure, 
attracting huge television ratings as he testified that he 
&quot;intentionally misled&quot; Congress.  At the time, it was unthinkable that 
North could get elected to a local school board, never mind compete 
neck-and-neck for a U.S. Senate seat.  But time has a way of 
rehabilitating everyone (look at what it did for President Nixon), and, 
by 1994, Oliver North was no longer a villain.  In fact, if you believe 
his supporters, he arrived as a breath of fresh air -- a needed contrast 
to a Washington insider like Chuck Robb.</P>
<P>     And Robb was vulnerable.  A well-publicized liaison with a 19-year 
old named Tai Collins and a reputation for attending parties where 
guests engaged in drug abuse had marred his image.  North, whose 
campaign was based on family values and fueled by the (white) religious 
right, chose to battle Robb on moral ground.  Suddenly, Iran-Contra 
wasn't about lying to Congress and breaking the law, it was about saving 
the lives of American hostages held in Iran.  Former captive David 
Jacobsen went to bat for North, making a moving TV commercial and 
stumping for him on the campaign trail.  Polls showed the two candidates 
in a dead heat.  The very real possibility existed that North might 
unseat Robb.  The fact that he didn't in no way diminishes the 
importance of this film or what it has to say about American politics.  
Even those who disdain stepping into the voting booth will find much to 
mull over in Cutler and Taylor's film.</P>
<P>     As Clinton isn't the main character in THE WAR ROOM, so neither 
North nor Robb take center stage in A PERFECT CANDIDATE.  This film is 
about North's campaign strategist, Mark Goodin, a slick mover who 
manipulates the public to the point where North surges ahead in the 
polls.  Goodin doesn't have the personality of a James Carville 
(Clinton's campaign manager in 1992), but he's just as intelligent.  As 
the election approaches, he confides to the film makers that, in his 
opinion, all anyone cares about is the entertainment value of politics.  
Elections are about division, but governing is about consensus.  
Candidates are obsessed with the &quot;show&quot; of elections, not the 
presentation of serious solutions to important issues.</P>
<P>     Other characters given significant screen time are campaign aide 
Mark Merritt and Washington Post reporter Don Baker.  Baker's comments 
are especially noteworthy.  He's a hard-bitten cynic who can't remember 
the last elected official he respected.  Nevertheless, he finds North to 
be a compelling figure and a surprisingly skilled politician.  He 
acknowledges North's charisma, while remaining convinced that he's a 
demagogue.  Baker's indecision about North (he never reveals who he 
votes for) is indicative of the entire state's feelings, and the reason 
why Ollie's candidacy became viable.</P>
<P>     I don't normally comment on the technical limitations of 
documentaries, but a problem with A PERFECT CANDIDATE deserves mention, 
because it is distracting.  The movie was originally shot on video, then 
transferred to 35 mm film.  As a result, the tops and bottoms of the 4:3 
image have been cropped to fit a 1.85:1 screen.  Unfortunately, this 
frequently causes the heads of speakers to be cut off.  It's not a major 
problem, but it does create moments of consternation.  Perhaps A PERFECT 
CANDIDATE will look better on TV (provided the original image is 
properly restored).</P>
<P>     Framing problems aside, A PERFECT CANDIDATE is a startling, sad 
commentary about American politics.  If nothing else, this film will 
bring an entirely new perspective to every move and countermove of the 
current election.  I may not be allowed behind the scenes of 
Clinton/Dole (yet), but movies like A PERFECT CANDIDATE offer enough 
information to allow me to make some depressingly informed guesses.</P>
