<P>The tagline for "Rushmore" is "Love... Expulsion... Revolution." Without 
giving too much away, I would have also added "Reconciliation." For his 
sophomore film, "Bottle Rocket" director Wes Anderson has crafted a 
comedy virtually bursting at the seams with style and substance. 
"Rushmore" is at once wildly anarchic and deeply humane. I've seen it 
three times and enjoyed it more with each viewing. </P>
<P>The story details the adventures of Rushmore Academy student Max Fischer 
(Jason Schwartzman), an intense 15-year-old so obsessed with becoming a 
Renaissance Man that he can't be bothered with actual studying. When not 
busy with a mind-boggling number of extracurricular activities, he writes,
 produces and occasionally stars in highly derivative, elaborately staged 
plays, including a surprisingly gritty high school adaptation of "Serpico.
" </P>
<P>Shortly after we meet Max, two events radically alter his life. He falls 
in love with widowed first-grade teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams),
 and becomes friends with industrial tycoon Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a 
deeply depressed middle-aged Rushmore alumnus. Max enlists Blume's help 
with his grandiose plans to win the heart of Miss Cross, undeterred by 
her gentle, but increasingly stern rebuffs. Then the unthinkable happens..
 Blume also becomes enamored with the comely teacher. When Max learns of 
Blume's crush, he turns on the businessman, leading to a state of open 
warfare between the two.</P>
<P>It would be easy to think of "Rushmore" as simply a delightfully off-the-
wall comedy, but there is so much more to savor. Anderson is a whiz with 
a camera, using beautifully composed wide-screen images and gliding slow-
motion shots to visually punctuate the story. The music is just as good, 
blending a number of relatively obscure British Invasion pop gems with 
Mark Mothersbaugh's delicate harpsichord-laced score (the soundtrack 
album is one of the best I have ever heard).</P>
<P>Down to the tiniest supporting role, the casting is perfect. Jason 
Schwartzman, in his debut as an actor, gives a virtuoso performance. 
Employing a droll, deadpan delivery spiced with periodic bursts of pure 
adolescent angst, Schwartzman expertly creates a credible portrait of an 
over-reaching under-achiever. Max is absolutely determined to take on the 
world, despite the fact that he knows very little about it. Wearing the 
latest in geek chic, Max looks foolish, behaves horribly and takes 
himself very, very seriously. Anyone who remembers navigating the choppy 
waters of puberty will recognize bits of themselves in this totally 
focused and terribly lost young man.  </P>
<P>Bill Murray does the finest work of his career as passive-aggressive 
Herman Blume, an angry boy stuck in a respectable businessman's body. In 
an address to the Rushmore students, Blume speaks of the rich, urging the 
kids to "Get 'em in the crosshairs and take them down." He's not kidding. 
Blume hates what he has become and admires Max for possessing the 
vitality that he so desperately lacks. Even while being assaulted by bees,
 Blume can't resist smiling when he realizes that Max orchestrated the 
attack. Study Murray's eyes and subtle changes of expression and you'll 
understand just how good a dramatic actor he really is.</P>
<P>There is a lot of drama within the bittersweet comedy of "Rushmore." Miss 
Cross, in a nicely-tempered turn by Olivia Williams, mourns the loss of 
her husband, while Max mourns the loss of his mother and Blume mourns the 
loss of his spirit. Wes Anderson has nothing but affection for his 
damaged characters, and he treats them with the dignity they deserve. 
>From Bert (Seymour Cassel), Max's unconditionally loving father, to 
Magnus (Stephen McCole) a gregarious Scottish thug, it's a genuine 
pleasure to spend time with these people.</P>
<P>Anderson also creates an almost otherworldly feel by providing the 
characters with a level playing field. Young or old, tall or short, 
friend or enemy, each person carries equal authority depending on the 
circumstance. The towering Blume reacts like a whipped pup when little 
Dirk, Max's choir partner and sidekick (Mason Gamble, in a wonderfully 
solemn performance), indignantly berates him for betraying Max. Magnus 
abruptly shifts from wrathful foe to willing compatriot when presented 
with a benign offer from Max. In this weathered utopia, character 
actually matters more than size or social status.</P>
<P>And in the end, reconciliation is offered to one and all. As the tale 
reaches its hilarious climax, Max executes a grand gesture that pulls 
everyone to the same place at the same time, giving each character a 
chance to make peace with those around them. What a fine way to wrap up 
an ingenious, inventive gem of a movie. If you're like me, you'll enjoy 
"Rushmore" on first viewing and come to treasure it the second or third 
time around.</P>
