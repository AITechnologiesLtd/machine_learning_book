<PRE>THE RUGRATS MOVIE
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 stars (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        "Rugrats."  It's the most popular children's series on television,
according to the Nielsen ratings, a show watched by more that 23 million
viewers each week.  So it would seem only natural that after seven
successful seasons on the Nickelodeon cable channel, America's favorite
toddlers--Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, and Angelica--would make the leap to
the big screen.</P>
<P>        "The Rugrats Movie" is a just-in-time-for-Thanksgiving expansion of
the weekly program, a commercial-free, 90-minute feature blown up from a
heavily-sponsored, 15-minute television segment.  The result is
surprisingly watchable for kids and adults alike, producing only minimal
fidgeting.</P>
<P>        Judging from the closing applause, a sequel shouldn't be long in
coming.</P>
<P>        There's not much of a story--the irrepressible urchins get lost in
the woods--but the plot set-up is fun and gets most of the film's big
laughs.  Stu and Didi Pickles are expecting and, with the birth of baby
Dylan (aka Dil--get it?), big brother Tommy has to face sharing his
parents' attentions for the first time.  So demanding is Dil that Tommy and
his pals conspire to return his bawling baby brother to the "hop-sickle"
ASAP.</P>
<P>        The hospital in question is a humongous, international airport of
endless corridors, check-in lines, and tv monitors indicating due, delayed,
and arrival times.  The delivery room options are very creative, and the
nursery provides one of the film's first of many musical montages, and the
first of many references to bodily emissions, which had the under-twelves
rolling in the aisles.</P>
<P>        While the creative team behind "The Rugrats Movie" enthuse about
the themes of family loyalty, bravery, and friendship that run through the
film, the audience seemed more responsive to any and every reference to
poop, pee, or spit-up.  And Tommy getting hit on the head by a bottle or a
rattle--well, that just cracked them up too.</P>
<P>        Grown-ups are more likely to appreciate the first half of the
film--when the writers take amusing potshots at the universally-recognized
chaos that surrounds the birth of a baby--than the second.  Once Tommy and
his pals head for the great outdoors aboard Stu's latest invention, the
fire-breathing, Darth Vadar-sounding Reptar Wagon, the humor gets a little
more predictable.</P>
<P>        In the forest, pursued by the tempestuous Angelica and her
"butthound" Spike, the Rugrats encounter a variety of dangers, including a
"lizard" (some guy in a big pointy hat who grants wishes?), a wily wolf
("Red Riding Hood got eaten by one, but they got her out"), and a bunch of
simian escapees from the Banana Brothers Monkey Circus.</P>
<P>        Fortunately one of the savvier Rugrats must have planned ahead
because there's a never-ending supply of bottles and "diapees" on hand.
With little help from a couple of park rangers (guest voiced by Whoopi
Goldberg and David Spade), the toddlers finally make it back to the safety
and the security of their parents.</P>
<PRE>        And no doubt back in time for "Rugrats 2."</PRE>
