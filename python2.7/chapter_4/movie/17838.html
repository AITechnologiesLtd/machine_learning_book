Subject: Review: Still Crazy (1998)</P>
<P>STILL CRAZY (M).  
(Columbia Tristar)
Director: Brian Gibson
Stars: Stephen Rea, Jimmy Nail, Billy Connolly, Timothy Spall, Bill
Nighy, Juliet Aubrey, Hans Matheson, Helena Bergstrom, Rachel
Stirling, Bruce Robinson, Zoe Ball
Running time: 96 minutes.</P>
<P>The '90's has seen a resurgence of interest in '70's music,
and bands long considered musical dinosaurs have gained a new lease of
life.  Even many bands that broke up amid acrimony and bitterness,
swearing never to reform until hell freezes over, have buried the
hatchet to cash in on the nostalgia kick.  One such group is (the
entirely fictitious) Strange Fruit, a seminal '70's British band, who
disbanded after a disastrous show at an outdoor concert in 1978.  The
members all went their own way, most of them settling into mundane
nine to five jobs.  Only lead singer Ray (Bill Nighy) has maintained a
largely unsuccessful solo career, under the watchful eye of his
domineering and fiery Scandinavian wife Astrid (Helena Bergstrom).</P>
<P>Tired of refilling condom vending machines on the Spanish
peninsula, former keyboard player Tony Costello (Stephen Rea) has the
idea to reform the band for a twenty year reunion tour.  He tracks
down the other members of the band and brings them together for the
first time in two decades.  Guitarist Les (Jimmy Nail, from tv series
Crocodile Shoes, etc) has established a successful roofing contract
business.  Drummer Beano Baggot (Timothy Spall, from Secrets And Lies,
etc, in a role initially intended for Billy Connolly) runs a nursery
business and tries to evade the Internal revenue service.</P>
<P>Fuelled by nostalgic memories of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll,
the band heads off on a tour of small European venues.  They
desperately try to refine their old stage act and get it together
before they make a triumphant return to the very same venue at which
they played their last gig.  They learn that the industry has changed
drastically during their absence.  It's also a shock to hear potential
groupies comment on how much their fathers adored the band back in the
'70's.  Eventually, all the old resentments resurface, most of them
directed at the posturing, selfish Ray, and threaten to tear the band
apart all over again.</P>
<P>Initially, Still Crazy seems to suggest another hilarious piss
take on the rock and roll lifestyle a la Spinal Tap, but this funny
movie follows a different tack.  Still Crazy is not exactly exploring
virgin territory here, but it does bring some fresh comic twists,
bittersweet moments and hard truths to the old familiar rock 'n' roll
clichés.  Still Crazy will appeal strongly to the over thirty
crowd, who may well get a kick out of the film, and have fun
identifying some of the thinly veiled pop references along the way.</P>
<P>Still Crazy boasts a solid rock pedigree, with new songs
written by Mick Jones (of Foreigner fame) and Jeff Lynne (from ELO,
etc).  Gary Kemp, the ex-Spandau Ballet member and part time actor,
even taught the actors how to move on stage like the seasoned rockers
they are supposed to be.  Veteran British comedy writing team of Dick
Clement and Ian La Frenais also gave us the marvellous The
Commitments, while director Brian Gibson previously explored the
precarious rock world with the superb Tina Turner biopic What's Love
Got To Do With It?</P>
<P>The ensemble cast bring a potent mixture of weariness,
cynicism and new found enthusiasm to their roles.  Bruce Robinson,
director of the cult classic Withnail And I, contributes a brief
appearance as a former member of the band.  For this band of aged
rockers, preparing to take on the world again and relive their glory
days, the flame does indeed still burn.</P>
