<PRE>The Straight Story
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>***1/2 (out of 4) David Lynch revealed his view of America on TWIN
PEAKS. He continues his offbeat portrait with the true story of Alvin
Straight.</P>
<P>Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is an old Iowan with hip,
circulation, and lung problems (to name a few). He lives with his
Daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) who has a strange, Lynchian speech
impediment. They get a call from Wisconsin, where Alvin's brother has
just had a stroke. Alvin moons and pines for a few days -- he's not
really fit for travel-- but ultimately decides to go visit. With all his
health problems, the only vehicle he can legally operate is a riding
mower, so he hooks his old Red's to a trailer and heads north across
Iowa.</P>
<P>At first his journey is merely functional: the destination is the goal.
But over time it becomes Alvin's last great quest, the thing that will
give meaning to his last years of life. Offers for help are politely
answered with "I wanna finish this one my own way." It becomes a ritual
for him, a way to put all his affairs right before he goes.</P>
<P>Along the way Alvin meets a handful of characters. I was going to say
"colorful" characters, but on reflection, they all seemed pretty
ordinary. What makes them seem quirky is that they are presented in a
David Lynch film.</P>
<P>Lynch has a unique talent for making the ordinary seem strange. He does
this by focusing attention on details that most directors would gloss
over. Alvin meets a woman who has hit a deer with her car every day this
week. It's not implausible, but when that's all we know about a person,
they might seem, well, "colorful."</P>
<P>Lynch does likewise with props and scenes. A shot of a sprinkler stays
on screen long enough to give it some significance. It has nothing to do
with the plot, but Lynch lingers, obsessed with this detail. In another
scene, Alvin buys a grabber tool from the local Ace hardware store. The
scene might have been shortened or cut altogether by another filmmaker,
but Lynch shows the whole 2-minute transaction between Alvin and the
clerk. Why? Only Lynch knows.</P>
<P>Other trademarks of Lynch's are beautifully photographed settings and
appropriately evocative music. Twin Peaks was set in the foggy northwest
scored by a sad, simple electric bass. This time the cinematographer is
Freddie Francis, who shot CAPE FEAR and Lynch's DUNE. He captures all
the lush beauty of the Midwest. Rows of corn, rolling hills, vast
expanses of fields and roads all fill his wide screen. The music (by
Angelo Badalamenti, who also scored TWIN PEAKS) has a calm, folksy feel
that matches the cinematography perfectly.</P>
<P>The worst thing about THE STRAIGHT STORY is that it is slow. The pace of
the movie matches Alvin's own pace, which is ambling, at best. Combine
this with Lynch's lingering details, and to the casual viewer or the
average 8-year old, THE STRAIGHT STORY could be downright boring.</P>
<P>But this movie isn't about action or events. It's about characters,
reflection, and old age. Taken on its own terms, THE STRAIGHT STORY is
an excellent, thoughtful piece of filmmaking.  </P>
