<PRE>                                  MOTHER
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A doubly-divorced man decides to
          return to living in his mother's house in an
          experiment to understand his relationships with the
          women in his life.  MOTHER may well be the least of
          Albert Brooks's generally reliable comedies.  This
          one has a serious message in the end which comes
          off as a little contrived and superficial.
          Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     There is a very selective appeal to Albert Brooks comedies.  They
are low-budget, intelligently written pieces in which the humor mostly
comes from dialogue.  Like Woody Allen, Brooks usually plays an
intelligent neurotic and the comedy ordinarily comes from the dialogue
as it does in a Woody Allen comedy.  Where Brooks differs is that his
characters speak in a much more natural manner than Allen's and his
humor is more subtle.  Also his comedies often take a little longer to
settle in.  It is hard to judge on a first viewing how funny an Albert
Brooks comedy will be the second time around.  Usually like a
Thanksgiving turkey they are a feast the first time around but are not
at their best until the second or third partaking.  Then some of his
gags take on classic proportions.  Bits like forbidding Julie Hagerty
to use the words "nest" or "egg" are hilarious and at the same time
ring very true.</P>
<P>     That said, MOTHER is just a bit substandard for a Brooks-directed
comedy.  Brooks usually uses as a format the experiment that fails--the
good idea gone awry.  Of five Brooks comedies, only DEFENDING YOUR LIFE
does not fall into this "it seemed like a good idea at the time"
pattern.  In MODERN ROMANCE the Brooks character decides to break up
with a woman and then finds the single life is not all he was
expecting.  LOST IN AMERICA involved a wealthy advertising executive
who drops out, buys a Winnebago, and tries to live on the road.  This
time around, in what could have almost been a sequel to MODERN ROMANCE,
John Henderson (Brooks) is a man who cannot deal with the women in his
life.  To understand why he returns to the home of his mother (Debbie
Reynolds) to live in his old bedroom, decorated just like the old days,
in an attempt to discover what he will learn.  What he finds is that
his mother is hard to live with.  Eventually he discovers why his
relationship with his mother has been strained. But while the reason
satisfies him, it turns out to be a not very satisfying or even
interesting contrivance. Most people I know have problems to some
degree in dealing with their parents not unlike those in this film, but
Brooks's rather pat explanation for his case just does not explain very
much of the problem.  If the mother-son problems are dispelled a little
too easily, at least the script does not place all the blame on the
mother.  Beatrice Henderson comes off as an intelligent and self-
reliant woman who can run her own life just fine, thank you, and who
once raised two bright kids, John and his brother (Rob Morrow of QUIZ
SHOW).</P>
<P>     While I have come to expect a fair amount of a Brooks comedy,
somehow here his timing seemed just a bit off.  A scene early in the
film has John rearranging the one chair that his divorce has left him
in a large empty living room.  He tries the chair in four places before
deciding that it worked best where it was.  The joke takes too much
screen time for way too little payoff.  This is not the sort of
perceptive humor we expect from Brooks.  Later, when he is in his
mother's home, the film tries to milk as much humor as possible from
his mother freezing a big chunk of cheese and a salad.  These gags are
more miss than hit in this film's hit-and-miss humor.  On the other
hand, there is some perceptive humor in Beatrice's repeated references
to writer John's lack of Stephen-King-like success in his writing
profession and the greater success of her other son, the sports agent.
There are a number of very clever gags including a very impressively
managed allusion to the film THE GRADUATE--telling any more would spoil
it.  Like Woody Allen, Brooks seems to play the same character from
film to film.  Reynolds is, of course, a veteran actress.  She holds
her own against Brooks.  One minor gripe: in MODERN ROMANCE the
character was editing a science fiction film, in this film John is a
science fiction writer, but in each film he seems to be very
condescending toward science fiction.  In his most recent novel they
talk about the character "with the big head" and the one "with the big
hand."  It is hard to imagine he could make a living writing science
fiction if he is writing at the level suggested in the film.</P>
<P>     Since Brooks directs a comedy only once in about five years, it is
a pity that this film is so frequently not up to his usual standard.
His comedy about a mother and son learning about each other could have
been a lot more memorable than this one was, but there are still more
laugh-out-loud gags than most comedies, and there is a bit of a
statement here also, so I give MOTHER a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
