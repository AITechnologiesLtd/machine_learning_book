<P>During sex-ed back in school, the first thing our teacher said was "Sex 
is communication. If you remember nothing else about my class, please try 
to remember that." "Your Friends and Neighbors" is about six people who 
have a great deal of trouble communicating. Variously angry, self-
absorbed, over-analytical or simply needy, they couple in a variety of 
sexual combinations, but no one ever seems to end up satisfied. </P>
<P>After a screening of this pitch-black comedy, one very upset journalist 
exclaimed "They're not my friends and neighbors! I don't know these 
people. I don't want to know these people!" I said nothing, but realized 
that I do know these people. I dated one of them. To be completely honest,
 there was an awful period of time when I was one of them. Extreme as 
they may be, the characters in "Your Friends and Neighbors" are drawn 
from contemporary culture. Look closely and you'll realize that they 
really are your friends and neighbors, and maybe you as well.</P>
<P>This is the second film from Fort Wayne writer and director Neil LaBute. 
His first, the brilliant "In the Company of Men," created a sensation 
last year and made most "Best of" lists at years-end. A dark study of 
power and cruelty, the film ended with a revelatory scene that forced 
audience members to rethink everything they had witnessed up to that 
moment. "Your Friends and Neighbors" contains no such scene. The last act 
of the film takes place in your head, as you try to sort out the actions 
and motivations of these six people.</P>
<P>Jason Patric is a hard-bodied predator who rehearses his sex talk and 
plays tapes of it on his Walkman during workouts. Asked if he considers 
himself a good person, he angrily snaps "Hey, I'm eating lunch!" then 
tells of using pilfered hospital stationery to exact revenge by sending 
an anonymous note to an ex-girlfriend stating that she had been exposed 
to the HIV virus. He acknowledges that he may face repercussions if 
Judgment Day ever comes, but "until then, we're on my time." </P>
<P>Aaron Eckhart (Chad from "In the Company of Men") is a rumpled sad sack 
who confesses that his favorite lover is himself. He's not kidding. After 
a failed sex session with Amy Brenneman, his unassuming wife, he 
masturbates beneath the covers while she curls in the fetal position and 
pretends to be asleep. </P>
<P>Ben Stiller is a pompous dramatics professor whose sex talk infuriates 
his lover, Catherine Keener. "Let's just do it," she growls in 
frustration, "I don't need the narration." Both try to augment their 
hollow love lives by seeking extracurricular partners. Ben invites Amy to 
have an affair with him, while Catherine cozies up to Nastassja Kinski, 
an artist's assistant at a local gallery. After they have sex and Kinski 
asks Keener which part of the lovemaking was her favorite, she replies, 
"I liked the silence best.''</P>
<P>"Your Friends and Neighbors" is often bleak and occasionally nightmarish, 
but also extremely funny. LaBute films his dark character study using a 
number of distancing devices. There are no exterior shots in the story's 
generic city, and the character's names are never spoken. As a result, we 
watch them with an almost clinical detachment, enabling us to laugh, 
rather than cry, at the foibles of the sextet. </P>
<P>The acting is quite good as well. Jason Patric's intensity has worked 
against him in previous films, but it's completely appropriate for this 
character, and he gives a blistering performance. His finest moment comes 
when he describes his most memorable sexual experience. In a four minute 
scene with no cuts, the camera moves ever closer to Patric's face as he 
delivers an absolutely riveting monologue recounting a violent sexual 
encounter that he remembers with great fondness. It's twisted, horrific 
and a terrific piece of acting.</P>
<P>Aaron Eckhart is exceptional as the antithesis of his "In the Company of 
Men" character, particularly during a wonderfully nuanced confrontational 
scene with his wife. Catherine Keener imbues her damaged character with a 
humanity that softens the cold words she speaks. Her facial expressions 
when Jason Patric verbally assaults her in a bookstore are heartbreaking. 
As the foppish professor, Ben Stiller is appropriately smarmy, while 
Nastassja Kinski gives her character a wispy, beguiling feel. Amy 
Brenneman also impresses as the most enigmatic of the group.</P>
<P>LaBute uses extended takes, stylistic repetition and variations of the 
same scene to give the film symmetry. Sometimes it works and sometimes it 
seems overly mannered. I've watched "Your Friends and Neighbors" three 
times and, at different points, viewed LaBute as a ferociously honest 
visionary and a smug elitist. I'm sure he would be delighted at my 
reactions. His ability to both enthrall and anger is testimony to his 
skills as a filmmaker and provocateur. Neil LaBute is the real deal and 
"Your Friends and Neighbors" is a hell of a movie.</P>
