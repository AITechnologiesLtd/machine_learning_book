                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Powerful, multi-millionaire business man Harry Brock (John
Goodman) has come to Washington to bribe a few senators to keep one of
his business ventures afloat.  Along with him is his airhead mistress
Billie Dawn (Melanie Griffith).  After Billie has embarrassed Harry at
one-too-many social functions, he hires Paul Verrall (Don Johnson), a
respected journalist, to "smarten her up".  But, as Paul sets to work
on Billie, Harry comes to realize that he's getting more than he
bargained for.</P>
<P>     The original 1950 BORN YESTERDAY, directed by George Cukor and
starring June Holliday, William Holden, and Broderick Crawford, is an
occasionally amusing, but mostly-flat film, and certainly not
deserving of this kind of straightforward remaking.  If anything, BORN
YESTERDAY was in need of a major reworking - something that writer
Douglas McGrath was, for whatever reason, unwilling to do.</P>
<P>     Silly, contrived plots like this rely on strong, likable
characters to carry a film.  When such characters are not present, like
in BORN YESTERDAY, the whole project sinks like a stone.  The blatantly
ridiculous elements of the story become highlighted, the most obvious
of which is the movie's central concept that, in a matter of weeks (or
is it only days?), an admitted bimbo can be changed into a clever,
insightful woman by reading a few books and talking to a charming man.
I didn't buy the transformation.</P>
<P>     There are a few funny moments which save the movie from becoming
terminally tedious.  However, one scene that is supposed to be cute and
entertaining - a rendition of "The Twelve Days of Christmas" with the
amendments of the Constitution replacing the days - is embarrassingly
bad.  Also, for a movie that's supposed to be lighthearted, there's a
depiction of a disturbingly real instance of abuse.</P>
<P>     John Goodman is the only member of the cast who gives a reasonable
performance.  Like many good actors given unredeemably bad guys to
play, Goodman has a tendency to go a little too far but, even as he
chews on the scenery, he's enjoyable to watch.  The same can't be said
of either of his co-stars, both of whom continually cause winces.</P>
<P>     Melanie Griffith is at least better here than in SHINING THROUGH
or A STRANGER AMONG US, but not by much.  Admittedly, Billie isn't much
of a role, but there are countless other actresses who could have given
a better performance.  Ms. Griffith appears incapable of doing any real
acting, whether the medium is comedy or drama.  She was good in
SOMETHING WILD, merely competent in WORKING GIRL and PARADISE, and
downright awful in everything else.  At least in this film, she hasn't
been saddled with a role of substance.</P>
<P>     Don Johnson is a stiff as a board throughout.  At times, he's
uncomfortable to watch.  Since he's married to Ms. Griffith, one would
expect some sort of spark to come across between them, but there's no
chemistry evident.  I only hope they have a better time together
off-screen than they have before the cameras of BORN YESTERDAY.</P>
<P>     There's nothing to recommend this movie.  It's another lame duck
to add to Hollywood Picture's ever-growing collection.  With each new
film, it's becoming increasingly difficult to remember anything good
that they've been responsible for.  At any rate, with a combination of
Melanie Griffith and a decidedly-weak script, the quality of BORN
YESTERDAY - or lack thereof - should be obvious.</P>
<PRE>                           Rating: 4.8 (D, *1/2)   </PRE>
