<PRE>THE THIRTEENTH WARRIOR
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR></PRE>
<P>Rating: *1/2 (out of ****)
Touchstone / 1:44 / 1999 / R (brutal combat, monotony)

Dennis Storhøi; Maria Bonnevie; Mischa Hausserman; Sven Wollter; John
DeSantis; Asbjørn Riis
Director: John McTiernan
Screenplay: William Wisher; Warren Lewis<HR></P>
<P>When a pair of films from the same director gets released just three
weeks apart, it could mean one of two things: that the recently
overworked individual is due for a well-deserved rest, or that either of
these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while and the
timing is merely a coincidence. The latter's the case with John
McTiernan and "The Thirteenth Warrior," which finally hits theatres a
year and counting after its original spring '98 opening - and fast on
the heels of McTiernan's "The Thomas Crown Affair" remake, a flick that
got good reviews. You don't have to believe superstitions to wager a
guess that "Thirteenth" won't be so lucky.</P>
<P>Reportedly shelved following skirmishes between McTiernan and producer
Michael Crichton, whose "Eaters of the Dead" novel provides "Warrior"'s
source (and its initial title), this messy melange of culture-clash
drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish - sorta like
"Braveheart" without any of the passion. But the bloodshed certainly
remains: There's enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in
search of purely visceral thrills, though please note that the
admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and
dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their
dullness.</P>
<P>These circa-10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic
creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and a
dozen Norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the Viking
countryside. The good guys are loud, crude, often unintelligible and -
judging from their highly icky hygiene habits -- pretty smelly to boot,
which makes them perfect foils for the dignified Arab ambassador
(Antonio Banderas) who tags along quite reluctantly. They're also so
hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when a few of them meet
violent demises. You'll wince, you'll groan, you'll grouse, "Haven't we
seen this guy killed twice before?"</P>
<P>Banderas stands confused amidst the chaos, partaking mostly from a
distance as savages in Darth Maul facepaint and draped in the latest
animal-skin fashion run amok. He's not the hero - his soulful eyes and
lean build don't exactly herald a champion of Shwarzenegger proportions
- and "The Thirteenth Warrior" wisely doesn't pretend he is, allowing
his foreign and physically imposing co-stars to step into the spotlight
when the going gets rough. Let the characters interaction sans swords
and shields, however, and there's still a struggle - for the audience to
follow or even care about the story.</P>
<P>It isn't the end until audiences have witnessed a half-baked romance,
murky political intrigue, veteran actor Omar Sharif ("Funny Girl")
dropping by in a cameo role and a climactic "Indiana Jones and the
Temple of Doom"-esque chase through the villains' underground lair. All
this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of
cinematographer Peter Menzies Jr., but the collaboration between "Die
Hard"-helmer McTiernan and "Jurrasic Park"-creator Crichton should have
yielded more than sumptuous sights, graphic action and unintentionally
telling moments. Heard during "The Thirteenth Warrior"'s final scene: a
dog whimpering. How appropriate.<HR></P>

"It presents as comedy things that are not amusing. If you think this
movie is funny, that tells me things about you I don't want to know."
