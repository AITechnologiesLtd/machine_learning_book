<PRE>"Hey look! I made a bridge! And it only took me what?
10 seconds?"</PRE>
<P>Featuring the voice talents of Michael J. Fox, James
Garner, Cree Summer, Don Novello, Claudia Christian,
Phil Morris, Jacqueline Obradors, Florence Stanley,
Jim Varney, John Mahoney, Leonard Nimoy, Corey Burton,
David Ogden Stiers. Directed by Gary Troudsdale and
Kirk Wise. Rated PG.</P>
<P>I support Disney's efforts to move away from their
traditional "Broadway musical" formula for making
animated features. Though some great films emerged
from the Disney showtunes era, the format is tired,
and the latest installments have been weak. Last
year's The Emperor's New Groove was a huge step
forward. Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a step back.
Apparently, the animators were looking to place an
emphasis on story this time around, and they failed.</P>
<P>The movie earns points for making its protagonist a
linguist, of all things. Disney also reportedly hired
a real-life linguist to make up a language for the
Atlanteans, but more on that later. Michael J. Fox,
who, since beginning his fight with Parkinson's
disease, has become voice artist extraordinaire, plays
Milo, the scientist in question. He has dedicated his
career at a museum of natural history to discovering
the lost continent of Atlantis. His superiors have
rebuked his efforts, dismissing his obsession as a
hopeless flight of fancy.</P>
<P>Little did Milo know that his father, also a
researcher dedicated to finding Atlantis, discovered
an ancient book that explains how to find it. He left
this book to an old friend of his, who has already
booked a state of the art expedition to the fabled
underwater continent, and saved Milo a seat.</P>
<P>So Milo and a motley crew of military officers,
pilots, diggers and demolitionists, take off in a
bizarre-looking submarine to look for Atlantis. As the
advertising not-so-subtly suggests, they find it, and
find also that its ancient society has survived to
this day. But Milo's companions aren't interested in
studying these people; they want to steal the Heart of
Atlantis, the industrial-sized diamond that is the
continent's life force, and leave the inhabitants to
die.</P>
<P>Disney has ditched most of the extraneous elements
here; there are no funny sidekicks, no cute animals,
no musical numbers. It's all about story, folks. The
problem is that the story is weak, possibly even more
so than "ordinary" Disney features. The movie puts in
some strictly surface-level mythology to justify the
bizarre supernatural proceedings (the film has been
compared with Japanese anime, but even the weakest
entry in that genre has more guts than Atlantis) and
then bases its climax on the entirely illogical
presumption that the gang of profiteers would take the
trouble to destroy the continent before leaving with
the loot.</P>
<P>You can't have it both ways. A Disney movie must
either have the distractions that the filmmakers tried
so hard to purge or it must have a solid storyline
that stands on its own merits. If anything, Atlantis
won't be notable in 10 years as a new Disney
rennaissance a lá The Little Mermaid, but as the last
stand of tranditional cel animation against the
newfangled CGI that seems to be taking over the genre.
And while the graphics here are impressive, they
amount to little compared to the likes of Shrek.</P>
<P>With The Emperor's New Groove, the Mouse House proved
that it can still tell a good story and make a
terrifically entertaining production. Atlantis proves
that if you want to tell a story, you need a story. </P>
