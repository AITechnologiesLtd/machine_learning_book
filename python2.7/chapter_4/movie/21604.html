Susan Granger's review of "POKEMON" (Warner Bros.)</PRE>
<P> Pokemon is more of a worldwide phenomenon than a movie. Its
name is short for "pocket monsters." These creatures are stored in
spheres carried by human trainers who free them for friendly combat
whenever they're challenged by trainers of other Pokemon. The
merchandising madness began in 1996 as a Nintendo video game in Japan
and became an animated TV cartoon. There was a quick bout with infamy
when its editing techniques were said to prompt seizures in children
but that problem has been corrected. Pokemon next appeared in card
form, the collectable, swapable baseball variety, featuring more than
150 characters. Card trading so distracted children that many schools
have banned it; as a consequences, its popularity has soared. Pokemon:
The First Movie begins with a 22-minute short called "Pikachu's
Vacation." Then comes "Mew Strikes Back." Mew is a tiny, adorable
Pokemon but then comes Mew/Two, a bio-engineered mutation, who escapes
from the lab where he was created, bitterly vowing to take revenge on
the human scientists who enslaved him. He heads a super race of
Pokemons who have declared war against the original Pokemons and their
human friends. There's non-stop fighting until, finally, the human
hero, named Ash Ketchum, sacrifices himself to save Pikachu, his
chubby yellow Pokemon, a gesture that causes Mew/Two to re-think his
assertion that humans and Pokemons cannot exist in harmony. Written by
Takeshi Shudo, based on characters by Satoshi Tajiri, and directed by
Kunihiko Yuyama, Pokemon is contradictory in that it preaches the
futility of fighting while presenting non-stop violence. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Pokemon is a frenzied 5 - but kids
love it. Don't underestimate the tsunami of Pokemon Power.</P>
