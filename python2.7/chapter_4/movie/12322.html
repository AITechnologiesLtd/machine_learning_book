<P>What it means. How to say it.  Les Miserables means "the wretched ones, the
outcasts, those whose life is misery."  "Les" should not be pronounced  as
"lay" but as the short "Le" in Lenin. "Miserables" sounds like
"Mise-RABBLE," final "s" not pronounced.</P>
<P>Now, that was easy. It is harder to explain the ** 1/2 rating. I sometimes
run into people who pay me the compliment of taking my newspaper reviews
seriously, too seriously, and  say "we only see what you gave more than
three stars to."</P>
<P>This is disturbing. The whole system of ratings via stars is approximate,
does not allow for nuances. New movies are generally written up almost
immediately after they have been watched, so that there is no time for
delays that give reviewers to reconsider. First impressions can be tricky.
The most reliable opinions (and ratings) are after second or third
screenings, often years apart. Finally, lower ratings are not necessarily
dishonorable. Many a  **1/2  or even  **  movie can be interesting,
amusing, pleasant, entertaining, worth seeing.</P>
<P>"Les Miserables" has its ups and downs. It's neither really good nor really
bad. It's just OK. I'm glad I saw it;  I probably won't see it again soon;
I find it watchable though  unmemorable and not contributing anything to
the art of film.</P>
<P>This movie, like many others, carries the seed of its own frailties.
Pictures, including popular ones, from great books, very seldom make great
films, especially when the book is massive, like "War and Peace" or "Les
Miserables".</P>
<P>The protean, visionary Victor Hugo (1802-1885) wanted to be "the sonorous
echo" of his century. He did just that in his huge, sprawling, socially
conscious novel, which came out in 1862. Starting with the silent cinema,
it was made into films 15 or more times, in France, America, Mexico, Japan,
Italy, and elsewhere. All those works were essentially abbreviated
anthologies of various sections of the novel. None could do that tumultuous
book justice.</P>
<P>The closest any version came to this was the 1934 French  film directed by
Raymond Bernard from a script by him and Andre Lang. It was 305 minutes
long, made as a triptych : "A Tempest in a  Head," (120 minutes); "The
Thenardiers," (90 min) and "Liberty, Beloved Liberty" (95 min.). The
following year, the same two writers  plus an American colleague, condensed
the three films into the under-two-hours Hollywood "Les Miserables" (1935)
the best-known US version, starring Fredric March and Charles Laughton.</P>
<P>This year's picture was directed by  Denmark's Bille August, twice winner
of the Cannes Film Festival's Golden Palm, for "Pelle the Conqueror" and
the Ingmar Bergman-scripted "The Best Intentions." August 's earlier "Twist
and Shout" is also notable. I think that with the best intentions, the
filmmakers cannot conquer Victor Hugo's epic novel, no matter how they
twist it. But they did come up with a version acceptable by the public at
large.  Why? Because, whereas the novel was once read world-wide by
millions of students, literati, and non-literati, its public today is
minimal. (I had this confirmed by my poll of dozens of students and faculty
on a major campus). On the other hand, many --though still a tiny fraction
of the former masses of readers-- have seen the musical version of Les Miz.</P>
<P>It is impossible to summarize the original story, but many people know at
least the bare bones of it. A famished Jean Valjean  steals a loaf of
bread, for which he spends 19 years at inhuman forced labor. Released, he
robs a kindly bishop of silver forks and knives. He is brought before the
prelate by the police.The good man of God fibs, says he had made a gift of
the items to Valjean, and adds silver candlesticks.</P>
<P>The gesture redeems bitter Valjean who, with this capital, gradually
becomes a factory owner in a town, as well as its beloved mayor. To save a
half-wit con identified as Valjean, he (the real one) volunteers testimony
in court that he  is Valjean. Having come to the help of dismissed,
consumptive, dying factory girl Fantine, he flees, but saves Fantine's
child Cosette from the clutches of the nasty people who kept her (for
money). Under one of his many pseudonyms, he adopts her, cares for her,
later helps her and her suitor, the rebel Marius, and so on.</P>
<P>The constant in the book is Inspector Javert's merciless pursuit of
Valjean. This, the movie does well,  although it simplifies both the hunter
and the hunted. There is not enough footage to get into the heads and
hearts of those two, especially dour Javert, a clinical case who combines
pathologically cruelty, masochism, sadism, doggedness and a perverted sense
of values. Javert has an odd sense of duty and morality. He is what later
in that century would be called a "determinist" but without the
understanding of the determinist scientists.</P>
<P>Roughly, this goes: people are the products of their background and their
heredity. Hugo (and later, more pointedly even, Emile Zola) blamed society
and other exterior causes rather than the victims of this miserable state
of things. (Father Flanagan of Boys' Town was in their lineage with his
"There's no such thing as a bad boy").</P>
<P>Javert is convinced that once a thief, always a thief, that the sooner
criminals are punished, the better. In addition, Javert's father was a
thief, his mother a prostitute. The Inspector's own sense of guilt, his
hidden compulsion to make up for his progenitors, make him over-react, like
a puritan who goes to extremes, like a religious fanatic who has converted.
Like those extremists who are "more royalist than the King," Javert,
seeking his own redemption in twisted ways, becomes maniacal about
upholding the Law at any price..</P>
<P>He is a fascinating character, far and away the movie's most interesting,
even though there's a lack of screen-time to dig deeply into his psyche.
With the elimination of a host of persons and events, including main
character Eponine and most social and political conditions of the times,
the movie becomes primarily an old-fashioned melodrama in which we root for
the hero and hiss at the villain.</P>
<P>Each of the men is limited to two expressions: Liam Neeson's worry and
sympathy, Australia's Geoffrey Rush's (of "Shine" fame) nastiness and
monomania. They both get much mileage out of them. Oddly, they age
minimally over the years, something that did not happen in the marathon
French version. There, Harry Baur and Charles Vanel were the kind of burly
actors who looked older, as in all their films. Still, the current lead
players are convincing.</P>
<P>Thurman-Fantine is given all the stops of pathos to pull, and pull well,
through make-up and dribbling blood; young Cosette sounds far too American;
older Cosette-Danes fails to touch or interest us; Matheson-Marius is close
to a nonentity. The sketchiness of the Cosette-Marius "amours" helps
neither performer. But the smallish part of Beauvais, the small town's
Police Chief whom Javert outranks --and repels -- is excellent.</P>
<P>Missing too is the sociological canvas Hugo has painted. There's enough in
the film to show how miserable the existence of the poor was, but not
enough to hammer that point, or that following the French Revolution,
France became a  Republic but not a democracy in today's sense. The
historical canvas is vague. The press information speaks wrongly of the
1832 Revolution, when there was only a very short-lived uprising led mostly
by liberal young students. The viewers can have no notion that after the
1789 Revolution, came successively:  monarchy's fall, the First French
Republic, Napoleon, the return of royalty  (Louis XVIII), King Charles X,
the July Revolution (1830 's "Three Glorious Days") and Louis-Philippe, the
"Citizen King." The picture does not orient us about this, or such mundane
yet helpful matters as Valjean's fortune, his good deeds as Mayor, the
distances between places, the sewers of Paris, and much else.</P>
<P>Production values are good, with period reconstructions done in the Czech
Republic, Paris, and studios. The score misses its chance to use period
popular or folk music. It's generic, unnoticeable background stuff.</P>
