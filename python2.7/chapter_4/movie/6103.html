<P>     It's understandable if you think you've seen this story before, 
because, if you're any kind of regular movie-goer, you undoubtedly have.  
Drug dealing and addiction are common staples of '90s movies, and SWEET 
NOTHING follows a very predictable and familiar trajectory:  the hero 
becomes an addict, watches helplessly as his life falls apart, then 
seeks redemption once he has lost everything.  Perhaps one reason why 
this is such a popular premise is that it's such a frequent real-life 
occurrence.  And, as long as there's something new or interesting in the 
experience, it's hard to argue with exploring these themes.  SWEET 
NOTHING doesn't boast an outstanding script or innovative direction, but 
it has a pair of exceptionally strong performances, and that's enough to 
earn it a recommendation.</P>
<P>     The film opens with a shot of a still-living man lying broken and 
beaten in a pool of his own blood.  As it turns out, this is SWEET 
NOTHING's protagonist, Angel (Michael Imperioli).  In terms of 
chronology, this is virtually the end, and, as a result, the bulk of the 
story is told in flashback (accompanied by an unnecessarily verbose 
voiceover).  Angel is a crack addict and dealer who first gets into the 
drug world as a means of supplementing his legitimate income.  With two 
kids and a wife, Monika (Mira Sorvino), to support, the extra $1000 a 
week comes in handy.  Unfortunately, while dealing, he becomes a user as 
well, despite the warnings of his friend and boss, Raymond (Paul 
Calderon). He is trapped, always "chasing that first time high."</P>
<P>     SWEET NOTHING looks at four aspects of the drug culture:  the 
associated violence, the effects of addiction on the individual, the 
effects of addiction on the family, and the dangers of dealing.  The 
storyline and directorial style are both relatively straightforward -- 
there are none of the flourishes associated with TRAINSPOTTING.  SWEET 
NOTHING doesn't break any new ground, but, like all well-made, drug-
related films, it does cause us to consider the incredible power and 
reach of any controlled substance.  </P>
<P>     Many "drug movies" are so dark and cynical that it's difficult, if 
not impossible, to care about the main characters.  Not so here.  
Michael Imperioli plays Angel as a loving husband and father who has 
been seduced by the lure of getting a few more dollars for his family.  
It seems so easy and innocent at the beginning; everyone's doing it, 
Raymond advises.  Even the possibility of addiction doesn't worry Angel 
-- he falls into the common trap of believing that he can stop just as 
easily as he started.  Imperioli makes us see Angel as a good man with a 
tragic flaw, and, up to the very end, we're in sympathy with him.  </P>
<P>     Oscar-winner Mira Sorvino, who made this movie before MIGHTY 
APHRODITE, plays Monika with the same earnestness and vulnerability that 
she displayed in Whit Stillman's BARCELONA.  She sees what's happening 
to her husband, but is powerless to stop it.  And, though she loves him 
desperately, there are limits to what she's willing to endure.  When 
violence threatens her children, she's had enough.</P>
<P>     SWEET NOTHING isn't going to score any points with the drug using 
community, even though it's more of a character study than a "message" 
movie.  There's certainly no preaching, although the scenes of Angel 
scheming, dealing, and stealing to get money for his next hit don't 
paint an appealing picture.  Ultimately, SWEET NOTHING is simply the 
latest movie to explore the pervasive and destructive impact of drug use 
and drug-related crime on American society.</P>
