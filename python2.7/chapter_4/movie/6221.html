                         A film review by David Cowen
                          Copyright 1996 David Cowen</PRE>
<P>There's a sad magic in the feelings one experiences in the simple act of 
touching another.  A strange feeling of electricity or a thick feeling of 
ennui can seem to pulse or flow from one body to another, independant it 
seems, of our other senses.  The true magic of viewing a movie is that 
should a film engulf the viewer completely into the lives and minds of the
characters and the situations at hand, the viewer can truly feel as though 
they were experiencing firsthand the chemistry or emotions between the 
characters.</P>
<P>In a scene mid-way through HEAVY, Victor (Pruitt Taylor Vince) approaches 
his co-worker Callie (Liv Tyler) who is buckled over in sadness from a 
comment made by another co-worker, Delores (Debbie Harry).  Victor moves to
Callie slowly and cautiously, and then holds his hand to the side of her 
forehead.  Callie reaches up to hold his hand.  Soon after, as Victor leaves 
the room, he is grabbed by Delores who reaches out and holds him in a very 
similar way.  The difference is, we can _feel_ the longing and sadness of 
Victor and Callie pulse through the brief moment of contact that they make: 
but when Dolores reaches out to Victor, we feel nothing but the cold contact 
of flesh on flesh.  This is due to the fine direction and acting at the heart 
of HEAVY.</P>
<P>Victor is a "mama's boy" who works as a chef in the restaurant owned by his
mother Dollie (Shelley Winters).  Callie has been recently hired as a 
waitress, something that makes Dolores, the restaurant's other waitress, 
extremely upset -- Dolores believes Callie's hiring is intended as punishment
for sleeping with Dollie's husband years ago.  The tensions between Dollie, 
Dolores and Callie escalate as Victor is caught inbetween the three women: 
devoted to his mother, yet silently desiring Callie, and actively rejecting 
the advances of the flirtatious and slutty Dolores.  When Victor's mother 
dies, Victor can't bear to make the changes necessary to continue his life, 
flirting with his many options and rarely choosing to do anything.</P>
<P>While HEAVY is a film short on dialogue and plot it is unspeakably rich in 
the development and portrayal of the characters within it.  James Mangold 
infuses HEAVY with subtle visual cues to express the characters' emotions, 
and paces the film deliberately lugubriously.  Taylor Vince gives his 
character a wonderful, bittersweet air of repression, love and uncertainty -- 
nearly always having a facial expression that seems to not know whether it 
is a smile or a frown, and eyes that dart back and forth indicating uncomfort.
Liv Tyler and Shelley Winters both give authentic performances, and Debbie 
Harry does a spectacular job in a film much more demanding than the kind of 
drek she's typically present in.</P>
<P>HEAVY often feels so doused in emotional anguish that it feels like a fever
dream, the kind that can awaken you in a cold sweat and a panic.  Victor, 
when at the hospital visiting his mother, goes down to the lunchroom and 
tries to get a hot dog.  He is ignored by an apathetic server and goaded by 
a patient at the hospital who alternately seems crazy and the only one who 
can truly understand Victor -- it plays like a scene out of ERASERHEAD.  When 
the nightmarish aspects break, the viewer is left with emotionally agonizing
scenes such as one where Callie appears at Victor's house unexpectedly and 
notices a picture of her face that Victor had stolen hanging on his 
refrigerator.  Nothing captures the feel of HEAVY better than when the viewer 
watches Callie scan the kitchen with her eyes, not knowing the picture is 
there, and anticipating how she'll negatively react when she finally sees her 
picture hanging on the refrigerator, and what the impact of her seeing the 
picture (and the realization of Victor's longings) will be on Victor.  
Victor's repression is expressed brilliantly in one of the final scenes where 
he finally reveals the anger that has welled up in him throughout the 
movie -- only after an extremely long shot of him looking bewildered, as if 
he had suddenly come to the realization that he is allowed to express his 
anger and not hide it in his wince of a grin.  </P>
<P>Certainly, HEAVY isn't a film for everybody -- understandably, not everbody
enjoys going to a theater to see a film which portrays the sadness and 
longing of its characters and how they react to tragedies in life both big 
and small.  In a movie season of detached and dull films, however, the way 
that first-time director James Mangold sends these character's emotions 
beyond the screen and into the audience is nothing short of magic -- a magic 
unmatched by any other film I've seen this year.</P>
