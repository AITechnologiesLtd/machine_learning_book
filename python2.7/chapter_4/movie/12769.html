<P>   A major creator of designer clothes recently agreed under
pressure to stop displaying photos of heroin chic.  These ads
exhibited young people dressed in whatever hideous and
impractical threads were au courant, looking like zombies in
their trendy raiment.  Civic groups presumably feared that 
young and impressionable consumers would follow the
examples of their icons and shoot up or snort--just to be "in." 
In yet another recent case (the same designer?) an advertiser
was warned about using models who seemed every bit as
ancient as thirteen years of age.  The fashion industry is, like
many others including Hollywood, one based on hype and
image, but perhaps the enterprise that pushes spin to the
limit. The highly textured and beautifully photographed and
nuanced film "High Art" examines the lives of those who
create the glossies.  Are they jaded commercial artists who
are straight as an arrow and who cynically ply their trade for
profits, are do they come from more bohemian ranks, selling
out perhaps to raise money to buy more drugs?  The
prototypes in writer-director Lisa Cholodenko's engrossing
work may not be representative, but they certainly make for
more interesting viewing than would a bunch of square
professionals.</P>
<P>   Providing her audience with insight into the world of slick
fashion magazines, Cholodenko has thrown together a group
of three-dimensional characters who are studies in contrast. 
Syd (Radha Mitchell), a lovely, young, naive, straight, and
ambitious assistant editor for the fictitious "Frame" magazine,
is contrasted with Lucy Berliner (Ally Sheedy), a been-there-
done-that top photographer who burned out ten years ago,
presumably disgusted with the demands put upon her by the
industry.  Lucy's lesbian girlfriend, Greta (Patricia Clarkson),
an ethnically German woman who has moved to New York so
that Lucy can pursue her craft there, is differentiated from
Lucy's rich mom Vera (Tammy Grimes), a Holocaust survivor
who has no use for Germans.  Syd's boyfriend James
(Gabriel Mann), a bore who criticizes Lucy for not getting a
position of real influence with her magazine, is world's away
from Arnie (Bill Sage), a heroin-addicted guy who hangs out
with lesbians.  </P>
<P>   When Syd goes upstairs to find out whether her neighbor's
bathtub is leaking water, she meet the coterie of strung-out
somnambulists but is intrigued to discover that the woman
who lives upstairs, Lucy, was once a noted, published
photographer.  Ambitious to gain recognition from the editor of
"Frame" magazine, Dominique (Anh Duong), she persuades
Lucy to have lunch with Dominique and her own boss, Harry
(David Thornton), and is flattered, even ecstatic, when Lucy
insists on having Syd as her editor.  The relationship between
Lucy and Syd flourishes and, as they engage in some frank,
though unconsummated, sexual activity, each is concerned
about the loss of her long-term partner.</P>
<P>   Cholodenko has done quite a job tackling some major
themes, including the struggle between the demands and
deadlines of commerce vs. the free-spirited life of the artist;
the attachment of people to their constant sexual partners vs.
the appeal of fresh ties; the impact that a chance meeting
with strangers can have on a person's routines; and the very
nature of a person's sexual identity: is it fixed or fluid? 
Cholodenko deliberately keeps us guessing about the true
temper of Syd's feelings for Lucy, prompting us at one
moment to believe that Syd has changed her sexual
orientation while at another she has us convinced that Syd's
feeling is merely one of infatuation for a person she holds in
great esteem.  </P>
<P>   Ally Sheedy and Radha Mitchell give vibrant performances
as two women who investigate and explore their feelings for
one another, Ms. Sheedy breaking loose of her 1980s
ingenue specimen, Ms. Mitchell exposing every nuance of a
young woman at a turning point in her career and love life. 
One particular sexual scene has already become the talk of
the sophisticated film community: Sheedy and Mitchell do not
shed their clothes but engage in a tantalizing scouting of
sensation and sensitivity. With Patricia Clarkson squaring off
the triangle as a dazed heroin addict--a former Fassbinder
actress hanging on desperately to a straying woman--"High
Art" will attract a substantial following in the lesbian
community and should cross over well to a sophisticated
general audience of film buffs. Rated R.  Running time: 101
minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
