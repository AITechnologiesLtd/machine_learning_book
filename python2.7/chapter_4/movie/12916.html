Six Days, Seven Nights (PG-13) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>In recent years, Harrison Ford has been such a grave screen presence,
scowling through the likes of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series,
_The_Fugitive_, and last year's smash _Air_Force_One_, that one wonders if
the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained
from his system.  Apparently, it was just lying dormant.  With Ivan
Reitman's enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure _Six_Days,_Seven_Nights_, the
lovable scoundrel is back, giving audiences a fresh reminder of why Ford is
one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons.</P>
<P>Ford plays Quinn Harris, a carefree and slightly slobby (endearingly so)
pilot in the Tropics whose broken-down plane crashes in a storm, stranding
him and his charter, New York magazine editor Robin Monroe (Anne Heche), on
a deserted island.  Of course, the sophisticated Robin and the
salt-of-the-earth Quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down, and
all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their
first meeting.  While some of the lines fall flat, the formulaic motions
work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between Ford and Heche.
 Both actors, who have largely done serious works as of late, seem
liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders, and they
deliver their zingers, as weak as they sometimes are, with beguiling abandon.</P>
<P>Naturally, there's nothing like a life-threatening crisis to bring two
people together, and Quinn and Robin's warmup to each other is sped up even
further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates.  Granted, some
conflict needed to be introduced on the island, but this tacked-on
development from writer Michael Browning is a bit too obviously thrown in
for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes.  But the point is to
get the two together, and their newfound affection causes complications for
both, but mostly Robin, who came to the islands on a vacation with her
fiance Frank (David Schwimmer), who frantically awaits her return on the
home island.</P>
<P>Reitman, and old, reliable hand at breezy comedies, keeps the pace brisk
and capably handles the more action-oriented sequences.  His big
accomplishment, however, is bringing the old, smiling Ford back.  As
appealing and charismatic as he always is, Ford hasn't been quite this
charming and affable in years; he's obviously having a blast, and the
audience cannot help but have one along with him.  Holding her own is
Heche, whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she
initially promises to be (as the plane goes down, she frantically pops
stress pills).  She can take her lumps, physical and otherwise, just as
well as Quinn, making her a formidable foil and ideal match.</P>
<P>Formulaic and light as a feather, _Six_Days,_Seven_Nights_ could be cited
as a classic example of the summer "popcorn" movie season's lack of
substance.  It's certainly fluff, but it's unpretentious, undemanding,
and--most importantly--fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina
colada on a balmy tropical beach.  Pass the popcorn.</P>
