<PRE>                                            AIR FORCE ONE (1997)
                                       A Film Review by Jeff Shooman
                                         Copyright 1997 Jeff Shooman</PRE>
<P>First Impressions:  Everything in this film is riveting, from the action to
the actors.  Wolfgang Petersen's ability to make the obvious suspenseful and
his use of the element of surprise are huge pluses.  Harrison Ford delivers
probably one of his best performances, if not his best performance, ever.  A
remarkable film. <HR>----------------------
"Get off my plane," Harrison Ford's President James Marshall blares at Gary
Oldman's Ivan Korshunov in the climax of this film.  While such sophomoric
lines often erode the power of a scene, this line just made me realize even
more how immensely I enjoyed AIR FORCE ONE.</P>
<P>The plot in AIR FORCE ONE is very simple:  A group of Russian psychopaths
hijack the President's plane in the effort to secure the release of one Gen.
Alexander Radek whose release could spawn the death of hundreds of thousands.
 If they United States doesn't comply, Oldman will shoot a hostage every half
hour.  </P>
<P>There is a lot of code and honor involved in this simplistic plot.  At one
point, Glenn Close's Vice President and all of the cabinet members know that
the President is alive, but the question remained whether or not he was
legally capable of leading the nation.  Under a technicality, it all comes
down to whether or not the Vice President will decide to override an order of
the President.  This scene is very enjoyable and it will make a lot of people
think.</P>
<P>Moving on from plot, I've heard that some people think that Wolfgang
Petersen's action scenes were sloppy and cheesy and very fake-looking.  If
this is true, which I doubt it is anyway, I plead ignorance:  I thought Mr.
Petersen's action scenes, while maybe not up to the standards of such
technological extravaganzas such as FACE/OFF or even INDEPENDENCE DAY, he
made everything in this film suspenseful and he had me guessing until the
end.  </P>
<P>Harrison Ford's President is a true family man.  He is also a man capable of
firing weapons (Uzis) and beating up people, as he was a Medal of Honor
winner in Vietnam.  He is the ideal President, even shying away from the text
of a speech to the dismay of his advisors.  Mr. Ford gives this performance
more than it needed.  He added honor, he added glory, he played it to
perfection.  I often think Mr. Ford is weak in some of the characters he's
played, such as in PRESUMED INNOCENT or even THE FUGITIVE.  His presence just
didn't leave me with memories like strong performances of DeNiro and Pacino
have done.  He was a good actor, but not a strong and powerful actor.  Now,
my opinion chances.  The audience feels a bit empty (at least I did) when Mr.
Ford is not on screen for when he is on screen, you get this feeling that
everything is going to be right.  And even knowing that, Petersen still kept
me guessing until the end.  </P>
<P>This, my friends, was a great movie.  Again, as in a lot of movies I've seen
this summer, a very micrscopic complaint was that I thought the movie lagged
for about 10-15 minutes at the end.  But hey, we can't all be perfect.</P>
