                       A film review by Lax Madapati

<P>        Last Man Standing retells the story of the classic Kurosawa samurai 
film Yojimbo (1961) (which also 'inspired' another film for the Western genre
A Fistful of Dollars (1964)), with a little updating for the '90s. This one is
set in the 1920's prohibition era where rival gangsters fight each other to 
take complete control over liquor smuggling in Chicago. The film itself is set
in a small dysfunctional town Jericho, somewhere in Texas, near the Mexican 
border. </P>
<P>        The story involves a mysterious stranger going by the name John Smith 
(Bruce Willis) who enters Jericho in his rundown car and decides to stay in 
town to make some fast money soon after the first incident involving him makes
him realize that there are rival gangs here fighting for control over the
liquor smuggling from across the border and redirection to the 'bosses' in 
Chicago. Pitted against each other are two gangs, one led by Doyle (David P
Kelly) and Hickey (Christopher Walken) and the other led by Strozzi (Ned 
Eisenberg) and Giorgio (Michael Imperioli). The film is about how John Smith 
eliminates the two gangs with a little help from some town folks like the 
crooked Sheriff (Bruce Dern) and a bartender who provides him lodging.</P>
<P>        There are a few subplots in the story one of which involves Strozzi's 
girlfriend Lucy (Alexandra Powers) who switches allegiance to Smith after 
being ill-treated by Strozzi and plays a role in the downfall of Strozzi's gang
and another subplot which involves Doyle's 'property' Felina (Karina Lombard)
who Smith emancipates from Doyle's clutches and in the process, gets badly
beaten up. Some interesting and atmospheric scenes involve the undertaker of
the town who always acknowledges Smith's big hand in the town's body count.</P>
<P>        A film so inspired by the classic Yojimbo will suffer from comparisons,
fair and unfair. Whereas the original had a wicked sense of humor and plays 
most scenes with dramatic effect, this one does not. The subplot involving 
Felina shows the only sign of weakness of our protagonist Smith ('when you go 
down, it will be over a skirt' says the Sheriff to Smith!) and Smith's weakness
for women is the only sign of character we come to know, apart from the
obvious things like his unending thirst for whiskey and beer and his taciturn
and reticent nature. The only other character that stands out is that of Walken
which he plays brilliantly. The reviewer felt that Walken will always make a 
great Bond film villain but was too young when chosen to play Max Zorin in A
View to a Kill (1985), resulting in not too good reviews of that performance.</P>
<P>        Hill directs the film with gusto and panache, with a lot of slow-motion
sequences of violence and stylish camera as is his wont and forte but falls
short in the narrative side which he makes up with a lot of atmosphere and 
visuals. We even have a slight touch of comedy in the film - a little from
Smith's cynicism and a lot from the ever-happy undertaker. Right at the start,
Hill shows a nice contrast between a dead fly-infested horse on the streets
and a dead gangster all decked up in a nice suit and entrenched in a coffin.
Willis is right on target as Smith and the gangsters are adequate. There are
a few loose ends like why inspite of killing some of their own men, Hickey's
gang still want to 'employ' Smith if Hickey and company could completely gut
out Strozzi's hideout and wipe out their gang in one big attack, towards the
end. Also, Doyle and Felina's relation is never explained and if Doyle felt
so strongly about Smith's emancipation of Felina, why didn't he just kill Smith
? The film would have had a better impact had it actually been set in Chicago
and not in some vague Texan town.</P>
<P>        Ry Cooder, who is a Walter Hill regular, having previously scores 
Hill's Streets of Fire (1984), Crossroads (1986) and Johnny Handsome (1989) 
among others, comes up with yet another remarkable score in his inimitable 
style of fusing elements of jazz, blues and rock guitars with a few classic 
Western elements thrown in and makes it all blend well with the film's visuals
and mood. The heavy distortion he uses on the guitars in the scenes that lead 
to the dining table massacre by Smith to rescue Felina is very effective. The
record label Varese will be releasing Elmer Bernstein's rejected score to this
film. The editing is crisp and snappy. Camera work is very good for the most 
part except for the excessive use of light filters, giving some of the scenes
in the film a very glossy and polished look, which is unsuitable when filming
scenes of gritty violence and machismo. </P>
<P>        There is a high body count in this film and some of it is quite un
necessary. All in all, it is a fair enough film that keeps the viewers engaged
first to finish without really doing anything more. But then, it wouldn't be 
wise to expect more than that from a Walter Hill film.</P>
