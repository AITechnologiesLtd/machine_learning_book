<P>     Delving into the legend of Tombstone is nothing new for motion
pictures.  It's been done many times before, perhaps most memorably in
John Sturges' GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL (with Burt Lancaster as Wyatt
Earp and Kirk Douglas as Doc Holliday).  Usage of the Old West's most
famous shoot-out hasn't been restricted to big screen adaptations,
either.  Numerous television series have presented their version of the
Earp/Clanton confrontation, including a couple of science fiction
programs:  STAR TREK ("Spectre of the Gun") and DOCTOR WHO ("The
Gunfighters").  Coming in the summer of 1994, Kevin Costner will pin
Wyatt Earp's badge to his vest; until then, however, we have
TOMBSTONE.</P>
<P>     Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) and his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott)
and Morgan (Bill Paxton) have come to Tombstone, Arizona as
businessmen, seeking their fortunes.  Wyatt especially wants to put his
lawman's past behind him.  Once in the town, the Earps encounter an old
friend:  Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer), a suave gunfighter who's dying of
tuberculosis (or consumption, as it was then called).  Initially, Wyatt
and his brothers attempt a neutral attitude towards the "Cowboys," a
local band of murderous outlaws, but it becomes increasingly apparent
that there can be no peace with the likes of Johnny Ringo (Michael
Biehn), Curly Bill (Powers Boothe), and Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang).
Following their consciences, Virgil and Morgan become marshals, and
their edict that no one in Tombstone can carry a weapon leads to the
infamous showdown at the OK Corral.</P>
<P>     First and foremost, never expect a history lesson from a Hollywood
Pictures film.  I'm not that well-informed about all the events
surrounding what actually happened in Tombstone, but it doesn't take
much insight to recognize a story that's been doctored in the service
of "better" entertainment.  This era in America's past has been largely
romanticized, anyway, so its treatment in this film isn't surprising,
nor is the fictionalization necessarily a bad thing.</P>
<P>     The first half of TOMBSTONE isn't an example of great filmmaking,
but it is engaging.  There's a sense of growing inevitability as events
build to the shoot-out at the OK Corral.  The melodramatic "serious"
moments are kept to a minimum, and the various gunfights are
choreographed with style and tension.  Then, at the one-hour ten-minute
mark, the Clanton gang and the Earps square off.  From there, things
get progressively worse.</P>
<P>     Not only is the last hour anti-climactic, but it's dull.  Too many
scenes feature lengthy segments of poorly-scripted dialogue and, in
some cases, character motivation becomes unclear.  The gunplay is more
repetitious than exciting.  The result--a cobbled-together morass of
silly lines and shoot-outs--doesn't work well.</P>
<P>     The acting is adequate across the board.  Val Kilmer gives the
most energetic performance, but actors have always played Holliday with
flair.  Kurt Russell does a reasonable job as Wyatt, as do Sam Elliott
and Bill Paxton as the other two Earp brothers.  Powers Boothe seems a
little out-of-place as Curly Bill, and Michael Biehn gives an
emotionally flat rendering of Johnny Ringo.</P>
<P>     The presentation of certain characters is confused.  Initially,
the intent seems to be to apply the "revisionist western" mentality to
TOMBSTONE: the protagonists start out with their flaws exposed.
However, as the film progresses, the negative elements of their
personalities melt away as the Earps become the "good guys" of legend.
On the other side, there aren't many redeeming qualities to be found
for members of the Clanton gang.  Ringo and friends are portrayed as
evil, soulless scum who kill for the sheer enjoyment of it.</P>
<P>     There are also a number of superfluous characters, including an
actress played by Dana Delany, whose only purpose seems to be to
present a strong- willed love interest for Wyatt Earp.  Perhaps Ms.
Delany's role possessed more substance before the editor trimmed the
running length.  The same might be true of Charlton Heston's Hooker,
who has three or four lines in a minute's worth of screen time--barely
more than the venerable actor's WAYNE'S WORLD 2 cameo.</P>
<P>     TOMBSTONE is a passable western, but that's far from what one
might reasonably expect from screenwriter Kevin Jarre, who penned
GLORY.  From the audience's viewpoint, it's difficult to assign
responsibility for the most serious of this film's shortcomings, but
one thing is clear:  somewhere along the way, the creative process
misfired.  Large segments of TOMBSTONE belong buried at Boot Hill.</P>
