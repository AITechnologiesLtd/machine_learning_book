<P>Bubbles Galore (1996) - Canada - Directed by Cynthia Roberts, Written 
by Cynthia Roberts and Georgina Knight, Produced by Greg Klymkiw, 
Cinematography by Harald Bachmann, Sound by Mindy Melons and Herwig 
Gayer, Music by Nicholas Stirling, Edited by Cynthia Roberts and Su 
Rynard, Sound Editing by Phillip Strong, Associate Producer: Remo 
Girlato. Cast: Nina Hartley (Bubbles Galore), Tracy Wright (Vivian 
Klitorsky), Daniel MacIvor (Godfrey Montana), Shauny Sexton (Dory 
Drawers), Annie Sprinkle (God), Andrew Scorer (Buck Lister), Ed 
Fielding (Jimmy), Sky Gilbert (Rip), Peter Lynch (Dick), Britannee 
Bond (Starlet), Raven (Starlet), Sigrid Johnson (Starlet), Rosalba 
Martinni (Angel), Jessica Summers (Angel), Deborah DeMille (Angel), 
Thea Gill (Angel), Kirsten Johnson (Godfrey¹s Mother), Hillar Liitoja 
(The Journalist).</P>
<P>Billed as a "feminist sex fantasy", this spirited, imaginative and 
thoroughly engaging film by the award-winning Canadian director 
Cynthia Roberts, is destined for extreme reactions. Camille Paglia 
enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart-felt tale of the title 
character Bubbles Galore (Nina Hartley), a 
porn-actress-turned-porn-producer who faces an uphill battle in her 
quest for sexual and economic independence. However, those in the 
Andrea Dworkin camp, will no doubt loathe the film's decidedly 
pro-porn stance.</P>
<P>Political considerations aside, however, this is a delightful lesbian 
love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of Bubbles' 
romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet 
Dory Drawers (Shauny Sexton).  In the backdrop, however is Bubbles' 
loyal assistant Vivian Klitorsky (Tracy Wright) who pines longingly 
for the affections of her bubbly boss. This femme-butch-femme triangle 
is what provides the film with considerable humanity *and* sensuality.</P>
<P>In addition to the romantic aspects of the story, Bubbles is being 
stalked and terrorized by her ex-boyfriend Godfrey Montana (Daniel 
MacIvor), a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable 
as he can possibly make it. When his plans to sabotage her latest film 
fall through, he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her.</P>
<P>These proceedings are presided over by a most Heavenly presence. God 
herself  - yes, in the world of this film, God, is most definitely a 
"her" - and a chorus of undulating, scantily-clad angels, have their 
most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold, adding a 
lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction.</P>
<P>This bright, colourful and deliriously sexy film is chock-full of 
great performances. Making her dramatic debut, after appearing in over 
300 Triple X adult films, porn star Nina Hartley takes command of her 
role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many 
other contemporary 'straight' actresses to shame. Hartley has 
overwhelming star power, and one wonders why other non-Triple-X 
producers haven't used her bountiful talents. It is also interesting 
to note that Hartley appears in the recent release of "Boogie Nights", 
a film which takes a far more traditional doom-and-gloom approach to 
the porn industry.</P>
<P>Making a cameo appearance in the role of God, former porn actress 
Annie Sprinkle, a true artist in her own right - gives the entire film 
an earthy, sensual glow and certainly solidifies and, by her very 
appearance, downright justifies the themes of the movie.</P>
<P>The other performances are equally solid. Daniel MacIvor appropriately 
chews up the scenery as the villainous Godfrey and Tracy Wright lends 
able support with her complex role. Shauny Sexton, an erotic dancer 
and pin-up model, makes an impressive screen debut.</P>
<P>Overall, Bubbles Galore is a film which wears its politics on its 
sleeve and very proudly indeed. At one point, the title character 
declares that "instead of trying to save women from the sex trade, we 
should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for 
women to work".</P>
<P>The direction by Cynthia Roberts is daring and subversive. Roberts is 
not afraid to plunge the otherwise straight-ahead and simple narrative 
into extended and extremely avant-garde montage sequences. The love 
scenes between the women are especially beautiful.</P>
<P>The musical score by Nicholas Stirling blends cool jazz and lounge 
stylings, while the skilful cinematography by Harald Bachmann 
terrifically captures a blend of garish 70's porn and psychedelia.</P>
<P>Amazingly, this film appears to have received a good deal of its 
funding from a variety of Canadian government cultural agencies. This 
speaks volumes towards the importance of State funding for culture, as 
one cannot imagine such an entertaining, original and vital film being 
made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the 
day.</P>
<P>Bubbles Galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does 
not, at present, appear to have any traditional distribution in place, 
so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one.</P>
<P>It's funny, sexy and subversive. And it shouldn't be missed.</P>
