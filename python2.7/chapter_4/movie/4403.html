<P>     In the thriller NICK OF TIME, the ludicrously malevolent duo of
Christopher Walken and Roma Maffia select from a train station crowd
accountant Johnny Depp and his six-year old daughter Courtney Chase.
They seize them, put them in a van.  Depp is handed a revolver and
ordered to go to a big political shindig at Los Angeles' Bonaventure
Hotel.There he must kill California Governor Marsha Mason who is on a
re-election campaign.  It is 12:16 pm.  If by 1:30 the Governor is not
dead, Depp's child will be executed.</P>
<P>     Panicked and confused, increasingly desperate to find a way out,
Depp makes several attempts at warning the Governor, but they are all
foiled by Walken who is omnipresent.  Until, that is ... but I'm not
telling.</P>
<P>     There are five principles or guidelines or formulae governing the
thriller NICK OF TIME.  Not all of them work here but they all add
pizzazz and excitement to the movie.</P>
<P>     One principle is that political conspiracy is a subject so
believable that it can paper over at least some of a film's
impossibilities, especially a film like this one, as opposed to, for
instance, the far more credible THE PARALLAX VIEW.</P>
<P>     Another is "real time," where action and viewing time are the
same.  Then we get The Worm Turning, as Depp finds unsuspected
strength.  Fourth and fifth are The Countdown and The Missing Finger
principles.</P>
<P>     Real-time has been tried before, sometimes convincingly.  Alfred
Hitchcock's ROPE, an interesting experiment of ten-minute takes,
strains at the seams to make all its events fit the movie's running
time. "High Noon" does surprisingly well with its packing character
depiction and development in its 84 "real time" minutes.  The best
example I can think of is a sad one, since the filmmaker died so
recently.  It is Louis Malle's MY DINNER WITH ANDRE.</P>
<P>     The Countdown formula is in hundreds of movies.  Clocks and
watches, as in NICK OF TIME, in HIGH NOON, in DR. STRANGELOVE,
in war films, heist, escape, blackmail pictures and a host of other
genres, regularly show the hour and minutes as we near the H-hour.  It
is also done with digital countdown, as in director John Badham's own
WARGAMES.</P>
<P>     The Missing Finger comes from Hitchcock's THE 39 STEPS.  An
innocent visitor in London gets unwittingly involved in a murderous
spying plot, and has to flee.  Reaching Scotland, in a manor Robert
Donat blurts out to his polite host Godfrey Tearle that the ring-leader
has a missing finger. "Like this?" says Tearle, showing his
four-fingered hand.</P>
<P>     This fits Hitchcock's even larger principle of The Wrong Man, and
in thrillers stands for the most unlikely people turning out to be
villains.  In NICK OF TIME, outside and inside the Bonaventure, just
about everyone Depp meets or warns is in cahoots with the plot's
instigators.  The number of conspirators is incredible, whether they
are checkers with metal detectors or portable phones, a man videotaping
the meeting, people in the Governor's entourage, others at the highest
levels of the political scale.</P>
<P>     Helpless Depp goes from one "missing finger" to another.  When he
does find allies they are both African-American, which satisfies the
movie's political correctness and the greedy need for minority
audiences.  The helpers are successively a young woman then a
one-legged Vietnam veteran shoeshine man Charles S.Dutton.</P>
<P>     Most of the film is incredible.  Item: why doesn't Walken "wire"
Depp so as to hear everything he says?  Item: why Depp, watched by
Walken, thinks he can talk to Dutton undetected by Walken, simply by
covering his mouth with his fingers?  Item: why does Walken not notice
this?  Item: how does Dutton enlist aid so lightning fast and organize
resistance?  Item: what's the vision that Depp has, of successive
killings? Item: how is it that Maffia, trying to shoot the child at
close quarters in the van, keeps missing?</P>
<P>     The list is long.  But what would normally require impossible
suspense of disbelief gets nicely hocus-pocused from the very start by
non-stop suspense, fast action, breathless as well as imaginative
cinematography and editing.  The camera makes you almost dizzy with its
numerous shots, large variety of angles, close-ups, zooms that follow
the action.  The sound too plays effective tricks (from inaudible to
distant to echoey speech and noises) that reflect Depp's agitated
state.</P>
<P>     This a kinetic movie-movie,not an actors' film, so that the
performances are okay.  Except for Maffia's overdone nastiness, most of
the roles are underplayed, each with almost a single expression.  Depp
is Everyman in a nightmarish situation; Walken is satanic; Dutton
colorful but not in an insulting way; the several villainous roles are
properly impassive and you can tell right away whenever a new bad 'un
shows up.</P>
<P>     John Badham is a familiar name.  Writer Patrick Duncan is less
known, yet his credits include the Chuck Norris movie CODE OF SILENCE
(writer); the excellent 84 CHARLIE MOPIC (writer-director); the
little-seen, very good Kathy Bates starrer A HOME OF OUR OWN
(writer-producer).  Coming very soon: THE PORNOGRAPHER
(writer-director) and the Richard Dreyfus opus MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS.</P>
