Year Released: 1999
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>There are times when you just seem to disagree with what everyone else has said
about a movie. I’m sure out there (somewhere) there are people who loved Wild
Wild West, or thought Jawbreaker was a funny movie, there may even be some
people who enjoyed Idle Hands. But if I am  the major supporter of one film
this year that everyone else hated its got to be The Astronaut’s Wife. While
certainly got a quality thriller in the spiritual and life-changing meaning
sense, it still delivers what it set out to do in the first place, be a good
summer movie.</P>
<P>Spencer Armacost (Depp) is an astronaut whose wife is worried about him when he
goes out on his next expedition into space. While in orbit, Spencer and another
astronaut get cut off from all communications for nearly two minutes. They
manage to make it out alive and are regarded as heroes when they return to
earth.  But his wife Jillian (Theron), a school teacher, seems to notice some
differences in him after he lands. He takes a high class job in New York
without even telling her, and the other man he was up in space with dies. Not
to mention his wife electrocutes herself in the shower. </P>
<P>Jillian soon learns that she is to be the mother of two bouncing baby boys.
Twins that look eerily like little alien bodies. Spencer gets to be stranger
and stranger, sometimes he doesn’t call if he’s coming home late and he
always seems to be listening to different frequencies on the radio. We all know
something is wrong, but we can’t quite figure out what. Then a NASA scientist
shows up at her door with some of the medical records and documents on Spencer
before he got on the spaceship and after. All of the newer ones seem slightly
altered then the ones he signed before getting on the ship. Poor Jillian begins
to think that her Spencer is no longer human and some type of alien creature
has taken the place of her former husband. The idea is confirmed when we learn
that Spencer is stalking the scientist and beats her when she tries taking
pills to kill the baby. </P>
<P>Yes, I am fully aware that this sounds like an extremely cheap rip-off of
Rosemary’s Baby, but it’s not. There aren't any evil aliens with ray guns
that try to take over the solar system, the film mostly deals with the suspense
and wonder of Spencer's true identity. The suspense is drawn out just about as
far as it can, the film is EXTREMELY slow for the first thirty or forty minutes
until things get rolling. Theron is great, while slightly unbelievable as a
pregnant woman (she still retains her thin frame) she adds a lot of emotion
that you probably don’t expect from seeing the trailers. Johnny doesn’t get
to do much in this picture, and the only word I could come up with for his
acting ability would be retrained. The ending is kind of a disappointment, it
easily could have been made so that we wonder what happens to the her two sons.
Still, the film shot well, has some clever twists and turns, and has some
pretty tense moments. If only Jillian could have been able to discover for
herself what was happening to her husband instead of someone else telling her.
I think it would have been much scarier that way. A good movie in the midst of
August junk, The Astronaut’s Wife gets *** stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: Tense moments, and death by electrocution occurs near the
beginning and end of the film. A man also rapes his wife and there is some
language. Good Age 14 & Up</P>
