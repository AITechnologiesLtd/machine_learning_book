<PRE>                                  PARTY GIRL
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<PRE>     "I don't have a job.  I'm a loser.  Shoot me!"</PRE>
<P>     This pretty much sums up the early attitude of the title character
in PARTY GIRL, a new film by Daisy von Scherler Mayer, about the
misadventures of a New York City diva who finds her life suddenly
falling apart.  Parker Posey plays Mary, the Party Girl in question,
whose flair and style are matched only by her inability to do anything
productive with her life.</P>
<P>     Mary is an old-style slacker of the first degree.  The picture
opens with Mary hosting a party to cover this month's rent, only to get
busted by the cops and having to call her librarian godmother (Sasha
von Scherler) to bail her out.  Godmother takes pity and gives Mary a
job as a library clerk, which seems to suit the carefree socialite like
a designer muumuu.  Interspersed with Mary's quest to find her place in
the fascinating world of library science, she frequents party after
party, always in search of the hippest hangout and the ultimate cool
time.</P>
<P>     PARTY GIRL is something of an allegory to the existentialist
literature it refers to: Mary is in search of life's meaning in a
world which appears to have none.  This New York is completely surreal,
full of ultra-hip people and places that are usually too cute for their
own good.  In the end, Mary can't find a shred of meaning in this
world, so she turns to...the Dewey Decimal System.  And it gets weirder
than that, perhaps the most bizarre part of the film being an
inexplicable romance Mary has with a street falafel vendor (Omar
Townsend).</P>
<P>     PARTY GIRL ends up being a mostly-entertaining movie.  It isn't
the raucous comedy it's billed as, but the funny bits are worth the
price of admission.  Posey is electric, a consummate professional (and
the only one in the cast who nails her lines every time).  It's
incredible how she makes the most mundane thing look cool; the most
enjoyable part of PARTY GIRL just might be seeing what Posey is wearing
in the next scene, and managing to outdo what she had on previously.</P>
<P>     The film takes quite awhile to really get rolling, and that's
largely due to the relatively inexperienced supporting cast and the low
low budget which allowed for only two takes of any scene.  As a result,
much of the movie's dialogue is stilted and just doesn't flow smoothly
enough to convey the sarcastic wit all of these characters are supposed
to be imbued with.  The budget has also burdened PARTY GIRL with some
damaging sound problems.</P>
<P>     Also, while Mary's parties are to die for, her search for a career
is uninspired.  What begins as a comedic Mary vs. The World ends up
being an overdramatic Mary vs. The Dewey Decimal System--not what I was
expecting, and probably not what the audience wants to watch.  I wish
the filmmakers had taken Mary's own advice here:  "Lighten up!  It's a
party!"</P>
<PRE>     Isn't it?</PRE>
