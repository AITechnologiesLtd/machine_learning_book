                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Believe it or not, this is a Christmas movie!  And here it is, the
middle of April, and there's nothing else I'd rather see.</P>
<P>     Let me put it this way: GO is the best movie I've seen since
FARGO.  Doug Liman, the man behind the brilliant SWINGERS (which, I
realized, came out much too long ago, in 1996), has concocted such a
film that I'm almost compelled to pay the whopping $8.50 to see it
again.</P>
<P>     GO is a seamier look at life than SWINGERS, brilliantly
deconstructing Gen X life in latter-day Los Angeles, giving a new
perspective on rave culture, drug dealers, the lure of Vegas, and even
Amway distributorship.  Through the lead characters of Ronna (Polley),
Claire (Holmes), and Simon (Askew), you'll never look at grocery store
clerks the same way.</P>
<P>     GO owes its clever structure to PULP FICTION, following multiple
interlocking storylines and bouncing back and forth chronologically.  To
attempt to distill the plotlines here is to do the film an injustice,
but it centers around Ronna's attempt to get $380 to pay the rent, which
leads her to try to sell 20 hits of Ecstasy in a drug deal gone awry. 
Really awry.  Completely unpredictable.  Hilarious.  All of it unified
through the phrase, "Go!"</P>
<P>     I can't say enough good things about GO, and I urge you to see it. 
The acting, directing, and especially August's writing are all far
better than we're all used to.  You may not even know how to react.</P>
<P>     That's why GO gets filmcritic.com's coveted and rarely awarded:</P>
