<P>     "Schutt's novel THE SLINGSHOT is brimming with ideas.  The movie
is my interpretation of what I felt when I read the book.  That's
always the way it is--a direct translation isn't possible.  The world
described in the book appeals to me...There is a terrific vitality in
this story and an undertone of absurdity that really turned me on.  The
existential questions we formulate during prepubescence are important
throughout our lives."
     - Ake Sandgren, writer/director of THE SLINGSHOT</P>
<P>     It's interesting how almost every film out of Sweden evokes, in
one way or another, impressions of Ingmar Bergman's work.  THE
SLINGSHOT is certainly not a Bergman-derivative--it's almost too
lighthearted for that--but there are moments here and there when one
could imagine something similar from the great director.</P>
<P>     THE SLINGSHOT is a wonderful mix of tragedy, humor, and triumph.
Set in the 1920s, it explores some of the difficult realities of
growing up as a boy in Sweden, especially for someone like Roland
(Jesper Salen), whose mother Zipa (Basia Frydman) is a Jew and whose
father Fritiof (Stellan Skarsgard) is devout socialist.  Roland is
often the target of bullying and name-calling, but the resilient lad
always seems to bounce back from whatever problems beset him, often in
the most unexpected of ways.  On one occasion when he needs money,
Roland fashions slingshots out of scrap metal and condoms, then sells
them to his schoolmates.  Then there's the time when he has some fun
with a few lice....</P>
<P>     Over the past few years, there have been quite a number of coming-
of-age stories (both foreign and domestic), from the nostalgic JACQUOT
and the offbeat LEOLO to the endearing KING OF THE HILL.  THE SLINGSHOT
fits right into an open slot in this broad category, with its familiar
tone applied to unique characters and situations.</P>
<P>     THE SLINGSHOT successfully manages to navigate the turbulent
waters of Roland's boyhood adventures as they turn from the absurd to
the heartwrenching.  Writer/director Ake Sandgren displays a deft hand
in seamlessly melding drama and comedy.  He also creates a series of
rich screen personalities who could easily slip into comfortable
stereotypes, but don't.</P>
<P>     Take Fritiof, for example.  At first, this man seems to be the
typical "Swedish father figure"--someone who is stern, demanding, and
distanced from his children.  As THE SLINGSHOT progresses, however, we
learn that there's a lot more to Fritiof than is initially evident, and
his relationship with both his sons has more facets than might
initially be supposed.</P>
<P>     THE SLINGSHOT's lone failing comes when it skims across
philosophical issues of existence.  Perhaps because of the brevity with
which they are examined, or maybe because they are introduced from the
perspective of a ten-year-old, these themes seem out-of-place.</P>
<P>     With a trio of formidable performances (by Salen, Skarsgard, and
Frydman), THE SLINGSHOT offers a moving, intriguing look at the
difficulties faced by one child set adrift in a sea of bigotry where
his own resourcefulness is the key to survival.  There's more to this
film than is suggested by its apparently-simple story, and it's a
tribute to the ability of Ake Sandgren and his cast that so much is
realized.</P>
