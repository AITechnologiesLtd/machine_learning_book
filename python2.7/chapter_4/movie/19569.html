<P>One of the key signatures of a Stanley Kubrick film is that it can be read
on several different levels. In many circles, Dr. Strangelove and 2001: A
Space Odyssey are accepted as allegorical sexual satires. Many people
believe The Shining to be a racial statement against the evils of killing
Indians. Even Spartacus is not safe from intricate deconstruction. And now
comes along Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick's most thematically complex and
intellectually stimulating film yet. It is also one of his greatest.</P>
<P>Regarding Eyes Wide Shut as merely a plot-driven psychological thriller is
doing the film a great injustice. In fact, I prefer not to take the film
literally at all. Many critics have blasted Kubrick's swan song for being
too much of a free-form, open ended, unsexy bore; shame on them! If you need
pervasive sex to have a satisfactory movie-going experience, look elsewhere.
Based on Arthur Schnitzler's classic novella "Traumnovelle", Eyes Wide
Shut's sole purpose is to evoke a strange, nightmare-like state. The
criticism that the film has no real conclusion is highly inept. After all,
when was the last time you had a dream or nightmare that had any kind of
resolution? This is a tough film that raises some very serious questions,
and is brave enough to admit that it has no clear-cut, black and white
answers. The viewer is left to make his own conclusions and judgments,
something virtually unheard of in modern film making.</P>
<P>At the heart of the story is Dr. Bill Harford's (Tom Cruise) night of sexual
odyssey through the streets of New York and the harsh reality that follows.
In many ways, the plot is very reminiscent of Martin Scorsese's forgotten
sleeper After Hours, which consisted of short, bizarre vignettes where the
hero was at the mercy of whatever oddball he might have the misfortune of
running into. Such is Dr. Bill's case; in the coarse of one night, he has
lost almost all control of his life and becomes dependent of other people's
actions. The phrase "in over his head" doesn't even begin to describe the
potentially deadly situations he gets himself involved in.</P>
<P>The fuel for his fire is jealousy over his wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman,
taking a much more supporting role than was expected). It seems that during
their Cape Cod vacation over a year ago, she was sexually tempted by an
unknown Naval officer, claiming that she would have given up everything -
Bill, their daughter, even her future - for just one night with this
anonymous sailor. Throughout the night, Bill is periodically enflamed by
fantasies of his wife with the officer. This only pushes him further and
further into his self-dug hole.</P>
<P>This is, of course, a very literal interpretation of the story. As I said,
the film is best when viewed in a less superficial light. It is, in all
aspects, a dream (or nightmare, perhaps) put onto celluloid.</P>
<P>Much has been said of the climactic orgy sequence (which, ironically, comes
mid-way through the film) and the digital "masking" that it underwent for
American release. While I am steadfastly against tampering with the work of
a genius, I do believe that some people are making too much of this. The
fact that the studio felt the hypocritical need to cater to younger
audiences (which the movie is clearly not meant for to begin with) is
reprehensible, but if nobody knew that 65 seconds of film had been altered,
I feel confident that the orgy sequence would be remembered as the
brilliantly effective scene that it is. Trust me; it is absolutely
terrifying even as it stands.</P>
<P>Alas, some people are outraged by this alteration (Roger Ebert has dubbed it
the "Austin Powers" version, referring to the strategic placement of objects
to hide certain body parts), even going as far as to dock the film a
half-star for a mistake on the studio's part. Frankly, I find this
laughable; it's almost as if they are looking for a reason to withhold a top
rating for fear of seeming biased. However, I am not afraid to say it; Eyes
Wide Shut is a masterwork, possibly the finest film of the decade and
certainly more than worthy of being a genius' final testament.</P>
