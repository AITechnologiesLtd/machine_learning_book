<P>     This cornball combo of CRIMSON TIDE and STRIPES plays far better
than it deserves to.  Television star Kelsey Grammer-- known to millions
as the beloved Sideshow Bob on "The Simpsons"-- makes his feature-film
debut as an unorthodox military officer who must win a war game to prove
that he's worthy of his own command.  Sound familiar?  (Among other
things, he must whip a misfit crew into shipshape shape.  Yawn.  The
same plot is used in Jonathan Lynn's SGT. BILKO, which stars Steve
Martin and opens later this month.)</P>
<P>     DOWN PERISCOPE takes about 45 minutes to get up to laugh-out-loud
speed.  Grammer's subdued performance is hard to fathom at first, but an
extended "silent running" sequence-- near the middle of the movie--
marks the transition from "mildly amusing" to "infectious fun." The
bland ensemble cast finally begins to gel over a couple of good sonar
gags and one hilarious bit of flatulence.  (Some semi-serious submarine
stalking is also fun, despite the obvious stock footage.  Think Tom
Clancy lite.)</P>
<P>     Grammer considerations aside, the rest of the cast is exceptionally
unexceptional.  Even Rip Torn's Admiral doesn't add much, though he
*does* get to growl the memorable line: "I want a man with a tattoo on
his dick!" (Don't ask; it's a plot point.) The jokes directed at Lauren
Holly-- as the lone female crew member-- are equally non- PC, but who
can argue with a movie that has the chutzpah to include both a rallying
rendition of "Anchor's Aweigh" and a music video of Kelsey Grammer and
the Village People singing "In the Navy?"</P>
<PRE>     I won't ask any questions.</PRE>
