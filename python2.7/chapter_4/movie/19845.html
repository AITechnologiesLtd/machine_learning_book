<P>   Limbo must be a fascinating place indeed, the subject of so
many movies during the past 12 months.  In John Sayles'
"Limbo," lost souls are stranded on a deserted island
wondering whether the chopper approaching to pick them up
houses friend or foe.  Vincent Ward's "What Dreams May
Come" centers on a fellow who seeks his wife in a literal
purgatory.  In "The Sixth Sense," a force is not ready to go to
his final resting place until he is redeemed, and in "The
Haunting" some silly dead kids, worked to death by a 19th
century robber baron, slide and glide under sheets and pillars
of a capacious mansion awaiting their maternal savior. 
These films, some effective, some not, possess features that 
endear them to some audiences, but they are hardly hair-
rising.  Unless you're one of those fans taken in by a dazzling
marketing campaign for the inept "The Blair Witch Project,"
you'll wonder whether the summer season will be devoid of
genuine, spine-chilling terror.  If you've been fearing not at
what Hollywood and the indie studios have offered so far,
then fear not: "Stir of Echoes" answers our plea.</P>
<P>   Directing his own script from Richard Matheson's book,
David Koepp (scripter for "Jurassic Park," "Mission:
Impossible," "The Lost World," "Snake Eyes") displays a
depressing working-class Chicago neighborhood of row-
houses affected with such satanic goings-on that at least
three of its families would wish for Billy Sunday to shut the
city down.  The story revolves about the efforts of one
ordinary guy to liberate a tortured soul, allowing the spirit to
lose its ghastly pallor and skip off into the sunset a happy
apparition. The Greeks and Elizabethans believed before our
own time that a murder victim cannot rest in peace until
punishment is meted out to the killers, setting the universe
once again in balance.  Unbenownst to him, one ordinary
working-class guy must undergo that task in our own age.</P>
<P>   Such a task must have been the most remote purpose in
the mind of Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon), a thoroughly prosaic
blue-collar worker who is married to a caring wife, Maggie
(Kathryn Erbe) and who has an unusually precocious little
boy, Jake.  So ordinary is this man that he arouses the
rancor of his cosmopolitan sister-in-law, Lisa (Illeana
Douglas), who challenges him to broaden his horizons by
putting himself under hypnosis.  Despite his feeling that
hypnosis is mere superstition, Tom proves eminently
suggestible--so much so that he is put into a deep trance and
has apparently been given enough post-hypnotic suggestion
that he now sees what others do not.  The ghost of a young
woman appears intermittently before his startled eyes.  His
entire vista turns suddenly into a photographic negative
seemingly lit by an infrared beam that appears with the
buzzing sound of fluorescent lighting.  Washing up, he
suddenly spots a swirl of blood in his drinking glass.  A tooth
falls out, hits the sink and disappears. Coincidentally, his
young son Jake communicates regularly with this deathly pale
specter, accepting the altered reality in the matter-of-fact
ways that kids are wont to do.</P>
<P>   As the story progresses, becoming more vivid,
melodramatic, and swiftly-paced, the mundane Tom descends
into the maelstrom of the obsessed, determined to get literally
to the bottom of the mystery of this ghostly presence.  He
begins excavating his basement like the James Brolin
character in "The Amityville Horror."  As the movie takes on
the aspects of a macabre delight such as Edgar Allan Poe
would have imagined, the panic that Tom feels communicates
easily to his audience thanks to Kevin Bacon's astonishing
ability to alter his heretofore unassuming, working-class ways
into those of a bristling psychotic perfectly prepared to
destroy his home and otherwise stable family life in pursuit of
answers.  A crackerjack editing job, juxtaposing the psychic
world with the commonplace one keeps the audience on the
edge.  A solid performance by Illeana Douglas as the
hypnotist offended by the commonplace and Kathryn Erbe as
Tom's increasingly concerned and devoted wife makes "Stir
of Echoes" the first scary movie of the year.</P>
