Reviewed July 29, 1999. </P>
<P>Despite its "sharky" villains, "Deep Blue Sea" is more akin to the "Alien" 
series than to "Jaws," which signals that the film honestly is cliche-ridden 
and unoriginal, but it nonetheless is one of the more exciting additions to 
the genre, thanks to director Renny Harlin's talent for creating slam-bang 
action sequences. Flawed as much of the film may be, it is one of the few 
big-budget summer extravaganzas this year (unlike "The Haunting" and "Lake 
Placid") that actually delivers on its promise to put you on the edge of your 
seat, and is also rather unpredictable concerning who the survivors, and the 
lunch, will turn out to be by story's end.</P>
<P>Following the inevitable prologue in which two young couples on a small boat 
are attacked, the film wastes no time in introducing Dr. Susan McAlester 
(Saffron Burrows), a marine biologist, who convinces her corporate funder, 
Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson), to come back with her to her research 
lab on a former U.S. Navy sub base, to prove that she has found a potential 
cure for Alzheimer's disease, involving three 45-foot test sharks that move 
at an alarmingly swift pace and who are unusually smart. With most of the 
staff leaving for the weekend, Susan, Russell, and six additional workers, 
including co-creator Carter Blake (Thomas Jane); engineer Tom Scoggins 
(Michael Rapaport); chef Preacher (LL Cool J); and assistants Janice Higgins 
(Jacqueline McKenzie) and Jim Whitlock (Stellan Skarsgard), are left alone. 
When a violent storm arises and, through a series of circumstances, the base 
is severely damaged and partially flooded, the three sharks swim on-board to 
terrorize the inhabitants, all of which are underground with very little 
means of being able to reach the surface.</P>
<P>The plot of "Deep Blue Sea" certainly isn't going to win any award for 
inventiveness, as the same basic premise and set-up has been remade too many 
times to count, but luckily, Harlin revs the film up surprisingly quickly 
after all of the characters are introduced, and afterwards, is so relentless 
on its action scenes that you rarely get time to take a breather. And just 
when you think you can, there will be a startling jolt to put you right back 
on the edge. </P>
<P>Since there really isn't anything new to be done with this type of movie, and 
thus, they almost always end up being a bore (see 1998's "Deep Rising" and 
1999's "Virus"), "Deep Blue Sea" demonstrates that any film's success depends 
solely on its treatment and expertise, which Harlin has always been known 
for. In an attempt to compel and arouse the viewer, Harlin does not skimp in 
any way on energy, nor could he ever be accused of making a "boring" film 
(unless, of course, it's name happens to be "Cutthroat Island"). Once the 
storm hits, the first victim is dispatched in an elongated, grisly manner, 
and the ball gets rolling approximately thirty minutes in, the movie doesn't 
let up, with a big action setpiece arriving every few minutes. Most directors 
would simply present a "death" scene, juice it up with middling suspense, and 
then move on to the next scene, but with Harlin, he always seems to take the 
action, and intensity, one step further (as in 1993's "Cliffhanger" and 
1996's "The Long Kiss Goodnight") so as to amaze and entertain with his 
particular creativity. </P>
<P>One other compliment that must be made is that, more than any horror-style 
picture of its type in awhile, the proceedings are often unpredictable when 
dealing with who the victims will be. Usually you can tell, with the 
top-billed actors living, and the lesser-known supporting players being 
offed, but this tried-and-true formula is promptly crumpled up and thrown 
away as one of the "main" characters is unexpectedly torn to shreds midway 
through. Once this vital moment occurs, you realize no character is safe, 
similar to the now-infamous Drew Barrymore opener in 1996's "Scream."</P>
<P>Dodging the utter corniness of the derivative "The Haunting," "Deep Blue 
Sea," like all of its similar predecessors, still remains weak on the 
screenplay level. Written by Akiva Goldsman (who destroyed the "Batman" 
series with 1997's horrendous "Batman and Robin"), the film leaves something 
to be desired when reminiscing back on the dialogue and one-note characters. 
Despite being played straight most of the time, Goldsman foolishly feels the 
need to sprinkle one-liners here and there, every single one of which falls 
as flat as a pancake. The characters aren't much better (actually they're 
worse). In the course of the film, you are lucky to learn much of anything 
about the humans, as they are mostly there as pawns in a far bigger chess 
game and are given very little time to develop substantially satisfying 
individual personalities. The actors do what they can, however, and are 
mostly so believable that it would be rather easy to overlook the needlessly 
underwritten characters. Of them all, LL Cool J is given the most time to 
really shine (and is also the most likable), while Saffron Burrows and 
relative newcomer Thomas Jane act as the heroine and hero, respectively. Also 
of notice is Jacquelyn McKenzine, an obvious character actress (just watch 
her heartwrenching turn in 1997's Australian drama, "Angel Baby"), who is 
highly empathetic and given the most effective scene, not to mention a 
supreme example of raw terror (only surpassed this year by "The Blair Witch 
Project"). Unfortunately, it is the most seasoned pro, Samuel L. Jackson, 
that doesn't seem to be in his usual top form, but that probably has 
something to do with his poorly-written role. As for the sharks, the 
mechanical ones are more plausible than the CGI ones, but aren't as 
awe-inspiring on a visual level. Both types, however, achieve satisfactory 
villain status.</P>
<P>All in all, "Deep Blue Sea" is neither deep nor meaningful. It knows it is a 
popcorn movie, pure and simple, but unlike most of them that leave you 
feeling even more hungry than when you first sat down to watch the film, this 
movie, indeed, gives you the much-needed bang for your buck. Go in expecting 
a masterpiece of modern cinema, and you are surely setting yourself up for a 
disappointment. But go in expecting to be genuinely entertained, and you'll 
have yourself a rollicking time. Besides, what was the last high-profile 
summer action movie that even succeeded on this most elementary level? </P>
