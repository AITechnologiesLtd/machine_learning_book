<PRE>ZOOLANDER
---------</PRE>
<P>Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller, "Meet the Parents") has been the Male Model 
of the year for three year's running with his patented "Blue Steel" look.  
When the extreme sports, New Age Hansel (Owen Wilson, "Meet the Parents")
takes his title in year four, Zoolander decides that 'there's more to life
than
just being really, really good looking, and I plan on finding out what it
is.'  Meanwhile, an evil fashion conglomerate determined to keep their 
pocket-gouging profits intact needs an assassin to rub out the prime minister 
of Malaysia in order to keep its foreign child labor pool stitching away.
Hot designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell, "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back") is tasked</P>
<P>with luring Derek back into the fashion world and programming him to kill in
"Zoolander."</P>
<P>Cross the colorful pop silliness of spy spoof "Austin Powers" with the
dimwitted, albeit good-hearted, vanity of "Clueless'" central character
and birth is given to cowriter/director Ben Stiller's "Zoolander."  While
not as witty as the latter, Jane Austen-inspired film, "Zoolander" has
enough inspired goofiness to maintain a consistent giggle fit.</P>
<P>After establishing the dominance of Zoolander in the fashion world, Stiller
batters his creation's self esteem.  His loss of Male Model of the Year 
(in a year when Fabio wins the 'slashie' for model/actor) is followed by an
unflattering Time Magazine cover feature by Matilda (Stiller's wife Christine 
Taylor, "The Brady Bunch Movie").  Then, when his three male model
roommates attempt to cheer him up with a mini-road trip, they perish in
a 'freak gasoline fight accident.'  The now-lone inhabitant of a four-way
bunk bed decides to head for home (in matching bone snakeskin suit and
wardrobe bag) to work with his father (Jon Voight) and brothers in the coal 
mines of New Jersey, but he's rebuffed for his former, unmanly profession.</P>
<P>Mugatu, who's never used Zoolander in one of his campaigns before, appeals
to his vanity by asking him to be the spokesmodel for his new 'Derelicte' line
(inspired by the homeless).  Whisked away to a hidden inner-city day spa by 
the Russian S&M clad Katinka (Milla Jovovich, "The Fifth Element"),
Zoolander's
brainwashed.  Luckily, regretful Time reporter Matilda, attempting to make
amends, begins to smell a rat.</P>
<P>Writers Stiller, John Hamburg ("Meet the Parents") and Drake Sather
("The MTV Movie Awards") hang juvenile humor (Derek's roomies communicate
with a string of 'Earth to's) and spot on parodies (the personality profiles
of Zoolander and Hansel at the awards ceremony) on a recycled plot they
wisely realize doesn't matter.  Director Stiller weaves the written silliness
with visual jokes and highlights the whole affair with celebrity cameos
that come at the audience every few minutes.  Zoolander's brainwashing scene
utilizes retro pop-art and music video imagery to its best effect while his
'walk-off' with Hansel, a split-screen, gun-slinging parody set to Michael
Jackson's 'Beat It' is the film's comic highlight.  Inventive production
design by Robin Standefer ("The Caveman's Valentine") climaxes with Hansel's 
'all things exotic and New Age' mishmash of a loft space including a 
'dirt room' where Matilda's treated to a menage a trois.  Costume design
by David C. Robinson ("Pollock") is a mixture of the made-up outrageous
(Mugatu's garbage-inspired 'Derelicte' line) with the already outrageous.</P>
<P>Stiller combines a 'sucking-in-cheeks' zoned-out look with exaggerated
poses, while Wilson's more natural as the scooter-riding High Times cover
boy.  Amazingly, Taylor makes her straight-woman role work while Jovovich
gets laughs from her femme fatale makeup design.  Stiller's dad Jerry
gets some Catskill-style yuks as Zoolander's manager Maury Ballstein.
The only disappointment is the usually reliable Will Ferrell who only
gets laughs from his Klaus Nomi hairstyle.  Hair also gets laughs when
we're introduced to Zoolander's dad, Jon Voight, and brothers (Vince
Vaughn is one) who sport the same, dark brushcut as their model relative.
The style shows up again on David Duchovny, an informant hand model.</P>
