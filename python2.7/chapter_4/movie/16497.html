<P>SCREAM (8/10) was the film that vogued teen flicks back into theatres, so
let's take Matthew Lillard from that movie. I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER
(7.5/10) was the follow-up teen-scream-popcorn-fest that brought in even
more mighty mighty bucks, so let's take Freddie Prinze Jr. from that cast.
Let's toss in Usher and Clea Duvall from last year's horror regurgitee THE
FACULTY (6.5/10), Chris Owens and Clea (again!) from the Jennifer Love
Hewitt vehicle CAN'T HARDLY WAIT (7/10), Jodi Lyn O'Keefe from the latest
HALLOWEEN: H20 (7.5/10), and even a cute cameo from the co-winner of the
"Queen of Teen flicks" award, Sarah Michelle Gellar (the other being
Jennifer Love Hewitt), and you've got yourself the makings of a perfect teen
romantic comedy, right? Well, let's see...</P>
<P>PLOT:
High school stud and all-around cool guy, Zach, is unceremoniously dumped by
his sexual alter-ego girlfriend, Taylor, and fished into a bet by his
friends to surreptitiously attempt to turn the school dorkiest girl, into
the high school prom queen in six weeks. While he attempts to do just that,
he soon finds himself actually beginning to like this "nerdy" girl.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Cute movie that contains quite a few laughs off the top, an endearing couple
as its leads, but ultimately falls into the trap of utter predictability and
one too many serious moments for its own comedic good. Another small problem
with this film is the fact that the apparent "ugly duckling" girl in this
movie is actually quite cute, even before any sort of physical
transformation occurs. The touted prom queen on the other hand, could not be
any more one-dimensional, and bitchy, giving us very little reason to give a
crap about her. Don't get me wrong, I did actually enjoy most of this movie,
especially an amazingly funny and pointed "performance artist" presentation
near its inception, and the charming performances put forth by Freddie
Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook, who kept their characters interesting
through most of this film's quick runtime.</P>
<P>One of my favorite movies of all-time, is actually quite similar to this
one, in that a bunch of guys bet on who is going to bring the ugliest girl
to a party. It's called DOGFIGHT (8/10) with River Phoenix and Lily Taylor,
and it is more of a dramatic representation of the repercussions that may
occur, when such a blatant lack of moral scruples strikes a couple who
really like each other. This film does not even pretend to slice that deep,
but does replace that lack of depth, with a slick soundtrack! :) And despite
this movie being as predictable as 1-2-and ?, it does come through on its
promise to fluffily entertain its target teenage audience with a hollow good
time, some laughs, some semi-tender moments and a couple of appealing leads.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Co-stars Prinze Jr. and Cook also co-starred in 1997's THE HOUSE OF YES. She
was a print model for 5 years before becoming an actress. She stands 5'2".
The hilarious "performance artist" near the first quarter of the film is
Alexis Arquette, one of the many brothers from the acting Arquette clan.
Kieran Culkin is the real-life brother of that HOME ALONE (8/10) kid,
Macauley Culkin.
Actress Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a cameo appearance in this film as one
of the girls in the cafeteria during the infamous "Simon
pizza-slice-meets-pubic-hair scene".
Another interesting actress in this film plays the character of Mackenzie,
Freddie Prinze Jr's sister. This actress actually won an Oscar for Best
Supporting Actress at the tender age of 12, for her role in the movie THE
PIANO. Her name is Anna Paquin. She was born in Winnepeg, Manitoba, Canada.
David Letterman once bet her $10,000 to get a basketball into a net. She
did, but he took the money back after the show. The media caused a fuss
about the whole deal, so he gave it back. Anna ended up giving all of the
money away to charity.
Director Robert Iscove also directed the 1997 television version of
CINDERELLA starring Brandy and Whitney Houston.
>From the "Who Hasn't?" files of trivia, it turns out that aside from
co-starring with him on episodes of TV's "Nash Bridges", Jodi Lyn O'Keefe,
once briefly dated co-star Don Johnson.
The two main stars of 1998's THE MIGHTY also star in this movie. Kieran
Culkin as Racheal Leigh Cook's younger brother, and Elden Henson as her
close friend.</P>
