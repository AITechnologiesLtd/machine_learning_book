A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) The day SPAWN opened, I saw two very different reviews.
Roger Ebert gave it 3½ stars because it was a good-looking exposition of
the state of the art in special effects; a melding of costumes, acting,
models, and computer effects in a hellish landscape worthy of
Hieronymous Bosch. Steven Rosen of the Denver Post called it an
incoherent waste of time that suffers from an overdose of special
effects.  </P>
<P>I suppose they were both right, but Roger Ebert had much more fun. </P>
<P>If I had to guess, I would say that Ebert also liked WILLIAM
SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO & JULIET (1996), and that Rosen hated it. Like ROMEO
& JULIET, SPAWN is a movie where style and pacing are given center
stage. The style is comic book and the pacing is fast, fast, fast. </P>
<P>SPAWN is based on comic books by Todd McFarlane. The story opens with
hired killer Al Simmons being betrayed by his superiors. He ends up
badly burned before he dies and goes to Hell. Hell sends him back to
Earth with a new suit of "necroplasmic" armor and a mission. His mission
is to ensure that a certain chemical weapon will wipe out Earth's human
population. (The sudden influx of billions of souls will allow Hell's
army to wage war on Heaven's fortress, you see.) But Simmons has his own
noble motives for wanting to return to Earth: he wants to see his wife
again. That, and to murder the bastards who did this to him. </P>
<P>Because much of the motivation in Spawn comes from Hell's plan to attack
Heaven, the gates for religious interpretation are wide open. When a
character exclaims "Jesus!" or says that the place is going to "hell in
a handbasket," there is a certain resonance that is usually absent from
such words. Whether or not it is intentional, the extra emphasis is not
lost. </P>
<P>Perhaps because of the extra emphasis on these words, I wondered why the
demons did not rear back from their utterance. Vampires fear crosses and
holy water. Why do these demons from Hell not fear the muttered
"Christ!" The message seems to be that while Hell is going strong,
Heaven is weak, tottering on the brink of oblivion. If this movie has a
big box office, it'll be a telling sign of the adolescent worldview in
1997. </P>
<P>It is interesting how closely Spawn parallels the traditional "hero's
journey." The hero hears the call to adventure, refuses at first, then
finally sees that the journey is inevitable. Along the way he is helped
by a spiritual guide who will show him the way. Luke Skywalker had his
Obi-wan. Disney's Hercules had his Philoctetes, even King Arthur had his
Merlin. </P>
<P>What sets Spawn apart from other heroes is that his spiritual advisor,
Clown (John Leguizamo), is Evil's representative, not Good's. Clown is a
teacher, but Spawn doesn't get his lessons for free. He must distinguish
between the lesson and the propaganda. It is a simple twist on a
storytelling tradition that works very well for this movie. (One could
argue that this is a parallel for the influx of information we get in
this day and age. We have to learn to glean good information from those
messengers who have ulterior motives, be they government, media
monopolies, or Internet wackos.) </P>
<P>When he's on the screen, Clown steals the show. Leguizamo, who is almost
unrecognizable as the stunted pear-shaped demon, looks like he had a
great time with the part. He is rude and crass, which is only
appropriate for a guardian demon. He teaches and guides the hero, but
unlike a guardian ANGEL, he gets to mock the hero's shortcomings. Clown
has a lot of good lines, and many of them draw attention to the fact
that this hero's teacher is hell-sent, not heaven-sent. </P>
<P>But what really makes SPAWN stand out is its look. SPAWN looks like a
heavy metal fantasy. It is a black and orange Halloween explosion. It
looks like the latest series of Batman movies, only set in the most
horrible Hell Christianity can come up with. It looks like the Hell of
BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY ("our album covers lied to us, dude") without
the levity. </P>
<P>Rosen said the movie was incoherent, but the style was very coherent.
There isn't one special effect that stands out above the rest (i.e., is
out of place). The look and tone of the movie is consistent from scene
to scene, presenting the audience with a single, integrated visual
"message." Even the opening and closing credits are designed with the
same edgy feel and look. (Maybe credit design should be the next
category for the Academy Awards©™®.) </P>
<P>For the record, the production designer (the person in charge of the
overall look of a film) was Philip Harrison, a veteran from THE RELIC,
TIMECOP, and other films going back as far as OUTLAND (1981). The rookie
director is a former special effects wizard. The cinematographer,
Guillermo Navarro, has worked with Quentin Tarantino and Robert
Rodriguez. </P>
<P>Add up all that experience and you can please a lot of 13-year old boys.
But SPAWN can have a broader appeal, if you let it. Expectations are
everything, so do see this movie, but make sure you know what you're
getting into.</P>
