<P>In a film as with all else, novelty for novelty's sake isn't much. 
But then again, novelty of any kind may open doors for other creators 
and works. David O. Russell's first feature, the low-budget Spanking 
the Monkey, was daringly original. It and made the writer-director 
more than just promising. His next film was Flirting With Disaster, 
neither daring nor a minor landmark, but clever (though without 
brilliance or depth), inventive (but not really original), and 
amusing.</P>
<P>The title Three Kings is ironic. It calls to mind We Three Kings from 
Orient Are.  But these kings don't bear gifts. They are taking gold 
away. In any case they are four, not three. A redneck yahoo from 
Texas is excluded from the title --which goes to show how logic is 
sacrificed at the altar of catchy titles.</P>
<P>Desert Storm is ending. Is the Gulf War really over? Is there a 
truce? What's up, Doc? It's all muddled, but the U.S. soldiers are 
celebrating anyway their return-home-to be. They live it up like 
fraternity boys, with booze and clowning and rap music. It's a 
near-orgy, minus sex. But wait a moment. Special Forces Captain Gates 
(George Clooney, in fine mettle) is in a tent, vigorously copulating 
with the female assistant to Adriana. Adriana is an ace reporter for 
a TV network (invented).</P>
<P>The lively though not lovely start also includes encounters with 
"ragheads," captives treated like dirt, Iranians in uniform and 
others. Sometimes the soldiers shoot first, then wonder if the 
natives were friendly (anti-Saddam), foes or simply guys surrendering 
Ugh.</P>
<P>All this sets the tone. Mostly, it introduces the plot. An anal 
(don't ask) document on (in) a captive officer turns out to be the 
map of gold bars looted by Iraq from Kuwait. That's the stuff dreams 
(cf. The Maltese Falcon and Treasure if Sierra Madre) are made of. 
Neat, ain't it?</P>
<P>The next, inevitable step is for Captain Gates to lead a quartet of 
men (the old movie mix of motley guys) to the "liberation" of the 
golden stash. It could buy endless visits to Disney, Inc. at home.</P>
<P>Then comes non-stop action, compounded by a baffling mix of elite 
troops still faithful to Saddam --or still afraid of him,  deserters, 
an anti-Saddam Resistance (which was news to me), innocent women and 
children caught in cross-fire, underground treasure troves. Not only 
gold bars but Kuwaiti jewelry, absurd refrigerators, radios and tutti 
quanti). Plus occasional people from whatever is the "other" side 
being interrogated under torture. And later, another stash, this time 
of luxurious, shiny Kuwaiti limousines and sports cars. Enough, 
enough.</P>
<P>In addition, the Americans are being stalked by news-supergal Adriana 
(and her cameraman). She's been Emmy-nominated multiple times, but 
has always been a bridesmaid,  never a bride. This is her big chance: 
The Scoop.</P>
<P>Shot with a real (or a pretend) 16 millimiter hand-held movie camera 
(unless it is supposed to be video), the sights have that typical 
graininess, jerkiness and relative un-sharpness of news footage. A 
clever idea which adds immediacy to the action. But analyze it and 
you'll have to conclude that it's still the old Eye of God, except 
that it is not mounted on a studio tripod. (There are also shots of 
sea-birds soaked in oil as a result of blown-up oil wells by the 
Iraqis. Looks to me like footage from the Werner Herzog apocalyptic 
documentary).</P>
<P>In addition (again) the four soldiers must be AWOL, given the time 
frame. In re-addition, we get the old cliche characterizations of the 
group's individuals.</P>
<P> From the point of view of the narrative, the well-intentioned desire 
to show the madness and chaos of war and its aftermath results in 
much murkiness and confusion. The audiences of this movie will no 
doubt be heavy with young persons who were pre-teens or early teens 
during the Gulf War --and know next to nothing about it. I suppose 
that like most viewers of action flicks they don't ask themselves 
questions but bask in the physical scenes before their eyes. But 
those non-kids who do exercise their logic and whatever they know of 
history, are bound (as I did) to spend much time trying to figure out 
who's who,what and where.</P>
<P>Violence is most graphic, gory and too often gratuitous here. It is 
effective in its use of firearms, mines, poison gas, vehicles and all 
--but it lacks Sam Peckinpah's ballet-ism or even the montage of 
Bonnie and Clyde's slow-motion rain of bullets. Everything seems to 
be larger and faster than life. and faster. Sort it out if you can: 
most of the males, on all sides, are primitive or ferocious. So much 
for humanism.</P>
<P>The narrow subject is greed, which is OK. But, like a savage kind of 
M*A*S*H, there's a pretty continuous thread of comedy running 
through, with mixed results. And, shades of umpteen movies about 
fortune-hunting, the conclusion lapses into deja vu sentimentality. 
The three American survivors will give up their gold in exchange of 
authorities allowing a procession of "good" (read anti-Saddam) Iraqis 
to enter a sanctuary at the Iranian border.</P>
<P>Makes you feel good, as it had in other, different films, doesn't it?</P>
<P>The high-budget transformation of locations in the American Southwest 
and in Mexico into the Arabian desert is remarkable. The performers 
are good, including those who play Iraqis. So is the varied music 
score by Carter Burwell.</P>
