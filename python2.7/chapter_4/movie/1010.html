<PRE>                                    EATING
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     EATING is a film by Henry Jaglom and features 38 women including
Frances Bergen, mother of Candace, widow of Edgar, and survivor of the
Edgar McCarthy wars, as the voice of sanity and nonunderstanding.</P>
<P>     Henry Jaglom is one of the world's great film makers and EATING is
the best film he's ever made.  Okay, so sue me, but that's my opinion
and I'll stick to it.  If for no other reason than that Jaglom is the
only man, woman, or child making movies today who has made a movie about
me.  I am obese, have been all my life, and, while I'm not a woman, I
can relate.  Boy! can I relate.  I mention this because I may be a
shade prejudiced as I attempt to review this film for you.  Forewarned
and all that.</P>
<P>     Bergen (I think) says: "Twenty-five years the secret subject of
women was sex, now it's food."</P>
<P>     Another women says: "I have yet to meet a man who excites as much
as a baked potato."</P>
<PRE>     And a third says: "I'm ok if I don't eat before, say, 11 PM."</PRE>
<P>     The mise-en-scene is a birthday party for three women turning 30,
40, and 50 respectively.  The house fills up with the women and their
guests -- no men, although God knows men are there spiritually,
psychologically, every way but physically.  One of the guests is a
charming French film maker who is doing a video on women and food.  She
starts taping and interviewing the party people.  Much of the movie is
these people telling the video camera about their secret lives vis-a-vis
food and eating, eating and sex, eating and abortions, eating and men,
eating and women, eating and mom or dad, eating and bingeing and bulemia
and anorexia and diets and guilt.  Eating becomes a metaphor, an entre
into the neuroses, relationships, and guilty pleasures of millions upon
millions of people in Western society.  </P>
<P>     What they say is so startlingly naked, true, earnest, and honest,
it delights your soul and breaks your heart simultaneously.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, the principal characters are playing out various crises
in their tangled lives as the party and the interviews surge ahead
uncontrollably.  Marriages and friendships founder, people wake up to
themselves, things fall apart, and things come together, all in the
context of the party.</P>
<P>     This is heady stuff and the truly amazing thing is that it works as
a film.  Critics and viewers are inevitably want to compare EATING to
SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE.  EATING is better because it is at once more
concentrated and more diffuse, without the distraction of James Spader.
Jaglom makes us laugh and cry, shake our heads with disbelief and shake
our heads with recognition.  Even the resident, self-described bitch,
bulemic, back-stabbing, treacherous, miserable bitch, is in the end,
crouched on the bathroom floor, sympathetic if not likable.</P>
<P>     These people are victims of the idea that we can be perfect, that
perfection is not only attainable, but desirable.  Some of them are
perfect asses, but it is their imperfections that we love in them, that
Jaglom's camera makes us love.</P>
<P>     Jaglom's film have always been low-budget, ex-tempore affairs that
breathe with more genuine life than all the big budget blowouts that
Hollywood can churn out in a season.  EATING is particularly alive and
accessible.  That one about his divorce -- sorry, don't have the name
here -- in the end made me furious; maybe I just younger, but I think
the quest for perfection there made people stupid and unlovable, made
them spoiled rich kids.  These people are almost all from the sunny side
of the street, but my class-warfare bells don't go off this time.</P>
<P>     EATING is being distributed mostly to art houses, but I urge you to
see it if you possibly can.  I guarantee you it will be one of the films
on my ten-best list.</P>
