<P>It's just "your basic boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy changes 
underlying social structure" tale, according to Z (Woody Allen), the 
rebellious hero of "Antz," a sophisticated, fun and fast paced computer-
generated feature about life from the insects' point of view. Rush-
released by DreamWorks to reach audiences ahead of Disney's similarly 
themed CGI feature "A Bug's Life," "Antz" clearly learned a valuable 
lesson from the delightful 1995 Disney smash "Toy Story"; that dazzling 
computer graphics are just eye candy unless supported by good acting and 
a solid script.  </P>
<P>"Antz" follows the adventures of Z-4195, a neurotic worker ant who longs 
to assert his individuality. At the conclusion of a counseling session he 
moans "I feel so insignificant" only to have his therapist (Paul 
Mazursky) congratulate him, exclaiming, "you've had a breakthrough. You 
ARE insignificant!" </P>
<P>Everything changes one fateful night, when spunky Princess Bala (Sharon 
Stone) violates the colony's caste system and goes slumming at a worker 
bar, where she ends up dancing in the arms of an enraptured Z. Determined 
to see her again, Z convinces his best friend, soldier ant Weaver 
(Sylvester Stallone), to change places with him for one day, so that he 
can march past the royalty in a military parade. Unbeknownst to Z, the 
parade troops are slated to lead an assault against an army of termites. </P>
<P>In short order, Z becomes a hero to the colony, until his lowly status is 
revealed and he ends up fleeing to the outside world, with a furious Bala 
by his side and her fiancée, the treacherous General Mandible (Gene 
Hackman) ordering him caught and killed. As Z desperately tries to avoid 
death, the General inches closer to fulfilling his secret agenda; a 
military coup d'état that will destroy most of the colony.</P>
<P>The computer graphics in "Antz" are imaginative and remarkably detailed. 
While the oddly angular design of the insects' bodies is less than 
attractive, the body movements are credible and the facial expressions 
extremely convincing. The background designs are well-done, particularly 
in outdoor scenes set in Insectopia, the legendary bug paradise. 
Incidentally, watch those scenes for what is quite possibly the most 
blatant product placement of all time.</P>
<P>Wisely, the dialogue in "Antz" is aimed at least as much towards grown-
ups as it is for children. For example, Z suggests that, as an 
alternative to war with the termites, the colony might try "influencing 
their political process with campaign contributions." His struggle for 
individuality in a world of absolute conformity leads to some 
entertaining, if unrealized, socio-political subplots.</P>
<P>The film's cast is impressive, to say the least. Dan Ackroyd and Jane 
Curtain provide laughs as Chip and Muffy, a condescending but well-
intentioned pair of wasps (in both senses of the word). Christopher 
Walken is suitably menacing as Colonel Cutter, and Gene Hackman gives a 
commanding performance as the evil General Mandible. As Z's best friend 
Weaver, Sylvester Stallone is an endearing lug and Sharon Stone does 
solid work as the privileged, but spirited Princess Bala.  </P>
<P>Of course, this is Woody Allen's show, and he immediately trots out the 
patented neurotic shtick on which he built a career. Despite working with 
sharp one-liners, his initial delivery struck me as just more of the same 
old Allen whining. Viewers less familiar with his work may find his 
entire performance fresh, but I felt he was a bit tiresome in the movie's 
early scenes. Luckily, he brightens his voice work as the film progresses,
 becoming much more likable midway through the story.</P>
<P>Writers toss around phrases like "fun for the whole family" far too 
casually, but "Antz" really is a film that should appeal to all ages. 
There are a few battle scenes that may prove too intense for very young 
or sensitive children, so cover their eyes if need be, and prepare to 
actually have fun at a movie with your kids, courtesy of "Antz." And if 
you're a grown-up without children, head for the theater tout-de-suite.</P>
