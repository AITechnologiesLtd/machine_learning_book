<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Though it may seem hard to believe, movies have now been around for more 
than a century. One of the interesting phenomena accompanying this 
venerability is that the dawn of film history has begun to pass into 
modern mythology; names like Valentino and Griffiths seem as ancient and 
as far removed from the present day as Abraham Lincoln and Queen Victoria. 
As a result, cinema's early years have become fair game for speculative 
fiction: stories that wonder "what if" things had been just a little 
different.</P>
<P>"Shadow Of The Vampire" is just such a movie, depicting the making of the 
1922 German classic "Nosferatu", one of the earliest and most renowned 
horror pictures. Although "Nosferatu" does not quite date from the start 
of the film era, its mystique was amplified when the estate of Bram Stoker 
successfully sued its makers, claiming (quite rightly) that "Nosferatu" 
was a thinly-veiled reworking of Stoker's seminal novel "Dracula". An
effort was then made to purge all extant prints of "Nosferatu", and while 
some copies have (fortunately) survived, it has helped give the movie a 
legend all its own.</P>
<P>Even without it, "Nosferatu" would still be an ideal subject for this kind 
of film. It is, after all, a vampire movie made in the very Eastern 
European locales where vampire myths first arose. It features a rivetting, 
convincing performance by Max Schreck as the bloodsucking Count Orlok (or 
Orlock, a spelling disparity given sly reference -- one I can only assume 
was intentional -- by the makers of "Shadow"). And so effective was the 
make-up transforming Schreck into the baleful Orlok that it stands up even 
by today's standards.</P>
<P>In "Shadow", then, writer Steven Katz asks the obvious question: what if 
Max Schreck really was a vampire -- or, more specifically, "a vampire 
playing an actor playing a vampire"?</P>
<P>To explore the notion, Katz focusses on director FW Murnau (played by John 
Malkovich), who is painted here as a zealous, almost fanatical artist. 
Katz's point is clear: the medium of film can be every bit as 
life-draining as a vampire, and the director's fangs are far more deadly 
than those of any creature of the night. Murnau stalks about his sets and 
locations, often clad in dark glasses, looking every bit as fearsome as 
his star. For Murnau, there is nothing more important than the realisation 
of his vision. He will take any measures necessary to ensure that 
"Nosferatu" is completed, even making a deal with the devil; and, for all 
intents and purposes, he has.</P>
<P>In the fictional reality of "Shadow Of The Vampire", Murnau has sought out 
a genuine vampire (Willem Dafoe) living in the wilds of Hungary. Murnau 
christens him "Max Schreck" and pretends he is an old acting acquaintance. 
He explains Schreck's idiosyncrasies and bizarre appearance by claiming 
that Schreck is a consummate performer who totally immerses himself in his 
role, to the extent of not even removing his "costume". Schreck, 
meanwhile, has his own motivations, and soon begins to prey upon the cast 
and crew of "Nosferatu", putting not just the production at risk, but also 
the lives of all those involved.</P>
<P>Malkovich is terrific as the obsessed Murnau, but it is Dafoe who steals 
the show. His realisation of the vampire is unforgettable, neatly 
capturing the essence of the real Schreck's performance and extending it 
naturally to flesh out a full character. Dafoe completely eschews the 
suave modern vampires of Anne Rice and Joss Whedon; his Schreck is barely 
removed from vermin, constantly clicking his enormous claws and thinking 
of little more than his hunger. It would be an oversight not to also 
mention the work of make-up designer Pauline Fowler and her team. They 
have done a phenomenal job recreating the original "Nosferatu" design and,
moreover, making Schreck seem like a real, (un)living creature.</P>
<P>Under the guidance of director E Elias Merhige, "Shadow" successfully 
transports us back to the 1920s. This is particularly evident in Merhige's 
use of clips from "Nosferatu" itself. Rather than contrasting with 
Merhige's own footage, this material fits into "Shadow" seamlessly. And 
while "Shadow" is ultimately a dark comedy, Merhige does not let this 
interfere with the fearful, oppressive atmosphere he crafts: the two 
aspects of the picture work together to impact the viewer instead of 
diminishing each other.</P>
<P>Consider, for example, a terrific sequence in which Schreck joins other 
crewmembers who are drinking around a fire. The crew, still believing that 
Schreck is merely an actor who has immersed himself in his vampire 
"character", asks his opinion of "Dracula". Schreck responds that he views 
the novel as a tragedy, and cites the seemingly innocuous scene where 
Dracula prepares his dining room for Harker's arrival. Schreck views this 
with sadness because he sees it as a reminder of all that Dracula (and, by 
extension, himself) has forgotten in the centuries since he lost his 
humanity. And then, if this weren't bizarre enough, he grabs a bat out of 
the air and feasts upon it. Should we laugh? Should we be frightened? 
Merhige successfully inspires both emotions, no mean feat to be sure.</P>
<P>It is unfortunate, then, that "Shadow" gradually loses its way as the 
movie progresses. Like a particularly grotesque "Saturday Night Live" 
sketch, Katz and Merhige seem to run out of ideas of where to take their 
premise next. As a result, the film's final reel feels distinctly 
fragmented, with ideas and new characters (such as Cary Elwes' 
cinematographer, introduced when Schreck feeds on his predecessor) coming 
seemingly at random.</P>
<P>The ending is particularly disappointing, its unrelenting savagery 
delivering a poor climax to an original and intelligent concept. It also 
represents a major deviation from established movie history. The best 
speculative fiction leaves us with the lingering suspicion that maybe, 
just maybe, such events really could have taken place. "Shadow Of The 
Vampire" just makes us glad that they didn't.</P>
