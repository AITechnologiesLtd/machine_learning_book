<PRE>Title: A Bug's Life (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>Review by Arnold Kim</PRE>
<P>It seems that these days a lot of films are dependent on visuals and
filmmaking technology to "ooh" and "aah" the audience enough to occupy
them for two hours.  Story is often a mere second to visual effects in
movies like "Godzilla" or "Armageddon".  What a refreshment it is,
then, to see a film like "A Bug's Life" where visuals are used to aid
and add to the story rather than take its place.  That is one of the
reasons why I found "A Bug's Life" to be one of the more enjoyable
films I've seen this year.</P>
<P>The story of "A Bug's Life" is probably one of its greatest
assets. The tale of a worker ant named Flik (Dave Foley) and his
attempt to save his colony from the bullyish grasshoppers led by
Hopper (Kevin Spacey) by recruiting insects who turn out to be circus
rejects is absolutely charming and unique.  I've never seen this
"Seven Samurai-ish" told the way "A Bug's Life" tells it, partly
because it couldn't have been done before.  Much of the plot,
especially in the second half, came as a pleasant surprise.  Just when
you think it might be over, a new twist is added to keep you in your
seats.</P>
<P>The story also allows for some excellent characters and character
development as well.  Flik, one of my favorites in the film, grows
from a naive, optimistic ant to an ant who stands up for what he
believes in and can be taken seriously by the end.  The members of the
circus group is probably one of the most eclectic and lovable bunch of
riffraff I've seen in film in a while.  They range from Slim (David
Hyde Pierce), the sticklike thespian wannabe to Francis (Denis Leary),
the unladylike male ladybug with an attitude.  All the different and
unique personalities of the circus crew add quite a bit of color to
the cast.  Their development as a whole, finally finding a place and
an audience that accepts them, should be noted as well.  The littlest
ant, Dot, is absolutely adorable and grows from being a runt with low
self esteem to a confident leader of sorts and princess.  And of
course, the entire colony of ants go from being the bullied to the
ones who take charge and revolt towards the end.  (Oh, and for this
film you really want to stay till the very end, as you'll catch some
amusing "outtakes" from the film.)</P>
<P>Largely responsible for the characters is the wonderful voice cast
behind them.  Dave Foley is perfectly optimistic and full of hope and
charm as Flik, while Kevin Spacey is quite menacing as the villainous
Hopper.  Julia Louis-Dreyfus seems to somewhat reprise her "Elaine"
role on "Seinfeld" fairly effectively as Princess Atta, Flik's love
interest of sorts and next in line to head the colony.  Denis Leary is
perfectly cast as the sarcasm and attitude-laden Francis.  Overall, a
solid performance by the voice cast.</P>
<P>In addition, a solid performance by the animators is put into this
story as well.  An extremely engaging film visually, it seems to use
the most vibrant color palettes that are possible, with bright greens,
deep blues, and solid reds, and everything in between.  Also
remarkable is the incredible detail in the animation, not glossing
over any single nook or cranny.  It is both of these aspects of the
animation that come together to form the film's top artistic
achievement- a beautiful orange-red bird, the fearsome predator that
all the insects fear, even the grasshoppers.  The stunningly lifelike
nature of that figure had me doing double takes.</P>
<P>Of course, this film has drawn a bit of attention as a result of the
similarities between it and another computer animated insect film, the
recently released "Antz".  However, it is at that point that the
similarities between the films stop.  While Antz is an adult oriented
anti-socialist Woody Allen story about the importance of the
individual, "A Bug's Life" is a fable for all ages about believing in
yourself.  Between the two of them, "A Bug's Life" is the superior
film, with a better and more cohesive story that isn't quite so dark.
The characters are more colorful likable in "Bugs", especially in the
two leads.  However, the voice actors may have fared a bit better in
"Antz", as I found Woody Allen, Sly Stallone, and co.  perfectly
suited to their roles.  However, "Antz" also loses out in the visual
department, choosing to be drably realistic with the excessive use of
browns over the use of more varied and lively colors.  "Antz" also
seems to be a bit confused in its audience, as it tries to be an
"adult" film while also using humor that would appeal to the younger
audiences.  "A Bug's Life" clearly lacks that problem.</P>
<P>Three years ago, the same team, Pixar and Disney, brought to theaters
the first completely computer animated movie, "Toy Story", and that
film set the standard for films of its genre with its wonderful
characters and story.  In 1998, Pixar and Disney keep up to those
standards with the release of "A Bug's Life", one of the more
endearing films of the year.  My score, out of 10: 8</P>
