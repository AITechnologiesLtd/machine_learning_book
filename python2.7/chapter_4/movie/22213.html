<P>   Aside from self-defense, do you think you could kill another
human being?  Not your style?  Perhaps.  But some people
disagree with you.  One of the dissenters is Patricia
Highsmith, whose 1955 novel "The Talented Mr. Ripley" has
been made by Anthony Minghella ("The English Patient") into
what is easily the best crime thriller of the year.  Minghella
proves that he is as adept at fashioning edge-of-your seat,
Hitchcockian dramas of transgression as he is at building a
sweeping love story.  "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is the second
screen adaptation of the Highsmith novel, the first being
Rene Clement's "Purple Noon" which starred Alain Delon as
the title character who envies his playboy friend and decides
to kill the young man and assume his identity.  Both were
lavishly filmed in some of Italy's more scenic and
characteristic spots.  Minghella wisely avoids the temptation
to do the appealing psychological study in the noir style,
allowing cinematographer John Seale to capture the brightly-
colored vistas of Ischia, Palermo, Rome, Anzio and Venice,
thus affording the Italian Tourist Board with spectacular, free
promotion.</P>
<P>   The Paramount Pictures/Miramax Films co-production also
features some of the handsomest performers in the business,
including the Jude Law, who bears not a slight resemblance
to a Greek god; a role that nicely explores the resources of
the talented Matt Damon; and a strikingly appealing Gwyneth
Paltrow who looks lovelier here than she has ever appeared
before.  Cate Blanchett, who turns in a satisfactory
performance as a ditzy rich gal comes across as just plain
silly in a role that does not capitalize on her own meticulous
capabilities.</P>
<P>   "The Talented Mr. Ripley" was the first in writer Patricia
Highsmith's series about an struggling American who
becomes entirely captivated by the good life in Europe and
simply could not see himself returning to the states as a hotel
bathroom attendant and sometimes pianist at social
gatherings.  And who could blame him?  How are you going
to keep this Yank down in New York after he's tasted la dolce
vita?  </P>
<P>   Convincing shipping magnate Herbert Greenleaf, the father
(James Rebhorn) of a wastrel, Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law)
that he had attended the same class as Dickie at Princeton
University, Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is given a thousand
dollars by the older Greenleaf to go to Italy and convince the
young man to return home.  Tom discovers Dickie soaking up
the sun with his girl friend, Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth
Paltrow), persuades the rich young man as well that they
were classmates at Princeton, and, pretending that he shares
a passion for jazz and a talent for impersonation, is taken in
by Dickie as a guest.  While Tom hangs out with Dickie,
eating his food and allowing his host to buy him some
custom-made threads, shares with him the rich life--attending
jazz clubs and gawking at the beauty of a land which, on his
own, he would never have been able to see.  We can easily
see how the alluring Dickie draws people toward him like a
magnet, as he jumps on the stage to share a song in Italian,
plays his saxophone, and plans a ski trip with his snobbish
American friend, Freddie (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  </P>
<P>   His ability to fit in with the good life gives Tom Ripley a
vision: he could have it all if he could erase Dickie from the
scene, assume his identity, and spend time forging checks
and passing himself off as the influential son of a magnate. 
Each time a situation arises that could give him away, we in
the audience hold our breath to see how in the heck this
audacious liar and murderer can avoid getting caught.  Tom's
skill at winging it makes him actually likable to us
notwithstanding his dastardly deed, and given the natural
resentment, perhaps envy, we may have for the guy he kills
(who is a womanizer as well as a wastrel), we may actually
root for him to fool everybody--Dickie's girl friend, the
American woman, Meredith Logue (Cate Blanchett) who
seems to turn up everywhere, Dickie's American friend,
Freddie Miles, and yet another man Tom befriends, Peter
Smith-Kingsley (Jack Davenport).</P>
<P>   Minghella adds a gay theme absent from the Highsmith
novel, a motif which contributes to the tension and which
gives us the feeling that perhaps Tom was motivated to kill
Dickie not only to take over his wealth but because Dickie
spurned a homosexual advance.  The Patricia Highsmith style
can be spotted by anyone lucky enough to see the first-class
Hitchcock picture, the 1951 "Strangers on a Train," featuring
a psychopathic Robert Walker's relationship with a tennis star
played by Farley Granger.</P>
<P>   To see why a typically banal Hollywood ending was
avoided we need only check into the writings of novelist
Highsmith who once said, "Neither life nor nature cares if
justice is ever done or not."  While director Minghella does
make one concession to the modern American audience by
providing an emotional reason for the murder, Highsmith was
herself without interest in psychological explanations for
anything.  Book reviewer Susannah Clapp has said, "Rather
than engaging the reader with the solution to a crime or the
thrill of a chase, Highsmith invites us to observe life as a
cunningly devised trap from which there is, as events
accumulate, no escape."  Minghella remains true to the
source by registering all actions in the movie, whether violent
or not, in a matter-of-fact way, allowing us in the audience to
treat events as witnesses to a clever game of a man focusing
his energies on avoiding a series of traps.  The talented Mr.
Minghella will have every congregation of movie viewers
sitting in continuous apprehension.</P>
