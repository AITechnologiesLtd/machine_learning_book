<PRE>                              MEDITERRANEO
                       A film review by Sri Rajeev
                        Copyright 1992 Sri Rajeev</PRE>
<P>     MEDITERRANEO is one of those small, surprising and delightful films
- such as the French used to make at one time - that leave a smile on
your face without taxing you overly.  I hate to denigrate it by calling
it a perfect summer movie, but that really is what it is: good, clean
entertainment.  By the way, it did win an Academy Award for Best Foreign
Film, I think in 1991.</P>
<P>     The film is in Italian, set on a small Greek island in the
Mediterranean.  The island is of dubious strategic value, and to the
small troupe of Second World War Italian soldiers (self-described by
the schoolmaster Lieutenant as a bunch of misfits) sent to capture and
hold the island, it appears to be an exercise in futility.  The island
seems completely devoid of human habitation, and since they are pretty
much incommunicado (their transport ship having been shot up and
destroyed by the enemy, and their radio broken by one of the soldiers in
a fit of pique), they seem to have a time of total boredom ahead of
them.  But all of a sudden (and the viewer becomes a willing believer
in this convenient fiction), the inhabitants of the village reappear.
It turns out they had hidden themselves in the caves because their
previous experience with occupying soldiers (German as it happens) had
been none too nice - the Germans had taken away all the able-bodied men.</P>
<P>     Then follows a very pleasant time for the soldiers: they are
accepted by the Greeks as comrades (for some reason they all keep
saying, "One race, one face" - although eventually someone does counter
with "One race, one stomach" after a particularly large meal.)  They
lead a blissful, Lotos-Eater existence for several years.  The
Lieutenant, an amateur artist, is commissioned to repaint the murals in
the church; various of the men find agreeable female companionship.</P>
<P>     Eventually, of course, all this good stuff must come to an end, and
reality strikes in the personages of two rather pompous British naval
ensigns who appear to take the Italians home in the aftermath of the
war.  They are suitably nonplussed by the scruffy Italian soldiers who
have gone native, complete with baggy trousers and vests.</P>
<P>     All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable film; even the (obligatory?)
Turkish villain and the starchy Brits were treated with good humor.  The
blue-green Mediterranean and the dazzlingly whitewashed Greek village
make one long to take a trip!</P>
<P>(Probably rated R for nudity, adult situations)</P>
