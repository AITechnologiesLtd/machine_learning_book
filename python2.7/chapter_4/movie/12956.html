<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   The rhythmic, Buffalo Springfield-flavoured Public Enemy title track
   pervasive throughout Spike Lee's new film HE GOT GAME is quite a
   contrast to the explosively raw, ferocious "Fight The Power" which
   brilliantly opened the landmark DO THE RIGHT THING, but this is a
   markedly different sort of film.  It's not the equal of his 1989
   masterpiece -- few films are -- but HE GOT GAME is a splendidly
   entertaining piece of work, and probably the most accessible film in
   Mr. Lee's canon.  While it's primarily an intimate domestic drama
   focusing upon the tenuous relationship between estranged father and
   son, it's also a lamenting film which decries the corrupt world of
   amateur athletics.</P>
<P>   Exploitation of burgeoning athletic prospects isn't exactly a new
   theme, having been repeatedly addressed in numerous films of recent
   years, but what makes it so effective here is Mr. Lee's superb
   ability at creating a sense of community for his characters, which
   lends authenticity to the proceedings and makes the scenario all the
   more tragic -- while it's morbidly amusing to watch, what's
   disturbing about the scene where Uncle Bubba (Bill Nunn) greedily
   sinks his claws into top-rated high school basketball prospect Jesus
   Shuttlesworth (Ray Allen) is not the sheer unbridled parasitism of
   his gesture as much as it is the weary expression on Jesus' face,
   which immediately conveys the knowledge that such displays of greed
   are all too commonplace sights for him.</P>
<P>   Indeed, the film is as much about the loss of innocence as it is
   about the basketball experience.  We open with reverential scenes of
   the youth of America immersed in the joy of game, effectively backed
   by the evocative music of Aaron Copland -- hey, I'm not even a big
   fan of basketball, and yet I found it hypnotic and stirring -- and
   then watch as young Jesus progresses from an exuberant child who can
   triumphantly exclaim "Boo-yeah!" when beating his cousin on a video
   game to a jaded adolescent, pushed too hard by his father during his
   formative years and forced to support his family at a tender young
   age while required to keep a wary eye open for those who would
   befriend him for their own gain.  Pulled upon from all sides, Jesus
   is, through no fault of his own, dehumanized by those around him --
   he's a commodity, not a person.  (There's a sobering key scene late
   in the film where a character matter-of-factly explains to Jesus why
   he's being exploited -- it would almost make you despise the
   character, if it were not for the fact that in its own twisted way,
   it does make its odd sort of sense.)  To Jesus' dismay, even his
   young sister Mary (a splendid Zelda Harris) becomes temporarily
   corrupted by the greedy urchins hovering around him, seduced by
   dreams of wealth and prosperity.  Still, as a good filmmaker is wont
   to do, Mr. Lee conveys his message without preaching at the audience,
   expressed in an inventive and engaging manner.</P>
<P>   In fact, HE GOT GAME is hugely palatable for mainstream audiences
   principally due to the tempestuous relationship between father and
   son which serves as the heart of the film.  Jake Shuttlesworth
   (Denzel Washington), serving time for a crime which is only revealed
   at the mid-point of the film, is temporarily (and unofficially)
   released from jail to be sent on an unique mission; he's to try to
   persuade his son Jesus to sign on with Big State, the governor's alma
   mater, by weeks' end.  In return, Jake's promised the chance of early
   parole.  The only problem is that his relationship with his estranged
   son is in tatters, and Jesus, despite sorely lacking in guidance,
   nonetheless wants nothing to do with him.  Angrily shunned by his
   son, the scene where their paths first cross is shot in such a stark,
   unsensationalized manner that it's consequently fraught with genuine
   tension.  This doesn't play like melodrama; it has a verisimilitude
   of authenticity.</P>
<P>   There's been a good deal of press about certain preview screenings of
   the film which found audiences screaming aloud in disapproval of
   Jake's interracial love affair.  While I'm surprised that this
   innocuous little romantic angle has created so much controversy (Mr.
   Lee plays the race card much more provocatively in a conversation
   shared by two characters where they compare black and white women), I
   was also aghast when I saw this thread play out.  However, my
   consternation was with the superfluousness of this entire generic
   subplot, which is so potentless that it calls upon such familiar
   clichis as the good-hearted prostitute under the thumb of an abusive
   pimp.  It's true that Jake's been in jail for five-and-a-half years,
   but does he *really* need a love interest?  I found that it
   distracted from the reconciliatory thread between father and son with
   little gain in return.  Despite it all, model-turned-actress/folk
   singer Milla Jovovich fares well in her minor role, while Mr.
   Washington imbues Jake with shades of gentleness.</P>
<P>   Mr. Washington's such a charismatic actor that I've always wanted to
   see him play against type as an irredeemably nasty villain.  He of
   course doesn't here, nor does he really approach it, but it comes as
   no surprise that he's very good at layering darker aspects onto his
   character.  Mr. Washington is convincingly antagonistic when
   brutishly pushing and goading his young son, and does a solid job at
   depicting Jake's suppressed rage; we're incredulous to learn what
   crime had Jake committed, but a scene where he angrily blasts his
   basketball after a blow-up with Jesus dispels any doubts of a more
   volatile side of his character under the surface.  Still, Mr.
   Washington generates so much goodwill by his sheer amiable presence
   that we accept Jake completely.</P>
<P>   Mr. Lee is one of America's most important contemporary directors,
   and he's in top form with HE GOT GAME.  Always a spectacular visual
   storyteller, he employs his familiar bag of techniques (different
   film stocks, characters directly addressing the camera, insert shots,
   leaps between time frames, jump cuts, use of slow-motion, etc.)
   effectively throughout.  As with all of his films, this one has a
   great deal of heart -- at times it's extremely moving -- but I
   especially appreciated Mr. Lee's keen eye with the little touches;
   when Jesus tells his girlfriend Lala (Rosario Dawson) at one point
   that he loves her, you can just barely catch her momentarily
   flinching.</P>
<P>   The film's cast all turn in top-notch performances.  Mr. Washington
   demonstrates why he's one of our very best actors, while between this
   film and CROOKLYN, Ms. Harris clearly makes a case for herself as one
   of the top performers of her generation; she's terrific.  HE GOT GAME
   hinges on Mr. Allen in the pivotal role of Jesus, and the acting
   debut of the Milwaukee Bucks guard is legitimately superb, relaxed
   and convincing.  It's a remarkable turn, a genuine revelation.</P>
<P>   As good as the cast is, and as impressive as the contributions by
   cinematographer Malik Hassan Sayeed and editor Barry Alexander Brown
   may be, this is Mr. Lee's triumph.  Adeptly combining humour, drama,
   raw emotion and insight in affecting fashion, he once again
   demonstrates that as well as being one of the most controversial of
   directors, he's also one of the best.</P>
