<P>     Luis Alberto Lamata's NAKED WITH ORANGES is a charming, although 
not overly-taxing, love story that mixes Venezuelan history with magic 
realism.  Until the rather melodramatic conclusion, the film maintains a 
light, comic touch that keeps the audience involved in what is actually 
a rather ordinary storyline.  </P>
<P>     With the exception of a twentieth century framing tale, NAKED WITH 
ORANGES takes place during Venezuela's Federal Revolution, a time of war 
and upheaval that ravaged the country during the 1800s.  We are 
introduced to Capitan (Daniel Alvarado), an unnamed Indian officer in 
the Federal Army.  One day, Capitan's men discover a mute white woman 
(Lourdes Balera) haunting one of the houses where they stop for the 
night.  Taking pity on the unfortunate soul, whom he calls "Little 
Mute", Capitan curbs the barbaric appetites of the men and allows the 
woman to remain unmolested.  The next day, fighting breaks out, and all 
of Capitan's men are killed.  Alone, he makes his way back to the 
command post, only to discover that Little Mute has followed him.  His 
attempts to chase her away fail, and, eventually, Capitan is forced to 
chose between her safety and his future.</P>
<P>     There is a magical talisman in NAKED WITH ORANGES -- something 
called a "bilongo."  Initially unimportant, it gains significance (both 
concrete and symbolic) as the movie progresses.  According to the 
script, a bilongo is a device from the Caribbean that guarantees 
gambling success to its owner at the price of his soul.  If the bilongo 
isn't sold to another at a lower price than the one originally paid for 
it, the owner's soul will be consigned to eternal damnation.  When 
Capitan buys the bilongo, it costs only 5 pesos.  Finding someone 
willing to buy it for less proves virtually impossible.</P>
<P>     At the center of NAKED WITH ORANGES is the strange, touching love 
affair between Capitan and Little Mute.  Neither is a whole person apart 
from the other.  Once a member of the aristocracy, she has endured such 
trauma that she no longer has a voice.  He has been a military man since 
he was a boy, fighting for army after army, knowing only war and 
killing.  In his own words, "Hell isn't going to be any uglier than... 
my life."  Together, these two discover reasons to struggle and survive, 
and Capitan learns that there is beauty in a world he had previously 
associated with only death and horror.</P>
<P>     NAKED WITH ORANGES mixes religious symbolism (a painting of the 
Virgin Mary) with the more concrete, gritty aspects of its plot.  The 
ominous nature of the bilongo, combined with the constant threat of 
death, heightens the film's suspense, making some of the latter 
developments unpredictable (if a little soap opera-ish).  Yet there is 
still a fair amount of effective comedy.  NAKED WITH ORANGES is 
beautifully filmed -- some of the camera shots are literally 
breathtaking (especially a red-saturated scene with Capitan staring out 
to sea).  There's nothing ground-breaking in this movie, but it does a 
good job presenting a different culture's perspective of universal 
themes.</P>
