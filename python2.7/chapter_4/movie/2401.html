<PRE>"You didn't do the quack."
               - Albert Brooks to Nick Notle, whose character
                 thinks he's screen-testing for a drama.</PRE>
<P>     Nick Nolte sings!  At least that was the intention of
writer/director (and producer) James L. Brooks, who originally filmed
I'LL DO ANYTHING as a musical complete with songs written by Prince and
Sinead O'Conner!  But lousy test scores--in addition to audiences that
literally walked out during the songs--prompted Brooks to reshoot and
restructure his film.  The non-musical result is a charming, but
dreadfully slow, romantic comedy.</P>
<P>     The plot revolves around veteran character actor Matt Hobbs
(Nolte).  He's so desperate for work that he's taken a job as chauffeur
to movie producer Burke Adler (Brooks).  Hobbs has been handed his
six-year-old daughter, whom he hasn't seen in two years and now has to
raise on his own.  He's also attracted to one of Adler's staff
members--Cathy (Richardson), a charming development executive with
designs on restarting his career.</P>
<P>     Needless to say, the actor quickly realizes that bachelorhood and
fatherhood don't always go together.</P>
<P>     The story's second tier accompanies Adler.  His relationship with
Nan Mulhanney (Kavner), an audience-tester and dating skeptic, is under
stress because the self-obsessed producer of "Popcorn Pictures" can't
calm down.  He's bugged because his latest actioner is getting lousy
"scores." To add insult to injury, the only time his calls are returned
is at lunch.  When he's not there. (!)</P>
<P>     All this, set against the seemingly exciting and no-longer-musical
world of motion picture and television production!</P>
<P>     Handsomely shot and very well-written, I'LL DO ANYTHING is,
simply, s-l-o-w.  Here and there, a couple scenes move like the better
Brooks comedies BROADCAST NEWS and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT.  But the bulk
of it is a lazy insider-look at movie-making with a sitcom-cute kid
angle.</P>
<P>     Which doesn't work 'cause this kid ain't cute.  In fact, she's
downright obnoxious!  Up until one whopper of a cloying ending,
newcomer Whittni Wright gives a very remarkable performance.  But she
acts just like a six-year-old brat.  And that's *no* fun to watch.</P>
<P>     Dad's quite a draw, though.  Even when sporting a long-haired wig
that makes him look like Ron Perlman's "Beast," Nick Nolte gets off one
of his best (and most subtle) roles in a while.  His chemistry with
Richardson is good, too!</P>
<P>     If Nolte gets the best scenes, Albert Brooks gets all the good
lines.  As the self-absorbed Adler, he even gets a classic monologue in
which he describes a field of "exploding windmills."  Forget those
fictional Joel Silvers; this is a megalomaniac to remember!</P>
<P>     Oddly, both Tracey Ullman and Julie Kavner seem miscast.  Ullman
is barely watchable in her scenes, sporting a Bad Southern Accent as
Notle's jail-bound wife.  Kavner is more watchable, albeit unappealing,
but she doesn't have the fire to match Brooks' raging gloom.  Only
Richardson stands strong on the female front.</P>
<P>     Watch for a few cameos, including Woody Harrelson and Kavner's
"Simpsons" co-star Harry Shearer.</P>
<P>     One question lingers: who is the intended audience?  If mainstream
America didn't want to hear Nick Nolte sing, can they also appreciate
the jokes about "target audiences" and "test scores?"</P>
<PRE>Bottom line:    Intended as a musical--but recut and reshot after
                bad test screenings--I'LL DO ANYTHING is a charming,
                but s-l-o-w romantic comedy about a character actor,
                his kid, and his career.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B</PRE>
