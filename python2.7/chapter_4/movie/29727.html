<P>   Here's a question for our women readers who are dating.  What
sort of man would you prefer: one who is strong and knows what
he wants, or one who is quiet, somewhat intellectual, and has
various symptoms of illness which are merely forms of
hypochondria?  The answer would seem obvious, and I wouldn't
be surprised if 90% or more of you would list the first choice. 
Imagine what a relatively meek hypochondriac would feel if he
pals around with the strong, confident type, what with all the
women looking at the other guy and treating him as though he
were invisible!  Yet think of the kind of ecstasy the Woody-Allen
type would experience if a woman actually chose him instead of
his hardy pal!</P>
<P>   Though "Bandits" is about bank robbery, the real theme of
Harley Peyton's story directed by Barry Levinson--whose
previous projects afford him experience with the genre like
gangster pic "Donnie Brasco" and one about a mentally
challenged guy, "Rain Man"--is the conflict between two pals who
fall in love with the same woman and compete actively with each
other for her favor.  They're equally famous (or infamous) with
the general public who know the pair as The Sleepover Bandits,
but the forbearing Terry (Billy Bob Thornton) becomes
increasingly competitive with his partner Joe (Bruce Willis)
because he believes he will inevitably lose Kate (Cate Blanchett),
the woman of his dreams, to him.</P>
<P>   The story opens as a flashback.  We watch Joe and Terry in
one of their numerous disguises at work pulling a job on a west
coast bank (the movie is filmed in gorgeous Oregon and in parts
of California).  They have apparently been sold out by an
accomplice.  The cops have the place surrounded.  A narrator,
who runs a TV show on crime and famous criminals, reports that
the men have actually shot each other seemingly to avoid
surrendering and going back to the jail from which they escaped,
and then tells the TV audience the account he had heard directly
from the well-known duo when Joe and Terry slipped into his
house and insisted that he record their tale.</P>
<P>   As a romantic comedy, "Bandits" thankfully avoids the
saccharine nothingness of such current movies as "Serendipity,"
choosing an off-beat style to depict the unusual methods of these
two robbers--who never fail to say "good morning" to their victims
as they are initiating a job and wouldn't think of hurting any of
them despite their possession of guns.  Levinson shows Kate to
be a woman who seems to have it all--a spacious house, the time
and inclination to pursue her hobby of gourmet cooking--but who
is unhappy because of her passive-aggressive husband and for
whom living dangerously with these celebrated bandits would be
just the prescription.  </P>
<P>   "Bandits" is overlong at over two hours and repetitive as well:
how often can we laugh at Terry's descriptions of his alleged
brain tumor, his migraine headaches, his twitches, his eye
problem, his tintinnitus?  There are cute meetings that the
robbers, aided by their very willing female hostage, have with the
people they are going to rob.  What they do is enter the houses
of bank managers the night before a planned job, have dinner
with the executive and his family, and then force the guy to open
the bank early and withdraw the money. But these victims, who
are taken in by the charming personalities of their urban pirates,
act in predictable manners, as does one family whose kids think
the whole affair is a pleasant enough diversion and one older
woman who escorts the duo in her bank and then refuses to
open the vault knowing that "you wouldn't hurt a fly."</P>
<P>   There is a surprising twist at the conclusion, one that I would
challenge any in the audience to have guessed, and far fetched
though it may be is the cleverest part of this generally average
fare.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 125 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
