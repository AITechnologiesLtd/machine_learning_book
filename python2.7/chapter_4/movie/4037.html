<PRE>                              BEYOND RANGOON
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: An American woman is caught up in the
          1988 Democracy Riots in Burma and their aftermath.
          The brutality of the current Burmese military
          regime forms the backdrop to this moving
          politically-oriented adventure.  While the film is
          weak on solid issues, it is a good first brush for
          those who are not aware of current Burmese
          politics.   Rating: +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It is August, 1988, and Laura Bowman (Patricia Arquette) has lost
her husband and son to crime in the United States.  Shell-shocked and
feeling she has little left to live for, she has agreed to accompany
her sister on a tour of Southeast Asia.  In Rangoon she loses her
passport while visiting a mesmerizing pro-democracy rally.  Forced to
remain in Burma while her group goes on to Thailand, she finds herself
getting in deeper and deeper trouble until she is on the run across
country, chased by the military police.  Along the way she has seen
more of the day-to-day brutality of the Burmese government than the
military can afford to have her report to the outside world.
Accompanying her is a pro-democracy ex-college professor U Aung Ko
(played by U Aung Ko).</P>
<P>     When setting a story against a strongly political backdrop the
decision must always be made of how much of the issues to lay before
the audience.  BEYOND RANGOON may not be of the caliber of THE KILLING
FIELDS, an obvious film to compare this one with for more than its
Southeast Asia setting.  But BEYOND RANGOON is well ahead of the
cliched THUNDERHEART or A DRY WHITE SEASON.  For political films this
one is close to (and perhaps just a notch below) UNDER FIRE.  Yes, it
has a lot of chase scenes and hair-breadth escapes, but it also is a
fairly good introduction to the state of Burma under a military
dictatorship.</P>
<P>     Hans Zimmer can add one more exotic musical score to his resume,
and while this one is not as lyrical as some of his previous work, it
certainly works in the film.  Boorman's visual sense stands him in good
stead with a few small lapses in judgement.  One such lapse is a scene
involving mirrors that calls too much attention to itself.  Another odd
distraction has one character (a Burmese-speaking policeman who comes
to a hotel), whose words do not fit his lip movements, like in a badly
dubbed movie.</P>
<P>     Patricia Arquette seems to have the acting range of Keanu Reeves,
but as someone who has been through some trying emotional experiences
before and during the course of the film, that may be all that would be
expected of the character.  U Aung Ko has a likeable worldly air.
Since the actor and the character have the same name, one wonders if
the script told his real background.  Frances McDormand and Spaulding
Gray get second and third billing for what must have been contractual
reasons, though they are quickly out of the film.</P>
<P>     While one might question the depth of the political thought that
went into the scripting of this film, the film is certainly suspenseful
and should be pleasing for most viewers.  It should be noted that this
film did what a Nobel Peace Prize could not: it got the Burmese
government to free Aung San Suu Kyi.  I give this one a +2 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
