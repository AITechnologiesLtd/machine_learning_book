<P>"Josie and the Pussycats," writing-directing team Deborah Kaplan and Harry 
Elfont's (1998's "Can't Hardly Wait") big-screen ode to the '60s Archie comic 
and the short-lived '70s animated television show, is silly, fun, paper-thin, 
and cleverly satirical. It's not going to win any major awards (unless its 
catchy main tune, "3 Small Words," gets a much-deserved Oscar nomination come 
next year), and it doesn't quite hold up after close scrutiny, but it's 
entertaining while it lasts, which is probably what the movie's major goal 
was in the first place.</P>
<P>MegaRecords managing executive Wyatt Frame (Alan Cumming) and his diabolical 
boss and CEO of the company, Fiona (Parker Posey), have one goal, and one 
goal only: to hire a band and wickedly hide subliminal messages and product 
placements within their songs, brainwashing the youth of America. When DuJour 
(translation: "[soup] of the day"), MegaRecords' all-boy band of the moment, 
threatens to cause the company problems, they are quickly dispatched of. 
Fiona gives Wyatt just one day to find their "next big thing," which, by 
chance, comes in the form of three bubbly young women and aspiring musicians 
living in the peaceful town of Riverdale, who wish for nothing but to hit it 
big. Before long, Wyatt has signed The Pussycats (now known as "Josie and the 
Pussycats") to a scorching record deal, and in a week, have shot to the #1 
spot on the Billboard charts, with millions of obsessive fans around the 
world clamoring to see them perform in person. Little do starry-eyed Josie 
(Rachael Leigh Cook), densely sweet Melody (Tara Reid), and serious-minded 
Valerie (Rosario Dawson) know, their music is being used to send out mixed 
messages to those listening. </P>
<P>Zippy and cute, "Josie and the Pussycats" does nothing but achieve at making 
a pitch-perfect version of the Archie comic from which it is based on. 
Everything from the bright color scheme to the fantastically off-beat 
premise, the film just oozes "comic." Luckily, there is a bit more going on 
underneath than just a direct interpretation of the source material. The cast 
has a blast with their respective roles, and the music by Josie and the 
Pussycats (lead vocals by Kay Hanley of Letters to Cleo, with backup by the 
actresses) is unpredictably--almost shockingly--good, so much so that they 
could truly-to-goodness pass for a talented real-life, all-girl, alt-rock 
group.</P>
<P>As Josie herself, Rachael Leigh Cook (2001's "Antitrust") shows charismatic 
promise with a front-and-center role that hasn't been equaled since her 1999 
hit, "She's All That." Tara Reid (2001's "Just Visiting") is easily the 
standout, with her Melody an absolutely endearing character who may be looked 
upon as a "ditzy blonde," but happily trudges through life always looking on 
the bright side. Reid springs Melody to life, as her character could actually 
act as a very positive role model for pre-teens and teenagers everywhere. 
Rosario Dawson (2000's "Down to You") is the weakest link of the three, but 
only because her character of Val isn't as memorable as the other two are. 
Dawson remains likable, nonetheless, and a perfectly respectable way to round 
out the trio of Pussies.</P>
<P>Alan Cumming, more or less replaying his character from the current "Spy 
Kids," and Parker Posey (2000's "Scream 3"), ham it up as the scheming 
villains who are hiding an added secret to themselves. Cumming is good in 
anything he's in, and Posey gets many laughs from her overtly evil, 
occasionally lisping, food-obsessed diva. In other supporting roles, Gabriel 
Mann (2000's "Cherry Falls"), as Josie's best friend and potential boyfriend, 
Alan M, is appropriately bland, as is Paulo Costanzo (2000's "Road Trip"), as 
the girls' novice agent. Meanwhile, Missi Pyle (1999's "Trick") is a comic 
delight as Costanzo's dedicated sister.</P>
<P>Although it is there to make a point, and does directly correlate with the 
plot, the over-the-top product placements present in "Josie and the 
Pussycats" do grow monotonous after a while. Not only do they sometimes 
distract, and detract, from the subject matter of the given scene, but they 
also feel artificial and antithetical. Sure, the movie deals with product 
placements being used as subliminal messages, but all of the companies 
(including McDonalds, Target, Tide, Colgate, MTV, Entertainment Tonight, 
Evian, Krispy Kreme, among literally hundreds of others) were sure to 
compensate the producers real well with the added promotion. In this case, 
less might have been more.</P>
<P>In an age of cynicism, "Josie and the Pussycats" is innocent, light-hearted, 
and charming. Perfect for children, as well as adults, the movie might not be 
free of flaws (actually, it is far from it, with an opening half-hour that 
has trouble finding its footing), but it is free of terribly risque or 
raunchy humor, which works in the film's favor. And Tara Reid's Melody 
Valentine most definitely gives us an idea of the zestful mindframe of the 
Pussycats with one of the movie's best lines: "If I could go back in time," 
she cheerily proclaims, "I would love to meet Snoopy."</P>
