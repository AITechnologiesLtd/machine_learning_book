<PRE>MUSIC OF THE HEART
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>When a director like Wes Craven, who has built his career on horror
flicks, wants to find something different for a change of pace, what
does he pick? How about a script from Pamela Gray about teaching violin
to Harlem students -- a story "inspired" by a documentary, as the
credits claim?</P>
<P>You might expect an edgy movie, full of surprises. If you do, you'd be
wrong. MUSIC OF THE HEART is MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS dumbed down and clichéd
up. Even if the subject it chronicles is worthy, the film about it is so
hopelessly saccharine that watching it may induce sugar overload.</P>
<P>The film stars Meryl Streep as divorced, single mother of two, Roberta
Guaspari, a long time substitute teacher who establishes what becomes a
wildly successful violin program for inner city kids. The schmaltzy
script that Streep has to work from is beneath her, but, like the
trooper she is, she gives it her all.</P>
<P>The well disciplined children have such nice manners that you'll find it
hard to believe that they live in a ghetto. Roberta is a miracle worker.
One minute her students are screeching away on their violins, and the
next they're making melodious music at a concert.</P>
<P>The scenes are set up for maximum emotional effect. Roberta teaches her
kids, for example, that standing tall and firm is part of the musical
training regiment. She pushes one girl over only to realize that she
wears leg braces. In another incident she reproves a girl for being late
to class. When Roberta probes for the reason, she finds that the girl's
grandmother has been mugged. When Roberta inquires whether her
grandmother is okay now, the girl explains that she is dead. Raise the
melancholy background music up high and cut. Impact made.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, half of the movie concerns not the music program but
Roberta's family and social life. Her two boys put an ad in the
personals to find her a date. They even bet on whether her first date
will kiss her or not.</P>
<P>The film's saving grace is a rousing, star-studded ending that is the
musical equivalent of the big game. It is completely satisfying even if
the level of the kids' playing isn't quite believable. The satisfying
conclusion does not, however, make up for the all the time waiting for
it.</P>
<P>MUSIC OF THE HEART runs too long at 2:04. It is rated PG for language
and would be fine for kids of any age, but those younger than teenagers
are likely to be bored.</P>
