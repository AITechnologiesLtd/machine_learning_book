<P>"I never saw A Purple Cow/ I never hope to see one/But I can tell 
you, anyhow/I'd rather see than be one." (Gelett Burgess, 1866-? 
though often attributed to Ogden Nash)</P>
<P>I never saw a shrink. I hope I never will.  The mind-analyzers or 
healers I know are movie characters. By those standards, Mumford is 
most unorthodox.</P>
<P>He's  played by Loren Dean, 30, who has acted in at least a dozen 
movies I've seen -- but I cannot remember him. Here his Mumford 
looks 30 too.  Unlike so many movie shrinks -- especially in 
comedies -- he's not older,  bearded. has no German accent and 
doesn't act shrinkingly. Who's that man?</P>
<P>He has set up business in a relatively shabby office in a smallish 
town called Mumford, too. Ah, there must be a catch to this, but 
what?  Mumford is an old mill-town (no joke about Miltown the 
medicine) which had fallen into bad times but recovered thanks to 
the Panda Modem factory which employs most of the Mumfordians.</P>
<P>Being ignorant of the ratio of shrinks, I would think that the two 
already in Mumford were plenty.  When Mumford appears, three's a 
crowd. He becomes the most popular of his genus, with methods that 
are un-kosher. How he listens or does not, how he interrupts his 
patients, how he cuts them off and even dismisses them, how he does 
everything else are, to put it mildly, different if not odd  But 
he's not "colorful" either.</P>
<P>His clients range from pathetic to compulsive to sweet to 
obnoxious.They are weirdos, but when all is said and done, you like 
them. Something of a modified, sophisticated Frank Capra seems to 
lie beneath the film's exterior.</P>
<P>Most people like Mr Mumford, starting with Alfre Woodard his 
landlady, neighbor and  cafe-owner. Appealing, wise but not 
sententious, probably complex, she's the one major character who 
would never need to consult a shrink. But young  geek Skip 
Skipperton does.</P>
<P>He's the Panda Modem creator, is worth three billion dollars 
already, is likable, has his own problems, spends most of his time 
skateboarding like a champion, does some strange things. To avoid 
the publicity,  he proposes to Mumford that they meet not as doctor 
and patient but as friends. Which they become in reality. It works. 
Mumford, in fact, most unprofessionally, discusses his other 
patients with him. Original, to say the least.</P>
<P>Without making this film primarily a setting for characters, or a 
love story, or a mystery, these and other elements are all there, 
nicely blended, humorously treated, cleverly sketched out. We feel 
that Mr Mumford, an addict of Unsolved Mysteries on TV,  has his 
owns secrets. There are little clues from the start, but they do not 
point to specifics.  We may or may not begin to guess what's up as 
the film unfurls. Yet nothing hits you over the head, you are kept 
watching, enjoying , smiling, and very often, laughing.</P>
<P>All performances hit the spot.  So does Lawrence Kasdan's track 
record, as writer, director  and producer. The first movie he made 
was Body Heat (1981). Then came The Big Chill, Silverado, The 
Accidental Tourist, I Love you to Death, Grand Canyon, Wyatt Earp, 
French Kiss. A select, unhurried body of work, often original and 
pioneering, stressing psychology (unpedantically), interractions 
among people, often several of them. There's clarity and sensitivity 
there, as well as humor as in movies he wrote and others directed: 
Two of the Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark, for instance.</P>
<P>The consistency of a very good "auteur" runs throughout the variety 
of his work. Mumford is the most recent link in a remarkable chain.</P>
