Network </PRE>
<PRE>**** (out of four)</PRE>
<P> As I watched Network, Sidney Lumet and Paddy Chayefsky's stunning
satire of news journalism, I drew parallels to the beginnings of my
career; I'm currently trying to work my way into journalism and news
reporting, trying to live out my dream of being a reporter or an
editor.  I've written what seems like thousands of cover letters to
anyone with a publication, begging editors to take a chance on me. I
write these letters as though I were on my hands and knees; because
sometimes it's just that hard to break into the field.  You'd try
anything, even begging.  Network starts out with idealistic people
like me in mind, but then let's us know that there is absolutely no
room for realism where money and ratings are involved and leaves us
behind in the first fifteen minutes.  After all, most, if not all,
news outlets are run by corporations who are bound to fulfill life's
beautiful chain: you have to make people watch or read your product,
advertisers will pay money to reach those people, and money is
God. This isn't a new concept, of course, but it's delivery in Network
is so cynical and angry that it seems new and leaves you with a sense
of doom.</P>
<P> "I'm mad as hell and I'm not gong to take it anymore!" I've been
saying that line for years, but until I first watched Network, I
didn't realize it's significance.  I had no idea what "it" was. The
story is about, more or less, Howard Beale (played by Peter Finch),
who had been the nightly newscaster for the fictional UBS news for the
past eleven years, until he was fired for low ratings. He had nothing
else except his news job; no kids, no wife, so his whole life revolves
around being a journalist. You can imagine what this must do to a
person.  When Beale is told that he has been fired, he goes on air to
announce his suicide. He's calmed down and given one more chance, but
this time he goes on air to say that life "is bullshit, always has
been bullshit, always will be bullshit." That doesn't get him fired:
the network realizes that his on air tirades are ratings gold, and it
gets him his job back. Beale is later "taken over" by the truth, and
his show isn't about news, but becomes his own pulpit to tell a studio
audience and anyone else who will tune in what's wrong with our world
(and the answer was almost always the network he worked for.) The show
is a number in the ratings.</P>
<P> Network's critique of news ends about halfway through the film and
moves on to television and people who grew up knowing nothing else
besides the glowing box (people like me). Faye Dunaway, who is perfect
in this movie, plays the vice president in charge of programming.
When she realizes that Beale is a ratings bonanza, she demands to be
put in charge of the news.  What does she know of journalism? Nothing,
but she knows everything about getting people to tune in; so she
creates and supports Beale's news circus.  Her character is a
television; it is superficial and cannot feel emotion. In a way she is
nothing more than a machine from a show like Lost in Space.</P>
<P> William Holden plays one of the only characters sane characters in
the story.  He had been in charge of the news department, but watched
as Dunaway turn into a circus. Still, he leaves and betrays his wife
to start an affair with Dunaway, because he's attached to the
television too.  "I can't get you out of my mind." Holden realizes
that she's nothing more than a television, but still tells her, "All I
want is you for you to love me."</P>
<PRE> "I don't know how," she replies.</PRE>
<P> "I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore" has been accepted
as one of most favored maxims. All of us, at several times during our
lives, are mad as hell, and many of us shout those exact same
words. We scream that we won't take it anymore, but really, what do we
do about it? Network is the kind of movie that critiques what is
wrong, but then asks us what we're going to do about it, knowing full
well that the only answer is nothing. We just take pleasure in
shouting from the windows that we're mad as hell.  It's the release
that we enjoy. Network is the blackest type of satire; like
Dr. Strangelove, it creates a reality that is extremely plausible and
convinces us that it could happen, but at the same time tries to
maintain a level morbid insanity and humor. The events in Network
could happen (and some would argue that Fox Television has already
created that reality) but we laugh it off because we know there's
nothing we're going to do about it.</P>
