<PRE>AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS
---------------------</PRE>
<P>Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) and Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones) were 
America's favorite Hollywood couple, appearing in one blockbuster after 
another together.  But when they teamed up with genius filmmaker 
Hal Weidmann (Christopher Walken), Gwen began an affair with her Spanish 
supporting costar Hector (Hank Azaria, "The Birdcage") that drove Eddie 
into an asylum and Gwen off the box office charts.  It's now up to Lee
Phillips (Billy Crystal) to get the two together for the press junket of
Weidmann's film in "America's Sweethearts."</P>
<P>Lee's not only dealing with warring costars - Weidmann is holding his film
hostage and Lee has to keep the press preoccupied so they don't notice they're
not seeing the movie. Lee puts the focus on the separated couple, leaking
videotape of an apparently masturbating Eddie outside of Gwen's cottage
followed by a picture of them canoodling in a car.  This brings the jealous
Hector out to the desert resort to beat Eddie senseless and provide more
publicity.  Meanwhile, Gwen's sister/assistant Kiki (Julia Roberts), who's
shed sixty pounds since Gwen and Eddie's breakup, has consummated her long 
time crush on Eddie by falling into bed with him.</P>
<P>Writers Billy Crystal and Peter Tolan ("Analyze This") had a brilliant idea 
to anchor a screwball comedy, but while they sprinkle the script with several 
brilliant bits, their story begins to deflate just when it should be reaching 
its comic climax.  They neglect to develop some characters, most notably 
Eddie, and their big moment, when Weidmann finally unspools his film, is 
painfully unfunny.</P>
<P>"America's Sweethearts'" all star cast, therefore, have varying degrees of 
success bringing this thing to life.  Firstly, Julia Roberts must be given
credit for creating the most human, audience empathetic, character in
Kiki.  Long subjected to the petty demands of her spoiled sister, Kiki 
soldiers on, coordinating hundreds of details lest Gwen encounter reality
('Is that the water with the electrolytes?  I only drink water with the
electrolytes.')  Julia nails the film's best scene, where Kiki finally has
her meltdown over a hungry man's breakfast, like the superstar pro she's
become.  Unfortunately, the flashback scenes which feature her in a fat suit
merely make her look stiff.</P>
<P>Most comical of the film's cast is Catherine Zeta-Jones as the high maintenance
movie diva.  She wheedles and pouts until her supreme unalienable right to
be the center of the universe is granted.  In a hilarious bit, as Lee is
convincing her to attend the junket, we see her Doberman attack a window
washer outside, bringing the man to the ground, mauling him.  When Lee informs
her of this as the huge beast bounds into the room, she coos 'puppy!' 
obliviously.  </P>
<P>The always dependable John Cusack tries to inject his 
considerable charm into Eddie Thomas.  While he's marginally appealing, 
the character has been so neglected by the writers that he comes across 
shallowly.  Hank Azaria starts off well, doing what appears to be a parody 
of Antonio Banderas, but his lisping, heavy accent gets wearisome quickly.  
Crystal's given himself many of his movie's best lines, but he barely breaks 
a sweat creating his PR guy.  Christopher Walken's miscast as the Hal 
Ashby-like director who edits his films in the Unabomber's shack, which he's 
had transported to the grounds of his estate.  Stanley Tucci is fine as the
hand-wringing studio head beholden to Phillips after having fired him, while
Seth Green disappears into the background as Lee's protege who was to have
replaced him.  Alan Arkin amusingly plays the 'Richard Libertini role' of 
Eddie's self help guru.</P>
<P>The Hyatt Regency Lake Las Vegas Resort is a good location choice for this
glossy production, luxurious yet remote.  Unfortunately, the cast
careening around its grounds keep the audience remote more often than 
they allow them to luxuriate in classic comedy.</P>
