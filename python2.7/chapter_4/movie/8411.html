<PRE>        "Daddy, why can't I have a monkey?" -- Short Cuts, 1993</PRE>
<P>Set in the bustle of Los Angeles, this star-studded Robert Altman
cinematic tapestry tells the interlocking stories of a host of
characters.  <em>Tapestry</em> is precisely the right word.  Each
character is a thread in said tapestry, who contributes to the big
picture, interacts with other characters who also contribute to the
big picture, but really have no conception as to what the big
picture looks like.</P>
<P>We do.  We see everything that happens to each of the characters in
the few days the film spans.  This omniscience gives us, the audience,
a unique perspective.  We can see the series of accidents and chance
that change the course of people's lives forever.  The characters
persevere, try hard to make their lives work.  Sometimes they do,
sometimes they don't.  Usually it's a mix of the two and often dictated
by happenings completely out of their control.  If each of the
characters knew everything there was to know about all the others,
how much more compassionate, less angry, might they all be, and how
much simpler their lives?  All the characters are linked to all the
others in some direct or indirect way, but no one knows everybody.
Roger Ebert surmised in his review how much things might change if
they did.  One character might never meet another character throughout
the course of the film, but has plenty of precisely what the other
needs.  Maybe some of these perfect pairs will one day meet up --
several, undoubtedly, will not.</P>
<P>"Real life" films rarely interest me.  This one fascinates me.  I was
not expecting to love it so -- I expected fine filmmaking, but not
necessarily fine entertainment.  <em>Short Cuts</em> does several
things with smashing success:  it is an upstanding example of
cinematic art, it is engrossing entertainment, it is hilariously
funny, it is poignant and moving, and it inspires an awe rarely
evoked by every day life.  Within the days that the film takes place,
there are momental events that take place, which the characters will
never forget as long as they live, and there are the routine events
that occur and are forgotten.  All of these are somehow made
fascinating in some way.  Frances McDormand's story, for instance,
about her affair with a married man and a malicious ex, borders on
hysteria.  There are no punchlines -- it's pure situational humor,
in the uncorrupted sense of the term -- and induced greater laughter
in myself than most pure comedies can do.  Andie MacDowell's story,
on the other hand, evokes our utmost concern and compassion, more so
than most pure dramas can.  <em>Short Cuts</em> is surprising,
shocking, and unpredictable in this fashion -- true to life, just
when things seem settled and ordinary, something happens that snaps
you attention.  And it's a different <em>kind</em> of thing each
time.  It might be a sudden moment of humor or horror, or a facet of
a character abruptly revealed that shows us that they're all real
people after all, not the stereotypes that a few of them seem like at
first.</P>
<P>Rare indeed is a film that runs over three hours yet leaves us wanting
more.  Most of the stories have resolutions of some sort, enough to
provide a necessary level of satisfaction a viewer expects from a
film.  But the end of the film isn't the end of the stories -- no
more so than the beginning of the film was the beginning of the
stories.  In real life, episodes in people's lives never really end --
they shape the people they happen to, are often recalled in sporadic
moments, and always affect their futures.  The film's open-ended
conclusion is appropriate and necessary, but it is admittedly
disconcerting to see the credits roll so soon.  It takes some
thought and reflection afterward to bring the film to a close in our
own minds.  Viewers put off by the seemingly abrupt end may not be
inclined to do so and will therefore not fully appreciate it.
But the characters must get on with their lives, and we must get
on with ours.</P>
