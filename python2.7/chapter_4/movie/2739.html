<P>     Bhaji is an Indian snack food whose identity has been
"Westernized" in the British Isles.  Director Gurinder Chadha has
chosen bhaji as a metaphor for the lives of the women in this, her
first feature film.  Although Indian by birth, the
characters--especially those of the younger generation--have been in
large part shaped by the culture of England, the country in which they
live.  BHAJI ON THE BEACH not only examines this cross-cultural
conflict, but looks at sexism and the generation gap, as well.</P>
<P>     There are so many stories that it's sometimes difficult to keep up
with each one, especially in the beginning, when the characters are
being introduced.  If there's an obvious failing in Chadha's work, it's
that she's too ambitious.  She has a lot to say and, apparently, wants
to say it all in one movie.  The result is a controlled chaos that can,
upon occasion, become confusing.</P>
<P>     The main characters are three twenty-something Asian women who
have grown up in England.  There's Ginder (Kim Vithana), a young mother
who is seeking a divorce from an abusive husband (Jimmi Harkishin),
bringing scandal down on both families.  Hasida (Sarita Khajuria) is a
pre-med student engaged in a secret affair with Oliver (Mo Sesay), an
African British man.  This affair has resulted in an unexpected
pregnancy that throws Hasida's entire future in turmoil, especially
since Oliver won't commit to anything.  Simi (Shaheen Khan), the third
member of the trio, doesn't have a "story" of her own, but is
instrumental in attempting to resolve everyone else's problems.  She is
the coordinator and the voice of reason.</P>
<P>     There are other characters, as well.  Asha (Lalita Ahmed) is a
dutiful, middle-aged wife who is suffering from headaches and visions.
There are a pair of teenagers looking to pick up white boys, and a
geriatric lady who refuses to accept anything that threatens her
strict, conservative views of morality.</P>
<P>     All these women are participants in the "Saheli Asian Women's
Group" outing to Blackpool.  There, on the beach, each of these tales
reaches some sort of crossroad.</P>
<P>     Throughout much of the movie, Chadha keeps the tone light--a
demanding task considering the amount of material she's juggling.  The
final fifteen minutes, which include an overload of melodrama and a
shocking display of violence, are not as well directed as the previous
eighty-five, and the mood is at variance with what came before.  Like
her creative idol, Ken Loach, the director attempts to blend gritty
realism with natural comedy, but her success is qualified.  She has an
accurate grasp of the little details of life, but sometimes the broader
strokes elude her.</P>
<P>     For the most part, the characters are richly drawn, and this helps
to maintain balance among the different stories.  There aren't
sequences in BHAJI ON THE BEACH where the action bogs down because
we're waiting for the focus to shift.  Admittedly, certain subplots,
such as Hashida's relationship with Oliver, are better-presented than
others, but nothing stands out as being obviously superior.</P>
<P>     There's a line of dialogue in BHAJI ON THE BEACH that sums up the
film: "It's not often that we women get away from the patriarchal
demands made on us in our daily lives, struggling under the double yoke
of racism and sexism."  When Simi says this, she does so with a broad
smile.  It's a serious statement, but not one ponderously made.  And
that seems to be Chadha's view of filmmaking:  explore themes, but let
the philosophical issues blend into the story, not dominate it.  If she
continues to abide by this creed, it may not take many more films
before she's turning out pictures to rival Loach's RIFF-RAFF and
RAINING STONES.</P>
