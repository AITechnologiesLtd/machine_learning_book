<P>Arnold Schwarzenegger.  An example of how big you can make it in the movies
and then have it fall apart so fast.  In the 90's, Ah-nuld has only had
three good films.  'Total Recall', 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' and
'Eraser'.  'Last Action Hero' was Arnold's egotistical version of Bruce
Willis' 'Hudson Hawk' and 'True Lies' was both uneven, only mildly funny,
and lacked James Cameron's signature heap of kinetics.  I enjoyed Arnold's
work mildly in the comedies 'Twins' and 'Kindergarten Cop' but not 'Junior'.
Arnold served in the Bush administration in some sort of fitness advisor
capacity.  I forget the official title he carried but George Bush's claim
that he wanted to be a kinder, gentler president prompted Arnie to make his
second terminator portrayal a kinder gentler character.  A humourous
metaphor for his political connections, but let's be honest here, did we
really need a kinder and gentler terminator?  Give me a break!  He takes an
oath in the movie at the insistence of John Connor (Edward Furlong), that he
will not kill anybody.  So let's face it, Leonard Maltin was right when he
said that the first terminator movie was better simply because the film, and
Arnold's character, had much more edge.</P>
<P>Satan.  His image conjures up many things wrong in the world.  He's been
played by many actors.  Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino and even little old George
Burns have played the fallen angel most uniquely.  And now Gabriel Byrne
plays him with an ice cold sinister deviousness.  Byrne is a great actor
whose work in 'Miller's Crossing' and 'The Usual Suspects' remains his best.
He even had a hand in producing one of this decades most emotionally wrought
political dramas, 'In the Name of the Father'.</P>
<P>Both Schwarzenegger and Byrne provide a good and not so obvious game of cat
and mouse in 'End of Days'.  The first thing I should say about this film is
that it has so many plot holes and enough credibility gaps to allow a
transport truck to drive through that you must toss these factors aside if
you truly want to enjoy the picture.  Director Peter Hyams, whose work is
better when he has a hand in writing or co-writing his own scripts has a few
films I really enjoy.  'The Star Chamber' from 1983 where a group of
vigilante judges carry out their own brand of justice.  'Outland' from 1981
with Sean Connery in an outer space version of 'High Noon' and 1979's
'Hanover Street' with Harrison Ford as a World War II pilot having an affair
with a married English woman.</P>
<P>Hyams often acts as his own director of photography and clouds his films in
a murky and charcoal type of atmosphere which are fitting in adding to his
many scenes of compelling structure.  His vision is sometimes repetitive but
he makes fairly decent films.</P>
<P>Written by Andrew W. Marlowe, 'End of Days' is about an ex-cop and present
day high profile security officer (Schwarzenegger) who becomes involved in
confronting Satan when a young woman is chosen to be Satan's concubine who
will bear his child to walk upon the earth in the next millennium.  The film
begins in Vatican City in 1979 where the Pope and his council agree that the
time has come, based on a sign, where a female will be born in the world
that will be the chosen one for Satan's nasty scheme of planting his seed on
Earth.  Around the same time, a baby girl is born in New York City and a
ritual is carried out upon her at the hospital where she's born that will
put her under Satan's spell.  Skip forward 20 years.  1999.  Things begin
coming together on a collision course for the sake of mankind's existence.
A wall street banker (Byrne) goes to the men's room of an NYC restaurant and
is accosted in the men's room by the tangible spirit of Satan to walk the
streets in a man's body.  Satan has planted his disciples in positions of
advantage that will aid him in his plan to have Christine York (Robin
Tunney) bear his child and witness the end of man's days upon the planet.</P>
<P>Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger) hooks up with the plot when he investigates
and assassin's plan to open fire on the streets of NYC.  He then finds the
writings of a street vagrant in an abandoned underground tunnel way and
connects the writings with quotes from the Bible and locks horns with the
devil in an attempt to protect the forces of good in the film.</P>
<P>Now, in 'The Exorcist' the devil was defeated with two priests being
sacrificed in the process.  Their religious bindings and the word of God
were powerful enough to expel the devil from a little girl's body.  'End of
Days' just doesn't come off as credible.  An observation is made in the film
that only the pure of heart can kill the devil and Cane isn't pure of heart.
He's angry at God for letting his family be taken from him and is a flawed
and truly mortal being whom Satan could squash like a bug if he really
wanted to.  In other films and t.v. shows where the bad guys always let the
good guys hang on just a little too long to defeat them which proves to be
their downfall, well, this is what happens in 'End of Days'.  There are also
scenes of action and excitement that just aren't credible and bring the film
down to an almost laughable capacity.  However, the portrayal of Satan by
Byrne, the special effects and some good camera work redeem the film
somewhat.</P>
<P>What's also funny is some of the humour displayed which are inside jokes
based on 'The Usual Suspects' from 1995.  Arnold's side kick in this film is
Kevin Pollak who appeared as one of the criminals in 'The Usual Suspects'
with Gabriel Byrne.  There is a scene where a trail of flammable fluid is
set a blaze to cause a big explosion, seen in 'The Usual Suspects' and a
line is delivered that says: "The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was
convincing the world he didn't exist".....a classic line uttered by Kevin
Spacey in 'The Usual Suspects'.  'End of Days' can stand fully on its own
and is worth a look by the curious but only die hard Arnold fans will
embrace it as great.  For the rest of us, it's an average ride all the way.</P>
