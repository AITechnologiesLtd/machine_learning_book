<PRE>Pokemon the First Movie  (1999) 75m</PRE>
<P>A POKEMON PRIMER!  MYSTERIES REVEALED TO THE UNINITIATED!  AND SOMETHING 
ABOUT THE MOVIE!</P>
<P>I love the idea of middle-aged film critics who have paid their dues, worked 
their way up the ladder, and secured their credibility now finding 
themselves in child-packed audiences watching a cartoon derived from a 
phenomenon that they find incomprehensible, all the time aware that they 
have to write about it afterwards.  The dilemma: this is a product with a 
very specific target audience.  To review it from a purely adult perspective 
would be uncharitable.  To leave its verdict in the hands of the 
ten-year-olds it was pitched at would bring only the conclusions that "it 
sucked" or "it was cool", or perhaps a little of both, if the ten-year-old 
in question had any future vocation as a film critic.</P>
<P>I'm not a fan of POKEMON but I find it more interesting and enjoyable than 
most other cartoons that are around, although it's hard to tell what may 
have been 'improved' in translation (the English-language version is crammed 
with puns).  For a start, the episodes are not stand-alone entries, but 
follow a story arc that enables minor developments to enter the growing 
storyline unobtrusively (this is why I imagine many adults find any 
randomly-tuned episode mystifying: POKEMON the series makes no apologies for 
the fact that you need to have been watching from the beginning - but isn't 
this true of many adult television series' also?).  The characters, too, are 
a little more complicated than…well, let's say COW AND CHICKEN, why not?  
The central character, Ash, is overconfident, mulish, and has an obsession 
with Pokemon (a portmanteau of 'pocket monsters') that is destined for a 
major dysfunction.  Ash's friend Brock, meanwhile, has a fetish with women 
in uniform that's downright embarrassing, leaving their female companion 
Misty to provide the sole voice of reason (their adversaries, a trio known 
as Team Rocket, are just as single-minded but far more entertaining).  One 
can uneasily draw comparisons to the boy hero of this series and the 
Pokemon-crazed viewers watching him: each show begins with the signature 
tune "gotta catch 'em all", as simple a philosophy as you'd ever need when 
you're ten years old, and most likely the main reason this show has become 
so popular.  Despite its complex narrative, the core purpose - to find 
Pokemon and train them - is what drives its appeal.  Forming a roster of 
creatures from the Nintendo game upon which the cartoon was based, POKEMON 
offers its followers the irresistible urge to *collect*, either vicariously 
through Ash's adventures or more practically for a few bucks at K-Mart.  The 
whole collecting bug doesn't just stop at the Pokemon themselves: once 
caught the creatures are then used as pawns in staged combat to aid Ash's 
further obsession to collect combat badges (this show has the moral stance 
of cockfighting) which in turn will allow him to enter a higher level of 
arena in the Pokemon League, and so on and so on.</P>
<P>It may be that the values of POKEMON's protagonist have tapped into the 
unconscious of a generation that compulsively watches the show and codifies 
its critters without really knowing why.  This at least is a more valid 
platform for criticism against the show than its supposed violence.  Unlike 
POWER RANGERS and NINJA TURTLES and other intense (though short-lived) 
television crazes, POKEMON does not promote rough play in the schoolyard.  
In fact, any kid wanting to emulate the combat routines of their favorite 
Pokemon is going to have their work cut out for them.  Most of these 
monsters are just plain dorky and their attacks, reminiscent of the D&D 
role-playing game, diverse to the point of absurdity.  Some sing to their 
opponents and then scribble on their faces when they're asleep; others kiss; 
create gusts of wind; cause headaches; throw leaves; blow bubbles.  When 
it's time for the real fighting to get underway it usually involves a group 
of Pokemon hurling lightning bolts, water cannons, and flamethrowers at each 
other.  It sounds lethal, and it probably is - but Pokemon don't fight to 
the death.  At least not intentionally.  At least not in any scenario we'll 
ever get to see.</P>
<P>But now from the small screen to the big one, and where does this leave the 
movie?  It's the same, but a little different.  The candy colors of the TV 
show have gone, overwhelmed by shadows and voids.  The tone is less 
frivolous, so gone too are the opportunities for the often hilarious 
combination of Team Rocket to play out their hapless schemes.  As villains, 
they are outclassed by the newest and most powerful addition to the Pokemon 
catalogue, a genetically-created creature called Mewtwo.  Unlike its kin, 
Mewtwo is a figure of evil, more of the Manga mold than Pokemon, and the 
film is slanted accordingly.  It's an interesting move of the film-makers 
because it positions POKEMON: THE FIRST MOVIE as a 'safe' introduction to a 
more adult form of Japanese animation, as if they are aware that their 
audience is growing older and that they must grow with it.  Such themes 
synchronize with another significant element of the show, which in itself 
grew from simple beginnings like computer games and playing cards: Pokemon 
evolve from cuddly pets to more fearsome (but still tame) variations.  This 
is usually accomplished unexpectedly in the heat of battle and takes but a 
few moments, as if a hormonal rush has given them the growth spurt to end 
all spurts.  You can get as psychoanalytical about this as you want, but 
bear in mind that Ash's most precious creature, Pikachu, is unlikely to ever 
evolve into its mature counterpart.  As strongly connected as they are to 
each other, Pikachu and Ash will always be children, never 'evolving' or 
growing out of their play-fight universe.  It's about time they were shown a 
darker side of their world this time around, even if it has to bear forth 
the clumsy revelation that "Fighting Is Wrong!".</P>
<P>POKEMON isn't great, but it isn't bad either.  Regular viewers will 
appreciate the in-jokes (e.g. "Who's that Pokemon?") and first-timers 
shouldn't have any problem keeping up with the story.  The animation is 
serviceable, although not as eccentric as in the television series, and 
there are a couple of exciting action sequences involving a storm at sea and 
a panicky chase in a laboratory.  There's also the rare appearance of Mew, 
the much sought-after Pokemon that was circulated among a small percentage 
of the Nintendo games - I have a feeling that this movie will definitely 
boost his popularity.  Curious and playful, this powerful kitty will 
probably give even Pikachu a run for his money as the cartoon's unofficial 
mascot.  After all, he is colored a newborn pink, emerges from an embryonic 
bubble in the ocean, and is even less likely in danger of ever growing up.</P>
