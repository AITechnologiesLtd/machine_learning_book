<PRE>                            PLAYING MONA LISA
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Playing Mona Lisa follows the life of Claire Goldstein (Alicia
Witt), who slowly unravels as various forces of nature turn against
her.  Claire's life is not unlike the movie as a whole, which starts off
strong but meanders to a non-ending that is unlikely to leave anyone
very satisfied.</P>
<P>     Claire is a "brilliant" 23-year old pianist, which is apt casting
for Witt, considering she is also a real-life piano prodigy.  On the eve
of her graduation from the San Francisco Academy of Music, Claire's life
starts to come undone.  First she doesn't make it into a big piano
competition.  Then she gets dumped, then evicted, then just plain whiny
as she realizes her family (with whom she is now forced to live) is full
of freaks.</P>
<P>     Subplots galore include messy wedding preparations for sister
Jenine (Molly Hagan) and a neurosis for dad (Elliott Gould), but Claire
is the centerpiece of the film -- and rightly so.  Witt is radiant as an
actress, and the few times she's been able to strut her stuff at the
movies (see Fun), she's stolen the show.  Unfortunately, Mona Lisa's
rambling storyline portrays Claire as so incapable of motivation that
she is literally paralyzed with inaction, so Witt doesn't have much
range to show off.</P>
<P>     The bulk of the film becomes a hand-wrenching "How will Claire get
by?" when she really just needs to get off her ass and stop bitching.
There's nothing overly compelling about her self-made tragedy --
everyone's been dumped once in life -- so it's hard to be overly
sympathetic.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, Witt is so dazzling she largely overcomes the
limitations of her character and makes Playing Mona Lisa (a reference to
some advice her friend gives her about creating a healthy state of mind)
mostly watchable.  It's not great cinema, but it's worth a chuckle or
two.</P>
