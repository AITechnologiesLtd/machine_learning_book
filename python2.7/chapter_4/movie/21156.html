Runaway Bride, The 
Cast: Julia Roberts, Richard Gere, Hector Elizondo and Rita Wilson.</PRE>
<P>* *1/2 out of five
The Runaway Bride is one of those films that comes along that seems as if it
too very little thought to come up with; and probably did. But somehow you
still like the characters and the story itslef. Also you realize it's fault,
which come in abundance as well. Overall this is a split decision (positive or
negative review in general) and I am going to have to go towards a negative
response.</P>
<P>In this movie Miss Roberts plys a women who seemingly looks at marriage as a
contact sport. She leads those men up to the altar and then throws the final
punch and runs off (hence the title). Once the big-time journalist (for USA
Today) Ike Graham from the "big city" hears about this he writes a demeaning
article for which he is fired. In order to redeem himself and perhaps get his
job back he goes to the small hometown of Maggie Carpenter (Roberts) and
promises to stay for her next wedding and write an article that is completely
truthful. Maybe he'll even clear her name.</P>
<P>In this film, the cast of one of the greatest romantic comedies of the nineties
(Pretty Women), comes back to a project that is also about love and how it
isn't always perfect unless you're perfect for one another. Only this time the
idea is not as fresh and interesting instead dull and easily predictable.</P>
<P>While the characters are easily relatable and we may laugh now and then at a
cute or funny joke thrown in, sometimes those laughs are what I like to refer
to as 'pity laughs'. Although I amhappy to say this film didn't call for all
that many of those.</P>
<P>I will be the first to admit that I am an advid Julia Roberts fan. I even liked
My Best Friends Wedding. And the question that is the most important to be
asked by critics for this film is whether or not, in our opinion, Richard Gere
and Roberts believably fell in love again in The Runaway Bride. Sadly, my reply
is no.</P>
<P>But I cannot hoinestly blame that on the actors, I must shift the blame over to
the writers. Who had a cute idea for this but did not get enough into the two
lead characters and their deep personalities. There were a few scenes when we
do get some information on this but not enough to convince me that these two
characters, both with seperate and different mind sets, were in love with one
another.</P>
<P>To wrap this up instead of rambling on, I just barely give a negative opinion
on this. Because while it is cute and a movie that is great for a young
couple... it leaves you wondering whether it could have been better. Whether it
could have been more than it was. The acting helped the film and some of the
clever punchlines along the way made for a clever experience. Because this
could go either way, see it for yourself.     C</P>
