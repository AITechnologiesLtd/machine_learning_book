<PRE>THE OTHERS
A film review by Pete Croatto
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>The Others has a great ending -- one that will be spoofed in Scary Movie
4 and referred to in Entertainment Weekly for years to come.  It's the
reason why people will rush to the theater this summer, spurred on by
the word of mouth from friends and co-workers.</P>
<P>What people will forget to tell you is that there's more than 90 minutes
of an OK horror movie to watch before a glorious 10 minutes.  Take away
the ending--which ties the script's agnostic themes together too
perfectly--and you get The Haunting, just with superior acting and
production values.</P>
<P>The latest horrorfest brings us to 1945 England, where the repressed,
icy Grace, played by Nicole Kidman (Note: Tom Cruise served as an
executive producer on the film), cares for her kids Ann and Nicholas
(Alakina Mann and James Bentley) in a colossal house, where things are
in turmoil.  Grace has been told that her husband (Christopher
Eccleston), who's fighting in World War II, is missing and unlikely to
return.  The house's staff has simply vanished.  And to top it all off,
Ann repeatedly sees visions of another family who she says used to live
in the house.</P>
<P>Ann tries to explain what she sees to her dubious mother, who drums
Christian doctrine into her children's heads and has an impatient
streak.  At first, Grace doubts her daughter.  But when doors fly open
and unknown screams are unleashed, Grace strives (unsuccessfully) to
gain control of the situation.  Meanwhile, the new housekeeping staff
led by the friendly Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), acts peculiar. Mrs.
Mills tells Ann that she has seen the same visions, and that their
presence will lead to some changes in the house.</P>
<P>The movie is propelled by a few highlights, most notably its look.  The
house is devoid of natural light (the kids are allergic to it), which
gives the movie a continually creepy feel.  Fog swirls in and out,
creating a dreamlike environment.  Throughout the movie, Kidman dresses
in long, uncomfortable dresses, which scream her repression and cool
demeanor.  The kids talk in sing-songy English accents, giving the false
impression that everything is fine.</P>
<P>The one nuisance is director/screenwriter/composer Alejandro Amenábar's
pacing.  Amenábar (directing his first English language feature) spends
so much time establishing mood and religious symbolism that the movie
simmers, instead of boils.  There are very few chills until the finale. 
However, the ending still falls a bit flat because it's so much livelier
than the material before it.</P>
<P>Writing this review, I'm reminded of when I first saw The Blair Witch
Project two years ago.  I loved the idea, but I left the theater feeling
a little disappointed.  It just wasn't scary enough.  I feel the same
way about The Others.  The film geek inside of me is satisfied, but the
Scaredy Cat in me isn't.</P>
