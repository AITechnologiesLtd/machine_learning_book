<PRE>THE HOUSE OF YES
Rating: *** (out of four)
R, 1997
Director/Screenplay: Mark Waters
Starring Cast: Parker Posey, Josh Hamilton, Tori Spelling</PRE>
<P>THE HOUSE OF YES is a vicious but hilarious black-comic satire of the
American upper class, introducing us to a bizarre family whose isolation
and obsession with the Kennedys has led to murder and an incestuous
brother-sister relationship (the two of them seem to flirt by re-enacting
JFK's death, complete with ketchup and macaroni to simulate blood and
brains). Their snobbery and detachment is revealed by the appearance of
Leslie (Tori Spelling), the fiancée of the elder son in the family, who is
ridiculed by the daughter for being from Pennsylvania. All of this is
pretty absurd, but the dialogue, adapted by Mark Waters from a play by
Wendy MacLeod, is clever enough to disturb the audience and make them laugh
at the same time. Make no mistake about it: THE HOUSE OF YES is
cold-hearted, mean-spirited, and perverse. But as someone who normally
despises all three of those qualities in a film, I found myself curiously
entertained by all this.</P>
