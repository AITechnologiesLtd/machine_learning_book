<P>     It's curious how one of the most inventive made-for-cable TV series 
(HBO's TALES FROM THE CRYPT) could turn into one of the most toothless 
movie series to haunt multiplexes.  BORDELLO OF BLOOD is the second 
TALES FROM THE CRYPT feature, following in the dismal wake left by 
1995's DEMON KNIGHT, one of that year's worst pictures.  At least this 
followup keeps to the basic sprit of the program that spawned it.  
BORDELLO OF BLOOD is a macabre, jokey affair that could give BUFFY THE 
VAMPIRE SLAYER a run for its money as the silliest undead story of the 
decade.</P>
<P>     Comic Dennis Miller is on hand as Rafe Guttman, the hero of the 
piece.  Miller, who got bumped off early in THE NET, stays around much 
longer here, which is fortunate, since his wisecracking is BORDELLO OF 
BLOOD's most obvious asset.  Miller makes this movie; without him, I 
would be fishing for nice things to say.  Several of his one-liners are 
legitimately funny, and the offhand manner in which he confronts the 
vampires is worth at least a smile.  His supporting cast includes model-
turned-supposed-actresses Erika Eleniak (UNDER SIEGE) and Angie Everhart 
(JADE).  Chris Sarandon plays a rather dull televangelist.  The film 
makes a lot of jokes at the expense of the religious right, but, 
considering that it's such an easy target, the humor seems recycled.</P>
<P>     Frankly, there isn't much of a plot.  The exposition exists for 
three purposes:  to gather a lot of half-naked women together, to 
display as much gore as can be crammed into ninety minutes (actually, 
FROM DUSK TILL DAWN's total probably tops BORDELLO OF BLOOD's), and to 
give Miller an arena for his verbal ripostes.  The whole thing works in 
a campy sort of way, but this movie definitely should not be confused 
with "good" cinema.  Just because it's bad, though, doesn't mean that it 
can't have a certain entertainment value.  Presumably, that's exactly 
what the film makers intended.</P>
<P>     Angie Everhart plays Lilith, the most evil creature in the history 
of mankind.  She runs a bordello out of a mortuary.  Men go in, but they 
don't come out -- at least not in one piece.  All of Lilith's ladies of 
the night have strange puncture marks in their necks, although none of 
their male clients seem to notice.  They are, I presume, too worked up 
by Lilith's unique method of French kissing.  It's a heartfelt sort of 
activity.</P>
<P>     Anyway, one night, a couple of grungy teenagers out looking for a 
good time wander into Lilith's lair.  When one of them fails to come 
home, his sister, Katherine (Erika Eleniak), employs a down-and-out PI, 
Rafe Guttman, to locate him (note: in movies like this, private 
investigators always have to be "down-and-out").  Rafe pays a visit to 
the bordello, and, after getting away from an overeager, topless 
dominatrix vampiress, he decides that something unusual is going on.  A 
leap of intuition reveals the truth, and Rafe returns to the bordello, 
armed with holy water pistols.</P>
<P>     I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I liked parts of BORDELLO OF 
BLOOD -- it is, after all, a pretty sick motion picture.  Alas, the 
sense of bloody good fun gets stretched too thin.  There's not enough 
material here to sustain the running length, and the film goes through 
dead patches (most of which occur when Miller isn't on screen).  All of 
the stuff with Chris Sarandon is a waste of time that should have been 
relegated to the cutting room floor -- except that would have trimmed 
BORDELLO OF BLOOD to an unacceptably short sixty minutes or so.  </P>
<P>     So, although this movie is an improvement over the dreadful DEMON 
KNIGHT (then again, almost anything would be), it still hasn't convinced 
me that TALES OF THE CRYPT belongs on the big screen.  As for the film's 
commercial potential, I'm afraid it hasn't got much.  At best, much like 
BUFFY, it will attain cult status.  More likely, however, it will vanish 
into theatrical oblivion, only to be resurrected in a few months on 
video store shelves, where the promise of naked female flesh and copious 
gore will generate a healthy rental life.  Such is, after all, the 
deserved fate of movies like this.</P>
