THE ASPHALT JUNGLE
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>There are plenty of people in contemporary America who claim
that the wave of school shootings and similar violent
incidents should be blamed on movies, TV, computer games and
other media that allegedly instigate violent tendencies and
other forms of social pathology among the young audience.
Such notions might be true and false, but they weren't very
original. Many decades ago, long before TV and Internet,
there were scholars who used to study the influence of films
and popular culture on the formation of criminal
personalities. One of them was the author of a Criminology
textbook I read many years ago. He thought that the movies
indeed could instigate criminal behaviour and he named one
anecdote as an example. Two young boys robbed the jewellery
store and went into the life of crime after watching of THE
ASPHALT JUNGLE, 1950 caper drama by John Huston. I find this
anecdote very unbelievable, because the film happens to be
one of the classics of film noire, and an undisputed mother
of all "criminal enterprise going bad" movies.</P>
<P>The plot, based on the novel by W.R. Burnett, is set in the
unnamed big city somewhere in American Mid West and follows
a group of different people engaged in various criminal
activities. "Doc" Riedenschneider (played by Sam Jaffe) is a
criminal who became a underworld legend because of his
methodically planned heists. After being released from
prison, he wants to put one of his old plans - robbery of
jewellery store - into action, but he needs personnel and
someone to finance the operation. After being approached by
Alonzo P. Emmerich (played by Louis Calhern), a lawyer with
criminal connections, "Doc" begins assembling his crew. The
safecracker is Louis Ciavelli (played by Anthony Caruso),
who accepts the job because he wants to feed his family. The
"muscleman" is Dix Handley (played by Sterling Hayden),
violent street mugger who wants to pay his gambling debts,
and the getaway driver is Gus Minissi (played by James
Whitmore), hunchback and Dix's only friend. The heist,
although methodically executed, goes bad, and in the end,
the criminals themselves are in danger of being robbed.
Emmerich entered into this business because he was flat
broke and he wants to steal the loot for himself.</P>
<P>THE ASPHALT JUNGLE should be distinguished from many other
film noires because of the treatment it gives to the crime
and criminal underworld. Unlike many films with the same
subject that treat criminals like utter villains, this film,
scripted by Huston and Ben Madow, goes to the great lengths
in order to explore such characters and their ulterior
motivations. As a result, THE ASPHALT JUNGLE is a one of
more realistic films of such genre. Criminals are portrayed
as people not very different from "normal", law-abiding
citizens; they share the same hopes, dreams and fear like
the rest of us, but, most importantly, they all have very
human and understandable flaws. And those flaws, and not
their inherent evilness, are responsible for the wrong
choices that would lead them to the life of crime. Huston
condemns those choices and shows the comeuppance his
characters would get, but he still feels the need to show
some sympathy and even pity for them.</P>
<P>Those characters are probably the most important element of
the film, and Huston was very lucky to have a great acting
talent at his disposal when he made this film. Each of them
was almost perfect for the role, always revealing the fatal
flaw of their characters in subtle, but effective details.
Sterling Hayden is great as a street hooligan who wants to
leave the filthy city streets for the clean, open air of
rural home. James Whitmore's getaway driver went into the
life of crime because of his physical deformation. Louis
Cahern plays probably the best role of his career -the aura
of cultivated, self-confident and respected legal
professional, used during contacts with his criminal clients
and associates, is just a mask under which he hides the real
character of womanising weakling. It was a real spectacle to
see how Cahern gradually removes this mask as the movie
approaches its conclusion. But, even such utterly crooked
and pathetic individual is worthy of pity since he showed
some conscience towards his old, sick wife. Probably the
best character is the one who is most enigmatic of them all
- Sam Jaffe plays a criminal mastermind who gives a positive
reference to the expression "professional criminal". His
Riedenschneider is a model of utterly business- like,
emotionless, intelligent yet very charming criminal; his
professionalism , disdain towards violence, temperance and
even gentleman's manners makes us wonder why did such
character chose the life of crime in the first place; the
answer is very discreetly hinted in one of the last scenes
of the film. The other actors are also good, like Jean Hagen
in the role of Dix's trusted girlfriend. Marylin Monroe, on
the other hand, is very good as Emmerich's bimbo mistress,
but, that role, being her first big break in Hollywood,
haunted her later career in Hollywood with its stereotypes.</P>
<P>Huston as director is in his prime, utilising the script and
the acting talent to their fullest. The pacing of the film
is superb, plot moves very quickly despite the lack of
action. The dark, urban scenery and almost exclusive use of
interiors is also very effective in creating the atmosphere
of depression, anxiety and final doom that waits its
protagonists. Probably the only flaw of the film, and very
minor and debatable flaw, is the presence of Police
Commissioner Hardy (played by John McIntire), character
whose moral virtue and crime-fighting determination looks
somewhat artificial and put in this film only to counter-act
for early 50s rather bold motive of police corruption. But,
even such one-dimensional character is played by good actor
and his lines stick long in the memory (although they look
more appropriate for Sidney Lumet's dramas about moral
ambiguities of law enforcement). Perhaps only a small step
away from perfection, THE ASPHALT JUNGLE is one of the best
films ever made, and its greatness could be witnessed by the
fact that many films in last half a century were inspired by
it, but very few came even close to its quality.</P>
