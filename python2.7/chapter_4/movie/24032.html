<P>The astute title "High Fidelity" has many meanings. The music is 
pre-hip hop or rap. The characters entranced by vinyl albums (when 
not critical of them) are Generation Xers who cult-ivate (sic) the 
sounds of their adolescence. It's fitting, because they are in a 
state of suspended youth even though the age of the 
principals-on-screen is about the same as the age of the 
principals-in-life. John Cusack was born in 1966, Jack Black in 1969, 
etc.</P>
<P>Rob (Cusack) owns and vaguely runs Championship Vinyl, a store of 
used records on a Chicago street that gets little pedestrian traffic. 
He has two employees. They were hired for three days a week but are 
there all the time,which tells you something about their passion for 
certain kinds of music and their nonexistent private life or other 
interests. The store looks well-stocked with records but is woefully 
un-stocked with customers. How it and its three people survive, how 
the stuff is bought, how rent, taxes or utilities are paid is a 
mystery. But the movie, like its characters, is above such mundane 
considerations.</P>
<P>It is, however, an excellent filmization of a popular book, and a 
seamlessly credible transposition to Chicago of the original novel's 
setting in London. Many, often lengthy passages of the book's text 
are quoted. The trick is to have Rob address directly the audience. 
No stinting here.</P>
<P>What gets the whole thing going is that Rob's longtime live-in 
girlfriend Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle) suddenly fed up with 
his messiness, immaturity, lingering childishness and other such 
characteristics, walks out on him.</P>
<P>The store's male trio are music-on-vinyl geeks. "Geeks" falls on some 
people's ears with a negative connotation. But then some geeks can be 
endearing. They may be living in a strange world of their own, but at 
least they have a passion for something, be this computers, toy 
trains, stamp collecting, dancing... the list is endless. The three 
men's musical knowledge is encyclopedic. Rejoice, geeks in the 
audience! You can hear some 60 songs, though mostly in excerpts.</P>
<P>The Championship Three are idiosyncratic. Bulky Barry combines a 
haughty attitude of Papal infallibility in pop music matters,with 
rude intolerance for tastes he does not share. Fragile, mumbling, 
timid, bald-pated Dick is a masculine wallflower. Moody Rob seems to 
be in a semi-trance-like state which melds indifference,worries, 
whining and self-irony. The trio, especially the two helpers, judge 
people by their musical tastes. It's like "tell me what you like and 
I'll tell who you are and if I'll like you" -- a valid criterion in 
many situations.</P>
<P>What all those men share is the mania for making lists of the top 
five albums in categories that range from life, love and death to 
abstruse topics.
Laura's departure triggers in Rob a flood of self-centered questions. 
His thoughts in the book become in the movie direct addresses to the 
audience. And the listomania makes him create his own top five worst 
breakups with the women in his life. Supplemented by voice-overs, his 
speeches are a messy mass of analyses, self-pity, puzzlements, alibis 
but also self-criticisms in which he does not spare himself. All are 
beautifully done, amusing rather than pathetic, indeed often 
hilarious. They alternate between lucidity, myopia, good and bad 
faith, and are illustrated by compact, colorful flasbacks of his 
romances, from his teens onwards.</P>
<P>Rob's tales of his amorous discomfitures are briefly interrupted by a 
one-night stand with singer Lisa Bonet. It does not light the man's 
lantern of self-knowledge but he does gain confidence. In 
entertaining sequences he  visits old flames who tell him (I forget 
if it is in some cases or all) that he was the one who broke up the 
affairs. This is followed by a temporarily renewed relationship with 
one ex, a recently jilted neurotic.</P>
<P>What Rob wants most is Laura's return. She has moved in with a New 
Age legal guru (Tim Robbins) who specializes in resolving conflicts. 
This adds to the film's ironies, as Rob is trying to resolve his own 
conflicts. His talking to the viewers is a form of "I am my own 
shrink," but then, self-surgery is no easy process.</P>
<P>I cannot divulge what happens next, but one does suspect that there 
is no   true closure since Rob is not a leopard that can change his 
spots. It does not take reading between the lines either to realize 
that by higher standards, none of Rob's girls was interesting enough, 
and neither was Rob. He deserved whatever he got. Laura however is a 
cut above the rest and gets more vignettes than the others.</P>
<P>The movie rests overwhelmingly on Cusack's shoulders, even though 
Todd Louiso's and Jack Black's very well played weirdoes, bring fresh 
comic relief. It is more than a film with Cusack, it 's a Cusack 
film, with  It has the same genuinely maverick, 
absurdist-realistic-humorous ambiance as the previous all-Cusack 
"Grosse Pointe Blank."  Of the four scenarists of each movie, three 
are the same in both. In those pictures,as well as in others, a 
variety of Cusack personae emerge, often different from one another 
yet with a base of effortless likeability that makes the low-key 
actor stand out. He stays with you the way  high-key Jack Nicholson 
or Dustin Hoffman do --and far more than most performers of Cusack's 
age group.</P>
<P>The breaking of the Fourth Wall (Cusack's direct speeches to us) is 
handled with convincing efficiency. The device can be dangerous, 
precious or annoyingly artificial. It worked well with Michael Caine 
in "Alfie" (1966) which for many people was the first movie to use 
this approach. But it already existed, as in olden days, funny 
movie-shorts, especially Robert Benchley's "lectures." In Jean-Luc 
Godard's innovative  "Breathless" (1959)   actor Belmondo very 
briefly speaks directly to us, and so on.</P>
<P>This brings me to my wondering whether or not there are Godardian 
influences here. The Frenchman's films overflow with questions spoken 
by their characters. Ultimately we get Godard himself thinking aloud. 
There are other whiffs of Godard, especially Rob's early "Did I 
listen to pop music because I was miserable, or was I miserable 
because I listened to pop music?" This very pattern abounds in 
Godard's paradoxes.</P>
<P>The movie is, after "The Grifters" (USA, 1990), Cusack's  second 
collaboration with British director Stephen Frears. Frears knows how 
to bring characters to life, how not to mess up scripts or interfere 
with his actors' talents. In England, his first dozen pictures and 
several later ones  were TV productions moved rapidly to theaters. 
This no doubt played a major role in Frears's sense of economy of 
budget, story-telling and construction. Subsequent titles  include 
"The Hit,' "My Beautiful Laundrette," "Sammy and Rosie Get Laid,""The 
Snapper," and in the U.S "Dangerous Liaisons," "Hero."</P>
<P>"High Fidelity" proves that Cusack and Frears were made for each 
other. More, more!</P>
