<P>I feel no hesitation in saying that "There's Something About Mary" is the
best film that I will see all year. From the moment the credits started to
roll at the end of the picture, there was no doubt in my mind that I had
seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of
1998. It is that good of a film. </P>
<P>When Gene Siskel said this about "Fargo" only a few months into '96, I
dismissed the notion as ridiculous. How could you possibly know that a film
is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat
it? But after seeing the Farrelly's hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt
masterwork, I now know what Siskel was talking about. Once in a (very
great) while, a film comes along that is so daring, so brilliant and simply
so enjoyable that at the end, you just want to stand up and cheer. And you
know, at that instant, that you have just experienced something very
special. </P>
<P>Now for the shocker; "Mary" is the grossest and most disgusting film I have
ever viewed ("Pink Flamingos" obviously notwithstanding). The movie is so
rude and, I guess, inappropriate in nature that I had a hard time sitting
in a theater watching it with my parents (luckily I had seen it before
them, so I could warn the about what they were in for). Forget "Blazing
Saddles", "Animal House" and even the former king of gross-out comedy,
"Monty Python's Meaning of Life"; they were all only preludes to the
Farrelly's assault on the senses. </P>
<P>In fact, this may even be the funniest film I've ever had the pleasure of
seeing (the only real contender is "Monty Python and the Holy Grail"), and
most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade. </P>
<P>But as funny as it is, something also has to be said about the overall
sweetness of "Mary"; it has a huge heart. You see, the Farrelly's are truly
gifted filmmakers. They don't just present you with a string of dick and
fart jokes (although there are plenty to go around). They also, very
wisely, add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and
actually have them develop as the story progresses. </P>
<P>It's funny, though. If you just look at an outline of the story, it seems
kind of contrived and predictable. But believe me, it is anything but. Ben
Stiller plays Ted, a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the
school babe, Mary (Cameron Diaz). After he sticks up for her retarded
brother, Warren (W. Early Brown - the cameraman, believe it or not, from
"Scream"), his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom. In one of
the film's funniest scenes, something goes wrong (I won't ruin it for those
who know nothing about the film) and Ted is unable to face Mary ever again.</P>
<P>Jump to the present. After years of self-loathing, Ted finally hires
private detective Pat Healy (a suitably slimy Matt Dillon) to track her
down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since
high school. Healy finds that Mary is still a full-blown hottie and decides
to try and keep her for himself. </P>
<P>Admittingly, the basic story line leaves a little to be desired. After all,
with a not-really-all-that-funny premise, how can you sustain laughter for
nearly two hours? Somehow, the Farrelly's pull it off. </P>
<P>The performances here are also right on target. As Ted, Stiller adds just
the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating, as
he would normally be, but very lovable. And Cameron Diaz is perfect in her
role for obvious reasons, but the actor who really grabs your attention is
W. Earl Brown as Mary's brother. No other actor has even come close to
playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as Brown displays
here. I know he won't be nominated, but this is the guy who should not be
counted out when it comes time to hand out the Oscar nods in February. As
good as the actors are, though, it's the directors' movie all the way. </P>
<P>I guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year,
you will see the number one space occupied by Steven Spielberg's WWII epic
"Saving Private Ryan". And yes, that is a great film worthy of the
recognition it has been getting. But which is harder; making a great war
film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can't breath for
minutes at a time? I'll let you decide that one for yourself, but this
critic is sticking to his guns. There is just something about "Mary". </P>
