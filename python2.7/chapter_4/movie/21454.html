<P>I loved "The Red Violin" so much, I was sure that another flick that was
more specifically about violins, would be good; especially with two of my
favorite actresses--Meryl Streep and Angela Bassett--in it.  Was I right,
or, in the vein of "Dangerous Minds", et al, would this be Yet Another
flick where the White Savior Rescues The Poor Ghetto Chulllldrin?</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: some spoilers contained below):
"Music Of The Heart" is the true story of Roberta Guaspari (Streep), a
violinist and former Navy Wife freshly divorced from her philandering
ex-husband (his choice), who is pressed to find a job.  Having moved
around in the Navy so much, she doesn't have a lot of prospects in her
suburban environment, where she lives with her mother (Leachman) and sons
Nick (Angarano at 7-years-old; Hofheimer at 17-years-old) and Lexi
(Dinhofer at 5-years-old; Culkin at 15-years-old), until Brian Sinclair
(Quinn), tells her about a teaching job that may be available--in East
Harlem.  Principal Janet Williams (Bassett) is skeptical at first, but
soon she is convinced to let her work as an elementary school substitute
music teacher in her school, where Roberta meets Isabel Vasquez (Estefan),
an assorted batch of students, and later, Dorothea Van Hauften (Leeves),
who may be able to open doors for Roberta and her violin students as time
goes on.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Remember the old Mickey Rooney movies where, when the gang needs to raise
funds for a project, they just "put on a show!"?  1990's, meet the 40s.</P>
<P>I'll be frank: most of the backstory of this movie was kinda dull; I can't
say that I cared much about Roberta's story as it pertained to her
husband, or her kids, or her mother, or even the strange relationship with
Brian (and boy, did Quinn look weird; haven't seen him in a lonnnng
time).  Even the normally-strong Streep, nor the equally powerful Bassett,
couldn't quite pull the first half of this movie out of the doldrums; and
though Estefan was refreshingly natural in her big screen non-music debut,
she wasn't really all that integral to this flick, and didn't really make
a dent in the snooze factor of the first half.  The young actors (whose
names I didn't catch, so I won't bungle them here) made it worth watching,
but it was a task otherwise.</P>
<P>But skip down to the end of this review, and you'll note I gave it the
greenlight.  Why's that?  Three reasons: the story picked up the pace in
the second half (and the final scenes, which I'm desperately trying not to
give away--but it ain't Rocket Science, folks--were worth the wait.); Wes
Craven, predominately known for his "Freddie Kruger" slasher flicks,
played a soft hand here, only giving in to his horror-flick trickery once
(hard to describe, but there's a scene in the school where there's
movement in the background behind Roberta, and the camera zooms in on her,
that made me wonder if some demented demon in gory makeup would come up
from behind her); and most importantly, the kids were allowed to be
genuine elementary-age kids, not ruffneck hooligans from da hood, read'ta
buss' up a be'ouch, nor insufferably cute Projects projects, waiting for
Missy Roberta to deliver them up from out of bondage.</P>
<P>[WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD] And I have to give this away, sorry: there was a
beautiful moment where Roberta and the students play a song that, as I
mentioned in my "Crazy In Alabama" review, I have come to despise for the
trivial way it's treated: "We Shall Overcome".  But this treatment
honestly left me in tears, due to its sincere beauty.  Only children, I
believe, could've pulled that off; I applaud them heartily for it. [END
SPOILER]</P>
<P>Aside from Wes Craven's soft side, as well as the low-cutesiness quotient
of the students as well as Roberta's kids, there were no real surprises in
this one; the usual tour-de-force that is Meryl Streep, was more subdued
(though I loved the way she handled the kids, with a strong hand), and
Angela Bassett seemed almost an afterthought.  But not every movie needs
to be The! Next! Big! Thing!, after all; "Music Of The Heart" ends as a
Feel Good movie that left me feeling good--and that's just what the doctor
ordered.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]
    As a Black woman, I see the "Black Factor"--things that affect me as a 
    "consumer of color"--in many aspects of life; movies included. Whether 
    from the standpoint of noting Black (and other "minority") cast and crew
    members (if any), to the (lack of) focus toward "people of color" (dag, I
    hate that term), to the out-and-out antagonistic attitude toward Us 
    (Jar-Jar, anyone?), the "Black Factor" (BF) is something that plays as 
    much a role in my film enjoyment as any other aspect of the movie itself.</P>
<P>"Black people don't play the violin."
If you've ever said, or thought, something like that, try to imagine what
it's like hearing it directed at you, violin-in-hand.  And imagine it
coming from a Black person.  Stupid, right?  And unfortunately, all too
common (substitute "skydive" or "go hanggliding"--or any number of
pleasures of which I partake--for "play the violin", and you Feel me).  We
are, far too often, Our own worst enemies when it comes to having access
to non-traditional, non-monolithic, events and life-choices; We
(rightfully) fight tooth and nail for the ability to gain access to
"common areas", then We deride others of Us who go through doors that
aren't usually painted Black.  So you probably won't be surprised to know
that I took great pleasure in seeing so many Black, and Latino, faces in
Roberta's classes (and there are some additional treats to be had in the
final scenes, but I won't give them away).  Almost made me want to take up
the fiddle.</P>
<P>On that ubiquitous Other Hand...one of the scenes that the TV networks
have been showing in the ObStreep interviews, resonated with me, as it
addresses the very point I made in the beginning of this review: Naim's
mother, a Black woman, pulls him out of Roberta's class, saying that she
would not let her son be treated as an object that needed to be "rescued"
by Roberta.  I was glad that it worked out for all parties concerned in
the end (since this is based on a true story, my assumption is that this
is how the situation really happened--though I just read that the folks at
the school upon this is based, have taken offense at how the school is
portrayed.  But that's another story for another time), but the
character's concern is one that's shared by this reviewer, when it comes
to movies such as this; the assumption is that the parents can't, or
won't, make any effort to try to make a better life for their children,
and therefore need the paternalistic rescue attempts of people who
otherwise have no stake in the neighborhood.  The vibe in this movie is
that the teacher just wanted to open up a window that none of the kids had
opened to them before; the extent to which this has been achieved, should
be able to be seen via the real-life students.  Next time I'm in Nuevo
York, I plan on checking that out first-hand. </P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line 
Wes Craven proves he's good for more than just hack-n-slash; though it
won't burn up any ballots come Oscar time, you could do a lot worse with
your box office bucks [can you say, "Bringing Out The Dead"?]  And there
was even a Public Service Announcement giving the phone number to make
donations for Roberta's group, "Opus 118": 212-831-4455.  Do it...for the
Chulllldrin!</P>
<P>"Music Of The Heart":  (rating: greenlight) 
[Bams succumbs to the pressure]: How do you get to Carnegie Hall?  
Can't hurt if you Know Somebody...</P>
