<PRE>THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, AND HER LOVER (1989)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: Peter Greenaway
Starring: Richard Bohringer, Michael Gambon, Helen Mirren, Alan Howard, Tim
Roth, Liz Smith, Paul Russell, Ciarán Hinds, Gary Olsen, Ewan Stewart, Alex
Kingston</P>
<P>Every night at "Le Hollandais" restaurant, the owner, Albert Spica (Michael
Gambon), shows up with all his friends, and eats all he can, while talking
loudly, and making a general rucous.  Instead of being a dedicated,
peaceful owner, Albert is actually a vile gangster who has recently bought
out the restaurant from its head cook, Richard (Richard Bohringer), who
nevertheless still works there.  Every single evening, Albert annoys
everyone he can, showing off his power and richness, and every single
evening, Richard holds back his disgust at him with a blank expression, and
replies of "Yes, Mr. Spica...right away, Mr. Spica."</P>
<P>But one night, Albert's bored and beautiful wife, Georgina (Helen Mirren),
glances across the restaurant at one of its many customers, Michael (Alan
Howard), and soon the two begin to flirt across the room.  After he
accidentally walks into the women's bathroom where she is, the two begin a
silent affair, lasting over the course of the film as they have passionate,
quiet sex in every nook and cranny of the restaurant...and with the aid of
Richard, who allows them entrance into little hiding places where they can
continue their tryst.</P>
<P>So begins the fable-like story writer/director Peter Greenaway has brought
us.  "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover" is a lavishly directed
film, filled with gorgeous production design, wild costumes, and scenes of
such depravity and disgustingness that even John Waters would be shocked. 
It's a film which has the balls to do a scene where Albert beats a broke
man who owes him money by stuffing shit down his mouth, and the
intelligence to back it up with a purpose.</P>
<P>For the first hour, the film gets into a kind of routine: Albert and his
goons (including one played by a pre-"Reservoir Dogs" Tim Roth) arrive, eat
while talking annoyingly, and somewhere in there, both Georgina and Michael
get up simultaneoulsy from their respective tables, and head into a hiding
place to screw around, with some variation in there.  But the second hour,
as with most films which get into routines in the first hour, changes
everything.  After Albert finds out about them from one of the goon's
mistresses, the two lovers flee to his place, a book depository where he
works, and after awhile, Albert finds him, and brutally kills him.</P>
<P>I will not reveal the ending, primarily because it's such a great ending,
truly one of the greatest endings to a film I've ever seen.  But I will say
this: it's definitely delicious (hee hee), and it's bound to have the
audience leaving with a big smile in their face...unless they're completely
grossed out.</P>
<P>There are hundreds of great things about this film, but sone of them are
the direction by Peter Greenaway, and production design by Ben Van Os and
Jan Roelfs, music by Michael Nymann, and costumes by the god-like Jean-Paul
Gaultier, all which contribute into a film which is one of the most
visually stunning films I've ever seen.  The film is incredibly lavish, and
the restaurant, where most of the film takes place, is one of the most
incredible sights on celluloid.  Outside, there is blue fog and lime
lights; in the kitchen, the color is green, and seems to be a giant
warehouse, with a pan shot of it lasting forever; the actual dining room is
an ominous crimson red (which gets more crimson as the film goes on); and
the bathroom is bright white, so white that when the door opens from the
inside, it looks like hell is creeping in.  This is probably the most
gorgeous-looking film in the past decade.</P>
<P>Not only that, but every primary actor deserves individual praise.  Richard
Bohringer, a staple of French cinema, is perfect at portraying a man who
hides his emotions and hatred for Albert under a plastic facade, creating
the perfect look of a pot ready to boil over.  Michael Gambon is perfect as
the obese, horrific Albert, being able to pronouce every line of his
dialogue realistically and with style.  Helen Mirren portrays the bored
Georgina as a woman who's been hollowed out by her marriage to Albert, and
later shows a touching emotion when she finds out she's really in love with
Michael (one scene has her talking to him when he's not there - I almost
cried).  And Alan Howard, who doesn't even speak until about 50 minutes
into the film, is wonderful, playing a man who hints at everything with
facial expressions, and is the exact opposite of Albert.  Tim Roth, in a
supporting role, is pretty awesome too.</P>
<P>I've read that this film is a film about the connection between food and
sex.  I've also read that it's nothing but a wild tale, not really
deserving of the title of "art."  These are both wrong in their own
respects.  "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover" is actually a
condemnation of gluttony, not so much as in respect to eating, but in
respect to all kinds of excessiveness.  The film is not a contemporary
"Last Tango in Paris," showing a pair of lovers trying to escape through
casual sex.  It's not even really about the affair of Georgina and Michael.
 It's about Albert, a man who's so polluted to the core that he's blind to
his own selfishness and worldly gluttony. </P>
<P>Albert struts around his restaurant like a king, messing around with people
who are merely trying to eat good food, and talks about changing Richard's
restaurant into a place filled with every excess imaginable.  Not to
mention, he rants on about every subject imaginable, making crude jokes at
others' expenses, and generally speaking way too much on things he knows
little or nothing about.  In fact, Albert has most of the lines in the film
(notice how the film sometimes cuts to other people and places when he
speaks?). Greenaway is trying to point out that this kind of excessiveness
is pure evil, and that anyone who acts remotely like this deserves the
sweet justice he receives, like Albert does in the finale (no specifics, I
promise).  While the stories of the other three protagonists are emotional
and intriguing in their own respects, they are merely acting out as people
who have been harmed by Albert's selfish gluttony.</P>
<P>What puts the cherry on the top of this film is the way the film feels
during and after viewing it.  "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her
Lover" is a film that lingers in the memory long after, with scenes and
moments stuck in your head.  I will never forget the look of the
restuarant, the way it's so vast and always filled with life.  I can never
get the images of Georgina and Michael making love without talking, and the
love they share for eachother in the second half after the silence has been
broken between them.  And the ending is so incredible that it will hold up
to any film where a character gets his just desserts as a perfect example
of how to do it right and proper.</P>
<P>"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover" is a film I will never get
over seeing.  It may be disgusting, vile, and even excessive, but it's a
film that will haunt you and never let you forget its message and wild
imagery.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
