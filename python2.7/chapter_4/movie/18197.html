<P>_Three_Seasons_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>For the most part, Tony Bui's gorgeous Sundance favorite is a fascinating
look at life in modern-day Vietnam, seen through the eyes of a number of
characters leading different lives in and around Ho Chi Minh City: a young
woman (Nguyen Ngoc Hiep) who strikes up an unlikely friendship with the
old, ailing owner (Tran Manh Cuong) of the lotus farm at which she works; a
cyclo driver (Don Duong) who falls for a prostitute (Zoe Bui); and a very
young street vendor (Nguyen Huu Duoc) whose case of merchandise is stolen.  </P>
<P>If only Bui and co-writer Timothy Linh Bui had left it at that: three
storylines to match the three seasons of the title.  But in a blatant
concession to the film's Western production roots, also added to the mix is
an unnecessary storyline about a GI (Harvey Keitel) who is searching for
the daughter he left behind.  Although this thread briefly intersects with
the others (as they all do), it could not be more far removed in terms of
style, mood, and execution; while the other stories feel true to life, this
one feels like manufactured melodrama, and it is rather stiffly acted by
Keitel (with the exception of one emotional wordless scene).  Thankfully,
though, his storyline is given the least amount of screen time, never
becoming so obtrusive as to dilute the simple power of the other plots or
the uniting poetry of Lisa Rinzler's breathtaking cinematography.</P>
