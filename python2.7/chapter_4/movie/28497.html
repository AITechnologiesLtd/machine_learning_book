<PRE>DR. DOLITTLE 2
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Sequels just never measure up to their predecessors.  Every now and then
it happens -- a la Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, The Empire Strikes
Back, and The Rescuers Down Under -- but those are the exceptions. </P>
<P>The original Eddie Murphy comedy Dr. Dolitte was a lukewarm and tepid
yet entertaining movie filled with cheap laughs, terrible acting, and a
painful reminder of Murphy's slow decent into another slump.  But alas,
the studio gods spoke and a sequel became unavoidable when the original
Dr. Dolittle (er, the original Eddie Murphy Dolittle, itself being a
remake) grossed over $290 million dollars worldwide -- not including
sales from the hip-hop soundtrack.</P>
<P>Well, Murphy has lost the nappy deadlocks of the first film and again
takes on the role of the intrepid animal doctor/interpreter Dr. Dolittle
in Dr. Dolittle 2.  This time around, Dolittle has honed his
communication skills and runs a joint animal and human medical office in
beautiful San Francisco.  Over the past few years, Dolittle has become
the Sigmund Freud of the animal kingdom -- providing sexual advice to a
turtle with erectile dysfunction, overseeing support groups for stray
dogs, and guest-starring on Crocodile Hunter.</P>
<P>One night, a raccoon with a thick Brooklyn accent shows up at his door
and requests that the Doc meet with The Beaver -- the head of some type
of animal Mafia in the Marin County forests.  The Beaver requests that
the Doc stop a evil logging company -- controlled by Jeffery Jones and
Kevin Pollack -- from clear-cutting the homes of all of the forest
dwellers.  The only way to save the forest lies in the loins of an
endangered species of bear named Archie (voiced by Steve Zahn), whom the
Doc has to retrain in how to live in the wild so he can mate with
another bear named Ava (voiced by Lisa Kudrow).  If Archie and Ava do
the mystery dance and produce little Archies and Avas, the forest would
then be deemed off-limits from the clutches of evil logging company. 
The only problem is that Archie is a circus bear who best knows how to
dance to disco and has the demeanor of Woody Allen -- Wayne Newton in a
bear suit.  So its up to the Doc to teach Archie how to be the alpha
male of the wild, save the forest from the overacting of Kevin Pollack,
learn how to communicate with his own human family, and somehow make us
believe that a talking monkey has a drinking problem.</P>
<P>Dr. Dolittle 2 could've been a contender.  In a decade of film - Nutty
Professor II, Bowfinger, Life, Holy Man, Metro, A Vampire in Brooklyn,
Beverly Hills Cop III, and Boomerang -- Murphy has done little worth
remembering.  But in Dr. Dolittle 2, Murphy gives one of his better
performances in recent years.  He seems looser, more interested in the
role, and gives fleeting glimpses of that energetic and sharp humor that
made him so famous in the '80s.  Still, he seems reserved and unsure
about how to work in this brave new world of family films and wholesome
entertainment.</P>
<P>The voice talent is where the gold lies.  Steve Zahn's dry wit and
apathy give Archie the Bear the comedic edge it needs to compliment the
excellent training of the animal (coupled with his CGI manipulation). 
Norm Macdonald returns in his role of the wisecracking family dog Lucky
and provides added humor.  The various voice talents of Cedric the
Entertainer, Michael Rappaport, Kudrow, and Molly Shannon are witty but
don't draw attention away from the amazing animatronics of the talking
animals.</P>
<P>But Dolittle 2 suffers from a serious identity crisis and, like the
original, never really sells the humanization of its animal characters. 
Worse still, the film constantly veers among being a Hallmark special,
an environmentalist call to arms, a cheap rip-off of a Farrelly brothers
comedy complete with fart and poop jokes, and a family film about cute
animals and important messages like "being yourself and never
compromising your dreams."</P>
<P>Even with its flaws, Dr. Dolittle 2 is a decent matinee movie for the
kiddies.  The film also provides enough humor for those grown-ups in the
audience brave enough to sit through 90 plus minutes of endless product
placements, Eddie Murphy playing Dean Martin to the Jerry Lewis antics
of a talking bear, and the bear singing "I Will Survive."  [For a very
special treat try watching Max karaoke "I Will Survive." -Ed.]</P>
<PRE>Let's just call that a warning.</PRE>
