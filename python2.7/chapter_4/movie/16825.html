<PRE> Antz migrates out.</PRE>
<P> Its a stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated, yet trys a
bit too hard.</P>
<P> With the voices of Woody Allen, Gene Hackman, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester
Stallone, and Sharon Stone, this computer-animated yak-fest (think Toy Story
[1996] filled with used merchandising) is one for the ant-eaters.</P>
<P> The main story is the independence of a worker named Z (Allen).  He wants more
to life than just digging away underground for the colony.  When he finds out
about ``Insectopia," a mythical place where all insects can run free, Z, along
with his colony's princess (Stone), journey out into the world to find a
meaning for life.</P>
<P> About 15 minutes into the picture, I began to wonder what the point of the
film was.  Halfway through, I still didn't have an answer.</P>
<PRE> By the end credits, I just gave up and ran out.</PRE>
<P> Antz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice-overs.  Allen is
nonchalant, while I would have guessed, if I hadn't seen her in The Mighty and
Basic Instinct, Stone can't act, even in a cartoon.</P>
<P> This film is one for the bugs: unfunny and extremely dull.</P>
<P> Hey, A Bug's Life may have a good time doing Antz in.</P>
