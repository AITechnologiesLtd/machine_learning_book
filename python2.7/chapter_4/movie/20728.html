<PRE>Analyze This</PRE>
<P>Starring Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal and Lisa Kudrow
Directed By Harold Ramis
Running Time: 1 hour 43 minutes</P>
<PRE>(Warner Brothers)</PRE>
<P>Although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit HBO
drama 'The Sopranos,' Analyze This is witty and entertaining enough to be a
good movie in it's own right. Billy Crystal plays wiseguy shrink Ben Sobol,
who new 'patient' happens to be gangster boss Paul Vitti (De Niro.) Ben
wants nothing to do with Vitti, as he's about to get married to Laura
MacNamara (Kudrow) and having a gangster as a patient wouldn't really help.
But Ben is soon drawn into Vitti worlds, and reluctantly helps Vitti to sort
his life out. All done in a comic fashion, of course.</P>
<P>Although never brilliant, Analyze This is also never rubbish, which makes
for a fun ride. Billy Crystal, who hasn't had a good role since City
Slickers way back in the early '90's, is given a role that lets him fully
exploit his wiseguy act. He's pretty funny while he does it, and although
his character is a little close to his character in City Slickers, he's
pretty funny. Robert De Niro is hilarious as Vitti, playing it dead straight
but coming off as really funny. He's a serious gangster unaware that he is a
comic gold mine. Lisa Kudrow, barely seen as Crystals' estranged wife to be,
basically reprises her Phoebe role from T.V series Friends, which is getting
rather tiresome, and doesn't come off well on the screen. The supporting
cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of Casino and Goodfellas, and
are all funny caricatures, especially Vitti's bodyguard Jelly (Joe
Viterelli.)</P>
<P>The film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie, but with laughs
instead of hard ass talking. It sometimes gets a little bloody for a light
hearted film, but it strangely fits in. Spoofs are made of famous gangster
movies, including a nice parody of The Godfather. The Italian tunes playing
throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun. There's also some odd plot
points: FBI guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason. It is
true that Analyze This has had a somewhat chequered production history, and
perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script.
Unfortunately, this is Hollywood, so we will never know.</P>
<P>Harold Ramis, best known as Egon from Ghostbusters, has a deft touch with
directing comedy, as shown in the immortal Groundhog Day, and the less
immortal Caddyshack. All the comic potential in a scene is dug out and
presented to the audience. The script, written by Ramis along with Peter
Tolan and Ken Lonergan, starts off funny, remains funny for the most of the
film, but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it
wrongly enters more serious territory. The film is short, however, and just
before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather
rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll.</P>
<P>Analyze This is a good comedy, and is certainly worth watching. Robert De
Niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it, even though it does seem forced,
or like a parody (although I think this was intentional.) Crystal is his
most likeable in years, Kudrow is given as little screen time as possible,
which is a good thing, and De Niro is just awesome. It's no Goodfellas, and
it probably won't be remembered as much as Groundhog Day, but Analyze This
is a well done comedy that won't leave you feel cheated.</P>
