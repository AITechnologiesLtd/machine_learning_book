<P>     To begin this review, I must say that I did not want to see this
film.  The romantic-love-heart-ache genre in cinema has grown a bit
outdated in recent years, and basically I've become quite disillusioned
with the whole concept.  But, a funny thing happened while I sat down
to watch UNTAMED HEART--I found myself completely drawn into its world,
and the private lives of its characters.  I was pulled in, held--and as
soon as the lights in the theater were turned on again I felt as if a
part of me had been torn away from me.</P>
<P>     The story is simple:  Two lonely people fall in love.  Sounds just
like every other love story you've ever seen on film.  Where this one
differs, however, is that you really care about these people.  His name
is Adam.  Adam is an odd, reclusive young man who doesn't like to talk
a lot and isn't very good with people.  It seems as though he has
embodied a rather unhealthy heart since birth, and believes the story
about it that a nun told him at the orphanage where he was raised.
Adam has just one wish:  To love and be loved by a pretty young
waitress, with whom he works at an all-night diner in Minneapolis,
named Caroline.  Caroline is on a constant lookout for love, but she's
been dumped more times than she or anyone else can count.  Nobody wants
to be with her... except for Adam.  The only problem is that Caroline
hasn't given Adam much thought.  She thinks he's just plain weird.
Then, one night as she is walking home alone through the park, Caroline
is attacked by two men.  At her rescue is, of course, Adam.  He fights
both men off, and then carries an unconscious Caroline home.  He lays
her down in the swing on her front porch, covers her with his overcoat
and sits on the steps, keeping a constant watch on Caroline while she
sleeps.  She awakens ready to fight, but there's no need; no words are
spoken between her and Adam, and he runs away.</P>
<P>     They later meet at passing in a shopping mall.  He touches her
hand, and that's all.  You see, Caroline doesn't know what to say to
Adam or how to approach him.  She's always thought of him as a strange
part of life that she'd rather not get to know.  Nonetheless, Caroline
gets up the courage one night at work to finally thank Adam ... with a
kiss.  So begins their relationship.</P>
<P>     As I have said, this is a cut above other romance movies--a huge
cut above.  The characters are real people, not cookie-cutter, factory
outlet, assembly line characters.  These characters live on the screen,
and you feel all the time you spend watching this film that you are
intruding on their lives, or listening in.  That is the type realism
most film- makers strive for and fail miserably at capturing.  The per-
formances are absolutely indelible.  Christian Slater has never been
any better than he is here.  In the majority of his prior work, Slater
has pretty much hidden behind some sort of mask-- whether it be Jack
Nicholson, or whatever.  Here, he has nothing to hide behind.  As a
result, his work in this film is touching, endearing, subtly eloquent
and very moving.  This is not just a pretty face anymore; this is the
most competent actor working in film today.</P>
<P>     I'm afraid, however, that all credit for the success of this film
must go to Marisa Tomei.  She makes up the heart and soul of this film
with a performance that is as sweet and sensitive, as it is altogether
sexy.  Tomei is the most vibrant young face to grace the screen in
years, and she brings a great deal of freshness to the role of the
"love interest."  These two actors have wonderful chemistry on-screen--
they really do look great together.  All their scenes together can be
class- ified as love scenes, and each of them is a small gem.  Director
Tony Bill does a good job of erasing most of the grit of Tom Sierchio's
poignant script, and Cliff Eidelman skillfully captures the light,
exuberantly sweet tone of the film.  Put all these elements together,
and you have a truly involving and engaging movie.  UNTAMED HEART is
the best film of this, or any other, year.  See it, cry, and feel good
about life.</P>
<P>1993 -- 1:42m -- Rated PG-13, for mild Violence</P>
