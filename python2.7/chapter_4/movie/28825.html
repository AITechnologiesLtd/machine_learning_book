<P>The original Spanish title of Nico and Dani -  Krámpack -  sounds much more
exciting than the film actually is (Hint: It involves your hand, your mouth
and someone else).  It's received numerous awards from various film
festivals and a shocking number of positive reviews from various media
outlets, but I just don't get it.  Maybe it's because I cut my teeth on teen
sex romps like Porky's and Fast Times at Ridgemont High, as well as
my-parents-are-gone-so-come-over-and-let's-have-some-fun comedies like Risky
Business and Ferris Bueller's Day Off.</P>
<P>Dani is set over 10 days in and around a big beach house just outside
Barcelona.  When Dani's (Fernando Ramallo) parents leave their 17-year-old
son, he invites his buddy, Nico (former circus performer Jordi Vilches),
over for various teen hijinks.  Both boys are virgins and decide to do what
they can to remedy that situation, making Dani somewhat like a European
version of American Pie (do not fear - no pastry is violated).</P>
<P>Various adventures ensue, including trysts with two girls (Marieta Orozco
and Esther Nubiola), an older writer (Chisco Amado) and...well, each other.
That's right - the only remarkable thing about Dani is its gay content, and
I'd bet my next six paychecks that this film would have been completely
overlooked if it was about two "breeder" boys.  It's a simple coming-of-age
yawn...I mean yarn.  It's a yarn.  A coming-of-age yarn.</P>
<P>To make matters worse, Dani practically condones promiscuity and drug use,
and even features one of the boys raping an unconscious girl he has slipped
a mickey, but suffering absolutely no repercussion.  Is it realistic in its
portrayal of sexually charged young men?  Probably, but Big Brother is
realistic, too.  And nobody's raving about that.</P>
<P>1:30 - Not Rated but contains nudity, sexual content and language</P>
