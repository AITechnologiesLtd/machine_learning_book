<P>How pretty the Irish countryside, how sad Belfast, how cruel the troubles
of Northern Ireland, how disappointing this movie! Yet it begins with one
catchy bang then a sequence with a host of bang bangs.</P>
<P>First, Brad Pitt, as 8-year old Frankie sitting at the dinner table with
his loving family, right after grace witnesses a masked man shooting the
boy's father dead. Years later, in the early 1990s, there's a battle royal
between now grownup Pitt plus other IRA activists -- soldiers  or
terrorists depending on who is speaking-- and British forces in civvies and
uniforms,  armored cars, tanks and helicopters. It's kinetic carnage, deja
vu but well shot (no pun). Pitt escapes through a back door of the housing
area's warren.</P>
<P>Frankie, with almost two dozen killings to his credit, is sent on a mission
to the US where a big sum raised by Irish-American IRA sympathizers  awaits
him. He is to buy missiles and take them back home to blow up British
helicopters.</P>
<P>Bearing a counterfeit passport, Frankie lands at the Newark airport and
goes on by car through cityscapes. These are cold and dreary compared to
the green of Ireland, though the New York skyline impresses the young man.</P>
<P>Posing as "Rory," an immigrant construction worker, Frankie is housed in
the home of Irish-American police Sergeant Tom O'Meara (Harrison Ford) who
has a pretty wife and three pretty daughters. Ford, 54 when the film was
made, may be too long in the tooth for such a young family. That's a minor
point. What his Tom is, is a) a model cop; b) a sweet, non-violent family
man; c) a pacifist; d) not an IRA lover; e) entirely unsuspecting of
"Rory"'s identity; e) as honest as the day is long; f) Harrison Ford who
can still be something of an Indiana Jones when duty calls.</P>
<P>Notes. (a) and (b) are also underlined by Tom's nice behavior when after a
chase on foot he releases a temporary catch. Also by his disgust at
partner-buddy Edwin Diaz (Ruben Blades) for a shooting that was not called
for.  (e) is partly explained by Mrs.Meara being a working mother, and by
the house whose modesty spells Tom's honesty. Had he been a taker of bribes
or "mordidas," Mrs.M might have been a full-time mother and the house
fancier.</P>
<P>We're not talking out and out cliches here, but the next thing to them.
Hollywoodian ideas are floating around: 1) to pair two popular icons,
heroes and hearthrobs, one young,one older,thus spanning all male and
female audience ages; 2) to have the two men bond, the fatherless terrorist
and the son-less cop; 3) to keep Frankie's deception going until the
already bonded men have their confrontation. This begins at minute 77 of
the film.</P>
<P>What we get is three movies in one, coexisting in discomfort: a thriller, a
bond-film (not James) and an anti-violence picture. The latter is rather
heavily stressed in a confirmation sequence where the priest asks youths to
renounce the Devil. Too pat.</P>
<P>The movie had gotten a negative rap in the press, especially when, while it
was shooting, Brad Pitt griped in print about the incoherent, formless
script. He then called it  "the most irresponsible bit of film making -- if
you can even call it that -- that I've ever seen."  Although the PR people
played this down, along with the reported bad blood between Pitt and
Harrison, the fact remains that the movie was being written and rewritten
while it was being shot. This might sometimes be an asset in the hands of
certain independent filmmakers but it is seldom a good sign for studio
pictures</P>
<P>Ah, Hitchcock. Why is it that on a thousand topics discussed, he regularly
comes to mind because of his mastery, and specifically in this case,
because he had his films precisely mapped out before the cameras started
rolling?</P>
<P>"The Devil's Own" ("own" what?) may have good intentions, may have wished
to get into moral and psychological problems. It merely skims them. Its
obligatory elements keep it a prisoner of itself. A short list, not in
chronological order so as not to give away the plot too much:</P>
<P>1) There are several pretty women around. At least they are natural lookers
rather than model-beautiful.
2) There's an awkardly sketched out love affair between Pitt and little--
known Natascha McElhone. Her looks remind  me of Meryl Streep's.
3) There is a mano a mano fight, as in typical Westerns.
4) The obligatory villain is Treat Williams,the seller of the missiles. A
smoothie, he owns three bars. His villainy is telegraphed. By Irish
standards pub owners may be respectable, but by Hollywood standards, bar
owners are often fronts for the underworld -- another cliche.
5) Frankie, who had never been out of Ireland, knows from the start his way
around New York and vicinity better than residents of 20 years know their
way around Kalamazoo.
6) The American shooting scenes (and I mean real firepower) have Pitt most
improbably outgun and vanquish the villain and his henchmen.
7) Even more outrageously, when he does this, Pitt is already on the run,
has managed to get rid of his handcuffs  in a jiffy, to keep an appointment
on time and to make a money-bag explode! If America were to import a bunch
of Frankies, they could cut down our crime rate 50%.
8) Extreme outrageousness. The Stinger missiles are to go to Ireland on a
near-wreck of a tugboat that Sean, Frankie's childhood friend, already in
New York, has been somehow fixing.The two fellows continue to scrape,
restore and refit it. The boat,  the Sean character  and the passage of
time are not explained. Apparently only the two men will be the boat's
crew. With my limited nautical knowledge I can't swear that crossing duo or
solo the Atlantic on a tugboat is out of the question, especially after
Frankie finds himself Sean-less. Yet my feeling is like what Sam Goldwyn
used to say: "This is not only impossible, it cannot be done."</P>
<P>Does all this amount to a bad movie? Oddly, no--just a forgettable one.
Between the charm of Harrison Ford, the appeal (to many) of Brad Pitt, good
performances, fine production values and photography, a nice Irish score
(but when non-Irishy it gets characterless-generic), a few good scenes and
the overall camouflage of defects, this is not a dull, irritating film. But
it isn't good either.</P>
