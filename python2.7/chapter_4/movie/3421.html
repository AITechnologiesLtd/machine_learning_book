<PRE>                       STRAWBERRY AND CHOCOLATE
                         (FRESA Y CHOCOLATE)
                      A film review by Leo Bueno
                       Copyright 1995 Leo Bueno</PRE>
<P>     I am starting to write this review before going to see STRAWBERRY
AND CHOCOLATE, Cuba's Oscar nominee for best foreign film, directed by
Tomas Gutierrez Alea (who also directed the sometimes and in some
circles critically acclaimed MEMORIAS DEL SUBDESARROLLO--"Memories of
Underdevelopment".  I saw MEMORIAS as part of a Cuban cinema class back
in the late '70s; it merged the politics of the Cuban Revolution with
mundane elements of the human condition.  I knew then that MEMORIAS was
probably a state-sanctioned political missive, and now expect
STRAWBERRY will follow suit.</P>
<P>     Fellow Internetters, primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to Cuba
(soc.culture.cuba), have mentioned that STRAWBERRY is a harsh criticism
of the Revolution and its current state of affairs.  I have jumped to
the conclusion that STRAWBERRY is nothing more than a veiled attempt at
espousing the party line--it probably looks like political criticism,
but it ain't so.</P>
<P>     Having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of
Castro's repressiveness, I can't conceive of his tolerating honest and
adversarial criticism of the Revolution, and I can't imagine his
letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed
movement.  As kids say these days, duh!, the Revolution's current state
needs no criticism; its physical and spiritual crumbling is self
evident.</P>
<P>     The proper questions to put relate to Castro's legitimacy.  I bet
the film takes Castro's power for granted, and that this or any other
movie, produced under Cuba's state control, cannot question his right
to run Cuba's political show (ongoing now for more than 36 years).
That's why I just can't believe STRAWBERRY is an honest criticism of
the regime.  Let's see what happens after the room goes dark and the
screen lights up.</P>
<P>     I saw the film--twice.  I was right; Castro remained intact.</P>
<P>     STRAWBERRY negotiates the relationship between a young "dialectic
materialist,"  as he describes himself, and a homosexual photographer
(Diego) in 1979 Cuba.  The young man (David) is the son of peasants; a
symbol of the Revolution's reason for being.  Grateful to the
Revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education, he
studies Political Science instead of Literature, his avocation, because
he perceives it is his duty.  Therein lies a likely unintended irony,
since Cuba has no need for political theoreticians.  Cuba's government
is Castro.</P>
<P>     Diego's lifestyle is the antithesis of Revolutionary life.  He
enjoys the finer things--tea, opera, art.  He does not do "voluntary
work" for the Revolution.  His small apartment is a sensual oasis.  The
moniker "bourgeois" figuratively hangs over his head during the early
parts of the movie.  However, he is a "Revolucionario" in his own way.</P>
<P>     The supporting roles are filled by: an aging busybody with a heart
of gold and a troubled psyche; David's roommate, who rally takes the
Communist Party line to its expected extreme; David's ex-girlfriend,
who dumped him for another guy, yet wants to bed him before she leaves
for Italy with her husband; German, a gay sculptor whose work Diego is
attempting to exhibit, and who strikes a Faustian pact with the
government.</P>
<P>     Gutierrez Alea and co-director Juan Carlos Tabio do a fine job at
almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too.  Heck,
towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal
for his patriotic fervor.  He really loves the Revolution (as
supposedly does everybody else in Cuba) and wants to make it better by
exposing and correcting some of its flaws.</P>
<P>     Real criticism is missing though.  This movie is political window
dressing.  Luis Aguilar Leon's op. ed. piece on FRESA in THE MIAMI
HERALD (10 March 1995, at 21A) did not color my judgment; it presaged
my intuition.  Aguilar Leon expressed my sentiment about this film's
political angle best:
         Like many artistic manifestations in Cuba, STRAWBERRY AND
    CHOCOLATE sprang from a totally manipulated environment.  As art
    critic Ivan De La Nuez well states in the latest issue of the
    magazine POSTMODERN NOTES, the silenced artists are those who
    refuse to accept "the charade in which artists can provoke up to a
    point, while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding
    them to go beyond that point."</P>
<P>     Although terrible propaganda, this is otherwise a fine film.</P>
