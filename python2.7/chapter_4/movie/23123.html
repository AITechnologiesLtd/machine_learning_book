<P>   "I see dead people," says Cole Sear in the key line of M.
Night Shyamalan's "Sixth Sense."  Last year's film--which
marked a breakthrough for Bruce Willis (which he later
squandered in the pathetic comedy "The Whole Nine Yards")-
-enjoyed the most expertly engineered plot twist of any we've
seen in 1999.  "Waking the Dead" has a similar theme,
though with a less than spellbinding conclusion, but gives
hope to those of us who are more than eight years old.  We
too might relish the thrill of observing the dead.  What you
have to do is not so much to believe as to love.  And boy, do
you have to love deeply, so much so that your devotion
transcends this mortal coil.  That's just what Fielding Pierce
(Billy Crudup) can effect in a film which its executive
producer, Jodie Foster, feels is so strong, so captivating, that
it simply had to be made.  Compressing Scott Spencer's
dense, 500-page novel into less than two hours, writer Robert
Dillon succeeds to a reasonable extent under the helm of
director Keith Gordon ("Mother Night").  This time around,
Gordon does not have the unenviable job of adapting an
enigmatic Kurt Vonnegut story of an American prisoner in an
Israeli jail who had posed as a Nazi propagandist on the
radio: but he is still fond of flashback techniques that
flustered us in that film's audience.  With "Waking the Dead"
we take a dizzying path from the early eighties back to the
early seventies again to the eighties and back again almost
ad infinitum until every last romantic emotion and political
idea is wrung from its two attractive principals.</P>
<P>    "Waking the Dead" is not so much a supernatural tingler
(though it is that) as it is a marriage between affairs of state 
and affairs of the heart--centering on a smashingly attractive
performer with a Mediterranean image and an ambitious
politician who often appears clueless.  As Fielding Pierce,  
Crudup is introduced to us in 1974 as a private in the Coast
Guard, a post he may have taken to avoid being sent to
Southeast Asia during the closing months of the Vietnam
War.  Not for him the uncompromising path, the flight to
Canada--which might have meant the throwing away of his
future.   But for the woman he meets at his hippie brother's
(Paul Hipp's) publishing firm where she serves as an
assistant, Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly), compromise is
anathema.  For Sarah and Fielding it's love at first sight, but
like star-crossed lovers throughout history they are destined
for an uneven future.</P>
<P>   While Fielding, mentored for a seat in Congress by the
well-connected Isaac Green (Hal Holbrook), walks the middle
path, his great love is an uncompromising woman of the left
who works through her church with a Chilean relief program. 
At one point she lashes out at a bigwig supporter of her boy
friend's congressional campaign for writing a Newsweek
article praising the violent overthrow of a democratically
elected Chilean regime.  When you look at Sarah, you think
Sophocles' "Antigone," a pain-in-the-butt, unyielding force
willing to die for her beliefs.  Observe Fielding and you see a
guy who has no real political program other than a vague
sense that he will work for his constituents and later,
pretentiously to help push America closer to being a paradise
on earth.  When Sarah is presumably killed by a car bomb
planted by opponents of her outspoken campaign for Chilean
democracy, Fielding is understandably shattered--so much so
that at several key moments in his political battle he "sees"
her, is certain that she is still alive, and believes that
someone else was buried in her stead to give the enemy the
impression that she had been eliminated.</P>
<P>   Keith Gordon negotiates this passion-filled drama of love's
intensity with a reasonable degree of success, his two
principals conveying substantial chemistry.  From the moment
Fielding takes Sarah home after their first date (at which point
Sarah coyly decides whether to invite him upstairs), to the
drama of Fielding's brief breakdown in front of his supportive
family, Gordon must assure us that the love of these two
attractive people is so intense, so unyielding, that Fielding
would break loose at one point to chase after his vision of the
woman.  We must consider that he would ultimately turn into
a political Bulworth, inspired by her memory to make the
world a better place.  A minor flaw in the story is that we
never find out exactly what it is that Sarah is doing that
arouses the intense hatred of the right-wing Chilean forces
since, after all, for the most part she is simply aiding poor
refugees from that wonderful grape-producing country.  What
is of consequence is a fine performance by Crudup who at
one point does a masculine emulation of Shakespeare's
Ophelia--whose own unrequited love drives her to suicidal
insanity.  </P>
<P>   The picture is overloaded with silly side characters,
particularly Fielding's hippie brother Dan, who does a pale
imitation of a weed-addicted publisher--certain to elicit
unintentional laughter from the audience when he describes
his falling in love with a Korean hooker in a massage parlor. 
Janet McTeer is knocked down a few pegs from her strong,
lead performance in "Tumbleweeds" to a nothing role as
Fielding's understanding sis.  Jennifer Connelly's sporadic
come-hither look, nicely photographed by Tom Richmond, is
the most charming aspect of this movie, the romantic tone
supported by some delightful soundtrack ballads from
tomandandy.  The big question: is she or isn't she?  You'll
have a strong impression of the answer to that one when you
catch this generally rewarding film.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 103 minutes.  (C) 2000
