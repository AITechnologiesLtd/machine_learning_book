<PRE>THE FULL MONTY</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  **1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>In the beginning of THE FULL MONTY, we are shown a cheesy early 70's
promotional film for the city of Sheffield, England.  Sheffield, we
are told, is a city based on steel.  Massive factories employ
thousands of workers in an industry which will never die.  Fast
forward 25 years into the present, where Sheffield is now somewhat
less than a boom town, with a large portion of its male population
looking for jobs.</P>
<P>We meet Gary (Robert Carlyle) and Dave (Mark Addy), two unemployed
steelworkers reduced to stealing scrap from the abandoned factory
which for ten years was their place of work.  Gary has a son who is
shuttled back and forth between living with Gary and his ex-wife and
her live-in lover.  The ex lives in a comfortable house in a good
section of town, while Gary lives in a cramped apartment in a near
tenement neighborhood.  What Gary lacks in material possessions, he
tries to make up for with love for his boy.  Dave, on the other hand,
is married, albeit not happily.  He suspects his wife of looking for
another man to replace him, due to his current state of unemployment
and his overweight condition.  To top it all off, he's battling a bout
of impotence.</P>
<P>While walking home from a botched attempt at "liberating" a steel
girder from their old factory, Gary and Dave notice hundreds of women
lined up to enter a nightclub to see the Chippendale Dancers.  They
first scoff at the performance, but when Gary finds out he needs 700
pounds in order to file for joint custody of his son, they realize
that male exotic dancing would be an easy way to make some quick cash.
Their first obstacle, however, is that neither of them can dance very
well, so they attempt to enlist the help of their former boss, Gerald
(Tom Wilkinson), who happens to take weekly dance lessons.  Gerald,
like Gary and Dave, is unemployed, but he can't be involved in such
foolishness because he has "standing."  Besides, he's on his way to a
job interview, his first in six months.  Gerald also points out a
second problem.  Dave is fat, Gary is skinny, and they're both ugly.</P>
<P>In retaliation, Dave and Gary manage to sabotage Gerald's interview,
but quickly realize their mistake when Gerald has a near breakdown,
confessing that this was his last hope.  He hadn't told his wife he
was jobless, and "she's still got credit cards.  She's out there right
now, shopping!"  After making amends, Gerald agrees to help Dave and
Gary learn to dance and audition other dancers.  After all, he needs
the money, too.</P>
<P>In general, the characters are quite likable.  For example, even
though Gary takes his son Nathan (William Snape) along with him to
steal scrap, and has him run the tape player when grown men are
stripping to Donna Summer's "Hot Stuff", you know it's only because he
wants to spend time with his boy.  You can't help but like a character
who's willing to take off his clothes and risk being a laughing-stock
for a reason like that.  Robert Carlyle brings a lot of earnestness to
his role, and the scenes involving Gary and Nathan have a tangible
sense of genuine affection.</P>
<P>The accents and terminology get in the way in a few places, and I
think I lost out on several of the jokes due to the fact that some of
the dialog was unintelligible.  If I were from Sheffield, I'm sure I
would have been rolling in the aisles.  Luckily, this wasn't a major
problem as most of the jokes were sight gags anyway.  About 80 percent
of the movie's laughs are derived from watching these unemployed
steelworkers trying to shake their moneymakers.  One might think that
the same joke would grow tiresome after a while, but director Peter
Cattaneo does a good job of making each attempt at learning a little
different.  A funny little scene involves the would-be dancers trying
to get tips by reviewing a tape of FLASHDANCE.  They get encouraged
when they notice that the Jennifer Beals character is a steelworker,
too.</P>
<P>One problem I saw was the way the main characters bonded so quickly.
Gary and Dave already know each other, but everyone else is basically
thrown together in a very short time.  One day they are strangers, and
the next day they are working as a team to pursue a goal.  The
relationship between Gary, Dave and Gerald even has to overcome
animosity and a class boundary.  I suppose a case could be made for
the common plight of unemployment, but since the movie only runs an
hour and a half, a little extra time could have been taken in order to
cultivate the relationships a little more carefully.</P>
<P>All in all, THE FULL MONTY is an enjoyable film.  While laughing at
the characters, we are also wrapped up in the desire to see these
folks get a little better each time.  While part of this has to do
with the characters' likability, I also think it's because they're
just regular guys like the rest of us, and not muscle-bound hunks.
We'd like to see normal people get the same success and adoration that
the top of the genetic pyramid so often hordes.  Although I didn't
really need to see them take their clothes off, I was rooting for them
all the same.</P>
