<P>   "A Perfect Murder" is an ironic title given the fact that
Hollywood movies rarely involve killers who get away with
their crimes.  Considering the cleverness of its villain, it's
difficult to believe he would commit so many flaws in planning
the murder of his wife--or even that he would allow himself to
lose so much money on Wall Street that he would be
financially wiped out.  While the errors in his scheme make
the plot more predictable than we'd like, Andrew Davis's
direction of Patrick Smith Kelly's screenplay is so disciplined
that the film maintains its suspense from beginning to end. 
Based on the play "Dial M for Murder" by Frederick Knott,
later made by Alfred Hitchcock ito a clunky movie starring Ray
Milland, "A Perfect Murder" relies on its excellent cast to rivet
audience attention.  Though Michael Douglas is still Gordon
Gecko, he  plies his craft with enough variety to involve us. 
There's simply no one else who can carry off the demeanor of
a cold, calculating, handsome and passionate money man.</P>
<P>   "A Perfect Murder" begins in bed as Emily (Gwyneth
Paltrow), the trophy wife of currency trader Steven Taylor
(Michael Douglas), is carrying on a torrid affair with a much
younger man, painter David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen). 
Though she is not yet aware, her husband has detected and
photographed her afternoon movements and feels deeply
deceived by the woman he loves for herself and not primarily
for her $100 million worth.  When she arrives home to their
drop-dead designer apartment overlooking New York's Central
Park, she and Steven say all the right things but you can tell
by their body language that things are wrong.  She
avoids his eyes; his are flashing with justifiable anger.  The
couple are mismatched in age, Emily about twenty-five years
Steven's junior.  Though they attend the same functions and
appear to be of the same social class, her straying is almost
excusable.</P>
<P>   The film spends most of its time in the planning of a
murder, with Steven's offer of $500,000 to the man he is
convinced will accept the assignment because of certain
information he can use to blackmail the perp.  Steven's
motivation all the more believable as he has suffered a drastic
financial loss on the market which has wiped him out.  The
narrative is gripping not only in the well-executed unfolding of
the crime but even more in the insight the story gives us into
the lives of the super rich and in the subtle ways the
characters show their feelings for one another.  Emily's
mother, Sandra (Constance Towers) welcomes her daughter
to a spacious suburban home and shoots a glance of dislike
toward Steven.  Is she disappointed that her daughter married
a man who is so much older?  Does she have some insight
into the nature of his character?  Mohamed Karaman (David
Suchet), in the role of detective inspector Mohamed Karaman,
is immediately suspicious of Steven, a vague intuition,
perhaps, and as an Arab-American is charmed by Emily's
knowledge of the Arabic language.  Despite her wealth, Emily
works, but in a glamour job as a multilingual translator at
United Nations headquarters, where she is best friends with
Raquel--a woman whom Steven calls "the Castilian femme
fatale" (but who does not look at all Castilian).  Steven plays
cards at the club with $1,000 as a typical opening bet, and
Emily "lunches" with her friend.  Yet Emily takes the subway
to a drug nest and charms a dealer by speaking his language
while Steven spends some time in a dilapidated loft building in
the downscale Greenpoint section of Brooklyn.</P>
<P>   Director Andrew Davis gets good work from his classy cast,
getting Douglas to portray a man who is driven by greed but
by his feelings of betrayal as well.  David Suchet, known to
aficionados of detective stories as Agatha Christie's Hercule
Poirot, is appropriately all-knowing as the skeptical police
inspector, and Viggo Mortensen--who plays a guy who is not
what he seems--can effectively vary his chameleon-like
demeanor according to the needs of the situation.</P>
<P>    The film's ending is too neat, even juvenile.  A European
version would rely more on a chessboard artifice than on light
artillery.  "A Perfect Murder," which features opulent settings
as one of its principal characters, is a vigorous entry into the
summer entertainment market.</P>
<PRE>Rated R.  Running time: 107 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
