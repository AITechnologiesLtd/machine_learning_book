<PRE>                                 ASSASSINS
                       A film review by Choo Eng Aun
                        Copyright 1995 Choo Eng Aun</PRE>
<P>Starring : Sylvester Stallone, Antonio Banderas, Julian Moore
Directed by : Richard Donner
Running Time : 2hrs</P>
<P>     Team up the Italian Stallion with The Spanish El-Mariachi into one
film and call up Richard (LETHAL WEAPON 1,2 & 3, MAVERICK) Donner to
direct it, looks like a sure hit right?  Wrong!  This the second movie
for Stallone this summer (he reportedly got paid US$50 million to do
three movies this year) and the second bomb for him this year after the
dismal response for the high budget sci-fi flick, JUDGE DREDD.  While,
Sly's career seems to be going downhill, his Spanish counterpart (who
can actually speak better than him!) is on his way up.  Banderas also
starred in DESPERADO, a high octaned action film with the bodycount
higher than all the RAMBO movies put together, which incidentally may
not pass the censors here, I hope not!!</P>
<P>     Stallone is Robert Rath, the best hired gun money can buy.  He's
been on the business for many years and can be considered a veteran of
that trade.  From the starting sequences, we see that Rath is getting
tired (bored?) and seemingly a little frustrated about the direction of
his life, retirement is on his mind, but its not exactly one job one
can just quit so easily.  His life was immediately made more
interesting with the appearance of Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas), a
psychotic, semi-lunatic hired gun, who `steals' Rath's contracts by
killing the targets before he can get to them, in the beginning we are
made to think that Miguel is just some crazy hired-gun who is trying
very hard to be oust Rath and be no.1 in the trade but as the story
unfolds, a greater plot ensues.</P>
<P>     The love interest, (I shall call her Cat, couldn't catch the name)
played by Julian Moore, a small time hacker with no real identity and
gets entangled in something much more than she would ever imagine.  Cat
started out being the prime target of a hit but ended up being saved by
Rath from Miguel.  For once, there's a decent plot in a Stallone movie
and although slightly predictable, is quite interesting + enjoyable.</P>
<P>     Stallone fares well here, partly due to the fact that he speaks
very much less than most of his other movies.  Banderas's Miguel was
totally cool ... toting around town in in his sweaty,
psychotic-appearance, Latino looks and a "Speedy Gonzales" accent, his
character easily outshines Stallone's Rath.  Is this a precedence in
action movies today?  Most baddies seem to take the front seat from the
hero.</P>
<P>     All in all, there's a lot of creative shoot-outs in this film (very
John Woo, but on a more believable level), enough explosives and
suspense to satisfy most action lovers.  But there are time when the
action tries a bit too hard, only to end up being totally boring and
predictable.  Richard Donner is an exceptional action film director and
it is sad to see his film not doing well, maybe he should team up with
Gibson again in another LETHAL WEAPON movie, I'll like that.  If you're
an action fan, this film should prove to be quite enjoyable, Banderas
is pure fun to watch.</P>
