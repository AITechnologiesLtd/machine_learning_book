<PRE>                                    CLERKS
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Director: Kevin Smith
Starring: Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti.</P>
<P>     CLERKS is a bold and audacious comedy from New Jersey.  First-time
director Kevin Smith raised under $30,000 to make this black and white
ode to the minimum wage worker.  A sum that in Hollywood is not enough
to design even an advertising poster.  With that money and a cast of
unknowns he created a sometimes ragged but more often hilarious comedy
of errors.</P>
<P>     Originally the film was rated NC-17 for language alone.  A famous
lawyer made a freedom of speech argument and got it reduced to an R
without cutting.  CLERKS takes the obscene adolescent banter of the
aimless class and raises it to a new level.  The film charts the course
of one misbegotten day in the life of a convenience store clerk and a
video store clerk, neither of whom seem concerned with actually
working..  Most of the humor in the film is very crude, discussions
over sex and former girlfriends, descriptions of X-rated tapes.  But
the film is not just a barrage of crude jokes, if it were that the film
would be little more than a fast food version of POLICE ACADEMY.
Beneath the graphic dialogue are serious issues of relationships and
goals.  As things go progressively wrong, the clerks are forced to face
up to the shortcomings of their personalities.  Through an absurd
series of unlikely events they have to make choices that will effect
the rest of their lives.  Beneath all the crude banter, there is a
complex discussion of the two divergent philosophies of the clerks.
The variety of people who manage to wander into the stores keeps the
film being a monotonous two-character dialogue.  Odd (to say the least)
circumstances take the clerks out of the mall briefly to provide a
break from the one-set atmosphere.</P>
<P>     While the black and white film and realistic locations suggest a
documentary, the events quickly suggest surrealism.  Like Luis Bunuel's
great farces on the manners of the European upper classes,  CLERKS
takes a cross section of lower class people and faces them with the
sublimely ridiculous.  Dante, the main character, is plunged into a
world that seems to be plotting against him, and everyone he has ever
known or wanted to know.  Dante thought he had trouble when his relief
fails to show up so he can play hockey.  When he reads in the newspaper
that his girlfriend is getting married to somebody she never mentioned,
his troubles just begin.</P>
<P>      The shoestring budget and non-professional actors leads to a less
than perfect film.  In one long scene, shot with one camera movement,
one of the actors noticeably forgets her line.  Other actors give
somewhat stiff deliveries to their small bits.  The flaws really add a
dimension to the film.  They remind you that this is not a polished
multi-million dollar film where a team of 32 writers managed to come up
with nothing worth watching.  This film is a joke scribbled on the wall
as the pen runs out of ink.  The crudeness of the technique accents the
crudeness of the humor.</P>
