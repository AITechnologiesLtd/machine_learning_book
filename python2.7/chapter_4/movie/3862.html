<P>     LOVE AND HUMAN REMAINS, the first English-language feature from 
Canadian director Denys Arcand (JESUS OF MONTREAL), is a curious 
hodgepodge of drama, comedy, and murder mystery.  Its success is 
sporadic at best, but, too often, the film completely misses the mark.  
We are presented with seven characters, all interesting as individuals, 
who are jumbled together in a series of relationships which seem 
contrived and plotted.  Then there's a serial killer subplot that 
continuously undermines those things that LOVE AND HUMAN REMAINS gets 
right. </P>
<P>     At the center of this movie is David (Thomas Gibson), an ex-actor 
turned waiter who has contact, one way or another, with the six other 
characters.  David is a thirtyish gay man with an almost-religious 
disbelief in the existence of love.  "There's no such thing as love" 
might be his mantra -- he repeats it often enough.  David's roommate and 
ex-lover (he used to be straight) is Candy (Ruth Marshall), an emotional 
cripple desperately in search for any sort of love.  To that end, she's 
willing to try dating a bartender with a secret (Rick Roberts) and a 
lesbian schoolteacher she meets at a local gym (Joanne Vannicola).  One 
of David's closest male friends is Bernie (Cameron Bancroft), a hard-
worker who has sex with a different woman just about every night.  
Another mate is seventeen-year old Kane (Matthew Ferguson), a busboy who 
works with David, and is beginning to have fantasies about the older 
man.  Then there's Benita (Mia Kirshner), a psychic dominatrix who 
specializes in all sorts of kinky stuff -- like reading a client's mind 
before deciding how to please him.  Meanwhile, the entire unnamed 
Canadian city is being terrorized by a serial killer who, more than 
likely, is one of these people. </P>
<P>     The acting in LOVE AND HUMAN REMAINS is uniformly good, and results 
in several compelling characters.  Even Benita, the strangest of the 
bunch, attains a level of believability as a result of a fine 
performance by Mia Kirshner (this part is not unlike the one she took on 
in EXOTICA).  Nevertheless, this film illustrates that more than 
interesting people are needed to formulate a solid motion picture.  Brad 
Fraser's script (which he adapted from his off-Broadway play) is 
completely unconvincing when it comes to developing love or sex-based 
relationships (the platonic friendships are just fine).  Characters are 
forced into unnatural roles and emotions come to the surface too 
quickly.  In real life, relationships take time to build, but not in 
LOVE AND HUMAN REMAINS.  Here, they sort of spring into existence in 
full blossom, and ring false as a result. </P>
<P>     The story is further hampered by the need to incorporate a murder 
mystery.  Numerous red herrings highlight amateurish attempts to keep 
the audience guessing at the killer's identity.  The truth is actually 
pretty obvious despite the misdirection -- there are really only two 
legitimate suspects, and it's not hard to eliminate one of them.  Of all 
the things that don't work in the movie, this element strikes the most 
discordant note. </P>
<P>     Although LOVE AND HUMAN REMAINS is billed as a drama, it's real 
strength is its comedy.  With snappy one-liners and perfectly-timed 
longer sequences, the film is ripe with hilarious moments.  The humor 
functions as Arcand's lighter counterpoint to the dreary isolation 
suffered by his characters.  Now, if only the dramatic foundations had 
been better established...  The characters are there, as is the insight, 
but the situations aren't right, and that makes for a film that, while 
watchable, leaves the impression it should have been a whole lot better.  </P>
