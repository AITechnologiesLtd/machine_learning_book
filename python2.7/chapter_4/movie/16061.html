<PRE>FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH (1982)</PRE>
<P>What, you ask, is this movie of movies? This one which you've heard about?
It's an eighties thing, with not much appeal for the modern troupe because
its slower paced, less funny, than what you might see today. But, like a lot
of eighties movies, it holds its own merit. This adaptation of the book by
Cameron Crowe (don't know who he is? I'll give you a hint. He wrote and
directed the famous line "Did you know the human brain weighs eight pounds?"
That's right, the maker of Jerry Maguire and Singles) is a coming-of-age
drama about a young girl making the choice all of us make, sex or a
relationship.</P>
<P>Sure, we tell ourselves that both can exist, and they can, but there is the
line that she draws: if she wants to sleep around or if she wants to have
something to hold onto. And the movie, in a nutshell, is about that. It
follows her and her friends during their last year in High School in the
small town of Ridgemont. Where each one of them ends up with their troubles,
ranging from no girlfriend to an abortion to adultery.
It sounds serious, right?</P>
<PRE>That's not quite on target.</PRE>
<P>The movie has its serious moments, but it has its funny moments too: from
two girls practicing blow jobs on a carat at a lunch table to a guy cruising
for chicks dressed in a pirate cap. The movie is sublimely funny. And
interesting. It's very sad, in my mind, that those things are so rarely seen
in the 90's.</P>
