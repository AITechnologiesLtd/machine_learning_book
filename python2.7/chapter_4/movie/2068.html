                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>1:36, Comedy, 1993
MPAA rating: PG-13 (explicit language, adult situations, adult
                    humor, violence)
Rating: five (on a scale of zero to five)
Director: Steve Rash
Cast: Pauly Shore, Carla Gugino, Lane Smith, Cindy Pickett, Mason Adams,
      Dan Gauthier, Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, Dennis Burkley, Patrick Renna,
      Brenden Frasier</P>
<P>     Carla Gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in
her small farming town, she goes to college in California.  There she
meets the residential advisor Pauly Shore, who is a city boy.  When
Gugino goes back home for Thanksgiving, she brings Shore with her, and
her parents (Lane Smith and Cindy Pickett) are less than thrilled.  Dan
Gauthier, Gugino's boyfriend from high school, proposes to Gugino.
Gugino isn't ready for anything like this so she makes up the story
that she is engaged to Shore.  She and Shore have to make it look like
they are engaged while her parents try to make it end.</P>
<P>     Forget JURASSIC PARK, CLIFFHANGER, THE FIRM and LAST ACTION HERO,
SON-IN-LAW is the film to see this summer.  SON-IN-LAW is a great
romantic comedy that should please the viewers, especially fans of the
Wiez.  When SON-IN-LAW is long gone and forgotten, the blockbuster
summer films will still be playing and you will have a chance to see
them then.  This film could also make great video fare for those that
are leery of spending seven dollars on it.  Nothing will be lost by
watching it on a television screen.</P>
<P>     Although the basic story line has been done many, many times
before, the film is still fun to watch.  The laughs are plentiful,
especially when the Wiez is around.  The way some of the jokes are done
are new, even though some of the jokes are old.  There are also several
new jokes that, at least, I haven't seen before.  Still, when presented
right, even old material can be funny still.  This film is just
basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right
mood that doesn't contain much violence or any nudity that is
definitely worth full ticket price.</P>
<P>     The cast for this film does an excellent job.  Pauly Shore (ENCINO
MAN) is the star attraction of this film.  He is great, and knows how
to entertain the audience.  Pauly Shore just seems to take over the
entire screen when he is on with expressions and comments that are
hilarious.  This film would definitely not have been as good with
anyone else in this role.  Carla Gugino does a very good job as the
farm girl gone city girl.  She makes her character believable, on some
levels, yet interesting at the same time.  The person who played the
grandfather (Mason Adams, I believe) also does a great job.  The way he
delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on
the screen.  Patrick Renna, who played Gugino's little brother, was a
little annoying, but no where as near as Macaulay Culkin, and for only
part of the time, so I can forgive him.  Tiffani-Amber Thiessen (A
KILLER AMONG FRIENDS, "Saved by the Bell") does a reasonably good job
for the time that she is on screen.  She shows that she may have a
potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults
programming on television.  She wasn't given overly much to do in the
film, but what she had, she does a good job with.</P>
