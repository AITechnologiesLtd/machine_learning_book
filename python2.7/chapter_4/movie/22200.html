<PRE>2 Days In The Valley
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Danny Aiello; Greg Cruttwell; Jeff Daniels; Teri Hatcher & Glenne
Headly</P>
<P>2 Days In The Valley is more or less a Pulp Fiction knock off. It basically
involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the Los Angeles area end up
having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways. I'm not
going into much greater detail than that, since it would take forever to
explain, and quite frankly, I'm not willing to spend any more time on it
than the 2 hours that I've already wasted.  While it tries very hard to be
Pulp Fiction, 2 Days In The Valley falls way short. This is quite a
condemnation considering the cast includes Danny Aiello, James Spader and
Jeff Daniels.</P>
<P>While the story isn't much, and the dialogue and characters rate only
marginally better, 2 Days In The Valley does have a couple of bright spots.
James Spader's character, while not much better than the rest, is at least
fun to watch in a sick sort of way. And we do get to see a nice cat fight
between uber babes Teri Hatcher and Charlize Theron (in her first role). You
know a movie isn't that good when the highlight is a brawl between two
women. Even if they are both gorgeous.</P>
<P>I will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they
managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have
otherwise never interacted. But marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry
from actually enjoying the result. While some of the characters and their
respective stories are fairly interesting, they inevitably are brought down
as they intersect with the other half of the characters that I really cared
absolutely nothing about. If I were to put a number on it, only about half
of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly
interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch.</P>
<P>This is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast
members should rent, and even then prepare for disappointment. Not even
Charlize Theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again. Or
at least not all of it anyway.</P>
