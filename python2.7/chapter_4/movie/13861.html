<P>starring Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Matt Damon
screenplay by Robert Rodat
directed by Steven Spielberg</P>
<P>In this fictional but truthful picture, Tom Hanks stars as Captain
Miller; his squadron has just survived D-Day at Omaha Beach when they
are reassigned. Essentially a P.R. move from the head office, Miller and
his seven men must search for a missing paratrooper, one Private James
Francis Ryan-whose three brothers have been killed in action-and send
him home to his distraught mother. The search leads them across French
battlefields... I suppose it's not giving away too much to say that they
eventually locate Ryan (Damon) and discover their moral duty as soldiers
in an active war surpasses the exact definition of their mission.</P>
<P>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is possibly the most violent movie I have ever seen.
At least, it seemed that way because of its connection to history and,
in the second half of the film, my emotional attachment to the
characters. In addition to Miller, we have Sgt. Horvath (Sizemore), who
collects dirt from the various places he's travelled; New Yorker Pvt.
Reiben (Burns), eager to impress with attitude; gentle T/4 Medic Wade
(Giovanni Ribisi), whom at one point recopies a letter for a dead
soldier so that it is not mailed-out bloodstained; lone-Jew Pvt. Mellish
(Adam Goldberg), for whom the war has obviously become deeply personal;
Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies), a gun-shy translator fluent in French and
German; God-fearing Pvt. Jackson (Barry Pepper) and Pvt. Caprazo (Vin
Diesel), both exemplary servicemen.</P>
<P>I have just done what the filmmakers basically resist: breaking the
squadron down into genre types. The soldiers remain ordinary human
beings in unpredictable circumstances to the bitter end, by turns
cowardly, certifiable, happy, melancholy, etc. If one of them dies, we
feel as sad as if another of them dies. Like combat, such deaths are
always shocking and instantaneous. Spielberg's latest film doesn't just
have a generic, you-are-there feeling: his camera zigzags like a scared
LIFE photographer trapped in the heat of the action, racing behind the
troops, falling into the sea, dizzily lingering on some gruesome
carnage, like the man who is searching for his missing arm, or the boy
who takes off his shot helmet in relief only to be killed seconds later.
The layered story places its anti-violent and anti-war sentiments
clearly up-front: the only way to hammer home the horror of armed
conflict is to display it uncensored. At one point, Reiben asks, ‘Why
risk the eight of us for one guy?' and the irony was not lost on me:
nobody questions the validity of their involvement in WWII, a P.R. move
at its heart, also.</P>
<P>Which is why I'm only hesitant about the final shot of the movie: an
American flag flapping in the breeze. Proudly? That's open to debate; I
never felt SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was particularly patriotic, to its
credit. This is a smaller story than "America's War Effort". I'll
unabashedly admit it reduced me to tears. If it takes a popular
entertainment to put into context for so many young people what has
mostly been relegated to dryly-written textbooks, thank goodness it is
one of integrity and catharsis.</P>
