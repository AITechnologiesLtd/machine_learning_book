<PRE>Dark City
Review By: Ryan Davis
2/27/98</PRE>
<P>        There isn't much good about this movie. Not much I can say about the
acting, directing, or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie.
So I'll get my one good comment out of the way, at least Joel Schuemacher
(Batman & Robin) didn't direct it or it would be titled "Technicolor City". In
fact there is nothing colorful about this movie, its dark and depressingly
gloomy right down to the bitter end.</P>
<P>        The plot has a tendency to be interesting, but all that passes while
your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a
fascinating movie. The plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it
gets, so I will just touch on the bare minimum. John Murdoch(Rufus Sewell)
awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel, only to find out he has forgotten
everything. John must find out who he is before the "strangers"(a.k.a. mind
erasing aliens) find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy.  During
the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality, and
the existence of inherently evil people. Any of these points however are
completely "erased" from your  mind as you watch the actors stumble through
the dreadful script.</P>
<P>        As I mentioned earlier, nothing but the atmosphere is right in this
film.  The acting is bland, and since there is virtually no character
development no one seems to care. The special effects are low budget and some
even hilariously  fake, a sign of a true "B-movie".  The direction is poor
and there is little continuity, not that you would expect it in a movie
switching realities constantly. Lastly the script is weak and has no concept
of reality, and doesn't deserve to have the word "science" in
science-fiction. If I haven't got my point across, I'll say it more plainly:
This is a bad movie. Lets hope the next movie by Alex "I wish I was Tim
Burton" Proyas is at least tolerable.</P>
