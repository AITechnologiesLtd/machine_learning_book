<PRE>                                MUMFORD
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Pleasant and amiable is Lawrence
          Kasdan's style in this story of two Mumfords.  One
          is a small town of that name; one is the name of
          the town's successful but unorthodox psychologist.
          This film does a once-over lightly on the town and
          on the nature of psychological help.  Rating: 6 (0
          to 10), high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Films like PLEASANTVILLE have questioned time-honored American
small town values.  But traditionally American films have given us
idealized representations of American small town life.  Generally in
American films small towns are where good people live and work.  Films
like SHADOW OF A DOUBT have intentionally shown small town life as
really being the American ideal. Hitchcock intentionally played up the
theme in SHADOW OF A DOUBT to show wartime audiences that small town
life was what Americans were fighting for.  Films like DOC HOLLYWOOD
press the idea that if you get to know the American small town you are
bound to like it and the people in it.  MUMFORD is a similar film
extolling the virtues of the small town life.  DOC HOLLYWOOD was about
the outsider trying to leave the small town but falling in love with
the town instead.  MUMFORD is a variation in which the outsider already
loves the town and really wants to stay in the small town in spite of
forces to make him leave.</P>
<P>     MUMFORD opens with a sequence that looks like it was from some
luscious, steamy 1940s James M. Cain film adaptation.  Are we in the
right movie?  Yes.  We are in the fantasy life of the Mumford town
pharmacist.  The strong, handsome young man of the fantasy turns out to
be plump, balding and nearly blind in real life. He is on the couch
talking to bland, handsome psychologist Dr. Mumford (played by Lorn
Dean).  Doc Mumford is disarmingly pleasant and affable.</P>
<P>     Through most of the first third of the film we get to know the
unorthodox doctor and about six of his cases.  We watch how he goes
about treating them.  Among them are Althea Brockett (Mary McDonnell)
who lives in luxury but is becoming a compulsive buyer.  Young Skip
Skipperton (Jason Lee) skateboards through traffic and runs the most
successful modem company in the world.  Emotionally he is still a child
just looking for a buddy with whom to talk and play catch.  Then there
is Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis) an attractive divorcee who is living with
her parents and developing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  Mumford's
treatment in each case seems to be in equal parts pleasant conversation
and intuitive pop psychology.  Sooner or later he seems to get each of
his patients up to a nice place in the hills he knows of that has an
impressive overlook of the town. Kasdan's approach to getting to the
story is as unhurried and even as pleasant as life in the American
small town of the title.</P>
<P>     Ernest Delbanco (David Paymer) and Phyllis Sheeler (Jane Adams), a
psychiatrist and a psychologist, do not mind that the newcomer is more
successful than they are, but have some reservations about his style.
But we too start to notice something a little off in the psychologist's
style.  In shooting the breeze with his patients Mumford may
indiscreetly talk about his other cases.  Often his comments to his
patients are a little more direct and frank than we might expect.  He
bones up on the Internet for some surprisingly basic psychological
information.  He also takes an immediate dislike to town lawyer Lionel
Dillard (Martin Short).  It may well be that Doc Mumford may have some
problems of his own, psychological and otherwise.</P>
<P>     In telling his story, Kasdan uses some unorthodox approaches.  The
primary story line is delayed well into the film and then only half-
heartedly visited now and again.  What drives the film is not the pace
of the plot.  Instead, one wants to see each of the cases Dr. Mumford
is treating and how a simple intuitive approach works to solve
problems.  Nor is the cast a particularly high-powered one.  Loren
Dean, who played the title role in BILLY BATHGATE and was an
investigator in GATTACA, is likeable and inoffensive, but he borders on
being insipid and never generates much dramatic tension.  Alfre Woodard
is under-used as a friend and neighbor of Doc Mumford.  Woodard
previously shared with Mary McDonnell the films BLUE CHIPS, PASSION
FISH, and GRAND CANYON.  Martin Short is slightly abrasive as the town
lawyer.  Jason Lee as town entrepreneur may be familiar as the clueless
Banky from CHASING AMY.</P>
<P>     This will not be one of Kasdan's more memorable scripts, but it is
certainly a pleasant way to spend an hour or two.  I rate it a 6 on the
0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
