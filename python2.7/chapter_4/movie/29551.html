<PRE>TAPE
----</PRE>
<P>When Jon (Robert Sean Leonard, "Much Ado About Nothing") returns to his
hometown of Lansing, Michigan as a rookie director represented in the town's
film festival, he meets up with his old high school buddy Vince (Ethan Hawke,
"Snow Falling on Cedars") who's also flown in for the event.  Once Jon's
arrived at Vince's motel room, pleasantries quickly devolve into character
judgements.  Mounting tension is escalated when Vince accuses Jon of not
only stealing his old girlfriend Amy (Uma Thurman, "The Golden Bowl"), but
of raping her.  When Vince finally gets Jon to admit the truth, he 
announce's Amy's imminent arrival, then tells Jon he's captured their
entire conversation on "Tape."</P>
<P>Adapted from his one act play by Stephen Belber, director Richard Linklater
("Before Sunrise") uses digital video technology to capture an intense
character study in real time.  This is an actors' piece and the cast of
three thrive in its environment.</P>
<P>We first meet Vince, a small time drug dealer/volunteer fireman, burning off
his manic energy with inter-bed pushups.  Jon, a seemingly more well-adjusted
young man, is dismayed to learn that Vince has broken up with Lynn, his
long time girlfriend, but agrees with her assessment that Vince 'has issues
that manifest themselves in violence.'  This begins a debate that clearly
shows Jon believes Vince is beneath him, an unambitious, immature slacker,
even as Jon back-pedals his words.  Vince, denying said charges while shooting
beers and rolling joints, slowly turns the tables on Jon, making us
reevaluate the other character as perhaps having a weaker moral fiber.  </P>
<P>But "Tape," never letting us rest, soon has us questioning Vince's objectives.
When Amy, a local assistant district D.A., arrives on the scene, things become</P>
<P>awkward until she's assessed the situation and gains the upper hand.  Amy
has yet a third take on their high school days before she makes a telephone
call that will once again spur character defining actions.</P>
<P>Ethan Hawke, an actor who recently has delivered moribund performances, is
charged as Vince, at once an overactive adolescent and pothead philosopher.
Linklater should remain Hawke's director of choice as he hasn't been this
good since "Before Sunrise."  Robert Sean Leonard deftly digs a hole of
Jon's own making, constantly trying to spin himself as a nice guy while his
true nature seeps out between his words.  Uma Thurman has less time to 
flesh out her character, but makes her Amy's flip flop, from vulnerable to
victorious, believable although she never attains her costars level of
empathy.</P>
<P>Belber's clever writing shifts our perceptions constantly throughout the film,
while cinematographer Maryse Alberti ("Joe Gould's Secret"), limited to the 
space of one motel room, keeps the visuals interesting and diverse, only 
stumbling with the choice of some whiplash pans late in the action.  
Linklater's direction is tight and he gives us a laugh on our way out with the</P>
<P>witty selection of Brenda Lee's "I'm Sorry" playing over the end credits.</P>
<P>"Tape" may be an actors' exercise, but Linklater and his cast make it a
workout worth watching.</P>
