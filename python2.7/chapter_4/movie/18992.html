<P>
Recently, about 2PM, I had this choice: I could continue watching the
Yankee game -- it was about the 4th inning, the Yankees had scored a
couple of runs, Cone was pitching well, but I wasn't paying that much
attention -- or I could also see a movie.</P>
<P>I was thinking of seeing "Deep Impact", mainly to see the big tidal
wave (I had noted the wave didn't seem to go much past, say, Fulton
Street, so I thought the Upper West Side would remain dry, but, really,
I had to confirm this), but with mixed reviews, I wasn't sure if I was
up to seeing a couple hours of people being reconciled with their
family members and working out various personal issues before the comet
hits.</P>
<P>[I actually am not sure how the movie ends, if the big comet hits or
not.  I think it'd be funny if it didn't hit, but no one told the folks
living in the big cave.  The could emerge two years later to find a
Walmart next to the entrance.  Laughter would ensue.]</P>
<P>So, skipping over "Deep Impact", I sat down down and watched
"Clockwatchers", one of those low-budget indies (it has to be since
Parker Posey is in it; before I'd use Steve Buscemi as the litmus test
appears, but now that he's appeared in the other big comet/meteor
movie, "Armageddon", this assay method is now in doubt).  This is a
neat film, very fun, especially in the first hour or so.  Basically,
it's the story of four 20-something temps working in a depressing
office.</P>
<P>The central character is Iris starts off the movie as a shy observer,
watching her fellow temps go about trying to kill time, meet men, etc.
In many cases, they're just going through life's motions: one of them
is getting married to someone who apparently just gives her expensive
gifts, a second claims to be an actress, though nothing apparently
comes from her auditions, and the third is there trying to get a
permanent job.  This third one, played by Parker Posey, verbalizes the
existential doubts they all seem to have: as a temp, they can vanish
and no one would notice or care.  Her quest for a permanent job, or at
very least a recommendation, is her desire to leave a mark in the
world.</P>
<P>Things take a darker turn when the job she'd been gunning for,
executive assistant, is given to a mousy new hire.  At the same time,
someone starts stealing things from the office -- paperweights, books,
the personal effects people have to decorate their cubicles, a very
special ball of rubberbands -- and suspicion falls automatically on the
temps.  As pressure mounts on them, as they're put under more careful
scrutiny, the work friendships they had formed shows cracks.</P>
<P>I don't find the film to be, say, a critique of the modern American
workplace, though it shows a lot of the absurd little things that
happen in offices.  It's not Dilbert.  Rather, the idea of people
existing in a void, unconnected in any meaningful way and going through
the motions of life, is its main theme, and the vagaries and darknesses
of the modern American workplace is simply the most opportune setting
for this existential limbo.  The office is where people look for deep
connections in this significant social space and fail to find it; for
this film the particulars of unconnectedness are distilled into these
temps.</P>
<P>Anyway, "Clockwatchers" is a good movie, very funny in parts.
Currently, it's on one of the cable movie channels this month.</P>
<P>Later, I turned on CNN, and notice that the Yankees had won.  I suppose
it was a good game.</P>
