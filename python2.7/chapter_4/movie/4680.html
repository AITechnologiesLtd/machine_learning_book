<P>This is definitely the best movie to be released last year(hey, I 
didn't see Crumb, so sue me). It speaks to the soul, humming softly at 
you, urging you to look inside and see if you'd do  the same thing as the 
figures on screen. Really. A powerful, moving piece of work every one 
who's ever felt the need for vengeance or justice in an unjust world 
should see just to show you how justice can be unjust, too.</P>
<P>The film opens as John Booth, convicted of manslaughter in a 
drunk-driving accident, is released from prison. We meet his parents, who 
love him very much, and obviously miss him. We see him as a tortured 
soul, guilty for what he did, for killing a little girl. We see him in 
flashbacks, beating his head against the bars of his cell, we see the 
scar this makes. He is a horribly depressed man,a  man in a lot of pain. </P>
<P>Then we meet Freddy Gale, one of the most complex characters 
Nicholson's dealt with in a long time. He is obsessed with fantasies of 
revenge. He's been counting off the days on a little wall calendar, 
waiting for Booth to get out. He's planned to kill him since the trial, 
for his daughter's death. He is man lost to his dreams. All he has is 
revenge, liquor, and the strip bars where he picks women up from time to 
time. His wife(Huston)has long-since divorced him an married another 
man(Robbie Robertson)and thinks Freddy has forgotten her and her other 
kids for what she sees as selfish wish-fulfillment fantasies. Huston 
looks more haggard in this role than I think I've ever seen her. She's 
been worn down by her husband's madness. </P>
<P>Booth meets a woman(Wright)at a party his friend(David Baerwald, 
nice touch)throws for him, and she falls in love with him, though he 
can't love because of his oppressive feelings of guilt. Gale eventually 
makes his way to Booth's trailer and tries to shoot him, but the gun 
won't fire. He gives Booth three days to live. The movie then follows 
both characters during the three days, with Wright's character trying to 
bring Booth back to some semblance of life and Nicholson's moving farhter 
and farther from life into a kind of dead-eyed obsession. The three days 
pass, and Booth decides he wants to live, so he runs. The best scene in 
the movie comes during this part.Nicholson chases him onto a bus, but, 
polite jewelery store owner and former family man that he is, he decides 
to sit down and wait for the bus to stop before pursuing Booth(he knows 
the consequences of killing Booth will probably be the chair,  but he 
still can't bring himself to go nuts on a bus--brilliant!). The ending is 
one of the most touching I've ever seen(though a little predictable). 
Penn has proven himself a fine director, and Nicholson has reaffirmed his 
status as a damn fine actor, too.</P>
<P>Coincidence, perhaps, that this film deals with the same basic 
idea as dead man walking(starring Penn)? I think not. And this one was 
released first. Hmmm....</P>
<P>This film may not be out in theaters any longer, but wait for it 
on video, because it's definitely worth your time. A fine film.</P>
