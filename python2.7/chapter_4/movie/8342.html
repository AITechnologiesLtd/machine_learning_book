<P>     AIR FORCE ONE is DAS BOOT director Wolfgang Petersen's third major 
Hollywood movie to feature a top American star.  (For the record, the 
previous two are IN THE LINE OF FIRE and OUTBREAK.)  One consistent 
aspect of Petersen's studio pictures is that he hasn't had any 
difficulty getting A-list talent (Clint Eastwood, Dustin Hoffman, 
Harrison Ford) to work for him, and there is a reason for this.  After 
watching AIR FORCE ONE, I am convinced that Petersen is one of the best 
action/thriller directors working today.  The thing that astonishes me 
the most is how much he can cull from so little.  Petersen has taken a 
script that can best be described as idiotically preposterous and, from 
this thin and lame-brained skeleton, has generated a moderately-
entertaining motion picture.  In the hands of a hack, AIR FORCE ONE 
could have turned into a major embarrassment.  As it is, the movie is a 
roller coaster ride for those who prefer not to think once the theater 
lights have dimmed.</P>
<P>     Even the most energetic and original action film is likely to 
foster a sense of deja vu.  It's the nature of the genre -- after all, 
there are only so many ways you can blow things up and stage shoot-outs.  
So it shouldn't come as a surprise that about 95% of AIR FORCE ONE seems 
familiar -- the film is a clear derivative of DIE HARD and EXECUTIVE 
DECISION.  The twist here is that the action hero isn't a down-on-his-
luck cop or an anti-terrorist PhD, he's the President of the United 
States.  And, although the script seems to have been written with Steven 
Segal in mind, somehow the film makers snagged Harrison Ford.  How?  
Well, I can think of two possible reasons.  First, a big paycheck can 
make almost any role look appealing.  Second, most American actors 
probably crave the opportunity to play the President (look at Ronald 
Reagan...).</P>
<P>     So how does Ford fare as the latest big-screen Commander-in-Chief?  
Better than the likes of Bill Pullman (INDEPENDENCE DAY), Ronny Cox 
(MURDER AT 1600), and Sam Waterston (THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY), but not up 
to the level of Michael Douglas (THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT) or Gene Hackman 
(ABSOLUTE POWER).  Ford's James Marshall is suitably charismatic and 
decisive, but he's too good to be true.  He has a code of ethics and, 
when he says stomach-churningly saccharine things like "Never again will 
I allow political self-interest to deter us from doing what is morally 
right," he actually means it.  Ford may be a good actor, but not even he 
can make us swallow a fantasy character like this.  </P>
<P>     The storyline is generic.  A military partnership between the 
United States and Russia has resulted in the capture of the dangerous 
and fanatical General Alexander Radek (Jurgen Prochnow, the captain from 
DAS BOOT), the self-appointed military dictator of Khazakstan.  A group 
of terrorists, led by the psychotic Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman), uses 
an elaborate ruse to get on board Air Force One for a trans-Atlantic 
trip from Moscow to Washington D.C.  Once the plane is in the sky, 
Korshunov (with a little inside help) takes over.  The President 
apparently escapes in an emergency pod, but, in reality, he's hiding out 
in the luggage compartment, ready to do battle single-handedly with the 
six bad guys, who are holding fifty passengers at gun point, including 
his wife (Wendy Crewson) and 12-year old daughter (Liesel Matthews).  
Back in the United States, the Vice President (Glenn Close) is doing her 
best to defuse the situation, but Korshunov is adamant:  he will kill 
one hostage every half-hour until Radek has been released.</P>
<P>     There are numerous occasions during AIR FORCE ONE when Petersen 
ratchets the tension up to a level where the viewer is likely to forget 
the imbecilic plot contrivances that have gotten the situation to this 
point, and just enjoy the action and adventure.  Unfortunately, every 
time dialogue and plot exposition interrupt the flow, we're reminded of 
how implausible the scenario is.  On top of that, the film is too long.  
The opening setup, which lasts nearly 30 minutes, is plodding (mainly 
because it's poorly written).  There's a little too much running around 
during the middle segment, and the movie's last third features no fewer 
than three endings.  </P>
<P>     The film belongs to Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman, both of whom 
turn in competent (albeit unexceptional) performances.  Neither has to 
stretch their range very far, since Ford is adept at playing the strong, 
competent hero, and Oldman has become typecast as the slightly-unhinged, 
scenery-chewing villain.  The supporting cast includes a number of 
familiar faces, but, other than Glenn Close, no one has much to do.  
William H. Macy, as a member of the President's military entourage, is 
especially underused.</P>
<P>     I had hoped that Petersen would bring some of the claustrophobic 
feel of DAS BOOT to AIR FORCE ONE (after all, both films take place 
almost entirely in the isolated confines of a cigar-shaped structure).  
However, rather than opting for the slow boil approach, Petersen has 
gone for high energy/low intelligence.  The result is passably 
entertaining, but not a standout.  AIR FORCE ONE offers two hours of 
flashy, instant gratification.  The only lingering effect is the 
slightly bad taste that occurs when you expect more from a film than it 
actually delivers.</P>
