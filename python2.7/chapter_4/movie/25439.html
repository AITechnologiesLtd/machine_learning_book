<PRE>TRIXIE
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>It takes unenviable skill to squander the talents of Emily Watson, Dermot
Mulroney, Nick Nolte, Nathan Lane, Will Patton, and Leslie Ann Warren, but
Alan Rudolph--ironically known for being an actor's director--has done
precisely that in his latest film, "Trixie."</P>
<P>Rudolph shouldn't take sole responsibility for this misfire, however.  Any
one member of this capable cast should have taken a look at his sorry
script and realized it just wouldn't play in Peoria (or anywhere else for
that matter).  There's plenty of potential here, as there always is with a
Rudolph story idea, but that potential got left in the dressing room, or on
the cutting room floor, or in the mind of the man who hasn't hit artistic
paydirt since 1988's "The Moderns."</P>
<P>Trixie (Watson) is an ineffective security guard with the darnedest
Chicago accent.  She takes a recuperative assignment in a lakeside casino
after witnessing her partner stabbed by a shoplifter and quickly becomes
involved with a stockpile of typical Rudolph oddballs.  We've got a pushy
ladykiller who hits on her (Mulroney, in the role Keith Carradine would
have played ten years ago).  We've got a smooth-talking lounge singer who
befriends her (Lane, who escapes with most of his dignity intact).  And
we've got a pleasure boatload of multicolored miscreants--Nolte as a
corrupt senator, Warren as a low-cut, washed-up diva, and Patton as...well,
the boat owner.</P>
<P>Warren, who's been in a couple of Rudolph pictures, is the most
underutilized of the impressive cast.  As Dawn Sloane she acts tipsy and
flaky on the boat, has a serious moment in a hotel room, and then she's
outta there.  Nolte's bent congressman borders on caricature, and Patton's
Red Rafferty is simply undefined.</P>
<P>What makes Trixie's character interesting, supposedly, is her propensity
to drop malapropisms at the drop of a bat, mangling metaphors and
butchering the English language every time she opens her mouth.  This is
not a particularly original idea, of course, but Rudolph overwrites it as
if he's just invented the palindrome.  If you can think of Trixie's
condition as a mental disease, a "Rain Man"-kind of syndrome, then you'll
feel more sympathetic towards her character.  But Trixie's constant abuse
of familiar sayings and incessant frowning every time someone says anything
the slightest bit contrary grow pat and predictable after about twenty
minutes (and the film is a long--a very long--two hours).</P>
<P>Murdering free speech isn't Trixie's only annoying habit, however.  If
she's not chewing wads of gum then she's sucking on a sodapop straw.  More
often than not she's doing both.</P>
<P>There are hints of what Rudolph might have been attempting when Trixie
waxes detective with Nolte's Senator Avery, Lane's Kirk Stans, and
Mulroney's Dex Lang.  Here the men's "straight" talk starts sounding not
unlike Trixie's botched babblings--maybe she's not so crazy sounding after
all?  But before long Rudolph loses all perspective with several multiple
endings and some out-of-leftfield zaniness in a restaurant kitchen that
recalls a Three Stooges movie.</P>
<P>With "Trixie," Alan Rudolph is reveling in redundancy.  Or, to quote his
overwritten heroine, "flogging a dead horse until it's dead."</P>
