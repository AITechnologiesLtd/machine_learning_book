<PRE>XIU XIU: THE SENT-DOWN GIRL
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Towards the end of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, there was a program to
send "Educated Youth" into the countryside.  Lasting almost a decade, this
cultural indoctrination was, one assumes, supposed to purge any remaining
remnants of bourgeois thought from these intellectuals.  (This same class
supplied the bulk of the protestors in the famous 1989 Tiananmen Square
tragedy.)</P>
<P>XIU XIU: THE SENT DOWN GIRL (TIAN YU), which tells the story of one such
educated youth, is actress Joan Chen's directorial debut.  The threadbare
script by Chen and Geling Yan is based on Yan's novel.  When the camera has
nothing else to do, it points itself to the sky giving us so many cloud
sequences that the picture could just as aptly be titled THE CLOUDS.</P>
<P>The movie starts off promisingly.  An educated girl named Xiu Xiu, who
appears to be somewhere in age between an older teenager and a young adult,
is sent to become a horse herder in a remote village.  The lovely Chinese
actress Lu Lu plays Xiu Xiu with an assured grace and a delicate style.  In
several scenes of heartfelt dialog the mother (Jie Gao) gives Xiu Xiu advice
and goods to take with her.  Noting the raw and inferior quality of toilet
paper Xiu Xiu is likely to encounter, her mother has traded her sugar
rations for a large supply of good quality toilet paper.  (This "good" paper
looks as rough as cheap paper towels in an American restroom.)</P>
<P>When we cut to the Educated Youths a year later, they are about to gather
under a tent to watch propaganda movies in which brave youths fight and sing
for the glory of Communism.</P>
<P>At this point we expect the depiction of Xiu Xiu's life to show it to be
harsh and inhospitable.  Instead Xiu Xiu looks more like a middle class girl
on an extended camping trip.  Chen stages scenes for maximum gloss and has
Xiu Xiu made up to look glamorous.  This works at cross proposes to what one
assumes is Chen's intent.</P>
<P>A typical workday for Xiu Xiu finds her lying on her back in a lush field of
colorful wildflowers.  Dressed in middle-class raiment and looking like a
million dollars, she idles away her time looking through her kaleidoscope.</P>
<P>Xiu Xiu lives in the middle of nowhere in a tent with Lao Jin (Lopsang), a
gentle man who had "his manhood cut off" when he was held prisoner by
Tibetan rebels.  Their warm, platonic relationship will be tested when she
brings a string of petty bureaucrats into the tent in an attempt to sleep
her way back home.</P>
<P>The widely acclaimed TO LIVE, which covers much of the same ground, makes
the tragic scenes as genuine as the joyful ones.  Chen coats the traumatic
moments with the same slick veneer she uses on the lighter ones, thus muting
any effect they have on the audiences.</P>
<P>The film's actors give everything asked and more.  And cinematographer Yue
Lu makes the film too gorgeous for its own good.  If you don't watch
yourself, you'll be wishing they had inducted you.  Chen makes living out
under the wide and starry sky look pretty appealing.</P>
<P>When you leave, you'll undoubtedly think of the beautiful and tranquil Xiu
Xiu with wildflowers dancing all around her.  That will likely be the memory
that remains, not her tragic moments.</P>
<P>XIU XIU: THE SENT DOWN GIRL runs 1:39.  The film is in Mandarin with English
subtitles.  It is rated R for strong sexual content and some profanity and
would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
