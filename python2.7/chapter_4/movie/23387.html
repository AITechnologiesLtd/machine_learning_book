"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P> Every film with Bette Midler should start with her driving off of a
cliff.  It could be a recurring cinematic gag – like when Kenny buys the
farm on each episode of South Park.  Somebody actually suggested that
Midler's new film Drowning Mona would be entertaining because she was
playing a character that was really despicable and obnoxious.  I
explained that Midler has already done despicable and obnoxious five
weeks ago in the atrocious Isn't She Great, and hinted that the
horse-faced diva probably wasn't even acting in either film.</P>
<P>Midler stars as Mona Dearly, a vindictive meanie from Verplanck, New
York, that terrorizes her family and anybody else stupid enough to cross
her path.  When Mona's Yugo takes a swan dive into the Hudson River and
the resulting investigation reveals that her brakes were tampered with,
everyone in the tiny burg becomes a suspect.  Husband Phil (William
Fichtner, Go) is having an affair with a slutty waitress named Rona
(Jamie Lee Curtis, Virus), so they both have a motive.  As does son Jeff
(Marcus Thomas, Palmetto), although I won't say why (even though Mona's
trailer shows it, the film saves it for the big final reel surprise).</P>
<P>Sheriff Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito, Man on the Moon) can't even rule out
his own daughter Ellen (Neve Campbell, Scream 3) or her fiancé Bobby
Calzone (Casey Affleck, 200 Cigarettes), the latter of whom owns a
struggling landscaping business with the lazy, dimwitted Jeff.  As Rash
investigates the crime, the film flashes back to show everybody's
individual beef with the late Mona.  The result is a sloppy whodunit
that tries too hard to be quirky and, instead, is a pretty darn dull
knock-off of Fargo.  Most of the funny parts are shown in the trailer
and, of course, the ending is pretty predictable.  The only surprise in
the film is that Affleck (Ben's brother) has the biggest role in the
film, despite four other names reading above Mona's title.</P>
<P>Mona is another weak big-screen directorial effort from Nick Gomez, who
has done some much better work on television (Homicide, The Sopranos and
OZ), and the paper-thin script was written by first-timer Peter
Steinfeld.  Mona was financed by DeVito's Jersey Films, a production
company the diminutive actor runs with Hollywood cohorts Michael
Shamberg and Stacy Sher.  While Jersey has pumped out some of the best
cinema in recent years (Gattaca, Pulp Fiction and Out of Sight), they're
also creating a disturbing trend by casting their littlest partner in
their projects that are, at best, mediocre (Get Shorty, Man on the Moon
and Living Out Loud).  DeVito isn't in Jersey's upcoming Erin
Brockovich, so you may just want to save your money for that film.</P>
<P>1:30 - PG-13 for some thematic elements, language and brief sexuality</P>
