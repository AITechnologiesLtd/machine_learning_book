<P>   "Gadjo Dilo," which in the Romany language of the gypsies
means "crazy outsider," is a film for people who like music--
not "light FM" or elevator music, but the pulsating tones of a
people who cry out because their soul is in pain.  In that
respect it resembles the mournful cries of the cantaor in
Spanish flamenco and can easily be mistaken for a variety of
songs common to Turkey and the Middle East as well as
southeastern Europe.  Yet "Gadjo Dilo" is not really driven by
the music.  If you had seen the second film in writer-director
Tony Gatlif's trilogy on gypsy themes, "Latcho Drum," you
would know what a music-driven film is all about.  This
picture, for all its humor and song and drunken reverie ends
on a melodramatic note: if you treat it as metaphor for the
frequent bouts of ethnic cleansing that has devastated Europe
and parts of Africa in recent decades, you'd have to call
"Gadjo Dilo" an out-and-out tragedy.</P>
<P>   The film works on many levels, given the sincere and
realistic acting by its three principals: Stephane (Romain
Duris), a handsome young Parisian traveling through remote
regions of Romania in search of a singer; Izidor (Isidor
Serban), an elderly tribal leader of a gypsy village pining for
his jailed son and most of all for himself; and Sabrina (Rona
Hartner), who symbolizes a modern women free from the
strictures of her gypsy culture who dances, laughs, cries and
makes love with equal passion.</P>
<P>   The story, inspired by the travels of a musicologist friend of
the director, opens as Stephane walks through an isolated,
snowy road to a gypsy village, perhaps all the way from
Bucharest.  A musicologist in search of a particular gypsy
singer famous even in France, he stumbles upon a band of
lively women in colorful native garb who spout bawdy
invectives at him from their horse-driven cart, laughing all the
way.  When he reaches the town, he runs into an old man,
Izidor, who insists that he would die rather than leave his
bottle of vodka anything but empty and shares a drink with
him.  Quickly becoming the best of friends with the man,
Stephane temporarily replaces Izidor's son who had been
sentenced to six months in jail.  At first treated with suspicion
by the townspeople who ironically accuse him of the same
sorts of thefts by which gypsies are traditionally charged, he
decides to remain as Izidor's guest, learns a good deal of the
language, and is accepted by the community.  (The process is
an arresting reversal of the typical pattern which finds third-
worlders seeking havens in more prosperous areas of the
world and, in fact, shares a commonality with the American
hippies who shed their wealth during the early seventies to
experience nirvana in the East.)</P>
<P>   Until the dire concluding section of the piece, "Gadjo Dilo"
plays like a kaleidoscopic travelogue as Stephane
experiences the culture of these people and internalizes some
of their values, manifested particularly in a poignant dance
around a makeshift gravesite when the French expatriate
pours vodka over some buried tapes as would a native.  </P>
<P>   As Sabrina, Rona Hartner--actually a fairly accomplished
actress now living in Paris--turns in some breathtaking steps
in the countryside and in night clubs, and in the process falls
in love with the so-called crazy outsider and does he with her. 
Since life often follows art, we learn from the press notes that
Romain Duris, a positively fetching performer, actually fell in
love with Ms. Hartner, causing scripter Gatlif to rewrite some
parts in a brief period of time.  </P>
<P>   Perhaps the most fascinating scene in the movie comes
when the father of a woman about to be married threatens to
kill the bridegroom and his party with an axe, screaming that
no way will he give up his little girl.  Other fascinating gypsy
values include throwing money freely at performers in night
clubs and calling Stephane a "faggot" for cleaning the house
in which he is a guest.</P>
<P>   "Gadjo Dilo" is a enchanting film that shows its relatively
low budget only in the overly choppy editing that takes us
from one colorful scene to the next.  Perhaps Gatlif is not
entirely objective in his virtual worship of the gypsy way of life,
his evocation of a people who actually take the expression
"life is a banquet" seriously--but who'd want him to do
otherwise?   The film is in Romany (with a smattering of
French and Romanian) with English titles.  Not Rated. 
Running time: 97 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
