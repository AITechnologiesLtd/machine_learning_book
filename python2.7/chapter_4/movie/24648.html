<PRE>                                ROAD TRIP
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<PRE>     Tom Green might say: Road Trip is the greatest movie of all time.</PRE>
<PRE>     He'd be right.  If you're a 15-year old boy.</PRE>
<P>     Treading on the thinnest of plots, Road Trip fully earns its
obvious comparisons to American Pie, There's Something About Mary, and
even Animal House -- with one gross-out, slapstick scenario after
another, all wedged into a tight 90 minutes of running time.</P>
<P>     Witness our college-aged hero Josh (Go's Breckin Meyer), who
figures his long-distance girlfriend Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) has
blown him off, leading him into a night of passion with local girl Beth
("Felicity"'s Amy Smart).  When the ensuing sex tape (why must there
always be evidence?) is mailed to Tiffany in error, the titular road
trip begins, as Josh must make the 1,800 mile trek from Ithaca, NY to
Austin, TX and be back in time for midterms.  And what's a road trip
without a bunch of guys along for the ride?  And no money!?  (If you've
seen Overnight Delivery -- same thing.)</P>
<P>     Highlights from the trip include an exploding car, a sperm bank, a
visit to an all-black frat house, a little Viagra (though not in
conjunction with the sperm bank), and a stolen bus for the blind -- all
narrated by Tom Green, who has stayed behind in order to feed a pet
snake.</P>
<P>     The acting, the line delivery, the music -- everything is as it
should be here.  Constantly we are reminded that we are not watching the
comedy of Woody Allen or Albert Brooks.  We are watching a "Beavis and
Butt-head" episode played by real-life actors.  Only funnier.  And
cruder.</P>
<P>     Thank god, each scene of Road Trip is played to its comedic
terminus.  Sometimes this is clever, often it's funny, and invariably
it's rude and disgusting.  If you aren't prepared for balls-out juvenile
humor -- and lots of it -- Road Trip is not going to entertain you.  If
you actually want a story, go read a book.  But if you want to see a bit
of nudity and a lot of potty humor, Road Trip ought to help you make it
through the summer.</P>
