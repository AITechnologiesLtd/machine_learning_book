<PRE>                             THREE COLORS: WHITE
                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1995 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<P>     Bookended as it is by BLUE and RED, the second film in
Kieslowski's liberty/equality/fraternity trilogy is a welcome relief
from the sometimes tragic sensibility of the other two films.  WHITE is
about post-Communist Poland.  It is about the tricks that hold up our
own quests for "equality" (is there really such a thing outside of
mathematics?).  But most of all, it's a love story.</P>
<P>     Of course, all three of the films are love stories in a way;
but BLUE is a love story that ends as the film begins, and RED is a
love story once removed.  WHITE is a story about stubborn love, a sort
of co-dependent relationship that endures despite the best efforts of
both lovers.  Zbigniew Zamachowski plays Karol Karol, the impotent
hairdresser who is abandoned in Paris by wife Julie Delpy.  Unable to
support himself, the spurned lover eventually returns to his native
Poland, smuggling himself in inside a friend's suitcase.  Seething with
resentment, he makes a fortune in his newly capitalist homeland, and
then sets off on an elaborate plan to revenge himself on his wife.
Kieslowski makes some wry observations about the nature of capitalism
and the lust for "easy money." Karol doesn't simply want to make
himself the financial equal of his wife; he wants to become "more
equal" than she is.  That being the case, it's not enough for him
simply to make a fortune.  He wants to humiliate her, as well.</P>
<P>     He manages that, but the circumstances are an idiosyncratic
delight.  WHITE isn't lofty enough to avoid an occasional detour into
sober, existential territory, but the side trips add a little weight to
the story, which is at heart a marriage farce.  The sublime Zamachowski
pulls his best Chaplin routine here, and it pays off charmingly.  It's
no surprise that Delpy is radiant, and plays the ice queen well (my
favorite shot of Delpy is still her cameo in RED, where all three films
touch briefly).  In most ways, this film is the least of the trilogy --
WHITE is so conciliatory toward its audience that it threatens to float
away.  But at the end, it's anchored by a Chaplinesque moment of
revelation that justifies our attention and respect, and this film's
solid place in Kieslowski's admirable trilogy.</P>
