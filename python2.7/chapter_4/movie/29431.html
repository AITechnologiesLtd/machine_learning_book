<PRE>LIFE AS A HOUSE
A film review by Norm Schrager
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>The good news for George, a middle-aged, washed up architect, is that an
enormous life change has motivated him to connect with his horrible
teenage son and build a house by the ocean.  The bad news is that the
change is terminal cancer.  The good news for moviegoers is that Irwin
Winkler's Life As A House is filled with sharp, solid acting, a decent,
sometimes harsh, script, and a few surprises.  The bad news is that
anything worth seeing here lives within an uneven sap of a film, unable
to break free from the traditional Hollywood devices.</P>
<P>But much of Life As A House is completely watchable.  Mark Andrus's
script (he's written As Good As It Gets and the underrated, rarely seen
Late For Dinner) appears cookie-cutter: he gives us the lazy, lonely,
eccentric nobody (Kevin Kline); his estranged family, including
beautiful ex-wife (Kristin Scott Thomas) and alienated teen (Hayden
Christensen); and his predictably uptight neighbors, pissed off that his
ramshackle of a house has stood in their beautiful oceanside
neighborhood for twenty years.</P>
<P>But Andrus gives the telling a hard edge from the get-go, which keeps
Life As A House interesting in the first act.  Kline, who we're used to
seeing as generally kind-hearted, blurts to neighbor Mary Steenburgen,
"How far did you just have to stick your head out the window in order to
see my dick?!" after he uses God's ocean as his own personal
receptacle.  In the same introduction, George's son Sam (Christensen,
soon appearing as a little-known character called Anakin Skywalker),
wearing heavy eye makeup, sniffs glue, applies a noose, and attempts to
pleasure himself.  This is stuff I'd expect from David O. Russell (Three
Kings), not Irwin Winkler (The Net).</P>
<P>Life As A House goes south, however, as soon as young Sam, softens for
his Dad. When George, upon getting the news of his impending demise,
decides to replace the old shack, he forces Sam to spend the summer with
him.  The fact that he's erecting a house at the same time he wants to
build a relationship with his son, and reconstruct his emotional
architecture as well, is painfully blatant.  At the very least, however,
Andrus's script is smart enough to make mention of the parallel: Sam, in
being asked to help knock down the house says to George, "You're just
trying to tear down your father."  George's reply: "You should try it." 
[See also the title of the film... -Ed.]</P>
<P>Andrus's reputation for good dialogue, and there is some above-average
stuff here, must have convinced some name actors to take wasted, bit
parts.  Steenburgen, Scott Bakula, Jamey Sheridan, and Sam Robards
could've probably taken meatier, more meaningful roles elsewhere (even
if Steenburgen does get to show off her finely-aged body).</P>
<P>And as competently good as Kline's and Christensen's performances are,
(and I believe Christensen is a real find), they're overrun by
poorly-timed, heart-tugging music, and choppy direction (will somebody
please stop the overuse of slow-motion!?).  Winkler alternates between
the standard camera setup you've seen before, and a feigned attempt at
Altmanesque, herky-jerky "verité."  It's messy.</P>
<P>There are a few sequences -- one in particular has a variety of
characters jumping into each other's beds -- that definitely raise
eyebrows and keep the proceedings interesting.  But for every leap into
exciting waves of edgier content, there are too many jumps into the
giant movie ocean of mediocrity.</P>
<P>Reviewed as part of our Boston Film Festival coverage (feature story
coming soon).</P>
