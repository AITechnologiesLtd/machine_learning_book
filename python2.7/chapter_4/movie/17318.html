<P>It's just a matter of time before this movie concept actually materializes
itself into the fabric of our real life cable network channels, but until
that time, I guess we have to settle for the always reliable direction of
Ron Howard, a script by the kings of harmless comedies, Babaloo Mandel and
Lowell Ganz (based on the French film, LOUIS 19), and the acting chops of a
wide range of Hollywood thespians.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Regular Johnny Lunchpail dude gets paid by a cable network channel to
televise his entire life on TV as it happens live. He agrees and ultimately
turns into a media sensation and major celebrity in the eyes of the millions
of people that watch him daily. These changes affect every relationship in
his life, including the most significant one with a woman who touches his
heart, but not those of his fickle TV viewing audience.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Light, safe, enjoyable romantic comedy with a good premise, charming leads,
offers just enough cute, cuddly and funny moments to satisfy the general
population. Now despite clocking in at a heftier time than anticipated (2
hours+), I think this movie works particularly well because of the potent
acting talents of its two main stars, Matthew McConaughey and Jenna Elfman.
Admittedly, I was never a fan of Elfman before this film, but she gives a
great, loveable performance that most everyone should enjoy. And yes, I even
thought she looked adorable in that UPS outfit! McConaughey also punches up
the film with his authentic performance of Joe America, with the ideal
balance of charisma, humor and drama. The rest of the cast is also pretty
solid in their roles, but I felt that the amplitude of characters left some
to be underdeveloped. For example, the Woody Harrelson role started off
strong, but ended pretty flat, while Rob Reiner's character seemed like a
one-dimensional cookie-board cutout role generally used to satisfy the
screenwriters' need for an audience-satisfying retribution finish, which
didn't leave much to the imagination.</P>
<P>Having said that, this film had me chuckling and even laughing along for
most of its run, with the title of Woody Harrelson's book in the film,
generating my hardiest guffaw. There are also plenty of cameos sprinkled
throughout this party which seemed to resonate an overall sense of easy and
clean humor (The lack of uninhibited sex, violence and open vulgarity
obviously well calculated.) The soundtrack seemed like a constant, with
every other scene containing a new song, and the style, pretty
straightforward. And even though I don't particularly recall one superior
scene or even one hoppin' song from the movie, I can say that it was
entertaining, and that it should pull in some decent numbers at the
box-office. Go see it with your loved one. It's safe, it's fun, and nobody
gets hurt. Hi Mom!</P>
