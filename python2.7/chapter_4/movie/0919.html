<PRE>                                 GREEN CARD
                              [Mild spoilers]
                       A film review by Mark Kosten
                        Copyright 1991 Mark Kosten</PRE>
<P>     Peter Weir (last seen directing DEAD POETS SOCIETY) brings
together Gerard Depardieu (probably the most popular actor in France)
and Andie MacDowell (from SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE) in this
Australian/French co-production.  It is set in New York and is
essentially a love story.   Depardieu plays George, who manages to stay
legally in the U.S. and obtain a green card by a convenience marriage
to Bronte (MacDowell).  They part after the marriage but some time later
have to spend some days together to learn about each other because the
INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) is checking up on them.
Naturally they start off disliking each other because they are so
different.  The rest is fairly obvious, and, despite the predictable and
unoriginal story, a delight to watch.</P>
<P>     The film has a light and relaxed touch, aided immeasurably by
Depardieu's lightness of acting, especially body language, despite his
bulk.  You find yourself being carried along with a smile on your face
as the two principal characters argue, reveal their pasts and foibles
and begin to fall in love.  The music is terrific, which is a mixture of
classical, particularly the well-suited Mozart, and modern
electronic/new age.  At one point, when George and Bronte are in their
separate beds, but thinking of each other, the original music (by Hans
Zimmer) is almost entirely responsible for the emotional charge of the
scene.  Indeed, music plays an important role in the story, culminating
in George's dilemma at showing off non-existent composing skills at a
party, which is brilliantly solved.</P>
<P>     The dialogue is okay and minor characters are underwritten, both
typical Weir problems.  The scenes with Bronte's father and George in
particular seem unfinished.</P>
<P>     Overall, a very enjoyable film.  I strongly recommend GREEN CARD.</P>
