<PRE>Review by Victory A. Marasigan</PRE>
<P>Young Kat Stratford is Padua's resident evil ice queen.  Bianca
Stratford is her seemingly more down-to-earth younger sister.  Bianca
has caught the attention of Cameron, a gawky newcomer who endeavors to
court her the first time he sees her.  Cameron's quest for Bianca has
hit a snag: her father won't allow her to date.  With some prodding by
his daughter Bianca and her hopeful suitor, the patriarch of the
Stratford family slyly agrees to a deal knows he'll never have to
honor: Bianca can date when Kat dates.  Fearless, Cameron takes on the
challenge of making the apparently incorrigible Kat fall in love with
someone.</P>
<P>Sound familiar?  It should, because 10 Things I Hate About You, a
comedy from director Gil Junger, is a thinly-veiled adaptation/homage
to Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew.  This version of the story
takes place amongst hip teens at Padua High, a fictional public school
in Seattle.  Given the kitschy premise, it's surprising that 10 Things
manages to be a funny, endearing movie on par with Clueless or even
Fast Times at Ridgemont High.</P>
<P>The "shrew" in this retelling is played with infectious energy by
newcomer Julia Stiles.  As the angel-in-witch's-clothing Kat, Stiles
gets to be both wicked and gentle, slowly revealing the lovelorn
softie behind her character's rigid mask in fleeting, satisfying
emotive bursts.  The guy responsible for Kat's transformation is
Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), the long-haired loner who has
reluctantly accepted money to date her.  Ledger seems a virtual clone
of Marky Mark Wahlberg, with a soft-voiced Aussie accent substituted
for Bostonian.  Oddly enough, Stiles and Ledger have a charming
on-screen chemistry, even when she's throwing up on his shoes.</P>
<P>Joseph Gordon-Levitt ("3rd Rock From the Sun") is pitiful -- in a good
way -- as Cameron, the transfer student whose simple plan to date the
lovely Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) backfires messily.  He's
unintimidating, his voice cracks just a little bit, and he looks like
he's never dated anyone his entire life (Try to picture Ryan Philippe
playing the same part and you get a hint of the wisdom of 10 Things'
casting directors).</P>
<P>The thematic elements of The Taming of the Shrew -- the social
conditioning of women, family politics, the gender battle of wills --
have been nicely updated for a modern audience.  This contrasts
starkly with 1996's William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet, whose
too-strict adherence to the text practicially negated the story's
relevance to the film's ultra-modern setting.  Junger and writers
Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith have made their characters and
story engaging enough that the original Elizabethan-era inspiration
seems more of a noteworthy suggestion than a direct influence.</P>
<P>Here is that once-in-a-blue-moon instance of a film whose fresh cast
is able to carry the film in spite of a totally predictable plotline.
Had a more recognizable, older crop of actors (read: Jennifer Love
Hewitt, James Van Der Beek, or anybody on the WB Network) been chosen
to fill the lead roles, this film's tried-and-true teen-movie cliches
and stock characters would probably be harder to stomach.</P>
<P>The actors not only look like real teens -- they talk and act like
them as well.  Though there are winking dialogue references to the
original source material sprinkled throughout, the script for the most
part shuns the "Dawson's Creek"-inspired trend of having young
characters talk like post-collegiate philosophers.  Let's hope that
Hollywood gets the drift that teens need not be portrayed by actors
who cop adult attitudes and radiate squeaky-clean winsomeness to be
appealing.</P>
