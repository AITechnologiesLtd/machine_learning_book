<P>Rating: 80 %
Starring: Will Smith   Gene Hackman   Jon Voight
Director: Tony Scott
We in Cape Town have had our own experience of the type of surveillance as
portrayed in Enemy of the State. Six alleged Pagad G-Force members were
recently arrested following the monitoring of their movements by the
Business Against Crime surveillance cameras. Big Brother is definitely alive
and watching our every movement here in sunny South Africa.</P>
<P>In the director Tony Scott's movie Enemy of the State, the central question
is how much invasion of privacy the state can be allowed to do. Is it right
for the state to monitor every nook and cranny of its citizen's lives in the
pursuit of protecting the country against those who seek to harm her. The
movie kicks off when a prominent government official is assassinated because
he is preparing to oppose Jon Voight character, who is seeking more leeway
into prying in the daily lives of the ordinary citizens of the United
States. Will Smith, portrays a lawyer who also uses illegally obtained
surveillance footage to leverage himself and his clients into a position of
strength against some shady Mafia figures.</P>
<P>When through a chain of events Will Smith comes in possession of the
evidence of the government officials murder, his life is thrown into turmoil
as the corrupt NSA agency head uses all the means of the modern spy
apparatus to regain the evidence from him.</P>
<P>What really makes Enemy of the State such an engrossing movie is not the
slick editing and well staged action scenes which makes the Jerry
Bruckheimer production move at a cracking pace. The real success of the
movie is to show how computer geeks locked away in dark rooms surrounded by
the most expensive digital toys their governments can buy, can
systematically destroy the illusion of ordinary day to day life that we take
for granted.</P>
<P>The irony of Enemy of the State is that for Will Smith's character to
retrieve himself out of the predicament he is in, he has to fight fire with
fire. With the help of Gene Hackman's character he gains the necessary know
how to defeat the enemy. The message one can get from this, is heaven help
the poor souls who become the target of the government's focus to destroy
them. If you can't hack a computer or call up spy satellite to aid your
fight, you might as well give up.</P>
<P>I really enjoyed Enemy of the State. If only half of the things shown in the
movie are true, you better hope you don't stay in a country with a
government too keen in using the latest hi tech gadgets against their
citizens.</P>
