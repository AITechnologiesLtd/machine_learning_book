"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Clint Eastwood has had a pretty spotty directorial record since he won
an Oscar for 1992's Unforgiven.  The movie about the bridges aside,
Eastwood has stayed behind the camera for two fantastic period films (A
Perfect World and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil) and directed
himself in two modern-day duds (True Crime and Absolute Power).  So the
prospect of the leathery legend helming himself in another contemporary
picture didn't exactly have me racing to get to the theatre.</P>
<P>But Space Cowboys isn't too bad.  The film is about four geriatric,
ex-Air Force pilots who get blasted into space to repair a Russian
satellite that is even more decrepit than they are.  If you liked Walter
Matthau and Jack Lemmon volleying jokes back and forth about
incontinence and false teeth in Grumpy Old Men, then you'll probably
love Cowboys.  Since they don't even make it into space until the film's
final thirty minutes, Cowboys is more about the men training for their
mission than the actual space undertaking.</P>
<P>Cowboys' first section might be its best, which is kind of odd
considering the fact that none of the four stars appear in this part of
the film.  The studio's colorless logo leads into a black-and-white
scene set in 1958, where two Air Force test pilots from Team Daedalus
crash a $4 million X-2 experimental airplane (their third accident in
ten months).  Young actors portray the near-ambulatory stars, who supply
only their voices to this section of Cowboys, in which we learn that the
Air Force is handing over the task of space exploration to the
newly-founded NASA and their space monkey.</P>
<P>Flash to 1999, where old codger Frank Corvin (Eastwood) is approached by
two NASA representatives that need his prehistoric expertise.  It seems
that Ikon, a Russian communication satellite that was created using
Corvin's antiquated guidance system created for the Skylab project some
four decades earlier, is on a collision course with Earth, and NASA
needs the ex-pilot to tell them how to fix it.</P>
<P>Corvin refuses to help NASA unless they let his Team Daedalus
participate in the mission.  NASA reluctantly agrees, and Corvin rounds
up his old cohorts – maniacal pilot-turned-crop-duster `Hawk' Hawkins
(Tommy Lee Jones, Rules of Engagement); former navigator `Tank' Sullivan
(James Garner, My Fellow Americans), who is now a Baptist minister; and
Jerry O'Neil (Donald Sutherland, Instinct), a skirt-chasing roller
coaster designer with Coke-bottle glasses who was a structural engineer.</P>
<P>Like I said, most of the film concentrates on the flock of fossils
training for their big mission, and most of Cowboys' laughs come from
these scenes.  It's funny to watch them go through the
turn-your-head-and-cough drill during their physical, and there's a
pretty good recurring theme in which the geezers find out that pretty
much everyone they've ever worked with is dead.</P>
<P>Once Team Daedalus gets up into space, Cowboys turns into a predictable
cross between Armageddon and Mission to Mars.  There's the obligatory
`I'm gettin' to old for this' line, as well as a really creepy romance
between Hawk and a NASA engineer played by Marcia Gay Harden (Meet Joe
Black).  Both would have been better left on the editing room floor.
It's just plain weird to see the effect-heavy finale in an Eastwood
film, but it's handled pretty well.</P>
<P>Cowboys' script was written by Ken Kaufman (Muppets From Space) and
first-timer Howard Klausner.  Almost all of the technical aspects of the
film (editing, score, cinematography, production design) were handled by
a crew that has worked on all of Eastwood's recent films.  One
surprising omission from Cowboys is the absence of the Steve Miller Band
song that shares the same name as the film's title.</P>
<P>On an interesting note, there's a nineteen-year real-life age difference
between Team Daedalus' oldest and youngest member (Garner is 72; Jones
is 53).  Even thought they're supposed to be similarly aged, Garner was
in college while Jones was in diapers.  The math gets even crazier when
you figure that Garner, Eastwood (70) and Sutherland (66) were getting
bossed around by superiors that were a lot younger than them (The Green
Mile's James Cromwell is 60, and Knot's Landing's William Devane is 59,
but both played NASA men that were around back in '58).</P>
<PRE>2:03 - PG-13 for adult language and a shot of some really saggy old
asses</PRE>
