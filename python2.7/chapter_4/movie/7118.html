                       A film review by Vince Deehan
                        Copyright 1997 Vince Deehan</PRE>
<P>Written and Directed by Todd Haynes. Cast:  Julianne Moore,  Xander
Berkeley,  Steven Gilborn, Peter Dunning,  Kate McGregor Stewart 
and James LeGros.</P>
<P>I have heard many good things said about [SAFE], with people often 
either wildly in love with the movie or completely bored by it.  I found
this reaction quite intriguing since films which can provoke such a different
response in people  are usually  worth watching, if only to see which 
response you will give.  I had the chance to see Todd Haynes'
film POISON last year at London's National Film Theatre and I have to say
that I did not enjoy it.  In fact, I was literally desperate to get out of the 
cinema - I really couldn't wait for it to end.  This was an unusually strong 
reaction for me, normally films either interest or bore me but I can usually 
manage to wait patiently till the end before leaving the cinema.  With this in 
mind, I have avoided seeing [SAFE] until now, but I have seen so many positive 
comments about this film lately that I thought I'd give it a shot.  I am 
delighted to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it and I would recommend the 
film to others.</P>
<P>[SAFE] tells the story of a Texan housewife (or "home-maker" as she
prefers to call herself) Carol White , played by Julianne Moore.  She now 
lives in California with her husband Greg (Xander Berkeley) and his
son Rory.   Carol seems a bit vacant and has a baby-doll voice which
was almost grating at first, but I soon got used to it.  When we first meet
Carol she seems very fragile but is well enough, but soon she starts
to become weak and listless and is overcome by a coughing fit when
out driving one day.  She also gets a spontaneous nose-bleed at
the hairdresser and gets what seemed to me to be a panic attack (but
apparently was extreme difficulty in breathing) whilst at a friends
birthday party.  Her own doctor can find nothing wrong with her 
and sends her off to a psychiatrist, thinking that her problems
are really psychological.  The psychiatrist is terribly unhelpful  and
tries to get Carol to do all the talking with no prompting, which
the very reticent Carol finds very difficult.</P>
<P>Carol happens upon a flier in her local gym which talks about
the effects of fumes on people's health.  Carol writes to these people and
soon she discovers that she probably has Environmental Illness, which
is the term used to describe people who have become intolerant of some of the 
chemicals in use in everyday life.  Not long after Carol suffers what appears 
to be a total body allergic reaction , or anaphylactic shock, when she walks 
into her dry-cleaners whilst it is in the process of being fumigated.  This
serious life threatening reaction gets her taken into hospital immediately, 
where her own doctor is still unable to find anything wrong with her. He is 
aware that Carol is clearly hyper-sensitive to certain chemicals but says 
that he can find no evidence that her immune system is being attacked or 
depressed.  Not long after this Carol admits herself to a safe haven she has 
heard of in the desert, where other people with her problem can retreat to, 
for a cleaner environment. </P>
<P>At the retreat, called Wrenwood, she is immediately welcomed by the staff
and she at last feels that her problem is being acknowledged.  At the 
Wrenwood she meets Peter Dunning who is described, in the film,  as being a 
chemically sensitive man with AIDS.  Peter acts as leader for the group and 
gives talks on how best to approach their healing.  His belief is that as 
the outside world is cold, cynical and hateful it is therefore best to 
look within ourselves to heal ourselves.  He teaches them that in some 
way we are the cause of our own illnesses and that if we are full of 
anger and hate that this may trigger off illness and will certainly be a 
hindrance to any possible healing. The director of the haven, Claire, is 
also environmentally sensitive and tells Carol soon after she arrives , 
that her own healing was greatly helped by nurturing her ability to love 
herself.</P>
<P>I am fully aware, as I write, that much of the last few sentences sound 
terribly corny, but the beauty of this film is that it doesn't treat these 
notions of self-help as anything but a completely viable and sensible form of 
treatment and, given that there is no conventional treatment for their illness, 
it seems totally plausible that these ideas may have much merit.</P>
<P>The illness itself, Environmental Illness, is very real although it may well 
have a different medical term. I know of one case in this country (the UK) 
where one lady was no longer able to live in her own home because of her 
intolerance to certain chemicals and now has to live in a specially designed 
safe tent where she can live much more safely.  The disease is very tragic 
because it is basically an allergy to everyday life and therefore has 
devastating effects on its sufferers who may be unable to live with their 
families in case they bring them into contact with some chemical which may 
trigger a dangerous allergic reaction.  Indeed, in the film we see that Carol 
is barely able to hug her husband because of a chemical which she thought may 
have been in his cologne. </P>
<P>I can't help but feel that I am perhaps taking this film to literally and that 
there is an underlying meaning that I am missing, but I don't know what it is.  
This bothers me since I feel certain that I am missing something, perhaps
something profound .  Other reviews have , I think, spoken of the illness 
as a possible metaphor for AIDS. I guess the fact that the immune system 
seems to be affected in both diseases and that both illnesses can cause 
people to be excluded from society (although excluded for different 
reasons : the environmentally ill because of the pollutants in society and 
AIDS sufferers because of some people's prejudiced views) would lead 
people to think this.  I feel that this was probably not Todd Haynes' 
intention , not least because one of the sufferers in the film is said to 
have AIDS.  I'll have to check out other people's reviews to see what other 
people think about this.</P>
<P>The soundtrack to the film is wonderful and was written and performed by Ed 
Tomney. It's mostly synthesisers and just sounds so right for the movie.   The 
cinematography by Alex Nepomniaschy is very crisp and clear with some 
wonderful images of the desert landscape around the retreat. I particularly 
liked the quick shots of the passing towns and countryside as Carol
travelled to the retreat.  One odd thing about the movie was that there were 
virtually no close-ups of the actors faces.  This is unusual and is something 
I haven't noticed before.  The strange thing about it is that for much 
of the movie  I had a hard time recognising Carol's husband from scene to 
scene because we never get to see his face close enough to really register 
his features.  Over the course of the movie I began to register his face more 
through repeated exposure, but I found this strange and I am  not entirely 
sure what the point of this was. This applied to all the actors, who we 
never get that close too in the frame.  In particular, I didn't recognise
the actor James LeGros until after 10 minutes into his appearance 
simply because we never really got a good close look at his face.  I think 
I liked this effect but I am at a loss as to  explain why the director 
chose this style and to what significance we are meant to attach to it.</P>
<P>Julianne Moore gives a great performance as Carol and is, I think, in every
single scene of the film.  It says a lot for her immense talents as an actress 
that she can create an interesting character who says not very much and is 
fairly inarticulate and yet she holds our attention throughout the film.  Kate 
McGregor Stewart was great as the retreat director and was particularly
touching when she gave Carol some advice on how best to approach her 
healing.  James LeGros is a very versatile actor who seems to change his 
appearance a lot , you'd hardly recognise him from his roles as the 
flashy actor in LIVING IN OBLIVION and as  Kyra Sedgwick's college friend 
in SINGLES.  LeGros was very good in a small role as a fellow sufferer who 
cooked up a pasta supper with Carol for the whole retreat one night.  
He also gives a surprise birthday cake to Carol which leads to Carol 
giving a just about coherent thank you speech.  Julianne Moore's acting 
here was terrific as she falteringly spoke in disjointed sentences that 
seemed utterly natural.  </P>
<P>Todd Haynes' script was very sharp , every word was vital to the story and
there was no pointless chatter put in for the sake of it. His writing of 
Carol's birthday speech was particularly brilliant.  I would imagine that 
this film will not be to all tastes because not a great deal happens and the 
whole film unfolds quite slowly but I found the whole film engrossing. The 
central ideas that we can assist in our own healing is certainly not a new 
idea in medicine but it is one that doesn't get talked about much, and I 
was glad that this film chose to do so.</P>
