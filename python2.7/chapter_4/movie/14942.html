<PRE>Ronin</PRE>
<P>Ronin sports one of the best car chases in recent memory.  The chase
(the film's third) has cars speed in and out of tunnels, in wrong
directions on major highways, and through narrow, scenic
pedestrian-littered streets.  It conjures up memories of _The French
Connection_, _To Live and Die in L.A._ and _Speed_ all at once, and
further transcends them due to its distinctively Euro look.  The ride is
thrilling.  The accidents are devastating.  And yet, there's something
so, so, plastic and nihilistic about the whole setup.</P>
<P>I mention this because _Ronin_ wants to be the first _Pulp Fiction_
clone hitting the foreign espionage circuit.  Like _Fiction_, it sports
an excellent diverse cast, each character with mixed motives.  Robert
DeNiro is the American, Jean Reno (_The Professional_, _Godzilla_) is
the Frenchman, Stellan Skarsgard (_Breaking the Waves_, _Good Will
Hunting_) is the German, and Natasha McElphone (_Truman Show_) is the
mysterious Irish ringleader.  The cast plays off each other with the
standard personas each has been associated with.</P>
<P>The film even has a _Fiction_-esque McGuffin--a mysterious silver
briefcase.  "What's in the case?" asks DeNiro, repeatedly.  Perhaps the
mathematical "process" described in _The Spanish Prisoner_.</P>
<P>But, also like _PF_, there is such a casual disregard for human life
that it is ultimately off-putting.  What made _Pulp Fiction_ work and
_Ronin_ less satisfactory is that _Pulp Fiction_ worked on a much
smaller scale, with every death in that film being economic and
significant in its storyline/shock value.  _Ronin_ spends too much of
its time shooting, crashing, and killing that it gives us no reason to
care for its central characters.  Or charicatures.</P>
<P>Back to that car chase.  The camera captures the car running down a few
pedestrians.  Cut to: interior look of car, McElphone is unfazed.  No
dialogue.  No fear of getting caught.  Cut to: car no. 2, with Jean Reno
in the driver's seat.  Six cars crash right behind him, yet he keeps
going, expressionless.  The audience's adrenaline is pumping, but both
characters and their passengers, are sedate.  What gives?</P>
<P>This goes on for nearly ten minutes.  The city is destroyed.  Innocent
bystanders die.  Fifty cars get demolished.  Yet very few police cars
respond.  (Were they on strike?)  And the oncoming traffic seems
incomprehensibly calm over the ensuing havoc. ( Did the traffic reports
prepare them?)</P>
<P>I suppose we, as imbecillic movie patrons can watch that and think,
"Wow, that's so cool."  James Bond doesn't flinch, why should they?  My
take: for a film that is meant to be taken with a grain of salt, it has
a devastating ancillary tone.  It takes everything way too seriously,
from its travellogue/historical settings, to its
every-day-is-a-rainy-day cinematography, to the let's throw in every
hard-to-understand accent we can find in its dialogue, to its wink-wink
references of the CIA, KGB and (here's the clincher) IRA.</P>
<P>The final scene ruined it for me.  Without spoiling the film, there is a
scene terribly reminiscent of _Snake Eyes_, except, at least in _that_
film, the police acted somewhat responsibly, the crowds became involved
with the crime, and, ultimately, justice was served.  Here, a
devastating threat is made, said threat is actually followed through,
and... nothing comes of it.  We see the victims, but the bad guy, at
least that one particular bad guy whose face is concealed, gets away.
Why waste our time?  There's enough illogical madmen getting away with
horrific crimes displayed on our nightly news.</P>
<P>So I could not care for the characters.  Consequently, the story bored
me. Hence, I cannot recommend this film.  And yet... there _is_ that
wonderful car chase.  I'm torn.</P>
<PRE>Video, anyone?</PRE>
