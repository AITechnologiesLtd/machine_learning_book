All Hallows Eve, 1999</PRE>
<P>Being John Malkovich is an original film of genius. Many may have 
problems comprehending the movie's complex, multi-layered plot and its 
box office will consequently look to be no better than mid-range. 
However, a video shelf life prolonged by second viewings should make 
this film a cult- if not a mainstream- classic.</P>
<P>Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a 30-something year old puppeteer who 
seems to be wasting his life away, waiting to someday find a job in the 
marionette business. Craig's wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz), is a 
pet-freak who goes so far as to take her chimpanzee to a psychiatrist. 
They live in an apartment in the only city that could possible tolerate, 
not to mention accept, them: The Big Apple.</P>
<P>Craig finally comes across a job where he can use his hands and fingers, 
a filing assistant, and is quickly hired. His office space may be the 
only thing more bazaar than his animal-infested apartment; it is on the 
7 BD floor (which requires a crow bar and the emergency alarm on an =
elevator to access and has ceilings that appear to be about four feet 
high), the secretary has a hearing impediment similar to one of Gilda 
Radner's old Saturday Night Live characters and his boss is a 
105-year-old man who openly shares of his necessity to urinate in a 
sitting position and desires to have sex with the aforementioned 
secretary. Yet the oddest feature of his new office is a tiny door 
behind a filling cabinet. The door is a portal into John Malkovich's 
head. When you enter this portal you are sucked into Malkovich, seeing 
through his eyes and partially controlling him. Then, after 15 minutes, 
you are spit out onto the New Jersey Turnpike. Once Craig discovers this 
hidden door, the possibilities become infinite.</P>
<P>Andy Warhol once suggested that everyone would have 15 minutes of fame. 
In this movie, everyone has at least 15 minutes of Malkovich. This seems 
to hit on one of society's more voyeuristic obsessions: knowing 
others' every movie. For Craig being Malkovich is an opportunity to be 
a sexually attractive man with name recognition. For Lotte it is an 
opportunity to have sex with other women. (She is so inspired the she 
even decides at one point to "85talk to Dr. Feldman about sexual =
re-assignment surgery.") But when Malkovich gets inside of Malkovich it 
is a horrifying experience that is hilarious to watch. (It would be 
ruining one of the film's great moments to say any more.)</P>
<P>John Malkovich is, obviously, key to this film. He deserves credit for 
taking the role as himself despite the film's critical plot device of 
him having name recognition but relatively little role recognition. 
Should this production become the cult classic that it likely will, 
Malkovich may discover that he has accidentally gone from one extreme to 
another. He portrays a dramatic character in his next film, The 
Messenger, and may find that people have difficulty taking him seriously 
since he spoofs himself in this movie. (Well timed Halloween masks of 
his face were included in the press kits, a fine example of the level of 
lampooning in this film.)</P>
<P>Rod Sterling became so well respected because he fully explored the 
Twilight Zone, an interesting place that could have been left only half 
covered. Unfortunately, this movie falls short of doing that. At the 
beginning, after Craig has discovered the portal and used it for the 
first time, he contemplates the great philosophical questions that 
arise. For example, he had a piece of wood in his hand when he entered 
Malkovich. When Craig fell on the New Jersey Turnpike, it was gone. So, 
what happened to the wood? The movie could have been even more engaging 
had it explored these options but the film dodged them altogether, thus 
falling short of its potential. Although this is a real pity, you must 
remember that this flaw only exists because great films like this are 
held to a higher standard.</P>
