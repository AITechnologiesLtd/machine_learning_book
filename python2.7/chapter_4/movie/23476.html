<P>There isn't anything surprising in this biography of baseball legend
Hank Greenberg.  There are clips of his illustrious career with the
Detroit Tigers in the ‘30s and ‘40s, as well as interviews with
Greenberg, his family, his fans, his teammates, assorted sportswriters,
and even actor Walter Matthau (Hanging Up) and attorney Alan M.
Dershowitz.</P>
<P>What The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg doesn't include is an
interview with my grandfather, who met Greenberg while they both served
in the United States Army during World War II.  My grandfather, who was
a photographer, saluted Greenberg and asked if he could take his picture
for the base or the Post newspaper.  `If you want pictures of me,'
Greenberg growled, `get in contact with the West Coast Training
Command.'  So did my grandfather hold a grudge?  `I hated him from then
on, even though he was a good hitter.'  Did the grudge filter its way
down to my generation?  Of course not, but I will point out that
Greenberg died in 1986 and my grandfather is trying to score tickets to
see Ken Griffey, Jr. play in the Cincinnati Reds spring training camp.</P>
<P>Of course The Life and Times portrays Greenberg in a much rosier light
than my grandfather did.  The lumbering lefty was, after all, the
original Hammerin' Hank.  If you grew up in the Bronx during the ‘30s or
‘40s, Greenberg was so admired that people assumed that he would become
the first Jewish President of the United States of America.  His Jewish
fans dubbed the first baseman the Moses of Baseball.  Greenberg wasn't
the first Jewish ballplayer, but he was certainly the best of his day,
if not of all-time.  He was also one of the first to keep his
un-Gentile-sounding name before going professional.  Greenberg's
reluctance to hide his religion became a constant source of pride within
the Jewish community, and the slugger became their biggest role model.</P>
<P>Like Jackie Robinson two decades later, Greenberg endured a barrage of
anti-Semitic taunts from hecklers and from opponents.  During his first
major league season in 1934, he had the added pressure of being on a
team involved in a pennant race that coincided with two major autumn
Jewish holidays.  Faced with a tough decision that pitted his religion
against his beloved game, Greenberg played on Rosh Hoshanah, where he
went yard to win the game, and sat out Yom Kippur, where he received a
standing ovation from his entire congregation.</P>
<P>So did Greenberg really deserve the adulation and faith-induced
scrutiny?  In his first season in the big leagues, all he did was help
the Tigers establish the major league record for most RBI in a season by
an infield and lead them to the World Series, where he narrowly missed
the Series record for RBI.  In the following five seasons, Greenberg
collected two MVP awards (the first man to win at different positions),
won a World Series, missed Babe Ruth's home run record by two dingers
and Lou Gehrig's RBI record by one.  He became the first ballplayer to
volunteer for the war when he enlisted in 1941.  Missing four seasons in
the prime of his career, Greenberg returned to Detroit in 1945, when he
again led the Tigers to another world championship.  When he was
unceremoniously traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates the following season,
Greenberg became the game's first $100,000 man.  And somehow he even
found time during all of these accomplishments to piss off my ancestors.</P>
<P>Directed by Aviva Kempner, The Life and Times also includes clips of an
interview with former Law & Order actor Michael Moriarty, whose
grandfather was an American League umpire during Greenberg's reign of
terror.  The film opens and closes with the Marx Brothers singing `Take
Me Out to the Ballgame' in Yiddish.  And how could you resist something
like that?</P>
