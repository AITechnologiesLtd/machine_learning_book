<P>"Small Time Crooks" is a funny little movie, which, considering the key
people involved in the project, comes as a bit of a surprise. It's been
a long time since I've associated writer/director/star Woody Allen's
name with anything other than a vague sense of creepiness. As for
co-star Tracey Ullman, while fans trumpet her versatility, I've long
found her brash, loosey-goosey affect rather cringeworthy as well. Yet
here they are; bickering like "The Honeymooners" in a comedy which
delivers a steady stream of chuckles.</P>
<P>Allen plays Ray Winkler, a schlubby middle-aged ex-con with a "great new
plan." Seems there's a recently vacated pizzeria a few doors down from a
bank. Ray will set up a cover business in the storefront, with wife
Frenchy (Ullman) selling her homemade cookies. Meanwhile, he and his
buddies (Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow and Jon Lovitz, all sorely
underused here), will work in the basement, digging a tunnel to the bank
vault. Badda bing, badda boom, instant riches!</P>
<P>The scheme, of course, is a complete disaster, but Frenchy's cookies
become incredibly popular with New Yorkers. In a relatively short period
of time, the couple find themselves running a wildly successful national
franchise and the Winklers move on up to the Eastside, to a deluxe
apartment in the sky. While Ray is content living his usual life;
watching TV in his underwear and eating his wife's spaghetti and turkey
meatballs, Frenchy has lofty goals. She wants to become a refined member
of the social elite, even if means hiring smarmy art dealer David (Hugh
Grant) as her cultural tutor.</P>
<P>It's a simple concept – Ralph and Alice Kramden as the "Beverly
Hillbillies" – but it works. Woody Allen is the weakest part of the
equation, bitching and moaning in his usual fashion, but Tracey Ullman
picks up the story and strolls away with it, creating a solid,
sympathetic persona and building outward from there. Frenchy has a tart
tongue and tough mannerisms, but is remarkably susceptible to a few kind
words. Ullman imbues the character with a sense of cracked strength that
makes her vulnerability all the more engaging.</P>
<P>But, as good as Ullman is, Elaine May steals the movie handily as May,
Frenchy's cousin brought in to help with the cookie store scam.
Blissfully unaware that the business is just a front, May chatters
incessantly, always saying the perfect wrong thing at the perfect wrong
time. The veteran comic carries ditziness to a new plateau; May walks
among us, but lives in a completely different universe, a dreamy pastel
place filled with lounge music and stuffed animals. Elaine May takes the
simplest gesture and makes it hilarious – even if you detest Woody Allen
and Tracey Ullman, "Small Time Crooks" would be worth a visit for her
work alone.</P>
