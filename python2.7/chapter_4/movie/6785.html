<P>     ALBINO ALLIGATOR, the directorial debut of 1996's Best Supporting 
Oscar winner, Kevin Spacey, is a cagey, claustrophobic noir thriller 
highlighted by a few clever plot twists, some nicely-honed dialogue, and 
a half-dozen top-notch performances.  Many will doubtless compare this 
movie to Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS, but, while there are 
similarities in plot, intent, and style, ALBINO ALLIGATOR is a more 
intimate film.  If not for the car chase that opens the movie and sets 
up everything that follows, this could easily be mistaken for the screen 
adaptation of a play. </P>
<P>     Spacey's picture doesn't feature anything new or startling, but 
it's competently constructed, and, with the possible exception of a 
stale patch in the middle, keeps the tension at a consistently high 
level.  Built around a pyramidal series of coincidences, ALBINO 
ALLIGATOR is rich in irony and occasionally darkly humorous.  The 
characters, who all start out as familiar types, are allowed to grow and 
develop in sometimes-unexpected directions.  Even the viewer who 
recognizes ALBINO ALLIGATOR's flaws is still likely to be intrigued and 
captivated by the increasingly-desperate proceedings. </P>
<P>     Dova (Matt Dillon), Milo (Gary Sinise), and Law (William Fichtner) 
are three crooks on the run in New Orleans.  A failed robbery combined 
with a police mix-up leads to a high-speed car chase, three dead bodies, 
and a tense situation in a place called Dino's Last Chance Bar.  With 
the police gathering outside, the trio takes everyone in the small joint 
hostage, including the bartender (M. Emmet Walsh), a waitress (Faye 
Dunaway), and several customers (Skeet Ulrich, John Spencer, and Viggo 
Mortensen).  Outside, the cops' actions are directed by a goateed Joe 
Mantegna, who's irritated at the growing media presence on the scene. </P>
<P>     Most of the film involves interaction amongst the criminals, and 
between them and their prisoners.  Dova, the leader, is uncertain how he 
wants things to proceed.  His injured brother, Milo, advises restraint 
and humanity -- perhaps even to the point of giving up.  On the other 
hand, Law, a borderline nutcase, is willing to start a bloodbath.  He 
espouses the "Albino Alligator" stratagem:  intentional sacrifice for 
intentional gain --kill the hostages to win freedom.  Dova's indecision 
about which course of action to pursue, and the subtle ways in which the 
prisoners attempt to sway him, fuels much of ALBINO ALLIGATOR's 
edginess.  Nothing in this film is quite as inevitable as it first 
seems. </P>
<P>     Every performance works, although some of the actors (namely John 
Spencer, Viggo Mortensen, and M. Emmet Walsh) don't have much to do.  
Dillon is excellent as the torn Dova.  At times, we believe he's capable 
of murdering everyone in the bar; on other occasions, we can see a 
haunted look in his eyes.  William Fichtner plays the sociopath with a 
mixture of unharnassed rage and oily charm.  As the voice of reason, 
Gary Sinise gives his usual solid performance (he's a much kinder, 
gentler villain here than in RANSOM).  The standout among the hostages 
is Faye Dunaway, whose character runs through emotions from anger and 
contempt to horror and desperation.  And, as the only cop with a 
personality, Joe Mantegna is delightfully hard-bitten.  His technique 
for putting a reporter in her place is one of the film's best moments. </P>
<P>     The core of ALBINO ALLIGATOR is atmosphere and dialogue.  The 
characters do a lot of talking, and, although few of their lines are 
memorable, almost all of what they say rings true.  There are occasions, 
however, when the film's talkiness eats into the tension, especially 
towards the midpoint.  ALBINO ALLIGATOR doesn't flow as smoothly as it 
might; there are times when it surges forward, and other instances when 
it drags a little. </P>
<P>     In an era when Tarantino-flavored crime thrillers are becoming more 
commonplace, ALBINO ALLIGATOR manages to distinguish itself.  For the 
most part, Christian Forte's script is smart, even if the characters 
aren't, and Spacey's direction is sure-handed.  There's something darkly 
delightful about watching a movie like this, which, despite occasionally 
falling back on formulaic conventions, still manages to surprise its 
audience from time-to-time.   </P>
