<P>Not technically Steven Spielberg's film debut, as it began life as a
TV-Movie, but it was expanded for theatrical release outside the US
after Universal saw its box-office potential.  Man-vs-truck story
brings together powerhouse talents of young director Spielberg and
fantasy writer Richard Matheson (they'd reunite for the TWILIGHT ZONE
movie and AMAZING STORIES series).  When David Mann (Dennis Weaver)
passes a truck on a desert road the truck driver retaliates by passing
him in turn.  From there begins a murderous fight for ownership of the
road.  Weaver becomes an unwilling David to the truck's Goliath.  Most
fascinating element of this film is that we don't really question the
unseen truck driver's motivation.  This is because Matheson's sharp but
simple story works almost entirely on a primal level: territorial
dominance and the battle for survival.  Despite millennia of evolution
the human brain still retains the instinct of the hunt.  Mann is quite
obviously Man, and his blood-red car is as nondescript and generic a
vehicle as you would find.  The truck, on the other hand, is an amalgam
of different archetypal beasts - it is a smoke-belching dragon (which
appears to be waiting in its cave at one point when it turns its
headlights on), a lumbering mammoth (witness its animal bellow at the
film's conclusion), and, it has been suggested, a precursor to the
shark in JAWS (we see menacing POV shots as it glides towards its
prey).</P>
<P>This is the production that really got studio heads taking notice of
Spielberg, and it's fun watching him at work.  As every frame was
storyboarded it makes an ideal piece  for perusal by film students. 
Extra footage for the cinema version includes scenes with a bus and a
railway crossing (although in retrospect I find these don't work as
well as the more basic cat-and-mouse bullying on the open road). 
Weaver, best known for his cowboy detective McCloud, is an unusual but
effective choice for the role of the bewildered, victimized motorist. 
Story is not too far removed from a Western anyway - there is a desert
setting, a bar fight, a cowboy-booted villain (the only glimpse we
really get of him), a collection of licence plates on the truck's
grille (in the manner of notches on a gun holster), a basic
good-vs-evil challenge to the death.  Instead of guns, the
protagonists use the next most significant instrument of murder in
civilized culture - their vehicles.  It may get you thinking about the
highways the way JAWS got you thinking about the beach.  Even though
it was intended for television, film's pacing and tension is hurt by
ad breaks.  Rent it or tape it.</P>
