<P>   Shakespeare located many of his romantic and revenge-
filled plays alike in Italy because in his day its city-states 
were considered exotic.  Most people would never
guess that he had never been there.  That's not all.  The
playwright had not seen New York City either and yet as you 
watch Ethan Hawke go through the title character's doubts
and duties in "Hamlet," you'd not be surprised that The Great
Playwright situated his best known drama in the Big Apple,
also considered by him to be an exotic and mysterious place
crammed with stories of romance and violence.  You say that
this cannot be--that Shakespeare is not alive except in spirit? 
You protest too much, methinks, but you're partly
correct.  He is today as alive in essence as Hamlet's spirit
and has communicated his new vision of perhaps his most
poetic play through director Michael Almereyda.  </P>
<P>   Almereyda did some things right, others wrong in
transliterating the poet's words to the New York of the year
2000.  "Hamlet" is no more "universal" than Clifford Odets's
period pieces "Waiting for Lefty" and "Awake and Sing!"  Both
"Hamlet" and "Lefty" have themes of love, violence, envy,
loyalty, ethics and government, so that to say these themes
are universal is irrelevant.  Despite the presence of universal
themes, "Waiting for Lefty" communicates only to the diehard
Old Left in America today just as "Hamlet" most authentically
communicates to kids on their college fencing team.  Since
the vocabulary and idioms and reference points of
Elizabethan England are largely foreign to a contemporary
audience in America, the times are out of joint.  Almereyda
does the right thing in changing locations and centuries
because--as it turns out from watching this current
production--we can understand the author's meaning better
by (as an example) making Denmark the name of a modern
American corporation with great power to influence the minds
of the people under its "jurisdiction." Almereyda is nothing if
not imaginative.  The ghost of Hamlet's murdered father
appears, then evaporates not into the mist but into a Pepsi
machine.  Daddy is a spiritual being, Pepsi is material.  What
a splendid irony--the spiritual has been replaced today by the
seductive trappings of Pepsi Cola, Adidas, and cell phones to
whose rule we have lost much of our spiritual selves.  To
symbolize the prison that was Denmark, Almereyda states in
the press notes that brand names and logos and billboards
and noise are today's prison.  (That's a stretch.)</P>
<P>   There's much that's wrong with this production of a play
that has already been filmed some thirty-odd times. 
Squeezing the material that took Kenneth Branagh 247
minutes to get across in his 1996 film, Almereyda's
112-minute rendering leaves important scenes on the cutting
room floor, adds a few pieces of silly modern dialogues, and
transposes the sequence helter-skelter in such a way that
confusion reigns.  Though Ophelia (Julia Stiles, no less)
makes a phone call, getting the response "Hello, and
welcome to Moviefone!" eliciting the only intended laugh from
the audience, Almereyda ompletely abandons the humorous
graveyard scene, thus forcing the drama into an even more
solemn concoction than the Bard intended.</P>
<P>   The real flaw in this production is that despite our
awareness (from our high-school reading) of Hamlet's need to
avenge his father's murder, nothing important appears to be
at stake in this movie.  The performers go about their duties
in a stolid manner, reciting the words as though a
requirement of their high-school English teachers but without
recognizable passion.  The element of fear is missing. 
Hamlet's father appears as a ghost (Sam Shepard) who is
simply not frightening--though Shepard is the only actor in
this case who transmits Shakespearian depth. I recall one
production in which the ghost remained unseen within
Hamlet's body as though directed by William Friedkin,
his words actually coming through the young man's mouth.  
Only an exorcism could free both Hamlet and his father to set
the universe right.  Now, this was scary.  My mind summons
a staged production in which the ghost appears like a
nine-foot tall golem, similarly scaring the hell out of the
audience as well as Hamlet and his pal Horatio.  But
Shepard's character has been directed to reveal himself in a
manner as bland as Cream of Wheat, even more human than
the rest of the ensemble, his evocation of the need for
vengeance as tepid as a cup of McDonald's coffee left to chill
out to avoid a lawsuit.</P>
<P>   Much is made of Ethan Hawke's age.  Hawke, who is 29,
may be the youngest Hamlet ever filmed--which is realistic
since the prince of Denmark would be of his generation.  But
Hawke, a splendid preppie in his career-making movie "Dead
Poets Society" and a hip 20-something in "Reality Bites" does
not have the depth for the role.  What makes "Hamlet" a
masterful play rather than a Jacobean revenge potboiler is
the complexity of its central character.  Hamlet is morose,
sure, but he is a scholarly person in conflict with himself. 
Hamlet grieves for his dead father, he is disappointed with his
mother's conduct, he wants a revenge so complete that it will
reach the soul as well as the body of his villainous uncle. 
Hawke is simply a sullen adolescent, never smiling.  He
mopes.  He's not a lad fighting moral demons  A high-school
kid could do a better job of playing a looney tunes as well,
but this could be the fault of the director who appears to want
every emotion understated.  Polonius, who is King Claudius's
Lord Chamberlain, is a meddlesome father to Laertes, but Bill
Murray in the role looks like a man with such a sense of
humor that he is ready to burst out laughing as he intones
the now-famous advice between the generations, "This above
all, to thine own self be true..."  (For some reason he forgets
to say "And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.")  Liev
Schrieber, who is popping up everywhere, was better in the
title role at a recent performance in New York's Public
Theater than he is as Laertes.  Here's another guy who never
smiles, who mumbles affectionate words to his sister but who
in no way seethes with a desire for revenge against his own
father's slayer. Kyle MacLachlan is a bored and bland
corporate head, Claudius, in the style of Michael Douglas
early on in "The Game."  When Claudius's wife Gertrude
(played passionately by Diane Venora as a woman who dotes
on his son, refusing to give his secret away to her husband)
drinks the poisoned wine, MacLachlan looks as though his
company's stock just went down 1/8 of a point.</P>
<P>   To make a long story short, Almereyda overworked his
editor, Kristina Boden, but allowed his photographer, John de
Borman, to shoot some impressive New York scenes from
the skyscrapers at night to the sales signs at the
neighborhood Key Food supermarket to the Blockbuster video
store.  I say, read the book and let your imagination do the
photography.  But then as any critic knows, nothing is either
good or bad, but thinking makes it so.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 112 minutes.  (C) 2000
