<P>     DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE cruises confidently through the familiar
territory of the urban action thriller genre.  In these movies, the
chief ingredients are cops, bombs, and high speed chases in which motor
vehicles travel the reverse direction down a one-way street at least
once before the curtain falls.  We go to see a movie like this to be
wowed by stunts and action, which DIE HARD 3 gleefully provides.</P>
<P>     In its first fairly suspenseful hour, some bows are made in the
direction of a storyline.  A mad bomber played by Jeremy Irons is at
work in New York City.  He phones in demands to the police station for
one John McClane to appear under dangerous circumstances in a ghetto
neighborhood, for no reason more logical than that there can't be a
"Die Hard" sequel without Bruce Willis.  Here he teams up with Samuel
Jackson.  The bomber decides to manipulate both him and Willis with
further challenges prompted by nursery rhyme-inspired riddles.   Once
Irons has every cop (and librarian) in New York City distracted with
his bomb threats, he enacts his truly devious plan.  Willis, having no
more information than anyone else in the city, deduces what that plan
is and, with Jackson, spends the second half of the movie attempting to
foil it.  Jackson works longer with Willis in this movie than any sane
New York City civilian would.  Of course this is necessary so that they
can trade one liners back and forth and rescue each other from certain
death, as is required by the conventions of the buddy picture genre.</P>
<P>     Willis and Jackson make for a lively crime-fighting pair.  Willis,
who at the outset of the movie is separated from his wife, suspended
from the police force, and suffering a hangover, once again portrays an
everyman hero who invites our sympathy.  Jackson, fresh from PULP
FICTION (with a  lineup of recent roles reminiscent of Joe Pesci's
versatility in films ranging from GOODFELLAS to LETHAL WEAPON 2 and 3),
creates a likable streetwise personality who's along for the ride and
enjoys most of it.  Some racial tension surfaces between them, good for
some comic relief, but the screenplay isn't interested in resolving
human dramas of this sort.  Irons is convincing as a deviously
intelligent villain for these men.  In fact, he is the only noteworthy
one in a screenplay that gets curiously economical with Irons' love
interest's dialogue.  She must be in at least half of his scenes, but
doesn't voice more than one or two lines.  Female roles don't play a
big part in this genre entry, with even Willis' wife having been
written out of the series.</P>
<P>     Implausible plot developments have become a staple of this genre.
I'd be surprised if audiences haven't started looking forward to them
by now as part of the fun.  DIE HARD 3 has several, including one which
rivals the eighteen circling planes of the previous DIE HARD or the
highway gap leap of SPEED's L.A. bus.  Irons has issued a bomb threat
on one of 1,400 schools in the New York City area.  Clues lead the
police to the threatened school and the bomb is discovered.  Rather
than immediately evacuate the building, the authorities lead the
schoolchildren to the auditorium and have them wait there while the
bomb squad attempts to defuse the bomb.  Only when the time counter has
almost reached bottom do the police send everyone out of the building.
It's done to provide some contrived suspense in a movie that never
quite convinces us it hasn't been manufactured, but which stands as a
mostly well-built construction nevertheless.</P>
<P>     Director John McTiernan, with a resume including THE HUNT FOR RED
OCTOBER, PREDATOR, and the original "Die Hard" adventure, is an old pro
at this kind of movie.  With DIE HARD 3, he gets back in style after
the forgettable outings MEDICINE MAN and LAST ACTION HERO.  The action
set pieces soar by at a breakneck pace, covering more ground with more
chase scenes than John McClane's previous adventures.  The vehicles of
choice for the action include cars, taxis, subway trains, helicopters,
ocean liners, and garbage trucks.  All are choreographed, photographed,
and edited into smoothly exciting showcases of kinetic energy.
Characters jump from one stunt sequence to another breathlessly enough
that the movie breezes past all questions of likelihood, providing
slick, diverting entertainment and leaving you asking "Wait a
minute..." only after the lights go up.</P>
