<P>The quality (or lack thereof) of "Ready to Rumble," an atrociously 
ill-advised comedy directed by Brian Robbins (1999's "Varsity Blues"), can be 
boiled down to one statement: take "Dumb & Dumber," add a wrestling angle to 
the storyline, and strip the proceedings of all signs of wit, interest, and 
laughs. </P>
<P>Gordie (David Arquette) and Sean (Scott Caan) are lifelong best friends whose 
IQs are well into the lower double-digits, and who clean out septic tanks and 
port-a-potties for a living. Their lives revolve solely around two things: 
sewage and WCW wrestling, particularly their obsessive loyalty to their 
undefeated hero, Jimmy King (Oliver Platt). When the infamous (to them) 
Monday Night Nitro arrives in their small Wyoming town, Gordie and Sean 
eagerly are able to acquire tickets, but devastated when the King, for the 
first time, is defeated by Diamond Dallas Page (playing himself), and thus, 
gets his title of WCW Wrestler of the World taken away from him. Tracking the 
King down, Gordie and Sean find him holed up in a trailer park, almost 
penniless and boozed up into a drunken stupor. Their image of him remains 
untarnished, however, as their faithfulness overcomes the discouragingly 
troubled human being in front of them, and they persuade the King to attempt 
a comeback. </P>
<P>"Ready to Rumble" is the type of nonsensical movie that one watches with a 
detached air in between them and the screen, until the moment when they 
question how something of such incredible vacuity was ever greenlit by the 
studio. The moment came for me during a dream sequence involving Gordie 
beating up the insulting worker of a convenience store. That moment was also, 
calamitously, at the five-minute mark of this overlong, 107-minute waste of 
celluloid. With nary a trace of clever writing or original subject matter for 
its so-called jokes, the film relies heavily on the needless exploitation of 
profanity-spewing women (including the charming Ellen Albertini Dow, the 
rappin' granny in 1998's "The Wedding Singer") and humor involving sewage, 
flatulence, and, well, there's a lot of sewage pratfalls. The only scene 
worth a deserved laugh is one in which Gordie and Sean hitch a ride with a 
van full of "Hallelujah"-singing nuns who, before long, are being taught the 
lyrics to "Shout at the Devil."</P>
<P>>From David Arquette to Scott Caan to Oliver Platt to Academy Award winner 
Martin Landau (as a retired wrestler who Gordie and Sean turn to for help in 
shaping up the King), what were these usually reliable actors thinking when 
they chose to participate in the making of such a film? Arquette, who is in 
great need of a barbituates overdose, hoots and hollers a lot, but does 
little else, while Scott Caan seems to be grinning and bearing his appearance 
here. Oddly enough, Oliver Platt is just about the least likely person to 
ever become a professional wrestler, and his casting is more of a stunt than 
anything; surely, a real-life wrestler would have fit this unfunny, 
straight-man role far more snugly, rather than a comedian who is given little 
chance to do anything other than look disgruntled. </P>
<P>Once in an interview, actress Rose McGowan stated that she knew what a 
talented actress she could be, given the right material. There is no doubt 
that she can be good--just check out her standout performances in 1995's "The 
Doom Generation" and 1996's "Scream"--but, if so, then why is she wasting her 
time in such a disposable role, as Sasha, a scheming Nitro girl who has a 
fling with Gordie?</P>
<P>Thinking back of "Ready to Rumble," I am left with few words to describe the 
viewing experience, because it disparagingly leaves you with so little to 
think about or take away. There are amusing low-brow comedies (1980's 
"Airplane!," anything from the Farrelly brothers--heck, even 1996's "Happy 
Gilmore"), and then there are movies like "Ready to Rumble," that amaze you 
with their sheer stupidity and unwillingness to create anything that is the 
least bit worthy of wasting two hours of your life with. </P>
