<P>Hassan Yektapanah's Djomeh won the Golden Camera Award (for best first
feature) at Cannes, firmly establishing Iran as the world's current
cinematic hotbed.  Fans of Abbas Kiarostami (The Wind Will Carry Us) and
Jafar Panahi (The Circle) should love Djomeh, as Yektapanah honed his skills
by working as an assistant director for both filmmakers (he wrote, directed,
edited and even served as a production designer here).</P>
<P>The film is about a young man (Jalil Nazari) from Afghanistan (hey, that
rhymes!) who leaves his homeland because of his country's traditions
regarding marriage.  Djomeh wants to marry by his 20th birthday, but customs
say he must wait until he is much, much older.  So he relocates to Iran and
gets a job at a dairy farm, where he milks the cows and goats and drives
around town to collect milk from everyone else, accompanied by his boss
(Mahmoud Behraznia), who becomes somewhat of a father figure to Djomeh.</P>
<P>The two have long conversations about love and marriage, revealing Djomeh to
be an intelligent, well-spoken, sincere lad.  On one of his delivery stops,
Djomeh meets a girl (Mahbobeh Khalili) and falls head-over-heels, but
because of Iranian customs, she can't even speak to him.</P>
<P>With a soundtrack toplined by moaning cows and goats, Djomeh, like other
recent offerings from Iran, is comprised mostly of long shots from a single
stationary camera and uses a group of actors with no background in film.
This makes the picture seem more realistic and much more enjoyable to watch
than something packed full of professional actors (like America's
Sweethearts).</P>
