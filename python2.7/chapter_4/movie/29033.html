<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>My favorite Charlie Chan which features Sidney Toler, who makes his first
appearance following the death of the previous Charlie Chan, Warner Oland, in a
series he will appear eleven times in. The studio heads of 20th Century Fox were
most pleased with the appealing Toler, as the film proved to be a box-office
success. Sen Yung also makes his debut as Jimmy Chan, number two son, and
becomes the comic foil for the episode. </P>
<P>The film emphasized the goofiness of the characters more than paying attention
to the detective story, but the warm feeling the story had was very satisfying.
It is set in Honolulu and opens with the large Charlie Chan family all noisily
eating their meal, the only one of the 13 children missing is his daughter. Soon
his son-in-law arrives to tell the family that his wife is in the hospital and
about to deliver their child. They all rush off to the hospital except for
number five son, Willie (Layne), who stays behind for any phone messages.
Inspector Rawlins calls and tells him to have his pop report to a freighter,
where a man has been murdered. When Jimmy returns, the two decide to not tell
pop and to solve the case on their own. Jimmy wants to show pop how capable he
is and therefore get pop to finance his own private detective agency. </P>
<P>On the freighter Jimmy is mistaken for Charlie Chan, and begins the
investigation. Captain Johnson (Barrat) seems to be anxious to get it solved
quickly because he has a time schedule to meet and is afraid of losing money on
his cargo. The dead man is unidentified but he was carrying a suitcase with
$300,000 and was to meet Judy Hayes (Brooks), a secretary for a Shanghai bank,
and hand her over the money to be deposited in her bank. Since the money is
still there Judy locks it in her cabin, but it's soon missing. When Jimmy
investigates the largely foreign crew, they are about to throw him overboard but
pop arrives and takes over the investigation. </P>
<P>The suspects are the six passengers and the two ship officers, Captain Johnson
and his first mate, Randolph (King). There's the eccentric psychology doctor,
Cardigan (Zucco), who pretends he's deaf and is conducting experiments on dead
criminal behavior by keeping their brains in a jar of alcohol. Mrs. Wayne (Dodd)
is a mystery passenger, as she's obviously wealthy yet she won't state why she's
slumming on a freighter. Hogan (Collins) is a childish 37-year-old animal
trainer traveling with a menagerie of animals, one of which is a lion he doesn't
keep caged and walks on a leash. Finally there's Detective Arnold (Lane) and his
prisoner McCoy (Lawrence); he's taking the murderer to be imprisoned in San
Francisco. But we soon learn he's a phony detective. Also, Mrs. Wayne tells
Charlie that she saw Randolph hand a gun over to Judy, just before the man was
shot to death. </P>
<P>The case gets more complicated with another murder, and as new details about all
the suspects arise. Charlie comes through by setting a trap for the killer, as
he keeps all the suspects together in a cabin. By the end the film successfully
combines the zany comic antics with an exciting detective yarn, though purists
of this series might not be that appreciative of all the comedy antics biting
into the suspense. </P>
