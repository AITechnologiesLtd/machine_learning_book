<PRE>                                  VOLCANO
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: VOLCANO is a bizarre disaster film
          that treats an erupting volcano as an urban crisis.
          It is sort of a horizontal version of THE TOWERING
          INFERNO.  Lava, seen as the main threat from the
          volcano, is treated a sort of monster that lurks in
          tunnels and crawls out on the street devouring all
          in its path.  Most of the real dangers of a volcano
          like the force of the blast and superheated gasses
          get what is at most a superficial and much toned
          down treatment. Tommy Lee Jones stars as a
          functionary trying to keep a lid on the problem.
          The visuals are colorful, but the script is just
          terrible.  DANTE'S PEAK had its faults and perhaps
          was no great shakes, but VOLCANO cannot hold a
          candle to it. Rating: 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     This is the spring of two different volcano movies, DANTE'S PEAK
and VOLCANO and it surprising how differently the two films treat the
same sort of disaster.  DANTE'S PEAK was a dark and downbeat film
taking place in Mt. St. Helens territory and its disaster is filmed in
dark colors.  Its message is that volcanoes are immensely powerful
forces of nature and even with the help of technology about the best we
can hope for from a confrontation is to get away alive.  But they are
impressive.  VOLCANO is set in Los Angeles among famous landmarks.  It
tells us that with a bit of ingenuity and a little time any problems
including volcanoes can be solved.  Much of VOLCANO is tongue-in-cheek
with in-jokes about well- known Los Angeles personalities and digs at
the controversial Metro system.  In short VOLCANO is just one more
colorful action film.  It seem to have had little interest in seriously
exploring the possibility of a volcano in Los Angeles.  It does not
seem to have been based at all on any existing accounts of real
eruptions.</P>
<P>     For Mike Roark (played by Tommy Lee Jones), the director of the
Office of Emergency Management, the first day of the disaster starts
off badly... with an earthquake.  In spite of officially being on
vacation, he wants to jump immediately into action.  But his first
problem is that he has to find a sitter to manage his rambunctious
thirteen-year-old daughter Kelly (Gaby Hoffman).  When he gets to his
job, Mike's way of managing is to be in the field investigating while
his assistant (Don Cheadle) manages things in the office.  It is not
long before the earthquake problem gives way to a mystery of several
workers who were mysteriously burned in an underground tunnel by
something strange that left no sign of its presence.  Whatever it is
leaves scorching only on its victims, not on the walls of the tunnel.
It is time to call in spunky seismologist Dr. Amy Hoffmann (Anne Heche)
between them they discover that the real problem is volcanic flames
that creep up through the cracks in the floor of the tunnel, then sneak
away before they can be seen or leave a scorch-mark.  Amy discovers
this secret, but before she tell anyone the flames attack with a
genuine volcanic eruption geysering out of the La Brea Tar Pits.  This
micro-mini-eruption sends flaming rocks into the air which come down
like cannonballs for blocks around and ash starts falling like snow.
But then the real threat appears, streams of hot liquid lava come out
of the volcano.  They flood Wilshire Boulevard setting fires and
burning cars (but for some reason never exploding the gas tanks).  With
angry lava in the streets the question becomes, can it be stopped
before it reaches actual homes?  Also, can a coalition of Los Angeles
residents put aside their ethnic differences and work together to save
the city from the uncontrolled lava stream?</P>
<P>     Director Mike Jackson has done some intelligent films including
THREADS, THE RACE FOR THE DOUBLE HELIX, A VERY BRITISH COUP, L.A.
STORY, and INDICTMENT.  Each of those is a modest film that reaches for
the mind rather than getting a gut reaction.  Unfortunately, that was
not how he made VOLCANO.  This was a script that he should have turned
down from the start, but perhaps he wanted to see what he could do with
a bigger budget.  The story and screenplay are by first-timer Jerome
Armstrong, though Billy Ray shares the authorship of the script.  Tommy
Lee Jones is okay, but needs to get a little more variety into the
roles he plays.  He has one interesting character, but he has played
that character too often.  More interesting is the seismologist played
by Anne Heche.  She currently is also playing Johnny Depp's long-
suffering wife in DONNIE BRASCO.</P>
<P>     Armstrong throws frequent jokes into the script, though most of us
will have to have many of the jokes explained.  Apparently Dennis
Woodruff's car, seen prominently in a pool of lava, is a familiar Los
Angeles sight.  Also familiar is a billboard with a particular actress.
Just whether a certain restaurant chain we see multiple times is an
in-joke or a product placement, I am not sure.  There are some scenes
probably were not very well thought-out.  Mike seems to be abusing his
power asking for special attention from the fire department for his
daughter.  This probably did not sit well with the audience.  In one
scene Amy apparently measures a temperature of the ground and gets a
reading of 600 degrees just below her feet.  That would have burned
away her feet.  While the special effects are generally fairly good,
the digitized lava flows are not always convincing.  Neither are some
of the matte paintings.</P>
<P>     If you want to see an action adventure see VOLCANO, if you want to
have a feel for what it really would be like to be caught too close to
an erupting volcano, see DANTE'S PEAK.  VOLCANO rates a 0 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
