<P>     An opening title in THE MOD SQUAD conscientiously defines "mod" for
the viewing audience, then goes the extra mile of defining "squad" as
well.  It's your first clue that the target audience is that
ultra-desirable -- and, apparently, lexically-challenged -- youth
demographic, rather than primarily baby boomers familiar with the
1968-1972 television series.  Not surprisingly, THE MOD SQUAD is a loud
and generally stupid action film with a dose of teen-angst melodrama.
Impressively, it even compounds the misery with a ridiculously convoluted
plot.</P>
<P>     The basic set-up, like that of the series, involves three troubled
young people (back in the day, they'd be called "juvenile delinquents")
recruited by L.A.P.D. Capt. Adam Greer (Dennis Farina) to be a unique
undercover trio.  Faced with the alternatives of prison or police work,
Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) and Linc Hayes
(Omar Epps) are assigned to "get into places nobody else can."  One of the
places they still seem adapt at getting into is trouble, trouble which
gets particularly nasty when Greer turns up dead and implicated in drug
trafficking.  For no really good reason other than a continuation of the
film, the "Mod Squad" begins its own investigation, uncovering a
conspiracy which would baffle "X-Files" creator Chris Carter.</P>
<P>     You might think that a dense, multi-layered plot would indicate faith
in audience intelligence, but you'd be very mistaken indeed.  THE MOD
SQUAD uses its innumerable narrative threads like shiny objects to
distract an infant, never really caring whether they make for a more
interesting or engaging story.  Julie spends most of the film getting
re-involved with an old flame (Josh Brolin), while Pete and Linc track
down leads in a plot line that runs mostly parallel.  Meanwhile, Pete has
a sensitive moment with his estranged parents, a goofy drug dealer
(Michael Lerner) dances with Linc to "My Favorite Things," Pete and Julie
almost kinda sorta get together, and Linc's car is the object of
ever-wackier damage at Pete's hand.  It doesn't even matter that many of
the sub-plots drift together by the film's conclusion; its Short Attention
Span Theater mentality makes it not at all worth the effort to keep up.</P>
<P>     It's also a dim-witted and trite action film that has the nerve to
wink ironically at its place in the pantheon of dim-witted and trite
action films.  Pete (given an off-kilter sensibility by Ribisi, one of the
few reasons to keep watching) comments incredulously late in the film
about "dirty cops, drug deals...I can't believe this actually happens.  I
feel like I should be saying 'I'm getting too old for this sh*t.'"  Cute
gag, only THE MOD SQUAD hasn't earned that level of self-deprecation.
It's the kind of film where a guy spills his guts to someone who has
chased him down yelling "I'm a cop!" despite the absence of any badge or
weapon.  It's the kind of film where the villains spell out their plans in
more detail than James Bond baddies.  And it's the kind of film that truly
defines gratuitious sex, violence and profanity.  A bad movie can't be a
commentary on the state of bad movie-making.</P>
<P>     The strange thing is that much of that formulaic foolishness could
have worked if THE MOD SQUAD had been played straighter as an homage to
formulaic early-70s cop dramas.  The only time the film is at all
diverting is when B. C. Smith's funky retro-score plays under a dimly lit
chase scene, giving it that faux-gritty vibe.  Director Scott Silver
simply can't maintain that energy, not when he's wasting time on choppy
music video editing of his characters' tender personal moments.  THE MOD
SQUAD is busy and headache-inducing, and rarely even manages to channel
that into viscerally effective action.  It's just another lousy piece of
brand name recycling, so clearly pitched at a dumbed-down audience it's
surprising that, when taking the time to define the film's title, they
risked spotting us the "the."</P>
