<P>    Maybe the Europeans should leave the road movies to the
Americans.  "Voyage to the Beginning of the World," which
takes place largely in a car travleing over the roads of
Northern Portugal, is the sort of film that has the viewers
wondering, "Are we there yet?"  When we get there, though,
there's no payoff, just the pretentious chatter of uninteresting
people who are fond of talking in metaphors.</P>
<P>   This latest film of a ninety-year old director has nothing in
common with his 1970s works which critics admire for
their modernist complexities, and seems world apart from his
more accessible 1995 film, "The Convent," which featured a
crackerjack role for John Malkovich.  Perhaps it will be
marketed as a tribute to great Marcello Mastroianni, who died
in 1996 at the age of 73 shortly after appearing in "Voyage,"
too soon even to see a screening of the movie.  </P>
<P>   The journey from France to Portugal is undertaken by a
Portuguese director, his small company, and a French actor
who is hired to do a TV shoot with them in the Iberian
country.  The Frenchman, Afonso (Jean Yves Gautier) was
brought up in France by a French mother and by a
Portuguese father who died young and did not teach the boy
any of his language.  Afonso uses the trip as an
excuse to visit his father's town where he hopes to meet his
dad's surviving sister, and since the Portuguese director,
Manoel (Marcello Mastroianni) and the two actors can
translate for him, they agree to go with him to the village. 
Reminiscing is apparently contagious: director Manoel, who
looks more old and tired than his 73 years and wallows in
self-pity, describes the past as a time that "it's good to
remember" since the days "will not come back."  He describes
the horniness of his earlier years, his strict education under
the Jesuits, and insists that he could never become a priest
as the mere sight of a woman would make him forget about
celibacy.  In a roundabout way he even suggests a liaison
with the attractive Portuguese actress in the car, Judite
(Leonor Silveira), who is not engrossed but who, despite her
name, has no interest in beheading the director.  Much is
made of a mustachioed statue they encounter on the road, a
statue which takes on great metaphoric weight as a man
whom "no one can set free."  When the troupe arrive at the
old aunt's house, the crone at first refuses to believe that
Afonso is her nephew, but is convinced of their relationship
when she touches his arm and somehow senses that they are
of the same blood.</P>
<P>   While Manoel's dad seems to be an interesting dude, one
who left ol' Portugal and its spartan ways to fight in Spain,
bought his way out of a Republican jail, and wound up in
France, Manoel, Afonso, Judite et famille are crashing bores. 
Manoel carries a walking stick and protests that he is but a
lame old man and Judite seems to have her stick stuck to her
spine.  </P>
<P>   Traveling from a hip, modern area of France to a
backwoods village in Northern Portugal is indeed a journey
back to the dawn of time. Though the picture is a mere 95
minutes, the viewers can't be blamed for feeling that they
themselves have had the experience.</P>
