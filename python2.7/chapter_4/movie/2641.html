<PRE>                                   SPEED
                      A        film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  What        sounds like a silly idea for an
     action film actually has some resonance on        the screen.  What
     seems like        a bad choice for a lead        actor works out        better
     than expected.  This is basically a DIE HARD film with a bus
     and that isn't too        bad.  Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<PRE>     Every once        in a while what        seems like a foolish idea for a        film turns
around and surprises you with what a clever idea it really is.        You hear an
idea like "H. G. Wells chases Jack the Ripper in a time        machine" and think
"No, thank you."  Then you see the film        and come out thinking what a great
idea it        was for        a film.         I had that experience with SPEED.  A Los Angeles
bus is rigged to explode as it drops below 50 miles per        hour.  First of        all,
as much        as vehicles can        be, busses are natural buffoons.  They seem clumsy
and ungainly.  National        Lampoon        once thought it        funny to do an article on
"WWII's        Battling Busses."  SPEED almost        sounded        like it        could be a comedy
sequel to the very funny THE BIG BUS.  Then on top of it, the star was Keanu
Reeves.         What busses are to vehicles, Reeves is        to actors.  The        combination
of the two seemed more like something someone thought up in THE        PLAYER than
an actual plan for a film.</PRE>
<PRE>     In        fact, what sounded like        an unpromising plot turns out to tap into an
experience most        of us have had.         Who hasn't at some time been driving and
late for an appointment        and found there        was traffic in the way or perhaps a
piece of unpaved highway.  In SPEED every road hazard that could slow down
the bus        becomes        a deadly threat.</PRE>
<PRE>     Dennis Hopper plays Howard        Payne, a high-spirited psychotic who is
determined to extort $3.7 million from the city        of Los Angeles,        one way        or
another.  His first scheme is foiled by        Jack Traven, a deadpan SWAT officer
with unorthodox        (and irresponsible) ideas about        how to resolve hostage
situations.  Payne's second extortion attempt is the plan to rig a city        bus
and to at the same time        give Jack (Keanu Reeves) a taste of defeat and
perhaps        eternity.  Reeves makes        his way        onto the speeding bus, but not
before the driver can hit 50 on        the speedometer        and inadvertently arm the
bomb.  An expected turn        of events leaves the driver incapacitated and he is
replaced by Annie (Sandra Bullock), a volunteer.  Annie        has the        seemingly
impossible task        of keeping the speed of        the bus        up while Jack has to do        the
delicate task of disarming a bomb under        a speeding bus and of negotiating
with Payne through a cellular phone.  Films have used a        similar        plot with
bombs on planes        or boats (e.g. JUGGERNAUT), but        then when the bomb is not
being defused the plane        or boat        can just cruise.  Here the situation calls
for constant attention and it makes for        a very exciting        two hours.</PRE>
<PRE>     Keanu Reeves, who has now been directed by        people like Kenneth Branagh,
Francis        Ford Coppola, Gus Van Sant, and        Bernardo Bertolucci, may be getting
to where he actually can act, but he just has no charisma.  Perhaps this is
even a virtue--not every body in life has to be        a Gregory Peck.         Perhaps not
every screen hero has to be either.  Dennis Hopper, however, can act weird
in his sleep and totally steals        the film from Reeves.</PRE>
<PRE>     There may be one or two problems still in the script.  On consideration
it is clear that Traven        mishandled the situation disastrously.        Pop quiz:
how should he have handled the situation?  He should have arranged to pay
off Payne and worry about catching him afterward.  Payne does many times his
$3.7 million in        damage in the course of        the film and Traven's bravado also
has its        cost in        human life.  Also there        were clear errors in the filming of
the bus        jumping        a gap in the highway.  The bus jumps a gap between two level
stretches of highway.  It seems        that a little model work showing a banked
highway        and a proper camera angle could        have made the sequence a little        more
believable.  But overall this is an action film        that delivers the goods.  I
would rate it a        low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
