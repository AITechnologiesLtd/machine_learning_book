<P>     Not knowing much about the life of Dorothy Day, I approached this 
bio-pic with interest.  Unfortunately, two hours later, while I knew 
quite a bit more about the woman's life, I felt like I'd been subjected 
to a dry, unremarkable, text-book retelling of her accomplishments.  
ENTERTAINING ANGELS has a shallow, TV movie style that reduces what 
could have been compelling drama to a sadly superficial experience.  We 
learn what Dorothy Day did, but very little about who she really was.  </P>
<P>     The saving grace is actress Moira Kelly, who has matured 
considerably in her craft since debuting in the 1991 miniseries, LOVE, 
LIES, AND MURDER.  Kelly is exceptional here, bringing charisma and 
passion to her portrayal of Day.  In her first lead role, she proves to 
be more than equal to the task.  Unfortunately, John Wells' script lets 
her down.  No matter how hard she tries, she can't overcome the 
constraints placed on her by a pedestrian screenplay and a director who 
isn't willing to try anything ambitious.</P>
<P>     Who was Dorothy Day?  Born in 1897, she lived until 1980.  For the 
last fifty years of her life, she was an activist for the homeless.  She 
founded the Catholic Worker newspaper and social organization, both of 
which are currently still active.  During the war years and the decades 
that followed, she was jailed numerous times for participating in anti-
war and anti-nuclear marches.  Around the middle of the century, she was 
widely regarded as a communist, but, by the time of her death, many 
viewed her as a living saint.</P>
<P>     With the exception of brief, bookending scenes that take place in 
the 1960s, ENTERTAINING ANGELS proceeds in a strictly chronological 
fashion, starting in 1917 and concluding around 1938.  When we first 
meet Dorothy Day, she's a twenty year old women's rights activist, 
marching in a suffrage demonstration in New York City.  She's a resident 
of Greenwich Village, hangs out with Eugene O'Neill, entertains numerous 
lovers, has an illegal abortion, and keeps a second child conceived out 
of wedlock.  In the early 1930s, however, Day converts to Catholicism, 
abandons her daughter's father when he refuses to marry her, and begins 
working in soup kitchens.  Under the tutelage of philosopher Peter 
Maurin (Martin Sheen, with a French accent that sounds like it was 
stolen from one of the PINK PANTHER movies), Day begins printing the 
Catholic Worker newspaper.  As its popularity grows, Day funnels all the 
money she receives from its publication into soup kitchens and shelters 
for the homeless.  </P>
<P>     ENTERTAINING ANGELS was produced by Paulist Pictures, the Catholic 
organization that formerly made ROMERO.  Occasional forays into overt 
moralizing betray the film's origins.  The worst example of this occurs 
when Dorothy, in a moment of religious crisis, enters an empty church 
and pours out her concerns in a tearful prayer.  It's an embarrassing 
scene that should have been excised from the final print.  Melodramatic 
and poorly-written, it serves only to remind us that, although even the 
most devout Christians occasionally doubt their faith, "the Lord will 
provide."</P>
<P>     It can rightfully be claimed that viewing someone's actions tells 
us a lot about the person.  In that sense, ENTERTAINING ANGELS gives a 
reasonable portrait of its subject.  Ultimately, however, too much is 
skimmed over or completely ignored by this film.  We see Day convert, 
but none of the powerful emotional and spiritual forces leading up to 
that crucial moment are shown.  Likewise, her feelings when she learns 
that the Catholic Church may be against her movement are perfunctorily 
dismissed.  ENTERTAINING ANGELS is interested exclusively in mundane 
plot exposition, and, while that functions adequately in giving a loose 
sense of Day's importance in history, it fails to provide us with a 
rounded view of the woman who bears the famous name.  Because of its 
limited, constricted view, ENTERTAINING ANGELS is less satisfying than 
it should be.  </P>
