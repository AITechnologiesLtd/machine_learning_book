<P>Congratulations are due to Demi Moore. After a series of increasingly bad 
career moves, climaxed by her starring role in the horrific "Striptease", 
she has finally landed in a fairly good film. Structurally, "G.I. Jane" 
is just another cliché-filled military flick, but Moore and director 
Ridley Scott invest so much vigor into the film that it works anyway. </P>
<P>In this intense drama, a crusty Texas senator uses her clout to challenge 
the military ban on women in combat. As Senator Lillian DeHaven, Anne 
Bancroft has a ball, using a now-you-hear-it, now-you-don't Southern 
drawl and slinky, cat-like movements in her portrayal of a sleazy veteran 
politician exhilarated with power games. This is Bancroft's best role in 
years, and it's great fun watching her play with the part. Following 
DeHaven's victory in a pissing contest with the military brass, Naval 
Intelligence officer Jordan O'Neil (Moore) is recruited as a test case, 
the first woman allowed to tackle the grueling Navy SEAL's program. </P>
<P>Moore quickly establishes O'Neil as a smart, skilled and extremely 
focused officer. The script quickly throws her into the same boot camp 
nightmare we've seen in "Full Metal Jacket", "An Officer And A Gentlemen" 
and numerous other "can they triumph against the odds" pictures. The 
situation is cliched, but director Ridley Scott ("Thelma and Louise", 
"White Squall") establishes and maintains a strong momentum, giving the 
film a sense of urgency that transcends the cliched storyline more often 
than not. Moore does solid work as well. Her tendency towards playing 
things way too seriously has hurt her in previous films, but this time 
around it is a crucial factor in setting in place the integrity and 
intensity of O'Neil's personality. </P>
<P>Aside from Lt. O'Neil and Senator DeHaven, the film's other characters 
are more archetypes than individuals. There's the loving, but wary 
boyfriend, the tough, but caring drill instructor, and of course, the rag-
tag mix of fellow SEAL wannabes. The film takes exactly the route one 
might expect, with the boys expressing varying degrees of outrage over 
O'Neil's presence, until it reaches the obligatory scene where O'Neil 
wins over her fellow trainees. 
During an particularly brutal battle exercise, she kicks the hell out of 
her foe, then triumphantly shouts "Suck my dick!", drawing cheers from 
the other trainees, as well as the audience. Now, let's take just a 
moment and think about this. Over the course of the film, O'Neil insists 
on absolutely equal treatment, going as far as shaving her head and 
bunking with the men. Extreme measures, but an understandable approach 
for a character determined to prove her worth. But what in the world is 
"Suck my dick!" all about? Are the filmmakers seriously suggesting that 
to be accepted as an equal with men, you must pretend to be one? An odd 
approach for a film supposedly taking a feminist stand. </P>
<P>Or maybe not so odd, when one considers the many scenes of O'Neil 
training privately in sweaty, skimpy outfits, a very nice excuse for some 
long, loving T&A shots. One suspects that "G.I. Jane" isn't making any 
particular feminist statement at all. It appears the woman-in-combat 
motif was simply considered a good hook for an action movie, not to 
mention a nice vehicle for Demi Moore to salvage her flagging career. </P>
<P>Despite the film's decidedly mixed messages, "G.I. Jane" still works, 
primarily because Ridley Scott knows how to make an action film feel 
solid. Clichés be damned, the training sequences pack real clout. When 
O'Neil is assaulted again and again, the staging and sound effects make 
those scenes feel all too real. Even for seasoned moviegoers, it's hard 
not to wince and turn away when watching O'Neil brutalized in such a 
realistic fashion.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the film, O'Neil's outfit gets thrown into an actual 
combat situation, and you can take it from there. Every conceivable 
battle cliché happens, and you know what? The climax is STILL rousing, 
because by this point you've either left the theater or thrown away any 
expectations of credibility. Feminist trappings aside, the bottom line is 
that "G.I. Jane" is a good old fashioned war movie, the kind John Wayne 
fans would approve of. Demi Moore and Ridley Scott may not have a lot to 
brag about here, but they certainly don't need to apologize either. </P>
