<PRE>                    ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     So how did your tenth high school reunion go?  More apropos, how
would you like it to have gone?</P>
<P>     This conundrum faces normally happy-go-lucky Romy and Michele in
ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.  They have been inseparable
buddies forever so they must face this challenge in their life
together.  Romy's instant solution is: Lose some weight off their
already slender frames, "bag a couple of boyfriends," and get a job.
Romy says this will be easy, but Michele retorts that if it is so easy,
why hadn't they already done it.</P>
<P>     Robin Schiff's script keeps the show moving with some nice
one-liners.  One of the best has Romy reminiscing about her life's
battle against the bathroom scales.  "I was so lucky getting mono," she
says looking at her thinnest high school picture.  "That was like the
best diet ever."</P>
<P>     The casting for the film is so perfect that one begins to suspect
that the leads were chosen and then the script was developed.  Mira
Sorvino, who won the Academy Award for her role in MIGHTY APHRODITE,
plays Romy, the brighter of the two, if that is possible.  Lisa Kudrow,
from the TV series "Friends" and "Mad About You," plays the slightly
dumber Michele.</P>
<P>     Roommates Romy and Michele in this good spirited parody are your
canonical ditzy blondes.  The show's tag line "the blonde leading the
blonde" uses blonde as a metaphor for blind.</P>
<P>     Romy and Michele use their high school yearbook to discuss the
delineation of the caste system at their high school.  (Editor David
Finfer dissolves the stills in the annual to live action flashbacks
which gives immediacy to the past coming to life.)</P>
<P>     At Sagebrush High, the hierarchy consisted of the A group
(cheerleaders), the B group (drama club) and the C group (nerds).  Romy
and Michele were none of the above.  Ridiculed as "the weirdoes," they
were constant targets for abuse.  Even though they were quite
attractive, they had so much fun being together that they did not care
about the others.  That they make their own outlandish clothes helped
keep the wall around them.  Mona May's costumes contribute to the
show's breezy fun.  The colorful and revealing dresses of lime green,
lavender, and other pastels include heavy use of plastic fruit.  She
even has the people at the reunion carry color coordinated frozen
daiquiris.  Romy and Michele's hairdos have the bulk that birds need to
build nests.</P>
<P>     Complementing Romy and Michele's lightness, is Janeane Garofalo as
the dark, pudgy Heather Mooney.  Heather, who invented a new cigarette
paper for cigarettes with "twice the taste in half the time for the gal
on the go," has the success and the money that they would like.
Heather was even more of an outsider than they were in high school.
Garofalo's one dimensional role is only a side show.  This is a two
person film with the other characters there merely for the two leads to
bounce their lines off of.  The genuine chemistry between Sorvino and
Kudrow makes for a sweet and sometimes touching comedy.</P>
<P>     Director David Mirkin's presentation is uneven.  Although the
lines are periodically funny, the picture as a whole just does not have
the comedic power of GROSS POINTE BLANK, which is another 10th high
school reunion comedy currently playing.  Still, Sorvino and Kudrow
have so much fun doing their parts, their enjoyment spreads to the
audience.</P>
<P>     ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION runs a fast 1:33.  It is
rated R for sexual humor and a little profanity.  The film would be
fine for kids 10 or 11 and over.  I recommend this lighthearted and
lightweight comedy and give it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
