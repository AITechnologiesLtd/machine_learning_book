<P>PLOT:
A guy and girl meet in a New York City department store when reaching for the
same pair of gloves. They talk, have coffee and it isn't long before the guy is
asking for the girl's number. Unfortunately, for the dude, a gust of wind blows
the piece of paper out of his hand. The girl determines that it was fate which
led to that predicament, and sets up two other possible chance meetings with the
guy, in the hopes of fate intervening once again and this time, proving that
they should be together. Phew. Anyway, it's about love and destiny...</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
An okay romance with a decent premise and some respectable acting, that gets a
little redundant during its middle stretch, but ultimately comes through as a
cute date movie for adults. Not really humorous, although the great Jeremy Piven
is very funny as the best friend yet again and Eugene Levy shines is his small
role. Not totally dramatic, since we're all pretty sure how things are gonna end
up here. And not all that energetic, as things start falling into a definite
routine, with one twist of fate leading to another coincidence leading to even
more clues to the inevitable. But on the whole, it's easy to watch (barely runs
for an hour and a half), has some nice shots of the gorgeous New York City
during the fall and winter seasons, and gives us John Cusack, who is always
pretty entertaining as a rule. I don't think that this movie is going to become
a romantic classic by any means, but it certainly does take the premise of "fate
determining our futures" and pushes it to the max. For me, it was a little
personal because I actually went through something very similar with a girl back
in 1996. I was Holland, she was in the States, but everywhere I traveled around
Europe, signs pointed her way and we just couldn't wait to meet one another when
I got back home. The resolution of our adventure wasn't as perfect as the one in
this flick, but the idea of signs and fate always being present in our lives,
and our ability to "pick up" on them determining some of the direction of our
existence, is one to which I personally adhere.</P>
<P>Granted, this movie really exaggerates the "coincidences" and definitely
overplays this card, especially during the final scene, in which you just can't
help but say "Oh, c'mon...that just can't be!" but it's not the end of the
world. They're not trying to solve all of the world's problems here and if you
can appreciate the basic sentiment behind this movie, I think you'll be smiling
in the end, and I believe that's pretty much all that they were shooting for
here. The soundtrack is also joyful, the sights picturesque and even though
Beckinsale isn't the shiniest star in the sky, she and Cusack do connect in
their scenes together, and you can't help but sigh lovingly when the end of the
film rolls around. Unless of course, you're not in a "sappy" mood and you
consider the whole film to be utter drivel, which I could understand, since I'm
generally not a fan of the "typical" Hollywood romantic comedy scene either (see
list below). In the end, this fluffy piece is entirely predictable, with small
touches of humor and romance, but might also be what certain couples are looking
for nowadays. </P>
