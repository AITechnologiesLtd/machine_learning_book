<P>Step aside Stanley Kubrick, Barry Levinson has just released two films
within six months of each another, while you're still out filming your
first movie in over ten years! Then again, Levinson's two films don't
exactly mount a challenge to any of your classic tales (DR.
STRANGLELOVE (7/10) being the first to spring to mind here), but hey,
at least he's working hard, right? SPHERE (6.5/10) was Levinson's other
film released in early 1998, while WAG THE DOG came out in late 1997.</P>
<P>PLOT:
The President of the United States is alleged to have had a sexual
encounter with a firefly girl while in office. To divert the country's
attention from this politically fatal bit of information, the
President's spin staff go all out on creating true-to-life scenarios of
more important and relevant news to the country. A Hollywood producer
is brought in to orchestrate the diverting hoaxes, and maintain the
President's approval ratings until the re-election vote in eleven days
time.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
One-joke political talking heads film does not generate enough humour
or excitement for me to appreciate the overall strong efforts put forth
by all of its actors and director. This movie is basically based on one
idea of pulling the wool over the country's eyes and not much else. And
as much as this concept intrigued me during its first ten to fifteen
minutes, the repetitive nature of the film's progression, just dragged
any enthusiasm and interest completely out of my system. There are only
so many scenes of people gathered in a small boardroom, and folks
chatting things up through their cellulars that I could take before
hungering out for something with a little more entertainment value.</P>
<P>Also, despite the film being classified as a political satire (I'll be
the first to admit that political films are not my favourite types of
film), I found very little humour in this script, despite a few moments
of cheeky cleverness. I'm sure that many people in the Hollywood and
Washington inner-circles would appreciate many of the witty lines from
this movie, but for me, it all seemed like a lot of talking by the same
group of people about the interrelated ideas over and over and over
again. Having said all that, the film did run a quick 90 minutes or so,
did have a decent score, and did offer some unique directing ticks by
Levinson, and solid performances by all involved.</P>
<P>Dustin Hoffman, Robert DeNiro and Anne Heche all pull off dead-on
portrayals of sneaks in the business world of show and politics. But
despite their valiant efforts and high credibility factors, I did find
myself rolling my eyes during many of the films scenarios of deception,
and questioning their relatively ease of unfolding. And while the film
does moniker itself a satire, I felt that too many of its media-fueled
fantasies just made the entire American population and media appear to
be a bunch of complete ignoramuses with not much more on their mind
than TV and sensationalism. Not sure how factual that statement may be
to true life, but I guess I would've preferred a stronger offensive
from the plethora of cynics roaming today's societal potpourri. All in
all, I could picture this film endearing itself to all those fans of
political fare, but gaining very little excitement from the rest of the
American Joes of whom this film pokes fun. I personally liked its
conclusion and acting performances, but found much of the rest of the
film to be dry, repetitive and unfunny.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Keep your eyes peeled for Robert DeNiro's real-life daughter playing
the gate stewardess at the airport in this film. Her name is Drena
DeNiro. Mr. DeNiro was also a producer on this film.
After this film started production and before its release, US President
Bill Clinton became involved in a sex scandal with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky, and threatened military action against Iraq.
Barry Levinson apparently took only 30 days of filming to complete this
film.
This film constitutes Robert DeNiro's fourth partnership with a David
Mamet-based screenplay. The three others were the ill-fated WE'RE NO
ANGELS, THE UNTOUCHABLES (7.5/10) and most recently, RONIN (7.5/10).
William H. Macy once studied under writer David Mamet at Goddard
College in Vermont. The "H" in his name stands for Hall.
Anne Heche dated fellow actor Steve Martin for two years, before
switching sexual gears and becoming Ellen DeGeneres' partner in 1997.
Plenty of cameos pepper this small-budgeted production ($15million)
including Woody Harrelson, Jim Belushi, Jay Leno, William H. Macy
(Delivering one of the films best lines, "When the fit hits the shan,
someone's going to have to stay after school,"), Craig T. Nelson,
Willie Nelson and Kirsten Dunst.
Woody Harrelson graduated from Hanover College in 1983. He also played
the character "Woody" from Hanover on the super-popular TV sitcom
"Cheers".
Kirsten Dunst beat out Christina Ricci for roles in INTERVIEW WITH THE
VAMPIRE (8/10) and LITTLE WOMEN.
The original music for this film was scored by Mark Knoffler, member of
the famed "Dire Straits" musical group.</P>
