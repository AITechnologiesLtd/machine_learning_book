<PRE>American Beauty (R) ****
Starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening
Directed by Sam Mendes
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>NOTE: Throughout this review I will designate parts of the film that deserve
Oscar nominations with a @.</P>
<P>I think that if any of us have learned a lesson from all of the movies that
have come out during this past year it's that too much hype is a bad thing.
Star Wars - Episode I: The Phantom Menace was hyped since last November for
being one of the biggest motion picture events ever. The film turned out to be
just a bad marketing scam designed to continue the cash flow to George Lucas's
bank account. How about Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me? While the sequel
to the hit original was funny, it was also packed full of bathroom humor that
was gross and un-appealing. Or for an even better example, how about The Blair
Witch Project, a little film that was supposed to be one of the scariest ever
that barely even brought out a fright. The next heavily hyped film is American
Beauty, being praised as the best film of the year with millions of Oscar
nominations coming it's way. I was hesitant at first, but finally I'm here to
review a film that lives up to it's hype.</P>
<P>Lester Burnham (Spacey @) is living in a middle class neighborhood with his
control freak wife Carolyn, (Bening @) she's a real estate agent who is
competing with Buddy Kane, (Peter Gallagher) the "King" of real estate. Lester
finds his life boring, his teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch @) hates him, his
job is leaving him un-satisfied, and he's beginning to have some type of an
identity crisis. That all changes when he sees Jane's friend Angela, (Mena
Suvari @) he wants her and will do anything to get her.</P>
<P>So he begins working out in the garage to impress her. Lifting weights and
smoking the drugs that are supplied by his next door neighbor Ricky (Wes Bently
@) who Jane soon falls in love with. Ricky films every he sees with a digital
camera he bought with his drug money. As Lester finds what he wants in life,
his family begins to fall apart, Carolyn gets the "royal treatment" from Buddy
Kane, and Jane hates him even more because he's in love with Angela. </P>
<P>But it's not only the excellent acting and witty screenplay (@) that make
American Beauty what it is, it's the message that it contains. Here is a film
so wonderful that it truly deserves to be seen by every American. If this isn't
a Best Picture (@) winner, I don't know what is. Everything about American
Beauty is interesting and I could easily see this film again and again. The
film does however have one flaw, yes, I'm perfectly aware that this is an edgy,
and experimental film, but it has a little too much sex and a little too much
drug use. Both of these things prevents people like me from seeing the picture,
but I'm sure it's good that they are there. So go and see this film now,
whatever junk you were considering to go see, drop it. You must see this film
now. What are you still reading this for? It's like your not even listening to
me...you must stop reading now. Go to the theater and view American Beauty
which gets **** stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: Ouch, this great film features loads of objectionable content.
Lots and lots of sex talk occurs along with a sex scene and two long views of
two different character's breasts. Drug use also rates as a high, people smoke
pot in at least six scenes. Violence also rates as an extreme because of a
bloody shooting and a man beating up his son. Also, bad attitudes fill up the
entire picture. Good Age: 17 & Up</P>
