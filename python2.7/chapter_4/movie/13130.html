<PRE>PIRAHNA (1978)</PRE>
<PRE>a film by Joe Dante</PRE>
<P>starring Bradford Dillman, Barbara Steele, Heather Menzies, Kevin
McCarthy, Keenan Wynn, Dick Miller</P>
<P>written by John Sayles and Richard Robinson</P>
<P>a New World Pictures release
MPAA rating: R (for bloody violence, nudity, adult language)
on video: yes (Warner Home Video; may be deleted from their catalog)</P>
<P>genre: man vs. nature, sci-fi
recommendation: very high for fans of campy humor and B-movie antics</P>
<P>Here's an infectiously entertaining little horror film that apparently
did reasonably well at drive-ins and seedy little theaters worldwide
(making higher profits than "Jaws", its obvious predecessor, in several
third world countries).  It's great, mostly because the people who were
behind it are great too: Joe Dante is now a very inventive
commercial/big budget director who later manned the helm of "Gremlins",
"Innerspace", and this summer's "Small Soldiers", while John Sayles, one
of the most original and fiercely independent filmmakers in recent
history, went on to make classics like "Return of the Secaucus Seven",
"Matewan", and "Lone Star".</P>
<P>And they got their start at the drive-in, with features like "The
Howling" (1981), "Battle Beyond the Stars", (1980) and the seriously
underrated "Alligator" (1980) - films that bear repeated viewings,
simply as well-made and entertaining homages to the handful of B movies
made by talented folks who used small budgets to their advantage and
concentrated on their own skills as filmmakers to pick up the slack. 
Producer Roger Corman has a knack for finding people who fit this build.
and when it came time to make "Piranha", he knew just where to go.</P>
<P>The film opens with action, and pretty much keeps its pace up throughout
the film.  A reporter named Grogan (Bradford Dillman) with a drinking
problem meets up with Maggie (Heather Menzies), a skip tracer.  Turns
out they're both looking for the same missing person.  Before you know
it, a frenzied, delusional scientist (Kevin McCarthy, who had the lead
in the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers") has them rushing
towards Lost River Lake.  Turns out that the doctor was working on a
mutant strain of super-fast, super-deadly piranha for use against Viet
Cong troops, and thousands of his specimen were accidentally released
into the water and are making a beeline for the Aquarena, a new
timeshare vacation site on the reservoir.  On the way, the killer fish
will pass a summer camp along the river at which Grogan's daughter will
be swimming.  And guess what.  NOBODY WILL BELIEVE THEM.  Certainly not
the police, who have recently pulled Grogan in on a drunk and disorderly
charge.  Certainly not Buck Gardner (the ubiquitous Dick Miller), the
shyster owner of the cheap-ass Aquarena, who can't handle such bad
publicity on his investment in its opening weekend.  And certainly not
Army personnel Col. Flaxman (Bruce Gordon), an unspoken investor in the
Aquarena, or Dr. Mengers (Barbara Steele), a "fish expert" who knows
more about the problem than she's led to believe.</P>
<P>Once you get past the actual pirahna effect (they look like clay
triangles quickly scooting about in straight lines through cloudy
water), it's actually possible to enjoy this thing.  One of the things
that stands out abut the film are the actual pirahna attack scenes. 
They're done on a budget, but that's beside the point - they're staged
with a mix of panic, comedy, and doom that makes waiting for them
extremely worthwhile.  Once the pirahna get near people in the water,
nobody is safe.  Everybody gets hurt.  Especially the children!  When
camp counselor Dumont (Paul Bartel) puts his face near the water, one of
the fish actually jumps out and bites him.  And the classic deadpan,
delivered by a waiter on the investor's pontoon boat to the Dick Miller
character: "Sir, it's the pirahna.  They're eating the guests."</P>
<P>The ending is a little ridiculous, and some of the scenes are shot so
tightly it's easy to recognize repeated images.  But all in all,
"Pirahna" delivers as one of the best low-budget horror films of the
'70s, and you should go watch it today.</P>
