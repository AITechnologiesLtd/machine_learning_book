<PRE>THE CLOSET (Le Placard)
A film review by Julia Levin
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>In this lighthearted, unpretentious comedy, Daniel Auteuil sheds the
intensity of his previous roles -- in Les Voleurs, Ma saison préférée,
Manon of the Spring, to name just a few -- and plays a shy,
crooked-nosed accountant too boring to be tolerated by just about
anyone.  His François Pignon -- an appropriate name for somebody who is
about to be fired, literally, for being a bore -- is a harmless
placeholder who has no ambitions and no misconceptions about who he is.</P>
<P>Pignon's wife couldn't stand him and left two years ago, yet he still
phones regularly to her and their indifferent teenage son.  After
learning that he is soon to be fired, Pignon, distraught, returns home
and meets that "perfect stranger" we all want to meet someday: The one
who steps into our life and brings magic into it.  From that moment on,
the neighbor, Belone (Michel Aumont), navigates Pignon's life like a
chess game.</P>
<P>Belone easily persuades François to concoct a story about his
homosexuality so his boss will fear a discrimination lawsuit,
superimposes photographic images and -- voila -- produces a shot of
Pignon in a leather-clad embrace with another man in bun-exposed pants. 
The photo gets sent to Pignon's employer, and the events start spinning
like a windmill in stormy weather, eventually changing Pignon's life
forever.</P>
<P>Oddly, for the rest of the story, The Closet flirts with being
politically correct and is as predictable as it only can be.  What gives
the film a tint of pleasure and saves it from being totally grotesque
and improbable is that the movie never aspires to be anything more than
what it is.  Director Francis Veber 
(The Dinner Game) finds a delightful irony in the fact that Pignon has
to lie that he doesn't like women in order to prove he is a man.  We, of
course, will learn that there is so much more to Pignon than he and his
colleagues could ever imagine.</P>
<P>While watching the film, I caught myself feeling surprised that such a
banal movie could actually be off-the-cuff and entertaining.  The most
distasteful thought in The Closet is how little people really care about
political correctness but how diligent they are in pretending the
opposite.  Office politics always reveal people at their most vile:
There is something unquestionably disturbing and familiar in watching
petty little personalities trapped in their small trivial lives as they
entertain themselves with self-made gossip and lies.</P>
<P>Besides Auteuil, the acting, for the most part, is adequate.  Gérard
Depardieu, for example, starts off great as a gauche, self-righteous
macho rugby couch, a racist, and a homophobe.  However, as Pignon gets
his job back, Depardieu's colleagues make him fearful for his own job
for calling Pignon a "fruit."  The situation becomes repetitiously
improbable and Depardieu is annoying and unconvincing as we learn that
he might actually be the one "coming out of the closet."</P>
<P>Michèle Laroque is especially good as Mademoiselle Bertrand, Pignon's
boss, who not only discovers a real Pignon and subsequently seduces him,
but also demonstrates to us how smart women master the most impossible
situations.</P>
<P>Though maybe not quite so impossible as this film.</P>
