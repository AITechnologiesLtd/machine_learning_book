<P>     The second Roald Dahl adaptation of the year is a James of a giant
disappointment, a strictly-for-kids revenge fantasy about an exceptional
little girl (Myra Wilson, from MRS. DOUBTFIRE) and how she gets back at
both her nincompoop parents (Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman) and her
school's horrible headmaster (Pam Ferris).  Danny DeVito also produces,
directs, and even narrates, heaven help us.  (The effect of the latter
is actually quite jarring.  His voice is too recognizable and the
resulting contrast-- between the neutral narration and his non-neutral
character-- is so confusing that it nearly stops the film cold.) Behind
the camera, though, Danny the Director (WAR OF THE ROSES, HOFFA) is as
innovative as ever.  He has enough cinematic slight-of-hand up his
sleeve to rival Brian the DePalma.</P>
<P>    Unfortunately, DeVito doesn't know to quit when he's ahead.  The
director's fatal mistake is that he never pulls back from either the
cartoon cruelty or the overplayed buffoonery.  The result is a movie
that quickly grows tiresome and, like too many other summer entries,
ends up a one-dimensional ride.  Not that the intended audience will
mind.  Kids will laugh and scream and shout, while their parents pay
attention to other problems, such as the starkly lit exteriors, the
off-balance plotting, and one little girl with very little range.  (Myra
Wilson can express all of, what?, three emotions?  Or is four?) There
may be as much imagination at work, here, as in WILLY WONKA AND THE
CHOCOLATE FACTORY.  However, *this* Dahl needs to be handled with a
softer touch. </P>
