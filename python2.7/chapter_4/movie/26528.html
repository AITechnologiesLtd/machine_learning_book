<PRE>_Bootmen_ (R) * 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>_The_Fantasticks_ (PG) ***</PRE>
<P>        Not all the talk surrounding Lars von Trier's _Dancer_in_the_Dark_
revolves around the film's love-it-or-hate-it qualities (though most of
it is).  With _Dancer_ taking the top prize at Cannes this year and Baz
Luhrmann's _Moulin_Rouge_ on the horizon for next summer, there's been
lots of rumbling about the "return" of the movie musical.  The reality
is, however, it never really went away, just mutated--into the "dance
musical," which is a rather commonplace find at the cineplex these days.</P>
<P>_Bootmen_, the latest of this "dancing yes, singing no" brand of musical
follows a rebellious young male steel worker in Australia wants to become
a tap dancer.  No, producer Jerry Bruckheimer hasn't taken his act down
under and made a reverse-gender spinoff of _Flashdance_.  Not that his
absence from the credits makes much difference, anyhow, for _Bootmen_
plays very much like typical Bruckheimer--all shiny surfaces with nothing
underneath.</P>
<P>For the most part, pretty boy star Adam Garcia perfectly personifies the
faux Bruckheimer feel.  His winning smile should be familiar--he was the
vacuous slab of beef that sent hearts aflutter in _Coyote_Ugly_ (a bona
fide Bruckheimer production, not so coincidentally).  Unlike in that
film, though, Garcia displays some talent in _Bootmen_--the talent to
dance.  That is certainly fortunate since he plays the aforementioned
"rebel" tap dancer, who has real, raw talent but little patience for
uptight tradition; a promising gig with a major Sydney dance company is
taken from him as quickly as he wins it.  So he and a few old friends
decide to pursue an unlikely dream--form their own dance group in their
industrial hometown of Newcastle.  But "Bootmen" (as they call
themselves) isn't your mother's tap troupe--a mix of traditional tap with
the musical cacophony of STOMP and Björk's first musical number in
_Dancer_in_the_Dark_, they're every bit about attitude as they are about
dance.</P>
<P>Director Dein Perry is the creator of the popular Bootmen-like group Tap
Dogs, so it comes as no surprise that the film's dance numbers are the
energetic highlights.  But a Bruckheimer knockoff wouldn't be one without
a dose of treacly and completely bogus emotional content, and Perry and
screenwriter Steve Worland don't fail to deliver.  The threads designed
to lend the film are obvious and heavyhanded--Sean's romance with a
hairdresser (Sophie Lee), who also had a dalliance with his car thief
younger brother Mitchell (Sam Worthington); Sean's relationship with his
disapproving father (Richard Carter), who wants his son to forget his
dreams and hold down an honest job in the factory.  These stories offer
nothing in the way of surprise--except perhaps the amount of violence in
Mitchell's subplot.</P>
<P>With the plot leaving a lot to be desired, _Bootmen_ is left to sink or
swim on the merits of its star--for better or worse.  Whenever the film
gives him an opportunity to flash his fancy footwork or simply stand
there and exude cocky charisma, Garcia is able to coast by. 
Unfortunately, the dance sequences are too few and far between, as are
the moments of silence, thus leaving him too much space to open his mouth
and "act"--something he simply cannot do.  Wisely (though not
surprisingly), Perry ends his film with one big--and, crucially, mostly
dialogue-free--dance extravaganza, but it's too little, too late.</P>
<P>It is tempting to call _The_Fantasticks_, Michael Ritchie's
long-on-the-shelf (it was completed in 1995) film of the long-running
off-Broadway musical as being too little, too late to revive the form of
film musical that is indeed dead--the traditional type where characters
burst into song (and, often, dance) at the drop of a hat and a full
orchestral backing (and chorus) materializes just as spontaneously.  The
film is based on a play perhaps second-best known (behind the popular
pair of tunes "Try to Remember" and "Soon It's Gonna Rain") for its
minimalism in staging and story.  And in remaining true to the spirit of
the original production, Ritchie's _The_Fantasticks_ is hardly
revolutionary; a trifle of a film based on a trifle of a show--and in its
resolutely old-fashioned ways is where its ingratiating charm lies.</P>
<P>The writers of the original play, Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt, wrote
the screenplay, and as such the simple story remains intact.  Neighbors
Bellomy (Joel Grey) and Hucklebee (Brad Sullivan) pretend to feud in an
effort to bring Bellomy's daughter Luisa (Jean Louisa Kelly) and
Hucklebee's son Matt (Joe McIntyre) together.  Their plan works, and they
enlist the aid of mysterious carnival magician El Gallo (Jonathon Morris)
to "resolve" the "feud."  After a long night during which the elaborate
plan plays out and Matt is crowned a "hero," all's right with the
world--that is, until the harsh light of day makes clear how less than
ideal things really are.</P>
<P>_The_Fantasticks_ had long been considered unfilmable since it is
typically performed on a bare stage with virtually no props.  Since such
minimalism is unthinkable for the big screen, Ritchie has opened up the
play to the extreme, filming in full Panavision glory--all the better to
capture Fred Murphy's gorgeous photography of the film's adopted setting
of the '20s American Midwest.  The stunning images, plus the
reorchestrated score (adapted from Jones and Schmidt's original
arrangements by Jonathan Tunick) gives simple scenes such as Luisa's big
"I Want" song, "Much More," an epic quality that harkens back to the
grand screen musicals of yesteryear.</P>
<P>While Ritchie adjusted a number of things in the translation to film,
the one thing he curiously didn't weren't the performances.  On one hand,
this is a good thing; he employed new digital technology to capture the
actors' singing live on set rather than lipsynch to a prerecorded track
(the standard procedure for all other musical films).  But the sense of
intimacy achieved by the live vocals is cancelled out by the broad, stagy
performance quality he coaxes from his cast.  While a seasoned theater
pro like Grey and the luminous ingenue Kelly are able to get away with
some exaggerated mugging, such an approach proves nearly ruinous for the
new kid on the block (in every sense), McIntyre.  Luckily, his
all-too-evident inexperience as an actor is compensated by his sweet
rapport with Kelly.</P>
<P>It also helps that McIntyre, widely thought to be his former boy band's
best singer, can indeed carry a tune, for after all the key to
_The_Fantasticks_' enduring stage success are those memorable, hummable
tunes.  Just as the story is as flimsy and inconsequential as ever, the
music--invigorated by the actors' spirited vocal performances--is still
able to cast a magical spell.   Unfortunately, in this day and age most
people's society-nurtured cynicism has immunized them to the quiet and
decidedly old school delights of a film like _The_Fantasticks_, which is
much too modest to spur on a full-on revival of this type of movie
musical (and, to no one's surprise, its box office returns have been soft
at best).  But for those who still bear a sense of that unabashedly
innocent, almost naive romanticism, _The_Fantasticks_ presents an
inviting opportunity to "try to remember" a cinematic art that has sadly
been all but lost.</P>
