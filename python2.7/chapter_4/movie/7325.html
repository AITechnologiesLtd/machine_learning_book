<P>PETE'S DRAGON is a Children's Adventure/Musical that follows the
events of a young orphan, Pete (Sean Marshall).  This film is an
entertaining movie that is a combination of live action and animation.  It
can be viewed as a WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT type movie with less animation.</P>
<P>The movie begins with Pete trying to get away from his cruel owners, the
Gogan family.  He finds his way into a secluded area where we see him
speaking to someone.  But who?  This invisible character then is seemingly
responsible for knocking over a few members of the Gogan family, despite Pete's
warning to not swing his "tail".  After the Gogans give up looking for
Pete, the two companions decide to call it a night.</P>
<P>The next morning, we are able to meet Elliot, a flying dragon.  He's a
large green mass who seems playful and timid.  After breakfast, which
consists of cooked apples (thanks to Elliot and his flaming ability), Pete
decides to journey to the local town of Pasamaquadoy.  That might not be
the correct spelling, but as we'll find out, I'm not the only one who has
problems with the name. </P>
<P>Once the two make it to the small fishing town, Elliot makes a bad
entrance, causing all kinds of havoc and destruction.  The townspeople
think that Pete is the one causing all the trouble, when it's actually his
invisible dragon.  With this explanation, they think he's either lying or
crazy.  Pete eventually finds his way to a cave near a lighthouse,
operated by Nora (Helen Reddy) and her dad, Lampie (Mickey Rooney), a
drunk who is scared half to death by Elliot.  Of course, when he tries to
explain this to his drinking friends, they give him the same treatment as
Pete.</P>
<P>Pete is eventually taken in by Nora and is allowed to stay at the
lighthouse.  Elliot has to stay in the cave, though, but the two still get
to spend time together.  Soon thereafter, Dr. Terminus (Jim Dale) and his
assistant Hoagy (Red Buttons) arrive in the town in an attempt to sell
their magical medications.  The townspeople are obviously very familiar
with their "work" and do not show the two a kind welcome, either.  The Doc
is eventually able to convince them to buy his remedies, but his biggest
potential seller is not owned by him yet.  When Lampie informs him that
Elliot, a dragon, is staying in a cave by his lighthouse, Dr. Terminus
begins his efforts to capture Elliot and use him to make more medicines.
The Gogans, as well, continually attempt to steal Pete back so that he can
work their farm all by himself like he used to.  Elliot's mission,
apparently to help orphaned kids, is extended when Nora informs Pete that
her soon-to-husband, Paul (Cal Bartlett) has been missing for some time.
Pete is sure that Elliot can find Paul and return him home.</P>
<P>PETE'S DRAGON is a fun movie, especially for younger kids.  Complete with
the Disney-standard songs throughout the movie, PETE'S DRAGON is a very
enjoyable movie that you won't grow too tired of half way through.  Older
kids and adults should find it a good movie, but not as much as younger
kids will.</P>
