<PRE>MISS CONGENIALITY</PRE>
<P> Reviewed by Harvey Karten
 Warner Bros./Castle Rock Entertainment
 Director: Donald Petrie
 Writer:  Marc Lawrence, Katie Ford, Caryn Lucas
 Cast: Sandra Bullock, Benjamin Bratt, Michael Caine,
Candice Bergen, William Shatner</P>
<P>   Beauty pageants are so silly that their very existence could
make one think that their producers are poking fun.   They're
an ideal target for lampooning by the movie industry, whose
best shot in that area is Michael Ritchie's 1975 work, "Smile"-
-which dealt with the behind-the-scenes activity at a California
"Young America Miss" pageant which Ritchie presents as a
symbol of American middle-class emptiness.  "Miss
Congeniality" doesn't come close in quality to that gem, partly
because the genre is overdone and somewhat because
Donald Petrie's film ultimately sentimentalizes the industry by
pointing out its benefits--at least to the contestants and their
families and cheerleaders.  Ritchie's aim appears to use Marc
Lawrence, Katie Ford and Caryn Lucas's screenplay--based
on Lawrence's story--to showcase Sandra Bullock's talents in
the role of an FBI officer assigned as an undercover agent at
the San Antonio contest, which is presumed to be a target for
mysterious terrorists who challenges the FBI to find them by
sending cryptic notes.</P>
<P>   Fresh from disappointing roles in Betty Thomas's "28 Days"
shown earlier this year (about an alcoholic writer who pratfalls
at a wedding while drunk) and Bronwen Hughes's "Forces of
Nature" (a thin story about an unpredictable woman traveling
with a stranger by land after their plane crashes), Bullock
scores at least moderately well this time around.  Despite
taking two or three cascades to the ground too many (bound
to evoke laughs nonetheless by fans of physical humor), she
turns in a credible role thanks to a solid, amusing script with
whodunit dimensions and director Petrie's skill with comic
timing.</P>
<P>   The story opens on a scene unrelated to the remainder of
the story except to show the clumsiness and independent
spirit of FBI Agent Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock)--who violates
the rules by giving a mobster a Heimlich maneuver and
thereby puts another agent's life in danger.  Threatened with
a hearing by a review board, she is assigned as to
undercover work as a contestant in a Texas beauty pageant
which is presmed to be the target of a terrorist's evil plans. 
Petrie mines the obvious comic territory: a klutzy woman
whose skill in martial arts and generally masculine endeavors
who has cared nothing about her personal appearance is
forced to accept manicures, pedicures, bikini waxes, and
lessons in carrying herself gracefully--the last performed by
none other than Michael Caine in the role of beauty
consultant Victor Melling.  </P>
<P>   Much of the glee is evoked from the conflict of gamin and
guide, each with a wholly distinct agenda, as Agent Hart is
molded Pygmalion-style from kung-fu practitioner to a comely
contestant.  The two become as testy with each other as
Eliza Doolittle with Henry Higgins: when Gracie insists that
she can perform an exercise for the talent show that she took
up when she first learned how to ride a bike, Melling replies,
"You will NOT perform sex on the stage."</P>
<P>   While the growing romance between Gracie Hart and her
assistant, Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) is the least
convincing aspect of the story, Petrie gets credible work from
a smashing-looking Candice Bergen as Kathy Moringside, a
former beauty queen with twenty years' experience as host,
and from Star Trek's William Shatner in a self-mocking role
as co-host.  </P>
<P>   "Miss Congeniality" does not pretend to be more than a
sitcom, but with its swift banter, its credible use of a whodunit
element, and some good ensemble work by the swim-suited
representatives of several American states, you could do a lot
worse during the holiday season than this sparkling,
congenial tale.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 111 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
