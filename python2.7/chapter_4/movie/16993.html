<P>Most of us are outsiders to the high-society debutante subculture, and so is
Tom Townsend. The association with some of his friends leads to an encounter
with some members of this group and he begins to associate with them more.
He not a complete stranger to this world, but his life in a simple Manhattan
apartment with his mother is much different than the more opulent lifestyles
of his new friends. However, money is not an issue with this group, so he
does not have trouble fitting in.</P>
<P>Although the film at first glance may seem to be an exploration of the
society subculture, it really is not. It is really about the interactions of
the members of the group, and the characters are very well developed. Tom is
initially befriended by Nick, who encourages him to continue his association
with the group even though Tom claims to despise the ideals that are
represented. Essentially, Tom is no more or less deep than these people who
are often described as shallow. In fact, being members of the upper classes
(or Urban Haute Bourgeoisie, as one character names it) make the people no
more or less interesting, they just hang out at different places.</P>
<P>Highly Recommended. The film has an array of intersting characters, and is
wickedly funny in many places.</P>
