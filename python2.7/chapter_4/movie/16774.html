<PRE>               A REVIEW OF "MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE"
                        by Ryan Ellis</PRE>
<P>give me a buzz on the ol' e-lines, <A HREF="mailto:iluvmick@hotmail.com">iluvmick@hotmail.com</A></P>
<P>        Studio executives have one eye stuck on their profit summary
and the other eye stuck on their calendar. With no small measure
of coincidence, they release certain pictures at the time of
holidays or observances. "Fathers' Day" was released around--get
this!--Fathers' Day, "Independence Day" debutted on the July 4th
weekend, and Christmas flicks come out in December. Therefore, it
was fitting that "Message In A Bottle" swept into theatres on the
Valentines' Day weekend. A romantic love story, this picture is
for lovers to attend and hold hands and cry together and whatnot.
        BUT, don't call this a date movie--at least, a FIRST date
movie. It's not really '99s version of "Sleepless In Seattle" or
even "You've Got Mail". This piece of work is painful to watch. I
wouldn't want to go to see this film on a first date (or even a
second) with a woman I don't know that well. The funny moments
are few and far between and they've set some kind of record for
tears shed in one movie. However, don't take that for negative
criticism--this is an old-fashioned, well acted love story
co-starring one of the all-time greats, Paul Newman. And good ol'
Paul would be worth watching in a tooth-pulling contest.
        While Newman is not the main focus of this movie, the two
leads, Kevin Costner and Robin Wright Penn, certainly are. The
actors must have found some sort of emotional bond when they were
shooting this because while the script is mostly formulaic, their
genuine feelings for each other look real. Call it good acting,
but once the script calls for them to become smitten, they
actually look like they're in love. This relationship is not
hokey or off-putting. Luis Mandoki doesn't go for cheap laughs or
unrealistic sentiment to draw his audience into the movie. So,
it's difficult to stay detached from these attractive characters
for long. 
        The plot revolves around the proverbial message in a bottle.
Divorced mother Theresa Osborne (Wright Penn) takes a short
vacation on the New England coast. While jogging on the beach,
she finds a bottle on the shore. She reads the enclosed letter
and through her research job at the Chicago Tribune proceeds to
track down the author of the note. Her editor (Robbie Coltrane)
publishes the letter, which brings about hundreds of letters of
input from readers. Theresa is already infatuated with whomever
has written the heartbreaking letter and falls for him even more
when, through her persistence (and with assistance from
co-workers), finds that he has written other beautifully sad
letters to his lost beloved. She discovers that the man lives in
the Carolinas. Throwing good sense to the wind, she flies down to
meet this man.
        Garret Blake (Costner) is the lonely boat-builder who lost
his wife, Catherine, two years before. He has not dealt with the
intense pain of her death and neither has her family. He feuds
with them, particularly her brother, Johnny (John Savage), about
who should keep her paintings and other precious things. Also,
Garret lives with Dodge (Newman), his formerly alcoholic, yet
caring, father. Theresa meets Garret and they begin a
relationship almost immediately. Perhaps all this happens a
little quickly, but the movie is only two hours long, after all!
They fall in love, but he hasn't gotten over the loss of his
wife. That's the premise of "Message In A Bottle". To give away
much more would be to give away TOO much.
        While not a monumental romantic movie, this picture was
nicely shot (with a tastefully done bedroom scene) and the actors
are easy on the eyes. Wright Penn is beautiful and believable,
Costner is deliberately aloof (yet likable anyway), and the
legendary Newman is fine as the imperfect father. Costner and
Newman make a great father-son team and they actually look alike.
Wright Penn and Costner are well-cast (with that great chemistry)
and they both show their emotions well.
        This film pulls no punches. It has few surprises. This is
about dealing with intense pain and grief, letting go and moving
on. While it's formulaic and the romance blossoms a little too
perfectly, the acting is just right. Costner usually gets slammed
for his self-indulgence and vanity, but he doesn't even appear
until the 20-minute mark in this movie. Plus, this picture
doesn't revolve around just him, anyway. It's wonderful to see
the magnetic Robin Wright Penn (who picks projects carefully) and
especially delightful to see Newman. As a three-part package,
they're as honest as the movie they're in. So, bring along a
couple boxes of tissues and watch '99s first good love story.
Just be careful who you bring along. First dates beware, but
lovers enjoy.</P>
<P>USELESS TRIVIA--Unrewarded? If (and it's a big if) Paul Newman
receives an Oscar nomination for this supporting role, it would
be only his 2nd nomination of the 90s and only his 5th in 20
years!</P>
