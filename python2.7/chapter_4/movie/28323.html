PEARL HARBOR</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Michael Bay</PRE>
<PRE>With Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale</PRE>
<PRE>(Theaters) PG-13 183 min</PRE>
<P>Coming out of the new three-hour extravaganza about the bombing of Pearl 
Harbor I heard a teenage boy say "That's the best movie I ever saw!" But 
then again, back in the '70s I heard a teenage girl in a record store 
say to her friend "Did you know Paul McCartney was with another group 
before Wings?" The point is, teenage memories are short and context is 
limited.</P>
<P>Pearl Harbor is likely not the best movie you will ever see, but it is 
probably not the worst. For the palate refreshed by explosions there is 
plenty of nourishment here, though it's long in coming. For the eye 
delighted by Hawaiian sunsets and attractive young people there is much 
to feast on. For the mind that craves emotional subtlety, historical 
complexity, or depth of character, the menu is thin. For the ear that 
lives for true and credible dialogue, there are always earplugs (and 
these will be handy too for Hans Zimmer's bombastic score - how did they 
expect people to fight a war with all that music going on?)</P>
<P>Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Michael Bay, and screenwriter 
Randall Wallace understood that three hours of bombing were too much 
even for an American audience, so they constructed their tale of the 
Japanese sneak attack on the American fleet around a love triangle. 
Cocky, square-jawed Rafe (Ben Affleck) and shy, square-jawed Danny (Josh 
Hartnett) are childhood pals from Tennessee whose love of flying lands 
them in the military flying planes first chance they get (Affleck, 
crowding 30, looks like he might have already logged about ten years in 
the service, but who's counting?) Rafe meets lovely nurse Evelyn (Kate 
Beckinsale) while she's jabbing a needle into his bare fanny in the 
induction center, where she overlooks his inability to read an eye chart 
because he's obviously a born flyer even if he is illiterate (but not 
too illiterate to write and read eloquent love letters later on.)</P>
<P>Who wouldn't fall in love with a girl like that? Rafe does, but then he 
volunteers for a dangerous assignment to the Battle of Britain, and is 
shot down. After a suitable period of mourning Danny steps into the 
romantic picture, and the triangle is joined when something unexpected 
(to them, not to us) transpires.</P>
<P>Soon (some would say not soon enough) romance is overshadowed by infamy 
(or, as a tearful Evelyn puts it to Rafe, ".and then all this 
happened!") On come the Japanese, and the havoc wrought is truly 
spectacular. Some of it is viscerally stunning, some of it is 
emotionally devastating, and some of it looks like a video game.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, back in the White House, FDR (Jon Voight) is waging a heroic 
battle against his infirmity - not the polio that has crippled his legs, 
but the latex wattles that threaten to fall off his face whenever he 
waxes wroth. And in the Japanese fleet, Admiral Yamamoto (Mako) 
struggles with portentous doubts and dialogue ("Brilliant, Sir!" 
exclaims an aide, and he retorts "A brilliant man would find a way not 
to fight a war.") And nobody fights more hopeless odds than Alec Baldwin 
as the valiant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle, who is saddled with some of the 
worst lines in the movie ("There's nothing stronger than the heart of a 
volunteer,") but still manages some welcome swagger.</P>
<P>Bruckheimer & Co. don't want to leave us bummed out over the devastation 
of Pearl, so they've tacked on the bonus of Doolittle's daring 
retaliatory raid on Tokyo, and a romantic coda at the end which leaves 
us wondering how these sorely needed veterans got out of the service 
while, by the evidence of the age of the little boy, the war must still 
be raging.</P>
<P>Pearl Harbor is overwrought and underwritten, but for a generation to 
whom WWII is vague and ancient history, it serves to bring into focus a 
time when America lost its innocence and rose up to kick foreign butt.</P>
