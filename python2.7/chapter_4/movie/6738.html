<PRE>                                   THE CRUCIBLE
                      A film review by Laura & Robin Clifford
                       Copyright 1997 Laura & Robin Clifford</PRE>
<P>(This review is an excerpt from Reeling, a movie review show hosted by
Laura and Robin Clifford, running on Boston Cable TV. Note that the
film descriptions vary in completeness due to the fact that they're
actually intros for running film clips.)</P>
<PRE>THE CRUCIBLE
------------</PRE>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>I find it odd that Nicolas Hytner's first two films both deal with mob
hysteria in less enlightened times - what a strange theme.</P>
<P>"The Crucible", like "The Portrait of a Lady," is very well acted, but
the standout performances come from the supporting cast.  Daniel
Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder are both solid in the lead roles.  Joan
Allen, however, could very well score another Best Supporting Actress
nomination (after last year's recognition for her Pat Nixon) as
Elizabeth Proctor, a  devoutly religious woman whose sexual coldness
has left the door open for her husband's infidelity.  Paul Scofield
turns out another finely shaded performance as the judge sent in from
Boston to attend to the witchcraft trials.  Rob Campbell (the young
gunslinger in "The Unforgiven") is a surprise as the investigator who
is the audience's representative - he's one of the few that begins to
devine the truth amid accusations.  Elizabeth Lawrence is Rebecca
Nurse, the community's conscience.  Peter Vaughan is strong as Giles
Corey, a neighbor and friend to the Proctors. Karron Graves makes an
impressive debut as Mary Warren, the teenage girl who dares to tell
the truth about Abigail Williams and her followers.</P>
<P>"The Crucible" was shot on Hog Island off the coast of Massachusetts
and painstaking attention has been paid to period detail, right down
to dental cosmetics.</P>
<P>Although Arthur Miller originally used the story of the Salem
witchcraft trials to criticize the McCarthy era, "The Crucible" is a
timeless story of corruption, greed, suspicion and religious
fanaticism.</P>
<PRE>B+</PRE>
<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>I'm not a big play fan, but "The Crucible" is one of those few plays
that I have read a number of times. I love Arthur Miller's metaphor of
the Salem witch hunt for the other, Red-tinted, kind of McCarthyesque
witch-hunting that strangled the United States at the time of the
play's writing in the early fifties.</P>
<P>I was pleased to see, with Miller adapting his own play, that the
integrity of his indictment against misled tyranny, no matter how
just, remains intact in director Nicolas Hytner's telling.</P>
<P>Complementing  the excellent screenplay of "The Crucible", are a
number of good and better performances, especially in supporting
roles, excellent period costume and set design - an entire 17 century
Pilgrim village was built on location on Hog Island, about 45 minutes
from Boston - and photography. The tremendous attention to historical
detail is right up there on the screen and is some of the best I have
seen.</P>
<P>Stars Winona Ryder and Daniel Day-Lewis are solid, but not
outstanding.</P>
<P>Joan Allen gives a great performance as a woman who loves her husband,
but cant overcome her Puritan upbringing to give him the physical love
he desires, driving him, John Proctor, briefly into the arms of the
conniving Abigail Williams, played by Ryder. Allen, as she overcomes
her hurt and understands her husband's  love, gives ranges of emotion
and understanding that are palpable to the viewer.</P>
<P>Paul Scofield, as Judge Danforth, does a notable job as the jurist
assigned responsibility for stamping out the devil across "every inch"
of Massachusetts. He portrays an honestly religious, if misguided, man
of the cloth.</P>
<P>"The Crucible" is a solid, entertaining period piece that gets top
tech credits and has some exceptional acting, earning it a deserved
B+.</P>
