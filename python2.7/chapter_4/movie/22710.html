<P>"Bride of Chucky" is another one of those guilty pleasures - you know, a movie
that you're ashamed for having liked because everyone else hates it. This
latest sequel is campy, dumb, unscary, but always teeming with a
tongue-in-cheek attitude that is refreshing to watch in these days of
homogenized horror movies. </P>
<P>This time, Chucky (voiced by the ever-reliable Brad Dourif) is assembled out of
broken doll parts by his girlfriend Meg (the big-breasted Jennifer Tilly). She
reads a book called "Voodoo for Dummies" and presto, Chucky is back with
several scars running through his once cute Good Guys Doll appearance. No
matter, he's back in business and kills Meg and then transfers her spirit into
a female doll named Tiffany! Why? I wish I knew, but this isn't the kind of
movie that thrives on logic. </P>
<P>The plot has to do with two teenagers in love who run away to Niagara Falls to
get married for two reasons - to escape the girl's domineering father (John
Ritter), the Chief of Police of a small town; and because her beau is about to
collect a reward at a New Jersey cemetery (!) by bringing two dolls courtesy of
Meg. Guess who the two dolls are? </P>
<P>"Bride of Chucky" is certainly original and miles ahead of the last two Chucky
fests, which helped destroy the horror genre before "Scream" came along. This
is due partly to series creator and writer Don Mancini, who brings a level of
wit and satire to the proceedings. The dialogue is chock full of references to
"Natural Born Killers," Martha Stewart, "Boogie Nights," "Bride of
Frankenstein," and several infamous horror icons. </P>
<P>The performances are crude but always riotous, including scene-stealing
Jennifer Tilly and her whiny voice that carries the day, and a Marilyn Manson
look alike that is hilariously played by Alexis Arquette. Brad Dourif's
high-pitched laugh and various asides redeem what could have been schlocky
junk. The teenagers are throwaway roles that could have been slipped in by any
number of anonymous teenage actors from the "Dawson's Creek" variety. </P>
<P>"Bride of Chucky" is campy, outrageous fun that keeps moving at a fast clip and
is the latest in a string of postmodernist takes on horror movies. Now, if they
would only bring back the horror...</P>
