<PRE>DR. DOLITTLE 2
--------------</PRE>
<P>Eddie Murphy's back as the San Franciscan doctor who can talk to the animals.
Just as he's coming to terms with daughter Charisse's (Raven-Symone, "Dr.
Dolittle") sixteenth birthday and dating, Dr. D's given a message from a possum
(voice of Isaac Hayes) that he must meet with a beaver in the forest. When the
possum's ignored, a rather mobster-like raccoon (voice of Michael Rapaport)
appears with smooth birthday wishes and a more forceful request. Dr. D meets
the beaver (Richard C. Sarafian) and learns they need his assistance to keep
developers from destroying their forest.  Dr. D's at a loss, until he discovers
that a lone, endangered Pacific Western bear lives there - if he can find a
mate and establish the forest as breeding grounds, the government will step in
to protect their habitat.  Dr. D finds Archie (voice of Steve Zahn), a circus
bear who likes the plush life, and attempts to turn him into a macho suitor in
"Dr. Dolittle 2."</P>
<P>"Dr. Dolittle 2" features a new director (Steve Carr) and the film's original
screenwriter (Larry Levin).  This is a sequel with the same strengths and the
same (albeit fewer) flaws as the original.</P>
<P>Once again, the story sags when focus is on the human characters, although some
spirit is injected by Lil' Zane as Charisse's new boyfriend.  (It's fun to
watch Murphy rif on the protective dad thing.)  The bad-guy developers (Jeffrey
Jones and Kevin Pollack) aren't as obtrusive as the evil medical practice
partners of the original, either.  However, once again Mrs. Dolittle (Kyla
Pratt) is painted as a shrew when painfully obvious miscommunications have her
ordering her husband out of the bedroom and onto to the couch.</P>
<P>When the filmmakers and special effects maestros turn to the animals, however,
"Dr. Dolittle 2" mostly works.  Eva, the forest's wild female bear (charmingly
voiced by Lisa Kudrow) immediately declares Archie weird, but his funny antics
and persistence begin to make inroads.  We do learn more than we need to about
Archie's wild and domesticated bathroom habits, and there's Lucky's territory
marking competition with a wolf, but the toilet humor comes with the film's
demographics.  The mob societal structure of the forest denizens is a nice
anthropomorphic touch.  New character, Pepito, a chameleon who can't change
color, doesn't have much to do with the story, but gets a healthy share of the
funny lines.</P>
<P>As with the original, the technical budget has gone towards making the animals
interact over making the forest locations seem real.</P>
<P>Eddie Murphy delivers, as do the effects crew, but "Dr. Dolittle 2" is clearly
for the kiddies.</P>
