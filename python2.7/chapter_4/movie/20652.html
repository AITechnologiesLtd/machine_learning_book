<P>PLOT:
Two life-long losers, who need $50,000 in a jiffy to save the life of their
whore-loving Pops, start a business in the only service in which they
consider themselves to be experts: Revenge-for-hire!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This film stars a man whose humor I've always found to be funny, Norm
McDonald. It's also peppered with plenty of other comedian cameos, an
interesting premise, but unfortunately, doesn't deliver as many laughs as
you might expect. Is it because "America's Funniest Videos" host Bob Saget
is at the helm? I doubt it. He's actually much funnier in real life than any
of his corny lines from the show might indicate.</P>
<P>And in that respect, this film is actually mined with a lot of dry,
sarcastic humor and plenty of Normisms (He likes to mention crack, anal sex
and whores a lot!). But overall, it just seemed to lack any real interest in
their phony plight, and didn't provide enough good jokes to sustain anything
more than a half hour TV program. Of all the cameos, I thought the Don
Rickles one was the best, while Chris Farley deserved much more than his
two-bit stint. So if you don't go into this film expecting a laugh-out riot,
you might just be slightly entertained by a self-conscious Norm McDonald
basically playing himself. On the other hand, it goes without saying that if
you never enjoyed the man's humor in the first place, you will not
appreciate this movie either. Real fans only. Overall, an inferior
hit-and-miss SNL sketch gone long.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Norm McDonald is born in my hometown of Montreal, Canada. Most of this film
was shot in Toronto, Canada.
Chris Farley's bother Kevin plays one of the theatre workers in this film.
Co-screenwriter Fred Wolf also plays one of the homeless guys. He wrote
Chris Farley's 1996 film BLACK SHEEP and was an uncredited writer on his
1995 film TOMMY BOY.
Cameos in this film include Adam Sandler, Gary Coleman, John Goodman,
Rebecca Romjin-Stamos, Dini Petty and Chevy Chase.
This film is only 81 minutes long, and contains outtakes during the final
credits.</P>
