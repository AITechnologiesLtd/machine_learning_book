<P>Three things I learned from "Being John Malkovich": when getting on
the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a
building, always bring your crowbar; don't stand in the way of your
wife's actualization as a man; and, whenever entering a portal into
the mind of another human being, wear old clothes, because, hey, it's
muddy in there.</P>
<P>"Being John Malkovich" is the most original film to come down the pike
in a very long time. Wildly surrealistic, yet presented in a
down-to-earth, funky style, this is the kind of movie that sticks in
your head. After savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline,
you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it. From the
ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature
of identity itself, there's a lot to think about here.</P>
<P>Just don't forget to have fun. Clearly, all parties involved in the
making of the film certainly did, starting with writer Charles
Kaufman. "I wrote 'Being John Malkovich' without an outline," he
explains in the press notes, "blindly, with no sense of direction or
purpose. It's important to me that I don't have a map before I
start. This allows me to surprise myself, stay engaged, discover
things, and, hopefully, allow the unconscious to surface."</P>
<P>Spike Jonze (Mark Wahlberg's naïve buddy in "Three Kings") takes it
from there. The white-hot director of the Beastie Boy's "Sabotage," an
award-winning parody of '70s TV cop shows, as well as numerous other
music videos and commercials, eschews typical MTV flash for his
feature film debut. Jonze wisely realized that a storyline this
unusual is most effectively presented in a low-key style. His flat,
matter-of-fact approach works perfectly.</P>
<P>And then there's the cast. John Cusack plays control freak Craig
Schwartz, a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents
objecting to his remarkably expressive, but decidedly erotic puppet
shows. Over the years, his marriage to obsessive pet store employee
Lotte (Cameron Diaz) has devolved. Once passionate lovers, the two are
now little more than courteous roommates.</P>
<P>Financially strapped, Craig takes a job as an entry-level file clerk
at LesterCorp, located on the 7 1/2th floor of a Manhattan
Building. Navigating around Dr. Lester (Orson Bean), his 105 year-old
boss and Floris (Mary Kay Place), Lester's dotty secretary, Craig
tries to settle into his new position, but two things keep him
distracted. First, there's the beautiful and imperious Maxine
(Catherine Keener), who delights in tormenting Craig over his obvious
lust for her. And then there's the hole behind the file cabinet, which
turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich. Craig
learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the
subconscious of Malkovich, where they can experience life from his
point of view (with enough concentration, you can even influence his
actions). After 15 minutes, the visitor gets ejected and
unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the New Jersey
turnpike.</P>
<PRE>Then things get a little weird.</PRE>
<P>By the way, if you're concerned that I gave away too much of the plot,
rest assured - - I barely scratched the surface. One of the most
satisfying aspects of the fable is that Kaufman is not content to
simply milk laughs from his bizarre set-up. Instead, he crawls into
the dark premise as completely as Craig crawls into Malkovich,
rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical
implications of compromising another person's identity. He also
examines the consequences of the Malko-visits to Craig, Lotte, Maxine
and, of course, John Malkovich himself.</P>
<P>The performances are superb. Malkovich (best known to mainstream
audiences for his work in "Dangerous Liaisons," "In the Line of Fire,"
and as head psychopath in the guilty-pleasure "Con Air") tweaks his
own image in a dandy self-deprecating turn. Far from his effete,
vaguely reptilian persona, this Malkovich is just another schlub,
drinking with his pals and trying to get laid (incidentally, Charlie
Sheen also plays himself in a hilarious parody of his well-earned bad
boy reputation).</P>
<P>As always, John Cusack nails his part, handily pulling viewers along
even as Craig's actions become unconscionable. The big surprises come
from Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz, both playing against
type. Kenner, usually cast in icy subordinate roles, is terrific as a
highly intelligent, extremely manipulative femme fatale. Cameron Diaz,
barely recognizable under a mess of brown, curly hair, sheds her
perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into
extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in Malkovich.</P>
<P>"Being John Malkovich" stumbles towards the end, as Jonze and Kaufman
try too hard to resolve the various subplots. Additional characters
and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered
finale. Regardless, this contemporary "Alice in Wonderland" is a real
treat. I enjoyed watching "Being John Malkovich," but only later,
after reflecting on the film, did its resonance fully hit me. At one
point, Craig says, "Do you know what a metaphysical can of worms this
portal is?" Truer words were never spoken.</P>
