<P>   Say what you want about living in a big urban center like
New York: there's something about small-town life that's
positively alluring, or at least it seems that way when you sit
back in your comfortable cosmopolitan theater or screening
room to soak in bucolic charm.  You'd have to be a hard-
hearted cynical urbanite not to relish "Waking Ned Devine,"
Kirk Jones's absolutely delightful fable about a town that's tiny
even by the standards of a rural isle like Ireland.  Few other
films have ever rendered the beneficial effects of grand
larceny like this one, and in fact we can see why the Irish
would hesitate even to use the word "lie" to describe a
falsehood.  "Blarney" would be more to their fancy.</P>
<P>   The frothy escapade opens in the minuscule village of
Tullymore, pop. 52, as the major daily announces that
someone in the hamlet had purchased the winning lotto ticket.
Immediately Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen), a lifelong resident
of Tullymore, and his best friend Michael O'Sullivan (David
Kelly) concoct a plan to convince the lucky sod to share the
wealth with the entire village.  Since no one has yet come
forward to claim the prize, Jackie and Michael take out a slip
of paper and, ruling out Jackie's wife and themselves decide
that there are 49 possible winners.  Narrowing the list to the
18 who actually played the national raffle, they resolve to
soften up the winner, whoever it might be, by inviting the
entire community to a chicken dinner--an object lesson in the
beauty of sharing.  When one leg of chicken is left over, they
realize that one of their number is absent from the festivities,
Ned Devine (Jimmy Keogh), who they later discover is indeed
the holder of the winning ticket and who has died from a heart
attack upon hearing the news.  Jackie, his wife Annie
(Fionnula Flanagan), and Michael go to work on a plan to
convince their fellow citizens to testify falsely that Michael is,
in fact, the unfortunate deceased, Ned Devine.</P>
<P>   "Waking Ned Devine" is the sort of story that Frederic
Duerrenmatt would have written if he had been infected by
the spirit of a leprechaun.  In that Swiss playwright's work,
"The Visit," a fabulously wealthy woman bent on revenge
offers to donate to the Mitteleuropan town of Gullen a tidy
sum if its citizens would agree to murder a man who had
once left her pregnant and abandoned her.  In the hands of
writer-director Kirk Jones, that basic plot becomes the
inspiration for a dandy scheme to transfer big bucks to a
lovely, isolated village rather than simply let it return to the
national treasury to be reclaimed at a later time by someone
who probably did not a great need for the punts.</P>
<P>   The most exuberant scene takes place in the cottage of
Ned Devine as Jackie and Michael go to work on the dead
man (who is stiffly acted by Jimmy Keogh), giving the head
the cosmetic makeover the poor man deserves for his
involuntary posthumous contribution.  When a bridge falls out
of his mouth, they replace it gingerly, but not before mistaking
the remains of a chicken led for Ned's own intestines.  We
are made privy to some of the conventions and heartaches of
the local people, including a romance between Maggie
(Susan Lynch) and the guy she loves, farmer Pig Finn (James
Nesbitt) but cannot marry because the otherwise disarming
fellow sports a perpetually porcine odor.  Though Jim Kelly
(Brendan F. Empsey), the lotto man who has driven in from
Dublin to distribute the check for over 6 million pounds once
he is convinced of the identity of the winner, insists that
money changes people quite a bit, the word is that none of
the 52 denizens are likely even to leave the village. "They'll
spend all the money at Fitzgerald's" (the local pub), according
to a young lad wise beyond his years.</P>
<P>   Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau aside, how many
Hollywood studios would have given over a movie to a bunch
of old geezers such as the wonderful people who have lived
their lives in the town they cherish, refusing the glitter or
Dublin and London for the finer life of their tightly-knit
community?  "Waking Ned Devine," whose one irascible
citizen, Lizzy Quinn (Eileen Dromey) threatens to subvert the
entire plan by calling in the fraud, is a superbly crafted
comedy that might just make you long to leave the antiseptic
climate of your cosmopolitan hub for the cozy intimacy of a
life in the provinces.</P>
