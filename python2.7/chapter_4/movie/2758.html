<PRE>                                  BLACK BEAUTY
                       A film review by James Berardinelli
                        Copyright 1994 James Berardinelli</PRE>
<PRE>Rating (0 to 10):  7.4 </PRE>
<PRE>Date Released:  7/29/94 
Running Length:  1:28

<P>Starring:  Justin, Rat, Alan Cumming, David Thewlis, Andrew Knott, 
           Peter Davison 
Director:  Caroline Thompson 
Producers:  Robert Shapiro and Peter MacGregor-Scott 
Screenplay:  Caroline Thompson based on the novel by Anna Sewell 
Cinematography:  Alex Thomson 
Music:  Danny Elfman 
Released by Warner Brothers </P>
<P>     Even though it's eminently suitable for family viewing, the latest
adaptation of Anna Sewell's BLACK BEAUTY could be a film in search for
an audience.  Adults may avoid this movie because it's G-rated, based
on a children's book, and has actors speaking with British accents.
Children, on the other hand, may stay away because there are no musical
numbers with singing animals, no McDonald's Happy Meals, and actors who
speak with British accents.</P>
<P>     It's too bad, really, because BLACK BEAUTY is the best live-action
family viewing to come along since last summer's THE SECRET GARDEN
(also penned by screenwriter Caroline Thompson).  In addition to John
Sayles' as-yet-unreleased THE SECRET OF ROAN INNISH, both of these
films represent a rarity in pictures oriented towards the younger
crowd:  intelligent stories that can captivate parents.</P>
<P>     In many ways, BLACK BEAUTY is almost more of an adult movie than
one for children.  Restless kids are going to have difficulty sitting
through several of the slower portions, and the overall tone is more
somber than anything put out by Disney.  Even THE LION KING, with its
Shakespearean leanings, is ultimately lighter than BLACK BEAUTY.</P>
<P>     Not the first adaptation of the classic story, Caroline Thompson's
is the most faithful.  Told from the perspective of Black Beauty
(played by the stallion Justin, with a voice supplied by Alan Cumming),
the film follows the horse's adventures as he serves masters both kind
and cruel.  It's a tale of friendship, abuse, betrayal, and
redemption.  The setting moves from the verdant pastures of rural
England to the crowded streets of 19th-century London.</P>
<P>     The supporting cast, which includes such notable names as David
Thewlis (an up-and-coming actor whose credits include THE TRIAL, NAKED,
and PRIME SUSPECT 3) and Peter Davison (a veteran who has been in at
least three successful British television series--ALL CREATURES GREAT
AND SMALL, DOCTOR WHO, and CAMPION), is almost redundant.  The real
stars of this film are the horses, and the humans, no matter how
heartfelt their performances, are barely noticed.</P>
<P>     Tremendous camerawork by Alex Thomson and an effective score from
Danny Elfman (this sounds nothing like his Batman music) add to BLACK
BEAUTY's luster.  The film has the look and feel of something out of
Dickens, with a theme to match.</P>
<P>     Hopefully, BLACK BEAUTY will get the attention it deserves.  THE
SECRET GARDEN did, but that story is about humans, and the treatment
received by INTO THE WEST makes one wonder how much horse tales appeal
to the under-thirteen crowd (or, for that matter, the over-thirteen
crowd).  Regardless, this motion picture has a lot more to offer than
the typically-available brainless family entertainment.  It's worth the
price of admission even if you don't have a kid to bring with you.
Entertainment of this sort knows no age limits.</P>
