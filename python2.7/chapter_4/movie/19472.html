Susan Granger's review of "THE HAUNTING" (DreamWorks)</PRE>
<P>Eugenio Zanetti is the star of this film, no question about
it. He's the production designer who created Hill House, a spectacular
Gothic mansion that delivers one helluva performance as an ominous
haunted house that captures the imaginations of its guests. Zanetti
makes rooms collapse, even fold into themselves, and there's a demonic
bed whose canopy descends with tentacles like an octopus. Paintings,
carvings, statues, even curtains come alive. And there's the slow,
ghostly breathing emanating from deep inside.  The question is: why
would Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Lili Taylor want to play
second-fiddle to such an incredible creation that, in fact, makes them
seem wooden?  Looking terrified and screaming is really all that's
required in David Self's inane script, based on Shirley Jackson's
scare-classic, "The Haunting of Hill House." And the stylistic vision
of director Jan DeBont ("Speed," "Twister") truly revolves around the
special effects. As the story begins, Neeson, as a devious
psychologist, brings three insomniacs to Hill House, outside Boston,
for what he tells them is a sleep disorder study. In fact, he's
designed the experiment to observe the dynamics of fear, explaining:
"You don't tell the rats that they're actually in a maze."  But his
guests do know that, in the 1800s, a satanic textile manufacturer,
Hugh Crain, erected this stately "Taj Mahal" for his beloved wife and
their eight children, who are all buried nearby. What no one realizes
is that Hill House has become Crain's massive physical embodiment. On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Haunting" is a spooky 4,
playing tricks with your mind as you munch your popcorn. If you're
curious, director Robert Wise made a far more subtle, restrained
version (1963), available on video.</P>
