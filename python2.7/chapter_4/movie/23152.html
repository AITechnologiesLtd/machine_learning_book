<PRE>The Cider House Rules 
A film review by Marty Mapes 
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes </PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) The rules of the cider house remain unread for the
longest time. But in the meantime, there are other rules that everyone
follows, rules that help things run more smoothly. And these are the
rules that count.</P>
<P>THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is Lasse Hallström's adaptation of John Irving's
novel. It follows Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire in another solid,
well-delivered role), an orphan who grows to adolescence in a Maine
orphanage. The orphanage's doctor, Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine,
performing with a convincing American accent) raises Homer as though he
were his own. Under his tutelage Homer learns about general practice,
pediatrics, and yes, even gynecology.</P>
<P>Dr. Larch is relieved that Homer is growing into such a promising young
man because he'd hate to see the orphanage fall into the hands of more
traditional, less liberal doctors. (Dr. Larch is willing to perform
abortions, even though they are illegal in the 1940s). But Homer has
other ideas. He's lived his whole life in the orphanage and he wants to
get out. Besides, he's not willing to perform an abortion, in spite of
Dr. Larch's constant lecturing.</P>
<P>Eventually, Homer finds a way to leave, and he does. He takes the first
job he can find, picking apples. He starts a complicated yet rewarding
life outside the orphanage, where he finds love, work, money, and
friendship in the apple business, but Dr. Larch and the staff send him
reminders about how important it is for them that he return and take
over.</P>
<P>THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is sweet and sentimental. The characters are good
and well-meaning, even though the conflicts and complexities that
confront them are genuinely troubling. The characters address such
issues as abortion, violence, love, freedom, and responsibility. There's
a lot going on in THE CIDER HOUSE RULES, which should earn praise for
Hallström and Irving (who advised on the film and even plays a small
role as the stationmaster). </P>
<P>But the movie takes on too much for my tastes. The life in the orphanage
and the life outside could have made two different movies. Maybe 45
minutes of film time pass at the orphanage, and we think we know the
story and all the characters. But after Homer leaves,we meet a bushel of
new characters at the orchard. To Irving (and to Homer), the two parts
are equally important. But on film, the Y-shaped story doesn't seem
right.</P>
<P>Similarly, the film isn't sharp or incisive. Its message is soft and
mushy like applesauce, instead of clear and distilled, like hard cider.
Instead of jolting your mind, it's easy to swallow, plain and palatable.
It brings up hard issues like abortion, trauma, and fraud, but it never
takes a convincing stance one way or the other. In itself this is not a
criticism; in fact, it seems to be Irving's point -- that meaningful
rules can only be made by those who have to abide by them; but because
the movie asked so many interesting and controversial questions, I wish
it had at least told us what ITS rules were, and how it arrived at them.</P>
<P>But these points could work in favor of the movie, depending on your
tastes. For instance, you might say that merely addressing these issues
is enough, or that a sweet drama is no place for divisive political
issues. </P>
<P>For me, I wish the movie had narrowed and sharpened its focus. Still, I
enjoyed it overall. I was won over by the charming and simple
characters. Nobody had a mean streak. Nobody was the villain. The people
who caused pain and conflict were normal people making unoriginal
mistakes. Irving and Hallstrom gave them room to learn from their
mistakes, then let life flow on.</P>
