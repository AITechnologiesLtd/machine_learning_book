<PRE>_The_Gift_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The modestly budgeted _The_Gift_ marks a homecoming of sorts for
director Sam Raimi, who returns to his roots in the cinema of the
supernatural after a largely lambasted spin on the big-bucks mainstream
field with the Kevin Costner starrer _For_Love_of_the_Game_.  But unlike
his landmark _Evil_Dead_ splatter laffer series, Raimi is going for
straight-faced chills this time around--in a way, melding his flamboyant
_Evil_Dead_ instincts with the more cerebral thriller elements he
successfully tried on for size in _A_Simple_Plan_, his big studio
breakthrough.  To twist a tired cliché, the whole is a step short of the
sum of its parts.</P>
<P>One of the strongest parts in question is the central performance of
Cate Blanchett, shedding her usual period piece garb for the role of
Annie Wilson, a widowed mother of three sons in modern-day Brixton,
Georgia.  The gift of the title is Annie's clairvoyance, which enables
her to earn a modest living as a psychic reader despite the protests of
the town's more religious residents, who see her ability as the work of
the Devil.  When Jessica King (Katie Holmes), a vivacious young member of
Brixton high society, mysteriously disappears, Annie's gift forces her
into a prominent--albeit reluctant--place in the investigation. 
Blanchett's modulated turn is key to the psychological horror of the
piece; her controlled work as Annie finds herself increasingly unable to
control or make sense of her visions adds a layer of subtlety that not
only makes the proceedings a bit more unsettling but also consistently
grounded in a convincing reality.</P>
<P>For the most part, Blanchett's co-stars provide able support.  The big
surprise is Keanu Reeves, a real embarrassment as a villain in the
atrocious-as-a-whole _The_Watcher_, in the role of this film's main
baddie, hot-tempered redneck Donnie Barksdale (a part that would have
been a perfect fit for one of _The_Gift_'s writers, Billy Bob Thornton). 
As Donnie's abused wife and Annie's loyal client Valerie, Hilary Swank
makes an impression--unfortunately, however, one not as strong as the one
left by the ridiculously awful hair extensions she wears.  Holmes
memorably reveals another side of herself in every sense as the sexy
Jessica, and Greg Kinnear is ideally cast as her nice guy fiancé (though
one wonders why he's the only guy in town without an accent).  Sticking
out like a sore thumb from the rest of the cast is Giovanni Ribisi, who
plays a troubled young mechanic befriended by Annie.  Ribisi is a
talented actor, but he has a tendency to fly way off the handle if not
held properly in check--and that is the case here; it's hard to believe
that his scenery-devouring turn once generated some Oscar buzz.</P>
<P>And any preliminary awards buzz _The_Gift_ may have once had is
ultimately done in by Thornton and Tom Epperson's script.  To their
credit, they do succeed in setting up the flavor of this tiny Southern
town, and the character of Annie and her plight are well-drawn before
Blanchett's performance is factored in.  But the film is more a genre
piece than anything else, and it's under these more modest demands that
the script falls short.  While a few of the puzzle pieces come together
in an interesting way and there is the occasional creepy sequence (though
a lot of the credit for both goes to Raimi's ever-inventive visuals), the
film's central mystery is less than one.  The revelation of the person
responsible for Jessica's disappearance isn't so much a twist as an
inevitable, easily foreseeable turn; a fairly humdrum climax fails to
compensate for the disappointing lack of surprise--rendering this _Gift_
more akin to a lump of coal, albeit one with an uncommonly inviting
sheen.</P>
