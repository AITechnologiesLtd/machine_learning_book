<P>Anthony Minghella's Talented Mr. Ripley recalls his last directorial
effort, The English Patient, in one respect: both screenplays are adapted
from novels, and both take significant liberties in their adaptation. And
just as Minghella made an effective film out of English Patient that was
almost entirely unrelated to Michael Ondaatje's book, Ripley is an
fascinating film that owes very little to Patricia Highsmith's novel.</P>
<P>Matt Damon plays the Tom Ripley of the title, a working-class lad with a
flair for mimicry and forgery who goes on an errand to Italy: the father
of a Princeton-educated wastrel named Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law)
commissions Tom to track down Dickie and bring him back to New York, one
way or another. Plans change when Tom encounters Dickie and his girlfriend
Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow): the wealth and bonhomie of Dickie's social circle
affects Tom more than he had expected--and rather than Tom influencing
Dickie to leave behind his opulent lifestyle, the story chronicles the way
that lifestyle seduces Tom. One of the main themes here is the casual
cruelty of the privileged, as Dickie initially welcomes Tom into his
social sphere and later rebuffs him, calling him a "leech" and taking away
his newfound status. The film then shifts into thriller mode as Tom
assumes Dickie's name and persona, and carries on a tense balancing act in
simultaneously maintaining his "Tom" identity for those who know him that
way, and becoming "Dickie" for others.</P>
<P>The Ripley of Highsmith's novel was a calculating, amoral sociopath--the
fun lay in seeing what he could pull off--but Minghella's Ripley is
arguably more interesting. Damon gives Ripley's character, initially at
least, wide-eyed wonder at the luxurious expatriate life, and an innocent
though insecure spirit--there's a sense that he genuinely longs to be
accepted by Dickie, and ultimately acts out of frustration and jealousy.
He assumes the double identity in desperation, in order to extricate
himself from another problem, rather than for the pleasure of exploiting
Dickie's wealth and status, and tries to eliminate one of his personae so
that he can get out of his unwanted double life. (There is no sense, for
Highsmith's Ripley, that the trickery is anything but amusing and
profitable.) The irony, of course, is every lie seems to necessitate three
more, and that neither persona will obligingly fade away. The effect is
very Hitchcock--the suspense is considerable, and the trajectory of the
story sets up, as in the best Hitchcock (e.g., Vertigo), a strange play of
sympathies: the audience recognizes that the protagonist is deeply flawed,
yet hopes that he'll evade detection in the end. Law's portrayal of Dickie
as a self-assured womanizer who expects the world to revolve around him
encourages us to initially identify with Tom, and to continue to
sympathize with him even as he builds his network of deceit. (On the other
hand, Paltrow is oddly ineffective as Marge, largely because her character
is so entirely hung up on Dickie, for whom the audience has no sympathy;
it's hard to understand what she sees in him, and the audience waits in
vain for her to take on a personality of her own.)</P>
<P>As with English Patient, the film looks gorgeous--many of Italy's most
attractive settings, both interior and exterior, are on display--and as
with English Patient, Minghella uses the location to great effect. Tanned
and expensively dressed, Dickie seems to inhabit the sun-splashed beaches
of Italy, and Tom, scrawny and pale, could hardly seem more out of place
initially. Over the course of the film, Tom assumes the necessary
trappings--clothes and music tastes in particular--so that he can take
over Dickie's life convincingly, and yet the audience still identifies him
as the insecure working-class boy that appeared at the beginning. The
transformation from tourist into expatriate accordingly never seems quite
complete, of course, but Damon brings all his acting skills to bear on
having Tom gradually learn to fit into his high-toned surroundings, and
the result is impressive. Just as the desert divided two of the main
characters in English Patient, with Ralph Fiennes's character adapting to
it and Kristin Scott Thomas's character resisting, the Italian Riviera
both brings together and separates Tom and Dickie. But the overall feel of
this film has none of the lush romance of English Patient-- indeed, where
the earlier film was all about sweeping vistas and unlimited space,
Minghella achieves an increasingly claustrophobic feel in the second half
of Ripley, again in a rather Hitchcockian way: smaller interiors, shorter
cuts and snappier conversations.</P>
<P>The power of Talented Mr. Ripley lies in Damon's portrayal of Tom, though.
Minghella plays up the homoerotic aspects of the relationship between Tom
and Dickie, not so much to drive the plot as to drive home a point about
Tom: his whole life is built on hiding things, on playing a part, which
certainly describes the life of a closeted homosexual in the '50s.
Ironically, his double life begins when he lets this particular mask slip
a bit; his troubles ensue because he seems to assume that he no longer
needs to play that particular role. A grimmer irony is that Tom can never
stop playing a part, much as he wants to--and Damon makes it very clear
that he does want to, that whatever thrill he once got from assuming the
identity of others has dissipated. The ultimate result feels more like
tragedy than Hitchcockian thriller (few Hitchcock characters are drawn in
such a way that we regret their demise), tragedy in the Shakespearean
sense: Tom's insecurity and longing for acceptance set off a chain of
events that he is powerless to halt. Damon's performance is subtly
expressive--it seems that he's fated never to be allowed to unburden
himself completely, and it's that clamped-down aspect that draws the
audience's sympathy.</P>
<P>Equal parts character study and thriller, Minghella's Talented Mr. Ripley
is easily the equal of English Patient in depth, yet entirely different in
mood. Catch it before it leaves the theaters.</P>
