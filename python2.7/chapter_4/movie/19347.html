<PRE>                             EYES WIDE SHUT
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Mr. Kubrick would have been upset.  I take that back.  He would
have been totally pissed.  I'll get it out up front: Our screening was
interrupted by a fire alarm, which sent the entire San Francisco press
constituency outside for a full hour, and ultimately forced us to miss
about five minutes of the movie, right in the middle, where it was
getting juicy.</P>
<P>     That aside, this is one hell of a movie.  A somewhat bizarre cross
between A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and THE SHINING, EYES WIDE SHUT is the work
of a meticulous craftsman -- a luscious and rich odyssey through the
streets of New York, and into the minds of a couple of its residents.</P>
<P>     Those residents are Doctor Bill Hartford (Cruise) and his wife
Alice (Kidman), who live a pretty good life in Manhattan.  But when a
friend's (Pollack) party gets a little kinky – just enough to stir up
some long-hidden emotions – Alice confesses to a one-night stand that
never actually happened... but which she desperately wanted to.</P>
<P>     This sets Bill's mind in motion, sending him on something of an
accidental journey through the bowels of NYC, from a brief visit with a
hooker to a costume dealer who whores out his daughter to the biggest
damn orgy you've ever seen.  Or at least the biggest that I've ever
seen.</P>
<P>     All the while, Bill gets more and more convinced that his wife is
depraved and wanton, which only fuels his desires even more.  More than
a journey of the eye through these lavish sets, Bill's is a journey
inside the mind of the paranoid, and it gets him in a little too deep by
the movie's end.</P>
<P>     The movie isn't as raunchy as you might have heard.  In fact, it
almost seems tame except for the big orgy scene and a ton of naked
Kidman shots.  And no, Cruise does not wear a dress in the movie.</P>
<P>     EYES WIDE SHUT is a thrill to watch – if for no other reason than
to try and guess who is an underground sexual deviant and who isn't
(hint: everyone is, of course).  It is chilling and delicious at the
same time, and while the film is a bit obtuse, lacking the
gripping/clever endings of the rest of Kubrick's repertoire, it's a
fitting end to a brilliant career in the cinema.</P>
<PRE>     Frankly, I want to see it again.  Especially those lost five
minutes.</PRE>
