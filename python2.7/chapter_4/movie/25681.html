<P>   Move over, Inspector Javert.  You spent your whole career
tracking down the innocent Jean Valjean in Victor Hugo's
"Les Miserables," but for sheer fanaticism you have nothing
on Captain Victor Benezet, a San Juan cop with political
ambitions in Stephen Hopkins's tense, involving and adult
picture "Under Suspicion."  This detective thriller with
Hitchcockian undertones is of the sort that could be effective
on the live stage, as most of the action takes place within the
local police precinct, but Hopkins--exploiting a taut screenplay
by W. Peter Iliff and Tom Provost--has opened up the
operation to establish the exciting ambience of Puerto Rico
during its San Sebastian carnival.</P>
<P>   The film is the result of Gene Hackman's relentless search
for backing to remake the French film, "Garde A' Vue" which
he had seen some twenty years ago, finally hitting pay dirt
when Morgan Freeman's production company, Revelations
Entertainment, backed the project.  Claude Miller's 1981
picture, written by Michel Audiard and Jean Herman, featured
Michel Serrault in the role of a rich and envied notary married
to the beautiful and noble but impoverished Chantal (Romy
Schneider) who coldly ignores him, and is held on New
Year's Eve by Inspector Antoine Gallien (Lino Ventura) as a
suspect in the rape-murder of two young girls.  As in that
original version, the crime itself becomes merely a
background for an intricate verbal chess game between a cop
and a lawyer who, we learn, have quite a bit in common
except that the policeman is of a different race and not
as wealthy as the celebrated tax lawyer he interrogates.</P>
<P>   On the stage, the story would hold and audience simply by
the discipline and tenseness of the inquiry--a long night's
journey into day pitting Capt. Victor Benezet (Morgan
Freeman) against the rich and powerful attorney, Henry
Hearst, who, he becomes convinced, is guilty of raping and
killing two 13-year-old girls--particularly after confirming that
his prisoner is telling a heap of lies.  The combination of first-
rate acting by the two pros and the trenchant screenplay lead
us in the audience to realize that the real issue is the fight-to-
the-death of two strong protagonists, the police captain
determined to wear down his opponent, the lawyer incensed
that he is being held on what he repeatedly calls a ludicrous
charge.</P>
<P>   Hanging over the proceedings is the complex relationship
between the 57-year-old Henry Hearst and his astonishingly
beautiful and sophisticated 30-ish wife, Isabella (Monica
Bellucci).  Hearst, a photographer by avocation who
maintains that he is building an archive of the island's
chronology, in fact has his eyes on a subject with quite a bit
less history: 13-year-old girls.  His regard for them,
particularly for his adorable niece Camille, is a source of
regular provocation to his lovely wife, who like the women in
Aristophanes' "Lysistrata" has been by locking him out of the
bedroom.  Increasingly depressed, desperate for attention
and affection, and most of all self-destructive, Hearst seeks
out the company of low-class street hookers despite his
ability to afford services of the highest-price escort services. 
Putting two and two together, Capt. Benezet--a former
colleague of his prisoner with whom he is on a first-name
basis--is convinced of the lawyer's guilt, and while he uses
his brain to break the man down, he must at the same time
restrain the young, callow and handsome detective who
assists in the questioning, Felix Owens (Thomas Jane).</P>
<P>   We have to suspend judgment a bit in watching this film
and do so happily given the tension that the production
affords us.  In real life, a smart and rich tax attorney would
abide by the adage that a man who acts as his own lawyer
has a fool for a client.  No way would Hearst be willing to
expose so many of his family problems to a captain who is
out to nail him regardless of the cordiality the two had known
in the past.  That done, we can enjoy the cat-and-mouse
game while taking in the fun and games of the revelers
outside doing a modest imitation of Rio's annual Mardi Gras. 
Although Benezet's questioning takes place wholly within the
immediate vicinity of the police station, Hopkins has a stylish
way of putting Benezet imaginatively next to Hearst in the
outdoor scenes when, of course, the cop is nowhere near the
accused in and around the neighborhood of La Perla where a
murder had taken place.</P>
<P>   One wonders why Hackman needed to wait for a score of
years to get this film produced given its mastery of the
techniques of detective thrillers.  Could the studios really
have believed that "Under Suspicion" would be incapable of
attracting a large audience simply because the picture
substitutes explosive men for exploding building and features
neither car crashes nor invisible men?</P>
