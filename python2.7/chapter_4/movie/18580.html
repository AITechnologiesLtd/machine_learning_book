<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>`You can't buy what I've got,' proclaims glowingly proud Aussie Darryl
Kerrigan.</P>
<P>And why shouldn't he be happy?  Darryl (Michael Caton) has a tiny home
with several below-code additions that's located next to both power
lines and the airport.  His wife (Anne Tenney) is a wonderful cook and
home decorator.  His oldest son Wayne (Wayne Hope) is currently
incarcerated for a botched gas station stick-up.  His only daughter
(Sophie Lee) has married a kickboxing Greek (Eric Bana).  His
budding-entrepreneur son Steve (Anthony Simcoe) spends his time
inventing odd items and searching the classified sections for bargains.
And his youngest boy Dale (Stephen Curry, who is also the film's
narrative) makes his contributions to the family by randomly digging
holes in the yard.</P>
<P>Darryl's dream life is abruptly halted when he receives a letter stating
that the expanding airport is buying his land out from underneath him.
An angered Darryl tries to fight City Hall, but fails miserably.  If it
sounds like a TV show, it almost is.  The Castle was written by four
seasoned sitcom scribes and directed by Rob Sitch, also an old hand at
television sitcoms.  They knocked out the script in two weeks and shot
the film in eleven days with one camera.  But the film is as fresh and
funny as any lengthy American production.  (1:22 – R for adult language)</P>
