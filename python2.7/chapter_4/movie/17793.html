<PRE>EXISTENZ
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Writer and director David Cronenberg enjoys pushing the edge of the
envelope.  Some of his movies, like CRASH about people who stage auto
accidents for sexual arousal, are stylish misses, and others, like
EXISTENZ about a virtual reality game made solely of biological
components, are mesmerizing.</P>
<P>The story opens with a focus group about to try the new game,
"eXistenZ," from world renowned "game pod goddess" Allegra Geller.
Allegra, who dresses in a short shirt and wears spike heals, is played
with confidence and intelligence by Jennifer Jason Leigh from GEORGIA.
The company introducing the game has the building under such tight
control that metal detectors screen all entrants.  This does not help
Allegra, however, when she is wounded by a would-be assassin.  He
carries an organic gun that fires human teeth, which renders the metal
detector useless.  The rest of the movie has her and her $28 million
dollar game pod on the run.</P>
<P>Along as her bodyguard in her flight is GATTACA's Jude Law as Ted Pikul.
Ted, as Allegra is upset to discover, doesn't even carry a weapon since
he's actually just a marketing intern at the company and not in security
at all.</P>
<P>The techo future they live in looks a lot like 1950's tacky, complete
with cheap motels and old gas stations run by grease monkeys.  About the
only changes are that people don't bother actually doing the physical
things, like skiing, that they used to do before the advent of powerful
virtual reality systems.</P>
<P>The story's success stems from the concept of the system itself and from
the intricate world built around it.  The game pod looks like some
bodily organs covered with a rubbery outer substance.  To connect to the
game pod you must have a bioport.  A bioport is "just" a hole in your
spine in which you attach an umbilical cord-like device that runs to the
game pod.  Just like we have places in the mall to do ear piercing, they
have licensed establishments to puncture your spine.  (As you might
guess, this being a Cronenberg film, one of the few sexual scenes will
involve a tongue and a bioport.)</P>
<P>Allegra talks a very reluctant Ted into going into her game with her.
Willem Dafoe, as an extra greasy grease monkey named Gas, is called upon
to install a quick and dirty bioport on Ted.  Ted doesn't like this idea
at all.  "I have this phobia about having my body penetrated
surgically," he tells Allegra.  "You know what I mean?" Actually, she
doesn't, since living in a game world for her is more natural than
existing in the real world.</P>
<P>If you're squeamish about gore and goo, EXISTENZ probably isn't the film
for you.  The pods, which contain nothing but biological parts, are
frequently sliced open and operated on as blood flies everywhere.  The
movie becomes a crazy mixed up world like a "Twilight Zone" episode
about a game show on the "Surgery Channel."  There are wild jokes about
how the characters in the game have underwritten roles and are played
with bad accents by poorly cast actors.  The film, with its steel-gray
blue cinematography and its creepy music, never fails to hold your
attention.</P>
<P>Poor Ted finds Allegra's game almost impenetrable, complaining that in
the game "the rules are indecipherable and possibly non-existent."  This
is all true and is what makes the movie so fascinating to observe.
"There is some weird reality effect happening here," Allegra says.  "I'm
not sure if I get it."  And the story is such a mind trip that most of
the audience will be equally and pleasantly confused as well.</P>
<P>"What are you doing," Allegra asks during the game when Ted crunches
into some gross-looking food at a Chinese restaurant near the trout farm
where they work.  "I don't know," he says honestly.  "I find this
disgusting, but I can't help myself."  My sentiments exactly.  And could
you please bring on the next course.</P>
<P>EXISTENZ runs a fast 1:37.  It is rated R for violence, gore, profanity
and sexuality and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
