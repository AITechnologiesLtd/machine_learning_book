<P>   One online critic ended his review of "Titus" with the
comment, "If you like slasher films, check it out."  How silly. 
If this comment were valid, the one theater in New York
showing the film would have been crowded with teens, but
not a one was in sight (which could mean that none were on 
site of that reviewer).  Sure, there are some meetings of knife
with flesh in Julie Taymor's wonderfully vivid and visceral
adaptation of the early play by Shakespeare "Titus
Andronicus"--which has more in common with Jacobean
melodrama than Shakespearean tragedy.  But this
play--underrated and underplayed through the centuries
because some effete intellectuals thought it was too bloody to
be taken quite seriously--is masterful in its evocation of
humanity's thirst for revenge, for bloodletting, for the
vindication of some cause of other.  Look only to the endless
cycle of action and retaliation which during the present
decade has pitted Tutsis against Hottentots, or Croats and
Serbs and Muslims against one another to see that "Titus
Andronicus" is no period piece irrelevant to contemporary
times.</P>
<P>   Using Dante Ferretti's smashing production design, "Titus,"
filmed mostly in Italy especially by Hadrian's Villa and
Mussolini's 1930s government center, Taymor wisely and
imaginatively avoids making this a museum piece.
In the spirit of such recent adaptations as Baz Luhrmann's
1996 "Romeo and Juliet" (albeit without that creation's blatant
immaturity), Taymor has forged a well-developed, innovative
construction with some remarkable acting by seasoned British
performers spouting dialogue that remains true to the Bard's
literary genius.  Taymor has reigned in the special effects
team to avoid any semblance of a video-game mentality,
saving the fantasy impressions for an occasional display of
the title character's supposedly insane mind-state, while
throwing in contemporary touches like the Thunderbird on
which the emperor Saturninus rides into town, an infrequent
appearance by motorcycles, tanks and trucks, and a
scattering of 20th century firearms.  Aside from these, the
film makes us aware that we are indeed in the ancient Rome
of the Fifth Century, with a young man from the 1990s
bearing witness to a world in which human destructive
passions are not much different from those of his own time.</P>
<P>   Taymor--who directed Broadway's hit musical "The Lion
King"--opens the scene on a youth of about 11 years who is
playing destructively with toy soldiers on a kitchen table,
overturning all the food in sight with his marauding armies. 
An explosion erupts and the boy is seized by a Mad Max
character and transported to the Roman Colosseum where he
witnesses a horde of gladiators marching simultaneously to
an unheard beat to celebrate the return of General Titus
(Anthony Hopkins) from his successful campaign up north
against the Goths. Having lost twenty-one sons in battle,
Titus is in no mood to appease his important prisoners,
notably the Queen of the Goths, Tamora (Jessica Lange) and
Tamora's sons.  He therefore promptly orders the execution
of her firstborn--thus setting in motion a plethora of revenge
fantasies.  When Titus's daughter Lavinia (Laura Fraser)
rejects a marriage offer by Emperor Saturninus (Alan
Cumming), the emperor willfully takes the Gothic queen as
his wife, never realizing that Tamora has a secret lover who
plots against all, the unrepentant and evil Moor Aaron (Harry
Lennix).  When Tamora's idiotic sons Chiron (Jonathan Rhys
Meyers) and Demetrius (Matthew Rhys) rape Lavinia, cutting
off her hands and replacing them with twigs while slashing
out her tongue to prevent her from accusing them, Titus vows
to vindicate his daughter in a culinary fashion.</P>
<P>   "Titus Andronicus," which foreshadows more thoroughly
realized and developed works like "King Lear," also features
scenes which would be given berths in "Hamlet" (Titus's
feigned insanity) and "Othello" (Aaron's Iago-like
wickedness).  Anthony Hopkins does a splendid job of
exhibiting his character in all modes of conduct, humorous
when serving a vindicating meat pie to the emperor,
diabolical when affecting derangement, pitiful when
contemplating his mangled daughter Lavinia, resolute in
planning his strategy against the establishment.  Alan
Cummings, who is at his best in lightly humorous roles such
as his performance as a hotel desk clerk in "Eyes Wide
Shut," is not as convincing as the habitually enraged leader
of the world's most powerful empire, but Jessica Lange
sparkles as the seductress who ably covers her sinister
designs behind benevolent smiles.  </P>
<P>   Despite the difficulty that a modern audience might expect
from a work that keeps Shakespeare's 16th Century English
intact, this "Titus" is easily accessible to the sophisticated
audience to whom it is directed.  Taymor's direction is so
physical that the actions speak for themselves, gestures and
deeds pumped up ably by Elliot Goldenthal's puissant score
and Luciano Tovoli's lavish camerawork.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 162 minutes.  (C) 1999
