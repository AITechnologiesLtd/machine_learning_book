<P>     With 1964's GOLDFINGER, the third James Bond story to reach the 
screen, the "Bond formula" had reached maturity.  Screenwriter Richard 
Maibaum, a participant in the scripting of the previous two movies, DR. 
NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, had identified those elements of the 
series that audiences liked.  So, for this film, his storyline (adapted 
loosely from Ian Fleming's 1959 novel) enhanced the action sequences, 
added more beautiful women, gave 007 an Aston Martin loaded with neat 
gadgets, and offered actor Sean Connery more opportunities to deliver 
one-liners and act suave.</P>
<P>     One of the last Bond films to clock in at under two hours, 
GOLDFINGER is tightly-paced and economical in its usage of extraneous 
material.  The character development of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is 
replaced by a greater attention to action.  There are several memorable 
fight sequences (including a climactic struggle between 007 and 
Goldfinger's nasty henchman, Oddjob) and a lengthy car chase that has 
Bond's Aston Martin trailing smoke screens and oil slicks, firing built-
in guns, and ejecting the passenger seat.  The level of excitement in 
GOLDFINGER is up a notch from its predecessors.</P>
<P>     When the British Secret Service decides that they want supposedly-
legitimate bullion dealer Auric Goldfinger under observation, agent 007 
is chosen for the job.  After Bond finds a naked, dead woman on his bed, 
covered head-to-toe with gold paint, the investigation takes on a new 
urgency.  It seems that Goldfinger is planning something big -- 
"Operation Grand Slam" -- and anyone who interferes is targeted for 
elimination, including, of course, Bond.  But, when Goldfinger captures 
the British agent in Switzerland, he decides to keep him as a hostage 
rather than kill him.  So Bond accompanies the criminal and his 
entourage to Kentucky, where Goldfinger plans to engineer the greatest 
crime in history:  knock over Fort Knox.</P>
<P>     Sean Connery, back for the third time in the role that made him 
famous, plays the lead character with the same easy elegance and wit he 
displayed in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.  007 can be a man of action or a man 
of style, and Connery is equally at home as either.  In GOLDFINGER, Bond 
gets one of his better opponents.  The title character (played by Gert 
Frobe) isn't the most sinister or vicious villain to stand against 007, 
but he is intelligent, ingenious, and obsessed with gold.  Frobe's 
performance is top-notch for this kind of role.  He treads the line 
between subtlety and overacting, showing different aspects of 
Goldfinger's shifting personality -- cruelty, greed, playfulness, and a 
single-minded determination.</P>
<P>     In Bond films, the henchman typically provides a more colorful 
adversary than his leader, and Goldfinger's mute Korean manservant, 
Oddjob (Harold Sakata), started this trend.  Second only to Jaws (THE 
SPY WHO LOVED ME, MOONRAKER) in near-invincibility, Oddjob is the kind 
of murder-loving ruffian that Bond can't beat in a fair fight.  With his 
death-dealing, frisbee-like bowler and his immense strength, Oddjob 
proves a worthy foe for the superspy.</P>
<P>     In addition to being one of the most unforgettable of the "Bond 
Girls", Honor Blackman's Pussy Galore is one of the toughest and most 
self-sufficient women to cross 007's path.  In her own words, she's 
immune to his charm, and, while this doesn't prevent her from sharing an 
intimate moment or two with him, she never yields her independence.  
Pussy has better things to do than follow Bond around like a faithful 
lap dog.</P>
<P>     GOLDFINGER is studded with moments that have since become deeply 
embedded in the Bond mythos.  John Barry's opening song (sung by Shirley 
Bassey) is among the series' best.  Snippets of dialogue have attained 
an almost-legendary status, such as the exchange when Goldfinger is 
about to emasculate 007 with a laser.  "Do you expect me to talk?" asks 
Bond.  The response is succinct:  "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"</P>
<P>     In the midst of Bond's "golden era" of the '60s, it's hard to 
single out one film as the best, but history has shown GOLDFINGER to be 
among the series' most enduring entries.  Although more gimmicky than 
FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, this film is equally as entertaining.  And, of 
course, it takes the Bond films in a slightly different direction, 
blazing a trail that they have been following ever since, all the way 
from GOLDFINGER to GOLDENEYE.</P>
