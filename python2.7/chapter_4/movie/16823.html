RONIN
Reviewed by Pierce Dalton
3 stars (out of 4)</PRE>
<PRE> Ronin is a very complicated film.</PRE>
<P> It is also a very slick, imaginative, thrilling film from director John
Frankenheimer, whose 1996's film, Island of Dr. Moreau, left little to be
desired.</P>
<P> The plot involves a bunch of international operatives (some ex-KGB) joining
together to steal a briefcase away from a very powerful and wealthy man.</P>
<P> What's in the briefcase we don't know.  Neither does Sam (Robert De Niro), the
so-called leader of the operative group.</P>
<P> If you're thinking that bit resembles Pulp Fiction, you're not alone.</P>
<P> Tailing the briefcase all over Europe, Sam and his elite group (including Jean
Reno) set up all kinds of booby traps and whatnots to trap the man and
briefcase. The film has a sort of James Bond feel to it, yet, generates more
energy from its action sequences than any 007 film I have seen, including
1997's Tomorrow Never Dies.</P>
<P> De Niro and Reno work great together.  They have that rare flare for acting
that never goes stale, even in the midst of a film like Ronin, which, if you
get right down to it, is very intelligent, atmospheric, and dopey.</P>
<P> One thing that really heightens the film to intensity are its spectacular car
chase scenes.  They are among the best I have seen.</P>
<P> A long drawn-out one, featured in the now-famed tunnel where Princess Diana
died in Paris, is a dizzying, frenzied, pure rush or energy.</P>
<P> Director Frankenheimer has abandoned Moreau's Island and created a very sassy
thriller, and some breathtaking views, in Paris and Rome.</P>
<P> Do Sam and the gang capture the briefcase?</P>
<PRE> I won't tell.</PRE>
<PRE> See for yourself.</PRE>
<P> You'll never look at a car the came again.</P>
