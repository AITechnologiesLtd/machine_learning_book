<PRE>WINGS OF DESIRE
Rating: **** (out of four)
PG-13, 1987
Directed by Wim Wenders. Written by Wenders and Peter Handke.
Starring Bruno Ganz, Otto Sander, Solveig Dommartin.</PRE>
<P>Not many modern films open with a shot of a lonely angel sitting on top of
a Berlin skyscraper, peering down at the city and its inhabitiants. WINGS
OF DESIRE, a film by German director Wim Wenders, does exactly that. This
angel, whose name is Damiel (Bruno Ganz), is having something of a crisis.
He has spent eternity with his companion Cassiel (Otto Sander), working to
spread compassion and hope among humans, but he is beginning to wish he
could share in the human experience. He wonders what it would be like to
have a cup of coffee, or feel a breeze on his face, or, more importantly,
fall in love. He gets an opportunity for the latter when he starts paying
attention to Marion (Solveig Dommartin), a lonely trapeze artist whose act
is going out of business.</P>
<P>Wenders asks the audience to swallow a large dose of peculiar ideas for
this film. First and foremost, we are asked to believe that angels are
simply God's errand boys: they go from place to place dispensing happiness,
and they are pleased when they have a positive effect on someone, but they
don't seem to be able to share in this happiness. Wenders also asks us to
accept that when Damiel appears in a dream to Marion, it is apparently so
vivid and real that when she sees him in the flesh, she instantly accepts
him as her true soul-mate. There's also the issue of whether the human or
angelic experience is more "real," though this is never really resolved.
Finally, there is the role played by Peter Falk, who happens to be making a
detective movie in Berlin and who eventually fits into the story in a way
that can only be described as unique and unexpected. That's not to say that
any of these ideas are bad, just that they really come from out of left
field.</P>
<P>Ultimately, however, what emerges is a poetic and artistically ambitious
film that serves as an examination of various facets of spirituality. There
isn't really much of a plot in this film, other than Damiel's
self-examination and eventual decision to "take the plunge" and become
human, but I don't think it needs one. Wenders is content to let his camera
wander through Berlin, following the angels as they spread intellectual
inspiration in a library, or comfort lonely subway passengers, or ruminate
on what it was like the first time anyone ever laughed (they have, after
all, been around for eternity). Their scenes are shot in black and white
and often accompanied by low, meditative music, while Damiel's scenes after
he becomes human are shot in color, backed up by the sounds of everyday
life in the city. Much of Damiel's attention is devoted to Marion, of
course, while Cassiel's "favorite human" seems to be an old writer whom he
often finds in the library or sitting in a deserted lot in the city.</P>
<P>What Wenders seems to be getting at is that there is a spiritual dimension
to human emotional and physical experiences, whether it's something as
complicated as falling in love or creating a work of art, or something as
simple as running around kicking dirt or finding a peaceful, isolated place
and sitting there, or even something seemingly unpleasant such as
loneliness. Damiel and Cassiel are the right characters for Wenders's
meditation on humanity, as apparently spiritual beings who are deprived of
sense experience. I kind of doubt that angels would actually be confined to
knowledge of the ethereal only, but the film wisely refrains from declaring
itself as theology and can easily be read as an allegory about human
existence.</P>
<P>Wenders and co-writer Peter Handke have created a haunting, hypnotic
testament to human spirituality in WINGS OF DESIRE. There's quite a bit of
metaphysics floating around here, and I'm not sure if all of it makes sense
or is explained very well, but on the other hand this isn't really the
point of the film. This is the sort of film that should be approached the
way one might approach a poem or a piece of music rather than an essay or a
novel. Its intellectual foundations may be tenuous, but its spiritual and
emotional impact is more than enough to make up for it.</P>
