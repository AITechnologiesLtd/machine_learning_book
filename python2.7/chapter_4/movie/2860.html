<PRE>                                 QUIZ SHOW
                       A film review by Eric Mankin
                        Copyright 1994 Eric Mankin</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Robert Redford.
Written by Paul Attanasio.
With John Turturro, Rob Morrow, Ralph Fiennes, Paul Scofield and 
     David Paymer. </PRE>
<P>     Robert Redford's dramatic reconstruction of the 1958 Van Doren
television scandals is profound, unpredictable and scathingly funny,
packed from its center to its bit player edges with acutely observed,
brilliantly acted characters  It consolidates ideas about family and
fatherhood, Gentile and Jew, celebrity and corruption that Redford has
been dealing with as actor and director for years, and does so
effortlessly and organically, without moralizing or contrivance.  It
recreates in achingly perfect detail a tail-finned, wood-veneer
black-and-white TV America without ever retreating into nostalgia.
It's about as good as movies get.</P>
<P>     The audience's guide into the film's universe is young Dick
Goodwin (Rob Morrow), first in his class at Harvard Law School, as he
continually reminds the world; Jewish, as the late-fifties world
frequently reminds him.  He has come to Washington D.C., to work for
the government, postponing the high money Wall Street career he sees as
inevitable for reasons that aren't clear to him; unconsciously looking
for a main chance that will redefine his life.  He finds it in a small
newspaper story about allegations of fixing in quiz shows, hit
programming in the exploding new medium of television.</P>
<P>     The film has already shown, in blistering detail, the origin of
that newspaper story.  Herb Stempel (John Turturro) had reigned for
weeks as resident genius on NBC's "Twenty One," mopping his sweating
brow inside the isolation booth, astounding the nation by knowing not
only the name of the man who lent Paul Revere a horse for his midnight
ride, but the fact that the horse was a mare.</P>
<P>     But then the show's producer, Dan Enright (David Paymer) had
decided, in consultation with the network and the sponsor, that Stempel
had run his string; that the country was tired of a nerd-next-door with
bad teeth from Queens, that it was time to find someone different:
someone more graceful, better looking, classier, less Jewish--someone
like Columbia professor Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), son and
nephew of Pulitzer prize winners; someone with a fresh face eager to
talk enthusiastically about television's role in educating the American
public.  Moving Herbie out and Charlie in takes Mephistophelean
abilities of manipulation.  But Enright can offer not just vast sums of
money, but the gleaming lure of television itself, "the biggest thing,"
as Herbie accurately tells his wife, "since Gutenberg." By the time the
deal has soured, and Stempel has called foul, Van Doren is a national
hero.  Goodwin's investigation bounces off a seamless wall compounded
from Enright's imaginative deceit, and Charlie's seemingly guileless
charm.</P>
<P>     "Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall," Van Doren quotes
Shakespeare at a glittering literary birthday party in Connecticut,
words spoken precisely at the peak of the trajectory that is carrying
him to a humiliation of his own creation.  The remarkable achievement
of this film is the dimension it gives this fall.</P>
<P>     The contributions to the achievement can be listed.  First, Paul
Attanasio's screenplay is in a class by itself.  Looking back years
into films, it is hard to remember one that does as many different
things in as many different ways as this one.  Ironically (considering
the subject) television may have been a beneficent influence  With the
virtual preemption of film to tell stories centered on vehicles,
explosions, and special effects, (and QUIZ SHOW was passed on
repeatedly by other studios at least in part because of the absence
these elements before being picked up by Disney) TV has become a refuge
for stories centering on character, in shows like "N.Y.P.D.  Blue"
or "Homicide," on which Attanasio collaborated with Barry Levinson
(who plays Dave Garroway in the film).  TV writing in the episodic
ensemble form invented by Steven Bochco long ago broke out of the old
film chestnut of every film being one person's story.</P>
<P>     Attanasio may be the first film writer to have thoroughly absorbed
Bochco's lessons.  While Goodwin remains at the center, the
exceptionally broad focus and reach of the story, the insistence on
seeing and telling the story from multiple points of view creates an
amazing density of texture.</P>
<P>     This sounds abstract, so perhaps one other note is in order.  QUIZ
SHOW is, quite apart from its other virtues, the funniest film of the
year.  Some of its characters are intentionally funny--as Herbie
Stempel's anguished, eloquent rages against the gods of TV--some
equally inspired unintentionally so, as when Dan Enright's cohort
Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) asks what "a grejus" is, following a
conversation in which Van Doren objects to being simply given answers
to questions as "egregious."  In the same conversation Van Doren has
previously taken a moment to think things over: "I'm just trying to
imagine what Kant would make of this." "He'd go along with it,"
Freedman assures him.</P>
<P>     The actors run with it.  It was obvious from SCHINDLER'S LIST that
Ralph Fiennes--however he wants to pronounce his name--was good; this
film makes clear *how* good.  As the beautiful, flawed Charlie,
intrigued by the glittering new toy of television, trapped by his
vanity and desire to please his father, undone by his own inability to
lie about it, Fiennes turns an historical footnote into someone you
seem to have known all your life.</P>
<P>     Paul Scofield plays his father, the poet.  Scofield has played
Lear, and played him well; here he is given, along with much else, two
transparently simple lines; one about his joy: "not till you have a
son!" and one about his pain: "your name is mine," and makes each one a
world.</P>
<P>     It is no surprise that John Turturro is unforgettable as the
twitchy Herbie, paranoid for the best of reasons--people are out to get
him; the surprising thing is that a performance like this can't steal
the film, because the acting everywhere, *everywhere*, from all sides
is so seamlessly, uniformly, universally remarkable: Morrow (from
"Northern Exposure") subtly shading Goodwin's internal insecurities
behind a big cigar; David Paymer as Enright the wheedling fixmeister
(by the end of the film, you believe that on his deathbed he tried to
buy off the Angel of Death by offering him a job on a TV panel show.)
And on, and on and on, through the small but completely rounded parts
of Goodwin and Stemple's wives, (Johann Carlo and Mira Sorvino); or the
main-battle-tank-like presence of Allan Rich as the President of NBC.
If the film deconstructs conventional wisdom on unitary film story, it
writes in letters of fire another old saw: "there are no small roles.
There are only small actors."</P>
<P>     This kind of texture doesn't happen by accident.  Redford has
always been an exceptional director of actors.  Here, he orchestrates
the performances with a touch so light that it doesn't seem to be
there: the story seems to tell itself, to be assembling itself before
our eyes, absolutely autonomous, yet reverberating with films as
diverse as ELECTRIC HORSEMAN, THE CANDIDATE, DOWNHILL RACER, ALL THE
PRESIDENT'S MEN, THE WAY WE WERE, ORDINARY PEOPLE, A RIVER RUNS THROUGH
IT, suddenly casting all of them into a new line leading here.  If
Redford never exposes another frame of film, he has his place in the
pantheon: this is a great movie.</P>
