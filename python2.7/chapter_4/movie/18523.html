<PRE>I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 70</PRE>
<P>"I Wanna Hold Your Hand" is an early directorial
effort by Robert Zemeckis, the Spielberg protege
whose biggest success, "Back to the Future", would
come seven years later.  The title is derived
from the Beatles' first #1 single in America.
This is appropriate, since the film is about the
wave of Beatlemania sweeping America in February
1964.</P>
<P>The Beatles are about to appear on the Ed Sullivan
show.  A group of New York teenagers, with varying
motives, are eager to get tickets to the performance.
Wide-eyed bride-to-be Pam (Nancy Allen) wants some
equivalent of a wedding shower, brash Rosie (Wendie Jo
Sperber) and nerdy Richard (Eddie Deezen) are obsessed
fans, Larry (Marc McClure) is hoping to score with
ambitious photographer Grace (Theresa Saldana), while
folkie Janis (Susan Kendall Newman) and greaser Tony
(Bobby Di Cicco) want to sabotage the appearance.</P>
<P>A screwball comedy ensues.  The kids get into and out
of trouble, experience setbacks and triumphs, break
multiple laws and cause much chaos.  All for an
opportunity to see the Beatles.  But a happy ending
is in store for all concerned.  Even Tony comes around,
although it takes a bolt of lightning to do the job.</P>
<P>The authenticity is impressive.  The soundtrack
consists of glorious, original Beatles songs, contemporary
with those available to fans in Feb. 1964.  While
there are clever, dead-on vocal imitations of the
Fab Four, whenever their faces are shown, it's the
real thing and not an impersonation.  There is an
Ed Sullivan impersonator (Will Jordan), but his Sullivan
schtick is perfect.  (One ironic moment has 'Sullivan'
announcing that next week's show includes comic
Will Jordan.)  The adult indifference to, and contempt
for, the cultural phenomenon also seems accurate.</P>
<P>Of course, sometimes the silliness goes overboard.
A drunken Larry knocks unconscious a man easily
twice his size.  Selfish Grace makes an unlikely
career sacrifice for the sake of dweeby Larry.
Janis, who prefers Paul Stookey to Paul McCartney,
has an unexplained transformation from Beatles
protestor to Beatles fan.</P>
