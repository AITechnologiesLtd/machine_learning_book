<PRE>Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero</PRE>
<P>Chad'z Rating: ** (out of 4 = fair/below average)</P>
<P>1998, no MPAA rating, 67 minutes [1 hour, 7 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[action/adventure]</PRE>
<P>Starring: Michael Ansara (voice of Mr. Freeze/Dr. Victor Fries), Loren Lester 
(voice of Robin/Dick Grayson), Mary Kay Bergman (voice of Barbara 
Gordon/Batgirl), Kevin Conroy (voice of Batman/Bruce Wayne); written by Boyd 
Kirkland, Randy Rogel; produced and directed by Boyd Kirkland; based on the 
television series `Batman: The Animated Series' and characters appearing in 
DC comic books; Batman created by Bob Kane</P>
<P>Seen June 1, 1999 on home video (rented)
[critic's note: this film was not produced with the intention of a theatrical 
release and therefore went straight to home video, although it may have been 
show on television.]</P>
<P>        Anyone who knows something about the modern comic book industry knows 
that no other single character has had more comic series and specials than 
Batman. Unfortunately, as is the case with a lot of mass production, the 
quality can't always be pinnacle and the result is often gratuitous, weak 
meaningless stories told because they can be, which `Batman & Mr. Freeze: 
SubZero' is the equivalent of in terms of an animated motion picture. It's a 
product produced just because it could be and the lack of effort is clear.</P>
<P>        There really isn't too much to say about the film because there's 
hardly anything to it. It's a direct-to-video movie obviously intended for 
parents to buy their children, but it's also based on a television series 
which is most certainly not your average kid's cartoon. The show is as dark 
as an Alex Proyas film with an equal amount of artistic styling and very 
smart teleplays. But this movie has very little to do with the series itself 
and at times feels like the producers threw together a bunch of unused clips 
and added in a few new scenes to tie them all together.</P>
<P>        In fact, the movie is so dependent upon the fact it's a spin-off from 
the show, it doesn't take the time to define any back story which is why it 
never succeeds for all the reason the show does.</P>
<P>        It starts off simple enough, we're shown a man living in the arctic 
with an Eskimo boy and his cryogenically frozen wife. For the 
Batman-ignorant, his name is Victor Fries (Ansara), a/k/a `Mr. Freeze' - one 
of Batman's supervillains whose power is based on ultra coldness, and he has 
a cool gun that can spray ice for hundreds of feet at anything (that gun 
never seems to run out of ammo, and they never explain how it's powered 
either). His secluded home is accidentally invaded by a submarine crew which 
also destroys the casing of his frozen wife, Nora, who suffers from a rare 
blood disorder. Freeze winds up in Gotham City and forces Dr. Gregory Belson 
(voiced by George Dzundza) into helping her. The doctor is a shady character 
with a serious credit problem and helps out Freeze because he is told he'll 
be rewarded soundly.</P>
<P>        The real problem ensues when it turns out that the only available 
match of the rare blood type and necessary organs is Barbara Gordon 
(Bergman), the daughter of James Gordon (voiced by Bob Hastings) - Gotham's 
Police Commissioner. Also for the Batman-uninformed, Barbara Gordon just 
happens to be Batgirl and the girlfriend of Dick Grayson (Lester) - a/k/a 
Robin.</P>
<P>        It's not too difficult to tell where this story's going to go and 
what the net result of mixing all the appropriate characters in such a 
convenient plot will be. Superhero stories rely on these kind of coincidences 
on top of coincidences both for story and for comedy, but neither of those is 
resulted here. Instead, it's just a lot of scenes of Mr. Freeze trying to 
capture Barbara Gordon, then Mr. Freeze arguing with the doctor, then Batman 
(Conroy) and Robin trying to locate Mr. Freeze's secret lair while Babs makes 
several unsuccessful escape attempts.</P>
<P>        The film has a very cyclical feeling. To say it's predictable is an 
understatement. And given the fact it's only a 67-minute-long movie doesn't 
help much either.</P>
<P>        There's just so much more room for expansion here. Why not delve into 
Mr. Freeze's history a little for those who aren't familiar? Maybe we could 
feel a little sympathy for him because he certainly does seem to be concerned 
about his wife who is nothing more than a popsicle the entire film. Why not 
play up the connection between Freeze and Dr. Belson a little more? Why would 
such a supposedly respectful doctor be such a goon? And why not actually 
stick to the title and show Batman [for more than just the ending]? The comic 
books and the cartoon program have gone to extreme lengths to show that 
Batman is not just a guy who punches out the bad guys, but that he's an 
extremely intelligent detective who more often than not relies on brain over 
brawn. To show him as only the typical superhero who goes against all the 
odds and performs the fantastic stunts is fine to placate to children, but I 
don't think children would be too excited watching him do his thing since the 
story is so thin and light. A climax after only 20-odd minutes of actually 
storytelling is quite boring.</P>
<P>        I hate to rag on `Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero,' because it's not 
meant to be taken very seriously, at least not by anyone over age 10. It just 
doesn't seem like something the people behind the show would come up with 
considering all the material they have to work with. They do succeed in one 
aspect by making the film absolutely beautiful to look at, but with such 
resources available at their disposal, why not at least make something worth 
watching more than once?</P>
