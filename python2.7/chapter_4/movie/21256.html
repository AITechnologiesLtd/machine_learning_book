<P>An older man once told me that once you get old, time seems to go by
much faster. You wouldn't think it from watching Richard
Farnsworth's character in `The Straight Story', but in one of
the film's smaller scenes, I realized something. His character,
Alvin Straight, has been driving on a lawnmower at a painfully slow
pace over about 500 miles. He asks a man for the date, and he realizes
it's been five weeks since he began his journey. That
inconsequential scene proves that life can move at a slow pace while
time speeds ahead. Sad, isn't it?</P>
<P>Sad is one way to describe this new film from David Lynch; odd is
another.  Compared to the films Lynch has done, there is little which
could seem odd. Except for a G-rated Walt Disney Picture,
perhaps. Like David Mamet did with `The Winslow Boy', Lynch (who
made `Blue Velvet', `The Elephant Man' and `Twin
Peaks') has ditched his unusual, edgy style for something more
refined but no less compelling.</P>
<P>But in `The Straight Story', Lynch takes a backseat to 79 year
old actor Richard Farnsworth.  Farnsworth, who has appeared in films
like `Misery' and `The Grey Fox', takes control of the
film in a subtle way that only the most gifted and experienced actors
can perfect. He has already garnered quite a bit of Oscar buzz.</P>
<P>Alvin Straight is in his seventies, and he yearns to be young
again. He lives in Laurens, Iowa with his stuttering daughter, Rose
(Sissy Spacek), and isn't in such great shape. The World War II vet
ignores health advice from his doctor, and has a diet composed
entirely of red meat.</P>
<P>One day, he learns that Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton), his estranged
brother, has just suffered a stroke.  He realizes that neither of them
have much time to live, and that they mst reconcile before they pass
on. He announces that he will be going to visit Lyle in
Wisconsin. Sounds reasonable enough...except for the fact that he has
decided to travel the 500 miles on his lawnmower.</P>
<P>Much to the delight of onlookers, Alvin begins his trek and meets a
handful of quirky characters along the way (among them; a lady who has
killed 15 deer on one highway).  Despite the G rating, `The
Straight Story' is a Lynch movie at every turn. The irony is,
depsite the quirkiness of these Lynchian characters, this film does
more justice to small town folk than any film this year.</P>
<P>`The Straight Story' is about a man who knows his time is almost
up, and about his final journey of freedom. `The worst part about
being old,' he says, `is thinking back to when you're
young.' Alvin Straight is trying to purify his soul.</P>
<P>While the film is pleasant and compelling enough, it's glacial pace
is often annoying. Some conversations seem to last a lifetime, and the
thin premise isn't enough to fill a 2 hour picture.  However, there
are some great shots of America's heartland, and it's a nice
slice of life that's suitable for the whole family. Kids may be
able to sit through it, but `The Straight Story' is adult in its
themes.</P>
<P>This isn't one of David Lynch's better films, but it has its own
simple pleasures. Personally, I'm not a fan of edgy directors
making G rated films, no matter what kind of violence is occuring in
today's society. If this is the way Lynch wants to make films,
that's fine, but I don't want filmmakers to feel pressured by
the ratings board to make films family-friendly. I'm such a fan of
Lynch's old stuff that I don't fell compelled to call `The
Straight Story' a refreshing change, but it is an intriguing piece
of work.</P>
<P>Richard Farnsworth is `The Straight Story', and deserves
recognition for his three dimensional work on Alvin
Straight. Farnsworth presents a character who sits back and chooses to
watch everything from freighters to bicycles speed by him. But he
doesn't care. Life moves slow, but time goes fast.</P>
