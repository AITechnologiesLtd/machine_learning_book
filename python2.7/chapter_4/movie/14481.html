<P>The information on this film quotes Susan Sontag addressing a Yale
University graduating class: "You may think you've just experienced the
most important phase of your life, but you're wrong. The most important
experience of your life was high school."</P>
<P>It this is true, it is very sad, assuming that high school in the U.S.A, as
seen on celluloid-- whether in Hollywood productions or, as in the case of
"Whatever," independent films-- is a time of no brains, no learning, and no
interest beyond physical gratification and self-absorption.</P>
<P>There has to be more to school than that, but it is not evident in this
first feature made by Susan Skoog, who was born in Red Bank, New Jersey,
graduated from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in 1987, and
has since had quite a bit of experience writing, directing and producing
for TV.</P>
<P>"Whatever" is set in some anonymous town or suburb in New Jersey, in the
early 1980s. The filming actually took place in Wheeling, West Virginia. In
a low-budget way, it has the look of the times as well as its pop music
(the Pretenders, Jam, the Ramones, Blondie, and so on), but it is not a
piece of nostalgia. Far from that, it is a sad, dolorous variant of
coming-of-age pictures, and feels, if not partly autobiographical, at least
like first-hand knowledge of its subject.</P>
<P>The subject is young people who are at loose ends and come from families
(mostly lower middle class) upon which the filmmaker casts a jaundiced eye.
The focus is on Anna, who says "I'm almost eighteen," which means 17. She's
presumably bright, rather quiet and reserved, not a good student but
interested in going to art school, specifically to New York City's Cooper
Union. Her one "friend" on the school's staff is Mr. Chaminski, the art
teacher. A former New Yorker whose past is none too clear, he may well be a
failure as a painter and one of those cases of "those who can't, teach." In
any case, he encourages Anna.</P>
<P>He is played by Frederic Forrest, the only familiar face in the crowd.
Forrest has been in several indifferent movies as well  in some major ones,
notably Coppola's The Conversation, Apocalypse Now, One From the Heart,
Tucker. He was also the lead in Wim Wenders's Hammett. The last time I saw
him was in a colorful role in Falling Down (1993). In "Whatever" his role
is undistinguished, yet, if you look closely, Forrest adds clever touches
as someone who semi-consciously lusts after Anna.</P>
<P>Anna actively chain-smokes, semi-actively rebels against school,
semi-passively attends backyard or al fresco booze-busts-cum-substance
abuse. These are your familiar affairs, complete with gross-outs (for $20
would you drink beer with spit in it?), with the class nerd who wears
glasses, with the fattish wallflower who is by herself, with raucous kids,
seniors who philosophize sophomorically, and other cliches. Mercifully, the
camera spends little time on those particular deja vu shots. It
concentrates on Anna, who is dazed and confused.</P>
<P>With AIDS unknown though incubating around the corner, libido runs high,
everyone is ready to copulate, many do. Not Anna. She is a virgin, Brenda
is certainly not. She's Anna's  slutty, overpainted, best friend Brenda. To
a physiognomist, Brenda looks common and unintelligent, while Anna looks
sensitive. To anybody, Brenda is  a tramp, while Anna suggests some hidden
depths. The pair is mismatched. What they do have in common is attitude and
dysfunctional families.</P>
<P>"Whatever" does not have a "real" story. It is built episodically on
tableaux and situations, realistic, grungy, but often vague too. The
observation can be graphic and sharp but the factual, social and
psychological backgrounds are fuzzy. The adults either are caricatures or
verge on them.</P>
<P>Anna lives with her young brother and a mother. Why is there no father? Why
does Ma drink, neglect her kids and the house, and date a succession of
creeps, the current one being the affluent idiot "Fat Howard"? Why is
Brenda defying her father? Or is he her father? (No, he is her stepfather
and much younger than his wife). Is the English teacher a joke, a
semi-joke, a sadist or what? Who are those people?  It gets a bit clearer
by the end, but some audience fatigue has preceded it.</P>
<P>In the meantime, Anna and Brenda have met two somewhat older guys that had
done time for dealing dope; Anna loses her virginity to her best boyfriend
Martin, who later proves unworthy; the two girls make a wide-eyed visit to
the Big Apple and end up on some silly yuppies bed and sofa; they return to
Jersey where Brenda is abused (beaten and most likely raped) by her
stepfather; a group retaliation against the abuser ensues and is possible
but improbable; a temporary escapade that has Anna returning home is both
sad and inconclusive; the final scenes put a smile on Anna's face and a
happy way of riding her bicycle, but  this new found upbeat "balance" is
neither explained, justified or convincing.</P>
<P>The film is  overlong long and often gratuitous. It relies essentially on
the portrait of Anna. In spite of holes and loose ends, first-timer Liza
Weil's role, well-played and well-directed, can and ought to move you. The
best aspects of the movie deal with her reactions.The quiet scene,
un-graphic, un-shocking, unsensational (there is no frontal nudity with
Anna, anywhere) of her losing her virginity is striking for its observation
and sensitivity. In distant ways it reminds me a bit of the couple's visit
to a small island in the river in the 1930s film by Jean Renoir,  Une
Partie de Campagne (A Day in the Country).</P>
