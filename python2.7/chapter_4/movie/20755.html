<PRE>Guinevere
Directed by:  Audrey Wells
Starring: Sarah Polley, Stephen Rea, Jean Smart, Gina Gershon
Running time:  104 minutes
My rating (5 star scale):  ****1/2</PRE>
<P>Harper is the younger daughter of a family of lawyers.  She is
about to head off to Harvard law school and is attending her
sister's wedding.  She meets the wedding photographer who is the
only person there, including her family, to pay any attention to 
her.  Although he is 30 years older than her, soon she is spending
time with him and secretly moves in with him, after telling her parents
she didn't get into Harvard after all.</P>
<P>Connie, the photographer, insists she learn to do something 
artistic and decides to teach her how to take photos.  Harper soon
learns that she is not the first young woman Connie has educated
in this fashion.  And she doesn't seem to mind.  But this is the
kind of relationship doomed to failure and how it fails is what 
interests us.  As Harper says, if you learn from your mistakes,
this was a great learning experience.</P>
<P>Polley is brilliant in this role, playing a naive girl who grows 
into a self-confident woman.  Rea does a great job as the fragile
older man who seduces younger woman not merely for the obvious
physical reasons but for much deeper psychological purposes.  And
Jean Smart gives a staggering performance as Harper's mother, who
can't really do anything to stop her but who knows exactly what is
happening and why.  Her confrontation with Connie is the highlight
of the film.</P>
<P>This is a movie packed with strong character development and 
great scenes.  Funny scenes like the fortune cookie reading at
Harper's birthday dinner at her home, to tragic scenes like
the final parting between Harper and Connie.  Unfortunately, some
of the minor roles (Gina Gershon as an exlover of Connie's) are
rather weak.  And it seems unlikely that Harper would be so 
artistically talented. But this is compensated for by the 
insights into Harper's family, who bring new levels of meaning
to the word dysfunctional, and into Connie's psychology.</P>
<P>The age difference between Harper and Connie has you seeing Connie
as a dirty old man.  And he is.  But by the time the movie ends,
you've come to forgive him his seductions and realize he is as
much a victim as anyone.  The young women he seduces will leave him
and go on to greater things.  But he is stuck with who and what he
is.</P>
<P>This is not as great a film as Polley's previous film The Sweet
Hereafter.
But it does give her an opportunity to stretch further as an 
actress and to play a complex and interesting character.  I'm 
really looking forward to what she does next and even if you're 
not a fan, you should see this film.</P>
