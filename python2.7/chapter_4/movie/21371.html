<PRE>                               Dogma 95
                      Comments by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>     What is Dogma 95?</PRE>
<P>     My review of the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT made reference to the fact
that it was very nearly a Dogma 95 film, probably without even trying.
In the September 13 NEW YORKER David Denby makes the same observation.
In the most recent episode of Roger Ebert's review program on TV he
said that JULIEN DONKEY-BOY is a Dogma 95 film.  Now a correspondent
has asked me to explain my take on Dogma 95.  Well, I cannot claim to
be an expert, but here goes.</P>
<P>     Back in the 1960s an issue of MAD MAGAZINE talked about audiences
who went to see foreign films.  Their illustration was an audience
watching a film and the image on the screen was of water with one arm,
limp at the wrist rising above the surface.  In other words they were
watching something depressing.  Even then there was the idea that
European art films were serious, depressing, nihilistic affairs and
American films were somehow lighter.  There was probably some truth to
this.  Most were not as glum as the MAD image would indicate though
maybe Andrzej Wadja's KANAL, which takes place mostly in a sewer, might
be a candidate.  Roberto Rosellini's OPEN CITY is very downbeat also.
It is an anti-Nazi film shot secretly in Rome while it was still
occupied by Nazis.  (I picture Rosellini setting up on the street like
we see the title character do in ED WOOD.  But when he yells "run" his
film crew really had something worth running from.)  American films of
the post-war era like John Wayne westerns were generally lighter fare.</P>
<P>     Flash forward to the 1990s and there is still the division.  We
now have computer techniques to create visuals that are spectacular.
Films have never looked better.  On the other hand, there are very few
films of much substance.  The American film industry is catering in
large degree to the public who spends the most money on films.  That is
people from age 15 to 25.  That audience tends not to like a lot of
deep thought in their films.  So the formula is to aim films at that
range, make them dumb if necessary but very visual, and if the film is
not theatrically marketable, it can go direct to cable or cassette.
There are not many films of any substance being made these days by the
major American studios.  It is too easy to make a nice looking film
without much substance that will appeal to the affluent but not well
discerning audiences.  Compounding the problem is that good filmmakers
like Paul Verhoeven make substantial films in their own country, then
get seduced by the big budgets of the American film industry and never
make a film of real substance again.  A set of European filmmakers have
said that they are not going to make artificial special effects driven
films, they are going to make films in what appears to be the tradition
of Roberto Rosellini.  They will follow a list of ten rules drafted by
Danish filmmaker Lars von Triers:</P>
<P>     I swear to submit to the following set of rules drawn up and
confirmed by DOGMA 95:</P>
<P>     1. Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be
brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location
must be chosen where this prop is to be found).</P>
<P>     2. The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice
versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is
being shot).</P>
<P>     3. The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility
attainable in the hand is permitted. (The film must not take place
where the camera is standing; shooting must take place where the film
takes place).</P>
<P>     4. The film must be in color. Special lighting is not acceptable.
(If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a
single lamp be attached to the camera).</P>
<PRE>     5. Optical work and filters are forbidden.</PRE>
<P>     6. The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders,
weapons, etc. must not occur.)</P>
<P>     7. Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to
say that the film takes place here and now.)</P>
<PRE>     8. Genre movies are not acceptable.</PRE>
<PRE>     9. The film format must be Academy 35 mm.</PRE>
<PRE>     10. The director must not be credited.</PRE>
<P>     Films that already have been made following these conventions
include BREAKING THE WAVES and THE CELEBRATION.  Obviously the mystical
number ten was important in the rules since even von Triers himself has
never followed his own tenth rule.  (Or perhaps is it just not that we
know of.)  THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, by chance, or perhaps inspired by
the same concerns followed Rules 1 to 7.  And that film's appeal is the
immediacy of its action which is certainly one of the goals of Dogma
95.</P>
<P>     The Dogma 95 directors are in a sense the puritans of the
international film industry.  This is not in the sense that they eschew
sex and naughty words in their films, but they have reacted to what
they see as excesses in the film industry by creating their own strict
set of rules to live by apart from the mainstream.  They want a more
natural, less gimmicky and not by chance a less expensive mode of
filmmaking.  It itself is a gimmick and I am sure even the Dogma 95
filmmakers admire a great many films that break many of their rules.</P>
<P>     Is Dogma 95 in itself a good idea?  One might as well ask if
Cubism is a good idea.  It is a movement that will appeal to some and
not to others.  Most people I talk to do not like Dogma 95 films.  A
common objection is the use of the hand-held camera.  This is not a
device that a filmmaker like Rosellini used because it was not around
in his time.  But he undoubtedly would have appreciated the naturalism
of filming with a box you hold in your hands.  The over-use of hand-
held cameras does lead to motion sickness in some viewers.</P>
<P>     One thing certain is that Dogma 95 strips away from film a lot of
the folderol that distracts from the theme and essence of a film.  Like
other forms of Puritanism it clearly is intended to elevate substance
over style, which is probably a good thing.  And it is not a movement
that is going away after one or two films.  I think it will be with us
for a while at least.</P>
