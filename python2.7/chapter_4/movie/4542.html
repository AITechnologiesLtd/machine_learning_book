<P>     ANTONIA'S LINE, director Marleen Gorris' fourth feature film, won 
the Most Popular Film Award at 1995's Toronto Film Festival, and it's 
not hard to understand why.  This small Dutch film is a heady, life-
affirming mixture of drama, comedy, romance, tragedy, philosophy, and 
art.  In an era when the concept of "the family" is being eroded, Gorris 
underlines the importance of community.  And, by confronting death from 
the atheist's point-of-view, she shows that even though we all have only 
"one dance to dance", death is in one sense a new beginning, as the 
grave transforms corpses into fresh nutrients for the soil.</P>
<P>     Opening shortly after the end of World War II and continuing for 
over forty years, ANTONIA'S LINE introduces us to four generations of 
women -- Antonia (Willeke Van Ammelrooy), her daughter Danielle (Jan 
Decleir), her granddaughter Therese (Els Dottermans), and her great-
granddaughter Sarah (Thyrza Ravesteijn).  The film begins in the post-
war Netherlands with Antonia returning to the village of her birth.  In 
her company is her young daughter, whose initial impression of the town 
is that it's an unpromising place.  Antonia, who left twenty years ago, 
has come back to bury her mother and take over running her inherited 
farm.</P>
<P>     The movie progresses by highlighting various episodes in the lives 
of the characters.  Aside from Antonia's family, we're introduced to 
many of the town's other residents:  Farmer Bas, who carries a torch for 
Antonia; Crooked Finger, a student of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche; 
retarded Deedee, who is raped by her own brother; Mad Madonna, who bays 
at the full moon; a man known only as "the Protestant", who desperately 
loves his howling neighbor; and many others.  Together, these misfits 
and outcasts form Antonia's tight-knit community -- those friends and 
neighbors who are always ready to support one of their own, regardless 
of the circumstances.</P>
<P>     Gorris imbues each of her characters with a sense of uniqueness, 
and we come to care about them, whether they're around for the entire 
film or just a small portion of it.  The story flows smoothly from event 
to event, balancing such disparate elements as madcap humor (Danielle's 
vision of her grandmother rising from a coffin and breaking into a 
chorus of "My Blue Heaven") and shocking violence (two rapes).  The only 
obvious flaw in the structure of ANTONIA'S LINE is its over-reliance 
upon a voiceover narrative; there are times when the plot is too easily 
advanced by telling instead of showing.</P>
<P>     ANTONIA'S LINE is a thematically rich motion picture, with a visual 
style similar to that of Dennis Potter's work (PENNIES FROM HEAVEN, THE 
SINGING DETECTIVE).  In addition to the evident message about the 
importance of community, the film challenges different philosophies 
about death, from those of Schopenhauer to those of the Catholic church.  
It condemns the hypocrisies of organized religion while endorsing the 
concept of "church" as a gathering place.  It celebrates painting, math, 
music, and all forms of creative expression.  And it gently advances the 
director's feminist agenda, illustrating that women can thrive (not just 
survive) without men.  Antonia doesn't want a husband and Danielle's 
lover is a lesbian.</P>
<P>     The final lines of ANTONIA'S LINE are:  "And, as this long 
chronicle draws to a conclusion, nothing has ended."  Such is often the 
case for life stories brought to the screen with heartfelt realism.  
Aided by a fine cast giving unaffected performances, Gorris has 
fashioned a rare and wonderful world capable of provoking both laughter 
and tears -- sometimes at the same time.  </P>
