<P>One of the best moments of the '98-'99 season of "The Simpsons" came when 
young Lisa visited the video section of a superstore and paused in front 
of a TV set showing the DVD version of "The Postman." The commentary 
track for the epic dud featured star and director Kevin Costner 
apologizing to viewers for the film. Upon closer examination, Lisa 
discovered it wasn't really a commentary track at all; Costner himself 
was standing behind the television set, personally telling each passerby 
how very, very sorry he was for foisting such a disaster on the public.   </P>
<P>Hopefully, "Waterworld" and "The Postman" have taught Kevin Costner that 
he is far better playing likable, flawed regular guys in down-to-earth 
settings than disaffected loners in post-apocalyptic societies. But then 
again, isn't that true for most of us?  </P>
<P>In "For Love of the Game," Costner revisits the world of baseball which 
has served his career so well. "Bull Durham" explored the nuts and bolts 
of life on the minor league circuit, while focusing on a raucous romantic 
triangle between Costner, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon. "Field of 
Dreams" waxed poetic on the majesty and mystical beauty of the sport, 
taking a moving look at the nature of regret along the way. While not 
nearly as strong as either film, "For Love of the Game" is still one of 
Costner's best recent efforts.    </P>
<P>The production opens with a nice title montage of photos and home movies 
depicting young Billy Chapel (Costner) learning the rudiments of the game 
from his dad, playing Little League ball and eventually becoming a 
superstar pitcher with the Detroit Tigers (the images are from Costner's 
own childhood and the older couple seen in the stands later in the film 
are his real-life parents). </P>
<P>We join the adult Chapel in the autumn of his career, on a particularly 
momentous day. The aging vet has just learned that his team is about to 
be sold and part of the deal includes his being traded to San Francisco. 
As if that wasn't enough, Billy's girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) is 
leaving him. "You don't need me," she says, hours before her scheduled 
departure for London. "You and the ball and the diamond - - you're 
perfect." Dejected and hung over, Chapel heads for the ballpark to pitch 
what might very well be the last game of his career. While memories of 
his rocky five-year relationship with Jane flash through his head, Billy 
focuses totally on throwing as hard and true as possible, blanking out 
everything from the jeering Yankee fans to the scoreboard itself. </P>
<P>And so goes the 137 minute feature, jumping from the game to numerous 
flashbacks of Billy and Jane. Director and baseball enthusiast Sam Raimi 
("A Simple Plan") is at his best during the game sequences. He presents 
major-league play from a first-person perspective with great 
verisimilitude, with Chapel verbally sizing up each opponent before 
firing fast balls and curves through the air like bullets. The images are 
searing and, even though the outcome of the game is easy to anticipate, 
Raimi establishes and maintains a sense of tension that is totally 
engrossing. </P>
<P>The only problem with the game segments comes from the inclusion of 
overly obvious remarks from play-by-play announcers Vin Scully and Steve 
Lyons like "He's not just pitching a game. He's pitching against time. 
He's pitching against age." Thanks, fellas. We would never have figured 
that out on our own.</P>
<P>The many romantic flashbacks are less dynamic, but achieve their goal of 
depicting a couple who have trouble with trust and commitment. Baseball 
is everything for Billy and, though he cares deeply for Jane, he cannot 
take his eyes off the ball long enough to give their relationship the 
attention it requires. As for Jane, after building a successful career 
and raising a daughter on her own, she is wary of becoming the "other 
woman" in Billy's love affair with the game. Costner and Preston are 
effective in their roles, but because the two characters are so tentative 
in the area of romance, their interactions lack electricity. Both actors 
display more chemistry with Jane's teenage daughter Heather, nicely 
played by Jena Malone. </P>
<P>Even though the less-than-sizzling romance hits most of the clichés of 
the genre (including two scenes that appear simply as excuses for MTV pop 
song moments), Costner and Preston succeed in rising above the sometimes-
tired dialogue. John C. Reilly also provides strong support as Chapel's 
catcher and best friend (At one point, Billy teases his overprotective 
pal by referring to him as "the ugliest wife in the league").</P>
<P>Though uneven and occasionally sluggish, "For Love of the Game" is a 
surprisingly satisfying hybrid of an old-fashioned sports film and a 
contemporary date movie. It's nice to see a story with the message that, 
regardless of age, we all still have the capacity for greatness and 
growth. While the film is the least of Kevin Costner's baseball trilogy, 
he has nothing to apologize for this time around.</P>
