<PRE>                           CASINO ROYALE (1967)
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>CASINO ROYALE (1967) **</PRE>
<P>        This is a royale mess. Supposedly parodying the James Bond 
films of the 60's, this turns into a confusing, bland, rarely funny movie 
that's even more episodic and cliched than the movies it parodies. The 
only redeeming feature is the assemblage of talent. David Niven plays 
Bond, old and retired, who is drawn back as head of the British secret 
service after M's murder. Ursula Andress, who co-starred in the real 
Bond movie DR. NO, plays the traditional Bond girl, with PINK 
PANTHER star Peter Sellers as the traditional Bond. Also starring are 
villains Woody Allen (as the sex-obsessed, neurotic Dr. Noah) and 
card-shark Orson "Macbeth" Welles, who contribute the only truly 
memorable performances in the movie.</P>
<P>        CASINO ROYALE is for the most part indecipherable. 
Niven, at the beginning, is staying with M's widow and her eleven 
beautiful daughters, all between the ages of sixteen and nineteen 
(coincidentally, this has always been my idea of what heaven will be 
like). The ladies all put the moves on Bond, who has gained some 
morals since retiring, in an attempt to corrupt him. (Why this is 
relevant to the plot is beyond me.) Bond gets out of that jam after 
about thirty minutes and heads to headquarters, where he finds Miss 
Moneypenny's beautiful daughter has taken her place and seems to 
have the same intentions her mother did. Bond displaces her and gets 
down to business.</P>
<P>        The plan here is to confuse the enemy by making every agent 
007, James Bond, including the ladies. The main Bond is an author-
turned-spy who is recruited to play poker against Welles. There's also 
some harem girl who's the daughter of Bond and Mata Hari, and a few 
other identical beauties to confuse viewers. Sure, the James Bond 
series is ripe for parody, with the far-fetched action and sexist views, 
but CASINO ROYALE doesn't follow the formula at all. It goes in 
another direction without ever actually being a parody. It has some of 
the same Bond characters, but they're nothing like their actual 
counterparts. It's a slow-mover with a bland climax. You could say it 
has a license to suck.</P>
