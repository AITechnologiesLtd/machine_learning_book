<P>(Seen at the 22nd Portland International Film Festival in Portland, Oregon)</P>
<P> Several years ago, another film maker came around, and went to work doing
things that no one else did, in a manner that no one else did, with little
regard for how we felt, or how we would react to the picture that he had
made. He became the darling of sur-neo-realism, if there is such a thing, in
that his films were always strange, obscure, but always managed to make a
point by the way things appeared in the film. Not at all because he wanted
to create a philosophy, or a thinking, about anything he did. But his
intuitive side of things, created a harrowing reality for movie go'ers. How
is one supposed to feel about these things?</P>
<P> No sooner had the director heard us discussing his stuff and us believing
he was making a film because ... , he concluded that he didn't want "...to
make a film about politics. He just wanted to make a political film...",
where the situations and people took on themselves, be them actors or not.
Not a story, not a foolish Hollywood fantasy, but something that might get a
solid reaction out of us. In other words, he DID NOT make film to tell us
how he felt, or how we are supposed to feel. To this day, I believe that
this film really helped define something in film the world over, that few of
us may really understand. This may be the same mentality that gave us the
Reign of Terror, but 30 years later, what has it arrived to? The same, and
more. The film maker was Jean-Luc Godard. This film delivers a Reign of
Terror, but one that we may not wish to deal with.</P>
<P> I would imagine that for anyone unfamiliar with these kinds of things, a
film like this is a massive shocker. This film never stops at the words, or
just a symbol or an idea. It plunges right ahead, in front of us, and
brutally so. It's hard to fathom that anyone would be this bitter, or
disappointed in life, to create such a film, and such an experience for any
audience to sit through. But it will get your attention if you can sit
through it.</P>
<P> In the fifties, it took the acting of those now known as giants in the
Acting Studio, and the English Angry Young Men to express the displeasure
that many of us have in the society we live in. In the sixties, it seemed
that drugs and music were the channels for the same thing, of which Godard
also took part, although differently so. The seventies and eighties were
sedate by comparison. Then in the nineties, one sees something like this and
it makes one wonder, if things in France are in such a stupor and such an
edge, that another revolution may be in the offing. A film like this, is a
vicious attack on the social mold that has pretty much destroyed the worker,
or at least this man. It's hard to imagine that this is just a "film", and
that its power stops at "film". How real is all this? How close to reality
is it really? How much of this is the man's imagination? One can hear
psychologists blaming the man's problems on his inability to blah, blah,
blah. And society as a whole can not be at fault. Or one can hear film
critics attacking these things as not films, or the favorite American word
(heaven forbid) - Entertainment.</P>
<P> The story is simple enough, as if there were any need for a story to be
there at all when one thinks about it. A man that had grown up being a
butcher, all of a sudden finds himself out of work, and not in favor with
anyone. He has just finished serving jail time for an incident, when he
thought that a man had raped his daughter, when in fact it had been her time
of the month. His return from jail to society, was not favorable. He takes
on a mistress, and one day leaves her and her mother, after making an awful
mess of things. As his anger builds, he finds the need in himself to go
visit his daughter and perhaps reclaim her from the institution that she is
in. And the film kinda stops here, though the man's mind doesn't.</P>
<P> And here is the astounding part of this film, the most difficult thing to
deal with as it is totally uncensored in any way, shape or form -- a film
that would get a guaranteed X rating in this country if it went beyond the
portals of Film Festivals. It's a wonder that it got that far unnoticed,
that's for sure. Right from the start, we are treated to the man's story and
his opinions. The question is where is his temper and mind going to take
him. The inevitable suggestion, is that he is strong and capable of doing
something horrible, and the film seems to make it clear that he does just
that with his mistress, but in the end, it gives us the total opposite.
Maybe he did not do what the film showed he did to the mistress since he
could just as easily have done a similar thing here to his daughter.</P>
<P> So, in the end, all we can think is that most of it has taken place in his
mind, or at least we hope so, because it is hard to believe that he could
not control himself well enough to learn the harsh lessons that life has to
offer ... well, I imagine that we in the audience want to think so, because
seeing something that brutal usually merits very stiff penalties in the
societies that we live in. He is visibly angry, but it is not like he does
not remember the silly affair that got him in jail. Or that he would be
stupid enough to follow through on his murderous vision and mind.</P>
<P> Few films, ever, are so powerful, and do not stop pulling their punches for
a minute, so the audience can take a deep breath. It is difficult to think
of this film as bad, since the design and concept is well thought out, and
extremelly well done. It may not be our favorite theme, or film, but it is
very hard to dismiss its obvious points. Most films can only give "opinions"
by comparison. This one punches your gut with it with its realism.</P>
<P> This is one of those films that is best seen by those that have a stomach
for harsh stuff. This film is harsh and then some. Sort of like the day we
saw Sam Peckinpah do the killing spree in slow motion, so we could witness
the mass orgy of madness that we take ourselves into - that we refuse to
learn, or accept and continually repeat in so many countries the world over.
Our love affair with hate, and destruction. Or our belief that something is
more important than another, to the point where human life is secondary to
the cause. And maybe this is the point that Gaspar Noe wants to make, which
the character mentions. We have become too weak and have no courage to do
something about it as a country anymore. We have resigned, and are left with
nothing but an act of animalistic desire that allows us to cleanse ourselves
for a small period of time. But with all due respect, to this point of view,
could this be a sign of the serious dis-satisfaction with the way things are
shaping up in France? Or in many parts of the world, hidden by toys that we
think make us happier?</P>
<P>Very powerful film that is not for the weak stomach. Very brutal, mentally
and physically so. A film that really could be said speaks for our angers
much more than we care to admit.</P>
