<P>   Like "Touch of Evil," "L.A. Confidental" is a noir film pitting a
corrupt cop against an honest policeman who rises above the
muck.  Both have bleak world views, are richly detailed, and
are on the long side in running time.  Both feature Oscar-
worthy stars.  But if you liked Curtis Hanson's 1997
blockbuster, you will not necessarily go for Orson Welles's
1958 work, "Touch of Evil."  The Welles picture is re-released
at this time in a newly edited version, one in which production
editor Rick Schmidlin takes into account a 58-page set of
notes dashed off by its famed director to improve the final cut,
while Walter Murch does the actual polishing.  Looking at the
black-and-white detective story in today's eyes, you may well
find it too stagey (as I did), with a hackneyed, contrived
ending.  As such, "Touch of Evil" may be of value principally
to film scholars and buffs, fans of Welles who feel the great
man can do no wrong, and young people interested in seeing
what the Welles fuss is all about.  </P>
<P>   The story itself is nothing much, and we can see why
Universal-International, the studio which owned the film, felt it
would be accepted as a B-movie, and why American critics
were largely luke-warm about the production.  The narrative
opens with a bang, as a mysterious man photographed from
a distance places dynamite in the trunk of a large car on the
California side of the Mexican border.  Moments later, a guy
with his stripper girl friend hops in, and ust as he drives
across the frontier his car explodes.  By luck, Mike Vargas
(Charlton Heston), an honest Mexican narco who has just
walked over to the Mexican side with his new American bride
Susan (Janet Leigh), interrupts his honeymoon to investigate
the crime.  (Since Vargas had for a while been harassing a
drug dealer, Grandis, the Grandis clan are seeking revenge,
which they get by later kidnapping Vargas's new wife.)  But
Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles), an outrageously fat American
police chief, takes over the case determined to find the perp
even if a closing of the case requires that he frame some
seedy Mexican.    We have no idea how an American cop is
able to go beyond his jurisdiction and terrorize Mexicans into
confessing to a crime which has taken place on Mexican
territory, but simply must accept this flaw for the sake of the
tale.  </P>
<P>   "Touch of Evil" is in no way another "Citizen Kane," Orson
Welles' 1941 movie which some consider the greatest film of
all time.  This re-edited version conforms more to the
director's wishes than the original 1958 release.  For example,
the opening explosion is no longer marred by a show of the
film's credits and the sound track is replete with the tinny
sounds that Welles favored.  It's still a B-movie, though re-
released at a time in which our $8 no longer brings us a B-
movie as a double-feature.  The ado is based rather on some
thematic challenges which Welles devised for the 1958 screen
and for the inventive photography implemented at a time in
which special effects were still in a neolithic stage.</P>
<P>   Thematically, Welles dabbled with ideas considered daring
for its time.  The romantic couple are interracial, the blond,
sassy, all-American Susan taking her honeymoon with the
upright Mexican, Vargas.  The American cop is the
unscrupulous one; the Mexican, the ethical model.  Sexual
references are highlighted, as Vargas and Susan kiss
passionately from time to time only to have the consummation
of their marriage delayed by events which overtake them. 
Even here, the couple show signs of conflict in the midst of
their honeymoon, with Susan protesting her husband's choice
of venue and insisting on leaving the area, without him if
necessary.  The kidnap scene hints at a gang bang, as
smarmy members of the Mexican underworld, who have just
kidnapped Susan and shut her into a motel in the middle of
nowhere, approach her menacingly.  The film also has
engaging, even campy, portrays by actors like cigar-chomping
Marlene Dietrich who had once loved Quinlan and Dennis
Weaver as a nervous, seemingly retarded night man in the
desolate motel.  </P>
<P>  Cinematically, Welles dabbles in imagery with which he first
experimented in "Citizen Kane." Though this time around he
does not use the spinning tabloid-like replicas across the
screen as he did in 1941, his images are dark and disturbing,
an outward representation of the inner world of the dissolute
American cop.  Particularly murky are the canal waters which
appear in the film's climactic scene, actually filmed in Venice,
California--which substitutes for the seedy Mexican border
town.  The shot considered a technical master stroke does
not look like much today: while Quinlan third-degrees the
suspect in the latter's home, the single camera follows the two
on a crab dolly from room to room, the imagery captured in a
single set of frames.  Welles also putters with the cross-
cutting of scenes, displayed more readily in this re-edited
version, with activities of different locales photographed so
that the actions seem simultaneous.  The film also uses
sustained washes of sound rather than an operatic scoring,
the latter being the traditional choice of directors of such
stories.  Most of all, Welles has himself photographed from
low-angle shots, his already corpulent body made even
stockier by padding, his features becoming steadily more
repugnant as he descends deeper into his own mental
deterioration.</P>
<P>   All in all, though, the movie shows a simplistic conflict of
good vs. evil and even in its own time, its distribution was
scant and unprofitable.  "Touch of Evil" is still a B-movie.</P>
<PRE>Not Rated.  Running time: 115 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
