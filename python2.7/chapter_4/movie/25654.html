<PRE>Nutty Professor II: The Klumps </PRE>
<P>Eddie Murphy is back as that fat scientist Prof. Sherman Klump who's trying 
to exorcise the remains of his
alter-ego Buddy Love. And since he's a nutty professor he concocts a formula 
that kind of acts as a Buddy
Love enema (eww), but somehow ends up bring Love to life as an entirely 
separate person. There's also a
plot about Love's attempt to steal Klump's latest gene-bending formula but 
that's something of a minor
issue with this film. </P>
<P>As the title states, this movie is about the Klump family and Murphy plays 
all of them with total
commitment and hilarity ensues. Oh, it's not the smartest script in the world 
but I do have to admit it's got
great characterization. I won't elaborate any further here, since there's 
about six different characters who
are all integral to the story and everything. This movie's a pure summer 
comedy and that's certainly what
we get. </P>
<P>If you've seen the commercials and previews that have been in very heavy 
rotation for months and
months now you know this is really envelope-pushing comedy (at least of a 
PG-13 movie). Does it work?
For the most part yes. There isn't a lot of really graphic, raunchy stuff to 
speak of, most of it is implied
and/or exaggerated to the point of being cartoony and silly. It sometimes 
makes you wince but you're still
laughing. And it's all brought together by a fairly good story not meant to 
be taken all that seriously.
Believe me it could've have been much worse (i.e. the first movie). </P>
