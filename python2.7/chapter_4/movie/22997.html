<PRE>All's Affair in War and Sex
End of the Affair</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Oozing like a maple tree with schmaltz, you'll have to peer over the
grizzlies in the front row lapping it up off their paws. If the director was
going for a look/touch/feel recreation of a movie made during the period
portrayed in this film (1940's) - then he got it. Save for the sex scenes,
which rival even the fleshiest of modern day films. (Perhaps, he made the
exception for Julianne Moore?)</P>
<P>Very watchable, although there isn't much more than an affair film here -
okay, a little bit more. The relationship between the lover and hired
private eye is actually quite sweet. And the ending is touched off nicely
with a truly welcomed surprise to an otherwise predicable piece.</P>
