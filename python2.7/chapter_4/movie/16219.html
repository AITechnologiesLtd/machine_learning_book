<P>Terrence Malik's 'The Thin Red Line' is a diatribe against war, an 
anti-violence tone poem that highlights the senselessness and insanity 
that occurs when humans insist on fighting.  It is also a very uneven 
film.</P>
<P>Malik's screenplay begins with two GIs walking about a scant village of 
native islanders, with whom they seem to be familiar.  The friendliness 
of Pvt. Witt (James Caviezel) is obvious in the easy way he relates to a 
woman caring for her child.  After an American patrol boat passes, we 
learn that Witt and his friend have been AWOL, actually taking a break 
from the war and living with the villagers.  Instantly we are forced to 
note the contrast between the lush  rainforest, beaches leading down to 
sparkling water, and the troop ship on which Witt is held prisoner by 
his own army.  Sgt. Edward Welch (Sean Penn) takes a sort of 
philosophical pity on Witt, however, and instead of being 
court-martialed, the young man is sent to a disciplinary unit where he 
helps care for the wounded.  It is here that Witt commences his role as 
Christ figure, a gentle soul sent along to teach others by kind acts and 
examples.  Ironic for a soldier, especially when Witt talks his way back 
into "C" Company, which is run by Welsh and captained by James Staros 
(Elias Koteas). </P>
<P>The film follows this company throughout their campaign to take an 
important hill on the Pacific island of Guadalcanal in the Second World 
War.  As much as it can be categorized, the plot consists of these men's 
exploits, triumphs and deaths in their attempts to capture this 
strategic strip of land from the occupying Japanese forces.  </P>
<P>The history surrounding the battles around the Solomon Islands is 
non-existent; perhaps Malik can justify the paucity of military planning 
in the name of character development or even in the service of 
portraying war in its allegorical sense. But it would have been nice to 
see more than one soldier with a clipboard, and more than two scenes 
showing where these weary warriors slept or mended or spend their off 
hours.  Anyhow, Malik is not after portraying what happened throughout 
the entire offensive on Guadalcanal and Tulagi between August, 1942 and 
February, 1943.  As I stated before, his intention seems to be showing 
the grisly reality of modern combat, focusing on the devastation wreaked 
upon individual men.</P>
<P>A fascinating element employed by Malik is the voice-over monologues.  
First we hear Witt talking about the natives, followed by other 
characters ruminating on what's happening to their lives.  Images 
interrupt their voices, a wife swinging or a child in a field - remnants 
of real-world memories many of the men carry with them in the same way 
they carry lockets with photographs.  These sudden, almost 
expressionistic sequences serve to show the source of meaning in these 
men's lives; they add a sense of home and comfort in the chaos of battle 
and the mortal boredom of waiting to attack.  Because they are risky 
narrative devices, these mental flashbacks are to be admired.  It's when 
they go on too long that they threaten the success of the film.</P>
<P>A very strong aspect is the battle scenes.  Starting with the LCIs 
racing toward shore, their engines rumbling above the spirited shouts of 
the troops, Malik depicts energy and action very well.  The assault by 
Charlie Company on the hill will rank with the best and most realistic 
of filmed combat.  It contains so many dimensions of the human condition 
- courage and cowardice, ethical dilemmas and accidents, terror and 
egotism - that a review cannot do justice to its accomplishment.  Malik 
has choreographed truly realistic and horrifying work here.</P>
<P>A lot has been said about Malik's striking camera work, and it's clear 
why.  The settings are beautifully shot, from the hills covered with 
high grass to the green glassiness of the sea.  When Malik juxtaposes 
the war atop these images from Eden, we get a quick idea of the 
destructiveness of humankind.  Just over the ridge of five-foot grass, 
or across the clearing in the bamboo forest, there lurks a painful 
death.  One is reminded again that World War II is often glorified, its 
purpose just.  But directors like Malik and Steven Spielberg show us 
scenes just as hellish as anything set during other wars.  Occasionally, 
though, the individual daydream sequences last too long, seeming to lack 
direction and sometimes coherence.</P>
<P>'The Thin Red Line' is well acted.  If you are like me and do not care 
for Sean Penn, perhaps because of the reputation formed in his younger 
years, you will probably change your mind.  I saw him just recently in 
'Dead Man Walking', and was impressed by his complete assumption of the 
character.  His Sgt. Welsh is sculpted just as carefully, with searing 
stares and wrinkled, compassionate brow.  Nick Nolte, as Lt. Colonel 
Gordon Tall, hands in the other outstanding performance.  From the time 
we first see him licking the boots of his one-star general (John 
Travolta) to the time he inadvertently reveals his megalomania, Nolte 
flashes the subtle expressions, mannerisms and intonations owned by the 
very best actors.</P>
<P> Several actors distinguish themselves in supporting roles.  John Cusack 
is so good that he seems underused.  Woody Harrelson sketches a mean but 
heroic Sgt. Keck in his brief role.  As Captain Staros, Elias Koteas 
assumes a gutsy, fatherly authority:  he's a lawyer turned trained 
killer, a reluctant leader with the backbone to stand up to the rants 
and ordered suicides of Col Tall.  In their cameo appearances, John 
Travolta and George Clooney struck me as so much fluff.  Like a couple 
of the precious dream shots, they call too much attention to themselves.  
I like them as actors, but why hire leading men for jobs character 
actors can do better?</P>
<P>It's a fair judgment that the 170-minute running time helps to cause the 
saggy narrative structure, particularly at the end.  Malik goes 
over-the-top with his poetic disgust, but his grasp for greatness puts 
within our reach a far better film than one made by a safer director 
with less vision.  I would recommend seeing this lush and memorable 
piece on the big screen if you can;  otherwise, wait until its premiere 
on commercial television.</P>
