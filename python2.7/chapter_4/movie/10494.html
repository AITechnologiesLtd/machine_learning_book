<PRE>Analysis and review of:
MORTAL KOMBAT: ANNIHILATION (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>Copyright 1998 Afterburner</PRE>
<P>Rating (out of 10):  2 (or 5).  See review for further details.</P>
<PRE>-----</PRE>
<P>        A movie like MORTAL KOMBAT: ANNIHILATION works (and must be
reviewed on) multiple levels.  First, there's the rampant usage of
Randian subtext that pervades the entire movie.  But occasionaly,
almost as if making an ironic, self-depreciating remark, the movie
tosses in clearly Marxist imagery.</P>
<PRE>        No no...  Just kidding.  Had you going there for a moment,
didn't I?</PRE>
<P>        In all seriousness however, and to be fair to the movie, it
*is* necessary to provide two viewpoints: that of a movie watcher
unfamiliar (or only marginally familiar) with the whole Mortal Kombat
phenomenon, and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the
games.</P>
<P>        The first movie (MORTAL KOMBAT (1995)) concerned itself with a
martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of Earth (and it's
5 billion inhabitants).  The mortals won, and in theory this should
have prevented the Emperor Shao Khan from taking over the Earth.
Unfortunately, Shao Khan was a poor loser, and the very final scene in
MORTAL KOMBAT showed him arriving anyway, ready to take over the
planet, as our heroes assumed a fighting stance.</P>
<P>        The first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those
(like myself) who are fans of the game.  I'd even go so far as to say
that many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the
movie.  The writers and directors knew the limitations of both their
cast and of the basic story itself, and they didn't try to
overachieve.  There were a lot of really cool fight scenes (with
really cool accompanying music), intersperesed with some distracting
(but ultimately non-intrusive) bits of fluff passing itself off as a
plot.  And, as we know, the movie was a smashing success at the box
office.</P>
<P>        MORTAL KOMBAT: ANNIHILATION picks up precisely where that
movie left off, with some introductory exposition to clue in those who
may not have seen the first movie.  Shao Khan has decided that he's
going to take over the Earth *anyways*, and to Hell with some silly
rule about mortals winning the tournament.  Thereafter follows
approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being
confused, being trite, being silly, and being just plain stupid.  One
gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought
"Hey, that last movie was such a success that we can get more money
and make a *real* movie now."  Too bad they didn't simply stick with
the formula from the first movie.</P>
<P>        I could write volumes about the things that are wrong with
this picture, but here are the high points:</P>
<P>        *  The acting is truly bad.  Sandra Hess (playing the Sonya
Blade character) is particularly execrable, especially in scenes where
she tries to convince us that she loved  Johnny Cage (a character from
the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie).</P>
<P>        *  In one of the worst pieces of mis-casting I think I've
*ever* seen, James Remar plays Raiden, the God of Thunder.  In the
first movie, Christopher Lambert played Raiden and played his
character as though he was in on the joke:  A French actor playing a
Japanese thunder god being revered by Chinese mystics.  </P>
<P>        I generally like it when actors are cast against type (Tim
"Tiny" Lister, Jr. being cast as the President of the U.S. in THE
FIFTH ELEMENT, for example), and Remar has always been one of my
favorite "utility" actors  But he's so totally wrong for this part
that he doesn't even have the luxury of amused self-awareness.</P>
<P>        *  There are too many characters that are introduced as being
potentially important, but then never seen again.</P>
<P>        *  There are a number of completely meaningless story
sidetracks, including a muddled scene where Liu Kang (Robin Shou)
seeks out Nightwolf (Litefoot), has a mystical hallucination, and then
wanders off with Jade (Irina Pantaeva).</P>
<PRE>        For these reasons (and many others), I can only give the movie
a 2...</PRE>
<P>        ...unless you're a huge fan of the games and/or the first
movie.  In that case, the following critiques also apply:</P>
<P>        *  Sandra Hess, while being an even worse actress than
Bridgette Wilson (who played Sonya Blade in the first movie), is much
more convincing as a fighter.  Wilson looked like she was simply
mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer.
Hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts, and puts
together a much more believable fight scene.</P>
<P>        *  In the fights, each of the characters does at least *one*
thing they do in the game (and often more).  Sonya does her "Kiss of
Death," Jax does his "Earthquake," Liu Kang does his "Animality," and
so on.  A big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves
in the first movie and found them only rarely.</P>
<P>        *  There aren't as many fight scenes in this movie as there
were in the first, because the folks making the movie mistakenly try
to hang a more robust plot in between.  Silly, silly folks.  And the
lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a
mud-wrestling match.  Lame and so obviously sexist even I (politically
incorrect, for the most part) noticed and remarked upon it.</P>
<P>        *  The special effects are generally better, except for the
final fight scene between the Emporer and Liu Kang in which both
perform their "Animalities."  Motaro and Sheeva are both more
convincing and lifelike than Goro was in the first movie.</P>
<P>        For folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the
games, I give this a 5.  You'll probably like it, but not nearly as
much as you liked the first one.</P>
