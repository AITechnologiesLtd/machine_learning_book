<P>I suppose that the seamless blend of animated cartoon characters and real
live actors on the big screen was a pretty big deal back in 1988, when WHO
FRAMED ROGER RABBIT captured the nation's attention. But nowadays, with the
incredible innovations in computer generated imagery, DVD and the
mind-blowing effects in films like THE MATRIX and THE PHANTOM MENACE, it
takes a little more to get us excited, right? Allrighty-then...how's about
producing yet another remake of an old, cheezy cartoon television series,
but this time, mix in some live-action folks and see how that plays. Sound
like a good idea?</P>
<PRE>Yeah, I guess <yawn>.</PRE>
<P>PLOT:
After having been cancelled from television back in the 1960s, TV cartoon
characters Rocky and Bullwinkle are left to dwindle their lives away in
their animated world of Frostbite Falls, until their nefarious counterparts,
Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader escape, and take a live-action leap into
today's real world. It isn't long before the cartoon two-some are summoned
by a rookie FBI agent in the hopes of squishing Fearless Leader's maniacal
plot to become the president of the United States.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A very cartoony film with a quick pace, may be suited for fans of the old
series, but falls flat within today's comedic standards set by the Simpsons,
with many unfunny goofy puns, easy jokes and childish pranks. Strangely
enough, many of the jokes in this film are geared towards adults with many
play-on-words and literal interpretations, but at the same time, the film is
more than obviously meant for children, with a silly plot, over-the-top bad
guys and oh-so simple humor ("Allow me to be frank with you" - "Oh hullo
Frank, I'm Bullwinkle"). Yeesh! Yet another COPS parody also didn't twirl my
nipples, and neither did half a million Bullwinkle misinterpretations, which
I suppose were meant to be funny, but just left me feeling kind of,
well...bored. I'll admit that I was never much of a fan of the original TV
series on which this film is based (if I was flipping the channels and it
was on, I generally tuned it for a bit, but that was about it), but I reckon
that most kids who will go see this movie, would not have seen it either, so
let's just hope that they "get it". Personally, I wasn't taken by either of
the two leads, be it Rocky or Bullwinkle, and I especially didn't care for
the dim-witted aspect of the Moose. Oh, I get it...he's stupid, so that's
funny!</P>
<P>To be fair, I did hear quite a few people laughing in my audience, but even
then, most of them were adults. I suppose that if you're in "the mood" and
appreciate the "Bullwinkle humor", then you might enjoy this film, which to
its credit, doesn't take itself seriously for a moment, and sure doesn't
pretend to be about anything either. It's a cartoon movie with some
live-action stars intermixed. In the end, the film will either work for you
or not depending on your connection to the humor. The film's first 20
minutes are probably its most ambitious, with an excellent explanation of
how the badly drawn duo from the 60s got to be the better-looking 3D
animation characters in the year 2000. There is also a pretty cool sequence
featuring Bullwinkle literally "surfing the Internet" near the end, but
other than that, the effects did little to impress me. The film is also
filled with plenty of cameos (see below), most of which feature actors whose
best work is long behind them, and also stars a cute Britney Spears wannabee
FBI agent, who I've never heard of before, but from whom I wouldn't mind
hearing again! Robert DeNiro must've taken a little less than a week to film
his scenes, because he's barely in the film, while Alexander and Russo both
perform admirably as the notorious No-Goodniks from Pottsylvania, Boris and
Natasha. But in the end, without much to impress me visually, without much
humor to make me laugh, and without much of a story (granted, the film is a
cartoon, you don't really expect much there), the film didn't do much for
me.</P>
<P>But who knows, others may just enjoy it on their own level as an empty,
frivolous, campy (funny to some), children's cartoon. And for anyone who
wants to tell me to "lighten up", I'd be more than happy to accept your
directive. I'll be the one watching yet another hilarious episode of TV's
"The Simpsons". Now, there's some real humor!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This film does manage to spoof a couple of other famous movies, including a
flying scene straight out of SUPERMAN, and the infamous "you talkin' to me"
scene from TAXI DRIVER, interpreted once again, by the man who helped make
those words immortal in the first place, Robert DeNiro.
Several star cameos line this film including Janeane Garofalo, Carl Reiner,
Jonathan Winters (playing three different parts), Whoopie Goldberg, Billy
Crystal, David Alan Grier and John Goodman.
Look for DeNiro's own daughter in this film, Drena DeNiro, in a small part
as a RBTV lackey. She is actually his daughter through adoption. She is
Diahnne Abbott's real daughter from a previous marriage. DeNiro adopted her
when he was married to Abbott from 1976-1988.
Director Des McAnuff was originally a stage director, and the man
responsible for bringing The Who's "Tommy" to Broadway. His first foray into
film directing came in 1998 when he directed COUSIN BETTE starring Jessica
Lange. He also produced last year's critically acclaimed animated feature
THE IRON GIANT.
Rumor has it that "Simpsons" creator Matt Groening inserted the infamous "J"
in Homer J. Simpson's name as an homage to Rocky & Bullwinkle, whose full
names are Rocky J. Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose. Their middle "J" comes
from creator Jay Ward's own name.
So what has the Britney Spears-like actress (aka Piper Perabo) of this film
done besides this, you may ask? Well, actually not much, although she is one
of the stars in that all-girl sexy, momma-jomma film coming out in August,
COYOTE UGLY, so stay tuned!
Executive producer Tiffany Ward is Jay Ward's daughter. Jay Ward is the
creator of the series upon which this film is based, as well as the man
behind the characters in GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE and DUDLEY DO-RIGHT.
June Foray, the original voice behind Rocky, is back as the voice of the
flying squirrel in this film. Australian comedian-mimic Keith Scott voices
both Bullwinkle and the film's omnipresent, wry narrator.
Screenwriter Kenneth Lonergan also co-wrote the DeNiro comedy ANALYZE THIS.</P>
