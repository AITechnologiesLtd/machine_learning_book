<P>   We don't look for political edge in summer films targeted to
a young audience and for the most part people won't
consider "Shanghai Noon" to be political.  But for adults who
think too much, there is indeed such a memorandum.  The
movie, which pits a Chinese villain against a Chinese hero,
marries a Chinese superstar to an American Indian maiden,
mounts an Asian champion against a bevy of American
Marlboro men, and most of all insinuates a hugely successful
friendship between a laid-back Southern-Cal type of outlaw
and a Pekingese, serves to indoctrinate the audience
into the joys of political correctness while simultaneously
sending up the whole liberal notion of P.C.  Though set in the
1880's, "Shanghai Noon" has a surprisingly modern feel,
especially when you hear one character phrase himself with
expressions like "OK" and "cool" and hear Chinese people
who are in America for a brief time speaking almost perfect,
Carson City English.</P>
<P>   "Shanghai Noon" is yet another showcase for the dazzling
physical performances of Hong Kong kung-fu conqueror
Jackie Chan (born Chan Kwong-Sang), considered by some
to be the world's most popular movie actor.  At the age of
forty-six he still does his own stunts and performs high kicks,
rapid pirouettes, and blazing fistplay that make us question
why so many athletes quit the pros before they hit their fifth
decade.  Having performed on the screen since 1971 in the
obscure "Little Tiger from Canton" and then capturing the
cheers of a youthful American public with the likes of
"Supercop," "Rumble in the Bronx" and "Police Story," Chan
has been compared to no less a figure than Buster Keaton. 
As you watch Chan's latest, which is filmed in a part of
Canada that looks a good deal like the American West
a decade or so after the Civil War, you can't help
thinking of the Kansas-born Keaton, who got his start in a
family acrobatic comedy that had the father literally sweep
the floor with the child's outstretched body.  </P>
<P>   Chan likewise sweeps through his scenes, sometimes used
as a mop but ultimately triumphing thanks to nothing more
than the equipment he was born with and the fast-shooting of
his new American friend played by the strikingly handsome
and usually relaxed Owen Wilson as his unlikely pard. 
Though the screenplay is largely an excuse for one action
scene after another, scripters Alfred Gough and Miles Millar
provide their people with splashes of high-spirited wit while
director Tom Dey presides over scenes of slapstick chaos. 
Dey opens his picture in China's Forbidden City in 1881
where during a ceremony of the Imperial Guard (something
like Saddam's Republican Guard, designed to protect the
god-like figures), where the esteemed princess (Lucy Liu)
opposes a projected marriage to a nerd.  After her tutor
sneaks her out by ship to America, she is kidnapped and held
for a ransom in gold.  When Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) is
sent by the emperor to get her back, he gets lost on his way
to Carson City, Nevada, winds up with train robber Roy
O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), and despite their initial differences
in culture and temperament wind up the best of pals and
partners in the plot to pick up the princess.</P>
<P>   Aside from the occasionally sharp script, which includes
lines like "Your name is Chon Wang?  That's a terrible
cowboy name!" "Shanghai Noon" is remarkable principally by
the way the innumerable fights are choreographed without
much help from the MTV department.  The barroom brawls
and open-air confrontations look uncommonly authentic, and
yet, given the solid chemistry between Chan and Wilson, the
audience can look forward to amusing exchanges during the
relatively quiet intervals.  Look to this movie to provide the
much needed breakout for Owen Wilson--who could be
compared to a young Robert Redford and used effectively in
much-delayed sequels to "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid."</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 110 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
