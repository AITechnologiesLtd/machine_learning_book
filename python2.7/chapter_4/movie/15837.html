<P>Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) isn't a bad guy -- he's just a rich guy. He, along
with his father (Dabney Coleman), owns one of the more successful
bookstore chains in New York, Fox Books. He knows that business isn't
personal, and that he isn't intentionally putting all of the independent
bookstores out of business. Nonetheless, Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) feels
the effects of Fox Books directly – she owns The Store Around the
Corner, which specializes in children's books and has been in business
for forty-two years. Kathleen takes it personally, and she hates Joe
Fox.</P>
<P>What Kathleen and Joe don't know is that they're having an on-line
e-mail affair with one another. Because they've made a pact to not
divulge personal information through the internet, they have no idea of
each other's true identity. They both feel guilty about pseudo-cheating
on their spouses; Joe's editor girlfriend, Patricia (a wonderful Parker
Posey) is a shallow beast, while Kathleen's relationship with journalist
Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear) lacks passion. And so begins a surprisingly
funny and touching situational comedy that relies almost completely on
the cuteness factor.</P>
<P>You've Got Mail couldn't have been more perfectly timed. Here we have a
movie about the internet, starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, and directed
by Nora Ephron. It's a money-making machine, guaranteed to rake in
hundreds of millions of dollars. It doesn't bother me that it's a film
built to make money, because it's been built the right way: You've Got
Mail features a bright, thoughtful script, but it also features two
immensely appealing actors playing people that we wouldn't mind knowing
in real life. </P>
<P>Oh sure, it's gooey and sentimental. There's no doubt that the people
involved really wanted to make us cry. What makes You've Got Mail
different from the typical tear-jerker, aside from being made with a lot
of skill, is that I almost felt inclined to get all teary-eyed at the
end. I really had to fight it off. Any movie that forces me to fight off
tears is worth something.</P>
<P>What You've Got Mail comes down to is how much we love Tom Hanks and
Meg Ryan. Both performers are great at what they do: they've both proven
themselves in numerous dramatic and comedic performances. You've Got
Mail requires a little of everything; Hanks has the difficult role of
making Joe Fox likable, even though he seems at first to be a rich
sadist. Ryan, who is literally too cute for words (and too cute for sex
appeal, I'm afraid) is very funny, and even manages to do a little bit
of acting. Some of the best scenes occur when Joe and Kathleen hate each
other – their first encounter at a caviar party is perfectly timed. </P>
<P>Of course, there's a lot more to like about the movie, not the least of
which is the spectacular supporting cast. Posey is so perfect as Joe's
superficial girlfriend (although it's surprising to see her in a
mainstream film). Kinnear is convincing and engaging, although he's been
stuck with the role of the boyfriend who gets blown off (the plot device
introduced to keep him from seeming like a loser isn't very effective).
Coleman has some good scenes as Joe's thoughtless father. And Ephron
ties everything together with a nice script and some great romantic
comedy pacing.</P>
<P>What I really liked about You've Got Mail is that it doesn't feel like
an obligatory blockbuster. It has an emotional center and realistic
characters to care about. Joe, for instance, is a troubled man, and
Hanks adds a dimension to the character that might not have been present
in the hands of a lesser actor. In fact, I'm surprised with how much I
liked this movie – it's a perfect family Christmas release, because it
does its job with class and style. And even though you may feel like
you've been dunked in syrup by the end, this particular kind of syrup
tastes pretty good.</P>
