<P>COTR justifies doubly its being a mockumentary: it is fiction in
documentary clothes and it mocks its subject all the way. It stars Judy
Davis, who was launched internationally in her second film, My Brilliant
Career --a title that turned out to be prophetic for Miss Davis.</P>
<P>In COTR she plays (and I mean plays, as she is a unique performer rather
than just a star), over a span of four decades, an Australian woman called
Joan. She has no private life but is a dedicated believer in Communism, in
the Revolution and in Stalin,  once the Uncle Joe of so many people around
the globe. She has painstakingly learned to write Russian in order to keep
writing letters to the Soviet dictator.</P>
<P>The missives are unanswered, but one day, as they are being read by Kremlin
apparatchiks, all those flunkies-in-uniform are touched to tears. Like
other scenes, there is broad humor here, a la Mel Brooks. The result is
that Stalin learns about Joan and invites her to Moscow.</P>
<P>The man is played (also broadly and amusingly) by F. Murray Abraham as an
aging, horny goat, doubly irascible because he is trying to stop smoking --
another clever touch for those who remember Stalin's eternal pipe.</P>
<P>In Australia, Joan has always looked frumpy, with the kind of  bad hair day
that extends to years -- a touch that  is true of a certain type. In the
USSR she looks gorgeous in sexy red, from dress to accessories, but the
hair remains the same, like Joan's fanatical beliefs.  Stalin is aroused.
Stalin makes passes. Stalin has congress with virginal Joan during the
night of March 4 to 5, 1953. Uncle Joe dies.</P>
<P>In Australia, Joan had met Nine (a name that parodies James Bond's 007) an
investigating Aussie Government spy. In Moscow, he reappears in the regalia
of a KGB Colonel. He coolly explains: "The Australians think you are a spy
for the Russians. They want me to kill you. The Russians brought me over to
look after you. Frankly, it's a bit of a tangle. I'll have to make it up as
I go along." Delightfully, the film too makes itself up as it goes along.</P>
<P>The night Stalin rejoined his Georgian ancestors, a panicky Joan tells Nine
" I killed him." In the ensuing consolation, Joan and Nine sleep together.
The next day, Comrades Beria, Krushchev and Malenkov whom Stalin, ever the
lover of Hollywood flicks, derisively called his Three Stooges, feast Joan
with flowers and song.</P>
<P>Returning to Sydney pregnant, our heroine finally marries her longtime
suitor Welch whose Red politics are mostly a way to stay with Joan.
Geoffrey Rush of "Shine"  does him in a quiet, minor key and sometimes
reminds me of James Woods.</P>
<P>Nine months later, a son is born to her. He is named Joe. The kid grows up
properly indoctrinated, and with a love of jails, something that starts out
as a child's a game --with the assistance of friendly, amused policemen.</P>
<P>As young Joe grows up, the movie, with its knack for the unexpected, slyly
treats his kinky prison complex as a form of bondage. It leads to a
wonderful love affair with arresting, leather- and-handcuffs-bearing
mounted constable Anna. (She reminds me at times of Juliet Lewis). There
are hilarious scenes of touchy-feely sex through the prison parlor's glass
and wire.</P>
<P>Madly inventive details chronicle Joe's career, from learning in prison
about Stalin's crimes to being "tortured" by the authorities with
industrial strength frying bacon smells that are supposed to break him. Joe
becomes a hero during a jail fire, grows a mustache (intelligently, not
exactly like Stalin's) to cover his burned lip, goes on to amassing
political power, but not in the direction that Mom expected.</P>
<P>Joan is not only let down by her flesh and blood, but by the Gorbachev
years  which will lead inexorably to the horror of a Macdonalds in Red
Square and "the end of civilization as we know it." All the while, Joe is
solicitously looked after by  his now-wife Anna, his nominal father Welch,
and by a weirdly sweet and loving Nine who suspects that Joe may be his own
son.</P>
<P>Writer-director Duncan rewrites Australian history with an  uncompromising
courage for unrealistic fantasy. (Note, among other aspects, how some
principal characters hardly age). Duncan treats events and characters as
wildly fabricated history and with bits wildly borrowed from movies.</P>
<P>Duncan's two BAs (1989)-- in Arts and in Laws --were followed by a period
of legal practice. He then switched to a three-year degree from the
Australian Film, TV and Radio school, made short films while at the school
and co-wrote the excellent documentary series Faces of War.</P>
<P>COTR, his grand slam feature debut, began as a discussion he had about
Christianity. This led to thinking about twentieth century passions, and to
remembrances of his own grand-father, a card carrying communist party
member who never wavered in his faith in  Stalin.</P>
<P>The resulting movie goes well beyond socialism and communism. Its subtext
is what longshoreman-philosopher Eric Hoffer (1902 -1983) wrote so sharply
about in books like The True Believer ( on mass movements), or The Ordeal
of Change (on reactions to major  sociopolitical upheavals). Whether or not
Duncan knew those works, their principles underlie his film. Political and
other  -isms are interchangeable. Whether fanatics or opportunists, the
believers can switch to other camps.</P>
<P>Filmically, COTR deals with Marxism in a Groucho Marxian way. Characters
are exaggerated, break into American movie songs ( ("I Get a Kick Out Of
You." "You're the Top"), even dance, at the drop of a cap. The fabricated
facts go into seeming incoherences and non sequiturs as they break the
rules of orderly scripting. Film buffs will find many (but not obvious)
cinematic touches. Such as a parody of the already parodied commissars in
Ninotchka , or as when Joe, gradually alienating himself from others, is
seen isolated  in his large, "inhuman" office that echoes visuals of
Citizen Kane.</P>
<P>There may be too much packed in the movie, although  a second viewing will
sift through the components and makes the film even more coherent and
enjoyable for those who are aware of history and film history. The paradox
here is that this work about the masses is     not a film for the masses.</P>
