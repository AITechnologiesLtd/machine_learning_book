<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   Along with Antonia Bird's PRIEST, the film which stirred up the most
   controversy in 1995 was undoubtedly Larry Clark's KIDS, an
   unflinching portrayal of youth alienation which rocked the
   establishment and provoked much heated debate on whether the film was
   an important social commentary on the state of youth in America
   (publications no less than the New York Times screamed "A wake-up
   call to the world!"), or merely an exploitative, sensationalistic
   piece of work.  KIDS, originally a Miramax release (which by that
   time had been acquired by the Walt Disney Corporation), stirred up so
   much trouble for its parent company that upon receiving the dreaded
   NC-17 rating from the MPAA, a one-shot spinoff distribution arm,
   Excalibur Films, was created by Disney solely for the unrated
   domestic release of the film.</P>
<P>   While the film was helmed by photographer Larry Clark, the vision for
   KIDS was that of Harmony Korine, who wrote the screenplay for the
   film while still in his teens.  Mr. Korine, now 23, makes his return
   with his feature film directorial debut of GUMMO, an indulgent,
   highly experimental piece of work once again centered around
   disaffected, lower-class youth in America.</P>
<P>   Mr. Korine has proclaimed that film is the ultimate collage artform,
   and his adherence to this sensibility is in clear evidence in GUMMO;
   the film lacks any sort of conventional narrative structure, and is
   instead a virtual kaleidoscope of varying images and sequences.
   Without a central viewpoint, GUMMO is essentially a mishmash of
   outrageous material which is clearly intended to shock and provoke
   its audience.</P>
<P>   As far as one can piece together, GUMMO is set in Xenia, Ohio, a
   conservative town devastated by a 1974 tornado -- this is alluded to
   in the film by some grainy handheld, presumably amateur footage of
   the storm in action which bookends GUMMO -- which is depicted as an
   amoral, impoverished, low-class neighbourhood perhaps only a tiny
   step or two above trailer park territory.  Parental guidance and
   authority figures are ineffectual, misguided, or altogether absent,
   and the youth of the town are essentially given free rein to do as
   they please.  The film introduces the audience to the repellent yet
   oddly compelling daily activities of various adolescents one would
   typically make conscious efforts to avoid in reality, and while GUMMO
   plays out as a series of generally unconnected vignettes, three
   groups of recurring characters come to the forefront of the film:
   three bleached blond sisters Dot (Chloe Sevigny, who also acts as the
   film's costume designer), Helen (Carisa Bara), and Darby (non-actor
   Darby Dougherty), who aimlessly kill time with such bizarre exercises
   (which presumably aspire to be titilative) as attempting to enhance
   their areolae through repeated applications of electrical tape onto
   their breasts; a strange, aphonic skateboarder called Bunny Boy
   (non-actor Jacob Sewell) who suitably sports a headpiece sprouting
   rabbit ears and lingers on the outskirts of the action; and Solomon
   (Jacob Reynolds, genuinely frightening-looking) and Tummler
   (non-actor and reforming paint sniffer Nick Sutton), two nightmarish
   boys who prowl around on their bicycles like latter-day dementedly
   twisted versions of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, in search of
   stray cats to kill and sell to the local butcher in exchange for
   solvents to inhale or money to give to Cole (Max Perlich), a local
   who pimps his retarded sister out of his suburban home.</P>
<P>   An early scene in GUMMO perfectly encapsulates the film's aesthetic.
   The vignette introduces Bunny Boy lingering at a fenced highway
   overpass: with his giant set of pink bunny ears and his blank,
   youthful appearance, he seems very much like an innocent cypher, an
   anomalous presence amongst the bleak, drab concrete backdrop.
   Suddenly, in an unprovoked paroxysm which is in part startling and
   admittedly bemusing in its audacity, we see him in turn spitting onto
   passing automobiles, violently kicking at the protective fencing in a
   bout of primal destructiveness, urinating from the overpass onto the
   highway below, and dangling precociously from the overhead fencing.</P>
<P>   Mr. Korine's GUMMO is evidently a reactionary piece against the
   conforms of traditional filmmaking technique.  While the film defies
   a conventional narrative and generally lacks a central frame of
   reference, it also dares to combine 35mm, video, and Super 8 footage
   and Polaroid photographs in its visuals, and its sound mix is pushed
   up to a point where the film occasionally becomes physically painful
   to listen to: a prolonged sequence where two preteen boys are
   screaming a bevy of astonishing worldly profanities at a prone,
   "dead" Bunny Boy is almost unbearably uncomfortable to endure.</P>
<P>   In attendance with his film at the 1997 Venice International Film
   Festival, Mr. Korine caused a stir when he proclaimed that he hated
   actors only to reverse himself minutes later: "Never mind, I like
   actors."  A few days later, at the 1997 Toronto International Film
   Festival, he apparently changed his mind again, asserting "I hate
   actors."  Whatever his sentiment towards professional actors may be,
   Mr. Korine's use of amateur actors and his childhood friends in GUMMO
   is occasionally effective in capturing the aura of authenticity the
   film generally strives for, but all too often his performers appear
   exceedingly conscious of the camera during inopportune naturalistic
   moments, and tend to focus their performances towards showmanship.
   The ability to improvise can be a difficult task even for seasoned
   actors, and for the most part the non-professionals are woefully
   inept when called upon for spontaneity; Mr. Korine himself is a chief
   offender in a terribly awkward scene which arbitrarily results in him
   pouring a bottle of beer upon himself.</P>
<P>   While there can be no doubting that GUMMO profiles a stunning
   collection of deviant characters -- indeed, there are no customary
   'normal' characters to be found -- and features outrageous acts of
   casual violence and depravity which are sure to offend some (cat
   lovers beware), the film is sporadically raucously funny and never
   becomes dull.  The sheer temerity in the behaviour of those depicted
   in GUMMO is often hysterical -- a particularly memorable moment is
   when a group of men take leisure in beating the hell out of a metal
   chair -- but it is all too clear that we are meant to gawk at, not
   empathise with, the characters in the film.</P>
<P>   Given GUMMO's distinct lack of commercial elements and its inherently
   controversial, vaguely disturbing nature, some may end up wondering
   why Cary Woods and Fine Line commissioned the film, even at its
   reportedly modest budget of $1 million.  The answer would seem to be:
   Harmony Korine, who remains a much-coveted property as a
   screenwriter, with two projects already on tap.  While $1 million may
   eventually prove to be a small price to pay to establish a long-term
   relationship with a talent like Mr. Korine, one would have to
   conclude that it's unlikely that another similarly indulgent film
   would be condoned in the future. </P>
