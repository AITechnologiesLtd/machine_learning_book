<PRE>                             PRELUDE TO A KISS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Romance, comedy, fantasy, and even a
     little softcore horror combine in an intelligent and
     thoroughly enjoyable film.  PRELUDE handles an old idea, but
     at the same time says a lot about life and human
     relationships.  Even the acting by minor characters is good.
     (This is one of those films whose actual premise comes as a
     surprise well into the film.  I will be very vague below
     rather than spoil the plot.)  Rating: high +2.</P>
<P>     Peter Hoskins (played by Alec Baldwin) and Rita Boyle (played by Meg
Ryan) are made for each other.  They are both bright, lively people.  Peter
is quiet, sedate, and thoughtful.  Rita on the other hand
 is all over the map.  She clearly playfully loves life in the daylight but
at night has terrors that something terrible will happen to her world.  She
does not know how right she is.  Something will happen to her on her wedding
day.  It is something that is weird, right out of the Twilight Zone with
touches of Kafka.  At the same time Peter is going to be pulled into a
strange struggle to prove his love.</P>
<P>     Take an idea that has been done many times in films.  Make it one that
everybody thought could not be done one more time.  Give this idea to a good
enough writer and you occasionally can find fresh new approaches.  In this
case the writer is Craig Lucas who proves that an old fantasy mechanism can
be given a new spin and can reveal insights into human nature and the aging
process that nobody has seen in it before.   Lucas wrote his story first as
a Broadway play.  Now he adapted his story into a screenplay.  PRELUDE TO A
KISS was his fifth play and second produced screenplay.  His previous film
was the excellent LONGTIME COMPANION.  Lucas's play MISSING PERSONS, his
film LONGTIME COMPANION, and now his film PRELUDE TO A KISS were all
directed by Norman Rene'.  Rene' who must be a great director, since just
about every speaking performance in his films seems to be very good.  I
think many people will be enthralled by Richard Riehle's performance as an
elderly man who crashes the wedding.  I found myself fascinated with a small
but magnetic performance by Stanley Tucci playing Peter's best friend,
Taylor.  It is just a small role, but Rene' invests the character with a lot
of personality.  Also notable is Ned Beatty as Rita's father, but most
people expect Beatty to turn in a good performance.  It is some of the
lesser known actors who give this film its texture.</P>
<P>     PRELUDE TO A KISS is a light fantasy with some heavy ideas that
audiences can think about or choose to ignore.  Operating on multiple
levels, it is a surprisingly satisfying film to be coming out in the summer
fluff season.  I rate it a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
