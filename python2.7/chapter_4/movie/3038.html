<PRE>                           THE BROWNING VERSION
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     The film is an adaptation by Ronald Harwood of the Terence
Rattigan play with some small changes.</P>
<P>     It is announced that Andrew Crocker-Harris (Albert Finney), a
classics professor for more than twenty years at the Abbey School is
resigning.  Despite his strong desire to instill in his students an
appreciation for the great works of literature, he is being let go.
Many of the students in the Lower Fifth refer to him as "Old Hitler."</P>
<P>     Crocker-Harris has another problem: his young wife, Laura, (Greta
Scacchi), who with little attempt at secrecy is carrying on an affair
with the physics teacher (Matthew Modine).  The hardship of living with
a young wife who despises him, Andrew now finds himself with a life
that has been wasted.   His replacement is coming in with some new
ideas about how to teach literature.</P>
<P>     Entirely literate, it is a touching film.  Add to that the fine
acting of Albert Finney in a somewhat different role than that with
which he is usually associated, and we have a very worthwhile film.</P>
<PRE>     Directed by Mike Figgis.</PRE>
