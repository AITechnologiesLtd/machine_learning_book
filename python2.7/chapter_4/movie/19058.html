<P>"Hurlyburly" is an actors' dream, but there is a nearly non-existent 
storyline. Set "a little while ago" in Los Angeles, Eddie (Sean Penn) is a 
casting director who lives in a high-profile home in the Hollywood hills with 
his cold business partner, Mickey (Kevin Spacey), and a nasty-tempered 
struggling actor, Phil (Chazz Palminteri). The film follows them through a 
year in their life, centering on Eddie, who slowly begins to realize that a 
life full of nothing but drugs, sex, and partying is an empty life, indeed. 
Overly talky, no doubt due to the fact that it is based on a stage play, but 
just when I was about to give up on the mostly dispicable characters in the 
second half, the gentle, touching ending snuck up and left me emotionally 
shaken. Sean Penn has never been better than he is here, and that's saying 
quite a lot, while Anna Paquin (of 1993's "The Piano," for which she won the 
Best Supporting Actress Oscar at age 11), as a lost teenage wanderer, is 
remarkably refined, a character chamelion if I've ever seen one. Also of note 
is Meg Ryan, who sheds her "cutesy" image as a prostitute with a young 
daughter. Too bad more couldn't have happened in the plot department to equal 
up to the performances.</P>
