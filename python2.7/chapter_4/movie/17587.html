<P>"10 Things I Hate About You," a movie almost as warm and witty as its
title suggests, is the latest attempt to dress up Shakespeare in hip
garb.  Taking its inspiration from "Taming of the Shrew," "10 Things"
also throws in some slightly more contemporary ingredients - 1980s New
Wave hits, 1990s sexual frankness, etc. - and whips them into a bland
concoction that's a lot closer to sludge than it is to froth.  The
result seems to go on for weeks rather than hours; suffice it to say
there are a lot more than 10 things wrong with this film.</P>
<P>There's also one thing very right about it, the casting of Julia
Stiles as Kat Stratford, a high school student who drives around
listening to Joan Jett's "Bad Reputation" and who is denounced by her
classmates as a "bitter, self-righteous hag," even though she's quite
lovely in the rare moments when she's smiling instead of snarling. Kat
prefers reading Sylvia Plath and mailing out college applications to
socializing with the gang at Padua High, much to the dismay of her
younger, peppier and far more popular sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik),
who prowls the campus in sundresses she apparently has been sewn into.</P>
<P>That makes Bianca prime date-bait, but Dad (Larry Miller), an
obstetrician who spends his days "up to my elbows in placenta" thanks
to teen pregnancies, has forbidden Bianca to go out until Kat finds a
guy, something that seems about as likely as Puff Daddy writing one of
his own songs. It's up to Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Bianca's
would-be beau, to contrive a solution that will get Kat out of the
house and put Bianca by his side.</P>
<P>The pleasingly acerbic Stiles, one of the few redeeming factors about
the recent mini-series "The '60s," gives it her all, and if the script
of "10 Things" had had one-tenth the zest of the now-classic
"AtomicShakespeare" episode of the TV series "Moonlighting" (which
also used "Shrew" as its springboard) she might have managed to make
something of the vehicle.  Unfortunately, as "10 Things" turns into
another guy-makes-bet-about-girl story, it ends up covering much of
the same territory as "She's All That," and with much less charm and
wit.</P>
<P>The dialogue is resolutely flat - "where did you come from? The planet
Loser?" Bianca asks Kat in one typical crack -and by the time
screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith drop in the
inevitable "you're sooo not who I thought you were" scene, the film is
a lost cause.</P>
<P>It is worth mentioning, however, that Lutz and Smith are kind enough
to put in some bits that the Bard forgot to write, such as a
rollicking teen beer bash and a finale set at a prom that features not
one, but two second-rate bands. So much for the evolution of art in
the last 400-odd years.</P>
