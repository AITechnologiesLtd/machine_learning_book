                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>** (out of 4 = fair)
1973, R, 122 minutes [2 hours, 2 minutes]
[horror/drama]
starring: Jason Miller (Father Damon Karras), Ellen Burstyn (Christine
MacNeil), Linda Blair (Regan MacNeil), Max von Sydow (Father Merrin), written
and produced by William Peter Blatty (based on his novel), directed by
William Friedkin.</P>
<P>"The Exorcist" puts itself forward as a completely logical story that just
happens to be about demonic possession. Unfortunately, the harder it tries
not to be a mindless horror flick, the more it becomes one.</P>
<P>The story is simple; an innocent 12-year-old girl,  Regan MacNeil (Blair),
becomes possessed by a demonic spirit. At first, her mother Christine
(Burstyn), along with some medical doctors think she has a lesion in her
brain which is causing her to act so strange, but when no physical evidence
is found, they assume it's a psychological disorder. Then the possibility of
spiritual possession is brought up. At first Christine scoffs the idea, but
then believes it after finding no other explanation. </P>
<P>Now, this story is fine and the film does a good job in creating a
suspenseful mood since we seem to be the only ones who can see the obvious.
Horror stories thrive on this kind of element, so when the evil things happen
we can say to the naysayers, "Told you so." However, the manner in which the
film actually breaks down the plot and uses this element is quite
exploitative.</P>
<P>The entire first act moves very slowly. There are scenes intended to
establish the setting as everyday normality, but don't add up to anything.
Since this is a horror movie there are also short scenes intended to scare us
but don't. For example, Christine hears constant rumblings in the attic and
believes it to be rats, but when she checks to see if the traps the butler
set are working, they turn out to be empty. Another scene shows the lights in
the house flickering for no reason, but no one seems to notice.</P>
<P>There is also a sketchy scene in which Regan shows her mother a Ouija board
and says something about communicating with a being of another existence.
When Regan ultimately becomes possessed, is it because the Ouija board is
actually a demonic game? Whatever the reason is, it doesn't seem believable
she would become possessed at all.</P>
<P>Although the film tells its story seriously and presents the horrific as
plausible, the way it comes across is too transparent. I found it impossible
to believe no one thought Regan might be possessed after she speaks with a
demonic voice that is straight from the horror cliches, or when she flops
around her bed uncontrollably, or when her face and body start to mutate and
her eyes glaze over (there's medical evidence for all of this!?). Even her
own mother nor a priest is convinced when the furniture starts moving on its
own (nah, that happens all the time!).</P>
<P>Where there is evil there must be good to counter it, and the film's good
force is represented by Father Damon Karras (Miller). Unfortunately, Karras
is having self doubts, and when his mother dies he feels guilty and weak.
Christine goes to Karras for help, but he warns her he could end up causing
more harm than good. The doubting religious servant in the midst of trouble
is such a cliche and the film placates to the audience by using him as a weak
good force to combat the powerful evil. Even Karras' first name is obviously
symbolic.</P>
<P>The demon inside Regan could have been a much more interesting "character."
When it overpowers Regan's body and attacks people, it screams obscenities
which sound like the demon learned from watching horror movies. Father Karras
even engages in dialogue with the demon, and I think it would have been
interesting if he had asked it about the specifics of Hell. Or more
importantly, why, out of the people in the world did it choose to posses
Regan? If the devil is supposed to be so smart, why not posses someone more
important and powerful? These questions aren't even asked, let alone
answered. Instead, the demon blatantly tries to get under Karras' skin by
reading his mind. </P>
<P>The last few scenes aren't nearly as intense as they should be. A world
renown exorcist, Father Merrin (von Sydow), is called in to help Father
Karras exorcise the demon. The actual ending itself could be seen as a great
poetic victory, but because everything seems so cheesy it doesn't work well.</P>
<P>The true horror to "The Exorcist" is supposed to be derived from the film's
basis in reality. Compared to most horror films, it is realistic, but there
are simply too many unbelievable aspects and other flaws to take it
seriously, and thus it isn't scary. (4/23/97) (6/11/97)</P>
