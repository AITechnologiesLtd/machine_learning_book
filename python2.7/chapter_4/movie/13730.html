<PRE>No Time for Sergeants (1958)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 72</PRE>
<P>My respect for Andy Griffith as an actor rose
considerably after seeing him in two very good
films from the late 1950s, "A Face in the Crowd"
and "No Time for Sergeants".  While it seems
that Griffith has always played Southerners,
he doesn't play them all the same: each role is
a different character entirely.  Griffith shows
his talent and range in his early films and
television work, able to do comedic and dramatic
roles, and he was even a good singer.</P>
<P>Griffith is a naive (but not stupid) yokel drafted
into the Air Force as a Private.  His inexperience
and misconceptions with the Real World cause
endless trouble for those in contact with him,
especially world-weary Sergeant Myron McCormick
and querulous bunkmate Nick Adams.  Don Knotts
has a cameo, and the Griffith-Knotts chemistry
is as strong as it would be in "The Andy Griffith Show".</P>
<P>"No Time For Sergeants" could very well have been
a harmless but stupid comedy.  That it is much more
than that is to the credit of Griffith, who gives
his hayseed character genuine depth, and the script,
which is based on the novel by Mac Hyman.</P>
<P>That is not to say that the film is perfect.  The
boot camp has an overly relaxed atmosphere, and the
only time Griffith gets a deserved dressing down
is when he gapes in amazement at a WAC officer
(Jean Willes).  It does seem an amazing coincidence
that a lost Air Force plane should wander into a
nuclear test.  Also, Murray Hamilton's character,
a bullying Private, is not well developed.</P>
<P>Still, "No Time For Sergeants" is an entertaining
comedy, with excellent performances from Griffith
and McCormick.</P>
