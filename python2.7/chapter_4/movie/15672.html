<PRE>                             VAMPIRES 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
       0 out of 4 for being truly offensive towards the female sex</PRE>
<P>Cast: James Woods, Daniel Baldwin, Sheryl Lee, Thomas Ian Griffith, Tim
Guinee, Maximilian Schell.
Screenplay: Don Jakoby, based on the novel Vampire by John Steakley.
Director: John Carpenter.</P>
<P>Vampire's is a rude, chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as
pawns of abuse, present only to pleasure men, feed vampires, readied to
be bashed or beaten - till one's sensibilities is shocked by the low IQ
and mentality of this regressive movie. To make matters worse, the
buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks, and deserve to have
their heads bitten off, if not, their bodies carved in half. The dilemma
of hating the ‘heroes' as much as the ‘villains', makes one wish that
the ‘Hand of God' would suddenly appear and blast both parties into
oblivion. James Wood portrays Jack Crow, a man obsessed with killing
vampires, whose soul reason for living is based on revenge (they killed
his parents), but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious
than the vampires. As for Adam Baldwin, he is nothing more than a stooge
who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts ‘action', and the
script should have been reworked to avoid much offence against the
female sex. As for the claims that the Catholic Church created
‘Dracula', well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion, outside
the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury, with
enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame. An awful movie on
all counts, my suggestion is to bring back Buffy and bury this group of
incompetent, rude vampire slayers.</P>
