<P>The gallows comedy, "Drowning Mona," is set in Verplunck, a small town
in New York's Hudson Valley that was once a test market for Yugos. The
national rollout of the chintzy cars proved to be a massive bust, but in
Verplunck, everyone still tools around in the little death traps. The
loser-mobiles are the perfect vehicles for the citizens of this weird
burg. With its motley assortment of backstabbers, cheaters, connivers
and other ne'er-do-wells, the community serves as the Bizarro Mayberry;
a petri dish of colorful yahoos that could provide Jerry Springer enough
guests for a year or two.</P>
<P>Opening day reviews of "Drowning Mona" were overwhelmingly negative,
with most critics slamming virtually every aspect of the movie. Count me
in the minority. While noting various problem areas, I was too busy
laughing to worry about them much. "Drowning Mona" may be a mess, but
it's a funny one.</P>
<P>It begins with the demise of Mona Dearly (Bette Midler), who plunges to
a watery death when the brakes on her Yugo fail to work. Laid-back
police chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito) soon learns that the car had been
sabotaged and launches a murder investigation. Narrowing the suspect
list proves a difficult task – Mona was a monster widely hated
throughout the community. In the matter of Mona's murder, any number of
Chief Rash's friends and neighbors had motive enough to whack the
harridan.</P>
<P>While the whodunit fuels the storyline, the real payoff in "Drowning
Mona" comes from studying Verplunk's low wattage luminaries. There's
jittery Phil Dearly (William Fichtner), Mona's battered husband (among
other things, she smacked him in the head with a frying pan) who has
been carrying on an affair with Rona Mace (Jamie Lee Curtis), a sexy
waitress at the local diner. His son Jeff (Marcus Thomas) is another
creepy piece of work. The surly boob lost a hand under mysterious
circumstances (we're shown several possible scenarios for the
mutilation, all involving him reaching for a beer at the wrong moment)
and is widely known for being almost as mean as his mother. While
working as a landscaper, he once mowed down a client's cat – literally.</P>
<P>Jeff's business partner, Bobby Calzone (Casey Affleck), was another
frequent recipient of Mona's fury. The blond, blandly polite kid divides
his time between trying to rid himself of Jeff, and working out details
for his upcoming wedding to Chief Rash's daughter, Ellen (Neve
Campbell), a feisty redneck used to getting exactly what she wants.</P>
<P>As far as colorful characters go, I've barely scraped the surface.
There's self-assured auto mechanic Lucinda (Kathleen Wilhoite), freaky
funeral director Cubby (Will Farrell), nosy old coot Clarence (Tracey
Walter, who plays a very similar role in "Erin Brockovich"), Chief
Rash's dumb cluck officers, led by the preening Feege (Peter Dobson) and
many others.</P>
<P>Writer Peter Steinfeld and director Nick Gomez juggle their large cast
well, making it surprisingly easy to remember each player in the
ensemble. Still, several of the more intriguing characters are sketchily
drawn and woefully underused. Steinfeld and Gomez treat "Drowning Mona"
as if it was one episode in a TV series, focusing on a few characters
for this installment while planning to highlight other cast members in
later shows.</P>
<P>The writing is just as uneven. A running gag about lovers using a "Wheel
of Fortune" board game as part of their sex play never takes off, and
the plotline, which reveals the identity of the killer far too early,
loses steam towards the end.</P>
<P>Still, the film is still funny. Beyond the obvious jokes lies an
absurdist sensibility that leads to a number of wonderful off-the-wall
moments. I won't spoil things by recounting them here, but one strong
example occurs when Bobby spots Jeff leering at a young girl and
exclaims "Come on, man, she just turned 13!" Jeff immediately replies,
"Finally!" Tasteless? You bet, but it still left me howling.</P>
<P>The cast has a great time playing the local yokels. Bette Midler gets to
strut her stuff in raucous flashbacks (unfortunately, the filmmakers
include one ill-conceived scene that softens the character, failing to
realize that for Mona to work, she needs to be as vile as humanly
possible). William Fichtner and Marcus Thomas make an effective
father-son pair, Danny DeVito nicely underplays his role and Neve
Campbell whoops it up as a hillbilly debutante. Jamie Lee Curtis,
Kathleen Wilhoite and Will Farrell also make indelible impressions,
despite being given scant screen time.</P>
<P>If you're looking for a comedy with finesse and good manners, "Drowning
Mona" is not for you. But if you simply want to laugh a lot and don't
mind a considerable amount of nastiness, feel free to ignore the
consensus and join me in the critical minority. I welcome the company.</P>
