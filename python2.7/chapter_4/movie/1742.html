<PRE>                                  ATAME!
                 (American title: TIE ME UP! TIE ME DOWN!)
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>101 min., NC-17, Comedy/Drama, 1990, In Spanish with English
subtitles
Director: Pedro Almodovar
Cast: Victoria Abril, Antonio Banderas, Loles Leon, Francisco Rabal,
      Julieta Serrano, Maria Barranco, Rossy de Palma</P>
<P>     Released mental patient Antonio Banderas kidnaps porn star Victoria
Abril when she refuses to marry him.  Banderas ties Abril up and keeps
her trapped in her apartment.  As Abril's captivity goes on, she starts
to fall for Banderas.</P>
<P>     ATAME! is certainly not a comedy for all people.  People with
obscure tastes, I think, will have the most chance of liking this film.
I enjoyed this film a lot and suggest that adventurous people take a
chance with this film.  Inspite of what the title might suggest, this is
not a S&M, T&A, or bondage film.  I give ATAME! a five on a scale of
zero to five.  ATAME! is rated NC-17 for female nudity, explicit
language, adult situations, and violence.  There are two versions of
ATAME! available, an NC-17 version and an unrated version (the version
that I saw).  Both versions have a run time of 101 minutes, so there
can't be more than a few seconds difference.</P>
<P>     The cast for this film is excellent, especially Victoria Abril (LA
LUNE DANS LE CANIVEAU [THE MOON IN THE GUTTER], AMANTES [LOVERS 1991
version], HIGH HEELS).  She brings her character alive when she is on
screen.  Victoria Abril is the highlight of this film.  Antonio Banderas
(WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN) also does a great job.
Francisco Rabal, who plays an old director in the film, has the funniest
character in the film.</P>
<P>     Spanish cult director Pedro Almodovar (WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN) has created an excellent dark comedy that will most
likely reward those who are willing to try this film with a great time.
ATAME! is excellently written and has great locations.  I think the way
that the drug district was set up to look was great.  The subtitles are
in yellow and done well, so that they can be read in all of the scenes.</P>
