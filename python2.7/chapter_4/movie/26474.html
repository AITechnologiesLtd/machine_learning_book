<PRE>NINJA SCROLL</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Yoshiaki Kawajiri
Written by: Yoshiaki Kawajiri</PRE>
<P>On a storm filled night in feudal Japan, the eight devils of Kimon ride into 
a small village, apparently bringing a plague with them. The devils are 
elite mercenaries, each with a special and unique power (one controls bees, 
one electricity, etc.). When all the villagers are killed, the local lord 
sends twenty ninja to investigate the event. They are all wiped out by one 
of the devils, save Kagero, the poison tester. She alone survives and is 
saved by Jubei, a wandering Ninja for hire. Now Jubei and Kagero have called 
the wrath of the devils down upon them, and the only way to survive will be 
to team up with a government spy named Dakuan. The three must travel to the 
plague filled village, find out who is behind the deaths, and stop them. 
Along the way they will be challenged by the eight devils and a legion of 
ninja, all led by an enemy from Jubei's past.</P>
<P>I know that's a short plot summary, but I don't want to give anything else 
away. It wouldn't take much to convince me that Yoshiaki Kawajiri's ("Wicked 
City") "Ninja Scroll" is the greatest anime (Japanese animation) ever 
created. Granted, I haven't seen a great many anime; I haven't even seen the 
much discussed "Princess Monoke"; but of the two dozen or so I've seen, 
nothing has even come close to the magnificence of "Ninja Scroll". A lot of 
what makes the film so great is that Kawajiri puts more effort and detail 
into his animated characters than most Hollywood directors put into their 
live ones. This effort, combined with incredible animation, an intriguing 
story, and some of the best action scenes ever (animated or otherwise) make 
"Ninja Scroll" one of, if not the best action movie of the past decade. Yet 
despite all the praise I heap on this wonderful movie, the sad fact of the 
matter is I can't do it justice. You'll have to see it for yourself to fully 
appreciate the film. However, be forewarned, this isn't a movie for 
everyone. "Ninja Scroll" is graphic in both sexual matters and carnage. If 
you don't feel you can handle these elements, steer clear.</P>
<P>Normally I'd devote this paragraph to a critique of the acting, but there 
obviously is none in "Ninja Scroll". Instead, I'm going to briefly discuss a 
few of the characters, and what makes them so interesting. I'll start with 
Jubei, one of the most carefully crafted and interesting action heroes ever 
to grace the screen. Jubei is made so interesting because he isn't exactly 
your classic hero. He's a mercenary ninja, working for the highest bidder. 
Does that mean he has no honor? Quite the opposite actually. Don't get it 
into your mind that Jubei is some invincible, shadowy figure; moving across 
Japan destroying evil with the flick of a wrist. He's good, but he's not 
indestructible. He gets pasted in a few fights, knocked around, bloodied, 
bruised, and occasionally only winning through luck or the intervention of 
someone else. Does this make him less of a hero? No, it makes him more of 
one because it makes him more human. Jubei feels pain and anguish, and he's 
so eloquently crafted that we start to believe he's really feeling these 
emotions and isn't just some animated character. Take, for example, a scene 
in which Jubei is recovering from fighting one of the devils. He is in a 
pond, cleaning his wounds. He pulls a tooth out, washes blood out of his 
mouth, and generally looks a mess. In your typical action film the hero 
takes a beating and is ready to go in five minutes. You never see Hollywood 
action heroes nursing their wounds, because they're invincible.</P>
<P>Kagero, the proud female ninja could easily have been nothing more than a 
caricature, but Kawajiri never allows this to happen. She's brash, 
head-strong, and always seems to have something to prove, but these 
attributes never feel like cliches. They feel more like a shield she puts 
up, and it occasionally breaks down. There's a scene where a massive demon 
of Kimon flings her into a hut, begins to rape her, and is interrupted by 
Jubei. After the rescue, Kagero acts like nothing happened, brushes Jubei 
off, and leaves to continue her mission. Yet once Jubei's back is turned she 
suddenly snaps as the full force of what just happened hits her like a ton 
of bricks. It's a great, moving scene; made even better by the fact that 
even though we've just met her, we already care about Kagero. Finally we 
have Dakuan, the old spy. Dakuan is mainly used for comic relief, but what a 
great comic character he is. I particularly loved a scene where he displays 
his own special ability, and one where Jubei leaves him to search for 
Kagero. He gets a great little speech in the latter about becoming a monster 
to fight one.</P>
<P>Obviously one of the most important elements to a movie like "Ninja Scroll" 
is the animation quality, and I assure you this movie possesses the very 
best. The animation is so crisp, so realistic, that you'll want to re-watch 
it once with the sound off so you can focus entirely on the film's beauty. 
I'm not just talking about how well the characters are drawn either. There 
are scenes where the backgrounds are so well drawn you'd swear this was real 
life. Scenes that stand out in my mind are one where Jubei climbs a cliff to 
get a better look at the area; an early fight on a wooden bridge right 
before a storm; and two characters talking in a marsh, surrounded by 
fireflies. It's too bad animated films can't win awards for cinematography. 
The fights are just as perfectly constructed. There's one at the start of 
the film, between a group of ninja and one of the devil of Kimon where they 
spot him, and fling a horde of throwing stars at him. Kawajiri actually 
shows each individual star slamming into the trees, and each star's strike 
looks different from the others (I know, I sat there and examined them).</P>
<P>So, now that I've raved about it for some time, you're no doubt wondering if 
"Ninja Scroll" is perfect. I'm afraid not, but the only flaw I can think of 
is that it's just a little too short. This causes a few of the scenes to 
feel a bit rushed. For example, a brilliant sword fight in a bamboo forest 
between Jubei and a blind warrior would have been even better if it hadn't 
been only a minute long. Despite that, there are two things which elevate 
"Ninja Scroll" above almost every other animated film I've ever seen. One is 
Kawajiri's attention to detail, the other is his labyrinth of a story. I 
never really took notice of his attention to detail till the last time I saw 
the film and noticed something interesting. In one scene, Jubei's shirt gets 
cut on the sleeve by one of the devils of Kimon. In all future scenes, 
Kawajiri makes certain that cut is always present on the same sleeve, and 
that it's the same size cut. His script is full of surprises, including 
characters dying when you don't expect them to and people turning out not to 
be who you thought they were. The movie runs a quick 94 minutes, and I do 
wish it had been made longer. Oh well, can't have everything. I'd recommend 
"Ninja Scroll" to any fan of anime, but make sure you get an uncut, 
subtitled version (the dubbed version is terrible; Jubei sounds like Captain 
America). I give it a full five out of five stars.</P>
