<P>"I live my life a quarter-mile at a time."</P>
<P>Starring Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez,
Jordana Brewster. Directed by Gary Troudsdale and Kirk
Wise. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>How do I review a movie like The Fast and the Furious?
It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do, which
is provide realistic, exciting car races, chases and
crashes. It does very little more. This presents a
dilemma: do I recommend the film on the basis of that
accomplishment, or do I give it a "thumbs down"
because it accomplishes nothing else? I don't know, so
I'm wimping out and going borderline.</P>
<P>The Fast and the Furious claims to take us inside the
underworld of illegal street racing. Brian (Paul
Walker), is a police officer assigned to expose the
racers and the smuggling ring they might be running
(this is the first movie I've seen where people
actually smuggle DVD players; I'd like to see it in 20
years). Vin Diesel, who came out of nowhere with
Boiler Room last year, plays Dominic, a revered,
respected street lord and racing champion.</P>
<P>Brian has trouble getting in, at first -- Dominic's
cronies start a fight, and he makes a bad impression
on the big guy's sister -- but he enters a race by
betting his new, loaded racecar, loses it, and gains
Dominic's favor. What follows is a predictable battle
of loyalties; will Brian betray Dominic by turning him
in, or will he become a criminal for the sake of his
new friend? We know, of course, that the movie will
somehow find a way to have its cake and eat it, too.</P>
<P>Director Rob Cohen, the Harvard graduate responsible
for The Skulls, last year's worst movie, has made
what's really a niche film (though the current
box-office shows that this is one hell of a niche).
Since it has made so much money, I won't say that it
will only be of interest to certain people, but it
should particularly appeal to car lovers and those who
watch NASCAR in their spare time (I never understood
what was so appealing about watching cars go around in
circles).</P>
<P>Make no mistake, The Fast and the Furious really does
do some neat things with cars. The movie has real
stunts, as opposed to the computer generated crashes
in Renny Harlin's Driven, and the chase and crash
scenes are extraordinarily good-looking. There's
little actual suspense because there's zero interest
in the plot once you get beyond the dubious appeal of
the actors themselves, but the racing -- whee, look
how fast they're going! -- is second to none.</P>
<P>If the filmmakers didn't intend to give up on the
narrative, which it looks like they did, their project
could have benefited from a better leading man; Paul
Walker is such a non-actor that his dull, idiotic
stare is almost funny to watch. Vin Diesel is a
terrific actor in the right role, but this movie
concentrates too much on his noble side and doesn't
let him do what he does best, which is be a badass.</P>
<P>And that's about it. If that doesn't interest you,
don't pay to see this movie. If you do, seek out the
best multiplex in town; I don't understand the
argument that The Fast and the Furious should be seen
at a drive-in with a bad sound system and an
obstructed view, but maybe I'm just too young. This is
a movie to be seen and occasionally heard. If you like
cars, that is. </P>
