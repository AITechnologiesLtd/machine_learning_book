<PRE>The Apostle (1997)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 13 February 1997 for $8.75 with Laura, Rob, and Michelle at the
Loews Village VII</P>
<P>"The hardest soul to save was his own," claims the tagline to *The
Apostle*, and it's true. Robert Duvall gives a towering performance as the
charismatic, convinced, and calculating Euliss "Sonny" Dewey, also known
as The Apostle E.F., accountable only to his Lord, Jesus Christ. Written,
produced, and directed by Duvall, *The Apostle* is a bit of a legend in
independent filmmaking. It's easy to see why. It's all about the deep
conviction held by Pentecostal Christians in the Deep South; in many ways
it's probably best for everyone, especially the audience, that Hollywood
had little or nothing to do with it.</P>
<P>*The Apostle* opens with Sonny visiting a Pentecostal church in 1939 as a
child. Fast-forwarding to today, to an auto accident, Sonny stops his car
and goes to the victim, near death, to bring him a chance of salvation in
Jesus Christ, regardless of the victim's faith. Sonny definitely has a
personal relationship with God, but as a human being, he is flawed. Unlike
many movies that always show preachers as hypocrites, Sonny is a man
driven by true faith, and by his emotions. Just as he rushes to bring
salvation to the unsaved, and to hug parishioners and tell him he loves
them, he also just as quickly cracks the man who cuckolds him with a
little league bat in front of his children, or beat up a racist man who
wants to demolish a church that allows blacks to attend. </P>
<P>Without giving away too much, I can say that *The Apostle* is one of the
most original and different movies I have ever seen. Duvall's performance
dominates the film. As a gay non-observant Jew, it was fascinating to
watch him bring faith to people, while still entertaining his more basic
desires, and being very human. One of the high points of the movie is the
confrontation between Duvall and Billy Bob Thornton. In an era of
skepticism and harshness, it is interesting to see how people need
something to believe it, and the people who bring belief to them. The
subject matter is not approached in a judgmental way either, which makes
it rather original. Religion and faith are commodities usually held up for
ridicule in Hollywood, and hard to understand if you are not particularly
observant.</P>
<P>There are a lot of good actors in *The Apostle* but Duvall pretty much
overshadows them; but this is a necessary evil. *The Apostle* is all about
one man's faith and charisma, and what it can do. Farah Fawcett plays
Sonny's wife Jesse; Miranda Richardson is his newest love interest; June
Carter Cash is Sonny's mother. </P>
<P>Mary Lynette Braxton, Jewell Jernigan, and Zelma Loyd are wonderful as The
Apostle E.F.'s parishioners, and Walt Goggins gives a subtle performance
as Sam. </P>
