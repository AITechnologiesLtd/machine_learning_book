<P>     Before I published my favorable review of Adam Sandler's "The
Waterboy" last fall, I should have heeded the warning Sandler used as
the title for one of his CDs -- "They're All Gonna Laugh At You."</P>
<P>And most of my friends and co-workers did exactly that, dismissing
"Waterboy" sight unseen as one more piece of garbage foisted upon the
screen, sometimes while adding comments such as "Now, 'There's Something
About Mary,' that was a real comedy," or "I'd rather see 'Babe: Pig in
the City'; I've heard that's just phenomenal."</P>
<P>O.K., "The Waterboy" was not a work of art. But it never purported
to be. (And I would rather sit through "Waterboy" 20 times in a row than
have to endure "Pig in the City" even one more time.)</P>
<P>Its sole purpose was to provide 90 minutes worth of jokes, which it
did. And, more often than not, Sandler and co-stars Kathy Bates and
Fairuza Balk hit the target, at least as frequently as Cameron Diaz, Ben
Stiller and Matt Dillon did in "Mary."
 "Big Daddy," Sandler's follow-up, is slightly more ambitious and,
unfortunately, much less successful.</P>
<P>Many comedians, at one point or another in their careers, become
obsessed with proving they can do something other than tickle the
funnybone. Often this leads to artistic disaster -- ever see Bill
Murray's shudder-inducing attempt at "The Razor's Edge"? -- in which
case the joke's on them. The best and worst that can be said about
"Daddy" is that it probably won't do any permanent damage to the careers
of anyone associated with it.</P>
<P>Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, a New Yorker who is living large off a
big insurance settlement, much to the dismay of his girlfriend and dad,
both of whom argue that it's time for the thirtysomething Sonny to
embrace maturity. An opportunity to do just that literally knocks on the
door when Sonny is presented with Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse), the
five-year-old product of his best friend Kevin's (Jon Stewart)
one-night-stand back in 1993. With Kevin conveniently in China for an
extended stay, Sonny seizes the chance to masquerade as his buddy and
adopt Julian, whose mother has conveniently died of a terminal illness.</P>
<P>If you're wondering why Social Services would start drawing up
adoption papers without so much as even asking for ID, or why a dying
woman would send her son to live with a dad he's never even met,
remember that looking for logic in an Adam Sandler movie makes about as
much sense as shopping for a tuxedo in Victoria's Secret.</P>
<P>Sonny's attempts at parenting are occassionally funny -- he has a
multitude of uses for newspaper, for example --  and the bond between
child and child-man is believable. What kindergartner wouldn't be
enamored of a father figure who plays along when the kid puts on
sunglasses he believes make him invisible and whose idea of discipline
is to murmur "go to your room, or do whatever you want"? Sandler and the
Sprouse twins click together, which means that even when the gags
fizzle, the scenes don't collapse.</P>
<P>But when "Daddy" dips into sentiment, it loses its balance.
Director Dennis Dugan ("Problem Child," "Happy Gilmore") doesn't seem to
know if he wants to parody "Kramer vs. Kramer" or remake it, and the
actors seem similarly lost. A climactic courtroom battle is neither
credible nor uproarious, and the movie's cop-out ending is ridiculous
even by Sandler standards.</P>
<P>The elements that make "Daddy" interesting are mostly on its edges.
There's some pleasantly feisty verbal sparring between Kevin's fiancee
Corinne (Leslie Mann) and Sonny over her past as a Hooters waitress, and
a surprisingly tolerant atitude toward Sonny's gay friends who he
accepts unquestioningly by noting "they just watch a different kind of
porno."  In another amusing bit, Sonny and potential new flame Layla
(Joey Lauren Adams) realize they're meant for each other when it's
discovered they share a mutual passion for the music of Styx; their
first kiss is underscored by the swoony "The Best of Times."</P>
<P>There's always an element of danger whenever a performer tries to
do something to broaden his or her audience and if "Daddy" is somewhat
spotty, it's still an admirable attempt by Sandler at something a bit
different. He can take some consolation in the fact that Robin Williams
had to headline plenty of pictures much worse than this before getting
to do "Dead Poets Society," "Awakenings" and "Good Will Hunting."
Patience and practice inevitably pay off.</P>
