<P>First off, I must say that DAZED AND CONFUSED is definitely not my
favorite type of movie.  In fact, the only real reason I saw it was
because of how everyone kept telling me how good it was.  So, I decided to
finally watch it, and I must say that it was actually better than I
thought it would be, but it also could've been better.  </P>
<P>DAZED AND CONFUSED seems to be a type of "hit and miss" in it's portrayal
of the last day of school in a small Texas town in the year 1976.  The
incoming Seniors, now the rulers of the school, inflict the initiation
rituals upon the soon-to-be Freshmen.  For the Senior guys, the hazing is
more physical than that of the Senior girls, who basically humiliate the
younger Freshmen.  The main target of the Senior guys pain-inflicting
services, led mainly by O'Bannion (Ben Affleck), is Mitch (Wiley Wiggins).
Mitch stands up to the hazing as best he can, and proves that he can take
whatever they can dish out.  This proves him well to the Seniors, and he
is invited to "hang out" with them on their night of fun, which includes
drinking, smoking marijuana, fighting, and even more.</P>
<P>Randall "Pink" Floyd (Jason London) is the star quarterback of the high
school's football team.  Basically, all he wants to do is enjoy life over
the Summer.  But, the coach of the football team doesn't want this to be
an option for him or any of the football players, and asks them to
basically sign away their fun in favor of dedicating themselves to the
football team.  Of course, they all blow off this type of dedication and
decide to live it up, especially on the night of the last day of school.</P>
<P>And do they.  Everyone and anyone.  It's a night of fun, in their minds.
One strange thing about the movie is that you really never figure out who
it centers on.  At times, it looks like Randall "Pink" Floyd is the main
character, but then at other instances, it's almost definite that Mitch is
the centerpiece.  In my opinion, I think it is actually both characters
who share the spotlight.  Yet, I feel that the concentration on Mitch is
the best overall.  Here's a young boy, fresh out of junior high and
heading into high school.  After attempting to avoid the hazing of the
Seniors, he shows courage and strength by standing up to them.  Then,
after being accepted into the group, he blends in strikingly well with the
rest of the group.  Very well done, indeed.</P>
<P>For some reason, I really enjoyed the performance of another character in
the movie.  This character, who did not emerge until late in the film, had
a next to meaningless part in the film, yet I found him very likeable.
The character is Wooderson, a high school drop out doing nothing
with his life played very well by Matthew McConaughey.  I guess it was
just something about the character that I liked.  Wooderson, despite his
status, still hangs out with his old high school friends and does whatever
they do.  It was also his character who inspired Mitch to buy his first
six pack of beer, another very good scene.</P>
<P>DAZED AND CONFUSED, which could be argued on its accuracy, seems to be a
very well depicted look into the lives of teenagers of the 70's.  And the
diversity of the teenagers it expands on, from the respected jock to the
pot-head stoner, is extremely unique and well done.  Your interpretation
of this film depends on the way you look at it and the way you look at the
70's, in general.  Many people who experienced this era have said that
this is a very accurate portrayal, but I'm sure there are those who think
just the opposite.  Watch it and judge for yourself.</P>
