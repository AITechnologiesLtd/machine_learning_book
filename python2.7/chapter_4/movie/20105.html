<P>Richard Nixon, America's most controversial president, has been given
the Oliver Stone once-over, and has had Forrest Gump ruin his career,
but he has never been the subject of a comedy...until now. Andrew
Fleming's hilarious "Dick" is the contrived story of Betsy and
Arlene(Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams, respectively), two
dimwitted teenagers living in Washington, D.C. during the tenure of
Richard Nixon(played to comic perfection by character actor Dan
Hedaya). When the two stumble upon the Watergate scandal, the title
character offers them the job of being official White House
dog-walkers and secret youth advisors; but they're not allowed to tell
about anything that they witness while on the job. However, when they
learn that "Dick" is really a racist who hates his dog, they begin to
comply with two Washington Post reporters(Will Ferrell and Bruce
McCulloch) to help rat Nixon out of the presidency. The storyline
requires a suspension of disbelief, but the good acting and good lines
help "Dick" become quite a fun satire. The cast, peppered with SNL
alumni, is excellent, never being too serious or at all
unfunny. "Dick" is a movie about teens that adults will enjoy because
of the 70's nostalgia, and because of the many Watergate jokes that
may fly over the heads of the film's targeted younger audience. It's
too bad that "Dick" didn't rush out of the gate at the box office, but
hopefully it can find its niche through word-of-mouth.  Enjoy it, but
don't take it too seriously.</P>
