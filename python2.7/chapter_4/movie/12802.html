<PRE>.                           THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     I've been a fan of Whit Stillman since his first film, METROPOLITAN, in
1990.  It was therefore with no small amount of anticipation that I
journeyed to see his third film, THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO.</P>
<P>     Of course, when I get worked up over a movie, I'm always disappointed. 
Sadly, DISCO was no exception.</P>
<P>     Once again, Stillman focuses his story on the minutiae of the daily
lives of yuppies (and yuppie wannabes) who are generally unlikable.  This
worked quite well in METROPOLITAN and BARCELONA, mainly because in each of
those pictures there was a central character who defied his surroundings and
managed to break free of the mold, or at least put up a good fight.</P>
<P>     In DISCO there is not.  In fact, in Stillman's third picture, there's
not much holding the characters together at all, outside of a love for disco
music.  Even the most promising characters turn out to be shallow and often
hateful, their stories meander interminably, and there's not even much in
the way of overall plot development, except for the final end of that funky
disco music.</P>
<P>     A lot of DISCO, just like its namesake, is played for the kitsch
factor, and maybe I'm just too young to reminisce about 1980.  The film also
suffers without Stillman-regular Taylor Nichols to save the day (although
Nichols appears, along with a dozen other alumni, in a cameo).</P>
<P>     This isn't to say that the film doesn't have its moments of comedic or
thought-provoking power.  The brightest spot, a deconstructionist look at
LADY AND THE TRAMP (remember THE GRADUATE story in BARCELONA?), is almost
worth the $7.50 it cost to see the film.</P>
<PRE>     But not quite.</PRE>
