<PRE>Review: The Tao Of Steve (2000)</PRE>
<P>THE TAO OF STEVE is a rare treat of a film. Nothing blows up, no one is
killed, nothing dramatic happens and people talk about ideas. It's a
thoughtful film about philosophy and what women want and Steve McQueen.
In the hands of less capable actors and writers,  THE TAO OF STEVE might
have been downright insulting. As it is, it's a refreshing change of
pace with important ideas woven into a witty premise.</P>
<P>Dex is a pudgy kindergarten teacher, former philosophy major genius,
current slacker and babe magnet. He owes his irresistibleness to a
philosophy of `Steveness' -- that is, Steve Austin (THE SIX MILLION
DOLLAR MAN), Steve Garrett (HAWAII FIVE-O) and the Steviest of all --
Steve McQueen (GREAT ESCAPE). These Steves embody the essence of
maleness. Steve is a state of mind, a way of living. The opposite of
Steve is Stu.</P>
<P>There are rules to being a Steve Master: Eliminate your desire for a
woman (she will come begging), be excellent in her presence (prepare
that one mahi mahi recipe you've perfected) and retreat (if you're
attached to nothing, you lose nothing). Living in a mess of a house in
Santa Fe with like-minded men (really frat boys in their 30s) it‘s all
worked for Dex so far.</P>
<P>Until Syd reenters his life. Meeting at their tenth college reunion, Dex
is clearly smitten. And he cannot integrate his ideology with his
feelings. He does not retreat, he is most un-excellent in her presence
(with some genuinely amusing results) and he cannot eliminate his desire
for her. More importantly, he may be in love for the first time.</P>
<P>THE TAO OF STEVE is written by Jennipher Goodman (the director of the
film), her sister Greer (who plays Dex's love interest) and Duncan
North. It is credited as being North's life story, but it is clearly
shaped by the respectful hands of the Goodman women. It is a poignant
look at the battle of the sexes in Millennial America -- only it's not
much  of a battle anymore. Maybe a skirmish. Or a contest. Or a big
flirt dressed up to look like a battle. Dex and Syd's bumpy dance
towards each other is written with such truth and sweetness, both
characters remain likable throughout. Despite the frightening sexist
principles that guide Dex's life, we adore him.</P>
<P>As Dex, Donal Logue is a good-for-nothing charmer. He's always late,
mooches off his friends, smokes pot for breakfast and is philosophically
opposed to the idea of work. But early on, we get to see a glimpse past
the Steve exterior. Dex likens himself to Don Giovanni, who slept with
thousands of women because he was afraid he would never be loved by one.
Logue's performance is breezy and sure-footed. We certainly understand
all the women's attraction for this boy/man even while we enjoy it when
he gets his comeuppance.</P>
<P>THE TAO OF STEVE is very funny, very smart and very thoughtful. It's a
delicious opportunity to think in the movie theatre -- as opposed to the
normal flinch, gasp, gape, and marvel. It's a thinking person's film
about thinking people. They don't come along too often.</P>
