<P>There is one very nice thing in this film, which reminds me of the care that
Akira Kurosawa has in filming his material.  It is the subtle attention to
detail, and the deliberate, and quiet, shooting style.  The camera kind of
poses in one place, and the action slowly develops in front of it, as if we
were hidden in the bushes and caught the sights.</P>
<P>Like many of the films out of China, the most distinctive style in these
films is the design which tends to look very meticulous, with the slow style
of camera movement.  The action in front of us has a look of a direction to
the actors that is carefully detailed and defined.  Somehow, it never hurts
these films. It, instead, enhances the characterizations.</P>
<P>The Scent of the Green Papaya, is the story of a young girl who is hired as
a maid in a reasonably well to do family, in the days of the French
occupation of Vietnam.  The young girl withstands the disrespectful attitude
of the young lad, who chooses every moment he can to do something
inappropriate.  She maintains her work, and does it well, while slowly
learning about the family and its reclusive members.  Grandma has been in
seclusion and prayer since the war days.  The father once in a while
grabs the money from his wife's business and runs off for weeks at a time.
The wife is accused of not being able to love her own man.  In turn, she
suggests that it wasn't her choice to marry him, or vice versa.  One of the
sons is a very good piano player, and is becoming a composer.</P>
<P>And several years go on.  Miu reaches into her later teen years and becomes
the family cook.  She does her work carefully, meticulously, and quietly.
But her mind already has a few hopes and ideas.  She has caught the eye of
the composer, though he is basically involved with a woman from an upper
class family, who doesn't respect the servants, or what they have and
appreciate.</P>
<P>And one day she is seen putting on a dress that makes her look very good,
and attractive.  And she is caught by the composer. And things change.  She
ends up being with the composer, and the story of the film is now ended as a
flashback, to a tale being told to a young one, in the form of poetry, a
reading which inspires the young man to compose more music.</P>
<P>The story is not complicated, and neither is anything about this film, but
the watching of it, makes one wonder in the early stages what is going to
happen.  It is never clear what will happen.  An aging man is still pursuing
the elderly woman in her loneliness.  But the maid, Miu, never loses  sight
of the things she cares about.  She still manages to take care of the
cricket she has kept in a small cage, and fed all along.  Her care is a nice
symbol for her style, and eventually she gets rewarded for it.</P>
<P>Really nice direction, with few wasted shots or fillers at all, this is a
film that also pays much attention to the music and how it fills the space.
At first it is heard as an
echo that runs through the house, the only symbol that this is really one of
the main themes in the story.  But the film does not give it away, and
neither does it suggest that this is one of the main parts.</P>
<P>With some very nice acting, and very carefully designed angles,  this is not
your average film.  It comes off as a study in movement and angle design by
what is a rather confined space for all the action to take place.  The only
changes are a  few new things added here and there as time goes by.</P>
<P>Worth seeing.  Very nice work.  Colorful.</P>
