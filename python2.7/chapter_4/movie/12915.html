<PRE>DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Chris Casino</PRE>
<P>**1/2 out of **** (not up to standards, but has it's moments).</P>
<P>Cast: Leslie Nielsen (Count Dracula), Mel Brooks (Dr. Abarham
Van Helsing), Peter MacNichol (Renfield), Steven Weber (Jonathan
Harker), Harvey Korman (Dr. Arthur Seward), Amy Yasbeck (Mina),
Lysette Anthony (Lucy), Megan Cavanaugh (Chambermaid), Mark
Blankfield (Martin), Ezio Greggio (Coach Driver), Anne
Bancroft (Madam Ouspenskaya).</P>
<P>Crew: Directed by Mel Brooks, Screenplay by Mel Brooks,
Steve Haberman, and Rudy De Luca, from an original
script by Haberman and DeLuca. Produced by Mel Brooks,
Peter Schindler & Robert Latham Brown & Leah Zappy.
Cinematography by Michael D. O'Shea.</P>
<P>What do you get when you team two of the funniest men in
comedy, Mel Brooks and Leslie Nielsen, and have Nielsen
do a takeoff on every classic Dracula film ever made,
with Nielsen parodying Bela Lugosi's Dracula?</P>
<P>A surefire winner like Young Frankenstein? </P>
<PRE>Well, not quite.</PRE>
<PRE>A surefire bomb?</PRE>
<PRE>No, that's not correct, either.</PRE>
<PRE>What is correct is you get something that falls
somewhere in the middle.</PRE>
<P>Nielsen plays the Count, who is visited by lawyer Renfield
(MacNichol who, despite being amusing, is a poor substitute 
for Marty Feldman, who so obviously would've played this role, 
and done better with it, if he were still alive today) about 
leasing Carfax Abby, the house in England the Count wants
to buy. He takes him on as a slave, and they meet
Jonathan Harker (Weber), his wife Mina, who Dracula
bites, Dr. Seward (an amusing Harvey Korman),
and Lucy (Anthony) whom he kills. When Seward
has his nasty suspicions, he calls upon the
vampire expert, Dr. Van Helsing (Brooks. He's
funny, but nowhere near as funny as someone like
Gene Wilder could've been as Van Helsing)
to confront the Count.</P>
<P>This isn't the best film Mel Brooks has made, not even
close. This isn't up to the "loving tribute" style
his other monster parody, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, was--even
though it tries hard to be--and there's a reason for that.</P>
<P>He worked with Gene Wilder on YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN,
and he needed to work with him here too, to make
the film work. If he and Gene Wilder had
collaborated on the script, it might just've worked,
as they work well together. Maybe then, this
would've been in black and white like it should've been.</P>
<P>I also think the cast was wrong. Leslie Nielsen
is one of those comedic actors who's always
funny. Here is no exception, and he does an
excellent Lugosi impression, you can keep him.
Brooks did not act in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN,
which was a wise idea, and he should've done that here
and given the role of Van Helsing to Gene Wilder,
whom I miss seeing on the screen, and also miss
seeing with Brooks. Comedian Mark Blankfield, who works 
for Brooks now, would've been better suited to be Renfield
instead of guard Martin, and I could see Kenneth
Mars of YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN playing Dr. Seward.
Weber is ideal as Harker as is Yasbeck as
Mina. Only then would this film have been
perfect.</P>
<P>I'd tell you to stick to LOVE AT FIRST BITE, which was
very funny, but I prefer parodies that do not trample
on tradition, which this tries not to do and gets
a passing grade for effort on, and that film does not.</P>
