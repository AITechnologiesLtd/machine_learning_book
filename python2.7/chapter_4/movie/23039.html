<PRE>Down To You
A Film Review By Geoff Berkshire</PRE>
<P>Cast: Freddie Prinze Jr., Julia Stiles, Shawn Hatosy, Zak Orth, Selma Blair,
Rosario Dawson, Henry Winkler, Lucie Arnez, Ashton Kutchner
Director: Kris Isacsson</P>
<P>Late in Down To You, the lead female character (Julia Stiles) states her
greatest fear is having an "artificial conversation" with her boyfriend
(Freddie Prinze Jr.).  The irony of this statement will not be lost on audience
members who have not yet walked out, fallen asleep, or otherwise given up on
this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy.  The film is a multi-million dollar
testament to everything artificial.  Filled with characters, motivation, plot
and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable
disaster.</P>
<P>Prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for
Stiles' freshman co-ed.  At first the movie seems to be an attempt to string
along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how "cute" it
can be.  The happy couple "psychoanalyze" each other; they pick out a song
because, as Prinze's DJ mother (Lucie Arnez) explains, every couple needs a
song; he smells her shampoo; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him
know she wants to make love.</P>
<P>Then, in standard romantic comedy style, things fall apart.  Why?  Well,
because they have to.  Otherwise the couple can't make up and live (presumably)
happily ever after.</P>
<P>Down To You exists outside the realm of normal logic.  Scenes do not connect to
each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism, but
this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead. 
A picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre, not only for
the stretched logic of these people hanging out together, or even knowing each
other, but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a
goat.</P>
<P>The supporting characters are remarkably flat, and insultingly ridiculous as
well.  Stiles' best friend (Rosario Dawson) is a pot head, Prinze's roommate
(Shawn Hatosy) is a girl crazy fool who can't meet women, and then there are
the porn stars (Zak Orth and Selma Blair).  He is one of those famous porn
stars who is frequently interviewed on television, does the college lecture
circuit, and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film. 
You know, the average porn star.  The costume epic idea gives him a reason to
appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he's on screen, the porn
angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes.  She is a porn
star mostly so we know she's slutty, so her very existence will make Stiles
jealous and Prinze tempted.</P>
<P>Attempts at drama (which means Julia is going to cry) include a pregnancy scare
and the big break up.  These characters are so insipid only the most forgiving
viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes.</P>
<P>What happened here?  The cast is full of likable, promising, young actors
(Stiles especially seems to be going places).  Writer/director Kris Isacsson
has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it
off.  In fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year's extremely
unpleasant The Story of Us, for teen audiences.</P>
<P>The direction is film-school-grad obvious.  It's stylish in a hugely self
conscious way which throws in split screen, a pointless parody of "Cops,"
characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters, and a hilariously
cheesy airport meeting between Prinze and Stiles where all the extras move in
fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion.  Plus, the whole
story is told flashback style, narrated by Prinze and Stiles directly
addressing the camera.</P>
<P>This is the second film in a row (following Wing Commander) starring Freddie
Prinze Jr. which should have premiered on the aisles of the local Blockbuster
but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of She's All That.
 If he doesn't start making better choices fast his future films won't be so
lucky.</P>
