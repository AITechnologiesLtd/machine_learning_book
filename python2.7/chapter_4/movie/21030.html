<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Welcome to January – the month of movie hell.  One needs to only look
back to past Januarys to see that studios dump crappy projects onto the
unsuspecting audience faster than Kirstie Alley can pound tequila
shooters.  Fierce Creatures, Zeus & Roxanne, Turbulence, Bio-Dome, Eye
for an Eye, The Relic , Bed Of Roses  Bleah!  Chalk Deep Rising up to
the list of shame.</P>
<P>The way that I see it, if you're going to rip off another film, you
might as well make it a good one.  Deep Rising is a offensive
combination of bad Anaconda and a worse Event Horizon.  Its story is
unimaginative and the acting is even worse.  Treat Williams is making a
late charge for the elusive `Worst Actor Of The Decade' title.  Too bad,
Keanu got such a big jump on him.</P>
<P>The story begins on the super-luxury liner `The Argonautica', where the
rich dine and gamble until something knocks it all to hell.  Then, we
cut to a rag-tag bunch on a smaller boat.  The leader is John Finnegan
(Williams) and he and his hapless crew are apparently chartering their
boat to a group of missile-toting thugs.  They break down and seek
refuge on `The Argonautica'.</P>
<P>But, wait…the giant boat is empty, and thus the endless tirade of
cliches and unoriginal situations begin.  Finnegan even utters the line
`I've got a really bad feeling about this…'.  So do I, pal.  So do I.</P>
<P>At one point, Finnegan rescues the stock female off of `The Argonautica'
and leads her to his boat to make the big getaway and she utters `That
heap of junk is your ship?'.  Well tape some cinnamon buns to her head
and call me a Wookie.  Finnegan also pilfers the line `Now there's
something you don't see everyday' from ConAir.  And it's not even a
great line.</P>
<P>There are a few good gory scenes and Finnegan's Shaggy-like sidekick
provides adequate comic moments, but it still stinks.  Director Stephen
Sommers, whose previous credits include both Tom & Huck and The
Adventures of Huck Finn, may or may not have been alive during
production.  He has been tagged to helm The Mummy from the Anne Rice
novel.  If she made such a big stink about Tom Cruise playing Lestat,
she'll drop dead over this.</P>
