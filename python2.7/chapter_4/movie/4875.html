<P>     Distilled to its purest essence, CADILLAC RANCH is a traditional 
road picture featuring female characters -- a kinder, gentler THELMA AND 
LOUISE.  All the conventions of the genre are present, from the wild car 
chases to the protagonists' bonding.  There's a robbery, a murder, a 
romance, a wedding, and a bag of money at the end of the rainbow.  What 
makes it all worthwhile is not that Jennifer Cecil's script is a marvel 
of originality, but that the three main characters are fun, likable gals 
who make the whole 100-minute adventure entertaining.</P>
<P>     CJ (Suzy Amis) is the oldest of the three Crowley sisters.  22 
years ago, when the girls' father vanished from their lives, CJ was 
charged with caring for her siblings.  Ultimately, the pressure was too 
much for her, and she slipped over to the "wrong side of the tracks", 
making a local jail her second home.  Frances (Linden Ashby), the middle 
sister, is a sour brunette who remembers her father with bitterness, and 
whose attitude towards CJ isn't any more forgiving.  Finally, there's 
Mary Katherine (Renee Humphrey), the youngest, who's trying to reunite 
her whole family for her upcoming nuptials. </P>
<P>     Together, the three sisters embark on a cross-Texas journey to the 
Cadillac Ranch, where ten old cars are half-buried nose-down in the 
ground.  There, according to a letter CJ recently received, their father 
has hidden "his treasure" for them to find.  Of course, the Crowley 
sisters aren't the only ones headed in that direction.  On their trail 
are two men with vastly different motives:  Wood (Christopher Lloyd), a 
sadistic killer who wants the treasure, and Beau (James Metzler), a too-
good-to-be-true hunk who falls for Frances.  </P>
<P>     There's nothing particularly deep or challenging about CADILLAC 
RANCH, but the simple story supports three solid characters and a dose 
of effective humor.  While CJ, Frances, and Mary Katherine aren't the 
best-developed trio of women to take off in a car, each has a little 
more going for her than a typical stereotype, and the psychology of 
their relationships with each other and with their father gives CADILLAC 
RANCH an edge.  When the drama works, it does so because the characters 
seem real.</P>
<P>     CADILLAC RANCH is beautifully photographed, but it isn't an acting 
clinic.  Of the three principals, Suzy Amis is the best.  Linden Ashby 
is sporadically effective, and Renee Humphrey tends to be a little too 
perky for her own good.  Christopher Lloyd plays the bad guy with 
cartoonish gusto, and James Metzler is suitably heroic as "every girl's 
fantasy man." (Those are the director's words, not mine.)  Ultimately, 
however, CADILLAC RANCH doesn't need Oscar-caliber performances.  Even 
though they're only portrayed adequately, CJ, Frances, and Mary 
Katherine still make enjoyable road companions.</P>
