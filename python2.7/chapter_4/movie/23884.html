<P>IN SHORT: Jackson and Jones starpower saves a lackluster script.</P>
<P>We begin with a mob of Arab natives cursing at, throwing rocks and
shooting rifles at, the American Embassy in Yemen. A team of Marines is
sent in to reinforce the security at the Embassy and, depending on how
bad the situation gets, safely evacuate the personnel if necessary.
Ambassador Mourain (Ben Kingsley), by the time 32 year veteran Colonel
Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) gets there, is hiding under his desk.
His wife (Anne Archer) and child are terrified. Colonel Childers does
his job, evacuates the embassy and sees three of his men die from sniper
fire and gunshots from the crowd. Having been fired upon, he orders
return fire, and 83 people are killed. The world's press (that includes
domestic) are outraged! National Security Advisor William Sokal (Bruce
Greenwood) decides that not prosecuting the Colonel would be akin to a
cover-up, and orders the Corps to put the vet out to hang. This, despite
the fact that the NSA is in possession of a videotape from the Embassy
security system, clearly showing women and children in the crowd firing
upon the Embassy.</P>
<P>Gee whillickers, ladies and gents! A movie with something to piss off
both Conservatives ("dee-FENSE! dee-FENSE") and whiny Liberals
("government conspiracy!") . . . and there's more blatant manipulative
stuff in what passes for a script based upon a story by former Secretary
of the Navy James Webb, but I'll leave that be. You'll catch it
immediately. Director William Friedkin trowels it on top of a pair of
combat sequences (one in Vietnam, the other the riot in Yemen) which set
up everything that scriptwriter Stephen Gaghan decides not to bother
with.</P>
<P>With eight day to muster up a defense, one colonel calls on another,
Hays Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) whom he had saved in Vietnam and who has
lived out his days in the corps as a self-admitted bad lawyer. Simply
put, Good Soldier. Self-admitted Bad Lawyer. Evil Government Stooge
withholding evidence. Do I believe any of it?</P>
<PRE>Hell no.</PRE>
<PRE>Does it matter?</PRE>
<P>Hell no. 'cuz we all have that little switch inside our heads that can
lock out everything that would piss us off 'cuz the star performances
are so much damned fun to watch. Sure, it would be nice if we got to see
a little more background on both men -- everything we need to know is
found in expository dialog. And it would have been nice if the film
didn't offer up a nod to Fight Club as a way of showing the deep
friendship between these men. We know from their previous screen
characters that Samuel L. Jackson plays the man against the system very
well, just as we know that Tommy Lee Jones is Crankier than I. Both of
'em generate such electricity on the screen (and we're talking the
inevitable trial that ends the movie. We've already pointed out that
major character development in their parts just doesn't exist) that
Rules of Engagement is a fun flick to watch.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Rules of Engagement, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$5.00</PRE>
<P>Absolute Star Power rules in this one. There's so little story
development here that, with lesser actors, Rules of Engagement would've
gone down in flames. There was a Gulf War vet sitting behind me -- who
wouldn't keep his mouth shut as he commented on the military sequences
-- who called the whole thing "stupid" when the final credits rolled.
But did he "hate the flick," I asked? Hell no.</P>
<P>Simply, buy the big popcorn and check your logic circuits at the door.</P>
