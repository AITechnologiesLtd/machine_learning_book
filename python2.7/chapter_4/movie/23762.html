<P>The Road to El Dorado (2000) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Featuring the vocal
talents of Kenneth Branagh, Kevin Kline, Rosie Perez, Armand Assante and
Edward James Olmos.</P>
<P>"The Road to El Dorado" is a bumpy one, filled with potholes and ruts.</P>
<P> DreamWorks latest animation offering is pale and a tad old-fashioned
especially in lieu of the advances showcased in rival Disney's "Tarzan"
of last summer.</P>
<P> It also is disappointing coming on the heels of DreamWorks magnificent
"Prince of Egypt," which was a splendid mixture of animation, story and
song.</P>
<P> But "El Dorado's" main problem is in the screenplay. Any story set in
1519 that uses the common vernacular and contemporary jargon is a victim
of lazy writing.</P>
<P> Perhaps it was done purposely for the young children who are the
movie's target audience. But hearing one Spaniard say to his amigo, `I
want in on the scam,' rings false.</P>
<P> "The Road to El Dorado" seems to have been inspired by the old Bob
Hope-Bing Crosby-Dorothy Lamour series of the 1940s and ‘50s, in which
the intrepid trio visited such exotic places as Zanzibar, Morocco,
Singapore, Utopia, Rio, Bali and Hong Kong.</P>
<P> At least those movies had some wit and style, most supplied by Hope and
Crosby's ad-libs.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for "El Dorado." The film seems
to meander along at a pleasant pace. </P>
<P> Even the vocal talent cannot elevate this substandard production. </P>
<P> Kevin Kline is Tulio and Kenneth Branagh is Miguel, two lowlifes who
accidentally wind up on a ship heading for the New World. Miguel has won
a map in a crooked dice game showing the way to the fabled gold city of
El Dorado.</P>
<P> Arriving in the New World, the two set out to find the city, which is
rather easily accomplished.</P>
<P> Along the way they save Chel (Rosie Perez), an Indian maiden, and show
up the evil medicine man, Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante).</P>
<P> Unlike the Hope-Crosby tandem in which Bing was the brains while Bob
was usually the cowardly victim, there seems to be no clear delineation
between Tulio and Miguel. Only Miguel's blonde hair differentiates them.</P>
<P> Perez, unfortunately, is totally miscast. You can take the girl out of
Brooklyn, but you can't take the Brooklyn out of the girl. Every word
she utters shatters the illusion the filmmakers are striving to create.</P>
<P> The songs by Elton John and Tim Rice also are unremarkable, nowhere
near their compositions that helped make "The Lion King" such a success.</P>
<P> Overall, "The Road to El Dorado" will satisfy the very young and
undemanding in the audiences. The older youngsters and adults may find
this adventure a bit of a bore.</P>
<P> A lot of roadwork is needed to successfully pave the way to this "El
Dorado."</P>
