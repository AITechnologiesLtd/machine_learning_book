<P>     Anyone following the behind-the-scenes history of EVEN COWGIRLS GET 
THE BLUES knew that the film was in trouble long before its release.  
Following a negative reaction at last year's Toronto Film Festival, 
director Gus Van Sant (DRUG STORE COWBOY, MY PRIVATE IDAHO) went back to 
the editing room to recut the picture, hoping to supply more life and 
coherency than was evident his first take.  It didn't work.  EVEN 
COWGIRLS is as close to an unwatchable film as there is available at this 
time in the theaters. </P>
<P>     Perhaps I might be more sympathetic had I read Tom Robbins' 1976 
book - the "first hippie novel", as Van Sant calls it - but I haven't, so 
I'll leave the comparisons to someone else.  Whether or not this is the 
90s version of BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES remains to be seen, although 
cinematically, it's certainly on the same level. </P>
<P>     Uma Thurman plays Sissy Hankshaw, a loopy drifter who hitchhikes her 
way across the country from adventure to adventure.  A letter from her 
old friend the Countess (played by a cross-dressing John Hurt) summons 
her to New York, where she meets with an asthmatic artist (Keanu Reeves) 
and is offered a job doing an ad campaign for the Countess' midwestern 
ranch - which is really a fat farm/beauty spa.  Once she arrives in 
Oregon, however, the cowgirl workers, led by Bonanza Jellybean (Rain 
Phoenix) stage a coup and take over the property, running the Countess 
and her rich clients out.  This provokes an armed federal response, and 
one of the most laughably idiotic denouements in recent film history. </P>
<PRE>     Where to begin... </PRE>
<P>     Even if the plot made sense (which it really doesn't) and wasn't 
unbelievably contrived (which it is), EVEN COWGIRLS is difficult to 
follow because of its disjointed nature.  Whether this is a result of 
poor editing, confused writing, or (most likely) a combination of the 
two, the result is obvious - a chaotic motion picture that never finds 
its focus and is agonizing to sit through. </P>
<P>     Sissy, the main character, is bland, although through no fault of 
Uma Thurman, whose performance is reasonably restrained in the midst of a 
festival of scenery-chomping.  The problem with Sissy is that Van Sant 
never forges a connection between her and the audience.  There is no 
emotional link, and the viewer isn't likely to care any more about her at 
the end than at the beginning.   </P>
<P>     With the notable exception of that given by Thurman, the 
performances are awful.  Lorraine Bracco (who I don't consider to be a 
good actor) and John Hurt (who I do) go so far over the top that you 
wonder if they'll ever reach bottom.  Rain Phoenix (the sister of the 
late River Phoenix, to whom this film is dedicated) isn't much better, 
probably because she doesn't know how to act. </P>
<P>     The dialogue, especially the Tom Robbins-supplied voiceovers, is 
grating.  There's too much pretension and posturing here, and a typical 
conversation consists of characters trying to one-up each other in the 
number of meaningless profundities they can spew out.  This is probably 
supposed to make the viewer ponder; amidst all the other garbage that 
comprises EVEN COWGIRLS, it just made me reel. </P>
<P>     The themes presented by the movie - feminism and the rights of the 
individual - have a heavy 70s flavor that Van Sant has done nothing to 
update.  In a rare case of getting something right, at least EVEN 
COWGIRLS gives a natural, non-exploitative view of lesbian love.   </P>
<P>     Then there are Sissy's thumbs.  Supposedly incredibly long and 
supple, these represent a botch-up by the prosthetics and make-up 
department.  Every time Sissy sticks out these monstrosities to hitch a 
ride, the viewer's eyes are glued to them - not because of some inner 
desire to gape at the deformity, but because they look so fake.  </P>
<P>     Further rumination on EVEN COWGIRLS is probably as pointless as the 
film itself.  The only possible reason to see it is to experience 
firsthand how badly a moderately-budgeted art film can go wrong.  In some 
sense, it's hard to believe that this much talent can produce something 
so worthless.  That's enough to give anyone the blues. </P>
