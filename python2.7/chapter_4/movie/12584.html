<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>Suicide Kings is an entertaining, gritty crime movie about a bunch of
rich kids who kidnap a powerful mobster.  It features a lot of colorful
characters, buckets of expletives, pointless scenes that are included
strictly for entertainment value, and numerous moments of intense
graphic violence.  It's not profound or deep, or even that original, but
director Peter O'Fallon and his talented cast force the standard
material into a sly and elusively clever film that will placate even the
most picky Quentin Tarantino fans.</P>
<P>The film centers around four guys somewhere in their twenties:  Brett
(Jay Mohr), Avery (Henry Thomas), T.K. (Jeremy Sisto), and Max (Sean
Patrick Flanery).  We learn that Avery's sister, Lisa (Laura Harris),
has been kidnapped, and that the kidnappers are demanding two million
dollars.  Their plan is to kidnap Charlie Bennett (Christopher Walken),
and get the money that way.  They hold Charlie hostage in the home of
their friend Ira (Johnny Galecki), whose parents are out of town; Ira
gets very upset because everyone is drinking his parents' booze and
dropping priceless antiques on the floor.</P>
<P>What makes a film like this good are the characters and the acting. 
Walken is, of course, fantastically fun to watch as the mob guy who has
softened a bit in his later years.  Walken is a veteran actor who can
get away with playing himself, but he also manages to alter little
aspects of his personality each time to make all of his performances
subtly different.  Also great is Denis Leary, who is another actor who
usually plays himself.  Here, he's a superviolent hitman for Charlie;
he's the kind of guy who will shoot two thugs without flinching, but
decides on a whim to hand five hundred dollars to a homeless guy who
tries to wash the windows of his car.</P>
<P>I was also impressed with all of the younger actors.  Jay Mohr is doing
an excellent job of proving his worth as an actor, for I can't think of
a young performer who has more flair and presence as this guy.  Henry
Thomas (yes, the same Henry Thomas from E.T.) is quiet and brooding, and
handles a lot of the scenes here very well.   Sean Patrick Flanery
(Powder) is adequately interesting, as is Jeremy Sisto (who was great as
the psycho in Hideaway).  The one exception is Johnny Galecki; it's not
completely his fault, for I'm sure Ira is supposed to be an irritating
character.  But he's also supposed to be funny, and I didn't find him
particularly funny.  That's okay -- there are plenty of other characters
to divert my attention.  Not all of these characters are totally
developed, but there are a lot of them and they're interesting enough
that a little bit of missed development is hardly noticeable.</P>
<P>The film, because of the sharp dialogue and O'Fallon's eclectic
direction, moves swiftly and easily to its conclusion; the pace is
certain and the story never feels forced.  It seems to me that films
like this should be more common, but they aren't -- not good ones, at
least.  Certainly Suicide Kings is not as original or ingeniously
conceived as a film like Pulp Fiction, but there is enough talent at
work here to make it a ridiculously entertaining two hours.</P>
