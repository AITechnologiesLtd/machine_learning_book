<PRE>                                    RAPA NUI
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<PRE>Dir: Kevin Reynolds
Starring: Jason Scott Lee, Esai Morales, Sandrine Holt
Produced by Kevin Costner</PRE>
<P>     The premise for RAPA NUI is a promising one.  Easter Island (known
to the natives as Rapa Nui) is a microcosm society on the verge of
apocalypse.  The last of their forest is in peril of being cut down.
Overpopulation means more work for less food.  The failure of the local
gods to provide has forced a religious crisis.  But the premise put
forth in the tightly edited and lushly scenic trailer is not what
Costner's Tig Productions delivered.  What is on the screen is instead
ROCKY in a hula skirt, or KARATE KID goes coconuts.  It is a big
sporting event competition film.  The sport in this case is,
appropriately enough, an Easter egg hunt.</P>
<P>     The first sign of trouble is the first scene.  The local chief,
called "Birdman" points to a rotting corpse and bemoans the fact that
he has nobody to swim for his clan's team in this year's event.  The
painful and painfully slow machinations around the egg hunt swim fill
up much of the multi-pronged plot.  The rest concerns a group of
neo-Marxist stone cutters called the "Short Ears."  The utterly
simplistic class conflict between the "Long Ears" (the haves) and the
"Short Ears" (the have-nots) takes the place of any development of
threads of religion, culture, ethnography, or tribal ritual.</P>
<P>     Not much is known of true Rapa Nuian practices, but instead of an
informative film based on similar cultures, writer director Reynolds
(with the assistance of co-writer Tim Rose Price) make the worst paint
by numbers coloring book level fable.  Esai Morales, a fine Hispanic
actor (BAD BOYS) is totally miscast as the Marxist-atheist rabble
rouser who spouts on about religion being the distractor of the masses
as if a premature copy of "The Communist Manifesto" had washed up on
the beach.  Other dialogue ranges from incredibly modern, to
stultifying inane.  Birdman extols at one point to his Basil
Rathbone-esque aide "I don't have time for this now, Priest.  I have
entrails to read." Birdman then stands by while the lowly Short Ears
confront him with their list of labor disputes, which is then repeated
endlessly throughout the film in case anybody missed that it was plot
development time.</P>
<P>     Another major disappointment is the quick way in which the carving
of the stone monoliths is glossed over.  People seem busy, but we never
really see how they are carved.  Instead, the scene plays like bad out
takes from the pyramid scene in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.  All of the epic
crowd scenes all resemble a bunch of disoriented people being told by
somebody off-camera to "now look busy."</P>
<P>     While I am cataloging the failures in this dismal failure of a
film, let me also add that the love story, the one element you can
always count on in a South Sea Island film, is also mishandles
completely, with the third-billed Sandrine Holt hardly being in the
film at all.  Her story, is the most ludicrous.</P>
<P>     I had read complaints about the cross racial casting and was
willing to dismiss them as another case a PCism, but the casting of
American accented leads and Aussie accented minor characters, with
whites in heavy make-up as extras, blew away any remaining sense of
credibility this well intentioned misfire might have had.</P>
<P>     Kevin Costner produced but does not appear in this New Agey tale
of native life.  During the requisite Island Festival scene I thought a
better title for this farango might have been DANCES WITHOUT WOLVES.</P>
<P>     On a serious note, people interested in the topic of Pacific
island life would do better to rent F. W. Murnau's TABU or trying to
seek out John Ford's impressive THE HURRICANE.  Other hard to find gems
include WHITE SHADOWS IN THE SOUTH SEAS and THE PAGAN, both directed by
W. S. van Dyke.  A little further East and into Thailand, CHANG from
the directors of King (Cooper and Shoedsack), still ranks as one of the
finest ethnographic films ever made.</P>
