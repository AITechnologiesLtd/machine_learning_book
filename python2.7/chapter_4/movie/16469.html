<P>   You can bet that the consensus of critics on this one will be
that "She's All That" has its moments of hilarity and charm
but that at base it's as formulaic as a can of Gerber's baby
food.  Given the amount of money that Hollywood throws at
its writers and directors for plots that will generate lines at the
box office, why should this be so?  Could it be that the public
actually prefers the a+b=c predictability found so often in
each genre?  Absolutely, according to a new book by Neil
Gabler called "Life the Movie."  Gabler argues early on that
"entertainment is constantly searching for a combination of
elements that has predictably aroused a given response in
the past, on the assumption that the same combination will
more than likely arouse the same response again."  Maybe
this explains the often-held notion that critics are different
from normal people.  Professional reviewers tend to prefer
art, which is thought of as inventional (creative), while
entertainment is considered conventional (formulaic). 
Whether you're a authority on the movies and consider
yourself a person of uncommon taste or more the hang-loose
kind of guy who just wants to have fun, you'll find "She's All
That" mildly diverting while you'll not likely be shocked by
anything resembling a surprise or a plot twist.</P>
<P>   Like other movies about high-school kids (Steve Rash's
1987 "Can't Buy Me Love" about a nerdy kid who pays a
senior heartthrob $1,000 to pose as his girlfriend; Jim
Gillespie's "I Know What You Did Last Summer" about a
group of teens who accidentally run down a pedestrian and
throw his body into the sea), "She's All That" stars attractive
people who are years older than the characters they portray. 
Chief among these is Freddie Prinze, Jr., now 23 years old,
in the role of a graduating senior who--like Professor Henry
Higgins of G.B. Shaw's "Pygmalion"--makes a bet that he can
turn a dorky female into a woman of class.  It's a fascinating
theme, so much so that it has been played in various
versions since the Greeks uncovered it a couple of millennia
back.  That its conclusion is a forgone conclusion is
unimportant: after all its predictably did not hurt its appeal in
America's greatest Broadway musical, "My Fair Lady."  We
are entertained or not by how much fun we have watching its
principal head toward his goal, and for the most part we're
satisfied that director Robert Iscove brings his cast
occasionally into high gear with the material that writer R. Lee
Fleming Jr. has given him.  </P>
<P>   What Zack Siler (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), Laney Boggs
(Rachael Leigh Cook), Dean Sampson (Paul Walker) and
Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) do supply is a quartet of
good, solid bodies and clearly differentiated personalities. 
The plot, which probably bores the cast as much as it is
irrelevant to us, consists of a bet that Zack's buddy Dean
makes that Zack cannot transform a dorky girl into a prom
queen.  Zack fixes his eye on Laney, an introverted senior
who spends her free time painting in the basement of her
comfortable Southern California home and prepares to work
his wiles.  Zack's initial manipulation is to ask Laney whether
she wears her glasses all the time.  Now a true feminist
would see red through her black-framed spectacles, but
Laney--who will not wear contact lenses--promptly removes
them and never looks back, while a classmate gives her a
thorough makeover.  In a single session she is transformed
into a looker ready to turn heads.  But this is fantasy.  Like
Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady," Laney looks darn good
right from the first, her makeover hardly likely to change her
wallflower personality.</P>
<P>    The best scene, surprisingly, revolves around Laney's dad,
who is called Dr. Pool (Kevin Pollak) because his trade is the
renovation of the Southern Cal. natatoria.  The sort of
understanding fellow that everyone would love to have as a
papa, he puts only the mildest of pressures on his daughter
to get her out of her shell and while watching Jeopardy
comes out with the best lines in the movie.  For example,
when the question deals with who printed the most famous
Bible ever, he responds, "Hewlett Packard" (the answer is
Gutenberg) and he confidently replies "Paris, France" when
the answer to a query is "New Orleans, Louisiana."</P>
<P>   This is quite a high school, the sort of place one hates to
leave, so that it's no wonder that the kids are more anxious
than gratified to realize that in a few weeks they'll be out in
the real world.  Everyone is attractive, each group has talents
of a professional caliber.  The campus d.j. (Usher Raymond)
supplies patter to the halls, imparting new fun to changing
classes, while he supplies a bevy of recorded songs to the
senior prom calculated to get the kids on their feet.  The title
comes from a rap song delivered with virtuoso zeal by a trio
of students.  The movie is hardly an Oscar contender but is
fast-moving with live-wire dialogue spoken by articulate kids.</P>
