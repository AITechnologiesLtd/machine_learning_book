<P>   One of the New Yorker magazine's typically unfunny
cartoons last year displayed a patient sitting in his undershirt
across from his doctor, who told the poor man, "There's not
only no cure for your disease, Wilson.  There's not even a
race for the cure!"  No one can accuse the physician of
violating a prohibition against lying.  He told the absolute
truth.  But in this case is that a good idea?  Is it even the
ethical way to deal with the anxious fellow?  The answer to
both queries is no.  By giving the patient no hope at all, the
doc is probably driving him to an even earlier grave, to say
nothing of the making the rest of his attenuated life that much
more miserable.</P>
<P>   There are times that telling an untruth is not only desirable
but necessary, particularly in a grim situation that could
actually lead despondent people to suicide. Such a
circumstance existed on a large scale during World War 2 as
Jews were systematically rounded up by special German
units with the help of their international sympathizers, forced
to remain inside their ghettoes, i.e. particular Jewish
neighborhoods, and ultimately rounded up and sent to death
camps.  While many of the doomed people tried to make a
go of things, others gave up all belief in deliverance, some
going so far as to hang themselves.  "Jakob the Liar," whose
ideas are taken partly from a German production company's
1974 "Jakob der Lugner" which in turn came from a novel by
Jurek Becker, demonstrates the mixed success of lying when
the tactic is used to give hope to despairing Jews living in a
well-guarded Polish ghetto.</P>
<P>   Like Robert Benigni's "Life is Beautiful," Peter Kassovitz's
"Jakob the Liar" is serio-comic.  While "Jakob" is not so
schematically divided into a comic first part and a latter half
that seems to come from a different picture, Kassovitz
maintains a light tone in the earlier scenes, shifting to a
somber mood as the 114-minute film gathers momentum.  As
the title character, Robin Williams sets the tone by imparting
a particularly self-deprecatory bit of Jewish humor in his
opening narration.  A Jewish man who is not particularly liked
by his neighbors asks one known to foretell the future, "When
will I die?"  "I don't know," replies the prescient one, "But you
will die on a Jewish holiday."  "How do you know this?
queries the anxious man.  "Because," his adviser tells him,
"Any day that you die will be a Jewish holiday."  We come to
understand early on that this is the form of malign humor that
has enabled Jews to carry on despite centuries, even
millennia, of persecution.  </P>
<P>   In this wartime situation, as several hundred people in a
Polish town wait and work under Nazi guard until their
inevitable call to the train and to a death camp, suicides are
rampant.  Jakob hits upon an idea as he overhears a radio
broadcast in the Gestapo's office.  Though the censored
German news indicates Nazi victories over their Red Army
foes, Jakob will turn the truth upside down and tell his
neighbors that he has a hidden radio which has broadcast
that the Russian troops are a mere 400 km from the camp
and that all will be saved in a matter of weeks.  Since
possession of a radio means instant execution for its bearer,
Jakob, though not even in possession of one, faces tragedy
should the guards merely think the radio exists.</P>
<P>   The major thrust of the film is the reaction of various
people in the ghetto.  On one side, the cynical
Shakespearean actor Frankfurter (Alan Arkin) pooh-poohs all
thoughts of salvation and wonders whether Jakob has a radio
at all.  On the other side are people like the barber Kowalsky
(Bob Balaban), saved from hanging himself when Jakob
happens upon his shop, who is now filled with hope.  Indeed
the entire ghetto has not filed a single suicide report since
Jakob--and soon thereafter the grapevine throughout the
camp--report stories of successful Russian advances.</P>
<P>   Though a 10-year-old child, Lina (Hannah Taylor Gordon),
perhaps newly orphaned, is introduced to the audience early
on, Kassovitz avoids mining a situation that could have
turned the film maudlin.  To the credit of this director,
Kassovitz manages to restrain the entire troupe save one
man, a prizefighter, and even Robin Williams conveys a
somber, albeit tentatively comic, image.  </P>
<P>   But although Luciana Arrighi's production design conveys
the utter dilapidation of the Jewish living quarters and Edward
Shearmur's musical score hints a klezmer-inspired
combination of joy and foreboding, the claustrophobic nature
of the film makes "Jakob the Liar" look more like a staged
play than an openly cinematic experience.  Given the
exaggerated gestures of some actors--the Germans opening
their eyes wide when surprised and former boxer Mischa's
(Liev Schreiber) running frantically around the neighborhood
like a clown--this production might well have worked better on
a Broadway stage.  As captured on Polish and Hungarian
locations by cameraman Elemer Ragalyi, however, "Jakob
the Liar" is too closed off to provide sufficient air for its
deprecating humor (jokes, such as they are, fall flat), and the
relentless struggle by the hapless people to survive is not
adequately transmitted.</P>
