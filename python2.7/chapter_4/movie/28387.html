<PRE>                             WAYNE'S WORLD
                     A film review by Rachel Gordon

<P>Sometimes, no matter how much you love analyzing and breaking down
movies, you have to understand that some are just made for fun.  Wayne's
World is a prime example.  Sure, you can predict everything that's going
to happen, but the characters are entertaining and it's a fairly decent
mix of physical and verbal comedy.  Of course, who can forget the
variety of endings they invented and the moments of dialogue that still
pop up today, such as, "Shaw... and monkeys might fly out of my butt!"</P>
<P>The most memorable television I watched in my teens consisted primarily
of those "not ready for prime time players" at Saturday Night Live. 
They had cutting edge music and hosts who could act.  Not to mention
they had talented writers, including Michael Myers and Dana Carvey. 
Carvey had the Church Lady and Myers had Dieter and Simon.  And when
they worked together to produce the Wayne's World sketch, I never
thought I'd love a pair of naïve losers more.</P>
<P>This sketch, surprising, turned into a successful feature film.  After
all, adults who don't want to grow up can only be interesting and fun
for a certain amount of time... say five minutes.  But a full 90? 
Carvey had participated in a few failed attempts (not really his fault,
poorly written material) like Opportunity Knocks and Myers was pretty
much getting his start with this film.  The last time Lorne Michaels had
produced a successful film based off an SNL sketch was with The Blues
Brothers, 12 years previously.</P>
<P>To top it off, Wayne's World was directed by Penelope Spheeris, who was
infamous by that point for her classic observation of punk rock artists
in Decline of Western Civilization (over ten years previously to the
making of this film).  Asking a director to switch from this documentary
style to a comedy about two innocents in the Midwest with a cable access
show was quite a leap of faith.</P>
<P>Despite these reasons for reservations, Wayne's World was far from
disappointing.  Is it an important movie to see?  Heck no, but if you
want something to watch on a rainy afternoon that will lighten your
mood, this should do the trick.  It's unclear how much creative input
Spheeris had in the final product as the two stars of the film had also
created the characters, but there are signs that this was an enjoyable
team effort.  For instance, the conversations that Wayne and Garth have
directly with the camera are actually engaging.  This device is normally
annoying, but Spheeris has done this before and has an eye for
concentrating on subjects one by one.</P>
<P>Films about small-timers who suddenly make their dent in society and
receive instant fortune only to realize they rather appreciate their
simple lives are a dime a dozen in Hollywood.  The trick with Wayne's
World that seems to cross age and gender in terms of enjoyment is that
the characters are endearing.  They lead humdrum lives, but they enjoy
them enough that it's interesting to watch them from one scene to the
next.</P>
<P>Wayne (Myers) is the leader of the pair.  He makes all the decisions
about where the show goes, drives the car when they hang out, and gets
the best wise cracks.  The show is also named after him.  He's not the
most attractive or intelligent of men, but he is charismatic and knows
how to enjoy himself.</P>
<P>Garth (Carvey), his sidekick and best pal, keeps his mouth shut most of
the time while he fantasizes about "Dream Girl" (Donna Dixon) in the
donut shop.  He allows himself to be led around by Wayne, including
during their show, but he does get to reach his own shining moment when
left to go his own way as success has spoiled and separated them,
courtesy of smarmy television producer Benjamin (Rob Lowe).</P>
<P>Spheeris may not be the best female director Hollywood has to offer.  It
seems that she will do films like Wayne's World for the sheer value of a
paycheck so she can concentrate on other observational material when she
has saved her pennies.  And I don't begrudge her this possible
tendency.  I'd probably do it myself if I were in her shoes.</P>
