<PRE>                                    HARD 8
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>HARD 8 is so perfect in every respect, it is hard to know where to
begin.  Let us start with the writing by Paul Thomas Anderson..   There
is not a word in the entire film's dialog that should be changed.
Every word has meaning; every word carries with it questions that are
raised as the story progresses.   I cannot recall when last I saw a
movie with dialog as well written. . . and delivered.</P>
<P>Then there is the acting.  The film has a  superb cast starting with
"Sydney," (Philip Baker Hall who one would hope will be remembered when
Best Actors are being nominated for 1997 films.)  What about the
direction, also by Anderson?  And the editing by Barbara  Tulliver of
this very taut story that feels as if at any moment something will snap
and you hope it will not.</P>
<P>Sydney, a middle aged  well-dressed man approaches a down and out loser
who is sitting hunched outside a coffee shop.  That is John (John C
Reilly).  Sydney asks John if he would like a cup of coffee.  John asks
for a cigarette and follows Sydney into the cafe.  Sydney asks John if
he has any money. The answer is that he does not; he lost it playing
blackjack.  Sydney asks John if he knows how to count cards while
playing blackjack.  No, he does not.  Sydney tells him only a fool
would play blackjack if he did not know how to count the cards.  Sydney
then offers to take him to Reno and teach him how to win.  And so they
are off and, in fact, John does very well.</P>
<P>The film moves two years forward.  We meet Clementine (Gwyneth
Paltrow), cocktail waitress and part-time prostitute.  We also meet
Jimmy (Samuel L Jackson) who is a scummy security guard at a casino who
tries his hand at blackmailing Sydney on whom he has some unsavory
dirt.</P>
<P>Throw all that together and HARD 8 is an absolute gem, a perfect
illustration of how to do nail-biting film noir.  Do not miss this
one.</P>
<P>Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson.</P>
