<P>     MANNY & LO, the debut feature from writer/director Lisa Krueger, is 
a wonderfully-textured comic fantasy about family life.  With only a few 
missteps along the way, this film takes us on a deceptively complex 
journey of discovery into a world that is similar, yet different, from 
the one we travel through every day.  For, although Krueger presents her 
characters as the human flotsam of modern-day life, there is a timeless, 
placeless quality to this story.  Ultimately, it doesn't matter when or 
where MANNY & LO takes place, but how the characters' trajectories bring 
them together at their final destination.</P>
<P>     Eleven-year old Amanda (or Manny, played by Scarlett Johansson) and 
sixteen-year old Laurel (or Lo, played by Aleksa Palladino) are sisters 
on-the-run.  After the death of their mother, they were placed in 
separate foster homes, only to be reunited after Lo ran away and "so-
called kidnapped" Manny from her substitute family.  Together, the pair 
lives life on the road, watching out for state troopers who may have 
their description, stealing food from small convenience stores, sleeping 
in model homes, and checking the milk cartons to make sure that their 
pictures aren't on the "missing" panels.</P>
<P>     Their unorthodox lifestyle is seriously disrupted, however, when Lo 
becomes pregnant.  By the time she acknowledges that it's not just a few 
extra pounds, she's too far advanced for an abortion.  Unwilling to turn 
herself in for medical care, but recognizing that she needs help, Lo 
decides to kidnap Elaine (Mary Kay Place), a "baby expert".  With 
Manny's help, Lo uses a shotgun to encourage Elaine to accompany her to 
a deserted mountain cabin retreat.  There, the three of them, captors 
and captive, await the baby's arrival while growing into a strange 
pseudo-family.</P>
<P>     Each of the main characters in MANNY & LO is a loner in search of a 
place to belong.  Despite her air of self-sufficiency and keen 
intellect, Manny wants nothing more than to have a mother.  She collects 
photographs of other families, and, every night before going to sleep, 
sprays her sheets with Arid Extra Dry -- a scent she associates with her 
dead mother.  Lo is equally emotionally needy, but conceals her pain and 
uncertainty with a show of false bravado. And, in her own way, Elaine is 
as much of an outsider as the two girls.  Although she has cousins, 
nieces, and nephews, she has no immediate family, and her distant 
relatives could care less whether she disappears off the face of the 
earth.  So, although the girls' relationship with Elaine starts out as a 
kidnapping, it develops into something more meaningful and intimate for 
them all, filling needs in each that they tried to keep hidden.</P>
<P>     Another thing that Manny, Lo, and Elaine have in common is a strong 
capacity for self-deception.  Each lives in a fantasy world where their 
own importance is heightened.  Manny and Lo believe that they are wanted 
fugitives, but, as becomes apparent, no one notices their comings and 
goings, or even cares who they are.  Likewise, Elaine is convinced that, 
once she is kidnapped, her friends and relatives will notice her absence 
and immediately mount search parties.  No such thing happens.  </P>
<P>     The best parts of MANNY & LO are the quiet, character-driven 
scenes, when it's just the three women alone, exploring their new 
relationship and contemplating the future.  A subplot involving the 
cabin's owner (Paul Guilfoyle) shows us something about how desperately 
Elaine wants to be part of Manny and Lo's life, but there are aspects of 
this sequence that strain the film's delicately-struck balance between 
reality and fantasy.  While I didn't exactly mind this chunk of the 
story, it didn't seem as well-considered as the rest of the picture.</P>
<P>     A sizable portion of MANNY & LO's success should be attributed to a 
trio of fine performances.  Aleksa Palladino, appearing in her first 
major feature, finds the right blend of prickliness and vulnerability to 
make Lo a sympathetic character despite her streak of unpleasantness.  
Mary Kay Place essays Elaine as a complex individual who gradually 
realizes that her kidnapping is a blessing, not a curse, since it places 
her in a position where someone actually needs her.  However, the real 
find in MANNY & LO is Scarlett Johansson, whose unaffected and 
thoroughly-engaging portrayal of Manny is so perfectly on-target that, 
while watching her, it's easy to forget that this is an actress playing 
a role.</P>
<P>     There's something magical about the way Lisa Krueger's film 
transports us to its unique reality.  There have been many films about 
family and belonging, but none with quite the same perspective as this 
one.  MANNY & LO is always pleasant, never confrontational, and comes to 
a conclusion that is emotionally true.  With its carefully-modulated 
combination of light comedy and drama, the film casts a gentle spell.</P>
