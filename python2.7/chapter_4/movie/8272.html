<PRE>IN LOVE AND WAR 1996</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Timothy Voon</PRE>
<PRE>Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Sandra Bullock, Chris O'Donnell, MacKenzie Astin, Emilio Bonucci,
Ingrid Lacey, Ian Kelly, Margot Steinberg, Tara Hugo Director: Richard
Attenborough Screenplay: Allan Scott, Clancy Sigal, and Anna Hamilton Phelan
based on the book HEMINGWAY IN LOVE AND WAR: THE LOST DIARY OF AGNES VON
KUROWSKY by Henry S. Villard and James Nagel Cinematography: Roger Pratt</P>
<P>Well she sure ain't no 'Florence Nightingale', but does carry with her a
pretty smile and a good sense of humour; and he sure ain't no 'Ernest
Hemingway', but he does carry with him a certain amiable, boyish charm
highlighted by his kiddy manner; and this definitely ain't no Leo Tolstoy's
'War and Peace', which is why this movie is called 'In Love and War'.</P>
<P>If Attenbourough was hoping to make a film with classy actors, he sure did
miss the boat and landed in a muddy puddle. Hey, isn't this the same bus
driving, boat saving, while you were sleeping down town lass (Bulllock)? And
isn't that the green tomato eating, friend circling, bat loving, boy wonder
fomp, of an up town lad (O'Donnell)?</P>
<P>Are we meant to stretch our imaginations to believe that they are meant to
be Ernest Hemingway and his war time love interest, nurse Agnes Von
Kurowsky? Really Mr Attenborough, it is very unfair of you to ask this lad
and lass to stretch their acting skills beyond limits which are considered
humanely safe.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, what we do have is a concoction of melodramatic, heart rending
mush which goes nicely with lemonade. 'In Love and War' we can draw
conclusions that the reason why Hemingway was so brilliant and yet so
miserable, was probably because he was dumped by a pretty nurse post-1st
World War; and he never had the heart to forgive her. Please spare us the
violins.</P>
<P>I'm trying not to be overly nasty with my comments. I enjoyed 'Shadowlands'
and I even liked 'Chaplin'; but this movie is just screaming out to be
teased. On a positive note, I can freely say that Attenborough's movies are
always easy on the eye, and one can sit through them with the same relaxed
feel of a Sunday picnic.</P>
<P>Comment: 'In Love and War' we don't find 'An American in Paris', but we
do find two juvenile Yankees making hay in Italy.</P>
