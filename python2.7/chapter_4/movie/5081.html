<PRE>                                  HEATHERS
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        What can you say about a movie that satirizes teen suicide?  Well,
you'd probably call it sick, demented, and perverse.  And while the black
comedy HEATHERS is all these things, it's also outrageously funny and
refreshingly off-beat.</P>
<P>        HEATHERS stars Winona Ryder as Veronica, and as the film begins,
she's in basic training ... training to be arrogant, bitchy, and most
important, popular.  Her mentor is Heather, or make that the Heathers as
there are three of them: Heather 1, Heather 2, and Heather 3.  These
preppie Diet Coke heads are the social elite of Westerburg High; they enjoy
the ultimate social power of deciding who is in and who is out.</P>
<P>        Even though Veronica aspires to be popular, her brains,
sensitivity, and conscience set her apart from the Heathers, her cold and
heartless mentors.  And just when her admiration for the Heathers turns to
contempt, Veronica meets J.D., played by Christian Slater who gives a
delicious Jack Nicholsonesque performance as the mysterious, rebellious,
and demented new kid at school.  J.D. has the alarming capacity for turning
Veronica's angry thoughts and urges into reality.  For instance, Veronica
wishes in her diary that Heather number one would die, and the next thing
she knows she and J.D. have killed her.  To escape criminal charges, they
disguise Heather's death as a suicide.  And much to Veronica's surprise,
suicide becomes the latest rage at Westerburg high.</P>
<P>        HEATHERS definitely is not for everyone.  Some viewers inevitably
will be offended by its subject matter.  But if you're looking for a dark
comedy with a biting edge to it, then HEATHERS has a lot to offer.  Daniel
Waters' script is full of hysterical dialogue and great one-liners, and the
teenage slang he creates for the movie is a riot.  The performances are
inspired across the board, especially those by Ryder and Slater who develop
sizzling chemistry in the lead roles.</P>
<P>        My only problem with HEATHERS (and it's a big one) is that after an
hour of great satire, the movie sells out and turns into a full-blown
thriller.  Although the climax is exciting, it's too violent and somber in
comparison to the rest of the film.  After sustaining perfect pitch for
over an hour, HEATHERS finishes on the wrong note.  Nevertheless, HEATHERS
deserves applause for taking risks and daring to be different.</P>
