<PRE>STAR TREK: GENERATIONS (1994)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: David Carson
Writers: Donald D. Moore and Brannon Braga
Starring: Patrick Stewart, William Shatner, Malcolm McDowell, Jonathan
Frakes, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, James
Doohan, Walter Koenig, Alan Ruck</P>
<P>Not being a trekkie, but possessing the ability to enjoy "Star Trek"
shows or movies (in moderation), I can't say that I was at all pumped to
see this.  And rightfully so.  Sure, it has come up with an interesting
way to pass the torch from TV show to TV show, but there's really
nothing else there unless you're a Spock-ears-wearing,
live-long-and-prosper saluting, die hard Trekkie.  For the rest of us,
we have to put up with hokey melodrama, and a pretty weak plot.</P>
<P>"Generations" introduces us film-wise to the crew of "Star Trek: the
Next Generation," which wasn't a BAD show, but hardly was as cool as the
original series.  Sure, we have some cool characters: Captain Jean-Luc
Picard (Patrick Stewart), Data (Brent Spiner), and...um...Will Wheaton
was cool for the first couple seasons.  But there's no other instances
of cool supporting characters, other than the blind Jordi (LeVar Burton,
who we all grew up with watching him on "Reading Rainbow"), and the
quiet Commander Ryker (Jonathan Frakes).</P>
<P>The film basically has the cool idea of teaming up the current Captain
Picard and the old and dead Captain Kirk (William Shatner), but that's
all it has.  There's a plot that is poorly constructed just to get these
two together in the end, and even that's not really worth watching the
rest for.  The plot deals with a crazy, obsessive man named Dr. Tolian
Soran (Malcolm McDowell - inspired casting, by the way), who wants to
get himself back inside a thing called the Nexus, which is this kind of
heavenly body that is kind of like paradise or something, but he was in
it before and has been waiting 78 years to get back in (not being a
trekkie, I don't know how a man could not age a bit in 78 years).</P>
<P>The Enterprise stumbles upon him when a lab he was working at was
attacked by Romulans (some sort of bad guys, I dunno), and he survived. 
They soon find out he's really working for the Klingons (DUH!), but that
he's really in it for himself.  He wants to get inside the nexus by
destroying a star, which will send the nexus sweeping through a planet
he'll be on, thus sucking him in...and subsequently destroying the
planet.  Eventually, it comes down to a big one-on-one fight between
Picard and Soran, and soon enough both are inside the nexus, and Picard
has stumbled upon Kirk, who was killed in the opening sequence by
it...sorta.</P>
<P>The film's height is at the end, although it's kind of anti-climactic. 
The only thing that saves it is the acting by both actors, as they have
good chemistry.  They are pitted together in a hokey sequence, one which
never really pays off.  </P>
<P>The beginning is cool, with members of the old crew showing up.  We, of
course, have Kirk, but we also have James Doohan and Walter Keonig...and
Sulu's daughter (I guess George Takei was too busy).  Note: no Spock,
Bones, or Uhura.  It's one of the only satisfying parts of the film,
even if Alan Ruck has a pretty unfunny role.</P>
<P>Of course, there's some little unnecessary subplots, like one dealing
with the android Data who has an emotion chip implanted inside him. 
Instead of being intelligent or anything, it just goes for some really
cheap laughs, as in one scene where he keeps making bad jokes.  This is
never explored in any kind of depth, and is pretty much annoying.</P>
<P>I personally like the "Star Trek" movies...okay, I like the even ones. 
They posess a kind of cool-ness to them, and never got overly corny or
anything.  They had depth to them, and they never became blatanly trying
to make some kind of cheap point.  This one has Picard discussing his
nephew wanting to go into Starfleet, but it stands apart from the rest
of the film instead of meshing along with it.  When he gets to this
nexus, and finds he has an artificial family, it's not as moving as it
should be, although the acting by Stewart saves it all.</P>
<P>Another cool thing about the older "Star Trek" is that they could be
pretty funny without being stupid.  "Star Trek IV" is a prime example of
this, which used its gimmick of Spock trying to assimilate into society
hilariously (I never thought I'd hear Spock utter the word "dumbass"). 
But most humor in this is corny, and just bad.  Brent Spiner's a funny
guy, but the writing for his character is so awful in some scenes that
it gets embarassing.  And a scene towards the beginning, taking place on
an artificial boat is just...ugh.</P>
<P>Then there's the nexus, which is supposed to be a place of absolute
bliss, but instead shows stuff that its inhabitants either never had or
once had, but lost.  It's supposed to be a place where you'd never want
to leave, yet Picard and Kirk do, all due to a really simple way of
thinking.  If it were so tempting, it'd be impossible to leave it.</P>
<P>There are some plusses to the messed-up story, though.  There are
certain exciting and awesome scenes, like the beginning, end, and when
the nexus sweeps through the one planet towards the middle (creating one
of the most gorgeous shots in "Star Trek" history).  The dialogue
between Kirk and Picard is pretty intelligent, and witty and all.  And
Stewart is, of course, awesome, as usual.  Oh, and Malcolm McDowell
makes a fantastic villain, even if he's too under-written.</P>
<P>"Star Trek: Generations" thankfully isn't horrible and un-watchable, but
it's so messed up, confused, and cheap that even the sight of Picard and
Kirk fighting together can't save it.  I really wish it could have,
'cause casting McDowell as the villain is purely inspired casting, and
it's such a shame he has to go to waste.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): **</PRE>
