<PRE>                            MISSISSIPPI BURNING
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1988)</PRE>
<P>        Alan Parker's controversial civil rights drama, MISSISSIPPI
BURNING, is an exciting and gripping drama, but one--alas--marred by
several flaws.</P>
<P>        At the heart of the film is an outstanding performance by Gene
Hackman as Anderson, a former sheriff turned FBI agent.  In his home state
of Mississippi, Anderson finds himself to be both an insider and an
outsider.  He hails from the South and knows its values, attitudes, and
mentality, but personally he has rejected them.  At the same time, however,
he is too much a free spirit and an individual to completely fit within the
FBI.  Hackman's character in MISSISSIPPI BURNING is fascinating and the
most intriguing aspect of the film.</P>
<P>        Under Parker's sensationalistic direction, MISSISSIPPI BURNING is
intense and disturbing.  However, several aspects of the film are
troubling.  MISSISSIPPI BURNING evokes immense hatred towards its villains.
Parker manipulates your emotions such that you want nothing more than the
FBI to kick some butt--in other words, to nail the bad guys.  Although the
FBI's vendetta is extremely rousing, I had to ask myself: isn't this the
function of a Rambo or Charles Bronson movie?</P>
<P>        MISSISSIPPI BURNING is not really about the civil rights movement
at all.  Rather, the film depicts a struggle of wills between two stubborn
FBI men: Hackman and his superior, played by Willem Dafoe.  Dafoe is a
strict, by the books agent who follows FBI procedure to the bone.  Hackman,
who is more familiar with the South, likes to do things his own way, even
if he must bend or break the rules.  MISSISSIPPI BURNING is more concerned
with the conflict between Hackman and Dafoe than it is with the racial
unrest between the blacks and the whites in Mississippi.  Underneath
Hackman and Dafoe's clash and underneath the film's Rambo mentality, the
important issues get lost: those pertaining to the civil rights movement.</P>
<P>        My main problem, then, with MISSISSIPPI BURNING is its historical
setting.  Why did Parker have to set this story of two FBI men in the civil
rights era?  And more importantly, why did he have to base the film on a
true incident?  MISSISSIPPI BURNING's fictionalized historical basis
distracted me.  I constantly wondered which parts were true and which were
fictional.</P>
<P>        MISSISSIPPI BURNING is troubling and thought-provoking.  To be
honest, at the end, I wasn't sure exactly how I felt about it.  Ultimately,
I think it is a worthwhile but challenging and perturbing film.  I applaud
its dramatic intensity, but I have to question the film's light dismissal
of important underlying racial issues.</P>
