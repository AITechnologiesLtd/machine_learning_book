<PRE>                                 THE PIANO
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1993 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     THE PIANO is one of perhaps two films I've seen lately (the other
being THE SECRET GARDEN) which are really original, and which show
something deep and interesting about human nature.</P>
<P>     THE PIANO has Holly Hunter as an unmarried Scottish mother who is
married by contract to a New Zealand settler, played by Sam Neill.
Hunter is mute, and achieves self-expression through her piano, which
she takes on the voyage.</P>
<P>     Hunter is incredibly strong-willed; even she cannot understand
where her will comes from.  She is tamed, gradually, by Harvey Keitel,
a wild man associate of Neill's who has adopted some of the Maori
ways.</P>
<P>     It is the romance of Hunter and Keitel that forms the basis of the
film, and also serves as the rock on which the film's sexual commentary
stands.  This movie is mainly about sex, in the sense that it is sex
that stands between men and women, and draws them together, and sex
that divides us as individuals, and draws us together.</P>
<P>     This is the only film I can remember seeing which has sexual
relations as a main theme, and which is not also boring (e.g., HENRY
AND JUNE, THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING.)</P>
<P>     All of the acting in the movie is good, including the little girl
who plays Hunter's daughter, but Holly Hunter's performance is one of
the most remarkable I have ever seen.  She never says a word, except in
voiceovers, and yet she manages to convey a character as clearly as any
actress has.  She is really remarkable.  She should certainly be
nominated for an Academy Award on the basis of this performance.</P>
<P>     Susan Campion's direction is also excellent.  Watching these
people, one is struck over and over with recognition of similar events
in one's own life.  Campion keeps any one of these characters from
being stereotyped (I especially appreciated this with Neill's
character, who could easily have been cast as a greedy, insensitive
lout).</P>
<P>     The screenplay is filled with remarkable images.  For example, the
hoop skirt tent, Hunter being carried in through the surf, the wedding
photograph, Neill's ambiguous viewing of Keitel and Hunter.</P>
