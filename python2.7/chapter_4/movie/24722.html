<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>There is an undeniable formula to movies like "Center Stage". In their 
home towns, the protagonists -- usually young, athletic and attractive -- 
have enjoyed success in their field of choice (here, ballet). Then they 
are thrust into the limelight, and find things more difficult than they 
ever expected. Their struggles to overcome this adversity all lead up to 
a single pivotal event which will either make or break their futures.</P>
<P>There's no getting away from this recipe; audiences seem to enjoy it, and 
it's pretty easy to write. Hence it is rare to find a film in this genre 
which actually tries to do something different. "Center Stage" is not 
that film, and so the question becomes not whether it is creatively 
noteworthy, but whether it makes good use of familiar material. 
Fortunately, the answer is yes: "Center Stage" is by no means a milestone 
in movie history, but it is very enjoyable and even exceptional in 
certain respects.</P>
<P>More than anything else, what helps "Center Stage" to rise above the pack 
is that it exudes a feeling of authenticity. Director Nicholas Hytner has 
made the inspired decision to cast actual dancers in several of the lead 
roles. Not only are these actors really performing, then, but they've 
also endured many of the same ordeals that their characters encounter -- 
everything from blistered feet to demanding instructors. Often when these 
sorts of experiments are attempted in movies, they fail because the
neophyte actors don't actually know how to act. "Center Stage" does not 
fall into the same trap, and while none of the castmembers exactly shine, 
for the most part they don't fall flat, either.</P>
<P>That said, likely the best performance amongst the large cast of 
characters comes from one of the actors who isn't a dancer by trade, 
Susan May Pratt as Maureen. Pratt enjoys what is probably the most 
complicated role in the film, as the star pupil of the American Ballet 
Academy who also happens to be its biggest snob. But Maureen's demeanour 
is as much a result of her domineering mother, and she yearns for a 
normal life outside ballet. Again, these are all timeworn character 
staples, but Pratt does a good job with Maureen, and wisely avoids 
Veronica Lodge-like exaggeration. Her development over the course of the 
movie is involving and believable, especially once she acquires a 
boyfriend and finds out how "normal" kids her age live.</P>
<P>Maureen's roommates include Jody (Amanda Schull), who has a lot of 
potential but can never seem to do things right; and the hot-headed Eva 
(Zoe Saldana). It is around Jody that "Center Stage" really revolves -- 
her dispiriting tribulations at the ABA, her attempts to recapture her 
love of ballet, and her romantic entanglements with ABA star Cooper 
(Ethan Stiefel) and the nebbish Charlie (Sascha Radetsky, sadly rather 
wooden and vapid throughout). Her story is the most routine, and while 
Schull herself is pleasant to watch, her character's misfortunes become 
grating after a while. The extent to which she blunders at the ABA is 
stretched to the point of disbelief, and at times the movie risks making 
her seem not just overwhelmed but downright incompetent.</P>
<P>Eva, a somewhat more interesting if no less stereotyped character, is 
unfortunately shunted to the background for large chunks of the movie. 
Indeed, there are so many subplots running through "Center Stage" that it 
is a credit to screenwriter Carol Heikkinen that the picture rarely feels 
cluttered. And while some stories are emphasised to the detriment of 
others, Heikkinen at least ensures that all of them achieve a modicum of 
development and completion.</P>
<P>The action of the movie follows the students through a year at the ABA. 
To the surprise of absolutely nobody, it all comes together at a major 
end-of-term concert which serves as an audition piece for ballet 
companies, particularly the prestigious American Ballet Company which 
Jonathan runs. Only three boys and three girls can be accepted into the 
Company, and the identities of the lucky winners will probably not come 
as much of a surprise.</P>
<P>Fortunately, despite the relative lack of suspense, this closing 
performance is altogether enthralling. The music, the choreography, the 
production design, and the skill of the dancers all contribute to a 
dazzling sequence which provides the perfect climax for the film. It also 
marks a splendid showcase of both classic and modern ballet, and is the 
best of several such performances littered throughout the movie. Only a 
rather bizarre editing decision midway through mars this scene, throwing 
the audience briefly out of the reality of the performance.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, the scene echoes the best of the Hollywood musicals of the 
1940s and 1950s, and the work of actor/dancers like Gene Kelly, Fred 
Astaire and Ginger Rogers. After viewing "Center Stage", it is hard not 
to mourn the death of the movie musical. This is not to say that, as a 
film, it is up to the standards of "An American In Paris" or "West Side 
Story". But "Center Stage" does make a valiant effort, and more than once 
it succeeds delightfully.</P>
