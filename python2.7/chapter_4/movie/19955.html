<P>Countless films have been made involving triumphs of the physically
handicapped or the parents of handicapped children in accepting their
kids. This well made German film turned it the other way round,
chronicling the tale of one with handicapped parents and the
complications involved, or rather, to show how uncomplicated some
things can be when there's understanding, patience and determination.</P>
<P>Lara, a sensible but headstrong girl grew up under the guidance of her
deaf-mute parents. Dysfunctional it may sounds but she had  a
fulfilling family life even if one of her tasks is translating the
dialogues of romantic movies to sign language for her mother. Being the
only ears and voice of the family, she easily took advantage of her
ability much to the disapproval of her equally stubborn father. Their
tension started building when Lara started learning the clarinet and
ultimately excelled in it. Without the ability to appreciate music,
there's difficulty for her parents to understand her dream and share
her success.</P>
<P>Primarily, it is very much a movie exploring the father-daughter
relationship with sibling rivalry in the sideline. The "language
barrier" just invoke various complications which made the resolving of
tensions more difficult. Instead of letting coincidences be the
solution, we get to witness the struggles the characters went through
to understand and forgive one another.</P>
<P>Somehow, the ending do came across a little abrupt as it ended just
after the father took his first step in understanding his daughter. I
just felt that it would more satisfying to affirm his sincerity. Then
again, knowing how stubborn that father was, it must have taken him a
lot of effort to do that. Taking that first step was indeed very
significant and may be all we ever need to know.</P>
<P>Caroline Link's  painstaking research paid off as she manage to paint a
more or less accurate picture of the deaf-mute community. Their
sometimes extraordinary method of doing things does not make them less
human than us, a message gently and effectively put across.  More
painstaking would be the making of the movie as the main players were
required to learn the German sign language. There was also some
communication problems since some of the main cast were deaf-mute by
nature, like the pair playing the parents.</P>
<P>In spite of all that, they still managed to deliver a powerful and
heartfelt piece of drama with quite some occasional and timely humour,
winning worldwide accolades from both the audiences and critics.</P>
