THE GOVERNESS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Writer and director Sandra Goldbacher's THE GOVERNESS is a movie 
all dressed up with no place to go.  It knows it wants to be an 
atmospheric costume drama that feels as fresh as the latest "Masterpiece 
Theater" series.  What it lacks is a compelling story to tell.  And when 
it finally gets to some "madness, sinful madness," the incidents feel 
forced and unnatural.</P>
<P>     The talented Minnie Driver plays Rosina, a young Jewish woman whose 
father dies in the beginning of the picture.  In order to stop being a 
burden on her mother, who is left saddled with her husband's 
considerable debts, Rosina decides to leave the big city she loves to 
venture off to the remote Isle of Skye in Scotland to be a governess.  </P>
<P>     Rosina, for reasons never adequately explained, hides her religion.  
Posing as a devote Christian, she nevertheless shudders to see all of 
the crucifixes in her new household.  The idea of a man with nails 
through his hands and feet hanging over her head is not something she 
easily tolerates.</P>
<P>     Most of the characters in this somniferous tale are not well drawn.  
Tom Wilkinson from THE FULL MONTY plays Rosina's new employer, 
Cavendish.  An early photography experimenter, he finds that Rosina 
provides the key help he needs to solve his scientific problem.  </P>
<P>     Rosina becomes more than just Cavendish's secret scientific 
colleague.  They become lovers in a bit of never very credible 
chemistry.  (She describes his wife as having a "lemon up her 
posterior," supposedly to justify her own subsequent behavior.)  She 
ends up taking nude pictures of Cavendish, which she uses for shock 
value when it suits her purpose.</P>
<P>     Edward Shearmur's music for the film is wonderfully dark and 
mysterious - a quality the lifeless picture rarely obtains.  The average 
"Masterpiece Theater" episode is much livelier and certainly preferable 
to THE GOVERNESS.</P>
<P>     THE GOVERNESS runs 1:54.  It is rated R for sex and nudity and 
would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
