<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>This is a movie made for those who enjoy bad films. It's an exploitation teen
movie with no redeeming social or entertainment value. It also fails to deliver
any messages, to raise social consciousness, or to succeed as an artistic film.
It's just a badly scripted and acted film, that by being so terrible might
provide a few chuckles for the discrete viewer who likes looking through trash.
The story is taken from the real-life riots that plagued Sunset Strip during the
mid-60s. </P>
<P>The film starts with a rock band pleading the case of the beautiful life on the
Strip for the hippies and rebellious teens that congregate there, wearing
outlandish clothes, dressed in longhair, and smoking pot. Then a voiceover
suggests we have got a youth problem going on all over the world. So the action
then turns to an average Hollywood high school, and a timid but pretty blonde,
Andy (Mimsy Farmer), is coaxed into going on a double-date to the Strip with her
loose girlfriend Liz-Ann (Mock). The kids get picked up by the police for
violating the curfew and their parents are called to take them home. Andy lives
with her divorced mom, who is a juicer and offers her no support. So she calls
the wife of a policeman, someone she hasn't seen in four years, to get her
released. </P>
<P>Sergeant Frank Tweedy's wife tells him that the girl in the police station was
his boss's daughter. Lt. Walt Lorimer (Aldo Ray) is in charge of the Sunset
Strip territory and is known as a cop who is against police brutality and a
friend of the teens, as he tries to be fair to both sides. The establishment
businesses claim the kids are turning the area into a zoo, where decent people
are afraid to shop. To show how tolerant Walt is, he talks to the club owners
and the hippie leaders and tries to get them to keep the peace while listening
to their suggestions. While he tells the businessmen that he'll not run the kids
away, but will enforce the underage drinking laws and try to keep the place
peaceful according to the law. </P>
<P>There's a rumble in the Pandora's Box club, and Walt keeps his word by having
the police act with restraint. </P>
<P>But he still doesn't reach out to his lonely daughter and try to talk to her,
and she can't stand being home with her lush mother. Against her better
judgment, she goes to the Pandora's Box and her group hooks up with a sleazy
rich kid from a dysfunctional family. He provides the acid as he arranges for a
wild freak-out party, that takes place in a home they break into. Andy never
took acid before and refuses to join the others, but it's slipped into her soft
drink. She then changes moods and does an acid influenced dance, and then five
guys take her upstairs to the bedroom and rape her. When the break-in is spotted
by a passing patrol car, Walt and Frank are on hand before the cops bust the
kids as they want to make sure there's no police brutality. But when he finds
out that his daughter was raped, Walt takes his anger and sense of guilt out on
three of the rapist kids that are at the hospital to be identified. He beats
them up, which causes the riot on Sunset Strip. </P>
<P>The film ends sugarcoated with false piety and some idiotic questions are asked
about the kids; such as, Where will the kids go? What will they do? The only
question I had, was why make a film like this? This film was as real as a
snowball in hell. </P>
