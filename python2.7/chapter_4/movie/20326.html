<P>"Bowfinger" is one of those comedies that is supposed to entertain at
Hollywood's expense. Albert Brooks' recent "The Muse", made by the
independent October Films, did entertain at Hollywood's
expense. "Bowfinger", however, is made by Universal, a major movie
studio; so exactly how incisive was Steve Martin's script allowed to
be? Judging from my viewing of the film, not at all.</P>
<P>Bobby Bowfinger(Steve Martin) is more than down on his luck. His
company, Bowfinger International Pictures, is run out of a torn-up
little house, and hasn't made a film in what seems like years. But,
when a former secretary submits an original screenplay about aliens,
entitled "Chubby Rain", Bowfinger calls it dramatic genius and sets
out to make a film.</P>
<P>When he pitches it to a big studio exec.(Robert Downey Jr.), he reads
the first and last pages of the script and tells Bowfinger that if he
can get action star Kit Ramsey(Eddie Murphy) to sign on, then it's a
"go" picture. When Ramsey turns him down outright, Bowfinger comes up
with an idea; he wants to film Ramsey's scenes without him knowing it,
by having the actors go up to him, say their lines, and watch his
reaction. It turns out that Ramsey is having delusional problems
anyway.</P>
<P>Bowfinger then holds auditions for the acting roles, and Daisy(Heather
Graham), a young woman from Ohio who arrived with dreams of being a
star, gets the main female role. Daisy is not quite as naive as she
looks, knowing that sleeping around in Hollywood can get you almost
anything. But Bowfinger's real find is Jiff(also Eddie Murphy), a
dimwitted burger-flipper who happens to look exactly like Kit
Ramsey. From there, "Bowfinger" is the story of a group of misfits
trying to make a Hollywood "guerrilla" film.</P>
<P>However, "Bowfinger" is not nearly as clever or funny as it set out to
be.  Being a Hollywood film, it never really takes a stance on today's
Hollywood and never turns into what I'd call a satire. Most of Steve
Martin's script isn't clever, but rather dumb humor. Just as Bowfinger
pretends to be a big-time director, "Bowfinger" pretends to be
original and fresh.</P>
<P>The acting, though, is above-average. Heather Graham finds a good
comedic role in her caricature of a scene-whore, and Eddie Murphy is
great in both roles; especially as Jiff(he has done the dual role
thing before, in "The Nutty Professor"). Murphy has been skewing away
from children's movies this year, which seems to be a start on the
right track for him. Frank Oz's direction could have been tighter, but
this is essentially Martin's film to make or break.</P>
<P>"Bowfinger" is not totally unfunny; it's more of a hit-and-miss comedy
that misses a bit too much. If you would like a no-holds-barred satire
of Hollywood(that is still quite subtle) I suggest you check out "The
Muse". It has the wit, heart, and vigor that "Bowfinger" is sorely
lacking.</P>
