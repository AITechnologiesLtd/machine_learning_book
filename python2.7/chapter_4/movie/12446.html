<PRE>**Conspiracy Theory**
Reviewed by Jeff Walters</PRE>
<P>       When I entered the theatre I was expecting a fairly light
mystery type movie, and came away pleasantly surprised and
somewhat dissappointed at the same time. The film opens with an
extremely amusing sequence which sees Gibson's character
(paranoid cabby Jerry Fletcher) trying to convince various fares of
several different conspiracies. Jerry is just a treat to watch,
especially in the first hour, where he manages to be funny and
touching in the same scenes.</P>
<P>     Jerry's manic behaviour is countered nicely by Julia Roberts'
portrayal of a caring Justice Department official, Alice Sutton, and
it is through her eyes that you experience most of the movie. Several
of the key scenes involving Jerry and Alice are genuinely
touching, like in Jerry's apartment where he gives his explanation for
owning so many copies of "Catcher in the Rye". There is no
doubt that this film's strength lies in the interaction between Mel
and Julia. The pair just have terrific on-screen chemistry. </P>
<P>     Conspiracy Theory takes a dramatic change of direction not too
long into the film, with a fairly confronting torture scene that
really surprised me and many others around me, especially after the
light-hearted introduction. Don't get me wrong though, the scene is
terrific and Gibson does a brilliant job conveying the outright terror
the character is experiencing.</P>
<P>        I feel though that the 'conspiracy' storyline was
disappointing and bungled to a certain degree. What started out as an
intruiging premise (i.e. One of his theories is correct - But which
one?) peters out and when the conspiracy is revealed, it is after no
real deductive work at all by the main characters. Also, Conspiracy
Theory's main villan, Dr Jonas (Patrick Stewart), is not
explored as much as you'd probably like, but Stewart does a terrific
job with what he was given and was well cast. I'd never have picked
him as a villan before, but he's very cold and convincing.</P>
<P>             Overall, I'd say this is a film well worth seeing. The
acting was simply terrific and the movie was filled with genuine
humour, not lame Batman & Robin one liners. If it wasn't for the
fairly weak 'conspiracy' storyline - this would have been a big hit.
Many people have said that this film was simply too long, but I didn't
seem to notice any problem there. Anyway, go and see it, if for no
other reason than to listen to Jerry's off-the-wall conspiracy ideas
or to take a look at his apartment........he's got a combination lock
on the fridge and he stores his coffee in a padlocked container.</P>
