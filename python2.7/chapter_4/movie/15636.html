<P>"Two Girls and a Guy," directed by James Toback (1987's "The Pick-Up 
Artist"), is a three-character drama that is set entirely in the New 
York apartment of a struggling actor (Robert Downey Jr.), who comes home 
from a long trip to find that both of his girlfriends, Carla (Heather 
Graham) and Lou (Natasha Gregson Wagner), are there and have discovered 
that they both have been being played by him for the last ten months.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to make films like "Two Girls and Guy," in which 
there only a few characters and all they do is talk. It can be done 
(1995's "Before Sunrise"), but more often than not it comes off as being 
more appropriate as a play than an actual motion picture (1995's 
"Oleanna"). The successfulness of such a film usually depends on the 
quality of the dialogue and performances, which is unfortunate since 
"Two Girls and a Guy" rarely has intelligent and provocative dialogue, 
and the performances are far from impressive.</P>
<P>One of the main problems with "Two Girls and a Guy" is that it is 
constantly confused by what type of genre it wants to fall in. Mostly it 
is a comedy, which is somewhat of a predicament considering the fact 
that the subject matter is very serious. And then in the end, nothing is 
really resolved, and the picture makes a sharp u-turn towards melodrama, 
which isn't touching, but just seems out of place.</P>
<P>Another flaw is in its characters, which are the type of people you are 
glad you don't know in real life, since they are both unpleasant and 
downright annoying. Like "Oleanna," which equally grated on your nerves, 
it seemed like all of the dialogue was shouted at each other to the 
point of nausea, and I walked away from the movie with a literal 
headache. After seeing this film, I made a rule that in order to like a 
movie, it shouldn't be physically painful to watch.</P>
<P>"Two Girls and a Guy" is overdone in almost all senses of the word, and 
it is very messy. By not liking any of the characters, I didn't care 
about their problems or the outcome of them. I just wanted them to leave 
me alone.</P>
