<P>     DANCER IN THE DARK is a masterwork by one of the most audaciously
brilliant filmmakers working today ... or it's a huge, sick joke at the
audience's expense. Or maybe it's both. You can't really put any
motivation past Lars von Trier, a director whose fondness for rendering
his own name in block letters four times larger than the film's title
belies a certain streak of ego. This is a man who decided to write the
rules for a new aesthetic of minimalist cinema with his Dogme '95
manifesto, then proceeded to break all those rules by making a live-action
musical. It has become clear that you can predict virtually nothing about
the way von Trier will try to make a movie, except that it will inspire
extreme emotions. You may want to gasp, or cry, or smack him silly for
dragging you along on his exercises in self-indulgence.</P>
<P>     In DANCER IN THE DARK, von Trier takes at least three huge risks, and
the two that pay off more than make up for the one that doesn't. His story
is set in Washington state in 1964, where a Czechoslovakian emigree named
Selma Jezkova (Bjork) is working as a machinist at a factory. A single
mother raising her 12-year-old son Gene (Vladica Kostic), Selma devotes
virtually all her time and energy to making money for a very important
purpose. Gene needs an operation for a hereditary eye disorder -- the same
one that is causing Selma to go blind. Only musicals can temporarily
distract Selma from her mission -- watching one in a movie theater,
performing in one in a local theatrical production, or imagining that the
world around her is turning into one when life gets particularly grim. And
it gets plenty grim when a conflict with her troubled landlord (David
Morse) threatens Selma's money and her life.</P>
<P>     The grimness of Selma's life is rendered in von Trier's favored
washed-out morph of film and digital video -- Big Risk #1 -- but it's a
tactical blunder for this particular script. DANCER IN THE DARK is
fashioned as a melodrama, with developments that pit our morally pure
heroine against dastardly forces. On glossy celluloid, such an
old-fashioned narrative approach might have worked. The hand-held,
documentary-style of DANCER IN THE DARK, however, demands a level of depth
in the characters' motivations and relationships that isn't always there. 
Von Trier spends too much time on Selma's interaction with an unrequitedly
infatuated admirer (Peter Stormare) while never bothering to explore his
interest in her. That's time that could have been much better spent on the
underdeveloped relationship between Selma and Gene, which should be
central to the film. What are we to make of her obsession with his future
needs while apparently ignoring his present, including truancy? It would
have been possible to turn Selma's conflicted motivations into a
compelling plot point. When a character is left to ask Selma, "Why did you
have Gene?" you realize that von Trier has turned the son into an
abstraction, and let the mother off too easy.</P>
<P>     Such a gaping hole at the center should have killed DANCER IN THE
DARK where it stood. Instead, it's still often dizzying, chilling and more
engrossing than virtually any other film this year. Big Risk #2 was the
casting of Bjork as Selma, and it's hard to do justice to how
extraordinary her performance is. While her less-than-authentic Czech
accent occasionally distracts, she hits every emotional note with such
resonance that it's painful to watch her. And as painful as it is to
watch, it's equally impossible not to watch when Big Risk #3 -- the
musical production numbers -- kicks in. They're rendered as
brightly-colored interpretations of Selma's interior life, inspired by the
natural rhythms of a train's wheels, machinery and a record's run-out
groove. Undoubtedly some viewers will find it impossible to get past the
contrivance, or past Bjork's distinctive yodeling vocals. Others will be
transfixed by the image of a killer fantasizing the forgiveness of the
victim, or the most abruptly concluded musical number in film history.</P>
<P>     Many critics have already noted that DANCER IN THE DARK bears more
than a passing resemblance to von Trier's 1996 film BREAKING THE WAVES in
its focus on the trials of a beatific female martyr. Indeed, Selma's
sacrifice is not set up nearly so convincingly as that of Emily Watson's
Bess, which can only make DANCER seem to suffer by comparison. That
doesn't diminish what von Trier is able to accomplish this time around
with another spectacular performance and more giddy disregard for
expectations and conventions. DANCER IN THE DARK is a deeply flawed
narrative that  becomes a long sit during its third act; it's also studded
with several moments of jaw-dropping brilliance. It's the work of a
director who'll do anything to inspire a reaction. In a world of overly
sanitized cinema, it's hard to dismiss that kind of raw nerve.</P>
