<PRE>A Review by Adam Godfrey
EdTV
Starring: Matthew McConaughay, Jenna Elfman, Elizabeth Hurley, Woody Harrelson,
Ellen Degeneres, Rob Reiner, Martin Landau
Directed by Ron Howard
Grade: C-</PRE>
<P>  At times, you'd think EdTV would be an entertaining film. I mean, who can
resist the story of your average Joe becomming a celebrity by having his life
filmed every minute of every day? 
  But this average Joe, Ed Perkuny, (Matthew McConaughay), is a sappy, lifeless
creation that wanders around, trying to solve everyone's problems and settle
his own. McConaughay is awful, especially because he is trying to pull off his
usual Hollywood charm with a 3 week beard and torn jeans. Frankly, he had more
charm in the devestating flop The Newton Boys. He overacts in every way: his
overexaggerant body language, obsession with kissing women every second he gets
the chance, and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life, and
drops to his knee and cries.
   The rest of the cast is very good; especially Martin Landau (as Ed's
step-father), who plays a cute role as the close-to-death old guy that makes
all the witty comments. Jenna Elfman is good, (but a little overemotional); her
main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films, i.e. Can't Hardly
Wait, and Krippendorf's Tribe. Woody Harrelson, as Ed's brother Ray, does his
usual egg-headed role, with his comic wit as well (he wrote a book entitled,
"My Brother Pissed on Me.") Elizabeth Hurley is perfectly cast as the easy
slut, and Dennis Hopper, in a quick cameo as Ed's biological father, is a nice
choice (ironically coming after the role he turned down as Christof in The
Truman Show).
   Ellen Degeneres stood out as the executive who, after awhile, decides the
show must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec, Rob Reiner's
opinion.
   I hate to compare this film to The Truman Show, but the fact is, I was
ashamed to see this movie. It felt that I had dropped from College to
Kindergarten after seeing Truman and Ed. EdTV had no real wit or genius; it was
typical Hollywood. Extracting the TV part of the movie, you have the simple
plotline: Man steals brother's girlfriend, girlfriend leaves town, man gets new
slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on, slut breaks up with him, real
girlfriend comes back, and voila, you have a romance.
   I got so restless during this movie, I almost walked out. The only reason it
doesn't drop below a "C" grade is because of the fine supporting performances.
Grade: C-
