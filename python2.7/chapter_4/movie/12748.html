<PRE>DROWNING BY NUMBERS (1987)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: Peter Greenaway
Starring: Joan Plowright, Juliet Stephenson, Joely Richardson, Bernard
Hill, Jason Edwards, Bryan Pringle, Trevor Cooper, David Morrissey, Kenny
Ireland, Michael Percival</P>
<P>Explaining the plot of "Drowning by Numbers" almost makes it seem like a
high-concept film: one that can be explained in about one sentence (if
that).  In fact, my one film book has one very short sentence explaining
the film, as well as their thoughts on it: "Three women decide to drown
their husbands."  This is essentially what goes on in this film, making it
easy to explain to anyone who asks what it's about.  The weird thing is
that behind the simplicity of the concept, the film is one of the most
engagingly frustrating films to watch.  You watch it once, maybe even
twice, and you're suddenly set off on a cinematic puzzle, desperately
trying to figure out what you've just seen and comprehend it.</P>
<P>"Drowning by Numbers" tells the story of three generations of women, a
delightful trio all named Cissie Colpitts:  there's the mother, played by
Joan Plowright (who has the ability to give a unique droll dignity to any
film she's in); her older daughter, played by Juliet Stephenson (from
"Truly, Madly, Deeply"); and the younger, spunkier daughter, played by
Joely Richardson, daughter of Vanessa Redgrave.  Over the course of the
film, they all drown their respective husbands, starting off with the
mother, who starts the trend when she catches her husband with another
woman, realizes she's had enough of him, and pushes his head underneath the
water level of a bath tub his wading in.</P>
<P>Their shananigans is easily covered up by the local coroner, Madgitt
(Bernard Hill, perhaps known to American audiences as the Captain in
"Titanic," although you wouldn't recognize him here), who lies on his
statements, and requests that his payment for his crooked deeds be that
he's given some sex from each of the women, none who fully cooperate.  All
the while, the film introduces us to games that Madgitt and his son, Smut
(Jason Edwards), play constantly, with Smut narrating the rules of how to
play them.</P>
<P>Just to make things more frustrating for the audience, as well as more fun,
the film gives us numbers throughout the film that are marked either
conspicuously (the film shows a copy of Joseph Heller's "Catch-22" as one
of the numbers) or blatantly (on the rump of two cows), but nevertheless
are shown in order for the audience to count up as the film goes along. 
While this may seem like just a fun thing to do throughout the film, to
count your way until the ending, for others, it intoduces a bizarre mix to
the story, further complicating it as to why it, as well as the references
to numerous games, is included in the context of the film, and how it
relates to all the other elements.</P>
<P>The film was directed by Peter Greenaway, who directed one of my all-time
favorites, "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover," a film that is
as fascinating story-wise as it is visual-wise.  I have once said that he
is probably the best director of mise-en-scene ever, or at least working
today.  "Drowning by Numbers" is no exception.  It's a gorgeous-looking
film, almost coming off as a living Rembrandt painting.</P>
<P>Greenaway often works with many of the same crew members for his films, and
it's obvious why: they're so damn good at what they do.  Sacha Vierny, the
Director of Photography, and who's worked with Resnais and Bunuel on some
of their films, definitely has an eye for making a shot look absolutely
beautiful, so much that most of the frames in this film, and some of
Greenaway's other films, could be framed and sold as artwork.  Another one
of his members is Michael Nyman, the film composer (who's also worked on
"The Piano" and "Gattaca"), who's beautiful background music effortlessly
gives every scene the right tone that Greenaway is going for, even if much
of it is redundant (and recylced in or from other Greenaway films).  Give
Nyman a couple years and I'll easily say that he's the best film composer
since Bernard Herrman.</P>
<P>One of the resons I like Greenaway's films so much is because not only are
they gorgeous piece of art, but they stimulate the mind, making it work
hard to understand not so much what's going on, but why they are placed
together in the first place.  "Drowning by Numbers" is basically a living
puzzle.  We struggle to look at every shot as a piece in the puzzle,
wondering why things are happening, and why they are included in this film.
 At first glance it seems like a mixture of a bunch of different puzzles,
where some pieces fit together but don't make up the same thing.</P>
<P>This approach is often criticized for distancing the audience from the
film, looking down at them and laughing at them for not being able to
understand what's going on.  This is because the ambiguity is so high, and
it's almost impossible to understand Greenaway's intentions for placing so
many weird devices together in one film.  Why are there numbers throughout
the film?  Why are game rules introduced?  Why did he make it?  All of this
is anyone's guess.</P>
<P>My theory?  The film is making fun of order and trends, and showing them
for what they are.  The first drowning is almost understood, as the husband
had been cheating on her for years, and it's almost like he received his
just desserts for being such a bastard.  But the following ones have a
gradual descent into obscurity, being done possibly as a trend of what the
first one was, and lacking the reasoning and intensity that the first one
had.  There's also other kinds of trends in the film, like Smut who follows
all sorts of rules of games to a T, and does whatever a little girl, who
jumpropes throughout the film, says (like circumsising, for instance). 
There are the games that are introduced that show rule-following at their
peak.  And, of course, there are the numbers, that give the film a sense of
order and duration, that it will only last as long as there are 100 numbers
(after 100, everything becomes bland, as the film points out).</P>
<P>What I got out of the film was a sense of order and trends becoming stale
after awhile, and a loss of originality and passion lacking after awhile. 
The numbers, at first intriguing and fascinating, become redundant, and
soon lose the luster they once had.  He seems to be saying that traditions
cause people who honor them to forget why they were started in the first
place, and instead do them because they just think they ought to.  At least
that's what I got out of it.</P>
<P>Is this what Greenaway was going for?  I have no clue.  But such is the fun
of ambiguity.  We can try and make up explanations of films like this,
never knowing if we're right or not, but intrigued as to whether we are or
not.  It's one of the reasons I like Greenaway's films so much.  As he's an
aquired taste, many people may be put off by his lack of an
easy-to-understand message.  But even if you can't understand this film at
all, and have no clue what he was going for, "Drowning by Numbers" is still
incredibly entertaining.  It has a playful, humorous nature, filled with a
giddy kind of tone, and is endlessly fascinating, never becoming boring,
probably because it's so complex and at times frustrating.  That's why
Greenaway gets away with this film, which would be a big disappointment for
probably any other director.</P>
