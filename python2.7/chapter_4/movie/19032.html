<P>'The Mummy' strikes a familiar chord along the lines of irreverent film
making in so much as that it turns out to be nothing more than popcorn
entertainment.  As this was clearly the intention, the hustle and bustle of
its sheer aim to please can't quite escape the fact that the film is out of
control, over the top, over simplified and overly dependent on special
effects.  There are few laughs because the campy humour isn't understood by
all, few injections of character fuel, and the film is like a rollercoaster
gone out of control.  Instead of building a slow momentum leading up to the
action sequences, the film is determined to make the hair on the back of
your neck stand up indefinitely in its second half and it never gives you a
chance to breathe and it feels all wrong.</P>
<P>'The Mummy' does deserve credit in several areas.  The first of which is its
look.  Designed to look and feel entirely different than the 1932 feature
with Boris Karloff (technology sort of makes it impossible to look like the
original I suppose), this film has impressive production designs, sweeping
special effects which are good but over done.  It's attempt to poke fun at
films like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and other movies of a similar nature
isn't necessarily a good thing.  Doesn't Hollywood leave the lampooning of
classic films to Leslie Nielsen?</P>
<P>Brendan Fraser stars as an American in the French Foreign Legion named Rick
O'Connell, who, on an archaeological dig at the ancient city of Hamunaptra
accidentally awakens the Mummy who is the evil Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) from
the days of the ancient Egypt around 1300 B.C. who was tortured, buried
alive and whose soul never laid down to rest upon his death and he seeks
revenge upon being awakened in what is now 1923.  O'Connell is joined in his
adventure by Evelyn Carnarvon (Rachel Weisz) and her brother Jonathan (John
Hannah).</P>
<P>The film might have come across better if it had a few big name and
experienced stars to carry it during its weak spots the way Jack Nicholson
carried 1989's 'Batman' through some of its weaker areas when the film
seemed like it was sagging and Nicholson's clear improvisation saved it from
collapsing.  The budget looked so big in 'The Mummy' that I suppose there
was little chance of latching onto a big name when most of them now command
20 million dollars a picture which is approximately 1/5 of a big studio
film's standard budget.</P>
<P>Director Stephen Sommers ('Deep Rising') makes the fatal mistake of allowing
the film to run over two hours (124 minutes to be exact).  'The Mummy' feels
like a marathon runner's feet at the end of a long run.  It's tiresome.
There's no doubt that the film is great to look at on the big screen in many
instances but the audience I saw it with had a lot of kids and after seeing
the look on the face of many parents in the crowd I think they realized the
film wasn't exactly a family adventure and the film definitely isn't for
young children under the age of 12.</P>
<P>On the veteran's end of the scale, 'The Mummy' has some redeeming
satisfactions.  Oscar winner and multiple nominee Jerry Goldsmith is
responsible for the film's sweeping original score and Oscar nominated
camera man Adrian Biddle ('Thelma and Louise') gives the movie a gleaming
and refined look of beauty.</P>
<P>Every entity has a weakness that leads to its destruction.  Superman had
Kryptonite, the Death Star had a hole two metres wide and the Blob had the
cold.  'The Mummy' has the distinction of being the type of film that over
uses special effects and doesn't have enough of anything else and it should
have realized that when special effects are involved, sometimes less is
indeed more.</P>
