<PRE>                         STRANGERS ON A TRAIN
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     Let's swap murders -- "Your wife, my father" -- the rich and
eccentric Bruno Antony proposes to tennis athlete Guy Haines, a
stranger he just met on a train in Hitchcock's 1951 taut thriller,
STRANGERS ON A TRAIN.  Who could catch us reasons Bruno since neither
of us would be suspected, and we'd get rid of the people who are
bothering us.</P>
<P>     Bruno, played wickedly by Robert Walker, is a diabolical type who
loves his mother, loathes his father, and once threatened to blow up
the White House -- just joking, of course.  He's also developed a way
"to smell a flower on the planet Mars."  Watch how menacing Robert
Walker can make Bruno with nothing more that a devious smile and a box
of popcorn he munches nonchalantly.</P>
<P>     Guy (Farley Granger), in contrast, is a rock solid citizen who
wants to marry a senator's daughter, Anne Morton (Ruth Roman), just as
soon as he gets rid of his entanglements with his current wife, Miriam,
a notorious flirt.</P>
<P>     Miriam, played like a oversexed schoolgirl by Laura Elliot, is
pregnant but probably not with Guy's baby.  We see her with two young
bucks in tow as she takes them both into the infamous Tunnel of Love at
the local carny.</P>
<P>     Hitchcock is a master at setting up scenes for maximum effect.
When Miriam, her two boyfriends and Bruno are shown inside the tunnel,
we see only their moving shadows.  And when the camera moves to outside
its entrance, we hear a scream from inside, which turns out to be
nothing more than Miriam yelling at one of her boyfriends with an "oh,
stop that," meaning don't do anything of the kind.  In another
beautifully composed sequence Miriam's glasses fall off when Bruno
begins to strangle her.  The rest of the murder is then filmed through
the reflection in her glasses lying in the grass.</P>
<P>     (So when does Hitchcock appear?  Ten minutes into the film.  Just
as in THE PARADINE CASE, it's at a train station, where he's carrying a
musical instrument case, but this time it's a bigger one, a bass.)</P>
<P>     As expected, Guy is aghast when Bruno actually commits his end of
the dastardly deeds they discussed; Guy wasn't serious.  But not to
worry, Guy has a rock solid alibi.  However, the alibi crumbles through
an unlucky break, and the story goes through a series of twists as
Bruno keeps bugging him to follow through on their deal, which Guy
never agreed to in the first place.</P>
<P>     Babs, played by Hitchcock's daughter Patricia, who looks strangely
like a younger Miriam, is great as Anne's precocious younger sister who
specializes in speaking the unspeakable.  She keeps pointing out how
and why her future brother-in-law is a prime suspect in his wife's
murder.</P>
<P>     Hitchcock's characters, as usual, feature an everyman, Guy in this
movie, wrapped up in a web he has trouble breaking.  Hitchcock has a
deft touch with his actors producing characters in predicaments that
are easy to empathize with.</P>
<P>     As Guy gets swept up in the story's whirlpool, Hitchcock uses some
classic and always effective thriller backdrops such an amusement park.
More imaginative is setting up a tennis match that doesn't look like it
will end soon enough as a way to ratchet up the tension.  And, finally,
a run-away merry-go-round provides the film's piece de resistance
vehicle for terror.</P>
<P>     STRANGERS ON A TRAIN runs 1:40.  It is rated PG for violence and
tension and would be fine for kids around nine and up.</P>
