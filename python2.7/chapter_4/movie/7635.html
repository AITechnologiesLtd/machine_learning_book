                       A film review by Marty Mapes
                        Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) BEWARE! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS ONE (AND A HALF) OF THOSE
WORDS THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO READ.</P>
<P>The Travellers are this country's gypsies. They live in the south and
travel around, conning and scamming people (and sometimes big companies)
for whatever they can get. As my brother said, this is uncharted
territory, entertaining in and of itself because it shows something we
don't see in our pop culture.</P>
<P>He's right, but he's too generous. There are a lot of mistakes that keep
TRAVELLER from being a very good film. They are minor, but they are
pervasive.</P>
<P>The movie introduces us first to the scamming life, then to "the
family." They are not the mafia, but they are a close-knit clan, and
outsiders are not welcome. Pat (Mark Wahlberg), the son of a former
Traveller returns with his father's body to be buried on family ground.
His father was kicked out of the family because he married an outsider.
Now Pat wants to join the family and stick to it like his father
couldn't.</P>
<P>At first, the family patriarch Boss Jack (Luke Askew) doesn't want to
allow Pat into the clan, but Bokky (Bill Paxton) takes him under his
wing. The two leave home base and travel around together, scamming
farmers, homeowners, and bartenders. At one bar, the scam goes just as
planned, but afterwards, Bokky realizes that he has fallen in love with
Jean, the bartender (Juliana Margulies).</P>
<P>Bokky finds out that Jean has lost her job because of him, so he goes to
her house to return the money. He's developing a guilty conscience about
what he does for a living, and he sees a better life with Jean as a real
possibility.</P>
<P>Wahlberg (as Pat) starts to shine as Pat becomes more annoyed at Bokky
for falling in love with an outsider. His surrogate father is making the
same mistake his real father made. Here is Pat, working very hard to win
respect with "the family," frustrated, as he watches Bokky dissolve his
own ties "over a fucking woman."</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Double D (James Gammon), a fellow Traveller, starts hounding
Bokky in an attempt to convince him to help with a very big swindle that
he has planned.</P>
<P>All three see Double D's plan as their way to get what they want: Bokky
can make one last big score (both to start his new life and to soften
Boss Jack over his leaving), Pat can win respect, and Double D can
finally put his plan into action.</P>
<P>A movie like this is fun in the same way that Penn & Teller are fun.
(Penn & Teller are magicians known for giving away SOME of the tricks of
their trade.) It's easy to get caught up in the trick because it goes so
smoothly. Then you see how much work went in to making it look easy, and
you develop a new respect for the man pulling the strings. There are
some of these tricks in TRAVELLER, but not enough to really work your
brain.</P>
<P>I also have some reservations about the subject of the movie. I wouldn't
say that TRAVELLER glamorizes the life of a con artist, but it does
present it as the norm. Bokky does develop a conscience, but there are
spots in the movie where the con is sometimes cruel. When Jean realizes
she's been had, there is a scene of her reacting in anger and disbelief.
Another time, the victims are a young man and his pregnant wife.</P>
<P>These scenes are in the movie so that we can understand Bokky's desire
to get out of the business, but they are hard to watch because of their
cruelty. I suppose that doesn't have to be a criticism, though.</P>
<P>But there are grounds for criticism in TRAVELLER, which is a sloppily
made movie.</P>
<P>First, Paxton and Margulies lack screen chemistry. There's lots of sex,
but no chemistry. This wouldn't be a problem in another movie, but Bokky
is willing to change his life for this woman. Presumably, if the
relationship were "just" sex, he wouldn't go to the trouble of leaving
the clan. Then again, maybe that's why the cruel scenes mentioned
earlier are so important -- maybe it's Bokky's conscience and not his
heart that is pulling him away from the family.</P>
<P>Second, Green and screenwriter Jim McGlynn made the movie too blunt. The
setup has different characters repeating how the family ain't like the
outside world. Then,  After an early run-in with Boss Jack, Pat gets a
crush on a pretty girl. He follows her home and realizes that she is the
daughter of -- you guessed it -- Boss Jack. (To add irrelevance to insult,
this relationship is tossed aside and forgotten.) Worst of all, the
movie has a DEUS EX MACHINA ending. It appears that McGlynn wrote
himself into a corner and ran out of clever ideas.</P>
<P>Finally, the editing of the movie was clumsy. Most people don't notice
the editing, even when it's bad, so if you want to see this movie, skip
this paragraph. There are abrupt shifts of location and mood that reveal
either a novice director or a mediocre editor. This movie appears to
have both. Green, who has been a renowned cinematographer for a long
time, makes his directorial debut (he also acted as cinematographer).
Michael Ruscio, with only five movies under his belt edited TRAVELLER.
An example is a montage of Bokky crying over his wife's and daughter's
graves. Then, rather suddenly, we cut to him taking care of business
with Boss Jack. Another example is when Bokky learns that his
grandmother is ill. He reacts, then we cut to his car, then we quickly
cut to his grandmother's trailer. All three shots play as part of the
same scene. There is nothing to indicate the passage of time or
distance. (And, as my brother says, this is particularly jarring since
the characters seem to move about in such a large world.)</P>
<P>I think many people, including my brother, can see past technical flaws
and enjoy a movie because of an interesting story or setting or
character. I admit that I tend to be picky about the quality of the
filmmaking. If you're like me, you might want to skip this one. If
you're like him, by all means you should go see it.</P>
