<PRE>                            GROSSE POINTE BLANK
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: GROSSE POINTE BLANK is not sure if it
          wants to be a deep allegory or a comedic action
          film.  John Cusack plays a freelance assassin-for-
          hire who returns home to attend his ten-year high
          school reunion and rekindles the romance he walked
          out on a decade before.  The dialogue is smooth but
          neither it nor the characters nor the plot seem to
          be believable for any place in this solar system.
          Rating: low +1 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 12 positive, 2 negative, 2 mixed</PRE>
<P>     The last film I saw with such hip yet unrealistic dialog had
Kenneth Branagh looking for revenge on his own uncle for the murder of
his father.  This is another smoothly written but violent tale of a man
in his twenties dressed in black who is seeking something different in
his life, but there the resemblance ends.  John Cusack is Martin Blank,
who has been out of high school for ten years, the last five of which
he has been a professional assassin.  Like Sam Spade he works out of a
dingy office where he is tended by a mothering secretary.  It might
have been fun to see a steamy relationship between him and his
secretary, but I think that the American public might not have been
ready for that given that his secretary was played by sister Joan
Cusack.  Martin's profession throughout is treated almost as just
another job.  His chief competitor is Mr. Grocer (Dan Aykroyd) a
cheerful killer who is trying to organize all the assassins and hit men
into a sort of a union so they could do less work for more money, but
would have to attend meetings.</P>
<P>     At the near insistence of his secretary he decides to attend his
ten-year class reunion in the posh Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe.
Reticent at first, he decides he will combine questionable business
with dubious pleasure by performing a contract hit in the same area.
So off he goes to the reunion, but one of his first stops is to see his
old girl friend Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver) who now is best known in
Grosse Pointe as the host of a local radio program, making strange
elliptical comments on the music.  When the two of them get together,
it is going to be a bizarre weekend.</P>
<P>     Of course, bizarre is the word for Martin and just about everybody
he knows.  To anybody who asks what he does for a living, Martin very
openly admits he kills people.  The response is always a quip and at
first it seems that nobody is taking him very seriously.  However, when
he kills somebody late in the film, a high school buddy very matter-
of-factly helps him dispose of the body apparently without giving it a
second thought, as if he was helping Martin change a tire.  Often there
seems to be logic missing in the plot, but then plot frequently seems
to be only a vessel for the clever dialogue.  Not that what people say
makes sense all the time either.  The dialogue, like that in PULP
FICTION, is stylized, but somehow it never has the same spark and
sometimes just seems to be forced filler.  "What do you want in your
omelet?"  "Nothing." "Well, that technically is not an omelet."  The
line is neither accurate, realistic, nor funny.  But what can we expect
from a production company called "Caravan Pictures," and whose logo is
a solitary man walking down a road?  Unlike in PULP FICTION we feel we
are listening in on people who are all style and no substance.</P>
<P>     Some of the films better moments occur when the two Cusacks (John
and Joan--actually there are at least two more in the credits) play off
of each other.  It perhaps gives us a feel for what it must have been
like in the Cusack household.  The screenplay credits John for some of
the writing, though it might well be for ad libbed quips.  Minnie
Driver has a little less of the likable quality she generally exudes
due to being just a bit too smooth, much like her father, played by
Mitchell Ryan.  (Ryan, incidentally, has the distinction of playing in
three unrelated major films showing at the same time--THE DEVIL'S OWN
and LIAR LIAR.) Alan Arkin has a small part as Martin's analyst, but
comes off the most humane as the only person who seems really disturbed
by the fact that Martin kills people.</P>
<P>     Like most its characters GROSSE POINT BLANK is uneven, hard to
believe, occasionally funny, but has too much style and not enough
substance.  These are people who are thinking more about their next
clever comment than they are about killing.  The film is entertaining,
but its flippant attitude toward murder leaves a bad taste.  The film
gets a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
