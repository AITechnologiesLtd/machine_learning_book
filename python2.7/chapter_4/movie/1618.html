<PRE>                                  ALADDIN
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Good animation but an otherwise very
     bad non-telling of the story of Aladdin and the wonderful
     lamp.  The story has little to do with the Arabian Nights
     tale and even that story keeps being derailed by Robin
     Williams's much too topical humor.  This film is many cuts
     below BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  Rating: 0 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     I am not a great fan of the animated versions of fairy tales and, in
this case, Arabian Nights tales, as produced by Disney Studios.  I frankly
questioned that proclivity when I saw BEAUTY AND THE BEAST just about a year
ago.  It seemed to me at that point Disney (the studio, not the man) had
learned how to hell a story with complexity and one that worked on multiple
levels.  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, it seemed to me, was a film that said
something about the human condition.  Now the same company makes ALADDIN.
Is it as good as BEAUTY?  Try asking if it is even as good as THE LITTLE
MERMAID.  This one is a solid disappointment.</P>
<P>     Let us start with the story.  I think we all know the story of Aladdin,
right?  Good.  Will somebody tell it to the good folks at Disney, please.
Disney is often less than faithful to source material.  In this case perhaps
one or two scenes of the story made it to the film.  The screenplay by Ron
Clements and John Musker (who also produced and directed) in fact is almost
a reasonable version of the modern story "The Thief of Baghdad."  The
setting has been moved from China to Arabia for reasons best know to
Clements and Musker.  In this version Aladdin falls in love with the
princess of Aqaba and sets out to win her.  Even telling that story would
not have been a bad idea, but the film goes desperately wrong with its use
of Robin Williams as the genie of the lamp.  When the genie is on the screen
we go from the usual timeless story-telling to a bunch of topical allusions
that may be amusing on first viewing, but will not be a second time.
Williams lampoons Arnold Schwarzenegger, William F. Buckley, Jack Nicholson,
Robert DeNiro, Groucho Marx, and a host of other celebrities.  Williams
totally derails any style that the film has been able to build up.  The
story-telling often just stops dead as Williams does his thing or the film
goes off into slapstick.</P>
<P>     At least there is something positive to say about the art and
animation, some of which is actually quite nice.  There is a cave whose
mouth is the head of a tiger that is both well drawn and well animated.
Backgrounds are intentionally blurred and then focused sharply to shift the
eye of the viewer and give a feeling of depth.  There is a very nice
sequence involving a rolling cylinder--I will not describe how it fits into
the plot. The animation is sufficient but the extremely uneven tone and the
almost total lack of fidelity to the story make this a lesser effort from
Disney.  My rating is 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
