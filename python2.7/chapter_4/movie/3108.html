<PRE>                              More Fall Film Reviews
                       Film reviews by Michael John Legeros
                        Copyright 1994 Michael John Legeros</PRE>
<PRE>CLERKS
======</PRE>
<P>     Hilarious, ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout Kevin
Smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers
(Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson).  They spend most of their day
ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to
self-fulfillment.  The premise is strictly sitcom and the photography
is grainy as all get-out, but you could spend ten times the film's
budget (a reported $27,000) and still not get dialogue half as good as
this.</P>
<P>     Originally rated NC-17 for language.  Not recommended for viewers
with sensitive ears.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
<PRE>KILLING ZOE
===========</PRE>
<P>     Remake RESERVOIR DOGS as a French art film and you're halfway to
KILLING ZOE, writer/director Roger Avary's slow-moving story of a
failed Bastille Day bank robbery.  Eric Stoltz stars as an American in
Paris who gets in *way* over his head when hooks up with a band of
nihilistic bank robbers.  He's the safecracker who's blissful unaware
that the bank job is a botch job from the word go.</P>
<P>     Though intriguing on all fronts, the film is paced at half the
speed of PULP FICTION, which Avary co-wrote with Quentin Tarantino.  In
English and French.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B-</PRE>
<PRE>THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE
=====================</PRE>
<P>     Based on the novel by T. Coraghessan Boyle, THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE
doesn't go very far.  Bowels, bowels, and more bowels are explored by
Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (a buck-toothed and bespectacled Anthony
Hopkins), who, in the early 1900's, advocated abstinence,
vegetarianism, and frequent defecation.  He also invented the
cornflake.  Really.</P>
<P>     Checking-in to Kellogg's Battle Creek Sanitarium are Matthew
Broderick and Bridget Fonda, just two of the many well-known faces in
this failed comedy.  Leave your laughter at the door and you can marvel
at the unfunny antics of John Cusack, Michael Lerner, Lara Flynn Boyle,
John Neville, and Dana Carvey.</P>
<P>     The art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences
are amusing, but the novelty quickly wears off as writer/director Alan
Parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo-doo into drama.  What he ends
up with is something that I can't print here.  Phew!</P>
<PRE>Grade: D+</PRE>
<PRE>STARGATE
========</PRE>
<P>     LAWRENCE OF ARABIA meets STAR WARS.  This epic sci-fi film is more
sheer spectacle than anything else.  Director Roland Emmerich
(UNIVERSAL SOLIDER) shamelessly rips off Lucas and Spielberg and just
about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on.  The film
is overlong, the characters are cardboard, and the script is filled
with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history.</P>
<P>     That said, there's still plenty to watch here.  Sci-fi fans should
enjoy the sculpted sands, the morphing headdresses, and a surprisingly
spunky James Spader.  He plays the Egyptologist who gets to prove his
theory that that "somebody else" built the pyramids.  Less interesting
are co-stars Kurt Russell and Jaye Davidson of CRYING GAME fame.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C-</PRE>
<PRE>STAR TREK GENERATIONS
=====================</PRE>
<P>     Trek fans may be more forgiving, but, for the rest of us, the
sluggish STAR TREK GENERATIONS is a mixed bag at best.  The story is
interesting, but each scene goes too long.  The cast is earnest, but
the direction lacks punch.  And so on.  (The best example of the latter
is a Klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar
scene in STAR TREK II.)</P>
<P>     Original Enterprise captain James T. Kirk appears on both ends of
the story, though they cut the scene where Shatner turns to the screen
to plead "get a life."  Remarkably unremarkable.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B-</PRE>
<PRE>MIRACLE ON 34th STREET
======================</PRE>
<P>     In a season of THE SPECIALIST and PULP FICTION et al, maybe a
remake of MIRACLE ON 34th STREET *is* necessary.  John Hughes certainly
believes in Santa Claus and his Les Mayfield-directed production does
nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original.  The romance
between costars Dylan McDermott and Elizabeth Perkins doesn't work too
well, but the film makes a strong case that Richard Attenborough is the
definitive Kriss Kringle.  His chemistry with children can moisten any
eye.</P>
<PRE>No Claus for alarm.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
<PRE>JUNIOR
======</PRE>
<P>     Arnold Schwarzenegger pregnant?  Sure, Billy Crystal did it before
in RABBIT TEST, but the sight of Schwarz with a bulging belly is a
casting coup comparable to Dustin Hoffman in TOOTSIE.  What should be
nothing more than a one-joke premise actually gets better as it goes
along.  Director Ivan Reitman (DAVE, TWINS) wisely keeps the farce to a
minimum, so the first hour moves slower than you might expect.  Don't
expect too many yuks from Danny DeVito, but you can't beat those early
romantic scenes between Emma and Arnie.  How's *that* for a collision
of acting styles?</P>
<PRE>     Bring hankies, ladies.</PRE>
