<PRE>SERENDIPITY
-----------</PRE>
<P>When Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale, "Pearl
Harbor") both reach for the same pair of gloves in the midst of Bloomingdale's
Christmas shopping madness, sparks fly.  While both were grabbing those 
gloves as a gift for a significant other, John wants to pursue possibilities,
but Sara's a fatalist who believes that if they're meant to be, they'll
be blessed with "Serendipity."</P>
<P>Unfortunately, John Cusack, the romantic comedy lead of a generation, comes
up 0 for 2 in 2001 (as has its director Peter Chelsom following up "Town and
Country").  While "America's Sweethearts" had its moments, few
went his way, and the film, overall, didn't live up to its potential.
Cusack is in his element here as a sincere, thoroughly charming,
hopeless romantic, but "Serendipity" is a labored, joyless film.</P>
<P>Although it's obvious Jon and Sara have made a connection, Sara proceeds to
throw up painfully obvious screenwriting 101 obstacles designed to keep them
apart until the end of the film.  She has Jon write his name and telephone
number on a five dollar bill which is put into circulation to see if she
ever comes across it again.  To be fair, she writes her name (which she 
hasn't given to Jon) and number inside a hardcover copy of "Love in the Time 
of Cholera," telling Jon she'll sell it to one of the hundreds of used book 
stores in New York City.  To give Jon one last chance, she has him board
a different elevator in the lobby of the Waldorf Astoria, spinning the
roulette wheel on them both hitting the same floor's button - of course they
do, but Jon is sidelined by an obnoxious tyke who hits the button of every
floor in between and so he misses Sara by a hair's breadth.</P>
<P>Years later, Jon is engaged to Hally (Bridget Moynahan, "Coyote Ugly") but
still pining for the mysterious Englishwoman, much to his best buddy,
New York Times' obit writer Dean's (Jeremy Piven, "Rush Hour 2")
consternation.
Now in San Francisco, Sara's fiance is New Age Nordic flutist Lars (John
Corbett, HBO's "Sex and the City"), yet she also has misgivings met with
disgust by her best friend Eve (Molly Shannon, "Superstar").  As Lars'
career threatens to overshadow their upcoming nuptials, Sara flees to NYC,
dragging Eve along under false pretenses.</P>
<P>It's generally not a good sign when a film's stars' sidekicks generate greater</P>
<P>empathy with the audience than the stars themselves.  Cusack mainly suffers
from having to be attracted to a ridiculous character, but Beckinsale is
forced to make one unbelievable move after another by Marc Klein's script.
John Corbett does a bravura filmic turn as Lars, generating some of the film's
best laughs as the self-important, yet likeable, cult/trendy musician.
Cusack buddy Jeremy Piven also gets mileage out of being the sounding board
to, yet admiring of nonetheless, his dementedly romantic friend.  Molly
Shannon, so fearless in the underrated "Superstar," makes Eve the type of
feet-on-the-ground friend every woman should have.  Eugene Levy, as a 
Bloomingdale's salesman, is funny initially, although his presence in the
film becomes more and more forced, particularly in the thud-echoing coda.</P>
<P>Director Chelsom, who created the whimsical "Hear My Song," vastly underrated 
"Funny Bones" and sweetly fantastical "The Mighty," can't obscure the rigging 
which holds up a plot that should be lighter than air.  Cinematographer
John de Borman's work can't be faulted, showcasing NYC in all its romantic
holiday finery and making the 'if it's meant to be-ness' ironic with
timelapse overhead shots of New York City's everyday chaos.  Kudos to whoever
created Lars' wonderfully wacky music and accompanying insane video.</P>
<P>"Serendipity" per Webster's dictionary is 'the faculty of finding valuable
or agreeable things not sought for,' while "Serendipity" the film strenuously
searches for things that should just be, but aren't.</P>
