A Simple Plan</PRE>
<PRE>A Review:</PRE>
<PRE>By Jeremiah Rickert</PRE>
<P>Starring: Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Bridget Fonda
Directed by Sam Raimi</P>
<P>Synopsis:
     Three men discover 4.4 million dollars in a downed plane that has
been hidden in a wildlife preserve.  They decide to stick to a simple
plan: hold onto the money until the springtime, when the plane is sure
to be discovered, and tell no one about it, not even wives. Once they
can be sure that no one is looking for the money they plan to split it
three ways and leave town.  They figure the money is most likely
drug-money and therefore it's "not really stealin'."  The three men are
Hank Mitchell (Bill Paxton), a basically straight-up family man, his
brother Jacob Mitchell (A totally immersed Billy Bob Thornton), who is
unemployed and a bit slower than his brother Hank, and Jacob's drinking
buddy Lou (Brent Briscoe), another beer-swilling good ol' boy.  Little
by little, their simple plan becomes more and more complicated until it
starts consuming people one by one.</P>
<P>     This film's biggest asset is the screenplay.  Written by Scott B.
Smith, adapted from his own novel, the film has nearly perfect pacing
and as the tension surrounding the plan begins to wind up, the plan
itself begins to unravel, slowly at first, and then in torrid gasps.
All of the resolutions of the plan that the three men come up with:
don't tell anyone, even wives, everyone has to agree to leave town, and
so on, are violated one by one by one.  The first thing that Hank does
when he gets home is dump the money on the table and tell his wife
(played with a very subdued cunning by Bridget Fonda) everything.  She
then gets involved, and suggests taking some of the money back to the
plane to when it is found, they'd think that it fell out or something,
for no one would leave behind $100,000 if someone had found the cash,
would they?  Her complication of the plan leads to the death of a farmer
who happens to be in the area when they're planting the money on the
plane.  It's only downhill from there, as more and more people are
killed for the sake of the plan.  Sooner than they hoped, an FBI man
comes to town with information on the plane, but there are doubts to
whether he's really an FBI agent, or one of the people who lost the
money.</P>
<P>     Most of the performances are top-notch, especially that of Billy
Bob Thornton as the slower brother Jacob.  Jacob is almost a foil for
Hank, the upstanding straight-arrow family man.  He may be slow, but his
motivations are the least greedy of the bunch.  At one point in the
movie, after so many have died and the money seems to be an imminent
reward, Jacob asks Hank "I'm gonna be happy now, right?"  Really all
Jacob wants to do is to remodel their father's farm, but that means he's
not going to leave town as was part of the plan.  Jacob ends up being
the most observant one of them all.</P>
<P>     Sam Raimi had a lot to prove with this film in many ways.  As he's
most well known for his comedy/horror films and his hyper-kinetic camera
work, this film was in a way a make it or break it for him as a
mainstream filmmaker.  For the most part, he avoids his camera-tricks
and lets the characters carry the film.  There are number of
Hitchcock-ian references, from Psycho's crows, who are an omnipresent
witness to the crimes that are concealed for the sake of the plan, and a
Birds-esque scene where Hank is seemingly attacked by some startled
birds in the fuselage of the downed plane.  The cinematography has a
definite Fargo-esque pedigree to it, but considering the locales of the
film and of Raimi's long associations with the brothers Coen, that does
not seem surprising.  The film starts off with what appears to be a
reference to "It's A Wonderful Live" when Hank walks through the town
wishing everyone a happy new year.  Just as the audience begins to think
of him as George Bailey, he soon begins to look like Norman Bates.</P>
<P>     The film is really a downward spiral of desperation, on the part of
just about every one of the characters who have a relationship with the
4.4 million dollars.  A lot of filmgoers will probably be put off by the
rather un-hollywood ending, but hopefully it won't overshadow the
wonderful performance by Billy Bob Thornton and the great screenplay by
Scott B. Smith.  It's perfectly paced and both Smith's script and
Raimi's direction precisely control the tension of the film, winding it
tighter and tighter as the plan begins to unravel.</P>
<P>Of the $4.00 I payed for the film, it was worth every penny, $4.00</P>
