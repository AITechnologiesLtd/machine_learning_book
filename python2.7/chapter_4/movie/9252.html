                        BEVERLY HILLS NINJA 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                   1  :-(   for the great white ninja</PRE>
<P>Cast: Chris Farley, Robin Shou, Nicollette Sheridan, Chris Rock, Soon
Tek-Oh, Nathaniel Parker Director: Dennis Dugan Producers: Brad Krevoy,
Steve Stabler, Bran Jenkel Screenplay: Mark Feldberg & Mitch Klebanoff</P>
<P>Fat is not necessarily funny, and this movie carries ill proportions of
both. Chris Farley, a relative unknown quantity in films, carries the
weight of his medium like a naive virgin. He is "The Great White Hope",
the fulfilment of an ancient prophecy - a white child will be found
adrift the shores of Japan, and he will become the greatest ninja of his
generation. Myth becomes farce, as babe becomes man. This is perhaps
where the prophecy should end, before the "Great White Ninja" makes a
"Big Fat Fool" of himself.</P>
<P>Wherever Farley treads, disaster follows. Almost every scene is awash
with disaster being caused by Farley, or being heaped on Farley. There's
something sickly and amusing about watching this accident-prone babe in
arms look ridiculously clumsy on screen. His earnest and sincere
actions, make his attempts at humour grow along the accidental sort.
Sabotage and stealth are his tools, and chaos is both a friend and foe.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the end result of this single dimensional joke is
watching Humpty Dumpty fall down, over and over again. Although certain
scenes are idiosyncratically hilarious, it becomes difficult to sustain
an entire movie on such lean humour. Not everybody will appreciate this
comedy of excessive clumsiness when lame only becomes lamer. "The Great
White Ninja" will not win the hearts of an audience, by simply twirling
a couple of num-chukas about and hoping it will somehow crack a skull or
two.</P>
