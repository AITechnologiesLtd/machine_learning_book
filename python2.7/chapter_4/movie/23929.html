<P>"The line between being a Hero and a Murderer is a very, very thin
one"
So says Colonel Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) in his attempt to
defend his friend Colonel Terry L. Childers (Samuel L. Jackson)
against charges of ordering his troops to fire on an unarmed group of
protesters at the U.S. embassy in Yemen. "Rules of Engagement" is an
interesting film on many levels but ultimately doesn't quite work
because of a week second half.</P>
<P>The film opens in Vietnam in 1968, as Marine Colonels Hayes Hodges and
Terry Childers work their way through the jungle. Splitting up to find
an enemy strong hold, the two teams are attacked. Childers' squad is
attacked first but manages to capture the Vietnamese Colonel Cao
(Baoan Coleman). It is almost immediately afterwards that Hodges troop
is attacked while crossing a swamp. The casualties are high and Hodges
is wounded. As Childers hears the fire fight, he commands Colonel Cao
to radio his men and order them to retreat. Childers' threatens Cao
with death if the order is not carried out. Cao refuses. Childers'
then shoots and kills Cao's radio operator. Cao then relents under
fear of his own death.</P>
<P>Hodges is saved. Childers is a hero and the two men cement a
friendship that will stand as a greater honor than anything else in
the Marine Corps. The film moves forward to present day. Colonel Hayes
Hodges is retiring. A career marine, Hodges feels weary and tired,
disappointed in not living up to his Father's (Philip Baker Hall)
legacy.</P>
<P>In the Middle East, tensions are rising. Situations come to a head
when the U.S. Embassy in Yemen is surrounded by a large crowd of
Demonstrators.  Snipers fire at the builder, as workers scramble
trying to salvage whatever they can. Ambassador Mourain  (Ben
Kingsley), his wife (Anne Archer) and their son are all in danger. The
U.S. Government orders the marines to send in a rescue team to extract
the Americans and their families. Col. Terry Childers, is ordered to
lead a squadron of Marines in the rescue attempt. Dodging sniper fire,
Hodges locates the Ambassador and leads him and his family to a
waiting helicopter. Childers them returns to the roof of the Embassy
to retrieve the U.S. flag. In the process, one of Childers' men is
killed. Childers sends the Ambassador on his way, and returns to his
troops. Two more marines are killed. Childers then orders his men to
open fire on the crown gathered at the front of the Embassy. More than
the 80 Yemeni men, women and children killed by Marine gunfire.</P>
<P>The situation comes to a head when word gets back to the State
Department. A political firestorm has begun. National  Security
Adviser, William Sokal (Conrad Bachmann), demands that Colonel
Childers be brought up on charges of murder. As there is no evidence
that the crowd in front of the Embassy had weapons, Childers must have
fired into the crowd of civilians, instead of firing at the snipers on
the roofs across from the Embassy,.</P>
<P>Knowing that the situation is dire, Childers goes to the one man whom
he feels can help him.. Hayes Hodges. The two men start to investigate
the case with only eight days before Court Marshal proceedings begin.
Hodges has trepidation's about his abilities. He's not a very good
attorney and knows it. With the short time he has, Hodges  flies to
Yemen in an effort to find a corroborating witness for his friend and
client. When Hodges returns, his own doubts about his friend
jeopardize both the case and their friendship.</P>
<P>"Rules of Engagement" is seemingly an honest film. The first half of
the feature is very well played, with a good level of intensity and
commitment. It's the second half of the film, the trial itself when
the film starts to bog down into typical cinematic territory. The
biggest mistake the film makes is in having a nominal villain in the
piece.</P>
<P>Having the National Security Adviser commit such a heinous act in the
body of the film completely stops the momentum of the film dead in its
tracks. Giving the audience an identifiable bad guy is such a
concession to market research, that the film cannot recover from it.
Furthermore, the film did not need this concession, as the plot
creates the situation without it. The addition of the scene becomes
redundant.</P>
<P>One of the biggest and most noble surprises in the film, is the honest
and non-inflammatory was that the Marine Corps are portrayed. The
introductory scenes in Vietnam are as palpable as anything by Kubrick
or Oliver Stone. This sequence is very well directed and performed,
and is a grand introduction to the rest of the film.</P>
<P>The courtroom scenes are as traditional as one could expect. As with
other films of this type, it is the performances that carry the scenes
forward. Samuel L. Jackson carries his scenes with an intense and
proud demeanor. His Colonel Terry L. Childers is a proud Marine and a
proud man. His instinctive and passionate command is both refreshing
and invigorating. A very good performance.</P>
<P>Tommy Lee Jones gives the best performances in the film. A man,
equally proud of his military command, but haunted by his own
failures. As Retired Colonel Hayes Hodges is called back into duty at
the request of his friend, Jones plays the difficult emotions and
crisis with a subtle grace that simmers with both apprehension and
self doubt. Tommy Lee Jones has always given credible and exciting
performances, but here he is called upon to internalize his fear and
anger. And when they finally come to the surface, that explosion is
also reigned in. In his fight with Childers, Hodges continually
hesitates. Doubting his own conclusions, and again disliking himself
for not trusting the man who had save his life in Vietnam.</P>
<P>"Rules of Engagement" marks the return of famed Director William
Friedkin. Friedkin's career has been spotty over the last decade.
While his style and finesse have always been beyond reproach, his
choice of material has not always been up to the level of his talent.
Here, the director has a script that challenges him while also playing
it safe. There is much to like about the film. "Rules of Engagement"
does not succumb to the jingoist marching usually associated with
films about the military. Nor does it play the military as inherently
evil. The soldiers are all played as men who have chosen to serve
their country. And for a change, the soldiers are shown to have
individual ideals and passions. Guy Pearce (as Prosecutor Major Mark
Biggs) almost stealing the film from the two leads. Pearce (who was
remarkable in "L.A. Confidential"), continues to amaze the audience
with his command of dialects (he is Australian), and the naturalness
of his performance.</P>
<P>"Rules of Engagement" is a marginally good film. It is worth seeing.
But it would have played much better had not the villainous subterfuge
been so obvious. A concession to modern day teen audiences, that the
film is not even aimed at.</P>
