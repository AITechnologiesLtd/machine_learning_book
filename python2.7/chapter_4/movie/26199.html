<PRE>                               SHOLAY
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is the longest running and
          most profitable Hindi film of all time.
          Strongly influenced by THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN,
          albeit with two heroes instead of seven, it is
          basically a Western made and set in 1975 with
          locales in then current India.  Some of the
          Hindi Film conventions will chafe American
          viewers, but overall it is quite enjoyable.
          Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to +4) Note:
          This review is written from the point of view of
          an American for other Americans.  The viewer's
          experience may vary.  I find that Indians can be
          extremely fond of this film and will probably
          like it considerably more than I did.</PRE>
<P>     When the film SHOLAY was released in 1975 it at first appeared
not to attract much of an audience in India.  Word of mouth grew,
however, until it was the highest grossing and most profitable Hindi
film ever made.  It had a theatrical run of over seven years in
Bombay and five years in Delhi.  Today there are Indians who will
unabashedly call it one of the finest films ever made.  While the
film takes place in its present, it is basically a reframing of
SEVEN SAMURAI and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, retold with two heroes
instead of seven.  Directed by Ramesh Sippy who picked up many of
the conventions of American Westerns and especially form the Italian
Westerns of Sergio Leone.  Madhya Pradesh in Central India and a few
other areas in India are perhaps the only places in the world where
there are still conditions so similar to the American West.  There,
at least according to my informant, gangs of dacoits still ride
horses in rocky terrain and live relatively free of the law
enforcement.  It is a strange mix of times to see bandits on horses
and people in contemporary dress on modern motorcycles.  I am
informed that the view of village life in India is very accurate.
SHOLAY, whose name means "sparks of fire," follows the conventions
of Indian neighborhood films.  That means it has several songs in
production numbers, it has generous doses of comedy.  And the film
is in the range of 190 minutes long.</P>
<P>     Thakur Baldev Singh (played by Sanjeev Kumar) has a problem.
As a Thakur--sort of the equivalent of what in England was a
squire--he is responsible to protect his village from the ravages of
a the gang of the bandit named Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan).  To do
this he wishes to enlist the aid of two of the worst thieves in the
country, Veeru (Dharmendru) and Jai (Amitabh Bachchan).  The Thakur
has dealt with them before when he was not the police force and he
knows them to be decent men and good fighters who are his best
chance to defeat Gabbar Singh.  He hires them to capture Gabbar
alive.</P>
<P>     In flashbacks we see that the Thakur previously was to bring
the two to prison via train.  When the train was attacked by bandits
the two escaped from his chains, fought off the bandits, and then
turned themselves into the authorities rather than let the policeman
die of his wounds.</P>
<P>     As is frequently the case is Westerns the most memorable
character is the villain.  Think of Calvera in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN
or Hannibal Lector in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  In India Gabbar
Singh has taken on a life of his own.  Indian children memorize his
lines.  He is has become one of the most popular screen villains of
all time for reasons that must be only partially clear to outsiders.
He certainly has personality, though perhaps not all of it
transcends the language barrier.</P>
<P>     Making this a Hindi film are the usual standard touches.  In
the course of the three-hour-plus film there are five production
number songs.  An early one is a colorful number set during the Holi
holiday.  At this holiday Indians throw large volumes of brightly-
colored powders into the air and at each other, which certainly is
visually colorful.  Another production number toward the end of the
film is a bit sadistic and makes the audience involuntarily wince.
Music is by R. D. Burman, but its quality is a little hard to
measure by Western standards.  The music and the comedy tend to pad
out what in the West we would make into a more focused and intense
film.  Some of the comedy is rather bizarre including a scene in
prison in which the warden has chosen one of the most hated
personalities of this century on whom to model his looks and
actions.</P>
<P>     A number of pieces of the style are reminiscent of Sergio Leone
films.  Some scenes are drawn out for the greatest amount of drama,
but will be done almost silently with one irrelevant sound
dominating (e.g. the repetitive squeaking of a swing).  In one scene
several people are shot in a sort of massacre, but rather than
showing the carnage, each time the action stops in a freeze-frame
for a second or two.  When the father of the house comes to see the
bodies, each is covered in a sheet, but as he stands looking the
wind comes and one at a time blows the sheet away leaving a body.
In another scene a man is aiming a gun at a defenseless boy.  There
is a quick jump to a train venting steam with the same explosive
sound.  These are very evocative scenes and these touches give parts
of the film a definite Italian Western feel.  That part of India has
landscapes much like the American West anyway.  It is odd to find
such good work in the same film that has some of the silly comic
musical numbers that this film has.  There some of the comic editing
features under-cranked cameras and touches one would more associate
with "The Monkees."</P>
<P>     The non-Indian wishing to try Indian neighborhood entertainment
films could do worse than to begin sampling with SHOLAY.  Though it
may seem uneven, like the British "curate's egg," parts of it are
excellent. I rate it 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4
to +4 scale.  The film is now available on DVD.  (Thanks to Lax
Madapati for showing me and giving me extensive background
information on this film.)</P>
