                       A film review by Michael Millhollin
                        Copyright 1997 Michael Millhollin</PRE>
<P>It was a hot day here in Las Vegas (100 degrees) so I decided to see a
matinee.  The movie Breakdown, starring Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan,
was my choice and a choice I'm glad I made for the cheaper matinee ticket
prices.  Yes, I thought it was a movie made only for the matinee crowd as I
didn't find it worth a $6.50 ticket.  Kathleen Quinlan is beautiful and
probably a fine actress (why do actresses wear thin tops with no bras
underneath?) but this role didn't give her much of a chance to prove that. 
Kurt Russell has had better acting parts, but this one fell short of
expectations.  I found his acting, well, somewhat over acting!!  There is a
lot of action packed scenes, but in my opinion, far too many for the story
line.  I just could not imagine half the stuff that was going on from scene
to scene, especially the one where he catches up with a rolling 18 wheeler
on foot and finds the means to crawl from the spare tire rack to the front
of the trailer, all without being seen by the driver, or falling off.  I
found myself shaking my head from disbelief through most of the last half
of the movie.</P>
