The Cell
Reviewed by Christian Pyle
Directed by Tarsem Singh
Written by Mark Protosevich
Starring Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn, and Vincent D'Onofrio
Grade: D</PRE>
<P>It's probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre ("The 
Matrix," "eXistenZ") would collide with the even more popular serial-killer 
genre ("Kiss the Girls," "Se7en").  The result should have been more 
interesting than "The Cell."</P>
<P>As the movie opens, therapist Catharine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) treats a 
catatonic boy (Colton James) by entering his mind through some sort of 
virtual reality technique that's never fully explained.  After months of 
therapy sessions in a surreal desert, Catharine has no success to report.  </P>
<P>Meanwhile, killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) has claimed another 
victim.  His particular hobby is to kidnap young women, keep them in a glass 
cell overnight, and drown them.  He takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach, 
then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape 
of the drowning.  Although Carl's been doing this for awhile, he's recently 
become sloppy, and FBI Agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) is closing in fast.  
Not fast enough, though, to keep Carl from sticking another woman (Tara 
Subkoff) in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack 
that leaves him in a coma.  From the videos in Carl's house, Peter can see 
that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours 
after the abduction.  To save the kidnapped girl, Peter has to find the cell 
before the end of the day, and comatose Carl's not talking.  So off they go 
to Catharine in the hope that she can go inside Carl's mind and find out 
where the cell is in time.  </P>
<P>The focus of "The Cell" in on the ornate interior of Carl's mind, but the 
universe director Tarsem Singh creates seems more an exercise in 
computer-generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic 
personality.  For the most part, it's style without substance.  In his own 
mind, Carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes, Ming the Merciless, as 
well as a frightened boy (Jake Thomas) abused by his father.  All in all, the 
mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place, and I kept 
wishing I could fast-forward to the next development.  </P>
<P>Singh is best known for directing music videos, particularly REM's "Losing My 
Religion," and "The Cell" seems very much like a really long, really slow MTV 
video with the sound deleted.  Singer Lopez seems to think she's in a video 
as well; she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does 
to acting.  </P>
<P>The premise had great promise.  The computer-generated world within Carl's 
mind could have been a bizarre, surreal universe governed by insanity and 
symbolism rather than logic.  The first room Catharine enters in Carl's head 
shows this promise.  She finds a horse standing in center of the room; 
suddenly, sheets of sharp-edged glass fall into the horse, dividing it into 
segments.  The panes of glass separate, pulling apart the pieces of the 
still-living horse.  This scene is twisted, disturbing, and 
thought-provoking, because the psychological importance of the horse and its 
fate is left to the viewer to ponder.</P>
<P>Another element that should have been developed is the effect on Catharine of 
merging with the mind of a psychopath.  Their minds begin to bleed together 
at one point in the movie, and this should have provided an opportunity to 
discover the dark corners of Catharine's own psyche.  Like Sidney Lumet's 
"The Offence" or Michael Mann's "Manhunter," "The Cell" could have explored 
how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the 
investigator.   However, Catharine's character is hardly developed at all, 
and Lopez has no depth to offer the role.</P>
<P>Bottom Line:  Don't get trapped in this one.</P>
