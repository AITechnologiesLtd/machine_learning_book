<PRE>                        THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN
                       A film review by Eric Brochu
                        Copyright 1996 Eric Brochu</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Ron Perlman, Judith Vittet, Daniel Emilfork,
     Dominique Pinon
Directed by:  Marc Caro (artistic director) and Jean-  
     Pierre Jeunet</P>
<P>A circus strong-man named One breaks chains with the 
power of his lungs.  A street preacher proclaims the 
wonders of entering a cult whose members ritually blind 
themselves.  A greasy, opium-smoking assassin with a soft 
heart turns people into murderous zombies with flea-
delivered drug injections.  A group of clones sing a 
birthday song to a disembodied brain in a glass tank.  </P>
<P>Welcome to the bizarre world of _The City of Lost 
Children_, a stunning fantasy film from Jean-Pierre 
Jeunet and Marc Caro, the makers of the widely-acclaimed 
darkest-of-dark comedy _Delicatessen_.  If you've seen 
_Delicatessen_, you probably have some idea of what to 
expect from these brilliantly imaginative French 
filmmakers, and while I'm not sure it ultimately holds 
together as well as _Delicatessen_ does, _The City of 
Lost Children_ more than makes up for it in terms of 
sheer imaginative power.</P>
<P>The setting of the film is a port city somewhere in a 
never-never land equal parts Dickensian London, prewar 
Paris, and drug-induced hallucination.  The carnival 
barker announcing the strongman's show is stabbed, and 
when the strongman and his three-year-old brother return 
home that night, they are attacked by members of a child-
stealing cult known as the Cyclopes, who blind themselves 
and wear brass eyepieces to see electronically.  The 
strongman, One (Ron Perlman) gives chase but loses the 
gang.  The Cyclopes, it turns out, are stealing the 
children for the twisted Krank (Daniel Emilfork), who 
cannot have dreams of his own, and is forced to subsist 
on the stolen dreams of children.  </P>
<P>Krank is the creation of a scientist who has now 
disappeared, and he lives on a strange offshore 
laboratory with the scientist's other creations: a 
ruthless midget "princess" (Mireille Mosse); Uncle Ervin 
(voiced by Jean-Louis Trintignant), a disembodied, 
migraine-ridden brain, kept in a glass tank from which he 
speaks through a pair of Victrola-style speakers; and six 
dim-witted, narcoleptic clones (all played by Dominique 
Pinon), one of whom is convinced he is the original from 
which the others were made.  </P>
<P>The Cyclopes trade One's little brother to the clones for 
some of the electronic eyewear and ultra-sensitive 
hearing aids.  Meanwhile, One, searching for his brother, 
runs into Miette (Judith Vittet), a member of a band of 
child-thieves working for a pair of villainous Siamese 
twin sisters (Genevieve Brunet and Odile Mallet).  Miette 
gets One to help in a safe-cracking operation (he 
staggers out of the building with the massive safe in a 
wonderfully choreographed escape sequence), but then 
leaves her fellow criminals behind to join One in his 
search for his brother.  </P>
<P>I won't spoil the movie for you by detailing the twists 
and turns the plot takes and the other delightfully 
strange characters Miette and One run into, but rest 
assured they do meet up with Krank and his fellow 
experiments in a climax that is alternately hair-
raisingly creepy and gut-bustingly funny.  </P>
<P>_The City of Lost Children_ opens with a dream sequence.  
It's Christmas, from a small child's point of view.  
Santa Claus comes down the chimney, smiling and cherubic, 
and bearing delightful toys.  Then another comes down the 
chimney.  Then another, and another, and pretty soon the 
room is filled with Santas, some engaging in most un-
Santa-like behavior.  A reindeer relieves itself on the 
floor.  The child starts to bawl its head off, and the 
dream sequence ends.  This scene sets the feel of the 
film that follows.  _The City of Lost Children_ is 
littered with dark humour and oddball sight gags.  It is 
often hilarious, but there is a menacing atmosphere to 
many of the jokes.  Many of the sight gags involve the 
deformities of the characters; when one of the Siamese 
twins takes a puff on her cigarette, for example, the 
other coolly exhales.  Others involve oddly mechanical 
situations: one memorable scene involves a flying tear 
which sets of a chain of events that leads to the 
collision of a spectacularly massive ship.  The humour is 
imaginative and unapologetically idiosyncratic, and not 
for those who don't like their laughs mixed with a touch 
of dementia lurking somewhere nearby.</P>
<P>Caro and Jeunet have made the film a phenomenal visual 
experience, full of striking imagery.  It is beautifully 
shot by Darius Khondji (_Seven_), who uses unconventional 
camera angles and wide-angle lenses to bring Marc Caro's 
artistic vision to life.  Caro's wonderfully 
claustrophobic sets create a permeating sense of 
impending menace throughout the film: brick walls and 
fire-escapes have never looked so eerie.  Even the actors 
look perfect for the film.  Perlman's misshapen, but 
warm, features and impressive physique suit his kindly 
muscleman perfectly; as Krank, Emilfork is impeccably 
haggard and twisted; and Vittet, a strikingly pretty 
child with long black hair and unflinching countenance, 
looks simultaneously innocent and world-weary.  </P>
<P>While many Hollywood fantasies look either unimpressively 
pedestrian or get caught up in a series of over-designed, 
under-imagined spectacles that beg for the chance to awe 
you with their budgets, _The City of Lost Children_ 
manages to strike a perfect balance between dreamlike 
surrealism and real-world reference points.  There are 
very few films that can match _The City of Lost Children_ 
in the sheer power of its imagery, which I'm sure will 
stay with me for weeks.  Whether it's the sight of Uncle 
Evrin, the disembodied brain, wheeling towards an 
elevator at breakneck speed or Miette and One in a 
rowboat drifting through a fog-shrouded field of giant, 
floating mines, the images are consistently beautiful, 
strange and compelling.  It is easily one of the finest 
examples of Expressionist filmmaking on this side of the 
silent era.  In short, the film looks fantastic, in both 
senses of the word.</P>
<P>_The City of Lost Children_ also features first-class 
acting.  Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon, and Daniel 
Emilfork are all real pleasures to watch, and they all 
look like they're having a great time.  The real find, 
though is Judith Vittet.  I don't know how old she was 
when she made this film (she looks about ten), but she 
does a great job in a difficult, if somewhat cliched, 
role as a streetwise child who has built up a tired, 
cynical facade to mask her loneliness.  It is to her 
credit, and those of the other child actors, that they 
are never typical Hollywood kids; they are not 
wisecracking miniature adults or panderingly cute 
annoyances: they are people, and Miette and her fellow 
thieves are the most human characters of the film.  The 
filmmakers have obvious sympathies towards the children 
without making them into a transparently nostalgic vision 
of what an adult filmmaker _thinks_ kids in a film should 
be.</P>
<P>Alas, _The City of Lost Children_ isn't perfect, though 
its weaknesses are far from fatal.  Most notably, the 
film sometimes gets bogged down in its imagination and 
uses gorgeous imagery where plot might have been more 
satisfying in the long run.  The Cyclops cult, for 
example, is marvelously costumed and suitably oddball in 
behavior and belief, but while they are central early in 
the film, they disappear completely in the second half, 
without any kind of resolution.  They're never even 
mentioned: you're just left to wonder about them.  
Similarly, the explanation of what, exactly, Krank is 
doing when he steals childrens' dreams is so vague it 
simply left me scratching my head, which is quite 
unfortunate, as Krank's dreams are pivotal in the film's 
climax.</P>
<P>These criticisms, however, are tiny compared to the 
unique experience of seeing this exciting, funny, stylish 
film.  I rarely watch a movie a second time without a 
long period in-between, but I went to _The City of Lost 
Children_ two nights in a row.  The second time, I knew 
what was going to happen, so I just sat back and let the 
images wash over me, and I enjoyed it even more.  
Unfortunately, I'm not sure the dark splendor of _The 
City of Lost Children_ will survive being shrunk to fit 
on a TV screen; this is the kind of film that must be 
seen in the theater to really be appreciated on the level 
its creators intend.  Fortunately, I suspect it will 
become a staple of repertoire and "art house" theaters.  
If you have an opportunity to see this film in a theater, 
don't hesitate to do so.  Magic like this doesn't come by 
every day.</P>
