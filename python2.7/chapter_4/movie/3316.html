<PRE>                         THE QUICK AND THE DEAD
                       A film review by Rob Furr
                        Copyright 1995 Rob Furr</PRE>
<P>     I sail against the wind quite often, it seems, when it comes to
movies.  I actually liked SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, for instance, which
flopped, and I cannot stand the enormously successful EDWARD
SCISSORHANDS, a movie that I consider to be such an utter waste of
celluloid that I openly advocate using all existing copies to heat
homeless shelters in the New York area.</P>
<P>     I'm apparently sailing against a light breeze when it comes to Sam
Raimi's new movie, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD.  The overwhelming reaction
looks to be "Well, it's all right, if you like that sort of thing,"
said in a disparaging tone of voice, while I stand off in the corner
and say "It's all right, if you like that sort of thing" in an admiring
tone.</P>
<P>     From its opening frame, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD is clearly and
obviously a spaghetti western.  Like the movies that made Clint
Eastwood a star and Sergio Leone a legend, this film is set in a region
of the American west just south of Canaan and barely east of Hell.
Biblical overtones abound; the town where the action is set is named
Redemption, the primary antagonist is named Herod, and the only
righteous man in sight is not only a preacher, but is offered all the
kingdoms of the world during the course of the movie.  Like Leone's
movies, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD doles out its plot sparingly, and
instead presents us with memorable scum and finely calculated pacing,
and like Eastwood, the star of THE QUICK AND THE DEAD is left unnamed
for most of the film's running time.</P>
<P>     The plot of the film is as simply stated as that in THE GOOD, THE
BAD, AND THE UGLY.  There is an annual gunfighter's contest held in the
town of Redemption, it's sponsored by Herod, the gunfighter who rules
Redemption with an iron fist, and, along with the assorted scum,
Swedish fast-draw champions, and elegant fops with pearl-handled guns
who have been drawn by the promise of a prize of $123,000 to the
winner, a woman has come to compete, for an unknown reason.  Almost all
else follows from that basic concept; only one plot element is left
out: Herod has a pet project, an old associate of his who abandoned the
outlaw's life for that of a missionary.  Herod has a theory; once a
killer, always a killer, and the preacher is asked--forcibly--to
compete in the contest.</P>
<P>     That's it; a contest, a set of assorted killers, a reluctant
gunfighter, and a cipher, and once the pieces are in place, the movie
ticks along like the town clock that plays such an important role in
the film.  The key element of Leone's plots was always theme and
variations, and Raimi has taken that idea and distilled it down as far
as it will  go.  To my knowledge, no movies have ever included this
many classical face-off in the street gunfights, and none have ever
taken such pains to make sure each one is distinct and memorable.  The
pains are, in part, fruitless, because the middle of the movie does
drag a bit, somewhere around the seventh time the clock rings the hour
and someone gets shot, but the effort does show, and, for me at least,
is apprecated.</P>
<P>     The movie's weaknesses and strengths are the same: the actors.
Sharon Stone is wonderful for the first ten minutes and horrible for
five somewhere towards the end.  Gene Hackman is pretty good
throughout, but becomes wearing about halfway through, and only
recovers when he picks up his gun again.  Lance Hendricksen has several
fine scenes, but loses believability as he departs the movie.  The
acting is uneven, to put it mildly.  The cinematography and pacing
cover most of the real difficulties up, but the fact that they need
covering up detracts from the film.</P>
<P>     To return to my thesis; it is my belief that this movie "is all
right if you like this sort of thing."  If you like spaghetti westerns,
their simple plots and their spare characterization, their elegant
construction and their dusty world, you'll enjoy THE QUICK AND THE
DEAD, which is as typical of the form as any other movie ever lensed.
If you don't like the spaghetti western, you won't.</P>
<P>     Personally, I rate it as being a three-star three star movie (a
moderately ambitious movie that fulfills most of its ambitions
adequately.  The Furr Scale rates movies on ambition as well as
quality.  ROBOCOP is a four-star three star movie; a wonderful example
of non-epic moviemaking, while HEAVEN'S GATE is a one-star four star
movie; a film that tried to be majestic, sweeping, grand, and failed
utterly.  EVIL DEAD II is a four-star one star movie, and DAVE is a
two-star three star film.  I rate films this way because comparing the
rampant but hilarious idiocy of DUCK SOUP to the boring grandeur of THE
LAST EMPEROR.)</P>
