<P>The latest from Warner Brothers animation, "The Iron Giant", is a simply 
told fable that resonates with charm and humanity.  Based on the book "The 
Iron Man" by British poet Ted Hughes, the movie takes a new direction from 
Brad Bird, himself a former animator.  Bird's vision gives purpose and 
completeness to the movie, and the art style and direction strike the viewer 
with subdued power.</P>
<P>The opening shot shows Sputnik circling the Earth; the camera zeros in on 
the planet and zooms down into a storm, the title reading "Somewhere off the 
coast of Maine, 1957."  The animation style also hearkens back to decades of 
cartoons past, especially when the main character Hogarth Hughes (voiced by 
Eli Marienthal) darts into a diner where his mother Annie (Jennifer Aniston) 
waitresses.  When Hogarth's newly-caught pet squirrel escapes its box, we 
meet the beatnik-like Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jr.).  Dean is a starving 
artist who runs the local scrap yard, using metal to make his outré 
sculptures.  (As in many works of literature featuring a child, Hogarth's 
father is absent, only a photo visible of him holding a pilot's helmet.  Was 
he lost in Korea or some other conflict involving the Red Menace?)</P>
<P>A lot is made of Cold War politics.  One of Hogarth's comic books is 
actually called "The Red Menace," and government agent Kent Mansley 
(Christopher MacDonald) exhibits paranoia inspired by the times.  What 
sparks concern around this area of Maine is a report of some sort of giant 
from outer space.  Something is taking bites out of cars and silos and 
tractors, and this something Hogarth Hughes meets when one night his mother 
works late and he roams outside.  At a power station in the woods he 
encounters an enormous metal man that snacks on girders.  The giant suddenly 
gets caught in high-tension lines and, trapped, agonizes in apparent pain 
and alarm.  Frightenend, Hogarth first runs and then circles back to shut 
off the power, a la the mouse pulling the thorn from the lion's paw.  Later 
Hogarth discovers the creation is friendly, and the two form a friendship 
that Hogarth is careful to keep unknown to his mother and the town.</P>
<P>Because the giant needs metal for nutrition, Hogarth helps by directing him 
to Dean's scrap yard, and it's inevitable that Dean discovers the awesome 
visitor.  Bird does a wonderful job in portraying the shocked reaction, 
which elicits laughs from the viewer.  But Agent Mansley has rented a room 
from Mrs. Hughes, and while she is working late one evening, he plays the 
noxious role of sinister surrogate father.  He will get information about 
this giant at any cost, even is he must threaten taking Hogarth away from 
his mother.  The remainder of the film follows many of the alien fables we 
have seen already.  The innocent and misunderstood outsider is hunted.  
Fortunately, "The Iron Giant" plays variations on the theme, and the 
personality of the giant makes us feel much closer to him than to many of 
the "monsters" we have previously loved.</P>
<P>We witness some wonderfully silly routines, as when the giant imitates a 
crazy face and wiggly fingers done by Hogarth.  The giant is mimetic by 
nature, and he seems to have amnesia:  He does not know why he crashed to 
Earth.  Some of the most captivating moments occur when this gargantuan 
being is used for extremely human purposes.  Dean has him hanging entire 
wrecked cars from the arms of a mobile, while Hogarth plays with him 
hilariously, the giant spinning like a space-age merry-go-round.  The 
humanity evinced by the Titan - especially his relationship with Hogarth and 
later with Dean - is what endears him to us.  Further, just his appearance 
is cool.  Fifty feet tall, eyes glowing and rotating, squarish jaw like 
something out of an old Bugs Bunny, the giant takes over the screen whenever 
he appears.  His voice is supplied by Vin Diesel, and it is somehow enhanced 
into a raspy sigh.  Another feature that acts as remarkable foreshadowing is 
the ability of his mechanical body to reassemble itself if the giant is 
injured.  Even better is his ability to fly, the fiery thrust coming from 
the soles of his mammoth feet.</P>
<P>An important dimension the story carries is anti-violence.  Because Hogarth 
is gentle with the giant, and teaches him lessons about life, the giant acts 
gently.  "Souls never die" and "Killing is bad" are among the crucial bits 
of knowledge the robot picks up.  What leads to the climax of the narrative 
is most fascinating:  We see the metal man's eyes narrow down to red and 
angry apertures when he is threatened, and we wonder what will happen if he 
does not lapse into his forgetfulness.</P>
<P>The script could do without occasional bad language, including several 
vulgarisms and uses of God's name.  Although there is some violence toward 
the end, I'd venture that the PG rating would change to a G without these 
unnecessary epithets.  A viewer should not expect animation of the quality 
of the latest Disney offerings, though the clear lines and retrospective 
style get the job done with solidness.  And the direction compares with that 
of the best animated movies of recent years.</P>
<P>Our whole family attended the film, and all of us were laughing and moved by 
turns.  I would recommend "The Iron Giant" for any audience, and for what 
it's worth, I plan to buy the video when it's released.</P>
