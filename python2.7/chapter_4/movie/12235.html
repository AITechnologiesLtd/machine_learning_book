<PRE>REVIEW:  The Ice Storm</PRE>
<PRE>by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<PRE>4 stars out of 5</PRE>
<P>There is nothing more compelling then watching a think about it film; and its
obvious that director John Genry wanted to give us something distinguished to
contemplate in his latest epic The Ice Storm.</P>
<P>Set in the mutable period of the 1970s, sexual and sociable change takes place
between adults and children who dont realize the full repercussions of their
actions. Thus a storm brews, but this films focus is definitely not on the
harsh weather that adds to (but does not make) the icy cold feel from start to
end.</P>
<P>Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) is having an affair with Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver)
behind the back of wife Elena (Joan Allen), who is trying not to notice the
obvious signs that their marriage is falling apart.  Meanwhile their 14-year-old
daughter Wendy (Christina Ricci) is testing the limits of adolescents by
sexually experimenting with both Janeys sons Mike (Elijah Wood) and Sandy (Adam
Hann-Byrd).</P>
<P>Wendys older brother Paul (Toby Maguire) narrates the story, and at the same
time pursues his own sexual interests and desire to lose his virginity; chasing
a local girl with no idea how to achieve, well, what he is after.</P>
<P>When Ben and Elenas relationship begins to fall about, and they attend a
partner swapping party, many issues about a changing society are raised.</P>
<P>Sometimes the shepherd needs the comfort of the sheep, the town reverend
states to Janey. I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of
that, she replies.</P>
<P>A chain of events occur to all the main characters where they desire something,
yet their selfish cravings hurt others around them and cause breakdowns in
people  and situations (and very occasionally, the film).  Whilst these
character relationships can be crowned as The Ice Storms greatest asset, many
would also argue them to be its most obvious weakness.  This is due to the
shallow and emotionless feelings that the characters portray - its almost as if
John Genry wants us not to care for them.  If only he had taken the risk of
veering the plot off the straight and narrow path that The Ice Storm
continuously follows - perhaps then we would truly have a classic to be
remembered.</P>
<P>With the exceptions of Ben Hoods only outburst of emotion and relationship
problems between the married couples, the films unique style is often to avoid
direct conflicts between characters yet at the same time make the scenes feel
tense and neurotic.</P>
<P>Please dont get me wrong - The Ice Storm is a rare experience and its
excellence will appeal to many audiences, but if you are not interested in what
youve heard from me so far there is little chance that the film will please
you.</P>
<P>As to the amount of fulfillment the icy cold characters can give is purely a
matter of opinion.  I would, however, go as far to say that they appear to be so
emotionless that when the film rears its frosty behind into tragic and climatic
situations, we are left staring blankly at the screen, hoping that its next move
would be a show of emotion that lasts more than 30 seconds.</P>
<P>Thankfully, The Ice Storm never makes the same fatal mistake featured in films
such as Her Majesty Mrs Brown, where the films main focus is an attempt at a
loving relationship that ends up looking detestable and off putting.  No  this
film is put together carefully and sharply, where the main message is definitely
something intended to make you think.</P>
<P>Although the film ends up splintering itself by the very foundations that makes
it unique, The Ice Storm is an intriguing story of change and transformation
inside a world of harsh realities and consequences.</P>
