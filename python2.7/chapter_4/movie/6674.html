<PRE>               A film review by Walter Frith</PRE>

<P>Director Mike Leigh has the uncanny knack for making real life situations
about ordinary people sincere, heartfelt and entertaining.  His latest film
'Secrets and Lies' is no exception and could be the best film in Leigh's
career.  The movie is set in the U.K. and a young black woman named Hortense
(Marianne Jean-Baptiste) sets out to find her birth mother after she has laid
to rest her adoptive parents.  It turns out that her real mother Cynthia
(Brenda Blethyn) is a lonely, unmarried and pathetic woman who lives with her
resentful and hostile daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook).  Cynthia is
shocked in a very frightful way to receive a phone call from her long lost
daughter some twenty-seven years later and the two of them arrange to meet.
 Cynthia's brother Maurice (Timothy Spall) is a successful photographer whose
wife Monica (Phyllis Logan) prefers the finer things in life and her
materialism is an unfair quality to her husband who is a 'down-to-Earth' kind
of guy.  Their life is the sub-text of this movie and the two families are
interwoven in a blistering climax which plays out like a wonderful stage play
involving a quirky and confused cast of characters coming to grips with the
realities of life.  'Secrets and Lies' is one of the best films of the year
and proves that smaller films are sometimes better than the big budget
Hollywood offerings in which executives call the shots poorly rather than
filmmaker's like Mike Leigh who call them brilliantly.</P>
