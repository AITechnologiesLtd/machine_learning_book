<PRE>A film review by Chris Loar
Copyright 1998 Chris Loar</PRE>
<P>I went to see _Amistad_ expecting, from the reviews I'd read,
to find a film that was morally uncomplex, self-satisfied and
self-congratulatory, but nonetheless a well-told tale in the 
Spieldbergian tradition -- polished, well-acted, shining like a
new penny.  What I found surprised me on all counts.  For while
the film certainly has a self-satisfied tone, all aglitter with
pride in the traditions of the American legal system, there is 
more at work -- a happy depiction of cross-cultural respect and
understanding, certainly idealized and unrealistic but optimistic 
in a way a really self-satisfied tale can never be.  At the same 
time, the storytelling here is often severely disappointing; just 
enough of really fine filmmaking comes through to make us wish for 
more.  The film is, ironically, neither ill-intentioned nor
especially well-crafted.</P>
<P>The film, as most everyone probably knows by now, deals with an 
unjustly obscure event in our nation's history -- a slave revolt
aboard a ship (the _Amistad_) carrying recently-captured African 
slaves to the new world.  The film opens just as the revolt is 
about to begin; we watch as the leader of the revolt, Cinque
(portrayed with astonishing charisma by West African actor Djimon 
Hounsou) pries free from his chains and frees his fellow captives.
The prisoners take control of the ship, slaying most of their
captors in the process, and attempt to take the ship back to
Africa.  But their captors succeed in tricking them, and the
ship winds up off the coast of New England, where the Africans
are captured and put on trial for the murder of their captors --
and, more importantly, for their status.  For it's not clear
whether the Africans are legally property or free citizens,
a legal question first seized on by their lawyer, Baldwin
(Matthew McConaughey).  Working with a free black abolitionist
(Morgan Freeman), Baldwin works to establish a rapport with
Cinque, while trying to secure the expert legal support of the
once-brilliant attorney and former President John Quincy Adams
(Anthony Hopkins).</P>
<P>What follows is several hours of, essentially, a courtroom drama,
which culminates when John Quincy Adams argues the African's case
before the Supreme Court.  The courtroom sequences are, for the
most part, overlong and a little tedious, in my opinion.  Much
better are what breaks those sequences up -- the flashbacks which
show us Cinque's capture and some of the horrors of the Middle
Passage, as well as some fine scenes demonstrating Cinque's 
growing understanding of the American legal system, and his 
defenders' growing ability to see him as a real human being, rather
than a mere cause.</P>
<P>It's really not terribly hard to nitpick about the film's failings,
which are numerous.  Neither Hopkins nor McConaughey is especially
convincing as a quirky attorney; both actors' excessive reliance
on gimmicky tics and obvious eccentricities looks flaccid when placed
side by side with Freeman's easy solemnity and Hounsou's volatile
intensity.  And the story doesn't really give any single character
his or her due; instead, it lights on its characters like butterflies,
departing after an instant, leaving a tickle rather than a real
impression.  The plot also does at best a poor job of explaining why 
this case mattered as much as it did to abolitionists or Southerners
or anyone else; after all, the final verdict seems to have little 
enough bearing on the fate of slaves born into slavery.  And the John
Williams score, while fine in itself, feels intrusive and manipulative,
bursting in to cue our emotions in spots where the plot and characters
can't quite carry the moment.</P>
<P>These failings, though, don't ruin the movie, they simply turn what
could have been a compelling, fascinating film into one that is 
merely watchable and engaging.  For _Amistad_ is clearly worth 
seeing for its many virtues:  Djimon Hounsou's powerful performance,
its moving images of racial injustice and revolt, and its well-
intentioned (if flawed) depiction of cross-cultural communication
and understanding.</P>
