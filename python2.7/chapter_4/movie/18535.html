<P>   What would have happened if Lee Harvey Oswald missed? 
With JFK finishing out his term, the Vietnam War might have
been over almost before it began.  The hippie movement may
never have ushered in a massive challenges of authority,
and the U.S.--perhaps the entire Western World--might have
retained the innocence of the 1950s.  Go back a little further. 
What if Gavrilo Princip missed Austrian Archduke Franz
Ferdinand on June 28, 1914?  World War I could have been
avoided.  Russia would not have had a communist revolution. 
With Germany no longer needing to make up for its defeat,
World War II would not have occurred.  Amazing, isn't it,
what world-shaking changes could have taken place had the
aim of two mentally disturbed marksmen been a bit off?</P>
<P>   Getting down to a smaller scale, let's talk about you.  How
would you be different if you and your future spouse had not
bumped into each other when you were both crossing that
street after a day of shopping?  Or how about that time in
1993 when you called your broker and ordered 1000 shares
of plain old American Telephone and Telegraph instead of an
equal allocation of America Online?  If you had simply said
"AOL" instead of AT&T, you'd be driving a Ferrari today
instead of a Dodge Neon.  What a difference a day
makes.</P>
<P>   And what a fascinating idea for a movie!  "Now I long for
yesterday" has been the theme of two fairly dependable films
recently: Peter Howitt's "Twice Upon a Yesterday" and Maria
Ripoli's "Sliding Doors," and some years back the subject of
the hilarious Bill Murray vehicle, "Groundhog Day."  But none
of these three predecessors shares the particularly dynamic
style of Tom Tykwer's incredibly fast-paced "Run Lola Run,"
which was justifiably a favorite at its North American
introductions at the Toronto Film Festival in 1998 and more
recently the Sundance Festival in Utah.  Though a bit of a
stretch, call this presentation the human equivalent of Anakin
Skywalker's pod race in George Lucas's "Phantom Menace,"
in that its central character spends a good deal of her time
running--not like a yuppie jogger but as though her life
depended on her velocity.  And indeed, her boy friend's
existence does depend on her ability to accelerate on foot
from 0 to 20 with scarcely a moment for a breather.  Like the
aforementioned movies, "Lola" has multiple outcomes--three,
in fact--in each case its title character entreating the gods to
get it right (like Bill Murray, Gwyneth Paltrow, Lena Headey
and Douglas Henshall in the aforementioned movies) and
yield the happy ending we in the audience wish for its
likeable characters.</P>
<P>   Write-director Tom Tykwer opens his swiftly-paced work by
quoting a few philosphers' takes on the meaning of life, then
kicks a metaphoric soccer ball into the heavens to start the
fun.  Lola (Franka Potente) receives a frantic phone call from
her boy friend, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), who is desperate. 
Through his sheer, bubble-headed ineptitude Manni, who is a
courier for a gangster, has mislaid a bag full of money that he
is scheduled to deliver to his boss in just twenty minutes.  If
he cannot come up with the 100,000 marks, he will be killed. 
Somehow he trusts his girl to dig up the booty within that
span of time and save his life.  If Lola does not show up real
soon, he will rob the supermarket across the street.</P>
<P>   The story is told three separate times.  In each case,
something different happens to Lola that has a marked effect
on the outcome of the story.  Each time she asks her father,
a high-ranking bank executive, to give her the sizable amount
of money.  And each time the result is distinctive, profoundly
altering the course of the endeavor.  While Franka Potente,
with her flaming red hair, is the center of the film, director
Tykwer does some interesting stuff with the side characters. 
Just as Lola's course of action in each take leads to a distinct
outcome, so the activities of the people she literally runs into
cause a kaleidoscopic array of aftermaths.  But Tykwer
flashes these hypothetical consequences before us so quickly
that if you blink you will miss what is conceivably the most
original and hilarious parts of the film.</P>
<P>   In a director's statement, Tykwer announces his intention. 
"I always start with the image...I start wanting to get it
moving, to build a story around it and then make a film out of
it....it's when people move that they express things: despair,
happiness, or whatever."  In other words, Tykwer believes as
many of us do that the last thing we want to see in the
movies is talking heads--which is why photographed plays so
often fail when adapted for the screen.  </P>
<P>   "Run Lola Run" is loaded with cinematic effects that in the
hands of someone less professional than Tykwer could have
come across as the work of an NYU film student: jump cuts,
rapid pans, changes from video to film stock, and the
interjection of animation that clones the activities of the real
human beings.  All of this works well because Tykwer has an
uncanny ability to manipulate these images and what's more
he has composed a thumping soundtrack that causes a film
already on steroids to pump up the audience heartbeats.  </P>
<P>   While "Run Lola Run" is to a great extent a director's film,
Tykwer could not have succeeded as he does without the
electrifying young Frankie Potente whose painted, raggedy-
Ann hairstyle could capture the attention of a teen audience
just as the entire work secures the regard of film buffs of all
ages.  Distinguished Internet critic James Berardinelli says in
his review, "it's the most fun I have had at any movie thus far
in 1999."  Amen to that.</P>
