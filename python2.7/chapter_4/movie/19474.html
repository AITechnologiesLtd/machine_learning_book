<P>As I watched "Entrapment" I found myself wondering if Sean Connery could 
estimate the quality of a script he was shooting.</P>
<P>If he can, he surely realized this one was mediocre.</P>
<P>It's the story of Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery), called "Mac."  He's a 
world-class art thief, and the insurance company that covers the stolen 
works is very upset.  Waverly Insurance employs an expert, Gin (Catherine 
Zeta-Jones) to analyze his methods.  Overzealous, Gin is granted permission 
actually to track down Mac, in London.  The old and wily thief is soon on to 
her, but she convinces Mac she is a sort of double agent, a thief herself 
only posing as an expert in solving crimes by dismantling them.  Soon she 
and Mac land at his remote castle on the coast of Britain, where they 
rehearse the methodology of this particular crime - the stealing of a golden 
Chinese mask.  With daring skill they break into an enormous manor, and Gin 
begins her practiced body movements to elude the lasers that would trip the 
alarm.  Watch these scenes for Zeta-Jones doing her martial arts of 
elusiveness, bending and twisting along what seems to be an open floor.</P>
<P>After this caper is successful, the control of the criminal duo shifts.  Now 
Gin seems to be the one manipulating "Mac," and as they travel to Malaysia 
to engineer the scheme she has created, a romance clearly begins to develop. 
  The climax of the film is a high-tech bank heist on the crack of the new 
millenium, and indeed the high points of the story include the actual 
robberies I've described.</P>
<P>But there are too many low points for the film to take its place as anything 
more than a minor espionage flick.  Connery is a masterful actor, and 
Zeta-Jones holds her own opposite him, except during occasional bouts of 
adolescent anger.  What these players are working with is not enough help.  
The cuts are often too fast, and director Jon Amiel does not allow adequate 
time for the development either of character or of meaningful relationships. 
  Will Patton is miscast as the honcho from  Waverly insurance:  he's given 
a darkened mustache and Hispanic name, Hector Cruz.  Ving Rhames sketches 
his character - Thibadeaux, apparently a right-hand man for Mac - with 
authority and menace, a performance that is effective but perhaps too easy 
for the physically imposing actor.  (Someone, please cast this wonderful 
presence against type!)  The film does benefit from changes in scenery, its 
international locales lending variety and at times stunning beauty.  But are 
these elements enough to salvage a film that tries to draw its strength from 
the oldest tricks in the spy/thief genre?  And yes, we know early what's in 
store for us - as many turnabouts of identity as can be packed into a plot, 
some of them downright red herrings.</P>
<P>"Entrapment," a solid one-word title, is passable entertainment, but I would 
suggest seeing it as we did, in a second-run theater.  You'll like the 
gadgets and the figurative meanings that reflect about the screen like 
deflected lasers.  But you'll also sense the places responsible for 
mediocrity</P>
