<P>  Would you believe that disco is dead?  The clubs with long
lines of people who had to beg the bouncers to admit them;
the pulsating music that took the hordes of young far from
their daily troubles; the throbbing rhythms that propelled John
Travolta into stardom with his great film "Saturday Night
Fever," now a mere historical curiosity making way for his
darker, more cynical works.  It's gone the way of the cha cha. 
Or has it?  In the final scene of "The Last Days of Disco," last
year's meditation on the dance phenomenon, writer-director
Whit Stillman gets a contemporary subway car to its feet,
passenger by passenger rising to boogie, then an entire
station on the New York transit swinging to the beat.  If the
clubs are boarded up or metamorphosed into shopping
centers filled with stores like P.C. Richard and Kmart, the
music in our minds remains, a lasting tribute to the 1980s
phenomenon that captured youthful hearts and minds
throughout the west.</P>
<P>   This introduction might serve as a model of what a movie
about the country's most notable disco should elicit by its
conclusion: an excitement in the audience, a feeling that,
"Hey, the music, the dancing were great!  Maybe we'll come
to our senses and revive the delirium that defined the era?"
Unfortunately Mark Christopher, who wrote and directed "54,"
is not sure what he wants to do with the material.  Loosely
constructed as a series of incidents in the life of a rising
young protege of "54" impresario Steve Rubell, Mr.
Christopher's movie at times looks like a parody of the era, at
other times like a celebration of a period haplessly gone by. 
Trash bags full of money turn up from time to time with only a
smidgen of evidence of how this much cash changed hands,
but most important the film does not make clear exactly how
its narrator and central character rose from a New Jersey
working-class boy to a semi-celebrity of New York's nightly
social scene.  There is an a hint of how his sexual chemistry
gave him all the push he needed to transform his life. No
sooner does any sensuality hit the screen than Alexander
Gruszynski's camera pans away to introduce the next
vignette.</P>
<P>   The fictionalized story of how Studio 54 changes the life of
one young man opens in a small New Jersey town just three
miles across the water from the Manhattan which few of its
residents seem ever to visit.  When 19-year-old Shane
O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe), his curly blond hair newly coiffed by
some small-town Vidal Sassoon, hitches a ride across the
river with two friends, he finds himself just outside the
entrance of the famed Studio 54 where Steve Rubell (Mike
Myers) himself, aided by a bouncer, makes careful picks as to
who gets admitted.  When Shane gets the thumbs up and his
two friends dismissed, we get the earliest hint of a chemistry
between him and Mr. Rubell.  Asked to remove his shirt to
display the body of Michelangelo's David (according to one
female admirer) he ascends the hierarchy to bartender and it
is in that position that he, by adding assorted pills to the
patrons' drinks and by performing services not clearly defined
by the movie, begins to acquire heavy cash with his growing
fame.  But he never quite loses his working-class roots and in
one case, at a Park Avenue party, he becomes the butt of
jokes by patronizing richniks, one of whom calls him a
troglodyte (which Shane thinks is a compliment).</P>
<P>   Shane's female side, Julie Black (Neve Campbell), is a
soap-opera performer eager, like Shane, to use whatever
charms she has to rise in her career, obviously not stopping
at the bedpost on the way to the ladder.  In her case just as
in his, director Christopher barely hints at the intrigue as
though he wants to give Shane and Julie the benefit of the
doubt--to allow us to assume that pure looks and bauble were
enough to make their calling a success.</P>
<P>   Nor do we get to see much dancing. Compare "54" with
"Dance With Me" for an indication of how a story--not
necessary a great one--can feature both hot dancing and a
semblance of chemistry from its stars.  For all of Ryan
Phillippe's good looks, he is oddly uncharismatic, and Mike
Myers, in portraying a man who electrified the disco scene
like no other in his time, performs the role as a man
perpetually on downers.  </P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 89 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
