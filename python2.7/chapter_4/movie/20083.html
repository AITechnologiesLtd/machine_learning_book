<PRE>IN SHORT: Slam dunk good flick.</PRE>
<P>What do you get if you take a Farrelly Brothers movie, strip it of the
sex and the more gruesome physical gags (y'know, like a fishhook through
the face) and cast Alec Baldwin in a supporting role as a blue collar
foulmouth whose nickname for his eldest son is unprintable on these
boards?</P>
<P>You get a very funny coming of age movie, that's what you get.</P>
<P>To be historically accurate, Outside Providence is based on a novel
Peter Farrelly wrote before he and brother Bobby hit it big with flicks
like Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary. As always, no
reference is made to the Source Material, which director Michael
Corrente picked up for a buck at a used bookshop. ...</P>
<P>Set in the Pawtucket, Rhode Island of 1974, dopehead Timothy Dunphy
(Shawn Hatosy) cheerfully helps his wheelchair bound brother Jackie
(Tommy Bone) deliver newspapers while their three legged dog, Clopsie,
limps behind them. With his equally vacant friends Dunphy smokes dope,
hangs out, talks big about girls (though the entire bunch is inept) with
a mouth which his mom would've washed with soap, had she not blown her
brains out a couple of years earlier.</P>
<P>OK, now that we've scared away half of my readers, Cranky'll take aim at
those of you that liked Mary...</P>
<P>Outside Providence, lacking the really cheap humor of There's Something
About Mary, replaces it with something even more interesting. A solid
story, with character development, terrific performances and a moral
ending. Yep. Surprised the hell out of me, too. Not only is Outside
Providence downright funny, it has a moral! Dunphy actually goes through
the kind of character transformation that film students and critics
like. Topping even Shawn Hatosy's performance is the outstanding
best-of-the-year quality work from Alec Baldwin.</P>
<P>After sneaking his bong out of the house -- Dunphy tells his old man
it's a musical instrument, and only the old man's poker buddy Joey
(George Wendt) knows better -- the losers hit the local disco, hit the
bong, and hit a parked police car. Dad ships Dunphy off to a prep school
where it's graduate or go to jail. While you may think this "blue collar
guy in white collar world" has been done to death in other teen flicks,
it is here that a substantial and very sweet story kicks into gear. Most
of the gross jokes fall by the wayside (though one particularly
revolting bit involving spaghetti up a nose will thrill teenboys) as
Dunphy meets, falls for and wins the much smarter, much richer and much
prettier Jane West (Amy Smart).</P>
<P>Yep, opposites attract. That this mook can win the heart of a preppie,
destroy her carefully planned future, regret his actions and make it all
better yields a really sweet love story. That it all came out of the pen
of Peter Farrelly is the bigger surprise. I grudgingly admitted to
liking There's Something About Mary, though Kingpin and Dumb and Dumber
were utterly tasteless and revolting, which is what they were supposed
to be -- not to my taste.</P>
<P>Outside Providence is better than good. It delivers an  excellent story
and great performances by relative newcomers Hatosy and Smart. Baldwin
gets a place on my year end list and George Wendt will surprise the heck
out of all of you. This is a top notch movie, though if you have
problems with four letter words, consider yourself warned.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Outside Providence, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$6.75</PRE>
<P>Damn fine movie. To make an good thing even better, the soundtrack (not
only in the film, but on the CD you'll shell out cash for) is filled
with absolute killer kuts of the 70s: The Who; Paul McCartney and Wings;
The Eagles; The Doobie Brothers; Yes; Badfinger; Free; and the best
track Lynyrd Skynyrd ever graced FM radio with ('cuz I played it daily
back when I was a DJ). For a full songlist and discount purchase option,
