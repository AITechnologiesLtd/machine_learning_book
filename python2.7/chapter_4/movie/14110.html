<P>_Let's_Talk_About_Sex_ (R) no stars (out of ****)</P>
<P>Let's not.  Troy Beyer's directorial debut (she also wrote and stars)
offers plenty of the bawdy talk the title promises.  But it's wrapped
around a load of dreck.  Advice columnist Jazz (Beyer) aspires to be a talk
show hostess, and the candid woman-to-woman interviews she shoots for an
audition tape send Jazz and her two roommates, Lena (Randi Ingerman) and
Michelle (Paget Brewster), on that dreaded "journey of self-discovery"
traveled in too many independent films.  Jazz unlocks a secret trauma that
keeps her from committing to her perfect man (Joseph C. Phillips); slutty
Lena realizes she just wants to be loved; bitchy Michelle realizes that her
coldness comes from fear.</P>
<P>And the audience, what does it discover about these characters?  They're a
bunch of crybabies.  Make that just "babies," because the duct-challenged
Beyer, Ingerman, and Brewster cannot muster a single tear between them,
which is a glaring problem once the film settles into its almost laughably
dissonant tone: raunchy interview segments alternating with soppy,
melodramatic crying scenes that sent my eyes rolling.  The film's
hilariously overblown housework-as-grieving climax, complete with cleanser
cans being thrown in frustration, has to be a cinema landmark of some sort.
 As for the film's purported insight into female sexuality (most of the
interviews are done with real people, not actors), to me it seems that
Beyer simply chose the most outrageous segments for inclusion in the film,
rather than the most honest.  Terrible writing, terrible acting, terrible
direction--terrible film.  (opens September 11)</P>
