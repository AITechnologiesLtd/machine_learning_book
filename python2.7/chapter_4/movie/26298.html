THIS IS SPINAL TAP
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ****</PRE>
<P>THIS IS SPINAL TAP, the original mockumentary being re-released to 
theaters and with a new DVD out, has been called one of the funniest 
movies ever made, an accolade with which I wouldn't argue.  Still, it 
has a wonderfully droll sense of humor that may not appeal to everyone.  
Audiences at the film's initial test screens back in the early 1980s 
were quite negative.  They didn't understand that the film was 
satirizing rock documentaries, so they complained that the filmmakers 
should have found a better band or a less obscure one.  Of course, the 
band, which mimics bad-boy groups like KISS, is a fictional one, not an 
obscure one, and it is supposed to be awful.</P>
<P>Directed by Rob Reiner, who plays fictional documentarian Marty DiBergi, 
THIS IS SPINAL TAP is a deliciously witty comedy that mocks the world of 
rock.  Reiner shares the writing credits with Christopher Guest and 
Michael McKean, who play lead guitarists Nigel Tufnel and David St. 
Hubbins, and with Harry Shearer, who plays bass guitarist Derek Smalls.  
The entire film is an ensemble piece with a terrific supporting cast 
which includes Billy Crystal, as a loquacious mime, and Fran Drescher, 
as a pompous party hostess.  Guest, of course, went on to become the 
king of mockumentaries as the writer and director of WAITING FOR GUFFMAN 
as well as his most recent effort, the marvelously funny BEST IN SHOW.  </P>
<P>THIS IS SPINAL TAP includes some hokey old black-and-white television 
clips of the band when they were just a bunch of dorky boys with bowl 
haircuts, light-years from their current long-haired sophistication.  
Quite an informative documentary, we learn that the group's first name 
was "The Originals" until they found out that some other group had that 
name.  They changed their name to "The New Originals," so as not to 
conflict, but the original Originals changed their name too.  And so 
forth.  (I saw the movie at a theater across the street from a 
restaurant called "Original Joe's," but let's not go down that path.)</P>
<P>The movie follows the band on a disastrous tour of the United States, as 
cancellations abound.  Playing in tiny halls, the group's manager, Ian 
Faith (Tony Hendra), does his best to put a positive spin on low 
attendance.  "The band's appeal is becoming more selective," he explains 
to Marty.</P>
<P>The beauty of the acting is the way everyone treats the story with 
deadpan seriousness.  When shown music critics' reviews of their work 
that include words like "ponderous," "pretentious" and much worse, their 
only reaction is that their detractors are just "nit-picking."</P>
<P>In a film this funny it is hard to pick out favorite parts, but two have 
become comedy classics.  When asked the secret of their success, Nigel 
points to the band's amps.  Known as the loudest band around, Spinal Tap 
has amplifiers whose dials go to 11, whereas others only go to 10.  
Marty tries to point out the logical flaws of this to Nigel, but he 
might as well have been talking to the proverbial wall.</P>
<P>The other incident of monumental merit involves a little known 
scientific fact about human combustion.  For some reason the band's 
drummer position is jinxed.  Their first drummer died in a tragic and 
mysterious gardening accident that the police recommended against 
investigating.  Their most dramatic drummer death occurred on stage, as 
the lad exploded, leaving only a small stain behind.  Calmly and 
earnestly, David tells Marty, "Dozens of people spontaneously combust 
every year, it's just not widely reported."  Quite a science lesson.  </P>
<P>It's too bad they didn't make a sequel.  The band sketched out some of 
their plans for the future with the centerpiece being a rock opera about 
Jack the Ripper.  It could have been even bigger and "better" than 
"Springtime for Hitler" from THE PRODUCERS.</P>
<P>THIS IS SPINAL TAP runs a fast 1:22.  It is rated R for language and 
would be fine for teenagers.</P>
