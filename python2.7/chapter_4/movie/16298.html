<PRE>It Happened One Night (1934)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 65</PRE>
<P>"It Happened One Night" was a great commercial and
critical success for Director Frank Capra.  The romantic
comedy was a box office hit, and took the four most
important Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director,
Best Actor (Clark Gable), and Best Actress (Claudette Colbert),
as well as for adapted screenplay (Robert Riskin).
The film continues to be very highly regarded today.</P>
<P>The story has Colbert just married to famed aviator
King Westley (Jameson Thomas) whom her father (Walter Connolly)
despises.  Connolly interferes with their marriage,
abducting her and seeking an annullment.  Colbert
escapes, and flees to New York and Westley on a bus,
where she meets smug reporter Gable.  Gable, in need
of a big story in order to reconcile with his editor,
makes a pact with Colbert to help her reach New York.
Predictably, romantic sparks fly between Gable and Colbert.</P>
<P>"It Happened One Night" is a good film, certainly better
than the average comedy.  The dialogue between Gable
and Colbert is often entertaining, especially when
he teaches her how to hitchhike.  Colbert is engaging
and sympathetic, while Gable is a capable comic actor.
But the film has its share of problems, which keep it
from being the outstanding film that it is generally
considered to be.</P>
<P>The film begins with Colbert's father holding her
captive against her will on his boat.  I have always
considered this to be kidnapping.  Ellie escapes, and
her father sends a fleet of detectives after her.
What if they caught up with her?  Would she be dragged
kicking and screaming into a waiting limousine?  Despite
his tyranny, Connolly is presented as a sympathetic
character. It is understandable why he dislikes Westley,
but why is he so anxious that Colbert marry Gable instead,
whom he has met just once, and when he knows that the
two have already quarrelled?</P>
<P>Why is Colbert's trip to New York such a huge story?
The film features a half-dozen different front page
headlines, each in screaming type.  The highs and lows
of the Colbert-Gable romance coincide with the hate/love
relationship between Gable and his newspaper boss
(Charles Wilson).</P>
<P>There is a song performed on the bus, "The Daring Young
in his Flying Trapeze."  Everybody on the bus loves
the song, when assumedly half of the passengers would
be trying to get some sleep.  Various passengers, strangers
to each other, take turns standing up and singing different
verses, which they do flawlessly and with matching hand
gestures.  The bus driver gets so excited by the song that
he drives off the road.</P>
<P>There were overall qualities about the film that I also
disagreed with.  The film is essentially a depression-era
fantasy for women, with heroine Colbert achieving
independence from her fabulously wealthy father while
exchanging uptight husband Westley for dashing Gable.
While similar themes has been put to good use, for example,
in "A Room with a View", here the characters are more
shallow and the audience manipulations are more blatant.
"It Happened One Night" also falls prey to the Hollywood
canard that people fall in love with each other through a
series of arguments.</P>
<P>Of course, it is possible that I am overly critical,
and carry a grudge against crowd-pleasing romantic
comedies.  Certainly most viewers have found this
to be a better film than I have given it credit for.</P>
