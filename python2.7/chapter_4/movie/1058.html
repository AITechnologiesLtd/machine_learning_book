<PRE>                            TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY
                       A film review by Roger Snappy Rubio
                        Copyright 1991 Roger Snappy Rubio</PRE>
<P>Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, and
          introducing Edward Furlong
Produced by Gale Anne Hurd
Written by James Cameron and William Wisher
Directed by James Cameron</P>
<P>     Kudos!  Kudos!  James Cameron has done it again.  All the rumors
about its humongous budget and all the hype about its special effects
have paid off.  This movie is a well done, well executed action
adventure movie worthy of "sequelizing" the first one.  The effects are
great, the action scenes are great, and the acting is great.  All in
all, one hell of a movie!</P>
<P>     TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is a sequel to the surprise hit of 1984,
THE TERMINATOR.  As the rumors of the budget of TERMINATOR 2
skyrocketed, the budget of THE TERMINATOR seemed to get more and more
insignificant (its budget was only $17 million, whereas T2's budget was
somewhere near $88 million).  THE TERMINATOR was a movie that got by not
only because of its special effects, but because it used them
effectively and it had a good plot to go along with it.  This has been
the major factor in the success of Cameron's movies.  Special effects
don't do it alone.  And this movie does not skimp on them.  They were so
amazing that I think I will devote a whole paragraph to them!</P>
<P>     TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is the continuing story of Sarah Connor,
who now has a son, John.  In THE TERMINATOR, she learned through Kyle
Reese (Michael Biehn) that the world is going to experience a nuclear
holocaust on August 29, 1997.  Since her encounter with Reese and the
T800 who was trying to kill her (to put it delicately), she has been
plagued by visions of the destruction to come.  She has been devoting
all her efforts to her son, to get him ready to be the ultimate rebel
leader.  In the process, she has gone mad, and has wound up in a mental
institution.  John is placed with foster parents, and has gone about his
own business, alienating himself from them.  Meanwhile, two Terminators
are arriving on the scene: a T1000, a new prototype sent by Skynet to
kill John Connor this time, and a T800, sent by John Connor to protect
himself as a child.  They both eventually find John, and then the sparks
begin to fly.</P>
<P>     TERMINATOR 2 is clearly a film aimed at promoting world peace.  If
it wasn't, the movie would only take about an hour and thirty minutes to
tell (as it is, the movie lasts two hours and twenty minutes).  Half of
the movie is devoted to the conflict between Sarah, John, the T800
(Schwarzenegger), and the T1000 (Patrick), and the other half is devoted
to Sarah's dealings with the destruction to come from the coming nuclear
holocaust.  In fact, the T1000 drops from the scene for a spell so the
film can focus on the holocaust.  Another aspect that promotes peace is
the "kinder, gentler" cyborg image of Schwarzenegger.  Cameron and
Schwarzenegger both feared that if the T800 was portrayed as a killing
machine again, it would ruin Schwarzenegger's present image of a
wholesome, humane muscleman, so they decided to present him as a
"learning" Terminator, who could adapt to human traits.  But for all you
die-hard action fans, don't let this get you down.  T2 certainly
delivers with flying colors.</P>
<P>     I believe Robert Patrick was an excellent choice for the T1000.  He
has what I would call a sort of 'neutral' looking face.  He can look
non-threatening and menacing at the same time.  He has this evil air
about his looks, and it makes him perfect for this role.  Arnie has
changed a lot from what he used to look like in the first movie, but he
manages to pull off the coldness of the first T800.  Linda Hamilton has
almost gone through a metamorphosis due to her character's changes in
this movie, and she executes them expertly (she's come a long way from
that soft little waitress in T1).  Edward Furlong does pretty well as
John Connor, considering Cameron's casting director found him playing
baseball at a Boys Club in Pasadena.  I thought if anything was going to
be wrong with this movie, it would have to be Furlong, but he did very
well for his time.  Overall, the acting was pretty good.</P>
<P>     The storyline is, of course, predictable.  But don't let that fool
you.  It's the execution that makes this movie so good.  All the action
scenes in here get you to thinking, how in the hell did they do that
one?  It's not like these type of scenes haven't been done before, but
there are a few that make you wonder how they did it without anyone
getting killed.  They are not overtly amazing, but they do have their
baffling qualities.  And all this talk about time travel and such; this
movie is only going to feed the fire.  But that's good--it's not often
that a movie like this one becomes a topic for household conversation.
Someone must be doing something right!</P>
<P>     And believe me, they are.  Everyone was saying ILM, ILM, ILM.  They
didn't do it alone, but when you see the movie, the only thing you tend
to notice IS the ILM effects.  ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) was
responsible for the amazing computer graphics effects that make the
T1000 so menacing.  ILM had the enormous task of animating pure liquid
metal (which is what the T1000 is made out of) and boy did they do a
number on this film!  This movie left me with my chin in my lap and
dragging out of the theater.  The most common question I asked
throughout the entire movie was 'how the hell did they do THAT?!?'  The
computer graphics were astounding, superb, and out of this world.  It
made the pseudopod in THE ABYSS look like a stop-motion Godzilla effect.
I'm sure potential Wall Street investors will have no qualms about
investing in the giant that is ILM.  You have to see them for yourself.
And if you're not impressed, then you are probably one of the guys who
worked on the film.</P>
<P>     Enough said, this is a definite must see.  Don't see it to
criticize it, don't see it casually, and don't see it alone.  This movie
is one to be experienced, not just seen.  If I seem ecstatic about this
movie, then it's because I am.  I can just see the 1991 Oscars now:  And
the Oscar for special achievement in special effects goes to...guess
who!</P>
