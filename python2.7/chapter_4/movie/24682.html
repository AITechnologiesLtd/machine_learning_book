A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE (1951)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>People, as well as institutions, often become victims of
their own triumphs. World of cinema doesn't lack such
examples. Many artists suffer because the rest of their,
otherwise good, career gets unfairly compared with their
single and often accidental masterpiece. Great movies often
get so praised only to have their reputation declining when
they fail to meet big expectations created by overzealous
critics and film scholars. In may ways, this phenomenon
occurred with A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, powerful
"Oscar"-awarded 1951 drama, directed by Elia Kazan. Half a
century after its premiere the original power of the film
declined, being diluted with numerous parodies and homages
(the latest being Almodovar's TODO SOBRE MI MADRE), and many
talents associated with this film slid into relative
obscurity, not being able to repeat its success.</P>
<P>The film is an adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize winning 1947
stage play by Tennessee Williams. Plot is set in the French
Quarter of New Orleans where Blanche DuBois (played by
Vivien Leigh), small time schoolteacher and daughter of once
wealthy land-owning family from Mississippi, comes to calm
her nerves, stressed after the loss of family property. At
least, this is the story told to her sister Stella (played
by Kim Hunter) who seems to be happily married to Stanley
Kowalski (played by Marlon Brando) brutish, uneducated
working class Polish American. Blanche, posing as refined
aristocrat, simply can't stand ape-like Stanley who, in
return, can't stand ageing southern beauty that brought
discomfort to his harmonious marriage. Friction between the
two rises as times go by, and intensifies with Stella's
pregnancy, Blanche's seduction of Stanley's shy and
mild-mannered best friend Harold "Mitch" Mitchell (played by
Karl Malden). When Stanley discovers some unflattering
details of Blanche's past the conflict would reach its
violent climax.</P>
<P>A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE is often viewed as one of the most
important milestones in the history of American cinema.
Based on the powerful play, but also a very controversial in
its time, this film introduced some topics that used to be
taboo in Old Hollywood - female sexuality, nymphomania,
domestic violence and, finally, rape. Even after being
thoroughly reviewed by censors (who did everything to tame
the raw and shocking original, including removal of all
references to homosexuality), A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE was a
film quite shocking for its time. Director Elia Kazan, known
for the groundbreaking character of his socially conscious
films like GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT, also used this film as an
opportunity to comment on the social conflicts in post-WW2
America, when the romantic visions of American rural and
WASPish past clashed with down-to-earth reality of
industrial, urbanised and multicultural present.</P>
<P>This film wasn't groundbreaking just in the reality it
presented; it was also groundbreaking in the way it
presented such reality. Kazan was fortunate to master the
play on the stage and twice fortunate to bring most of the
original stage cast for the film adaptation. Among them
excelled the actors who had embraced the new Method style of
acting, so popularised by Kazan in his films. The best known
was, of course, Marlon Brando. When we look into his first
major film role, the intensity of emotions displayed and raw
strength of performance seems earth shattering in comparison
with everything Hollywood had to offer before. For the newer
generations, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE is an excellent
opportunity to see young Brando, quite different from the
roles he played in last few decades. His role of Stanley
Kowalski was for many years considered the best in his
entire career, until, of course, Don Vito Corleone in
Coppola's GODFATHER changed all parameters. In this film
Brando doesn't just show a very complex character; he also
revolutionises the way male sexuality is displayed on
screen. His biceps's, lustful looks and tendency to have
bare chests explain why Brando happened to be one of the
first major female heartthrobs of 1950s America - something
almost inconceivable today, when we picture as nothing more
than overweight eccentric caricature of himself. Brando was
also fortunate to have some of his stage partners back on
screen. Kim Hunter is marvel to watch, as a woman caught
between conflicting loyalties, troubled by her social
obligations and obvious and very primordial lust she feels
for her husband. Unfortunately, she didn't manage to build
equally impressive career on her "Oscar"-awarded triumph.
Karl Malden, another member of the original cast, again
proves his excellent qualities of character actor in the
role in the role of deceived, shy but still most likeable
character; his performance was also awarded with "Oscar".</P>
<P>But the most memorable (and most parodied) performance of
them all belongs to Vivien Leigh. Her role of Blanche
dubious was often portrayed as a parody itself; the
character of aristocratic Southern belle strikes certain
resemblance to Vivien's Leigh best known incarnation in GONE
WITH THE WIND. But this resemblance are only superficial -
Blanche DuBois is much more complex, troubled and fragile,
and her once all-conquering beauty and irresistible charm is
rapidly becoming the thing of a past. Leigh made a terrific
job of detailing her gradual, but inevitable decline into
madness. This "Oscar"-awarded performance becomes even more
devastatingly powerful when we take into account that the
real life of an Vivien Leigh in later years in many ways
resembled the life of the character.</P>
<P>Thanks to the excellent text and superb actors, Kazan
managed to create a very good film, but he still failed to
turn it into genuine and everlasting masterpiece. Kazan
worked very hard to improve the stage production with the
benefits of the new medium, but A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE
still looks less like an original film, and more like a
stage play adapted for screen. Almost entire film takes
place in very limited space, and the scenes that show the
outside seem to come out of the picture. With a film almost
exclusively concentrated on the four major characters,
anyone else is distracting, even the boy whose brief
appearance would trigger some well-hidden impulses in
Blanche. The musical soundtrack by Alex North, although
revolutionary for Hollywood through its use of jazz, isn't
particularly impressive. Finally, modern day viewers simply
couldn't avoid noticing some rather awkward treatment of
some grim subjects due to the different censorship
standards. A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE is nevertheless still
essential film for anyone who wants to be familiarised with
20th Century cinema.</P>
