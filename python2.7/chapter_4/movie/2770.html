                - Czerny to Ford</PRE>
<P>     Continuity buffs can rejoice at the return of Jack Ryan in CLEAR
AND PRESENT DANGER, the third Tom Clancy adaptation behind THE HUNT FOR
RED OCTOBER and PATRIOT GAMES.  Back is second-star Harrison Ford
(after Alec Baldwin).  Back is second-director Philip Noyce, who helmed
the horrendous PATRIOT GAMES.</P>
<PRE>     And, surprise, the film is good.  Very good.</PRE>
<P>     The story sees Jack stepping into the shoes of his boss (James
Earl Jones), the Acting Deputy Director of Intelligence.  Conflict
comes when Ryan's White House "buddies" won't let him in on a little
secret--the fact that President has given his round-about
authorization to a covert military operation against a Columbia drug
lord (Sandoval).  (Said czar murdered a friend of the President (Donald
Moffat) that is a very bad thing to do.)</P>
<P>     So, when the operation inevitably goes from worse to up doo-doo
creek, Ryan finds out too much, too late.  And he blows.  His.  Stack.</P>
<P>     CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is a big, loud, military movie, brimming
with bombs, and jets, and Coast Guard cutters, and aircraft carriers,
and, of course, stone-faced soldiers carrying flag-draped caskets.
Just the way that Tom Clancy writes 'em, and just the way co-writer
John Milius scripts 'em.</P>
<P>     Like THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, the cast is filled almost entirely
by solemn, serious-looking men who spend all of the their time making
Important Decisions without every cracking their countenance.  Ford,
Moffat, Jones, Harris Yulin, Henry Czerny, Joaquim de Almeida, Raymond
Cruz, Miguel Sandoval, and Willem DaFoe make up *the* best boys club of
the summer.</P>
<P>     (Best of the bunch in Harris Yulin as the President's Chief of
Staff.  His silence speaks volumes.  But what's Dean Jones doing here?)</P>
<P>     The film has a good pace, despite the mildly confusing plot.
Those who haven't read the novel (or seen a good spy movie lately) may
need to take notes.  The politics are also very good and, even though
the bad guys *do* get theirs, the film is remarkably devoid of any
gratuitious violence.</P>
<P>     Too bad that everything is played way-too-straight.  CLEAR AND
PRESENT DANGER is about as rigid as they come and, under the
unexpectedly tight reigns of Noyce, allows almost *no* room for
levity.  James Earl Jones gets to show all of two smiles, and Harrison
Ford loosens up some, and that's about it, and that's a shame.</P>
<P>     CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is too long and too literate to be a
toss-away actioner, but, with a little added "breathing room" for the
characters, could've been on *heck* of an epic.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:  Twice as good as PATRIOT GAMES, but lacks the slick sheen
              of THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
<PRE>.
