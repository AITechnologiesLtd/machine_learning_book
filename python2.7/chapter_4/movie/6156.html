<P>     THE GRASS HARP is a truly inoffensive picture, and that's part of 
its problem.  Here, as is often the case, "inoffensive" equals 
"ineffectual" -- at least something that offends rarely provokes yawns.  
With a raft of bland characters and situations, it's difficult to summon 
up much feeling regarding anything that happens on screen.  So, when 
director Charles Matthau turns on the shameless manipulation near the 
end, his attempts to wring tears result in dry eyes and bored 
expressions.  </P>
<P>     Choppy editing has something to do with it -- THE GRASS HARP is not 
put together with much concern for elegance or coherence.  The 
irritating, all-pervasive voiceover narrative (spoken by Boyd Gaines) 
shares equal blame.  In fact, there are times when the movie demands the 
latter because of the former.  Ultimately, however, most of the 
information imparted by Gaines is redundant and pretentious.  He says 
things like "Nothing mattered to her so much as the owning of things and 
people" and "I tried to look pitiful because I knew it pleased people."</P>
<P>     THE GRASS HARP is told from the point of view of 16-year old Collin 
Fenwick (Edward Furlong), an orphaned boy who began living with his 
fathers' cousins when he was 11.  He is the lone male in a house of 
three women.  There's Verena (Sissy Spacek), a humorless, mousy woman 
whose entire life is devoted to making money; Dolly (Piper Laurie), an 
insecure dreamer who is intimidated by her sister, Verena; and Catherine 
(Nell Carter), Dolly's devoted friend.  </P>
<P>     A crisis brews when Verena and Dolly argue, and Dolly decides to 
leave home.  Collin and Catherine accompany her, and the small group 
decides to hide out in a nearby tree house.  It doesn't take long for 
word to get around town that they're there, and soon outcasts from the 
area seek out their companionship.  Judge Cool (Walter Matthau), 
regarded as senile by his family, is the first to join the gang.  He is 
followed by a rootless young man named Riley (Sean Patrick Flannery) and 
an unmarried, itinerant woman with fifteen children (Mary Steenburgen).  
When the sheriff (Joe Don Baker), instigated by Verena, arrives to 
disband the company, things turn ugly.</P>
<P>     THE GRASS HARP, which takes place in rural Georgia during 1940, 
tries for the feel of FRIED GREEN TOMATOES.  Much like this year's THE 
SPITFIRE GRILL, it succeeds only on a superficial level, failing to 
harness the deeper emotional currents of Jon Avnet's 1992 picture.  And, 
although THE SPITFIRE GRILL is clearly flawed, it promotes better 
character identification than THE GRASS HARP.  Here, when the inevitable 
death occurs, it's not as painful as it could, or should, be.</P>
<P>     THE GRASS HARP is far more effective at delivering light humor than 
drama.  The brief exchange between old screen buddies Walter Matthau and 
Jack Lemmon is delightful, as are almost all of the scenes featuring 
Mary Steenburgen.  Aside from Steenburgen's promiscuous revivalist and 
Matthau's judge, however, none of the characters are especially 
interesting.  Dolly, whose transformation from meekness to self-
sufficiency represents the story's fulcrum, is played with such reserve 
by Piper Laurie that she often fades into the background.  Sissy Spacek 
isn't given much to do other than look pinched and act crotchety, and 
Edward Furlong is his usual one-note picture of surliness.  Only Walter 
Matthau, acting under his son's direction, exudes life and energy.  I 
would have enjoyed seeing more of the judge; everyone else is 
forgettable.</P>
<P>     The story related by THE GRASS HARP is nice enough, but it doesn't 
amount to much.  For this kind of drama to succeed, we need to develop 
more powerful feelings than those engendered by Dolly, Verena, and 
Collin.  The title is said to refer to the sound made by the wind 
rustling through fields of uncut grass -- "a harp of voices telling 
stories."  I just wish the story related here had been about a more 
compelling group of characters.</P>
