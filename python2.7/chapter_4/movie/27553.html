<PRE>Mary Marry Me
The Wedding Planner</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Well, it's certainly an attractive money making idea. Put man-magnet, 
Jennifer Lopez (I don't know any guy who doesn't find this woman 
perfectly cute and sexy) in a chick flick and release it in January. 
Every 12 to 22 year old of either sex is going to see this movie. And 
they won't be disappointed. They might not be thrilled, but they won't 
be disappointed. </P>
<P>Jennifer Lopez plays Mary Fiore, the ultra-organized-organizing wedding 
planner who can produce the perfect social event for anyone, except 
herself. She's the bride's coach, counselor and spiritual advisor to 
boot. Having faith in the concept of arranged marriages, her Italian 
father tries to marry her off to the young pizano she grew up with back 
in the homeland (Italy ... surprise). Meanwhile, Jennifer gets her shoe 
stuck in the middle of the street and falls in love with a handsome 
passerby. It's actually a very sweet scene from slapstick action to 
charming dialogue. And the children (that follow) in the hospital back 
it up 100%; sorry to see them leave the film forever after just one 
scene. </P>
<P>Later, Jennifer and bo share two or three "old movie cliche" scenes that 
just stop the picture in its tracks. These sequences feel horribly 
"added later" as if the writers were trying to create a nostalgic homage 
sympathetic to the old black and white reel playing on their first date. 
Unfortunately, it doesn't work. "I don't even know your father's first 
name, but I know the curves on your face." Yikes ... that scene is as 
bad as a later bride/groom pre-wed chat scene is fresh. </P>
<P>Here's a mild spoiler ... err, ah, the guy she literally "falls for" is 
the fiance of the woman who's hired her to plan the wedding. This sticky 
news sets up the conflict for the rest of the film. </P>
<P>Popeye would have loved Penny, Jennifer's assistant in plandom. Judy 
Greer nails this bumbling Olive Oil sidekick role. </P>
<P>Basically, "The Wedding Planner" is a sweet love story hampered by 
contrived conflicts. Lopez and McConaughey act very well and create 
great chemistry. A good portion of the dialogue is superb, the direction 
and editing very skilled; however, less than interesting portions of 
script were unfortunately never omitted. Especially after a crisp 
appealing first third, expect some serious downtime between peaks. 
Overall, a light night out. </P>
