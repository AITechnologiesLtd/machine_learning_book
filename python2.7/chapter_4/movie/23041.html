<P>I think it was director Quentin Tarantino who once related the experience of
watching a movie with an umbilical chord attachment to the screen. You see,
the chord apparently remains attached until "something" in the movie just
cuts it off, after which point, it is all but impossible to re-attach, and
your "relationship" with the film ends. This film had my chord attached till
about 3/4 of the way through but then...snip-snip!</P>
<P>PLOT:
A young American looking for adventure in Bangkok gets a hold of a secret
map to a paradise island and takes a couple of French friends along for the
ride. Once at the island, all is well among the community of folks lucky
enough to have found this utopian garden, that is...until things don't go so
well!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
The excellent showing by DiCaprio and the slick soundtrack don't take away
from the fact that this film starts off strong, slows down considerably
during its median and just goes kinda cooky in the end. For DiCaprio, one
can't really blame the kid for choosing this project over all others after
his gigantic TITANIC success. It doesn't pander to his teeny-bopper
followers or exploit his good-looks, it delivers a decent premise and many a
dark undertone, and it even sets him up with the hip director of
TRAINSPOTTING...so what's the problem? Well, it looked to me like the film
just didn't know what it wanted to be. Was it an action-adventure? Hmmmm,
not really. Was it a romance? Well, a little bit, but then not! Was it a
thriller? Not really, but there were a couple of thrilling scenes. It's hard
to say. Of course, none of this would really matter if the film's many
facets worked together to form a cohesive and entertaining whole, but
unfortunately, this film just slips up right under the wire. In fact, the
sudden "twist" near the end of the flick just kinda "lost me", on top of the
lingering pace once they had settled in at the island. Some people might dig
all that, but for me, it just felt a little ackward. Although I did enjoy
the "video game" sequence (you'll understand if you see the film).</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong, I'm into surrealism as much as the next guy, but after
waddling through what seemed like over an hour of "look how happy we all are
to be in paradise!" exposition, I was just expecting a little more out of
this film. But on the positive tip, this movie was packed with gorgeous
shots of places that we all wish we were at right now, moves along a little
smoother under the electro-sounds of the film's groovy soundtrack and
presents us with an actor by the name of Leonardo DiCaprio in top form! It's
good to know that he's still the great actor that he was before that damn
boat sunk his career into a professional abyss. Welcome back, dude. Having
said that, it's actually pretty hard to define the type of moviegoer that
would thoroughly enjoy this film, since it does meche many different styles
into one. Adventure fans might like some of it, romance seekers might enjoy
parts as well, a little drama, a little comedy. Hard to pinpoint. Of course,
most Leo fans should dig it just for his solid presence, but then again,
would those same people appreciate the HEART OF DARKNESS undertones?
Probably not.</P>
<P>All in all, this movie succeeds in style, music and Leo, but ultimately
fails to string along a story good enough to warrant a hearty
recommendation. Entertaining for a while, but faulty overall.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Leonardo DiCaprio's middle name is Wilhelm. That name comes from his German
mother's side, who apparently experienced a sudden kick from her unborn
child while enjoying a DaVinci painting at the Uffizi. Hence his first
name...Leonardo. His father was of Italian heritage, a comic book dealer,
but his parents got divorced only a year after his birth. At the age of
five, Leo was on his favorite kid's TV show, Romper Room, where we was
nearly tossed off for misbehaving. A great professional move on his part
came when he turned down the opportunity to play Robin in the Batman flicks.
Leo received $2.5 Million for his role in TITANIC, and about $20 Million for
his role in this movie.
French actress Virginie Ledoyen has been acting since the age of 11. She was
recently signed on as a L'Oreal celebrity model and nominated as "most
promising young actress" at the 1996 Cesar Awards. This was the first
"english" film in which both she and her French co-star Guillaume Canet had
ever been a part.
Reports of problems with the filming of this movie in Thailand were running
rampant over the past year. Another film which also ran into a multitude of
problems while filming was Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW, a movie that is
actually featured in a scene in THE BEACH. A respectful homage, I am sure.
This film is based on the novel written by first-time author Alex Garland,
who is only thirty years old.</P>
