<P>     Norman Rockwell would not approve of what the movies are doing to
Thanksgiving.  Once upon a time, the fourth Thursday in November was the
place where Americana accumulated:  loved ones, football games, a golden
roasted bird and pleasant conversation.  That was before the idea of a
stable, happy family became tres declasse.  A couple of years ago,
director Jodie Foster depicted a Midwestern family dissolving under the
stress of being HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.  This fall, no fewer than three new
releases -- THE ICE STORM, THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS and THE HOUSE OF YES
-- are turning Turkey Day into Dysfunction Junction.</P>
<P>     At least Mark Waters, screenwriter and director of THE HOUSE OF YES,
seems to understand that the recrimination-filled holiday gathering has
already become a film cliche.  THE HOUSE OF YES is a black comedy not at
all concerned about making its family feuds a touch surreal.  Those feuds
involve the Pascal clan of Washington, D.C., and they take place on
Thanksgiving day 1983.  The year is significant because it marks the 20th
anniversary of the assassination of President Kennedy, a date which holds
even more significance for the Pascals than for most Americans.  You see,
it was on November 22, 1963 that Papa Pascal disappeared never to be seen
again, cementing the fixation of a daughter known as Jackie-O (Parker
Posey) with the widowed First Lady.  Jackie is equally obsessed with her
twin brother Marty (Josh Hamilton), who shakes up the family by bringing
home his fiancee Lesly (Tori Spelling).  While Mother (Genvieve Bujold)
doesn't try at all to make Lesly feel at home, and younger brother Anthony
(Freddie Prinze Jr.) tries a bit _too_ hard, Marty's attempt to find a
normal life begins to collapse under the weight of family secrets.</P>
<P>     Waters adapted THE HOUSE OF YES from a play by Wendy MacLeod, and you
can hear the theatrical roots in every line of dialogue.  Posey, Prinze
and Bujold exchange clipped quips with the practiced air of a company in
mid-run, lines building on top of one another at a dizzying pace.  Waters'
direction also tends towards the conventional, usually holding the speaker
in medium shot then shifting immediately to the next speaker.</P>
<P>     Ordinarily, a production this uniformly stagy would feel forced and
awkward on the screen, but not THE HOUSE OF YES.  As it turns out, this is
a story of overly dramatic people living a self-conscious soap opera.
Jackie-O performs every minute of every day, dominating the Pascal
household like a hammy actor dominates the stage, while her mother glides
in and out of rooms like a condescending WASP matriarch from central
casting.  Appropriately enough (if unexpectedly), Tori Spelling delivers
the film's most naturalistic performance; the rest of this clan is like
the Addams family, so immersed in their own singularly demented world that
they don't even see anything out of the ordinary.  The script also keeps
the wicked humor coming so regularly that you may not notice the arch
deliveries (or at least not mind them).  The dialogue is fast, funny and
quirky enough to defuse some touchy subject matter.  For most of the
film's running time, Waters refuses to treat the Pascals' family skeletons
as tragedies.  </P>
<P>     It's late in the film when THE HOUSE OF YES takes its most
ill-advised turn, going exactly the somber and serious route it had so
carefully side-stepped.  The last shot in particular seems to ask for a
careful psychological analysis, potentially rendering Jackie-O as a
guiltless, misunderstood victim.  It's a jarring miscalculation which
takes a satire of dysfunction dramas and turns it into something which
leaves a dysfunction drama taste in your mouth.  THE HOUSE OF YES should
have stuck with what it was doing best:  providing an alternative
Thanksgiving meal, something salty and bitter without a trace of
saccharine.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 family dinners:  7.</PRE>
