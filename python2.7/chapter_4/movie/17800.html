<PRE>HIDEOUS KINKY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Gillies MacKinnon's handsomely shot HIDEOUS KINKY contains enough lush
visuals to serve as a Moroccan travelogue, albeit one with a time warp.
Set in the middle of the hippie age, it brings us back to the free
spirited times of the flower children.  Kate Winslet, the chief hippie
in residence, plays a 25-year-old mother of two young girls, ages 6 and
8.</P>
<P>Although the images are sometimes quite compelling, the threadbare story
never is.  Billy MacKinnon's thin script is based on a novel by Esther
Freud.   She grew up in the same time and place (Marrakech) as the girls
in the story.   Her life may have been exciting, but almost nothing
happens in this movie.</P>
<P>Without much information, the viewers are left to piece together for
themselves what the director is trying to say.  The girls complain about
the lack of money, and Julia (Winslet) spends a lot of time going to the
post office, looking for the missing check from her husband back in
England.  This might lead us to believe that we are to feel compassion
for a single parent coping with poverty, but the effects of being
destitute are never made obvious.  Julia doesn't appear to be lacking
much since her needs and desires are so modest.</P>
<P>Perhaps the movie is about the effects of bad parenting since Julia does
a better job of loving her children than caring for them.  She makes
some dubious choices in raising them -- letting her 8-year-old go to
live with questionable strangers being at the top of the list.</P>
<P>The characters are all written so superficially that one can never be
sure what the filmmakers' intentions are.   Winslet tries hard to put
some life into her underwritten role, but she seems miscast.   Bella
Riza and Carrie Mullan do respectable jobs as her two girls, who are
sometimes more mature than their mother.</P>
<P>The film's title is completely misleading.  There are no hideous, kinky
sex scenes in the movie.  The title comes from the name of a game that
the girls play briefly.  A different title would have helped in
marketing the film correctly, but perhaps the current one will prove
more lucrative.</P>
<P>After a reasonable amount of time has elapsed, the picture comes to a
completely predictable conclusion.  As we leave the theater, we remember
the sights and sounds of Marrakech.  Nothing more of the story lingers.
None of the characters were interesting enough to care about when the
movie was on.  Now that it's off, they are quickly forgotten.  Still, if
you've been considering Morocco for your next vacation, this might be
just the movie for you.</P>
<P>HIDEOUS KINKY runs 1:38.  It is rated R for a little nudity, profanity,
and sexuality and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
