<P>It's difficult to put into words the kind of impact that a film like
Magnolia leaves you with. It's a film so beautiful, so profound, so
unexplainably exhilarating that you can't help but feel charged after seeing
it. But.....</P>
<P>Let's get one thing straight right off the bat: this is not a film for
everybody. Something happens at the end of Magnolia that will be talked
about and pondered over for years to come, dividing critics and public alike
into those who see no relevance in the event, and those who see it as the
most original and innovative sequence in recent movie history. Taken at face
value, it's a plot twist so arbitrary and outlandish that it's likely to
send a good deal of theater patrons out the door, laughing and clutching
their sides (at the screening I attended, a good percentage of the audience
walked out in such a way).</P>
<P>Although, once examined and taken into context with the rest of the film, I
can think of no better way to end the movie. And it is your tolerance of
this ending that will finalize your feelings about the film. However,
despite what your personal opinion of the movie may be, there is no denying
its originality.</P>
<P>Sure, the basic premise is familiar; chronicling 24 hours in the lives of an
assortment of San Fernando Valley citizens, Magnolia probably sounds more
than a bit like Robert Altman's 1993 film Short Cuts, another
three-hour-plus drama interlinking various, seemingly-unrelated characters
and events. But it's director Paul Thomas Anderson's style that sets this
film apart from it apparent predecessor. While Altman's film was bitter and
pessimistic, Anderson shows a great deal of affection for each of his
creations.</P>
<P>>From foul-mouthed sex guru Frank T.J. Mackey (an Oscar-worthy Tom Cruise)
and his dying father (Jason Robards) to a kind-hearted cop played by John C.
Reilly (who also starred in Anderson's other two features, Hard Eight and
Boogie Nights), every character in Magnolia is treated with the utmost
respect. Nobody in the film's huge cast ever falters, and Anderson leads
them with such a sure hand that it's no surprise that they make up the best
ensemble performance I've seen in years.</P>
<P>But this is so much more than just a film showcasing great performances.
Tackling universal themes such as forgiveness and redemption like no movie I
've ever seen (and probably ever will see), Magnolia is a very important
achievement in the art of filmmaking.</P>
<P>At one point late in the picture, a key character observes that "you may be
done with the past, but the past ain't done with you". While most movies
would simply address this theme by use of conventional standards, Magnolia
reaches for something more, and conveys its theme with all the intensity and
rage of a thunderstorm. Therein lies its brilliance.</P>
