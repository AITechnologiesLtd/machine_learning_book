<P>I found myself forced to fill in a questionnaire the other day, which at one 
point asked: "Are you offended by anything that offends good taste?" I had to 
answer no. While I do usually take a highbrow approach to things, there are 
no absolutes when it comes to possible emotional reactions. Sometimes it's 
healthy to view things from a low down and dirty point of view.</P>
<P>"Final Destination" proves my point. It's not a great horror movie, nor a 
scary one, and it doesn't even try to satirise its genre. It simply inspires 
its viewers to indulge lurid fascination with violence. I usually find that 
repellent -- look at my scathing reviews of "The Bone Collector", "Ravenous", 
"8mm" and "Urban Legend". What distinguishes this film from those is how 
up-front it is about its morbidity; it's unashamed Grand Guignol, rather than 
sick titillation pretending to be serious drama.</P>
<P>The story begins when a group of forty high-school students board a plane for 
Paris. One of them, Alex (Devon Sawa), has a vivid premonition of the 
aircraft exploding into flames after take-off. He freaks out trying to warn 
people, and in the ensuing commotion gets thrown off the plane, along with a 
teacher (Kristen Cloke) and five other students (Ali Larter, Kerr Smith, Chad 
E. Donella, Seann William Scott, Amanda Detmer). From the airport this group 
see that Alex was right -- the plane blows up before their eyes.</P>
<P>Are the survivors lucky? Well, no, because they soon start dying off anyway, 
and in a speech full of hammed-up grimacing and portentous groaning, a 
strange mortician named Bloodworth (Tony Todd) offers them an interesting 
theory as to why: In cheating death by getting off the plane, they've gone 
against the Grim Reaper's plan, and the creature is now stalking them to make 
up for it. All our heroes have to do is figure out the nature of this plan, 
and how to cheat it again. Ah, no problem.</P>
<P>It's unconventional to find a teen horror movie in which Death himself is the 
villain. Refreshing, too, since there is no opportunity for silly slasher-pic 
clichés involving friends creeping up on each other and causing false alarms, 
or moments where people creep around in the dark while a killer lurks in the 
shadows. Instead we get elaborate supernatural death traps, which are so 
twisted that our morbid curiosity is enthralled. I don't want to give too 
many specifics away, because the appeal of "Final Destination" lies in 
waiting to see how creative its moments of doom will get, but let me whet 
your appetite for their gleefully sadistic flavour: In one scene, a leak 
causes a kid's bathroom floor to get slippy, while he, unaware, uses a razor 
to nick a pimple from his neck, cuts his nose hair with a sharp scissors, and 
stands opposite a cord that could strangle him if he fell on it. We know he's 
going to die, we can see he's surrounded by potentially fatal objects, and we 
can't turn our eyes from the screen until we've seen him stumble into his 
demise.</P>
<P>This is of course sick, but it's fun, too, even after it's been repeated 
seven times. We leer at how gruesome the film is, allow ourselves to jump 
when death strikes, then laugh at ourselves for jumping. I suspect "Final 
Destination", unlike most horror movies, will not look dated in years to 
come, as it deals directly with the universally interesting theme of 
mortality. Okay, so it deals with it in a goofy way, but goofiness will live 
forever, too.</P>
