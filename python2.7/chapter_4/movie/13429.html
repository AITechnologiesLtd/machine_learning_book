      Be forewarned.</P>
<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS is one of the summer's early disappointments,
   an utterly pedestrian effort which plays it so safe that the stunt
   actors wind up taking more risks than the screenplay does.  It's an
   uninspired rehash of the old Bicker-Bicker-Bicker-Smooch formula, and
   even if the smooch here comes in the form of an homage to the famous
   FROM HERE TO ETERNITY beach clinch, the film's escapist plot barely
   contains enough viable material to sustain interest.</P>
<P>   Establishing scenes quickly introduce Robin Monroe (Anne Heche), an
   ambitious young associate magazine editor who's whisked away from
   Gotham for a romantic South Pacific vacation by her amorous beau
   Frank Martin (David Schwimmer).  After happily accepting a moonlight
   marriage proposal, Robin is summoned to oversee an emergency one-day
   photo shoot in nearby Tahiti and commissions laid-back charter pilot
   Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford) to take her there in his beat-up
   DeHavilland Beaver.</P>
<P>   Miracle of miracles, Robin and Quinn happen upon an unexpectedly
   vicious storm while en route, and are forced to crash-land the plane
   on a deserted tropical island after a lightning strike fries the
   aircraft's electrical system.  Stranded with no means of
   communication to the outside world, the squabbling pair are left to
   fend for themselves, while back at the hotel, Frank and Quinn's
   sultry young girlfriend Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors) fret, worry,
   and make eyes at each other.</P>
<P>   An unabashedly formulaic adventure-comedy backdropped by noteworthily
   lush scenery, the film is written at a TV sitcom-level and features
   individual scenes which play breezily and make for cute,
   trailer-ready excerpts, but fail to gel as a whole.  Our protagonists
   aren't confronted by sufficiently challenging or ingenious obstacles
   in order to pique viewer attention on the adventure front (it's
   telling that the two inexplicable appearances by pursuant pirates
   seems almost arbitrary), while the flirty banter zinging back and
   forth between the duo falls far short of being endearing, registering
   as cute at best.  And the less said about the vapid Frank / Angelica
   subplot, the better.</P>
<P>   Credit the agreeable presence of the film's two leads for salvaging
   the production to the point of watchability.  Mr. Ford and Ms. Heche
   share an easy, unforced chemistry, and are best as Quinn and Robin
   inevitably gradate from quarreling antagonists to mutual admiration.
   Mr. Ford has a pleasant charm about him; it's fun to watch him
   contort his deadpan face and dryly utter a sarcastic witticism, and
   Ms. Heche makes for a pleasantly feisty combatant.  The star power
   present easily surpasses the quality of the film's material.</P>
<P>   "Aren't you one of those Guy guys?" Robin demands of Quinn as they
   survey their bleak situation.  "You know, one of those guys who they
   send out in the jungle with a Q-Tip, and come back and build a
   shopping mall?"  And while Quinn rolls his eyes and demurs, it's a
   given with this sort of film that the hero ultimately does
   demonstrate some MacGuyver-like aptitude.  SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS
   handles this obligation with a hootworthy plot development in its
   homestretch -- the discovery of a handy piece of equipment so
   preposterous in its convenience that it deflates any sense of
   investment one may have built for the dilemma faced by our heroes.
   To unfairly drop a hokey pat solution from out of the blue places the
   entire proceedings in a dubious light.</P>
<P>   Michael Browning's screenplay for SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS faithfully
   abides by genre conventions, vaguely aping conflicts and scenarios
   from such predecessors as ROMANCING THE STONE and THE AFRICAN QUEEN
   (also, an early scene which sees Quinn prepping his creaky bucket of
   bolts and assuring Robin of its flightworthiness interestingly echoes
   to Han Solo doing likewise in STAR WARS), but for the most part, the
   snappily suggestive dialogue is forgettable and the strong narrative
   drive is lacking.  To its detriment, it's got all of the shadings of
   similarly-themed earlier works, but none of the spark.</P>
<P>   Director Ivan Reitman does what he can, treating the audience with
   panoramic tropical visions and keeping the proceedings moving along
   briskly.  It's surprising that such a big-budget Hollywood production
   features some startling artificial visual effects works, such as that
   of the storm sequence.</P>
<P>   Ultimately, SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS suffers because of its eagerness
   at palatability, its resolute target of mainstream appeal.  Absent of
   any flair or genuine excitement, the film trods through the
   conventions of a tired formula with little except the winning
   performances of its lead actors to garnish much attention.  "I want
   my life to be complicated," confesses Quinn at one point.  If only
   the film shared similar sentiments.</P>
