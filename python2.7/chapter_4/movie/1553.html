<PRE>                                INNOCENT BLOOD
                       A film review by Sean Eric Fagan
                        Copyright 1992 Sean Eric Fagan</PRE>
<P>     INNOCENT BLOOD started out poorly, in my opinion, with the leading
lady parading around her apartment in the nude (usually an inauspicious
beginning for a movie.)</P>
<P>     But it ended up being better than I originally thought it was going
to be (from the advertisements), and better than the beginning lead me
to believe it was going to be.</P>
<P>     Oh, it has lots of faults.  There are some inconsistencies in it,
which really annoy me (a couple of them could have been fixed by simply
removing a couple of scenes that didn't add much to the movie at all),
but there were not enough to make me decide I didn't like the film.  The
other really cheesey thing about it was the glowing eyes; the
commercials which had those made me think it was going to be a *really*
stupid movie.</P>
<P>     Well, it wasn't.  It wasn't a *great* movie, but I did manage to
enjoy it.  It could easily have been better, if, for example, the lead's
conflicts with her needs and her ethics had been dealt with more.  And
the ending leaves a lot unsaid (there are going to me *lots* of problems
about a week after the movie's ending, but isn't that always the case?
8-)).</P>
<PRE>     But I still liked it.  Definitely recommended for a matinee
showing.  Call it a +2 on a -5 to +5 scale.</PRE>
