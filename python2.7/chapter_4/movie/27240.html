<PRE>MISS CONGENIALITY
A film review by James Brundage

<P>It takes some doing to make a beauty pageant flick that features an
intellectually vapid caper plot while being a slap in the face to
feminism.  When asked (within the movie, I mean) to defend pageantry
from this accusation, Sandra Bullock simply shrugs it off and says,
"Well, they're not all airheads, and I've made some friends."  Forget
the fact that nine out of ten women in the film act like vicious bitches
to Sandra's character -- a New Jersey FBI agent named Gracie Hart -- and
shrug off the fact that each of the contestants is painted to have all
of the intelligence of a Pokemon character on a good day.  Never mind
all that.  Sandra has learned that beauty pageants are really
scholarship contests and really aren't harmful to feminism.</P>
<P>Miss Congeniality starts out with Gracie as a New Jersey kid kicking ass
on the playground and getting the obligatory "ugly duckling" bit when
she slugs a guy to protect a potential boyfriend -- only to be shunned
because she was too tomboyish.  Of course, the ugly duckling grows up to
be an adult tomboy (though a dead sexy one at that).  The portrayal is
stereotypical: frumpy hair, two dates to her name, a punching bag, and a
penchant for pints of Ben and Jerry's.  To her credit, Sandra Bullock
pulls off the deal pretty well, but how she can live with herself after
playing such an odious role is beyond me.  (She gets paid a lot of
money, that's how. -Ed.)</P>
<P>Gracie works at the FBI and, after a sting operation that goes slightly
sour after she saves a Russian mobster from choking, she's placed on a
desk job until a letter from a Unabomber-like terrorist called "The
Citizen" arrives, threatening the Miss United States beauty pageant. 
The horror!  Gracie promptly gets shipped off to Austin, Texas, where,
with the help of pageant consultant (imagine that on your business card)
Vincent (Michael Caine), she is turned into a prim and proper lady who
investigates the pageant by going undercover and becoming fluent in
Ditz.</P>
<P>Of course it isn't only the women in Miss Congeniality that get the
barbs.  All the male FBI agents are painted as ogling idiots, whereas
all of the other men in the story are either gay, androgynous, or
psychotic.  Think of it as Stereotypes for Dummies.  Hell, they even
throw in a finalist being pulled off the stage for admitting her
lesbianism.</P>
<P>To give the devil its due, Miss Congeniality may be just about the most
offensive flick of the year, but it also has something of an acrid wit. 
Bullock is actually watchable (unlike her normal tour de crap), and the
movie does have its share of barbs directed towards beauty queens, but
this is far outweighed by the fact that Miss Congeniality is just plain
nasty.  If you're going to be this offensive in a comedy, you know,
Chris Rock or John Leguizamo offensive, you have to attack the
stereotypes, not embrace them.  And it better be damn funny, too.  And
that Miss Congeniality ain't.</P>
<P>What the hell; if you're at your local multiplex and everything else is
sold out, why not brainwash yourself by revisiting the gender/role
stereotypes that people have been trying to kill for decades and watch
Miss Congeniality.  Or actually use your brain for once and see
something a little more intelligent.  Maybe try the Discovery Channel.</P>
