Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999)
A movie review by Joe Barlow</PRE>
<P>"Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo" tips its hand from
the moment the theater lights go down.  In the first two minutes
of the film, all of the following events occur: (a) our protaganist
appears, nude, in a public aquarium, thereby allowing us a glimpse at
his bare bottom; (b) an old lady falls down a flight of steps; and
(c) a young lady's t-shirt gets wet, exposing... well, the fact
that she's not wearing any undergarments, for starters.  Most bad
films take at least ten minutes to reveal their wretchedness, so
give the movie credit for revealing its complete lack of
intelligence up front.  At least this way the audience develops
no expectation of quality or entertainment value.</P>
