<PRE>THE MEXICAN
-----------</PRE>
<P>Samantha Barzel (Julia Roberts) throws a fit when she discovers that long-time
boyfriend Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) is delaying their plans for a Las Vegas
weekend in order to do a job for big boss Margolese (an uncreditted Gene
Hackman).  Sam makes good on her threat to head for Vegas on her own as Jerry 
heads south in search of a prized but cursed pistol known as "The Mexican."</P>
<P>Jerry begins a cycle of dumb luck followed by freakish fate by immediately
locating Beck (David Krumholtz, "Slums of Beverly Hills"), holder of the
infamous antique, in a Mexican dive, then losing him to a reveller's stray
bullet.  When Jerry checks in with Nayman (Bob Balaban), he finds out that
he's holding the dead body of Margolese' grandson.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Sam heads for Vegas and ends up in the crossfire between an elegant
Black stranger (Sherman Augustus, "Virus") who takes her hostage in a ladies'
room and Leroy (James Gandolfini, "The Sopranos"), a psychotic hit man sent
by Margolese to use Sam as Jerry's completion bond.  Leroy plugs the stranger
and begins a road trip with the feisty Sam - 'I'm just here to regulate 
funkiness' he tells her.</P>
<P>Director Gore Verbinski ("Mouse Hunt") seesaws back and forth between the
Mexican and US action as Jerry's travails resemble a human Wile E. Coyote's
while Sam and Leroy bond.  Verbinski struck pay dirt with his superstar
threesome, all better than the script warrants.  Roberts continues her
appealing, movie star, streak here and has loads of chemistry with her
costar Gandolfini.  Quite unlike the hit man he played in "True Romance," 
Leroy is a gay man (which Sam discovers fairly early on) dejected
by the lack of love in his life until Sam encourages a roadside flirtation.
Brad Pitt once again proves a real flair for comedy, able to elicit howls
of laughter with a simple 'Oh no!'  He has loads of chemistry with the
Mexican mutt who becomes his sidekick.  Roberts and Pitt have one of those 
'can't live with them, can't live without them' relationships which flare up 
into screaming matches every 5 minutes.  Roberts is the screamer, hurling such 
self helpisms as 'now you're blame shifting!' at laid back screamee Jerry.
(Too) much has been made of their lack of screentime together.</P>
<P>Technically the film looks (cinematography by Dariusz Wolski of "Dark City" and 
"The Crow") and sounds (original score by Alan Silvestri, "Cast Away") good.
The script, by J.H. Wyman, is problematic however.  While individual bits
play well enough, the film begins to drag.  Wyman gives his MacGuffin its own 
superfluous subplot (several different takes on the history of the pistol are 
shown in bleached out home-movie segments), which could have been jettisoned
entirely. The film comes to a natural conclusion point about thirty minutes 
before it has the good graces to end.  Then Verbinski and screenwriter Wyman 
positively betray the audience with their third act treatment of Gandolfini's 
character.  Any buoyancy and good will are lost at that point as "The Mexican" 
stumbles towards its finish.</P>
