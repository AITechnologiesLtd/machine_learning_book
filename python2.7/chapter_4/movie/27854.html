<PRE>"The Mexican"</PRE>
<P>Jerry Welbach is a hapless bagman forced to do the bidding of a prominent
mob boss. His years of indenture are just about over and he has one last
job - head south of the border and acquire a legendary pistol called the
Mexican. The only problem is his girlfriend Samantha (Julia Roberts). She
wants him to move to Las Vegas with her, now!, or get out of her life
forever in "The Mexican."</P>
<P>This much anticipated partnering of Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt has come
under some criticism because, for most of "The Mexican," they aren't even
together. And, when they are, much of the dialogue consists of Samantha
badgering Jerry in a shrew-like and shrill manner, making me wonder why
they are even together. Things change for the better when they go their
separate ways, but the film then suffers from its real problem - it's too
darn long for a light romantic comedy.</P>
<P>This is a problem that is not the fault of the two mega-stars. Roberts and
Pitt (along with a fine perf by James Gandolfini) do well enough, but this
major star power almost forces the filmmakers, led by director Gore
Verbinski, to create a two plus hour tome. As such, there is much padding
involved to stretch things out to the detriment of a tight, well-paced
story. In Hollywood, it is believed that the people want stars, not a
tightly told story, and that's what we get here.</P>
<P>When Jerry heads to Mexico for his one last job to locate the coveted
pistol, he is a real fish out of water. The unlucky mob courier sees his
little mission as a hit and run, where he does the deed and can get back to
Samantha to beg forgiveness. Once he lands, though, things could not go
more wrong as he gets the gun, loses it, gets it again, but loses his
passport, keeping him in country with no way out. His puppet master back in
the States, mob accountant Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban), for insurance, sets
one of his thugs to find Samantha and put her on ice until the gun is
delivered. Unknown to Jerry, Bernie is planning his own scam to wrest the
gun from his boss, Arnold Margolese (Gene Hackman in an uncredited cameo),
the man that Jerry caused to go to prison.</P>
<P>Paralleling Jerry's plight is the strong-willed Samantha's undertaking to
move to Las Vegas, get a job as a waitress and become a croupier at a
casino. When she hits the road, she finds herself in the clutches of a
vicious hit man named Leroy (Gandolfini). This becomes one of the movie's
brightest moment as the bad guy and his victim begin to bond, becoming fast
friends and confiding their deepest secrets. The chemistry between Roberts
and Gandolfini is palpable, sweet and entertaining.</P>
<P>Brad Pitt's Jerry is left to his own simple devices as he makes a journey
of both confusion and enlightenment. Pitt has always had a comic flair
(check his funny stoner perf in "True Romance") and is up to the task of
carrying better than half of the movie alone - well, he does have a bonding
relation, himself, with a big, scruffy dog whose favorite toy is a beat up,
deflated football. When he finally locates the prized pistol, in the hands
of Margolese's grandson, Beck (David Krumholtz), things go bad when the kid
is killed in a bizarre shooting accident. They get worse when Jerry's El
Camino, the body and the Mexican are stolen.</P>
<P>When Bernie learns of Jerry's dilemma, he thinks he is trying to pull a
fast one and sends a hit man, Jerry's friend Ted (J.K. Simmons), to bag the
bagman. The two stories - Jerry's plight and Samantha and Leroy's own
journey - start to cross paths, frequently, as poor Jerry struggles to get
himself and the gun back to the US while trying to save Sam from the
mobster. Jerry, it turns out, smells a rat in Leroy. There's a lot more
going on leading to the requisite happy ending.</P>
<P>As one expects with a big star vehicle like "The Mexican." No expense is
denied in the making. The production team essentially renovated the small
Mexican town of Real de Catorce to fit the film's needs and the look and
feel put you right with Jerry, south of the border. Stylish lenser Dariusz
Wolski ("The Crow") gives a separate color palate to each of the sequences,
with the flashback scenes to the making of the legend of the Mexican
handled particularly well. They have a look that gives the sequence a nice
period feel. The rest of the production equals the photography.</P>
<P>"The Mexican" is another case where the star power overwhelms the story,
making more not necessarily better. There is a logical ending at the
96-minute mark that would have, with a little work, tightened up things
considerably and made a better movie. As it is, the stars are entertaining,
Gandolfini is terrific and there is some good fun along the way. I give it
a B.</P>
