<P>There are two types of comedies coming out of Hollywood today:
adult-oriented star-vehicles and teen-oriented ensemble pictures. You
can say what you will about the preponderance of whining, post-modern
`Dawson's Creek' reprises stocking our airwaves and movie theaters, but
you can't say much at all about the vacuous one-trick pony known as the
modern Hollywood romantic comedy.  So I will keep my comments on THE
BACHELOR brief.</P>
<P>In full, the plot of THE BACHELOR is that Chris O'Donnell has 27 hours
to tie the knot, which would assure him of a $100 million inheritance
and cozy jobs for life for himself and all of his friends.
Unfortunately, he already monumentally botched his proposal to his
girlfriend, Renee Zellweger (I won't bother with character names here; I
didn't remember them, you won't either).  Wacky high-jinks ensue, and we
all hope desperately it will work out for the best between Chris and
Renee.</P>
<P>If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you've already sapped all of
the sentiment that you're going to get out of this vehicle.  In its
feature length form, THE BACHELOR throws in some awkward voice-over, a
trite recurring dream sequence wherein O'Donnell imagines himself a
mustang, and an apparently mute James Cromwell.</P>
<P>In a word, THE BACHELOR is insignificant.  No characters, no depth, no
theme, no message.  Even its intended witticisms fall flat.  (And by the
way, James Cromwell's *got* to say something.  He's the best actor in
the film.)</P>
<P>It's sad that the only comedies starring actors old enough to rent a car
these days can't seem to make it beyond a sales pitch.  Sadly, the
studios seem to think that a catchy plot point is more important than an
interesting plot.  Is this what the dumbing down of America has come
to?  I sure as hell hope not.  Wake up, America!  You deserve better
than this.</P>
