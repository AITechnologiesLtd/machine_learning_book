Days of Heaven (1978)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 93</PRE>
<P>The documentary "Visions of Light: The Art of Cinematography"
lavished more screen time on "Days of Heaven" than on any
other film, even going so far as to use the theme as the
final credits rolled.  It is easy to see why "Days of Heaven" 
was so honored: it is a great argument for cinematography
rather than script or story as the most important element
of a film (I still believe that the script is the most 
important element).</P>
<P>"Days of Heaven" has a minimalist script and relies upon
the camerawork to flesh out the plot.  There are many
distant shots of lush wheatfields, of migrant farm workers
earning their day's wages, of steam trains and thrashers.
There are also many close-ups, not just of the beautiful
cast (then unknowns) but even of grasshoppers munching.
The slow pace allows the cinematography to tell the story.
The shots become redundant only when depicting a wheatfield 
fire.</P>
<P>"Days of Heaven" takes place in the Texas panhandle area
during World War I.  Richard Gere stars as a hotheaded 
itinerant worker.  His lover is Brooke Adams, but for some 
reason they tell others they are brother and sister.  They 
work on the immense wheat farm of Sam Shephard, who has been
told he has but one year to live.  Shephard falls in love
with Adams.  Gere tells Adams to marry Shephard, with the 
intention of both inheriting his wealth after his impending
demise.  It would seem that all sides benefit from this
arrangement, except that Shephard isn't getting sicker,
and suspects that Gere and Adams aren't as they appear to be.</P>
<P>"Days of Heaven" was a project that took place over several
years.  One reason for this was the scenes included all 
four seasons, another was that most filming took place at 
dusk due to favorable lighting.</P>
<P>The cast, direction, cinematography and story are all
excellent and mark "Days of Heaven" as one of the most 
important American films of the 1970s.</P>
