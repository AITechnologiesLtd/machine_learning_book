<P>Well, trying to escape the ~90 degrees heat I sneaked into a local
multiplex that showed artsy films, and was pleasantly surprised at how
much I liked the film.</P>
<P>The movie is set in a forlorn town in Idaho, where two conjoined twins,
Blake and Francis (played by the Polish brothers, who also co-wrote and
directed the film as well), have checked into a ramshackle motel. Well,
Blake and Francis are literally joined at the hip and share three legs
and two arms between them.</P>
<P>Most of the story is narrated from the viewpoint of the beautiful
hooker (played by newcomer Michele Hicks), who has been summoned to the
brothers' room in the opening shot of the movie. Apparently, the
brothers are celebrating their birthday, and they have decided to give
themselves a gift on the occasion.</P>
<P>Understandably, startled by the brothers, and flees the room, but
returns to retrieve her purse and gradually warms up to them. She
learns that Francis is sick (but not Blake!!!) w/ flu, and manages to
get hold of a doctor to treat him.</P>
<P>Well, I won't describe what transpires thereafter as I don't want to
spoil the experience of those who haven't seen the movie yet, but
suffice it to say that plot isn't this movie's forte. The movie is rich
w/ visual metaphors like the two dollar bill, and in some ways, too
rich if you ask me.</P>
<P>The movie loses focus during the second half when it delves too deep
into the hooker's problems, but in my opinion, the sheer originality of
the film, and the first half, which offers some rather keen insights
into the twins' lives, well make it worth the price of admission.</P>
