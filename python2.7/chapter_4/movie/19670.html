<PRE>Review by Eric Robinette
<A HREF="mailto:SirCritic@aol.com">SirCritic@aol.com</A></PRE>
<P>Having dealt with the major issue at hand, Sir Critic's attention turned to
another film closely associated with "The Phantom Menace"-"Austin Powers: The
Spy Who Shagged Me." Since the trailer suggested "If you see only one movie
this summer, see 'Star Wars.' But if you see two movies, see 'Austin Powers.'"
Sir Critic decided to take that advice.</P>
<P>"How on earth do you review a film that defies criticism like this one does?"
the other critical types asked the knight.</P>
<P>"It's very simple. You simply ask, 'Is it funny?' and since this is a sequel,
"Does it live up to the original?" My answers are 'yes' to both questions.</P>
<P>"Simply put, if you liked the first movie, you are bound to like the second. It
is more of the same juvenile/pop culture humor, done on a slightly larger scale
since they had a slightly larger budget. The scenes with Dr. Evil and the
crowd-pleasing Mini-Me are especially funny.  Mike Myers ought to be careful,
or Austin himself may fade from the picture.</P>
<P>"The major flaw of the film is that it relies a little too much on toilet
humor; the character of Fat Bastard was not amusing, but simply gross. I would
have run him through with my sword given half the chance. Gross by itself is
not funny, although I did like the series of jokes using different nicknames
for a certain unique part of the male anatomy."</P>
<P>The other critics cautioned, "Wait Sir Critic. You must imitate the language of
Austin Powers in a review. That is required by law."</P>
<P>"Oh behave, my friends, I'm far above that sort of thing."</P>
<PRE>He paused.</PRE>
<PRE>"Blast!"</PRE>
<P>And with that, Sir Critic had one of his few defeats.</P>

Austin Powers: B</PRE>
