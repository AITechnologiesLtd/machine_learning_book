<PRE>                              MAD CITY 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
               3 :-( :-( :-(  for leaving very few options</PRE>
<P>Cast: Dustin Hoffman, John Travolta, Blythe Danner, Mia Kirshner, Alan
Alda, William Atherton, Robert Prosky, Ted Levine, Bill Nunn, Lucinda
Jenny
Director: Costa-Gavras
Producers: Arnold Koppelson and Anne Koppelson
Screenplay: Tom Matthews</P>
<P>There is something intensely annoying about a story, that has only two
possible outcomes of which neither is satisfying.</P>
<P>Scenario 1:
An ex-security guard of a state museum (John Travolta) confronts his
boss with shotgun and explosives, in a desperate attempt to get his job
back. The boss (Blythe Danner) is a bit of a female tight arse, but hey,
if I were threatened with a pistol in my face, I wouldn't give you your
job back no matter how tight my arse. I mean I would initially say yes,
but sack you later.</P>
<P>Scenario 2:
During the confrontation, he accidentally shoots his buddy (Bill Nunn),
the other museum security officer in the stomach. This is the part where
the quick fix ‘I'm sorry', doesn't work anymore.</P>
<P>Scenario 3:
He takes a group of children, a teacher and reporter (Dustin Hoffman)
hostage. This is the part where you've just lost all rational thinking,
the media starts portraying you as a lunatic and you get placed on top
of the police hit list all at once.</P>
<P>>From here on, there can only be two possible outcomes for the Travolta
character – ‘To Jail' or ‘To Death'. Knowing how Hollywood scripts work,
the ‘To Jail' option is not very popular because audiences normally
don't like their hero/antiheroes to end up in jail. Jail is for bad guys
and the Travolta character isn't bad enough to end up there. So that
leaves us with the other option of ‘To Death', which is cliché, but safe
enough to end a silly situation which couldn't have gone any other way.</P>
<P>John Travolta shows us how desperate a family man can get, if he is
unable to find work to support his family. Looking in the Classifieds
for a job would have been a better option, but that would be a different
story. Dustin Hoffman, the reporter, just mumbles his way through the
movie, trying to draw sympathy for the Travolta character, and is lucky
not get blown away for his efforts.</P>
<P>An overall, unnecessary tragedy and waste of human life.</P>
