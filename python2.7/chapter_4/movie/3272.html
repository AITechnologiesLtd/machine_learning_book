                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Presumably, after making thirteen movies with Woody Allen, Mia 
Farrow has been missing the wry human insight and cleverly-concocted 
scripts which characterize Allen's work.  For obvious reasons, however, a 
Farrow/Allen corroboration isn't anywhere on the horizon.  So what's the 
actress to do?  Perhaps try something a little different, somewhat 
similar, and obviously inferior.  How about MIAMI RHAPSODY, or, by 
another name, Woody Allen lite? </P>
<P>     Make no mistakes, those expecting something along the lines of ANNIE 
HALL or HANNAH AND HER SISTERS are going to be disappointed.  What 
writer/director David Frankel has managed with MIAMI RHAPSODY is to 
capture some of the feel of an Allen movie without nearly the same degree 
of intelligence or character realization.  This film stands up reasonably 
well against most contenders, provided you don't consider the really good 
ones. </P>
<P>     MIAMI RHAPSODY is an anthology picture featuring no less than nine 
significant characters.  Of necessity, lots of corners get cut and, 
predictably, storylines are stripped to the bare bones.  The person 
around whom all the action swirls in Gwyn, a young copy writer who is 
trying to decide whether or not she's ready for marriage.  As portrayed 
by Sarah Jessica Parker, she's great with the barbed one-liners ("All the 
good moments are happening to someone else", "You have the subtlety of a 
woodpecker", "It's always natural for the female to be in agony") but 
weak on emotions.  As her potential fiance observes, all she wants to do 
is talk, and this diffuses any straight dramatic focus. </P>
<P>     Everyone Gwyn knows seems to be cheating.  Her brother, Jordan 
(Kevin Pollack), has left his pregnant wife (Barbara Garrick) for a 
shapely model.  Her sister, Leslie (Carla Gugino), not yet three months 
married, is sleeping with someone else.  Her mother (Mia Farrow) is 
enjoying a fling with a male nurse (Antonio Bandaras), and her father 
(Paul Mazursky) is trapped in an extramarital relationship with his 
travel agent.  At least Gwyn's intended, Matt (Gil Bellows), is 
faithful... not to mention boring. </P>
<P>     To Frankel's credit, he doesn't stay true to the easy romantic 
comedy model.  This is largely due to the Allen influence, but it gives 
MIAMI RHAPSODY a certain element of freshness.  Quite a few of the jokes 
are funny; the characters are generally affable, if not tremendously well 
fleshed out; and the story flows smoothly.  Often, MIAMI RHAPSODY attains 
the flavor of an intelligently-written TV sitcom. </P>
<P>     MIAMI RHAPSODY probably aspires to something more grand than it 
succeeds at.  In attempting to explore the question "Is marriage, as one 
compromise after another, worth it?", the movie gives us glimpses of a 
variety of successful and failing relationships, but spends too much time 
on quips and too little on exploring lives.  In proceeding in this 
manner, MIAMI RHAPSODY proves that even with Mia Farrow, Frankel still 
has a long way to go to equal Allen. </P>
