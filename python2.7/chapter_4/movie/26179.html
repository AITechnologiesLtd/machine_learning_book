<P>   Some of my fellow critics wear other hats as interviewers. 
In addition to writing their pungent reviews, they take their
places either at roundtables or one-on-one's to chat with the
celebrities and then post their impressions on their web sites
or print media or radio programs.  Whenever they ask me
why I don't add such conferences to my scibbles, I answer
that the stars come out at night: when you see them across a
table under hotel lighting they lose their luster. They look
almost like normal, everyday people.  I want to look up to
them while they are larger than life on the big screen.  One of
my concerned colleagues followed up with an observation
that got me thinking: "What if an actor came to your interview
completely in character, make-up and all, and talked with you
as though he or she were still the person played in the
movie?"  Yep.  I'd welcome that.</P>
<P>   This is the very concept worked on successfully by E. Elias
Merhige in his "Shadow of the Vampire," a shocking, funny
work, wholly original in so many aspects of its execution. 
Avoiding the deadly dull talking-heads documentary style
while at the same time evoking the spirit of a great director,
"Shadow of the Vampire" is a largely fictionalized,
expressionistic portrait of F.W. Murnau, whose 1922 picture
"Nosferatu" became the model for all succeeding movies on
the Dracula theme. That was the picture that made Bela
Lugosi a far better-known name than Max Schreck, whose
toothy performance is the archetype.  Using an
unrecognizable Willem Dafoe in the role of the obscure
German actor Max Schreck and Steppenwolf-stepped
performer John Malkovich as F.W. Murnau, Merhige captures
the essence of an obsessed helmer pitted both with and
against a person who in real life may be no different from the
role he performs.  We see the "Nosferatu" movie in black and
white through the lens of Murnau's camera, shifting to color
when Merhige highlights the off-camera activities of the cast.</P>
<P>   The seven-feet-tall homosexual Murnau (who died in
a car accident en route from L.A. to Monterey at the age of
42) may not really resemble John Malkovich, who in this pix
is dolled up with yet another of the many rugs that a studio
cosmetics team pastes on the spirited actor's bald pate.  But
Willem Dafoe does an uncanny, off-the-wall, splendid
performance as Count Orlock--the name which Murnau gives
to the bloodsucker because Bram Stoker's estate had refused
him permission to make a movie from Stoker's novel,
"Dracula."  Murnau's "Nosferatu," the world's first vampire
movie, was distinguished as well by being shot on location
rather than wholly in studios--that latter being the more typical
method used by the German expressionist school of film
makers.</P>
<P>   Filmed in Luxembourg, "Shadow of the Vampire" deals with
the shooting of the film "Nosferatu" on location in Eastern
Europe.  Murnau has assembled a cast of performers and a
support crew who only some time into the shooting are
introduced to the title character played by the unknown Max
Schreck.  Who is this guy Schreck?  Schreck is an eccentric
person (to say the least), a figure with longer fingernails than
any U.S. parlor today would dare paste onto a fashionable
woman's fingers.  He frequently clicks the nails together,
particularly when he is entertaining obsessive thoughts about
the attractive and full-of-herself actress Greta Schroeder
(Catherine McCormack).  From time to time his eyes bulge,
accenting his amazingly long parrot-nose.  In both looks and
actions, he spooks everyone around him.  Murnau explains to
the crew that Schreck is a method actor who remains in
character at all times.  This becomes apparent to the most
thickheaded member of the cast when Schreck catches a bat
with his bare hands and devours the creature in seconds. 
During the daylight hours, he remains in a coffin.</P>
<P>   While the production notes reveal the secret of the bizarre
performer's identity, Merhige, using a clever script by Steven
Katz, would do well to conceal the man's singularity from the
audience.  Let the viewers guess whether the bald, pointy-
headed weirdo is in fact this obscure Max Schreck (who on
the stage was associated with Max Reinhardt's Berlin
company), or whether he is in fact undead, a creature who
has unlived a lonely and tortured existence for centuries.</P>
<P>   Merhige's direction of John Malkovich is fine, though
Malkovich does not take on the accent that would be
expected from the Bielefeld-born Friedrich Wilhelm Plumpe
Murnau.  Malkovich does convey the obsessiveness of the
director, whose camera was like his third eye--regularly
rolling, capturing details that are not in the "Nosferatu" script
even more eagerly than those which belong to the story he is
helming.  We do not, however, sense the fear that Murnau
must have borne whenever he believes that his count is not
really an actor's portrayal but an actual vampire determined
to make corpses of his crew.  Willem Dafoe, however, gives
an Oscar-worthy imitation of a vampire (?) portraying Max
Schreck who is portraying a vampire.  Dafoe seems to come
out of the twenties (whether we refer to the 1920s or the
1520s is up to the viewers to figure out).  The entire
expressionistic stylization emerges from his vividly ugly
features as he gives objective expression to inner experience
in the true mode of the German school.  "Shadow of the
Vampire" could well be considered the most compelling
vampire movie made since 1922. Imagine doing an interview
with an actor who not only stays in character but who actually
IS the character he portrays!  </P>
