<P>     LITTLE ANGEL, the latest offering from German film maker Helke 
Misselwitz, is a poignant, powerful character study, as well as a look 
at the potentially debilitating effects of loneliness.  Distinguished by 
strong acting and an even stronger script, LITTLE ANGEL slowly-but-
surely pulls the viewer into its grim, grimy, everyday world and keeps 
us there as this tragic tale follows its inevitable trajectory.  LITTLE 
ANGEL is effective because it seems so real (Misselwitz made 
documentaries earlier in her career).  For the audience, this is a 
voyeuristic, fly-on-the-wall experience.</P>
<P>     We watch Ramona (Susanne Lothar) as she watches others.  Her life 
consists of going to work, feeding her beloved pet bird, and gazing out 
her window at the goings-on in an adjacent apartment building.  She 
watches one dysfunctional family in particular, and her eyes frequently 
meet those of the little girl whose parents are always screaming at each 
other.  One day, Ramona encounters a Polish rogue, Andrzej (Cezay 
Pazura), at the train station, and, from the moment he kisses her as a 
ruse to divert the police's attention, she is smitten.  She seeks him 
out day-after-day, then finally invites him back to her apartment.  
Soon, Andrzej has moved in, and Ramona is truly happy.  But the halcyon 
days cannot last, and soon Ramona must face the possibility of being 
more lonely than ever.</P>
<P>     LITTLE ANGEL allows us to become intimate participants in Ramona's 
life.  By showing us all the joyless aspects of her daily routine, 
Misselwitz invites us to share Ramona's existence.  It's a powerful way 
to build a character, and it works to perfection.  As the movie 
progresses, we experience Ramona's ups and downs with her.  This isn't 
the kind of film that engages its viewers on a purely intellectual 
plane.</P>
<P>     A fleet of supporting characters populate LITTLE ANGEL, but the 
focus never wavers from Ramona and Andrzej.  Susanne Lothar's 
performance is especially noteworthy -- she becomes Ramona in every way 
that is important, giving herself to the role.  The complexity and depth 
of her character is due in equal part to Misselwitz's perceptive script 
and Lothar's memorable interpretation of it.</P>
<P>     We have all experienced loneliness at one time or another -- it's 
one aspect of the human experience that anyone can relate to, and that 
makes Ramona's plight all-the-more immediate.  LITTLE ANGEL offers a 
slice of many aspects of life:  beauty and ugliness, joy and tragedy, 
passion and pain.  Ramona's story touches the heart without ever 
resorting to manipulation, and that's the singlemost outstanding 
characteristic of LITTLE ANGEL.  The movie, currently playing the 
international festival circuit, is worth seeking out. </P>
