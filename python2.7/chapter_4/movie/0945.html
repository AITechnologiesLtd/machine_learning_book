<PRE>                                   THE DOORS
                       A film review by Sandy Grossmann
                    Copyright 1991 by Sandra J. Grossmann</PRE>
<P>Cast:       Val Kilmer, Meg Ryan, Kyle MacLachlan, Frank Whaley, Kevin Dillon
Director:   Oliver Stone
Screenplay: Jay Randal Johnson and Oliver Stone</P>
<PRE>Synopsis:  A brilliant, eerie, difficult-to-watch recreation of Jim
           Morrison's inexorable dance toward death.  Stone's work is
           mature and restrained, and Kilmer is outstanding.  Worth
           seeing at full price on a big screen, but remember to bring
           ear plugs: the sound will probably be way too loud. </PRE>
<P>     "The show is about to begin."  We look around at the audience, my
husband and I, wondering how many people in the theatre were old enough
to form sentences when Morrison died.  Half?  Less than half?  Will the
young ones get it or will they be mesmerized?</P>
<P>     By now you've probably seen pictures of Kilmer-as-Morrison.  It's
uncanny.  Tumbled locks of hair, slightly parted lips, the eyes
bemused...  What was there about that face, about Morrison?  Like Rudolf
Valentino, he had a femininity that attracted females.  Like James Dean,
he had a rebellious streak that attracted males.  And like Janis Joplin,
he had a self-destructive urge that attracted and repelled would-be
saviors.</P>
<P>     THE DOORS is a disturbing film.  A relentless soundtrack, visually
skewed images, warped colors, and shamanistic shapes combine into an
assault on the senses.  Fascinated, we watch.  Just as his fans did.
Like moths drawn to a bonfire.  </P>
<P>     Who lit the fire that consumed Morrison?  Was it his fans?  His
band?  His girlfriend?  His parents?  His own visions?  Was he an
overrated rock star?  An underrated poet?  Stone's film is like a
documentary: scene after scene replayed, vaguely familiar.  We want to
hear Morrison explain what happened to him, but he doesn't.  We want to
turn him away from that bathtub in Paris, but we can't.  Morrison is
beautiful and he is hateful.  He gives his soul to his fans and he
attacks his friends.  He is naive and innocent one moment, brutal and
pretentious the next.</P>
<P>     This film is about excesses and pushing past limits.  In a sense,
the  60's were about that, too.  Break the old boundaries: they no
longer apply.  They were our parents' rules, but we are free of their
restrictions.  We can do anything.</P>
<P>     The limits, though, weren't the problem.  Morrison and drugs and 
death weren't the solution.  </P>
<P>     It is said that every generation must define meaning for itself,
and fortunately, most of us survive the experience, even if we fail the
test.  Perhaps we use our leaders as scouts, cheering them as they blaze
the trail.  We follow much later, if at all.  In Morrison's case, well,
we watched  Icarus fall from the sky, his wings melted.  He plunges into
the sea -- in this case, a bathtub, in Paris, in 1971.</P>
<P>     The closing scene is at Pere Lachaise, a cemetery in Paris.  We see
the quiet graves of Chopin, Berlioz, Moliere.  The last shot is of
Morrison's grave, graffiti-strewn and candlelit.  It's an unquiet grave,
anointed by the adoration of fans who still worship his self-consuming
fire.  </P>
<P>     Yet some have learned the lesson.  Will this film renew the lesson
or renew the blind passion?  To his credit, Stone doesn't hit us in the
face with A Message.  He sends us clippings instead and forces us to tie
the pieces together.  He turns the camera on Morrison/Kilmer, frequently
showing us Kilmer's back so that we are, literally, following Morrison
to his death.  </P>
<P>     Kilmer is magnificent.  He speaks pure babble as if it were
Shakespeare and he absolutely commands a crowd even when he can't focus
on it.  (Kilmer wore black contact lenses to make his pupils look
dilated.  The lenses had the added effect of screwing up his
equilibrium.)  All of the concert shots feature Kilmer's vocals, which
means that he not only looks and acts like Morrison, he sounds like him,
too.</P>
<P>     Kilmer is so good that the original band members had trouble
distinguishing some of the cuts Val sings from ones sung by Jim.  When
viewing some of the footage, guitarist Robby Krieger said, "I'm really
glad that we finally got  'The End.'  We never got a recording of that
live with Jim.  Now we've got it."  Kilmer has recreated Morrison.  It's
eerie.  Frightening, like a voice from the grave.  I ask again: will the
young ones get it or will they be mesmerized?</P>
<P>     The camera, you see, is in love with Morrison/Kilmer--it can't
resist him, and neither can the audience.  Morrison's dazed eyes have
come back to haunt another generation.  Let's hope this generation knows
a dead-end when they see one.</P>
