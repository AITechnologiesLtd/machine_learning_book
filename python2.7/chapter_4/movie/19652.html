<P>"Xiu Xiu", the astonishing debut film from Chinese actress Joan Chen,
has been banned in its native country because of "inappropriate"
political and sexual content. This ban is expected, since Chen's film
is so bold and provocative, and because its target is the corrupt
Chinese government. The beautiful Lu Lu stars as Xiu Xiu(no more
confusion), a young girl who is "sent down" out of her city in a
program called Educated Youth. The Chinese government believes that
this is a way to keep lower-class families out of their cities. Xiu
Xiu ends up as an apprentice to an older man named Lao Jin, learning
how to herd horses. She is told that after six months she will be able
to return to her home. But as those months pass, she learns that the
only way to have any chance of returning is to let the men at
headquarters have sex with her. This leads to a tragic, cathartic
outcome which reflects the sad truth. Xiu Xiu learns that her fate is
indeed in her hands. The scenes involving Lao Jin and Xiu Xiu are done
with a subtle grace requiring little dialogue. Although "Xiu Xiu"
clocks in at 99 minutes, it is indeed an epic; a tale of fate,
corruption and heartbreak.  The performances are excellent, and Joan
Chen shows depth far surpassing any other first filmmaker I've seen in
ages. The film's heartbreaking score adds to the drama, but "Xiu Xiu"
would be fine even without it. Daring and breathtaking, "Xiu Xiu" is
one of the year's very best offerings.</P>
