<P>'The English Patient' is a most lavish and exquisitely filmed epic set
just before and during World War II.  Producer Saul Zaentz who has won two
Academy Awards for his development of 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'
(1975) and 'Amadeus' (1984) brings us this romantic saga that packs a
peculiar power in spite of its dramatic shortcomings.  A member of the
Royal Geographical Society (Ralph Fiennes) has crashed his plane in the
Sahara Desert and is aided by Arabs and a Canadian nurse (Juliette
Binoche).  He is treated for his injuries by her as Allied forces are
travelling through Italy and a Canadian spy, code named "moose" (Willem
Dafoe) arrives on the scene and suspects Fiennes is a member of the German
army.  There is a spark of romantic hint between Binoche and Fiennes which
puts him in mind of a past affair prior to the outbreak of the war with a
married woman (Kristin Scott Thomas).  The story travels back and fourth
from the present to the past told in flashbacks through Fiennes' thoughts.
 This film is based on the novel by Canadian author Michael Ondaatje and
is adapted for the screen by writer and director Anthony Minghella who
combines breathtaking photography by John Seale and rather low key but
interesting performances by this first rate cast.  Its running time of 161
minutes is rather absorbing beyond what it should be and the picture sags
rather badly in its midsection but it is redeemed by a satisfying
conclusion which is both moving and somewhat tragic depending on your
point of view.  Actor Ralph Fiennes is truly a compelling leading man and
proved his acting ability to audiences world wide by turning in a
superlative performance three years ago in 'Schindler's List' as a bone
chilling Nazi commander which brought him an Oscar nomination as Best
Supporting Actor for which he should have won.  'The English Patient' is
more for film buffs than for general audiences and is an intelligent and
literate story told with sensitivity and compassion.</P>
