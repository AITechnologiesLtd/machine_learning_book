<P>     When a leprechaun's treasure is stolen, he hunts down the thieves
and kills them--at least that's the premise of LEPRECHAUN.  In this
case, one of the wee folk (Warwick Davis) has been relieved of a hundred
gold coins.  In an attempt to regain the lost treasure, he's captured by
means of a four-leaf clover and trapped in a box.  Ten years later, a
girl (Jennifer Aniston) and her father move into the house where the
leprechaun is trapped.  Surprise of surprises, the leprechaun gets free
and starts to kill and maim everyone in sight.</P>
<P>     To begin with, this is a feeble premise for a movie.  What the
"creative" team behind LEPRECHAUN manage to do with it, however, is a
travesty.  I know that there are far more bad horror films than there
are good ones, but this goes beyond simply being "bad".  It's so
unpleasant, in fact, that it isn't even worth a look as one of those
popular "so bad they're good" films.  It is legitimately unwatchable.</P>
<P>     The plot is a mishmash of cliches.  The dialogue was written with
the brain- dead viewer in mind.  Not only is it stilted and unrealistic,
but writer Mark Jones seems determined to explain everything, no matter
how obvious (and often ludicrous) it is.  Of course, toward the end,
the leprechaun has to be "killed" twice.  This "sudden return" from the
dead has, over the past few years, become one of the most-overused plot
devices in Hollywood.  </P>
<P>     The actors seem perfectly suited for the stock characters they
portray.  Warwick Davis enjoys himself in an over-the-top performance,
and Jennifer Aniston shows that, in different circumstances, she might
be competent, but everyone else is horrible.  </P>
<P>     As is usual in pictures of this genre, there's a lot of blood, but,
while some slasher flicks take pride in the art of presenting a murder,
there's no style evident in LEPRECHAUN's various killings.  The copious
amounts of gore are more laughable than sickening.  True to its
unoriginal form, the leprechaun follows the recent trend of
wisecracking whenever he injures or murders someone.  Compared to the
other homicidal maniacs like Freddy and Chucky, his lines are more
idiotic than pithy.</P>
<P>     Then there's the intelligence of the characters to consider.  Now I
recognize that it's necessary for people occasionally to do stupid
things in horror movies to advance the plot, but LEPRECHAUN thrives on
far too many of these contrivances.  How is the audience supposed to
sympathize with a group of morons who act like they flunked out of
kindergarten?   For example, if you suspect that a cat is rabid, would
you stick your hand into a hole in a tree to try to get it out?
Neither would I, but the characters of LEPRECHAUN approach the matter
differently.</P>
<P>     It's not worth wasting any more time on this review.  LEPRECHAUN is
a movie with virtually no redeeming qualities and even the most film-
starved horror fan would do better watching HALLOWEEN for the umpteenth 
time than putting himself/herself through this torture.  It's hard to
believe that ninety-one minutes can seem this long.</P>
<PRE>                      Rating:  1.1 (F-, *)</PRE>
