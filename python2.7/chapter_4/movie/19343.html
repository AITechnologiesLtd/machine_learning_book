<P>The logical progression, according to the dictates of the modern
American film industry, is to take a successful television series, and
capitalize on its fan base by releasing a feature film of that series.
"South Park" started as a short which was popular enough to prompt a
series on the Comedy Central television network, quickly becoming one
of that station's most popular series.</P>
<P>The appeal of the series lies in its contradictions. The animation is
rough and jerky, but the result is a minimalistic, almost avant-garde
quality. The children are drawn in an innately cute manner, with large
heads and large eyes, but their dialog and actions can be quite
vulgar. However the best quality of the series is the satire, which is
constantly skewering various aspect of American pop culture.</P>
<P>The four main characters are Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny. They are
third grade students in the quiet town of South Park. One day they
sneak into an "R" rated film starring their favorite television
personalities, Terrance and Phillip. While most of the audience is
instantly turned off by the films excessive profanity and flatulence
based humor, the boys are riveted. When the impressionable boys mimic
the movie's vulgarities back in the classroom, the teachers and
parents are outraged. Kyle's mother takes an especially vociferous
role in determining how to protect their children from such bad
influences. A quick evaluation determines that because Terrance and
Phillip are Canadian, America must ban all things Canadian, as well as
execute Terrance and Phillip.</P>
<P>The undertone of the film is a clever self reference. Obviously this
film contains excessive profanity that the parents object to in the
Terrance and Phillip film. The point being made is the hypocrisy in
the allowable levels of objectionable content in mass media. Typically
in American film, profanity and sexual content are derided, but
violence is tolerated (although recent tragic events may have elevated
the objectionability violence). In reality, just as in this film,
there is no shortage of knee-jerk reactions (and an ambiguous
assignment of cause and effect) when discussing objectionable images
reflected in mass media.</P>
<P>An extra dimension is added to the story when it is revealed that the
impending execution of Terrance and Phillip is the event that will
unleash the Armageddon. Kenny is killed (just as in every television
episode) when he imitates a scene from Terrance and Phillip, and finds
his access denied into the sparsely populated heaven. When he enters
hell, he discovers that Satan is preparing to ascend to rule Earth
along with his lover, the recently deceased Saddam Hussein. Kenny
desperately tries to warn the other boys that the must rescue Terrance
and Phillip from death in order to save the world.</P>
<P>The strength of the film is its biting satire, which is often extreme.
Among the targets are American cultural imperialism, racial politics,
and fundamental Christian images of heaven and hell. One example is
the shocking image of Mahatma Gandhi welcoming Kenny to hell, which is
a commentary on the fundamentalist Christian view that Gandhi has met
the same fate in the afterlife as Adolf Hitler. Sensitive viewers may
feel that the film tries to be funny by simply being vulgar. Indeed,
the profanity is extreme and occasionally distracting, but often it is
a part of the deeper lampoon. Another dimension of the satire is the
multitude of musical productions. For viewers who dislike musicals,
these provide an enjoyable roasting of the usually wholesome genre.
Perhaps the best number is when Satan longingly sings of his desire to
rise and rule the Earth. The popular song from the television series
in which Eric derides Kyle's mother is also presented in the film.</P>
<P>Recommended. Viewers who enjoy the television series will probably
also like this film. It is definitely more vulgar, and at times the
obscenity becomes tiresome rather than funny. Viewers who are not
familiar with the television series can also enjoy this film, filled
with scathing satire and commentary about American pop culture. The
film is intentionally extreme in its profanity and sexual content, so
sensitive viewers will be offended. Although it is a cartoon, this
film is definitely not intended for children.</P>
