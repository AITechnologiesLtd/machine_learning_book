<P>Monkeybone   *1/2 out of * * * *
Starring: Brendan Fraser, Bridget Fonda, Chris Kattan, Rose McGowan, Megan 
Mullally, voice of John Turturro.
Directed by: Henry Selick
Running Time: 90 minutes
Rated PG-13: crude humor and brief nudity.</P>
<P>"From the director of "The Nightmare Before Christmas" it said in the 
previews, which I'm guessing was said to get people to go see the movie, 
obviously it hasn't worked since the $75 million dollar movie has yet to 
break $5 million. To each it's own however, since "Monkey Bone" is not only a 
bad movie all together, but technically well-made. A tragic waste of talent 
and incredible visual effects.</P>
<P>Stu Miley is the genius behind the new phenomena "Monkey Bone" a crude comic 
strip, that everyone wants to merchandise, they go to great links to get it 
as well, including dollars that let out fart powder. When Stu and his 
girlfriend, Julie (Bridget Fonda) are in a freak car accident (you'll see) 
Stu goes into a coma, and while in his coma Stu travels to I'm guessing Dark 
Town, where all the characters in dreams come to life. People are stuck in 
this town, with their nightmares roaming around them. When Stu spots Monkey 
Bone (whom he really can't stand) he tries to keep him under control. Making 
a new friend Kitty (Rose McGowan) he learns that if he gets an exit pass from 
Death, he can go back up and live his life. When Monkey Bone and Stu steal a 
pass, Monkey Bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into Stu's body. Now 
Monkey Bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder, so 
everyone has nightmares...or something like that.</P>
<P>Rather complex (in fact more than it needs to be) "Monkey Bone" had potential 
in the script and even the story. What is considerably noticeable is the 
gaping plot holes, and lack of character development. For instance we really 
don't get to know who Stu or Julie are, so why should we even care? Kitty 
played well by Rose McGowan ha a story behind her, but we are not given a 
chance to know her. </P>
<P>The cast is decent however, Brendan Fraser seems to be enjoying himself in 
the role as Stu Miley, but becomes awfully annoying when Monkey Bone takes 
over his body. Bridget Fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a 
screeching halt, her performance is bad and she seems miscast. Dave Foley 
isn't given enough to do, as well as "Will & Grace's" Megan Mullally who can 
be funny. The standout performance is the voice of Nick Turturro as Monkey 
Bone himself, he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film 
from being a total bust. </P>
<P>The special effects of "Monkey Bone" is what might really bring in some 
curious viewers, these special effects are highly effective, and nice to look 
at with the eyes. Some of them are believable and some unbelievable...for 
Monkey Bone he seems to be like Stuart Little, you really don't realize that 
he is animated...but on occasion it sneaks up on you. The direction by Henry 
Selick is good, but at times he doesn't know what kind of film he wants to 
make, and the ending climax falls off the cliff. </P>
<P>It's too bad really, "Monkey Bone" could have been a real good movie, but 
with it's heavily done hack job, and lack of character development it just 
sinks when the end credits role. For those curious however, it might be worth 
the rental, but other than that avoid this one.</P>
