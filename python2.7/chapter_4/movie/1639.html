<PRE>                                   PROOF
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<PRE>95 min., R, Drama, 1992
Director: Jacelyn Moorhouse
Cast: Hugo Weaving, Genevieve Picot, Russell Crowe</PRE>
<P>     Hugo Weaving is a blind man who doesn't seem to trust anyone.  He
takes photos of what is around him as proof that what is there exists.
He doesn't trust his housekeeper Genevieve Picot, who likes him very
much.  Weaving finds Russell Crowe, who he trusts, to describe his
photos to him.</P>
<P>     PROOF is done by House and Moorhouse Films and is distributed by
Fine Line Features (which is a division of New Line Cinema).  Although
the film's description sounds strange, and initially to me not
interesting, I found PROOF to be a very good film, although I don't
think that it will appeal to everybody.  However, if it comes to your
area, I suggest trying it.  Later this month, PROOF is going to be
released on video.  I feel it is worth seeing.  On a scale of zero to
five, I give PROOF a four.  PROOF is rated R for female nudity, adult
situations, and explicit language.</P>
<P>     The actors all did a good job.  Hugo Weaving was very convincing as
a blind person.  Genevieve Picot was very good as the housekeeper.
Russell Crowe was excellent as the young adult who is befriended by
Weaving.  I don't think that there were any actors in the film that I
felt were miscast.  The film had an interesting idea, which worked well;
however, I wouldn't have wanted to have been the one to describe the
film to the producer!   When I heard what the film was about, I wasn't
quite sure of what to expect.  Thankfully the film was more than I
expected that it could be.</P>
<P>     The script for the film was well written.  There were some places
in the film when the actors came out with some moronic lines, but not
many.  The story moves along rather well.  It did get a little boring in
some places, but those points are few and the interesting parts make up
for the slower ones.</P>
