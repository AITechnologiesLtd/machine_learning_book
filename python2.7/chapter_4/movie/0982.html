<PRE>                              THE LONG WALK HOME
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  A strong and emotional view of the 1955
     Montgomery bus boycott does not always play fairly with the
     facts but manages eventually to have some anger and
     excitement.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     THE LONG WALK HOME is a powerful and moving film telling the story of
simultaneous victories over racism and sexism during the 1955 bus boycott in
Montgomery, Alabama.  Sissy Spacek plays Miriam Thompson, who slowly comes
to realize her own importance and her power to affect events when she is
torn between loyalty to her family on one hand and her social conscience on
the other.</P>
<P>     Miriam, the wife of an influential real estate developer, is shocked
when the police harass her maid Odessa Cotter (played by Whoopi Goldberg)
for accompanying Miriam's children to a whites-only park.  Using her
position, she coerces the policeman into apologizing.  When Rosa Parks is
arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a bus, the blacks boycott the
buses and Odessa begins the wearing routine of walking to and from the
Thompson house.  Initially more out of the need to have Odessa cleaning the
house on time than out of any conviction, Miriam saves Odessa the long walk
two mornings a week by picking her up on the way back from a convenient
grocery.  She hides this from her husband and his red-neck younger brother.
Eventually her husband will find out and she will have to choose between her
husband's insistence that no white woman can drive a black one and her own
sense that the bus boycott is right and should be supported.</P>
<P>     The film is a powerful statement, but it is doubtful that after 36
years any of the audience will have any sympathies against the boycott.
Given that is the case, one might expect that director Richard Pearce and
screenwriter John Cork could afford to be a little magnanimous to the losing
side.  This most certainly is not the case.  With the exception of Miriam
and her children, whites are uniformly portrayed as being racist, telling
racist jokes, and being hypocritical.  Blacks are all honest church-going
people, wonderful to each other in closely-knit families.  While these
stereotypes may be substantially correct, the portrayal makes it a little
overly obvious where the audience's sympathies should lie.  The film also
tampers a bit with historical fact.  The CURRENT BIOGRAPHY article on Rosa
Parks says that it had previously been the practice to force blacks to enter
the bus at the front, pay the driver, exit the bus, and re-enter at the rear
door so as not to walk past whites already on the bus.  However, this
practice had already been abandoned at the time of Parks's arrest.  The film
depicts this practice as if it were still going on at the time of the
arrest.  Certainly the truth is damning enough without distorting it to make
an even stronger case.  While it would be difficult to exaggerate the degree
of polarization of whites against blacks at the time, this film manages.
While it was a small percentage of Southern whites who supported the black
cause, this film implies there were no more than a half dozen or so adult
whites supporting the blacks, which does something of a disservice to those
whites who were courageous to stand up for their conscience.  It is the
opposite problem to the one of MISSISSIPPI BURNING, which went to the other
extreme, having it be mostly whites in the form of the FBI coming in and
fighting for black freedom.  My suspicion is that THE LONG WALK HOME is the
closer to being accurate, but the truth lies somewhere in the range between
the points-of-view of the two films.</P>
<P>     Pacing is also a minor problem.  It takes Miriam a long time to decide
she will make a stand, then when the story gets going, it is over, with the
remaining history told in screen titles.  Still, THE LONG WALK HOME is good
filmmaking.  It makes the viewer angry about injustice rather than just
depressed about it, the way GUILTY BY SUSPICION does.  On that basis it
deserves a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
