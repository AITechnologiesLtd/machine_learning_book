<PRE>REVIEW: City of Angels
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</PRE>
<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 and a half stars<HR></PRE>
<P>Wim Wenders' 1988 film Wings of Desire was a brilliant and poetic
examination of the human heart - taken from the perspective of angels
who roam the earth.  It enchanted us into feeling, understanding and
almost believing these MIB look a like's through the way Wenders avoided
common cliché's and Hollywood surroundings.  Now, the 90's update
version City of Angels is based on the former film in basic themes only.
And although this new rendition has lost most of the power of Wings of
Desire, it surprising contains a lot of its emotional impact.</P>
<P>Amongst other angels, Seth (Nicholas Cage) roams the streets of the city
of angels, Los Angeles.  He can only see in black and white, cannot feel
pain or hunger, and has a useful skill of reading peoples thoughts.</P>
<P>Whilst Seth is welcoming a hospital patient to the after life, he
notices the beautiful doctor Maggie (Meg Ryan) desperately trying to
save the mans life.  He soon becomes infatuated with her, and eventually
comes to her, appearing as a clueless civilian.</P>
<P>Maggie's fascination with Seth grows until she begins to sense something
abnormal, something unique about him.  She consults a close friend: "I
got this jolt that... something bigger is out there. Something bigger
than me, bigger than you. Does that sound crazy?"</P>
<P>Just as Seth feels that he is doomed to remain at arms length to Maggie
for the rest of her life, he speaks to a former-angel hospital patient
(Dennis Franz, in a role very similar to one played by Columbo's Peter
Falk in Wings of Desire), who explains to him how to "delve" into a
human form.  So (as the film is keen for us to believe) the relationship
between this couple depends on one question: is Seth willing to
sacrifice eternal life for a mere mortal?"</P>
<P>The answer to that question is, naturally, no mystery.  But it doesn't
have to be - with quotes like "I would rather have had one breath of her
hair, one kiss from her mouth, one touch of her hand, than eternity
without it," City of Angels is a tear jerking "chick flick" that gives a
powerful, lasting impact.</P>
<P>But surprisingly, the most impressive aspect of director Brad
Silberling's (who has only Casper under his belt) creation is not its
writing nor acting, but rather the stunning cinematography by Australian
John Seale (The English Patient, Rain Man). The visual impact of City of
Angels is so dazzling that it gives the big screen an angelic, gorgeous
radiance that no amount of Mr. Sheen's could possibly deliver.</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong: the dialogue is sumptuously gentle to inhale, and
the sweetened performances from Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan are a triumph
in themselves.  But boiled down, City of Angels is sometimes just
good-looking Hollywood claptrap - and that is why it doesn't
convincingly impersonate Wings of Desire.  But it does, as I mentioned
before, have an emotional depth that gets through to the viewer on
multiple levels.</P>
<P>I would have loved to see this film more tightly based on Wim Wenders'
and Peter Handke's original screenplay for Wings of Desire.  Although
this obviously did not happen, City of Angels is far from a slip-up, and
Wenders himself was pleased with the final result.  He was quoted in the
film's promotional material, saying: "It was moving, beautifully
crafted, there was some amazing imagery and an astonishing story.  I had
never seen anything like it, well, except for that one German film
maybe, with the subtitles.  What's its name again?"</P>

formulaic it could have spewed from the power book of the laziest
