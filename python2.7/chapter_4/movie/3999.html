<PRE>                               WATERWORLD
                       A film review by Sue Roberts
                        Copyright 1995 Sue Roberts</PRE>
<P>Directed by Kevin Reynolds
Starring Kevin Costner, Dennis Hopper, Tina Majorino, Jeanne Tripplehorn.</P>
<P>     I enjoyed it. It's more than possible you will too!  If you like
action movies in the STAR WARS vein, don't take any notice of the
journalistic hogwash 'cos if you only see it on video you'll be kicking
yourself that you didn't get out and view all those unbelievable
special FX on the widest screen you could find.</P>
<P>     It doesn't take a movie buff to see what so inspired the company
about Reynold's vision that they weren't prepared to quit.  "The
Mutant" doesn't sound like a promising role, but Costner turns it into
one of his best characters. Hopper moves with alacrity to top his
performance as the "baddie" in SPEED.  The kid is great.</P>
<P>     Any message intended? Well it does rather capture how people in
the third world must feel, often on the knife edge of existence.  Kinda
makes you think.</P>
