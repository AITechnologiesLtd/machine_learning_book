<P>     Here's a sure method to guess whodunnit in bad mystery thrillers:
pick the suspect most likely to shock the audience and you have the
killer.  (Note:  "most likely to shock" does not necessarily equate to
"least likely to have done it".)  And, true to form, this is how NEVER
TALK TO STRANGERS gives itself away roughly half an hour early.  A lot
of things about the killer's identity don't make sense, but then, in
this kind of B-grade schlock, coherence isn't a prime requisite.</P>
<P>     It's been a good season for serial killers.  In addition to this
film, they're currently out and about in HALLOWEEN 6, SEVEN, COPYCAT,
and JADE.  I'm not sure if this fascination with mass murder says more
about the average movie-goer or Hollywood's perception of the average
movie-goer.  Regardless, apparently this kind of motion picture sells.
And so does Antonio Banderas.  This is his fourth of five movies this
year (MIAMI RHAPSODY, DESPERADO, ASSASSINS, NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS,
FOUR ROOMS), and his name on the marquee guarantees extra dollars at the
box office.</P>
<P>     Judging by Rebecca DeMornay's over-the-top performance here, it's
not hard to figure out why she's been pigeonholed into this genre.  She
and Sharon Stone have *a lot* in common.  Anyway, in NEVER TALK TO
STRANGERS, DeMornay plays Dr. Sarah Taylor, a psychiatrist charged by
the court to evaluate the sanity of serial killer Max Cheski (Harry Dean
Stanton).  He claims to have Multiple Personality Disorder, but Sarah's
not so sure.  Meanwhile, she has a new boyfriend, Tony Ramirez
(Banderas), a stranger she meets in the grocery store wine department.
However, at about the same time she first goes out with him, someone
begins stalking her.  The question is:  does it have something to do
with Tony or Cheski (who's supposedly safely behind bars), or is the
truth buried deep in the roots of Sarah's own tragic past?</P>
<P>     And the answer is:  Who cares?  This poorly-constructed film has so
many obvious flaws in logic that it's difficult to retain even a
moderate interest in the proceedings.  Normally, this type of movie goes
straight to video, but apparently Banderas' involvement earned it a
theatrical run.  Regardless, it's doubtful that even someone as hot as
this actor can help out something that's so astonishingly dumb.</P>
<P>     There's an unwritten rule that psychiatrists in thrillers are
inevitably more screwed up than their clients.  NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS
succumbs to this and every other bad cliche of the genre.  The story is
about Multiple Personality Disorders, and everyone involved with this
motion picture seems to be afflicted, including the screenwriters and
director.</P>
