<PRE>                                   VOLCANO
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     O, there's nothing like a natural disaster to bring people
together!  That's the poorly masked theme ("They all look the same!")
behind VOLCANO, the first really big disaster movie we've seen since,
gosh, mid-February.  It least this VOLCANO doesn't blow -- figuratively
speaking -- like DANTE'S PEAK did, and that's mainly because it's so
much more fun to watch Los Angeles be decimated by unceasing lava flow
instead of a puny Pacific Northwest village.  Co-stars Anne Heche and
Tommy Lee Jones prove more than able at evading not only the encroaching
magma, but also the horde of bad actors that follow them throughout the
movie.  And while the film is full of creeping cheese, complete with
death-defying leaps to safety, slow motion shots, and kitschy
one-liners, I shock myself even by saying that, for the most part, it
feels *real.*  They even thought to include Dennis Woodruff's infamous
car, the cheesiest of Hollywood landmarks, floating along in a river of
fire.  Where else would they think of that!?  I really do love L.A...</P>
