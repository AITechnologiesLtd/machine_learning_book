<PRE>ME, MYSELF AND IRENE
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
March 5th, 2001</PRE>
<P>Jim Carrey can be as funny as anyone on screen with the right screenplay and 
the right director. He also proved to be humane and soulful in films such as 
"The Truman Show" and "Man on the Moon." The Farrely Brothers proved their 
comic worth in Carrey's "Dumb and Dumber" and the obscenely hilarious 
"There's Something About Mary." Both Carrey and the Farrelys reunite in one 
obscenely unfunny and desperate film called "Me, Myself and Irene," which has 
a great comic premise that is hardly milked for all its worth. </P>
<P>Carrey plays a Rhode Island police officer named Charlie who is seen as a 
joke in his community. His wife has left him with three black kids, fathered 
by a snipy, black limousine driver who happens to be a Mensa member! They run 
off together while Charlie is left to raise the kids. Years pass and the 
community sees him less as an authority figure and more as a hapless fool. 
But Charlie is repressing his rage at people and it finally comes out in the 
form of Hank, complete with an attitude and a Clint Eastwood accent. Now the 
little girl who plays hopscotch on the street despite Charlie's warnings is 
practically drowned by Hank! Not funny. The woman who buys a vaginal product 
at the supermarket and walks ahead of Charlie on line with tons of groceries 
is now embarrased by Hank who gives a full description of the product on the 
speaker system. Not funny. </P>
<P>Still, give the Farrelys credit for trying since I thought that eventually 
the film would find its comic rhythm and exploit the schizophrenic angle of 
Charlie. Not so. We are left with a plot involving Rene Zellweger as a woman 
on the run from some crooked cops and a crooked ex-boyfriend involving golf 
clubs and some other assorted business, none of which merits as much as a 
chuckle. Then there is some more business involving an albino waiter who may 
be a family murderer and tags along with Charlie and the girl, but again, no 
major laughs to be found. So what we are left with are countless sexually 
scatalogical jokes involving dildos, an actually funny scene involving a cow, 
a scene involving a chicken placed in an unlikely orifice, and so on. When a 
nearly dead cow gets the only major laugh in a Jim Carrey movie, you know you 
are in trouble. </P>
<P>I never liked "Ace Ventura" but I've admired Carrey in it, as I have in most 
of his films including the often riotous "Dumb and Dumber." For the first 
tim, however, I actually found Carrey excruciatingly boring in this film, 
exuding little of his genuine comic talent or gift for mimicry. In fact, I am 
also a firm believer that Carrey can act and he has a mental breakdown scene 
that is relatively touching to watch. Outside of that, if the Farrelys paid 
more attention to Charlie's character than Hank's and if they made Zellweger 
exploit her comic zest (shown to far greater effect in "Nurse Betty"), then 
this might have been a real winner. Instead, it is the Farrelys merely 
coasting on sexual jokes and innuendoes galore with Carrey merely playing 
with a dildo or himself. Embarrasing is the word. </P>
