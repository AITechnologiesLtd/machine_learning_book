<PRE>                                AWAKENINGS
                       A film review by Jim Pellmann
                        Copyright 1991 Jim Pellmann</PRE>
<P>     Set in 1969, this is the story of a neurologist (Robin Williams)
who attempts to "awaken" a group of patients in a mental hospital who
have been in a catatonic state for 30 years or more due to having had
encephalitis when younger.  The doctor believes that the new drug
L-Dopa, which is being used to treat Parkinson's disease patients might
help them as well.</P>
<P>     Robert De Niro plays Leonard, the first patient to try the
treatment.  Leonard becomes a fully functional person again and the
doctor expands the treatment to other patients.  Their joy at becoming
"normal" again is short-lived when Leonard starts regressing to his
former state.</P>
<P>     This movie plays fast and loose with your emotions, but is not
manipulative.  It is based on a true story, but I don't know how much
(if any) has been altered to make for a better story.  Although
basically a drama, there are many hilarious moments.</P>
<P>     As Leonard, De Niro gives a highly effective performance along the
lines of Dustin Hoffman in RAIN MAN and Daniel Day Lewis in MY LEFT
FOOT, and he will no doubt be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar.  His joy
at getting his life back is as compelling as his rage when he realizes
he is losing it again.  </P>
<P>     As Robin Williams learns to tone down his manic comedic style, he
is becoming a better and better actor.  I think this is probably his
best work since THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP.</P>
<P>     Julie Kavner is the sympathetic nurse who believes in the doctor
and becomes his biggest supporter among the otherwise doubting staff at
the hospital.  There are lots of other well-known character actors
playing smaller roles too.</P>
<P>     Director Penny Marshall (who also did BIG) demonstrates that she
can do drama every bit as well as comedy.  Could be the first female
Best Director Oscar nominee.</P>
<PRE>     Highly recommended, but bring a Kleenex or two.</PRE>
