<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Matthew Broderick's character in the new Alexander Payne (Citizen Ruth)
comedy could be an adult version of Ferris Bueller.  Sure, we don't want
to think about the carefree Ferris turning into Election's popular high
school teacher Jim McAllister, but you almost can't help it.</P>
<P>McAllister is a mélange of every educator you've ever had – dingy
short-sleeved oxford shirt, bad tie, brown shoes, tiny Ford Festiva, and
a genuine love of teaching.  Despite winning George Washington Carver
High's `Teacher of the Year' a record three times in his twelve-year
tenure, McAllister still has one major Achilles heel that ultimately
leads to his unraveling – a peppy junior named Tracy Flick.</P>
<P>Flick (Reese Witherspoon, Cruel Intentions) is running unopposed for the
student body President, and her vivacity and eagerness are just the
qualities that would have made her an easy target for people like
Ferris.  She in the top seven percent of her class, dresses like she's
still trapped in Pleasantville, walks like she has a bulky object
crammed up her backside, and perfectly pronounces every word that leaves
her tightly pursed lips.  And don't get me started on her hair, which,
at one point, resembles demonic horns.</P>
<P>Things take an odd turn at Carver when McAllister convinces well-liked
school quarterback Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against the
seemingly unstoppable Flick juggernaut.  When the dust settles, viewers
will have been treated to tastes of pornography, marital infidelity,
lesbianism, sex with minors, election tampering, and a very disturbing
scene where McAllister cleanses his genitals in the bathtub of a cheap
hotel.  Not your typical MTV Production, eh?</P>
<P>Payne's direction (he also co-wrote the script, based on the Tom
Perrotta novel) is reminiscent of both Wes Anderson's superior Rushmore
and either of Betty Thomas' biopics, The Late Show and Private Parts.
Repeatedly using montage clips, Payne also bathes his actors in a sea of
horrible fluorescent lighting, exposing every physical flaw.</P>
<P>Although the acting is first-rate, Witherspoon's Flick really stands
out.  Her unknowingly fiendish role will likely be remembered among the
more evil roles in film history, along with Oddjob, Keyser Soze, Robert
Patrick in Terminator 2 and that Russian guy from the fourth Rocky
film.  Or was it the third?  Well, you get my point.  (1:43 – R for
