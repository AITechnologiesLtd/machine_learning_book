<P>When a movie begins with a con being freed from jail, you know one of
two things will happen: Either he'll be called in to help the hapless
police solve an impossible crime that's had them baffled for months, or
he'll be tempted by one final heist, a perfect job that will let him
retire a wealthy man.</P>
<P>Rififi, a French film originally released in 1955 as Du rififi chez les
hommes, is a film noir. Which means, of course, we're going to get the
heist.</P>
<P>Sad-eyed Jean Servais plays Tony le Stephanois, fresh from a stint in
the slammer. Free for the first time in five years, Tony wants to stay
on the straight and narrow, but can't maintain his cool when he
discovers that his girl has taken up with another man during his
imprisonment. A man of few words, Tony orders her to strip, whips her
and kicks her out of his apartment before meeting up with his old
associates Jo (Carl Möhner) and Mario (Robert Manuel, from whom Billy
Zane was apparently cloned). Jo and Mario have a high-risk crime in
mind, breaking into a ritzy but well-protected jewelry store and its
basement safe, and Tony agrees to mastermind the job. Cesar le Milanais,
an Italian safecracker played to dapper, womanizing perfection by
director Jules Dassin, is recruited to round out the gang.</P>
<P>The heart of the film is the subsequent robbery sequence, which
stretches for 30 minutes without dialogue. Cool, tense, and suspenseful,
the scenes of the heist play out like a primer for would-be jewel
thieves, which led to the film being banned in several countries after
its original release in 1955. (That it was allowed in the United States
was an indication that the Production Code Administration had lost much
of its authority by the mid 1950s; the Code stated that "theft, robbery,
safe-cracking... etc., should not be detailed in method.") </P>
<P>The heist goes off perfectly, giving us valuable lessons in how to break
through a concrete ceiling without a sound and how to silence an alarm.
The film anticipates every audience question -- How do you hammer
through concrete without waking the neighbors? How do you crack a safe
without explosives? -- and answers them with surprising technical
accuracy. That the break-in is accomplished with nothing more than rope,
a suitcase of simple tools, and an umbrella makes it vastly more
impressive than anything in current films, where burglars rely on latex
face masks, magic voice-changing throat stickers and plastic surgery to
get their business done. No, back in the smoky, jazz-filled Paris of the
1950s, men were men, and they used hard steel implements to do the job.</P>
<P>The crime nets the gang jewels worth a staggering 240 million francs.
But despite an agreement to lay low for a while, suave safecracker Cesar
can't help giving an enormous diamond ring to a nightclub chanteuse,
setting a final chain of violence in motion. The singer promptly shows
it to her boss, club owner Pierre Grutter, who makes an immediate
connection between the ring, Cesar, and the recent heist. And decides he
should have the stash himself.</P>
<P>>From here events spiral rapidly southward. Grutter beats a confession
out of Cesar, Tony pops Cesar for talking, and Grutter kidnaps Jo's
young son and demands the jewels as ransom. There's an accelerating rush
to a violent and hallucinatory ending.</P>
<P>Yet despite the inevitable bloodshed, the underworld romance of Rififi's
Paris has an undeniable and timeless appeal. As captured in moody
black-and-white, it makes you want to lounge in a jazz-joint, chain
smoke and knock back whiskey, and bitch-slap any two-bit punk who dares
look at your girl. Sure, there's a price to pay in the end, but that's
the life of the professional criminal. And the code of film noir, even
in France.</P>
