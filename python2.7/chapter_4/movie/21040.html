<PRE>Splendor ***</PRE>
<PRE>rated R
Samuel Goldwyn Films
93 minutes
starring Kathleen Robertson, Johnathon Schaech, Matt Keeslar, Kelly
MacDonald, Eric Mabius
written and directed by Gregg Araki</PRE>
<P>Gregg Araki is best known as the writer/director of the `Teen
Apocalypse Trilogy'; three films (`The Living End', `The
Doom Generation' and `Nowhere') which predicted the end of
life as we know it. Araki, who usually lets his style undermine his
substance, quietly triumphs with `Splendor', an upbeat,
sparkling comedy about a woman trying to make her menage a trois
relationship work.</P>
<P>The plotline and mood of `Splendor' are a refreshing change from
the over the top nihilism of Araki's first few films, but it still
features his best asset: his colorful, inventive portrayal of Los
Angeles in the not too distant future.</P>
<P>Kathleen Robertson, a former `Beverly Hills, 90210' beauty who
was discovered by Araki for `Nowhere', plays the twenty-ish
Veronica with a perfect mixture of sweetness, vulnerability and
confidence. One Halloween night, she meets Abel (Johnathon Schaech), a
fun music critic, and Zed (Matt Keeslar), a sexy, dimwitted drummer.</P>
<P>Veronica begins to date both simultaneously, and is attracted to each
of them equally. She decides that it would be a good idea to let them
know the situation, and a metaphorical boxing match ensues.  But
slowly, through their love for Veronica, they relinquish their
selfishness and share her. Before long, both have moved in, and are
sharing a bed.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Veronica, also a starving actress, lands a role in a
terrible TV movie, and the director, Ernest (Eric Mabius), starts to
put the moves on her. Veronica has no real feelings for him, but she
realizes that she craves financial stability. The next day, she learns
of her pregnancy, and she thinks about giving her child the life she
never had. Abel and Zed, who are each penniless, aren't too
surprised when she leaves them for Ernest. But conscience creeps up on
her, and she has to decide between a life of luxury and stability and
one of love and spontaneity.</P>
<P>Kathleen Robertson is amazing! As the lead character, she almost
singlehandedly carries the film, and evokes the splendor of the
title. Schaech and Keeslar are around mostly to look good and act
dumb, but they manage to make their characters quite charming.</P>
<P>Gregg Araki doesn't go for too much with this film, which is a
welcome relief and helps `Splendor' shine. His screenplay is
snappy, though not as good as James Toback's similarly themed
`Two Girls And A Guy'. `Splendor' is slight, instead of
edgy, and that making it quite a pleasant diversion.</P>
<P>`Splendor' has a brighter outlook on life than Araki's
previous work, which is surprising since it is his last film before
the new millennium. The quirky assurance that a three person
relationship could work may make this a hit with the indie crowd.</P>
<P>Araki has a knack for finding talented young actors. Famous faces such
as Ryan Phillippe, Heather Graham, Rose McGowan, Christina Applegate
and Mena Suvari all owe much to Araki's clever casting. His highly
entertaining, offbeat and emotionally hollow `Nowhere', for
example, features one of the best teenage casts I've ever seen.</P>
<P>Gregg Araki may be veering towards the mainstream, but
`Splendor' is his most accomplished work to date. More so, it is
the film that establishes Kathleen Robertson as a performer to watch.</P>
