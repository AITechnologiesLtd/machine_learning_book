<PRE>Halloween 4: The Return Of Michael Myers
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Donald Pleasence; Ellie Cornell; Danielle Harris; George P. Wilbur
& Michael Pataki</P>
<P>Halloween 4: The Return Of Michael Myers picks up where Halloween II left
off. (Halloween III had absolutely nothing to do with the Michael Myers
character -- proving once again that movie producers are not all rocket
scientists.) Anyway, it's years after the events of that infamous Halloween
night (Halloween & Halloween II) when Michael Myers went on a murderous
rampage and killed pretty much everyone in sight in the small town of
Haddonfield Illinois. We all thought good old Mike was stopped for good at
the end of Halloween II. But it's the movies, and more specifically a movie
about a bloodthirsty mass murderer, so we all know it pretty much takes a
howitzer to the head to stop them. For those who missed Halloween II, here's
the scoop. Myers' longtime psychiatrist, Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence)
seemingly blew himself and Myers up to end Myers' killing spree. It ended up
only scarring Loomis and putting the evil Mikey in a coma for a decade.
Well, Halloween is rolling around once again, and it's time for Mikey to get
up and go trick or treating again. This time he's off to a family reunion.
Seems he has a niece living in Haddonfield and, as is his custom, he pretty
much is forced to try to do anything he can to kill her. Like his last
murderous rampage, the body count rises fast and furious as Mike knocks off
anybody who happens to get within two feet of him.</P>
<P>Unlike the original Halloween movies, Halloween 4 has a higher budget. At
least in terms of production values anyway. The budget was obviously not
used to go after the best Hollywood had to offer in terms of acting talent.
With the exception of Pleasence, most of the actors seem to have been cast
for their good looks as opposed to their acting skills. If you've ever seen
a slasher flick, that shouldn't come as much of a surprise to you. Michael
Myers again dons his Captain Kirk mask painted white and his overalls. (At
least they didn't have to splurge on the wardrobe budget.) Although much to
my dismay, unlike the earlier films, there were no gratuitous nude scenes.
If it weren't for the enormous body count, this would be a PG movie. But
there is that body count, and most of the deaths are pretty violent.</P>
<P>I actually enjoyed Halloween 4. I really can't figure out why though. There
is nothing about it that really sets it apart from any of the other cookie
cutter slasher films. Perhaps I was just happy to see Michael Myers, one of
my favorite horror film characters, return after all those years. It's good
for a couple of hours of mindless entertainment, if nothing else.</P>
