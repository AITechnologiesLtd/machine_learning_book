<PRE>                         THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT has the bizarre distinction of being the
first horror film ever to give me nightmares *before* having seen it.
The nightmares will probably continue for awhile, even though BLAIR
WITCH is not, contrary to the reports I've heard, the scariest movie
ever made.</P>
<P>     Not even close.  The conceit of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is this:
Three eager filmmakers go into the woods of Maryland in search of
material for a project about `The Blair Witch,' a supposed woman who was
exiled from the town of Blair during the witch trial era.</P>
<P>     And today, the Blair Witch continues to ply her trade, as
interviews at the film's beginning make clear – stories of massacred
children and haunted houses have left a lasting impression on the
residents of Burkittsville (formerly Blair, MD).  All of this sets the
stage for us, plus a textual prologue telling us that these filmmakers
vanished, and what we are watching is the footage they shot, discovered
in the woods a year later.</P>
<P>     So we know up front that something evil is afoot, and in the 90
minutes of `discovered footage' we get to see plenty of it.  The trouble
starts when the trio gets lost, and their turmoil gets worse every day
(as they seem to be hiking in circles) and every night, when ...
something begins playing cruel tricks on them.</P>
<P>     Captured on videotape, black and white 16mm, and (I think) color
8mm, BLAIR WITCH is compelling as a faux documentary.  (And yes, *none*
of this is true, although most of the people in line and sitting around
us weren't aware of that.)</P>
<P>     But is this movie scary?  In a word, and on the whole, no.
Possibly a victim of its own hype, like STAR WARS, BLAIR WITCH has
plenty of atmosphere and creepy scenes (mostly unseen voices in the
woods), but it isn't that frightening.  My wife is a big wimp, and she
only grabbed my arm twice.  Not until the grand finale does the WITCH
trot out the Big Guns, and I will admit that the final images on screen
are some of the scariest I've ever seen.</P>
<P>     Still, two minutes of footage does not a stellar movie make.  The
other 88 are okay, and often funny, but it ain't horror.  However, for
the horror buff or indie film fan, this is a great example of something,
well, off the beaten path.</P>
