<PRE>                              THE FIFTH ELEMENT
                       A film review by John M. Bozeman
                        Copyright 1997 John M. Bozeman</PRE>
<P>Trailers for the 5TH ELEMENT have made made people wonder:
is the movie going to be another crummy sci-fi big budget
bomb done by people who don't understand the genre?  Or may
it's the "Star Wars of the '90"?  </P>
<P>The answer to this is:  It is neither.  The best way that
I can describe it is to say it is like H. R. Giger did 
"Blade Runner."  And made it a comedy.  </P>
<P>A description of the plot doesn't really do the film 
justice.  Most of the film is set about 200 years in the
future. Bruce Willis plays a down and out
cab driver, who used to be a crack special forces military.
One day he happens across a beautiful space alien (actually,
she's a clone of one in human form--it's a little hard
to explain) who, due to a big misunderstanding, is running
from the police.  Fortunately, Willis has just been 
assigned to hunt down some alien artifacts needed to save
the world from a really evil fate.  The same one that the
alien is looking for for the same purpose.  Too bad that
the Bad Guys--actually, several sets of bad guys--
are also looking for them, too.  Mayhem of course
ensues.</P>
<P>The best thing that can be said about the movie is that
it deals with some pretty heavy subjects (the destruction
of the world by evil forces) in a light-hearted manner.
In a way slightly like "Die Hard" and/or "Lethal Weapon,"
serious topics and violence alternate with very funny
events.</P>
<P>Other important stuff:  the acting is pretty good.  Bruce Willis
does a good job, as does the (cloned) alien (played by Milla
Jovovich).  And the main bad guy, played by Gary Oldman,
is well-done--sinister, yet with a comic/ironic edge.  
The sound track is very interesting, and the art direction
and some costumes are outstanding.  And there are a few
parodies of somebody who seems suspiciously like an artist
formerly known as Prince.</P>
<P>The film runs (with trailers) about 2 1/2 hours, but doesn't
seem that long.  Finally,  I would note that the people I 
was there with seemed to enjoy the film at least as much
as myself.  </P>
