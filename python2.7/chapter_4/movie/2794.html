<P>     "Everything is much different in EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN than the
other films I've made.  It has a bigger cast and a lot more complex
story line...  I started thinking about families and how they
communicate.  Sometimes the things children need to hear most are often
the things that parents find hardest to say, and vice versa.  When that
happens, we resort to ritual.  For the Chu family, the ritual is the
Sunday dinner...  At each dinner the family comes together and then
something happens that pushes them farther apart."
         - Ang Lee, writer/director of EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN</P>
<P>     Who said foreign films can't be fun?  Ang Lee's followup to his
internationally successful THE WEDDING BANQUET is a delicious
examination of the relationship between aging Chinese master chef Tao
Chu (Sihung Lung) and his three daughters.  The oldest, Jia-Jen
(Kuei-Mei-Yang), is an unmarried school teacher in her late twenties.
The middle daughter, Jia-Chen (Chien-Lien Wu), is a thriving corporate
airline executive whose career comes before all else.  The youngest,
Jia-Ning (Yu-Wen Wang), is a twenty year old romantic who works at a
Wendy's fast food joint.</P>
<P>     EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN is a more accomplished motion picture than its
predecessor--and THE WEDDING BANQUET was good enough in its own
right.  The comedy is spontaneous and relaxed, the drama is
finely-tuned, and the plot is seasoned with unexpected little twists.
The script delights in occasional forays just beyond the typical bounds
of a screenplay.</P>
<P>     Though filmed entirely in Taiwan (Lee's first film not to examine
cross-cultural issues), the themes of EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN are
universal.  The problems faced by the Chu family happen all around the
world, and the difficulty of communicating across the generation gap is
something almost everyone has experienced at one time or another.
Love, especially that of Chu for his daughters, often goes unspoken,
for to express emotion is to admit vulnerability.</P>
<P>     With an ease that marks the true craftsman, Ang Lee develops a
rapport between his characters and the audience.  These people have a
richness, texture, and depth that no stereotype could hope to match,
and which a film like Wayne Wang's THE JOY LUCK CLUB was grasping for.
The perfectly-proportioned measures of comedy and drama emerge through
character interaction, not as a result of contrived situations and
silly one-liners.</P>
<P>     For his cast, Lee has chosen a mixture of actors he has and has
not previously worked with.  The role of Chu was written with veteran
performer Sihung Lung in mind.  The actor appeared in a similar
patriarchal capacity in the director's PUSHING HANDS and THE WEDDING
BANQUET.  Also returning from THE WEDDING BANQUET are Winston Chao (the
reluctant bridegroom then and a co-worker of Jia-Chen's now) and Ah-Leh
Gua (the mother then and the obnoxious Mrs. Liang now).</P>
<P>     Food is as much a backdrop as a recurring symbol.  Chu's failing
taste buds parallel his loss for the zest for life.  Jia-Chen's love of
cooking harkens back to a frustrated childhood desire, and Jia-Ning's
work at a Wendy's makes a statement about the infusion of Western
culture into modern-day China.  Nevertheless, as with THE AGE OF
INNOCENCE, which displayed countless dishes guaranteed to whet the
appetite, EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN could perhaps be frustrating to any who
view it on an empty stomach.</P>
<P>     EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN is basted in its own wonderfully seasoned
juices.  Chu may have lost his taste, but writer/director Ang Lee has
definitely not.  A treat for those not scared off by subtitles, this
movie provides one of the year's most sincere views of family
dynamics.  Dealing with subjects that could easily have emerged
half-baked, Lee instead applies his talent and comes up with something
cooked to perfection.</P>
