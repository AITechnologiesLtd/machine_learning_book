<PRE>"The Gift"</PRE>
<P>Annie Wilson lives in the small Southern town of Blixton, Georgia, with her
three sons. The young widow has a knack for psychic vision and is called
upon by certain of the town folk to give readings, explain the past and
predict the future. Her talent is sorely tested when a rich socialite
disappears and Annie is called in by the police to help find the missing
heiress in Sam Raimi's "The Gift."</P>
<P>Director Raimi has had a most rewarding and eclectic career since his
breakthrough "Evil Dead" films. He has created stylish films like "The
Quick and the Dead," "A Simple Plan" and the sometimes beautiful "For Love
of the Game," always putting a different spin on each work. He continues
this track record with "The Gift," a supernatural thriller that is a
showcase for its star, Blanchett.</P>
<P>The story, by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson, is a middling entry for
Raimi that is, disappointingly, a conventional whodunit coupled with
supernatural power. Annie has psychic powers that allow her to help the
various members of Brixton society who have come to depend on the gifted
woman.</P>
<P>Her steady stream of troubled clients includes Valerie (Hilary Swank), a
badly abused woman who comes to Annie for help but refuses to follow the
psychic's advice to leave her violent husband, Donnie (Keanu Reeves).
Donnie, a real redneck's redneck, declares Annie a witch working for the
devil and threatens her and her boys with violence if she continues
interfering in his life. Another patron, the simple but very troubled Buddy
(Giovanni Ribisi), seems to be collapsing within himself over childhood
abuse by his father, but may hold the key to later events.</P>
<P>The crux of this southern Gothic yarn is the disappearance of society girl
Jennifer King (Katie Holmes). Jennifer is high school principle Wayne
Collins' fiancée, but Annie soon learns the young woman has a promiscuous
and selfish streak, catching her in flagrante delicto at one point. When
Jennifer disappears one night, her frantic father begs Annie to use her
power to find his daughter. The visions she has lead to the arrest,
conveniently, of Donnie, sending the wife beater to prison for murder and
out of Annie's life.</P>
<P>This is where the convention of the story replaces imagination. From here
on in, doubt is raised as to Donnie's guilt and one suspect after another
start to come out of the woodwork. Almost everyone who has a line in the
movie falls under the suspicious gaze of the camera as Annie's psychic
vision point to one, then another, possible murderer. It gets very
confusing and forces the story to unravel into a morass of faux
accusations. So many suspects crop up over the course of the movie that I
thought I was watching the psychic edition of "Clue." The whirlwind of this
whodunit replaces suspense with a series of false leads as the real killer
is eventually brought to justice.</P>
<P>As I said, "The Gift" is a showcase for the very talented Cate Blanchett.
Since her breakthrough performance as the young queen in "Elizabeth," the
actress has shown versatility and is capable of a myriad of accents and
characters. With her natural-sounding southern drawl, Blanchett pulls you
into her character and the danger and confusion that her gift can cause.
Even as she tries to help here clientele with her visions, she denies the
impact they have, repeatedly, when they involve her or her own. It's not
the best performance of the year, but it does further establish the actress
as one of the most talented in the business today.</P>
<P>The supporting cast surrounding Annie provide an assemblage of
two-dimensional characters, here to give cause to the mystery and not too
much more. Keanu Reeves shows himself to be an actor willing to go against
type and be something other than just a pretty face. As such, he brings
attention to his character, Donnie Barksdale, and you believe, though he is
a wife-beating jerk, he is no murderer. Hilary Swank does her best as the
one-note Valerie, but the Academy Award winning actress is not given much
to do as the abused wife - except to look extremely abused. Giovanni Ribisi
needs to get his agent to get him roles other than the simple characters he
has played of late. Greg Kinnear and Katie Holmes are miscast as a couple.
Holmes, in particular, is too young for the femme fatale she is supposed to
be.</P>
<P>The moody production fits the temperament sought for "The Gift" with the
dark, atmospheric night scenery and swirling fog. It looks good and couples
nicely with the story up to the first half. After that, as the tale gets
confused, the decent techs become background only.</P>
<P>The draw to "The Gift" is Cate Blanchett. She is worth the price of
admission, though the movie, overall, is less than her considerable
efforts. I give it a C+.</P>
