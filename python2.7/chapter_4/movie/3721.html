<PRE>                              JOHNNY MNEMONIC
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     No one I have known has actually ever accused Keanu Reeves of
being able to act.  This film will change no one's mind.  Johnny
(Reeves) keeps a straight face throughout the whole film.  If we are
looking to give him credit it must be that the plot is so ridiculous,
no one could have done any better.</P>
<P>     The film opens with a big splash across the screen:  INTERNET.
Innocent me, I thought maybe at last they have made a movie based on
real scientific electronic know-how.  Forget it.  That is the last of
any credible science fiction.</P>
<P>     In the 21st Century, the most important asset is information.  To
keep things secret and unavailable to competing corporations, "mnemonic
couriers" are employed.  Johnny is a professional courier who has a
chip implanted in his brain (did I say "brain?").  Into this chip
containing thousands of gigabytes of memory, Johnny is supposed to
store the information he has stolen.  As in everything, there is a
price and the price Johnny must pay for what he gets is that his own
childhood memory is removed to make room for the chip.  Little wonder
he looks befuddled.</P>
<P>     Others in this mess are Dona Meyer, Ice-T, Takeshi, Denis Akiyama,
Dolph Lundgren and a mysterious ghostly Barbara Sukowa, a strange ghost
in cyberspace.  Very weird film.</P>
