<PRE>_Urban_Legend_ (R) * (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>What hath Kevin Williamson wrought?  While the horror movie revival
spurred on by his _Scream_ has yielded a few decent entries in the
genre--_I_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer_, _Halloween:_H20_, and _Scream_2_
--it must be noted that Williamson himself had a hand in the writing of
those films.  Those Williamson-less post-_Scream_ efforts, among them
_Wishmaster_ and the recent _Disturbing_Behavior_, have been frightening
all right--frighteningly, insultingly _bad_.  Add to that list
_Urban_Legend_, which takes a promising premise and runs it through a
predictable meat grinder of idiocy.</P>
<P>The influence of Williamson on screenwriter Silvio Horta is clear in two
key areas.  First, the opening sequence, like that of _Scream_, is an
extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial
ball rolling.  This sequence, in which Pendleton College coed Michelle
Mancini (Natasha Gregson Wagner) is decapitated while driving, also reveals
the other obviously Williamson-esque touch: the killer's look.  Dressed in
a large hooded parka, wielding an axe, the killer bears more than a passing
resemblance to the _I_Know..._fisherman, sans the hook.</P>
<P>One thing Horta does not borrow from Williamson, however, is the
intriguing premise.  Students at Pendleton are being killed by way of urban
legends--those contemporary bits of "mythology" passed from person to
person, group to group, year to year that become so embedded in the social
consciousness.  It hardly matters if they are true or not, such as the tall
tale that Mikey from the Life cereal commercials died from a fatal
combination of Pop Rocks and Pepsi (he didn't).  Michelle, slain by the
"killer lurking in the backseat" of lore, is but the first to fall prey to
an urban legend come true; as the body count rises, fellow Pendleton
student Natalie (Alicia Witt) suspects not only a link between the murders,
but a personal link to her past as well.</P>
<P>The setup shows promise, but the story never takes off, due in large part
to Horta and the director, the aptly named Jamie Blanks, who fires round
afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares.  Too many of
the would-be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues, and the
film's chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that _Scream_ tried to
subvert, like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends
when they should--and could--run out the front door.  But that is just the
tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches; there's also the climactic
villain confession, in which a contrived and way-too-convenient motive is
revealed, not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick,
which is a cliche in any film genre.  Banks and Horta's (intentional)
attempts at humor are also lame; the fact that the best gags are lazy,
in-jokey references to the other credits of co-stars Joshua Jackson and
Rebecca Gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor.  Some
laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is
revealed, but I'm not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it
were meant to be so.</P>
<P>The filmmakers don't get much help from their onscreen talent.  I was far
from a fan of bland _I_Know..._ starlet Jennifer Love Hewitt, but I'd talke
her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic Witt, whose inept
attempts at emoting were often met with laughter; Witt has a pefect foil in
her equally pesence-challenged leading man, Jared Leto.  _Dawson's_Creek_
star Jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo; Gayheart displays all
the depth and range of, well, a Noxzema spokeswoman; and Robert Englund
lends the film little more than his Freddy Krueger pedigree as a folklore
professor.  Granted, the cast
is hampered by their material.  Loretta Devine, who has done some fine work
in films such as _Waiting_to_Exhale_, is saddled with the ridiculous role
of a Pam Grier-worshiping campus security guard.</P>
<P>The recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one
man--namely, Kevin Williamson--to stay alive.  If other filmmakers continue
to make such shoddy product as _Urban_Legend_, the genre looks to once
again go the way of screen slashers' many victims.</P>
