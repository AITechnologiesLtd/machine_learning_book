<PRE>FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS</PRE>
<P>What they don't tell you when you when you front the counter to buy your
tickets for this film is that the price includes a two hour hit of movie
mescaline.</P>
<P>So you never did drugs in the 60s? The 70s? Not even the 80s? Worry not. Now
in the 90s this movie is as good as, or better than, the real thing. And you
won't get busted.</P>
<P>This is a time warp film, designed to light up the remaining brain cells of
baby boomers with memories of all that social anarchy and chaos that
characterised the late 60s and early 70s. Gen Xers seeing this movie however
will probably continue to be quite mystified about what exactly the olden
days were like.</P>
<P>This film is not a story. It is an experience. There is no plot. A few
circumstances form a flimsy backbone for a few drug crazed days, mostly in
Las Vegas. The film is utterly faithful to the book by Hunter S Thompson.
Johnny Depp is utterly faithful to the spirit of the lead character, Raoul
Duke.  Benicio Del Toro taking the off lead as Duke's equally drug riddled
attorney Dr Gonzo is also true to his part. Terry Gilliam as director brings
in the best excesses from his days involved with the hallucinogenic Monthy
Python team.</P>
<P>But this film is something more than a drug riddled orgy of carnage and
destruction. It is also a pithy social documentary, focussed on the late 60s
but equally relevant to the late 90s. It is a sick view of a sick society.
In both a literal and metaphorical sense Fear and Loathing is an acid
commentary on the worst excesses, not only of drug taking, but of social
existence.</P>
<P>The two lead characters are quite obviously sick, depraved, drug crazed
animals, by any reasonable construction. They are never seen in anything
other than a totally wasted condition, and invariably behaving in the most
outrageous antisocial manner imaginable. They have a briefcase loaded with
every conceivable drug, all of which are swilled down with copious amounts
of alcohol. The entire film is shot through their eyes and hallucinations
abound as the special Fx team morphs the carnage that is their external
reality into the bizarre visions that reflect their drug induced internal
reality.</P>
<P>However – and here is where this film is so really outstanding – every other
character, every other scene, every other circumstance in the movie is also
a circus side-show or a freak attraction. The essential difference is that
all these other bizarre cameos all reflect an ordinary reality, uncoloured
by the Hunter S Thompson orgy of drugs. As such they are, by and large,
taken as unremarkable. It is only when this other kaleidoscope of human
freaks and weird events is juxtaposed against the lush technicolour
hallucinations of the two lead characters that the blurring between drug
induced fantasy and everyday reality becomes so obvious. The distinction
becomes impossible to detect.</P>
<P>Without exception every secondary character in this movie is a freak of one
kind or another. They are social misfits, they are physically abnormal, they
are distorted personalities or, as in the case of the DA Convention Against
Hard Drugs where every participant is seen with a cigarette hanging out of
his mouth, they are living contradictions of any notion of sense and
normality. Even Hunter S Thompson plays a cameo role – fortunately for cult
followers as yet another social freak masquerading as Mr Ordinary.</P>
<P>The setting for most of the movie is Las Vegas – a classic freak show
environment of its own. Utterly segregated by both physical location and its
inherent raison d'etre from any ordinary reality, this isolated city in the
desert offers the perfect surreal platform from where the two lead
characters can wreak most of their own hallucinogenic carnage.</P>
<P>This movie is rich in many ways. It is rich in its filming and its
execution. It is rich in its pace and – short of walking out -  the viewer
has no option but to go along for his own two hours of drug induced madness.
It is rich in characterisation and totally over the top. It is rich in
special Fx and it is rich in its ironic view of straight society. It is as
enthusiastically politically incorrect as one would expect from all of its
other excesses.</P>
<P>As every bit as much as this is a film of its time, Fear And Loathing is
also a film of this time. Little has changed about the freak show that
constitutes much of the fringes of our society, and which we somehow have
come to accept quite uncritically. It is only when the acerbic lens of this
movie is trained upon the absurdities and paradoxes with which we all more
or less peacefully coexist that we realise how fine the line between madness
and sanity really is. Importantly, as well, how impossible it is to actually
know where that line is drawn. Not to mention on what side of it we each
stand.</P>
