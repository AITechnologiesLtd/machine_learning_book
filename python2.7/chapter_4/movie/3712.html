<PRE>                                  CONGO
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1995 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Frank Marshall
Starring: Dylan Walsh, Laura Linney, Ernie Hudson, Joe Don Baker,
          Tim Curry
Based on the novel by Michael Crichton
Music by Jerry Goldsmith
Apes designed by Stan Winston</PRE>
<P>     After the success of JURASSIC PARK, Michael Crichton's name has
become an industry.  Anything with his name on it has been rushed into
production to cash in the coat tails of his dinosaurs.  In many ways,
CONGO is JURASSIC PARK without the killer reptiles.  Next to the
stunning prehistoric beasts, the killer apes of CONGO are merely just
impressive.</P>
<P>     If you look at CONGO on its own terms, instead of as a limp
pseudo-sequel to the most successful film of all time, CONGO is a good
old-fashioned action/ adventure film.  Director Frank Marshall manages
to recapture feel of old serials, and integrates this completely with
the modern look of the high-tech story.</P>
<P>     What really holds this film together are the performances of two
under-rated stars.  Ernie Hudson plays the guide.  He describes himself
as a great white hunter, who just happens to be black.  He does his
whole role as a cross between Errol Flynn and David Niven.  His black
"white" hunter allows him to address some of the racism inherent in the
African adventure genre.  He points to the falsity of Hollywood
stereotypes several times.  The other characterization holding the film
together is Tim Curry as a supposed Romanian philanthropist.  Curry
evokes the untrustworthy nobility of Bela Lugosi.  Why the other
characters allow him to tag along on the expedition, when it is clear
that is up to no good, is one of the unexplained mysteries of the
screenplay.  If they had kicked him out, however, the film would have
suffered greatly.  Hudson and Curry make this otherwise bland
expedition exiting to listen to when the action is at a lull.</P>
<P>     The science of the story is stripped down to a minimum.  Little of
the high tech nonsense is explained.  Part of it involves a talking
ape, some of the rest the search for the perfect industrial diamond.
Instead of bogging down in explanations of those elements, the
mismatched expedition moves from crisis to crisis quickly.</P>
<P>     CONGO is a series of political and natural disasters that get in
the way of the group and their uncommon goals.  What makes it a cut
above some other recent action films is a raft of good minor characters
and some very droll dialogue in John Patrick Shanley's fast paced
script.  Director Frank Marshall has been a long time associate of
Stephen Spielberg, producing such films as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  He
directs much of the film in Spielberg's style, but thankfully tones
down some of the childish schmaltz that has hindered many of
Spielberg's recent adventure films.</P>
<P>     Every film involving apes has to top the animal effects used in
the last great ape film.  Stan Winston does that here easily.
Considering how many people are credited with designing and working the
apes, that is not surprising.  A few of the ILM special effects in the
last part of the film have a slightly cheesy look, but in a way that
helps to remind one of the classic 1930s African adventure films and
serials that CONGO tries to emulate.</P>
<P>     No doubt many people will find fault with the depiction of Africa
as the land of lost tribes and corrupt governments.  Others will fault
the depiction of apes as carnivorous monsters.  CONGO at least makes an
effort to deflate some of the stereotypes and false notions that are
inherent in its genre.</P>
