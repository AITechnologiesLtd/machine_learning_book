<PRE>                           MY FAMILY/MI FAMILIA
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is the story of three
          generations of a Mexican-American family from the
          writer-director of EL NORTE.  Disappointingly too
          much of the plot is short subplot stories that have
          been told before.  While there are undeniably some
          moving scenes, the end result is not the compelling
          film it should have been.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Several films made for PBS's American Playhouse have been quality
motion pictures and beat most theatrical fare by a wide margin.
Eventually American Playhouse started giving theatrical release to some
of their productions before having them appear on television.  One of
their earlier and  definitely one of their better productions was EL
NORTE.  It was the story of a brother and sister who flee Guatemala and
its politics and illegally enter the United States.  That film was
written and directed by Gregory Nava.  With many of the same resonances
Nava has co-written and directed MY FAMILY.  Unfortunately, while this
film, also made in part for American Playhouse, is by no means a bad or
even a mediocre film, it fails to show the strength of EL NORTE.  MY
FAMILY is the story of three generations of the Mexican-American
Sanchez family told as a mosaic of individual stories.  The real
problem is that most of the individual stories are well-worn and
familiar.  The film tells how as a boy Jose Sanchez walked from his
home in Mexico to Los Angeles when the border was just a line drawn in
the sand.  Taking a gardening job at a wealthy home, he meets and
marries Maria (Jenny Gago).  He believes himself to be safe and secure
in the United States, but the hand of United States Immigration reaches
out and separates his family.  The bitterness of this injustice and the
rage it causes reaches out and destroys two of the Sanchez sons.  The
two boys are Chucho (played by Esai Morales) and Jimmy (played by Jimmy
Smits).  Almost a generation apart, young Jimmy idolizes Chucho.
Chucho becomes a likable and relatively benign Pachuco gang member,
just slightly on the shady side of the law.  He is severely punished
for legal offenses for which a richer man would have received a much
less harsh treatment.  Young Jimmy sees what happens to his beloved
older brother and grows to have an immense pent-up rage from the
injustices done to his family.  He is a rebel without any real cause
until time gives him something he wants to fight for.</P>
<P>     What is right with this film is that it is a moving look at a
community under-represented in film.  What is wrong is that the writing
is several notches below EL NORTE.  Too often the film tries to be
whimsical when a more serious approach would have been more effective.
Nava undercuts the realism of the drama scenes that are just a bit
funnier than they should have been, occasionally even unkindly turning
characters into caricatures.  And even the light dusting of the
supernatural does not help the credibility either.  And it seems to me
that when an old couple look at each other and sum up saying "It's been
a good life," it has to be because either they expect their lives or
the film to end in the next few minutes.</P>
<P>     Jimmy Smits has never been my favorite actor, but this is
certainly the closest he has ever come to being a powerful actor in a
serious dramatic role.  Esai Morales and Eduardo Lopez Rojas, the
latter as the adult Jose, coast through their roles without having to
show much emotional range.  Jenny Gago, on the other hand, carries much
more of the film than her low fourth-billing status would indicate.
Edward James Olmos and Mary Steenburgen have small parts.  The latter
seems to be present only to provide one of the film's two sympathetic
Anglos.</P>
<P>     I cannot say that there were not moments when MY FAMILY brought a
tear to my eye, so Nava must have been doing something right.  But as
epics about ethnic families go, other films have given us fresher and
more compelling material.  I give this a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
