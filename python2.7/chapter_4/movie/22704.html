<P>---Those of you in the Portland, Maine area can hear Mac VerStandig's 
movie reviews every Friday on the 98.9 The Point morning show---</P>
<P>The Cup, the first feature length film to ever be made in Bhutan, is a 
delightfully innocent piece that should be a strong contender in 1999's 
Best Foreign Film category.</P>
<P>Inspired by true events, The Cup is the story of an Indian monastery 
housing children with assorted international roots. The newest arrivals, 
Palden (Kunsang Nyima) and Nyima (Pema Tshundup) parted with their 
parents and were smuggled across the Tibetan border to the monastery so 
they could freely study Buddhism. The film touches upon the obvious 
politics of this delicate situation, but wisely shies away from handling 
the issue too seriously, something that would likely deduct from an 
otherwise lighthearted movie.</P>
<P>Awaiting the two new arrivals is Orygen (Jamyang Lodro), a 
self-confident and adventurous 14-year-old monk. Orygen has his own 
little near-religious cult that is celebrating its holiest of events 
which only occurs once every four year: The World Cup of soccer. Soon 
Ronaldo's biggest fan finds himself and his pals in a bind when they are 
caught sneaking out to watch part of the aforementioned tournament one 
night and are threatened with expulsion should they ever do so again. 
But the crafty Orygen wouldn't let the approaching final match pass by 
without his audience, and soon a surprisingly innocent plot is hatched.</P>
<P>One of the more fascinating aspects of The Cup is how the 1998 setting 
and the century old Buddhist traditions coexist. Orygen's wardrobe is 
2500 years old, but underneath he wears a soccer jersey. His walls are 
covered with a magazine clipped shrine to the sport, but he studies 
religion in bed. The list goes on.</P>
<P>Nearly all the young monks in the monastery find a certain fascination 
with soccer that goes beyond the concept of men fighting over a 
checkered ball. The singing of the National Anthems is a key point to 
the multi-national boys and the athletes on the field are truly 
ambassadors of their native lands.</P>
<P>The Cup is a very sweet film that should be well received by audiences 
that aren't deterred by subtitles. An upcoming release in the USA will 
likely lead to public note and boosted box office revenue can be 
expected should the country of Bhutan win an Oscar for their freshman 
attempt at the art. And even if no awards are collected, the nation's 
sophomore film will be eagerly anticipated.</P>
