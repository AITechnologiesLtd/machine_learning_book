<PRE>                               THE SIEGE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This film starts out like a police
          action film and just keeps getting better.  Islamic
          fundamentalists of varying factions, the FBI, the
          National Security Agency, and the Army all struggle
          with each other for power when terrorists target
          New York City.  This is a complex political
          thriller from Edward Zwick, perhaps one of the best
          we have seen since the 1960s.  Taut and well-
          directed.  Zwick gets a surprisingly good
          performance from Bruce Willis as an enigmatic army
          general.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10), +3 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Earlier this year when John Frankenheimer's RONIN was released I
was reflecting that it was a pity that nobody was making good political
thrillers like his THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and SEVEN DAYS IN MAY.  Now
just a few weeks later I think I actually have the thriller I would
have hoped for from Frankenheimer, but it has come instead from Edward
Zwick who has directed such films as GLORY and LEGENDS OF THE FALL.
But he has not done a political thriller since his excellent 1983 TV
movie SPECIAL BULLETIN, also on the subject of terrorism.</P>
<P>     The nightmare that everyone has feared has finally come about.
Islamic fundamentalist terrorists want to force the hand of the United
States government when a militant religious leader is kidnapped.  The
siege starts with a harmless paint bomb on a cross-town bus and
mysterious anonymous demands to "release him."  Anthony "Hub" Hubbard
(played by Denzel Washington) is an FBI agent working with an anti-
terrorism unit of the New York City Police.  But the investigation
leads him to the mysterious Elise Kraft (Annette Bening).  Kraft is
working for the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence
Agency, also fighting terrorists.  Somehow she is not willing to be
totally cooperative with the FBI.  Kraft, however, has contacts in the
Islamic community from her days spent in the Middle East.  Hub needs
her contacts and is able to obtain her cooperation without her
confidence.  While the CIA's goals may be the same as the FBI's, their
policies conflict and Hub is surprised how they are more competitors
than they are peers.  Both of their approaches are called into question
when the terrorist acts turn violent and there is more and more public
pressure on the President to counter the terrorists.  The President
declares a State of Emergency and calls in the military.</P>
<P>     Army General William Devereaux (Bruce Willis), a quiet
intellectual with a strong belief in civil liberty, cautions what a
mistake giving control to the Army would be.  As he puts it, "The Army
is a broadsword, not a scalpel."  But there is growing sentiment to do
something about the rising toll from the terrorist attacks and martial
law may be declared.  Now there are three different government factions
superficially cooperating but each struggling for power and pulling in
its own direction.  The issue becomes whether to defend the people at
the expense of their constitutional rights, or to protect the rights at
the expense of public safety.  Middle East foreign policy also comes
into question in interesting and morally ambiguous ways.  While this is
an action film, it never sacrifices the intelligence of the background
story.  While some of the moral issues do get resolved into a right and
a wrong, most are not resolved.  The gray areas of the questions pose
make THE SIEGE more interesting than Zwick's last film.  The much-
lauded COURAGE UNDER FIRE leaves little doubt at the end who is right
and who is wrong.</P>
<P>     Denzel Washington plays a certain kind of role with real
integrity.  But Hub Hubbard is essentially Nathaniel Serling from
COURAGE UNDER FILE or Hunter from CRIMSON TIDE.  Washington's character
of Hubbard is not much of a stretch for him, and is as familiar and
pleasant as a McDonalds hamburger.  I think of him as a better actor
than Bruce Willis, but that certainly is not true in THE SIEGE. Bruce
Willis's General William Devereaux is written as a complex character
and a man with conflicting attitudes and agendas.  Some will look at
his as being a little stiff in this film but underneath there are a lot
of factions warring within this man.  There are a lot of surprises in
Devereaux in this film and Willis makes them believable without
telegraphing them.  Of the roles in which I have seen Willis this
performance is second only to the one in IN COUNTRY.  Annette Bening is
also an enigmatic figure here.  Her alliances and past in the Middle
East has obviously left her very disturbed and both she and Willis
outshine Washington.</P>
<P>     There has been some discussion as to whether this film is unfair
to the Arabic community in this country. The filmmakers took something
of a chance placing the terrorists in a particular ethnic community.
It may not be for me to say, but the film has a balance of positive and
negative people from that community.  It will be interesting to see
what protests result.  This is a film that takes some chances, but I
think that the result is worthwhile.  I give it an 8 on the 0 to 10
scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
