<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>For three quarters of the film, an exciting, somewhat plausible thriller
takes place, that is even occasionally intriguing. Then it comes apart
and turns into routine Hollywood, cop-out stuff. As a result, this film
wastes splendid acting jobs by Clint, Ed, and Scott.</P>
<P>Clint is Luther Whitney, a renowned thief, who finds his way into the
hidden vault of the billionaire Sullivan's (Marshall) mansion and robs
him of his jewels and cash. But complications arise while Luther hides
in the vault, looking out from behind a one-way mirror, and Mrs.
Sullivan (Melora) comes home inebriated and begins having some rough sex
with Alan Richmond (Gene). He happens to be the President of the United
States. Things get out of hand, and when the two secret service agents
(Scott and Dennis) see that the President is about to get knifed to
death, they shoot Mrs. Sullivan. Gloria Russell (Judy), the President's
Chief of Staff, then starts the cover-up rolling. The result is that
Luther has to go on the run.</P>
<P>What remains entertaining is that the bad-good guy, Luther-- being
chased by the good-bad guy Alan-- while the good-good guy, the chief
police investigator in the homicide and robbery, Seth Frank (Ed), tries
to unravel the mysteries of the case. It is no mystery to the audience,
because they saw exactly what happened. So what this film is all about
is the amorality of the President and the absolute power he wields, and
the cat-and-mouse games between the police and secret service, and
Luther. There is also some romance going on, but of the blandest kind
imaginable, between Clint's estranged daughter (Laura), whom he still
cares a great deal about, and Seth Frank.</P>
<P>It is watchable hokum, with a hardly credible story, getting by solely
on solid acting jobs from the leads. The script calls for no bold
statements about the politics of the White House, which makes the film
rather weak in scope and purpose. Yet, the film is bearable, fortunate
to be in the hands of someone as deft as Clint; or else, with a lesser
director, it could have certainly sunk to an abysmally lower level,
though one wouldn't be far wrong thinking it has already sunk to that
level.</P>
