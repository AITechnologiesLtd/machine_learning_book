<PRE>                                  THE FULL MONTY
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
                        Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: *** (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>"It all comes off this summer" is the tag line for "The Full Monty," the
latest take on how the working class of Britain's industrialized north
contend with the devastating effects of economic depression.</P>
<P>As for Peter Cattaneo, the director of this audaciously sweet comedy, it
*does* all come off: "The Fully Monty" is as big a crowd pleaser as they
come, a film full of little, special moments rather than big ideas or
ambitions.</P>
<P>"The Full Monty" opens with an authentic-looking documentary trumpeting
Sheffield's burgeoning steel industry.  "This is a town on the move!"
warbles the enthusiastic narrator.  He neglects to say in which direction,
however.  Twenty-five years later the factories have closed and with them
the loss of thousands of jobs.  Men like Gaz (Robert Carlyle, the psychotic
Begbie in "Trainspotting") and his best mate Dave (Mark Addy) are two of
the affected, reduced to stealing steel girders from the abandoned mills in
order to make ends meet.</P>
<P>When they happen upon a packed-to-the-rafters nightclub hosting an
appearance of the Chippendales, the Gazzer has an idea to scrape up some
dosh.  How about him and his mates going one better?  The full monty!  Or
sans G-strings, as we might say over here. The only problem is they're all
either overweight, over the hill, or overly ordinary.</P>
<P>"The Full Monty" is, essentially, a one-joke movie but it's handled with
such charm and levity that the one joke is funny enough.  "Brassed Off,"
another recent example of the genre, was distinctly lacking in charm, full
of irritating characters that you didn't really care about.  The unemployed
steelworkers of "The Fully Monty," by comparison, are sympathetic,
endearing, even lovable blokes.  You laugh with them, not at them.  And
because they actually try to do something about their plight--earning, in
Gaz's case, enough money to be able to pay child support to see his
son--you wind up rooting for them, no matter how ill-advised their scheme
might seem.</P>
<P>The scene at the Job Centre is even funnier in context than it is in the
trailer: a gangly line of shiftless factory workers starts shifting, slowly
and instinctively bumping and grinding in unison to Donna Summer's "Hot
Stuff" wafting in over the loudspeakers.  It's a wonderful moment of
perfect comic timing.</P>
<P>Simon Beaufoy's script touches on some serious matters (such as the
objectification of women, when the guys realize that the audience might
find them as lacking as they find some of the models in the girlie
magazines), but doesn't let these get in the way of the tomfoolery.  It's a
wise decision.  Carlyle is solid as Gaz, but more impressive are Addy, and
Tom Wilkinson as their former foreman, the garden gnome-fancying Gerald,
who teaches the boys a step or two.  Addy and Wilkinson skillfully portray
men who's self-esteem has been badly bruised and it's these honest
characterizations, coupled with a breezy, easygoing style that make "The
Full Monty" as infectious as a Donna Summer disco hit.</P>
<P>It's sure to leave a silly grin on your face.</P>
