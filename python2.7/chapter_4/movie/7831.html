<PRE>                       E.T. - THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>***
1982, PG, 115 minutes [1 hour, 55 minutes]
[science fiction]
starring: Henry Thomas (Elliot), Dee Williams (Mary), Robert MacNaughton
(Michael), Drew Barrymore (Gertie), written by Melissa Mathison, produced by
Steven Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy, directed by Steven Spielberg.</P>
<P>It's difficult to make a movie that can put itself forward as a "family"
film and actually be enjoyed by everyone in the family. "E.T." succeeds in
that area because it has a little bit of everything to it; comedy, science
fiction, and an overall warm and fuzzy feeling. However, it does stumble a
bit as it tries to carry three genres simultaneously. Nevertheless, the net
result makes up for any problems.</P>
<P>The film starts out like any science fiction story with an alien ship
landing in a forest clearing near the typical American suburbs. No details of
the aliens are given, we are only shown movement through the trees and bushes
which builds great suspense. Suddenly a few trucks arrive and men search the
area hoping to find something just as the spaceship takes off, accidentally
leaving one of their own behind.</P>
<P>We then cut to a typical suburban setting with a group of kids playing and
trying to one-up each other. Kids, especially siblings, are always fighting
with each other, which can make for great comedy when done right. Elliot
(Thomas) is a young boy trying to fit in with his older brother and his
friends, when they send him out on an errand, he notices something weird
going on in their shed. He uses a clever method to get the alien to follow
him back to his room.</P>
<P>After Elliot starts to get to know "E.T.," and introduces him to his brother
Michael (MacNaughton) and sister Gertie (Barrymore), the film almost becomes
a straight comedy. There are many funny scenes that take place when Elliot
and E.T. start to share the same mentality. As E.T. rummages through the
fridge and drinks soda and beer, Elliot starts to get drunk and belch while
in school. There is also the use of the joke where the mother, Mary
(Williams), is always in the wrong place at the wrong time and if she would
only turn around she would see E.T. </P>
<P>The second act is certainly the best as there is an easy going atmosphere to
it. Michael and Gertie talk and act how real kids would in the situation.
They constantly bicker and never seem to become smart all of a sudden, most
films wouldn't know to use details like these.</P>
<P>The only problem is the fact that the family is being watched by government
scientists who use sneaky methods to spy on them. Almost no details are given
about these secret characters, because their faces are never shown, and their
actions seem to be depicted in such a blatant "bad guy" labelling manner. The
mood constantly switches from comedy to lighthearted drama. E.T. has magical
powers of sorts, but at the same time he seems rather stupid. Mixing magic
and children always makes for melodrama, and that happens here when E.T.
makes Elliot's bike fly, but this detracts from the credibility (if he could
fly, couldn't he just fly home?).</P>
<P>E.T. and Elliot seem to be dying, and when the scientists walk into the
house wearing astronauts' suits, the credibility factor continues to drop.
The mood seems to change on a dime, and the ending is a little too much of a
Hollywood-style fairytale.</P>
<P>"E.T." is the kind of innocent film that could have a profound message, but
doesn't realize how much potential it has. (2/1/97) (6/11/97) [also by
Spielberg: "Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade," "Jurassic Park"]</P>
