release. 90 min. Rated R (language, sex).</P>
<P>The title of this movie, cryptic and quite forced and precious, seems to
mean that while a person's fingerprints are always the same, people's
natures (psyches, characters) can change. The people in question are the
now grown children of Lena (Danner) and Hal (Scheidel).  For the first time
in three years, the brood join their parents for Thanksgiving, in a rather
luxurious farmhouse in Maine (the film was shot in Bethel and Andover).</P>
<P>Daughter Mia (Moore) brings along her male companion Elliot (Kerwin), a
psychotherapist. Jake brings his girl Margaret (Davis). Warren (Wyle) comes
alone, still brooding over the break, three years ago, with his great love
Daphne (Bareikis). The youngest child, a girl, is Leigh (Holloman).</P>
<P>Mother Lena is sweet. Father Hal is a near-silent, sullen, often unpleasant
patriarch. Mia and Elliot are not a good couple. Jake and Margaret are, and
make love vigorously and noisily, often in odd locations. Later on Warren
and Daphne are reunited. All the couples copulate.</P>
<P>The assembly is one of W.A.S.P.s who are often waspish, with the Pulitzer
Prize for unpleasantness going to Mia. She's lavish with insults, snide
remarks and complaints.</P>
<P>There is a general unease about this household, where spats and repartees
are frequent, where there are times when you think that everyone hates
everybody else. It's more complex than that, however. But the movie does a
peculiarly confusing job of editing at the expense of giving us information
about the characters, and at the detriment of dimensionality. This may be
compounded for some viewers by the plethora of blonde women (all
good-looking), awkward flashbacks, and minimalist dialogue scenes
(sometimes ponderous). You might get the impression that all are deranged,
save for the sensible and natural Leigh.</P>
<P>As per first-time director Freundlich (a product of New York University's
film and TV programs) "When you're an adult coming home, your parents look
at you as if you're still a child. Yet you've been out making your way in
the world, feeling like an adult." Etc.etc. But that's not really shown in
the movie.</P>
<P>Freundlich, about the age of the younger characters, seems to identify with
them, while making them identify with him. This results in a film that has
mature ambitions but an adolescent texture. Among several jejune matters
are the inter-relations of just about all; the basic lack of interest, for
us, of the characters, even though the performances are very good (for what
they are); the humorlessness of the whole thing, in spite of a few funny
lines and in spite of Freundlich's stating that the film is funny; odd
reactions, such as the grown-up children being revolted at the idea that
last night their parents made love; the peculiar affair (if there is one)
between Mia and a fellow kindergartener who now calls himself Cezanne (!).</P>
<P>The new director is promising, but his first feature is more like a
personal settling of family accounts. Been there, done that..</P>
<P>It is nice to get detailed pressbooks for new movies, but in this case, the
fact that the writer-director takes almost 10 pages to explain his film,
makes you wonder if he mistrusts the work speaking for itself. One the plus
side, some bits of the film and the dialogue are OK, and the production
values are most professional in the staging, framing and especially the
excellent photography.</P>
