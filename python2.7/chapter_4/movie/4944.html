<P>     Another TV sitcom ("The Phil Silvers Show") mined for the movies,
SGT. BILKO stars Steve Martin as the famous fast-talking master sergeant
who will do anything for a buck.  He runs the base casino-- that is,
motor pool-- under the unsuspecting eye of his commanding officer (Dan
Aykroyd).  He also has a gambling-addicted fiancee (Glenn Headly), who
doesn't seem to mind being repeatedly left at the altar.  (He wins her
back, each time, with a card game.) Only with the return of an old
nemesis (Phil Hartman), is Bilko forced to adjust, adapt, and, of
course, come out smelling like a rose.</P>
<P>     As contemporary combat comedies go, STRIPES is still the one to
beat.  SGT. BILKO lacks a strong story, ensemble, or lead.  The script
is an abomination that recycles the decades-old material with nary an
original twist.  (The plot involves some nonsense about a "hovertank.")
The laughs are there, in spots, but nothing in the movie builds upon
itself.  A wealth of comic opportunity is wasted, along with good actors
Hartman and Headly.  (The smaller players score minor hits, as does Dan
Aykroyd's underplayed base boss.)</P>
<P>     The biggest misfire is Martin, who belongs here but doesn't.  He
lacks the steely shiftiness to make the role his own.  (A better choice
would be someone like, say, Rip Torn.  Of course, *he's* not a box-
office draw.) Martin doesn't *command* SGT. BILKO, but he does *carry*
it.  His limitless energy and precision timing single- handedly keeps
the film in step, and that's a performance worth watching even if the
movie isn't.  And, yes, that's Phil's daughter Catherine playing one of
the auditors called in to check Bilko's financial records.  Directed by
Jonathan Lynn (MY COUSIN VINNY). </P>
