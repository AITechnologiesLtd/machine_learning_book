<P>     Charlie MacKenzie (Mike Myers) hasn't had the best luck with
women, although the problem is more with him than his dates.  He can't
commit (the notion of marriage frightens him to death), so whenever a
relationship starts to get serious, Charlie finds an excuse to dump
her.  Hey, if she smells like beef vegetable soup, that's a good enough
reason.  This time, however, Charlie is really smitten.  There's only
one problem--an increasing amount of evidence seems to point to
Harriet (Nancy Travis) as being the mysterious Mrs. X, a woman who is
suspected of having married, then killed, three men.</P>
<P>     A good indication that this movie didn't work for me is that I
never cared whether or not Nancy Travis' Harriet was an axe murderer.
The characters--and it's not just her's--are so paper-thin that it
doesn't make a difference who lives or dies, and who does the killing.
There isn't enough life in these people even to consider them
caricatures.</P>
<P>     P. D. James need not worry.  The creative team behind this film is
not poised to steal away her title of the "Queen of Crime."  Mysteries
are supposed to be complex, intriguing, and beguiling, with the
audience unsure of the truth until the very end.  None of these things
is true of SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER.  In fact, the solution is so
obviously telegraphed that it's possible to have the answer fifteen
minutes into the movie.  Of course, given the number of logical flaws
in the resolution, it's a safe bet that you won't have gotten
everything right.  It's impossible to predict things that don't make
sense.</P>
<P>     So, having established that there's no reason to care for the
characters and that the murder mystery plot is as feeble as they come,
that leaves only the comedy to comment on.  As I've said before, any
movie can overcome flaws if it's funny enough.  Laughter is the best
paint to hide the cracks in the story.  John Cleese's A FISH CALLED
WANDA is an excellent example of this.  Unfortunately, SO I MARRIED AN
AXE MURDERER is not.</P>
<P>     Not only is the humor banal, it's only fitfully amusing.  For
every joke that works, there are half a dozen that fall flat.
Apparently Mike Myers thinks he's a lot funnier than he actually is.
The whole Scottish shtick with Charlie's father (also played by Myers)
wears thin quickly, but Myers keeps pushing it long after it's ceased
to elicit more than forced chuckles.</P>
<P>     There are three nice cameos in the film.  The best of these
belongs to Alan Arkin, who plays a nice police chief trying to act
tough to please one of his detectives.  Arkin is only in a few scenes,
so there's not enough time for the gag to get overused.  Also good is
Charles Grodin as a car driver who refuses to let his vehicle be
commandeered.  Finally, although not quite as good as the other two,
but still worth a mention, is Phil Hartman's Alcatraz security guard.
Excepting perhaps Leslie Nielsen, few actors do deadpan better than
Hartman.</P>
<P>     There's nothing in SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER to make this film
worthwhile entertainment.  It's about as unspectacular a production as
there is, with the typical level of juvenile comedy that the writer,
director, and actors think is funnier than those stuck in a theater
watching the picture.</P>
<P>     Sneak previews of SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER paired this movie
with WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S 2.  The thought of sitting through these films
back-to-back makes me shudder.  One at a time is bad enough, but both
in four hours?  Of the two, SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER is the better
production.  Not much better, but an improvement nonetheless.  Faint
praise indeed, considering the competition.</P>
