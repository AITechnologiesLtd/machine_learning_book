<P>     About forty minutes into STEPMOM, I came to a numbing realization...
well, two actually.  The first was that I knew exactly where this domestic
drama was headed and could predict scenes and confrontations far down the
road.  The second was that I knew we were still 90 minutes away from the
closing credits.  As the film ever-so-slowly unfolded, I began to realize
what five credited screenwriters can buy you:  perhaps the most
inefficient screenplay of the year.</P>
<P>     There's some promising human drama in the premise, which begins with
conflict in an extended family.  Photographer Isabel Kelly (Julia
Roberts), living with divorced attorney Luke Harrison (Ed Harris), is
struggling to gain the acceptance of Luke's daughter Anna (Jena Malone)
and son Ben (Liam Aiken).  Making the task even harder is Luke's ex-wife
Jackie (Susan Sarandon), who undercuts Isabel at every turn and rails at
her every parenting miscue.  What Isabel doesn't know is that Jackie is
battling an even tougher adversary than a potential stepmother for her
children:  cancer.  As she confronts her mortality, Jackie also confronts
her fears of being replaced in her children's hearts.</P>
<P>     That's an interesting enough twist on the complicated emotions and
allegiances of extended family interactions, one that could have made a
tidy feature weeper.  Unfortunately, absolutely nothing about STEPMOM 
could be called tidy.  If a situation or relationship calls for a scene to
establish it, STEPMOM provides two or three.  Isabel bonds with Anna over
an art project (one of the film's few truly affecting moments), then bonds
with her over a musical number; everyone panics over Ben when he
disappears in a park, then panics over Ben when he falls off a jungle gym.
STEPMOM appears to have no faith that we'll understand the significance of
a character's actions unless those actions are underlined, making it both
insulting and redundant.  Every turn of character is so deliberately
structured, you might suspect that every subsequent screenwriter came in
just to add another half dozen scenes, and no one threw anything out.</P>
<P>     STEPMOM's narrative unwieldiness also makes it extremely hard to
connect with any of the many plot lines.  Isabel struggles with balancing
career and her new family, Jackie struggles with balancing her health and
her family, Anna struggles with how she should respond to the new woman in
her father's life, and Ben (played by Liam Aiken with the kind of fulsome
adorableness that gives child actors a bad name) struggles to find new
things to giggle at.  Ed Harris, meanwhile, struggles just to find a few
minutes of screen time.  With all the complexities involved in these 
family dynamics, dear old dad remains a complete enigma.  "You're a great
dad," Jackie tells Luke in once scene; "I just never gave you the chance
to realize it."  That sentiment will probably apply to the entire
audience, which may forget there's a father anywhere to be found.  For a
film about getting your priorities straight, STEPMOM sure doesn't.</P>
<P>     Of course, it's understood that this is to be a showcase for the two
lead actresses, and we shouldn't begrudge them a showcase when lead
actresses generally get the treatment Harris gets here.  Roberts and
Sarandon are both quite good in their roles, Sarandon in particular
bringing a wonderful steely maternalism.  They're just stuck in the kind
of film which has become director Chris Columbus' specialty:  cheap comic
relief which gives way to Big Messages of understanding.  STEPMOM is a big
emotional mess of a movie, one which grows increasingly irritating as
karaoke production numbers and one tearful goodbye after another chew up
minutes of screen time.  Good actors deserve better than a script that --
strangely enough -- looks like pieces of the work of five different
writers stitched together to form a movie.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 over-extended families:  4.</PRE>
