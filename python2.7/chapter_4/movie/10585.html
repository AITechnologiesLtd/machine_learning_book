<P>     Because I have been privy to the forty years of screen history which
followed it -- particularly the past fifteen or twenty years -- I watched
almost 90 minutes of THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER with a combination of
technical admiration and vague consternation.  The problem was Harry
Powell (Robert Mitchum), the sinister minister who drives the narrative.
Dressed in a preacher's garb, Harry arrives in a small town to do as he
has done many times before:  rob a widow of her wealth before robbing her
of her life.  His target is Willa Harper (Shelly Winters), whose husband
shared a jail cell with Harry before his execution for killing two men
during a bank robbery.  The loot was never recovered, and only Willa's two
young children John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) seem to
know the whereabouts of the $10,000, though neither one is talking.
Spouting scripture and impressing the gullible townsfolk, Harry insinuates
himself into the Harper family to begin a greed-driven reign of terror.</P>
<P>     You can't blame me for fearing that THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER would
turn out to be the prototype for more recent films depicting Christians as
either a) homicidal zealots, b) unctuous hypocrites or c) simple-minded
buffoons, if not all three.  With his "love/hate" finger tattoos and his
creepy repetition of a single old spiritual, Harry is a nightmare vision
of perverted religiosity.  </P>
<P>     But THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER takes a surprising turn late in the
film.  Pursued relentlessly down the river by Harry, John and Pearl come
into the care of an elderly woman named Rachel (Lillian Gish) who has
taken to caring for orphans.  In a moment of chillingly perfect clarity,
Harry hovers menacingly at the garden gate, crooning that same solitary
spiritual:  "Leaning, leaning, leaning on the everlasting arm."  Rachel
recognizes the tune and begins to sing along, at which point it becomes
clear that Harry is omitting a fairly significant word from his version.
The word is "Jesus."</P>
<P>     THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER has earned much of its praise over the years
for director Charles Laughton's stark visual style, praise it certainly
deserves.  Some of Laughton's compositions are remarkably assured for a
first-time (and, sadly, only-time) film-maker, haunting images of Harry as
a dark horseman on the horizon, and of a dead woman's hair streaming
underwater.  There are also unexpected flashes of wicked humor, including
a woman's can't-believe-they-said-it-in-1955 reference to her sex life as
"ly(ing) back and thinking of my canning."</P>
<P>     It is the canny set-up of Harry and Rachel as the "love" and "hate"
on Harry's fingers, however, which will linger longest in my memory.
Many conservative critics have railed against the movies as a haven for
Christian-bashing, charges which only bear the whiff of truth because the
films criticized don't do what THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER does.  Harry Powell
may be a horrible human being, but he's not horrible because he's a
Christian.  Screenwriter James Agee makes Harry's fire-and-brimstone faith
a pathology justifying his selfishness and misogyny; Rachel interprets her
faith as a call to selflessness and defense of the defenseless.  The
narrative depth and cinematic richness of THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER both end
up coming from the same place:  a juxtaposition of light and dark which
can be as satisfying and inspirational as it is bleak and disturbing.</P>
