<PRE>                                TO DIE FOR
                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1995 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Gus Van Sant
Written by Buck Henry
from the novel by Joyce Maynard
Music by Danny Elfman
Starring Nicole Kidman, Joaquin Phoenix
U.S.A., 1995</PRE>
<P>     TO DIE FOR is an ambitious little flick about the seductive lure
of stardom, the suggestive power of Nicole Kidman's lips, and the
promise of liberation held by a teenage flunky with a handgun who's
willing to lose everything for your love.  The movie is ambitious, and
sounds terrific on paper, but director Gus Van Sant (MY OWN PRIVATE
IDAHO, EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES) can't pull everything together to
make any impact at all.  It's enough to make you wonder what he's doing
with this script in the first place.</P>
<P>     Nicole Kidman is TO DIE FOR as Suzanne Stone, the small town TV
"weather girl" who makes international tabloid headlines when she's
accused of having her husband Larry (Matt Dillon, doing fine) murdered
by her teenage lover Jimmy (Joaquin Phoenix) and his friends Russell
(Casey Affleck) and Lydia (Alison Folland).  Joyce Maynard's novel is
apparently a fictionalized version of a very true incident in a small
New Hampshire town, but the movie excludes any understanding of that
situation by chasing its own tale, a cautionary comic book painted in
broad strokes and saturated colors.</P>
<P>     Screenwriter Buck Henry and director Gus Van Sant go ga-ga over
their own technique in the first few shots, when Suzanne and other
characters address the camera directly, as though being interviewed for
a TV news special report.  Janice, Larry's lesbian sister, explains
that she knew from the start that Suzanne was a four-letter word
beginning with C (we're left to fill this in from the backs of our own
filthy little minds, but the word she's looking for is cold).  Lydia
holds forth for the camera on Suzanne's philosophy and TV-centric world
view.  Jimmy mumbles half- articulately about how in love he is with
Suzanne.  And the parents of Suzanne and Larry are guests on a talk
show, explaining that they knew the marriage was doomed from the
start.  All of this is intercut, of course, with objective flashbacks
illustrating the events the characters relate.  The novelty of this
approach wears off almost immediately, and the herky-jerky cutting back
and forth from scene to scene becomes tiresome, albeit appropriate to
the movie's theme.</P>
<P>     Maybe it's a shame that the studio has given TO DIE FOR away, both
in the marketing campaign (Nicole Kidman = murderous sexpot) and in the
movie's own title sequence, which runs headlines and lurid tabloid copy
underneath the credits over and over again.  There's really only one
major event in the whole film, and the surrounding material seems
edited by an iron fist wrapped around a machete--Whap! Whap!--no
surprises at all.</P>
<P>     All that's left for the audience is to sit and wait to see the
thing itself happen, and it happens pretty much the way you expect.
You might expect Suzanne's casual cruelty to be shocking, but her
dialogue is strictly rote.  Kidman's performance is perfectly vacuous,
with the corners of her mouth tugging this way and that as she titters
a little over every superficial thing.  Her name is suddenly being
bandied about as Oscar material, suggesting that critics still love it
when a woman can sex it up and play the embodiment of female evil at
the same time.  She's certainly something to look at, but her
performance shares a calculated coldness that turns the movie blue.</P>
<P>     So it's cold, but it's not quite a corpse.  Where is the beating
heart of TO DIE FOR? Well, Van Sant still has style to spare, and his
sympathy is obviously with the kids, who are better drawn than the
other characters.  In a funny way, Lydia is allowed to be the smartest
person in the whole film, reflecting at length on Suzanne's world view
while managing to keep at arm's length, and becoming her own kind of
celebrity.  Pudgy Lydia is the antithesis of Suzanne, who's clearly
Miss America material even if she's not quite wholesome.  And when we
see Susan in her underwear, it's either to make a point of her distance
from Larry or to show her cajoling a promise from her teenaged lover.
Meanwhile, the camera lingers on Jimmy's trembling, naked body,
obviously far more intrigued by the nature of his lost soul than
Suzanne's corrupt one.  More lively is a devilish twist near the end of
the film, and watch out for Canadian director David Cronenberg in a
cameo.</P>
<P>     The real problem is that for a black comedy, TO DIE FOR is
mighty unfunny.  Finally, the movie's own cynicism does it in.  TO DIE
FOR is mainly contemptuous and condescending, with little of the wit or
insight that marks a strong comedy.  Reviewers have been comparing it,
believe it or not, to Pulp Fiction, apparently believing that the two
movies share a hip self-awareness.  But that's dead wrong.  Where
Tarantino worked Pulp Fiction through with an honest, burning urgency
and some kind of moral message that managed to transcend its own
essential brutality (hey, it's more fun than it sounds), Van Sant can't
lift TO DIE FOR out of its own narcissistic meanderings.  Here's a
movie that's very pleased with itself, but doesn't really speak to us.
The message here? Every stereotype you've ever heard is absolutely
true.  If she goes down on you, you'll do whatever she says.  Loser
children with no future live in trailer parks and listen to abrasive
heavy metal.  The world is a stupid, superficial place. (Like we needed
Gus Van Sant to show us that!)</P>
