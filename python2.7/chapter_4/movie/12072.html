<PRE>BROADCAST NEWS
**** of **** grade is A+</PRE>
<P>James L. Brooks made Broadcast News based on people he met in the news
industry.  What he created with that material is one of the best films
of the eighties, a smart, romantic and honest film about the love
triangle of three people serious about the new they provide.</P>
<P>Tom (William Hurt) is not educated, yet he is attractive and good on
camera causing his status to rise. Aaron (exceptional and funny Albert
Brooks) is the ideal reporter, educated and able to write wonderfully
but has some problems on camera causing him to be overlooked. Jane
(Holly Hunter) is a news reporter who has long been friends with Aaron
and yet falling in love with Tom.  Yet Tom 'personifies everything shes
been fighting for,' in the job of trying not to seel out and become
entertainers instead of educaters.  The fact is that Jane has her
biological clock ticking with reckless disregard and she is attracted to
Tome (as long as he doesn't talk).</P>
<P>This is the setup for what could have been a standard sitcom type film
but rises to become one of the most honest and telling portraits of love
and the relationship of men and women.  The acting, directing, and
especially writing is so smart and snaps perfectly into place.  Small
scenes work.  Not one point is off in this film, I wouldn't change a
scene.  James L. Brooks proves to be one of the best writers in the
business and continues to prove it later with As Good As It Gets.  This
film doesn't know the meaning of easy way out.  This film has too much
respect for us.  Watch a film like Titanic and then watch this or Say
Anything... and you will notice that great honest movies will leave you
feeling more impact when the characters misstep or take the direction
that you wouldn't advise.</P>
<P>I'm reviewing this movie in 98 and it is had not to incorprate the
modern times into the review.  I noticed the=at the delima revolving
around Jane in this film was Style or Subsatnce, much like the Best
picture Oscar race this year, Titanic Vs. LA Confidential.  Titanic was
all style lacking the substance of most great films, including LA
Confidential which may not have been as astesticly appealing but at
least didn't insult us by being pretensious.  Putting Broadcast News on
tht level adds a new level to a film which just gets better and better
and better.</P>
