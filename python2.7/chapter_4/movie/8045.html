<PRE>                         THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>Chad'z rating: **** (out of 4 = excellent)
1994, R, 142 minutes [2 hours, 22 minutes]
[drama]
Starring; Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne), Morgan Freeman (Red), Bob Gunton
(Warden Norton), William Sadler (Captain Hadley), produced by Niki Marvin,
written and directed by Frank Darabount, based on the novella "Rita Hayworth
And The Shawshank Redemption" by Stephen King.</P>
<P>"The Shawshank Redemption" is unlike anything I've ever seen before. It's
not about a hero trying to overcome a struggle, as the entire film is blatant
in telling us this will never happen. Instead, what makes it great is its
characters and all its many individual events. </P>
<P>The story revolves around Andy Dufresne (Robbins) and his wrongful sentence
to Shawshank Prison. Of course we meet many other characters and see events
typical of prison films, but this one is scripted, filmed, and acted much
better than any other prison film. Most prison settings depend on violence
and profanity to make for a dark, rough atmosphere, but this film tells a
much grimmer story without using this elements gratuitously.</P>
<P>If prison breeds criminality, than its administrators are no exception.
There is Captain Hadley (Sadler), the stern head guard who takes pleasure in
beating prisoners, and Warden Norton (Gunton) who seems nice on the outside
but turns out to be just as corrupt as the men he incarcerates. </P>
<P>The prisoners themselves seem to be some of the nicer characters, especially
Red (Freeman) -"the guy who can get stuff." Red is a nice guy, he admits he
was stupid and wrong to have committed his crime, but can never seem to
convince the parole board of this.</P>
<P>Not much happens here in terms of plot, it is mostly just character and
environment study. A subplot begins to form as Andy helps Norton and Hadley
extort and embezzle thousands of dollars. Andy also tries to get the prison
more funding for a library, and an interesting mystery concerning Andy's
chance at freedom crops up, but all of this is just a backdrop for the film's
many philosophies about humanism, freedom, justice, and love.</P>
<P>The evil, oppressive establish in George Orwell's "1984" said "freedom is
slavery" and we see just how true that is through the eyes of these men.
Granted, they would rather not be in prison, but when their friend Brooks is
finally released, he realizes how easy he had it inside. Although they must
work within the prison, all their basic needs are provided. Brooks can't
handle the responsibility and this makes for a powerful theme of prison being
an alternate reality.</P>
<P>Another interesting and thematic philosophy occurs when Andy and Red have a
discussion about hope. Red says hope is the one thing that truly imprisons
him. Once one gives up hope he is free from its grasp. Andy counters by
saying just the opposite - hope is the one thing that will give them a sense
of freedom. The guards can beat them all they want, they can be rejected for
parole, but they can't take away one's sense of hope and dignity.</P>
<P>"The Shawshank Redemption" does have many scenes and events that might be
depressing because of the harshness of reality, but the film has a happy
ending that really makes you think. Andy and Red never give up hope and this
ultimately leads to their freedom. </P>
