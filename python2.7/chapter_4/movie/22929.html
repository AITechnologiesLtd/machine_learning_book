<PRE>ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S PSYCHO
Film Criticism By Zachary McGhee</PRE>
<P>Rated R (re-rated for video release, though it's
not clear why; the film met censorship standards
for its original release and contains only mature
themes and off screen violence), 110 minutes.
Anthony Perkins, John Gavin, Vera Miles, Martin
Balsam, and Janet Leigh. Screenplay by Joseph
Stefano. From the novel by Robert Bloch. Directed
by Alfred Hitchcock. Paramount/Universal.</P>
<P>"A boy's best friend is his mother." That line,
uttered desperately by Anthony Perkins' Norman
Bates during the infamous conversation between he
and Janet Leigh, frightened me more than anything
which came before it, or followed. The wispy vocal
presentation, the secrecy of Norman's attitude; he
yearns to protect what he knows is evil, for many
reasons. First, loyalty to his mother, and
secondly, a perverse, sexual longing that Norman
has for Leigh's Marion. If she knew the truth,
what he was concealing, she would never, in
Norman's mind, entertain the idea of sexual
congress of any kind with him; in reality, she
would never consider it regardless, she sees right
through him-to a degree; she obviously doesn't
spot the murderous intentions and psychological
torment going on inside this poor boy-she sees
that he's being manipulated, that he's protecting
something, though she doesn't detect precisely
what.</P>
<P>Everything that Alfred Hitchcock tried to inspire
in the viewer exists in that scene, everything
about human emotion, hidden desire, pain, lust,
and voyeurism (see the birds, lurking in the
background of the frame, and later in the film
when Norman spies on Marion as she undresses); the
recognition of those basic, but covert, elements
of the human psyche, that third face which we
build to conceal our very selves with the facade
of compassion were what Hitchcock was most
interested, what he most deeply explored in his
films. See Leigh sitting there, her body language
conflicting; she closes off to this young man
because, although he's personable enough, there is
something obviously wrong. She senses it, she
strives to decipher it, but she can't. Not, at
least, to the point of saving her own life. Just
as Norman refuses to acknowledge his own
underlying distress, she refuses to recognize the
depth of the danger which surrounds her. He tries,
as much as he can, to open up to her, because he
truly begins to care for her; she wouldn't have
died if he didn't.</P>
<P>Friday, December the Eleventh, 2:43p.m. We pan to
a hotel room in Arizona; two lovers are inside
after a romantic encounter, flirting with one
another. She is Marion, he is Sam Loomis (John
Gavin). She wants to marry, he's content meeting
in hotel rooms on the weekends, paying his
alimony. They part, nothing's been settled. He
retreats to his home in CITY, she returns to work.
A large sum of money comes into her possession and
she steals it, hoping to take it to Sam so that
they might be married. It begins to rain as she
drives, she grows tired, weary, sees a little
motel, the Bates' Motel, stops there for the
evening, chats with the young man, Norman Bates,
who runs it under guidance from his contemptible
mother, steps into her cabin for the evening,
decides to return the money the next day, takes a
shower in preparation for bed, and someone comes
in and quickly and brutally murders her.</P>
<P>"He liked that whole introduction to the movie; he
liked that it was going to be about her, and then
we were suddenly going to do this awful thing to
you and say, ‘No, no, it's not about her, it's
about him'," recounted screenwriter Joseph Stefano
of his meetings with Hitchcock. The deception is
most effective, leading to not only one of the
greatest films of all time, but also revealing one
of the themes of the film: manipulation.</P>
<P>Psycho was based, loosely, on the novel by Robert
Bloch of the same name. Having read the book for
the first time roughly a year-and-a-half ago, I
can say that it is a very powerful, striking piece
of writing, but it has little in common with the
subsequent film. "We never mentioned the book; we
never returned to the book again," said Stefano.
The changes made in the translation to the screen
are appropriate, putting to shame the adaptations
of many modern novels to film. In the book, Norman
has regular conversations and arguments with his
mother, and descriptions of her are given, making
the end revelation a little less obvious, and
indeed the ending itself is rather ambiguous until
the absolute conclusion (i.e., Norman, Norma, and
Normal). Stefano's script is more subtle than
ambiguous. He and Hitchcock instead opted to
create an incessant theme of our maternal
attachments, with very few conversations overheard
between Norman and his mother, which, in the film,
makes the subject matter much more personal.</P>
<P>Take, for example, the framing of the scene in
which Norman wraps Marion's body, carefully
constructed so as not to show the nude, lifeless
remains. Obviously censorship standards at the
time would not have allowed it, but I doubt that
the scene could have had such power otherwise; the
mental firewall, the detachment, which Norman
constructs for himself in that scene-which is the
only way he ever could have concealed such an
grotesque, evil act as a character-is communicated
flawlessly with this technique, and drives the
audience's self-examination of their own ego,
their individuality, and how we as human being are
able to, as Roger Ebert says, build mental
firewalls between our outward personalities and
the evil or sinful deeds which we commit.</P>
<P>The performances are heartbreaking. Perkins'
Norman is a poor, misguided man who earns our
sympathy quickly, if incorrectly (at least, as far
as morality goes). Leigh is a little more distant,
and aptly so, until her final moments when our
hearts weep for her. John Gavin remains equally
aloof, a man who can't quite deal with or accept
the inevitable. Vera Miles as Marion's sister,
Lila, is more greatly sympathetic; rightfully
angry, but not hostile. And Martin Balsam's brief
stint as the inspector seems out of place to us.
He does his job, and we know that, but because, at
the time, we sympathize more with Norman and Lila
we don't understand the scope of his performance
until his violent death. The score by Bernard
Herrman is the soul of Psycho. Herrman's orchestra
was all strings, no percussion or brass, but
rather an eerie, stark representation of our inner
selves, Herrman never lets up.</P>
<P>And then there's those final moments. The one flaw
among perfection. The psychiatrist's speech.
Stefano fought for it, because it was something he
knew; he was in analysis at the time Psycho was
made and found an explanation necessary. Really,
though, ambiguity was more fitting here; to
dismiss and explain away the madness, the torment,
the suffering, the chaos of the past hundred
minutes undermines the preceding material. "Hitch
called it a hat grabber," he said. Indeed,
Hitchcock had his doubts about it, but Stefano was
adamant, and I'd have to agree with the master. If
the speech was cut, Norman's experience would not
have been easily labeled and resolved as a mere
"condition", but rather as an unexpected,
unexplainable force of evil, like John Carpenter's
Michael Myers in Halloween. No explanations, no
resolutions. Just a terrifying, and therefore more
disconcerting, power.</P>
<P>Still, it's a minor qualm. If I had my way, I
wouldn't have sat through seven, count ‘em seven,
Halloween films in the first place, none of the
Psycho follow-ups would've never been made, and
Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt would've been "just
friends" at the conclusion of As Good As It Gets.
The speech in Psycho only dents, but does not
destroy, the ultimate reputation of Hitchcock and
his masterwork. Psycho is a devastating, potent
motion picture from one of the greatest, most
insightful directors who ever lived.</P>
