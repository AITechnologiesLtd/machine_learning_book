<P>`Anna and the King', the latest adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's
renowned musical `The King and I', is a sumptuous and attractive epic
that manages to mask a great number of it's problems with a steady
dosage of beautiful imagery. There is impeccable detail applied to the
costuming and set designs, enough to captivate the audience over
droughts where both the pace and dramatic interest lags a bit behind.
You may be squirming in your seat periodically during this 2 hour, 30
minute epic - but luckily, two engaging stars are present to make the
experience a comfortable one.</P>
<P>One is Jodie Foster, who plays strong-minded British schoolteacher Anna
Leonowens, a woman who makes a long and perilous journey to Siam so that
she can tutor an influential young boy. The lad is the son of King
Mongkut of Siam (Chow Yun-Fat), who rules his people with strict
standards and cultural balance. Anna conducts herself with strong will
and incredible courage for a woman in her era, confronting the King and
demanding sufficient quarters even when she's not permitted. She is
bold, to be sure, but she is also wise in more areas than the King can
imagine. Anna winds up the enter royal family (which is... large), and
lecturing them in the ways of the West with their father's approval. I
had no doubt Foster could handle the role of the brisk and strong-minded
Anna, and she does, with believable authority and appealing wisdom. I
was happy, though, to see Hong Kong action superstar Chow Yun-Fat snag
the role of the King. Despite the fact his two American thrillers (`The
Replacement Killers' and `The Corruptor') have flopped, I was optimistic
about Chow's ability to handle a major dramatic role like this. He, like
his enthusiastic counterpart, pulls through with an admirable effort.</P>
<P>`Anna and the King' features a screenplay that tends to be clumsy and
meandering, but mainly the film is reasonably well written. There is
light humor sprinkled about and channeled successfully through awkward
meetings between King Mongkut and Anna, and plenty of amusing material
surrounding the plot device of the King having 26 wives. How could you
not crack a few good jokes with that little bit of information? For a
steady 90 minutes, `Anna and the King' resembles just the sort of epic
story that Hollywood is famous for. The performances click, the visual
content is spellbinding, and director Andy Tennant (`Ever After')
manages to successfully engage the viewer with continuous beauty.</P>
<P>And then, there's a little slip-up. Tennant stretches the film to an
unnecessary 140 minutes, testing the average viewer's patience with
scenes that ring with monotony and loss of dramatic impact. If the
running length were cut short by a half-an-hour or so, then perhaps the
initially absorbing material and lavish set designs would be better
appreciated while the audience exits the theater. In it's present state,
with the film ending on a sour and empty note, some of the good
qualities are bound to be forgotten. But despite it's length, `Anna and
the King' manages to radiate enough working star power and attractive
imagery to suffice as an entertaining epic, even if it falls short of
some potential.</P>
<P>It's also too violent in certain areas - never extremely graphic, but
too often unsettling (especially for younger viewers). But, if there is
one thing you can't pass over with giving due notice, it's the sheer
beauty of the entire production. Expect an Oscar-nomination or two in
the categories of costuming and cinematography, but little more. Both
Foster and Yun-Fat grace the screen with their style and pizzazz, but
nothing is particularly Oscar-caliber in the performance section. Bai
Ling (`Red Corner') is strong in a small but important role as the
King's latest concubine. Ultimately, `Anna and the King' loses it's
grasp on certain possibilities for prolonging it's running length for
the wrong reasons (a war is materializing, the leads begin to grow
apart...). But it's still a nice filler, boasting solid performances and
an attractive look that will appeal to viewers of all ages. Just try to
concentrate on the good stuff, and pick a comfortable seat.</P>
