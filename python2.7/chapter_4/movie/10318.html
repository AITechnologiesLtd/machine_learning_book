<P>If TOMORROW NEVER DIES, then how long will it take before James Bond is
eliminated? Obviously a bloody long time. Even though the first James Bond
film, DR. NO, was released 35 years ago, he's still going strong. Hell, James
Bond should be retiring by now. He *should* be well over 60, but luckily, due
to casting changes over the years, Bond is still young and fit as a fiddle,
and I don't see him taking his prune juice shaken and not stirred anytime
soon.</P>
<P>In this installment of the long-running super spy films, James Bond (Pierce
Brosnan) is up against a Ted Turner wannabe named Elliot Carver (Jonathan
Pryce). Carver owns a communications company that oversees a growing newspaper
called "Tomorrow", and is now branching out into television with aspirations
of even more. Carver's elaborate schemes will enable him to one day rule over
the media, including exclusive control in China. Not only that, but just to
piss people off, he's going to colorize all the classic movies. Ok, I lied
about that, but this guy is still devious.</P>
<P>This whole scandal is first suspected when a military fowl up results in the
deaths of several Navy officers off the coast of China. It seems the Chinese
told the H.M.S. Devonshire to turn back when it entered Chinese waters, but
the technology inside the British vessel was saying otherwise. Convinced they
were in international waters, the British stood there ground, and eventually,
a group of terrorists killed both the British soldiers and a couple of Chinese
fighter pilots as well. The Chinese think the British attacked. The British
think the Chinese attacked. Only we know that Carver was behind it all,
setting up the entire escapade for the sake of getting "good news".</P>
<P>So why does anybody suspect fowl play? Good question. The answer lies in
Carver's satellites, which were broadcasting on the same frequency as the
ship. Could Carver have intentionally messed with the signal? And, as Carver
himself admits, the more important question is "why?".</P>
<P>Naturally Bond sets out to figure it out and put a stop to it all, sleeping
with beautiful women, driving fast cars, and using whatzit gizmos created by Q
(Desmond Llewelyn) until in the end, he saves the day while never messing up
his hair. That's right - it's typical Bond. Wildly outrageous, totally
implausible, and two hours of brainless action. That's all we expect, and
that's all we want. Bond is merely a testosterone ridden Richie Rich for
adults, and TOMORROW NEVER DIES fits in just fine. But it's also nothing new
whatsoever, and there's only so much of the same stuff we can see.</P>
<P>What makes this one a little more fun and unique is that Bond actually teams
up with someone, and the two are nearly equal in their performances and "hero"
factor. Michelle Yeoh makes her English speaking debut here as Wai Lin, a
Chinese special agent who finds herself on the same trail as Bond. When they
continuously run into each other, convenience has them forming a team to
combat against Carver and his thugs. Yeoh is impressive and a delight to
watch, adding a spark to the film. In fact, if this had been more of a Bond
solo film again, we might actually realize enough is enough. Not with Yeoh.
She keeps things fresh, alive, and (thank heavens) new.</P>
<P>Teri Hatcher also has a small role as Carver's wife, Paris. Hatcher, who
became known for her sexy TV interpretation of Lois Lane, doesn't stand out in
anyway, but doesn't do too bad of a job with her role either. Her lack of
screen pizzaz could be attributed to the little screen time she receives.
She's in this a lot less than you might expect, especially after being used as
a hook in television commercials and movie trailers. In other words, if you're
out to see this film just to drool over her, you'll be spending five bucks for
about fifteen minutes of screen time. That's expensive oogling.</P>
<P>Also known as "Bond 18" for being the 18th "official" entry in the series,
TOMORROW NEVER DIES is the second Bond film to star Brosnan, who rose to fame
as TV's Remington Steele. How good of a job he does at portraying 007 is
something that was likely discussed heavily in reviews of GOLDENEYE, which
was, of course, his first outing as the British secret agent. Seeing as how I
didn't write a review of that film, I'm going to use this opportunity to give
my two cents - Connery will always be the best and truest Bond there was, but
Brosnan comes in a definite second. The thing that Brosnan lacks is *true*
charm. Yes, he's debonair, subtle, sophisticated, seductive, and even
articulate, but unlike Connery, he doesn't have that twinkle in his eye. You
can envision Connery bursting into a hearty laugh. Brosnan, on the other hand,
seems a bit *too* polished and serious.</P>
<P>Bond enthusiasts will, of course, find it crucial to see this film, and
they're not going to be disappointed. If you're not overly fond of 007, or if
you actually haven't seen him before, this is not the one to convert you to
Bondism. It goes way overboard, as any good Bond film does, yet still manages
to leave you passive to the events unfolding on screen. I guess the main
problem is that it's just getting a bit old. I actually found myself bored as
the film was wrapping up. My mind was wandering, and I was trying to see my
watch in the dark to see how much longer it could possibly go. It's not awful
- it's just beginning to feel like we *have* been watching Bond for 35 years
after all.</P>
