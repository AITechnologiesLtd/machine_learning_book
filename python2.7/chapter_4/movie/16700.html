<PRE>BLAST FROM THE PAST</PRE>
<PRE>** 1/2 (out of 4) - an enjoyable movie</PRE>
<P>Release Date: February 12, 1999
Starring: Brendan Fraser, Alicia Silverstone, Christopher Walken, Sissy
Spacek, Dave Foley
Directed by: Hugh Wilson
Distributed by: New Line Cinema
MPAA Rating: PG-13 (brief language, sex and drug references) </P>
<P>Everyday life has a certain odd humor to it, especially to the
uninformed viewer. Many of us have grown accustomed to it, having been
frequent observers of "everyday life" for most of our lives. But pop
sitcoms like "Seinfeld" have made millions by showing us how funny life
really is, and now cinema has taken up that task as well. Like last
year's HOLY MAN, which took a character unfamiliar with modern society
and dropped him into pop culture, BLAST FROM THE PAST gives us a fresh
and envigorating look at what society really is. </P>
<P>This brand new perspective of the ordinary is accompanied by quite a few
laughs, too. Aided by Brendan Fraser's innocent countenance, which he
used to great effect in 1997's GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE, and the
straight-faced humor which Christopher Walken has mastered, the script
manages to engage the audience in a charming manner. Although the jokes
are rough on the edges early on, by the middle of the movie's 110-minute
running time the comedy is very polished. </P>
<P>Directed by Hugh Wilson, who helmed the first POLICE ACADEMY movie,
there's no reason it shouldn't be polished. Wilson also wrote the script
with rookie scribe Bill Kelly, and it tells the story of the
quentessential 60's family, the Webbers. Although perhaps a bit
eccentric, everything appears normal until we learn that Calvin Webber
(Walken) has been constructing a fallout shelter underneath his garage,
and when news of the Cuban Missile Crisis breaks, Calvin and his wife
Helen (Sissy Spacek) go underground for thirty years. It's there that
Helen gives birth to Adam (Fraser), whom the Webbers raise on their own
for nearly thirty years. Only then does Adam return to the surface to
give us the AUSTIN POWERS-esque situation of a man from the sixties
stuck in the nineties. </P>
<P>While on the surface, Adam unwittingly meets and charms Eve Rustikov
(Alicia Silverstone), with the help of her gay friend Troy (David
Foley). Both Silverstone and Foley play these roles perfectly, with
Silverstone developing excellent romantic chemistry and Foley doing
humorous asides. They make the movie a joy to watch, and the script,
which takes a nearly implausible premise and makes it happen, is also in
good form. Boiled down, BLAST FROM THE PAST is simply a bread-and-butter
romantic comedy -- the narrative cop-out of an ending gives this away --
but it's good, clean, fun and that's all that counts. For those not
looking for the serious drama of weepy love affairs, this is the ticket.</P>
