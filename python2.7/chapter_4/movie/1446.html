                      Film comments by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>   - Victor Halpern created the zombie film with the 1932 WHITE ZOMBIE.  He
     pretty much lucked out.  The film is poverty-row all the way.  It has
     cheap sets, low production values, and bad acting.  But some of its
     images are undeniably very effective and it manages the feel of a
     nightmare.  Like CARNIVAL OF SOULS, the film just clicks somehow.  But
     was it luck or skill?  Four years later he made his second zombie film
     and it sank like a stone.  The idea just did not have appeal.  REVOLT
     OF THE ZOMBIES was about bringing dead soldiers back to life as zombies
     so they could be the ultimate fighting soldiers.  So UNIVERSAL SOLDIER
     is the second film that idea has sunk.  Well, admittedly, it is other
     problems that sink UNIVERSAL SOLDIER, but it is interesting that this
     idea was used before.</P>
<P>   - Van Damme is Belgian.  He has a Flemish accent, sort of guttural and
     Germanic.  Maybe I am not that good with accents.  But I can tell you
     his accent is neither Cajun nor Creole.  His parents in the film
     certainly don't have accents like his.  So what gives?  How did he end
     up with this accent?  Maybe we'll be hearing that Arnold Schwarzenegger
     has been cast as Sergeant Rock!</P>
<P>   - I guess Van Damme is now officially Carolco Action Figure(tm).  Carolco
     seems to cut these guys out with cookie cutters.  They seem to be
     martial artists with foreign accents, and the way some people
     habitually smoke after sex, they pun after killing people.  I think
     they got the idea from James Bond films.</P>
<P>   - Nice photography of Hoover/Boulder Dam.  Also it is impressive to see
     someone running down the side.  To me that is more impressive than all
     the acrobatic kicking which mercifully is saved until the final reel.</P>
<P>   - Why does the opening sequence remind me of PLATOON?</P>
<PRE>   - It is always nice to see Jerry Orbach, even if this film underuses his
     talents.</PRE>
<P>   - I guess when you die you forget how to eat, you forget many of your
     polysyllabic words, and you pick up a funny accent.  You learn not to
     worry about your friends getting shot as long as they don't smoke and
     they remember to buckle up.  The after-life must be a lot weirder than
     anyone imagined.</P>
<PRE>   - I give it a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
