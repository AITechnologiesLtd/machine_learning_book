<PRE>                              THE LATE SHIFT
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<P>        Sure, the late night talk show wars of the past few years 
were silly, but that was no reason to make such a half-hearted 
caricature movie about them. Based on a book which took its topic 
seriously and was actually interesting, THE LATE SHIFT is a 
made-for-HBO feature that tells the story of the Jay Leno vs. David 
Letterman dealings that took place when Johnny Carson announced 
he was stepping aside and NBC had to decide who was to fill the 
slot.</P>
<P>        Treated properly, this would have made a great movie, but 
the makers of THE LATE SHIFT movie put precedence on finding 
actors who resembled their real-life counterparts rather than finding 
actors with talent. Still, the Leno and Letterman look-alikes are 
some really bad imposters who look like a cross between living 
caricatures and those rubber creeps from the Duracell battery 
commercials. Anyone with a bad wig and cigar looks a little like 
Dave, and anyone with dark hair and a prosthetic chin looks a 
little like Leno. Anyone period could match the actors here for 
sheer talent.</P>
<P>        "Saturday Night Live" stars Joe Piscopo and Kevin Nealon 
did far better Letterman and Leno impersonations, and both could 
have definitely been booked for this movie, so if they were going 
for people who could do good impressions, why not go for those 
two? They're obviously not below booking down-and-out comedians 
because they've got Rich Little playing Johnny Carson, which lends 
no credibility to the role, because most of the time Carson is 
supposed to deliver serious lines in such a badly impersonated 
voice, which renders them nothing but laughable. Same for Jay and 
Dave, whom we're supposed to take seriously but can't because the 
imposters are doing such a bad job.</P>
<P>        There's no excuse for them not getting real talent to play 
the network executives, whom most of us have never seen or heard. 
The only decent acting talent in the movie is Kathy Bates, playing 
Leno manager Helen Kushnick, and she seems out of place in such 
a second-rate movie. Still, her bitch-from-hell performance is a 
welcome diversion from the cavalcade of crap the rest of the movie 
is. I couldn't tell if it was meant to be laughable or was just so awful 
it took on a camp value. Either way, it made a travesty out of a 
compelling book.</P>
<P>        But even with amateur direction (including camera angles 
straight out of the 60's "Batman" show during Letterman's tirades), 
bad acting and a cheap synthesizer score probably stolen from a 
porno movie, an interesting story still manages to break through 
sometimes like the tiny sun rays that shine through dark storm 
clouds in little fingers of warmth. The inside dealings of the NBC 
executives, Letterman's GODFATHER-like meeting with superagent 
Michael Ovitz, Leno eavesdropping on an NBC board meeting, it's 
all made innately interesting by the knowledge that it all actually 
happened even though it is rendered badly.</P>
<P>        Certain portions of THE LATE SHIFT are watchable, 
particularly those portions featuring Kathy Bates, and most people 
who haven't read the book find the movie version fascinating just 
because they haven't devoured the inside information in the far-
superior written version, but the poor choice of actors directed 
badly and accompanied by bad music makes it a sour adaptation 
for those of us who have read Bill Carter's book. In the words of 
Judy, the perky Time-Life operator, "Read the book."</P>
