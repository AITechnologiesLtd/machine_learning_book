<P>GET OVER IT (2001) ** 1/2  Directed by Tommy O'Haver. Written by  by 
R. Lee Fleming Jr. Cinematography, Maryse Alberti. Editing,  Jeff 
Betancourt.  Production design, Robin Standefer. Music, Steve Bartek. 
Cast: Kirsten Dunst (Kelly), Ben Foster (Berke), Martin Short (Dr. 
Desmond Forrest Oakes), Melissa Sagemiller (Allison), Colin Hanks 
(Felix). Swoosie Kurtz and Ed Begley, Jr. (Berke's parents), Sisqo 
(Dennis), Shane West (Striker). A Miramax release. 87 minutes. PG-13</P>
<P>Do we need another teen flick? Do we need a hole in the head? We 
don't, assuming that "we" stands for minimally mature, objective and 
sophisticated viewers. But since the huge market for youth movies 
fills Hollywood's coffers, such pictures will be made ad infinitum 
and ad nauseam.</P>
<P>Still, once in a blue moon something acceptable pops up. "Get Over 
It" --filmed last summer in Toronto--has an unzapping title, comes 
unannounced,  had no advanced hoopla or press previews. But it is 
sort of OK.</P>
<P>The basic plot is strictly deja suffered through --since the dawn of 
cinema. Boy meets girl,  boy plus girl, boy minus girl, boy and other 
girl, other girl sweet on and better for boy, boy too dumb to see 
this -- until the last reel.</P>
<P>Fate (read US mobility) separates childhood playmates Allison and 
Berke. They meet again in high school, become sweethearts in a flash. 
After 16 months of cohabitation and bliss (at least on Berke's part) 
Allison drops him. For him it is like a sudden attack by friendly 
fire. Allison's reasons are not specific, but rather interestingly 
illustrate the French saying " tout casse, tout passe, tout lasse," 
meaning that sooner or later " everything breaks, goes away, gets 
tiresome."  Allison is emblematic of the many and short relationships 
of "celebrities." In fact, 16 months and 3 days is a long 
relationship-affair-mariage by Hollywood standards.</P>
<P>The girl did not ditch Berke for another fellow, yet soon enough she 
starts an affair with Striker, whose prestige includes having been in 
a boy-band. The new twosome successfully try out for the school's 
spring musical "A Midsummer Night's Rockin' Eve." (That show is 
after, you know, Shakespeare, sort of.)</P>
<P>The inconsolable Berke, still hoping to get Allison back, also tries 
out --against all logic--for the musical, for which he is not 
qualified (his thing is basketball) but somehow he makes it. Felix 
(Colin Hanks, the son of Tom Hanks) his best friend, has a cute 
younge sister, Kelly. She writes songs and sings pretty well.   She 
helps, instructs and encourages Berke, who, of course, does not 
notice that Kelly is drawn to him. But give them time. (Felix is 
protective of his sister, but this doesn't add anything significant 
or useful to the movie).</P>
<P>Expectedly mild developments and predictable complications ensue -- 
nothing really original or notable, with the big exception of the 
musical's director. The composer-writer of its twelve songs, its 
producer and part author (move over, William S!) this flick-saving 
character is the school's Chair of Fine Arts, Dr. Desmond Forrest 
Oakes. In a style as theatrical and grandiose as that name,   Martin 
Short plays him with all stops out,  no holds barred, alternating 
between cutting criticism, merciless put-downs (but you know he's 
deep down a kind person), booming imperial commands, haughty advice, 
sage orders and self-promoting declarations. and steals the show over 
and over again.</P>
<P>Short has been around quite a bit, on TV and in movies. The latter 
did not do right by him. They were mostly mediocre items, with an odd 
exception --odd because that was Short's first major role.
The 1986 hilariously absurdist take-off "Three Amigos!" by John 
Landis, also starred Steve Martin and Chevy Chase. It is still an 
underrated feature but has many partisans, of which I am one.</P>
<P>  In "Get Over It" Martin Short is given the best lines, in fact the 
only funny ones. "Bill Shakespeare was a  wonderful poet, but Burt 
Bacharach he was not!" The absurdism of this declaration is anywhere 
from amusing to delicious, depending on one's taste. So is Short's 
over-the-top, no-holds-barred mannered delivery, flamboyant in choice 
of words, intonation, gesture and body language. It's also 
gay-leaning, so that it comes as a surprise, a joke, or a gag (you 
choose) when late in the movie his secretary tells him "Your wife 
called." This bit is the only raison d'etre of Mrs. Oakes.</P>
<P>When the film was shot, Short was a youthful 50. Most of "the kids" 
were in their early twenties, but this is not blatantly obvious. What 
is however is that very strong impression that the film was cut down 
to its unusual  87 minutes, no doubt to qualify for a PG-13 by 
removing raunchy or vulgar passages.</P>
<P>Some of the latter remain, and might have been excised too, but then 
the film would have shrunk too much. Whether or not the cuts are the 
guilty parties, the picture is episodic, fragmented and choppy. This 
vagueness is not lethal, since the two best elements appear to be 
intact: Martin Short, and the updated Midsummer Night's Dream which 
we see often, in sections, from rehearsals to fantasy scenes to the 
final product. That's when things fall in place, love blooms, the 
villain is punished. There is quite a bit of pleasing imagination as 
Shakespeare, the musical and the lives of the students mix and 
reflect one another. It is the second movie by director Tommy 
O'Haver, whose debut was "Billy's First Hollywood Kiss."</P>
