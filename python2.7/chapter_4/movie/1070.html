                       A film review by Laurie Mann
                        Copyright 1991 Laurie Mann</PRE>
<P>     I've been depressed and overworked lately, and looked for a comedy
at the video store.  Even though it was about teenagers and suicide (not
two of my favorite subjects) I rented HEATHERS.  It was a very erratic
black comedy, but worthwhile, particularly if you like Winona Ryder or
Christian Slater, or if you hated high school.</P>
<P>     Parts of HEATHERS are very dreamlike, and these parts are intercut
by fairly accurate portrayals of the chaos of high school.  Ryder plays
the confident of a group of vacuous high school girls, all of whom are
named Heather.  Ryder is fascinated by Slater, the bad, new kid at
school, and son of a man who blows up buildings for a living.  After one
of the Heathers embarrasses her, Ryder decides to take her revenge.  But
the revenge turns out to be a murder, and it's "rearranged" to look like
a suicide.</P>
<P>     The movie is a little ragged on the edges, but its portrayal of the
mind set of high school students and teachers is right on the money.
And both Ryder and Slater turn in terrific performances.</P>
