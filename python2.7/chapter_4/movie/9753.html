<P>Late in "Everyone Says I Love You," Woody Allen and Goldie Hawn, playing 
a divorced couple, slip out of a benefit in Paris and go for a walk. 
After a bit, they sit and chat about the times they've had, about love, 
about relationships. They exchange a gentle, platonic kiss and then, on 
the banks of the river Seine, they dance. As the moonlight reflects off 
the water they dance gaily and, quite casually, Goldie Hawn's feet leave 
the ground. She slides, spins and glides ever so smoothly through the air,
 comfortably, as if she's done it all of her life. Hawn glows as she 
dances in air, so alive that even the law of gravity steps aside for a 
few moments. That elegant, utterly transcendent scene is one of the most 
wonderful things I've ever witnessed in a movie.</P>
<P>"Everyone Says I Love You" is Woody Allen's 26th film and his first 
musical. I've avoided Allen's work for some time. That business with his 
step-daughter was really disturbing, to be sure, but mostly I had just 
grown quite tired of his neurotic shtick and tedious repetition of 
ponderous existential questions. 
Things are quite different in this film, though. "Everyone Says I Love 
You" radiates with an effervescent innocence, with romance and hope. 
Creating a musical appears to have lightened Allen to the point where he 
uses song and dance to undermine his own bleak outlook. In one scene, 
Alan Alda, while seated at his father's funeral, tells the family that he 
never believed in God. "Even if God did exist," Alda's character quips, 
"He did such a terrible job that it's a wonder everyone doesn't file a 
giant class action suit against him." In most Woody Allen films, a line 
like that would be allowed to stand alone, or even worse, lead into a 
philosophical discussion on hopelessness. Not this time, though. Seconds 
after he speaks, the ghost of his father climbs right out of his coffin. 
While Alda and his family stare in astonishment, Grandpa starts singing 
"Enjoy Yourself (It's Later Than You Think)." The ghosts of other funeral 
home corpses join him for in a conga line, dancing and cartwheeling away 
any notion that death is the end.</P>
<P>"Everyone Says I Love You" is filled with moments like that. Even the 
musical form itself is treated as something quite common, as if everyone 
breaks into song and dance from time to time. The conceit is underlined 
by the way the songs are handled. Everyone sings, regardless of whether 
or not they have a trained voice. The combination of lush orchestration 
and ordinary voices has a peculiar charm. The dance numbers also have a 
captivating, haphazard feel. Although wonderfully choreographed, the 
dancers look as if they could stumble at any moment. It all adds up to 
musical numbers that actually feel spontaneous.</P>
<P>Of course, there has to be a story around all those songs, and Allen has 
assembled an impressive cast to tell it. He plays a writer living in 
quasi-exile in Paris, although he remains close friends with his 
painfully liberal ex-wife (Hawn) and her husband (Alda.) Numerous sub-
plots spin involving everyone's kids, including a sweet romance between 
Drew Barrymore and Edward Norton that is interrupted when Barrymore 
becomes smitten with a hardened ex-con (Tim Roth.) Romance returns to 
Allen's life when his daughter D.J. (Natasha Lyonne) matches him up with 
the lovely Von (Julia Roberts). Seems D.J. has been spying on Von's 
counseling sessions and knows her deepest desires and fantasies. She 
feeds the information to Dad, who unethically uses the knowledge to 
become Von's dream date. </P>
<P>On paper, the plot seems quite complicated, but things flow very smoothly 
on the screen. The multiple storylines really don't matter anyway. Magic 
and happy endings are what the film is about. Allen uses gorgeous 
locations, beautiful photography and the musical numbers to create a 
romantic world where hope reigns supreme and love conquers all. Who would 
have thought the King of misery could have created so much happiness?</P>
