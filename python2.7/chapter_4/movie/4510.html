<PRE>                                 HERO (1992)
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>

Ziskin, Alvin Sargent and Peoples. Cinematography, Oliver 
Stapleton. Production design, Dennis Gassner. Editing, Mick

Chase (uncredited), et al. A Columbia release. 112 min. Rated 
PG-13 (language). </P>
<P>Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) is a schlemiel nonentity, a small-time 
Chicago criminal out on bail, awaiting sentencing. Gale (Geena 
Davis) is a hotshot, award-winning TV reporter. She works for 
other opportunistic cynics led by her boss Chevy Chase. He is 
in top form but oddly uncredited. John Bubber (Andy Garcia) is 
a homeless Vietnam vet who lives in his car. These three do 
not know one another. But then a lot of movies depend on 
geometry-defying parallels that meet. </P>
<P>At night, from his stalled junkmobile, Bernie witnesses a 
plane crash . He is the only person who reaches the disaster 
immediately. And he becomes, in spite of himself, the savior 
of all 54 aboard, including Gale whose wallet he steals. 
Bernie then disappears into the night and fog, inconsolable 
about the loss of one of his $100 shoes. He gets a ride with 
John Bubber. </P>
<P>Gale's station launches a ratings-boosting search for the 
"Angel of Flight 104," offering him one million dollars. 
Seizing the opportunity, the candidates multiply. In 
credibility-straining but entertaining ways, the glory goes to 
John, literally a shoe-in thanks to his incontrovertible 
proof. </P>
<P>Bathed, clothed, perfumed, showered with gifts, honors and 
national adulation, John becomes a mega-celebrity. Having 
stolen  Bernie's credit he now steals Gale's heart, by mutual 
attraction. </P>
<P>Channel 4 in no way smells like Chanel 5. Its cynical 
exploitation of John increases exponentially while he grows 
into a wise, caring, role-model hero. Shakespeare wrote it in 
"Twelfth Night" : "... some are born great, some achieve 
greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them." It's 
also like the World War II song about an airman named John who 
got a Japanese Zero plane : "Johnny Zero--is the hero--of the 
day." </P>
<P>John Bubber does good things for people while stating with 
casuistic sincerity that "We're all heroes if you catch us at 
the right moment," a  reassurance that the masses lap up. 
Thinking of media rather than morals, Andy Warhol had said 
years ago that everyone, sooner or later, will have a few 
minutes of celebrity.</P>
<P>John, however, being a decent fellow, suffers pangs of 
conscience, expressed with nice minimalism by Garcia. On the 
other hand, born loser Bernie who has no scruples is out of 
things and not in the loop.  It takes predictable, 
long-delayed but amusing twists for him to realize what's 
going on, for Gale to start suspecting the truth, and for the 
genuine and spurious heroes to be reunited on the top ledge of 
the Drake Hotel. </P>
<P>The movie was written by David Webb Peoples, co-author of 
"Blade Runner" and writer of "Unforgiven." It was directed by 
Stephen Frears, the cool Brit with grit who made "My Beautiful 
Laundrette," "Sammy and Rosie Get Laid," "Prick Up Your Ears," 
"Dangerous Liaisons" and "The Grifters. "</P>
<P>To movie buffs, "Hero" feels like an amalgam of populist 
comedy-dramas by Frank Capra. Garcia's John Bubber is close to 
Gary Cooper's John Doe in "Meet John Doe," including the 
top-of-the building sequence. "Hero" also has mega-echoes of 
William Wellman's screwball classic "Nothing Sacred" in which 
Carole Lombard, as Hazel Flagg, first believing, then feigning 
that she has terminal illness, becomes a national heroine. </P>
<P>Also recalled is Preston Sturges's "Hail the Conquering Hero," 
with patriotic Eddie Bracken rejected by the Army but set up 
by friendly Marines as a war hero. There is even a soupcon of 
"My Man Godfrey" where Depression-era, nouveau-poor tramp 
William Powell, recruited by Carole Lombard in a scavenger 
hunt as "the forgotten man," teaches mindless rich socialites 
the meaning of true class and values. Here, John merely turns 
out to be a Vietnam hero. Even Hoffman's name, Bernie 
LaPlante, recalls Laura La Plante, a silent era leading lady. </P>
<P>I am not bothered by this synthetic approach since the film is 
cunningly updated to the excesses of the media. It holds a 
totally cynical Hollywood view of the people as suckers for 
romanticized heroes and celebrities. </P>
<P>What weakens somewhat this entertaining movie is the lack of 
the sharp edges you find in its predecessors: Capra's variety 
of characters and issues within satirical sentimentalism ; 
Wellman's  (and writer Ben Hecht's) madcap rhythm and 
repartees; Sturges's warmth behind his cynicism. </P>
<P>I am not bothered either by still another movie throwback, as 
Hoffman seems to reprise his Ratso Rizzo from "Midnight 
Cowboy."  He lives in a special twilight world of mental, 
psychological and physical debris. He is a no-thinker who 
mumbles and walks with a shuffle that will never get him to 
Buffalo, except, some day perhaps, to its penitentiary. Deja 
vu, yes, but beautifully done, though sometimes it comes close 
to tedium. </P>
<P>What is really missing though is muscle and zip. Often, the 
plot mistakes agitation for tempo one the one hand, while on 
the other the film can be too slack and complaisant with  
Bernie's scenes. Many of those are self-consciously acted, 
like protracted showcases for Hoffman's abilities. All the 
scenes overdo his character as slobbish, egotistic and even 
feeble-minded, except for some quick-thinking, fast-moving low 
cunning involving illegal acts.  </P>
<P>Those overdrawn and overlong passages are also over-underlined 
by the many closeups that director Frears is so fond of, 
perhaps as a leftover of his old (and impressive) TV days. It 
is as though the filmmakers wanted to get every penny of their 
investment in Hoffman's star presence. They also do this in 
the technically smashing crash-and-rescue sequences. It's like 
"we invested so much in them that we better them out and milk 
them to the last drop."   </P>
<P>The plot keeps going from good to middlin' bits, whether  
between the sketches or within them. Clever parts are followed 
by weak ones and vice versa.  Joan Cusack, as Bernie's 
disgusted ex-wife, is marvelous as usual, but her spite is 
overdone. Her sister Susie Cusack (part of the Evanston, 
Illinois Cusack clan) makes a lovely debut as Bernie's 
court-appointed, rookie lawyer. Tom Arnold plays a likable 
bartender. Christian Clemenson as Gale's cameraman  waxes 
comically lyrical about his lenses and his shots. Davis brings 
brio to her role, but is given a dumb acceptance speech in her 
award scene. Andy Garcia controls his performance with quiet 
soulfulness, but past a certain point, his part spills into 
schlock. </P>
<P>This is when, in search of a solution, the movie switches into 
abrupt, gauche changes in mood and characters, all fake and 
sentimentalized, so much so that the film now mocks its own 
maudliness with things like a heavenly women's chrous intoning 
"Glory, Glory, Hallelujah" as people mortify their souls. This 
is the ultimate in cynicism. </P>
<P>Even so, while the sugar spreads around, the film still 
manages to throw in some hilarious touches, as when, on the 
Drake ledge, Bernie asks the firemen for two coffees. Then, 
for better or worse, we switch to a super-Capra, 
lump-in-the-throat Davis-Hoffman dialogue.  </P>
<P>Like many a movie, "Hero" left me straddling the fence. A 
second, distanced viewing will eventually help tip the scales 
better. Until then, my bottom line is that though "Hero" is 
not a must-see, it is easily a can-see.  </P>
