<P>After viewing "Boiler Room," I came to an interesting conclusion: Most
movies looking to provide viewers with an "in-depth" portrayal of a
particular profession end up making it look like a pretty lousy job. Either
they take the route of most movies about the teaching profession and show
that, however worthwhile, the job is exceedingly difficult ("Stand and
Deliver," anyone?), or they show you all the nasty, ugly stuff lurking under
the surface that you don't want to see. "Boiler Room" goes for the latter. I
can't think of anyone who would want to be a stockbroker after seeing this
one. Trouble is, the characters in "Boiler Room" take a look at a film
equally critical of the same profession -- Oliver Stone's "Wall Street" --
and find exactly what they are looking for. Huh? Good question. This film
attempts to explain the mentality that leads young men to the high-pressure
world of selling stocks. And though "Boiler Room" doesn't quite work as a
complete piece of cinema, some of its insight into this world is still quite
fascinating.</P>
<P>Seth (Giovanni Ribisi) runs a private casino out of his basement. Though he'
s supposed to be in college, he has since dropped out and concentrated
entirely on his new business. Soon, however, Seth's disapproving father (Ron
Rifkin), a judge, discovers his deception and virtually disowns his son.
Seth, desperate to gain his father's respect, takes up a job offer from one
of his customers: A small firm called J.T. Marlin is offering young recruits
instant wealth -- they'll be millionaires within their first three years.
Seth goes to the job "interview," which is more like a recruiting session,
where broker Jim Young (Ben Affleck) delivers forceful speeches designed to
draw the men to the company. After joining the firm as a trainee, Seth finds
 the work hectic and stressful, but still satisfying. He meets his
co-workers, such as Greg (Nicky Katt) and Chris (Vin Diesel), two group
leaders who keep up a friendly stream of insults with each other, Michael
(Tom Everett Scott), the charismatic chairman, and Abby (Nia Long), a
beautiful secretary Seth takes a liking to. He's good at his job and is
finally doing something his father can approve of. But Seth starts noticing
suspicious things about his seemingly gracious employer. J.T. Marlin can
afford to pay its employees exorbitant amounts of cash, strange for such a
small firm. Eventually, he discovers the truth: The firm is a "chop-shop," a
place that sells nonexistent stocks to unwitting customers, and one that is
under investigation by the FBI.</P>
<P>The films which served as Younger's inspiration for "Boiler Room" are quite
evident. His characters quote lines from "Wall Street" and extol the virtues
of "Glengarry Glen Ross," while Younger himself seems to channel David Mamet
when writing his dialogue; his film is full of quintessential Mamet-speak --
curt, profane, and riddled with epithets. Derivative nature aside, most of
these conversations are sharply written, even darkly funny at times. Younger
displays some ironic wit here: These characters are well-to-do white men who
speak like they came from the ghetto. The film utilizes a rap-infested
soundtrack to enforce the notion (and just in case you're wondering, yes,
Younger did start out directing music videos), and many of the scenes in
"Boiler Room" are quite stunning in their effectiveness. The offices at J.T.
Marlin literally are boiling pots of tension, ready to explode at any
moment, and much of the tension is brought in by strong, forceful
performances by two actors: Nicky Katt and Vin Diesel. They aren't the main
characters (though sometimes I wished they were), but the duo bring energy
to the material whenever they arrive on screen. Ben Affleck, playing the
Alec Baldwin part (from "Glengarry"), delivers his monologues quite well.</P>
<P>"Boiler Room" is an interesting film, but the problem is that whatever
interesting points it might have delivered are dulled by the slipshod way
the film has been slapped together. Younger is still inexperienced as a
filmmaker, and his shot selection gets downright monotonous at times:
Practically every conversation is an endless stream of close-ups. But I'm
willing to overlook such faults, as long as the filmmaker has enough
material to keep me interested for the full running time. "Boiler Room" only
has enough to sustain about half a film. The first hour is quite good. We
meet plenty of colorful characters and learn quite a lot about the inner
workings of a firm like J.T. Marlin. But Younger, for all his dedication to
Mamet-style dialogue, forgets that it isn't enough to merely show us what
happens in an office like this, not enough to fill a feature-length film,
anyway. Conversations that seemed insightful in the first half become
tedious in the second. But why? Aren't they essentially the same
conversations? Yes, and it is precisely because they are the same
conversations that they cease to be interesting.  Notice how team leaders
Greg and Chris have the same racially-charged argument every time. Notice
how Ben Affleck delivers what is essentially the same speech no less than
three times. (In "Glengarry," Mamet was wise to have Alec Baldwin show up
once for a stunning and forceful monologue and then resist the temptation to
bring him back for another.) Notice how Seth, the ostensible lead character,
learns almost nothing by the end of the film -- other than that he should've
stuck with his illegal casino business. David Mamet is Younger's
inspiration, but he writes conversations that give us new insight into his
characters each time around; Younger writes conversations that go nowhere by
the time two characters talk to each other a second time. "Boiler Room's"
script is big on introduction, and short on development.</P>
<P>Younger also seems to be afraid of mainstream audiences not "getting" his
film, so he throws in several superfluous subplots that never amount to
much, like the truncated romance between Ribisi and Nia Long. While the film
should be commended for not harping on the interracial nature of the
relationship, it still never gets really interesting. Seth's relationship
with his father sits in neutral for a long while until the film pulls out a
contrived (and unearned) resolution to it. (Ribisi's "breakdown" scene
towards the end isn't the least bit believable.) And what was that about the
FBI sting? Don't even ask. The screenplay has hampered what ought to have
been a character-driven film and saddled it with far too much plot. It also
makes the grave mistake of having the laconic and disinterested Seth as its
lead character, because the film doesn't need a lead character at all. It
would have been better had Younger treated this as an ensemble piece, giving
more screen time to the interesting personalities employed by J.T. Marlin.</P>
<P>Perhaps I'm being too harsh on the film. I didn't hate "Boiler Room." Quite
the opposite, it intrigued me so greatly that I was left wanting more. The
film is good in pieces, particularly a scene where Seth berates a
telemarketer for serving him a lousy sales pitch (don't you wish you could
do that?) and a subplot involving a spineless middle-class family man
(Taylor Nichols) who gets taken for all he's worth by J.T. Marlin. This part
of the film is easily the most effective, portraying and personalizing just
what these "chop-shop" firms do to people. The result is absolutely
disgusting. Younger's film also manages to tap into a late-90's "boom
economy" mentality, one in which young men, having seen computer hackers and
stockbrokers making millions at the drop of a hat, demand their own
substantial slice of the pie. But all these good pieces don't add up to a
coherent whole, and this film ultimately fails, falling apart in a formulaic
and repetitive second half that loses whatever points it had been making.
"Boiler Room" does a lot of nice things; too bad it doesn't manage to do
them for a full two hours.</P>
