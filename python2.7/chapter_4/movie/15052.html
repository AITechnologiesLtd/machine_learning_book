<P>Fox Searchlight is pushing the modest Irish comedy _Waking_Ned_Devine_  as
this year's _The_Full_Monty_, and it more than reminds of that sleeper hit:
(1) it's a shameless, effective crowdpleaser, and (2) it's likely to be as
wildly overrated as that inexplicable Best Picture nominee.
Writer-director Kirk Jones's charming film can be best described as
_Grumpy_Old_Men_ with a dash of _It_Could_Happen_to_You_, with two crafty
codgers (Ian Bannen and David Kelly) leading the population of their tiny
village (a mere 52) in an attempt to claim a lottery jackpot won by a
recently deceased resident.  The film is as cute and enjoyable as it
sounds, and every bit as slight.  Beyond the basic premise, there's a touch
of romance involving a young pig farmer (James Nesbitt) and his
stench-sensitive love (Susan Lynch), a blackly comic zinger of a final
joke, and, unfortunately, not much in the way of memorable characters.</P>
<P>A bit meatier is another crowdpleaser from the same part of the globe,
the sweet British comedy _Little_Voice_.  The title character (Jane
Horrocks), nicknamed "L.V.", is a soft-spoken young woman who spends her
days and nights listening to her late, beloved father's old record
collection, much to the chagrin of her boozy floozy mother Mari (Brenda
Blethyn).  Through listening to the likes of Judy Garland and Shirley
Bassey, the meek L.V. has developed quite a big singing voice of her own,
catching the ear of one of Mari's greasy lovers, Ray Say (Michael Caine).
A wildly unsuccessful talent agent, Ray sees L.V. as his long-awaited
ticket to the big time.</P>
<P>Writer-director Mark Herman's script, based on Jim Cartwright's play
_The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Little_Voice_, goes through predictable, pedestrian
paces, with Mari and Ray attempting to exploit L.V.'s gift without paying
attention to her needs as a person.  (The only person who pays much
attention to her is kind, pigeon-raising telephone worker Billy, played by
Ewan McGregor.)  But what makes the film consistently engaging is its lead
trio of characters.  Caine and especially Blethyn are a hoot, exuding the
right mix of sleaze, sexuality, selfishness, and even sympathy; the power
of Ray's climactic breakdown comes as a bit of a shock.  But the star of
the film is indeed Horrocks, recreating her acclaimed stage role.  She is
quite simply remarkable, equally convincing speaking in a mousy murmur and
belting "Big Spender" with the full-throttle lungs of a true diva.
Horrocks, amazingly enough, not only did her own singing, she did it all
live on the set, with no pre-recorded help.  Quiet or loud, hers is the
voice that clearly rings throughout.  (_Waking_Ned_Devine_ opens November
20; _Little_Voice_ opens December 4)</P>
