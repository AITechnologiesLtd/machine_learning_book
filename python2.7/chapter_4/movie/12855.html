<P>   This is the last Carry on film with its almost intact regular cast and 
it is the swansong of Hattie Jacques and Sid James.
   Dick Turpin (Sid James) and his gang which includes Harriett/Harry 
(Barbara Windsor) and Tom "Doc" Scholl (Peter Butterworth), terrorise the 
countryside by staging highway robberies: "Stand and Deliver!"
   Owing to the increased occurrence of Turpin's robberies, Captain 
Desmond Fancey of the Bow Street Runners (Kenneth Williams) and his 
sidekick Sergeant Jock Strapp (Jack Douglas) visit Turpin's area of 
influence to bring him to justice. They are under the express orders of 
Sir Roger Daley (Bernard Bresslaw). Their intellect does not count for 
much and when they increasingly become suspicious of Reverend Flasher 
aka Dick Turpin (Sid James), whom they confided in earlier, they still 
cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies. 
   However, once they catch Harriett and put her in jail, and Sir Roger 
Daley takes complete charge, it seems that there is no hope for Dick 
Turpin. Then again, Sir Roger has assigned the dimwits Fancey and Jock 
Strapp aswell as the old dithering Constable (Kenneth Connor) to keep an 
eye on their prisoner!
   There is no doubt that this is a 'Sid James' Carry on movie. He excels 
in double roles (as in 'Carry on- Don't lose your head') and his 
performance as Flasher and Turpin is hilarious. Barbara Windsor is also 
funny as Harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang, and 
Hattie Jacques' small but effective role as the rector's housekeeper 
Martha Hoggett is played to perfection.
   Jack Douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying 
on-screen persona and Kenneth Williams is given a rather mundane part. 
Peter Butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as 
Tom, and Bernard Bresslaw's character appears only briefly in the film. 
The only notable performance from the support cast comes from Joan Sims 
as Madame Desiree, who is travelling around the country escorting her 
starlets the 'Birds of Paradise' and sporting a fake French accent. When 
her girls and her are robbed by Turpin, she is determined to catch him 
and helps the Reverend to find the culprit! 
   A Carry on by the numbers, this movie is only notable for the great 
performance by Sid James in his last Carry on movie. The jokes are bluer, 
the script is poorer (it is the last script written by Talbot Rothwell), 
but the music is a marked improvement. Although nearly all the regulars 
appear, they seem to be just going through the motions. None of the high 
spirits of the earlier films are apparent here. Just a selection of crude 
jokes and repititive double-entendres.</P>
<PRE>My rating:- 2 out of 5 stars.</PRE>
