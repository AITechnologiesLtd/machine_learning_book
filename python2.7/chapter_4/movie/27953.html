<PRE>COMPANY MAN
A film review by Max J Messier 
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com

<P>I have to admit something before I write this review.  I am a die-hard
conspiracy nut who loves the outrageous claims of betrayals and
back-stabbing that the CIA and other governmental agencies have been
dealing out like drunken blackjack dealers at Circus Circus for the past
40 years.  The only problem is that people like Oliver Stone, Chris
Carter, and Christopher Hitchens have basically ripped apart all the
really good conspiracy theories already.</P>
<P>What we really need is a satire of those good conspiracies from the
1960s.  With that in mind, Company Man, a brazen new comedy by Douglas
McGrath and Peter Askin, supplies that swift kick in the confidential
files of the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and even the Boy Scouts.  It's a
quick-witted, grammatically correct, and often hilarious satire aimed
dead center at the conspiracy nutcases and their shining theories.</P>
<P>Meet Allen Quimp (Douglas McGrath), a high school grammar
teacher/international spy who knows the difference between 'who' and
'whom' and its correct usage in a sentence.  During a congressional
hearing regarding the CIA's involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion in
the 1960s, Quimp recalls the CIA's attempts in overthrowing Fidel Castro
by himself and a variety of characters working for the CIA.</P>
<P>Quimp's story begins when he lies to his nagging, socialite wife Daisy
(Sigourney Weaver) about a phoney position at the CIA as an
international spy so she'll leave him alone to write his masterpiece,
The Grammar Crisis in the English Speaking World.  Word of Quimp's
secret life quickly spreads via Daisy's gossip, and soon he's famous in
the underground.  Befuddled and bewildered, Quimp accidentally helps a
Russian ballet dancer (Ryan Phillippe) defect to the U.S., whereupon the
CIA really recruits Quimp into their ranks, dumping him into Cuba to
subdue the Communist uprising led by Fidel Castro (Anthony LaPaglia). 
Working with a lunatic bunch of CIA cohorts, Quimp attempts to overthrow
Castro himself and stop the revolution.</P>
<P>I just don't understand how the Bay of Pigs invasion could have been
re-tooled as the basis for a comedy vehicle and be successful.</P>
<P>Company Man is funny.  Damn funny.  The film draws inspiration from the
great Woody Allen comedies of the sixties and seventies - Sleeper,
Bananas, What's Up Tiger Lily -- and watching it, I was reminded of
another wonderfully absurd spy movie, The In-Laws.</P>
<P>McGrath, looking like a cross between Kevin Spacey and Matthew
Broderick, does an amazing job in all departments of co-writing,
co-directing, and acting.  Using actual conspiracy theories of how the
CIA tried to overthrow Castro, McGrath and Peter Askin have written a
deft and clever script.  Combined with an amazing ensemble cast of Woody
Allen, Anthony LaPaglia, Ryan Phillippe, Denis Leary, Sigourney Weaver,
John Turturro, Alan Cumming, and Jeffery Jones, the film burns bright in
its spare 90 minutes.</P>
<P>Company Man is clever, quick, over-the-top, and filled with memorable
comedic moments.  It's only a shame that most American audiences will
probably miss the boat on this one small gem.</P>
