<P>     What do you get if you cross Pauly Shore, Adam Sandler, and PeeWee 
Herman?  The answer is Harland Williams, one of the most annoying 
"comic" actors to arrive on the scene since Jim Carrey.  And, since 
Williams is in almost every scene of Walt Disney's newest travesty, 
ROCKETMAN, it makes the thinly-written film that much harder to take.  
Sad to say, but the enjoyable-yet-anemic GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE remains 
the Mouse's best live action offering of the year, and this cinematic 
scrap doesn't come close.</P>
<P>     Williams plays astronaut Fred Randall, the most inept candidate 
ever to undergo NASA training.  And he isn't targeted for just any 
mission:  he's about to become one quarter of the four-member team 
scheduled to make the first manned flight to Mars.  His fellow space 
travelers include two shuttle veterans, Mission Commander Overbeck 
(William Sadler) and Julie Ford (Jessica Lundy), and a chimpanzee named 
Ulysses (who is actually more appealing and charismatic than any of the 
human stars).  Randall is only on the team because of his intimate 
knowledge of the landing pod guidance system (he designed the software).  
Without him, the mission would be delayed at least two years, and the 
ambitious flight director (Jeffrey DeMunn) isn't willing to wait that 
long.  So, ready or not, Randall becomes the first moron in space.</P>
<P>     ROCKETMAN's attempts at humor are predictably juvenile, consisting 
mainly of the usual PG-rated cartoonish slapstick and mild flatulence.  
One of the "high" points comes when Randall, wandering around on the 
surface of Mars in a space suit, has a sudden gas attack.  His suit 
balloons up until he looks like the Michelin Man, and Overbeck, who's 
using the same oxygen supply, nearly dies from the odor.  If that's your 
brand of humor, you probably won't find ROCKETMAN as unfunny as I did.</P>
<P>     There are a few positive things I can say about this film 
(although, admittedly, it's a stretch).  ROCKETMAN features the most 
unique exclamation found in any movie this year:  "Sweet Alaskan 
Asparagus Tips!"  There's also a surprisingly subtle bit of humor 
involving a BBC reporter who's too polite to be noticed at a press 
conference.  On the acting front, although no one really stands out, 
Jessica Lundy is pleasant enough and William Sadler avoids chewing on 
the scenery.  Beau Bridges does his best not to look embarrassed.  And, 
despite the predictability of his antics, the chimp is pretty good.</P>
<P>     In the end, there's not much to say about ROCKETMAN.  Distilled to 
its basic essence, it's stale, lame, and utterly predictable -- and 
those are its good qualities.  (Note: predictability can be okay if the 
movie is entertaining, which this isn't.)  When it comes to scientific 
accuracy, this film isn't going to challenge CONTACT, or even 
INDEPENDENCE DAY, for that matter.  The special effects are of the K-
Mart variety.  (The surface of Mars looked a lot more impressive in 
TOTAL RECALL.)  Essentially, the movie follows the basic plot-by-numbers 
scripting technique that forms the basis of most Disney-generated 
productions, only this time, instead of getting an appealing actor like 
Sinbad for the lead, they've chosen the irritating Williams.  Younger 
kids may actually like ROCKETMAN, but that's not a big surprise.  Disney 
knows the target audience for this sort of offering:  unsophisticated, 
undiscriminating, willing to laugh at almost anything, and fond of 
chimps.  While that's not a group profile to envy, this picture will 
probably still make a profit.  </P>
