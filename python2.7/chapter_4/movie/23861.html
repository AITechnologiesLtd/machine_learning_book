"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P> It's about time Hollywood made a picture about a flabby, mutton-chopped
bumpkin whose legions of brain-dead fans call him `the King.'  No, I'm
not talking about Elvis, but rather Jimmy King, beloved World
Championship Wrestling title-holder and owner of the longest winning
streak in the history of the sport.  He's also the `People's Champion'
(how'd I miss that election?) and the hero of Ready To Rumble's two
protagonists, who watch in horror as their idol is shafted out of his
title as the film opens.</P>
<P>Gordie Boggs (David Arquette, Scream 3) and Sean Dawkins (Scott Caan,
Black & White) star as septic truck workers in Lusk, Wyoming.  In
between sucking `ass juice' (their term) out of port-a-potties and
residential septic systems, Gordie and Sean eat, sleep and breathe
wrestling, a sport they insist is real.  They each wear WWKD (What Would
King Do?) bracelets and live for the high point of their week -
television's WCW Monday Nitro Live.</P>
<P>The dunderheaded duo drive their crap-wagon to Cheyenne to watch King
(Oliver Platt, Bicentennial Man) battle Diamond Dallas Page.  Little do
they (or King) know that behind the scenes, WCW boss Titus Sinclair (Joe
Pantoliano, Black & White) has arranged for King to be mercilessly
beaten and permanently kicked out of his league.  After DDP thrashes
King, the teary-eyed trailer-trash crash their turd-truck and, believing
that the accident is somehow related to King's defeat, begin a quest to
track down their portly hero to convince him to demand a rematch with
DDP.</P>
<P>Gordie and Sean find King and get the rematch – a triple-steel-cage
match in Vegas.  They also find him a trainer in a former wrestler
played by the oddly cast Martin Landau (EdTV).  Things proceed as
expected right through the end with the big wrestling finale - not so
much of a revenge match between the current and former champs, but also
a more subtle battle between King and Sinclair over who was responsible
for popularizing the sport.</P>
<P>Rumble is lewd and crude from the get-go, with its opening scene
featuring Gordie sticking a finger up his own pooper to con a Slurpee
out of a convenience store employee played by the perpetually annoying
Ahmet Zappa (webRiot).  The film, directed by Brian Robbins (Varsity
Blues) and written by three-time Mighty Ducks scribe/star Steven Brill,
is jam-packed with a bunch of modern rock tracks that were, like, so
totally five minutes ago.  Arquette does a good job of screaming and
acting like a retard, but is it really acting?</P>
<P>I guess I can understand the appeal of what is essentially an hour-long,
action-oriented sitcom, but in my mind wrestling's extravagant costumes,
snug-fitting leotards and carefully applied make-up practically screams
`Stand back, Laverne – I'm coming out of the closet!'  I have a feeling
that wrestling fans probably look down on the sissies that watch figure
skating, even though they too feature the same dopey get-ups.  I'm not
sure which was scarier - the wide-eyed mouth-breathers around me that
whispered `Sting' when the popular wrestler appeared on the screen, or
the fact that Rumble was so bad that I couldn't even enjoy Zappa being
violently thrown through a glass door at the end of the film.</P>
<P>In addition to portraying wrestling as `real,' Rumble also does a
horrible job of casting Platt in the role of a wrestling champion.  He
looks like he struggles to get out of bed in the morning, so how are we
supposed to believe he can beat these gargantuan steroid junkies?  The
film is a colossal waste of time but, if you insist on going, make sure
you stick around for the outtakes during the closing credits.</P>
<P>1:49 - PG-13 for adult language, crude humor, sexual content, brief
nudity and wrestling violence</P>
