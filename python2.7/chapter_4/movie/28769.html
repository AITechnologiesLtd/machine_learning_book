<PRE>CROCODILE DUNDEE IN LOS ANGELES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Like reheated leftovers, CROCODILE DUNDEE IN LOS ANGELES, the third and 
hopefully last in the series, has little spice left.  There are a few 
mildly humorous moments, but you've seen it all before.  Paul Hogan's 
fish-out-of-water story was funny the first time out but already tired 
by its second outing.  In its defense, this third episode is at least 
harmless family fare that just barely earns its PG-rating.  You can take 
your little ones without concern.  "No worries," as Crocodile Dundee 
would say.</P>
<P>Starting and ending in Australia's Walkabout Creek -- population 20 -- 
the movie lets us observe lots of flora and fauna, especially the 
colorful fauna.  But we quickly leave the outback so that our hero, Mick 
'Crocodile' Dundee (Hogan), his long-time live-in girlfriend, Sue 
Charlton (Linda Kozlowski), and their son can head off for the wilds of 
Los Angeles, where some really strange creatures live.  The best of 
these is a guy at a bar (George Hamilton) who recommends a coffee enema 
as a better regimen for the body than health foods.  "It's L.A.," the 
bartender offers in explanation to a dumbstruck Dundee.</P>
<P>Hogan is a likable bloke with dark-tanned, crocodile skin.  The intense 
Australian sun has added a lot of wrinkles since we saw him last.  In 
contrast, blonde, fair-skinned Kozlowski looks like she stays inside, 
away from the ultraviolet rays.  Only an extra 30 pounds or so and some 
natural aging have changed her.  </P>
<P>No Dundee movie would be complete without several knife jokes.  The best 
this time comes when they take the Paramount studio tour.  When their 
tram is "attacked" by a giant anaconda, Dundee sticks his big pocket 
knife right through the beast's large, mechanical head.</P>
<P>The story's minimal plot concerns a money-losing movie studio that keeps 
making lamer and lamer sequels of a film (LETHAL AGENT).  How's that for 
far fetched?</P>
<P>CROCODILE DUNDEE IN LOS ANGELES runs 1:35.  It is rated PG for some 
language and brief violence and would be acceptable for all ages.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave it ** 1/2, saying that he liked it but that 
there weren't any high points or low points.  ("Mediocre" isn't in his 
vocabulary yet.)</P>
