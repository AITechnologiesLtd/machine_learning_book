<PRE>The Buena Vista Social Club (G) ***
Starring Ibrahim Ferrer, Ry Cooder
Directed by Wim Wenders
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Recently, there have been a couple of films that bring us into a world of music
that we have never heard before. Genghis Blues followed the story of a blind
man who's visit to Tuva, for the throat-singing championships was funny and
heartfelt. The Buena Vista Social Club is a touching look into the world of
aging Cuban musicians, and the poor country that they live in.</P>
<P>The Buena Vista Social Club is a large group of Cuban music makers. Each of
them have very special lives that the film documents. The main singer (Ferrer)
lives in a small rundown apartment and is best friend's with the woman he sings
with. He's hesitant when someone asks him to record an album, but he eventually
does it. The piano player had arthritis and hadn't even owned a piano in over
ten years before he joined the club. The guitar player has always wanted to do
a record on Cuban musicians.</P>
<P>The film documents the different, touching lives that these people live, and
focuses mainly on their talent. A great deal of performances of different songs
are included in the film, whose Grammy winning soundtrack is making a comeback
for Cuban music. But another thing the film shows is how nice of a place Cuba
really could be. The desolate streets and hot climates could easily be made
into a huge tourist vacation. I know that this review is very short, but there
isn't much that I can say about the film, because there really aren't any basic
plotlines. If your looking for an interesting little documentary, I suggest you
go see The Buena Vista Social Club, which gets *** stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The film is rated G, but some younger kids won't understand
what's going on. Good Age 10 & Up</P>
