<PRE>                             MIGHTY APHRODITE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     There appears to be no end to the genius of Woody Allen.
Over the years I have seen some great comedies but I do not recall
ever seeing any movie as funny as MIGHTY APHRODITE.  There is no
one in the film world who comes close to Allen  not only in his
incredible sense of humor but in originality.  You have never seen
any movie such as this one. From the opening scene (about which I am
not about to tell you) to the ending clincher it is a beaut.</P>
<P>     Right along with the comedy is a story with an ending O. Henry
would have loved.</P>
<P>     To tell you what role each actor had would reveal too much so
let us just name a few that will not give anything away.  There is
F. Murray Abraham, Olympia Dukakis, David Ogden Stiers, Jack Warden
(as a blind man), and Peter Weller as an art gallery owner who tries
to get Amanda (Helen Bonham Carter, who plays Woody's wife) to leave
Allen. If you remember (and how could you forget?) the lovely Carter
from ROOM WITH A VIEW and HOWARD'S END, you are in for another
surprise.</P>
<P>     The story line is relatively simple.  Amanda decides to have a
baby with her husband, sports writer Allen.  He emphatically puts
his foot down.  Next scene shows them cooing over a one-day-old baby
boy whom they have adopted.  This is followed by a discussion of
choosing a name.</P>
<P>     When the son is about six years old, Woody begins to wonder who
the birth mother was and who the birth father was because he feels
that one day their son will want to know about the parents who are
responsible for his birth.  Visits to the Home where they had
adopted the child leads him on a great search.  He finally finds
Linda (Mira Sorvino) who has changed her name several times for
reasons you will discover when you see the film.  She is the birth
mother.  Her circumstances are not very good so Woody introduces
her to a handsome onion farmer with whom she can live happily ever
after.  That part is played by Michael Rapaport.</P>
<P>     Enough!  For a great evening (or matinee) of laughter, this is
the film to see.  Surely the OSCAR people are furiously taking
notes.</P>
<P>Written, Directed and starring Woody Allen.</P>
