<P>We've seen more than an average number of satirical movies this year,
some of which have been extremely sharp-edged and witty, packed with the
kind of black humor that Cranky likes. Somewhere in the middle is Drop
Dead Gorgeous, uses the mockucumentary style made famous in the
groundbreaking This is Spinal Tap and takes aim at a fictional Teen
Beauty pageant. DDG is set in lovely Mount Rose, Minnesota, a
God-fearing town where the good girls see the Sarah Rose American Teen
Princess&reg;&copy;&#153; Pageant as a coming of age obligation and
potential ticket out of their dead-end town. The bad girls, for your
information -- pierced, drunk and pregnant social misfits all -- hang
out hang in school bathrooms to smoke their cigarettes and wait for
their water to break.</P>
<P>As the COPS-style documentary crew films the festivities, we meet ten
good girls of St. Rose, all of whom have reasons for being in the
pageant and all of whom know that the fix is in favoring Becky Leeman
(Denise Richards) the daughter of the richest family in town. Her mom
Gladys (Kirstie Ally) won the pageant seventeen years earlier and has
groomed Becky to inherit the tradition. Mom is also the organizer of the
preliminary contest, and has selected a panel of malleable judges. It's
pretty much a done deal. Problem is, there are two talented teens who
actually have a chance of winning on merit alone.</P>
<P>Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst) is the trailer trash girl who serves up
lunch in the high school and carries a second job applying makeup to the
corpses in the city morgue. Not only does she have talent with a brush,
the isolation of the dead zone provides a wonderful arena to practice
her tap dancing talent and dream that she can follow the same career
path as her idol, ex-beauty pageant contestant Diane Sawyer. As the
documentary crew filming this Fiftieth Anniversary pageant documents,
the prime contenders in the pageant and the male contender for Amber's
heart bite the dust in quick, accidental succession. Could this be some
kind of bleak conspiracy? Gee, you think?</P>
<P>Of the over-twenties in the cast, Kirstie Alley does a lovely
Fargo-style accent but Ellen Barkin, as Amber's mom, eclipses almost any
white trash femme role Cranky can recall and graphically demonstrates
how a can of beer can be both best friend and/or the bane of trailer
trash existence. Barkin is almost topped by Allison Janney as her
incredibly horny best friend. Yes, there are men in this flick. The
setting being Minnesota, there must be a town moron, and that role is
hysterically filled by MadTV's Will Sasso, who proves there is life
after Corky and the Juice Pigs.</P>
<P>Of the kidlets, Dunst is by far the star of the show. Her character
innocently battles all odds, and even with the blatant attacks against
her home, her potential boyfriend, her mom and her stage gear, she keeps
a fairly stiff upper lip. Just the kind of character you root for. When
the fix comes down, lets just say the ultimate resolution doesn't mark
the end of the movie. No, Amber doesn't do the All American thing and
grab a twenty aught seven and blow away the cheating bitch who stole
what was rightfully hers. The resolution is even bleaker, blacker and
funnier. Unfortunately, bring the tale to its logical conclusion means
it keeps going long after you're ready for it to be over.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Drop Dead Gorgeous,  he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$4.00</PRE>
<P>pay per view range. I can't get enthusiastic enough to reco your
spending the big bucks for a theater ticket. It's territory that has
been mined on teevee before, and is probably where Drop Dead Gorgeous
should be seen even now.</P>
<P> Parodying the guns and religion mentality (well that's how us Godless
city folk look at rural Minnesota -- Mary Tyler Moore lived in the big
sinful city, don'tcha know) Drop Dead Gorgeous delivers an adequate
satire whose writing is a lot sharper than its direction and production
values let on. Fact of the matter is that Spinal Tap did it first, did
it better, and there have been enough similar teevee movie tales of
dismal doings behind the main curtain that there isn't much new in the
way of parody of the event. The script by Lona Williams allows the
characters to slip in lots of sly gags, most of which strike out like a
Wendy Liebman punchline on top of another punchline. Would that there
were more.</P>
