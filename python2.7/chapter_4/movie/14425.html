<PRE>Rush Hour
reviewed by Vince Yim</PRE>
<P>In some respects, Rush Hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched
filmmaking.  The hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone.
The cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble.  All
Chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element.  The duo
must always be completely mismatched.  The hero has to say some
smart-assed comment before (and after) shooting someone.  However, that
doesn't necessarily make for a bad film.</P>
<P>Rush Hour is Jackie Chan's first major Hollywood film since the dismal
The Protector (1985).  Proving once again that Hollywood can learn many
things from foreign film markets (ie: Hong Kong), Jackie Chan is given
much more free reign than before.  Still, some die-hard Jackie Chan fans
may be disappointed, as even Chan himself has voiced displeasure over
the length of the fight scenes (which he views as too short, according
to one interview).</P>
<P>This film takes a familiar theme of east meets west.  Jackie Chan is
Lee, the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a
kidnapping case, while Chris Tucker is Carter, the loudmouthed,
destructive cop that is `promoted' to the FBI to help him.  Or, at
least, so he thinks (also another classic notion in action films: the
FBI must always get in the way of our heroes).</P>
<P>Despite the necessary conventions of action films, Rush Hour is some of
the most fun you'll spend and hour and forty minutes watching.  Jackie
Chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big
screen, continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with
his flashy kicks and punches.  Chris Tucker, familiar from his whiny,
annoying role in The Fifth Element is more palatable, complementing
Jackie Chan's straight-laced character.</P>
<P>However, Jackie Chan still maintains his comic-slapstick edge, as
expected of him and his films.  Perfectly downplaying the
`fish-out-of-water' routine through his character's attempts at mixing
into American culture, he makes up for the down time his character
experiences.  When he is in action, however, you'll be amused and
dazzled.  Still being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up
(in this case, a steering wheel, a serving tray, and a barstool), Jackie
Chan proves to be THE pioneer of slapstick kung fu.</P>
<P>Chris Tucker's character may come across as irritating, yet is also
humorous.  Since he's not a physical actor to the level of Jackie Chan,
he uses his main weapon: his mouth (hence, the tagline, `Fastest hands
in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west').  While dialogue is
not necessarily Shakespeare, it is appropriate for the film and still
very funny.</P>
<P>While not necessarily poignant, attempts at character development and
growth between characters come off surprisingly well.  Lee's `knowledge'
of American pop culture (`That's the Beach Boys!') when contrasted
against Carter's lack of knowledge of Chinese culture makes for an
interesting scene where Lee teaches Carter the kung fu disarming trick,
while Carter teaches Lee hip-hop dance moves.</P>
<P>While Rush Hour is not at the same level as Police Story 3 and 4 (known
in North America as Supercop and Jackie Chan's First Strike,
respectively), it more than makes up for the poorly received films
Operation Condor and Mr. Nice Guy.  With its appropriate mixture of high
kicks and lots of laughs, it makes for a fun film.  As well, it is a
true departure from Jackie Chan films, as it is missing one common
element: a whiny female co-star.</P>
<P>Rating: 8/10
