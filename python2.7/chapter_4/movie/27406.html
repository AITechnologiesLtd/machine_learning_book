 Quills (2000). 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Geoffrey Rush, Michael
Caine, Kate Winslett and Joaquin Phoenix. Written by Doug Wright, based
upon his play. Directed by Philip Kaufman. Rated R.</P>
<P>I  have no objection to movies that try to send a message or make a
pertinent point about the integrity of the artist or freedom of
expression.</P>
<P> What I canít abide, though, are films that do it in such a
heavy-handed, obvious manner that it seems condescending to the
audience.</P>
<PRE> Such a movie is Quills.</PRE>
<P> With a screenplay by Doug Wright, based upon his play, and direction by
Philip Kaufman, Quills is at times riveting, disturbing and provocative.</P>
<P> But it also is obvious. The story revolves around the last days of the
infamous Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush), locked up in the Charenton
Asylum, but still allowed quills and ink to write his shocking and
explicit novels.</P>
<P> Emperor Napoleon, disgusted by de Sadeís writings, orders Dr.
Royer-Collard (Michael Caine), a conservative moralist, to oversee the
asylum and cure de Sade by any means possible.</P>
<P> At the asylum, Abbe Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix) uses more humanitarian
methods to try to reach those mentally defectives incarcerated in his
institution. He encourages painting and theater, plays staged and
written by de Sade, in the hopes of soothing the demons within his
charges.</P>
<P> Where Quills missteps is in the portrayal of Royer-Collard. He is so
obviously one-dimensional  hypocritical, venal, capricious,
small-minded  that the scales are automatically tilted in favor of de
Sade, no matter how abominable you may find his writings.</P>
<P> De Sade is fighting for freedom of expression  no matter the subject,
no matter the cost. Royer-Collard is the symbol for those who want to
stifle that freedom and make everyone conform to what the state
considers the norm.</P>
<P> Who in their right mind could favor Royer-Collard's position?</P>
<P> Wright and Kaufman have so stacked the deck that Caine has no chance of
creating any understanding of his character or his position. Wright and
Kaufman fail to instill one iota of decency or compassion within
Royer-Collard.</P>
<P> And this is grossly unfair and totally undermines their argument.</P>
<P>  Rushís de Sade is a flamboyant rabble-rouser who believes his writings
are art that forces his readers to examine their souls and convictions.</P>
<P> Rush does not portray the marquis as a dirty old man, but rather as a
singular, hedonistic visionary who fervently believes pleasure is no
sin.</P>
<P> Caine does his best with what Wright and Kaufman have given him. His
Royer-Collard is cold and calculating.</P>
<P> Kate Winslett portrays Madeleine, the asylum laundress who is de Sadeís
courier to the outside world. She smuggles the marquisí writings to his
publisher's agent by hiding the papers in her laundry basket.</P>
<P> In exchange the marquis reads his works to her, as well as teaches her
to read and write.</P>
<P> Phoenix instills his cleric with benevolence and mercy. He also
displays his battles with temptation as he fights his attraction toward
Madeleine.</P>
<P> Kaufman stages some rather interesting sequences, including one in
which de Sade, stripped of quill and ink, arranges a relay system in
which his latest work is passed on from inmate to inmate until it
reaches Madeleine, who transcribes it.</P>
<P> Toward the end, Quills falters as it becomes a gross depiction of
torture and humiliation, almost a chapter from a de Sade novel.</P>
<P> Quills is a rather interesting feature. If only Wright and Kaufman had
not been so fervent is trumpeting their message. A little more balance
would have gone a long way toward making Quills a much better cinematic
argument.</P>
