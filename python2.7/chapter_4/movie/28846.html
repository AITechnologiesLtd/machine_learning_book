<PRE>SCARY MOVIE 2
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>It has to be a record.  Even with 7 writers (Alison Fouse, Greg Grabianski, Dave
Polsky, Michael Anthony Snowden, Craig Wayans, Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans),
SCARY MOVIE 2 still couldn't come up with a single good scene.  Another record
might go for the biggest drop in quality from the original movie to the sequel. 
SCARY MOVIE was imaginative and funny, but its sequel is neither.  Long
stretches of boredom are interrupted periodically by whispered groans of
"Yuck!"</P>
<P>Although outrageous physical comedy can be hilarious, as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT
MARY proved, the mere presence of gross-out gags does not guarantee that
something will be funny.</P>
<P>Let me take you on a tour of some of the humor misfires in SCARY MOVIE 2.  In
the restaging of the bedroom barfing scene from THE EXORCIST, they appeared to
have used the same special effects team that created the massive waves in THE
PERFECT STORM, as huge wave after wave of vomit hits everyone in the room. 
Another scene has a priest (James Woods) on the toilet, grunting like he's going
to explode as flies crawl all over his body.  There's also a trash-talking
parrot and a self-described "cripple" who makes one handicapped joke after
another when he isn't falling down the stairs.  </P>
<P>The verbal jokes aren't much better than the physical comedy.  "Kiss my grits,"
is one of the insults that, one guesses, is supposed to be funny.  Never has a
movie franchise fallen so far so fast.</P>
<P>SCARY MOVIE 2 runs long even at a mere 1:20.  It is rated R for strong sexual
and gross humor, graphic language and some drug content and would be acceptable
for older teenagers.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave the movie just one *.  He said that it was
sometimes funny and sometimes disgusting.  The foul-mouthed parrot appeared to
have generated the majority of his laughs.</P>
<P>The film is playing in nationwide release now in the United States.  In the
Silicon Valley, it is showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.</P>
