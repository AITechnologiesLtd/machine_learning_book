<P>   The recent spate of war movies opening in the U.S.
indicates at once a patriotic need to remember America's
ideals and heroism ("Saving Private Ryan," "Return with
Honor,") and the country's laments about fighting it should
never have undertaken ("Regret to Inform," "Three
Seasons").  While Steven Spielberg was robbed of his Oscar
in the last Academy ceremony ("Ryan" was heads and
shoulders superior to "Shakespeare in Love"), we might
forget that some of the great war movies deal not with World
War 2 or Vietnam but go further back to the struggle involving
the U.S. with European powers during the period 1914-1918. 
If in fact we are to understand the rise of Hitler in Germany
and the roots of World War 2, we must return at least to the
First World War, and we must look to that tragic event to see
war's irrationality once again.</P>
<P>   When Jean Renoir made "Grand Illusion" in 1937, he
hoped to show his own and future generations the futility of
war even as he ironically pointed out the generosity with
which supposed enemies treated one another.  World War I,
which ushered out many of the great monarchies and
empires and Europe, was the last occasion that featured
honor among gentlemen whatever their country of birth while
at the same time underscoring the differences that separated
those of distinct social classes.  In fact what makes "Grand
Illusion" a major accomplishment is only partly its dramatic
antiwar motif or a depiction of heroism, but from its
examination of conflicting loyalties: devotion to nation
surrenders to affinity among like classes.</P>
<P>   The story that gives these gentlemen of similar classes but
different nationalities the opportunity for cordial treatment,
begins as two French fliers, Marechal (Jean Gabin) and Capt.
de Boeldieu (Pierre Fresnay) take a reconnaissance mission
over Germany, seeking to distinguish targets.  (Renoir does
not show the actual air battle: this sort of grandstanding
would come later by Hollywood.)  Shot down by Von
Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim), the French prisoners
are invited to lunch for the very person who downed
them before they are carted off to a jail that looks a lot like
the summer camp I attended back in the Jurassic Age.</P>
<P>   The prison that houses the wartime captives is anything but
a Teutonic version of the Hanoi Hilton.  POW's are allowed to
receive food packages from home.  One fortunate fellow,
Rosenthal (Marcel Dalio)--a French Jew--shares his food
generously with his countrymen.  Meanwhile those in
captivity prefer to leave and begin to dig a tunnel. 
Unfortunately the diggers have their venues changed and the
tunnel goes unutilized while Rosenthal, de Boeldieu and
Marechal are sent to Wintersborn maximum security facility.</P>
<P>   Coincidentally, von Rauffenstein heads the prison after his
retirement, giving Renoir the motive to explore his central
theme: since the German and the French officers are equally
upper class, de Boeldieu is treated in a singularly considerate
manner, while the German warden ignores the captured
officers who are of no distinguished caste--who include Lt.
Marechal (Jean Gabin) and the French Jew, Rosental (Marcel
Dalio).</P>
<P>   Despite their more than fair treatment, the prisoners make
escape attempts even after they are transferred to a more
secure jail in another part of Germany.  Ultimately one of the
prisoners makes a heroic sacrifice of himself to allow some
others to flee to safety in Switzerland.</P>
<P>   Orson Wells is said to have remarked that if he had to save
only one film, this would be the one.  The performance, which
sentimentalizes the relationship between the high-ranking
German officer and the French captain who is of the same
social class, is compelling.  Renoir seems to turn Marxism on
its head: here we have an international brotherhood, but not
of workers--rather the camaraderie that crosses national
boundaries applies to the aristocratic class.  In a sense, this
story is two films in one. The first half, which would appeal
more to the men in the audience, has not a single important
female role.  We see only two old German peasant women in
one shot tut-tutting outside the prison walls about the "poor
boys" who have to spend the war incarcerated.  The second
half is more of a compelling chick-flick--a romance between a
lonely German woman, Elsa (Dita Parlo) and the stunningly
handsome Marechal--played strikingly by the great French
actor Jean Gabin, who was thirty-three years old at the time
and who could give Kenneth Branagh a run for the money in
the looks department.  </P>
<P>  The black-and-white film has been lovingly restored after
being sadly on shelves here and there for decades.  It was
banned by the Nazis (propaganda minister Josef Goebbels
considered it cinema enemy number one), and no wonder. 
Not only is the Jewish character given favorable treatment for
his generosity: Renoir subverts the entire basis of fascist
thought by stating that nature knows no boundaries; that
political differences are man-made and an illusion.  </P>
<P>   "Grand Illusion" is a must-see, featuring Renoir's signature
deep-focus photography--in which the great director keeps
the background images as clear as those in front of the
camera.  Women in the audience will swoon over Gabin, men
will dig the fighting spirit of the French prisoners who are
gutsy enough to sing their national anthem in front of their
German jailers when the French had recaptured a significant
fort.  World War One seems, however, almost like a fun
chess game than a battleground that left tens of thousands
dead and foreshadowed the far less gentlemanly second
major encounter.</P>
