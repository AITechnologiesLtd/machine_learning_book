<P>Who the director Ivan Reitman is, I know. When the four-year old was
brought to Canada  from his native Czechoslovakia, his genes must have
carried a Czech love of laughter that later, as producer-director, Reitman
transferred to his comedies and farces. The best-known are "Meatballs,"
"Stripes," "Ghostbusters," "Twins," "Kindergarten Cop," "Dave." Whatever
their artistic merit,  most  of them were box-office-busters.</P>
<P>Who the writer Michael Browning is, I cannot find out. Deciphering the
frustratingly less-than-meager information about him in the pressbook for
"Six Days, Seven Nights" seems to say that he has sold some scripts but
that this may be his first produced effort. Watching  "6D7N" however, does
make one thing clear: Browning has seen a lot of Hollywood pics and built
(some might say cobbled) his scenario from more films than you can shake a
schtick at.</P>
<P>Savvy moviegoers could play a parlor game about sources: From Here to
Eternity, Heaven Knows Mr.Allison, Swept Away, Swiss Family Robinson, The
Admirable Crichton, Father Goose, the Flight of the Phoenix, perhaps Sands
of the Kalahari, Butch Cassidy, the Indiana Jones movies, many more. Plus
the hundreds of romantic comedies where tue love begins as antagonism. Plus
those in which X is engaged to Y but it is Z who finally gets X.</P>
<P>Does all this matter? I can't tell. The film plays it safe by being
mainstream stuff for mainstream audiences. It is a no-brainer that  makes
its public laugh a lot. Exacting viewers may dismiss it, yet won't be
bored. The scenery is beautiful, the casting good, the performers
appealing, the dialogue amusing.</P>
<P>New Yorker Robin (Anne Heche pronounced "Haych") is a hotshot assistant
editor at "Dazzle," one of those glossy femme-mags that print articles such
as "20 ways to reduce your derriere, snag a man, make up for travel in
Tierra del Fuego, put down your boss," while inventing statistics about sex
or marriage.</P>
<P>Though frantically busy, Robin accepts the offer of Frank (David Schwimmer)
her boyfriend for three years, to fly to an island paradise in French
Polynesia for the kind of stay that travel brochures (and the movie's
title) advertise. From Tahiti to their final destination, conditions make
the couple go in a small cargo plane, a vintage DeHavilland Beaver,
four-seater puddle-jumper that's like a rickshaw with a propeller. Its
owner/pilot is Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford), who has good looks, a sense of
humor, and, as it turns out, had quit a profitable business for a simple,
idyllic life. Shades of Gauguin and other, real or fictional European
immigrants to the South Pacific.</P>
<P>Coming along is sexy Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors), Quinn's part-time
girl-friend, part-time hoochie-koochie dancer, part-time whatever (not
clear). In the  pricey hotel  on the secluded island, Quinn gets sloshed to
the point of  trying to pick up Robin whom he doesn't remember. He gets
some action with Angelica. Frank comes up with an engagement ring. But into
each life, a little rain must fall. Frantically calling from New York, her
editor wants Robin fly to Tahiti on a pop in and out  assignment.</P>
<P>Robin bribes Quinn, who's not above upping the ante. They get caught in a
storm, crash-land on an unidentifiable, deserted, gorgeous island played by
the Hawaiian island of Kauai where dozens of exotic movies have been shot.
All along there is some nice banter with some good reactions and repartee
Radio communications are kaput. Aha! Ignoring the fact that this is not New
York, smartypants Robin comes up with her cellular phone. Zero results. (I
wish Harrison Ford had said "Toto, I think we're not in Kansas any more.")</P>
<P>You guess the rest,but not its style, which is rather laid back for a
romantic adventure comedy. The cliché antagonism is played way down. So are
the mutual attraction and the dialogue. Heche and Ford are very good with
comedy and in implying more than is actually spoken out. Both get good
mileage from  facial  and body English, with well-directed timing. Heche,
though no great beauty, is pretty, more cute than cutesy, quietly sexy. (A
poster I've seen doubles her actual cleavage!). The sex element is
discreet, limited to such shots as Ford removing a (symbolic?) snake from
the lady's panties; a brief embrace and roll in the surf (cf.From Here to
Eternity); and such..</P>
<P>The couple-in-progress keep their sense of humor throughout their rough
(including major, Indiana Jones, falls and tumbles), near-fruitless
exploration of the spectacular island. Tempers hardly flare. Heche has a
knack for showing her reactions by using just her eyes -- which is easier
said than done.The budding May-November romance pointedly  jokes about
Harrison Ford's age but dismisses it as a factor.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, back at the ranch (the hotel), Frank ogles Angelica as she
dances in a tourist-trap number. Later, as the search for the new Robinsons
fails, Frank and Angelica, now united in worry, get soused and in bed. The
morning after he feels guilty. She consoles him with "It's like after a
funeral, everybody has sex!" His response, an expression of doubt, and
hers, a quizzical "Don't they?" look, get high marks.</P>
<P>David Schimmer's supporting role is well conceived. The loser-to-be is an
Everyman rather than a boob, like, say, Ralph Bellamy's wealthy Oklahoman
yokel in "His Girl Friday." Neither likable nor offensive, Frank is a
cruise-ship sort of romantic, and is sexually aroused in John Doe fashion.
Miss Obradors, who some years back  was plucked from a supermarket checkout
and into TV and a few rather obscure films, does nicely too, except that
she looks and sounds rather like a Latina, not a French citizen of
Polynesia.</P>
<P>Back to the island again. It is preordained that bummish-at-the ages bon
vivant Harrison Ford is also ingenious, will devise ways to survive and
avoid a major danger. The latter reminds me of the old advice given by a
film composer: " When in doubt, go to the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's
'Messiah'". When in doubt with trapped-on-island stories, bring on the
pirates.</P>
<P>Ms.Heche is not, as I've heard it said, a new Carole Lombard. Her style is
distinctly her own. She proves that, cause celebre or not (her lesbianism),
she can make a wickedly good comedienne. Ford who will very soon be 56,
remains as attractive a leading man as ever (the shots of his balding pate
are an uneven -- now you see it now you don't) and one of the very few
performers today who can do no wrong. An experienced pilot, though probably
not "an aviation ace" as the pressbook hypes it, he actually pilots the
plane in scenes shot from a helicopter.</P>
<P>This may be a Kleenex movie, disposable and forgettable, but paper tissues
too have their place in life. The film is a camouflaged, tongue-in-cheek,
mild parody of many oldies. Its deja vu aspects do not bother me. What does
sadden me as an officer in the Language Police is that Ford pronounces
"nucular" for "nuclear," and that the printed information has the star of
"Patriot Games" saying that (sic) "Quinn is an ex-patriot American."</P>
<P>" Le mauvais gout mene au crime" (Stendhal)</P>
