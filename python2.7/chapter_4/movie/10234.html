   Like Spike Lee's "Clockers," "Illtown" features a cluster of
vicious teens teamed up with adult drug dealers.  But it's not
about drugs. A cop is on the take from the peddlers.  Still it's
not about drugs.  Merchants are assassinated for ripping off
distributors of cocaine and crack and for contaminating the
powders that lead to OD's.  Even then, it's not about drugs.
   According to Nick Gomez, whose previous features of
wayward youth are "New Jersey Drive" and "Laws of Gravity,"
this latest film which was selected for the 1996 New York Film
Festival is about nothing less than guilt, demons, and
redemption, even featuring one character, Isaac Hayes, who
is named George but is really God; another named Dante
who must suffer a daily inferno of his own consciousness; and
a brutal but charming criminal named Gabriel, who is, of
course none other than the archangel himself.  Mr. Gomez
has taken on quite a project for his relatively brief film, which
he made for a sum of less than five million dollars, and which
at the time of its film festival screening is looking for a
distributor.  While the Scorsese-like genre which includes
ruthless young people looks somewhat like his two previous
offerings, he has taken a sharp turn from making fairly
realistic works to moving into the Bunuelesque area of the
surreal.
   His "Laws of Gravity" (1991) is a chronicle of three
momentous days in the lives of a pair of young, blue-collar,
Brooklyn thieves and their girlfriends.  A gritty work.  His "New
Jersey Drive" (1995) deals with two teens from Newark, New
Jersey, who are drawn into the underground carjacking
network and find the weight of local police upon them.  Also
gritty.  But gritty is just an incidental way of describing
"Illtown," which is visually rich in an almost pious selection of
dreams, ghosts, and metaphysical encounters, but is
ultimately an unholy mess.  Presumably influenced by the
Spanish master of the surreal, Luis Bunuel, Mr. Gomez has a
way to go before he can approach that filmmaker's style,
techniques, and depth of social criticism.  
   His central character is Dante (Michael Rapaport), a tense
personality with a well-honed red beard, who is plagued by
guilt over his past participation in the drug trade.  Now a nice
guy who, like some of the younger pushers in the Miami
community, just wants to be a regular family person with his
woman, Suzanne (Lily Taylor), he finds himself overwhelmed
with hallucination and dreams of his dark days in the trade. 
He is alternately in a graffiti-strewn tunnel shooting up--or
facing down a young punk who wasted his best friend in a
shootout that seems out of the parched west rather than the
subtropical American south.  Another figure in his imagination
is a corrupt cop, Lucas (Paul Schulze), who shows up at
convenient times to collect what's his, and ends up getting
exactly what he deserves.  The worst of the bunch is the
ever-smiling, handsomely bland-looking Gabriel (Adam Trese),
who smiles when beaten and looks ecstatic when shot, as
though in being tortured he has attained redemption for once
ordering multiple assassinations and callously shooting down
people who he feels have ripped him off.  
   From time to time the drama--which is replete with
characters conjured up like apparitions--is presided over by
George (Isaac Hayes), who combines the righteousness of a
social worker with the vindictive threats of The Deity, while
Dante's woman, Suzanne (Lily Taylor), works out her own
conflicts with her mother over her brother--a deaf mute who
has run away from Boston and driven eighteen hours to her
place in Miami.
   On the one hand, writer-director Nick Gomez--whose script
is based only very loosely on the novel "The Cocaine Kids"--
insists that everything is metaphysical, that nothing is real. 
On the other, he punctuates his criticism of society for its
blase treatment of teen killings as merely fodder for the
evening news.  Unlike Bunuel he seems to have little use for
the sporadic light touch or moments of wit, so that the
repeated entries of ghostly figures and flashbacks guided by
Dante's unconscious mind become wearisome, even
pointless.  Rated R.  Running Time: 97 minutes.  (C) 1996
