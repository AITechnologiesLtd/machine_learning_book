<PRE>                        THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>***1/2 (out of 4 = very good)
1989, PG, 134 minutes [2 hours, 14 minutes]
[thriller]
starring: Sean Connery (Captain Marko Ramius), Alec Baldwin (Jack Ryan),
Scott Glenn (Captain Bart Mancuso), Sam Neill (Vucily Borodin), written by
Larry Ferguson, Donald Stewart, produced by Mace Neufeld, directed by John
McTiernan, based on the novel by Tom Clancy.</P>
<P>"The Hunt For Red October" is a very technical, almost mathematical story
about the modern cold war, and amazingly it is more exciting and suspenseful
than most movies of the genre because it never sensationalizes. This is one
of the definitive examples of what real thrillers should be, as it depends on
the viewer's intelligence to put the pieces together and doesn't become
confusing despite its complexity.</P>
<P>Sean Connery stars as Captain Marko Ramius, a Russian submarine commander
who is taking out their latest typhoon - The Red October. Immediately the
film surprises us, as we witness Ramius do something tragic that seems
without reason... we can only guess what his motives are and what is going to
happen.</P>
<P>We learn more about Ramius and his ship through a conversation between CIA
analyst Jack Ryan (Baldwin) and CIA executive Admiral Greer (James Earl
Jones). The Red October is an enigma to them, it has a new design that
frightens them because they can't figure it out. It's little things like this
that make the film great. Just the fact that everything seems so realistic,
like this might have  actually happened (or could someday) gave me goosebumps
because it is a "scary" idea. </P>
<P>As Ryan further investigates, he learns the Red October could carry hundreds
of nuclear warheads and cruise through the Atlantic undetected because of its
technology. We already know something strange is happening aboard that ship -
has Ramius gone insane? Does he plan to use the ship for its intended
purpose?</P>
<P>Another great aspect to the film is its dialogue, as certain words are
emphasized to make the situation seem intense, especially during a meeting
with Ryan and the Joint Chiefs. Ryan believes Ramius intends to defect, which
seems crazy, but perhaps the solution is just this simple.</P>
<P>>From here on the film is a complicated story of a delicate situation in
times of unspoken hostility. Ryan heads into the Atlantic trying to convince
people Ramius is trying to defect, but no one believes him. At the same time
aboard the Red October there seems to be a saboteur at work, this only
complicates matters more. Sometimes it's difficult to tell if things are
happening because of the saboteur or if it's just part of Ramius's plan.</P>
<P>The final act concludes with a great underwater battle. Commanders from the
U.S.S. Dallas, along with Ryan, board the Red October and work together to
save themselves from another Russian typhoon. Even during all this fighting
we are never given a straight story, and this is how the film acts as a
whole. We have learned so much about naval tactics it becomes exciting even
through its technicality.</P>
<P>"The Hunt For Red October" is a great education in military diplomacy. I
never knew submarine warfare could be so exciting. </P>
