<PRE>WHERE THE HEART IS
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>If home is where the heart is, then Novalee Nation's home is the rambling,
timber-framed ranch house she builds in Sequoyah, Oklahoma.  Yet Novalee
did not spring from such lavish roots.</P>
<P>Pregnant and penniless in her tender teenage years, Novalee and her
fly-by-night boyfriend Willy Jack Pickens do what many pregnant and
penniless Tennessee teenagers do--head out to California with its promise
of a new life and new opportunities.  Instead, Novalee's dream is shattered
when Willy Jack abandons her at a wayside Wal-Mart, and it's at that
Wal-Mart, during the last of many illegal sleepovers, that Novalee's baby
is born.</P>
<P>Her "Wal-Mart baby" becomes the toast of Sequoyah and, upon the advice of
the store's resident photographer, Novalee gives her daughter a strong
name: Americus.</P>
<P>This is just the beginning for Novalee, and just the beginning of "Where
the Heart Is," one of those "dramadies" that follows many years--here it's
about five--in the life of its protagonist, watching her grow, be
challenged, fail, fall, love and learn, and all that Big Stuff that
confronts us on our journey through the backroads--and the Wal-Mart parking
lots--of life.  And "Where the Heart Is" is indeed a journey full of ups
and down.  So many ups and downs, in fact, that the movie soon settles into
a predictable pattern--good stuff happens, bad stuff happens, good stuff
happens, etc.  A little variety from the screenwriters would have helped.</P>
<P>That screenplay, by the team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel ("Father's
Day," "A League of Their Own," "Splash"), is based on the best-selling
novel by Billie Letts, and is often times guilty of succumbing to forced
humor, predictable outcomes, and unnecessary contrivances (Novalee's
illogical fear of the number five, for example).</P>
<P>But the film is saved time and time again by some deft direction by
newcomer Matt Williams and many exemplary performances, none the least of
which is Natalie Portman as Novalee.</P>
<P>Portman carries the weight of the film on her young shoulders and its a
lot to ask of the 18-year old, who until now has mainly played supporting
roles (in such films as "Beautiful Girls," "Star Wars: Episode I - The
Phantom Menace," and the recent "Anywhere But Here").  "Where the Heart Is"
is her film through and through, and even though the writing is a little
schizophrenic at times, she couldn't ask for a finer supporting cast.
Complementing Portman is a wonderful ensemble of actresses who take
potentially clichéd roles and turn them into characters brimming with life
and vitality.</P>
<P>There's Stockard Channing as Sister Husband who takes Novalee
in--weather-beaten, maternal, alcoholic; Ashley Judd as Novalee's
ever-pregnant friend and confidante, Lexie--Judd grows into her character
well; Joan Cusack as a hard-boiled talent agent who hooks up with Willy
Jack--it's a small part but a good one; and Sally Field as Novalee's
worthless, state-fleeing mother.  All four are excellent, and Field is
probably better in her one scene here than in her last ten movies put
together!  Yes, there are men in this movie, but they simply cannot compete.</P>
<P>Is "Where the Heart Is" a chick flick?  Sure.  But it's also a better than
average film that should appeal to just about anyone with a heart beating
in their breast.</P>
