<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Playwright and actor, Sam Shepard, writes and directs a strangely
intriguing art-house Western about the ill-fated clash between European
and Native American cultures that came with Western expansion. It plays
more like a theatrical ghost story or a Greek tragedy than a Western. It
is set in 1873, in the plains of New Mexico, where a quack, alcoholic,
cowardly, thickly Irish brogue-talking professor, Eamon McCree (Alan
Bates), runs the Kickapoo Traveling Medicine Show, with his despondent
son Reeves (Mulroney) as his assistant.</P>
<P>Eamon raped an Indian woman (Tantoo Cardinal), who was made mute by her
Kiowa tribe and left alone in the wilderness. She gave birth to twin
girls, Awbonnie (Sheila Tousey) and Velada (Jeri Arredondo). Out of a
sense of guilt he marries her and raises the girls as his own, unaware
of the avenging anger Silent Tongue had for him.</P>
<P>When Prescott Roe (Richard Harris), a horse-swapper by trade, offered
Eamon three horses for the now fully grown, beautiful Awbonnie, so that
his unbalanced son, Talbot (River Phoenix), can have a wife to comfort
him, Eamon accepted the offer since he needed the horses at the time.
During childbirth, Awbonnie died along with the child, and Prescott's
son has become completely deranged with her loss, while the ghost of
Awbonnie torments him further and curses him for having his father buy
her, as he converses with her ghost, refusing to leave the sight of the
dead body.</P>
<P>As the film opens, the tormented Prescott, willing to do anything he can
to save his son, returns to see Eamon to purchase his other half-breed
daughter thinking he can restore his son's sanity with her as a
replacement. But Reeves strongly objects and because of that Eamon
changes his mind about the sale, which prompts Prescott to kidnap
Velada.</P>
<P>The barren landscape is frighteningly populated by impressionable
children, con men, dwarves, acrobats, comics, a Greek Chorus singing
about the tragedy while strumming on their bluegrass instruments,
Indians hunting on the plains, angry frontiersmen, a lone man walking
through the desert with all his possessions on his back, and assorted
madmen. When Father and son go to retrieve Velada, the carnival people
pack up their equipment and flee without their leader, prepared to carry
on the show without him.</P>
<P>Silent Tongue's call for vengeance is being carried out by Awbonnie as a
ghost and as a buzzard, as she is also the ghost that trails Prescott to
torment him as he brings Velada to his son.</P>
<P>Harris gives a stately performance of a father who doesn't know what
else he can do for his son. Bates behaves more like a symbol than a real
person, as he represents what the vulgar Europeans were like, who
considered themselves superior to the Indians and in their ignorance
raped the Indians and the land. Bates says things that shows his disdain
for them as heathens, such as: "Indians are born to suffer." In River
Phoenix' penultimate role, he mainly babbles and has no chance to show
his skills as an actor. Tantoo Cardinal has a minor part, even though
the film is theoretically about her, as the film's title states. What
becomes overwhelming is the open and spacious landscape, a perfect
breeding ground for violence and insanity. It's a film that revels in a
dark brooding mystical flavor and of being a revisionist-type of a
Western rather than one of those traditional oaters. Unfortunately, the
film never held together in a cohesive way, and seemed forced and
awkward at times. It should satisfy mostly those who are in need to see
something different, something that is cultish and attuned to Sam
Shephard's penchant for showing dysfunctional families.</P>
