<PRE>A Bridge Too Far
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Dirk Bogarde; Paul Maxwell; Sean Connery; Ryan O'Neal & Gene
Hackman</P>
<P>Just a perusal of the amazing all-star cast of this movie and you can
probably get a pretty good sense of what you are in store for. The cast
includes Sean Connery; Gene Hackman; Robert Redford; James Caan; and Anthony
Hopkins, just to name a few. It is truly an ensemble piece. While Connery
probably ends up with the most screen time, all of the main actors pretty
much share the spotlight in this World War II epic. In fact, the cast is
listed in alphabetic order in the credits. So my definition of the leads is
an educated guess.</P>
<P>A Bridge To Far is based on the true story of an allied operation towards
the end of the Second World War. The Allies decided to capture several of
the bridges crossing the Rhine River in Germany. Once captured, they felt
that the German industrial heartland would be easily overtaken which would
mean a quick end to the war. Unfortunately, almost nothing went as planned
and this operation turned into one of the biggest disasters for the Allies
during the war. As a bit of a historical note -- more Allied soldiers lost
their lives during the botched attempts to take the Rhine bridges than
perished during the D-Day attack at Normandy.</P>
<P>A Bridge To Far is certainly the type of movie that would be considered an
epic. It seems to have a cast of thousands and the battle scenes are grandly
staged and quite realistic. While realism is a big part of this movie, none
of the scenes contain the graphic horror that is now common in today's war
films.</P>
<P>To a man, the cast of this movie is magnificent. A Bridge To Far almost has
an edge of your seat quality to it. You never know what is going to happen
next in this movie. I always seemed to get the distinct impression that
whatever was going to happen, it was bound to be bad for the Allies. The
total disaster that seems to have befallen the Allies at every turn is
staggering. A Bridge To Far has the sort of plot that if you didn't know it
was based on a true story, you would probably think it was too unrealistic.
The movie has such a large cast that it is truly surprising at just how well
developed these characters actually are by the end of the film. I could feel
for all of them, especially since the disastrous results of this operation
would have been considerably worse if it weren't for the skills of those
actually on the battlefield.</P>
<P>I can't say enough about this movie. Acting, writing, directing are all
simply amazing. Combine that with the fact that this is based on actual
events, and you have a very riveting 3 hours. I was sort of surprised that
the movie was as long as it was. It went quicker than most 90-minute
movies -- certainly a testament to the fine writing and acting. Well worth
checking out if you can find it at your local video store.</P>
