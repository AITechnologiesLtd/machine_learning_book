<P>Plot: Growing up in Ireland in the early 1960s, young Francie Brady 
becomes increasingly troubled and unstable after his mother commits 
suicide and he is left to be raised by his alcoholic father. Thrown into 
a Catholic boarding school, he has visions of the Virgin Mary appearing 
to him. He sees as the focus of his trouble, the self-important town 
socialite Mrs Nugent who lures his best friend Joe away and turns him 
against Francie, the alienation of which causes Francie to erupt into 
violence.</P>
<P>With `The Butcher Boy' Neil Jordan, the highly acclaimed director of the 
likes of `The Crying Game', `Mona Lisa' and `Michael Collins', dives 
into tackling Patrick McCabe's celebrated novel about disturbed youth. 
Jordan and McCabe tackle some difficult themes - the film is a 
unsettling portrait of a child in an abusive home who becomes 
increasingly alienated, socially ostracized and eventually locked in an 
asylum, before the film climaxes in a frightening explosion of violence. 
But despite the gravity of its thematic matter, `The Butcher Boy' rather 
contrarily manages to be a remarkably cheerful film. Jordan directs with 
an enormous degree of vibrance and colour and is abetted to a tremendous 
extent by a wonderfully charismatic and aggressive performance from 
Eamonn Owens in the central role.</P>
<P>Indeed it is possibly the most cheerful film ever made about abusive 
childhoods, alienation, sexual abuse, madness and murder. Just consider 
the point-of-view it holds which is entirely sympathetically balanced 
toward the boy, seeking to explain the mechanisms that make the 
climactic murder a logical act. If this had been a film made in America 
one cannot help but think it would have been entirely balanced toward 
the opposite extreme. The conservative social values the character takes 
issue with would be unquestioningly accepted as a norm and there would 
have been a wholly unsympathetic and condemnatory attitude toward the 
boy's actions. The scene, which is presented here with considerable 
glee, wherein Owens defecates on the carpet of the self-important Mrs 
Nugent would have been painted in disgusted tones of the highest moral 
outrage. And the climactic murder would surely be seen in tones of 
stunned shock, asking how such could possibly happen. Indeed an American 
version would surely have emerged as something akin to `The Good Son' or 
the innately evil child seen at the start of `Halloween'. Instead Jordan 
manages the difficult job of conducting the entire film sympathetically 
- few audiences realize just to what a sociopathic extreme Jordan does 
end up taking them by making them laugh along with and enjoy the film. 
The whole film seems fired up by the sheer perversity of going well 
beyond acceptable social norms. With considerably iconoclastic delight 
Jordan casts singer Sinead O'Connor, notorious for ripping up pictures 
of the Pope on tv, as the Virgin Mary - and predictably O'Connor's 
second appearance as the Virgin is accompanied by the query "So what the 
fuck's going on here ?"</P>
<P>It's not Jordan best film but is an immensely enjoyable one 
nevertheless. And it should be celebrated for the simple fact of being 
about the first film in the new renaissance of Irish cinema over the 
last couple of years to not be centered around sectarian violence.</P>
