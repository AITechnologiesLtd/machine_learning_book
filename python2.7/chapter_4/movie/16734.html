<PRE>
 Slums of Beverly Hills (1998) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Alan Arkin,
Natasha Lyonne and Marisa Tomei.</PRE>
<P> Eccentric families are a movie staple dating to the screwball comedies of
the 1930s.</P>
<P> But in these more complex times the family dynamics are more complicated.
Humor can still be mined from the family situation, but it's harder to hit
a mother lode these days.</P>
<P> Slums of Beverly Hills does come close though. Told through the eyes of
15-year-old Vivian Abramowitz (Natasha Lyonne), the story centers on the
family's constant struggle for a better lifestyle, as typified by Vivian's
father, Murray (Alan Arkin), who is constantly moving the family from one
cheap apartment to another, albeit all in the Beverly Hills School
District.</P>
<P> Murray is one of life's losers. He's a former restaurant owner turned car
salesman. He lives mostly off the charity of his older brother, Mickey.</P>
<P> Murray's one goal is to be able to maintain a lifestyle that will allow
his kids to stay in the school district. After all, he reasons about their
constant moves, "furniture is temporary, education is forever."</P>
<P> All this turmoil is not helping Vivian. She's a "late bloomer" who is not
too happy with her new bodily contours. Also upsetting is the fact that
it's the center of family discussion among her father and two brothers.</P>
<P> To the rescue comes Rita (Marisa Tomei), the family's crazy cousin who
recently escaped from a drug rehabilitation center.</P>
<P> To get more money from Mickey, Murray promises to look after Rita and help
get her straightened out.</P>
<P> Rita, in her own unorthodox way, is an affirmative influence for Vivian,
helping her realize the positives about herself as well as helping her
understand her budding sexuality.</P>
<P> Slums of Beverly Hills is an eccentric comedy written and directed by
Tamara Jenkins. The movie marks Jenkins' feature debut, and if Slums is any
indication of her talent, she is a filmmaker who will be making an impact.</P>
<P> Her writing is witty, sharp and crisp. Her directorial style is direct,
ignoring the fancy camera angles and movements used by many young,
first-time directors who use the camera more as a toy than as a part of the
filmmaking process.</P>
<P> Her characters are multitextured and all too human.</P>
<P> Murray, for example, is both comical and a bit tragic. Yet as played by
the wonderful Alan Arkin, he is someone you respect even as you pity his
situation. Near the film's finale, Jenkins stages a wonderful scene in an
airport restaurant in which Murray insists on picking up the check for
breakfast.</P>
<P> He is rebuked and belittled in front of his children by Mickey (a jovial
venal Carl Reiner) for trying to play the big shot since whatever money
Murray has ultimately came from Mickey.</P>
<P> Jenkins elicits strong performances from Lyonne and Tomei. Despite their
age difference the two are more like sisters than cousins. They even have
their own special, secret language.</P>
<P> You root for this family to rise above its problems. Despite a less than
happy outcome, the family at least remains intact, its members having
strengthened their bonds.</P>
<P> Slums of Beverly Hills is an interesting, comedy-drama. It will make you
laugh and at times it may shock you. You may even recognize aspects of your
own family in the Abramowitz clan.</P>
