<P>IN SHORT: The kind of story that requires you to have a decade or so of
dating hell under your belt, to appreciate the niddling nastiness that
plays out on screen.</P>
<P>Before we begin: In Cranky's last day of film school screenwriting
class, oh so many years ago, the teacher (in real life a script reader
for a major studio) warned us about the art of titles. Her main
suggestions: be very sure of your work, especially if you give your
project a title that the critics can use against you.</P>
<P>That would include words like "stinks", which aptly describes the first
15 or so minutes of writer/director Jeff Franklin's debut on the big
screen, after a very successful career on the small. That quarter hour
kickoff is so totally unfunny that one critic walked out of the press
screening. His loss, 'cuz from that point on, slowly but surely, Love
Stinks develops as an insidious and occasionally hilarious black comedy.</P>
<P>It's a small story, told in flashback from the toilet of a Las Vegas
bound jet. Inside said cubicle are best buds and TV sitcom writing
partners Seth Winnick (French Stewart) and Larry Garnett (Bill Bellamy).
Yeah, think all you want about the Mile High Club, I warned you that the
set up to this flick stinks. A year earlier, Larry married the ever
scrumptious Holly (Tyra Banks) and groomsman Seth met bride's maid
Chelsea (Bridgette Wilson). It was lust at first sight for Seth, Chelsea
knew immediately that he was "the one." From that moment on, well once
they dumped their dates, it was a fast track through the self-proclaimed
rules of when to hit the hay and generate tremors readable on the
Richter scale, even though she's a cat person and he's into dogs.</P>
<P>Before Chelsea turns into a angry, nasty, manipulative, controlling
rhymes-with-witch, she gets to parade around in lingerie and garters.
Which is a lovely diversion while French Stewart searches for the
background of the character he's portraying. After a year of waiting,
Chelsea goes ballistic because Seth presents her with diamond earrings
instead of a singular diamond ring. For his part, the battles are more
fodder to plug into his hit sitcom which allows California palimony laws
a full field of action to play on.</P>
<P>What makes Love Stinks different from, say, The War of the Roses is that
all the battles are fought on a very small field. Think of it this way:
if everything that your partner does that annoys you, that you still
ignore, were pushed just a bit further, how would you increase the vice
versa while trying to maintain some kind of civility? Cranky got sucked
into the humor when the flatulence jokes were unleashed -- 'cuz it comes
in the same way it does for all of us who have been coupled up, in bed.
Yes, I'm making a broad assumption here, but the comedy goes much
broader but no further down the toilet. Warren Zevon put it simply in a
song title many years ago, "Lawyers, Guns and Money..." but what is a
very small movie turned from painful to painless in a relatively short
period of time.</P>
<P>On the negative tech side, Franklin's teevee roots show. Love Stinks
looks like a television shoot, all close-ups or medium close-ups shot
well within the crop lines etched onto a film camera's viewfinder. Extra
points are deducted for allowing a sound boom to be seen in his visual
field.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Love Stinks, he would have paid . .</P>
