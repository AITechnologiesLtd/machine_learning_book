<P>   Every schoolkid used to know that Aristophanes'
"Lysistrata" was the theater's first antiwar comedy.  To put an
end to fighting in various Greek city-states, the women of one
community decide to lock their husbands out of their
bedrooms until the testosterone-laden creeps lay down their
arms for good. The technique worked.  Though the history
books give contradictory evidence, most men would rather
make love than war.</P>
<P>   In a similar vein, "Titanic Town," based on an
autobiographical novel by Mary Costello and scripted by Anne
Devlin, weaves a yarn based on actual events during the
1970s when the Troubles were at a peak in Belfast, Northern
Ireland.  In this tale, the women do not as a community try to
put an end to the endless shootings that are taking place in
Andersontown, located in West Belfast.  In fact from the looks
of at least one particular foul-mouthed citizen, locking the
husbands out of the bedrooms might even be considered a
blessing by the menfolk.  Instead, just one woman takes it
upon herself to give peace a chance in her community, and
while she does not ultimately succeed, she shows what a
single, ordinary, middle-aged and struggling person can do to
excite the sentiments of thousands of people including a VIP
politician and his staff.</P>
<P>   Filmed on a council estate in Enfield, a suburb of North
London, and also partly in Belfast, "Titanic Town," features
sporadic shootings that sometimes tragically take the lives of
innocent civilians.  On one side, British troops, originally put
there to protect Catholic families as well as Protestants, are
often shot at as they patrol the neighborhoods and make
frequent arrests of people suspected of being with the Irish
Republican Army.  For their part, their IRA are guilty of not
only shooting down soldiers who are maintaining the
domination of Great Britain throughout the counties of
Northern Ireland but often accidentally shoot blameless
civilians as well.  </P>
<P>   While some neighbors, led by the fiercely vocal and foul-
mouthed Patsy French (Jaz Pollock), are unalterably opposed
to the presence of British troops, others, particularly Bernie
McPhelimy (Julie Walters), more or less say "a plague on
both your houses" and have contempt for both the extremist
wing of the IRA and the soldiers who are targets of their
bullets.  While Bernie's ulcer-ridden husband Aidan (Ciaran
Hinds) tries to reign in his newly political wife, their sixteen-
year-old daughter Annie (Nuala O'Neill) is enjoying her
seventeenth summer: a first love with medical student Dino
(Ciaran McMenamin), who later proves to be other than he
appears.</P>
<P>   Directed by Roger Michell with a light hand to emphasize
the humor of an ordinary apolitical citizen's rise to partisan
fame as the leader of a woman's peace movement, "Titanic
Town" is the sort of film which, if helmed by an Oliver Stone
would be brimming with bursts of fire, explosions, and flying
bodies.  Though Michell positions in his share of firepower to
give the audience the feel of extreme tension in an otherwise
insipid neighborhood, his focus is on the drama of a mundane
woman's 15 minutes of fame as she rallies 25,000 signatures
on a petition which she gets to present to the Secretary of
State for the province, George Whittington (Oliver Ford
Davies).  As Whittington, Davies' patronizing attitude toward
the energetic Bernie and her co-conspirator, Deirdre (Aingeal
Grehan) seems to go unnoticed by the petitioners. </P>
<P>   Academy Award nominee Julie Walters ("Educating Rita")
does a knockout job as a somewhat flustered housewife who
takes on the British army, the I.R.A., and the dissenting
members of her own household.  Performances are strong
across the board.</P>
