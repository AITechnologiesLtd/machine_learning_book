<PRE>                              BEFORE SUNRISE
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>**** (out of 4 = excellent)
R, 1994, 101 minutes [1 hour, 41 minutes]
[romance/drama]
starring: Ethan Hawke (Jesse), Julie Delpy (Celine), written by Richard
Linklater, Kim Krizan, produced by Ann Walker-McBay, directed by Richard
Linklater.</P>
<P>Is it possible to fall in love in one night? Or in one minute? What about
love at first sight? I'm not sure about the latter two, but I do believe the
first notion, mostly because "Before Sunrise" proves it can happen. Finally,
a film has completely captured the essence of falling in love.</P>
<P>Ethan Hawke stars as Jesse, an American GenXer vacationing in Europe, who
meets a cute French girl Celine (Delpy) on a train to Vienna. The two hit it
off, and it is obvious they are attracted to each other. Just from their
glances and their immediate chemistry we can sense that attraction. When
Jesse must deboard for his stop, he manages to talk Celine into coming with
him by using the greatest "pick up line" I have ever heard (it really must be
seen to appreciate).</P>
<P>And so the two wander the streets of Vienna, encounter some locals, and tour
the city. But they do not get into any kind of conflicts, all they do is be
together and talk. At first, the awkwardness is evident, and their first kiss
is definitely uncomfortable, but after awhile they start to loosen up as they
get to know each other better. </P>
<P>Linklater and Krizan's dialogue is fantastic, it is so realistic and
believable it's almost as if they had gone through the motions of these
characters and brought a tape recorder with them. Then wrote the screenplay
based on the tape. </P>
<P>Because the atmosphere is so realistic, vivid, and believable we identify
with the characters and almost become them. I obviously identified with
Jesse, as I have gone through similar situations and could tell what he was
thinking. Hawke and Delpy's chemistry and individual performances are so
outstanding, I felt as if it was me who fell for Celine. I think women will
equally identify with Celine and fell for Jesse. Meeting a person you really
like is one of the greatest joys in the world, and this is an entire film
that plays upon that emotion. </P>
<P>By the end of the night and the next morning the two have discussed many
topics, such as sex, religion, feminism, family, and everything in between.
When we realize they are probably never going to see each other again it's
realistic, but not fair. </P>
<P>"Before Sunrise" is a wonderful story. The dialogue combined with the
chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is just so realistic and believable, you
feel like you're spying on two actual people. </P>
