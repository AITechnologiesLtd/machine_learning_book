<P>For years, director David Fincher has been turning out some of the most
stylish and inventive thrillers to ever hit American screens. In spite of
critical and public backlash, his Alien 3 remains the most technically
interesting of that series, and Se7en stands as the suspense film upon which
all other modern suspense films are gauged. With The Game, he proved himself
more than a one-movie-wonder and emerged as one of the most original
filmmakers working in Hollywood. Which brings us to Fight Club, Fincher's
most unnerving and stylized outing yet.</P>
<P>By now, anyone who follows the entertainment business by even a slight
degree has heard of the controversy surrounding Fincher's latest. With most
publicists focusing on the film's unflinchingly violent and blood-soaked
fight scenes, most viewers would be led to believe (myself included) that
it's nothing more than a handful of starkly realistic bar brawls, and
nothing you couldn't see during one night at your local pub.</P>
<P>Well, take all that you think you know about Fight Club and leave it at the
theater door. With as many twists and turns as Se7en and The Game put
together, this is a wholly exuberant and unique experience, and not at all
what you would expect from the previews. Yes, there are numerous graphic
depictions of bare-knuckled fist fights, but they are never exploitive or
glorifying at all, contrary to what you probably have heard. Whilst the
participants in the fight are crying tears of joy and sharing a supposed
male-bonding experience by letting there killer instincts surface, us
movie-goers in the audience are busy wincing at the notion of such
bloodshed. Unlike most Hollywood action pictures that make violence look
exhilarating, Fight Club, if anything, sets to rest any desire you have to
get in a fight; it ain't pretty.</P>
<P>Edward Norton stars as a conformed, white-collar working man who finds this
out too late. Never given a name (let's call him Jack), he symbolizes the
corporate everyman, so choked by his own mundane existence that he often
gets the primal urge to tear free from his barriers (in some extended quips,
Norton, as narrator, makes some of the most blistering comments on modern
consumer life since the great monologues in Trainspotting). And tears free
he does, once he hooks up with a mysterious figure named Tyler Durden (Brad
Pitt), a soap manufacturer, theater projectionist and part-time waiter. With
his anecdotes of splicing frames of pornography into family films and
masturbating into fresh clam chowder, it becomes clear that Durden is the
exact counterpart to Jack; a laid-back anarchist who has plans of,
eventually, actually doing something about uptight mindless masses and
setting the world free of itself.</P>
<P>After getting into a rumble with Jack (and liking the effects), he devises
Fight Club, an underground organization consisting exclusively of men who
come together a few times a week to, without any loftier purpose, beat each
other to a bloody pulp. What better way to rage against society's standards
and explore yourself, eh? Soon, Fight Club evolves into something much
larger, something that Jack no longer has even a small amount of control
over. What is Tyler really up to? Is there more to the guy than first meets
the eye?</P>
<P>There's so much more to discuss here and many more subplots to get into
(notice I haven't once made mention of Helena Bonham Carter's character?),
but doing so would inevitably detract from your Fight Club experience. That
said, I do think it's pretty safe to say that the film is much more powerful
and profound than the basic plot outline would suggest. In addition to the
natural instincts of man, Fight Club also delves into such topics as
manipulation, cultism, communism, fascism and even the psychosemantics of
the human id and ego, and explores them all equally, all the while
sustaining the excitement and hyper-kinetics of an effective thriller. I
could have done with a less ambiguous ending (which accounts for the
subtraction of a half-star), but as it stands, Fight Club is bound to rank
as one of the year's best.</P>
