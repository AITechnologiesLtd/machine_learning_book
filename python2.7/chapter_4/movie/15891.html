<PRE>                           MIGHTY JOE YOUNG
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A kind-hearted, eighteen-foot-tall
          gorilla from Africa is brought to Los Angeles and
          wreaks the expected havoc.  The film starts much
          more interestingly than the 1949 version, but
          neither has much idea what to do with the plot once
          it moves to the city.  The good special effects add
          a lot.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The original MIGHTY JOE YOUNG was something of a disappointment
for me.  I think that was because from about age six on one of my
favorite films was KING KONG (1933).  (Incidentally, that is one of the
rare opinions I shared with Adolph Hitler.)  MIGHTY JOE YOUNG (1949)
was a reprise of the same talent.  Its effects were created by the same
master, Willis O'Brien, assisted by a new apprentice, a special effects
technician named Ray Harryhausen.  Harryhausen would become the king of
Hollywood special effects from 1951 to 1977.  But the talent was used
to make a sort of junior King Kong for children.  Stop-motion
animation went the way of flat animation and of comic books to be
associated with children's entertainment.  Serious adults (people like
my parents) did not go to see films that featured stop-motion
animation.  As with the SON OF KONG the special effects became
associated with "cute."  In spite of my diffidence toward the original
MIGHTY JOE YOUNG, I was fairly ambivalent to hear that the classic was
being remade.  My reaction is that the remake is a big improvement in
realistic special effects and the story begins much better.  But
neither film has a whole lot of interest to say about what happens when
an eighteen-foot-tall ape is brought to America.</P>
<P>     As a great nostalgic touch the film opens with the RKO Pictures
logo, just as the original did.  It is an updated logo, but basically
the same radio antenna.  Apparently one of the most creative studios is
still around and in the film business sufficiently to get their name on
this remake of their film.  The new plot introduces poachers to the
story.  While their original had no reference at all to poaching, it
would have been virtually impossible to tell the same story today
without explaining why a baby gorilla would be motherless without
mentioning poaching.  The first third of this film, the part about the
discovery of the ape, is done on an almost adult level.  Linda Purl
plays Dr. Ruth Young--obviously patterned on Dian Fossey--who,
accompanied by her young daughter, Jill, studies gorillas in their
natural habitat.  Ruth and a female gorilla she is studying are both
killed by poachers the same night and young Jill adopts Joe, the
quickly growing baby of the killed gorilla.</P>
<P>     Flash forward twelve years and the giant gorilla is now a local
legend.  Nearly as much a legend is the white woman (played by Charlize
Theron who is actually South African), a grown-up Jill who is the
gorilla's friend.  Gregg O'Hara (Bill Paxton) is in Africa collecting
wild animal blood for a Los Angeles nature conservancy (why is never
explained).  He is temporarily detaining wild animals to collect the
blood when out of the bush comes a huge gorilla and sets one of his
captured cats free.  O'Hara wants to add some giant gorilla blood to
his collection and has his unsavory team of trackers go after the ape.
Not surprisingly, he finds the ape he was trying to catch has caught
him instead.  He is saved only at the last minute by the intervention
of a mysterious woman, Jill.  Now Gregg knows he must track down the
mysterious woman and her gorilla.  Eventually Gregg will find Jill and
convince her that for Joe's own safety against poachers he has to be
taken to a nature conservancy.  He suggests the one he is associated
with in Los Angeles.</P>
<P>     The plot here is not tremendously adult, but it is better fleshed
out and more intelligent than the plot in the original film.  Willis
O'Brien might well have approved of the more complex story line.
Whether he would have approved of the effect would be a different
matter.  O'Brien was bitterly disappointed when a project he started to
do a second KING KONG sequel got out of his hands and eventually
mutated into KING KONG VS. GODZILLA with its man-in-a-gorilla-suit
Kong.  Here again at least in some scenes Joe is played by a man in a
suit.  At least it is a Rick Baker-designed suit that is fairly
convincing where it is used. Deep down it is John Alexander in a much
more realistic suit.  We do not have to ask if effects technician Ray
Harryhausen would have approved.  In the party scene late in the film
the older gentleman reminiscing with his wife are really Harryhausen
and Terry Moore, the star of 1949 version.  While I am on the subject
of self-references the film poster at Graumann's Chinese Theater is
from WAGON MASTER directed by John Ford and starring Ben Johnson.  John
Ford was the executive producer of MIGHTY JOE YOUNG (1949) and Ben
Johnson was Terry Moor's co-star.  Ford and Johnson are no longer with
us so I suppose this was a way of giving them some sort of an
appearance.</P>
<P>     Where the new version may fall short a little of the original is
in the introduction of two nefarious villains with thick foreign
accents.  Their plan to steal the giant ape, dissect him, and sell the
pieces does not seem to make financial sense.  Somehow Charlize Theron
seems to wear a little too much makeup for her character.</P>
<P>     It was a little surprising that Has Zimmer who did African-
flavored score for THE LION KING, and has since been specializing in
scores for films with African themes, was not chosen to do another
African score for them.  It might have something to do with his scoring
the animated THE PRINCE OF EGYPT, a film made in direct competition
with Disney.  Whatever the reason James Horner provided the score and
did an okay job, but people will not be rushing out for the soundtrack.
Also I notice that the film walks something of a narrow path trying not
to put in a bad light the animal conservancy which is, after all, not
all that different from Disney's new Animal Kingdom Park.</P>
<P>     In 1949 the original film was unusual for its day.  Its remake
from almost a half century later in some ways improves on the original.
It special effects have been improved upon to the point of perfection.
But the story is unexceptional, perhaps even overly cliched, for a
modern audience.  On balance I give it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a
+1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     Included with the film is a Mouseworks Cartoon.  I did not catch
the title but the subject was "extreme sports" as demonstrated by
Goofy.  It was extremely short for a Disney cartoon, being maybe two or
three minutes long.</P>
