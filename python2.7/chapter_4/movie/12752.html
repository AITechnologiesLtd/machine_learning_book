<PRE>                         THE SPANISH PRISONER
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: David Mamet returns writing and
          directing another of his clever thrillers in the
          vein of HOUSE OF GAMES.  Unfortunately, this one
          has logic failing in several crucial places.  The
          viewer left with several how-did-they-knows and
          but-that-wouldn't-work-becauses.  There are some
          nice superficial surprises, but the script should
          have been tighter.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1
          (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<PRE>          New York Critics: 15 positive, 1 negative, 2 mixed</PRE>
<P>     In David Mamet's THE SPANISH PRISONER, Campbell Scott stars as
mathematical genius Joe Ross who has developed some unspecified
industrial process that will allow whatever company has it to rule some
very lucrative market.  He is presenting his process and his estimate
of its probable value at a special meeting with his company's
executives.  The setting for this meeting is a luxurious Caribbean
island.  As part of his reward he is told to enjoy the resources of the
island for a couple of days at his company's expense.  While there he
strikes up a friendship with Susan Ricci (played by Rebecca Pidgeon), a
company secretary who shared his plane to the island.  Photographing
her he also accidentally photographs Jimmy Dell (played by Steve
Martin), a well-to-do man of mystery.  Dell has the odd talent of being
irritating one moment and ingratiating the next.  Jimmy asks Joe to
deliver a package to his sister on his return and the twisty plot is
off and rolling.</P>
<P>     This is a fun film, one that ties up the viewer in many mysteries
of who is doing what to whom.  Just what is going on is different
depending on who really is Joe's friend and who is only pretending to
be.  This could be a clever story with a little rewriting to the
script, but it is not a script whose plot bears too close scrutiny.
There are holes and there are some very unlikely assumptions on the
part of the plotters in this film.  If one does not absolutely insist
on a plot credibility of story, the film is a reasonably tangled
puzzle.</P>
<P>     Scott and Pidgeon are sufficient in the main roles, but neither
has a lot of screen charisma.  As is often the case, the interesting
characters in a Mamet film are in the peripheral roles.  Steve Martin
is a surprisingly good actor given that he started his career as a
counter-culture stand-up comedian and his film career as the star of
the dim-witted THE JERK.  He has long since proven that he can do much
better than that.  Here he has the suavity of a Cary Grant and
tremendous personal magnetism.  He is magnetic even when he says things
like "Always do business as if the person you're doing business with is
trying to screw you, because he probably is.  And if he's not, you can
be pleasantly surprised."  The rest of the cast is just fine.  It is
particularly good to see Ricky Jay, sleight-of-hand artist and sometime
actor.  He is extremely natural on the screen and is almost the
trademark of a David Mamet film.  Speaking of Mamet trademarks, with
David Mamet directing there is nearly always a few scenes in which the
actors deliver their lines in a total deadpan in an extremely affected
style. I am not sure why Mamet does this, but you can almost always
find a few such scenes.</P>
<P>     While none of the plot twists should be entirely unexpected for
the viewer, this is as much a game as a film to see and to pick apart.
I would give it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale, and a high +1 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
