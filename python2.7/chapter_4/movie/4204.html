<PRE>                             THE DOOM GENERATION
                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1995 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<P>Written, Edited, and Directed by Gregg Araki
Starring James Duval, Rose McGowan, and Jonathon Schaech
U.S.A., 1995</P>
<P>     The opening credit refers to this as "A Heterosexual Movie by
Gregg Araki," and while fans may recognize the cynicism, this certainly
qualifies as the director's most het-friendly movie to date. Set pieces
at convenience stores, cheap motels, and in the wide-open American
spaces will be familiar to straight audiences of all backgrounds.
Cameos by the likes of Perry Farrell, Parker Posey and Heidi Fleiss
will delight hipsters, and the soundtrack is straight out of a
Lollapalooza show. As Amy Blue, Rose McGowan's breasts are showcased in
the great Hollywood tradition, while the ass shots of her male co-stars
are kept to a minimum.  And when Jonathon Schaech, as Xavier Red,
starts licking his own semen off his hand after masturbating, well,
whoops, I guess he's just kind of weird.</P>
<P>     Actually, he's just kind of a classical bad influence on our
teenage heroes, the kind that Jordan White's mother probably warned him
about once upon a time. Jordan (James Duval) and Amy are teenage
lovers, and they've been together for about three months, which makes
it a serious relationship. Amy spends most of the movie hopped up on
crystal meth, so she doesn't eat much, while Jordan is the kind of kid
who favors chili dogs from the corner 7-11. Jordan's meek but sincere,
affectionate but whiny, while Amy is an assertive loudmouth who takes
refuge in a flamboyant vocabulary of four-letter words and much
eye-rolling. The two of them are confused innocents, the kind who make
doe eyes at one another and mutter sweet nothings like "You're the
bright red cherry on top of my sundae," and "I hope we both die
simultaneously." And when Jordan breaks off a love-making session in
Amy's car, confessing that he's afraid of catching AIDS, she wails up
at him plaintively, "But we're both virgins!"</P>
<P>     That will change soon enough, as will their status as
innocents.  The transformation is helped along by Xavier's entrance,
when Amy and Jordan help him escape bloodied but mostly unharmed by a
knife fight.  Jordan's affable as usual, but the newcomer grates on
Amy's nerves so much that she ejects him from the car. It's no good,
though, because Xavier's back in their lives when he saves them from
certain doom at a convenience store.  There's a lot of splattered
blood, and even a decapitation, but the violence here is played
strictly for laughs, and Amy and Jordan escape into a garish night of
primary colors that deliberately recalls Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN
KILLERS.</P>
<P>     At this point, Araki's still playing the young punk filmmaker,
and THE DOOM GENERATION is loud and snotty, with a cruel, icy sense of
humor.  But soon, the film begins to explore the relationship between
Amy and Jordan, and Xavier is developed as a sexual catalyst, and even
a liberating element. In one shot, Jordan's sitting on the floor next
to the bed, and Xavier's head is dangling over his shoulder.  "How long
have you and Princess Leia been a happy little couple?" he asks, and if
Jordan doesn't realize it's a challenge, we do. Xavier watches from the
shadows as Amy and Jordan make love, and a little later, when he's
seduced Amy himself, Jordan will watch through a window and take a long
walk before returning.  And when Amy tries to justify sleeping with
Xavier in the context of her continuing relationship with Jordan,
Jordan just looks at her and says, "Whatever, Amy," without a hint of
sarcasm or bitterness.</P>
<P>     The biggest surprise in THE DOOM GENERATION is how seriously
Araki starts to take these kids, who seem at first to have been set up
as easy targets for his skewering of American youth, red, white, and
blue. There's a lot of sex, but none of it is played for comedy, and
all of it has its place in giving voice to the muted emotional
relationships between the three kids. Anyone who's familiar with
Araki's M.O. will be hip to Xavier's game, but it's very intriguing to
watch as the tough, knowing Xavier works his way ever closer to Jordan,
using Amy as a pretext. And when Xavier finally does make his move, the
picture positively swoons, with quick cuts, gentle lighting, and
flesh-on-flesh dissolves. It's as though Araki (who also edited the
film) spent most of his time in post-production working on just the
last fifteen minutes of the movie.</P>
<P>     But everything in THE DOOM GENERATION is just about right, and
to my eyes, it makes a lot of what has passed for great filmmaking
lately look mighty tired. Araki's kids are disenfranchised, lonely, and
desperate to put on hip airs, but they connect as human beings in a way
that Larry Clark's KIDS never do. Their post-adolescent sexual longings
make Gus Van Sant's TO DIE FOR look like cheap soap opera. And stuff
like REALITY BITES and NATURAL BORN KILLERS is revealed as the
self-conscious sham that it is. Doritos and chili dogs are part of the
landscape, but Araki's mining a far more significant vein of our pop
culture, and one suspects that no matter how thick the satire is laid
on, Araki's got a lot of all three of these kids in him.</P>
<P>     Caveat: You can't expect the guy who made THE LIVING END to be
happy cobbling together a slice-of-life teen comedy about life on the
run or even just how great it is to let go of our sexual inhibitions,
and indeed he doesn't. I'd hate to spoil the ending for anybody, but
I'd be remiss in my duties if I didn't note that it's far from pretty.
I have a lot of respect for what Araki's doing, but I do find myself
wishing he had looked a little harder to find a way out. These kids pay
a heavy price for discovering themselves, and Araki demonstrates that
he's a master manipulator of hearts, minds, and guts when his road
movie centerpunches its audience across the median and into the
oncoming traffic. There are folks who will no doubt love the movie for
being such a wrenching experience, and probably even more who will
never forgive it.</P>
