<P>Two events - the fiftieth anniversary of the film being made and the 
death of Jimmy Stewart during 1997 - prompted the re-release, in a new 
print, of 'It's a Wonderful Life'.</P>
<P>This seasonal fable by Frank Capra, set in a snow-covered American 
small town, has become a staple of Christmas television in the US.  It 
isn't quite as familiar in Britain, but it's a good enough film to 
repay seeing in a cinema.</P>
<P>Jimmy Stewart plays George Bailey, the local hero of the small town of 
Bedford Falls.  He rejects offers of foreign travel and an exotic 
future to run the family business, a philanthropic savings bank, and to 
preserve it from the attentions of Potter, a callous millionaire played 
by Lionel Barrymore in a truly evil manner.  All goes well until one 
Christmas, when Bailey's world starts to collapse around him, and 
divine intervention is called for in the way that only a film can 
portray.</P>
<P>Of course it's dated in places: in particular the assumption that the 
worst fate that could have befallen Donna Reed's character, had she 
never met her husband, would have been to become an unmarried 
librarian, looks very strange in 1997.  The division between the heroes 
in the small-town, caring, bank and the villains looks quaint and 
over-simple today.  And if somebody as virtuous as George Bailey, who 
had saved his brother as a child, and built up the family business 
against the odds, only deserved a second class guardian angel, what 
hope is there for the rest of us?</P>
<P>But some of the film's strength is actually in its sense of period.  
Straight after the second world war, it didn't just satisfy a need for 
a feel-good movie, but it also mirrored a society intent on 
reconstruction, and one where each community's war hero was feted.  
It also resists the temptation to show its hero as perfect.  George 
Bailey doesn't just contemplate suicide (never the easiest topic to 
deal with), but he arrives home irritable when his children are 
preparing for Christmas, he gets into fights, and he even makes life 
difficult for the angel who is trying to help him.  Drama this good is 
always worth watching - even fifty years after it was filmed.</P>
