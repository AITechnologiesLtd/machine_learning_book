<PRE>Lawrence of Arabia
A film review by Robert Marley
Copyright © 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Being the self-proclaimed professional film critic that I am, I am
somewhat embarrassed to admit that I had not seen Lawrence of Arabia
(coming soon to DVD) until only recently.  After all, it's considered by
just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director David Lean,
who also directed films such as Bridge on the River Kwai, and Doctor
Zhivago.  So one day, a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and
I sat down and watched it.  I was initially skeptical that something
made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the
butt-numbing 3 1/2 hours of its duration.  But now I fully understand
why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against --
the winner of seven Academy Awards in 1963 for Best Picture, Director,
Editing, Cinematography, Art Direction, Music, and Sound.  After
watching the film again, I am convinced that it is simply one of the
finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen.</P>
<P>Based on the autobiographical writing of British officer T.E. Lawrence
during World War I, Lawrence of Arabia depicts Lawrence (played by
then-unknown actor Peter O'Toole) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of
military discipline whatsoever.  Bored with his assignment of coloring
maps for the British Army in a dimly lit headquarters building, Lawrence
jumps at the opportunity to be re-assigned as an observer for an Arabian
prince fighting against the Turkish army.  Lawrence quickly sees just
how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up
rallying the various tribes together to fight the Turks and help the
British turn the tide of World War I.</P>
<P>Shot in Panavision's famed Super 70mm format, the film beautifully
illustrates the definition of the word epic.  It is absolutely
breathtaking.  Using stunning cinematography, costuming, and direction,
shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth, I can
only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and
watch this story unfold before my eyes.  Every shot is choreographed as
a portrait -- a living tribute to a great land.  David Lean put his
reputation on the line to get this film completed, and the fact that it
was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology
of the motion picture industry at the time, a far cry from its pathetic,
uncreative existence today.</P>
<P>After watching the film, the first thing that came to my mind was, "I've
got to do a remake of this film!"  But then I thought about trying to
pitch the idea to a modern-day movie executive: "Okay, it's going to be
almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the
Sahara desert.  We are going to need to blow up a full-size train
because computer-generated effects probably wont do it justice.  And we
are not going to use any big stars, and won't have any female actors
since there's no love story."</P>
<P>Yes, my friends, the velvet curtain fell on the golden-era of Hollywood
a long time ago.  But at least we still have the proof to show all
would-be producers and directors out there just how good a film can be.</P>
