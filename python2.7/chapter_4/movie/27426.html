<P>PLOT:
Wow, this is gonna be a tough one. Okay, there are these two boxing
promoters who get caught up in a diamond heist gone awry, in which a young
gambling addict gets kidnapped by these guys who were hired by a Russian
gangster to retrieve the stolen diamond in question. Still with me? Okay,
the promoters also lose their prize fighter, who ends up being replaced by
an unintelligible bare-knuckle gypsy boxer, and suddenly find themselves at
the mercy of a ruthless gangster who's strong-arming them to fix the fight
or end up at the bottom of a river. All of these cool folks eventually run
into one another and rage plenty of more crime, violence and heavy accents
onto our laps. Got all that? Aaaaah, forget it...just see the movie, dammit!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Definitely a major feeling of deja-vu round these parts, but not enough to
spoil yet another solid Guy Ritchie (also known as Mr. Madonna) British
underground gangster funfest. The accents are heavy, the characters are
colorful and the style is all over the place, and perfect for a movie as
such. Yeah, yeah...I know you've probably read this elsewhere, but I can't
review this movie without mentioning LOCK, STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS at
least once. What I wanted to say was that if you liked LOCK, you will more
than likely enjoy this movie. They've got similar overall premises, wild and
crazy characters, funky soundtracks, over-the-top style shots, etc, etc...
If that film wasn't your bag, I highly doubt that you will appreciate this
film either. Vinnie Jones kicks arse!!</P>
<P>The few issues I did have with this film were actually pretty small, but
I'll mention them anyway. The breadth of characters was just a little too
much for my taste. I loved Del Toro's character, Brad Pitt's, Dennis
Farina's and Vinnie Jones', but at some point, there were just too many of
them to juggle. So when the story would switch over to the two boxing
promoters, I wasn't as "into it" as I was with the hipper characters. Same
with the story lines, which took a little too long to get going because of
this very fact. I also missed a few lines here and there due to the accent
thing (no, not Brad Pitt's twang, I understand that he was supposed to be
incoherent!), and the said feeling of deja-vu, but all those smaller issues
aside, I enjoyed the flick and that's the bottom line. I especially loved
the first 15 minutes with the original credit sequence and freeze-frame
title card intros and only wish there was more of Del Toro to spread
around...like in his own movie or something! Anyhoo, chalk it up to yet
another highly stylized caper spitting out rounds of violence, humor and
fun-loving criminals for the MTV masses looking for good times and bad
muthas. The film's tag line of "Stealin' Stones and Breakin' Bones" is a
good one.</P>
<P>Note to Guy Ritchie: You've proven yourself to be quite adept in this genre
of film, but it would be nice to see you take a shot at something completely
different for your next film. Then again, let us remind ourselves that I am
but a simpleminded critic typing out words in the basement of the house in
which my parents still reside. Sigh.</P>
<P>Where's JoBlo coming from?
Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (7.5/10) - Pulp Fiction (7.5/10) -
Reservoir Dogs (9/10) - True Romance (10/10) - The Usual Suspects (7.5/10)</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Pay close attention and you will hear Madonna's "Lucky Star" playing during
a scene in which Vinnie Jones drags a certain someone by his car with his
head tucked in his window.
Incidentally, that "certain someone" is none other than Ewen Bremner, a man
some of you will remember for having played the loveable character of Spud
in TRAINSPOTTING.
The working title of this film was DIAMONDS.</P>
