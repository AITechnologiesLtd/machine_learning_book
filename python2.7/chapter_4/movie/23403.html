<P>Harry (Taylor Nichols), a dedicated family man about to invest in a new
house, gets a call from a feisty stock broker one day. The broker, a new
recruit at local firm J.T. Marlin, is 19-year old college dropout Seth
Davis (Giovanni Ribisi). Seth is urging Harry to invest in a
pharmaceutical drug designed to help premature babies develop, insisting
that it will be approved within 3-months, whereupon the stock will
skyrocket. Harry, who has a relatively well-paying job in the food
business, is wary of investing on Wall Street for obvious reasons. But
Seth is a skilled graduate of Marlin's strict `back-'em-into-a-corner,
never-take-no-for-an-answer' policy of illegitimate money-making. This
environment sets the stage for `Boiler Room', an engrossing tale of
young potential millionaires who spend more time on the telephone than
your 17-year old daughter.</P>
<P>Seth was not always a successful junior stock broker. After pushing
aside the notion of a college degree after only one year, he is
approached by a few past acquaintances (arriving in a luxurious
Ferrari). As of now, Seth is running an illegal gambling convention out
of his own living room - with personalized chips and all. This is an
entrepreneurship that his father (Ron Rifkin), a respected judge, does
not approve of. With dreams of once getting his own Ferrari, Seth is
suckered into the business of stock brokerage. A lesser-known firm
called J.T. Marlin is searching for hot young prospects that could
evolve into junior brokers....and perhaps even further. Scenes in which
Seth is lectured on proper brokerage methods are fascinating. He is
taught to abide by the ABC rule stated in `Glengarry Glen Ross'(‘Always
Be Closing'), and to always be poised and ready to reel in a `whale'
(aka someone who puts complete trust in their broker and is willing to
shell out cash at their disposal). Seth grows to enjoy the job, and
makes some new friends at the office, including Chris (Vin Diesel), a
hot-shot senior broker with a very persuasive manner.</P>
<P>Like a junior `Wall Street', this film offers a full package of sharp,
cunning dialogue and a continually flowing plotline of absorbing
high-stakes business. But it's the human stories that make `Boiler Room'
so compelling. Seth's rough relationship with his father is rigid and
believable, as is the painful downfall of poor Harry, the first-time
client who could have made the worst financial move of his career. Above
all, `Boiler Room' is an explosive catwalk for an incredible group of
hot young stars to strut their acting abilities. Ribisi (the comic
relief in `The Mod Squad') is in top form, although the character of
Seth has its inconsistencies. Nia Long is excellent as a secretary (and
possible romantic interest) at J.T. Marlin, and Ron Rifkin (`L.A.
Confidential') adds a veteran sense of balance to his scenes. It's also
nice to see Jamie Kennedy (the beloved Randy in the `Scream' films) as a
fellow stock broker, even if the character is a drug-addicted weenie.</P>
<P>But the name you'll be hearing most about this week is Vin Diesel. Along
with an impressive, villainous turn in the monster movie `Pitch Black',
Diesel can now chalk up two robust screen performances in one week. Who
is this guy, you ask? Before February 2000, Diesel was hardly making a
whisper in Hollywood - he had appeared as one of the grunts in `Saving
Private Ryan' and supplied the voice of `The Iron Giant' himself.... but
that's it. Now, it appears as if Diesel is strapped in for a trip toward
stardom. The actor certainly has the agile charisma (and the imposing
physique) to do so. Although Diesel is thoroughly galvanizing, the most
electrifying 10 minutes belong to Ben Affleck, who raises the roof as a
motivational speaker who offers advice to a room full of new recruits.</P>
<P>The level of excitement and intensity reached in `Boiler Room' has not
been matched by another film in 2000. Debut director Ben Younger's
script is full of limber dialogue exchanges, and the momentum simply
sweeps you off your feet. There are a few big cons, as well. The rap
soundtrack gets annoying, and the ending is a bit anticlimactic and
dissatisfying, as Younger opts to leave a few questions somewhat
unanswered. But it's still one brisk, funny sequence after another. In
one priceless example, Seth is called at home by an individual trying to
sell a subscription to a local paper. Disgusted with his approach, Seth
lectures the caller on the proper way to propose a sales pitch to the
potential buyer. I'm no good at sales pitches, but I will say this: go
see `Boiler Room'. It just makes good business sense.</P>
