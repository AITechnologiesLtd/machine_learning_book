<PRE>                                 SHORT CUTS
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     SHORT CUTS is a kind of 90s sequel to NASHVILLE.  The location is
L.A., and the theme is sex.  Like Altman's last film, THE PLAYER, this
film is filled with stars, but here they are playing characters.  An
early joke has Alex Trebek appearing in a cameo role.</P>
<P>     I thought all the actors did well, with the exception of Matthew
Modine.  For some reason he seems off his mark here: his lines sound
amateurish and flat.  This is odd, because he's playing a character
he's played before, in GROSS ANATOMY.  (In fact, almost all the actors
are playing characters they've played before, more or less.)</P>
<P>     I found Tim Robbins the most fun to watch.  He plays a
philandering, self-important cop, very broadly and with almost
slapstick wit.  The scene with the megaphone is a classic.</P>
<P>     On the whole the film does not have as much impact as NASHVILLE,
probably because Altman simply does not have as much to say now as he
did then.  It must be nice to know everyone, and to be so respected
that they all want to work with you, but that in itself does not seem
to me to be enough reason to make a film.</P>
<P>     Given the content, the film is also overlong.  Three-hour films
should be reserved for movies with great themes.  It is still an
entertaining film, with a remarkable cast and excellent direction, but
I felt as though I was looking at the imitation of film art.</P>
