<P>     Director Michael Winterbottom (JUDE, WELCOME TO SARAJEVO) goes the
Ken Loach route in this rough-edged, naturalistic dysfunctional family
drama. The story deals witht he members of a London clan coping with
various interpersonal dilemmas. Nadia (Gina McKee) searches for love in 
personal ads, finding men she's more likely to run from than run to; her
sister Debbie (Shirley Henderson) copes with single motherhood and an
irresponsible ex-husband (Ian Hart); sister Molly (Molly Parker) faces
impending motherhood not realizing her husband Eddie (John Simm) is having
a personal crisis. Meanwhile, their parents (Jack Shepard and Kika 
Markham) deal with an ever-more acrimonious marriage of their own.</P>
<P>     Episodic stories like this one almost invariably depend on the
strength of the acting and the consistency of the stories. On the first
count, WONDERLAND is spot on, featuring great ensemble work. The stories,
however, are much more hit and miss. In fact, not one of the sisters'
lives proves particularly gripping compared to the peripheral episodes: 
Debbie's son Jack (Peter Marfleet) wandering alone through an amusement
park;  father Bill enjoying an isolated moment of joy dancing with a
neighbor;  Eddie rehearsing how he'll tell Molly he's quit his job. It's
also frustrating how Michael Nyman's blasting score occasionally drowns
out the low-key intensity of the narrative. Jack Shepard's work as the
sadsack father could be enough to recommend it, but this slice of South
London life is pretty sporadic in its moments of emotional force.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 London times:  6.</PRE>
