<P>THIRTEENTH FLOOR, THE (director: Josef Rusnak; cast: Craig Bierko
(Douglas Hall/Joe Ferguson), Armin Mueller-Stahl (Hannon Fuller),
Gretchen Mol (Jane Fuller),  Vincent D'Onofrio (Whitney/Ashton), Dennis
(Detective Larry McBain), Steve Schub (Zev Bernstein), Jeremy Roberts
(Tom Jones), 1999)</P>
<P>This science-fiction thriller is based on the 1964 novel "Simulacron 3"
by Daniel Galouye. It asks the question, how would you react in finding
out that your world is not real? This is a theme a number of  '90s
sci-fi films have already done. It seems as if the movies are running
out of ideas for this world and need the after-life for more material.</P>
<P>The film opens with a quote from Descartes (1596-1650), "I think,
therefore I am." Supposedly, I am being prepared for a film that will
make me think. Instead, what I got was a sci-fi film that left me
somewhat confused by its being both a murder mystery and a time travel
sci-fi'er. It was very difficult to keep track of what was going on, as
the film moved back and forth between two different time frames. It was
also difficult for me to grok what is meant by the creation of parallel
dimensions and how it is possible for our world to be a copy of another.
What made it even more difficult, was that the story line was built
around the murder case and not around the more interesting ideas
generated by time travel. Yet, it was this virtual reality computerized
world that left me dazzled with its engrossing ideas.</P>
<P>Though the film tried, it simply couldn't create too much depth for its
characters.They remained tied to the sci-fi part of the story. This
meant that they had to act as copies. They performed their task well,
but their characters couldn't expand because of the limitations they
were presented with. They just didn't have too much sparkle to them.
Even the romance between the leads was jejune. This proved to be a fatal
flaw in the film.</P>
<P>The plot centers around a virtual reality device created that allows the
user to "jack-in" and play out various experiences in 1937 Los Angeles.
These creations have feelings and emotions just like people; but they
don't know they're not real.</P>
<P>The film opens, as Hannon Fuller (Armin) leaves a mysterious letter with
an unreliable bartender, Ashton (D'Onofrio), in a virtual reality world
of 1937 Los Angeles. The bartender reads the letter he was supposed to
give only to Douglas Hall (Bierko). Hannon Fuller is next seen in bed
with his wife. But he is soon in a hurry to leave his apartment and go
to this seedy bar. Once there, he leaves an urgent phone message on his
underling's phone machine. When he leaves the bar, he gets fatally
knifed in the street, in front of the bar. This murder takes place in
the real world of modern Los Angeles.</P>
<P>The letter he gave the bartender had a warning in it that they must stop
the program they are running. It is too dangerous. All signs point to
the killer being his colleague and heir to the computer empire, Douglas
Hall. He, unfortunately, can't remember a thing, as he wakes up in his
apartment with a blood-stained shirt in the wastebasket. Thusly, Doug is
forced to "jack-in" and return to 1937 Los Angeles to look for clues so
he can find the real killer. He is helped in this endeavor by his
colleague Whitney (D'Onofrio). Yes. Whitney is Ashton in the parallel
world. In the 1937 world that Doug returns to, he will be identified as
a bank teller named Joe Ferguson.</P>
<P>Detective McBain (Haysbert) is in the real world and it is his job to
get the killer. He shows up at Hannon's computer empire and starts
grilling the logical suspect and number one employee of Hannon, Douglas
Hall. Jane Fuller (Gretche Mol) is the love interest of Doug. She turns
up on the 13th floor of Hannon's computer empire, claiming to be the
daughter of Hannon, who was never mentioned to Doug. In the 1937 world,
she is a gum-chewing check-out clerk in a supermarket.</P>
<P>The 13th Floor, directed by Josef Rusnak from a screenplay he wrote with
Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez can be valued for its re-creation of a 1937 Los
Angeles of fancy bars, booming oil wells, and a magnificent Wilshire
Boulevard setting. All this ostentation taking place in the middle of
our great depression. It was fun to see this opulent depiction of a town
that was to only grow more opulent and depressed in the future. It took
this cyberthriller into noir film territory, as the falsely accused
hero, goes searching for the bartender to help him solve the mystery.The
simulations that brought him back to 1937, are a result of a computer
chip developed by Hannon. In this most original story, it seems Hannon
has made one too many simulations himself and now wants to abort this
project.</P>
<P>All the characters had different roles in their former lives. Hannon
Fuller was a poor junk store owner in 1937, contrasted with his role in
the present world, as the very wealthy corporate magnate. In his
simulations he frequented the glitzy bar, which provided him with girls
for pleasure.</P>
<P>I got mixed messages from this film. I thought it was an interesting
concept, that somehow didn't seem as exciting as it should be on the
first viewing. I will reserve final judgment on it, since I think it
could look better upon seeing it again. As for the flatness of the
characters, that I'm afraid won't change. But I must say, I thought the
actors did a really fine job considering the limitations placed on them
by the script...Also, the filmmakers did a good job with their use of
costume and set designs. I wanted to like this film more than I actually
did, but I couldn't fully enjoy it, for the simple reason that too much
of the film was taken up by the uninteresting murder case.</P>
