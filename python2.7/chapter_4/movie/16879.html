<P>Rating: 80 %
Starring: Tom Hanks   Meg Ryan   Greg Kinnear
Director: Nora Ephron
Based on 1940's 'Shop around the Corner' and a 1949 musical version 'In the
good old Summertime', this film has got all the elements freshened up for
the 1990's. Nora Ephron conjured up a reunion for Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan
since their 1993 sleeper hit 'Sleepless in Seattle'.</P>
<P>Set in the Big Apple, the story tells of two individuals Joe Fox (Hanks) and
Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) who get along famously chatting on the internet. They
literally sneak around their partners e-mailing each other, having a
cyberspace romance. Joe's cyber name is 'NY152' and Kathleen is known as
'Shopgirl'. Joe is a rich man, who is busy opening up a huge bookstore,
Kathleen also has a thriving children book shop that was a family business
for decades. Joe's huge discount store is sure to close Kathleen's store.</P>
<P>Joe is the first to find out that 'Shopgirl' is actually Kathleen, and he
uses this information to manipulate Kathleen. Kathleen is heartbroken that
her family business is going down the tubes, and confesses everything to
'NY152'. He even gives her 'Godfatherly' advice as to fight for her rights
to survive. When Kathleen actually finds out that Joe is behind the big
store opening she despises him at first for what he is taking away from her.
She has no security and everything she knew her whole life is gone. Joe
feels terrible about this and tries to win her trust and confidence, but he
also falls for the person he came to know as 'Shopgirl'.</P>
<P>The movie has a lot of charm and should appeal to even the male audiences.
It is a sweet romantic comedy that has two great leading actors. They know
what to do with the movie and they execute their task with warmth and
confidence. Tom Hanks is really a great actor. He can do both drama and
comedy with such ease. Meg Ryan is perfect in this role. I can understand
now why she received a Golden Globe nomination for her part. She was much
better in this fairy tale, than in 'City of Angels'.The chemistry between
Ryan and Hanks was definitely there. Greg Kinnear we all came to know last
year as the gay artist in 'As good as it gets' has a minor role in this
movie. I think he is actually the only weak point of this movie. They could
have done without his role.</P>
<P>Nora Ephron has taken over from Penny Marshall as the best female director
in Hollywood. She was also responsible for the so-so 'Michael' not to long
ago. She brings forth her ideas with such a clear vision. The emotions and
feel of the movie was spot on.The dialogue is funny and witty. The scene
where Hanks introduce his family to Ryan in the bookstore was really funny.
This is one of the best Valentine's Day movies around, waaayyy better than
'Sleepless in Seattle'. Another thing is, we always get to see the gloomy
dark look of New York, not here though. The place is bright and summery. I
felt like moving there straight away.</P>
<P>If your two favourite pasttimes is reading books and the internet, you will
surely love this movie. After seeing so many violent and disaster movies, it
was a nice change of pace. A movie that has warmth and great actors in it. I
can understand why it is such a huge hit currently in the US. Like Ryan's
character said in the movie, it is great to hear those three words, 'You've
got Mail'. I must agree, it is great getting e-mail!!</P>
