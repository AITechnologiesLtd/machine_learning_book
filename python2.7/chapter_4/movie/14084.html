<PRE>                            THE MASK OF ZORRO
                      A film review by Bradley Null
                       Copyright 1998 Bradley Null</PRE>
<P>     With all the recent rehashing of old movies and T.V. series, (anyone
catch the new TARZAN movie?) you wouldn't be blamed if you didn't expect too
much from this one.  But on the bright side, this one does have Anthony
Hopkins taking on an entirely new ethnicity, which is always interesting.</P>
<P>     Hopkins's performance aside, THE MASK OF ZORRO somehow managed to keep
itself afloat despite steamrolling through almost every action movie cliche
in the books.  In retrospect, ZORRO never loses its freshness precisely
because we are continually presented with new formations of the action movie
spectacle in a genre we haven't seen much of in a while.  Part ROBIN HOOD,
part disaster movie, part young warrior in training movie, another part
ROBIN HOOD, ZORRO seems to take the most classical elements of all of these
action genres and put them together in a way that we know we've seen it all
before, yet still enjoy the ride.</P>
<P>     None of this is to say that THE MASK OF ZORRO is a film masterpiece. 
Despite a strong performance by the hit-and-miss Antonio Banderas and an
enchanting turn by Catherine Zeta-Jones as the princess/noble woman/whatever
with a heart of gold, this film subjugates emotion to action.  So don't
expect to be swashbuckling out of the theater.</P>
