<PRE>REVIEW: Sliding Doors
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</PRE>
<P>Cast: Gwyneth Paltrow, John Lynch, John Hannah, Jeanne Tripplehorn,
Douglas McFerran, Zara Turner

Screenplay: Peter Howitt</P>
<P>Australian theatrical release date: July 30 1998</P>
<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 stars</PRE>
<P>The gimmicky setup of Sliding Doors is exactly that - a gimmick.  The
film followers two different stories, whilst still containing the same
actors, characters and settings (and often, only slightly different
situations).  It stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Gwyneth Paltrow, John Hannah
and John Hannah, John Lynch and John Lynch, and, well, you get the
message.</P>
<P>The film plays on the idea that one split second could change an entire
life. Sure enough, when Helen (Paltrow) just manages to catch a train as
it leaves the station, she returns home to find her boy friend, Gerry
(John Lynch) in bed with another woman.  But of course she also misses
the train, returns home, and is unsuspecting.  Whilst on the train she
meets a charismatic man, James (John Hannah), who always seems to blurt
out the perfect observation whenever given the chance.  When she doesn't
catch the train, she begins to experience relationship problems with
Gerry, who is feeling guilty about cheating on her but continues to do
it anyway.</P>
<P>The cleverest thing about Sliding Doors is that it manages to trick the
viewer into believing that they are watching something better than they
actually are.  One can't help but be intrigued when the film first
splits into two parts, as it rewinds itself for a brief moment, then
changes a small detail to illustrate the seemingly insignificant
separate of plots.  But this intrigue is lost as the two stories
develop, and in no time we not only have one fairly ordinary romance
film, but two.</P>
<P>I'm starting to really enjoy watching Paltrow on the screen, and if it
were not for her elegant, graceful yet sophisticated workin-class-woman
performance, Sliding Doors probably wouldn't have had enough appeal to
last its duration.  She carries the load of the film on her shoulders -
creating a much more demanding role than what we've seen in some of her
other performances.  She showed great skill in Great Expectations and
Se7en, but both probably would have still succeeded without her.  She
gives a remarkable effort in Sliding Doors, but the screenplay limits
her acting stamina, as her character is often reduced to pulp at the
most crucial of all times.</P>
<P>Still, this is ultimately a pleasing flick, which will probably attract
most of its viewers due to its unique method of conveying character and
story.  Sadly, the different scenarios fail to give new dimensions to
the characters, as they appear to have almost identical personalities
even after experiencing "life changing" events.  Many believe that hard
times build character in a person, but the only characters that are ever
built remain the same from start to finish.</P>
<P>As the film draws to a close, it first appears like a dramatic change in
pace has occurred.  Yet a messy and faintly realistic scenario is
avoided, and not surprisingly, it ends up winking at the notion of
destiny rather than fate.</P>
<P>Not a very satisfying piece, but more often than not Sliding Doors is
enjoyable as a romantic comedy with a twist. Would my life have been
drastically changed had I not chosen to see the film?  Probably not, but
I'm still glad I saw it - and for what its worth, the gimmick worked
well enough for me to stop and consider the consequences before I board
the next train.</P>
