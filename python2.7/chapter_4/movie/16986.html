<P>The biggest surprise in the form of a Best Picture Oscar in the last
twenty years definitely came in 1981 when 'Chariots of Fire' upset
'Atlantic City', 'On Golden Pond', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Reds'
to capture the Academy's highest honour.  It had been an interesting and
evenly balanced evening up to the announcement of its victory.  A Best
Picture winner is generally determined by a film's direction and screen
writing.  'Reds', 'On Golden Pond', and 'Chariots of Fire' all won three
major awards so the evening's momentum had been building to an exciting
finish.  'Reds' had captured Best Director (Warren Beatty), Best
Supporting Actress (Maureen Stapleton) and Best Cinematography (Vittorio
Storaro).  'On Golden Pond had won Best Actor (Henry Fonda), Best
Actress (Katharine Hepburn) and Best Screenplay Adaptation (Ernest
Thompson).  'Chariots of Fire' grabbed Best Original Music Score, its
greatest asset (Vangelis), Best Costume Design and Best Original
Screenplay (Colin Welland).  When actress Loretta Young opened the
envelope, even she was very surprised and the audience went into a
surprised frenzy itself when 'Chariots of Fire' was indeed named Best
Picture.  Producer David Putnam was very gracious in his acceptance
speech.  He invited director Hugh Hudson on stage to stand with him in
giving the Academy many thanks for acknowledging the film.</P>
<P>'Chariots of Fire' is a film that has been forgotten in many ways and
that's a shame because of the sheer nature of it's culturally nutritious
message in the form of demonstrating the triumph of the human spirit.
Upon seeing it for the first time, one may dismiss it as lacking in
character development, with a documentary style of direction and British
accents that may be too thick for many to understand.   My mother had a
hard time understanding many of the dialogue sequences but my father
actually did shed a few tears in the film's exposure of two athletes,
one from England, and one from Scotland, who capture gold medals at the
1924 Paris Olympics.  The film is an acquired taste for many and
actually improves with each viewing.</P>
<P>The movie tells the story of Englishman Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and
Scotsman Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson, who died in 1990 from AIDS).
Abrahams is a freshman at Cambridge University and Eric Liddell is a
devoted citizen of Scotland who believes deeply in his church and the
teachings of God.  He later became a missionary in World War II.  He
died in occupied China at the end of the war and his fellow countrymen
and women mourned such a great loss.  The film shows their lives before
the Olympic games, how they conduct their lives, their romances, their
passions, their training and their frailties.  Of particular note is the
performance of Ian Holm as Sam Mussabini, Harold Abrahams' trainer.  He
would receive the film's only acting nomination and received it in the
Best Supporting Actor category.</P>
<P>What works best of all in 'Chariots of Fire' is the music score by
Vangelis.  There are many scenes of competitive track and field, the
category that both men enter the Olympics under, and the music set to
some of the scenes is worth the price of admission alone.  Director Hugh
Hudson finds tremendous emotion in putting very fitting music to many
scenes and slowing the scenes right down and since I am a huge fan of
slow motion if it's used properly, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of
this film since the slow motion scenes stand out perhaps better than
anywhere else I've ever seen them used.  Clint Eastwood never uses slow
motion and Brian De Palma uses it too much.</P>
<P>It's a shame that Hugh Hudson's career as a big time movie director
never really came to fruition after 'Chariots of Fire'.  In 1984, he
directed 'Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes' with little
success and his career was pretty much decided upon with 1985's awful
'Revolution' that caused Al Pacino to go into a four year hiatus.  At
least Hudson had one great film in him and I hope he finds a repeating
triumph later in his career as great as 'Chariots of Fire' and although
he didn't win the Best Director Oscar, 'Chariots of Fire' will live
forever in immortality with Oscar gold as its defence of greatness.</P>
