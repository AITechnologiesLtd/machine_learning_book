<PRE>                            DEATH AND THE MAIDEN
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley, Stuart Wilson.
Screenplay:  Rafael Yglesias and Ariel Dorfman.
Director:  Roman Polanski.</P>
<P>     One of 1994's most unintentionally hilarious films was the
adaptation of Isabel Allende's THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS, a bloated
epic in which Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Winona
Ryder were supposed to be playing Latin Americans.  It baffled me
that such casting could take place in an age where an Anglo playing
any other race would incite riots, and the casting of SPIRITS was
ultimately much of its undoing.  Roman Polanski has made the same
choice with DEATH AND THE MAIDEN, and again it was a very bad one.
While as a concept DEATH AND THE MAIDEN is strong and intriguing
enough to maintain interest, it is sabotaged by actors who often
appear not to have the faintest idea what to do with the material.</P>
<P>     Sigourney Weaver stars as Paulina Escobar, a woman still
suffering profound psychological side effects after being tortured
as a political prisoner fifteen years earlier in an unnamed South
American country.  The fascist government is recently fallen as the
film opens, and Paulina's husband Gerardo (Stuart Wilson) is
preparing to investigate the human rights violations of the old
regime.  One stormy evening, Gerardo's car gets a flat near their
seaside home, and he is given a ride home by Dr. Roberto Miranda
(Ben Kingsley).  When she hear's Miranda's voice, Paulina becomes
convinced that he is the man who repeatedly raped her during the
torture sessions, and she takes him hostage.  Although Miranda
protests that he is not the man, and Gerardo believes Paulina is
crazy, Paulina insists that Miranda make a full and sincere
confession of his crimes, or she will kill him.</P>
<P>     The psychological underpinnings of DEATH AND THE MAIDEN are a
complex set of relationships and interactions which make for an
extremely promising story.  At its heart is Paulina's conviction in
Miranda's guilt, a conviction which we should always doubt because
of her paranoia and unreliability.  Unfortunately, as it plays out,
the performances and direction make our choice far too easy for us.
Sigourney Weaver is part of the problem, playing Paulina not just
over the top (which is probably where the role should be) but so far
over the top that she falls off the top.  Weaver as a personality
simply seems too strong to be so close to complete breakdown, so she
makes up for it by contorting her face and snarling.  But a more
serious problem is the performance of Ben Kingsley, who is
approaching a land speed record for most different races and
nationalities played in a career.  He plays Miranda as such a little
weasel that if he's not guilty of this particular crime, we figure
he must be guilty of _something_.  The part requires more ambiguity,
and the very talented Kingsley just doesn't deliver in this case.</P>
<P>     Perhaps even more disappointing is the relationship between
Paulina and Gerardo, which is remarkably intricate.  Paulina's
torture was the result of refusing to give Gerardo's name as the
publisher of an opposition newspaper during the dictatorship, but
she is repaid by betrayals both real (an affair Gerardo had while
she was in prison) and perceived (his acceptance of the position
with what Paulina believes is a shadow court to slap torturers on
the wrist).  Her feelings for Gerardo range from hatred that she
sacrificed herself for him to a love more necessary for self-
preservation than real; Gerardo, meanwhile, never feels quite worthy
of what she did for him.  All this is in the text, but somehow
director Roman Polanski doesn't let it out.  Paulina never seems to
love Gerardo, while Gerardo is mostly befuddled.  The moments when
they do reveal themselves, all in very stagy speeches, ring hollow
because the same truths should have been evident in the
performances.</P>
<P>     Once upon a time, Roman Polanski was a master at building
suspense (CHINATOWN, ROSEMARY'S BABY, REPULSION), but he rarely gets
the tone of DEATH AND THE MAIDEN right.  One scene shows what might
have been, late in the film when Kingsley makes a confession.
Polanski holds a very long take on Kingsley, refusing to cut to
Weaver's reaction, and at that moment you genuinely wonder whether
this is a guilty man spilling his guts or an innocent man giving the
performance of a lifetime to save his skin.  But moments later,
Polanski cops out with a too-obvious resolution.  The performances
in DEATH AND THE MAIDEN should have created a mystery.  Instead, the
mystery is why they couldn't make the material work.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 political prisoners:  5.</PRE>
