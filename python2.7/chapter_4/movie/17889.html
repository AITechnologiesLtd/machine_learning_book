<PRE>S.L.C. PUNK!
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>It's hard being a dedicated anarchist and punk rocker in very religious
Salt Lake City.  Even if one abides by one's own rigid set of rules
about creating a society without any, the chaos of a life dedicated to
creating chaos can be challenging.</P>
<P>Set in 1985, S.L.C. PUNK! is a parody of life on the punk side.  Loosely
based on the teenage experiences of its writer and director, James
Merendino, the film is a talkfest.  Most vocal, with his long and
increasingly tiresome and repetitious monologues to the audience, is the
blue-haired Stevo.  Matthew Lillard, an annoying actor with a propensity
to overact, plays Stevo.  Lillard, last seen in the disastrous WING
COMMANDER, is admittedly a little better this time.</P>
<P>The other actors in S.L.C. PUNK! are likeable, even if their lines are
only sporadically funny.  With a black Mohawk hairstyle, Michael A.
Goorjian plays Heroin Bob, who possesses a strong needle phobia and a
vociferous anti-drug attitude.  A nerdy Jason Segel plays Mike, the
punkest one of them all, even without strange hair.  Til Schweiger is
Mark, the capitalistic punk, whose home looks like an electronics store,
thanks to the lucrative settlement from his parent's plane crash.
MYSTIC PIZZA's Annabeth Gish plays a head shop owner whose hair color
changes more often the weather.</P>
<P>In a typical teenage plot, the school contains several stereotyped
groups, including, but not limited to, the mods, the new wavers, the
Nazi skinheads, the poseurs and the punk rockers.  These various groups
fight comical turf and ideological battles.  The mods, for example, are
preppie types that wear ties, drive Vespa motorbikes and buy their drugs
from the punks.</P>
<P>The film's big joke is that, underneath, rebel Stevo isn't a rebel after
all.  He goes off to college and earns top grades, while his father
(Christopher McDonald) expects him to go Harvard Law just as he did.
Stevo, who majors, tellingly, in prelaw, puts down his old man as a big
sell out.  His dad, who claims to have been a radical in his youth, says
that he didn't sell out, he bought in.</P>
<P>With an old hippie style van that has "antidisestablishmentarianism" on
its side and profanities inscribed on its tires, the film just isn't as
funny as it sounds.  At least the picture never makes the classic
mistake of taking itself seriously.  It's an audacious parody from start
to finish even if it suffers from a paucity of good laughs.</P>
<P>S.L.C. PUNK! runs 1:37.  It is rated R for drug use, profanity, violence
and sex and would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
<P>The film is showing as part of this year's San Francisco International
Film Festival (www.sfiff.org), which runs from April 22 to May 9.  In
the San Jose area it will open on Friday, April 30 at one of the Camera
Cinemas.</P>
