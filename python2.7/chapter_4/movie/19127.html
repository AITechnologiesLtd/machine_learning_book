<P>        Adam Sandler isn't known for appearing in deep, thought-provoking
films, but he's still a really funny guy.  Most of his movies are
successful not because of the film making behind them, but because they
let Sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him
out.  Big Daddy is the first film in which the story seems more
important than Sandler's comic performance, and it's a miserable
failure.  Sandler plays a thirty-something loser who gets attached to an
orphaned young boy (played by Cole and Dylan Sprouse).  As one might
expect from the synopsis, director Dennis Dugan resorts to the usual bag
of manipulative and sentimental sequences, including a repulsive 
courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say
"good-bye" to one another; in addition, there's a ridiculous amount of
disgusting toilet humor (urine and vomit both get more screen time than
Sandler himself).  There's a hilarious running joke featuring a female
doctor who previously worked at Hooters, and the film features passable
performances from Sandler, Joey Lauren Adams (as the love interest), and
the two young boys, but the film on the whole is trite and
disappointingly unfunny.</P>
