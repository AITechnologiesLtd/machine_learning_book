<PRE>                                 PULP FICTION
                       A film review by Jeff Pidgeon
                        Copyright 1994 Jeff Pidgeon</PRE>
<P>     If you're pressed for time, I'll start by saying that PULP
FICTION is the only one of the three that I recommend.  It has many of
the classic Tarantino trademarks--the climactic multi-pistoled
stalemate, the period pop soundtrack, the multitude of junk-culture
references both verbal and visual, a clever sense of story structure,
and of course ... the violence.</P>
<P>     The level of on-screen violence is up a little from RESERVOIR
DOGS, but in general I didn't feel that it was a gratuitously violent
film, as I did with NATURAL BORN KILLERS or TOTAL RECALL.  In
general, the level is about what you would expect of a "hard-R" film
these days, although there are two se- quences--one involving a pawn
shop, another an accidental overdose--that I don't think anyone
(whether they like the film or not) will forget anytime soon.  I
recommend talking to a few viewers if you're unsure ... if you can trust
them not to reveal plot points.</P>
<P>     PULP FICTION is a three-part story, each of the parts working
their way back together (to a degree) towards the finish.  As with
RESERVOIR DOGS.  I really enjoy how Tarantino messes with flashback and
foreward to achieve some interesting results.  This is used more
effectively in RESERVOIR DOGS, but it works well again here.  It's also
surprising how Tarantino keeps PULP FICTION from seeming stale in spite
of the many similarities with his first film.  The characters and
situations are consistently amusing or tense (or both).  The dialogue,
if a bit larded with pop culture references, is clever and entertaining
(one of my favorite things about Tarantino films is the small talk).
The performances are strong across the board--Bruce Willis is fine even
if he is leaning on his washed-up-fill-in-occupation-of-your-choice
thing.  Delivery and timing of dialog is great, with more quotable
lines in a single screenplay than I've heard in a long time.
Particlarly strong is Samuel Jackson, who seems delighted to be away
from JUASSIC PARK.  The running time (2:40) is long, but it comes just
shy of wearing out its welcome--I came out well sated, but not fed up.
The surf-pop score supports the film nicely and gives it an additional
energy to add to the, uh, fun.  A minus is the constant stream of
racial epithets, which made me uncomfortable after a while.  One might
come out of this wishing that Tarantino would knock off the Madonna
lines and do something a little more mature.  Hey, give him time.
Hopefully, he's got a whole career ahead of him.  Recommended.</P>
