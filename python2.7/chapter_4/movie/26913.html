<P>   When a guy is sad day after day like Bruce Willis's
character in "Unbreakable," you could suggest Prozac--which
would not get to the root of the problem--or you can explore
with him The Big Question: "Who are you?"  By this we don't
mean the "who are you" as in "The 6th Day," which features
an Adam Gibson wondering whether he is really Adam
Gibson or just the man's clone.  We mean this in the sense
of "what are you here for?" or more specifically, "Considering
the genes you inherited and the upbringing you received,
what should you do with you life to make yourself happy?" 
David Dunn (Bruce Willis) hasn't the foggiest idea.  </P>
<P>   In M. Night Shamalyan's "Unbreakable," which the 30-year-
old director began writing even as his "The Sixth Sense" was
being introduced, David is in bad shape.  His marriage is on
the rocks, his lovely and intelligent wife Audrey (Robin Wright
Penn) sleeping in a separate room to the dismay of their
precocious son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark).  </P>
<P>  What can he do? Now, I suppose we all hope that some
day, some Big Event will occur that will brush away the
cobwebs of our lives, some transcendental experience that
will cause us to begin anew with a fresh awareness of what
our lives are all about.  Sadly, this never happens to most of
us.  But while the underachieving David Dunn--a college grad
who has settled for the job of university-based security
guard--is riding the rails back to his Philadelphia home, the
fast-moving train bolts from the tracks leaving no
survivors--except him.  What's more, he hasn't a single
scratch on his body.  This puzzles some people, who wonder
whether David has been given some remarkable powers like,
oh, Superman or Captain Marvel or Batman, and indeed we
are soon thrust into the milieu of comic books when David
meets Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson).  Price, who sells
expensive comic book covers and has a deep reverence for
the uncorrupted art of illustration, is fascinated by David
because they are so physically different.  Price, victim of
scores of broken bones dating back even to his embyonic
state, believes that the unbreakable David is his polar
opposite and quickly becomes Bhavagan to David's Arjuna.</P>
<P>   "Unbreakable" is unmistakably a Night Shyamalan film,
based in part on the young director's own life.  Coming from
a family that includes twelve doctors, Shyamalan graduated
from college with honors and received scholarships to
medical school.  Despite his environment, Shyamalan knew
who he was, and doctor he wasn't.  Obsessed with making
films, he shucked family pressure, relinquishing the
hypodermic and prescription pad for the director's chair. 
"Unbreakable" is inspired by his own life, which Shyamalan
translates into art, contrasting a guy who knows exactly who
he is with someone who is spiritually lost.  As the comic book
connoisseur is at first shrugged off by the melancholy security
guard, then embraced only to be rebuffed once again by
Dunn, we in the audience are kept suspended, sometimes
even wondering: What's going on?  Where is this story
heading?   While many of us were intrigued by "The Sixth
Sense," which had a tighter story line and a
knock-your-socks-off outcome that eluded us until we
were slammed back in our seats by The Big Payoff,
"Unbreakable" by contrast seems jagged, unedited, rough-
around-the-edges while the characters plod ever so slowly
through their paces.  The movie has the foggy look so
fashionable in the films of Ingmar Bergman such as "The
Seventh Seal," even some domestic scenes that could have
come from the Swedish director's "Scenes from a Marriage"--
the sorts of vistas that could tip a film from art into
pretension, as Woody Allen showed us in his satiric
"Shadows and Fog."  </P>
<P>   Not that there's anything wrong with slow and
misty...Recent offerings such as Terence Davies' "The House
of Mirth" based on an Edith Wharton story and Jane
Campion's "The Portrait of Lady," from the Henry James
novel, lumber on, bleak and dreary.  But what is monotonous
on the surface is redeemed by sparkling dialogue, heaped
with wit and satiric power.  The banal talk in "Unbreakable"
cannot sustain the weight of Shyamalan's movie, making this
one a disappointing follow-up to his superior work of last
year.</P>
<P>   What's more, while we can understand what David saw in
the beautiful Audrey, we may have difficulty comprehending
what a centered, intelligent woman who delivers sparkling
psychological insights to her patients while on the job as a
physical therapist sees in David Dunn.  Willis and Penn
simply don't feel like a couple, not even when they try to
renew their relationship by having a date in a swank
Philadelphia drinking emporium. </P>
<P>   Samuel L. Jackson turns in a razor-sharp performance,
even when trapped in a wheelchair, large pins sticking out of
his legs.  He does make us wonder throughout just what his
interest is in the disconsolate security guard, since he does
not come off like Will Smith's god-like Bagger Vance in the
Redford movie.  "Unbreakable" could appeal to comic-book
fans, though the picture does not have the qualities of an
animation at all, but fans of Willis and Jackson may well be
disappointed by its foggy, pretentiousness texture.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 107 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
