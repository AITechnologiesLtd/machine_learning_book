<PRE>"The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"</PRE>
<P>C.W. Briggs (Woody Allen) is the top investigator at the North Coast
Fidelity and Casualty Insurance Company. His old school manner conflicts
with the modern business ideas of newly hired efficiency expert Betty Ann
Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt) and the two butt heads constantly. When, during a
coworker's birthday party, a mystic named Voltan (David Ogden Stiers)
chooses the two as his subjects, the hypnotic suggestion he gives them
turns out to be more than just a parlor trick in Woody Allen's latest
flick, "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion."</P>
<P>The Woodman has, for a number of his later films, reached a nadir in his
filmmaking career, especially when compared to those of his heyday like
"Annie Hall" and "Manhattan." His more recent films, like "Shadow and Fog"
and "Celebrity" were almost painful to watch - if you could stand to watch
them at all. He made up some lost ground with "Sweet and Lowdown," mainly
through the efforts of the film's star, Sean Penn. The problem, I have
found, is the diminished quality of the writing by Allen, himself. Even in
his "funny" films there is a lack of pith when compared to his earlier
works.</P>
<P>"The Curse of the Jade Scorpion" reps a partial return to Woody's old
style, but, in the end, it's the lack of depth and less than sparkling
humor that keeps his latest work on the middle ground of his long career.
Sure, there are the one-liners that are a throwback to his old ways - C.W.
"How'd you like it if I hit you?" Tough rich chick Laura Kensington
(Charlize Theron) "How would you like it if I hit you back?" C.W. "Now
that's beginning to sound like fun." - but they certainly are not on a par
with his best work.</P>
<P>That's not to say that "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion" isn't fun. Woody
Allen is one of America's great filmmakers; he just doesn't produce the
great works he used to. Still, for late summer entertainment, it is a
pleasure to watch Allen play the quasi-hardboiled insurance investigator,
Briggs, as he uses old-fashioned instinct, gumshoe work, snitches and
informants to break one tough case after another. The modernity of 1940,
though, spells change for C.W.'s company when his boss, Chris Magruder (Dan
Aykroyd), hires Betty Ann Fitzgerald to shake things up and make the place
more efficient. Betty Ann thinks C.W. is a dinosaur in the business and he
thinks she is something that rhymes with "witch." The pair are always at
odds over how to run the business and are constantly bickering.</P>
<P>When Voltan, at their comrade George's birthday party at a local nightclub,
puts C.W. and Betty Ann under his spell and gives each a hypnotic
suggestion - the trigger words are Constantinople for him and Madagascar
for her - he tells them that they are madly in love with each other. It's
great fun for all, except for Magruder, who is having a clandestine affair
with his efficiency expert. Later, when Briggs is alone, he gets a
mysterious phone call that leads off with the word "Constantinople." It's
Voltan on the other end of the line and the mystic instructs C.W., now
under his spell, to break in to a wealthy clients home and steal every
jewel he can find. Of course, the next day the unwitting Briggs is ordered
to investigate the burglary and declares it an inside job.</P>
<P>When another rich client is burgled, Betty Ann decides to outsource the
investigation and brings in a pair of bumbling private eyes, Joe and Herb
Coopersmith (Peter Linari and Michael Mulheren), to solve the case, but not
before Voltan strikes again. Now, it's up to C.W. and Betty Ann, with the
help of their coworkers, to crack the crimes and clear Briggs's name.</P>
<P>Woody Allen, of late, doesn't delve far beyond his main characters in story
structure. His concentration is on the focal folks and he doesn't spend
much time developing or fleshing out any ancillary individuals around the
main characters. This is true with "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion," but it
is, still, an amusing little flick. My real problem lay between the two
lead characters. I never got the feeling that there would ever be an
attraction between C.W. and Betty Ann, so this required a real leap of
faith for me. Putting that aside, the adversarial conflict between the two
has the most punch in the film as Allen and Hunt play a couple of people
who love to hate each other.</P>
<P>Supporting cast is well rounded though no one is given a great deal to do.
David Ogden Stiers, as Voltan, gets to put a malevolent spin on his con
artist character. Charlize Theron, as the wealthy and caustic Laura, is
introduced as a Veronica Lake look-alike and puts a tough spin on her
character. If anything, Theron is underutilized in a role that she seems to
relish. Dan Aykroyd has proven himself to be an effective character actor
in the past and continues this track record as sleazy boss man Magruder.
Wallace Shawn and Brian Markinson, as C.W.'s coworkers, aren't given much
to do.</P>
<P>Techs are as expected in a Woody Allen film. Zhao Fei has lensed the last
several Allen films and works to keep the look consistent with the maker's
earlier efforts, but, boy, do I miss Gordon Willis behind the camera.
Costume designer Suzanne McCabe helps capture the look of the 40's and
longtime Allen collaborator Santo Loquasto does a solid job on the period
production design. Music, as one expects in a Woody Allen film, is perfect
with its mix of big band swing and combo jazz from the era.</P>
<P>One always hopes that Woody is going to produce another masterpiece like
"Manhattan." We don't get it with "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion," but we
do get a solid middlin' film from the guy. I give it a B-.</P>
