<PRE>"Hardball" – Take Me Out to the Ball Game 
by Homer Yen 
(c) 2001 </PRE>
<P>If you see at least 10 movies a year and if you're the 
kind of moviegoer that likes to settle into your seat 
before the previews begin, you've probably seen 
trailers of Public Service Announcements.  Situated 
after unwelcome commercials but before film previews, 
you might have seen clips espousing the cause of the 
Will Rogers Institute, a charity race for some dreaded 
disease, or the warm segment in which a person 
standing in front of his broken down car in a 
torrential downpour is given an umbrella by a passing 
car.  "Courtesy," says the voice-over.  "Pass it on." </P>
<P>One uplifting PSA is the one that features young 
adults who struggle to do something better with their 
lives despite the dark pressures of inner city life. 
With the tagline, "Opportunity, the anti-drug," it 
projects a spirit that is uplifting and hopeful.  The 
essence of that two-minute segment is captured in 
"Hardball," based on an early 90s memoir of coaching 
Little League baseball in Chicago's Cabrini-Green 
housing project.  The film is a surprisingly emotional 
and gritty melodrama about inner city youths and a 
down-and-out loser who hope to find a safe haven. </P>
<P>The film quickly establishes a tone of despondency and 
desperation as we meet Conor (Keanu Reeves), an 
addicted gambler indebted to the wrong kinds of 
people.  His creditors don't charge interest; they 
just bash heads.  Looking as if he hadn't slept in a 
week, we see him praying in church.  A passing priest 
asks, "You looking for faith? Forgiveness?"  Conor 
solemnly replies, "I'm looking for the Bulls to cover 
the spread." </P>
<P>In dire straits, he calls a long-time friend for help. 
 Conor is told that he'll get $500 a week in return 
for his services as a coach for a boy's baseball team 
in the projects.  With little choice in the matter, he 
grudgingly reports to the tattered field and meets his 
team.  Underprivileged, the kids lack tact, 
discipline, and brotherhood.  It'll take a miracle for 
them to jell.  </P>
<P>But baseball has a strange way of bringing everyone 
closer together.  And with the right coach and the 
right attitude, miracles can happen.  "New rule," 
demands Conor.  "No one can say anything bad about 
anyone else on the team." And with those words the 
kids begin to slowly develop a sense of camaraderie 
and a sense of unity.  The kids, all feisty yet 
adorable, see Conor as the father that they never had 
and baseball as their anti-drug.  Conor meanwhile 
slowly transforms from seedy hustler to a man who 
rediscovers his self-respect.  Reeves-as-Conor turns 
in one of his better dramatic performances (which even 
made me want to say his trademark line of "Whoa").   </P>
<P>While the baseball story is what the film swings for, 
it's the biting urban milieu that allows the film to 
go the distance.  Otherwise, it would be about as 
interesting as watching today's Bulls (without Jordan, 
Pippen, and Rodman).  When Conor escorts a team member 
back to his project apartment, for example, he is 
shocked to see everyone sitting on the floor.  His 
player matter-of-factly says, "no one wants to get hit 
by bullets."  The pall of inner city life may 
discourage them and tragedy may try to overtake them. 
But baseball and hope will always be their anti-drug. </P>
