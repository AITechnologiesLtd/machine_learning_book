<PRE>BY THE TIME WE GET TO PHOENIX
by Kristian Lin</PRE>
<P>"How do we forgive our fathers?"  That line, spoken by a voiceover
narrator, comes toward the end of SMOKE SIGNALS, an accomplished and at
times remarkable film.  It's meant to be the movie's epigraph, but it
could serve the same purpose for several other recent movies.</P>
<P>The movie starts when Victor Joseph (Adam Beach), a Coeur d'Alene Indian
who lives on the reservation in Idaho, receives the news that his
father, Arnold, has died in Phoenix.  His nerdy friend Thomas
Builds-the-Fire (Evan Adams) offers him the money for the trip from
Idaho on the condition that he let Thomas go along with him.  Victor
doesn't like Thomas all that much, but he needs the money, so he
reluctantly accepts.  Arnold once saved the infant Thomas's life, and
Thomas now idolizes him as a brash, colorful, bigger-than-life
character.  Victor, on the other hand, remembers him as an abusive,
unpredictable drunk who abandoned his family.</P>
<P>SMOKE SIGNALS began as a book of short stories by Sherman Alexie.  When
Hollywood expressed interest in filming his screenplay adaptation, he
held out for a Native American film director.  With Chris Eyre, he made
the right choice.  The pacing is deliberate, providing the properly
relaxed, open-road atmosphere that lends itself to Alexie's tiny, sharp
insights.  He isn't afraid to take stylistic chances, but he finds a
nice balance between fantasy scenes and the movie's smaller-scaled
moments.</P>
<P>Hollywood often uses Native Americans as symbols, or occasionally as
slyly comic figures who play on white people's ignorance of them.  It's
sad, though, that we needed Native American filmmakers to portray 
Native Americans who don't behave as if they're from another planet. 
These characters are firmly placed in American pop culture, even as
they're given a bemused, detached attitude towards it.  Victor and
Thomas's worm's-eye point of view makes their references to Michael
Jordan and the DEATH WISH movies so breezily amusing.</P>
<P>SMOKE SIGNALS is like GOOD WILL HUNTING in that both movies are best at
depicting the banter of guys hanging out.  Critics have already given
their dues to the chant of "John Wayne's teeth" and Thomas's praise of
Victor's mother's frybread, but there's also stuff like the story of
Arnold getting his picture in the paper, or Thomas's shirt that reads
"Frybread Power."  Evan Adams, in particular, deserves some credit - he 
seems carried away by his own narrative sense when he gives voice to the
stories.</P>
<P>But it isn't just the tone that these movies share.  Like Will Hunting,
Victor's a strong, silent type who's crying on the inside because of his
father's abuse.  SMOKE SIGNALS, though, tops GOOD WILL HUNTING in that
the father isn't just a shadowy, fairy-tale monster.  He's a complex
character who's carrying around his own pain.  Seen in flashback (and
played brilliantly by Gary Farmer), Arnold is a troubled shell of his
former fun-loving self.  He's still capable of real warmth and inspires
the love of his neighbor Suzy (an incandescent Irene Bedard).  His
telling a story of Victor's performance in a basketball game results in
a bravura scene that's worthy of the inspired heights of Spike Lee's HE
GOT GAME.  Arnold's pride in his son infuses the whole screen with an
electricity that results in a great, thrilling moment.</P>
<P>Eyre's film also dares to suggest that exorcising one's demons is a
somewhat complicated process.  Will Hunting achieves catharsis because
his therapist keeps telling him, "It's not your fault." (Hell, if that's
all it took to cure him, "Saturday Night Live's" Stuart Smalley could
have done the job.)  Eyre and Alexie leave Victor's healing incomplete
at the movie's end.  Neither film reaches the level of HE GOT GAME -
Spike Lee takes things a step further by daring to make Jesus
Shuttlesworth emotionally functional in spite of his father's neglect -
but Eyre's movie is mostly and refreshingly free of the self-pity that
pervades GOOD WILL HUNTING.</P>
<P>SMOKE SIGNALS boasts a veritable all-star lineup of Indian actors.  As
Victor's mother, Tantoo Cardinal has the soft radiance and authority of
a Susan Sarandon.  Michelle St. John and Elaine Miles (from TV's 
"Northern Exposure") are a daffy pair of girls who cruise the
reservation in a car that's apparently stuck in reverse.  It goes to
show that there is a talent pool of Native Americans that has been
scandalously underused by Hollywood casting directors.  Anglo actor Tom
Skerritt also gets a spicy cameo as a local sheriff.</P>
<P>In the end, SMOKE SIGNALS is a film that reinforces what we should
already know - everyone has a story to tell.  I was planning on ending
this piece by expressing the hope that this movie would spur Native 
Americans and people from other minorities to film their experiences.  I
still have that hope, but a movie this good doesn't need that kind of
hook.  It's a highly enjoyable road picture told from a different point
of view, and that's reason enough to make it out to your art-house
theater to see it.</P>
