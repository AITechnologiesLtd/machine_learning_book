GOLDFINGER (1964)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>When we are dealing with movie series made out of twenty or
so titles, finding the best of them might look like a
difficult task. But, in the case of James Bond films, it
isn't so. Almost everyone agrees that the best Bond films
used to be made in 1960s, in a Golden Age that spawned Sean
Connery and set the standards that would never be satisfied
again in later decades. Choice is even simpler when we
discount first two films - DR. NO and FROM RUSSIA AND LOVE -
which were some sort of experiments for the series creators.
The third film in the series, GOLDFINGER, directed in 1964
by Guy Hamilton, is often considered to be the first "true"
Bond, the one that firmly established formula that we all
know and love. GOLDFINGER also has a very special meaning
for the author of this review. It was the first Bond film I
have ever watched, and, although some time had to pass
before I started truly appreciating its quality, it sets my
standards for all the future Bond viewing experiences.</P>
<P>The plot of the film begins when British secret agent James
Bond (played by Sean Connery) crosses path with Auric
Goldfinger (played by Gert Froebe), wealthy international
gold trader, whose character is unscrupulous enough to cheat
even in trivial games of poker and golf. British and
American authorities suspect that he could break rules even
in even more serious matters like international trade, and
Bond is being sent to investigate possible Goldfinger's
involvement in grand-scale gold smuggling operation.
Goldfinger is too shrewd to allow himself being fooled by
Bond's cover as fellow smuggler, but Bond won't stop the
investigation. The trail leads him to Switzerland, where he
would hear Goldfinger discussing some sinister plan called
"Grand Slam". Unfortunately, he can't report his findings to
his superiors, since Goldfinger's henchmen capture him.
Goldfinger decides to leave Bond alive for a while, and his
personal pilot Pussy Galore (played by Honor Blackman) would
fly him over the Atlantic to Goldfinger's stables in
Kentucky. Bond there sees what the "Grand Slam" actually is
- spectacular raid on the US government golden reserves in
Fort Knox. Equipped with this knowledge, Bond must find a
way to escape and foil Goldfinger's plan.</P>
<P>GOLDFINGER is often referred as the best example of what
Bond movie is and what every Bond movie should be. Made in
1964, as a third movie of a well-established series, it was
the fortunate transition between realism and seriousness of
first two films, and spectacle and glamour of later Bond
films. The plot is, relatively speaking, realistic (at least
for the Bond series standards), and the script by Richard
Maibaum and Paul Dehn actually improved Ian Fleming's
original novel in this area. The character of Bond is hardly
invincible and in the film he often makes mistakes, gets
beaten or captured, and his survival generally depends more
on the mere luck and good will of other people than on his
own brain or charm. Sean Connery again shows his great
talent making his jovial attitude even in direst of
circumstances quite believable.</P>
<P>This time character of James Bond has quite a match in the
character of chief Bond Villain. Auric Goldfinger is
brilliantly played by German actor Gert Froebe and, unlike
the usual cardboard villains of the Bond series, this one
looks genuine. From the first scene, he is clearly
identified as Bad Guy and audience is spared from the
unnecessary and time-consuming attempts to shed doubts about
his moral alignment. Goldfinger is also portrayed as truly
intelligent villain, someone who relies more on his brain
than on his immense wealth or underground armies of
henchmen, and, in the end, has enough brains to think about
back-up plans. Such Bond Villain truly deserves to have
quality assistants at his disposal, and Korean bodyguard
Oddjob, played by Harold Sakata. Equipped with funny yet
deadly hat, and almost invincible, Oddjob gives Bond run for
his money and turns out to be the best Bond Villain ever (or
at least shares that spot with 1970s Jaws).</P>
<P>Bond Villain is not the only category that makes this Bond
movie superior to the rest. Pussy Galore, played by Honor
Blackman, is more than interesting Bond Girl. She is quite
believable character - tough, no-nonsense and able to take
care of herself. But most of all, she is mature, at least
compared to usual Bond Girl stock (in case of Honor Blackman
term "girl" might not be quite appropriate, since she was 38
years old in time of production). However, despite her
relatively old age, she manages to stay not just impressive,
but very sexy and sometimes even more desirable than two
other younger yet more shallow Bond beauties in the form of
Shirley Eaton and Tanya Mallet. Even her defection to the
side of the Good Guys couldn't be explained as simple
capitulation to Bond's masculine charm - Bond appealed to
her common sense as well as her feminine desires.</P>
<P>In terms of spectacle, GOLDFINGER represents the obvious
improvement over first two sequels. The series introduces
one of not so important and obligatory, yet attractive
elements of Bond formula - spectacular battle between Good
Guys and Bad Guys. But most attractive thing about
GOLDFINGER is its style. Guy Hamilton paces film
brilliantly, never allowing a single minute of the film to
seem boring. Musical soundtrack by John Barry is one of the
best ever made in history of cinema, and the title song,
sung by Shirley Bassey, became some sort of Bond's
alternative anthem. GOLDFINGER is also great in visual
sense, with Ted Moore providing excellent photography and
Ken Adam creating truly impressive production settings. But
the most memorable thing about GOLDFINGER is, of course,
dead girl being covered with gold paint - one of the most
memorable images not only in history of cinema, but also in
history of art. There are few examples when artists are able
to create images that are haunting, terrifying and erotic in
the same time.</P>
<P>Another thing that makes GOLDFINGER truly attractive is the
fact that such films couldn't be made in this time and age.
Feminists would cringe at the sight of women being treated
like nothing more than easily disposable sexual objects, and
PC police would be infuriated with the fact that the
majority of villains happens to be of Asian origin. Newer
generations would probably grin after Bond's Beatles remark,
which shows how deeply Bond series was ingrained in its
time. Such remark shows how deeply Bond series was ingrained
in its time, and, consequently, all attempts to adapt it to
more "modern" sensibilities turn it into pathetic parody of
itself. Despite being set in past times, GOLDFINGER found
its way to the modern audiences and it is quite
understandable how even the generations born decades later
don't hesitate to name it the best Bond film ever made.</P>
