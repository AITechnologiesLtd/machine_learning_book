<PRE>HAV PLENTY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     HAV PLENTY, as we are told in the beginning and reminded during
the film, is a true story.  Life itself is a series of true stories,
but most are not movie material.</P>
<P>     As scripted, directed, and acted by cinematic newcomer Christopher
Scott Cherot, HAV PLENTY limps along at best.  Its dialog is so stilted
- "You know what they say, 'No women; no cry.'" - that the actors are
content to read the screenplay rather than invest much energy in trying
to act it.</P>
<P>     In the story, Lee Plenty (Cherot) is a 28-year-old author and
teaching assistant.  The movie, which happens mainly over the New
Year's holiday, consists of a series of incidents in which various
single and married women try to kiss Lee or take him to bed.  Since he
consistently refuses, Caroline Gooden (Tammi Katherine Jones) figures
that he must be gay.</P>
<P>     Eventually he and Havilland "Hav" Savage (Chenoa Maxwell) get
together, proving that he wasn't gay after all, just picky.  Sexy women
can sit on his lap and ask him to go to bed with them, but he will not
even kiss them.  He's a man who knows his mind, which he frequently
shares directly with the audience in a series of trite and overly cute
monologues.</P>
<P>     Filled with wealthy African-Americans, the story is closest in
tone to LOVE JONES, which was better.  HAV PLENTY's story doesn't go
anywhere.  At the end it subjects us to Lee Plenty's new film, which is
a movie of the movie we've just seen, but with even worse acting.</P>
<P>     "Remember folks that, as outrageous as this all seems, this is a
true story."  Hav tells the camera, but the problem is that it's not
outrageous at all or even the least bit interesting.  HAV PLENTY isn't
so much a bad film as it is a total waste of the audience's time.</P>
<P>     HAV PLENTY runs 1:32.  It is rated R for profanity and would be
fine for most teenagers.</P>
