<P>   Men are from Venus and women are from Mars...of is it the
other way around?  If you go by some of the wisdom of
today's self-help books, you wonder how the two sexes ever
got together.  Men talk sports and cars and maybe politics. 
Women talk emotions.  At least that's the stereotype and
that's the pigeonhole which writer-director Tom Gilroy aims to
explode in "Spring Forward."  As co-artistic director of the
New York theater company Machine Full, Gilroy is a man of
the stage, not the screen, which becomes obvious early on in
his feature film debut.  He'd be the envy of Eric Rohmer and
a whole band of French scripters, given the incessant
dialogue that Gilroy feeds to his crackerjack actors in what is
essentially a two-character filmed play-cum-Connecticut
foliage.  Marred by some indistinct vocal fidelity and
photographer Terry Stacey's occasional lapses (in one
instance, he muffs the opportunity to exploit the energy of
some mixed Labrador puppies), "Spring Forward"
nonetheless gives its audience some more exposure to the
talents of Liev Schreiber and Ned Beatty, the latter a veteran
of the screen with oodles of awards and Oscar nominations,
the former becoming one of the hottest names in the industry.</P>
<P>   "Spring Forward," so-named because Gilroy takes us
through four seasons (and seven scenes) in the lives of the
30-year-old Paul (Liev Schreiber) and the 65-year-old Murphy
(Ned Beatty), furnishes us a story of two flawed individuals
ironing out each other's shortcomings, bonding gloriously
despite their differences in age and outlook. Murph, who is
about to complete a career as a department of parks
employee, has taken on a new co-worker, Paul, who had
recently emerged from an 18-month stretch in prison for
armed robbery of a Dunkin' Donuts store.  His interval in the
slammer has turned him into a reader, particularly of New
Age philosophy, and he sprinkles his conversations regularly
with terms like karma and the sayings of the Dalai Lama.  He
also has a penchant for using the "f" word, which his aging
colleague dislikes intensely.  </P>
<P>   We can see from the start that the rough-around-the-edges
Paul is going to get an object lesson in civilization from his
new mentor while Murph, uptight and less willing than Paul to
express his deeper feelings, will learn to open up and relax. 
In a sense the relationship between the two men is not unlike
that of the four businessmen from Atlanta in Beatty's debut
as an actor, John Boorman's 1972 "Deliverance."  This time
around, just two men will get more than they bargained for,
though their experiences in no way match the thrills of
Boorman's canoe trip.</P>
<P>   Stretches of real physical action come and go with no
follow-up--the sex-hungry Paul meets a lonely woman; the
two men discover a strange fellow who seems to live under a
house; Paul and Murphy refuse to help load a truck with
fertilizer because the spoiled young man who asks them to
do so refuses to help; Paul seeks to rescue a battered,
hysterical woman who has run away from home with her
frightened daughter.  Gilroy appears to have no need to wrap
things up, to use these scenes as a foreshadowing of later
events.  In other words, the action regularly springs forward
but never falls backward.  Instead, the movie is content to
spotlight the relationship of these two ordinary men (who in
modern, trendy language could be considered a couple of
white guys sitting around talking), each of whom provides
deliverance for the other.  This is the sort of film that could
ideally be enjoyed on the tube, valuable as show pieces for
the two fine performers.</P>
