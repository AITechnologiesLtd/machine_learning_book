<PRE>GREMLINS (1984)
Reviewed By David Wilcock
(C)1998 David Wilcock</PRE>
<P>Starring Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, Hoyt Axton, Scott
Brady and Polly Holliday</P>
<PRE>Directed By Joe Dante</PRE>
<P>This Steven Spielberg produced film became another hit for him,
even if he didn't direct it. The film opens with Ran Peltzer (Axton)
walking around in Chinatown. He walks into an odd shop, run by
a very old chinese man (Keye Luke) An odd creature called
Gizmo, who is a mowlgi. Ran buys the pet, three rules are told to
him (no water on Gizmo, no bright light, and don't feed him after
midnight, classic fairy tale stuff) and Ran gives Gizmo to his son,
Billy (Galligan) Of course, the rules are broken, and a group of evil
creatures start terrorising the quiet town of Kingston Falls (a very
Spielberg place), where Billy lives.</P>
<P>The problem with the film, though, is that Gremlins don't really get
into swing until one hour into the movie, when the Gremlins drive a
snow plough through a house. It's non stop action from there on.
But before that, the story has to be set up, and Chris Columbus
(Home Alone, Mrs Doubtfire) script has to keep the audiences
attention. Sadly, his script does start to lag, but thankfully, the
performances and direction don't. Galligan, Cates (who plays Billy
girlfriend), Judge Reinhold (Ruthless People, Beverly Hills Cop)
and Dick Miller (Twilight Zone The Movie) are all good,and push
the film along. Polly Holliday is reasonable funny in the role of Mrs
Beagle, even if her role is hopelessly underwritten. Joe Dante
directs well, making sure he can get the best out of the
performances.</P>
<P>But the best performances come from Gizmo, voiced by Howie
Mandel, and the Gremlins. Gizmo is sickingly cute, and has got
real character. The Gremlins, designed by Chris Walas (who did
makeup effects for The Fly) are sickingly sick, and are really
funny. Here, Joe Dante really shows what he's good at directing,
which is manic comedy/horor. There are some great deaths, some
silly scenes, and some groan worthy gags, but the film really gets
going when the Gremlins finally start to cause chaos. Here,
thankfully, any hope of a script disappears, and Columbus just gets
on with the mischief.</P>
<P>Stick with the film, then, and it's ultimately rewarding. With some
good music by Jerry Goldsmith (Total Recall, Star Trek: The
Motion Picture) an excellent supporting cast (Dick Miller is very
good) and some good (although nasty) laughs, the last 50 minutes
of Gremlins is some of the best black comedy you are ever going
to see. If only a stronger scriptwriter was hired, then maybe the
first hour would be excellent also. Gremlins 2 is better than this,
because it didn't have to explain much back story, and it was more
enjoyable generally. Gremlins, then, although flawed, is still
recommended.</P>
<PRE>OVERALL RATING=*** out of *****</PRE>
