<P>An excellent, warmer, gentler, kinder Chinese film, and a special 
case. It was made neither as a State project or with foreign moneys, 
but with funds raised within China by its American producer. It is 
the second of three highly successful features by the same 
director-producer team..   On the international festival circuit 
"Shower" has won many top or major awards (Toronto, San Sebastian, 
Thessaloniki, Rotterdam, etc.)</P>
<P>Chinese cinema is a force to be reckoned with nowadays.  Movies shown 
only within China's borders deal -- in politically correct ways--with 
proud accomplishments, such as Mao's famous March. Others, including 
exports, have historical themes or at least deal with the past. It is 
unusual for us to see works on the human condition today, including 
about tradition and modernism.</P>
<P>Shower opens with just that, a shower. In a busy downtown street of 
the modernized southern region of Shenzen, a man presses a button to 
enter a booth the size of  those portable potties used in 
construction sites or crowded public gatherings. It is The Amazing 
Automatic Shower which, like those clever Parisian street toilets 
(successfully tried in New York City but I do not know if they caught 
on) is a modern wonder.</P>
<P>The thing is rather like a mechanized car wash but now humans replace 
the cars. Water jets, liquid soap, rotating brushes, automatic drying 
are used in this fantastic People Wash. Our fellow takes off his 
clothes (real nudity here), safely stores them in a waterproof gizmo, 
gets a thorough mechanical going over, special massages, other 
treatments, and even an application of cups. (For the millions in the 
USA who don't know that the latter means, it consists of glass cups, 
heated inside to make a vacuum, applied to the back so that the 
vacuum raises the skin and theoretically sucks up bad humors and 
other enemies of good health. This was and maybe still is a common 
treatment for colds -- in Europe and in many other parts of the 
world.) This opening sequence of the film is by itself worth the cost 
of a theater ticket. I would like to apply for an importing license.</P>
<P>The Chinese never had it so good. But the scene, while wonderfully 
funny to foreign eyes as well as an impressive sample of Chinese 
technology, is also a serious, symbolic  element of melding the old 
and the new.</P>
<P>Cut to Beijing, which is in the North. In what seems to be a popular, 
old-fashioned, run-down neighborhood,  Master Liu runs a public 
bathhouse for men, with the help of his second son Er Ming. The 
latter always has an endearing smile, is mentally retarded, yet 
perfectly able to help with the establishment. The relationship 
between father and son is one of tremendous warmth and understanding, 
shown in discreet, un-gloppy scenes.</P>
<P>Er Ming's older brother Da Ming is handsome, chic,  married, and a 
modern, successful businessman. He lives in the south . Having 
received a cryptic postcard from junior brother, Da Ming thinks that 
Dad is either dead or seriously ill.  He catches the first available 
plane, he flies north... and finds Dad in seemingly good health.</P>
<P>The bathhouse is quite old-fashioned in an attractive way, spacious, 
well-equipped with hot tubs, hot and cold showers, steam rooms, 
massage-tables and the like. And it is more than a place for cleaning 
one's body. It is like the corner cafe in European, African, 
Middle-Eastern and other lands --and like the general store in older, 
rural US. small towns. For the customers, mostly aged regulars, it is 
a gathering place, a neighborhood club where talking, chatting, 
gossiping, arguing among friends is essential to life, where they 
cleanse their souls and minds. The elders (and some younger persons) 
drink tea, play chess, organize cricket fights. (There is no 
statement at film's end that no animals were harmed)</P>
<P>Master Liu is not only a host to his clients (a word that hardly 
expresses the friendly relationships) but a mediator and 
problem-solver. Some warm, often funny plot threads show this and add 
much to the film's atmosphere. The tale, however, is complicated by 
unwelcome news. Area authorities are going to tear down the entire 
outdated (?) neighborhood to make room for a modern mall.</P>
<P>Da Ming tarries awhile, behaves politely, but never cracks a smile. 
He must find that whole culture passé. Yet, as he prolongs his stay 
and more developments follow, there is a gradual understanding on his 
part, and like the movie's characters as well as for the audiences, 
comes a strong confirmation of how sad it is to have modernism 
displace yet not replace certain old traditions.</P>
<P>"Shower" is quietly rich in humanity, excellent acting and moving 
incidents. It has a lovely sense of humor, heart, sentiment --but no 
artificial sweeteners. There is even a flashback sequence (in old, 
arid Northwest China) which adds touching lyricism and symbolism to 
this first-rate urban movie.</P>
