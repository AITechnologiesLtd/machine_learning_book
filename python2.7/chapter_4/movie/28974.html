<PRE>JURASSIC PARK (1993)
Part of the A LOOK BACK series
July 25th, 2001 
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia</PRE>
<P>Steven Spielberg is one of the few directors that can produce real movie 
magic on screen. Consider the magic wand he waved in such classics as 
"Raiders of the Lost Ark", "E.T.", "Jaws" and "Close Encounters of the Third 
Kind." "Jurassic Park" is no exception and though it is no classic by any 
means, it is a thrill-happy, terrifically exciting action picture bringing 
back Spielberg's whiz-bang intensity that the otherwise middling "Always" and 
the overblown "Hook" lacked. </P>
<P>Based loosely on Michael Crichton's novel, "Jurassic Park" focuses on a group 
of scientists (Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern) visiting a 
fantastical park in a South American island populated by live-breathing 
dinosaurs, including a vicious Tyrannosaurus Rex, quick-tempered, meat-eating 
velociraptors, and cuddly Brontosaurus specimens. According to John Hammond 
(Richard Attenborough), the owner of the park, the dinosaurs were genetically 
engineered by dinosaur blood found in mosquitoes, which were preserved in 
amber! Essentially, Hammond is like Frankenstein, bringing back dinosaurs 
from the dead!</P>
<P>"Jurassic Park" is a thrill ride from start to finish. Spielberg and writers 
Michael Crichton and David Koepp are not interested in character development 
- they simply know that audiences are too interested in seeing dinosaurs. You 
have to remember that the year 1993 was a revolutionary year for cinema - the 
term CGI was born. This  meant that creating believable creatures and 
landscapes with the use of computer-generated images was a true possibility. 
Thus, this film was the first to ever show the most realistic dinosaurs ever 
seen in film history and that was the draw for audiences. Today, CGI seems 
like an afterthought but back then, it was an astounding achievement. </P>
<P>Spielberg uses CGI to his advantage. There are two exceptional Spielberg 
sequences: one is a scary, horrifying sequence in which the T-Rex attacks two 
kids trapped in a car, and the other is when the velociraptors trap the same 
kids in a kitchen. There are lots of dino chomping scenes but then there are 
some purely amazing moments that evoke a sense of wonder and joy. The first 
glimpse of a dinosaur is the brontosaurus as it tries to reach a tree branch 
- Spielberg shoots the scene from a low-angle so that we get the feeling we 
are witnessing a majestic, prehistoric creature too grand and mysterious for 
our eye level. The T-Rex itself is astounding, and the impressive soundtrack 
(recorded in DTS, digital sound, for the first time ever) enhances the 
credibility and realism of these creatures. </P>
<P>So much talk about the dinos, what about the humans? Well, they recede in the 
background because any movie with creatures, especially dinos, will steal 
scenes from others, no holds barred. Still, this is a helluva good cast. 
Attenborough is appropriately and equally gleeful and stubborn as the 
gullible owner, unaware of what he has created. Sam Neill, an actor I 
dislike, gives a pleasing performance as Dr. Grant who seems to have a 
dislike for children. Laura Dern is wasted as Grant's wife, capable of much 
more than screaming fits. The actor who upstages them all is Jeff Goldblum as 
Ian Malcolm, a chaos theorist and mathematician who wears funny sunglasses 
and a rock n'roll leather jacket - he seems to have stepped out of "American 
Graffiti." His one-liners and his ridicule of this dangerous theme park bring 
a level of irony that Spielberg could have carried further than he does. </P>
<P>As a story, "Jurassic Park" lacks much thrust or significance, though it can 
be construed as a modern-day Frankenstein tale where the act of creating 
rests solely on whether something should be created, particularly when you 
meddle with nature. The characters are thin but they remain watchable 
personalities (including Samuel L. Jackson in a small role as a computer 
expert and Wayne Knight as another computer expert who decides to steal some 
specimens). But for undeniable thrills and escapist entertainment, nothing 
can beat Spielberg's exciting dinos and kinetic action sequences. As Pauline 
Kael once remarked, Spielberg doesn't just thrill you, he spooks you with 
giddiness and exhilaration. </P>
