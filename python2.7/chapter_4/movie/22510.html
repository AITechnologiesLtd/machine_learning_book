STUART LITTLE
A review excerpt by Joe Barlow

<P>
What astonishes me about Stuart Little is not its
aggressive cuteness (of which there is no shortage) but its
abundance of wit.  Works geared towards children are often
insultingly banal, both to the parents who are forced to
endure them and to the kids themselves.  (I remember
reading several "young adult" books while in elementary
school and wondering why the author was "talking" to me
like I was an idiot.)  I'm not sure who to credit for
the story's wit--the screenwriters?  The director?  The
actors, who convey the dialogue with such natural
rhythm that it sounds almost musical at times?  No matter;
I'm sure the film's charm is a sum of all these parts,
a feat made even more impressive by the fact that Stuart
himself was inserted into the footage weeks after the actors
had finished shooting their scenes and gone home.</P>
