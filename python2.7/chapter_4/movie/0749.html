<PRE>                               CINEMA PARADISO
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  A loving look at a post-World War II
     Sicilian village and a boy who loved the movies.  Salvatore
     Cascio is excellent as the boy and Philippe Noiret is good as
     his mentor.  Sentimental but often moving.  In re-editing
     much of the thrust of the film has apparently been redirected
     to make it a much different film than was screened in Italy.
     (If you have seen the film, please read the note at the end
     of the review.)  Rating: low +3.</PRE>
<P>     It is just after World War II in Giancaldo, a small town in Sicily.
Life is hard, troubles are large, and most pleasures are small.  One
pleasure is big, bigger than the richest man in town.  It is the big screen
down at the Cinema Paradiso.  The big screen tells big stories, stories of
tortured love, action stories, musicals with big production numbers.  And in
front of the big screen is a small boy, Toto.  To Toto there is school,
there is sleep, there is work, there is food, and there are movies.  The
first four are mundane and leave Toto in Giancaldo.  Movies are magical and
can take him any place in the world, from the houses of the rich to the Wild
West.  To Toto not just the stories are magical but the theater is also,
with its bright beam coming from a sculptured lion's mouth.  Toto has even
sneaked a look at the machine that makes the picture and at old Alfredo, the
irritable man who runs the machine that makes the movies.  For Toto to get
closer to the movies he will have to make friends with Alfredo and maybe
learn how Alfredo runs the projector.</P>
<P>     Thus begins a life-long friendship between young Salvatore--called
Toto--and Alfredo the poor projectionist.  And the friendship is built
around the love both have for the movies.  Set against the backdrop of the
Sicilian peasant village the story shows Salvatore himself become a
projectionist; we see him grow up and fall in love.  The story is told in
flashback as it is remembered by the adult Salvatore on the night that he
has heard of Alfredo's death.</P>
<P>     CINEMA PARADISO, directed and written by Giuseppe Tornetore, is full of
loving detail about the post-war movie exhibition business and has many
endearing portraits of the Sicilian peasants who mob the theater to get a
touch of something that transcends their unglamorous lives.  Ennio Morricone
scored this film, originally three hours in length, shown in Italy at two
and a half hours in 1988, and cut to about two hours for American audiences.
This is a sentimental and endearing film that will be well remembered.  I
rate it a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     (Note for those who have seen the film, spoiler for those who have not:
The following is a quote from the VARIETY 11/23/88 review of the film, then
called NUOVO CINEMA PARADISO.  It reveals an important plot twist edited out
of the version released in this country.  "[Salvatore] returns to Sicily for
Alfredo's funeral and finds his long lost love, now played by Brigitte
Fossey.  Amid many tears, Salvatore learns it was his blind friend who broke
up this one, true romance of his life."  In fact, it was a weakness of the
film that that loose end was never tied up.  Apparently the American
distributor did not want Alfredo to be made less sympathetic, though anybody
who steals pieces of films is not particularly sympathetic as far as I am
concerned.)</P>
