                       A film review by James Berardinelli

Subtitled </P>
<P>     THROUGH THE OLIVE TREES, the latest movie from Iranian director 
Abbas Kiarostami (and the third in an unofficial trilogy of which the 
first two chapters were WHERE IS THE FRIEND'S HOME? and AND LIFE GOES 
ON...), is an art-film lover's art film.  Slow almost to the point of 
stagnation, the movie serves the dual function of a 
character/relationship study and a firsthand look at the difficulties of 
making a motion picture in the rural regions of Iran.  If you've never 
had the unique experience of simultaneously being bored and fascinated 
by a movie, THROUGH THE OLIVE TREES is a likely candidate for the first 
opportunity. </P>
<P>     I didn't fall asleep during the film, but many patrons in the 
theater understandably did.  Nothing much happens during the one-hundred 
minute running time.  There are long periods of inactivity, including a 
climactic ten-minute shot of one person chasing after another.  There's 
no dialogue during this scene, and the only sound (other than the music) 
is the wind rustling through the olive trees.  Those without a tolerance 
for slow, deliberate movies will find this a trial beyond belief.  It's 
not much of stretch to call this the cinematic equivalent of a Sominex. </P>
<P>     The seemingly-turgid pace is necessary, however.  Had things moved 
faster, numerous subtle and intricate touches would have been lost.  The 
characters are all marvelously realized, and their interaction is so 
unforced that it draws the viewer in.  Kiarostami has used carefully-
framed point-of-view camera shots to emphasize the intimacy of his 
picture.  This movie puts the audience right next to the actors. </P>
<P>     The story is simple.  A film director is making a movie in the 
Iranian countryside.  He recruits local actors, but when shooting 
begins, a problem comes to light.  His male lead, a young man named 
Hossein (playing himself), is madly in love with his fifteen-year old 
female co-star, Tahereh (playing herself).  Because of Hossein's 
illiteracy and homelessness, a marriage is impossible, at least from the 
perspective of Tahereh's grandmother (who is also her guardian).  
Undaunted, the young man continues to pledge his undying love.  For her 
part, Tahereh is busy studying for her exams and the last thing she 
wants is to engage in a conversation -- any conversation -- with the 
ardent suitor she wishes would go away.  A finer cinematic portrait of 
unrequited love has not been seen since MANON OF THE SPRING.   </P>
<P>     Not only is the courtship (such as it is) of Tahereh and Hossein 
presented with a rare and unflinching honesty, but we are *not* given an 
opportunity to find out how things are resolved.  The film's ending is 
open to interpretation and reminds us that movies are only windows into 
another reality, and it's possible for them to close at the most 
inopportune times. </P>
<P>     Moments of comedy are sprinkled throughout, often relating to the 
difficulties experienced by the director of the film-within-the-film as 
he attempts to get uncooperative performers to complete a take.  This 
device of having actors playing the actors who filmed one of 
Kiarostami's previous films (the on-screen director is actually actor 
Mohamad Ali Keshavarz playing Kiarostami) creates opportunities for 
confusion, but mostly it lends an air of verisimilitude to the 
proceedings that results in a documentary-like style.  Kiarostami, a 
master of camera angles, uses a preponderance of deceptively simple 
shots to give his production a perspective that's very different from 
that of most current feature releases.   </P>
<P>     THROUGH THE OLIVE TREES is an exceptionally well-crafted and 
thoughtful motion picture.  There is no melodrama here -- this is 
straightforward drama without frills or flourishes.  Nevertheless, there 
are many -- even among the art-film crowd -- who will find this to be a 
colossal waste of time.  American/Iranian cultural differences are an 
issue, but the real obstacle is the pacing.  Those who fall under 
Kiarostami's spell will find themselves mesmerized.  Everyone else will 
get a nice nap. </P>
