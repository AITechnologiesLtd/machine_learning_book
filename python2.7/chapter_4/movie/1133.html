                       A film review by Thomas E. Billings
                        Copyright 1991 Thomas E. Billings</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
A one-legged Canadian soldier is sent to the Russian Arctic town of
Archangel in World War I.  There he gets involved in a love triangle
with the wife of his landlord and Veronkha, a beautiful married woman
who could pass as a twin for Iris, his (now deceased) former lover.  An
experimental film done in a style similar to silent films.  Although the
film has plenty of warped humor, the film is ultimately unsatisfying
because the plot is so circular and repetitive.</P>
<P>Canada, black-and-white, 1990, 90 minutes.
Director/Co-writer: Guy Maddin</P>
<P>     This is the latest film from Canada's Guy Maddin, who is perhaps
best known (in the U.S.) for the weird and wonderful film, TALES FROM
THE GIMLI HOSPITAL.  His newest film, ARCHANGEL, is another experimental
black-and-white film that, like GIMLI HOSPITAL, is very strange indeed.
The film is done in a style reminiscent of silent films (although the
film is not silent; it has plenty of spoken dialog).  A few scenes even
have the characteristic marks (something like stains) that are found in
old silent films that are in very bad condition.  However, given the
film's weirdness, and the fact that Maddin again creates a unique world
(the town of Archangel), I would say that characterizing the film as
purely a satire or parody of silent films is an incomplete description.</P>
<P>     The film centers on Lt. John Boles, a Canadian Army officer who
has one wooden leg, who is sent to the Russian Arctic town of Archangel
in World War I.  He is sent there to assist the Russians in their fight
against Bolsheviks and Huns.  However, his lover Iris recently died, and
he pines for her; she is the center of his thoughts.</P>
<P>     In Archangel he is billeted with a peasant family where both the
husband and wife are soldiers in the Russian Army.  Soon he meets
Veronkha, a beautiful married woman who is physically identical in
appearance to Boles' beloved former lover, Iris.  Needless to say, Boles
wants Veronkha very badly.  Veronkha's husband returns, but his memory
is damaged by mustard gas and he keeps forgetting he's married to
Veronkha (he's forgetful, and has a very vague life, as the film tells
us).  Meanwhile, Boles' landlady is falling in love with him.  The
result is a strange love triangle, with Boles pursuing the mysterious
Veronkha while his landlady longs for him....</P>
<P>     The film showcases Maddin's weird sense of humor.  When a boy
faints, he is revived by brushing his stomach with horsehair brushes (a
scene reminiscent of the one in GIMLI HOSPITAL where plague sufferers
were massaged with dead seagulls).  Early in the film the wife of the
landlord offers Boles a fancy wooden leg to replace his peg-leg; we are
told "it was her father's leg; I think she wants you to have it."
Later, in the trenches, an attack by Huns is preceded by a large number
of cute, white bunny rabbits (attack rabbits?) running into the
trenches.</P>
<P>     The film has a unique appearance and style.  It has some nicely
warped humor.  However, I found the film lacking on a number of points.
First, there wasn't enough humor in it to make it really appealing.
Second, the plot is iterative (as you will discover if you see the
film).  Certain scenes are reused many times.  Because of the cycling of
the plot, you might eventually lose interest in the film.  At times I
looked at my watch to see how much longer the film had to run.</P>
<P>     I should mention that the film has received very mixed reviews.
Two local papers gave it very good reviews.  However, word-of-mouth
advance reviews from various sources indicated that it was pretty bad.
(Some of the negative reviews came from fans of GIMLI HOSPITAL.)</P>
<P>     As for a recommendation on the film, I would begin by noting that
it is much too strange for a general audience.  If you are a fan of
silent films, you might find the film of interest for its technical
aspects, namely the imitation of silent film techniques.  If you are a
fan of GIMLI HOSPITAL, and you might like a film of similar character
(but with less humor), the film is worth considering (understanding that
perhaps you might not like it).  I found the film to be interesting for
its technical aspects and unique character, but it was not very
enjoyable (the plot cycling was just too repetitive).</P>
<P>Distribution: Now in limited theatrical release in the U.S.  In San
Francisco, it is currently (until 10/2) showing at the Red Vic.</P>
