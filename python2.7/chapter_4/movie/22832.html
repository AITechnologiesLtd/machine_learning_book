<P>Starring Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie, Clea DuVall, Whoopi Goldberg,
Vanessa Redgrave. Directed by James Mangold. Rated R.</P>
<P>I'm usually quite wary of resorting to clichés, but one is quite
appropriate in this case: Girl, Interrupted really is a One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest for the younger generation. It's almost uncanny. But
even as such, it works. Reversing the gender focus and updating the
general storyline, it's an entertaining experience, though it doesn't
pack the emotional wallop of the Milos Forman/Jack Nicholson
collaboration. Sometimes it's trite, sometimes it's preposterously
overblown, but the performances of Winona Ryder and major awards
contender Angelina Jolie pull you through it.</P>
<P>Ryder plays Susanna, a deeply troubled high school senior who is
admitted to Claymoore, an upscale mental institution after she downs a
bottle of aspirin followed by a bottle of vodka. Though she claims she
wasn't trying to commit suicide ("I had a headache!"), her parents
insist that she gets help. So off to Claymoore she goes, predictably
finding herself to be the only remotely "sane" one there.</P>
<P>Susanna forms a peculiar friendship with Lisa (Angelina Jolie), a
psycho with a soft side. They and some other girls sneak off to a
hidden room at night for some female bonding, as well as to the head
psychiatrist office to secretly look at their patient profiles. Lisa
furiously rebels against the system every chance she gets, from slyly
eluding having to swallow her pills to running off from the hospital.
Since Susanna took to Lisa quite well, she tags along with Lisa on some
of her escapades, getting herself into some trouble along the way.</P>
<P>The movie makes a big deal about its title in the beginning, but by the
end it's still unclear how Susanna is a "girl interrupted." But no
matter. This isn't a particularly profound meditation on the human
spirit confined in a mental institution anyway. The scenes in the
hospital generate audience sympathy in precisely the way you'd expect
them to. It's manipulative, yes, but it's also well made, turning a
potentially shameless sap-fest into enjoyable fluff.</P>
<P>The movie works well because Susanna herself is such an engaging
personality. When head nurse Whoopi Goldberg throws her into a bathtub
and tells her that she is letting her life waste away in that damn
hospital, we believe that she is telling the gospel truth. We see
Susanna as an impressionable young woman; putting up the facade of a
rebel but a faithful follower on the inside. Her doctors and parents
tell her that she is crazy, so she believes she must be. She never
makes an attempt to legitimately get herself out of a mental
institution. Instead, she blindly follows the clearly disturbed Lisa
down a path that could never in a million years lead to any good.</P>
<P>The clincher is the lead actresses. Though Ryder gives a great, subdued
performance as (I guess) the title character, she's clearly going to be
upstaged by co-star Jolie's much flashier turn as Ryder's spunky
friend. I agree that Jolie was spectacular; definitely more noticeable
than Winona's. Her performance jumps off the screen while Winona's
stays there humbly. It surprises me, however, how the lead actress,
without whom there would be no movie, turns in a terrific piece of
acting and yet gets ignored. It reminds me of Shakespeare in Love,
which was nominated for every award in every category except for lead
actor Joseph Fiennes who was the life and soul of the film.</P>
<P>Without being particularly deep or, god forbid, ponderous, Girl,
Interrupted engages the mind. Although its ultimate point never really
becomes clear, it's an interesting little movie while it lasts.</P>
