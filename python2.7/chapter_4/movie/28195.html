<P>   An 16-year old MTV fan asked me whether he'd be interested in
"Eureka." I told him that this was in Japanese with English
subtitles; that it moved slowly along, its director Shinji Aoyama
needing to make a specific point by lingering on the landscape;
that two of its characters who were about his age hardly spoke at
all; that it was in black-and-white-sepia until the final
moments; and that it went on for three hours and thirty-seven
minutes.  "I'm outta here," was his reply, not unexpected. And
yet, there's something mighty surprising about "Eureka."  Despite
what most people would consider a torpid pace with all the other
ways that the film is distinct from the Hollywood blockbuster,
the three-and-a half hours moves so swiftly that when the picture
ended I shook my watch in disbelief.  What this means is that at
least to some people, a speedy pace with witty dialogue and
plenty of comic breaks is not always needed.  "Eureka" is a mood-
creating picture, on in which the final redemption of its three
principal characters requires that most of the frames be bleak in
order to the make their ultimate inner peace as glowing as
fireworks on the fourth.</P>
<P>  Some might argue that this new film is really about the trauma
faced by the Japanese population after Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
which is not a bad guess at all, considering that director Aoyama
probably meant to be transcendent--to go beyond a simple
description of a trio of ordinary people shellshocked by a
hideously crowd, lunatic act.  </P>
<P>  The action takes place in a small community in southwest Japan,
the scene of a bus hijacking.  As driver Sawai Makoto (Yukusho
Koji, known from the popular movie "Shall We Dance") moves down
an empty road with his vehicle, his bus is boarded by a strange
character (Rijo Go), who without warning pulls out a pistol and
shoots at random, leaving only four survivors.  A brother-sister
couple who attend a middle school are stunned into
speechlessness, not surprising considering that their father was
dead and their mother had left them for good to get along by
themselves on insurance money.  When the driver is unable to
continue his career, he leaves his home and moves in with the
youngsters, pretty Kozue (Aoi Miyazaki) and sullen Naoki (Masaru
Miyazaki).  Later the three are joined by a 22-year-old cousin of
the youngsters now on college vacation, Akihiko (Yohichiroh
Saitoh), an arrogant sort who makes like Tiger Woods--practicing
his golf swings by the hour outside the rural home of the
children.</P>
<P>   Aoyama shows how the three traumatized individuals help each
other, the kids by taking in the startled bus driver, and the
driver by becoming a surrogate parent of the children.  </P>
<P>   The austere film, which seems to have been influenced by Alain
Resnais's "Hiroshima mon Amour," shows the audience what the
world looks like through the eyes of the survivors.  This is far
from the Japan that tourists flock to see.  The landscape is
dotted with cows, some people frolicking at a distance, the sea
and the sand. The driver seems to have passed up an opportunity
to forget his troubles when he an attractive woman unsuccessfully
flirts with him.  We are privy to some of the firings of the
weapon of the crazed gunman, and somehow a plot is shoehorned
into this still simple film about a serial killer on the loose,
Sawai being a prime suspect of the local detective.</P>
<P>   As "Eureka" moves along at its own pace, giving off striking
visuals which add to the storyline and to the sense of anxiety
and desperation of the characters, "Eureka," one of the grimmest
pictures to come out of any country in the past decade, succeeds
in involving its targeted audience in a thoughtful meditation on
life, on people who try to help one another to summon the courage
to go on despite their utter despondency.</P>
