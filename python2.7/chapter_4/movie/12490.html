<PRE>MARIE BAIE DES ANGES</PRE>
<PRE> Reviewed by Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 Sony Pictures Classics
 Director: Manual Pradal
 Writer: Manual Pradal
 Cast:Vahina Giocante, Frederic Malgras</PRE>
<P>   "Vahina Giocante is France's answer to Viagra.  If you see
her on the screen but don't go home with her, you will suffer
side effects, but they're temporary."  "So," said a friend, "Go
see 'Mary Bear'" (as he pronounces the title).  "It will get your
juices flowing."  This guy, who probably owns a respectable
supply of testosterone, understands two things: 1) the power
of movies to "get your juices flowing" and 2) the fact that
Vahina Giocante is the only reason to see this French
muddle.  You see, Manuel Pradal, who introduces this new
femme fatale to the cinema-loving world, probably thinks she's
the next Brigitte Bardot.  But while this fourteen-year-old who
shows little personality has substantial good looks, there's
nothing there that you won't find in any high school from the
island of Jersey to the streets of Jersey City.  If you will
indulge another comparison, Mr. Pradal is no Harmony
("Kids") Korine, whose eponymous tykes fill their merry-go-
roundelays with considerable humor in an equally plotless
picture.</P>
<P>   Marie (Vahina Giocante), who is nicknamed "Baie des
Anges" (the bay of angels) because she hangs around a body
of water in Nice which was once the home of a shark called
("anges de mer"), seems to have no home, or at least no
curfew.  She intends to make the most of this asset by
throwing herself hedonistically into a gang of American sailors
at a base where the Yanks appear alternately to be
rehearsing for "South Pacific" and for "On the Town," with one
naval hero doing a comic Gene Kelly shtick and others
crowding around the jail-bait in a choreographed, lusty
songfest.  When one of the young French wanderers gets
stabbed by a Yank whom he has just robbed and others in
the youth gang call for "war" against the U.S. base, Marie
doesn't give a fig.  She's having fun with people who talk
quite a bit less than Eric Rohmer's characters, her own
countrymen.</P>
<P>   But just as the Americans tire of her, she runs into a kid
fresh out of reform school, a good-looking, feral, devil-may-
care Orso (Frederic Milagras), who sneaks into swank homes
on the Riviera to take the jewels but is not against picking the
pockets of Americans who are swimming and are careless
enough to leave their francs, their watches and their clothes in
the nearby bushes.  Instantly attracted, she follows this petty
hoodlum around like a cocker pup whose owner is dangling a
sausage.  They drink, tussle, and make merry as only teens
know how to do, but this being a French movie that needs to
make like Truffaut, it has an ending which is not in the typical
Hollywood tradition.</P>
<P>   The Montpelier-born director, Manuel Pradal, intends this
first feature to be a fairy tale combining the natural beauty of
the Riviera with the sordid delinquencies of roving bands of
recent immigrants from Yugoslavia and Albania.  To ornament
the hoped-for fabulous aspect, he haphazardly throws in
scenes from a Grand Prix, from Carnaval and from other
Mediterranean elements.  He allegedly spent a year hunting
for young non-professionals, met 15,00 kids, and looked for
performers who could best express their resentment at being
outsiders. Though he deserves credit for casting young
people right out of juvenile prisons in France and Italy, the
title "Marie Baie des Anges" sounds better than the film looks. 
The picture jumps around too rapidly as if directed by a
channel surfer impatient for a machine-gun series of
gratifications, and its characters are too little developed to
garner our sympathy. Rated R.  Running time: 90 minutes.
