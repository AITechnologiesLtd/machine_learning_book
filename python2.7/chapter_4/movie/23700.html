<P>     Mark Piznarski's HERE ON EARTH does not take place here on Earth. It
takes place in a world of sun-dappled meadows, where golden backlighting
sets every moth into glorious relief. It takes place in a world where
lovers exchange sentiments the same shade of purple generally associated
with Barney the Dinosaur. It takes place in a world where class difference
is the ultimate impediment to happiness, where wealth is the ultimate
evil, where love means never having to say you're sorry. Welcome to the
world of HERE ON EARTH: Planet Melodrama.</P>
<P>     I'm not about to dismiss melodrama out of hand; if daytime drama,
professional wrestling and romance novels are any indication, people still
love conflicts writ large and lacking in moral shadings. Even TITANIC, for
all its spectacle, was essentially melodrama. But melodrama also has its
own rules, and HERE ON EARTH consistently violates them. The set-up finds
New England prep school student Kelley Morse (Chris Klein) celebrating his
impending graduation by heading into the nearby town to make trouble with
the locals. He ends up in a drag race with Jasper Arnold (Josh
Hartnett) which results in the destruction of the town diner. Kelley and
Jasper are then sentenced to spend the summer re-building the diner, which
offers plenty of time for mutual attraction to bloom between Kelley and
Jasper's longtime girlfriend Samantha Cavanaugh (Leelee Sobieski).</P>
<P>     There are, of course, impediments to the Kelley/Samantha coupling in
Michael Seitzman's script. Samantha's sister (Elaine Hendrix) has been
left with a child after a fling with a guy from the same prep school,
meaning the Cavanaughs are opposed. Kelley's father (Stuart Wilson) has
big plans for his son that don't include small town girls, meaning he's
opposed. And there's a twist of medical tragedy in store down the
line. The two leads therefore proceed to play their embarrassingly
scripted courtship for just the Hollywood concoction that it is. Klein
alternately pouts over his plight and reveals his longings for a more
fulfilling life; Sobieski plays the winsome heroine with Mary
Pickford-esque sidelong glances. Their relationship doesn't resemble
anything you would ever see between two actual human 18-year-olds, but
that's fine. When Sam silences Kelley's fumbled attempt at an apology with
an all-forgiving finger to the lips, you know you've been spending time in
a place where romanticism trumps reality.</P>
<P>     Still, there are little things that never feel right about this
world. It's a problem that the rejected boyfriend is from a
salt-of-the-earth farm family, meaning he can never play the Billy Zane
TITANIC role of scowling villain. In fact, you'd almost root for Jasper to
win out, if not for the fact that you may spend most of the film wanting
desperately to reach through the screen to comb his hair. The disapproving
Cavanaugh father (Bruce Greenwood) -- a sheriff, no less --  similarly
becomes a weeping softie. The one villain who's allowed to be a villain is
Kelley's industrialist dad, but we're cheated out of the one moment the
film seemed to have been building to: Kelley's pointed repudiation of the
life his father has planned for him. There's no moment of melodramatic
satisfaction from seeing the bad guy get a good telling-off. For a
melodrama, HERE ON EARTH seems awfully reluctant even to have a bad guy.</P>
<P>     I'm not sure whether I could have embraced even a fully melodramatic
HERE ON EARTH. Even in its basic premise, it's too awkward a melding of
adult tear-jerker and doe-eyed teen appeal romance. Still, there's no
question that melodrama can work when those involved are unashamed about
the fact that they're creating melodrama. That's why people cheer and boo
at wrestling matches; it's why people spend 20 years following their
favorite soap operas. That should have been why the bonding of Kelley and
Sam across opposite sides of the tracks would provide an emotionally
cathartic experience. Instead, it's a half-hearted effort in a genre where
heart is all that matters. The makers of HERE ON EARTH have made a visit
to Planet Melodrama. They just don't seem ready to live there.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 mellow dramas:  5.</PRE>
