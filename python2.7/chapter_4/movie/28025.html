<P>   Let's say a crisis erupted in parts of America.  The KKK
goes wild and in one town is determined to lynch every
African-American it can find.  White homeowners are warned
to turn in every Black man they can find and, of course, to
refuse to shelter any who ask for protection.  Those
homeowners who defy the rule will themselves be strung up.  A
breathless, confused, and frightened Black man turns up at
your doorstep asking you to hide him.  You have an available
room.  What would you do?</P>
<P>   A similar situation actually faced Europeans during the
period of World War II 1939-1945, a time that Nazi
stormtroopers and their collaborators moved to sweep towns
in occupied Europe clear of Jews.  Some good people took
the ultimate risk and hid those who implored them to do so.
(The people who did so at the risk of their lives are
celebrated in Israel to this day, called "Righteous Among the
Nations"). Others helped in a similar way but demanded
money in return.  The majority refused to do so, because they 
took part in the anti-Semitism that was Europe's affliction for 
centuries or because they simply feared for their lives.</P>
<P>   "Divided We Fall," a work first produced for Czech TV
by Jan Hrebejk based on Petr Jarchovsky's novel and
screenplay, is based on a true event that took place within
one family during the German occupation of 
Czechoslovakia.  What is astounding about this film is
that while it mines territory similar to that excavated by "The
Diary of Anne Frank," the two-hour production is peppered
with wit and humor during this most trying of times--waggery
that fits right into the story rather than being shoehorned in
as Roberto Benigni did with his fine but often forced "Life is
Beautiful."  Here is a film loaded with ironies, twists, and
surprises which can easily keep the audience heads spinning. 
The photography is superb, particularly for a TV-produced
work.  In one case, for example, cameraman Jan Malir points
his lens down on an evil doctor (who sterilized one hundred
gypsies) at such an angle that the man look like a forties
incarnation of Nosferatu. At several points, when humor takes
a back seat to rising tension, Malir resorts to slo-mo
photography to simulate a sudden, dramatic turn of events.</P>
<P>   The story centers on Josef (Boleslav Polivka) and his wife
Marie (Anna Siskova), a childless couple living in a small
Czechoslovakian town during the Nazi occupation of their
country.  When a Jewish neighbor whom they had always
liked, David Wiener (Csongor Kassai), suddenly shows up,
emaciated after having escaped from the Theressenstadt
concentration camp just before he was to be shipped to a
death camp in Poland, Josef (reluctantly) and Marie (with
more enthusiasm), give him shelter.  They stash him in a
small room Anne-Frank style, warning him not to leave the
place except for a few moments at night for fear that not only
David but also Josef, Marie, and in fact every resident of the
block would be shot.  </P>
<P>   The bulk of the movie's humor is evoked by a neighbor,
Horst (Jaroslav Dusek), whose pencil-thin mustache and
enthusiastic "heils" mark him as a collaborator of the
occupying Germans.  Since he is attracted to Josef's wife
Marie, he is a frequent, unannounced visitor to the table,
supplying the couple with food confiscated from the departed
Jews--a man who is slowly suspecting the big family secret. 
The boorish, motor-mouthed Horst cracks his knuckles
insistently, and in one instance attacks Marie when he
virtually forces her to take a ride with him.  But Horst will
supply one of the story's two great twists, the other occurring
when a novel solution is found to Marie's inability to bear
children.</P>
<P>   Brimming with tension, wit, humor, surprise, a taut plot, and
a stirring panorama of what happened when a small town is
within the power of a brutal subjugation, "Divided We Fall"--in
the expert hands of the director who had previous dished out
a box office success "Cosy Dens"--brings to vivid life the
tribulations and even the joys of normal people whose
loyalties are tested in abnormal times.  "Divided We Fall" is
the excellent choice of the Academy, among the five
nominees for best foreign-language movie of the year 2000.</P>
