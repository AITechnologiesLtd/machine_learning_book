<PRE>                               LAKE PLACID
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     It's crocodile season, opening the hunting period on an animal that
has been woefully underused in the horror movie litany to date.  But
unlike most horror/thriller pics, this one features a script by David E.
Kelley, best known as the creator of TV's `Ally McBeal.'</P>
<P>     So there's some promise here.  But does this monster movie rise
above recent crap like ANACONDA or JAWS 3-D?  A little.  It's better
than ANACONDA, anyway.</P>
<P>     High concept plot: Giantest crocodile on earth stalks Black Lake
(*not* Lake Placid) in Maine.  When a guy gets eaten, local fish and
game warden (Pullman) and New York paleontologist (Fonda) come to
investigate.  Croc chase ensues, with help from `eccentric millionaire
mythology professor' Platt and local yokel sheriff Gleeson.</P>
<P>     About the only thing that rescues LAKE PLACID from drecksville is
Kelley's flair for sarcastic dialogue, which punctuates just about every
line from the mouth of every character – and is most notably funny
coming from Betty White (local eccentric lake dweller).  But witty
repartee a five-star movie does not make.</P>
<P>     Coming in at about 80 minutes running time, witty repartee does
make for a passable way to spend an hour.  Too bad they couldn't have
just worked this plot into an episode of `Ally McBeal.'</P>
