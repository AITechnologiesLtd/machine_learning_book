<PRE>Mary & Tim (1996)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 54</PRE>
<P>"Mary & Tim" is a made-for-TV movie that is a remake
of 1979's "Tim".  Candice Bergen, the co-executive
producer who is also definitely the star, takes
Piper Laurie's role as the lonely middle-aged widow.
Little-known Thomas McCarthy takes Mel Gibson's
role as her much younger, gentle 'mentally challenged'
love interest.  Gibson's performance won him his
first major award, Best Actor from the Australian
Film Institute.  McCarthy's competent but bland
performance has not similarly jump-started his career.</P>
<P>The story has bookstore owner Mary (Bergen) spurning
match-making offers from her friends, perhaps out of
devotion to her long-dead husband.  She develops a
strong friendship for Tim (McCarthy), a mildly
retarded but good-natured handyman.  She teaches him
how to read, but he has things to teach her as well;
from an emotional point of view.</P>
<P>Inevitably, conflicts arise, and just in time to
keep this mild film from becoming a complete snoozer.
Tim's sister Justine (Kelli Williams) disapproves
of Bergen's growing friendship with Tim.  Tim's
father (the late Richard Kiley) disapproves of
Justine's attitude.  And Tim's mother (Louise Latham)
has run-in's with Justine's snobbish in-laws, who
consider Tim to be a family embarrassment.  But the
conflicts are quickly and predictably resolved,
with happy endings for nearly all concerned.</P>
<P>Some elements of the story don't completely work.
Bergen's character apparently has work-related
travel, that she never seems to embark on.  She
also seems to live quite well for a small-time
proprietor, even having a beach house.  Early
in the film, Tim is the victim of cruel practical
jokes played by his co-workers, who then promptly
vanish.</P>
<PRE>In the end, "Mary & Tim" is a competent but
lackluster romantic drama.</PRE>
