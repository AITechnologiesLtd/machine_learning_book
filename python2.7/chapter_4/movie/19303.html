<PRE>THE LAST DAYS (M).  
(The Shoah Foundation/Palace)
Documentary
Director: James Moll
Running time: 95 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Established by Steven Spielberg in 1994, the non-profit
Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation aims to record and
document the stories of Holocaust survivors as part of a lasting
record for future generations.  Spielberg and director James Moll have
already produced a couple of award winning tv documentaries.  This
remarkable and haunting Oscar winning documentary is the first feature
film from the Foundation, and depicts the unique Hungarian experience.</P>
<P>In 1945, even when it became obvious that the war was lost,
Hitler began a massive campaign to eradicate the Hungarian Jews.  He
directed enormous resources away from the Russian Front and assigned
them the task of moving the Jewish population from the ghettos to the
death camps, where they were systematically executed.  Culled from
intensive research and an exhaustive series of interviews, this
moving, powerful and ultimately inspirational documentary tells the
story of those horrific last days of the war through the eyes of five
survivors.</P>
<P>The five survivors have gone on to lead fulfilling lives,
devoted to humanitarian causes, and their inspirational stories
deserve to be heard.  Tom Lantos is now a US congressman; Renee
Firestone is a teacher who educates school children on the Holocaust;
artist Alice Lok Cahana uses art as a way of capturing her
experiences; while businessman Bill Basch and Irene Zisblatt continue
to share their experiences.  Although they come from different
backgrounds, they share stories of horror, sacrifice and extraordinary
courage in intimate and painfully personal terms for the camera.</P>
<P>Moll eschews traditional narration here, intercutting between
the various stories to dramatically reveal the full impact of their
horrific experiences.  Moll deliberately pushes a number of emotional
buttons throughout the film, arousing audience sympathy for his
subjects.  He is aided by a highly emotive background score from Oscar
winning composer Hans Zimmer.</P>
<P>As with the Oscar winning 1995 documentary Anne Frank
Remembered, director Moll has taken some of the survivors back to the
ruins of the camps to put their reminiscences into perspective.  Some
of them visibly break down on camera.  It may be uncomfortable viewing
for some, but it certainly makes for great drama.  In one scene, a
survivor actually confronts the Nazi doctor who performed experiments
on her sister in the camps.  But the most haunting and indelible
images come from the previously unseen footage of the painfully thin
and desiccated survivors of Dachau, taken by the US soldiers who
liberated the notorious camp in 1945.</P>
<P>This intelligently constructed documentary tries to capture
the grim extent of the unimaginable horror of these camps, but it is
also a wonderfully uplifting testament to the resilience of the human
spirit.  The Last Days is one of the most powerful and memorable
documentaries to hit our screens for some time.</P>
