<PRE>                               STEALING BEAUTY
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     STEALING BEAUTY is a *bad* movie.  Bernardo Bertolucci, the Academy
Award-winning director of 1987's THE LAST EMPEROR, is dead.  He has been
replaced with a hormonal and juvenile kid, masquerading as a filmmaker,
desperately trying to appeal to a cerebral audience yet maintaining enough
accessibility for the moviegoing public.</P>
<P>     STEALING BEAUTY fails miserably on both counts.</P>
<P>     The story is simple, after you put it together (Susan Minot's script
hides the real plot for a good hour).  Liv Tyler plays Lucy, a 19-year old
virginal American who travels to Italy to lounge around with old family
friends, talk about her dead poetess mother, and find her sexual awakening.
Or, HOW TO MAKE AN ITALIAN QUILT.  Lucy moves in with about a dozen bizarre
characters -- I have no idea who they are or why they are together except
that some of them new her mother -- some are English, some American, some
Italian -- they're just living in a big villa in Italy -- and Lucy
basically makes herself at home.  A lot of people have a lot of sex, and
Lucy watches or listens to a lot of this, when she isn't posing half-naked
for a statue being carved in her image.  As Jerry Seinfeld would say, "Who
*are* these people!?"</P>
<P>     On screen, this set of situations is as ridiculous as it looks on
paper.  The movie makes little or no sense, being at its heart a far-too
simplistic tale of a girl losing her virginity that is told in a far-too
roundabout way so as to make even this fact almost lost upon the viewer.</P>
<P>     The story is so simple, yet at the same time, Tyler's character is
wholly unbelievable as a real person.  Quite frankly, she is contradicted
in her actions with every progressive scene.  Whether this is Tyler's fault
or the script is anyone's guess.</P>
<P>     As for the titular BEAUTY, there ain't a whole lot of it around,
unless you consider scenes of Lucy drooling, Lucy looking at a bidet, Lucy
talking with her mouth full, Lucy singing off-key, and Lucy vomiting as
"beautiful."  *Stealing* beauty?  You can have it!  And you can keep Liv
Tyler as an actress altogether as far as I'm concerned.  (Am I the only one
who had the misfortune of seeing SILENT FALL?)</P>
<P>     In fact, the only real beauty in the film is Bertolucci's
ultra-stylish/ ultra-cutesy photography, which ultimately does little to
enhance the story.  (Note to the producers:  *please* cut out the
superimposition of Lucy's poetry on the screen while she looks wistfully
into the camera.)  And lest you think I'm too negative, the only decent
character in the film is the terminally ill Alex (Jeremy Irons).  I have no
idea *why* he was in the movie, but his scenes were the only watchable
ones, and he's the only likable character.</P>
<P>     Bertolucci tries to win us over by showing a lot of naked people, but
I certainly wasn't sucked in.  In fact, I was just shocked at the amount of
lechery and sluttiness that goes on that is essentially *endorsed* by the
film.</P>
<P>     My favorite line in the picture:  "What am I doing here with these
kids?"  I couldn't have said it better myself.</P>
