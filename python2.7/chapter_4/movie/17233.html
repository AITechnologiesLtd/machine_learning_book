<PRE>                             THE CORRUPTOR
                       A movie review by Joe Barlow
                          (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:  Chow Yun-Fat, Mark Wahlberg, Ric Young
DIRECTOR:  James Foley
WRITER:    Robert Pucci
RATED:     R
RELEASED:  1999</PRE>
<PRE>                 RATING: ***  (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        If Jackie Chan is the Beatles of modern action movies, Chow
Yun-Fat is the Rolling Stones: he doesn't want to hold your hand, he
wants
to kick your ass.  Already an action star in Hong Kong, Yun-Fat is
gradually
amassing a cult following in the States on the basis of recent films
like
"The Replacement Killers."  His fan base may soon swell, however: his
latest offering has the potential to make him a household name, just
as
"Rumble in the Bronx" did for Chan.</P>
<P>        James Foley's "The Corruptor" is mean, dark and ugly, but not
in a
bad way.  Drawing inspiration from the kinetic ballets of John Woo,
Foley
and his screenwriter, Robert Pucci, have created a story of intrigue
and
mystery in the streets of Chinatown, drawing as heavily from American
film
noir (there are shades of "Touch of Evil") as from the Hong Kong
gangster
genre.  Whereas most action films are content to throw car chases and
shootouts on the screen ad nasuem, Foley uses these items as building
blocks for an intricate plot involving betrayal, cover-ups, and
morality.</P>
<P>        Lt. Nick Chen (Yun-Fat) is in charge of an all-Asian precinct
in New
York's Chinatown region.  Chronically understaffed, the group has its
hands
so full with minor crimes that they never have time to investigate the
big
ones.  Capitulating to Chen's constant demands for more people, Chen
is
eventually given an additional officer: Daniel Wallace (Mark
Wahlberg), who,
in addition to being caucasian (and therefore unable to work
undercover), is
also inexperienced.  "He's worse than white: he's green!" explodes
Chen.</P>
<P>        Nonetheless, the detective agrees to give Wallace a chance,
and
although the two men dislike each other initially, they (surprise,
surprise)
eventually develop a mutual admiration which blossoms into friendship.
This
is one of the least satisfying aspects of "The Corruptor": its
reliance on the
cliched 'buddy cop' relationship, which seems to occur in every film
of this
kind.  It's been used as recently as last year's "Rush Hour," and is
handled
so tritely in "The Corruptor" that even the film itself seems bored
with it.</P>
<P>        Fortunately, the rest of the story is more daring.  Chen and
Wallace
are soon on the trail of a Chinatown crime lord, and the story becomes
as
much a mystery as an action movie.  Along the way they receive advice
and
information from the mysterious Henry Lee (Ric Young, who played Mao
Tse
Tung in 1995's "Nixon"), a businessman who seens to have his finger in
every pie in town, and who may or may not have the police force on his
payroll.  But loyalties change on the proverbial dime here, and the
villain's
true identity is kept safely hidden from the audience until the final
reel.
Be warned, however: the plot moves fast, and the movie expects you to
keep up.  Leave to go to the bathroom and you'll probably find
yourself
lost when you get back.</P>
<P>        The movie's title, "The Corruptor," is never explained: the
audience
is left to draw its own conclusion.  For me, Chinatown itself was the
corruptor: a society which hides its most devilish secrets in plain
sight, if
one knows merely knows where to look.</P>
