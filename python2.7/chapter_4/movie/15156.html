<P>The after school specials that ABC television has produced in the past
are a good stepping stone for producing 'The Mighty'.  ABC has nothing
to do with this film but the makers of this one certainly look like they
watched a lot of them.  An intelligent, if somewhat overly sentimental
film, 'The Mighty' has some good performances from two young actors who
steal the show away from their adult colleagues but some of the writing
is a cross between corn ball and a lot of the dialogue and situations
are flippant.</P>
<P>Set in Cincinnati, Ohio, 'The Mighty' is the story of two boys and their
dysfunctional lives and how they become the best of friends.  Elden
Henson is an over sized seventh grader who refers to himself as Godzilla
and draws stares from the other children at school because of his size
and his homely features.  He is taunted by a gang of punks at school who
tease and harass him about his past and his father's imprisonment.
Henson's father (James Gandolfini) killed his mother in a domestic
dispute and is now serving time.  Henson lives with his maternal
grandparents (Gena Rowlands and Harry Dean Stanton) who care deeply for
the boy.</P>
<P>Henson gets a tutor at school (Kieran Culkin), a boy who is highly
intelligent at his level in life but he suffers from a disease that eats
away at his body slowly and he is supported by arm braces when walking.
The two meet awkwardly when Henson is blamed for an act of cruelty
against Culkin in the school gymnasium and has to serve detention for
it.  Later, the two of them become close friends and Henson serves as
Culkin's protector and is brought out of his shy shell after being
inspired from the stories of brave knights brought on by the fact that
Culkin also likes to draw references to medieval times and the sanctity
of knights when describing a situation or involving himself in it.</P>
<P>'The Mighty' is a good family film that has a good marketing strategy by
casting Sharon Stone as Culkin's mother.  The ordinary style the film
projects of everyday life in the surroundings of ordinary people are
quite admirable.  What I really thought was strange was how all the
adult characters in the film were under written.  I think it's a rather
cheap marketing trick to have popular stars like Sharon Stone and
Gillian Anderson in very under written roles.  Anderson plays a drunken
white trash individual living with her equally trashy boyfriend (Meat
Loaf).  Her character only appears in a couple of key scenes but
Anderson is an excellent actress capable of the most impressive
diversity.</P>
<P>Elden Henson and Kieran Culkin are terrific young actors but Henson
clearly steals the show as his character goes through a transformation
of soul searching and his life is clearly influenced for the better at
the teachings of a tutor who has much to teach him and makes his life
wholesome and determined to stay on the right track.  A lesson much of
today's youth needs badly.  Parents are encouraged to take their
children to see this film for a memorable experience that they will
remember fondly as they grow older</P>
