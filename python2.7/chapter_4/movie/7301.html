                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Recently things have changed in the world of cinema. Not only are
independent films capturing top awards, but one of the most successful
auteurs around is named "Billy Bob".</P>
<P>Billy Bob Thornton wrote, directed and starred in the most disturbing
film in recent memory. The movie was made for an incredibly low $1
million, sold to Miramax for $10 million and is well on its way towards
earning many times that for the studio.</P>
<P>Thornton plays Karl Childers who returns home to his rural southern town
after spending 25 years in a "nervous hospital". At the age of 12,
Childers murdered his mother and her lover misunderstanding the
situation. Now he reckons that the doctor thinks he's cured. Un huh.</P>
<P>Gentle to a fault, the simple man is much more complicated than you
might expect. Making close friends with a young boy as a result of a
chance meeting, he is drawn to his new family. Young fatherless Frank
Wheatley (Lucas Black) likes the way Karl talks (un huh) and appreciates
the protection he offers from his mother Linda's (Natalie Canderday)
drunken abusive boyfriend Doyle (an all-too-convincing Dwight Yoakam).
Linda's best friend, the gay effeminate Vaughan is played convincingly
by, of all people, John Ritter.</P>
<P>Karl speaks with a halting yet confident Old Testament view of the
world. Guilty of not only the double murders, but also of involvement in
an even more unspeakable crime, he is searching for redemption for his
sins committed from a distorted innocence.</P>
<P>The portrayal of the redneck life that exists in this small town is both
frightening and compassionate. Country singer Yoakam's drunken rage is
particularly convincing as he instantly alternates from slapping around
Frank to begging forgiveness to threatening to kill Linda. Life in the
fast and desperate lane.</P>
<P>The ending is telegraphed from the beginning. The audience knows what is
going to happen and it is somewhat of a disappointment when it does. The
film isn't about a surprise finale, but rather the inescapable one. The
players are set into motion and no power on earth can stop what is to
be.</P>
<P>Billy Bob's Karl is a masterpiece of characterization. No Forest Gump,
the virtuous murderer is an intense image that you'll be seeing in your
mind's eye for a long time.</P>
