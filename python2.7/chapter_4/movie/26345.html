<P>The Tao of Steve (2000) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Donal Logue, Greer
Goodman, Kimo Wills, Ayelet Kaznelson, David Aaron Baker and Nina
Jaroslaw. Written by Duncan North with Grerr Goodman and Jenniphr
Goodman. Dirrected by Jenniphr Goodman.</P>
<P> "The Tao of Steve "is a different type of romantic comedy in as much as
its protagonist is a character for whom you have very little respect and
whom - at least at the outset - I considered an immature, selfish,
perpetual adolescent.</P>
<P> We first meet Dex (Donal Logue) at his 10-year college reunion. Once
big man on campus, Dex is now almost as large as a college campus. He
teaches kindergarten, is single and lives by a philosophy that is a
conglomeration of Eastern practices and self-created b.s.</P>
<P> Basically, Dex's philosophy is this: Be cool and indifferent around
women, don't chase them, let them chase you. Women love to be the
hunters. You will get more women into bed if you be the prey and let
them be the pursuer.</P>
<P> This is Dex's mantra. And it seems to work for the overweight,
out-of-shape, pot smoking, underachiever.
He is in the midst of an affair with Beth (Ayelet Kaznelson), the wife
of one of his closest friends, and he seems to have bedded half the
women in Santa Fe.</P>
<P> Then he meets up with Syd (Greer Goodman), a gorgeous young woman who
rides motorcycles and designs sets for the Santa Fe opera. Dex is
smitten, but fights valiantly to maintain his credo.</P>
<P> Yet at the same time Dex is falling in love with Syd, she appears
unimpressed by his charms. Later, we learn she has good reason for her
disdain.</P>
<PRE> And when Dex discovers her secret, he begins to repute all things
Steve.</PRE>
<P> In a sense, "The Tao of Steve," written by Duncan North with Greer
Goodman and Jenniphr Goodman, though based on North's life, is actually
a feminist fantasy in which the love of a good woman rehabilitates an
otherwise unredeemable semi-slacker.</P>
<P> However, the method in which the trio of screenwriters attain their
goal is intriguing to watch.</P>
<P> Dex's journey to a new understanding is interesting to observe. We see
his doubts, his defense mechanism and his final acceptance of the truth.</P>
<P> Logue has a very expressive face. It's part smirk, part hurt puppy with
a bit of false bravado tossed in for good measure. In public he feigns a
non-interest in Syd that is meant to keep her off balance. In private,
he pines for her.</P>
<P> Greer Goodman's Syd could undo any red-blooded man's mantra. She is
lovely, intelligent, self-sufficient; not afraid to speak her mind. She
uses wisecracks to cover the hurt Dex unknowingly caused years before
and, like Dex, she feigns an indifference on the subject of the pair
committing to a meaningful relationship.</P>
<P> Yet Syd is a vulnerable and caring woman, who cannot explain - even to
herself - her growing attraction to and affection for Dex.</P>
<P> "The Tao of Steve" is one of those independent movies that is a
90-minute character study. There is a lot of dialogue - much of it
witty, especially a poker-game sequence where Dex and his cronies
explain the coolness of Steves, i.e., McQueen, McGarrett (Hawaii 5-0)
and Austin (The Six Million Dollar Man).</P>
<P> Articulate and interesting movies such as this are rare. So, take a
chance. You may surprise yourself - and, guys, you may even see
something of yourself in "The Tao of Steve."</P>
