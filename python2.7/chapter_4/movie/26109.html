<P>My ability to relate to this film's protagonist has exponentially grown over
the past few months, as I too have recently been given the opportunity to
interview some of the stars whose films I end up reviewing for my website,
JoBlo's Movie Emporium (<A HREF="http://joblo.com/">http://joblo.com/</A>). It was, and continues to be,
quite strange to balance my task as a so-called "movie critic" and "movie
fan", since my love of movies ultimately surpasses my interest in film
criticism. Having said that, despite not being paid for my reviews or
reporting to any editor (I run my own site), I do take my task of writing
film reviews very seriously and always report the truth, no matter how nasty
(or great, as in this case!). I've always maintained this personal motto of
truth in my own life as well, and honestly believe that you ultimately do
your counterpart a favor by presenting them with the reality of the
situation, as you see it.</P>
<P>Now I'm sorry about this little personal preamble before my review, but I
think it's important for my readers to know where I'm coming from before
reading some of my criticisms, especially when it hits so close to home. In
the end, my goal is to remain the "joblo" of film criticism, and I hope that
I can continue to achieve that down-to-earth quality throughout all of my
reviews. Thanks for tuning in.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A precocious high school boy gets the opportunity to write an article about
an up-and-coming rock band, by joining them on the road for a few days.
Along the way, he struggles with the concept of reporting the truth vs his
friendship with the band members, and meets a pretty girl who also likes to
hang out with the band.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
An entertaining movie from top to bottom: an interesting story, superb
actors, rockin' soundtrack, well-developed characters, a strong message, a
nice love story, top-notch directing, humor, drama and two star-making turns
in Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson. Think about whatever it is that you
generally look for in a movie, and it will be in this one! A tribute to the
music that is rock 'n roll, this film lets you ride along with various
participants of the game, checking out the different sceneries along the
way. It gets behind the music, behind the fans, behind the band, behind
everything! It will definitely bring back a flood of memories to anyone who
actually lived through those times, and certainly connect to anyone else who
has ever been a major fan of any rock band or ever wanted to be a musician
(rock star) themselves. It's nice to see that in a year of film mediocrity,
a movie such as this can still come out and remind us all why we love movies
so much in the first place. This one takes you away for a couple of hours,
tells an interesting tale through several interesting characters, and
certifies its participation in the year-end Best Picture race by wrapping it
all up in a wonderful bouquet of entertainment. And despite a little bit of
over-romanticism of the music and the times, this film still manages to
present us with some great insight into the main players of the music biz
including the musicians themselves, the fans and the reporters who cover it
all.</P>
<P>And with a solid script as its base, this film takes off to another level
with the excellent performances shot forth by its lead actors. Billy Crudup
has been tooling around Hollywood for some time now, but this film will
undoubtedly catapult him off the charts. I hope that this film does to him,
what GLADIATOR did to Russell Crowe. And where the heck did Kate Hudson come
from? Brought into this world by actress Goldie Hawn, known primarily for
her pranky roles in easy comedies, Hudson takes on this lead role with the
edge of a pro, and the charisma of a newfound sensation. Two more
nominations for awards should be reserved for these two well-deserved
thespians at the year-end ceremonies. And tag those great roles on to
several other smaller showings, including Frances McDormand, perfect as the
over-protective mom, who can't help but look out for her children, Jason
Lee, coming into his own as the pseudo-Jim Morrison like lead singer, and
Philip Seymour Hoffman, who remarkably cannot seem to pick any bad roles in
movies, and you've got yourself an all-around rock-solid cast. This film
puts rock 'n roll on a pedestal but that's not all it does. It's really a
journey about finding yourself. Characters all floating around their lives,
unsure of who they are or what they stand for, until their day-to-day
interactions eventually help them find their true selves. See it for the
music, if you like. See it for the great performances or see it simply
because of its greater entertainment value, but the bottom line is that this
movie is one of the best films of the year, and no matter why you think you
want to see it, just see it, dammit! Who knows, maybe it'll help you "find
yourself", too.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Much like this film's protagonist, William Miller, writer/director Cameron
Crowe got his start as a rock journalist at the age of 15. In 1973, when he
was just 16, he joined the staff of "Rolling Stone" magazine, where he
eventually became an associate editor. While still in his teens, he managed
to profile many of the era's most influential artists, including Led
Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Joni Mitchell and Eric Clapton. In 1979,
Crowe, then 22, returned to high school to research a book, which resulted
in the best-selling novel FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, which was eventually
written into a screenplay by him, and directed into a movie with Amy
Heckerling at the helm.
Lester Bangs, the character portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman and the
editor of Creem magazine, was in actuality a very influential person in
Cameron's own life as well.
If you stay tuned to the entire film credits at the end of the movie, you
will note the unusual disclaimer about the character of Penny Lane actually
having been "based on an actual individual". Cameron Crowe appears to have
given us an insight into his own muse...
Other than Billy Crudup and Jason Lee, the two other members of the group
Stillwater are real-life musicians, Mark Kozelek and John Fedevich.
Billy Crudup made his feature film debut in 1996 in Barry Levinson's
SLEEPERS, starring Robert DeNiro and Brad Pitt, and was then featured in
Woody Allen's EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU.
Actor Patrick Fugit makes his motion picture debut in this picture. He was
chosen for the role of William Miller over hundreds of other young actors.
And pay close attention otherwise you might miss the unrecognizable
performance put forth by SNL cast member Jimmy Fallon, as the "new manager"
about 2/3 of the way through the movie.
A certain "William Mapother" plays the "bartender" role in this movie. Tom
Cruise's real name is Thomas Cruise Mapother. Not sure what his connection
to Tom is, but he is definitely related. Tom Cruise starred in Cameron
Crowe's last picture entitled JERRY MAGUIRE. They remain good friends.
Besides being a technical consultant on this movie, singer Peter Frampton
makes a cameo appearance as "Reg", the road manager for Humble Pie. He first
came to prominence as a member of the actual group Humble Pie.
This film was initially titled STILLWATER and SOMETHING REAL.</P>
