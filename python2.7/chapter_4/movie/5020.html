<P>One word review: innocuous. As a children's movie, JAMES AND THE GIANT
PEACH works. It shouldn't be either too frightening or too complex for
even little kids to enjoy. For adults, however, the film is too
simplistic. Some of the animation sequences are striking, but the
story and the characters don't really develop enough to be interesting
to adults.</P>
<P>I wanted to like this movie, but the problem was that my expectations
were probably a little high. I went in expecting a film more akin to
THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS. The only thing in JAMES AND THE GIANT
PEACH that is close to being as good as in NIGHTMARE is the
stop-motion animation, and that is not enough to carry the entire
movie, especially since only about 1/2 the film is done this way.</P>
<P>JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH is based on the children's story by
Roald Dahl. We see James, the progagonist, in both live-action and
animated versions. The story follows his escape from his nasty
aunts, Aunt Spiker (Joanna Lumley) and Aunt Sponge (Miriam Margolyes),
into a - what else - giant peach. He and his new friends - a bunch of
giant bugs - head off for New York. Their adventures on this journey
comprise the majority of the film.</P>
<P>The dark characterizations and satire that made NIGHTMARE work on an
adult level are not present in this film. Also, Randy Newman will
never be confused with Danny Elfman. The music in JAMES is too
schmaltzy, and doesn't have the edge that Elfman's score provided to
NIGHTMARE. The music is instantly forgettable, and adds nothing to the
film. On a positive note, Newman writes great elevator music.</P>
<P>All of Tim Burton's films have a darkness to them that makes them
interesting. This film lacks that vision, and seems to show us a
kinder, gentler Burton - a well-adjusted, but boring Burton.</P>
<P>The best sequence in the film takes place underwater, when events take
a dark turn. There's a character very reminiscent of Jack Skellington
(from NIGHTMARE), which is perhaps why I enjoyed this scene. If the
rest of the film had the same bite, it would have been a more
interesting experience.</P>
<P>My recommendation is to find a neighbor, baby sitter, or favorite aunt
to take the kiddies to see JAMES, while the adults stay home and watch
THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS on the VCR. Grade: C+.</P>
