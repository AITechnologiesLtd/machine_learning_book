Review:                Stir of Echoes</PRE>
<P>Starring:        Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Illeana Douglas, Zachary David Cope</P>
<PRE>Directed by:        David Koepp</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<P>It is astonishing that major motion picture studios often release movies
with similar plots within weeks of each other.  Last year there was Deep
Impact and Armageddon.  So, there is no question that Stir of Echoes will
be compared to the summer's surprise hit, Sixth Sense.  Both have similar
storylines involving children who see ghosts.  In Stir of Echoes the child
is Jake Witzky, played quite well by Zachary David Cope.  He is the only
one of the family who is aware of the presence of a young female ghost who
resides in the house with them, that is, until one night when his father,
Tom, (Bacon) is hypnotized at a party by Lisa (Douglas).    Her
post-hypnotic suggestion gives Tom powers to see and hear unusual glimpses
of things that surround him.  But he can't seem to figure out what is
happening.  And, his wife, Maggie, (Erbe) certainly isn't very
understanding.  Even at a cemetery, when she starts to notice that her son
has some weird abilities, she refuses to accept them.   </P>
<P>When Jake reminds his mother to take her purse with her, you remember
that she has a knife in it, and surely she will use it.  She does. The
major problem here is that we are aware what's happening before the cast
is.</P>
<P>Oh, yes, there is a mystery here.  Who is the ghost?  Why is she there? 
Well, it doesn't take long to know who she is and she's there because
she's probably been murdered.  But who did it?   There are some scary
moments and if that's what you like, you'll be entertained.  As for the
acting, Kevin Bacon's portrayal is uneven to say the least.  But now we
have another group of actors who can be included in `Six Degrees of Kevin
Bacon'.    </P>
<P>It's not a movie for young children to watch, but most teens will like
it. As for me, I might watch this again when it comes to free TV.  I give
it a C.</P>
