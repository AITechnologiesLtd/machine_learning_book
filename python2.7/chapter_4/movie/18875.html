<P>AN ALAN SMITHEE FILM: BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN
RATING: 1 / 10 --> So bad it hurts to watch</P>

<P>PLOT:
Token director Alan Smithee steals the only copy of his film "Trio" from the
studio, after they complete the "final cut" without him. He threatens to
burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Wow. I really can't remember the last time a movie sucked on so many levels!
The "comedy" in this film is pathetic, obvious and dated (OJ Simpson jokes
galore). The plot is uninteresting, boring and bad. The structure of the
film is annoying, repetitive and pretentious. The acting is pretty bad,
especially Jackie Chan, who can't act to save his life. The cameos are lame
and seem forced, and the ending blows chunks.</P>
<P>All in all, this movie believes itself to be a clever, humorous and edgy
look behind the closed doors of Hollywood, but comes across as a boring,
stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite. I love to see movies
about Hollywood shenanigans, but this one bites the big one. See it if you
like to watch really bad movies, otherwise skip it, because it will just
have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it. Luckily for us
all, this mess only lasts about 80 minutes, and Miramax honcho Harvey
Weinstein plays a lead-faced detective. By the way, is there any reason why
the studio or the producer couldn't have cut another version of the film by
the way of all the filmed stock that was left over? Who knows, who cares,
this "satire" sucks the bag.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Ironically, the original director of this film, Arthur Hiller, also
requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the DGA's Alan
Smithee moniker. This was after the film's production company, Cinergi
Pictures, preferred the cut made by producer/writer Joe Eszterhas to his.
The original script of this film included Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce
Willis.
Eszterhas announced through the media during post-production that Cinergi
Pictures didn't have the money to pay for soundtrack. He said that he would
finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it
to him. He received 9,200 CDs and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned
artists, listened to all that was sent (at least a couple of tracks from
each record) and compiled the soundtrack.
This film practically swept the "Razzie Awards" in 1999, given out to the
worst of all movie categories of the year, with no less than the "Worst
Picture" award, the "Worst Screenplay" (Joe Eszterhas), the "Worst
Supporting Actor" (Joe Eszterhas), the "Worst New Star" (Joe Eszterhas tied
with Jerry Springer) and the "Worst Original Song" ("I wanna be Mike Ovitz!"
as written by Joe Eszterhas).</P>
