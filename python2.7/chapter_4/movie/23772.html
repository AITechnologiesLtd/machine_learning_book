<PRE>IN SHORT: A Splendid 'toon.</PRE>
<P>For those out there that aren't long time readers, Cranky's a 'toonhead.
Loves animation. Almost wept when he had to sell a Gertie the Dinosaur
cel to support this site (didn't 'cuz I had two). In general, of the
post-Lion King run of animations from all the major studios, in general
I hate the second banana characters and really don't have much temper
for the multitude of songs that usually get in the way. Now that you're
up to speed . . .</P>
<P>What's a Cranky Critic to do when there are no second banana characters
-- to keep the kidlets giggling at the expense of grown up attentions --
to complain about? You know the type -- supporting monkeys or gargoyles
or whatever that usually infest toons from the other "D" studio but less
so from Dreamworks. You can blame or thank Jeffrey Katzenberg for this,
he did oversee The Lion King and many others at the Mouse, and is the
partner in charge of animation at Dreamworks SKG. The 'toons we've seen
from them in the last couple of years, Antz and The Prince of Egypt have
both aimed a wee bit higher, with more themes for the post thumb-sucking
set and less base comedy for the kidlets. Cranky likes that.</P>
<P>This year's offering, The Road To El Dorado, upgrades the second banana
type from support to lead and tries to duplicate the kind of chemistry
that made Hope & Crosby (or Lemmon & Matthau) a good screen team. El
Dorado tries and succeeds for the 'Works, delivering the most family
friendly of all their 'toon output. I know 'cuz I saw El Dorado twice.
Once with other critics, in preparation for StarTalk interviews with
lead voices Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh. Again, on the biggest
screen in New York, with an audience filled with media and their
kidlets. The kidlets were cackling at stuff that makes kidlets cackle
(don't ask me why) and the double entendre went right over their heads.
The big screen effect is discussed a couple of inches down.</P>
<P>Branagh and Kline voice Tulio and Miguel, two Spanish con artists who,
through every fault of their own, find themselves stowed away on the
conquistador Cortez' flagship on its journey to the New World. Cortez
(Jim Cummings) is searching for the legendary City of Gold called El
Dorado and has no tolerance for the stowaways (who just happen to have a
map to the city in their possession). The pair get washed overboard,
along with Cortez' stallion Altivo (who never speaks a word but is
"voiced" by the most expert and rightfully legendary Frank Welker) and
make it to the New World ahead of Cortez.</P>
<P>We're not telling how. It's funny. As is the pair's personal search for
El Dorado, which culminates in their finding it and being declared Gods
by the Chief Priest of the City, Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante), who is
fighting a political battle with the Chief (Edward James Olmos) for
control of the tribe. Their Protector and Partner in Crime is the lovely
and equally greedy Chel (Rosie Perez) who tries to guide these
nincompoops in the how-to of breaking the bank, and winds up breaking
Tulio's heart. The interplay between Kline and Branagh's characters is
incredibly funny and dead on target (Kline's the Crosby, btw) and both
are topped by the vocal effects of Welker. To say the horse is smarter
than both men put together is a fine compliment, indeed. As for the
animation . . .</P>
<P>Let's talk honestly for a second. We all know the biggest market for all
feature toons is the post bigscreen video market. All of you with
kidlets know that for a fact -- how many times have you parked your
kidlets in front of [title here] or, for that matter, been parked by
your kidlets in front of [title here]? As I wrote, I saw The Road To El
Dorado twice. First, on a screen that was probably the size of the
bigger theaters in your local multiplex, which was enjoyable though some
of the CGI/traditional animation mix onscreen seemed obvious. Second
time was on a monstrosity of a screen with no such apparent "problem".
While there have been notable improvements in the technology of
background CGI character movement and water animation ('toonheads'll
catch it all), the climax of the film, in which a boat with sail
unfurled and filling with air evades a stone pillar crashing into the
water behind it -- absolutely breathtaking.</P>
<P>If you've got a theater nearby with a screen the size of the side of a
house, that's where you want to see The Road To El Dorado.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Road To El Dorado, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$6.75</PRE>
<P>Elton John and Tim Rice pick up their partnership where they left off on
The Lion King, though they've just done Aida for Broadway as well. The
songs in this flick are meant to narrate which they do better than
entertain, though the opening title and the Kline/Branagh sung "It's
Tough To Be A God" two (of five) are real toe-tappers. The radio hit
runs during the end credits, so it doesn't count. Sorry.</P>
