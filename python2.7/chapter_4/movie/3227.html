<PRE>                              LITTLE BUDDHA
                       A film review by John Walker
                        Copyright 1995 John Walker</PRE>
<P>My form of "rating": I don't believe in reincarnation.  I regard the
     philosophical foundations of Buddhism to be a fascinating
     impossibility: the embrace of absolute self-contradiction.  But
     sitting in the theater watching LITTLE BUDDHA, I could easily see
     myself saying, "Well -- maybe...."</P>
<P>     That, I think, is a pretty high rating -- even if it's a really a
     measure of how loosely held my own beliefs are, or how susceptible
     I am to the world around me (in this case, the film).  Even if
     it's merely a measure of my ability to get into a flick, then
     LITTLE BUDDHA got me to look at the fantasy/reality interface.
     It's one thing to get into, to appreciate, someone's world, but
     when that means getting ready to swallow their world-view, that's
     something else.</P>
<P>In brief: On one level, LITTLE BUDDHA is a very simple story -- almost
     a children's story.  On another, it's a fascinating study of how a
     filmmaker like Bernardo Bertolucci can communicate the "givens" of
     another universe.</P>
<P>     Will you like it?  I don't know.  But I don't think the dividing
     line will be what people's *beliefs* are.  (Religion,
     spirituality, class, culture, etc.)  I think one dividing line
     will be how people regard the use of naive, simple materials to
     make important statements; another will be how they regard the
     presentation of ideas of that are ultimately from an alien
     universe.</P>
<PRE>                             <<The story>></PRE>
<P>    The story is simple: Tibetan monks in exile in Bhutan have signs
that they have found the reincarnation of an important lama.  The
possible reincarnation is nine-year-old Jesse Conrad (Alex
Wiesendanger).  They make contact with the boy's parents, Lisa (Bridget
Fonda) and Dean (Chris Isaak)--of no apparent religion.  Led by Lama
Norbu (Ying Ruocheng), they introduce themselves and a bit of Buddhism
to the Conrads.  Although the Conrads don't really believe any of it,
they agree to let Jesse go to Bhutan for further examination.  Dean,
going through personal and professional problems, goes with them as a
time to sort things out.</P>
<P>    Alongside this, we see the story in a book that Lama Norbu gives to
Jesse.  The book is LITTLE BUDDHA and tells the story of Prince
Siddharta (Keanu Reeves).  We see it in fragments alternating with
Jesse's story.  The Prince, born attended by miracles, grows to manhood
sheltered from pain, age, and death.  When he sees them, his compassion
moves him to begin his journey of enlightenment.  He will become the
Buddha, the Awakened, or Enlightened, One.</P>
<PRE>                            <<Two worlds>></PRE>
<P>    The screenplay of LITTLE BUDDHA is by Mark Peploe and Rudy
Wurlitzer--based on a story by director Bertolucci.  Bertolucci has
said that he wrote a story accessible to children because "In the West,
we are all children as far as Buddhism is concerned."</P>
<P>    Well, some of us may know "too much" about Buddhism.  What some of
us get in college is frequently the more philosophically "interesting":
Hinayana Buddhism, the lesser (smaller) vehicle in which only a select
few can ever ride.  Mahayana, the greater (larger) vehicle is one upon
which a society can be founded.  Westerners have frequently been
trapped between the two.  The one fits in with our individualism, with
following our own path--but therefore it can be just another
self-indulgent personal trip.  The other gives us a world, a universe
that is actually alive--but it's almost completely alien.</P>
<P>    One image in the film lasts only a few seconds, says a lot.  The
Dharma Center in Seattle is in an old building that might have been a
church.  Outside, it's a tacky turn-of-the-century or 1920s building
covered badly with aluminum siding.  Only the new porch announces
what's inside.  Inside, craftsmen are building something straight out
of the Himalayas.</P>
<P>    Another statement is the filming itself.  In Seattle, the world has
a blue cast to it, cold, grey, even in the sunlight.  In the Siddharta
story, things seem to have a gold hue.  Only modern-day Bhutan and
Nepal seemed to be what I expected as "normal" light.  (Cinematographer
Vittorio Storaro even used different film stocks for each.)</P>
<P>    Altogether, Bertolucci gives us the story in such a way that we
don't necessarily have to believe anything.  The newspapers have
reported similar suspected reincarnations in the West; this just gives
a story of what one case might have been like.  But the use of the
child's book lets Bertolucci give us the story of the Buddha as a
*given*.</P>
<P>    Again, we don't have to believe it.  But if we accept it as a child
might, it makes everything else hold together.  Our freedom of
interpretation permits LITTLE BUDDHA to be a sophisticated bit of
proselytizing.  By going through the process of acceptance in fantasy,
we may be more receptive in practice.</P>
<P>    It would be interesting to take a poll of audience reactions.  For
some, it would just look like "Buddhist cathedrals" and "Buddhist
bishops".  It would look oddly *familiar*.  Others are already shocked
by most of Roman Catholicism, High-Church Anglicanism, and Eastern
Orthodoxy.  Tibetan Buddhism would be even more alien.  Who would be
the more susceptible?  And what about whether or not they have a grasp
of basic Buddhist philosophy?</P>
<PRE>                            <<The acting>></PRE>
<P>    I gather lots of reviews have begun with references to BILL AND
TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE.  Bertolucci's casting Keanu Reeves as
Siddharta has raised a lot of eyebrows.  In fact, one complaint--that
Reeves's style can be "wooden"--is actually a requirement here.</P>
<P>    Reeves is called to play an *icon*, and everyone around him (all
Indian actors) similarly behave in a stylized way.  The Siddharta parts
are written that way.</P>
<P>    Take, for instance, when Siddharta first sees *old* men and asks
his sidekick Chana (Santosh Bangera) about them.</P>
<PRE>           Chana!  Chana!  Who are those men?
           They are men like the rest of us, my lord, who once sucked
       milk from their mother's breast.
           And why do they look like that?
           They are *old*, my lord.
           What do you mean, *old*?
           Old age destroys memory, beauty, and strength.  In the end,
       it happens to us all, my lord.</PRE>
<PRE>    Cinema verite' this ain't.</PRE>
<P>    In fact, I found only two wrong notes in Reeves's Siddharta, and
neither were strictly his.  In one, he cuts off his long hair with a
knife--and comes away perfectly coifed!  In another, his expression
is simply unconvincing--but so noticeable that I assume it was
Bertolucci's decision.</P>
<P>    In dealing with the Siddharta story, the stylization, and American
notions of what a beautiful babe should look like, may be sticking
points for some.  But otherwise, everyone's performance should be very
easy to take.  Well, perhaps Wiesendanger may strike some as a bit
*too* cute to take seriously.  But his performance is natural and
believable.  And he's able to give a hint of knowing or suspecting more
than we'd expect from a nine-year-old.  If you wish to believe it,
he'll let you think that maybe he *is* a reincarnation--without
undermining his essential nine-year-old-ness.</P>
<P>    Similarly, Isaak and Fonda are believable as not believing, yet not
closing out these odd visitors from another continent, another planet.</P>
<P>    Much of the weight for that rests on Ruocheng as Lama Norbu, and on
Sogyal Rinpoche as Kempo Tenzin, who makes the first contact here in
the States.  They project both earnestness and innocence, cheerfulness
and concern.  It's easy to think that Jesse's parents would be willing
to give them a chance.</P>
<PRE>                           <<What is this?>></PRE>
<PRE>    So where does that leave us?</PRE>
<P>    Is LITTLE BUDDHA a charming, updated fairy tale?  With a little
religious-history thrown in?  Or is it a simple presentation of a
world-view?  An introduction to another belief system?  Or is it subtle
evangelizing?</P>
<P>    Or is it an indication that Western artists and audiences, having
lost their own faith, will wander around trying on the faith of
strangers?  (Get a faith buzz without the work that real belief might
call for.  Or get a mental aspirin for the pain of a world without
meaning--but without turning it into an addiction, the way believers
do.  Both believers and anti-believers can feel superior.)</P>
<P>    Remember that those alternatives are *not* exclusive.  Fairy tales
can communicate important values.  Simple photographs can be
persuasive.  We can do all sort of things from all sorts of motives.</P>
<P>    The meaning and purpose of LITTLE BUDDHA will, I think, depend on
you.  Whatever Bertolucci's intention, he has created something--like
many children's tales--whose meaning depends on its hearers.</P>
