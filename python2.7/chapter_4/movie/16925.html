<P>How typical!  Joel Schumacher, who is currently destabilizing,
dismantling, and destroying the Batman franchise, has taken a different
turn, definitely not for the better with his latest effort (ha!)
entitled '8MM'.  Once again Schumacher (who should be relegated to
directing t.v. commercials and music videos) pushes us away instead, and
instead of drawing us in, he makes the fatal mistake of handing the
audience a movie that has too much literal meaning and not enough space
to let the audience digest one course before he crams another down our
throats.  It would have been a pleasant experience to see this film use
violence, pornography and psychotic lunatics as a metaphor for a missing
persons case that had great potential contained within its story line.
But instead, Schumacher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker ('Seven'), have
given us a movie that is as pleasant as going through a fun house with
actual booby traps rigged to literally kill you.</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage stars as a Pittsburgh private investigator who takes a case
offered to him by a wealthy widow and her business manager/attorney
(Anthony Heald).  The woman's husband was an industrial czar. Upon
settling his estate a strange 8MM film exists that was in his possession
that basically turns out to be a sadistic porno film where a young woman
is sexually tortured.  It's not certain that she was murdered which is
the thrust of the case: to find out if she was.  Cage finds the girl's
mother (Amy Morton) who wants answers in the disappearance of her
daughter.  His investigation of the case takes him to Los Angeles where
he meets a porno shop employee (Joaquin Phoenix) who helps Cage find
disruptive and illegal material in porno's sickest places where the
young woman in question may have been photographed.  Cage's search also
takes him to New York where he encounters some seedy and unspeakably
evil porno peddlers (James Gandolfini and Peter Stormare) who turn out
to be killers in disguise.</P>
<P>1989's 'Field of Dreams' is not a baseball film.  It used baseball as a
poetic metaphor to help a man "ease his pain" and redeem himself.  It's
probably the best film in the last decade to find a subject like
baseball, and use it as a metaphor to project the image of good story
telling.  '8MM' goes right for the jugular in all the wrong ways and
looks a lot like a big budget porno film and can be described as a movie
becoming a victim of its own subject matter that wallows in the excess
of its own seediness and has little room for the audience to react in
anything more than standard fashion.  The film at times just seems to be
going through the motions with wooden direction, a bland performance by
Cage and a clandestine feeling of being trapped --- already experienced
by 1995's 'Seven'.</P>
<P>Another problem with this film is its editing.  It's too static at times
and too quick at other times and comes across as very sloppy and
uneven.  Some of the situations and dialogue are also absurd.  We see
that Cage has a wife (Catherine Keener) and baby daughter and his wife
is constantly showing her faithful traits towards her husband and
supports him in his career and later in the film, she threatens to leave
him if his work continues to dominate his life.  A bit much after
showing her support earlier in the film.  It seems totally out of
character for her and a contradiction on the writer's part.</P>
<P>Big, brooding, and unpleasant without making you feel entertained are
just some ways to describe '8MM' which is artificial entertainment
disguised as a wannabe thriller that had audiences I saw with it, bolt
for the door upon the first closing credit on the screen.</P>
