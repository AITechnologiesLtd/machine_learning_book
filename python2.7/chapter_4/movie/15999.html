<P>POWWOW HIGHWAY (Warner Bros.)
Directed by Jonathan Wacks
 The acclaim heaped on the recent Native American drama "Smoke Signals" has
prompted a re-discovery of "Powwow Highway," director Jonathan Wacks'
similarly themed 1989 comedy-drama about a Northern Cheyenne odd couple who
leave their reservation and face myriad troubles in the white man's world.
Briefly -- and rather unceremoniously -- released by Warner Bros. before
being shuttled to video, "Powwow" has built up both a cult following and a
substantial critical reputation. It will play the Urban Institute for
Contemporary Arts this month.
 Next to "Smoke Signals" "Powwow" looks almost slick, with A Martinez (of
TV's "Santa Barbara" and "L.A. Law") as the disgruntled Buddy Redbow, who's
always on guard against outsiders trying to offer Indians a helping hand.
Faced with what sounds like a potentially lucrative land deal proposed by
some white businessmen, Redbow resists the offer and insists it will wind up
the way all transactions between Indians and whites do: "You get what you
want and we get the shaft," he snarls. He's intensely bitter about his
surroundings -- "This here ain't the American dream we're living," he says
of the reservation. "This here's the Third World" -- but he's also willing
to fight to hold on to what little he has.
 His best friend Philbert (Gary Farmer) is also his complete opposite, a
gentle giant who chooses to tap into Indian spirituality and tradition, even
though almost everyone else in his neighborhood ridicules him. When Redbow's
sister Bonnie (Joannelle Nadine Romero) and her kids are hauled into jail on
a trumped-up drug charge, Redbow and Philbert must make the trek from
Montana to New Mexico in a rickety 1964 Buick to bail her out. The journey
is peppered with comic run-ins with a tactless car-stereo salesman, vaguely
ethereal experiences which bewilder Redbow and confirm Philbert's beliefs
and a few mild clashes between the buddies over their very different
lifestyles. Redbow, for instance, shames Philbert for his diet of "sugar,
grease and beer" while smoking a joint.
 Martinez gives a solid, thoroughly credible performance, but it's Farmer
who makes the movie truly special; look at his half-amused/half-offended
reaction to a TV commercial featuring a car dealer wearing a feathered
headdress and whooping it up. He makes Philbert a truly memorable character.
Director Wacks has only made two films since "Powwow"; the
less-than-dazzling Ethan Hawke vehicle "Mystery Date" and a
straight-to-cable comedy called "Ed and His Dead Mother." Neither has a
fraction of the wit or insight of this uneven but engaging slice-of-life.
Unjustly neglected by audiences and by its distributor the first time
around, "Powwow" certainly deserves a second chance. James Sanford</P>
