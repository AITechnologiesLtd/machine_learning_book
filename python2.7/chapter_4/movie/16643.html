<P>
  The Horse Whisperer (1998) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Robert Redford,
Kristen Scott Thomas and Scarlett Johansson.</P>
<P>  All the action in The Horse Whisperer occurs within the first five
minutes of the film: A tragic accident while riding leaves one girl dead,
costs another her leg, and severely injures a prize horse.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, the movie still has about two hours and 40 minutes to
unspool, and most of that is taken up with picture-postcard scenery, and
long stretches where nothing happens. Nothing, that is, except for a man
staring at a horse, and the maimed and scarred equine staring back.</P>
<P> But this is no ordinary man. He's Tom Booker, the horse whisperer. He
doesn't help people with horse problems. As he says, he helps horses with
people problems. And this is no ordinary actor portraying this rugged
individualist. It's larger-than-life, face-as-craggy-as-a-Rocky Mountain
Robert Redford.</P>
<P> The Horse Whisperer is a pretty movie. Redford who also produces and
directs the movie, based on Nicholas Evans' best-seller, must have incurred
a fuel bill running into the hundreds of thousands. Every five minutes it
seems a sequence segues into an airborne view, celebrating the vast
landscape, the great outdoors, the beauty of nature.</P>
<P> OK, OK, Mr. Redford - environmentalist and conservationist - we get the
idea. Open ranges, crystal-clear water and unpolluted sky, good.</P>
<P> Only after so many snowy peaks and rolling hills, it becomes tedious and
repetitious.</P>
<P> Redford the director relies on Redford the superstar to carry the picture.
This is the first time Redford has directed himself and, unfortunately, he
just loves to watch himself do nothing. Of course, he looks sexy - even at
60 - standing in those worn jeans, cowboy hat perched atop his head, even
though he is beginning to show his age, especially in several of his many
close-ups</P>
<P> The script, adopted by Oscar-winner Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) and Richard
LaGravenese (The Bridges of Madison County) is rife with homespun homilies.
Redford's Booker talks like a cowboy Master Po from the old Kung Fu TV
series rather than a real person. He is a saint, overly patient, infinitely
understanding, and something of a bore. But so are most people who are too
good to be true.</P>
<P> Kristin Scott Thomas as Annie, the driven magazine editor who drags her
injured daughter and wounded horse to Booker's Montana ranch, is not a very
likable character. She is a bit snobbish, demanding, condescending and
thoughtless. Her transformation to all-American mom seems more plot device
than a natural evolution.</P>
<P> Only Scarlett Johansson as Grace, the young girl trying to regain her life
and spirit, is believable. She is petulant, sarcastic and rude - an
ordinary teen-ager. But her gradual transformation seems more believable.</P>
<P> The developing romance between Booker and Annie appears forced. No reason
is given for the supposed estrangement between Annie and her husband,
Robert (a wasted Sam Neill). What could attract this laid-back cowboy
philosopher to this self-absorbed woman is never made clear.</P>
<P> Redford is usually a no-frills director. Like fellow actor Clint Eastwood,
his style eschews fancy camera angles and tricks. But for The Horse
Whisperer, Redford has become self-indulgent. He takes his time telling his
story. And it seems he has adopted the attitude that since he's Robert
Redford, Icon, his audience will simply follow and accept this because he
has something important to say.</P>
<P> To paraphrase a legendary show biz adage: If you want to send a message,
call Western Union.</P>
<P> The Horse Whisperer, like Redford's A River Runs Through It, is a
beautiful movie to watch, thanks to cinematographer Robert Richardson. But
what the movie needs is a film editor who can stand up to its
star-director-producer and convince him to trim about 45 minutes.</P>
<P> Evans' original story, as well as Redford's pro-Earth campaign, are lost
in unending travelogue-like vistas of distant horizons, majestic mountain
peaks and dazzling sunsets.</P>
