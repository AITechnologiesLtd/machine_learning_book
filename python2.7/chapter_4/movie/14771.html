<PRE>                 IKINAI (Japanese with subtitles)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: All passengers on a tour bus but one share a deadly
secret.  A suicide pact will kill everybody on the bus.  The passengers
live out their last days alive.  Part comedy, part drama, we see the
lives of the passengers amusing themselves as they approach death.
Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Hiroshi Shimizu directs from a screenplay by Dankan who also acts
     in the film.
   - The sign says "The Sunshine Club Okinawa New Years Tour." Yet
     everybody sitting on the bus seems strangely somber.  Everybody is
     accounted for and the bus is about to leave when a young woman
     joins the group.  Her uncle has been committed to an asylum and
     she will use his ticket.  Reluctantly the tour manager lets her
     join the tour.  Eventually we find out that the passengers and
     tour manager all have a suicide pact to send the bus over a cliff
     so the families can collect on insurance.
   - In many ways similar to LAST NIGHT we get to know the various
     people on the bus by their stories, what they choose to do in
     their final hours, word games they play on the bus, etc.
   - The film starts as a comedy, laughing at the various foibles and
     personality traits of the passengers.  They argue over what to do
     about the woman who does not know about the suicide.  Each has to
     entertain at a dinner.  Some show tricks with chopsticks, one is
     obscene, etc.  But as the suicide hour draws close the film
     becomes more serious and desperate in tone.
   - Some satire of dull bus tours.  Also passenger-provided
     entertainment like on some tours I have been on.
   - One passenger's defense of the suicide plan: "All's well that ends
     hell."</P>
