<PRE>                                 THE PAPER
                      A        film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Ron Howard's        look at        the turbulent life
     on        a struggling middle-brow newspaper makes some pointed
     observations about        the newspaper business but spoils it all
     trying to tie too many loose ends in too silly a final act.
     Rating: low +1 (-4        to +4)</PRE>
<PRE>     Ron Howard's newest film about working-class heroes is a look at what
goes on        in and out of an incredibly chaotic newsroom.  Just as he previously
did with firefighters in BACKDRAFT, he is now showing how a good newspaper
staff, even on a sleezy-looking        tabloid, can make all the difference for a
city like New York.  It        is a story that        has been done several times, though
usually        based on the play "The Front Page" by Ben Hecht        and Charles
MacArthur.  THE        PAPER is not obviously based on        that play, but the fast-
paced style, newsroom pandemonium, comic touches, reporter looking to get
out of the job,        and even the basic plot        of the news scoop that could prevent
an injustice leave little doubt        where David and        Stephan        Koepp probably got
much of        their inspiration.</PRE>
<PRE>     The film covers 24        hours and 10 seconds in        the life of wise-cracking
tabloid        editor/reporter        Henry Hackett (played by Michael Keaton).  Even        in
Hackett's hectic life, this is a particularly frenetic day.  His very
pregnant wife (played by Marisa        Tomei) is an ex-reporter with numerous
nightmares of impending        empty and prosaic future.  Martha Hackett is pushing
her husband to take a better-paying and        more dependable        job.  Henry has        been
offered        the job        at the New York        Times (pronounced "Sentinel") where he will
be a soulless, neat professional instead of the        wild seat-of-the-pants
reporter he is used to being.  The Sentinel is the kind        of paper where you
worry less about scoops        and more about being "comprehensive."  Complicating
matters        is a local government functionary has a        vendetta against McDougal, a
brilliant and grungy co-reporter played        by Randy Quaid.         Throw into the        mix
Bernie White (Robert Duvall) a slightly        obnoxious chief        editor with family
problems, prostate cancer, and apparently smoking-related illnesses.  All
the subplots tie themselves up in ways ranging from unsurprising to highly
predictable, even if along the way they        take detours through total
absurdity.</PRE>
<PRE>     The pacing        of the story is        frenetic though        at the same time often
informative, if        somewhat cynical.  The meetings        to decide how much to
emphasize the various breaking stories are absolute gems.  One irritation I
had watching the film was I kept getting carbonation bubbles up        my nose.
Ron Howard kept        rubbing        it in Coca-Cola        and its        subsidiary products.
Calling        these product "placements" seems too gentle.  This was a product
barrage.  Howard may have been making up for product placement opportunities
missed when he made FAR        AND AWAY.</PRE>
<PRE>     It        would be nice to say that Keaton brought some sort of deep resonance
to his role.  One sort of expects that,        but the        character of Hackett really
does not need or give opportunity for good acting.  Hackett is an
inconsiderate wiseguy who loves        only his job and his wife, in pretty much
that order.  That doesn't give Keaton much latitude to act.  Marginally        more
room is        given to Duvall        as Bernie White.  Duvall gives him a few rough
Jewish characteristics,        but this will not be a well-remembered role for        him.
Glenn Close is bullish and officious.  Hers is certainly one of        the more
interesting characters but her role in a disastrously miscalculated scene
toward the end.         Marisa        Tomei has more drama than she has had in previous
roles but doers        not carry it well.</PRE>
<PRE>     THE PAPER has many        good moments but overall could have been a much
better movie.  I give it a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
<PRE>     [Note: the        play "The Front        Page" referred to above        has been filmed        four
times: THE FRONT PAGE (1931), HIS GIRL FRIDAY (1940), THE FRONT        PAGE (1974),
and SWITCHING CHANNELS (1988).]</PRE>
