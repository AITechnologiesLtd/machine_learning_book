<PRE>"The African Queen"</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by Heather Picker</PRE>
<P>     Directed by John Huston. Written by James Agee and John Huston. Starring
Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn, with Robert Morley and Peter Bull. 1951,
104 min., Not Rated.</P>
<P>     I'll be up front about this now, so that readers won't be surprised at the
lack of criticism in this review: John Huston's "The African Queen" is one of
my all-time favorite movies. The film begins with Reverend Samuel Sayer (Robert
Morley) and the members of his church singing. His sister, Rose (Katharine
Hepburn) is accompanying them, and eventually the crowd inside the church
disperses when a scuffle ensues outside between several villagers over a cigar
that Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) flicked to the ground.</P>
<P>     Sam and Rose go outside, where Charlie hands them their mail. He is
scruffy in appearance, a noticeable contrast to the clean-cut Sayers, who
invite him home for tea. Sam and Rose are embarrassed by but say nothing about
Charlie's growling stomach. As he readies himself to go back to his boat, The
African Queen, he mentions that a war has broken out. The siblings are
surprised and ask for details. Charlie says that the British and German are
fighting, as are many "little" countries, but he doesn't remember the
specifics.</P>
<P>     After he leaves, German soldiers invade the small African village that Sam
and Rose are living in as missionaries. They torch the dwellings of the
villagers and round them up, forcing them to march ahead to an uncertain
future. Sam and Rose are left behind, shaken. Charlie returns after awhile, and
Rose tells him that her brother has died. She gets her things together as
Charlie buries Sam, and the two set out for the African Queen, where they will
discuss their plans for escaping.</P>
<P>     The mismatched pair must learn, in spite of their disdain for one another,
to function as a team in order to survive, with comedic results. Hepburn and
Bogart have a humorous spark between them that really makes this film shine.
She is perfect as the straight-laced spinster, and he turns in an Academy Award
winning performance as the drunkard who becomes a hero with the help of a woman
who is his total opposite.</P>
<P>     In a somewhat unexpected plot twist, Rose, upon hearing that the Germans,
aboard the ship Louisa, may be nearby, eyes some of the materials on the
African Queen, and decides that Charlie and her are going to build a torpedo
with which they can destroy the Louisa. An incredulous Charlie agrees at first,
but later has second thoughts. As he realizes that she is more than a quaint
religious woman, and she realizes that he is more than a whiskey-swilling bum,
they become smitten with each other, sharing conversations about such things as
how they used to spend their Sunday afternoons (she would enjoy a nice, quiet
day, and he would usually be "sleeping one off").</P>
<P>     When Charlie gets cold feet about their plan and gets drunk, he wakes up
the next morning to find Rose pouring out the many bottles of gin he covets.
Although at first upset, we later see a revitalized man who is beginning to
regain control of his life and of the well being of himself and Rose. Facing
many obstacles, such as forces of nature and the ailing African Queen, they
finally catch some good luck and are once again hopeful.</P>
<P>     If you do not yet know how "The African Queen" ends, and do not wish to
find out, skip this and the next paragraph. After spotting the Louisa and
estimating how long it will be until they see it again, they begin preparing
the torpedo, and cleaning up the boat, as it will be representing the Royal
Navy. Before the Louisa passes and the plan can be put into motion, the African
Queen sinks and Charlie is captured by the Germans before finding Rose, who had
disappeared underwater.</P>
<P>     They are reunited on the Louisa, and are sentenced to execution by
hanging. Before they are killed, Charlie asks that they be married. The captain
agrees, and after they say "I do," the captain tells them, "I pronounce you man
and wife. Proceed with the execution." While the impromptu ceremony is
occurring, unbeknownst to everyone, the Louisa is nearing the mostly sunken
African Queen. As the nooses are slipped around Charlie and Rose's necks, the
Louisa brushes against the torpedo, and there is an explosion. The Louisa sinks
and the shocked duo bask in the ocean at their patriotic success.</P>
<P>     Filmed in Africa and London, "The African Queen" has wonderful
cinematography. The beauty of the African jungle and the harrowing experience
of the rapids are wonderfully brought to life. Huston is one of the greatest
directors in history, and this is yet another example of the best he had to
offer. Bogart gives the performance of his life, and Hepburn matches him stride
for stride. Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this film is that it
starred two incredible screen legends that were completely in control of their
talents, and they work surprisingly well together, bringing to the movie a
special comedic chemistry that is the fuel behind the romance of Charlie and
Rose. The script, which Huston co-wrote with John Agee, moves swiftly and sets
the perfect tone for the movie.  This isn't the typical WWI movie, but it has
the elements of a top-notch adventure flick, plus much more. </P>
<P>     Notes: Unfortunately, this film isn't available on DVD. It is priced at
under $10 on videotape, and also available in a more expensive collector's
edition.  Not rated, but suitable for family viewing.</P>
<P>    The Verdict: "The African Queen" is the quintessential adventure movie,
full of romance and laughs. Terrifically directed and acted, it is a true
classic that everyone should see at least once.</P>
