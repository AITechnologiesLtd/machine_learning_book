<PRE>                                 TITUS
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: TITUS is a production of TITUS
          ANDRONICUS, widely considered to be Shakespeare's
          worst play but here given a first class visual
          treatment nonetheless.  This is an over-the-top
          melodrama of horrible revenge.  HAMLET may be a
          better play, but its virtues are worn out from
          over-familiarity.  TITUS on the other hand is a lot
          of fun.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10), +3 (-4 to +4) SPOILER
          WARNING: I will reveal some plot points.  And how
          odd it is to have a Shakespeare play so little
          familiar that it needs spoiler warnings.</PRE>
<P>     Personally I think I need to see another production of HAMLET
about as much as I need to see another production of A CHRISTMAS CAROL.
Which is to say, not very much at all.  The same few number of
Shakespeare's plays seem to be done over and over.  The value of seeing
Shakespeare's good plays is somewhat compromised by their over-
familiarity.  There may be a lot more of interest in seeing one of his
minor plays that never get seen.  Of Shakespeare's 39 plays (the
current count) it seems only a handful regularly produced.  Most of the
rest are rarely seen.</P>
<P>     TITUS ANDRONICUS is nearly universally considered to be
Shakespeare's worst play.  It is a horror tale of revenge as a Roman
noble and a captured Goth Queen wreck terrible revenge on each other in
Imperial Rome.  Academician Harold Bloom suggest that the play was
never meant to be taken seriously and was Shakespeare's attempt to
lampoon the pre-Grand-Guignol blood and thunder plays popular in his
day.  Humble film reviewer Mark Leeper suggests that Bloom may have it
backwards.  It may well be an effort to demonstrate that even violent
horror plays of the time might be written with poetry, grace, and
magic.  Is it so different from Stanley Kubrick attempting a Stephen
King horror story complete with elevators flooded in torrents of blood?
TITUS is reminiscent of Peter Greenway doing what could be a TALES FROM
THE CRYPT episode in operatic style in THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE,
AND HER LOVER.  In any case TITUS ANDRONICUS is a play rarely performed
and though it will not be for all tastes it is one that for many of us
should be seen because it is a hoot.</P>
<P>     In ancient Rome soldier and noble Titus Andronicus (Anthony
Hopkins) returns from the wars with the Goths bringing with him the
Goth queen Tamora (Jessica Lange) and her three remaining sons.  Titus
has lost twenty-one sons and has only four left.  He orders the ritual
execution of one of Tamora's sons as a final act of vengeance.  Chance
makes Tamora the wife of the new emperor Saturninus and she will have
a gruesome revenge against Titus only to have him exact an even
sterner vengeance against him.</P>
<P>     Julie Taymor, who adapted THE LION KING for the live stage,
adapted the play and directed with a strange visual sense that cuts
across the centuries.  This is a world that combines the legions of
ancient Rome and vehicles and clothing of 1930s Fascist Italy.
Taymor's visual sense lies somewhere between Fellini's SATYRICON and
the Planet Mongo in a sort of filthy corruption of former splendor.  As
Tamora's vengeance seems to involve body part--heads, hands, tongues--
so too there are body parts sculpted in stone as a recurring theme in
many of the visuals.</P>
<P>     Taymor opens the film with the image of a child playing with toy
Roman soldiers.  The boy is dragged from a modern kitchen to a pavilion
in Rome where human-sized toy soldiers march in mechanized lock step.
This maybe suggesting that the play's violent plot is the product of a
child's imagination.  However she does fill the film with a generous
dose of surreal dream sequences and obscure symbolism that would leave
Shakespeare terminally confused.  I suppose she could claim that she is
not making the film for HIM.</P>
<P>     Jessica Lange, who started her career unable to fulfill even the
most demands of the damsel in distress in the 1976 KING KONG is now one
of the most talented American actresses and is now more than equal to
Shakespearean roles.  Her Tamora physically evokes the visage of a
Gorgon.  In spite of a few role choices of late that I believe even she
regrets, she is now back on track taking difficult roles and doing them
well.  Hopkins has the reputation, but he plays Titus entirely too
blandly, falling back on some Hannibal Lector mannerisms in the hope
they evoke chills.  For my money Lange stole the film from under him.
Alan Cumming is hardly memorable as Saturninus.  He may be remembered
as the pen-clicking Russian computer hacker from GOLDENEYE.  Aaron,
played here by Harry Lennix, is not very believable, due more to
Shakespeare's writing than his acting.  Like the Jew of Malta in
Marlowe's play he lives just to be evil.  Few people see themselves as
just living to cause trouble.</P>
<P>     TITUS is probably not going to be remembered as one of the great
Shakespeare films.  It is more a novelty, a Shakespearean horror tale.
How often do we get a TITUS CHAINSAW MASSACRE or a TWELFTH NIGHT OF THE
LIVING DEAD?  I give it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
