<PRE>(UK, 1997)</PRE>
<P>Seen with Byron and Micki on 26 November 1997 for $8.50 at the Angelika.</P>
<P>The transition from stage to screen is not always easy--for the audience,
and Martin Sherman's *Bent* is a good example. What is probably a
compelling stage performance has been transformed into an sometimes
interesting but ultimately tedious cinema experience. </P>
<P>*Bent* is the story of a Jewish gay man unlucky enough to be living in
Berlin in 1934. When Hitler's gay henchman Roehm and his gay coterie are
killed in one very bloody evening, it is open season on any man in
Deutschland who seems even slightly "bent." A lot of interesting
historical topics are touched upon in the movie, but it is destined to be
a gay film version of the Myth of Sisyphus. </P>
<P>Max (Clive Owen) is abruptly taken from the debauched world of
freewheeling Berlin on that bloody night in 1934, and comes to realize
that a certain dangerous amount of conformity is needed to survive the
long madness of the Nazi period, where simply having any sort of power is
a sick temptation. Those with the power wield it cruelly and arbitrarily.
Don't be fooled. History is the result of the choices of thousands and
millions of people trying to survive intact and sometimes, trying to get
more than they should. </P>
<P>Being involved with Max is dangerous, because he is a self-professed bad
person.  On the train to Dachau he is given a quick lesson in conformity
by Horst (Lothaire Bluteau). Max is determined to survive and eventually,
he is able, through his connections, to get Horst by his side as they
perform the useless duty of moving heavy blocks of stone from one end of a
pit to another.  This goes on for a small eternity while they talk and
talk and talk. The two men wind up loving each other. Only Horst is known
to be a "pervert" to the guards;  Max has chosen being a Jew. In the
universe of the movie, being gay is actually a bit worse in the Nazi view
than being Jewish. </P>
<P>The heart of *Bent* is the existential struggle of bread versus free will,
with the horrific backdrop of a concentration camp. Free will gets you
killed, and bread allows you to watch silently as you hammer your own self
down. </P>
<P>Visually, the film is interesting, as the two men are stripped of
individuality 
against the quarries and industrial sites used for concentration camp.</P>
<P>Despite good direction by Sean Matthias, it is very difficult to watch
what seems like an hour of two men talking away as they move stones back
and forth and back and forth. For those familiar with existential works,
you will fare better. My companions and I were very close to snoozing. The
film is very much the consciousness of these two men, one of whom has to
decide for himself what is ultimately more important--bread or free will. </P>
<P>A documentary of the book *The Pink Triangle* would probably be a better
source of information on this topic. Bent is far too much like Woman in
the Dunes and not enough like Bertolucci's *The Conformist.*</P>
<P>Also starring Brian Webber as Rudy, Ian McKellen as Uncle Freddie, and
Mick Jagger as "Greta." </P>
<P>Rated NC-17 for the lubricious depiction of simulated sex, men's buttocks,
and flaccid penises--like straight teenagers are flocking to this sort of
thing uncontrollably. A dense but worthy addition to the filmography
Channel Four Films (aka Film Four International / Channel 4 TV). </P>
