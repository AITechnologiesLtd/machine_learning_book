<P>     As I sat watching THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION, all I could think was:
here is a romantic comedy for everyone who applauded when MY BEST FRIEND'S
WEDDING ended with Julia Roberts dancing with Ruppert Everett.  I'm not
about to delve into the sociology or psychology of friendships between
women and gay male pals, but apparently it has achieved a status as part
of the urban American zeitgeist.  Still...a mainstream romantic comedy
about two people whose primary similarity is that they're both attracted
to men?</P>
<P>     I have to give THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION credit for tackling the
subject at all.  I just can't give it much credit for tackling the subject
effectively.  The principal characters are a pair of community-minded New
Yorkers, social worker Nina (Jennifer Aniston) and school teacher George
(Paul Rudd).  When George is dumped by his long-time boyfriend (Tim Daly),
he takes a room with Nina, a woman he met just days earlier at a party.
George's presence complicates Nina's relationship with her boyfriend Vince
(John Pankow), but things get even more complicated when Nina discovers
that she is pregnant.  Though she decides she wants to keep the baby, she
wants a better father than Vince for her child.  What she wants, she
decides, is George.</P>
<P>     Why she decides she wants George is another question entirely.  In
fact, why Nina wants anything is up for debate.  There is no character
there, nothing which gives us clue why she does what she does, or what it
is in her life that makes George such an appealing alternative to Vince.
The perky Aniston can do adorable and wistful in her sleep...and in this
case, she might as well have been.  Though Rudd fills in a few blanks with
a pleasant, appropriately confused performance -- working wonders with the
well-handled moment in which he actually responds to Nina's physical
attentions -- George and Nina's friendship never feels genuine.  It's just
a plot device set up so two attractive people can get into wacky and
farcical situations.</P>
<P>     Actually, not all that wacky and farcical at all, as it turns out.
Between Nicholas Hytner's direction and Wendy Wasserstein's script, THE
OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION almost never feels like a comedy.  The story is too
serious by half, full of tearful or angry confrontations and sincere
speeches, with the pregnancy sub-plot a terribly ill-advised decision.
Hytner, meanwhile, can never create a consistent comic rhythm to buoy the
narrative.  Every edit feels jarring, slamming scenes one into the other
rather than letting them build to humorous high points.  Wasserstein metes
out the giggles between the most gratuitous uses of the "f"-word since the
last romantic comedy starring a "Friends" cast member (KISSING A FOOL),
with everyone involved taking the issues too seriously to bother making
them funny.</P>
<P>     All the emphasis on longing and misapplied affection at least
provides a nice role for Nigel Hawthorne, who worked with Hytner on THE
MADNESS OF KING GEORGE.  As a theater critic unrequitedly infatuated with
a young actor (Amo Gulinello), Hawthorne actually makes the film's themes
momentarily poignant as he ponders facing his later years alone.  Yet even
that bright spot further emphasizes THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION as a
romantic comedy which isn't particularly romantic or particulalry comedic.
It's really a half-hearted stab at teasing the same social conventions
CHASING AMY successfully trampled all over.  After all the soul searching
about the lines between friendship, love and sex, it comes to the safe
conclusion that like likes like.  And just to be even safer, it throws a
bone to everyone who came to see the female protagonist dancing at a
wedding with her gay male pal.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 indirect OBJECTs:  4.</PRE>
