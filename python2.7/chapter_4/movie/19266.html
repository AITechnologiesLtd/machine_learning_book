<P>A review submitted to rec.arts.movies.reviews of CUBE (1997)</P>
<PRE>Review written by Mr Q. Z. Diablo</PRE>
<PRE>=====</PRE>
<P>Mr Diablo has been long awaiting the opening of CUBE in his home town. 
He had heard about it through an acquaintance and was struck by the
originality of its premise.  Having stumbled across the title in the
local paper, he saddled up and made his way to the local art-house
cinema in order to partake of an evening's entertainment.  Despite the
fact that aspects of the film have been lambasted by several critics, Mr
Diablo was enthusiastic about the venture so he picked his way through
the gloom of the sparsely populated theatre in order to place himself in
an optimal viewing position.</P>
<P>CUBE is a science fiction film with horror overtones regarding a group
of people who have been placed, for reasons that they do not understand,
in a gigantic structure consisting of a large number (over 17000, as the
cast repeatedly reminded Mr Diablo) of interlocking cubes.  Each cube
contains six doors leading to adjacent cubes, some of which are equipped
with deadly booby traps (the nature of one of which is illustrated in
the startlingly executed opening scene).  None of the protagonists
remember how they came to be inside the titular edifice and nor are they
aware of what purpose is served by their plight.  Given these facts, it
seems imminent that they find a way out, which they attempt to do.</P>
<P>The first thing that struck Mr Diablo about CUBE was how good the film
looked, considering the low budget.  He is saddened to note that
$1000000 is considered a minuscule budget in these overblown times but,
nonetheless, CUBE looks far more lavish than he would have possibly
expected for such a sum.  CUBE is director Vincenzo Natali's first
feature and Mr Diablo suggests that Mr Natali will be a talent to watch
over the next few years.  The set (and there is only really one of them)
is far and away the star of the show and, in itself, lends an air of
claustrophobic desperation to the proceedings.  Mr Diablo regards this
as a very good thing as he has gripes regarding several other aspects of
the film that would have sunk it were it not for its stylistic strengths.</P>
<P>Mr Diablo's first niggle concerns the dialogue.  The small audience was
observed to giggle disturbingly frequently as idiotic lines were
followed by even more idiotic speeches.  Maurice Dean Wint playing
Quentin, a policeman, is heard to claim that his job is to "see through
people - like X-rays" on a number of occasions.  It almost seems that
scriptwriters Natali, Andre Bijelic and Graeme Manson have imposed
dialogue on characters who have had no previous existence outside the
time span covered by the film.  One does not develop a character by
having an actor mouth said character's every waking thought - audiences
come to understand portrayals through observing a number of things about
an actor's performance; mannerisms, reactions to situations and so
forth.  It is simply not necessary to spell things out to even the
dimmest cinema goers.</P>
<P>The dialogue is so bad, in fact, that it had moments of making Mr Diablo
feel almost sorry for any cast expected to recite it.  Almost any cast,
anyway.  In most cases, the performances are almost amateurish. 
Attempts at terse exchanges between the macho Quentin and the neurotic
Holloway (a doctor, played by Nicky Guadagni) are laughably overwrought.
 While there is no stereotyping according to race, occupation or
anything similarly obvious, the characters represent certain personality
types and most of the cast seem incapable of instilling any kind of
nuance into their performances in order to expand their personas.  Mr
Wint and Ms Guadagni seem also to equate the depth of feeling that 
their characters have regarding certain ideas with a compulsion to
deliver their lines at extremely high volume.  After only a short while,
Mr Diablo found himself reflexively cringing every time these two
worthies even looked like they were going to engage in any kind of
discourse, no matter how brief.  On a more positive note, the
performance of Andrew Miller as the intellectually disabled Kazan is
very convincing, although Mr Diablo's lack of knowledge regarding autism
and related conditions prevents him from making a truly informed
judgement.  Nicole de Boer playes a nervous school student as blandly as
can be imagined and David Hewlett turns in an overwhelmingly uninspiring
performance as a former office worker with a dark secret.  Wayne
Robson's turn as the escape artist, Holloway, is fairly difficult to
evaluate owing to his early and gruesome demise.</P>
<P>Mr Diablo's last major problem with CUBE was the research put into key
aspects of the script.  A large component of the resolution of the film
is to do with prime numbers (don't ask Mr Diablo to explain this - he
feels that it is a major spoiler).  Leaven, the edgy but mathematically
gifted student, when asked whether a number (say, 765) is prime umms and
aahs almost interminably before announcing that the number is not prime.
 She then proceeds to factor it as 51 x 15.  This is all very well but
any student of mathematics, however indifferent (and Mr Diablo is a fair
measure more indifferent than most), knows that a number ending in 5 is
never prime because it may be divided by five.  Mr Diablo found very
quickly that he had to bite his tongue quite whenever any of the
"mathematical" sequences occurred in order to avoid annoying the
black-clad, trendy clientele of the cinema by yelling out the answers.</P>
<P>Despite its obvious flaws, CUBE is not a bad film.  Mr Diablo
particularly liked the baroque look of the sets (as alluded to before),
which brought to mind aspects of Clive Barker's overrated HELLRAISER and
its (superior) sequels.  Some of the CGI work is astounding, producing
spikes, razor-sharp wires and endless-seeming shafts descending into the
bowels of the earth completely convincingly.  The make-up effects, which
are extremely well executed, complement the sets and CGI perfectly in
contributing to the impression of hopeless panic at which Mr Natali
appears to be aiming.</P>
<P>Mr Diablo was also impressed with the camerawork which is, by and large,
both interesting and restrained.  Most shots of the action are taken
with the camera at an angle of 15 degrees or so above the performers,
giving the impression that they are somehow being observed by some
unknown entity.  The use of dissolves to denote the passage of time is
not nearly as irritating as Mr Diablo usually finds it but he would
prefer that film makers realised that it just looks plain hokey.</P>
<P>CUBE recalls, in concept, Satre's _No_Exit_ and could have been executed
more competently than it was.  Mr Diablo was grateful, however, to be
given a science fiction morsel that attempted to provoke thought in its
audience - a perfect panacea for the hype of EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM
MENACE, which he has not yet been brave enough to see, owing to the
legions of dweebs from all walks of life who still populate cinema
foyers, replete with plastic light sabres and clad from head to toe in
hessian potato sacks.  CUBE misfires in several important departments
but when it comes down to sheer, raw style it manages to attain a pretty
convincing thumbs up.  Let's hope that Mr Vincenzi can find some decent
writers and go on to produce bigger and better things in the next few
years - genre cinema is desperately in need of talents such as his.  In
the interim, Mr Diablo will hold off from viewing the first of the STAR
WARS prequels and consider the purchase of a VCR to ease the horror
drought that seems to be afflicting the filmgoing public at present.</P>
