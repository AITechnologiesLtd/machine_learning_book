<PRE>                               BOB ROBERTS
                       A film review by Jon Newman
                        Copyright 1992 Jon Newman</PRE>
<PRE>Directed and written by Tim Robbins</PRE>
<P>     BOB ROBERTS is a quirky, biting satire on modern politics and the
"new conservative" movement.  The title character, Bob Roberts (played
by Tim Robbins), is a stockbroker, folk singer and amateur fencer who
runs for a U.S. Senate seat from Pennsylvania.  He does not represent any
single political figure, but viewers will see in him traces of many
real personages, from Pat Robertson to (most definitely) Ross Perot.
The film sprays abuse in all directions, from pandering politicians to
poll-obsessed reporters to fanatic camp followers.  I recommend BOB
ROBERTS to anyone who intends to vote this November, and I recommend it
even more strongly to anyone who presently doesn't.</P>
<P>     The film presents itself as a mock-documentary, following in the
footsteps of THIS IS SPINAL TAP.  The rarely seen hand behind the
camera follows candidate Bob Roberts's campaign in his satellite-linked
tour bus, where Roberts' aides simultaneously manage his campaign and
his speculative stock dealings.  Interspersed with this campaign
commentary are interviews with Roberts' parents, fans, incumbent
campaign opponent, and a bedraggled heckler from the alternative press 
who badgers his campaign with accusations about alleged links with
Iran-Contra, misuse of government funds, and other half-paranoid,
half-believable claims.</P>
<P>     BOB ROBERTS also mixes in two not-quite-funny faux MTV music
videos, and a distressing amount of Roberts' smug folk music, such as
his paean to his scapegoats, lefty college students and lazy welfare
bums, "(They'll) Complain and  Complain and Complain."  This music was
written by David and Tim Robbins, and sung without much talent by Tim
Robbins.  A fellow film-goer told me that no soundtrack will be
released, to prevent the music from being (in the film-goer's words) 
"misused";  Robbins isn't much of a singer though, and I can't imagine
that anyone would want to hear this music ever again.</P>
<P>     Tim Robbins in the title role holds center stage, not surprising
given that he also wrote and directed BOB ROBERTS.  There are, however,
a number of big names in supporting roles and cameos.  Notable among
these is Alan Rickman as Roberts' shady power-behind-the-throne,
fighting congressional inquiries on Iran-Contra and the S&L bailout as 
he guides his protege's campaign.  James Spader and Susan Sarandon
appear as toadying TV news anchors, and Ray Wise (Leland Palmer in TWIN
PEAKS) plays one of Robert's campaign aides.</P>
<P>     Another presence to note is novelist and political pundit Gore
Vidal (!), who turns in an excellent and heartfelt performance as
Roberts' rival in the campaign.  Vidal is playing himself here, and
uses this platform as an opportunity to rail against the "real
government," the National Security Council.  As such, he does slip a
bit off the edge of believability for a character who is supposedly a 
30-year Senate incumbent.  Still, his performance certainly compares
favorably to William F. Burroughs' weakly acted cameo in DRUGSTORE
COWBOY.</P>
<P>     While I did enjoy and appreciate BOB ROBERTS, I must admit that
this film did, quite literally, make me sick.  The film's "documentary"
pretext implies hand-held-seeming camerawork, and the constant shaking
and weaving hold little appeal for the eye, still less for the inner
ear.  If you don't have your Dramamine handy, you might try sitting
toward the back of the theatre.</P>
