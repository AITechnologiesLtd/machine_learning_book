<PRE>A Video Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>The story of Joan of Arc is an often told one. Why? That was the question this
movie seemed to keep asking me. Why is this story such a popular one when it
deals with such heavy themes as Jesus, war, and death? During and after I
viewed The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc I got very depressed. The movie
was neither enjoyable nor good, even in the historical epic sense. I think it's
unfair that Columbia did not pass out doses of Prozac for free with each
rental. While this movie is forgettable in an instant, it would really help
someone heal emotionally from this awful film going experience.</P>
<P>Joan (Jovovich) is a peasant girl who has been very religious her entire life.
At a young age she begins to receive messages from whom she believes to be God.
Only later is his message clear. Convinced God wants her to save France from
England during the Hundred Years War, she proceeds to the capitol to ask
Charles the Dauphin (Malkovich) for an army. She tells him he will soon become
king of France. So Charles gives her an army that days later goes into battle
under her command. Soon after this battle, Charles does gets crowned king, and
doesn't need Joan anymore. She's later captured by the Burgundians who put her
to trial in England. Then a new character appears, The Conscience. Dustin
Hoffman is Joan's conscience who gets her convinced that her actions derive
from madness and not from God. If you paid any attention at all in history
class, you can guess how the movie ends.</P>
<P>I'm never a fan of really gritty films and this is certainly one of the them.
The violence is outrageously graphic and it's supposed to show the pain and
suffering of the armymen. The film succeeds brilliantly at this. The whole
movie is a violent, depressing, lifeless, and unoriginal lump. It is however
one that does a good job of not seeming that long. Modern war movies are
traditionally long and this is no exception. The time seemed to fly by until
the seventy minute mark when the film came to a grinding halt for me. Several
times I thought of turning it off, but I hanged onto the hope that it might get
a bit better. I was wrong. Laughably bad acting is present everywhere. Milla
Jovovich cannot act and is best suited to her smaller, more flashy, less line
role in Besson's great last film The Fifth Element. John Malkovich (Is he the
same actor who was so good as himself in Being John Malkovich?) is surprisingly
horrid, Faye Dunaway does nothing but show off medieval headpieces, and Dustin
Hoffman is unforgivable. While the text at the beginning of the film is way too
small to read on a television screen, if I could have read it, I wished it
would have said the following warning:</P>
<P>Save yourself! Save yourself! Jump off a building! Run your nails down a
blackboard! Hit yourself over the head with a frying pan! Do anything to get
away from this movie!</P>
<PRE>Yes, it really is that bad.</PRE>
