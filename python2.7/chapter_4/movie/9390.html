<PRE>The Matchmaker       
Review by Larry McGillicuddy
Copyright Larry McGillicuddy</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of 4)
Directed by Mark Joffe                                                    </PRE>
<PRE>Starring Janeane Garofalo, David O'Hara, Milo O'Shea, Jay O.
Sanders, Denis Leary, Saffron Burrows                       </PRE>
<P>Usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the    
romantic comedy is they will bring up names like Julia      
Roberts or Sandra Bullock. Others will mention Meg Ryan. But
for me, it's not even close. Janeane Garofalo is not only   
the queen of the romantic comedy, she is the best comic     
actress in hollywood right now. And it's a good thing she's 
starring in The Matchmaker, because without her presence the
movie would be bland, unfunny, and dull.                    </P>
<PRE>Garofalo stars as Marcy Tizard, a top aide to Boston senator
John McGlory, who is suffering in the polls. In an attempt  
to capture the Irish vote, he sends Marcy on a mission to a 
small Irish town called Ballinagra in search of other       
McGlory's that never moved to America. Unfortunately for    
Marcy, her visit coincides with the town's annual           
matchmaking festival.                                       </PRE>
<PRE>Things get off to a rocky start for Marcy though. She has no
hotel reservations (for no rational reason) and the tiny    
confined room (tired old cliche') she has to stay in has a  
visitor in her bathtub. His name is Sean, and Marcy finds   
him repugnant at first, so you can obviously tell where this
is headed.                                                  </PRE>
<P>The movie runs into a few roadblocks. For instance, the     
story is very thin. None of the characters (except the old  
local matchmaker) are nearly as interesting as Garofalo.    
Some of the characters, like the political aide played by   
Denis Leary, have wandered in from a completely different   
movie. I think the director realized this and decided to    
throw in numerous shots of the beautiful Irish scenery, and 
several close-ups of Garofalo's winning smile. The strange  
thing is that it works. Garofalo's charm and the irish      
scenery could carry the thinnest of stories, and it carries 
this one.</P>
