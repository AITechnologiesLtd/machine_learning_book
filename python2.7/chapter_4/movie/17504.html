<P>Something is horribly appropriate about THE MOD SQUAD. It lies in that
confusing teenage ground between mainstream and fringe, and its cynical
postmodern view is suddenly becoming very prevalent in adolescent
society. However, this tiny societal revolution is nothing more than a
hiccup in civilization's grand scale. And so the wave of trendiness
which Scott Silver's THE MOD SQUAD rides is too meaningless to make the
movie of any worth. </P>
<P>The plot is similarly meaningless for most of its 95-minute running
time, and for a movie of such brevity, that's never good. The fast-paced
feeling is nothing more than an illusion created by the liberal editing
job, and it should be clear that the plot is nothing more than a
skeleton to hang plot devices upon. The three writers involved (director
Silver as well as Stephen Kay and Katie Lanier) have little experience
between them, and that's frequently obvious: the comic relief would be
nothing without Giovanni Ribisi and the suspense is never
well-disguised. </P>
<P>Of course, with a little work, THE MOD SQUAD could've easily been
premiered on primetime television, and so there's not much room for
extended development. In quick succession, we're introduced to the
characters, their mission, and their problems which will lead to the
climactic final scene. Protagonists Julie (Claire Danes), Linc (Omar
Epps), and Pete (Ribisi) are teens on their way to jail who cut a deal
with police captain Adam Greer (Dennis Farina). The man says: help us
and we'll help you -- that is, our heroes hold a get-out-of-jail-for-now
card while they undercover-cop their way into Los Angeles' hottest
hangouts. All does not go as planned, however, when Greer ends up dead
with some drugs on his person, and everything stinks of setup. </P>
<P>It takes some time for all of this to stick in the heads of the
audience, and by the time it does, the end credits are only fifteen
minutes away. Most of the script is filled with trivial banter or
clichéd substance, and unfortunately it isn't until the last scene that
one of the characters takes a poke at the recycled plot. But when all is
said, the script never helped this movie. </P>
<P>So instead director Silver tries to put the burden of success on the
movie's trendy atmosphere: the 70's-revival dress, the racous big city
nightlife, and the ease with which one can get laid therein are all
themes which prevade the movie. Unfortunately the actors are too one-
dimensional (Danes and Epps) or over-the-top (Ribisi) to draw the
audience in, and thus THE MOD SQUAD will be dismissed as smoke and
mirrors. It is possible to have fun watching this movie, but that would
take far more brain power than the producers assumed the target audience
would have. </P>
