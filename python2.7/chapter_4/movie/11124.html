<PRE>THE WEDDING SINGER</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: ** (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>New Line / 1:35 / 1998 / PG-13 (sex humor, language, Adam Sandler)
Cast: Adam Sandler; Drew Barrymore; Christine Taylor; Allen Covert; Angela 
Featherstone; Matthew Glave; Alexis Arquette; Frank Sivero; Christina Pickles 
Director: Frank Coraci 
Screenplay: Tim Herlihy </P>
<P>After the not-so-fashionable '70s were affectionately captured on screen with 
"Boogie Nights" and "The Ice Storm," it was inevitable that someone would 
splash theaters with a loving tribute to the Me Decade. It's finally here -- 
only a few months after "Boogie" and "Ice" -- in the form of the 1985-set "The 
Wedding Singer," part pop culture nostalgia flick and part starring-vehicle 
for Adam Sandler, one of the more successful "Saturday Night Live" cast 
members to hit movie pay-dirt. As an Aqua Net-heavy flashback, "The Wedding 
Singer" is quite amusing, especially its Culture Club-laced soundtrack. But as 
a romantic comedy, what it really wants to be, the movie is pretty inept. </P>
<P>Sandler plays Robbie Hart, the wedding singer of the title. Robbie's got quite 
a charismatic knack for turning the worst occasions -- like the scathing toast 
of a liquored-up groom's brother (Steve Buscemi, in a great bit of novelty 
casting) in the film's opening segment -- into a good time for all. But his 
personal life crashes when he's left at the altar by his fiancee (Angela 
Featherstone), and the humiliation and melancholia turn him into every 
reception-goer's worst nightmare. The sole bright spot in his world appears to 
be pretty, perky waitress Julia (Drew Barrymore), but she's on her way to 
weding a cheating Don Johnson-wannabe named Glenn (Matthew Glave). Connect the 
dots to see what happens. </P>
<P>Some of what's wrong with "The Wedding Singer" can be summed up in two words: 
Adam Sandler. Sandler, whose 1994 "comedy" "Billy Madison" is still one of the 
decade's worst, just doesn't feel at home as the male lead in this type of 
film. In the recent "Happy Gilmore" (what, they didn't want to call this movie 
Robbie Hart?), he scored by playing a character with a raucous edge. It's 
fitting, then, that "The Wedding Singer" comes alive when it lets Sandler be 
his bawdy self, but when he waxes sentimental with Barrymore (which is most of 
the time), he oozes false earnestness -- it's as though he's secretly smirking 
at the material. Barrymore, though, is impossible to resist. She and Sandler 
do exhibit chemistry, and it's just enough to make you wish that he didn't 
seem so out of his element. </P>
<P>What's even worse is how calculated the movie is at getting Robbie and Julia 
together. Glenn is shown to be such an arrogant, pompous jerk that it's never 
clear what exactly drew Julia to him in the first place. In one scene, Glenn 
spills the beans to Robbie about his cavorting ways and how he'll continue 
them into his marriage. That's not the best idea, considering how Glenn later 
confesses that he was aware Robbie had his eye on Julia the whole time. What 
did he hope to accomplish there? Perhaps "The Wedding Singer" would have been 
more effective in its romantic storyline had it taken a cue from "My Best 
Friend's Wedding," a film where Julia Roberts wanted to break up her pal's 
impending nuptials, but found it increasingly hard because her competition was 
a really sweet person, deserving of his love in every way possible. No such 
luck here. </P>
<P>Yet while "The Wedding Singer" is wobbly and manipulative, it is consistently 
watchable. A handful of worthwhile elements standout among the haze, most 
notably Jon Lovitz's cameo as a flailing, vulgar stage performer ("Thank you 
... and that ain't no sock in my crotch!") and the running plethora of '80s 
memorabilia (a Rubick's Cube, a DeLorean and some pretty big hair make 
appearances). There's also Alexis Arquette's underused but dazzling supporting 
work as a member of Robbie's entourage who fancies himself a Boy George clone 
-- "Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?" is the only song he knows, and lemme tell 
you, it doesn't go over very well at Bar Mitzvahs. For a truly good 
retro-comedy, rent "Romy and Michele's High School Reunion," because, while 
survivable and even funny in patches, this "Wedding" is something old and not 
much new. </P>
