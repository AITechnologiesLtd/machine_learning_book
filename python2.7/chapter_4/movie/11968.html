<PRE>.                               LOST IN SPACE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Would that I had listened to my gut instead of LOST IN SPACE's flashy
trailer, one of the best promos for a bad movie (see also: ALIEN
RESURRECTION, CLIFFHANGER) to come along in some time.</P>
<P>     Where to start with my complaints about this movie?  Is it Akiva
Goldsman's ridiculous script that attempts to jam as many
fall-down-howlingly-bad lines into two hours as possible?  Actors who
obviously realize its qualities and spend the time mumbling them beneath
their breath?  A ridiculous little creature called Blorp (or Gleep, or
whatever) that's sole purpose seems to be to sell toys?  The time travel
plot that takes over half-way through the film and makes you long for the
oh-so-logical days of THE TERMINATOR and BACK TO THE FUTURE?  Hell, "The
Jetsons" paints a more realistic view of the future...</P>
<P>     LOST IN SPACE may ultimately be an insult to your intelligence, but it
is an insult with good special effects.  But with a big-screen TV, you can
wait for that HBO premiere instead of shelling out cash for this loser.</P>
<PRE>     LOST IN SPACE?  I wish they'd never found it....</PRE>
