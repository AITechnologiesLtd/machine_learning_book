<PRE>"Head Over Heels"</PRE>
<P>Pretty young art restorer Amanda Pierce (Monica Potter) has a great job at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but you can't say the same about her luck
with men. When she catches her latest beau in the, shall we say, arms of
another woman, a model, she rushes away and gets an apartment with, guess
what? A bunch of models in "Head Over Heels."</P>
<P>In a word, "Head Over Heels" is a mess. It starts off as offbeat romantic
comedy with Amanda, a fish out of water, thrown into a pool of sharks - her
four super-model roomies, Jade (Shalom Harlow), Roxana (Ivana Milicevic),
Candi (Sarah O'Hare) and Holly (Tomiko Fraser). Their goal is to get Amanda
a man and things progress along this path, inanely, for a while. Then,
suddenly, the flick morphs into a rip-off (the filmmakers probably call it
an homage) to Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window" and a totally silly murder
mystery</P>
<P>When Amanda agrees to pay her roommates $500 a month for what is
essentially a closet, she enters a world where men constantly hang around
the front door of the gorgeous models in hopes of getting the privilege to
lavish money upon one or all of the beautiful girls. As the five become
friends, the models take on the quest to find Amanda the man of her dreams.
This turns into a Peeping Tomasina tale when Amanda and her new buddies spy
on a handsome neighbor, Jim Winston (Freddie Prinz, Jr.), a fashion
executive.</P>
<P>Amanda gets weak in the knees when she finally meets Jim, a condition that
only used to happen when she saw a great painting, and true love appears
imminent. At this point, about 45 minutes into "Head Over Heels," things
twist and Amanda believes she has witnessed murder of a woman, by her new
amour, in his shade-drawn apartment. The police, of course, find nothing
and treat Amanda and her girlfriends as a bunch of bubbleheads.</P>
<P>The girls decide to forego the police and begin their own investigation of
events. But, this becomes muddled and confused as we lose sight of "the
murder." Is Amanda looking to solve the supposed killing or is she looking
for Mr. Right? It becomes apparent that it's the latter she wants as she
romances and beds Jim, even though she's remains uncertain about his
possible murderous streak. Everything is tied up, sloppily, by the film's
end.</P>
<P>The story for this mess is attributed to a committee of writers - John J.
Strauss, Ed Decter, David Kidd and Ron Burch - and it shows in its
scattershot approach to the disjointed material. Two of the hacks
responsible for "Head Over Heals." Strauss and Decter, hale from "There's
Something About Mary," and bathroom humor pervades the whole tale, mostly
in poor taste. Wee-wee and toilet jokes, number two gags, (unfulfilled) T&A
humor and other childish whimsy are used to replace a real story with what
amounts to 90 minutes of unfunny vignettes.</P>
<P>The press material for "Head Over Heals" touts Freddie Prinz, Jr., as the
Cary Grant of the new millennium. He's not. In fact, this extraordinarily
bland actor never seems to change from one film to the next. His
expressions vary between blank and uncomfortable and he gives no life to
his dual character here. Oh, yeah, you find out in the second half that Jim
Winston is really Bob Smoots, an FBI agent working under cover on some case
or another. But, who really cares?</P>
<P>Top-billed Monica Potter is pretty enough as Amanda, but her good looks
can't help her get around the horrible script. The camera loves to look at
her in close up and she suffers the least, of the two leads, from the bad
writing. The four women playing Amanda's roommates are a quartet of
good-looking ladies, providing ample eye candy. Sarah O'Hare comes across
best, in a slapstick way, as Aussie model Candi. Her ongoing cosmetic
surgeries and comic pratfalls rep some of the few laugh throughout the
film. The rest of the cast should have stayed home.</P>
<P>Director Mark Walters shoulders the burden of responsibility for "Head Over
Heals" and should do what he can to place blame elsewhere. There is little,
if any, chemistry from the behind the camera crew to help lift the leaden
script from its doldrums.</P>
<P>Mein Gott in Himmel! What were these people thinking?! If a friend suggests
going to see "Head Over Heels," run away as fast as you can and get
yourself a new friend. The fact that it's in focus is one of the few
reasons this doesn't get the absolute lowest grade. Still, I give it a D-
and that's pretty bad.</P>
