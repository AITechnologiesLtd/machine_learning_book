                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Written and directed by David Mamet
Starring William H. Macy and Debra Eisenstadt</P>
<P>     In one of his books on how to write, David Mamet says to enter
scenes late and leave them early.  That seems to be the guiding
principle of his new film, OLEANNA.  At best it seems to be sections of
a story, lacking a beginning act.  It would be easy to dismiss this
project as a one-set two-person avant garde play that underwent an
unsuccessful canning process.  As a work of cinema, it is uncinematic.
Even as a play, the delivery of the lines is flat and emotionless.
Once the viewer leaves behind his notions of what a film or play should
be, however, the film becomes a challenging experience.</P>
<P>     OLEANNA is Mamet's most unconventional work for the screen.  His
trademark street language has been replaced by an at first annoying
semantic game.  This game is a metaphor for the academic process.  The
meaning of words and groups of words in and out of context are
questioned and requestioned by the two actors.  Replacing his freehand
use of the f-word in films like HOMICIDE is the constant use of "what
does that mean?"  With a lot of academic sounding words it seems
nothing is said, or even happens.  For an extended excruciating opening
act, the two characters, a professor and a failing student seem to
miscommunicate completely.  The subject of the class isn't even clearly
defined.  This scene is the key incident of the film.  What happened in
the non-event becomes the basis for minute discussion in the following
scenes.</P>
<P>     It is here that the flatness of the acting is brilliant.  The
audience can hear the words, but must  find their own meaning for
them.  The two characters are such blanks, with no developed past, that
whole personalities must be projected onto them.  Outside factors like
unseen student and academic groups must be completely imagined.  This
leaves the bare elements of the story open to various interpretations,
so much so that each viewer practically sees a different film.</P>
<P>     Mamet's project was to create a play, now a film, about sexual
harassment in the academic setting.  He wanted to raise questions but
not give answers.  It is impossible to leave this film without thinking
that one of the characters was greatly wronged, but the choice of which
one  is up to the individual viewer.</P>
<P>     The film has various flaws to be sure.  The student seems to
increase greatly in both intellect and self confidence from one scene
to the next, although a viewer could invent various reasons for this.
The professor, an intelligent man, seems to miss several crucial
phrases of dialogue.  In this manner the characters miss out on being
real people and instead become didactic homunculi for academic
patriarchy and feminist political correctness.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the subject is more immediate and successful as a play.
Nonetheless the film is, if not enjoyable, at least provocative.  It is
a welcome tonic to the multi-million dollar escapist films that have
recently had so little to say.</P>
