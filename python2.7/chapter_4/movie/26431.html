<P>After a mostly dismal summer of films made mostly by pea brains for 
culture dropouts, "Nurse Betty" (NB from now on) may (or not) be 
marking a turning. It premiered in May at the Cannes Festival where 
it won the Best Screenplay award. I saw it then and I just saw it 
again. It's a good film that goes in several directions while keeping 
its focus on the charming, next-door pretty Renee Zellweger as Betty.</P>
<P>Sixty-one years after The Wizard of Oz,  Betty, like Dorothy, is a 
Kansan who leaves her state.  Although she is not transported to a 
magic land, like Dorothy, she does so in a way. She takes off in a 
Buick, drives to La-la Land in Southern California to make her dream 
come true.  In Fair Oaks, Kansas, Betty is a a sweet, apple-cheeked, 
apple-cheeked, liked-by-all waitress in a diner. She is married to 
scummy used-car dealer Del who does not appreciate her, cheats on 
her, acts like a creep and is into very shady non-car deals.</P>
<P>Betty in a TVholic who watches (and tapes) incessantly the soaper "A 
Reason to Love." In it actor George McCord plays the super-duper 
surgeon and heartthrob Dr.David Ravell. Betty is so much in love with 
the Doctor character that he has become real to her. She's rushes 
home to catch the next episode. A closed door separates her from the 
living room in which Del brings two men, older Charlie and the 
latter's young sidekick Wesley. They have an underworld deal with Del 
who has done something unkosher. He gets killed, but in an unexpected 
(and yes, funny) way that involves his badmouthing native Americans, 
the guests' shocked reaction at Del's racism, a scalping and a gun.</P>
<P>Putting it briefly, Betty plunges deeper and deeper into the fiction 
of the soap opera, reinvents herself as a nurse who some years ago 
had an affair with Dr. David, and travels to L.A. to meet the good 
Doctor. She keeps quoting to herself a kind of mantra, David's  words 
in the soap: " I know there's someone special out there for me." 
Betty is convinced that she is that someone</P>
<P>The film rapidly becomes a road movie (and quite an original one) in 
which encounters flirt with the picaresque. Charlie and Welsley are 
after her. In the process, the older man idealizes her while Wesley 
thinks his companion is crazy.  Eventually, and through the wildest 
(and funniest) of developments, Betty is taken for a nurse, meets 
actor George McCord, persists in calling him David and in acting as 
though she were really David's old flame and a real nurse. George 
gets convinced that it is all a game on her part in order to be hired 
in the soaper.</P>
<P>The whole thing is delightful, humorous, funny and comical, yet also 
sad, and quite (but clearly) complicated in its para-Pirandellesque 
way. There's no way to assign the movie to a genre, and in this it 
will recall  many of the non-genre or mixed-genre films of the French 
New Wave, which also echo here through several references to movies.</P>
<P>It is a fantasy which is impossible, even incoherent, but lack of 
logic is no defect in this case. It is a black comedy. It is a hybrid 
--in a positive way, as in hybrid roses. It is literally a crazy 
quilt whose components are handled with legerdemain, like a shell 
game. It works-- except  for the tacked on happy ending--a minor 
weakness.</P>
<P>In this screwball (but non-slapsticky) picture whose heroine has a 
screw loose there is no message. To say that it is a comic critique 
of television's sway on people would be an oversimplification.  The 
closest I can come to finding kissin' cousins in today's American 
cinema is the Coen Brothers, with touches of Tarantino.</P>
<P>The acting by all is bull's eye class, except for the annoying, 
two-expressions playing by Chris Rock and his repeated ad nauseam 
f-word and s-word. His only virtue is that he underlines, by 
contrast, the excellent, even subtle performance by Morgan Freeman 
whose character gets increasingly complex.</P>
