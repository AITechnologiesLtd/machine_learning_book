<P>     You want multi-national?  How's this:  a Chinese actress playing a 
Japanese girl in a French film based on an Italian opera?  At first 
glance, it might seem odd, but, as brought to the screen by first time 
feature director Frederic Mitterrand, this adaptation of Giacomo 
Puccini's classic MADAME BUTTERFLY is electric.</P>
<P>     Film and theater occasionally mesh well; the same is rarely true of 
film and opera.  Exceptions like Ingmar Bergman's THE MAGIC FLUTE are 
rare.  The grand, overstated gestures of the operatic stage do not 
translate well to the cinema, and even the best sound systems cannot 
reproduce the transcendent fidelity of a live performance.  For the most 
part, therefore, motion picture versions of operas are doomed to exist 
primarily as pale, two-dimensional shadows of a more vibrant medium.</P>
<P>     For his 1995 version of Puccini's MADAME BUTTERFLY, Mitterrand (a 
documentary film maker and the nephew of the late French President) 
chose not to film a live performance or craft a set-bound, stagy motion 
picture.  Instead, he took his cast and crew on location (although the 
soundtrack was previously recorded), giving this rendition of the opera 
a decidedly cinematic quality.  There's a lot of camera movement, and 
cinematographer Philippe Welt was given the opportunity to compose a 
variety of complex shots and make frequent use of close-ups.  Because 
the lens catches each nuance of every performance, acting is as much a 
requirement as strong, clear singing.  From a technical standpoint, 
Mitterrand's approach to MADAME BUTTERFLY is unique, and it reaps 
dramatic dividends.  </P>
<P>     For those unfamiliar with the story, Puccini's opera tells of a 
self-absorbed American naval officer named Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton 
(Richard Troxell) who buys a 15-year old geisha, Cio-Cio-San (a.k.a. 
"Butterfly", played by Ying Huang), to be his "Japanese wife."  From the 
beginning, Pinkerton has no intention of staying with Butterfly -- he is 
using her as temporary amusement, a bit of comfort in a foreign port.  
Despite being enchanted by her quiet, fragile beauty, he has no 
difficulty abandoning her at the first opportunity.  Yet, even after 
Pinkerton has been gone for three years, Butterfly awaits his return, 
confident that he loves her as much as she loves him.</P>
<P>     MADAME BUTTERFLY takes place in 1904 Japan, just outside of 
Nagasaki, and, in addition to being a tragedy of Shakespearean 
proportions, it also illustrates a common international perception of 
American imperialist attitudes.  Pinkerton isn't just a good-looking, 
dislikable cad who abandons a young, innocent girl -- he's a 
personification of his entire nation, and, by extension, Butterfly 
represents the countries that the United States ruthlessly plundered and 
left behind.  Using archival footage of the time, Mitterrand brings home 
the film's historical perspective far better than a live version ever 
could.</P>
<P>     I'm not an opera buff or a voice critic, but it seems that Richard 
Troxell's vocal performance is somewhat weak, especially in comparison 
with that of Shanghai Conservatory soprano Ying Huang, whose arias are 
clear and vibrant.  Acting-wise, both leads are solid.  The likes of 
Ning Liang (as Butterfly's maid, Suzuki), Richard Cowan (as the American 
consul, Sharpless), and Jing-Ma Fan (as Goro, the oily marriage broker 
responsible for Butterfly and Pinkerton's union) do justice to the 
supporting roles.</P>
<P>     For the most part, operas, like musicals, improve with familiarity.  
It's difficult to guess how Puccini die-hards will react to some of 
Mitterrand's creative choices, but the result is a cinematic success -- 
powerful, passionate, and memorable.  It's a daring way for the director 
to present MADAME BUTTERFLY, and I applaud his decision to try something 
different than a traditional, formal version.  I have little doubt that 
my appreciation will increase with successive viewings.</P>
