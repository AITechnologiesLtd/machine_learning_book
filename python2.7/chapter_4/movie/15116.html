"Pleasantville" - A Nice Place to Visit
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>If you ever tune into Nick at Nite, it's likely that you'll catch some
of those classic tv programs that espoused nothing but heaps of family
values.  Remember Make Room for Daddy or the Brady Bunch or Leave It
To Beaver?  Everything was 'swell', a heated romance consisted of
holding hands, and it never rained.  Pleasantville is another one of
those shows featuring a never-ending string of smiles and homemade
chocolate chip cookies.  </P>
<P>Dave is a big fan of this program and has uncanny knowledge of each
and every episode.  He is especially excited to learn that they'll be
having a Pleasantville marathon on tv.  But this doesn't bode well
with Jen, his outgoing and popular sister.  An important date is
coming over and she wants to watch MTV.  As they struggle for the
remote, a surge of energy transports them into Pleasantville in a
Twilight Zone-esque sort of way.   Now, they become Bud and Mary Sue,
children in an all-too-perfect family and residents of an
all-too-perfect community.  What's worse, their whole world is in
black and white.</P>
<P>They have little choice but to go along with what's happening while
they try to figure a way out of this unlikely universe.  Bud/Dave
wants to play it safe and uses his knowledge of the episodes to make
sure that the universe remains unchanged.  When the Captain of his
basketball team asks him a question, for example, he knows what will
happen in the near future because he's already seen the episode. 
However, Mary Sue/Jen completely dislikes the sterile environment. 
"We are stuck in Nerdville," she exclaims and intends to inject a
little life into the community.   However, by stirring things up,
things begin to change.  She introduces into this staid environment
shocking, never-before experienced feelings such as passion.  Bud/Dave
objects at first but then realizes that this newfound sense of
existence begins to start a revolution.  A renaissance of emotion is
underway.  For those that feel it, their lives are rewarded with color
and an imagination that they could never before attain.  However, some
want to keep Pleasantville in its original state. This situation
divides the community, and it is up to Bud/Dave to find a way for the
townsfolk to embrace this new transformation.</P>
<P>"Pleasantville" has many niceties.  At its core, it's a movie about
discovery.  It's sends out a nice message that promotes freedom to
explore and to take risks.  It paces itself well as the local citizens
slowly make their own discoveries of who they are and of the world
around them.  It's not a movie that will make you kick your heels when
you walk out of the theatre.  But the movie does live up to its name.</P>
