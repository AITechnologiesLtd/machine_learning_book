                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     RHYTHM THIEF, is a real art film-lover's movie.  Shot in grainy, 16 
mm black-and-white, it's more notable for inventive cinematography and 
quirky dialogue than for solid plotting or characterization.  Matthew 
Harrison, directing his second feature (his first, SPARE ME -- a 
"bowling thriller" -- was seen only by friends and family), emphasizes 
technique over narrative.  The story is trite and the characters aren't 
engaging, but Harrison's efforts can be appreciated on a technical 
level.  He got a lot out of an 11-day shooting schedule and an $11,000 
production budget. </P>
<P>     The main character is Simon, a New York City streetside dealer of 
bootlegged cassette tapes.  Despite the attempts of Fuller, a local 
hanger-on, to hook up with him, Simon manages to maintain a one man 
business.  Then, one day, the bodyguards of an all-girl band, 1-900-
BOXX, catch Simon taping a concert, track him down, and beat him 
senseless.  This begins a cat-and-mouse game that leads Simon into 
progressively more dangerous territory, even as he tries to sort out his 
confused sex life and keep his cat well-fed. </P>
<P>     RHYTHM THIEF features some really innovative shots.  When Simon is 
being beaten up, we see the attack from his point-of-view.  On another 
occasion, a scene is photographed from the perspective of a cat's 
litterbox.  Somehow, I don't think that has ever been done before.  
However, there's only so much to be gleaned from this sort of movie.  
It's really just a slice-of-life motion picture sheathed in a cinema 
verite style -- of passing interest, but not the sort of thing I would 
recommend going out of the way for, and certainly *not* if you don't 
have a predilection for art-house fare. </P>
