<PRE>Bats
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Lou Diamond Phillips; Dina Meyer; Bob Gunton; Leon & Carlos Jacob</P>
<P>Bats isn't exactly a bad horror film if you approach it with the attitude
that you aren't about to see anything that you probably haven't already seen
a hundred times in other horror films. It has the usual predictable plot and
dialogue, along with the usual population of stupid horror film characters.
About the only real scary part of this movie is the direction. How Louis
Morneau ever got a job directing a film, even a b-grade one like this, is
completely beyond my scope of comprehension. At first, the direction was
what I would generously call interesting, but it rapidly deteriorated into
something worthy of the result that you would get if you gave a monkey on
speed a handycam and set him loose. Every time there was some sort of
dramatic bat attack -- which was fairly frequent if you haven't already
gleaned that from the title -- the camera wold go off on some sort of hyped
up whirlwind trip of herky jerky motion. Now the more forgiving in the
audience may have attributed this fact to trying to cut down on the gore.
Maybe it could even be called a compensation for poor special effects, but I
tend to think it was just a director who didn't have a clue what the hell he
was doing.</P>
<P>As for the story, it revolves around a small Texas town that is having a
little bat problem. Apparently, genetically enhanced flying foxes have
escaped from a nearby research lab and have infected the entire bat
population in the area. We never quite get an explanation how the other bats
are infected or how this infection seems to increase them to double their
original size. But you really didn't expect a horror film to make perfect
sense did you? It comes down to the beautiful bat expert (Dina Meyer), who
teams up with the local sheriff, (Lou Diamond Phillips) to try to rid the
town of its bat problem. And just to add to the tension -- as if the cheesy
dialogue and plot weren't enough -- they have only a limited time to stop
the bats before the military intervenes by bombing the whole area to kingdom
come to stop the spread of the nasty winged creatures.</P>
<P>The dialogue in the movie goes something like this. Phillips and Meyer are
lifting some crates. She tells him to lift with his legs. He remarks that if
his legs looked as good as hers that he would use them more often. While I
can't disagree with the sentiment, I have to wonder if some horny junior
high student wasn't responsible for some of these winning lines.</P>
<P>Meyer and Phillips are actually two pretty good actors. The problem for each
of them has always seemed to be poor career decisions. Phillips has proven
his talent in films like Courage Under Fire. Meyer is best known for her
work in Starship Troopers, where she was undoubtedly cast as much for her
willingness to go topless as anything else. I have no doubt that Meyer,
given the right role, would hold up admirably -- this isn't that role. The
dialogue and situations aren't quite bad enough as to be embarrassing for
the actors, but they come pretty damn close. I'm still trying to figure out
why the army was going to blow up half of Texas. I'm sure it was explained,
but I was too busy checking out Meyer's ass -- by far the best part of the
movie. I'm not even going to get into the holes in the plot wide enough to
drive a convoy through, or the music that sounded like it was being played
by a drunk using a broken keyboard. Let's just suffice to say that the
cleverest part of this movie was the poster.</P>
<P>Do yourself a favor. Wait for this one to come out on video. Better yet,
save yourself a couple of bucks and wait for it to show up on cable.</P>
