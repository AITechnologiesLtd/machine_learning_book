<P>Seen March 17, 1998 at 9:15 p.m. at Rotterdam Square Mall (Rotterdam, NY),
theater #4, by myself using my Sony/Loews critic's pass. [Theater rating:
**1/2: good picture and sound, poor seats]</P>
<P>        Stories and the process of telling stories are two completely different
things, and it a problem with modern drama is not lack of original ideas, but
original ways to tell stories. "As Good As It Gets" is a perfect example of
this, as it is a film with fresh ideas, but fails to assemble its pieces in a
suitable order. What we end up with is what should be an old fashioned feel-
good movie, but perhaps that's where the problem lies.</P>
<P>        What seems to be an on-going trend with major motion pictures is telling
stories of a protagonist whose mentality is different from the rest of the
world and thus we see things from a completely different perspective (i.e.
"Forrest Gump"). This film also uses that method, but does so in a daring way
by centering the story around an obsessive-compulsive cranky old man. </P>
<P>        One of the basic rules of fiction is to make the main character likable, but
Melvin Udall (Nicholson) is as far from likable as one can get. He's
prejudice, paranoid, selfish, and mean-spirited, and yet he makes for an
original character due mostly to Nicholson's excellent performance. The
opening scenes quickly establish these traits as we watch him throw his
neighbor's irritating dog down his apartment building's trash shoot, and then
proceed to blame and verbally abuse the neighbor, a gay artist named Simon
(Kinnear), for the situation.</P>
<P>        The first act does a fine job in establishing the basic story elements and
plot lines that will crop up later when conflicts occur and thus provide for
theme. Many films follow this procedure, but here it seems just a little too
standard. Melvin's conflict with Simon is played more for comedy than drama,
and his confrontations with Simon's boyfriend Frank work in the same way, but
not only will these elements become more subtractive than additive, the use of
foreshadowing is a bit too blatant.</P>
<P>        In fact, the use of foreshadowing throughout the picture is one of the
biggest problems. Most dramas involve a romance in one way or another, and the
movies tell us that the more polarized the lead male and female characters
are, the more likely they are to get together. Of course this does happen
here, but the film seems to be in denial that this will happen. </P>
<P>        Helen Hunt co-stars as Carol Connelly, a single mom living in a cramped
apartment with her mother and her son who suffers from a serious asthma and
allergy problem. She waits tables at Melvin's favorite restaurant and is
forced to put up with his constant bitching and snide remarks on a daily
basis. Since Melvin is so locked into a routine he can't stand to have anyone
else wait on him besides Carol, and when he learns she may have to quit her
job to take care of his son, he pays to have a specialized doctor take care of
him.</P>
<P>        It takes a while for this plot aspect to come into play, but the process is
at least entertaining and interesting, even if the thematic elements are
slightly sappy. Once Melvin pays for Carol's son's doctor they immediately go
from being just more than strangers to integral parts of each other's lives.
The tension between the two continues to build and it's hard to tell if they
genuinely like or hate each other. Meanwhile, a sub-plot crops up as Simon is
attacked, hospitalized, and loses all of his money. The dog who Melvin had
thrown in the trash is somehow placed in his care which will provide for some
development on behalf of his character, but not enough in the long run.</P>
<P>        A major portion of the film is spent building up separate plots and themes
which are only related through their connection to Melvin. The story is
slowly-paced and many individual scenes provide little more than gratuitous
comic relief (if it's possible for comedy to be gratuitous). This kind of
storytelling should provide ample room for character development, but only
scratches the surface. Nicholson's performance is terrific, but his delivery
still can't make up for the fact his character isn't given much definition
beyond the surface. We never learn what has made him become such a bitter old
man, or why he acts the way he does, especially since he isn't really happy (I
guess it's a chicken-and-the-egg scenario).</P>
<P>        Not until the final act does everything form a sense of cohesion, and
although it does give the film a definite sense of focus, it's not enough to
make up for two acts of a wandering script. Melvin, Carol, and Simon decide to
take a road trip together in an effort to save Simon's career. This in turn
makes for many scenes of interaction and discussion, but the scenes still fall
short of greatness. The tensions between the characters constantly build and
melodrama often dominates as they are either arguing or making amends. All the
subtleties that had come before suddenly aren't so subtle anymore, such as
when Melvin and Carol finally get together (and then break-up, and then get
together....) and Simon finds his artistic roots literally overnight. </P>
<P>        The best way to sum up "As Good As It Gets" is by stating the obvious:
there's quality in the individual aspects, but by the end, nothing has
happened that could not have been predicted at the beginning from the way the
story was told.</P>
