<P>For your own protection, keep your arms and legs inside this movie review at
all times. No smoking will be allowed, although you really shouldn't enter
the premises without the proper mind-sponging substance floating through
your great white yonder, and prepare to meet the man some refer to as Dwayne
Hoover, or his master of creation, Kilgore Trout. This is the story about a
man and his dog. Well...actually...it isn't!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Used car salesman extraordinaire Dwayne Hoover loses his identity in the
midst of a massive mid-life crisis which leads him to cheat on his wife,
whose hooked on pills, attempt to kill himself every other day, and seek out
the answer to the questions in his mind. Very few answers follow.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Bubble, pill, bubble, pill, bubble. Exit 11, take a left please. This film
is based on the apparent "unfilmable" novel written by one Kurt Vonnegut Jr.
Much like last year's unfilmable film FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS (7/10),
it offers much style and esoteric gobbledygook in a narrative which cannot
be described as anything more (or less) than incomprehensible. The
ladieswear department is down by the last aisle, sir. I personally enjoyed
the film on the level in which it was obviously meant to be taken...a
spiritually enlightening chemically-induced psychedelic soul searching
vehicle, in which many people seem to float through the floors, see images
of paradise reflecting from the mirrors, death looming, and bubble with
overly fake enthusiasm/depression. You can call me Bunny, dad. Strobe,
strobe. Don't call me Dwayne, it's Wayne, Wayne Hoobler...like Dwayne
Hoover, you know! Crying won't help, but an apparent big dick and sex with
the secretary f**k machine will? Good soundtrack. The answer for Hoover
obviously lies within life itself. Spiraling lights and a nice, olived marti
ni. Take two!</P>
<P>The actors were all very good in this film, with Bruce Willis standing out
in another very different role for him. He plays this cartoon character very
well and never draws his colors outside of the idiosyncratic line born to be
this person. Dwayne Hoover~?! Is that you~?!! Why don't you just come out
and say it, "I wear women's clothing and I like it!". Nick Nolte is awesome!
His role in this film rivals any in his career! Expect Mr. Nolte to walk
away with many more high award recognitions this year. Best worst part. And
no more goodbye to Blue Mondays after this movie, that's for sure.
Hardy-har-har, Mr. Trout! If that's your "real name" <wink, wink>. I also
enjoyed the style of the film which was basically its only actual film
component, seeing that the substance was only to be discovered through two
highly enriched characters named Mary Jane and Lucy in the Sky with
Diamonds. Thirty-six bucks for a car?! You got it!</P>
<P>I personally will be adding this film to my collection of "high" level
quality productions which one could only truly appreciate when-is that
BIRDSH*T on my car?!! All in all, I would say that I had quite a few laughs,
no serious moments whatsoever, passed the two hour runtime like it was a
five-minute trip through the dentist's waiting room (Top floor, of course),
and appreciated the cooky-wooky soundtrack. Last stop in Brownsville. I love
you and life should be lived while attending life! Please remove your
seatbelts on your way out and make sure to move your hands away from the
aisles. This review has now ended. Thank you for flying in our friendly high
skies. Please check the rating on your way out.</P>
<P>(7/10) --> If you actually understood and appreciated aspects of this review
and enjoy puzzles.
(5/10) --> If you didn't understand and DO NOT WANT TO understand any aspect
of this review, and do not like puzzles.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This might explain a few things about this movie: Novelist Kurt Vonnegut Jr.
once attended College with fellow author Dr. Seuss (Theodore Geisel). Think
about it? Remember all that Who-hash from THE GRINCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS?
Vonnegut Jr., on whose novel this film is based, also makes an appearance in
this movie as the "TV commercial director". He was born in 1922.
This is Nick Nolte's second time in a film based on a Vonnegut Jr. novel.
His first was 1996's MOTHER NIGHT.
Director Alan Rudolph and Bruce Willis had previously worked together in the
1991 film MORTAL THOUGHTS co-starring Bruce's then-wife Demi Moore.
Co-producer David Willis is, you guessed it, Bruce Willis' real-life
brother. He has been involved as a producer on 9 movies since 1990, 7 of
which starred his big-shot brother in one way or another. You go, girl!
This film was nominated for a Golden Berlin Bear award at the 1999 Berlin
International Film Festival.</P>
