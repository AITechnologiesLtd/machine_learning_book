<P>It is commonly thought by most movie experts that Jerome Kern and
Oscar Hammerstein's stage classic "Show Boat" has been filmed three
times. This isn't quite true;in 1929, Universal Pictures made a silent
film of the Edna Ferber novel from which the show was adapted.
However,talking pictures had begun in 1927,the year the show opened on
Broadway,and by 1929, the studio became concerned that the public
wouldn't accept a silent Show Boat. So they added a few talking
scenes, some spirituals, and at the last minute bought the rights to
the stage version,adding a 20 minute sound prologue to the silent film
in which stars of the show sang five of its songs.  The result was a
disaster.   But Universal redeemed itself in 1936, when Carl
Laemmle,Jr. produced and James Whale directed what is considered to be
the finest screen version of"Show Boat" with Irene Dunne, Allan Jones,
Charles Winninger, Paul Robeson and Helen Morgan. Winninger (as Cap'n
Andy) and Morgan (as Julie) repeat their original stage roles, while
Robeson,for whom the role was actually written, plays Joe and sings
his famous rendition of "Ol' Man River", the most powerful song in the
show. Irene Dunne, the first touring company Magnolia ,also repeats
her stage role,and unlike Kathryn Grayson in the MGM1951 Technicolor
remake, gives a memorable acting as well as singing performance. In
fact, one of the things which distinguishes this screen musical from
films like the Jeanette MacDonald -Nelson Eddy operettas is the
quality of the acting. The entire cast,from Irene Dunne down to the
bit players ,breathes real life into the characters,so that the movie
never becomes one corny wait between the hit songs. This is probably
due more to the director James Whale( his only musical) than to the
actors,because Allan Jones never gave a better acting performance,and
Charles Winninger gives the most memorable performance of his career.
As for Helen Morgan,she is truly exceptional as the tragic Julie
,especially when she sings "Can't Help Lovin'Dat Man" and "Bill".
The script for the 1936 "Show Boat", far better than the insipid
script for the 1951 version, is by Oscar Hammerstein II,the original
librettist and lyricist,and relies heavily on his stage dialogue.
Hammerstein and Kern were not about to let their baby fall into the
wrong hands,so they worked on the film, retaining nine songs from the
show, and adding three new ones just as good (or almost as good) as
the ones they replaced. Any changes from the show were made by them,
and director Whale was wise enough to hire original orchestrator
Robert Russell Bennett and original conductor Victor Baravalle. He
also insured complete historical authenticity in the sets .props,and
costumes(including the show boat itself).  For a long,time,this
version of" Show Boat" was suppressed ,partly because MGM owned the
rights,and partly because of the controversy surrounding Paul Robeson.
Now you have your chance to see it,either on TV,video,or laserdisc.
Don't pass it up. This is one of the truly great musical films. </P>
