<PRE>                                    RIDICULE
                        Copyright 1996 D & S Associates</PRE>
<P>Director Patrice Leconte's ("Monsieur Hire") "Ridicule" is France's
submission to the Academy for this year's Best Foreign Language Film.
It stars stage actor Charles Berling as Gregoire Poncludon de Malavoy,
a country engineer who travels to Versailles to get funding to save
the local peasants from fatal fevers by draining swampy mosquito
infested land.  He's taken under the wing of the Marquis de Bellegarde
(Jean Rochefort) and given instruction on how to play the
evil-intentioned wits who make up the court of Louis XVI.  Ponceludon
is also torn between the Mathilde, the ravishing daughter of
Bellegarde (Judith Godreche), who's engaged to a much older man in
order to fund her research, and the worldly Madame de Blayac (Fanny
Ardant), who pulls puppet strings and manipulates favor at court.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>"Ricidule" is a lush costume drama where the main character must
navigate through the shark-infested waters of Louis XVI's court 6
years before the inevitable revolution.  This is a very smart drama
with a great central conflict (the lure and dazzle of the court and
its denizens vs. the simplicity and beauty of Mathilde and the
country) and an unfortunately unsatisfying conclusion.  Ponceludon
eventually 'wins', although not in the manner he had been striving
for, I wondered what took him so long to make his final point that
"children will die tomorrow because you ridiculed me today."  Of
course then we wouldn't have been able to enjoy all the nefarious
scheming along the way!</P>
<P>Jean Rochefort is marvelous as the Marquis who's not able to keep his
wits about him as he had in his youth.  In fact, he keeps a notebook
where he writes down the great barbs and comments that make their
utterer the talk of the court until the next great one comes along.
Bernard Giraudeau is gleefully wicked as 'wit of the moment' Abbot de
Vilecourt and lover of Madame de Blayac - he's like a malicious child
whose actions cause tragedy.  Charles Berling, in his screen debut, is
sympathetic as the simple man who gets in over his head but manages to
remain uncorrupted. Urbain Cancelier is wonderfully cast as a Louis
XVI who constantly seeks entertainment but provides none.  He reminded
me of Jon Lovitz' emperor in "Mom and Dad Save the World."</P>
<P>"Ricidule" is solid, intelligent adult entertainment, a good, but not
great, film.</P>
