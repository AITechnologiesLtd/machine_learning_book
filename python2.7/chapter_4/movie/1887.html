<P>IN A NUTSHELL: If you're like me and *hate* westerns, give this one a
chance.  The mostly black cast is makes for a more historically accurate
view of the Old West than the white-bread Hollywood myopia we're
accustomed to (8,000 cowboys, a third of the lot, were black!!)  Strong
direction, a cast that "clicks" and effective use of "post office
mural" style cinematography.  Flawed slightly by overuse of flashbacks,
and heavy leaning on "eye for an eye" justice.  *Very* violent, but
forgivable.  An appealing sex scene with the same level of explicitness
as most Mel Gibson films.</P>
<P>     This film held my interest from start to finish.  Like many who
remember their first westerns in the age of above ground nuclear
testing, I've never been able to take this format seriously.  We never
saw 5 o'clock shadow on our heros, until the arrival of the spaghetti
westerns in the 60's.  But the faces were still white, and Indians were
usually played by well-tanned Italian actors.  Add to the mix the
mandatory love interest, who'd made it across the plains with her
lipstick and virtue intact.</P>
<P>     Van Pebbles sets the record straight, with a more realistic "color
palette." There were lots of blacks in the old west, including about a
third of the original settlers in Los Angeles.  Many were genuine heroes
who couldn't cross the color-line into an honest obituary or a place in
the history books.  Our Anglo-centric view has excluded blacks from most
American history, outside the Civil War.  A few low-budget "race" films
in the 30's portrayed black cowboys, but the runs were short and the
audiences segregated.  Placing this missing ingredient (black cowboys)
in center spot light makes a tired old format interesting for the first
time in recent memory.</P>
<P>     Van Peebles plays "Jesse Lee," a "buffalo soldier," conscripted
from prison for "life time military service."  (He's in prison for
having attempted to avenged the white-hate induced murder of his
father.)  The film opens with him at the center of the Spanish-American
war (where there were two major divisions of brothers, including an
all-black platoon who's heavy casualties made it safe for Teddy
Roosevelt to gallup up San Juan Hill).  Van Peebles lays it on pretty
thick with the totally despicable, pretty-boy racist captain, who
commands Jesse to murder a fellow soldier for his amusement.  (Though
this is no more exaggerated than elements in most westerns.)  Jesse
assembles a "posse" of fellow black (and one white, Baldwin) outlaws
to break free.  A skirmish leaves the villain shy one eye and with
enough motive to follow Jesse nearly to the ends of the earth, and the
utopian community founded by freed slaves that is Jesse's ultimate
destination.</P>
<P>     Though no Mahatma Gandhi, "Little J" (Baldwin) is remarkably
color-blind for his era, (the only color he sees is "green").  Van
Peebles resists the temptation to make Baldwin a white "Sydney
Poitier," and integrates him very well into the dynamics of the group.
Initially, baser motives (like cheating at gambling) are the unifying
force, but as the escape progresses the characters trust and know each
other on a deeper level, and the color issue gradually fades.</P>
<P>     Though much of the imagery deliberately harks to familiar
spaghetti westerns, Van Peebles makes a much more engaging and sexy
leading man than Clint Eastwood.  Jesse isn't  the totally remote,
unknowable stranger.  You get to know almost more than you want to
about him due to the sepia flashbacks that appear with the annoying
regularity of network TV commercials.  "Jesse's" lusty reunion with the
half Cherokee girlfriend he ditched covers the same amount of skin and
positions as THIEF OF HEARTS, but the darker skin tones nearly earned
the film a NC-17 rating.  The white men on the ratings board still
aren't comfortable viewing nude, black male flesh.</P>
<P>     The film *is* intensely violent, (about the same body count as any
Stephen Segal film) but I didn't find it particularly offensive.
(I've always thought of westerns as bowling tournaments with bodies
instead of pins.)  Be prepared for a few closeups of exactly how a
bullet passes through a face and more.  More troubling is Jesse's "eye
for an eye" approach to picking off everybody who ever did him wrong.
(You begin to wonder if there's anyone in that time zone who didn't
taunt him with flaming crosses, etc, due to the heavily populated
flashbacks.)  But westerns are never particularly realistic about cause
and effect (e.g., how many heroes walked into a hail of badly aimed
bullets, unscathed?)</P>
<P>     Van Peebles brings several interesting "new" elements to the
western format: the dynamics of authority and loyalty in the black
township are intriguing.  (E.g., do they kowtow to the white marshall,
or fight back for what is rightfully theirs?  Take a wild guess.)  The
dynamics between blacks and Indians, who found a lot of common ground
in the crumbs the white establishment approved for them.  A hero who
isn't particularly "mysterious" or tongue-tied on what his motives
are.  A cast who can act.  (This could be the vehicle to make Baldwin a
star.)  A mellow, rich palette for the camera.  (Van Peebles revealed in
the director's chat that he used low-arc lighting in most scenes, which
make both white and black skin look attractive.)  Clever use of humorous
anachronisms (e.g., the whiney barber exclaiming, "Can't we just all
get along?" during the Bonny and Clyde-like hail of bullets sprayed
against his shop).</P>
<P>     Van Peebles has just scratched the surface of unsung black history
of the Old West.  There appears to be enough pay dirt to warrant a lot
more films like this.  And who knows, if they make the violence a
little less like an anatomy class, and stretch out the skin scenes, I
just may learn to like westerns after all.</P>
<P>     Prediction: expect much of the establishment press to downplay
this film for (a) an unfair portrayal of unappetizing white characters
(b) too much violence and (c) explicit sex scenes.  None of these
points are true with this film.  If  any critics are uncomfortable with
the content of this film, they should blame our censored history text
books.</P>
