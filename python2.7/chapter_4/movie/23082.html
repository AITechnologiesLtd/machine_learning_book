<P>   When a newborn babe is left in a trash can or a park
bench, that's sad; it's tragic.  When an unlikely person
discovers the baby, someone who seems not in the slightest
prepared to deal with the treasure, that's fun; it's comedy.  In
"Not of This World," winner of four Donatello awards (that's
the Italian Oscar) and Italy's entry into the American
Academy Awards competition, director Giuseppe Piccioni
successfully integrates comic undertones with a poignant
motif, giving his audience a marvelously layered tale of two
people whose lives are changed by this tiny bundle of joy.  </P>
<P>   How would the Americans treat such a theme?  In Charles
Shyer's 1987 comedy "Baby Boom," a supercharged business
exec's life is changed when she inherits a baby, in a sweet
comedy featuring Diane Keaton in top form, one which takes
aim at the self-centeredness of 1980s yuppies.  That same
year Leonard Nimoy turned out another comedy, "3 Men and
a Baby," about a trio of swinging bachelor roommates who
find themselves custodians of an infant--a movie that also
featured winning performances all around.  If you're satisfied
with mere comedy and you're not in the mood for getting
under the skins of your characters, you can't go wrong with
these.  But if you want a film that does not stereotype your
characters (Keaton as pure yuppie, Selleck as solid swinger)
but puts a human dimension even on the sort of woman who
would abandon her baby, go see "Not of This World." 
Featuring an unaffected sound track of Ludovico Einaudi's
marvelous piano music and a set of unpretentious
performances about people who in their separate ways are
unsure of themselves, "Not of This World" is so heartwarming
that unless you capito Italiano, you can't be blamed for
wanting to throw tomatoes at the technically miserable
subtitles which are virtually unreadable whenever they are
contrasted with a white background.</P>
<P>   In its special way, this movie takes off on the adage that
marriage doesn't make all that much difference in your life:
the big change comes when you're dealing with your first
child.  The story opens in Milan on an attractive nun, Caterina
(Margherita Buy--who resembles a young Catherine
Deneuve) who, while walking in the park, has a baby thrust
into her arms by a jogger.  (That the runner take a few puffs
on a cigarette makes you wonder whether Jim Jarmusch was
called in as a consultant.)  Instantly bonding with the little
tyke, Caterina takes her package to the local hospital.  As
she gazes upon the little kid who is to get the name Fausto,
she is thrown into doubts about her commitment to God. 
With eleven months to go before she is to take her final vows
and with her own mother insisting that Caterina is wasting her
life, the poor woman is faced by the conflict of her life.  Nor is
Ernesto (Silvio Orlando--who looks like a young Peter Sellers
and acts a nerdy Woody Allen)--about to continue his own
lonely, single existence unmoved by the needs of others. 
Having inherited a dry cleaning establishment from his father,
he has nothing but complaints about debts, does not
remember the names of the women who work for him, and is
generally considered a decent but unlovable guy.  Caterina
tracks down Ernesto through a sweater that served as the
baby's wrap, and while this unlikely couple--both assuming
that Ernesto is the father--seek out the woman who
abandoned the toddler, Piccioni treats us to a delicate,
believable, trenchant peeling away of their defenses.</P>
<P>   The title, "Not of This World," refers at first glance to
Caterina's commitment to the Church, a dedication that takes
her out of the usual mundane concerns of the Italian
citizenry.  Not for her the worries of making a living, or
keeping a family together, or successfully raising little ones. 
But on closer examination, we see that both of Piccioni's
absorbing principals are figuratively from outer space.  Both
have lost the usual links they might enjoy from their society,
having cast off the connections that ordinary people have to
home and family.  When Caterina shucks her habit for a day
and dons a plain burgundy sweater, heading off in Ernesto's
car to seek out Fausto's apparently callous mom, we in the
audience wonder whether these disparate personalities will
get together--Caterina declining to take her vows and Ernesto
finding the woman of his dreams.  But Piccioni--whose "The
Great Blek," "Condemned to Wed," and "Love, Money and
Philosophy" are little known to American moviegoers--is not
about to go for facile endings.  </P>
<P>   What's particularly captivating about the director's work is
not only the anticipation we feel as we watch the growing
alliance between Ernesto and Caterina, but the humanity he
shows of people about whom we'd never think twice.  The
nuns are a diverse and even fun-loving lot, enjoying their
weekly games of bingo, and the women who work in the
laundry have families and dreams and joys of their own--
hopes that Ernesto has all but ignored in treating them like
cogs in the pressing machines.  Marina (Marina Massironi),
the lonely and idiosyncratic girl in the bar who leaves her
phone number on napkins; the Mother Superior (Sonia
Gessner), who urges Caterina to reconsider her commitment
to the Church; Gabriele (Alessandro Di Natale), the boy friend
and probably father of Fausto; all seek human connection
and in doing so provide some of the gentle humor of the story
as well as the pathos.  Teresa (Carolina Freschi), the frail-
looking woman who had abandoned the child, is not a bad
person but rather one who is vulnerable and who has given
up a child for whom she feels inadequate to care.  "Not of
This World" portrays a little world of Milanese people who are
like the rest of us: they're lonely, they're happy; they're
conflicted, they're confident; they're moody, they're content. 
In short they really are of this world, and Piccioni lovingly
shows them to us with all their humanity.</P>
