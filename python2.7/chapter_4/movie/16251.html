<P>starring Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright Penn, Chazz Palminteri
screenplay by David Rabe, based on his play
directed by Anthony Drazan</P>
<P>The word "hurlyburly" describes the thought patterns of Eddie the
Cokehead to a tee. As played by Sean Penn, hypersensitive Eddie is
like the wind-up toy that always threatens to stroll right off the
tabletop. Eddie just doesn't let things go-at first his behaviour
smacks of self-absorption. As the movie progresses, we come to
understand Eddie as a kind of existential Sherlock Holmes, desperate
to get to the bottom of, quite literally, everything. Hurlyburly is
about how a place like Hollywood can eat a person like Eddie alive.</P>
<P>Eddie, with his pencil-thin mustache and lazily gelled hair, is a
player high enough on the food chain to afford a big, sterile Beverly
Hills pad and enough cocaine to keep him buzzed all day. (He snorts in
place of morning coffee.) He shares his home with Mickey (Spacey), a
slick, bleach-blonde smoothie who is dating the woman (Wright Penn) 
Eddie had his sights set on. (Eventually Mickey, feeling not so much
shame or guilt as defeat and frustration, breaks up with the woman,
Darlene, and encourages her to hook up with Eddie.) Further stressing
Eddie out is Phil (Palminteri), a hulky, ticking time bomb who grows
more violent and more needy as his marriage corrodes. Phil is a 
stray pitbull our hero can't shake...and deep down, Eddie doesn't want
to lose him, because Phil's hostility makes Eddie look rational by
comparison. Meanwhile, a teenage runaway (The Piano's Anna Paquin,
unfortunately the film's weakest link) is staying at their house, a
"gift" from friend Artie (Garry Shandling), who spotted her on an 
elevator.</P>
<P>Hurlyburly does not shed its stagebound roots-no more than a handful
of scenes unfold outside of Eddie and Mickey's place, and towards the
end of the film one senses that Drazan is struggling to maintain some
visual interest in the central location. But the cast is mesmerizing
enough to compensate; these performances are grand and theatrical and,
thanks to the advantages of the close up, paradoxically intimate-our
eyes and ears are peeled throughout. Spacey, effectively typecast,
plays apathetic Mickey with confidence. (The quintessential Spacey 
moment comes during an exchange towards the end of the picture: Eddie:
"You have no feelings!" Mickey: "No, I have my own feelings, not
yours.") Palminteri as Phil annoys and frightens in balanced doses,
just as he should. However, the picture belongs to Penn, as the addict
whose brain is too big for his heart. Five and ten minute chunks 
of Hurlyburly pass with no one speaking but Eddie, who delivers
stupefacient monologues that invariably end in tears. Penn doesn't
earn our sympathies-instead, he wins something closer to pity. Your
enjoyment of the film will hinge on whether or not you can stomach two
solid hours of Sean Penn.</P>
<P>Which leads me to my next point: as enthralling as all this human
drama frequently is, Hurlyburly overstays its welcome. Perhaps that's
because there's very little order to the story's structure; when
Bonnie, a stripper (Meg Ryan, flexing atrophied acting muscles), shows
up in what I'll call act two, it seems for no other reason than
boredom on the part of Rabe. Such is the nature of the filmed play, I
suppose, but Drazan could have edited a tighter film. Without the
benefit of the play's intermission, the travails of Eddie and his
cruisers are thoroughly exhausting.</P>
