<P>PLOT:
Story of two families living in Connecticut in the 1970s. The unemotional
husband and wife duos don't seem to have much spark left in their marriage,
like to drink and cheat. This improper umbilical cord introduces their kids
to the wonderfully insecure world of their adolescence without much moral or
parental guidance. Adults only, please.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Interesting at times, boring at others, this character study semi-succeeds
in portraying a couple of dysfunctional nuclear clans, with solid
performances by all of its stars, especially the kids, despite its
occasional overly existential moments. Everyone in this movie is quite cold
and distant, appreciated to an extent by all who have gone through some
downer periods in their own lives, but hard to swallow for those who look
for entertainment in films. In that sense, this film is not recommended to
those who are looking for fun and amusement, despite a couple of curiously
unserious scenes. This film is meant for the higher-browed people who enjoy
watching others bemoan their lifeless journeys, contemplate a sack of sins,
and live in complete dysfunction among one another (Woody Allen, eat your
heart out!). Depressed yet? No, check out this film!</P>
<P>The writing is very good, most of the characters well-drawn and the look of
the film, unique and appropriate. I did find the pacing to be a little too
slow for my own jive, and bothered by the TITANIC-esque annoying flutes
passing off as the score, but all in all, an interesting study of human
beings attempting to differentiate themselves from the kingdom of the
animals.</P>
