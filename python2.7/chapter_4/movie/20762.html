<P>  A high-profile critic who saw a movie I loved, "In the
Company of Men," told me that never before was he so
tempted to throw something at the screen.  When I found out
his motive was a hatred of the heartless men who are
characterized by filmmaker Neil LaBute, I congratulated him
for having emotions.  Movies should indeed make us feel:
whether good, sad, depressed, thrilled, and yes, even
absolutely enraged at evil.  The worst kind of movie is the
bland equivalent of elevator music: it's just there.</P>
<P>   Now, Harmony Korine's "Julien Donkey-Boy" surely does
not merit the pejorative of cinematic elevator music.  It made
me want to throw something at the screen--a shoe, a
backpack, anything available--but though the audience might
cheer such an action, my throwing arm is not as good as
Kevin Costner's and I'd only lose half a pair of Pro-Walkers. 
The problem is that my motive in wanting to heave an object
is in no way the same as my colleague's.  Nobody in Korine's
movie is villainous. There's nobody to attack.  But the picture
is so personal to the filmmaker, so lacking universality and
general interest to a diverse audience, that it might as well be
a home movie shown to bored uncles and aunts.  This time,
though, we're not even family, so multiply the exasperation
exponentially.  </P>
<P>   Harmony Korine, who is now 25 and turned out his first
directorial effort with the plotless, repulsive "Gummo" 
(featuring an Ohio lad who kills cats and sells the bodies to a
supermarket), is by his own statement not out to shock
people with "Julien," and he probably won't.  But he will
encourage a good deal of his audience--those who are not so
determined to demonstrate that they can perceive "art" when
most others cannot--to think, "Who cares?"  Watching some
of these characters on the screen is about as entertaining as
giving an ear to that drug-stupored denizen of the New York
subways, sprawled across four seats and mumbling
inconsequential nothings to no-one in particular.  </P>
<P>   The title character, a man-child played by Ewen Bremner,
is a 21-year-old schizophrenic who hears voices.  Korine
does not share those voices with his audience, but he lets us
in on quite a few babblings from Julien.  The wild-haired,
gold-toothed young man plays with a turtle (I think he
squashes it allowing its guts to spill over his face, but I
couldn't be sure).  His demented father (Werner Herzog)
plays a man who is likely a cause of the lad's emotional
problems.  Dad hoses down Julien's brother Chris (Evan
Neumann), and commands the boy not to shiver. "Be a man!" 
He offers Julien $10 to try on a dress that the boy's mother
wore to her wedding--"That's a month's pay for someone in
Bangladesh."  When Julien's pregnant sister Pearl (Chloe
Sevigny) has a miscarriage after falling on the ice rink, Julien
takes the baby's corpse, steals it away from the hospital, and
rides it home on the train, hugging it to his person while
crawling under his bed.  Poignant this is not.</P>
<P>   When Korine thinks we've had enough of this Julien, he
takes us to other Fellini-esque characters, including an
armless man who plays cards and drums with his feet, an
black man who sings a rap song over and over about how
he's an Albino from Alabama; and a saleswoman in a baby
clothing department who tells Pearl that when the first-born is
a boy, the womb is blessed.</P>
<P>   Korine's picture is photographed with 30 cameras, using
the Dogma 95 technique glorified by the Danish filmmaker
Lars von Triers.  Dogma 95, which could be subtitled
Chastity, us a kind of Brechtian notion that illusion should be
stripped away, avoiding special effects or anything else that
would get in the way of a documentary-style of capturing
images.  Clearly Korine's goal in using video, blowing it up for
the big screen, is to capture a greater intimacy than can be
snared by directors with opulent illusionary means at their
disposal.  With characters like the wearisome group
promenading across this plotless, clueless film, intimacy is
the last thing we may want.</P>
