<P>IN SHORT: Start-up sparks fizzle, but not a dud.</P>
<P>Before we start, this is the kind of review Cranky hates to write
because a flick with more positives is going to get what appears to be a
negative rating, if you are a new reader and don't understand how we
work. If that's you <a href="http://www.crankycritic.com/history.html"

<P>So . . . what's wrong with this picture? Nothing, actually. It's a
perfectly average story with an OK script and direction. It is pleasing,
intelligent, humorous and there's good chemistry between stars Linda
Fiorentino and Paul Newman. Once the sparks get pulled out of the story
mix, everything settles way down. The sense of elation that we expect
from an underdog getting away with the big score "caper" flick just
isn't here.</P>
<P>We start on a high school Prom night, for soon to be marrieds Carol Ann
and Wayne McKay (Linda Fiorentino and Dermot Mulroney), the highpoint of
their lives, before and after. Fifteen or so years later, Carol is a
rehab therapist in a nursing home and Wayne works the night shift at an
unspecified job. The fire is almost gone from their marriage, unless a
certain song by The Cars reminds them of what was probably the biggest
thrill of their lives.</P>
<P>Into the home, whose population seems to be 99 per cent elderly ladies,
comes Henry Manning (Paul Newman). Manning, a notrious bank robber,
suffered such a severe stroke in prison that he has been temporarily
transferred out. Slumped in his wheel chair, with only the twitch of his
left hand to indicate that anything at all is functioning within his
body, Manning is essentially dead to the world. Except that Carol starts
to notice things, coincidences if you will, that indicate to her that
Manning isn't the vegetable that he appears to be. She makes it her duty
to try to get a rise out of the man. Literally. (OK, guys. Linda
Fiorentino in a nurse's uniform. Go to town. The flick does...) Until
the lady manages to crack the man's shell, this flick is a very sexy and
very funny good time. And Newman never speaks a word.</P>
<P>Carol's ultimate goal is to put the thrill back in her and Wayne's life.
She's determined to get Manning to teach her how to rob the local bank,
and get away with it. Oh, and Wayne, too. When the hubbie senses that
something naughty may be going on between his wife and the con, he lays
down the law, and Manning says "No problem." From that point on, the
sexual sparks fizzle and we're left with an average caper flick.</P>
<P>Why didn't Manning flee the home? It's covered in the script. How did he
pull off the stroke? It's covered in the script. How does the caper come
about and is it logical that it could succeed? It's covered in the
script. Is there an inevitable twist that puts the plans in jeopardy?
It's covered in the script, a couple of times to keep things
interesting. Where's the elation you're supposed to feel when the
inevitable occurs? Heck if I know. The script has everything it's
supposed to. The direction gets from point A to point B, but all the
pizazz goes out of the story early on. It's up to the director to keep
that chemistry sparking; in this case not letting the leads have any
kind of flirtatious back and forth is deadly.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Where the Money Is, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$4.00</PRE>
<P>Pay per view level. My parents, retired and eligible for dirt cheap
tickets, would love this kind of flick. To those of us for whom Paul
Newman is still a big star name (like me), if there's nothing else out
there of interest you might risk first run ticket prices, if they're not
too much above what your cable system will charge down the line.</P>
