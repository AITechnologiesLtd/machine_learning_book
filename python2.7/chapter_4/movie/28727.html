<P>WITH A FRIEND LIKE HARRY (HARRY, UN AMI QUI VOUS VEUT DU BIEN)<HR></P>
<P>Michel (Laurent Lucas, "Pola X") doesn't realize that he's slowly sinking 
under the weight of his responsibilities.  On the road to a vacation home,
which itself is a major renovation burden, with his stressed wife and three
small girls, Michel pulls into a rest stop for some relief from the heat.
In the washroom, Michel is approached by Harry, (Sergi Lopez, "An Affair of
Love") an old schoolmate he hasn't seen in twenty years and barely
remembers.  The next thing Michel knows, Harry and his girlfriend Plum
(Sophie Guillemin, "L'Ennui") are joining his vacation in Writer/Director
Dominik Moll's "With a Friend Like Harry."</P>
<P>While Michel is struggling, Harry lives the enviable good life of a man
of inheritted wealth, yet Harry immediately exhibits an almost
obsessive regard for Michel.  Harry shocks Michel by reciting a long poem,
"The Dagger in the Skin of Night," which Michel had published in the 
school paper two decades earlier.  Plum even pipes in that Harry has often
recited it to her.  Michel's wife Claire (Mathilde Seigner, 
"Venus Beauty Institute") is both wary of Harry and intrigued by this 
unknown aspect of her mate while we, the audience, begin to wonder just
how random Harry's appearance in that rest stop really was.</P>
<P>As if Harry's invasion weren't enough, Michel is annoyed to discover that his
meddling parents have taken it upon themselves to remodel the old farmhouse's
bathroom in a garish, womblike pink.  Harry observes this, then the breakdown
of the old family car, and begins to help.  His first gesture is shocking
enough - he buys a new 4 wheel drive SUV for Michel.  Then his actions begin
to get a lot more personal.</P>
<P>Moll seems to be going for claustrophobic Hitchcockian suspense, even choosing
the only male name ever to appear in a Hitchcock film for his own, yet "With
a Friend Like Harry" feels a lot like George Sluizer's 1988 Spoorloos ("The 
Vanishing), another film that features a fateful rest stop, an old farmhouse 
and earthy excavations.  Moll knows how to build tension, apparent at the onset
with that nightmarish family car trip, yet ultimately is unable to sustain it.
The ambiguity surrounding Harry's persona and motivations lets the air out of
the film's climax.</P>
<P>Still, the film has more going for it than not.  Art Director Michel Barthelemy
gets just the right level of fixer-upperness for the beautifully set vacation
home to see the fanciful possibilities before reality sets in.  Director of 
Photography Matthieu Poirot-Delpech is able to capture that house, the roads
to it, and even Michel himself in lights both flattering and sinister.
Sound Engineer Francois Maurel has done an expert job capturing ominous
rumblings, nightmarish whirrings and staccato shrieks while original music by
David Sinclair Whittaker provides effective (if a bit obvious) flourishes to
the visuals.</P>
<P>"With a Friend Like Harry" (the original English title was "Harry, He's Here
to Help") was nominated for 9 Cesars (the French Oscar), winning Best Director
and Best Actor.  While I appreciate Lopez' performance, I found Lucas to have
the more difficult job - one which he navigates adroitly.  Seigner fleshes
out complexities for Claire while Guillemin makes a simple character positively
endearing.  Moll has proved he can create mood and work with actors, yet his
storytelling, while psychologically detailed on many levels, doesn't fully
satisfy yet, with this, his second film.  I for one am looking forward to his
third.</P>
