[film] "eXistenZ"
A Postview, copyright 1999 P-M Agapow</PRE>
<P>It is the near future.  Allegra Gellar (Lewis) is the world's
greatest designer of virtual reality games.  During a playtest of
her masterpiece "eXistenZ", a botched assassination takes place. 
Unable to trust anyone, she flees with a makeshift bodyguard Ted
Pikul (Law).  Attempting to retrieve the only copy of her damaged
game, Allegra and Pikul enter the scenario as the divisions
between game and reality blur.</P>
<P>In order not to spoil the film, this review must by necessity be
brief and somewhat elliptical.</P>
<P>"eXistenZ" (pronounced ex-is-TENZ, as in existential) divides me
like few films have before.  On one hand there are some nice
twists and turns in it.  On the other the blurring of dream and
reality (be it actual dreams, virtual reality or hallucinations)
has been done similarly many times before.  (To name but a few
examples: "The Game", "Brazil", "The Stuntman", "Naked Lunch".) 
On one hand, "eXistenZ" is sometimes very funny and lively.  On
the other it contains some horrible acting and implausible plot. 
It's a movie I enjoy more in retrospect than in actually seeing
it.</P>
<P>It is the first half-hour of this film that will probably make or
break the viewer's opinion.  The actors drag themselves lumpishly
through the preliminaries to establish the plot.  Lewis, taking a
break from playing nyphomaniac imbeciles, mumbles an explaination
of why her game is so good.  Law sports a North American accent
so phony and an expression so wooden that he seems to have
wandered in from the set of "Night of the Living Dead".  Soon
they are on the run and Law is whining, "I Want To Know What is
Going On", capital letters and all.  But then he confesses, "I
have a fear of having my body penetrated surgically".  And only
in a Cronenberg film would you find anyone with a phobia so
specific.  Probably because he watched "Dead Ringers", poor
fellow.  But then Willem Dafoe shows up, playing a man (uh) a man
with bad teeth, who gives the Law the surgical penetration he's
been looking for.</P>
<P>Then we are introduced to the actual game and about now things
start to get interesting.  Players "plug in" by inserting fleshy
cables into "bioports", cavities in their spine.  Naturally,
sticking the jack into your bioport is a metaphor for sex.  But
this is a Cronenberg film and everything is a metaphor for sex. 
Except for sex itself, which is a metaphor for death.</P>
<P>The game play will give any veteran roleplayer or text adventure
addict a few laughs.  Our protagonists are lead by the nose
through a ridiculous plot, forced into certain actions, and at
one point struggle to extract information from a dopey non-player
character.  (This evoked strong memories of typing, "examine
item, get item, pickup item, retrieve item, grab item," to get
the reply, "You can't do that.")</P>
<P>The plot of the movie itself is mysterious and defies any
consistent explanation.  There is a viewpoint that allows one to
explain away the hideous acting and loo pholes as intentional
artifacts of the director.  But the acting is still poor and the
plot still nonsensical.  But if you can get by that (and it's a
big if), "eXistenZ" will provide a few amusing gags and twists
and probably leave a grin on your face.  [***/good] and a good
party you don't remember most of on the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
