<PRE>                                 SISTER ACT
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     SISTER ACT is a film directed by Emile Ardolino, from a script by
"Joseph Howard."  It stars Whoopie Goldberg, Maggie Smith, and Harvey
Keitel, with Kathy Najimy, Wendy Makkena, and Bill Nunn.  Rate PG for
language.</P>
<P>     SISTER ACT showed a lot of potential to be the summer's sleeper hit
when I saw it at an after-work matinee on Friday.  It was booked into
two of the auditoria in the local multiplex and my theater was packed
with very happy movie-goers.  I know I enjoyed it a lot more than I
thought I would after reading the reviews in our local dailies.  If it
does take off and become a money machine, it will be a triumph in a way.
From what I've read, this was not a happy movie to make.  Goldberg said
she'd never work for Disney or Touchstone again.  Bette Midler was
offered the part of Deloris Van Cartier first, a part conceived
especially for her.  When Goldberg took it on, it had to be
substantially rewritten, and she has even accused the studio of a racist
script.  I understand that seven writers (including Carrie Fisher)
contributed to the final script.  The script is attributed to the
traditional pseudonym Joseph Howard as a result.  It was made on the
cheap, for a low-end $15 million, as part of Disney's new policy, and as
a result does not appear at its best -- shoddily produced and big,
uncaring story holes.</P>
<P>     Still, SISTER ACT has a lot of power resources that helped it
overcome its own problems.  For one, the director, Emile Ardolino (DIRTY
DANCING) has a proven track record as a hitmaker; he gives the film its
energy and timing and the audience has no choice but to be sucked into
the film by its own momentum.  Whoopie Goldberg, even though she is by
no means at her sharpest here -- sanitized and toned down by the Disney
image -- still gives us her best comedy/action film yet (perhaps
excepting GHOST in which she was a supporting player).  And she
generously shares the spotlight with Kathy Najimy as the bouncy,
sizeable Sister Mary Patrick and with Wendy Makkena as Sister Mary
Robert the novice who finds herself in her singing.  And of course, the
estimable Maggie Smith is letter perfect as Mother Superior; no one on
either side of the Atlantic can purse a lip better than Maggie Smith.
It is the friendships that Goldberg makes in the convent that are the
emotional heart of this warmly funny movie.</P>
<P>     And it is amazingly funny, especially given the hackneyed and
entirely predictable script, which is pretty much THE SOUND OF MUSIC in
reverse.  Some of the best moments are the rehearsals and performances
of the nuns' choir, the direction of which Whoopie takes over.  And the
songs, Motown classics and Salve Regina, are given the
R&B-goes-to-church treatment with respect and affection, and they work
in "making a joyful noise."  Frankly, you haven't lived until you've
heard "My Guy" or "I Will Follow Him" in an ecclesiastical context.</P>
<P>     I can cheerfully recommend to SISTER ACT to all but the most
serious among you.  It is a warm, funny movie, an ideal summer break,
without a thought in its cinematic head, but with lots of chemistry,
friendship, respect, and energy.  You can even pay full ticket price
with a clean conscience.</P>
<P>     (In the Seattle area, SISTER ACT is playing at several
theaters, including the Crossroads down a piece from the
corporate campus.)</P>
