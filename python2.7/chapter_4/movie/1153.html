<PRE>                             MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO
                       A film review by Sarah M. Elkins
                        Copyright 1991 Sarah M. Elkins</PRE>
<P>MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO:  "She took the story in like some strange, spiked
gift, too fragile to drop, too painful to hold."  - from Lois McMaster
Bujold's SHARDS OF HONOR</P>
<P>Plot kickoff: Two Portland teenagers - one is Mike (?) a pathetic
narcoleptic (River Phoenix), one is Scott Faber, a rich kid slumming
(Keanu Reeves) until his inheritance kicks in - hustle "dates" with men
and women in Portland, and set off on a road trip to Idaho and Italy to
find Mike's mom.</P>
<P>Characters/acting: outstanding.  Phoenix strips away all defenses,
playing a helpless, lonely kid who's become numb to his own despair.
Reeves plays a complex character, sometimes jaded, sometimes
compassionate, sometimes cruel, slipping in and out of his "Prince Hal"
mode effortlessly, and yet the same person underneath it all - but even
though he's engaging, he's also so remote that we never quite know who
that person is.  The other characters, Hans, the bizarre performance
artist, and Bob, the "king" of the other hustlers, also fit their roles
smoothly.</P>
<P>Cinematography/FX: Dreamlike scenes of Idaho - I don't know how they
got the clouds and sky to do what they did.  Wonderful.  Gritty scenes
of the street, still probably not as gritty as it could have been.
Seeing the world through Mike's eyes as he has seizures is very strange
(I hunger to see director Gus Van Sant (Drugstore Cowboy) do a movie of
Dhalgren, or any Delaney).  See skin/situations below.  Definitely a big
plus to see this on the big screen.  I'd still recommend it even for the
small screen, though.</P>
<P>Score/Sound: Some of the dialogue was sort of whispered and hard to
hear.  The soundtrack is minimal for most of the movie as far as I
noticed; there were two good songs during the closing credits.</P>
<P>Violence/language: A few guns waved around, a fight in the dark (low
visibility).  Actually, I don't remember that much profanity, though it
must have been there.</P>
<P>Skin/situations: Intense and graphic, but in golden-tone "still" shots
too fast to really take in any one shot.  Very interesting technique,
more effective than any "heaving bodies" scene I've seen.  Menage a
trois among Hans, Mike, and Scott.</P>
<P>Analysis: The whole audience laughed at several scenes, but for me it
was partly to keep my throat from getting tight and my eyes from
watering.  This is not a "tearjerker", but at times I felt overwhelmed
by sadness.  The unique vision and occasional beauty of this superb
movie has enspelled me, and I want to be gripped by it again.  Highly
recommended.</P>
