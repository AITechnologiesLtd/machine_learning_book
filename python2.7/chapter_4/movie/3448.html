                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<PRE>ROB ROY
Starring:  Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Tim Roth,
           Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox.
Screenplay:  Alan Sharp.
Director:  Michael Caton-Jones.</PRE>
<P>     Period adventures have been around as long as the movies.
Throughout that time, and especially into modern efforts, such films
have rarely navigated successfully between the twin perils of the
genre:  tedious hero-worship on the one hand, grade-B schlock on the
other.  Rare is the film that manages to be both exciting and
intelligent, both compelling as character-based drama and a good
old-fashioned good guys vs. bad guys tale.  ROB ROY does manage
both, and then some.  Though the film's love story doesn't quite
click, the main story is wonderfully acted and exhilarating to
watch.</P>
<P>     Liam Neeson stars as the title character, 18th century Scotsman
Robert Roy MacGregor.  A caretaker for the lands of the Marquis of
Montrose (John Hurt), MacGregor is also the de facto leader of his
impoverished clan.  Determined to make a better life for himself,
his wife Mary (Jessica Lange) and his entire clan, MacGregor borrows
1,000 pounds from Montrose to buy cattle and turn a significant
profit.  But Montrose's accountant Killearn (Brian Cox) and devious
housegest Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) conspire to steal the
money, leaving MacGregor with a massive and unpayable debt.  When
Montrose offers to erase the debt in exchange for MacGregor
tarnishing the reputation of Montrose's rival lord, MacGregor
refuses, leading to a war of honor between Englishmen and Scotsmen,
and between MacGregor and Cunningham in particular.</P>
<P>     The plot of ROB ROY is a fairly dense one, including a healthy
dose of post-Restoration English political machinations which might
leave many viewers wondering why being accused of being a "Jacobite"
would be such a big deal.  These instances are rare enough, however,
not to be distracting.  Perhaps one reason is that in its structure
and tone, ROB ROY has the archetypal appeal of a Shakespeare play,
with the political elements serving only to set up conflicts, not to
define them.  The characters' relationships are laid out in classic
dramatic terms:  Cunningham, a bastard who plays the role of
courtier, hates his benefactor Montrose even as he envies his
position; MacGregor has a virtue (devotion to the concept of honor)
which also becomes the source of his misery.  Alan Sharp's
screenplay makes sure that even though the characters have mythic
dimensions, they do not remain one-dimensional.</P>
<P>     That's the academic end.  ROB ROY is also just a fine piece of
movie-making, beginning with the superb direction of Michael
Caton-Jones.  His opening shot is the perfect introduction to an
epic, a breathtaking view of the highlands into which the characters
slowly wander and draw closer.  The pacing lags here and there, and
the more brutal elements of the story are occasionally excessive,
but those are exceptions in an otherwise top-notch job, particularly
a pair of magnificently staged duels.  Special note should also go
to Carter Burwell, who provides a stirring Celtic-themed score.</P>
<P>     For my money though, ROB ROY works fundamentally because its
villains--all three of them--are fantastic.  As fine a job as
Liam Neeson does with MacGregor, his character is essentially a
legend, a striking figure but fairly static.  Tim Roth, on the other
hand, is a showy delight as Cunningham, the fop with a serious
sadistic streak, and he takes it to the limit.  John Hurt's Montrose
is a cold-eyed political back-stabber, and expert manipulator of any
situation to his benefit.  The best of the three might be Brian Cox,
best unknown as the "other" Hannibal Lecter in 1986's MANHUNTER.  He
is frighteningly vile, and the scene in which he turns a threat from
Jessica Lange's Mary back on her is one of the film's best.</P>
<P>     As for Lange, she may be the weak link.  Her acting style has
never been one of my favorites, and sometimes her emotions feel
forced.  ROB ROY tries to build the love story between Rob and Mary
into one of the central elements, but the conflict between Rob and
the Englishmen is always more interesting.  Nevertheless, all the
elements combine into an extremely satisfying whole.  ROB ROY is not
for the squeamish, with its swordplay and a lengthy rape scene, nor
is it for those looking strictly for a lusty romp.  It is a story
about characters as much as it is about battles, and it succeeds as
both.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 duels of honor:  8.</PRE>
