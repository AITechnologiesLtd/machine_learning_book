<PRE>ALMOST HEROES
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: [zero stars] out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>It's sad...Chris Farley's last film is also his worst.  It's a bad
epitaph, and a worse movie.</P>
<P>Matthew Perry stars as Leslie Edwards, an explorer whose goal is to beat
Lewis and Clark to the Pacific Ocean.  To achieve this goal, he hires
the second best tracker in early America, Bartholomew Hunt (Chris
Farley), a drunken buffoon who has blundered his way into his
reputation.</P>
<P>And that's about all there is which passes for plot in this film. Their
party contains some purportedly colorful characters such as jealous
Frenchman Guy Fontenot (Eugene Levy), and encounters some purportedly
colorful characters, such as the vain Spaniard Hidalgo (Kevin Dunn), but
someone, somewhere forgot the humor.</P>
<P>There are only two sequences in the entire film which are barely
chuckle-worthy (Farley's eagle trials, and the group of elderly
warriors). But they in no way can justify anyone in their right mind
suffering through the rest of this atrocious film.</P>
<P>Die-hard fans of Farley will undoubtedly visit this travesty even though
they would be better served by reviewing his best work: his skits on
SNL. Farley was never able to locate a worthy movie for his talents.
(Tommy Boy was the closest, but a messy and cluttered attempt that was
more miss than hit.)  Perhaps the problem was his reliance on the
"fat-guy-falls-down" brand of humor that worked well in sketch comedy,
but seemed labored when stretched out to fill a full movie. He never was
able to either transcend the juvenile level of humor, or to make a movie
filled with juvenile humor actually entertaining.</P>
<P>But, if Farley did a bad job here, at least he had company. Matthew
Perry does a horrifically bad job.  He actually manages to outshine
Farley in the overacting category - an impressive feat, mind you, but
not one conducive to a pleasant viewing experience.  The rest of the
cast are for the most part forgettable (a fact which I'm sure many of
them will appreciate).</P>
<P>Director Christopher Guest takes a major wrong turn after his appealing
Waiting for Guffman. Almost Heroes wallows in stupidity...not
stupid-funny...just plain stupid. I got the feeling that some of the
material might have played better had the movie allowed itself to stray
from the rigidity of its plot.  For example, the subplot involving an
injury prone explorer could have actually been humorous if the movie
allowed its tone to resemble that of say, Monty Python and the Holy
Grail, or even South Park.  But, no, the movie never strays far from
reality, and as a result, the humor stays grounded.</P>
<P>Why were Edwards and Hunt left out of the history books? Anyone who sees
this movie will have a good idea: it's definitely not something you want
to remember.</P>
