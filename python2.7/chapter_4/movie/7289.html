minutes.PG-13.</P>
<P>Let's do grammatical justice to the memories of Marcello Mastroianni and
Federico Fellini. In "La Dolce Vita" (1960) Mastroianni was a tabloid's
reporter. His photographer was called Paparazzo, a name that spread
worldwide immediately as a common noun to designate tenacious snapshooters
of celebrities. Paparazzo is singular, paparazzi is plural. In "That Old
Feeling,"  Bette Midler refers to the young man whostalks her with his
camera as "a paparazzi," which is like saying "a men."</P>
<P>One does not expect culture from Hollywood, but one does expect quality
from Carl Reiner. As a jack-of-all-comedies (variously performer, gagman,
producer, etc.) he was a luminary of TV's "Your Show of Shows" and "The
Dick Van Dyke Show." He played in and wrote for movies, directed films that
include "Where's Poppa?,"" Oh, God!,"" The Jerk,"" Dead Men Don't Wear
Plaid,""The Man With Two Brains,"" All Of Me,"" Summer Rental,""Bert Rigby,
You're A Fool." As a father, he produced, with his wife's
help,writer-director Rob Reiner. Quite a record.</P>
<P>"That Old Feeling" is the worst movie Carl Reiner has directed, probably
the only bad one. With his writer he pathetically attempts to do a sort of
screwball comedy with old-fashioned tricks and modern morals, but keeps
driving in the wrong direction in a one-way street. And when streets
change, the turns are missed.</P>
<P>The picture tries to juggle three married pairs.Lilly (Midler) is a movie
star who can't stop acting. She divorced writer Dan (Farina) 14 years ago,
following his affair with Rowena (O'Grady), whom Dan then married. Lilly
remarried too, Alan (Rasche) a dimwit psychobabbling writer.The two women
loathe each other, keep referring to each other's abundant plastic
surgeries.At least Rowena tells Dan: "I'm not neurotic, I'm a bitch."</P>
<P>The "new" couples meet at the wedding of Lilly's and Dan's daughter Molly
(Marshall) and Keith (Denton) who is running for Congress. At the reception
Rowena and Lilly insult each other copiously. Then Lilly and Dan first make
a spectacle of themselves in a loud fight. But when  Molly exiles them to
the parking lot, they switch with irrational suddenness from curses to
desire and make love (mercifully off-screen) inside a car. Why a small auto
instead when so many large ones are available is another of the many
wet-firecracker jokes.</P>
<P>Tedious complications follow. Paparazzo Joey is added to the active list in
scenes which, even if you close your eyes, instantly telegraph that he will
replace Keith in Molly's affections. No surprises here or anywhere else.</P>
<P>In this terminally ill movie the cracks in the plot multiply and widen, the
verbal cracks are bloodless, unwitty and unmemorable. The pedestrian
dialogue goes, along with most situations and characterizations, from
vulgar to coarse. The slow action is unfunny, forced and colorless.</P>
<P>A romantic and/or screwball comedy cannot work without at least two
likable, charismatic, interesting or, at a minimum, amusing characters. No
one fills that bill.</P>
<P>There's one-half of a star worth  of nice oldies on the soundtrack. Among
them:  "Anything Goes, " "Our Love Is Here To Stay," "Call Me
Irresponsible," "That Old Feeling," "Where Or When," "At Last," "That Old
Feeling."</P>
<P>This film was not released, it escaped.</P>
