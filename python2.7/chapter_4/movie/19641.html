<P>         To that short list of things money can't buy, let's add
"fright." After all, as too many of us found out last week, the multiple
millions of dollars spent on "The Haunting" produced only a
great-looking, utterly ridiculous mess instead of a world-class shocker.</P>
<P>         On the other hand, "The Blair Witch Project," which cost a mere
$60,000, is a nerve-wracking study of the psychology of fear that's
doesn't need computer-generated special effects or digital stereo
screams to give viewers the shudders. Instead, "Witch" writer-directors
Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have pulled off the trick of turning
their lack of resources into an asset. The movie's unfinished,
catch-as-catch-can look, complete with jiggly camerawork and sometimes
blurred imagery, is one of the primary reasons it's so disturbing and
creepy.</P>
<P> "Witch" purports to be an assemblage of the film and video shot
by three student filmmakers who ventured deep into the Maryland woods in
1994 in search of material for a project they were planning about "the
Blair Witch," a legendary figure locals have blamed over the years for
mysterious disappearances and murders. The Witch is described by one
source as being uncommonly hairy, by another as "an old woman whose feet
never touch the ground."</P>
<P> At first, the trio of young documentarians mock these theories
and spend a good deal of their time fooling around and teasing each
other. Even when they lose their way in the forest, Heather, the
unofficial leader of the group, assures her cohorts they'll "all look
back on this and laugh heartily."</P>
<P> Instead, their circumstances become increasingly more serious,
even perilous. Mysterious piles of rocks appear around their campsite,
indecipherable noises surround them in the night, cryptic symbols are
found and the leafless tree branches begin to look like skeletal fingers
reaching out for the three intruders. What started off as a weekend of
fun begins to look like "Road Rules: The Death Trip."</P>
<P> Myrick and Sanchez understand that what frightens audiences is
not what they see, but what they don't see. In its use of shadow, sound
and suggestion, "Witch" recalls the classic Val Lewton films of the
1940s, such as "Cat People," "Isle of the Dead" and "The Seventh
Victim." Myrick and Sanchez create a wholly believable atmosphere of
tension and bewilderment that proves to be much scarier than any amount
of blood or gore could be.</P>
<P> In another offbeat move, Myrick and Sanchez have given their
characters the same names as the actors playing them -- Heather Donahue,
Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams -- and the stars' naturalistic
performances and seemingly improvised dialogue lend the tale an eerie
authenticity. Particularly chilling is Donahue's taped confession when
she realizes she doesn't know nearly as much as she thought she did.
It's a scene that's almost too wrenching to watch.</P>
<P> Shot entirely on video and 16mm film, "Witch" is presented in a
constrained format that takes up only about half the total space on a
movie screen. That's a brilliant move on the part of the directors since
it makes us feel trapped right alongside the would-be filmmakers. We see
only what they see, -- and it becomes clear why they're terrified. James
