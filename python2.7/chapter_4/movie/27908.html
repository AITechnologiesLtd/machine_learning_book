DINNER AND A MOVIE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In writer/director Lisa Kors's DINNER AND A MOVIE, Katie Semelhack 
(Marianne Hagan) has great plans for her 9 part documentary on Aleksandr 
Solzhenitsyn.  A terribly unsuccessful but determined 31-year-old 
redhead, she just needs funding.  Since her father, played wonderfully 
by the late Paul Bartel (EATING RAOUL) in his last picture, is trying to 
get her to pay back her student loan from him, she can't turn to him for 
money.  Instead she looks to the local Pittsfield, Massachusetts PBS 
station for her backing.</P>
<P>As luck would have it, PBS producer Arlene (Barbara Gulan) is looking 
for a documentarian, only she wants this person to make a reality based 
show on dating to be called "Dinner and a Movie."  Arlene describes it 
as, "a scorching exposé of the local dating scene."  Still not over the 
breakup of her last relationship -- 3 years ago! -- Katie thinks that 
she is the last person who should be picked for this assignment, but she 
really needs the cash and reluctantly agrees.</P>
<P>For the male subject, Arlene thinks she has just the right hunk in mind 
with Jed (Dave Gibbs), who turns out to be a loquacious guy with an 
oversized ego.  Katie can't stand Jed and neither can her cameraman, 
Spider (Mike Dooly).  Spider is an old friend of Katie's who is clearly 
still sweet on her.  As Jed turns off one woman after another on a 
series of disastrous dates, Katie, of course, begins to get sweet on 
him, which makes for a cute love triangle among Katie, Jed and Spider.  
Turning to psychological textbooks with articles like "Corralling the 
Marlboro Man," she tries to change Jed's personality so that some woman 
will finally like him.   </P>
<P>The brightly written script got lots of laughs from our audience.  
Everyone will have their favorite parts in this very entertaining film, 
but mine comes when Jed sings Emily Dickinson poems to the tune from 
Gilligan's Island.  Jed claims that all of her poems can be sung to the 
tune.  I believe him.</P>
<P>DINNER AND A MOVIE runs a fast and funny 1:25.  It is not rated but 
would probably be PG.  It has nothing to offend anyone of any age 
although one would probably have to be at least 9 to be interested in 
the material.</P>
