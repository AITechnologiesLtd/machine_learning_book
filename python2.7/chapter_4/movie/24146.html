THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY
(IL BUONO, IL BRUTTO, IL CATTIVO)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Even in the heavenly realm of the Best Movies Ever Made
there are titles that happen to be more obscure than others.
THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is one of them. For most of
the people it is nothing more than a cool title. Obscurity
of this film is easy to explain - it was made decades ago,
its length is epic and it belongs to the much despised genre
of spaghetti westerns. Most of the people would have trouble
connecting words like "spaghetti western" and "epic", unless
director in charge happens to be Sergio Leone. THE GOOD, THE
BAD AND THE UGLY, made in 1966, represents the final segment
in his celebrated Man With No Name movie trilogy.</P>
<P>Unlike most of the final segments in movie trilogies, THE
GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY might be viewed as a prequel to
first two films - A FISTFULL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW
DOLLARS MORE. The plot is set in American Southwest during
the Civil War. Tuco Ramirez (played by Eli Wallach) is a
Mexican bandit with a bounty on his head. That means that he
is targeted by many bounty hunters and similar shady
characters interested in quick cash. The smartest of them
all is Man With No Name a.k.a. Blondie (played by Clint
Eastwood) who not only manages to capture Tuco but also
finds a way to make him more profitable. After handing Tuco
over to authorities, Blondie arranges his escapes, shares
the prize money and repeats the scheme in the next county.
After a while, the partnership goes sour and Tuco is left in
the desert without a penny. Furious Tuco begins tracking
down his former partner, but before he gets his revenge, an
unusual set of events would cause him to reconsider. Both
Tuco and Blondie find out about huge pile of stolen
Confederate gold, but each of them knows only a part of the
exact location. So, two of them decide to set aside the past
differences and strike another partnership in order to get
their hands on the gold. However, before they find this
treasure, they must face the battling armies that stand in
their way. But the deadlier obstacle to their plans comes in
the form of Angel Eyes (named Sentenza in Italian version,
played by Lee Van Cleef), ruthless but efficient
professional killer who also knows about the hidden gold.</P>
<P>Same as in the first two parts of the trilogy Sergio Leone
paints a revisionist picture of the Old West. Instead of
using its primordial state as the perfect setting for the
archetypal and simplistic fight between Good and Evil, Leone
shows Old West as a place where the lack of civilisation
leads to the utter lack of morality. Friendship, loyalty,
common decency and even the human life means nothing in this
world; its characters are guided only with their most
primordial instinct or, as it is much evident here, pure
greed. Therefore, the line that separates heroes from
villains in this piece is blurred - they all have the same
motives and same lack of scruples. Such moral ambiguity is
underlined even in the title of the film, quite ironic in
the context of the story and its characters. Leone used such
motives in the first two films, but this time it gives it
another dimension. The story is set in the broader context
of American Civil War and the murderous quest by three major
protagonists is dwarfed by the sheer amount of carnage and
destruction that goes around them. In their quest for the
gold they might kill dozens of people, but the war kills
thousands. Leone's pacifist and anti- militarist stance in
this movie was not just in tune with the opposition towards
Vietnam War, quite popular stance among late 1960s European
intellectuals. It was also inspired by the events in
European past that found way to reflect them in this film.
The movie was shot on location in Spain, country which
endured its own civil war, with atrocities and destruction
not very different from those depicted in some of the
movie's most memorable scenes. The battle scene in the film,
although one of the most spectacular in the history of
western and although it features uniforms weapons and
military equipment of 1860s America, is actually more
inspired by the traumatic experiences of Italian military in
20th Century, especially WW1 and utter pointlessness and
bloodbath symbolised in twelve Battles of Isonzo 1915-17.</P>
<P>Background of Civil War not only puts moral alignment of the
characters in another context, it also gives opportunity for
Leone to paint brighter or darker shades in their
characters. Epic scope of the story allows Leone to also
give some hints about their background. In doing that, Leone
is playing with old western conventions. Angel Eyes is named
Bad solely because he wears black hat; only later we see
finally justify that perception when we see him as ruthless
and sadistic. Lee Van Cleef obviously enjoyed playing this
role, so different from righteous Colonel Mortimer from FOR
A FEW DOLLARS MORE; there was only one good thing about
Angel Eyes - he always adhered to his own code of
professional killer. Clint Eastwood, the star of this
vehicle plays the character which is the only link with two
other films. Since this is a prequel, there is a little
place for some evolution of the character. Eastwood is great
as usual, playing the same immoral yet capable, intelligent
character we enjoyed seeing in first two films. There is,
however, some opportunities for Eastwood to show some subtle
hints about his character's humanity, especially in the last
segments of the film. Eastwood and Van Cleef are, however,
dwarfed by the third major actor - Eli Wallach who found the
role of his career in Tuco. Unlike the previous Mexican
bandit role he had played in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, Wallach
gives great texture to his character. His Tuco is neurotic,
clumsy, not very bright and he would be considered a
laughing stock without his deadliness with pistols. By the
usual western standards, he is not very nice person, but
Wallach finds a way to make him likeable to the audience. In
the end, even Leone gives opportunity to this character to
tell his side of the story, in a memorable verbal exchange
with his brother, played by Luigi Pistilli. This scene not
only features Tuco's humanity, but also gives opportunity
for Leone to implement his Marxist views in showing the
poverty as the major cause of the crime.</P>
<P>Apart from the actors (including the supporting cast), THE
GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, excels in flawless direction.
With this film Sergio Leone finally matured as serious movie
artist and developed his own style which many critics called
"baroque". The film lasts more than two and a half hours
(even longer in Italian version), but not a single scene
looks unnecessary or overlong. Leone's directorial skills
are at his finest, and he is equally effective in long
panoramic shots (which lose much of its impact on TV, being
subjected to pan&scan butchery) and his trademark short
extreme close-up. Superb editing mixes those elements in
perfect combination. But the most memorable element is, of
course, the music. Ennio Morricone, in his long and
hyperproductive career worked with many directors, but none
of them used his talents as much as Leone. Entire scenes in
the film are staged around Morricone's music, and not the
other way around. Those themes are not self- serving - they
provide the atmosphere of the film and, according to each
scene, this atmosphere might be sentimental, melodramatic
and sometimes even ironic (including the title theme, most
recognisable, which gives humorous angle to certain events
on the screen). Morricone's soundtrack is one the most
powerful in the history cinema and it alone is the reason
why this film should be so highly appreciated.</P>
