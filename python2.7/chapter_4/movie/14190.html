                          WHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE?
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1998</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:   Halle Berry, Vivica Fox, Lela Rochon, Larenz Tate,

RATED/YEAR: R/1998</PRE>
<PRE>                   RATING: *** 1/2 (out of a possible *****)</PRE>
<P>        Give Gregory Nava and Tina Andrews an "A" for effort.  If "Why Do
Fools Fall in Love?" isn't completely successful, it's only because the
creators' vision is too grand for the constraints of a two-hour movie.
The film tries to be everything: a mystery, a comedy, a drama, a love
story, a documentary, a character study, a concert film.  That's a tall
order, but what's remarkable is how close Nava and Andrews come to
actually pulling it off.  The movie is compelling; even if portions of it
are slightly uneven, it remains solid (and touching) entertainment.</P>
<P>        The film is based on the life of Frankie Lymon, the teen
singer who hit the Top Ten with "Why Do Fools Fall in Love?", a catchy
tune he penned with one of his schoolmates.  Rendered obsolete by the
British Invasion after a brief flash of stardom, Frankie descended into
drug abuse, poverty, and obscurity.  Several years later, having never
regained his former fame, he died of a heroin overdose.  He was only 26
at the time.</P>
<P>        We can all agree that this tale is a tragedy, but an additional
factor makes Lymon's story even more fascinating: he left behind three
women, all claiming to be his wife... and none realising they weren't
alone in this claim.  Since Frankie's music publisher owes the Lymon
estate an estimated four million dollars in back payments, it's easy to
understand why each woman wants to be named his heir.</P>
<P>        Contrary to the romantic-comedy impression projected by the
movie's trailer, "Why Do Fools Fall in Love?" is basically a courtroom
drama focusing on the three wives' attempts to prove their cases.  Along
the way, we'll see numerous flashbacks of each woman's memories of
Frankie, which, although contradictory, help to show us different facets
of who he was.  But we know the truth is buried somewhere in their
testimonies, which is exactly why the story is so interesting.</P>
<P>        We learn via flashback of Frankie's early days and success, and
see first-hand how charming he could be... as well as his darker, more
manipulative side.  Perhaps most importantly, we witness just how
valueable music was to him.  Lymon didn't sing for the money; he sang
because his soul demanded it.  In these early concert scenes, Lymon
(flawlessly portrayed by Larenz Tate) is energetic.  He doesn't so much
SING the music as CHANNEL it to the audience.  His happiness is so
apparent, his joy for performing so all-encompassing and contagious, that
even if you don't like his songs, you'll respect the attitude with which
he shares them.</P>
<P>        The film skips nimbly through the thirteen years encompassing
Frankie's first brush of success, his relationship with all three women,
and the circumstances leading up to his death.  Occasionally, important
details are glossed over (Frankie reportedly causes a "national scandal"
by dancing with a white girl on television... but what are the exact
details and repurcussions?), but on the whole, things move along at a
pleasantly brisk clip.  There's no time to get bored while Frankie's on
the screen.</P>
<P>        The flashback footage is effective, and does a great job of
capturing the frantic early days of rock and roll.  The costumes,
hairstyles and scenery are a sight to behold, and seeing them through
Frankie's eyes, we're caught up in the wonder and excitement of a by-gone
era.  Because of this intimate portrait, we're able to sympathize with
him when his career goes sour.  I was impressed and surprised by how much
the filmmakers made me care about him.</P>
<P>        The film's photography is not without artistry, either.  Remember
those incredible transitions in "Titanic," used to simulate the passage
of years?  Well, "Why Do Fools..." employs one such moment that's the
equal of anything in Cameron's epic.  It's the 80s, during the trial.
Little Richard (in a scene-stealing cameo) is on the witness stand,
discussing his friendship with the late Mr. Lymon.  As Richard talks about
the days he spent on the road with Frankie, the camera slowly pans over to
a nearby window... but the sights outside are clearly those of 1955.  We
zoom outside, revealing a large auditorium.  Displayed proudly on the
marquee: "TONIGHT ONLY!  LITTLE RICHARD!  THE PLATTERS!  FRANKIE LYMON AND
THE TEENAGERS!"  Excited teens hurry into the theater, and after a moment,
so do we.  The camera "runs" along, just another excited teen, as we dash
into the auditorium and discover The Platters on stage.  The camera spins
around, giving us a full view of the crowded theater; then, we're swept
onto the stage.  We drift over to the wings where we discover the young
Frankie, waiting to go on.  After a moment, The Platters conclude their
lovely song, and Lymon hits the stage.  We're right there with him as he
and The Teenagers, his backing group, perform a show-stopping rendition
of "Baby Baby."  The camera swoops dramatically around the group in a
grand circle, and there we remain until the song's conclusion.  Frankie
waves to the audience, then he's off the stage... and only then do we
realise that all these events, beginning with Little Richard's appearance
on the witness stand, were depicted via one single unbroken shot.  It's
one of the most memorable camera movements I've ever seen, seamlessly
bridging twenty years of American history without so much as a jump cut.</P>
<P>        So exciting are these scenes that the courtroom story becomes a
bit of a bore.  It doesn't help that the three women are clearly only
after Frankie's money; even in the flashback scenes, with the exception
of his third wife, Emira (Lela Rochon), none of the women truly seem to
love him.  Frankie's first wife, Zola Taylor (Halle Berry), is too hung
up on her career to give him much time (she's a vocalist for The
Platters).  Second wife Elizabeth (Vivica Fox) honestly seems to prefer
her dog.  Frankie and Emira, on the other hand, have a strong chemistry
when they're on-screen together.  She's sweet, unassuming, and cares
deeply for Frankie; in turn, he worships her and uses her presence as an
inspiration to clean up his act... or at least try.  Unfortunately,
Emira's last line in the movie capsizes the whole illusion.  Greed
corrupts everyone in the end, apparently.</P>
<P>        One thing that initially bothered me about the film was the fact
that Frankie's personality is never concretely defined.  Since we get to
know him only through the eyes of three self-serving women, there is an
abundance of confusion, contradictions, and accusations.  Why does Frankie
feel the need to marry three women?  We don't know; even at the time of
his death, the matter is left wide open.  This disappointed me as I left
the theater, but having mulled the matter over at some length, I no
longer think that way.  The story is told through the rememberences of
three women; since THEY don't know the games Frankie was playing, it
occurred to me that the movie CAN'T convey the answer.  Not only is this
not a flaw, as I originally thought, but it actually adds a degree of
realism uncommon in a biographical film.  Director Nava and screenwriter
Andrews were wise not to make Frankie into a saint.  He may be a shadowy,
mysterious person, but through this movie (and their reverence), I feel
that I know him a little better.</P>
<P>        One final note.  The day after seeing this film, I bought the
"Frankie Lymon's Greatest Hits" CD.  As I've grown familiar with these
tunes, I've realised that this movie is probably unneccessary: we don't
need a biography on Lymon to discover who he is, because everything you
need to know about him is in his voice and his music.  The women, the
the drugs, the financial setbacks... none of that matters.  In a hundred
years, Frankie Lymon won't be remembered for anything but his sweet voice,
his incredible showmanship, and a talent which self-destructed all too
quickly beneath the pressures of public life.  Today, for the first time,
I mourn a true rock and roll original.</P>
<PRE>        Thanks for the music, Frankie.</PRE>
