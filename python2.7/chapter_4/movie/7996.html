<PRE>                      PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4 = good)
1987, R, 93 minutes [1 hour, 33 minutes]
[comedy]
starring: Steve Martin (Neil Page), John Candy (Del Griffith), written,
produced, and directed by John Hughes.</P>
<P>"Plane, Trains, And Automobiles" is a great bonding movie about two
completely opposite strangers that, through a series of strange coincidences
that seem perfectly logical, keep bumping into each other and driving each
other crazy.</P>
<P>The story starts off simple enough: Neil (Martin), an ad executive from
Chicago on a business trip to New York, eagerly awaits a client's approval of
his project (immediately Hughes' world of fantastic satire makes itself
clear). Next we see Neil running around the streets of New York trying to
find a cab during rush hour. And just as it seems he has found one, someone
steals it! Later at the airport, Neil recognizes the thief, who is
surprisingly apologetic and seems kind. He introduces himself as Del
Griffith, a shower curtain ring salesman who is constantly anxious and can't
keep quiet. </P>
<P>Like magnets, Neil and Del keep coming together, almost as if fate won't let
them separate. They end up sitting next to each other on the plane, and even
end up sleeping in the same bed in the same hotel room that night. I won't
explain how that happens because it would kill the point of the comedy.
Hughes' story is so charming, and the acting so convincing we never once
question the reality of any of the plot devices.</P>
<P>The chemistry between Martin and Candy at times upstages Hughes' script and
direction, because it's a relationship that really can't be written. Candy's
happy-go-lucky attitude is countered by Martin's cynicism and acid tongue.
Consider the situation of the two being stuck in the same hotel room: while
Del enjoys a beer, Neil showers to a faulty water system and is left with
only a washcloth to dry himself with. And to top it off, the two must sleep
in the same bed soaked with beer because it didn't occur to Del that leaving
a six pack of beer on a vibrating bed might cause contents under pressure.
Even more hilarity ensues when the two wake up the next morning in one of the
funniest and most clever situations I've ever seen.</P>
<P>Why is fate so cruel to these poor guys? While at the hotel they are robbed,
then travel 30 miles in the freezing cold to a train station only to have the
train break down and then take a bus full of even more characters.</P>
<P>The last act is the best even though it takes place mostly in a car. The two
rent a car and try to drive home, but as if the comedy had not already been
off the wall, it becomes even more zany. Even dropping hints would 
give too much away, but let's just say whatever hasn't happened to Neil and
Del probably will by the film's end.</P>
<P>We'll probably never go through such wacky adventures as Neil and Del, but
"Planes, Trains, And Automobiles" is so fun to watch you'll wish the same
things would happen to you. </P>
<P>[Note: This film could have been rated PG had it not been for a 1-minute
scene in which Martin's character rattles off the "F" word many times. The
film would be appropriate for children 13 and up.]</P>
