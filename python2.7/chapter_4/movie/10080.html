Screenplay: Andrew Niccol </P>
<P>"Gattaca" represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of 
science-fiction films -- it's a genre picture that doesn't rely on alien 
creatures or loud explosions to tell its story. The movie takes place in a 
futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not 
sexual reproduction. This allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color, 
intelligence and life span they'd like for their child, and also eliminates most 
pesky chances of health defects. Those made the old-fashioned way are labeled as 
"in-valids" and confined to the lower rung of society. </P>
<P>Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) is one such person, born not too long before the 
genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie 
dish-molded younger brother Anton. Fed up with being second-rate and enchanted by 
dreams of one day traveling through space, Vincent leaves home and takes a 
janitorial position at the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation. Everyday, he watches as 
"superior" folk make his fantasy a reality. Determined to do the same, Vincent 
meets a DNA broker (Tony Shalhoub in a funny cameo) who sells fake identities to 
in-valids. His counterpart for this scam is Jerome Morrow (Jude Law), an 
ex-athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life. </P>
<P>For a price and the promise of a caretaker, Jerome supplies Vincent with his 
identity, as well as blood, skin and urine samples for all of those pesky 
on-the-job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees 
clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card. Because of 
his drastically improved status, Vincent is quickly propelled to a high position 
in Gattaca, and catches the eye of comely co-worker Irene (Uma Thurman) on the 
way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect, she's enamored by his flawless 
persona she doesn't know is a lie. But on the figurative eve of his upcoming 
planetary departure, the mission director is murdered. Two ardent detectives 
(Alan Arkin and Billy Bathgate's Loren Dean) determine the killer is on the 
inside of Gattaca, and the sole clue they find at the crime scene -- one of 
Vincent's eyelashes -- threatens to blow Vincent's cover and derail his goal. </P>
<P>Even if "Gattaca" were dramatically empty, it would still boast a sublime set of 
production credentials -- the film's look is dazzling without ever being flashy. 
First-time director/writer Andrew Niccol (he also wrote the screenplay for the 
upcoming Jim Carrey drama "The Truman Show") demonstrates a keen eye for the 
stylish; his collaboration with cinematographer Slawomir Idziak, production 
designer Jan Roelfs and costume designer Colleen Atwood result in a sophisticated 
composition that emanates classy, retro ambiance. An opening credits sequence -- 
where skin, nail and hair fragments fall in slow-motion through a colored camera 
lens -- displays these combined talents uncannily. Niccol even utilizes 
voice-over narration (a device almost always poorly-employed) in an effective 
way. </P>
<P>When it comes to acting, the movie is also flawless. Ethan Hawke does magnificent 
work, proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high 
charisma level. His chemistry with Thurman is a bit on the icy side, but 
needfully so, adding to the setting's clinical chill. As the bitter Jerome, Jude 
Law has a star-making presence, and it's his scenes with Hawke that give the 
movie its fine emotional core. In "Gattaca"'s series of final shots, the fates of 
Vincent and Jerome are superimposed over each other, and the effect is sad, 
lyrical and beautiful. Things get a little strange as the movie nears its climax, 
when Vincent's relationship with his brother comes back into view. The big 
dramatic culmination is a swim race, which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully 
photographed. </P>
<P>Still, the single most surprising aspect of Gattaca is its use of backdrop -- 
it's successful sci-fi without showy special effects, it's a crisp thriller with 
character-driven thrills, it's a futuristic fable without blood and guts. Even 
its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot, ensuring that a smart 
story about smart people and smart science takes center stage. Although it's 
portrayal of the upcoming century is grim, "Gattaca" serves up one of the most 
thought-provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film. </P>
