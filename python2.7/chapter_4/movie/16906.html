<P>8mm (1999) 1 star out of 4. Starring Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix.</P>
<P> You come out of some movies scratching your head, wondering what the
studio was thinking by green-lighting the project or what possessed an
actor to sign on with such a fiasco.</P>
<PRE> 8mm is one of those movies.</PRE>
<P> This new thriller, starring Nicolas Cage, is overlong, slow, violent,
nasty and unredeeming.</P>
<P> 8mm sputters along, nearly running out of steam before it even gets started.</P>
<P> Cage plays Tom Welles, a private investigator hired by the widow of a
recently deceased industrialist to discover the truth behind a snuff film
found among her late husband's effects.</P>
<P> The investigation leads Welles, a devoted family man with a wife and baby
daughter, into the darkest, scummiest corners of the pornography
underground.
Once there, Welles must use all his will to overcome the obstacles thrown
in his path as well as keep from drifting away from what he holds most
dear.</P>
<P> Cage, at least through the first three-quarters of 8mm, seems catatonic.
He is passive and languid, rarely showing any spark.</P>
<P> It is only when the movie shifts mode from a mystery to a revenge
melodrama that Cage shows some life. But it is not enough to lift this
yawner out of its doldrums.</P>
<P> Only Joaquin Phoenix as the streetwise Max, who introduces Welles to the
squalor and horror of the porno underground, shows any flashes of character
and humor. But, again, it is not enough to compensate for the film's
malaise.</P>
<P> Director Joel Schumacher can't seem to do anything with the material. But
that is what one can expect from the individual who nearly destroyed the
Batman franchise. Working from a script by Andrew Kevin Walker, Schumacher
fails to bring any originality or verve to the proceedings.</P>
<P> 8mm chugs along like an overloaded freight trying to climb a steep grade.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, we have to come along for the ride.</P>
<P> 8mm is a movie destined for a quick video transfer.</P>
