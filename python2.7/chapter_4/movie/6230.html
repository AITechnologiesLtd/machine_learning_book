<P>"A man, the microcosmic fool, down in his soul
Is wont to think himself a whole,
But I'm part of the Part which at the first was all,
Part of the Darkness that gave birth to Light,
The haughty Light that now with Mother Night
Disputes her ancient rank and space withal,
And yet 'twill not succeed, since, strive as strive it may,
Fettered to bodies will Light stay."
     -- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, "Faust"</P>
<P>     No one is likely to question the inherent greatness of Kurt 
Vonnegut's work, whether the novel in question is SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, 
MOTHER NIGHT, BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS, or something else.  Even an 
incomplete survey of his books makes it clear why Graham Greene called 
him "one of the best living American writers" and why the NEW YORK TIMES 
labeled him "a true artist."  Nevertheless, the writings of top authors 
don't always translate effectively to the motion picture medium, as 
MOTHER NIGHT illustrates.  The material dealt with in the novel -- 
guilt, perception, and identity -- is heavy, powerful stuff.  Director 
Keith Gordon's (A MIDNIGHT CLEAR) handling of it, however, is uncertain, 
and, on at least one occasion, seriously flawed.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, because the premise and storyline are so compelling, 
it's impossible not to be drawn in, at least on some level, by MOTHER 
NIGHT.  In fact, for the first forty-five minutes, it's an example of 
solid, albeit stylistically unconventional, film making.  Then comes 
Gordon's serious miscalculation, and, in a matter of minutes, all of the 
carefully-developed characters and situations collapse in a jumble of 
poorly-realized, surreal satire.  MOTHER NIGHT eventually recovers from 
this misstep for a thought-provoking ending, but the bad taste lingers.</P>
<P>     MOTHER NIGHT takes place in two different time periods -- World War 
II Germany and early '60s Israel.  Borrowing a page from MRS. PARKER AND 
THE VICIOUS CIRCLE, the "present-day" scenes are in black-and-white, 
while the flashbacks (which make up more than two-thirds of the 
material) are in color.  Nick Nolte plays Howard W. Campbell Jr., an 
American transplanted to Germany during his youth.  Years later, 
Campbell, a successful playwright, is recruited by a mysterious United 
States government operative (John Goodman) to go under cover as a secret 
agent.  Seduced by the romance of the idea, Campbell allows himself to 
be swept along by the surging tide of Nazi propaganda, and, in the guise 
of a pro-Hitler radio commentator, he provides encoded information to 
the Allies.  His anti-Semitic speeches are so inflammatory, however, 
that everyone views Campbell as an upper-echelon Nazi.  Members of the 
party congratulate him on his great work, and his social circle includes 
the likes of Goebels and Hoess.  When the war ends, he faces trial -- 
and possibly execution -- for war crimes, because those elements of the 
U.S. government that recruited him refuse to acknowledge his status.</P>
<P>     Questions of identity lie at the heart of MOTHER NIGHT.  As 
Campbell warns in his voice-over narrative, "We are what we pretend to 
be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be."  His appearance 
as an anti-Semite does at least as much to forward the Nazi cause as it 
does to help the United States.  Eventually, Campbell has to face the 
issue of whether the gains from his time under cover justify all the 
damage he does.  As Adolf Eichmann informs him in a critical scene, 
"About those 6 million [dead Jews] -- I don't need credit for all of 
them.  I can spare a few for you."  In Goethe's "Faust", from which 
Vonnegut took the title, MOTHER NIGHT, Mephistopheles asserts that there 
can be no light without darkness.  Here, Campbell must ponder how 
inextricably the good in his actions is dependent upon the evil.  After 
all, had he not stirred up the hatred against Jews, he wouldn't have 
been trusted enough to possess the sensitive information that he passed 
on to the U.S. government.</P>
<P>     In developing Campbell's story, Gordon sets a staid, somber tone 
that remains in effect until the story skips ahead to the early 1960s, 
where Campbell is eking out an anonymous existence in New York City.  A 
group of white supremacists learns his identity and comes to pay 
tribute.  Suddenly, instead of real characters, we're given ill-defined 
caricatures.  Indeed, the film's entire tone becomes satirical and 
falsely comic.  It's a jarring, off-putting transition.  The intention 
of this approach is to avoid glamorizing neo-Nazis, but the result lends 
an aura of artificiality to portions of MOTHER NIGHT.  For a parallel, 
consider how much weaker SCHINDLER'S LIST would have been had Ralph 
Fiennes' character not been so horrifyingly three-dimensional.  
Trivializing evil doesn't make it less appealing -- it just makes it 
less believable.</P>
<P>     Following in the wake of his work for MULHOLLAND FALLS, Nolte's 
performance here can only be considered a step up.  For the most part, 
he finds the right tone, although Campbell is typically kept at an arm's 
distance from the audience.  Early in the film, Nolte gives us a cocky, 
passionate man.  Later, as the scene shifts from Germany to America and 
Israel, he shows us a world-weary, morally uncertain person who views 
life as an aimless journey through purgatory.</P>
<P>     Sheryl Lee, forever doomed to be known as TWIN PEAKS' Laura Palmer, 
has a pivotal role as Campbell's lovely German wife, Helga.  Her 
importance to his rise and fall cannot be underestimated.  As one Nazi 
official says of their relationship, "If that woman walked off a cliff, 
I swear Howard would follow her."  Lee's performance, however, is 
variable.  She's very good at the beginning, but her effectiveness 
diminishes as questions arise about who Helga really is.</P>
<P>     Another character with more than one face is George Kraft, a lonely 
painter played by veteran actor Alan Arkin.  Other supporting performers 
include Kirsten Dunst (INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE) as Helga's younger 
sister, Arye Gross (A MIDNIGHT CLEAR) as a Jewish doctor, David 
Strathairn (DOLORES CLAIBORNE) as the American soldier who captures 
Campbell after the war, and Frankie Faison (THE STUPIDS) as a black neo-
Nazi.  LAUGH-IN regular Henry Gibson supplies the disembodied voice of 
Eichmann.</P>
<P>     Gordon gives us a number of scenes laced with irony, such as Bing 
Crosby's rendition of "White Christmas" playing while the screen holds 
an image of the Israeli flag, or a romantic interlude between Campbell 
and his wife while Hitler's voice can be heard ranting in the 
background.  However, these, and other, notable stylistic moments can't 
eclipse the central flaw.  Ultimately, MOTHER NIGHT is one of those 
films that it's more rewarding to talk about than see.</P>
