<P>Are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny?
Director/writer Brad Anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions
in his witty film "Next Stop Wonderland". The two main characters, Alan
and Erin, spend the entire movie in each other's orbit, catching
glimpses of one another, yet not quite connecting until the inevitable
conclusion. Is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately
puts them together? Does this predestination carry over to all aspects
of life?</P>
<P>As the film starts, Erin Castleton (Hope Davis), a melancholy 29- year
old late shift nurse, is ending her live-in relationship with her
boyfriend (Hoffman). Rather, he is ending it with her. Arriving home
from work, Erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment,
car packed with his belongings. In a fumbling, amusing and self
deluding ramble, he instructs Erin to watch a videotape he's made
detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why he's
leaving. It's obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as
he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a
stand, all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship. He
then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief.</P>
<P>Erin's mother (Holland Taylor, in a surprisingly effective, small
role), fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her
life,takes out a personal ad for Erin. To Erin's embarrassed horror,
the ad describes her as a "frisky, cultured, carefree professional with
a zest for life". Eventually, Erin responds to the tidal wave of
responses, which makes for some of the most humorous, telling moments
of the movie as she meets prospective suitors and "poseurs".</P>
<P>Alan, a plumber and aspiring marine biologist, first spots Erin as he's
cleaning the inside glass of a fish tank at the Boston aquarium.
Wearing a wet suit and goggles, he follows Erin from window to window,
separated by the glass as Erin, oblivious to his gaze, enjoys the fish.
Later, we see him on a train as she sits on a platform outside, mere
feet away. The movie spends it's entirety having their paths circle
each other without crossing.</P>
<P>There are several subplots involving Alan. One concerns his attempts to
get on the job track at the Boston Aquarium, thereby escaping his
apparent fate to carry on the family plumbing business. Another subplot
involves his father's desperate attempts to force fate's hand by
gambling away his life at the dog track. A distracting focus is put on
Alan's debt to a loan shark and the manner in which he pays it off. The
movie tries too hard to make Alan a likable guy. Thankfully, his dream-
guy persona is counterbalanced by Erin's distant, yet fundamentally
hopeful, personality.</P>
<P>The film moves along at an unhurried pace, albeit too much so in the
latter third, as we wait for the two to meet. Co-writers Anderson and
Lyn Vaus throw a couple of possible red herrings into the mix as the
two find other possible relationships. The films shifts into a much
slower gear as we wait for these romances to blow over.</P>
<P>When Alan and Erin eventually do meet, we see that perhaps they both
were destined for each other as they share a lingering, almost
subliminally knowing, gaze. It's a sweet, measured moment. The
disappointment comes in the fact that we've come to know the pair, yet
we don't get to view their impending romance.</P>
<P>The film's inherent belief in the subtle persistence of fate and the
wonder it can bring to one's life makes "Next Stop Wonderland" a quiet
pleasure in a cinematic landscape littered with explosions, shallow
characters and overdone special effects.</P>
