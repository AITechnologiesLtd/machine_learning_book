<PRE>                            I LIKE IT LIKE THAT
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This comedy-drama set in a Spanish
     section of the Bronx tries to hard to reach too broad a
     range of tones and is stretched too thin.  A family
     falling apart and coming together is the subject of
     newcomer writer-director Darnell Martin.  Fewer
     characters better observed would have made for stronger
     drama and less cliched comedy.  Rating: low +1 (-4 to
     +4)</PRE>
<P>     I LIKE IT LIKE THAT is the first major studio film written and
directed by a black woman.  When actually watching the film it
generally flows fairly smoothly, though in retrospect the styles
represented in the film are very much a mixed bag.  To have in a single
film sex scenes verging on slapstick and grim scenes of street violence
makes one wonder if the writer/director, Darnell Martin, was managing
the tone of the film as a whole or in pieces.  It almost seems as if
she was optimizing individual scenes without thinking of the film as a
whole.  The unevenness of tone extends even to the title.  This is a
film with a lot of people at various levels of dissatisfaction which
would much more aptly be titled I HATE IT LIKE THIS</P>
<P>     In a Puerto Rican neighborhood in the Bronx, the street constantly
boils with activity, but nowhere more than the bedroom of Lisette and
Chino (played by Lauren Velez and Jon Seda).  Chino is into marathon
love-making, much to the amusement of the neighborhood and the boredom
of Lisette.  Chino feeds a family of five on a McJob but wants to
provide some luxuries for his family.  A blackout brings what Chino
sees as an opportunity.  Now Lisette has to feed a family of four and
visit a husband in jail on no job at all.  But a rather contrived set
of circumstances gets Lisette a high-paying job in the recording
industry working closely with a slightly sleazy executive (Griffin
Dunne) who is sexually attracted to her.  Rumors of her having been
seen with the executive reach Chino in prison and when he is released
he wants to set matters straight.  What ensues is a comedy-drama of
Lisette's on-again off-again relationship with her husband and the
struggle of the family to pull together.</P>
<P>     At times the film achieves some of the strengths of MARTY as
self-seeking family and friends try to interfere in the relationship of
Lisette and Chino, but with the exception of a surprisingly well-drawn
and acted Li'l Chino, played by ten-year-old Tomas Melly, most of the
peripheral characters are a bit cartoonish.  Griffin Dunne's record
executive is a one-dimensional cliche.  Rita Moreno as Chino's overly
strident mother is magnetic but more in her delivery than in her lines.
Jesse Borego is a bit too swishy and over-the-top as Alex/Alexis,
Lisette's brother, soon to be sister.  Velez's performance as Lisette
is the heart of the story and she does carry the film, though not
always with sufficient help from the script.  One scene of her handling
her tension by suddenly flashing into a dance just does not seem
realistic and Velez handles it as well as any actress could.  Seda only
at times develops a screen presence.</P>
<P>     Martin could well turn out to be a very good director, but her
technique needs refining.  I would give this film a low +1 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
