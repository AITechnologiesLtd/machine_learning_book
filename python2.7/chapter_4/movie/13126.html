<PRE>              MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                    2 :-) :-) for the balance of fate</PRE>
<P>Cast: John Cusack, Kevin Spacey, Jack Thompson, Lady Chablis, Alison
Eastwood, Irma P. Hall, Paul Hipp, Jude Law
Director: Clint Eastwood
Producers: Clint Eastwood, Randy Phillips, Arnold Stiefel
Screenplay: John Lee Hancock based on the novel by John Berendt</P>
<P>This is a movie that leaves its ending up for viewer speculation. The
mystery remains unresolved. Some people may find this style of vagueness
and lack of conclusion annoying. But, we must remember that much of
life's circumstances are a mystery, and no one may truly know the full
motives behind the foul actions of a crime.</P>
<P>In the quiet southern community of Savannah, evil takes root. A wealthy,
eccentric millionaire, Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey) is accused of
murdering a dead hustler (Jude Law) in his mansion – sending shock waves
through the community. Throw in a swig of good southern Voo Doo, about
how good comes a half hour before midnight and evil half past, and
you'll start needing a good swig of lemonade halfway through the movie
to help the crime go down better. Enter journalist and author John Kelso
(John Cusack), who is asked to write a feature article on our infamous
millionaire, but ends up unearthing more black magic and superstition
than he counted on.</P>
<P>The ending leaves one with an unearthly feeling of a graveyard. It makes
one wonder what happens to murderers, rapists and other criminals who
get away with the crime. This movie suggests that you will sow what you
reap, and even if you escape human judgement, beware the hand of fate
that holds the balance of good and evil in her hands. Her judgement may
come as quickly and as suddenly as a heart attack.</P>
<P>Once again, good direction from Clint Eastwood who has paced the movie
well. Kevin Spacey puts in a fine performance as a charming, deceptive
millionaire and John Cusack is believable as a reporter. This movie is
probably not everyone's cup of tea, but great thought provoking material
none the less.</P>
