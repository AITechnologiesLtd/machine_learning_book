<P>If I had to choose one word to describe "Fargo" it would be difficult
(literally); it's difficult to classify its genre, it's difficult to describe
its plot, and most of all it's difficult to explain why it's such an
excellent film. The Coen brothers have once again captured that sense of the
surreal and this time have made it very mainstream, so that as strange as
this film becomes, we never question its logic.
William H. Macy stars as Jerry Lundergaard, a bad car salesman who is
desperate for money and is really pathetic because he is such a bad liar and
not very smart either. The story starts out simple enough as Jerry hires two
goons (in the most literal sense of the term) to kidnap his wife so that when
her father pays the ransom they can split it. Steve Buscemi is hilarious as
Carl Showalter, the slightly smarter of the two goons, while Peter Stormare
is also quite funny as nearly mute Gaear Grimsrud.
The film doesn't put itself forward as any kind of serious, disturbing tale
of greed and crime, but more of a lighthearted drama with overtones of
satire. For example, as Carl and Gaear drive, they have a funny argument over
where to eat. Gaear says, "We stop for pancakes," Carl tells him that they're
going to stop for a steak, but then slowly caves to his partner's demands
even though he hasn't said anything.
The story starts to get a little choppy and confusing concerning Jerry's
deals with his distributor and his father-in-law's investment into a parking
lot system he has organized. Meanwhile, the goons are having a bit of trouble
themselves when they are pulled over by a cop for not having tags on their
licence plates. The scene ends in a triple homicide, and we are then
introduced to Brainerd Police Chief Marge Gundersund, played perfectly by
Frances McDormand with terrific charm. She seems more like a housewife that
happens to be a police officer than vice versa. Marge starts to put the
pieces together with very little clues and it is quite interesting to watch
this type of a story element in a movie that is the furthest thing from a
Hollywood mystery.
>From this point on the plot becomes irrelevant and it is a complete and
total exercise in character study and storytelling. The atmosphere of the
mid-western setting is pure satire in and of itself, because everyone seems
so innocent and naive, saying "Yah" and "'The heck ya mean?" all the time.
Even Jerry's son has a poster of Whitesnake next to "The Accordion King." 
It is the storytelling process that makes the film so excellent. Yes, there
have been other films of more complex storyline involving detective work and
crime, et cetera, but here it is completely different because the story never
takes itself too seriously. 
"Fargo" is an example of great filmmaking in all aspects: original plot;
great acting; good scripting; and excellent direction that brings it all
together and makes it so breezy and enjoyable. This is one of those films
that you like even though you have no idea why.</P>
