<P>1982 was an interesting year that in one way or another, affects the events
surrounding 'Bowfinger'.  One quirky story involved the estate of the late
great Peter Sellers suing those involved with the making of 'Trail of the
Pink Panther'.  The movie was a series of out takes based on old footage
featuring Sellers as Inspector Clouseau from other 'Pink Panther' movies all
strung together with new footage containing other actors to look like a new
adventure based on the Inspector Clouseau legacy.  Since Sellers died in
1980, it looked as if they were trying to make a movie without having to
give any compensation to Sellers himself.  It was also a year where Steve
Martin made 'Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid'.  That film showed Martin
interacting with footage from other movies, for example, those with Humphrey
Bogart to make it look like the old footage and new footage combined made
for a coherent film.  It was also the year that Eddie Murphy made his motion
picture debut in '48 hrs.' which launched a successful movie career for him
It was also the year that Frank Oz made his directing debut with the film
'The Dark Crystal'.</P>
<P>Steve Martin likes to lampoon the film industry and make light of its image
and the culture surrounding it.  His 1991 triumph 'L.A. Story' put the L.A.
lifestyle in the proper perspective and he played a slasher film director in
Lawrence Kasdan's 1991 mediocrity 'Grand Canyon'.  For me, Martin's best
role was opposite Michael Caine in 1988's 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' where
Martin played a bumbling con man who gets more than he bargained for when he
learns to master his art form at the hands of a more experienced thief
played by Caine.</P>
<P>Together for the first time are Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy in
'Bowfinger'.  Surprisingly, Martin plays his part in the film completely
straight.  Murphy is the talent that makes the film work because he plays
two characters that have more in common with each other than it first
appears.</P>
<P>Martin is Bowfinger, a no talent film maker, sort of an Ed Wood of the 90's
who wants to make that one great motion picture.  A member of his staff
writes a completely campy film about aliens called 'Chubby Rain' that
Bowfinger believes will be brilliant.  He cons his way into the company of a
hot shot studio executive (Robert Downey Jr.,) who, after a brief encounter
with 'Bowfinger', tells him he has his deal for a picture if he can land the
biggest action star in Hollywood named Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy).  After
Trying to lure Kit into the project personally, Bowfinger fails to get his
star but has a back up plan.  He tells his staff who have struggled with him
for years (played by actors Christine Baranski, Adam Alexi-Malle and Jaime
Kennedy) that he did land the deal but confides in only one of them that he
failed and decides to photograph the real Kit Ramsey in secret from far away
distances without the star's knowledge and uses many excuses to make his
staff believe that Ramsey is working on the project voluntarily.  Also in
the mix is a young actress (Heather Graham), just off the bus from Ohio with
dreams of making it big as an actress in Hollywood.</P>
<P>Murphy's character of Kit Ramsey is hilarious.  He's the sort of star who is
jealous of other action heroes and complains that he doesn't get the same
treatment as the biggest stars who are his peers.  He treats outsiders like
dirt, is close to his entourage and suffers from paranoia and sees a pseudo
therapist (Terence Stamp) for his problems.  Ramsey's paranoia is all based
on misunderstanding.  Thrown into the story for all of this is a Kit Ramsey
look alike (also played by Murphy), whose character has a great twist that
may make Martin's plan work after all.</P>
<P>'Bowfinger' is directed by Frank Oz ('In and Out', 'What About Bob?', 'Dirty
Rotten Scoundrels', 'Little Shop of Horrors') and Oz structures his film
like a cleverly played game of desperation.  He makes light of it all and
the film never uses a heavy hand in any of its scenes to make the chemistry
between its stars work.  Oz also likes to make his movies work like puppet
shows.  He manages to get the most deadpan looks from his actors and often
confines many of his scenes to the same locations.  There is also a deft
amount of silliness (at times too much) that accompanies his stories in
their sub text.  Oz's work with Jim Henson's Muppet franchise gave him these
light hearted qualities that work well with live action characters and the
human actors who play them.</P>
<P>'Bowfinger' has a perfect running length of 97 minutes and is a true triumph
for Martin as the film's author.  He manages to come up with an entertaining
story filled with witty gags and a fair amount of originality and Eddie
Murphy shows that at the age of 38, he can still act in a very immature
manner and still look like a seasoned veteran of all sorts of comedy as he
displays many layers of his past work this time around.</P>
