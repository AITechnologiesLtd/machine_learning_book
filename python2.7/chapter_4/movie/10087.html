                         KULL THE CONQUEROR 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
      2 :-( :-(  for a barbarian in need of a good laugh at itself</PRE>
<P>Cast: Kevin Sorbo, Tia Carrere, Litefoot, Karina Lombard, Thomas Ian
Griffith, Harvey Fierstein, Joe Shaw, Roy Brocksmith Director: John
Nicolella Screenplay: Charles Edward Pogue "based on the worlds and
characters of Robert E. Howard"</P>
<P>The worst thing that Kevin Sorbo could have done was to start taking
himself seriously. I believe what makes ‘Hercules' the syndicate series
a success is the fact that it constantly pokes fun at itself and somehow
manages to kick itself in the head with slapstick humour and giddy,
kiddy fun. This sudden swing from action comedy (Hercules) to action
drama (Kull) comes as sudden and silly as a spaghetti meatball trying to
imitate a poached pheasant. Somehow that savoury chunk of meat with
tomato gravy doesn't quite live up to that small dried bird in fancy
dressing.</P>
<P>Sorry Kevin, I don't buy it. ‘Kull' will forever be compared to that
awful masterpiece ‘Conan', and it doesn't compare well. ‘Conan' may have
been one of the worst films made, but it is still a brilliantly bad
film. It had a young Arnold Shwarzenneger with heavy accent, coated with
sweat, humping females and hacking monsters – everything a barbarian
should and does do well. One thing the two films do have in common is
bare flesh and humping. Sorbo performs adequately in both departments,
but this really isn't his forte. I believe Sorbo's strength is the
subtle comic talent evident in ‘Hercules', which should have been
utilised to his advantage in this film but is sadly swept under the rug.
Also greatly missed are the wonderful sidekick characters that make
‘Hercules' a bottle of laughter. Everyone is so serious in ‘Kull' and
nobody significant dies till late in the film.</P>
<P>The main problem with films of this genre is that it gets awful lonesome
when the world of ‘Kull' is sadly under populated. There needs to be
more people around if you want to make it worth saving. I mean it really
defeats the purpose if ‘Kull' was flexing his muscles for a couple of
rocks and withered tree (I'm grossly exaggerating, but it's still a
valid point). It's as if the director hasn't been able to get enough
extras to fill the empty streets and barren landscape in time for the
shoot. My suggestion is to use plenty of mannequins in the background.
I'm sure nobody would notice anyway. After all this is not a film aimed
at academy award nominated performances. So overall the experience of
‘Kull' was sadly a grand mistake of barbaric proportions. This
miscalculated move by Kevin Sorbo should not damaged his popularity, but
next time he starts pumping iron, I would like to see him in that
familiar loin cloth of cheery ‘Hercules'.</P>
