<PRE>                               WAGONS EAST!
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Too bad that John Candy's last film should be such a poor,
one-joke movie.   All the Westerns are about the trek West, the
hardships, the Indians, the U. S. Cavalry, the circling of wagons when
attacked.  Here, they form a square.  This one is just the opposite.
Even the exclamation point in the title will not help create any
excitement or laughter.</P>
<P>     When the people of Prosperity have had it up to here with boredom,
primitive living and the dangers of the West, they think the
unthinkable: What are we doing here?  Let's head back East.</P>
<P>     James Harlow (John Candy) is the inept wagon master who will lead
the wagons that want to return East.  The first joke is that when he
gives the signals for the wagons to start moving and he shouts
"Eastward, Ho!" he leads in the wrong direction, West, where they are
captured by Indians.  That's typical of the inane humor.</P>
<P>     On paper it may have seemed like a good idea: The Indians will
help them get out of the usurped territory, the Cavalry and the land
barons are the bad guys.   The wealthy landowners have invested lots of
money and if a trend were started to go back East, it would ruin them.
The Eastward-heading wagon trains must be stopped.  But the movie from
its very beginning is unfunny and hackneyed.</P>
<P>     Also in the cast are Richard Lewis as a surgeon, his wife Melinda
Culea, Ricardo Picardo as a banker, and Ellen Greene, a working girl
... all tired with the West and ready to return to civilization.</P>
