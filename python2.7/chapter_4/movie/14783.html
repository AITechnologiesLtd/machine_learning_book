<PRE>                 SIX-STRING SAMURAI (United States)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: In a post-holocaust world, a guy who dresses like Buddy
Holly and fights like Sanjuro struggles his way to "Lost Vegas" where
he will be "the King."  No new ideas, no plot, just a string of fights
and music.  Rating: 1 (0 to 10), -2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Directed by Lance Mungia.  Starring Jeffery Falcon.  Written (if
     that is the right word) by Mungia and Falcon.
   - The director claims to be a fan of Akira Kurosawa, and imitates
     the fight scenes in some of his films fairly well.  But he has
     missed a very important aspect of Kurasowa'a work.  If you walk
     out of a Kurasowa film for ten minutes the plot will have advanced
     and you will need to do something to catch up.  The plot of this
     film does not advance.  If you walk out of SIX-STRING SAMURAI for
     ten minutes, you will have missed no plot complications beyond
     whom the title character is fighting and you will enriched your
     life by ten minutes.  I recommend at least eight such absences
     during the course of the film.
   - Alternate history in which the USSR defeated the US in a 1957
     atomic war.
   - Music is supplied by The Red Elvises who rely on doing rock
     versions of classical Slavic music.
   - Yet another film in which the props all seem to come from a
     particularly impoverished junkyard.  Costumes seem to be from Good
     Will.
   - Words don't fit characters' lips, as if incompetently redubbed in
     the studio.
   - If there was a nuclear war in 1957, where do the Eisenhower
     dollars come from that one set of baddies are flipping?</P>
