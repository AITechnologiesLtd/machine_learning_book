<P>     This leisurely paced but increasingly gripping indy drama should be
high on any summer moviegoer's list.  In the first (the first?) Oscar-
worthy performance of the year, Peter Fonda plays Ulysses "Ulee" Jack-
son, a fiercely introverted Florida beekeeper who is playing single dad
to his jailed son's daughters.  He leads a reclusive life, forgoing
friends and the help of others, even during the busiest of bee seasons.
Everything expectedly changes with the arrival of the kid's drug-
dependent mother.  In her dazed and confused wake comes a kind nurse
from across the street (Patricia Richardson, from "Home Improvement")
and two small-time thugs who have unfinished business with Ulee's son.
While Fonda's performance is the obvious centerpiece here-- think an
eerie invocation of his father crossed with, say, Clint Eastwood--
writer/director Victor Nunez (RUBY IN PARADISE) has crafted a story
that's consistently engaging.  (Even if the methodical pacing is
potentially sleep-inducing.) I particularly enjoyed a beekeeper's-eye
view of honey-making, as well as watching the step-by-step process of an
entire family's healing.</P>
