<PRE>Deep Impact
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The night skies have always held a fascination for mankind. One of the
ultimate unknowns, that's where gods lived and where we look to for signs as
to how to proceed with life. Various heavenly bodies and their configurations
signify favorable or adverse conditions. Comets were often thought to be ill omens.</P>
<P>In the first of this summer's destruction-from-above films ("Armageddon" with
Bruce Willis opens later) one particular comet indicates the most sinister
omen you could imagine. It's about to strike the Earth and wipe out all life
on the planet.</P>
<P>High school student Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) is peering through his
telescope one night at an amateur astronomy outing and finds a glow in the sky
where there wasn't one before. When a professional examines the information,
he discovers the bad news - just before he has his own fatal impact with an 18-wheeler.</P>
<P>A year later television news reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) is hot on a
story about a White House sex scandal concerning a woman named Ellie. Through
a web-search and dumb luck, she discovers that the actual word is "ELE",
Extinction-Level Event. Abducted by G-Men for a secret meeting with President
Beck (Morgan Freeman), she does an amusing word-dance attempting to find out
what is going on without revealing that she knows little.</P>
<P>Beck believes that she is about to break the story and is forced to go public
with the upcoming disaster. But not to worry, he explains, everything is well
in hand. A team of astronauts is about to take off in the "Messiah", the
largest spaceship ever built, to nuke the Mt. Everest-sized comet and save the world.</P>
<P>Veteran astronaut Spurgeon "Fish" Tanner (Robert Duvall) is the odd man out
on the team. The rest believe that the oldster is only included on the trip
for the PR factor. He thinks that the only experience they've had is on flight
simulator video games.</P>
<P>Several months later, the Messiah reaches the comet to blow it to pieces.
Since this is only half way through the movie, no one in the audience has any
expectations that this plan will succeed. If it did, this would be one of the
shortest disaster films in history and we wouldn't be able to see the huge
tidal wave wipe out New York as shown in the previews.</P>
<P>Back on the home planet, the President tells the nation that there's been a
glitch, but we have back-up plans. And if all else fails, we're constructing a
huge "Ark" cave where a million people along with animals and plants will wait
out the two years of darkened skies after the comet's collision. Our way of
life will survive. Meanwhile, everyone should just go about their normal lives.</P>
<P>The film follows three groups of people: the astronauts, Lerner and
Biederman. The reporter is coming to grips with her personal anguish. Her
parents (Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell) have just divorced and her
father has married a woman half his age. Young Leo is smitten with a classmate
and wants to get her to the cave where she will survive.</P>
<P>Falling into the "Towering Inferno" syndrome, this movie attempts too much in
too short a time. None of the characters are fleshed out and it's a real
struggle to care about whether they live or die. All the cinematic short-cuts
of manipulative teary-eyed good-byes in the world can't make us involved if we
don't know the people.</P>
<P>What could have been fascinating sub-plots are left uninvestigated. Tanner's
conflict with his fellow astronauts disappears into nothingness. A million
people living in the Ark and how they deal with that situation begs for more
screen time, but we never even see the inside of the caves.</P>
<P>This is one of the few instances where television would be the superior
medium for a special effects film. There's too much to tell. It's tailor-made
for a multi-hour mini-series.</P>
<P>Oddly enough, we never see most of the action. Most of the big outer space
excitement is missing. As we watch Lerner's broadcast, the signal is disrupted
and all we get is a computer simulation. When Titan missiles are launched
towards the comet, we learn of the result from the President's speech rather
than seeing it. The punchlines are gone. For a $75 million film, it seems _small_.</P>
<P>Admittedly there are a few impressive effects scenes. The astronauts on the
surface of the comet is the high point of the action-oriented events. The huge
tsunami wiping out the east coast isn't bad.</P>
<P>The acting is adequate, but with a cast of A-list actors, you would expect
more. Far too many people are under-used and you are left wondering who they are.</P>
<P>The film missed the big story. How would most people react if they knew they
were about to die? Beck tells them that they should continue as usual, paying
their bills and going to work. I don't know about you, but if I know that life
is coming to an end in a few months, those credit card bills are going to have
to wait.</P>
<P>You'd expect that such an announcement would provoke mass hysteria, but
there's very little of it in the film. In the real world, emotions would be
running high. Some people would choose to party the last days away, others
would be rioting in the streets and still others would be making peace with
their lives. There's a song out now about the day they cured AIDS and the
writer sleeps with half a dozen people on that day. With the end of the world
in sight, you'd think that sex would be one thing on at least some people's
minds. There's no sex, no mass destruction, no panic. Everyone in the movie
takes the low-key moral high ground. Admirable but not realistic.</P>
<P>Director Mimi Leder ("The Peacemaker", "ER") has the right idea. People in
the midst of disaster are more interesting than the disaster itself. "Titanic"
proved that. But it doesn't work here. The cast is too big and the time too limited.</P>
<P>"Deep Impact" has its heart in the right place. There's just not enough of
that heart.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has been writing this column for over 23 years and if he hears
of a comet heading towards his house, he's planning on partying like it's
1999. Email party invitations to <A HREF="mailto:redman@bvoice.com.">redman@bvoice.com.</A>)</P>
