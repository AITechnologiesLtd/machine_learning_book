<PRE>"It will be the kiss by which all others will be
judged."</PRE>
<P>Starring Anton Yelchin, Anthony Hopkins, Hope Davis.
Directed by Scott Hicks. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Film adaptations of Stephen King novels are
notoriously uneven. For every Green Mile and Carrie,
there's a Thinner and a Children of the Corn. Despite
the dubious track record, Hearts in Atlantis seemed
like it couldn't lose. The film, based on a) a
critically acclaimed b) coming-of-age-tale with c) no
elements of horror, would star d) Anthony Hopkins and
be directed by e) Scott "Shine" Hicks. If all else
fails, the resulting effort would at least have to be
interesting.</P>
<P>Turns out that the movie is a great deal more than
merely interesting. It's a wonderful, nostalgic piece,
closest in mood and spirit of another great Stephen
King movie: Stand By Me. Bobby Garfield (Anton
Yelchin) is an average pre-teen growing up in the
1960's. His father didn't leave them a penny when he
left, as his bitter, self-absorbed mother Elizabeth
(Hope Davis) doesn't fail to remind him every chance
she gets. A boarder moves into the upstairs apartment,
a kindly, slightly eccentric gentleman named Ted
Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins).</P>
<P>Brautigan offers to pay Bobby a dollar a week to read
the daily paper to him and, despite the warnings and
suspicions of his mother, soon becomes a friend and a
mentor. He's no child molester, but there's something
strange about him all the same. He tells Bobby to look
out for "low men" in the "Dickensian sense;" crooks
who want something from him and will circle their prey
like hyenas before moving in for the kill. Once in a
while, he goes into a trance and wakes up with a yell.
And how does he know all those things about everyone
around him, anyway?</P>
<P>There is a supernatural element to the story, yes, but
it is little more than a backdrop, a red herring for
the simply elegant coming-of-age story that is the
film's real concern. It is no accident that the "low
men" are never anything but ciphers, and there are no
dramatic showdowns with people hanging off catwalks by
their fingernails. There is, however, a boy: a real
boy, intelligent and not at all whiny, who, we
suspect, will never be the same again.</P>
<P>It is a redundancy to say that Anthony Hopkins gives
an Oscar-caliber performance, since every one of his
roles fits that qualification. It should be said,
though, that young Anton Yelchin, seen previously as
the son of a Russian official in Along Came a Spider,
could give Haley Joel Osment a run for his money as
child acting prodigy of the moment; while Osment is
amazing at playing characters in extraordinary
situations, Yelchin, two years younger, excels at
portraying a regular kid though he, too, radiates an
intelligence beyond his years.</P>
<P>Had Hearts in Atlantis cut its first ten minutes and
its last five, it may have been a masterpiece;
instead, it hedges its bets on an awkward framing
device, a series of present-day scenes where an adult
Bobby is played by David Morse, that isn't in sync
with the rest of the film. It's too easy a method to
evoke a conventional feeling of "nostalgia," and it
isn't really necessary, since Hicks does a terrific
job of giving the rest of the film a nostalgic feel
without additional exposition.</P>
<P>King's stories rarely pull any trademark manipulative
punches, and Hearts in Atlantis has an unsentimental
streak even as it works to make you cry. It's one of
the year's most purely satisfying films. </P>
