<PRE>More Courtroom than Courting
Snow Falling on Cedars</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>When a tight shot of freshly caught fish gasping for air on the puddled
floorboards of a small fishing boat is saturated with all the aesthetics of
a Renoir painting ... you know you're in for an artistically filmed
production. Well "Cedars" won't let you down. Scrupulously, meticulously,
caringly exposed on the negative, this picture is one of the richest
cinematographic efforts of the year.</P>
<P>The art doesn't stop with the image. Attentive and crisp sounds accentuate
the visual buffet. The crackling ignition of a match, the pouring of hot
tea: this is an abundantly textured film. Additionally, the score
refreshingly fuses new age with traditional movie music composition.</P>
<P>Oddly, this love story is really more of a courtroom drama; however, as soon
as we realize this, the artistry and the plot line unfortunately take off in
different directions.</P>
<P>We view this 1930-1950's story mostly through the eyes of hesitant reporter
Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke) who as a child and teen shared a secret
romance with a Japanese girl from his small town. When the woman's husband
is accused of murder, Ishmael has to battle his 20-year-old obsession in
order to decide if he should help defend the man that stole his girl.</P>
<P>One of the film's finest moments finds the widow on the stand, attorney
mouthing muted words while passionate memories of her husband play out on
screen to screaming violins.</P>
<P>The leads aren't particularly strong, but Richard Jenkins as the Sheriff
gives a great supporting performance and Max Von Sydow is charming as the
defense lawyer. Fine casting.</P>
<P>I was trembling with excitement over this film until the halfway mark when
the art became more than a tad indulgent neglecting its responsibility to
story, making the film rather disproportionate. "Cedars" toys with a love
fable, toys with making a statement of Japanese suffrage (the concentration
camps for Japanese-Americans during W.W.II), spends a lot of time in the
courtroom, but is ultimately a tale of one man's wrestle with an obsession
recorded on film in a fashion far superior to its story. Still, it is simply
the most beautiful courtroom drama you'll ever see.</P>
