<P>OPERATION CONDOR  A Film Review By Jesse A. Kaplan</P>
<PRE>Cast: Jackie Chan,Jackie Carol, Do Do Cheng, Eva Cobo, Shoko Ikeda, Aldo
Sanchez
Directed By Jackie Chan</PRE>
<P> The newest of Hong Kong, and world Superstar Jackie Chan's (RUMLE IN
THE BRONX, SUPERCOP) movies has arrived to the US. Operation condor
definately rates as one of his best.  Not since RUMBLE IN THE BRONX, has
Chan delieved the amount of fighting and humor the American Audiences.</P>
<P>Basically in this story, Chan plays a hing kong special agent named
Jackie.  He needs to find a lot of gold that the nazi's left in the
Sahara desert in which many a shady character are trying to get their
hands on.  If you think there are references to all of the INDIANA JONES
sagas, you are right on.  However the plot means nothing as we come
looking for the action.</P>
<P>Chan fights through hotels, the desert, underground castles, and wind
tunnel in this one boys and girls.  As only Jackie Chan can do, he uses
any weapon available, let it be either a scorpion or a towel.  OPERAION
CONDOR is great fun and and great action as Chan mixes funny humor with
amazing kung-fu.  Of course there are outtakes at the end so stay tuned
for them.
"Have you had enough?"
"HA HA HA HA.....NO!!"</P>
