<PRE>                                    THE PHANTOM
                       A film review by Larry McGillicuddy
                        Copyright 1996 Larry McGillicuddy</PRE>
<PRE>*   (out of 4)                     
Directed by Simon Wincer                                          
Starring Billy Zane, Kristy Swanson, Treat Williams, Catherine 
Zeta Jones                                                  </PRE>
<PRE>Review- The Phantom is an unimaginative comic book caper,   
that features bad performances, lifeless direction, and     
poorly staged action sequences.  It is a truly dissapointing
movie, which is too bad, because I really like Kristy       
Swanson.                                                    </PRE>
<PRE>The Phantom is another duel identity super hero in the line 
of Superman and Batman, but the character, at least in this 
movie, has none of the intrigue of those characters. There  
seems to be very little inner conflict in this character,   
and he appears to have hardly any superpowers or nifty      
gadgets.                                                    </PRE>
<PRE>The familiar plot deals with some businessman trying to find
some kind of  powerful skull that will give him some sort of
powers. The movie never makes clear what the skulls will do,
or maybe it did and I was just too bored to care at the     
time. The Phantom tries to stop this and rescues a heiress  
played by Swanson. There is an attempt at a romance between 
the two, but it seems forced, because Swanson and Zane have 
zero chemistry together.                                    </PRE>
<P>Everything in The Phantom you have seen many times before   
and there is nothing new presented here. Wincer displays    
absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action        
sequence. Billy Zane is wooden as the hero. Kristy Swanson  
is given very little to do, and does very little with it.   
Treat Williams, looking like Rhett Butler but sounding like 
Mickey Mouse, is one of the worst villains I have ever seen 
in a movie. Only Catherine Zeta Jones, as one of Williams   
cohorts turns in a good performance. She has energy and     
spunk, which the movie needed much more of. Oh yeah, the    
Phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly    
played out you won't even care. About the only things I can 
recommend are a good performance by Jones, and some colorful
scenery. However, if youre looking for a fun family movie,  
go watch the underrated Flipper. This is not a good movie.  </P>
