<PRE>Smile, You're Dating me on Candid Camera
20 Dates</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Wow, what a wild ride! Myles, a filmmaker, is recently divorced. In a way in
which Woody Allen might simultaneously host and be tape in The World's
Funniest Videos, Myles sets out to fall in love or make a movie -- which
ever comes first!</P>
<P>Inconveniently, they both happen. Myles convinces vile producer Elie to fund
this project to film, via hidden camera, 20 of his (Myles') dates whilst he
searches for love in LA.</P>
<P>One of Myles' dates wants to go bunji-jumping. So shivering Myles is
"forced" to jump off a bridge -- or risk embarrassing himself as a coward in
his own film. He finally jumps, then looking up at the camera, he curses,
"You better have f'ing got that!"</P>
<P>Much of the film documents Myles' oft failed, yet seldom dull attempts to
secure a date with an unsuspecting female. In one scene, Myles approaches a
woman in the grocery store. He leads in, "Oh, I see you're shopping in the
fat-free isle..." "Yes, they've got some good stuff here," she replies
friendly enough. "Well, we're having a fat-free party, if you'd like to join
us," Myles scams. "I don't think my boyfriend would like that." The woman
reveals. Undeterred, Myles replies "Why? He doesn't like fat-free?"</P>
<P>20 Dates is the result of over 140 hours of video tape humorously edited
down to 120 minutes, then bumped up to 35 mm film. The picture quality is
lacking of course, and visually gives you the odd sensation that you're
watching TV in a theater. I was never quite sure, what was real, staged, or
just clever editing. In the end, the unabashed humor pushed me over the
edge, I took the bate and roared in isle. This is one to put on your "to
rent" video list.</P>
<P>Starring and Directed by Myles Berkowitz. Rated R. 88 minutes.
Produced by Elie Samaha, Mark McGarry and Jason Villard at Phoenician
Films/Fox Searchlight</P>
<P>Grade..........................B+/A-</P>
