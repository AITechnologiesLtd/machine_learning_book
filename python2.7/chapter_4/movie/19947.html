<P>Two key moments in the fizzy and funny comedy "Bowfinger" are 
particularly welcome. In one, Steve Martin's character discovers that 
his new girlfriend is sleeping with someone else. The other comes 
when several cast members realize that Martin's character has 
deceived them on a grand scale. In most movies, both situations would 
lead to dramatic confrontations and bitter words, but in "Bowfinger," 
the transgressions are dismissed with a line or two, because this 
production is concerned with laughs, not melodrama. </P>
<P>In general, I have little tolerance for Hollywood movies about 
Hollywood movies. More often than not, such films are lazy, with a 
paucity of wit and an overabundance of lame in-jokes and snide, 
cartoonish portrayals of industry archetypes ("Hijacking Hollywood" 
and "Burn Hollywood Burn: An Alan Smithee Film" are two particularly 
dreadful recent examples). Thankfully, "Bowfinger" is more 
imaginative, and considerably funnier, than most films of this genre. </P>
<P>Steve Martin stars as Bobby Bowfinger, a wannabe movie mogul who runs 
Bowfinger International out of his living room. Although his biggest 
credit to date is "The Yugo Story," Bowfinger has big dreams. He 
wants to produce and direct "Chubby Rain," a sci-fi opus written by 
his accountant about microscopic aliens who invade Earth by riding to 
the surface of our planet in raindrops. Bowfinger has a bankroll to 
back up his vision; since childhood, he has set aside a dollar a week 
and now has a whopping budget of $2,184 to bring his film to life. </P>
<P>After a studio executive (Robert Downey Jr., in his last role before 
being sent to the Big House by a judge fed up with his chronic drug 
relapses) facetiously says he will green-light the movie if Bowfinger 
can secure the talents of action superstar Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), 
the low-rent filmmaker manages to pitch his concept to Ramsey, only 
to be tossed out of the star's limo. Undeterred, Bowfinger comes up 
with a new angle. Using hidden cameras, he will shoot his actors as 
they approach Ramsey in public places, spout their lines and 
disappear before security can nab them. Then he'll incorporate the 
footage into the rest of his bargain basement movie and, faster than 
you can say "Plan 9 From Outer Space," it's "Chubby Rain" starring 
Kit Ramsey!</P>
<P>Of course, things do not go according to plan. The pampered, 
temperamental Ramsey turns out to be a raving paranoid (among other 
quirks, he is so obsessed with racism that he uses a computer to 
count the "Ks" in a screenplay, then presents the total as "proof" 
that the script is riddled with hidden references to the KKK). Thrown 
into a panic by the repeated appearances of Bowfinger's cast ("these 
strangers keep coming up to me, speaking in some strange white people 
code!"), he goes into hiding at MindHead, a quasi-religious cult 
center whose members wear pyramids on their heads), leaving "Chubby 
Rain" in a lurch. Never one to give up, Bowfinger hires Jiff (also 
Murphy), a good-natured goofball and Kit Ramsey look-a-like, to allow 
filming to continue. Jiff, who aspires to be a delivery boy, quickly 
finds himself in the middle of the madness, as Bowfinger struggles to 
complete his masterpiece no matter what. </P>
<P>The whole idea is silly as hell, which is a big part of the charm of 
"Bowfinger." The film plays like a feature-length series of "Saturday 
Night Live" sketches, except that the majority of these are actually 
funny. The ensemble cast, reminiscent of legendary bad director Ed 
Wood and his entourage, works well together, with Christine Baranski 
(the best thing about the old sitcom "Cybil") stealing scenes with 
her outrageously arched eyebrows, vampish strutting and over-the-top 
line readings. </P>
<P>But it's Eddie Murphy who holds the production together with two 
dandy performances. He is absolutely convincing as spoiled superstar 
Kit (referencing personal history, perhaps?) and delightful as the 
innocent Jiff. After restarting his stalled career with "The Nutty 
Professor" and "Dr. Dolittle," it's gratifying to see Murphy shine 
without special effects.</P>
<P>Steve Martin wrote the film and his take on Tinseltown is interesting.
 The sole truly sympathetic character in the entire cast is Jiff, who 
also happens to be the only outsider to the scene. One female cast 
member spends most of the movie sleeping her way up the Hollywood 
food chain, finally ditching Bowfinger and all the other males for a 
romance with a powerful woman. Steve Martin once dated Anne Heche, 
who had a number of relationships with high-profile actors before 
settling down with Ellen DeGeneres. Coincidence?  </P>
<P>Despite its many clever bits (wait until you see how the camera crew 
is recruited) little of "Bowfinger" lingered in my memory after I 
left the theater. Frivolous, wispy and quite disposable, this is 
cinematic cotton candy, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Sure, 
cotton candy is insubstantial, but it tastes good for the few moments 
it's there and so does "Bowfinger."  </P>
