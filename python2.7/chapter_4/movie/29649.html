<PRE>THE MASK (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Comic book industry has suffered a sharp commercial decline
in the last decade. One of the reasons for that can be found
in the rapid development of computer graphic technologies
that brought whole new dimension to interactive video games
and Hollywood films. Two-dimensional paper world of comic
books simply can't compete with them and the adolescents,
who used to keep the industry alive, are turning away
towards alternative forms of entertainment in which their
favourite characters, even the most outrageous ones, look
more alive and more attractive. One of such examples is THE
MASK, movie adaptation of Dark Horse comic book, directed in
1994 by Charles Russell.</P>
<P>Protagonist of this film is Stanley Ipkiss (played by Jim
Carrey), mild-mannered bank clerk who is not particularly
happy with many aspects of his life, especially those
related to opposite sex. One day a beautiful night club
singer Tina Carlyle (played by Cameron Diaz) comes to his
bank and Stanley hopelessly falls in love with. But the
visit to the night club ends with Stanley being bounced and
spending the rest of night walking by the sea. There he sees
a strange ancient mask that features face of Loki, Norse god
of mischief. When Stanley puts the mask on his face, he gets
transformed into Mask - a new character with a green face, a
person who does almost any thing Stanley would never do.
While doing that he brings attention of both police led by
Lt. Mitch Kellaway (played by Peter Riegert) and crime
syndicate led by Dorian Tyrell (played by Peter Greene).</P>
<P>There are few comic actors like Jim Carrey whose comedic
talent is such that he can carry movies that would otherwise
be unwatchable. THE MASK is one of those rare instances
where Jim Carrey's overwhelming talent actually had to
compete with something else. The outrageous and cartoonish
character of Mask was simply impossible to put on the screen
without massive display of latest CGI technologies. In the
end the special effects became the most important element of
the film and everything else - plot, characters, settings
etc. - was just an excuse for their display. Unfortunately,
those scenes tend to be too short and between them viewers
have to deal with the weak script by Mike Werb and
anachronistic characters and situation that might look like
they were time-warped from 1940s. Although Carrey really
tried his best (and usually succeeds) in bringing life to
the comic book characters, his efforts weren't enough to
rescue this film from sinking into oblivion. Those who
remember THE MASK these days usually don't think of Carrey
or ground-breaking CGI effects; the main reason why this
film gets mentioned is Cameron Diaz in her first major movie
appearance, in which she displays somewhat rounder shape
than we are accustomed to see from Hollywood actresses. In
the end, those viewers who aren't big fans of Carrey, Diaz
or comic books probably won't miss much if they don't watch
this film.</P>
