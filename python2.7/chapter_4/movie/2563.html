<P>     In content, setting, and cast choice, THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH is a 
departure for writer/director John Sayles.  The creative force behind 
such memorable and diverse films as MATEWAN, CITY OF HOPE, EIGHT MEN OUT, 
and PASSION FISH, has taken pen and camera across the Atlantic to 
Ireland, a land steeped in mystery and legend.  There, using the folklore 
of the locals, he has brought to life an enchanting story about magic and 
tradition that is suitable for family viewing.</P>
<P>     Before embarking on his adaptation of Rosalie K. Fry's out-of-print 
children's book, Sayles spent time researching the customs and language 
of the place where this film was to be set.  His intention, from the 
beginning, was to create a picture in which Irish actors would not be 
given dialogue that seemed obviously written by a foreigner.</P>
<P>     THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH is the story of 10-year old Fiona Coneelly 
(Jeni Courtney), a motherless girl living in the city who is sent to stay 
with her grandparents (Mick Lally and Eileen Colgan) when her father 
determines that his poor lifestyle is not suitable for raising a 
daughter.  Fiona's grandparents live in a small fishing village across 
the waters from Roan Inish ("seal island"), the island where the 
Coneellys had thrived for generations until tragic circumstances forced 
them to the mainland.  Now, however, legends about the family's 
connection to Roan Inish abound.  Is Fiona's little brother, who drifted 
out to sea in a storm years ago, really dead, or have the seals nurtured 
and protected him?  Is there any truth to the story that in Fiona's veins 
runs the blood of a selkie, a seal who became a woman?  And what will it 
take to restore the ways of the past, something which inspires equal 
portions of longing and dread?</P>
<P>     Geographically, Sayles may be in unfamiliar territory with THE 
SECRET OF ROAN INISH, but his inimitable style has been imprinted on this 
movie.  Two of the director's trademarks--the ability to tell an 
engrossing story and the development of strong, three-dimensional 
characters -- are in evidence.  With ROAN INISH, Sayles has found the 
perfect balance between the mystical and the concrete.  Much like INTO 
THE WEST, the result is exuberant and compelling.</P>
<P>     None of the actors in THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH are likely to be 
familiar to American viewers.  Mick Lally, who does a wonderful job as 
the grandfather, is an accomplished Irish thespian whose work is rarely 
seen overseas.  Jeni Courtney, another impressive child actor, has never 
before done a screen role.  Her fiery performance is as much a testimony 
to her talent as to Sayles' direction.</P>
<P>     There's no doubt that THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH is a most atypical 
motion picture, but in many ways, this is the best kind of movie -- one 
that takes us to a land where magic is real, and where a little girl can 
strive to find a lost brother and bring happiness to an entire family.  
The story, although straightforward, is by no means simple, and there's 
enough in THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH to delight both children and adults.</P>
