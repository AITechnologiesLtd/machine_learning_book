<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   Harold Ramis' comedy ANALYZE THIS is a film whose central conceit
   winds up being more interesting than its screen realisation.
   Lampooning mafioso stereotypes with abandon, the picture runs out of
   gas fairly early on and lurches the remainder of the way to the
   finish line.</P>
<P>   With the public's fascination with the dangerous glamour of organized
   crime reaching the level where media saturation on the topic has made
   the John Gotti-led Gambino crime family as fabled and familiar to the
   masses as the Corleones, it was inevitable that accompanying
   cinematic attention to the Mafia would ultimately lead to the
   evolution of an unlikely film sub-genre -- the mob comedy.  Joining
   Andrew Fleming's THE FRESHMAN and Jim Abraham's unfortunate MAFIA! in
   this category is ANALYZE THIS, which attacks one of the more curious
   what-if scenarios of late (though not *singularly* curious -- I
   understand that there's a new HBO series operating on the same basic
   premise): what if a mob boss was stricken with panic attacks and
   enlisted the services of a psychiatrist?</P>
<P>   Billy Crystal, adorning the requisite shrink beard, plays the doctor
   and Robert De Niro lends his iconic status as the angst-ridden
   gangster who finds his life as fearsome New York mob boss Paul Vitti
   increasingly crippled by his volatile emotional state.  An inability
   to brutally bash in a turncoat's head with a steel pipe?  Can't
   perform in bed?  For a macho overlord whose dominance over the Big
   Apple is threatened by a rival mobster (Chazz Palminteri), this
   simply will not do.  And becoming teary-eyed at sentimental
   commercials? Unforgivable.</P>
<P>   Vitti commandeers the unwilling services of Crystal's mild-mannered
   Dr. Ben Sobel at a rather inopportune time -- the shrink is headed on
   vacation to Miami where he's scheduled to marry reporter Laura
   MacNamara (Lisa Kudrow).  After this setup, the Florida-based segment
   of this film mostly plays like a Mafia-tinged version of WHAT ABOUT
   BOB?, where the befuddled Sobel is constantly hounded by his
   demanding new patient who continues to appear at the most
   inappropriate moments.  Of course, fitting the stature of a crime
   boss, it's not Vitti himself who pesters Sobel -- his dim, sad-eyed
   right-hand man Jelly (Joe Viterelli) is the one to break into the
   shrink's hotel room and haul him out of bed in the middle of the
   night.</P>
<P>   The culture clash between the hardened world of the mob and Sobel's
   suburbanite is often amusing, and there are several funny comic
   routines and sight gags, but it gradually becomes apparent that the
   film is content to skewer the Mafia in a series of repetitive riffs,
   toying with the tough, family-loving, God-fearing, honour-bound
   archetype familiar from the movies; the picture establishes a rhythm
   which plays itself out quickly.  On the flip side, although hinting
   at it on several occasions (at one point, when instructed to be
   vague, Sobel notes that his profession has left him well-equipped for
   imprecision), the picture fails to add a little variety to the comedy
   by doing little to send-up the psychiatric profession, and indeed
   winds up endorsing mushy therapeutic cliches during the story's
   uninvolving resolution, dulling the carefree irreverence of the
   picture.</P>
<P>   Beyond its premise, the film doesn't really have much of a compelling
   story to speak of, and what that there is evolves in the weaker
   latter half of the picture as the action shifts back to New York.
   It's mostly routine and uncompelling material -- FBI stings, mob
   summits, yet *more* goofy wedding ceremony fiascoes (a tired gag
   which has been pretty much been run into the ground) and serves as a
   rather flimsy hanger upon which to float more comic bits.  Howard
   Shore attempts to inject energy into the piece with a jaunty score
   which only serves to underline how muddled the film has become.</P>
<P>   While De Niro demonstrates his good sportsmanship in the picture
   through his cheerfully straight portrayal of the stressed mob boss,
   Kudrow's imitable quirkiness is largely wasted in a tiny, generic
   role, and Palminteri's saddled with a two-dimensional character he
   could play in his sleep.  On the other hand, it's been so long since
   his heyday with WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... and CITY SLICKERS that I'd
   begun to actually forget about Crystal as a solid screen comedian and
   found myself thinking of him mostly as The Guy Who Knows How To Host
   The Oscars.  In the final reel of ANALYZE THIS, he gets to shed the
   second banana role worn throughout the bulk of the picture to deliver
   one of his best onscreen moments in quite some time.  The result was
   silly and predictable, but it had me chuckling.</P>
