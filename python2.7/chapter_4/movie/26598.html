<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>First time director/writer Khyentse Norbu has created a pleasingly
gentle comedy with pressing political undertones. It is genuinely acted
by the nonprofessional cast living in the monastery, presumably playing
roles of themselves. The film is set in an exiled Tibetan monastery in
northern India. Khyentse Norbu, the Bhutanese-born lama, has more in
mind than just making pictures like his favorite director Ozu does...as
he seems more intent in telling about overcoming hatred in oneself,
which is deemed as the Buddhist way to overcome all one's enemies. He
was recognized at age seven as the reincarnation of a 19th-century
Buddhist guru, and got his movie feet wet in Bertolucci's "Little
Buddha," a film he supposedly helped influence.</P>
<P>The Cup was a crowd favorite at the Toronto Film Festival, which is easy
to see why, in a film that tries very hard to bring the stern monastic
world of the monks together with a more lighthearted secular approach to
the modern conditions the monks are now faced with. The story is a true
one, which should add relevancy to this very human, amusing and poignant
tale.</P>
<P>Soccer is the modern temptation the would-be monks are exposed to in
India, and this little rascal of a kid, who was born in India and
blessed with a huge personality, Orgyen, is a soccer fanatic. He is
first seen in the dusty monastery yard playing a mock soccer game with
some of the other kids as they kick a Coca-Cola can around, which is
used in place of a ball. Underneath his saffron robe, he wears a jersey
of his favorite soccer player, while in his room, there are pictures of
the many soccer players he idolizes, much like other teenagers around
the world might have pasted on their wall. He is so taken with the 1998
World Cup matches, that he is disciplined by Geko, the severe but caring
monk in charge of the boys, as he chatters to others about the games
during a prayer session. He also sneaks into the village at night to
watch the soccer events live on TV. He roots for France since they are
the only Western country to openly support a free Tibet, and since Tibet
has no national team under China's dominance, anyhow.</P>
<P>The Coca-Cola can serves as a symbolic link between the secular and
monastic worlds, as Geko retrieves the can and eventually gives it to an
eccentric lama, given to making predictions based on his Buddhist
knowledge. He finds a use for the can in his shrine room, where it
becomes transformed into the sacred object holding one of the spiritual
candles used in prayer.</P>
<P>The film's drama builds as two youngsters who are related, who escaped
from Tibet with the help of one of the adult members of the Tibetan
community, arrive in the monastery and are ordained to be monks. The
sage-like abbot generously greets them to his impoverished monastery,
and allows one of the poor youngsters to keep the watch his mother gives
to the monastery to help them pay for her son's stay.</P>
<P>The pull of the final World Cup match final between France and Brazil is
so great for Orgyen, that he schemes to come up with a way of watching
the game at the monastery on satellite TV, reasoning that it was not the
game Geko was concerned about when he disciplined him for watching the
game, but that he was caught sneaking out. He was disciplined to do
kitchen work and threatened with expulsion if he sneaks out again. He
tells the kindly old-fashioned abbot that his plan is to get all the
monks to contribute some money so that they can rent the satellite in
town and set it up on their roof, and thereby everyone in the monastery
could watch it together. The dramatics are provided when the new boy's
watch is used as part of the payment. Orgyen, while watching the game,
realizes how much the watch means to the youngster and during the game
goes back to his room to collect the stuff his mother gave him, so that
he can buy the watch back. Geko will join him, wondering why he's not
watching the game, since he made such a big fuss about it.</P>
<P>It's a small but telling story, more European in flavor than American,
but deserving of much praise for its heartening universal human message.
The film itself, makes no splash cinema-wise, as its story is told in a
conventional art-house style. But this film has ingrained in it more
than merely its inspirational story, it is a film about a culture that
is currently being persecuted and threatened with genocide, and the
noble Tibetan answer is to fight back by being as a human as possible,
not resorting to violence, only acting in the most civilized way
possible, making their actions, no matter what they are involved in, a
moral lesson to the world. This film utters such a human cry against
oppression and even in the lighthearted style that it was presented, its
political message about the meaning of freedom is nevertheless an urgent
one, one well-worth listening to and not turning away from the film with
a cynical knee-jerk reaction, by complaining as to how plain the story
is.
If that's all you see about this film, a bunch of kids watching a soccer
game on satellite TV, then I think you missed its message in this
lifetime.</P>
