<PRE>GUN SHY</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * 1/2</PRE>

<P>If there's one thing Sandra Bullock desperately needs, it's a decent script to
get her career restarted. After a series of flops ("Speed 2", "Forces of
Nature"), she needs a good script with a good costar. Well, "Gun Shy" is a
rather entertaining script, and she has the always great Liam Neeson as her
costar, but there are two serious problems: First, the film was released at
what could be the worst possible time, the same weekend as "Scream 3. Second,
Sandra Bullock appears in perhaps six scenes throughout the film. Everyone
finished gasping in disbelief? That's right folks, despite what the previews
may have led you to believe, "Gun Shy" is hardly a romantic comedy because
there is seldom a female presence. The thing is, the film might be better as a
result.</P>
<P>Charlie Mayough (Liam Neeson) is an undercover DEA officer who is on his last
assignment before retirement. The problem is, he can't bring himself complete
the assignment unless he constantly attends group therapy to keep his nerves
under control. Charlie's final assignment involves catching illegal funds on a
group of mafia types, led by the uptight Fulvio (Oliver Platt). As a result of
Charlie's nerves, he's having another problem, which involves his, uh, bowles.
Well, he visits a proctologist named Jane (Sandra Bullock), who promises she
can fix all his anxiety problems in two weeks by dating him. </P>
<P>It's not very often that a romantic subplot feels quite so tacked on as it does
here. Bullock's character serves absolutely no purpose, other than to give
Charlie occasional words of encouragment and to solve his prostatic
difficulties. In fact, if her character had been eliminated entirely and more
of the film had focused on Oliver Platt and his cohorts, this probably would
have been a much better film. Speaking of Oliver Platt, he is a riot as a hit
man who hates being made up entirely of cliches. The truth is, Oliver Platt
makes this movie. Liam Neeson may be a great actor, but he isn't given much to
work with here. Platt, on the other hand, is given some truly great scenes. For
example, near the start of the film, Platt is seated across from a neighbor,
telling him that in the Middle East they chop the hands off thieves. He then
prepares to do this to the neighbor for reasons we're not quite sure of, but
it's hysterical when we find out.</P>
<P>Charlie's sessions with his therapy group are fairly amusing, particularly when
he runs into one of them while on assignment. Unfortunately, any other time
when Oliver Platt is not on screen, things tend to drag some. We're also
introduced to someone that may possibly be the most irritating character I've
seen in years. Jason (I believe played by Andrew Lauer) is a big time
wallstreet dealer, who shows up to invest the gangsters' money. He is about
five foot ten, has an obnoxious, high pitched voice, and laughs insanely at
everything. After seeing him on screen for about ten minutes, I really wanted
to kill this character with my bare hands. I was tempted to knock a half star
off my rating simply because he was present. The other supporting characters,
while certainly eccentric, are more amusing than annoying. Watch for an
appearance by Mitch Pileggi, of X-Files fame, as Charlie's boss. The funny
thing is, it's almost the exact same character he plays in "The X-Files".</P>
<P>One last thing I must note is that I had a very hard time imagining a beautiful
proctologist going out with one of her patients right after attending to him. I
had an even harder time believing that Charlie could have made it through the
first date without constantly thinking about everything she had seen. "Gun Shy"
is obviously not an incredible comedy. It is, however, an amusing, harmless
little comedy that has has a lot of chuckles and a few true belly laughs. The
film may only run 100 minutes, but things do tend to drag a bit by the end,
which is drawn out well past what is needed. I'd recommend the film to fans of
Liam Neeson and Oliver Platt, but not to fans of Sandra Bullock, since there
isn't much of her in it. I give it three and a half out of five stars.</P>
