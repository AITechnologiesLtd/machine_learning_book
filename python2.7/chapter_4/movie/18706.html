HEART OF DARKNESS
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>The author of this review belong to those heretics who don't
think that Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW represents cinematic
masterpiece. However, although Coppola's film has some other
flaws, the greatest of them all is the disservice done to
the legacy of James Conrad, great English writer who wrote
HEART OF DARKNESS, novel on which APOCALYPSE is based. From
that day, almost any filmmaker who tries to tackle that
novel would have to face comparisons with Coppola's Vietnam
film. However, in 1993, Turner Pictures decided to make
television version of the novel, this time more faithful to
the book.</P>
<P>The plot is, instead of Vietnam in 1960s, set in jungles of
Central Africa in the second half of 19th Century. Greedy
European colonisers are brutally exploiting the natural
resources of Dark Continent, especially ivory. One of
companies specialised in ivory trade hires Captain Marlowe
(played by Tim Roth) for the dangerous mission deep in the
heart of jungle, to the farthest trade station. His task is
to find out why Kurz (John Malkovich), ivory merchant
stationed there, doesn't send ivory any more. Some vicious
rumours are describing Kurz as madman who turned into
charismatic and bloodthirsty leader of the natives.</P>
<P>This film was directed by Nicolas Roeg, well-respected
avant-garde director of the 1970s, and it was probably very
wise decision, because Roeg's specific visual style was
required to make HEART OF DARKNESS as different from
APOCALYPSE as possible. Unfortunately, the script by
Benedict Fitzgerald, although more faithful to the novel
than APOCALYPSE, still fails to avoid similarities. And
Roeg's directing style is hardly the substitute for the lack
of spectacle and sometimes it produces confusion for the
viewers. The atmosphere of absolute horror in the heart of
the jungle was well done, though. The acting is more than
superb. Tim Roth is excellent in the role of Marlowe, and
John Malkovich is also great as Kurz, although nothing can
top Brando's appearance in Coppola's film. More faithful to
the novel, and deprived of Vietnam connotations, HEART OF
DARKNESS is more depressing, because of its pessimism, so
universal for all ages and all dark corners of the world.
HEART OF DARKNESS is good film, but only those who didn't
watch Coppola before could appreciate it fully.</P>
