<PRE>HEIST
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>David Mamet is a good director.  Mamet's an even better screenwriter and
playwright.  The guy's authored some of the best film and theatre works
in the past decade -- The Verdict, House of Games, Wag the Dog, State
and Main, and the guy even won a Pulitzer Prize for his play Glengarry
Glen Ross.  With that said, it's such a shame that his latest crime
caper, Heist, falls apart by employing too many of the well-known
devices of a Mamet production -- double-crossing femmes fatale, overtly
memorable characters, and deceptive plot lines.</P>
<P>But movies like The Spanish Prisoner, Things Change, and The Winslow Boy
display a roundness to Mamet's innate abilities.  And it's almost a
crime to witness how all of that goes awry in his latest film, Heist.</P>
<P>Heist twists and turns along the road of documenting the shady life of
career jewel thief Joe Moore (Gene Hackman) and his posse of thieves --
Bobby Blane (Delroy Lindo) and Don "Pinky" Pincus (Ricky Jay).  During a
raid on a jewelry store, Moore ends up with his mug on the surveillance
cameras and he goes on the lam from the local marshals.  He decides to
get out of Dodge with his recent bride Fran (Rebecca Pidgeon, looking
like a cross between Sharon Stone and Joan Crawford), sailing into the
sunset on his yacht.  The only problem is that his fence Bergman (Danny
DeVito) has set up a big score -- The Swiss Job -- which he wants done
so badly he holds Joe's cut of the jewelry heist on layaway until The
Swiss Job is done.  To ensure his faithful hound brings the goods home
intact, Bergman tosses his nephew Jimmy Silk (Sam Rockwell) into Joe's
crew for observation purposes.  Things become complicated when Joe's
wife has an affair with Jimmy, The Swiss Job turns sour, DeVito starts
acting like his character from Ruthless People, and Ricky Jay starts
looking for the exit to this mess of a film.</P>
<P>A Mamet production usually derives its success from a solid emotional
attachment to its characters -- usually they've been wronged and are
seeking justice or absolution.  The naïve scientist from The Spanish
Prisoner or the curious psychologist from House of Games were just
decent people we recognize in our everyday lives.  When those people get
royally screwed over, its human nature to desire retribution.  Heist
lacks any such emotional attachment.  Of greater concern is the
recycling of plot points from Ronin, which Mamet also wrote and which
deals with a similar plot involving double-crossing thieves on the run.</P>
<P>To save the day, though, Heist carries some of the best actors working
today.  DeVito, Lindo, and Hackman chew up and spit out the scenery
around them.  Sam Rockwell -- who usually plays naïve and jovial
characters in movies like Galaxy Quest -- plays Silk as cold,
manipulative, and downright spooky.</P>
<P>But the main problem with Heist is how surprisingly predictable the
story is.  Unlike the similar yet far superior The Score, there's never
any surprise during Heist's twisting.  Mamet has just become lazy with
this one.  Everything about the film looks great, but there's nothing at
all underneath.</P>
<P>Reviewed as part of our coverage of the 24th Annual Mill Valley Film
Festival.</P>
