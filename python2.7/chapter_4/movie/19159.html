<PRE>                         NEVER BEEN KISSED 1999
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1999 Timothy Voon
                  3 out of 4 for that one special kiss</PRE>
<P>Cast: Drew Barrymore, David Arquette, Michael Vartan, Leelee Sobieski,
Jeremy Jordan, Molly Shannon, John C. Reilly. Screenplay: Abby Kohn &
Marc Silverstein.
Producers: Sandy Isaac and Nancy Juvonen.
Director: Raja Gosnell.</P>
<P>I guess there are those who have never been kissed before (a rare and
dying breed), except if you're child – in which case it would be called
experimenting. Rarer still are those who have never been kissed before
they reach the twenties. Hardest to believe still, is that Drew
Barrymore has never been kissed. Despite all these hard to believe tit
bits, there are people out there who have never truly been kissed, and
who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet, sloppy
warm feeling of tongues intermingling, reassuring them that their search
for true love is over.</P>
<P>Well, this movie is about a girl waiting for the right boy to give her
the kiss of her life. And it's sweet. Drew Barrymore who shone in ‘Ever
After' is wonderful as ‘Josie, Grossy', the high school dweeb who becase
a professional editor, before being assigned by her paper to return to
school as an undercover reporter. It addresses the issues of how a
dweeb, becomes a prom Queen and finds the man of her life all in one
sitting. Hard to believe, but possible.</P>
<P>There may also be those who have been kissed before, but in fact, never
truly been given THE kiss. So this movie can be watched by those who are
waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it. Either
way, it is one enjoyable sit, with a fairytale ending.</P>
