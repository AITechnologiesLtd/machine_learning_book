minutes. Rated PG. </P>
<P>Technically and pictorially, "Fly Away Home" (by Carroll 
Ballard of "The Black Stallion" fame), is a small gem. In 
other aspects, some questions come up. 1) Will a bushy 
beard make likable lightweight Jeff Daniels more of a 
pronounced character? 2)Will Anna Paquin make the 
transition from Oscar-winner ("The Piano") child 
performer to teen-age star? 3) Does the movie move 
you? 4) Is it entirely believable? 5) Is this overall a good 
film? </P>
<P>The answers: 1) just a little; 2) perhaps; 3) now yes, now 
no; 4) not really; 5) yes.  </P>
<P>When her mother dies in a car crash in New Zealand, 
13-year old Amy is taken back to her native Canada by 
her long estranged (and idiosyncratic) father. She has 
trouble adjusting until she finds a raison d'etre by 
becoming Mother Goose to several orphan goslings. Dad, a 
hand-glider devotee among other things, helped by 
friends succeeds in building two motorized ultra-light 
craft. Rescuing the now grown-up geese from the Law, 
father and daughter fly south to winter quarters in North 
Carolina, each one his/her machine, followed by the now 
migrating birds.  </P>
<P>This is no tall tale. In 1988, Mr.William Lishman 
successfully led a flock of geese in like fashion. In 1993, 
with a team, he guided 18 geese some 400 miles from 
Ontario to Virginia, and in 1994, 38 birds over 800 miles, 
from Ontario to South Carolina. These and other 
experiments have been of major importance to 
threatened or endangered migrating species.</P>
<P>The film takes on even greater Mother Goose-ey fairy 
tale dimensions as it invents the character of Amy, with, 
however, elements from real life. Anna Paquin was born in 
Canada, her father was Canadian, her mother a New 
Zealander, and they were divorcing during the making of 
the film.</P>
<P>What personal traits William Lishman and Thomas Alden 
(Daniels) share, I cannot tell. Thomas is sketched out  as 
an eccentric, a sculptor, conservationist, flyer, inventor 
and a nut of sorts who lives in an "artistic" mess. Yet we 
still have no clear image of or feeling for him. </P>
<P>Little Orphan Amy is a rather sullen, a resentful daughter 
who doesn't warm up to a father she hasn't seen since she 
was three. To a characterless score by Mark Isham, Amy 
goes to boring school. Life is dull until the birds and their 
causes predictably bond father and daughter. Predictably 
too, Dad has a sweet, understanding girlfriend who is 
anxious to make friends with reluctant Amy. </P>
<P>A parallel sub-plot ties ecology and animal welfare. 
Technology and land development ("civilization") 
encroach as bulldozers tear up  Ontario's bucolic 
landscape. This factor figures later in the migration 
sequences.  </P>
<P>For its first thirty minutes the movie is one of mood, 
eccentricities and lovely nature, but lacks focus and is not 
particularly involving.  The turning point for me was 
esthetic, when at minute 32 Amy is briefly shown lying in 
a field in what looks like a beautiful imitation of the 
painting "Christina's world" by Andrew Wyeth. </P>
<P>The tempo picks up with the nurturing of the eggs, the 
hatching, the goslings who (as is common) identify the 
first being they see (Amy) as their mother.  She walks, 
runs, twirls as she calls to them. They follow her faithfully. 
Amy and her birds become an irresistibly enchanting 
sight, many degrees above plain "cute," especially as few 
things in life are as soul-satifying as humans and animals 
connecting with one another.  </P>
<P>When an official quotes ordnance 9314, which requires the 
clipping of wings of such geese, father and daughter 
explode and unite in protest and opposition.  Esthetic and 
emotional levels rise considerably.</P>
<P>The project to lead the birds to migration takes over the 
story, with good rhythm, interesting experiments made 
with flying machines (you wonder where the money comes 
from), the training of people and birds, the actual trek by 
air. For many of us the sense of worry and danger will be 
heightened by the memory of Jessica Dubroff, the 7-year 
old pilot who, with her father, crashed to her death 
several months ago. No doubt this gave nightmares to the 
filmmakers.</P>
<P>But talk of uplift! When we enter prime National 
Geographic territory, the flight of the humans and the 
birds is a gorgeous, fascinating succession of patterns, 
colors, landscapes and skyscapes. The incidents are quite 
attaching, even when they lean more to movie-movie 
events than fact. Some outlandish, even absurd scenes -- 
like flying through the canyons of Baltimore -- can only 
have been computer-generated, but still, they are not 
blatantly heroic.  As the film escalates from feel-good to 
feel-great, it becomes a joy for old and young.</P>
<P>Performances are good, partly because the characters 
play in quiet fashion, miles away from bombastic. It is 
more like the mood produced by massed strings than by a 
marching band. I do deplore the diamond that is put in 
Amy's nose, a trendy desecration of Indian culture -- but 
then the birds and the bird people make up for this 
generously.</P>
