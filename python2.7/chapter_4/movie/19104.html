<PRE>"Hurlyburly"</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by Heather Picker</PRE>
<P>     Directed by Anthony Drazan.  Written by David Rabe.  Starring Sean Penn
and Kevin Spacey, with Chazz Palminteri and Robin Wright Penn.  1998, 123 min.,
Rated R.</P>
<P>     The night before I watched "Hurlyburly," I watched Neil LaBute's "Your
Friends & Neighbors."  Both films share the common theme of disparity in the
lives of people who seemingly have it all going for them.  "Hurlyburly,"
directed by Anthony Drazan is about the self-absorption of a group of friends
and acquaintances.  Unlike the characters in "Your Friends & Neighbors," the
folks here hurt themselves and each other through drug use and words instead of
sex.</P>
<P>     Eddie (Sean Penn) is a casting director who lives in a Hollywood Hills
mansion with business partner Mickey (Kevin Spacey).  A brief but concise
introduction into Eddie's world opens the film.  Introduced as occurring "A
Little While Ago" (only to skip ahead a short while later), Eddie snorts
cocaine and nervously paces the room, and says "Heart's stopped.  I know how
you feel," as a picture of open heart surgery flashes across the television
screen.  At this time nothing more about the character and how he will behave
throughout the rest of the movie has to be explained or foreshadowed; there is
an almost instantaneous identification with the inner pain this man is in,
which so obviously contorts him, that just makes you feel like nothing will
really change, at least during the course of the next couple of hours we'll
spend with him, because he needs this distress in order to function the only
way he knows how.</P>
<P>     To say that there is plot, and then discuss it is not something that would
be enjoyable to read because the movie is basically one hundred percent
dialogue and is largely repetitive.  Adapted by David Rabe from his own play,
it is easy to imagine the script as one rather length soliloquy, as characters,
mostly Eddie, deliver rambling, occasionally incoherent speeches at such a rate
that there is little time for pause or action of any sort.  Some viewers will
be turned off by this, but these are characters who feel like they are drowning
in themselves figuratively as they literally drown themselves in drugs.  I
didn't mind that a lot of the same things were mentioned in different ways by
the characters, whose few tangible bonds are their shared feelings of
suffocating in their own thoughts, their own selfishness and constant
distraction.  Everything revolves around them, and they don't know whether or
not it is okay to feel like that, even though they do.  It is what makes them
human, and it is what made it a sometimes visceral viewing experience for
myself.  </P>
<P>     The elements of the story that aren't exactly cohesive but band together
characters and lead into the ending are as follows: Eddie is interested in
Darlene (Robin Wright Penn), who is also in show business, but Mickey becomes
involved with her first.  Friend Artie (Garry Shandling) shows up at Eddie and
Mickey's place with Donna (Anna Paquin), a teen runaway (?) who was living in
the elevator at his building.  He "gives" her to them as a CARE package, and
Mickey finds her more interesting a prospect than Darlene, so tries to pull the
noble friend routine by encouraging Eddie and Darlene to give a go at a
relationship.  Phil (Chazz Palminteri), Eddie's struggling actor friend and
small-time thug, is having marital woes and spends much of his free time
getting high, popping pills, and intimidating Donna at the Hills bachelor pad. </P>
<P>     Along for the ride is Bonnie (Meg Ryan), infamous in Eddie and Mickey's
circle for her promiscuity, who is tossed out of a moving car by Phil, after
Eddie tried to set the two of them up towards the end of a night of mucho
chemical (plural and of various natures) intake.  Bonnie is the most
out-of-place character, though Ryan makes a nice impression during her brief
on-camera stint.  The only reason necessitating even the mentioning of her
character is a story that the sober but soon not to be Eddie tells about Bonnie
engaging in what can definitely be considered bad-parenting behavior around her
young daughter, at the suggestion of Eddie and Mickey, who doesn't show any
emotion as Eddie disgustedly keeps on with the story.</P>
<P>     "Hurlyburly" boasts perhaps the best ensemble acting of 1998.  Penn is
astounding, and Spacey is perfect, and appears to revel in the sarcastic,
hypocritical lines Mickey gets to slyly deliver.  Robin Wright Penn, Shandling,
and Paquin don't have too much to do, but are solid in their roles, and
Palminteri is also great.  Drazan has a visual style that is mostly
uncluttered, which works well because the dialogue is the main attraction. 
Rabe has crafted a script that will be irritating and stilted, just adequate,
or revelatory depending on the viewer.  Some of the plot is strained, and about
an hour and a half into the film I knew what the "big event" would be that
would give some of the characters a chance for redemption, and I also knew how
they'd use that chance.  Predictable, but interesting to watch unfold.  </P>
<P>     DVD Details: New Line unfortunately didn't release the DVD as a part of
their Platinum Series, but it is nonetheless an affordably priced ($24.99,
available online for $14.99) disc with an attractively sparse look and some
good supplemental material.  Shown widescreen (the film's aspect ratio is
1.85:1) and anamorphically enhanced, the picture is mostly solid but at times
artifacts are noticeable.  Anything less than absolute visual brilliance is
considered substandard for a New Line DVD release, but the picture quality is
acceptable and quite good.  The sound is excellent.  Stereo surround and DD
5.1, in a movie that is entirely composed of dialogue, it more than suffices
and everything sounds crisp and clear.</P>
<P>     The main menu is simple and nice looking, with Play Movie, Special
Features, Scene Selections, and Language Selections options.  If you click on
the New Line logo you'll see disc production credits.  The theatrical trailer
is slightly grainy at times, gives the definition of the film's title, "n. 1.
Tumultuous commotion; uproar."  Cast and crew filmographies and biographies are
included, as are two full-length audio commentaries.  The first is with
director Drazan; he rhapsodizes on directing the adaptation, and David Rabe on
the writing process.  The second track is of Penn, Rabe, and author/social
commentator Janet Brown discussing the themes in the play and movie, and
selective music cues and insight from composer David Baerwald.  It isn't an "As
Good As It Gets" or "Bound" type of together-in-a-room discussion, rather
isolated comments with some stretches of just the movie in between.  Overall,
the second commentary track is interesting and informative.  </P>
<P>     Notes: Rated R for constant drug use, pervasive language, and some sexual
material.  I read a review saying this film isn't appropriate (in that
reviewer's opinion) for anyone under college age, but as a high school student
I can say that most mature teenagers can 'handle' seeing this movie.  </P>
<P>     The Verdict: "Hurlyburly" isn't for everyone.  It's story is hidden under
layer upon layer of dialogue, but it's lasting message and the excellent acting
are it's strongest suits and fans of dark, offbeat, edgy dramas with a healthy
dose of social commentary are most likely to appreciate it.  And the DVD is
another New Line home-run.
