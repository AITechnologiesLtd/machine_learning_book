<PRE>The Legend of Bagger Vance
A film review by Robert Strohmeyer
Copyright © 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Robert Redford's singular devotion to American mythology continues in
The Legend of Bagger Vance, the story of a golfer who's lost his swing
and the caddy who brings it back to him.  "Inside each and every one of
us," says Vance (Smith), "is our one true, authentic swing."  It's a
metaphor intended to apply to all walks of life, on the fairway or
otherwise.  If oversweet metaphors like this are your bag, then you're
really going to like Bagger Vance.</P>
<P>The story opens in the present with an aged Hardy Greaves (Jack Lemmon)
suffering a heart attack on a golf course.  As he lies quietly smiling
to himself, he muses on the frequency of his cardiovascular failures and
his love of the game of golf, which meanders into a quixotic narration
on the career of Rannulph Junuh (Damon).  Soon the narrative fades to
the past and we see Junuh at the height of his career, in the company of
the enchanting Adele Invergordon (played by Charlize Theron of The
Devil's Advocate fame; who, by the way, happens to represent the purest
embodiment of good, wholesome sex that the film industry has to offer).</P>
<P>Junuh is the greatest golfer in Savannah, Georgia, Miss Invergordon is
his true love, and they are about as privileged as anyone in the South
until Junuh ships off to serve his country in World War I, whereupon his
entire platoon is slaughtered in the grand history of Saving Private
Ryan.  Returning home he finds himself a mere shell of his former self
and--tragedy of tragedies--he has lost his golf swing.  This is about
the dumbest point in the entire film, the point at which I nearly wrote
the whole thing off.  There is absolutely nothing convincing about
Junuh's wartime horrors.  Damon's portrayal of shock at the sight of his
slain comrades is not unlike his appearance of dismay at losing his MIT
girlfriend in Good Will Hunting.  Fortunately, like any good
professional, I persevered.</P>
<P>Skipping ahead a few years, to the Great Depression, Miss Invergordon
has inherited her father's golf course and, determined to fend off
bankruptcy, throws a high profile golf tournament.  How exactly this is
going to work is not quite explained and, presumably, no one in town can
afford to pay admission, and she's giving away ten grand to the winner,
but anyway....  The two greatest golfers of the day are coming to play
and Savannah will be represented by none other than the washed up and
unshaven Rannulph Junuh.</P>
<P>Enter Bagger Vance.  Will Smith is predictably likable and witty as the
colloquially wise vagabond shaman who saves the day--and the story--from
otherwise certain grief.  The Bagger Vance character is not a new
archetype for Hollywood, but Smith's delivery of Vance's black Southern
dialect manages to convey an element often missed in such film
portrayals.  Where other stereotyped victims of segregation appear
merely ignorant or uneducated, we find a wit and, more importantly, a
will in Bagger's voice.  It's a subversion of language intrinsic to
African American culture, born of wisdom and cunning in the face of
adversity.  Will Smith's ability to carry this to the surface lends
wondrously to our imagination of his character, and forges a heightened
standard for future actors. Something in Smith's delivery is so
conducive to the suspension of disbelief as to render all things
permissible, and it took only a few scenes to reel this critic in.</P>
<P>In the end, Bagger Vance is a strong, memorable film, filled with rich
dialogue and vital camera work.  Though Redford seems to have fallen
back too heavily upon his overused and rambling A River Runs Through It
narrative style, the strength of the underlying story carries it off. 
Better directorial focus might have made for a hole-in-one, but as it
stands, this movie's a solid birdie.</P>
