<PRE>An American Werewolf In London
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring David Naughton; Griffin Dunne; Jenny Agutter; Don McKillop & Paul
Kember</P>
<P>An American Werewolf In London is John Landis' groundbreaking feature about
an American tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old
England. The groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects. More
specifically, the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a
werewolf; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character. Even twenty
years after its release, that part of the movie is still impressive.
Although, I would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie
that could be considered impressive. The rest of the movie is a run of the
mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure. If it
weren't for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf
transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone
largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980. And with good reason --
the acting isn't great and neither is the writing. Well OK, we don't
actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film. But one
other important element is lacking here too -- it isn't scary. With no
exception, you know what is going to happen before it happens. You don't
even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint. I will give
director John Landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror
films that I have ever seen. But John, it just wasn't scary. I didn't know
if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole
werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to
see it, but it didn't work for me. Actually, it was intended as a sort of a
spoof on horror films. But the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama
was so bad; the intended humor was lost on me. It's never a good sign that
you don't realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is
long over and you read it in the background material. Call me crazy, but you
shouldn't have to do research on a movie to enjoy it.</P>
<P>I'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much, since the
title pretty well sums the whole thing up. Werewolf bites boy (David
Naughton). Boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually
falls for pretty nurse (Jenny Agutter) and then strange things begin to
happen to boy. Including, and I must admit this is a very nice touch, visits
from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up
with him in the hospital. The neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly
deteriorating corpse. I know it sounds strange, but it actually works. The
scenes between David Naughton and the dead buddy (Griffin Dunne) are really
the best parts of the movie.</P>
<P>As I said, probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of
the special effects. While they are still impressive today, they aren't
impressive enough, or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film. And
since they are more or less the highlight of the film, there are far better
choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart
to watch. Actually, the 1998 sequel, An American Werewolf In Paris, is more
entertaining since it doesn't take itself as seriously and actually provides
a few more laughs along the way.</P>
