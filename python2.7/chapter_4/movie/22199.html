<PRE>The Waterboy
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Adam Sandler; Kathy Bates; Henry Winkler; Fairuza Balk & Jerry Reed</P>
<P>I still can't figure out why people went in droves to see this movie. Now
before you go assuming I'm some sort of high brow snob, who can't appreciate
a little dumb humor, let me say that I love cheap humor. I thought There's
Something About Mary was one of the funniest films that I have ever seen and
it was certainly one of the best films of 1998. Low brow adolescent humor
can be a lot of fun, the problem with The Waterboy is that it is just low
brow and adolescent, there is no humor component. I wanted to like The
Waterboy, I really did. I think I only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout
the entire movie. Actually, I smiled a couple of more times on top of that.
Not a great record for a 90-minute film. The problem with The Waterboy is
the same as most other Adam Sandler movies. Those responsible for this mess
seem to think that the sheer fact that Sandler walks around using a goofy
voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny
material. Nothing could be further from the truth, as matter of fact,
Sandler's idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film.</P>
<P>It's really a shame too, because this film had the potential to be very
funny. I personally believe that Sandler is probably a very talented
comedian, it's just that so far he hasn't been able to find the right film
to showcase his talents. If his only talent is making goofy voices and
playing morons, my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the
same road as the vast majority of the former stars of Saturday Night Live.
Most of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry.</P>
<P>Sandler plays a 31-year-old, somewhat mentally challenged, waterboy for a
college football team. The team's somewhat mentally disturbed coach (Henry
Winkler) realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pent-up rage, which,
if harnessed properly, would make him a force to be reckoned with on the
football field. You can figure out the rest from here. Sandler joins the
team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star.</P>
<P>As I said, the film had a great deal of potential. The idea was a decent
one, but the main potential of this movie is a result of the cast. All of
whom are very good, just hamstrung by really, really, lousy material. Even
Sandler, annoying goofy voice and all, has enough charisma and natural
comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material. Even as unfunny as his
character is, I still found myself rooting for him throughout the film. But
it is the supporting cast that I feel most badly about. If their material
had been just a bit better, this film could have been such a funny movie.
Fairuza Balk plays Sandler's leather-wearing biker-chick love interest and
does a great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time. Winkler is great
as the coach who uses a "Coaching For Dummies"-style book to help him get
through games. The real standout though, is Kathy Bates. Even with some of
the worst material of her career to deal with, she is still a treat to watch
in her role as Sandler's overprotective and overbearing Mama.</P>
<P>Even with the performances of Bates and Winkler, there is absolutely no way
I would recommend this movie. Although I get the distinct impression that
without them, this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me. Which
is sad, because I can't really put my finger on a particular element of the
movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became. It's
obvious that those involved, specifically the actors, tried very hard to
make what they thought was going to be a funny movie. It's just too bad that
99 percent of all of the jokes fell flat.</P>
