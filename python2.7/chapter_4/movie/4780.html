<P>     Robert Louis Stevenson gets the musical Muppet treatment in this 
swashbuckling story of a boy, a rat, and a Great Gonzo who find adventure 
on the high-seas, under the judicious green thumb of a gracious Captain 
(Kermit the Frog), and the watchful eye of a particular pirate (Tim 
Curry, as Long John Silver).  There's a surprisingly solid story to go 
along with the expected in-jokes, asides, and anachronisms; credit one of 
the writers, James V. Hart, who also co-wrote HOOK.  But just as Renny 
Harlin and Geena Davis failed to patch the leaks in CUTTHROAT ISLAND, so 
have Brian Henson and Frank Oz sunk themselves with MUPPET TREASURE 
ISLAND.  They've made a fine kid's movie that's *way* too slow for anyone 
over the age of eight.  Even the songs are dull.  Except, that is, for 
"Cabin Fever," an amusing number in mid-film that most adult viewers will 
be able to relate to.  Arrgghh. </P>
