THE EXORCIST
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ****</PRE>
<P>After missing its 25th anniversary a couple of Christmases ago, THE 
EXORCIST, the gold standard of horror movies, is being re-released to 
theaters.  In an expanded "writers-cut" -- Director William Friedkin was 
happy with its original edit -- the new version is being marketed as THE 
EXORCIST: THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN.  Eleven minutes of William 
Peter Blatty's script, based on his novel, which were left on the 
cutting room floor, have been restored.  The ending has been altered 
and, so that Regan's screams can really stir up the heavens, the 
original mono soundtrack has been replaced by one in six-track digital 
stereo.</P>
<P>First, let me get this off my chest.  I don't enjoy reviewing a film 
considered "a classic" for whatever reason, since everyone, including 
those who haven't seen it, typically has already formed strong opinions 
about it.  Covering the plot feels redundant and a bit ridiculous.  (In 
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, there is this guy named Moses ...)  And commenting 
on it is likely to inflame the prejudices of people who disagree with 
you.</P>
<P>As THE EXORCIST begins, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) has got problems: 
rats.  She's got rats in her attic, or so she thinks.  These noises 
prove to be the least of her problems when her angelic daughter Regan, 
played with an incredible intensity by Linda Blair, begins to cuss like 
a sailor.  Nominated for a supporting Oscar, Blair was beaten by Tatum 
O'Neal, whose performance in PAPER MOON pales in comparison to Blair's.</P>
<P>As Regan plunges into what looks like the depths of madness, her mother 
turns to a team of doctors, who put her through the modern medical 
equivalent of medieval torture in order to diagnose her aliment.  The 
problem, of course, lies not in Regan's body but in her soul.  After 
insisting that Regan has a "disorder of her nerves," the doctors finally 
throw up their hands and recommend that Chris look to the church for 
salvation in the form of an exorcism.  Their rationale, however, is that 
it's all in Regan's mind, but, if her mind believes that the devil has 
left her body, she will be cured.</P>
<P>With all of the fury of a rabid pit bull, Regan torments anyone brave or 
foolish enough to come into her room.  The film releases its terror in 
carefully controlled doses, which heightens its effective.  Venturing 
into Regan's room devastates the viewers as much as the priests (Max von 
Sydow and Jason Miller) who conduct the rarely used -- so we're told -- 
Catholic rite of exorcism.  For these reasons, most scenes occur outside 
the terror chamber, which helps fortify us for the descent into hell as 
we vicariously battle along with the agents of God against the Devil.</P>
<P>The movie's most famous scenes -- Regan's head doing a 360, her 
masturbating with a crucifix and her using projectile vomit like a venom 
spitting dinosaur -- are scary, gross and shocking.  Just imagine how 
audiences must have felt in the much more cinematically sheltered times 
of the early 1970s.  </P>
<P>So does this film deserve its normally associated sobriquet of "the 
scariest movie ever made?"  Perhaps.  As one who found THE BLAIR WITCH 
PROJECT lame and tame, I have a high tolerance for shock.  I don't know 
if THE EXORCIST is the most frightening ever, but it would certainly 
rank high on most people's fear scale.  And, maybe most shocking of all, 
I've never seen the film before other than a few excerpts.  When it was 
originally released, I believed its detractors and avoided the film 
entirely.  A bad move, which I have now corrected.</P>
<P>THE EXORCIST runs 2:12.  It is rated R for strong language and 
disturbing images and would be acceptable for those 17 and over.</P>
