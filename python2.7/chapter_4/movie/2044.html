<PRE>                                THE FUGITIVE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This is a fast-paced chase and murder
     mystery film based on a much more leisurely television
     series.  Ford is only okay, but Tommy Lee Jones is great as a
     wise-cracking U.S. marshal chasing Ford.  There is also one
     sequence with very impressive special effects.  Rating: +2
     (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     In September 1967 Dr. Richard Kimble found his wife murdered my a one-
armed man who escaped.  Kimble was found guilty of the murder and sentenced
to die.  But as police Lt. Philip Gerard was taking him to prison, the train
they were riding in derailed and Kimble was able to escape.  For three years
Kimble tracked the one-armed man and Gerard tracked Kimble.  Or at least
that was the premise of the television series THE FUGITIVE. that starred
David Janssen and Barry Morse.  THE FUGITIVE is also the name of a fast-
paced new film very loosely based on the twenty-six-year-old television
series.  In fact, the film version owes as much or more to Alfred Hitchcock
thrillers such as THE 39 STEPS, THE SABOTEUR, and NORTH BY NORTHWEST as it
does to the old Quinn-Martin series.  That series, itself intended as a
variation on Victor Hugo's LES MISERABLES, had a leisurely pace which is
just not the style of this tight and tense 127-minutes film.  There is very
little of the "nice guy mixing in people's lives" premise of the television
series in the new film.  The series was light on the murder aspect and the
film has more motivation behind the murder than three years of the
television show had.</P>
<P>     At least superficially, the film has the same premise.  Dr. Richard
Kimble (played by Harrison Ford, apparently still a little befuddled from
the brain injury in REGARDING HENRY) comes home from surgery late one night
to find his wife dead and a one-armed man in his house.  Nobody is
particularly convinced by Kimble's story and he ends up headed for Death
Row.  On the way there is an attempted escape and a bus crash, and then a
train comes along and slams into the bus.  This spectacular chain of events
leaves wide open an opportunity to escape as well as the mouths and eyes of
the audience.  Called in on the case is U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard
(substituting for police Lt. Philip Gerard, and played irascibly,
irreverently by Tommy Lee Jones).  And the chase has everything but the
laid-back style of the television series.  In the series Kimble would
typically befriend someone and after he saves their marriage , they would
help him escape.  In the film Gerard is much closer on the trail and the
escapes are much more physically challenging.</P>
<P>     I think Harrison Ford is miscast in this and many of his films.  He
plays characters who are very sharp but he always appears on the bland edge
of confusion.  Admittedly, he has a right to be as dazed as he appears,
after the events of the film, but at the same time he is supposedly making
clever deductions.  Tommy Lee Jones may be playing an honest cop--uh, sorry,
U.S. marshal--but he steals the film right from under Ford.  He really can
play with the mind of the viewer by saying just the right unexpected comment
at just the right moment.  And nearly as sarcastic is Joe Pantoliano as
Cosmo Renfro, assisting Gerard.  Pantoliano is a character actor who manages
to make small parts get noticed.  Sela Ward plays Kimble's wife and appears
to be the perfect reward for all the hard work of medical school.</P>
<P>     THE FUGITIVE is a terrific thriller that may stretch the credulity of
the audience at times, but leaves them well-entertained for better than two
hours.  I give it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>        ***HEAVY SPOILER*** ***HEAVY SPOILER*** ***HEAVY SPOILER***</P>
<P>     Here we have yet another mystery in which the solution does not quite
explain the mystery.  Apparently the drug company is involved with the plot
since they have lent security people to it.  It makes no sense that they
would do that without knowing the drug was faulty.  But a drug company is
not the same as General Motors.  It is *very* dependent on a good name
because the doctors who prescribe its products are a very cautious lot.  So
if you are a drug company, you might try to cover up the negligence of
letting a faulty drug get on the market, but you would be really cautious
about what has not yet been released.  Any possibility of scandal is very,
very strongly avoided.  At least, that is my understanding.  The story
holds together neither if you assume the drug company knew nor if you assume
it doesn't.</P>
