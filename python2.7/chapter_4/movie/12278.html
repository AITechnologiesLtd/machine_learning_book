<P>   A short while ago a woman was put to death in Texas for
the brutal pickax murder of two people.  The execution
followed world-wide protests in favor of clemency, not simply
because she was a woman but because she had reformed so
much during her long years on death row.  She had become
a kind, generous, born-again Christian, a pale shadow of her
former ruthless self, a transformation which led some to insist
that Texas would not be executing the same person. Even
more significant was the contention by another large block of
people that she was a fake: that human nature does not
change.</P>
<P>   Can human nature change?  Jean Valjean, the hero of
Victor Hugo's epic "Les Miserables," said himself that "the
world has not changed," and indeed, if we look around us we
find the planet is still teeming with poverty, homelessness,
vindictiveness as well as with examples of kindness,
generosity, and good will.  This is what gives "Les Miserables"
its contemporary appeal.  But if Valjean meant that the
individual cannot change, he was dead wrong as he proves
himself during the twenty-year span of the story.  Valjean is
changed by love--the respect accorded him by a bishop from
whom he stole; the affection he felt for a young prostitute; and
most of all for the adoration given him by an eight-year-old
girl whom he cared for over the course of two decades.  But
not everyone changes: Javert, the principal villain of this tale-
of-many-characters, is himself brutalized by his environment
and takes on an anal-retentive obsession with duty.  He is the
quintessential go-by-the-book creep.  The twenty-year
struggle between the miserly Javert and the beneficent
Valjean is probably what gives the story a universal appeal
that has made it popular throughout the world, has led to a
long-running Broadway musical, and has been the subject of
four films, featuring greats like Fredric March, Charles
Laughton, Michael Rennie, Gino Cervi, Jean Gabin, Richard
Jordan, Jean-Paul Belmondo, and now Liam Neeson.</P>
<P>   The current offering helmed by Bille August differs from the
1995 Claude Lelouch in that Lelouch framed the story by
placing it into a 20th-century landscape, ending in a story of
France during World War II.  In that, Belmondo is a simple
man who becomes like Jean Valjean as he helps a Jewish
family fleeing from the Nazis.  Lelouch wanted to impress us
with the impact that a single good man can have on the lives
of the people around him.  August's version is more
straightforward and suffers, by comparison, for its didacticism. 
Better suited for a high-school class of kids with no prior
knowledge of the narrative, this "Les Miserables" telescopes
the long social chronicle into a relatively brief 129 minutes
(Lelouch used 178) and spells out each detail so plainly that
the most classics-hating pupil would be able to follow--if not to
love--the adventure.  The photography is as direct as the
story is straight, in no way emulating the gauzy effects of a
Merchant-Ivory work.</P>
<P>   "Les Miserables" is a Dickensian tale which uses the
downtrodden people of Paris as a backdrop to its central,
moral narrative.  Bille August's version ignores the opening
scenes of the novel which shows Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson)
stealing a loaf of bread, gaining a five-year sentence, and
then having the penalty upped to nineteen after an escape
attempt.  We do witness his visit to the kind bishop who
allows him the use of his home and food and refuses to turn
him in when Valjean is picked up for stealing the old man's
silverware.  Much of the tale is a detective drama, featuring
the pursuit by the reformed Valjean by the obsessed police
inspector Javert (Geoffrey Rush), as Javert believes that a
depraved man will always be depraved and dangerous and
insists on apprehending Valjean.  Valjean becomes rich when
he invents a way to use jet for jewelry (also not shown in the
movie) and uses his wealth to better the lives of the workers
in his factory.  His life takes on much greater meaning when
he adopts the eight-year-old Cosette after the death of her
mother, Fantine (Uma Thurman), and while the Javert-Valjean
chase goes on, Valjean does not reveal to his charge that he
is not her real father.</P>
<P>   The beady-eyed Geoffrey Rush, who turned in a stunning
performance as a disturbed concert pianist in "Shine," rises to
the occasion as a man who is also disturbed, but is unable to
release his full energies because of the limitations of Rafael
Yglesias's pedantic screenplay.  Neeson is better able to
overcome the weakness of the script by his powerful
presence, though the tremendous love he feels for Cosette
does not really come across.  </P>
<P>   This "Les Miserables" is a fine text for helping students in
French Literature 101 but falls short of engaging the senses
the way a momentous melodrama of this caliber should.
Rated PG-13.  Running time: 129 minutes.  (C) Harvey
