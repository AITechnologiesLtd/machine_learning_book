<PRE>                                  HACKERS
                       A film review by Paul Presley
                        Copyright 1996 Paul Presley</PRE>

<P>Having recently applauded the merits of the venerable Sneakers, I 
may be in danger of sounding like a complete technophreak when I
mention that Hackers is also a very enjoyable film. As with Sneakers 
it manages to present an atmosphere that is very unique and one that
continues to grow on you long after the film is over.</P>
<P>What a lot of people may be thinking is that seeing as it is set in the 
world of the computer hacker it's either going to be so choc-full of 
technical mumbo-jumbo and computerese that they won't understand it,
or that it'll simply be another in the long line of action movies that 
treat 
computers in totally unrealistic ways (presenting them either as tiny 
boxes that can control the world or by showing a black and white 
version of Pac-Man and calling it state of the art).</P>
<P>What Hackers actually is, in my eyes at any rate, is a film with plenty 
of humour combined with a fairly accurate look at the lives of typical 
computer phreakers (as I believe the term has it). Okay, the running 
plot of a criminal terrorist plot seemed to be a little tagged on, but 
the 
film is saved from being dragged into the realms of ludicrosity by the 
aforementioned atmosphere that it creates. Everyone gives a very 
energetic performance, no one really jumping too much into the fore and 
allowing for people to play off each other with both style and wit.</P>
<P>The one area that people are going to argue over, quite naturally, is the 
look of some of the computer graphics. For example, when trying to hack 
into the computer of a large corporation we see stunning 
three-dimensional cyberspace vistas and all sorts of stunning imagery 
(when most of us know full well that all we'd really see is little more 
than page after page of scrolling text), but you have to understand that 
beneath the fake graphics, all the events and actions that take place is 
entirely truthful. Since scrolling text wouldn't make for entertaining 
viewing however, I'm perfectly willing to accept the visual 
representations shown. Plus, it all adds to the uniqueness of the 
atmosphere (sorry to be so repetitive).</P>
<P>Hackers is very much a 'youth' film, a piece that's very obviously 
pitched at the cyber-generation (as is evident by the very cool 
soundtrack), but it has a lot to recommend it to a more mainstream 
audience - not least of which being a script containing some of the 
funniest and most natural dialogue I've heard for a long time. Nothing is 
forced, terminology is just accepted and not attempted to explain to a 
typical 'stooge' character. It may paint a slightly more rosy picture of 
computer hackers than some may like, but for entertainment value I can't 
knock it. Sneakers still reigns supreme, but Hackers comes very close.</P>
