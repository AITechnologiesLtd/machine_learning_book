<PRE>CATS & DOGS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In a line of canine propaganda, Butch (voiced by Alec Baldwin) reminds us "Dogs
have always been man's best friend."  Cats, on the other hand, represent the
dark side in Lawrence Guterman's live action comedy, CATS & DOGS, a movie that
has enough on its mind to entertain the parents but is clearly aimed at the
youngsters in the audience.</P>
<P>In this eternal battle between cats and dogs, both sides are now armed.  A crack
team of secret agent dogs has doghouses that are worthy of NSA outposts.  Using
every weapon from radar to sonar to thermal imaging, they are tracking the
nefarious cats.  After admonishing his dog agents that "failure is not an
option," their leader goes on to remind them "one hundred million dogs have
placed their destiny firmly in our paws."</P>
<P>The three humans in the story are an out-to-lunch Professor Brody (Jeff
Goldblum), a mad scientist like Wayne Szalinski from HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS,
the professor's oblivious-to-the-obvious wife (Elizabeth Perkins), and their
son, Scott, played lifelessly by Alexander Pollock.  The professor is working on
a cure for dog allergies in humans.  With it, everyone can adopt a puppy without
worries.  This, however, worries the felines who figure that this would
constitute a cataclysmic shift in the balance of world power between cats and
dogs.  The cats want to stop the professor and turn his experiment to their use.</P>
<P>The feline arsenal includes everything from Ninja paratroopers to stealth poop. 
 Their leader, a snowball of a cat named Mr. Tinkles (voiced by Sean Hayes),
will stop at nothing in his mission of world domination.  His biggest problem is
a pesky maid who treats him like, well, a cat.  Most humiliating is her
proclivity for dressing him in cute little dresses.  The dog world looks to an
accidental new recruit, a sweet little beagle named Lou (actually short for
Loser), who is voiced by Tobey Maguire, to lead their battle.  Not surprisingly,
Lou rises to the challenge.  </P>
<P>The script by John Requa and Glenn Ficarra has many funny moments.  My favorite
line comes from a dog named Ivy (voiced by Susan Sarandon).  Although strictly
speaking she is a "stray," she prefers to refer to her condition as being
"domestically challenged."  The best moment comes in a totalitarian dictator
scene as Mr. Tinkles lays out his grand plan to his assembled masses.  It's a
stirringly funny scene.</P>
<P>Personally, I am waiting for the sequel, DOGS & CATS, so that the dogs' evil
ways can be exposed, and the sweet kitties can conquer.  Did I mention that --
although I love all animals -- I am definitely a cat person?  No matter.  Any
objective observer will see that the poor cats were railroaded in this comedy
and deserve a chance for revenge!</P>
<P>CATS & DOGS runs 1:27.  It is rated PG for animal action and humor and would be
acceptable for all ages.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 12, loved everything about the film and gave it ****.  He
especially mentioned how much he enjoyed Lou, Mr. Tinkles, the gadgets and the
animals' planning.  His cousin Matthew, age 5, gave the movie **** as well.  His
favorite part was the mice scene.  Matthew's brother Jacob, age 8, gave it ***. 
He enjoyed Mr. Tinkles's dress-up scenes the best.</P>
<P>The film is playing in nationwide release now in the United States.  In the
Silicon Valley, it is showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.</P>
