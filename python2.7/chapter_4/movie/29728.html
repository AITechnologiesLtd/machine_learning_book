<P>Once again, I'm apparently bucking the trend: Rotten Tomatoes lists
SERENDIPITY as "rotten", according to roughly 60% of its registered
reviewers.  Say La Vee; I never was much on trends.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**)
By sheer random chance - or was it fate? - Jonathan (John Cusack) and
Sara (Kate Beckinsale) meet in a New York department store; instantly
attracted to each other, though they are each involved with other
people, Jonathan and Sara coyly try to make a connection.  Sara, being a
big believer in Fate, doesn't give Jonathan much background on who she
is; she offers a test of Fate, and they both fail.  Their connection is
broken, and they go their separate ways.  End of story...or is it?</P>
<P>A few years later, Jonathan is engaged to his girlfriend Halleh (Bridget
Moynihan), and Sara is with her boyfriend Lars (John Corbett).  But
Jonathan and Sara's chance meeting still weighs heavy on both their
minds; Jonathan enlists his best friend Dean (Jeremy Piven) to help him
find Sara - and Sara does the same with her best friend Eve (Molly
Shannon).</P>
<P>But really - what's the chance they'll ever see each other again?</P>
<P>The Upshot:
It's been a long time since I came away from a movie feeling so pleased
across the board.  I was very much taken in by the crisp writing by Marc
Klein, director Peter Chelsom's keen eye for time passages and for New
York (though having recently come back from San Francisco, I found
myself wishing that The City By The Bay had been as lovingly caressed by
Chelsom as was NYC), the soundtrack (which I'll probably buy), and
especially the acting by the four main players.</P>
<P>Which - for the at least half of that acting group - is a huge
compliment, coming from me.  John Cusack gives another solid
performance; his Jonathan could have easily been Lloyd Dobler's big
brother.  Likewise, Jeremy Piven's turn as Jonathan's friend Dean is
indicative of Piven's long history of providing strong character support
in whatever project he's in.  Together, Cusack and Piven took a
situation that could've been easily played for straight yuks, and
endowed it with a humorous but quiet dignity that made me smile.</P>
<P>But it was the fine work by Kate Beckinsale, and especially Molly
Shannon, that brought me up short.  Beckinsale, because as one half of
the dimwitted duo in BROKEDOWN PALACE (shoutout to all my AOHell BP
review "fans"! uh, end sarcasm.), she completely failed to register in
my Good Actress Radar; maybe it was Beckinsale's true Brit voice that
made her Sara work for me here, who knows.  And Shannon, because her
work on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE and its dreadful long-skit movies, gave me
the hives.  Not so in SERENDIPITY, though; Shannon's understated
portrayal of Sara's friend Eve was so convincingly *normal* that I might
have to take back every nasty thing I've said about her right to breathe
the same air as me.</P>
<P>Eugene Levy's Anal Salesclerk schtick threatened to take this movie to a
place I really didn't want it to go.  And the unsurprising ending was
just that: unsurprising, though I was grateful that Chelsom and Klein
didn't take the totally easy way out by making Halleh and Lars unlikable
cretins that Jonathan and Sara just *had* to dump.  In the end, my
fortunate accidental discovery of SERENDIPITY was that it made a cool
Autumn afternoon a bit more pleasant.  And that's good enough for me.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
What I liked most about SERENDIPITY was its maturity in the face of an
implausible story; these characters were speaking in adult tones, in
spite of the ridiculous nature of this movie's concept.  The best of the
dialogue for them might not be words you or I would use in daily
language, but for me, they were words I *wish* I was clever enough to
use.  In this, SERENDIPITY was Light Romantic Fare at its best.</P>
<P>SERENDIPITY (rating: greenlight):
Okay, so SERENDIPITY is an unabashed chick flick.  Hey, this Chick has
no qualms with admitting to have been charmed outta my socks.</P>
