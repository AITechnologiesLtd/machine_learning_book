<P>IN SHORT: One for the ladies. 66% interesting for the guys.</P>
<P>Passion of Mind, which brings Demi Moore back to the big screen, is a
fairly interesting and intriguing tale of what may be a severe case of
schizophrenia or flat out insanity or a very credible dream life on the
part of the main character. It would have been easy enough to turn this
movie into a SF fantasy of parallel worlds, which would have made this
boy happy, but that wasn't what it was meant to be. Here's the
interesting part . . .</P>
<P>Somewhere in the sun-drenched south of France lives the young widow
Marie (Moore) who is raising two beautiful girls. Marie is a freelance
writer whose income comes from penning book reviews for the New York
Times, though there is a stack of unpublished stories sitting in a box
in the closet. She has no man in her life, indeed, she is still in love
with the one she lost and is not seeking out new companionship. Each
night she puts her kids to bed, locks her bedroom door from the inside
and goes to sleep. Each morning she wakes up in New York City, as Marty,
owner of the MMT & Associates Literary Agency. A single woman with no
children and no love life who dreams about a family in France.</P>
<P>No schizophrenia here, folks. Each woman is very aware of the "life" of
the other woman. Each believes it to be a wonderful dream reality and
each is envious of aspects of the other. Marty, with a severe demeanor
and hair pinned back wishes for love and children. Marie, a veritable
earth mother, dreams of the high powered career. Each seeks out a shrink
to help deal with the dream fantasy and come to grips with reality. Each
falls in love, Marie with a writer (Stellan Skarsgaard) and Marty with a
client's accountant (William Fichtner). The big question is, of course,
which reality is "real" and what happens if Marie/Marty lets her lover
stay the night. Who will be in the bed when she wakes up?</P>
<P>That's a very interesting pair of parallel stories playing out on
screen. Moore does a fine job keeping the characteristics of each woman
clearly defined. We all know that, sooner or later, one life is going to
assert itself. There were several ways this story could have gone when
it reached that point, and the back of my brain was working in overdrive
as it anticipated the possibilities. The direction the film takes,
though, sets its sights at the ladies -- when Passion of Mind's big
psychological revelation hit towards the end, the screening room was
filled with sniffling like a thing alive. This poor old male sat there
thinking "huh?" as the rest of the story played out.</P>
<P>It wasn't that I couldn't follow which one was real. Everything that
follows was way beyond this dumb guy. Passion of Mind has all the feel
of an arthouse flick. Whether the tear factor is enough to get the
ladies to lug their gents along is a matter of word of mouth. The first
two acts of this eventual chick flick are well done and should hold male
interest. The last act is going to need explanation.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Passion of Mind, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$4.50</PRE>
<PRE>just about Dateflick level.</PRE>
