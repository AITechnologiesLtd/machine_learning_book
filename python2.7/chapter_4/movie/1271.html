<PRE>                              MISSISSIPPI MASALA
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  What could have been prosaic Romeo-
     and-Juliet material has more interest when the communities
     are Indian and black and the woman's father is an Indian
     exile from Uganda who dreams of returning.  Rating: +2 (-4 to
     +4).
The advance publicity made MISSISSIPPI MASALA look like another Romeo and
Juliet story told on the backdrop of a  cultural clash.  In a way that us
what it is, but it also rises above that to tell the more interesting story
of a man who has lost his country because of the color of his skin and how
he must decide whether he is willing to pay the price to get it back.  It is
a story of Indian-black racial tensions on two continents in the 1970s and
the 1990s.</P>
<P>     In 1972 Idi Amin's reign of terror is reaching out to all non-black
residents of Uganda.  Jay (played by Roshan Seth) is a liberal Indian lawyer
practicing in Uganda.  After having given too frank an interview to the BBC,
Jay is thrown in jail.  A friend bribes Jay's way out of prison but, like
all non-blacks, Jay is thrown out of Uganda together with his wife and his
young daughter Mina.  He flees first to England, but finally settles down
with an Indian community in Mississippi.  There he does little but dream of
getting the new Ugandan government to restore his lands.  His wife supports
the family by running a liquor store in a black neighborhood.  Mina (played
by Sarita Choudhury), now grown up, becomes romantically involved with a
black man, Demetrius (played by Denzel Washington), who runs a  carpet
cleaning company.  There are the predictable repercussions in the two
communities.</P>
<P>     There are several nice ironies in the resulting conflict.  Demetrius
believes that the Indians behave too much like the whites.  Yet what we see
of Demetriius's family shows them living very much the standard white
American lifestyle.  They look a lot like the All-American family.  Joe
Seneca, incidentally, gives a stand-out performance as Demetrius's father.
It is Mina's family that lives int he squalid Motel Monte Cristo and
maintains their traditional customs.  It is the Indian Jay who wants to go
back to Africa to live, not the blacks.  One black does toy with the idea,
but it is clear the black family has roots too deeply set in the United
States.  There are some nice character portraits and vignettes of the Indian
community.  In one amusing scene we see a motel clerk practicing his bicycle
riding and his phone answering at the same time.</P>
<P>     Director Mira Nair previously did SALAAM BOMBAY which was popular with
the critics, but this is the more entertaining film.  I rate it a +2 on the
-4 to +4 scale.</P>
