<PRE>Lost Highway (1997)
*
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Potentially interesting story rendered dull and coldly distant by
David Lynch's perpetually smug and alienating style. There are better ways
to be conned.</P>
<P>Watching LOST HIGHWAY, I kept thinking about a picture puzzle that you spend
a week trying to solve, only to discover half the pieces are missing. I felt
conned; I'd lost two and a half hours of my life over a movie that added up
to exactly nothing. Everything in LOST HIGHWAY cancels itself out.</P>
<P>There are people who have argued this point with me at length, insisting
that was what the movie was about. I disagree, because LOST HIGHWAY doesn't
even bother to enlist our attention long enough to BE about anything. It is
a self-important and boring film that builds in its own excuses for being
and never tells us what they are.</P>
<P>The story actually has an intriguing presence. A jazz musician (Bill
Pullman) and his wife receive a series of videotapes in the mail. Someone is
walking around filming their house. Then the stranger gets bolder and starts
filming the *inside* of the house as well. Eventually, the tapes show
Pullman having murdered his wife -- and sure enough, guess what's happened.</P>
<P>Pullman is sent to prison, but while awaiting execution, he has a series of
bizarre Lynchian experiences in his cell and morphs into someone else
(Balthazar Getty), a young punk. Nobody can explain it, but they have to let
him go. That doesn't mean they can't keep an eye on him, of course.</P>
<P>As I said, all of this is potentially interesting. Not in Lynch's hands.
Everything I described is stretched out to fill the entire first hour of the
movie, which slithers by *so* slowly and lingers on every insignificant
gesture *so* painfully that by the time we get to the change-over, all
interest in the goings-on has been buried. The actors are not bad in their
roles -- they're just made into zombies. I was reminded of the way Robert
Bresson -- the French director with an almost paranoid loathing of actors
attempting to supersede the director's vision -- who made his actors repeat
scenes until they simply did them with mechanical precision and no attempt
at personification. Except that Bresson had a larger vision to communicate.
Lynch has nothing that we can discern, save the urge to be artfully bizarre.</P>
<P>The other day I saw BEGOTTEN, a movie with no dialogue and no real storyline
that succeeded excellently in being enthralling. Why did that work and LOST
HIGHWAY fail? Probably because BEGOTTEN was purer and not beholden to
anything remotely familiar. LOST HIGHWAY is so obviously David Lynch
indulging himself to no good end that we're alienated and fed up in short
order.</P>
<P>David Lynch has made two, possibly three films that I enjoyed: ERASERHEAD,
which was probably the best showcase for his homegrown surreal nightmares;
BLUE VELVET, which actually set up a story in the midst of his pretentions,
and THE ELEPHANT MAN, which made the most sense and was the most human.
Everything since, and no doubt from now on, has proven to be a waste of
time, and to be honest I'm not one to mourn.</P>
