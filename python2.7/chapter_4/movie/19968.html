<P>THE SIXTH SENSE
USA, 1999
Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan
Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Kent Johnson</PRE>
<PRE>Wow!</PRE>
<P>And to think I saw it on Mulberry Street -- er,  at the cineplex!</P>
<P>This is an incredible film, which hit me harder than any film I've seen
this year.  Definitely not something I expected from Hollywood.</P>
<P>THE SIXTH SENSE is a supernatural variation on the story of the
psychiatrist called in to examine a troubled child, who discovers that
the child is hiding some terrible knowledge.  It's not a horror movie,
but rather a suspense film/ghost story on the surface and an emotional
tearjerker about personal redemption underneath.</P>
<P>Horror fans won't be disappointed, however, as the mood and atmosphere
are great and the moments of shock, though few and brief, have
tremendous impact.  Unlike some films which are spoiled by ad campaigns
that give away too much of the plot, knowing what's going to happen in
THE SIXTH SENSE doesn't hurt it at all -- in fact it heightens the
suspense.</P>
<P>The film is beautifully, sensitively and subtly made.  It achieves the
filmic ideal of combining the entertainment value of a Hollywood film
with the vision and quality of an art film.  Contrary to post-Speilberg
filmmaking trends, it assumes its audience is *intelligent* and the
entire film, moment by moment, is a sheer pleasure to experience.  It
does everything right, without a single a false or fumbled step and the
end of the film is a huge cathartic release with a cleansing and healing
after-effect.</P>
<P>The film has great visuals which rather than being a self-conscious end
in themselves are part of the story-telling as a whole and a lot of
information is conveyed visually rather than verbally.  The dialog is
sparse and when used is meaningful and effective.</P>
<P>An example of one of the film's pleasant visual touches (and its belief
in the intelligence of its audience) is the lock of bleached hair that
denotes supernatural powers, visible on two of the characters in the
film.  The camera points it out, but it's never mentioned otherwise.  If
you notice and understand it, it's a little bonus that adds to your
enjoyment of the film, but it doesn't hurt it if you don't.</P>
<P>Another example of visual excellence is when a sunrise is viewed in
time-lapse photography entirely through the reflection of light on a
statue, making the coming of day seem like an unbearably spooky event.</P>
<P>The soundtrack is also very good and is used very effectively as an
integral part of the story-telling.</P>
<P>The acting in the film is uniformly excellent.  Haley Joel Osment, who
plays the boy Cole, is the keystone of the film.  Even with all its
other virtues, the film wouldn't have worked as well as it does without
someone of his ability in this role.  I don't know if a child actor has
ever won an Academy Award, but Osment definitely deserves one.  I was
also intrigued by the fact that Olivia Williams, who plays the
psychiatrist's wife, bears a slight resemblance to Chinese film actress
Joey Wong (Wong Jo Yin).</P>
<P>A wonderfully perfect film.  My Highest Recommendation.</P>
<P>[Because of the strong story, the film will still be good on video, but
I recommend seeing it in the theatre for maximum impact.]</P>
