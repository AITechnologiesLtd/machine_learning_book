                       A film review by Randy Parker

<PRE>RATING:  ****  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        DEAD POETS SOCIETY, "starring" Robin Williams, is anything but a
comedy.  While the film does have plenty of laughs, it wears the trappings
not of a comedy, but of a Greek or Shakespearean tragedy.  DEAD POETS
SOCIETY is at times quite serious and somber, and it's also without
question the finest film of the year.  Its riveting, gut wrenching drama
had me on the edge of my seat and glued to the screen.</P>
<P>        DEAD POETS SOCIETY is set in 1959 at Welton Academy in Vermont, a
private college prep school for boys where discipline almost has become an
end in and of itself.  The faculty has just one goal: to grind out future
lawyers, doctors, and scientists.  But one voice stands out amid the
school's rigid, narrow-minded administration; it belongs to Professor John
Keating, a Welton alumnus who has returned to the academy to teach English.</P>
<P>        Unlike his conservative colleagues, Keating employs decidedly
unorthodox teaching methods and strives to teach more than just his subject
matter, which is poetry.  His goal is to inspire his students to suck the
bone of life to the marrow, to seize the day and make their lives
extraordinary.  In Keating's class, you learn passion, courage,
romanticism, and--of course--poetry.  You pass if you avoid conformity and
find your own voice, and you fail if you neglect to live life to the
fullest.</P>
<P>        Robin Williams is nothing short of brilliant as Keating.  In the
classroom, he cuts loose and shows his usual comic flair with antics like
impersonating John Wayne while reading "Macbeth" aloud to his students and
conducting discussions as if the class were a game show.  But Williams is
most impressive in the quiet, dramatic scenes which require a knowing
glance or a subtle flash of sorrow.  Once again, Williams deserves
recognition and respect for his prowess at straight drama; he has matched
or surpassed his fine work in GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM, MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON,
and THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP.</P>
<P>        DEAD POETS SOCIETY, however, is not a Robin Williams vehicle.  In
fact, Williams is the first to admit that the movie doesn't even revolve
around his character: "I'm not carrying this film and I don't feel
pressured that the whole movie rests on me.  The real story of the film is
the boys.  I come in and I'm a catalyst, but how they react and their
tribute back is the power." (from the press kit)  Indeed, most of the young
actors in the large, ensemble cast of unknowns and newcomers have at least
as much screen time as does Williams.  The movie follows a handful of
Keating's students as they get swept away by their teacher's enthusiastic
spirit.  They decide to reorganize "The Dead Poets Society," a secret club
which used to meet in a cave (when Keating attended Welton) to experience
inspiration through poetry--their own and that of the greats: Whitman,
Keats, Thoreau, and so on.</P>
<P>        Broadway stage actor Robert Sean Leonard has perhaps the meatiest
role in the film.  He plays Neil Perry, a charismatic young man whose
membership in the society leads him to discover his passion for acting.
But unfortunately, his domineering, unyielding father stands in the way of
Neil's dreams.  Mr. Perry wants his son to go to Harvard medical school and
forbids him to engage in extracurricular activities (such as acting) which
might interfere with his studies.  Mr. Perry is played by Kurtwood Smith,
who seems to specialize in uptight, anal retentive characters (he was the
sadistic criminal in ROBOCOP and the dirty D.A. in TRUE BELIEVER).  Neil's
conflict with his father is infuriating, tragic, and in some ways, the
heart and soul of the movie.</P>
<P>        Director Peter Weir has elicited exceptional performances from his
entire cast.  Ethan Hawke is a natural as Neil's shy and inhibited
roommate, Todd, who suffers from low self-esteem.  Under Keating's
tutelage, Todd finally learns to express himself and to cultivate a sense
of self-worth.  Josh Charles is charming and endearing in a down-to-earth
John Cusack sort of way as Knox Overstreet, the club's resident tormented,
love-struck romantic.  The "Dead Poets Society" inspires Knox to find the
courage to declare his love to a cute cheerleader who attends the local
public high school.</P>
<P>        Gale Hansen, Dylan Kussman, Allelon Ruggiero, and James Waterston
(actor Sam Waterston's son) round out the cast as the other members of the
clandestine club.  And while the film doesn't fully develop every
character, each one seems complex and genuine, nonetheless.  These students
are much more than just stock characters.  In a radical departure from his
role as Dr. Auschlander on "St. Elsewhere," Norman Lloyd evokes fear and
contempt as Welton Academy's austere headmaster, Mr. Nolan.  His stiff,
uncompromising manner reflects the school's oppressive teaching
philosophy--a philosophy based on the four pillars of faith: tradition,
honor, excellence, and discipline.  While the students admire Professor
Keating's unconventional style, Mr. Nolan and the faculty react to it with
shock and disapproval.</P>
<P>        Perhaps the individual most responsible for DEAD POET SOCIETY's
impact is Australian director Peter Weir (WITNESS, THE YEAR OF LIVING
DANGEROUSLY, MOSQUITO COAST, GALLIPOLI).  With the help of Oscar-winning
cinematographer John Seale (RAIN MAN, GORILLAS IN THE MIST), Weir has used
the medium to its fullest.  The director's imaginative camera work and
Seale's breathtaking cinematography make the film absorbing and
exhilarating.  Weir and company shot DEAD POETS SOCIETY almost entirely on
location at St. Andrew's School in Delaware, and they have made good use of
the school's photogenic qualities, such as its 2,000 acres of beautiful
farmland and gloomy stone architecture.  Complementing the film's superb
direction and acting is Tom Schulman's incredibly literate script, which is
based in part on his own experiences at private school.</P>
<P>        DEAD POETS SOCIETY is virtually flawless.  As you watch the movie,
you keep expecting it to make some fatal blunder: to become melodramatic,
to succumb to predictable Hollywood cliches, or to milk an easy laugh.  But
DEAD POETS SOCIETY avoids these pitfalls.  Every time you think you know
where the film is headed, it surprises you by going in an altogether
unforeseen direction.  Even Academy Award-winning composer Maurice Jarre's
score is immaculate; it is rousing without being overbearing or
distracting.</P>
<P>        And I should warn you that DEAD POETS SOCIETY will make many of you
cry or come damn close.  If you want to see a crazy Robin Williams comedy,
go rent POPEYE, because DEAD POETS SOCIETY is for people looking for an
intellectually stimulating and emotionally involving cinematic experience.</P>
