<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>What would you do if you could turn invisible? The possibilities are
virtually limitless. There are the cheap, visceral thrills, such as 
sneaking into changing rooms and dormitories. There are more noble
pursuits, like acting as a genuine force for good in your community.
Perhaps you could offer your services to the government as a crack
espionage agent. Well, if the makers of "Hollow Man" are to believed,
you'd probably take a page from any generic slasher movie of the past
twenty-five years and start hunting down your friends in gory, if not
particularly imaginative, ways. Uh huh.</P>
<P>Inspired by, though not really similar to, HG Wells' novel "The Invisible
Man", "Hollow Man" is about a team of scientists trying to create an
invisibility formula (here it's described as "going out of quantum synch"
with the universe, but of course that's just the technobabble 
explanation). The project head is Dr Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), an
arrogant genius with more than a slight streak of megalomania. His
assistants include ex-girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue) and Matt (Josh 
Brolin), who are sleeping together behind Sebastian's back.</P>
<P>In fact, the team has already figured out how to make people become
invisible -- the problem lies in trying to reverse the effects. In a flash
of inspiration one night, Sebastian thinks he figures it out, and indeed
their test gorilla Isabelle is successfully made visible again. Without
informing his superiors, Sebastian decides to proceed to the next stage of
the experiment and test both serums on a human subject: himself. But
although he becomes invisible without undue difficulty, the antidote
proves to be useless on humans, and Sebastian is trapped in his
phantomlike state. Soon, the tantalising possibilities invisibility offers
become too much for Sebastian, and he begins to succumb to his base
desires.</P>
<P>"Hollow Man" falls short in all moviemaking fundamentals: plot,
characterisation, atmosphere. Even Paul Verhoeven's directorial flair, 
striking in "Total Recall" ten years ago, is absent here, as the director
continues the downward spiral most recently evident in the tedious
"Starship Troopers". I find it appalling that a movie can take such a
great, multifaceted concept -- invisibility -- and hogtie itself to a
standard old slasher storyline. And "Hollow Man" isn't even a particularly
good slasher film, because we're not so much as afforded an interesting
death sequence. Sebastian's murderous rampage, when it finally comes, is
without tension, excitement, or invention. It's just an invisible guy
killing people, as if that single gimmick would somehow enliven the entire
film. There's no effort to create any suspense, or to really shock the
viewer; it just feels like the filmmakers are going through the motions,
and rather feebly at that.</P>
<P>Personally, I'm more interested in special effects where I can see
something, rather than those where I can't. Sure, a good job is done to
achieve the appearance (as it were) of invisibility, and I'm sure it took
a lot of hard work, but the gosh-wow factor is exhausted pretty quickly.
The same goes for the scenes where Sebastian suddenly becomes
semi-visible, when he is immersed in water or smoke or whatever. The first
such sequence is appealing; the concept gets tired soon thereafter. 
Indeed, the only effects which really left an impression on me were the
scenes where the invisibility formula and its antidote are employed --
first on a gorilla, then on Sebastian. Instead of taking effect all at
once, the serums work layer by layer, giving us a view of the inner
workings of the bodies like an anatomy textbook brought to life.</P>
<P>Beyond this, there is little to recommend "Hollow Man". Kevin Bacon does a
reasonable job in a role in which his voicework is paramount. But 
Sebastian Caine is a desperately uninteresting character. We are robbed of
the chance to investigate whether or not it is invisibility which has
affected his mind, because he's clearly on the edge even before the
experiment. A far more interesting approach to have taken would have
been to give us a less unscrupulous character and really delve into the
temptations he experiences. Sebastian is already such a bastard that his
swift decision to abandon his already loose morals comes as little
surprise. I realise that "Hollow Man" is, first and foremost, a thriller,
and I am not suggesting that it should have been bogged down in ethical
posturing. But I think a more clever movie could have balanced its
protagonist's inner turmoil with the requisite action scenes.</P>
<P>To make matters worse, the screenplay by Andrew W Marlowe (from a story
co-conceived with Gary Scott Thompson) doesn't even come up with
interesting things for the invisible Sebastian to do. Indeed, of all the
scenes involving Sebastian's abuse of his power, the only one that's at
all intriguing is the very first one, where he molests a co-worker (Kim
Dickens), with her being only barely aware of it. There is a definite
eroticism to this scene, not the least because of the conflict previously
established between the two characters. But it's all downhill from there
-- we subsequently get another excuse for partial nudity, and then it's
slasher time. That such a fantastic premise is so thoroughly wasted is the
surest sign of the sheer creative bankruptcy of the movie.</P>
<P>Amongst the supporting cast, Shue and Brolin try gamely to play the
heroes, but neither of their characters have much personality to speak of.
The film's engagement in a bit of role reversal, casting Shue as the more
proactive of the pair, is but a minor triumph. Most of the other
characters are simply there to act as cannon fodder, although Dickens and
Joey Slotnick make the most of their small roles. No fair guessing who
survives and who doesn't, though. In order to surprised on that point,
there would have to be some imagination behind the movie. On the set of
"Hollow Man",  it seems that bodies weren't the only things made to
vanish.</P>
