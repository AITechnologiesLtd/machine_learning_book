<PRE>The Review</PRE>
<P>    Outside Providence is a cross between Detroit Rock City and
countless fish-out-of-water films such as Crocodile Dundee. Peter
Farrelly, writer of There's Something About Mary and Dumb & Dumber, goes
for an intelligent, non-physical style of comedy here, but mars it with
misplaced, unneeded bits of drama. Many scenes make you laugh out loud,
occasionally even applaud, and with a better script and tighter
direction from Michael Corrente, Outside Providence could have been a
success.</P>
<P>    The story follows Tim Dunphy (Hatosy), "Dildo" to his blue-collar
father (Baldwin), as he is sent off to prep school in 1974. His slacker,
drugged-out friends (including one hilarious buddy named Drugs) are
sorry to see him go, but their lives really don't change much with his
departure. Once arrived at his new home, Tim manages to find a group of
students who enjoy the same pastimes as he does (drinking, smoking,
doing drugs etc.) and meets a love interest, Jane (Weston). He has many
misadventures, often involving getting in trouble with the dorm master.
Unfortunately, the Farrellys and director Corrente chose to add some
drama to their film, giving Tim a dead mother with a tragic past, a
girlfriend whose aspirations of going to Brown University become
uncertain, and a crippled younger brother.</P>
<P>    When the Farrellys go for laughs, they consistently hit their
target. They have perfectly caught the diction, attitude and humour
found in potheads from a small town. Tim and his friends spend every
night getting high and drunk, often with surprising results. Some of the
humour is typical of the gross-out humour permeating 1999 so far (a
student who has never done drugs before throws up on a classmate), but
the majority is intelligent and witty, concentrating on the lack of
schooling and vocabulary of the young men (one student declines a joint,
saying "no, I want to remember this moment, I want to saviour it.") The
awkwardness of youth  is expertly explored as well, with freshmen
getting "froshed" (vicious humiliating pranks played on them) and young
men mooning over the picture of their secret love.</P>
<P>    Director Michael Corrente needs to find his own vision for his
future endeavours. Outside Providence suffers from a bad case of
deja-vu. Whether it is the montage of romantic moments between Tim and
Jane that plays during a low period in their relationship, or Tim's
becoming a good student, numerous scenes are copies of past films. Even
the soundtrack of tunes that can be found in every film about the 70s is
familiar, with several songs having already appeared on a soundtrack in
1999 already. Alec Baldwin and his poker buddies are funny but unneeded.
Baldwin is particularly good at playing the ignorant blue-collar dad,
but unconvincing in his one dramatic scene. George Wendt gives the film
another familiar face, and a plot twist that has nothing to do with the
film. Shawn Hatosy and Amy Smart ably carry the film's major roles, with
Hatosy in particular doing a better job of being an unschooled 70s
stoner than any cast member from Detroit Rock City.</P>
<P>    Outside Providence will make you laugh quite a bit. It is unoriginal
and unnecessarily dramatic as well, but if you don't care about such
things, you will likely love this film. Everyone else will consider this
film an amusing distraction, but that's all.</P>
