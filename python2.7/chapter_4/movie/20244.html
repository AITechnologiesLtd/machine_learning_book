<PRE>_In_Too_Deep_ (R) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The title _In_Too_Deep_ describes the situation its young undercover cop
hero finds himself in, but it also aptly describes the predicament of the
film's cast.  An uncommon amount of talent appears before the camera, but
their abilities are not well-served by this routine urban drama.</P>
<P>Two actors are able to transcend the tired material they are given: the
leads, Omar Epps and LL Cool J.  Epps plays the cop, rookie Cincinnati
police officer Jeff Cole, who loses his sense of self during a deep cover
operation designed to bust druglord Dwayne Gittens, a.k.a. "God" (LL Cool
J).  Epps makes a strong and likable protagonist, and as such his
character's flirtings with the dark side makes for some involving drama. 
However, LL Cool J is the more commanding presence as God, at once cold
yet so appealingly charismatic that it is easy to see how people are
drawn to him.</P>
<P>But director Michael Rymer and writers Michael Henry Brown and Paul
Aaron don't give their equally able supporting players much to work with,
largely due to the formulaic paces of their story.  Stanley Tucci has the
token commanding officer role, and his meatiest scene is the old reliable
one where he tells the increasingly out-of-control Cole that he is off
the case.  (Of course, Cole eventually worms his way back onto it.)  Nia
Long is wasted in the most thankless role of Cole's love interest, who,
as par for the course in films such as these, tells Cole that she can't
be with him as long as he's on his case.  And Pam Grier, whose memorable
turn in _Jackie_Brown_ apparently wasn't the career-ressurrector it
should have been, lends her steely presence and is required to do little
else as a veteran cop.</P>
<P>_In_Too_Deep_ isn't necessarily a bad film, just an average one, and
therein lies the big problem.  With the amount of talent at their
disposal, the filmmakers should have been more motivated to come up with
something a bit more inspired and distinctive.  Instead, they simply
settled for the routine--something that the cast shouldn't have to settle
for.</P>
