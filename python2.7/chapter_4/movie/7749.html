<P>Truly great Christmas films have much nostalgia to them. "A Christmas Story"
is definitely one of the best because it will remind anyone of their
childhood - begging their parents and Santa Claus to bring them something
they wanted so bad. This is a story of one boy's dream of the Ultimate
Christmas Present. </P>
<P>The story revolves around Ralph Parker (Billingsley), a boy in fourth grade
in 1950s middle America, where everything is alright and where "Leave It To
Beaver" might take place. This movie uses a technique that isn't used
anymore: an older man (Shepherd) narrating his childhood. The approach works
well as we can get inside Ralph and know how he thinks and feels. </P>
<P>Ralph wants to a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas. Of course Ralph's parents
and other adults are worried. "You'll shoot your eye out" is what the entire
world seems to be telling him, but he doesn't give up. When asked to write a
"theme" for class, he writes about how happy getting the gun would make him
and how he'll be careful. There is a great scene where he imagines he gets
the paper back and the teacher gives him an A with a thousand pluses on it,
while the other children applaud him and carry him like a king. This is great
storytelling because all kids (well... at least boys) have these kinds of
fantasies, but so few films play upon them so well.</P>
<P>But the film is not just about the want for that gun, it's about being a kid
in America. We see Ralph and his friends constantly daring each other, one
such incident leading to a tongue frozen to a flagpole - that's so true!
There's also his little bratty brother always falling behind and whining
(isn't that all little brothers exist for?). There are even two bullies who
torment Ralph and his friends.</P>
<P>Somehow Ralph survives Advent, but then gets himself into big trouble when
he uses "the F word." I've never seen a kid suck on a bar of soap in a film
before, and it's the little things like this that make this film so accurate
in its depiction of adolescence. Is there any way Ralph will get that BB gun
now?</P>
<P>"A Christmas Story" is not a landmark in film history, but it is a good
movie. The atmosphere, the acting, and the directing all add up to a good,
quality family movie that isn't cliche, cheesy, or even preachy. Overall, it
is one of the most original Christmas movies ever.</P>
