MPAA Rating: R
Review: **** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Dehumanization is at the heart of almost every film by Stanley Kubrick,
but none so much as his masterfully disturbing and ultimately edifying
"A Clockwork Orange." What makes it is troublesome is not the violence
itself, but the film's suggestion that violence is an inherently human
characteristic, and to take that potential away from someone is to, in
effect, make him less than human. That's hardly a pleasant thought, and
you have to wonder if it's the theme of this film, not so much the
actions portrayed on screen, that generated such controversy when it was
first released in 1971.</P>
<P>Through a first person narrative, the film traces the adventures of its
hero Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell), and his gang of Droogs (Warren
Clarke, James Marcus, and Michael Tarn). The film is set in England in
the near future -- a future which vaguely reflects our own, but it seems
that society has started to crumble, and at night the streets are
overrun with teenage gangs who run free of parental control. According
to the original novel by Anthony Burgess, Alex is only 15 years old
(although McDowell as 26 when he played him), which adds an additionally
disturbing dimension to his antics because he is at such a young and
customarily vulnerable age.</P>
<P>The first half hour of the film is a relentless portrayal of a typical
night for Alex's gang. They start off in the Korova milk bar, drinking
drug-laced milk that "sharpens them up for a bit of the old
ultraviolence." After leaving, they happen upon a drunk beggar who they
first ridicule, then beat senseless. They later happen upon a rival
group in the midst of raping a woman, and a gang fight ensues. Still
restless and looking for something to do, Alex and company steal a car,
break into a the isolated home of Frank Alexander (Patrick Magee), and
rape his wife in front of him. Even then, they still go back to the milk
bar for a few more drinks before going home at dawn and sleeping through
school.</P>
<P>Kubrick presents the violence in a dizzying, heightened fashion that
makes it alarmingly attractive. With close, hand-held camera shots, he
invites us to join Alex in raping and pillaging to show that violence
and power are inherently attractive. Alex is like the Freudian id
running free, and that pulls at something in all of us, making this film
all the more uncomfortable because you find yourself sympathizing with
such a morally repugnant person.</P>
<P>Alex's twisted life seems safe and secure, until one night his Droogs
double cross him when he's breaking into a woman's home. During an
attempted rape, he accidentally kills the woman with a giant phallic
statue, and his friends leave him for the police. He is subsequently
arrested, spit on and beat by the cops, and sentenced to prison.</P>
<P>While in prison, he hears of a new reform treatment, and willing to do
anything to get out of the suffocating world of prison life where he can
only dream of violence, Alex volunteers as one of the subjects. The
experimental treatment involves his being strapped to a chair in a movie
theater with his eyes pried open with clamps. He is then given a drug
and forced to watch violent films. The drugs causes him to feel
nauseous, and therefore his body adapts so that any time he is exposed
to anything violent, he becomes sick. He is therefore conditioned
against violence, and as the government proudly points out during an
ironic stage display to prove the success of the treatment, he is the
ultimate in goodness, unable to harm a fly.</P>
<P>And so he is released into the world where he runs into all the people
he harassed as a young hoodlum, including the drunk beggar, the husband
of one of his rape victims, and even his old Droogs who are now corrupt
members of the police. This all feels like contrived plot conveniences,
but "A Clockwork Orange" is really more of a fable than a story. It is
devised entirely to make its point about the nature of free will, and
everything in the film is contrived to work to that end.</P>
<P>Of course, Alex is unable to defend himself in the evil world he helped
create, and he becomes the victim. It is both harshly ironic and
ultimately heartbreaking. He is, as Burgess coined the term, a clockwork
orange -- seemingly a healthy and vital human on the outside, but inside
he is programmed, no longer able to make choices for himself.</P>
<P>Kubrick is single-minded in his goal, and at times the film feels a bit
preachy, especially near the end. But the rest of the film is unnerving
and invigorating in its ability to manipulate the audience. Never has
such a vile character been so charismatic and attractive as Alex.
McDowell's performance is cunning and lethal in its sincerity. He can be
brash, funny, horrifying or sympathetic.</P>
<P>Kubrick never gives Alex any excuses for his behavior -- he just asks us
to accept him as is. Reasons for his behavior are never clearly
explained -- his parents are shown, but they are weak and unguiding,
easily manipulated by Alex's obvious intelligence and craftiness. A
better explanation may come from the society he was raised in, which is
slowly but surely losing its moral fiber, and becoming a military state
with no care or control of its people. The state is so desperate that it
is willing to program its citizens in order to gain control, a sure sign
that they are near the end.</P>
<P>"A Clockwork Orange" continues to be a powerful film, more than
twenty-five years later. The on-screen violence, while probably less
explicit than half the action films shown today, still resonates of true
horror because it is tied to a deeper meaning, not just surface
exhilaration. With its dynamic futuristic set design by John Barry,
pulsating classical music score, and striking visuals by John Alcott
(who also did Kubrick's "2001" and "Barry Lyndon"), this is one of
Kubrick's masterpieces, a film will continue to strike chords and rattle
nerves for years to come.</P>
