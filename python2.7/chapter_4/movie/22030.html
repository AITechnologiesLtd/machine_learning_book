<P>The World Is Not Enough a.k.a. James Bond XIX</P>
<P>Well, another James Bond movie. Still with Pierce Brosnan, but this time
with Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards making it to the well-known
Bond-girls list. A James Bond movie isn't a James Bond movie without these
elements: explosions, beautiful babe, James driving a car, Q's gadgets,
casino scene, Martini "shaken not stirred", another beautiful babe, guns,
dangerous action, bombs, an a whacky villain. And it's the same with this
one. It has all those elements, so it's a complete JB-movie.</P>
<P>If you have seen the last JB movies, especially those with Pierce Brosnan,
than the plot is much or less the same. Only this time, M (James' boss) gets
involved personally. Actually I don't feel like telling you the plot,
because a James Bond movie always have the same plot.</P>
<P>The opening scene was cool, because of the shots of the Millenium Dome. And
a lot of other action scenes, but at some point I experienced some dejavu,
like I already saw that stunt in an earlier JB. Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.
In any case, the name is still "Bond, James Bond".</P>
<P>If you're a big JB fan then go. Why bother reading this review anyway? If
you're not a big fan, go see it if you have spare time and money, which most
of you have on Christmas anyway. But if you hate this guy, then don't go.</P>
<P>After I saw this movie, I was walking to my car. In the background Annie
Lennox was singing "Hey, hey, I saved the world today...". In my opinion,
that song would have been way way better than Garbage.</P>
