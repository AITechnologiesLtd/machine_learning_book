<PRE>                  Our rating: two lava lamps (out of five).</PRE>
<P>If Cameron Poe, Nick Cage's character in Con Air, had had a better lawyer
at his trial, then it would have saved us all a lot of grief. Somehow, his
attorney (A rare appearance by Lionel Hutz outside of The Simpsons,
perhaps?) convinces him to plea guilty to a manslaughter charge as part of
a plea bargain, and then the judge turns around and gives him the full
sentence anyway. A real lawyer might have objected, raised his hand,
coughed loudly, something, but not Poe's. Poe's lawyer waves bye-bye as
they haul his client off to jail.</P>
<P>You see, Cameron Poe, veteran Army Ranger, killed a man who assaulted him
outside a bar. Again, a real lawyer might have tried to claim it was in
self-defense, or even in the defense of his wife and unborn child.
Instead, this Hollywood lawyer lets Poe go to prison when the judge
mutters some nonsense about his Ranger training qualifying him as a deadly
weapon. If we had a good lawyer, we might think about suing Touchstone
pictures for false advertising -- they claimed this was a good movie.</P>
<P>Con Air is one of the latest in the long string of action "event" movies
that have visited us each summer since 1988's Die Hard. Unfortunately, few
of them have managed to capture Die Hard's magic, although the body counts
and testosterone levels have only gone up. Con Air isn't one of the better
efforts.</P>
<P>Poe is paroled about seven years after his conviction, and he's scheduled
to go home to his wife and daughter aboard a prison transport plane.
Because Poe is in an action event film, however, his plane is hijacked by
the other prisoners. These aren't just any prisoners, though. They're the
meanest, orneriest, most psychopathic killers and rapists that the
screenwriter and casting agents could cook up. Frankly, they're a bit
disappointing.</P>
<P>First up is Cyrus "the Virus" Grissom (John Malkovich), the mastermind
behind the escape. His second-in-command is Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames), a
black militant playing along with the white guy until the breakout is
over. Steve Buscemi shows up later in Hannibal-Lecter-style restraints as
Garland Greene, serial killer extraordinaire. There are also a dozen other
inmates too inane to describe.</P>
<P>Poe plays along, hoping for an opportunity to extract himself from the
situation, but he's prevented from doing so by certain contrived
circumstances. Circumstance #1: his diabetic cell buddy, Baby-O, is also
on board, and needs a shot of insulin to live. Circumstance #2: The only
guard to survive the first round of hijack hyjinx is a woman named Bishop
who quickly becomes a target for the token serial rapist. The rapist,
Johnny 23, is played by Danny Trejo, who should stick to acting in Robert
Rodriguez movies. Even when he played a vampire in From Dusk Til Dawn, he
was allowed to let his charisma (or as much charisma as a mean scary
Mexican ex-convict can muster, no offense Danny) shine through. Here he's
just repulsive.</P>
<P>Tracking down these escapees from the ground is U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin
(John Cusack). He's the good cop. Forcibly partnered with Larkin is DEA
Agent Duncan Malloy. He's the bad cop, and he's played by Colm Meaney.</P>
<P>Huh? Colm Meaney? Likable, huggy-bear, "Chief O'Brien" Colm Meaney?
Considering that the casting agents on this film seemed to have every
found every unsavory character actor west of the Mississippi, what
possesed them to cast one of the most instantly likable character actors
working today as the cop at whom we're supposed to hiss? His sole
qualification for the role seems to be his ability to swear convincingly.
Fair enough. But as soon as he showed up in Con Air, his appearance
heralded by smarmy music, we started to have trouble suspending our
disbelief. We mean, c'mon! Colm Meaney would never be any less than a
concerned, good-hearted guy, and these people have him parking in the
handicapped spot.</P>
<P>The object of the film, of course, is to allow Cage to get in some serious
good-guy time, pretending to go along with the bad guys while looking out
for his buddies and saving the day. He manages to alert Larkin to the
escapees' actual destination, and then continues to foil the convicts'
plans even after they discover that he's working with the cops. Cage
himself set off our Fake Accent Detector with a southern drawl so bad that
one wonders how he could have been so good in Raising Arizona and so bad
in this movie.</P>
<P>The action junkies in our readership have been patiently waiting for us to
mention the stunts and fight scenes. There are plenty of them, but they
seem a bit watered-down, as a lot of American action movies seem in these
days of John Woo and Quentin Tarantino. It's neither gonzo enough (Woo)
nor is it particularly shocking (Tarantino). The gunfights have a routine
feel to them, and the various plane-crash sequences didn't get our
adrenaline pumping. There are a few good visual gags that result from the
carnage, but you've seen all this action before and done better elsewhere.
Perhaps the strangest thing is that the final conflict takes place on a
speeding fire truck after the titular plane has crashed. After a plane
crashes on the Vegas strip, did the film makers really think we'd be
excited to see what amounts to a car chase? Hint to future action
moviemakers: End your movie on a high note.</P>
<P>All through the film, we're hammered again and again with what a great guy
Cameron Poe is. He's loyal, chivalrous, a good parent (!), etc etc. All of
this is supposed to contrast against the backdrop of the scum of society
all around him. It's obvious that the moviemakers have a message for the
audience, but the clearest message to us was that we should have rented a
different movie.<HR></P>
