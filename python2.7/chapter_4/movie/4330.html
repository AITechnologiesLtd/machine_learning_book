<PRE>                              WHITE MAN'S BURDEN
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     What would happen if race roles in America were reversed?  What if
blacks had all the power, and whites had to fight prejudice and racism at
every turn?  Such is the setting of writer/director Desmond Nakano's
brilliant new film, WHITE MAN'S BURDEN.</P>
<P>     The movie is a tightly constructed drama about Louis Pinnock (John
Travolta), a reliable blue collar man who works in a factory owned by
high-society elitist Thaddeus Thomas (Harry Belafonte).  At home, Louis
has to deal with a rough neighborhood, gang violence, and trying to
provide for his wife (Kelly Lynch) and two kids.</P>
<P>     Just when things are looking up for the Pinnocks, Louis is suddenly
fired from his job, beaten by police after "fitting the description," and
then evicted from his home.  Desperate, he tries to get Thaddeus to hear
his case for reinstatement.  When he won't listen, Louis kidnaps him, and
the story *really* starts to take off.</P>
<P>     What follows is a compelling, thought-provoking study of racism and
the frightening economic and societal realities it can create.  Nakano's
script is masterful at challenging every preconceived notion we have, and
Oscar-deserving performances by Travolta and Belafonte really bring his
words to life.  The pair have an incredible chemistry on screen, as
Travolta finally shakes his slick, pompous stereotyping for a much meatier
part.  The comic relief is very well-done, also, and the film never
wallows into the hopeless despair that other "victim of circumstance"
stories tend to do.</P>
<P>     I was initially skeptical that WHITE MAN'S BURDEN would be any good,
but Nakano's unique vision proved me very wrong.  While he stops a little
short on pushing the film to its limit, it's still a nearly flawless
example of how modern cinema ought to be done, unadulterated by Hollywood
glitz and driving its message home with a hammer.</P>
<P>     I continue to think about one of Thaddeus's biting remarks early in
the film, where he implies that whites are genetically inferior and
"beyond being helped."  I also think about the four rowdy skinhead punks
(who somehow managed to get passes) sitting behind me, ashamed that the
message was lost on these cretins.</P>
