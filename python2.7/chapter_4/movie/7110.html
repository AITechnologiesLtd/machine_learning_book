<PRE>                              A PRIVATE MATTER
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>A Private Matter (CABLE-1992) **** out of ***** - Cast: Sissy Spacek, Aiden
Quinn, William H. Macy. Written by: William Nicholson. Directed by: Joan
Micklin Silver. Running Time: 89 minutes.</P>
<P>"A Private Matter" is based on the true story of Sherri Finkbine and the
events in her life during the 1960s. After becoming pregnant (for the fifth
time) she learns that some tranquilizers she had taken have seriously
deformed her unborn child. She and her husband decide, with the help of her
doctor, to have an abortion. But this is the 1960s, and abortion is illegal.</P>
<P>Her doctor has made arrangements to have the procedure performed withing the
law, by claiming that the child is endangering the mother's life. Everything
is about to work out just fine, until Sherri has the uncontrollable urge to
talk about her situation with a local reporter.</P>
<P>This sets off a media frenzy and immediately Sherri is the most hated woman
in the world. She and her husband are fired from their jobs, reporters are
surrounding their home at all times, and most importantly, no one in the
country (and eventually other countries) will perform the abortion. This
causes emotion problems for all involved.</P>
<P>"A Private Matter" is a fascinating story and it's hard to believe that this
only happened 30 years or so ago. It's only flaw is that not once is there
ever a satisfactory confrontation with Sherri and any of her opponents. One
woman passing her on the street telss her to burn in hell, and when Sherri
appropriately yells back, "Just tell me what I'm supposed to do," the woman
has no answer. No one apparently had an answer, they just wanted to control
what should have been only the choice of Sherri and her husband. This is an
important film, telling an important story. It's not just about not wanting
another child, it's about not wanting a child who will cause severe changes
in their family, none of which could be beneficial. Sydney Pollack served as
executive producer for this made for HBO movie.</P>
