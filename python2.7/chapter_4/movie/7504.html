                       A film review by Serdar Yegulalp
                        Copyright 1997 Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: One of the best American comedies of recent years.</P>
<P>Pity the plight of the modern personal assistant. Tess McGill (Melanie
Griffith) is a smart cookie who would probably be a good player in the
financial world, if it weren't for the fact that she's landlocked. Nobody
listens to a secretary for tips on mergers and acquisitions, even if she
does know what she's talking about. Especially with that hair, and those
bracelets, and that squeaky voice that charms her loutish boyfriend and
absolutely no one else.</P>
<P>One day, Tess gets a job as an assistant to a new boss in the mergers and
acquisitions department of the financial firm she works in. Katharine
Parker (played deliciously by Sigourney Weaver) is Serious with the cap S.
Everything about this woman bespeaks of authority, and it starts to rub off
on Tess. Not only that, but Ms. Parker likes to hear Tess's ideas. She's
got an idol. One great scene has Tess listening to Dictaphone recordings of
her idol and trying to modulate her voice.</P>
<P>Then Ms. Parker breaks her leg on a skiing trip and is laid up for some
time, giving Tess access to Katharine's home (someone has to let the
cleaning lady in, right?), personal computer, and phone logs. And there she
discovers that Katharine has stolen one of her best ideas and passed it off
as her own. (As if this wasn't bad enough, she returns home from this
humiliation to find her boyfriend being unfaithful. It never rains...)</P>
<P>Tess steams for a bit, and then decides to turn things around. Apparently
Katharine was going to get in touch with a fellow named Jack Trainer about
this idea. Tess dresses up in some of Katharine's own finery and presents
herself to Jack as an associate of Katharine's (not Katharine herself,
mercifully!)... and then things really go wild.</P>
<P>I hope from this description the movie doesn't sound like a dumb comedy of
impersonation. It is not. WORKING GIRL is a smart, intelligent and
incredibly well-written movie that takes all of its characters seriously,
including Katharine. Another movie would have made Katharine unpalatable
from start to finish; Katharine is very likeable when she's on screen --
she's just doing the wrong thing, and sees it as being business as usual.</P>
<P>The movie also features one of Harrison Ford's best performances. With a
name like "Jack Trainer", we're expecting a wolf -- instead, we get a man
who's got a sense of class and a sense of humor about himself. Tess and
Jack like each other immediately -- each sees the other as a wonderful
relief from the run of the mill they've grown accustomed to. Ford is
incredibly funny when let loose in a story like this (so unlike the dismal
SABRINA), and is one of the best things in the movie.</P>
<P>Mike Nichols' direction is smooth and unobtrusive, and lets all the best
moments in the screenplay come out unobscured -- a critical thing in a
comedy, since bad timing or a break in the mood would have ruined
everything. Even the ending, which could have been a complete gimmee, is on
just the right note, with everyone getting precisely what they deserve.
Even those of us who have never seen the inside of a corporate boardroom
will empathize -- and laugh.</P>
