<PRE>                         WAKING NED DIVINE 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1999 Timothy Voon
       3 out of 5 for stealing the lottery ticket from a dead man</PRE>
<P>Cast:  Ian Bannen, David Kelly, Fionnula Flanagan, James Nesbitt, Susan
Lynch, Brendan F. Dempsey.
Screenplay:  Kirk Jones.
Producers:  Glynis Murray and Richard Holmes.
Director:  Kirk Jones.</P>
<P>Who wants to be a millionaire? If you were Marilyn Monroe, the answer
would be to be to marry one. If you were Demi Moore, you would probably
sleep with one. If you were Nicholas Cage and Bridget Fonda, you would
lose it and then find it again through charity. If you were in an Agatha
Christie movie you would probably murder one. However, if you were Ned
Devine, you would win it and then cack it.</P>
<P>Yes, there's a dead guy in this movie, with a 7 million lottery ticket
and everyone in town is trying to steal it. Although there are moments
of tension when everyone is trying to fool the tattslotto man, or humour
when riding naked on a motorcycle, or a bit of competition when trying
to mate with the pig farmer's lay, and a bit of Irish humour which after
awhile runs dry.</P>
<P>I sat through this movie wandering what had transpired through 90
minutes of screening time. After awhile, I realised it was all about
stealing money and getting away with it. Where was the heart in this
movie, outside greed? Did they truly feel remorseful about stealing a
dead man's winnings? But none of these questions were left answered.
Which left me wandering is there more to life than just winning the
lottery?</P>
