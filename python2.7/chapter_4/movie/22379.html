THE DEER HUNTER
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>First time I watched THE DEER HUNTER, more than a decade
ago, I was slightly disappointed. It was a great film, but I
found it to be below expectations heightened by the critical
hype and word of mouth. However, in the meantime, some very
unfortunate historical circumstances in my country forced me
to appreciate this film on quite another, more personal
level. And I found it to be more powerful, actually one of
the most powerful films ever made.</P>
<P>In 1978, when it was made, THE DEER HUNTER was hailed as a
true masterpiece, one of the best films ever made and
probably the most important film of its time. Such
reputation was acknowledged with four "Oscars". However,
more than two decades later, THE DEER HUNTER is one of those
masterpieces that are forgotten, ignored or underrated by
those who make Top 100 lists. There are many reasons for
that. First, its director, Michael Cimino, entered the
history with his major flop HEAVEN'S GATE and the resulting
image of loser, megalomaniac and bad filmmaker marred even
the reputation of his true masterpiece. Second, treatment of
Vietnamese in THE DEER HUNTER is hardly acceptable for those
critics who judge films based on their political
correctness. And, finally, at the end of millennium, USA, as
the only remaining superpower and most powerful and
self-confident nation of the world, doesn't like to be
reminded of Vietnam War, the most embarrassing episode in
recent national history.</P>
<P>The plot of the film is based on the screenplay by Cimino
and Derek Washburn. It begins some time in early 1970s in
Clayrton, small industrial town in Western Pennsylvania,
populated mostly by descendants of Russian immigrants. We
follow group of young steelworkers that spend all their free
time drinking, playing pool and hunting deer in nearby
mountains. One of them, Stephen (played by John Savage) is
about to marry pregnant Angela (played by Rutanya Alda). On
the wedding, his best man Michael (played by Robert de Niro)
finds mutual attraction to best lady Linda (played by Meryl
Streep), but refuses to pursue it out of loyalty to her
boyfriend and his best friend Nicholas (played by
Christopher Walken). Next day friends go to the hunting
trip, the last before Michael, Stephen and Nicholas get
enlisted to fight in Vietnam War. Their friendship would be
ultimately tested in Vietnam, where they witness
unimaginable horrors and atrocities and finally get captured
themselves. Led by Michael, they escape from Viet Cong
prison, but when they reach safety, they are only shadows of
their former selves. Stephen has lost his legs, Nicholas has
lost his mental health and disappeared in the streets of
Saigon and Michael, upon returning to his hometown, finds
that he too has problems connecting to people.</P>
<P>One of the most interesting things about THE DEER HUNTER is
the very neat and disciplined structure of the film. Number
three, that is very important in Christian, especially
Orthodox Christian, tradition, plays important role in this
film. THE DEER HUNTER has three major protagonists, lasts
for three hours and is composed of three different acts.
Cimino as director likes to stage elaborate scenes with
long, expository shots (hard to imagine in MTV-style school
of directing today), with meticulous care about details.
First act depicts everyday life of our heroes as simple,
normal human beings and portrays them as people we might
find next door. We see them working, having fun and trying
to solve their petty every day problems. First act,
especially the scenes that deal with the wedding, were often
criticised for being overlong and unnecessary. Nothing could
be farther from truth - Cimino had to make first act that
long in order to make viewers as familiar with characters as
possible. When we switch to second and third act, and we see
how those characters and people around them are permanently
changed, the emotional impact is much stronger.</P>
<P>Uneventful, simple and boring existence in the gloomy
industrial heartland of America suddenly becomes idyllic
when Cimino shocks us by throwing our heroes right in the
middle of Vietnam inferno. Scenes of violence and
unimaginable atrocities were shocking and disgusting for the
audience of its time, but for today's audience they might
seem tame, thanks to many imitators and film makers who
pushed the envelope even further. These scenes, although
still not suitable for the squeamish viewers, are also
necessary, because we must understand what really happened
to our heroes. And than comes the third act, when our heroes
must return home, wrecked beyond any repair. Michael, who
was best prepared for the ordeal due to his hunting skills,
personal philosophy of "one shot - one kill" and charisma of
natural leader, looks unaffected on the surface and actually
tries to bring back some normalcy to the lives of his
comrades and community. But even he is personally affected,
and things are just not going to be the same - even the most
innocent hunting in the woods brings too many painful
memories. And even his old neighbourhood isn't the same
anymore, being indirectly affected with traumatic war.</P>
<P>>From the day of premiere Cimino had some problems with
critics, especially those from the left wing of political
spectrum. THE DEER HUNTER, unlike most other films that
dealt with Vietnam in those times, portrays Vietnam War from
rather unusual perspective. Film ignores generational
conflicts and social turmoil of 1960s, as well as internal
American politics and endless debates caused by the war. By
giving his young protagonists blue-collar immigrant
background, Cimino portrays them as people who don't care
about rights and wrongs of the Vietnam adventure; they go to
war because they feel obliged to the country that gave new
opportunities to their impoverished ancestors. Instead of
generational conflicts, those people have problems with
their identity - they are very Russian and very American in
the same time. This background enabled Cimino to surprise
the audience with somewhat unusual twists on all Vietnam
cliches of 1970s. First we see community that actively
supports the war (even in closing years, when the majority
of the country saw the utter pointlessness of the endeavour)
and greets veterans as true heroes (quite differently from
college students that used to heckle incoming veterans as
"baby killers"). Then, we not only see something very rare
in Hollywood cinema - spectacular Orthodox Christian
ceremonies - but also we see Russians, in 1970s perceived to
be the greatest enemies of American way of life, as more
American than average Americans themselves.</P>
<P>Uniqueness of Cimino's perspective becomes problematic when
film focuses on Vietnam itself. Cimino takes very one-sided
approach, which later brought him accusations of racism
(Cimino would later try to silence those critics with almost
Marxist view of late 19th Century USA in HEAVEN'S GATE and
more balanced approach towards Chinese Americans in THE YEAR
OF DRAGON) . The only atrocities portrayed in this film are
those committed by NVA and Viet Cong, but even the friendly
South Vietnamese are actually shown to be unworthy of noble
American protection, since they misuse it only to deprive
young Americans of money in most rotten ways possible.
Saigon is shown as decadent moral cesspool that rightly
deserved to be cleansed by victorious Communists at the end
of the film. Cimino enhanced that reputation by being
deliberately inaccurate in some details. Russian Roulette
scenes are the most notorious example. Scene in Viet Cong
prison is one of the most powerful in the history of cinema,
but it lacks credibility in the context of realities of Viet
Cong's guerrilla warfare. Same is with the whole underground
Russian Roulette playhouses in Saigon, subplot that gives
this film the only major plot and characterisation flaw.</P>
<P>However, even that flaw is dwarfed by the enormous talent
invested in this film. The acting is probably best known -
THE DEER HUNTER had one of the strongest and most memorable
casts in history of cinema. Robert de Niro as the nominal
lead is at his best, portraying the Michael as simple hero,
unofficial leader of the group, quiet, reliable man, yet
affected with the atrocities and able to show strong
emotions in traumatic experiences. He is partnered with
really great actors that give touching portrayals of his
best, yet physically or mentally inferior friends. John
Savage is great as Stephen, one of the most tragic
characters in modern cinema, as well as "Oscar"- awarded
Christopher Walken who gives excellent Nicholas and his slow
slide into madness. Other acting talents were great. John
Cazale's role of false macho friend Stan is especially
moving when we take into account that the actor was actually
dying from terminal cancer in front of cameras. Meryl
Streep, one of my favourite actresses, is also grand in one
of her earlier roles; her "girl next door" charm is nicely
contrasted with the inner traumas, indirectly caused by war
and conflicting feelings towards boyfriend and his best pal.
One of the underrated performances also came from George
Dzundza as bartender John, the one who has the warmest
personality on the outside, yet suffers from guilty
conscience on the inside.</P>
<P>Great acting was also enhanced with great atmosphere. Always
reliable director of photography Vilmos Zsigmond used mostly
grey tones, but they are effective in all scenes - whether
they feature industrial settings of Pennsylvania, natural
paradise of Allegheny Mountains, devastated Vietnam
countryside or infernal underworld of Saigon. Simple musical
score by Stanley Myers is also great, providing romantic,
sentimental tone so much in contrast with harsh,
naturalistic events of the film. Every time I think of
romance, I always remember that theme.</P>
<P>Finally, the ultimate reason why people should watch THE
DEER HUNTER lies in its universal importance. I witnessed
war and saw how it could change people and communities,
sometimes irreparably. Names, locations, causes and
belligerents might be different, but the aftermath is always
the same - no matter how prepared they might be, people are
always deeply affected with violence and destruction. I saw
too many Michaels, Stephens and Nicholases first hand and
witnessed how psychological wounds, both on them personally
and on the society as a whole, could have devastating
effects. THE DEER HUNTER, in its sincerity, dwarves almost
any other film that deals with the ugly reality of war;
compared with it SAVING PRIVATE RYAN looks like simple
militaristic propaganda. Today's world, in which many wars
are fought for the sake of daytime politics and winning
elections, needs more films like THE DEER HUNTER.</P>
