                             LORD OF THE FLIES
                                [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Eric Schrager
                        Copyright 1990 Eric Schrager</PRE>
<P>     I've read the book, I've seen the film.  If you've missed out on either
and don't want to hear about them yet, then don't charge into this.</P>
<P>     I've found many of the comments on the new remake of Golding's LORD OF THE
FLIES quite relevant.  Personally, I was thrilled to discover that someone had
remade the film.  Rather film oriented myself, I often read books while trying
to imagine a cinemagraphic approach to them, and (already having seen the
original black-and-white film version) I felt all through reading the novel
that it should by all means be remade.  I liked the original for the most part,
but the novel immediately suggests itself to color.  It's a lush, colorful
island, and modern film could bring many of the aspects of the book to greater
life than the original did.  The original also failed to show sufficiently the
character of Simon, and his visions, and I don't think anyone who saw the first
film could figure out what it was the boys mistook for a "beast."  I, for one,
went to the film with eager anticipation, hoping the book would be rendered
more skillfully and in some ways more faithfully than the first film had.</P>
<P>     My first disappointment was when I was told this would be about modern
American boys rather than British boys of the period, but I reserved judgment.
I watched the film, and saw that much of what I thought was right.  A modern
film *did* bring the island into greater vividness.  Color WAS needed.  And I
must admit that both Simon and the Beast were better explained than in the
first film.</P>
<PRE>     But.</PRE>
<P>     I must agree with those who hated the Americanization of the film.  I
thought about it as I left the theatre.  What was it about the American academy
cadets that was so inferior to the British upper-class schoolboys?  One thing
struck me immediately: the *language*.  The vocabulary of the American boys is
essentially different, and that hurts the newer film.  For one thing, the
profanity.  I thought the profanity and everything about the American boys'
dialogue was plausible.  As American boys.  But as the characters of LORD OF
THE FLIES, it didn't ring true.  For one thing, modern American children are
too articulate.  The essence of LORD OF THE FLIES, what made the boys'
degeneration possible in the novel, was the inability the boys had to
communicate their fears.  "Things are breaking up," Ralph said, but he couldn't
explain quite *why*.  Piggy, as an American child, was simply whiny rather than
dry and overly intellectual.  But there's something about the American boys
that casts a pall over the degeneration that happens to them.</P>
<P>     For one thing, it isn't complete.  In the novel, the boys actually become
savages, and Golding calls the member's of Jack's tribe nothing else from the
moment Simon is killed until the boys are rescued.  The point-of-view of modern
American children is too sophisticated, too jaded.  There is too little purity
to corrupt.  The mores of civilization don't rule and haunt modern American
boys the way they did British boys of 1960.</P>
<P>     And again, the language.  The writers had to change the basic terms, to
accommodate an American audience.  It was a "monster" in the remake rather than
a "beast," offered "presents" instead of "gifts."  The terms "chief" and
"tribe" were only used half-jokingly near the end, rather than with increasing
seriousness throughout.  It makes sense, Americans don't say things like "gift
for the beast" or "chief of the tribe," certainly not kids.  But those terms
help make the story work, turn Jack's tribe into something actually savage and
nightmarish.  The *chant* was lost in this film.  "Kill the beast!  Cut his
throat!  Spill his blood!"  The build was lost.  In this film, we watch the
kids simply become more-than-normally cruel little bastards.  In the novel,
they become personifications of evil.</P>
<P>     I could go on and on, but I guess I wanted the filmmakers to be *true* to
the book because the book *worked*.  They compromised it.  Making the adult
Captain escape (presumed dead) and become the Beast was, I suppose, about as
plausible as a dead parachutist caught puppetlike in the parachute lines, but
it misses the point.  There *are* no adults on the island of the novel, so far
as the boys know.  And the "Beast" *should* be a puppet, the irony is
brilliant.  The paint!  The boys aren't just putting on cute Indian paint,
they're hiding their consciences behind anonymous masks.  (And why were Sam and
Eric, the twins, such total assholes?  They represented the last bastions of
civilized innocence in the novel.)  Everything was there, it was just
approximated, simplified, condensed, cheapened.  The people who put this
together sadly underestimated the American audience's appreciation of Art for
Art's sake, rather than money's sake.  The book, even thirty years old, even
British, reads beautifully for any reader with the guts to accept the ugliness
it recounts.</P>
<P>     In fairness, I repeat that modern film methods did some beautiful things,
but there's nothing it did well that it couldn't have done better playing truer
to the novel.  Ralph could have been flawed, could have begun to forget what
the purpose of the fire was except for Piggy's prodding.  The conch could have
played the essential civilizing part that it did in the novel, could have been
shattered to pieces by the boulder that killed Piggy.  The pig's head on a
stick could have *spoken* to Simon, confessed that evil is a part of mankind
and cannot be exorcised (Damn, we have modern animation methods and the
*second* movie blows this chance too!).  This film could have *been* LORD OF
THE FLIES.  Instead, it was a rather skillful if overly commercial
approximation of it.</P>
<P>     By all means, see it if you like.  But I can't help but hope that you're
not satisfied with it.  If you are, you've missed much of what makes the novel
great.</P>
