A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Brett Ratner
Written by: Ross LaManna (story) and Jim Kouf (screenplay) .</P>
<P>Ingredients: Reckless cop teamed with Hong Kong detective, comedy,
pratfalls, kidnapped kid</P>
<P>Starring: Chris Tucker, Jackie Chan, Julia Hsu, </P>
<P>Synopsis: 
RUSH HOUR is a standard cop buddy plot uplifted by the presence of its
two stars: martial arts funny man Jackie Chan and comedian Chris Tucker.
Tucker plays main character James Carter, an outlandish and narcissistic
Los Angeles cop who is irritating to his superiors. As a result of their
displeasure, Carter is assigned to baby-sit a visiting Hong Kong
detective named Lee (Jackie Chan) whom the authorities want to keep out
of the way as they investigate the kidnapping of Soo Yung (Julia Hsu in
her acting debut), the young child of Lee's friend Chinese Consul Han
(Tzi Ma). But Carter and his new acquaintance Detective Lee don't stay
out of the investigation. They bicker over ethnic misunderstandings and
botch things up, but finally work as a team to solve the case. </P>
<P>Opinion:
I were a teacher giving grades, Tucker would get a B. He's good and
funny, but his loquacious screeching is sometimes a bit much.</P>
<P>On the other hand, RUSH HOUR is proof positive that America is finally
catching on to the world's appreciation international megastar Jackie
Chan. Longtime Chan fans should be forewarned RUSH HOUR isn't a Jackie
Chan or Hong Kong picture; it's a Hollywood buddy formula where Chan is
merely the co-star. But despite not being the main character, Chan still
gets plenty of chances to amuse us by hanging from dangerous ledges,
climbing, leaping, kicking, or consoling a little girl. Chan gets an A,
and if there's a sequel, I hope he gets more air time.</P>
<P>RUSH HOUR is lively, entertaining, and will appeal to people of all ages
and ethnicities. The bad guys aren't impressive, and the plot is
routine, but Tucker and Chan provide sufficient charisma, comic lines,
timing, and acrobatics to give the formula enough enjoyable moments. I
took my parents to see it, and they loved it. </P>
