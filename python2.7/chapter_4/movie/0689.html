                               FAMILY BUSINESS
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1989 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Very substandard Lumet.  A powerful
     performance by Dustin Hoffman is not enough to save this
     mismatch of story elements, but does raise it to a rating of
     0.</PRE>
<P>     Sidney Lumet is one of the best of American directors.  His record
includes films such as TWELVE ANGRY MEN, FAIL-SAFE, DOG DAY AFTERNOON, and
NETWORK.  It would be hard to match for intensity films such as EQUUS or
what may be his most powerful film, THE PAWNBROKER.  But somehow something
went very wrong with FAMILY BUSINESS, a crazy-quilt patchwork that falls
apart at the seams.</P>
<P>     The first and most unlikely matching is of Sean Connery, Dustin
Hoffman, and Matthew Broderick as three generations of the same family.  At
least one review tells me the novel that the film was based on has everyone
being Irish-American.  If that is true, and even if not, it represents an
appalling sacrifice of credibility for box-office appeal.  The whole story
lies under the cloud of this initial foolishness.  Grandfather Jessie is
Irish, his son Vito is Sicilian, and his grandson Adam is Jewish.  It was
left ambiguous but Jessie's mother may have been Cherokee.  Jessie is a
career criminal who led his son Vito into crime.  Vito, however, eventually
broke with his father, married a Jewish woman, ran a meat provision company
that he not so secretly hated, and raised a Westinghouse scholar, Adam.
Adam, however, is rebelling from his father and wants to follow his
grandfather into crime, starting with the unusual robbery of a biological
research facility.</P>
<P>     While the film is marketed as having substantial comedy, nobody seems
to have told director Lumet.  FAMILT BUSINESS is a crime drama without very
much comedy.  Even then the actors are mismatched since neither Broderick
nor Connery is equipped or prepared to match the intensity of a Dustin
Hoffman performance.</P>
<P>     Somewhere Lumet seems to have lost control of the theme of the film.
The film becomes a defense of crime.  It is full of likable criminals who
hawk stolen goods at Irish wakes.  The nasty people in this film are people
who deal in real estate and lawyers, and big corporations, each of whom is
made to look worse than the others.  Lumet seems to be saying that Adam
should go into likable crime because legal professions are all immoral.</P>
<P>     In spite of Hoffman's performance--the only aspect that prevents this
film from getting a much lower rating--I would give this film a 0 on the -4
to +4 scale.  FAMILY BUSINESS is bad business.</P>
