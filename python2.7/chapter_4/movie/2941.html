<PRE>     "All love is pursuit of the whole."
          - Plato</PRE>
<P>     One of the most important elements of any romantic comedy is that
mysterious, unquantifiable quality referred to as "chemistry."  Some
couples have it; others don't--that's a simple fact of films.  How
well the leads work together often determines whether a movie is
successful or not.  In the case of ONLY YOU, Norman Jewison's latest
production, actors Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey, Jr. don't fully
connect.  There are times when the embers start to smolder, but a fire
never ignites.</P>
<P>     This is another love story about fate (remember SLEEPLESS IN
SEATTLE?), with Tomei's Faith (an appropriate name) having a Ouija
board experience at age eleven which convinces her that her destiny is
someone named Damon Bradley.  Days later, a carnival fortune teller
reinforces this belief.  So, when as an adult of twenty-five only ten
days away from an unpromising marriage, Faith answers a phone call from
someone named Damon Bradley, her life is turned upside down.</P>
<P>     Accompanied by best friend and sister-in-law Kate (Bonnie Hunt),
Faith climbs aboard an airplane and follows Damon to Venice, and then
on to Rome, where she tracks him from hotels to restaurants, always
getting close, but never close enough.  Then, when she's about ready to
give up hope, coincidence crosses her path with that of a charming
stranger (Robert Downey Jr.) who casually informs Faith that he, in
fact, is the man she's looking for.</P>
<P>     As is the case with almost every motion picture in the genre,
originality is not ONLY YOU's strong suit.  Everyone going to the movie
knows what's going to happen in the end--the only question is whether
the path leading there will be more enjoyable than insipid.  In this
case, it is, but there's a lot missing as well.  ONLY YOU is
entertaining without being exceptionally accomplished.</P>
<P>     The storyline has the advantage of including several minor twists
designed to play upon the audience's expectations, and the rewrites of
Diane Drake's script offer an alternative explanation for those who
resolutely refuse to acknowledge the existence of destiny.  Amidst all
the requisite formulaic situations, there are moments of surprising
cleverness.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, Tomei and Downey appear less made for each other
than their characters supposedly are.  The two never come across as a
great--or even less-than-great--screen couple.  WHEN HARRY MET SALLY,
THE CUTTING EDGE, and even this summer's IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU (to
name a few) all worked to some degree because it's easy to accept that
the lead characters fall in love.  In ONLY YOU, that
impossible-to-define connection is weak.</P>
<P>     One of the problems may be that Downey isn't in the first
forty-five minutes of the film and when he finally appears, things seem
to be rushed.  Or it could be that Marisa Tomei's Faith is so focused
on destiny that she never has an opportunity to develop a personality.
Especially compared to her friend Kate, she is flat.  Tomei's energetic
performance merely makes her hyperactively flat.</P>
<P>     With her short hair, the lead actress bears a striking resemblance
to a young Audrey Hepburn.  The effect is obviously intentional, as
shown by the inclusion of a scene at the "Mouth of Truth" that echoes
ROMAN HOLIDAY (Downey does a great vocal imitation of Gregory Peck).</P>
<P>     Some will doubtlessly compare ONLY YOU to Jewison's most popular
romantic comedy, MOONSTRUCK.  Similarities, however, are mostly
superficial.  MOONSTRUCK forged living, breathing characters from a
keen script.  ONLY YOU doesn't do nearly as much, nor is its source
material as impressive.  Despite some underlying ideas about forging
one's own destiny, this is a essentially a light, inoffensive movie
that will appeal to those who aren't seeking more than a bubbly
romance.</P>
