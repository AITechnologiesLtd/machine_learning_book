<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>The following is a conversation between PLANET SICK-BOY and former
Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir -</P>
<P>PSB -  `Sholem aleichem'
GM -  `Aleichem sholem'
PSB -  `Thank you for coming.  I understand that you have just seen the
new film, A Price Above Rubies.
GM -  `I could plotz from the excitement.  The last picture I saw was Up
in Smoke and I needed that like a hole in the head'
PSB -  `So, did you enjoy it?'
GM -  `Did I enjoy it.  Better you should ask another question'
PSB -  `Really?  You didn't like it at all?'
GM -  (under her breath) `A real able momzer, this one is'
PSB -  `I'm sorry, what was that?'
GM -  `Bubeleh, it was just wonderful.  I should live so long to see a
better picture.  Wait, I'm dead already'
PSB -  `Well, what didn't you like about it?'
GM -  `Again with the questions already'
PSB -  `Ok, let's just run through the basic story for the readers.
Sonia (Renee Zellweger, Jerry Maguire) and Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald,
Flirting with Disaster), a young married couple with a new baby, move
from Monsey to Boro Park.  Much to the dismay of her friends and family,
Sonia begins to stray from her simple life as a devoted housewife and
sets out to experience the world on her own terms.  Occasionally, she
encounters and consoles in a bag lady, who Sonia thinks is the ghost of
her deceased Grandmother'
GM -  (under her breath) `This plosher can really knock a teapot.'
PSB -  `Please speak into the microphone so we don't miss anything'
GM -  `Speak into what?  Now he tells me'
PSB -  `So, were there certain parts of the story that you had a problem
with?'
GM -  `That's no charley.  Let's start with this director, a meshungener
putz.  A plague should seize him, may God prevent that'
PSB -  `But he also made the gritty urban drama Fresh with Tupac Shakur'</P>
<P>GM -  `And if his bubbe had wheels, she would be a buggy.  He is
definitely not an M.O.T.'
PSB -  `What's an M.O.T.?'
GM -  `Member of Our Tribe.  This nudnick don't know his toches from his
elbow'
PSB -  `What about the characters?'
GM -  `Let's start with the shikse Sonia.  She's too good for her
husband all of a sudden and decides to shtup her way into a job'
PSB -  `You mean when Sender (Christopher Eccleston, Jude) offers her a
job selling jewelry for him and he welcomes her aboard with a quick,
unceremonious hump?
GM -  `Mnyeh, enough with that.  What about her poor husband?'
PSB -  `Well, I guess that Sonia was turned off by Mendel's pre-futz
praying and the unemotional way he made love to her.  I guess you could
say that he was unlucky in love'
GM -  ` Just like the old saying about mazel'
PSB -  `What's that?'
GM -  `When a man has mazel, even his rooster lays eggs'
PSB -  `I'm not sure how that fits into our discussion, but…'
GM -  (interrupting) `Feh!  I'm telling you that Mendel has no eggs,
excuse the expression'
PSB -  `Errr, so it turns out that Sonia is quite an expert in buying
and selling jewelry and this skill allows her to meet Ramon (Allen
Payne, New Jack City), a young artist who creates his own adornments'
GM -  `And right into his bed she hops, this yente luftmensch'
PSB -  `You don't seem to identify with the Sonia character very much at
all'
GM -  `I was the Prime Minister of Israel, not a filthy
good-for-bobkes.  And just because she is a maven with the jewelry
doesn't mean she gets to make like a whore with the first shvartzeh she
finds.  Like a beet she should grow with her head in the ground'
PSB -  `And that is the basic moral of A Price Above Rubies.  Thank you,
Golda'</P>
