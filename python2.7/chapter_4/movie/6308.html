<PRE>                               RANSOM (1996)
                       A film review by Steve Kong
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>A few months back I saw the preview for this film.  It looked exciting, 
thrilling, and cool.  And I really like Mel Gibson, Rene Russo, and Delroy 
Lindo.  Then I saw that I was directed by Ron Howard, what other great thing 
could this film have?  And this is when the waiting started.</P>
<P>Today, after my physics lab I stood in line for fifteen minutes to buy tickets 
to the very first showing of Ransom at Century 22 (San Jose, CA).  Then sat in 
a dimly lit theatre waiting for the projectionist to finish up loading the 
film.  Watched three previews (one being Star Trek:First Contact) and then the 
lights dimmed.  Was the film worth the wait?  A definite YES!</P>
<P>What a great film.  Ron Howard (also known as Opie) does a very good job 
directing this film, making everything work well together.  The well paid Mel 
Gibson ($20 million) does a great job at being a guy that has fast mood 
swings and almost seem to care only about himself.  Rene Russo looks great, as 
always, and does great as Mel Gibson's wife.  The characterizations in the 
film were somewhat thin, but the quick pacing of the film moves the audience 
along so fast that it really doesn't matter.</P>
<P>The plot of the film is about Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson), an airline tycoon, who 
did one nasty deed in his past.  The kidnappers, I won't reveal the 
identities, take Mullen's kid and ask for a $2 million dollar ransom.  We 
find later, how that nasty deed really fits into the situation.  </P>
<P>The film also stars Gary Sinese (Forrest Gump, Apollo 13)  as a NYPD detective 
and  Delroy Lindo (Broken Arrow, Get Shorty) as an FBI agent.  I really loved 
Delroy Lindo's performance in this film.</P>
<P>Though we all know how the film is going to turn out, there are enough twists, 
turns, and surprises throughout the film to keep the audience hooked all the 
way up to the end.  This is a great film.  Put it on your "Must-see" list!</P>
