THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Joe and Sally Therrian, played with comedic and dramatic verve by Alan 
Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh, are throwing a party.  And not just 
any party, but an anniversary party to celebrate their sixth wedding 
anniversary.  Given that they had broken up just 5 months ago, their 
friends at the party are pleased to see that they have patched things 
up.  </P>
<P>Cumming and Leigh, who jointly wrote and directed THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY, 
invited their real-life friends to star with them in it, which gives the 
film a killer ensemble cast.  How often do you get to see the likes of 
Cumming, Leigh, Jane Adams, Jennifer Beals, Phoebe Cates, Kevin Kline, 
Gwyneth Paltrow, Parker Posey and John C. Reilly in the same movie?  
With this impressive talent, they make an indie-budget film that has 
more edge, skill and pizzazz than you normally find in such productions.  </P>
<P>To add even more icing to this cinematic cake, respected cinematographer 
John Bailey (ORDINARY PEOPLE and AS GOOD AS IT GETS) demonstrates that 
digital video can indeed look sharp, sumptuous and generally steady.  
Normally, indie directors are willing to accept DV movies that appear so 
ugly that they remind you of your neighbor's bad home videos.</P>
<P>Joe and Sally are both in "the business," as are almost all of the 
guests.  Joe's an author turned director who is currently directing for 
scale, whereas his lead actress, Skye Davidson (Gwyneth Paltrow), is 
being paid four million.  Joe, who is described by one character as a 
"sexually ambivalent manchild," clearly has more than a directorial 
interest in Skye, which Sally resents.  When Skye, a blonde bimbo who 
lies about her age, first enters the room, she bats her big eyes at Joe, 
and a tiny breeze fans her golden hair.</P>
<P>Skye, who is a big fan of Sally's pictures, tells her, "I've been 
watching your movies since I was 4," which, of course, only reminds 
Sally that she's no longer an ingénue.  Skye goes on to remark that when 
she was in drug rehab -- the second time -- she wasn't allowed to watch 
Sally's drug movie because the acting was too realistic.</P>
<P>Among many good performances, Jane Adams (HAPPINESS), as actress Clair 
Forsyth, the wife of Sally's current director Mac Forsyth (John C. 
Reilly), turns in one of the best pieces of work, as she allows herself 
to look awful in the service of her craft.  Clair is a painfully thin 
new mom who is stoked up on diet pills in order to lose the fat that she 
doesn't have.  Always so jittery that she seems in danger of leaping off 
the screen, Clair has a long, revealing nude scene that will make you 
want to bring her a robe to cover up.</P>
<P>The comedy turns more serious as the story advances, and the funniest 
lines usually have aspects of both humor and drama.  Sophia Gold (Phoebe 
Cates) reveals the dirty little secret that every parent knows but 
doesn't want to admit.  Once you have children, you can't commit suicide 
since "kids rob you of that option."  It's a bitingly true commentary on 
parenthood.  The script is filled with such little gems of wisdom.</P>
<P>THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY runs 1:55.  It is rated R for language, drug use 
and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, June 22, 2001.  
In the Silicon Valley it will be playing at the Camera Cinemas.  The 
movie was shown recently at the Camera Cinema Club 
(<A HREF="http://www.cameracinemas.com/club">http://www.cameracinemas.com/club</A>) of Los Gatos and San Jose.</P>
