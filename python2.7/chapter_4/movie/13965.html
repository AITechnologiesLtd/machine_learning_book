<PRE>The Mask of Zorro
by Curtis Edmonds -- <A HREF="mailto:blueduck@hsbr.org">blueduck@hsbr.org</A></PRE>
<P>The title begs the question:  Why the mask of Zorro?  "Zorro" would have
been a perfectly good title, save that this movie has actually two
Zorros -- Anthony Hopkins as the legendary bandit and Antonio Banderas
as his young protege.  "The Sword of Zorro" would have been all right as
a title -- there is enough swordplay to delight the heart of the most
avid Errol Flynn fan.  "The Horse of Zorro" would have been a cool
title, too -- Zorro's black stallion Tornado is a source of occasional
slapstick.  For those more interested in the physique of Banderas, you
could have "The Pants of Zorro" -- or, contrariwise, "The Plunging
Neckline of Catherine Zeta-Jones" -- both of which get ample screen
time.</P>
<P>But, no, it's the mask that's most important.  The mask allows Zorro to
do the dashing and dangerous things that he does, while still allowing
him access to the society of Old California.  But like everything else,
in life, the mask isn't so simple.  All the main characters in The Mask
of Zorro wear masks of one sort or another -- save the lovely Ms.
Zeta-Jones, for whom a mask would only hide her sensuous beauty.  It's
the masks that give The Mask of Zorro a little bit of psychologial
resonance and lift it above its origins as a costume swashbuckler.</P>
<P>Hopkins appears first as Zorro, mask and all.  To its credit, The Mask
of Zorro figures that we already know who Zorro is -- there's no
explication of his origin, how he came to wear the mask, or any of that
stuff.  There's just a great action sequence (it would be the climax of
a lesser movie) which sets up the legend and the relationship between
Zorro and chief baddie Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson).  However, no
mask is perfect.  Hopkins is unmasked, his wife is killed, and his
daughter kidnapped by Montero.</P>
<P>The action restarts 20 years later, as Montero returns to California
with Zorro's daughter (the aforementioned luscious Zeta-Jones) at his
side.  Wilson has to wear a mask, too -- he has adopted Zeta-Jones as
his daughter, and must hide his dark, scheming heart behind a veneer of
courtliness and gentility.  Wilson is much better than this than, say,
Alan Rickman in Kevin Costner's Robin Hood movie.  It's a quality
performance in a quality movie.</P>
<P>The titular mask, though, belongs to Banderas, and he wears it nobly.
We first see Banderas as an unlettered Mexican bandito, picked by
Hopkins to be his instrument of revenge.  We see a training sequence
where Banderas learns to fence and tumble, and there's a gloriously
goofy comic sequence where he tries to steal a horse and fails
miserably.  But the bandit's mask isn't all Banderas has to wear.  He
has to impersonate a Spanish don so that he may get intelligence from
Don Rafael -- and not incidentally, dance a passionate tango with the
beauteous Zeta-Jones.  (We are spared a lot of the Eliza Doolittle
business that must have gone on between the elder and younger Zorros --
who wanted to see Hopkins dancing with Banderas, anyway?)</P>
<P>While all this is going on, Hopkins has to wear yet another mask -- as
the humble servant to Banderas's ersatz don, which leads to a couple of
very touching scenes.  All of the masks everyone wears gives the movie a
strong psychological dimension that would be lacking if this was a
straight action movie.  Not that the action isn't great -- it's just
fine, with some great swashbucling scenes -- but the real action is of
the mind and the heart.  The Mask of Zorro succeeds because it's driven
by good performances and a good story.  It's clearly a sword slash above
this summer's mindless action films.</P>
