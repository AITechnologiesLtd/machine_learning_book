<P>     Three years ago, I might have given a perfect rating to PARADISE
LOST: THE CHILD MURDERS AT ROBIN HOOD HILLS; two years from now, I might
be similarly inclined to honor it.  Such are the vagaries of critical
opinion, that temporal beast, that I found my experience of Joe Berlinger
and Bruce Sinofsky's documentary both enhanced and diminished by recent
pervasive coverage of high-profile murder cases.  As a carefully
constructed detective story, PARADISE LOST is riveting; as a study of
small town America at its best and its worst, it is compelling.  However,
as an examination of publicly-aired grief and suspicion of the criminal
justice system, it is merely exemplary rather than extraordinary.</P>
<P>     PARADISE LOST begins with chilling footage of a May 5, 1993 crime
scene outside of West Memphis, Arkansas:  8-year-old classmates Michael
Moore, Steven Branch and Christopher Byers have been hot-tied, beaten and
stabbed to death, and Byers castrated.  The murders naturally outrage the
insular and deeply religious community, and families of the victims are
only too ready to believe the worst when three likely enough suspects are
arrested.  17-year-old Jessie Misskelley confesses under police
questioning to participating in a Satanic ritual in which the three boys
were killed, and implicates 16-year-old Jason Baldwin and 18-year-old
Damien Echols as well.  Damien, an occult-fascinated, heavy
metal-listening eccentric, is particularly tailor-made for prosecution,
but there are potential problems with the case.  Jessie has an IQ of only
72, and his confession is riddled with inconsistencies.  There also
happens to be virtually no physical evidence, and plenty to suggest that
the crimes may have occurred somewhere beside the muddy ditch where the
bodies were found.</P>
<P>     The first half hour of PARADISE LOST introduces us to a fascinating
cast of characters, and to a setting which is as critical to the case as
any piece of evidence.  John Mark Byers, stepfather of victim Christopher
Byers, is shown in a tirade against the killers laced both with hatred and
with Scripture, and he becomes a personification of a town as obsessed
with its perceptions of the devil as it is steadfast in its Christianity.
There are moments of powerful emotional honesty which capture the deep
conflict between the need for catharsis and the call for forgiveness --
one victim's grandfather holds back tears as he refuses to hate the
accused teens, while Byers' mother lashes out against them and "the
mothers that bore them."  Hovering over the proceedings like a dark angel
is the film's most enigmatic figure, Damien Echols -- a perceptive,
self-absorbed and vaguely frightening young man who is like a Satanist
from central casting.  Misskelley and Baldwin, both tiny and timid, seem
physically incapable of the crimes; when Echols takes the stand, toying
with his hair and answering questions as though the world were wasting his
time, you can see him digging shovelsful of his own grave.</P>
<P>    The courtroom scenes are rife with the kind of confrontations familiar
from both fictional and real-life proceedings, but the knowledge of its
reality makes every unexpected revelation all the more enthralling.  For
much of the film, Sinofsky and Berlinger let the trials of Misskelley
(tried separately) and Baldwin and Echols unfold slowly, and it seems
their focus is the railroading of the three accused boys as a result of
their outsider status.  Then new bits of evidence keep exploding like land
mines.  Another possible suspect emerges after turning over a weapon to
the film-makers; Damien's testimony appears to trip him up; another
character is revealed to have a brain tumor.  It is a case of such
complexity that any amateur juror who has railed against noteworthy
verdicts should be forced to watch PARADISE LOST as a civics lesson.</P>
<P>     The courtroom drama of PARADISE LOST is certainly intriguing, but I
think the film spends a bit too much time in the courtroom, because the
actual evidence is only half the story.  When Sinofsky and Berlinger spend
time with the families, they force us to confront the scars the families
on both sides will bear, and to confront our own preconceptions in the
process.  At the same time, it was difficult to listen to the righteous
wrath of the victims' parents and not recall the media trials waged by the
fathers of Ronald Goldman (in the O.J. Simpson trial) and Polly Klaas (a
much-publicized California rape-murder case).  Outrage against the concept
of presumed innocence just isn't news in this age, and PARADISE LOST
simply underlines this trend rather than exposing it.  That is not to
diminish its power -- PARADISE LOST will have you asking yourself
questions long after it ends.  Perhaps by the time I reach my own personal
verdict, its power will have overwhelmed its familiarity entirely.</P>
