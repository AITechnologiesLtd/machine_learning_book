<PRE>The Island Of Dr. Moreau
A Review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Marlon Brando; Val Kilmer; David Thewlis & Fairuza Balk
The Island Of Dr. Moreau has gotten a lot of bad press, most of it
undeserved. It centers on a man named Douglas (David Thewlis), a survivor of
a ship lost at sea, he is rescued by a fishing boat. This particular boat is
carrying another passenger, a guy by the name of Montgomery (Val Kilmer),
who offers to help Douglas. The fishing vessel is heading to the remote
island where Montgomery works as a scientist, and he offers to let Douglas
stay there until help arrives for him. It turns out the island is a research
station run by the once famous Dr. Moreau (Marlon Brando), who had dropped
out of site years ago. It seems that Moreau has been doing genetic
experiments, namely blending human DNA with that of animals, in order to
create a more perfect being. Well, he hasn't been real successful up to this
point, and the results of his work roam the island. These half human half
whatever (depending on the individual) are wild and kept in line only by
their fear of Moreau's henchmen. To make a long story short, Moreau loses
control over these creatures, and the results are not pleasant.</P>
<P>Marlon Brando, after you get over the shock of is enormous size, shows just
why he is one of the world's greatest actors. His part is not huge, but when
he is on camera he can hold your attention. (I was left thinking what a
shame it is that this talent has been left largely wasted these last few
years, partly due to his living as a recluse, and of course partly due to
the fact that he appears to never leave the buffet table.) Val Kilmer's
character, Montgomery, had absolutely no redeeming qualities. You pretty
much root for this guy to get knocked off from the word go. David Thewlis
puts on a fairly good performance as the man who is basically in the wrong
place at the wrong time. Fairuza Balk, one of the most underrated actresses
in Hollywood, does a great job as Moreaus tormented daughter. Although some
of the movies best performances come from the many actors who are buried
under piles of makeup as the creatures. A real credit to both actors and
writers as they don't get a great deal of meaningful screen time. The
creature makeup and effects are amazing -- this was not a low budget
production.</P>
<P>As genetic experimentation becomes more and more prevalent in the scientific
community, the creatures that populate this island don't seem all that far
fetched. Which makes the fact that the novel on which this movie was based
was written many years ago by H.G. Wells</P>
<P>This is a good film, it's not for everyone, and a bit gorey in places, but
it makes a great alternative to a traditional horror film.</P>
