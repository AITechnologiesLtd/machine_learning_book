<P>     Working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of 
frustration for a front-line African American actress like Jada Pinkett 
Smith.  Despite being one of the freshest talents available, Pinkett 
Smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts (A 
LOW DOWN DIRTY SHAME, THE NUTTY PROFESSOR).  The problem is, of course, 
that there aren't many good roles available for black women.  Take away 
the likes of WAITING TO EXHALE, SET IT OFF, SOUL FOOD, and EVE'S BAYOU, 
and all that's left is a chance to be someone's girlfriend, a local 
whore, or a murder victim.  As a result, for Pinkett Smith's first 
opportunity atop the marquee, she is stuck in a stupid, formulaic 
romantic comedy with the unpromising title of WOO.</P>
<P>     Actually, WOO, the latest directorial effort from Daisy V.S. Mayer 
(PARTY GIRL), could have been worse than it is.  The film offers a few 
funny (albeit juvenile) moments and the on-screen relationship between 
Pinkett Smith's Woo and Tommy Davidson's Tim is appealing on those rare 
occasions when the two aren't forced to play it dumb for the sake of an 
endless barrage of cheap gags.  Unfortunately, huge portions of the 
movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple-digit 
I.Q.  The situations are painfully contrived, the main characters are 
lifted right out of sit-coms, and the supporting players are so 
incredibly stupid that I wondered whether they all participated in some 
kind of "free lobotomy" lab experiment.  </P>
<P>     Woo is a spontaneous, energetic young woman who has been looking 
for love in all the wrong places.  Her latest relationship, with a 
testosterone-overdosed drug-dealer, came to an abrupt end when she 
refused to wear a beeper.  Now, her transvestite/medium friend 
Celestrial (Girlina) predicts that she's about to meet Mr. Right, and 
that he'll be a Virgo.  Later that day, Woo is given an opportunity to 
go out on a blind date with Tim, a shy man with a penchant for neatness 
and order, who just happens to be a Virgo.  It's not love at first 
sight, however.  Things get off to a rocky start when Tim makes an 
awkward pass, and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky 
restaurant to enjoy a "quiet" dinner. </P>
<P>     In the one-hundred year history of motion pictures, there have been 
a ton of bad "white" movies about mismatched lovers, so I suppose it's 
only fair that we get a "black" effort of the same low caliber.  As in 
all romantic comedies, we know from the beginning that Woo and Tim are 
going to end up together.  The question is, are their courtship rituals 
entertaining?  In a good entry to the genre, the audience becomes caught 
up in the love story, no matter how familiar it is.  In WOO, the 
constant reliance upon unfunny, moronic humor sinks the project.</P>
<P>     For those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes, there's a huge one 
in WOO involving a Corvette with a broken window that miraculously 
repairs itself (added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its 
top).  Sadly, that's one of the film's most enjoyable sequences, and the 
entertainment value is entirely unintentional.  Despite exuding charm 
from every pore, there's little that Pinkett Smith and Davidson can do 
to save their characters or David C. Johnson's script.  Since it misses 
the mark by so much, a better name for WOO might have been WHOOPS.  </P>
