<P>In Speilberg's Always, the dead hang around for awhile, tying up the loose
ends of their lives. In Jacob's Ladder, the dead hang around in a similar
manner, having to make peace before they can move on. Ditto with
Beetlejuice, High Plains Drifter, Ghost, etc. It's all about preparation. In
that regard the The Sixth Sense is no different. There's even a brilliant
little thematic moment where a red balloon is released in a staircase. It
climbs, climbs, rising steadily away from the party, and then finally comes
to rest against the ceiling, unable to go any higher. Yet. It's no accident
either that director/writer M. Night Shyamalan has the young Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) be the only one aware of this balloon. He can, after all, see
the dead, who are similarly trapped.
But of course he doesn't tell people this. Until child psychologist Malcolm
(pay-attention-to-the-name) Crowe (Bruce Willis) enters his life. The deal
with Crowe is that he feels he once failed to reach a similarly tortured
patient, and his failure led to the tragedy which the movie opens with: that
former patient breaking into Crowe's home for some impromptu therapy. The
Sixth Sense is set a year after that tragic session, but Crowe is hardly
over it. During that year of ostensible convalescence--both psychological
and physical--his marriage has fallen quietly apart, to the point where he
and his wife no longer talk. If he can only help this Cole, maybe everything
will be all right again.
So for Crowe, it's about redemption.
For Cole, however, it's about making it down the hall to the bathroom at
night, an acute terror we feel with him, although at that point there's yet
to be anything supernatural on-screen. But when it comes, hold on. Remember
about 45 minutes into Exorcist III, where an unannounced nun with some
cadaver tool floats silently across the hall, in the background? One of the
single scariest moments in moviedom, for the simple reason that, 45 minutes
into it, the tension level is so high that the slightest thing can release
it all at once. M. Night Shyamalan understands this thoroughly, and handles
his 'manifestations' with a steady hand. He never crowds a room with them,
but chooses instead to simply reflect them in a child's reaction shots. It's
not so much that they're out of the frame, though, as with The Blair Witch
Project. It's that they're locked into Cole's point-of-view, thus
inaccessible, or, only accessible when dramatically effective, which drains
a little off the illusion of reality any horror film depends upon. In
Shyamalan's defense, though, perhaps he delayed putting Cole's 'sixth sense'
on-screen simply because he wants us to know the viewer before the viewed.
Otherwise Cole might get upstaged.
All minor issues aside though, what stands out is how Shyamalan leads us to
believe that the dramatic line is lifted directly from Good Will Hunting:
the therapist and the patient both depending on each other for a cure. And
in a sense this is the dramatic line, but in the final moments, in what's
already looking like a typical Hollywood epilogue, it's recast in an
unconventional light. One that makes you reconcieve the whole movie, much as
Arlington Road did. Much as Jacob's Ladder did. The real surprise, though,
is that The Sixth Sense owes more to Always than to Jacob's Ladder. The
dual-epiphanies Cole and Crowe eventually achieve--tying together subplots
which seemed incidental but were in fact pivotal--make you appreciate the
darkened theater. People can't see your eyes without lights. But then
they're misty too: The Sixth Sense is a horror movie with an unexpected love
story embedded in it. Prepare.
