<PRE>HALLOWEEN: H20
RATING:  7.5 / 10 -->Re-watchable</PRE>
<P>Michael Myers (AKA The Shape) return as the little brother who never
dies, in this seventh installment (called H20 because it takes place 20
years after the original story/movie took place) of the coveted
HALLOWEEN series. The original was directed by horror-meister John
Carpenter.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Laurie Strode (Curtis) has moved on with her life. She is now the
headmistress of a private school, of which her son is a proud 17-year
old member. She's changed her name and assumed a new identity, because
she still fears that her crazy little brother, who murdered her friends
and sister twenty years ago, will return and try to kill her again.
Halloween night approaches. Michael Myers returns. Let the killing
begin.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
The horror genre is back, and so is Mr. Kevin Williamson's wonderful
touch on all things scary. This movie's packed with all the screams,
cheers, laughs and gross-outs that you could swing a spooky stick at.
It's everything you ever looked for in a scary popcorn movie. Period.
And on those fronts, this movie delivers just like SCREAM (8/10),
SCREAM 2 (7/10) and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (7.5/10) did over
the past couple of years. All films signed by Kevin Williamson. Advised
be those who did not care for any of the previously mentioned films, to
avoid this teenage-bludgeoning, blood-letting, LL Cool J-costarring
funfest.</P>
<P>In case anyone is worried about not having seen any of the previous
Halloweens-don't worry, the whole back-story is explained pretty
quickly, and frankly, the story is that this man with the eerie mask is
f-cked up real bad, and wants to kill people, most prominently his
sister. The film does start off a little slow, and did offer up one too
many "fake scares" in my humble opinion, but once the action gets
going, it really takes off! Another cool thing about this movie is that
it's barely an hour and a half long. It doesn't get bogged down in
explanation after explanation, but does demonstrate various ways in
which a psychopath could stab people. Speaking of which, there are at
least two PSYCHO (7/10) references in this movie, one alone, coming
from Ms. Psycho herself, Janet Leigh, who has a throwaway part in this
film as the school's secretary.</P>
<P>People screamed, people laughed, people screeched (Mrs. JoBlo got the
guts scared out of her), people farted...let's just say that people had
a blast! (Mind you, I saw this film on the first showing of the first
night that it came out. Real horror fans only, please.) Oh yeah, and
did I mention that John Carpenter's "theme to Halloween" remains one of
the eeriest scores to run a movie over? Good stuff. All in all, if
you're a horror fan, and like all of the other Kevin Williamson-based
films, there's no good reason why you shouldn't truly enjoy this one
(Besides the fact, that it's not jam-packed with hip, young, successful
Hollywood stars and starlets.) And if you don't dig horror, well, I
guess there's always THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY (7/10)!</P>
<P>Note: Double up on the salsa for this one. Trust me, the nachos will
thank you later.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Jamie Lee Curtis was paid a hefty sum of $8000 for her role in the
original HALLOWEEN, and $100,000 for the follow-up.
At one point during this movie, you could clearly see SCREAM 2 playing
on a television set. At one point during the original SCREAM film, you
could see the original HALLOWEEN playing on the television set.
Janet Leigh is Jamie Lee Curtis' mother in real-life. Actor Tony Curtis
is her real-life father. Janet Leigh was the lady who "got it" in the
infamous shower scene from Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO. 
Other titles for this movie were "Halloween 7", "Halloween 7: The
Revenge of Laurie Strode", "Halloween: H20 (20 Years Later)" and
"Halloween: The Revenge of Laurie Strode."
TV's "Dawson's Creek" connections: Actress Michelle Williams stars in
the show. Director Steve Miner has directed episodes of the show. And
wunderkid Kevin Williamson created and produces the show.
Jamie Lee Curtis met her husband Christopher Guest after she saw a
picture of him in the Rolling Stone magazine, and cleverly made sure
that his agent got her number.</P>
