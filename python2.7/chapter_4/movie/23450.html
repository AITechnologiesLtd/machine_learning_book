<P>The world of adult films is a compelling subject for a documentary
film. It is a topic that many people are aware of, but not in much
detail. It has a sordid nature that draws prurient interest, but it is
also yet another human endeavor, with the same banality as other
occupations.</P>
<P>Rather that examining the porn industry directly, this film by veteran
documentary filmmaker Christine Fugate follows the career of one
particular individual, adult film star Stacy Valentine. The film
follows Stacy for several years and focuses primarily on her personal
life, which is also highly influenced by her professional life.</P>
<P>As the film begins, Stacy is an established presence in the adult film
world. Stacy gives a first person account of how she entered the
business. She relates that her husband at the time encouraged her to
send nude photos to a magazine. Upon winning an amateur contest, she
progressed to doing professional magazine layouts, and then to
starring in films. The professional success and financial foundation
that came from these first forays into the business gave her the
confidence to leave her controlling husband and move to Hollywood to
pursue a full-time career as a porn star.</P>
<P>The film then follows Stacy as she builds her career. In detailing her
professional life, the film follows her on some actual shoots of her
films, as well as following her self-promotion as she attends adult
film conventions, industry awards, and even a trip to Cannes. Also
chronicled is the regular maintenance that must be performed to keep
up to date for her job, like going to tanning salons and having
various types of plastic surgery performed. The film follows her
personal life as she travels back to Oklahoma to visit her mother, and
as she tries to develop a relationship with her boyfriend, Julian.</P>
<P>The primary flaw with the film is that it lacks a clear vision for its
subject. It follows Stacy for too narrow a period of time to make a
clear point. The strength of the film is that it skillfully balances
both the lurid and mundane aspects of its source material. When
dealing with a sensational topic like this, it is easy for a film to
focus on the sordid details and lose sight of its main subject. The
primary focus of the film is on Stacy as an individual, and a
secondary portrait of the adult film industry can be extrapolated. The
film cannot avoid containing a significant amount of frank sexual
imagery, but it tries to keep the clinical, professional perspective
in which it was produced. The most objectionable imagery may be the
detailed coverage of Stacy's many plastic surgeries.</P>
<P>The film is successfully able to humanize Stacy. Her reasons for
choosing her profession are an odd mix of security and insecurity. She
is totally comfortable with sex and her sexuality, but she feels that
sex is the only thing she is good at. She likes the financial rewards
of her job because it gives her total independence, which is important
because she does not want to be dependent on a man for security.
Ultimately, Stacy feels the same types of personal and professional
pressures as most people, but her world is totally alien compared to
that which most people inhabit.</P>
<P>Recommended. Although the film lacks enough focus to be completely
engaging, it competently outlines its subject. It shows the ways that
individuals who are part of the adult film business deal with career
related problems like everyone else, and also presents some of the
obstacles particular with that line of work. Because of its subject,
the film necessarily contains a large amount of nudity and sexual
content.</P>
