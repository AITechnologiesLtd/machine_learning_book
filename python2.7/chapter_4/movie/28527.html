<P>Call me naive, but until I saw director Rob Cohen's "The Fast and the 
Furious," I didn't know there was a such thing as underground car racing 
gangs in the United States. Not being a mechanic or car aficionado, I also 
had no idea how cars could so quickly speed up to 140 mph. While the jury's 
still out on how realistic "The Fast and the Furious" is concerning its 
details on automobiles and racing, I, nonetheless, learned quite a bit from 
the film--more so than any usual moviegoing experience. I also learned that 
no matter how many slam-bang action scenes are put into a movie, the entire 
effort cannot work without a serviceable screenplay.</P>
<P>Set in the seedy world of street racing teams, Brian (Paul Walker) is an 
undercover cop who has managed to get in with one such group, led by Dominic 
Toretto (Vin Diesel). While his mission is to prove that they not only 
illegally race, but also hijack trucks on the side, Brian finds himself 
apprehensive of doing so when he not only becomes good friends with Dominic, 
but also falls for his sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster).</P>
<P>The plot of "The Fast and the Furious" is such a flimsy amalgamation of 
cliches and tedium that it not only remains wholly predictable from beginning 
to end, but also doesn't even find its premise until at least a half-hour in. 
Until then, we are treated to literally one scene after the next of people 
racing hot--no, make that very hot--cars. When the story finally shifts into 
high gear and we find that Brian is, indeed, a cop, the stakes are 
undoubtedly heightened. Unfortunately, this means that the pacing must slow 
down and the characters actually have to speak. They are not helped much at 
all by the underwhelming screenplay by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist, 
and David Ayer. That it took three separate people to pen such a thin script 
is quite humorous, and just a little mindboggling.</P>
<P>The action sequences, by the way, are so thrilling that they almost 
single-handedly save the film from its countless flaws. The tight, precise 
editing aids in making each and every car racing sequence a high-throttle joy 
to behold, and a climactic scene involving a botched truck hijack is 
downright nailbiting. It's very easy to forget about such "frivolous" things 
as character involvement and story developments when your body is being 
overtaken by such rapid-fire images of excitement and danger. But once each 
scene has taken its toll, you are grounded back to the reasons why the movie, 
as a whole, is simply not finding the footing it should.</P>
<P>The cast is professional and attractive, but little else (with two 
exceptions). Vin Diesel (2000's "Pitch Black"), that of the muscular build, 
shaved head, and baritone voice, turns in another effective, highly modulated 
performance as the loyal Dominic. As his younger sister, Mia, Jordana 
Brewster (2001's "The Invisible Circus") is a strong actress with a brain to 
go along with her stunning beauty. While it would have been nice to see 
Brewster act as more than virtual wallpapering, at least she has more to do 
than Michelle Rodriguez (2000's "Girlfight"), as Dominic's sensual, 
hard-edged girlfriend, Letty. Who knows if Rodriguez is any good? All she is 
asked to do is make brooding, "I'm-so-tough" faces on cue. Finally, Paul 
Walker (2000's "The Skulls") gets his very first leading man role as 
undercover police officer Brian, and he doesn't impress. There just doesn't 
seem to be anything behind Walker's facial expressions, and so his character 
doesn't win the audience's sympathies as it should.</P>
<P>Despite several slow patches and an ending that doesn't know when to quit 
(yet still manages to leave characters and relationships hanging without 
closure), "The Fast and the Furious" offers mindless summer movie fun for 105 
minutes. If anything, the action leaves a cursory adrenaline rush. When the 
movie is over, though, don't expect to think about it again--because you 
won't.</P>
