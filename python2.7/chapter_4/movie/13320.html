<PRE>OUT OF SIGHT
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1998 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Hollywood has a .750 batting average with Elmore Leonard adaptations.
Last year's TOUCH was ill-conceived and just plain odd but GET SHORTY, 
JACKIE BROWN and now OUT OF SIGHT all were highly entertaining movies.
Steven Soderburgh, master of sex, lies and videotape, now adds crime to
his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery, prison, double-crossing,
uncut diamonds and, oh yeah, true love. </P>
<P>        George Clooney is the protagonist, a risky choice after such duds as
BATMAN AND ROBIN and THE PEACEMAKER, but for once I didn't want to slap
the taste out of his mouth. He plays his role in OUT OF SIGHT as the suave
Cary Grant-type perfected in Hitchcock movies, the kind of guy to whom
crime is just a profession like any other. Nowhere present is Clooney's
usual ain't-I-sexy sneer -- there's just enough leftover lightheartedness
to fit in with the Leonard style. Clooney is definitely a perfect
successor to John Travolta in GET SHORTY. </P>
<P>        Clooney plays a man who's robbed about 200 banks without ever
using a gun. In the opening scene, he walks into one bank and robs it not
only with ease but with charm. Of course, he gets caught, so it's not all
good. It's while doing time in a Florida prison that Clooney learns of one
rich inmate's (Albert Brooks in a frightful bald wig) collection of
diamonds in Detroit. Clooney and cohort Ving Rhames plan the score, while
protection artist and fight promoter Don Cheadle begins rival plans. </P>
<P>        Meanwhile, there's Jennifer Lopez. Unintentionally funny in SELENA
and intentionally funny in ANACONDA, she's finally graduated to a worthy
role as the U.S. marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the
night Clooney escapes. Rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen
car, and Lopez makes it a threesome, her hostage ass locked in a trunk
with Clooney. He's covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck, and it's a
little cramped in there, but they manage to make a love connection
anyway, probably because it's a movie. </P>
<P>        The relationship between Clooney and Lopez is at the heart of the
movie, and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir-ish
crime story. The Leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than
crime, and this is no exception. Although they're not really germane to
the plot, Lopez's relationship with her father (Dennis Farina of GET
SHORTY), Rhames' relationship with his Christian sister (you could call
her Sister Christian) and a pop-in cameo by Michael Keaton all lend extra
class to a movie already full of it. </P>
<P>        OUT OF SIGHT spans at least three years but has a non-linear
structure, focusing on the jailbreak / Brooks score and flashing back to
earlier times. This is a movie with a brain, as smooth and calculated as
the Clooney and Lopez characters themselves. The entire cast does the
material justice -- Clooney and Lopez coming into their own, and Rhames
and Cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites. Here's
hoping future Leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch. </P>
