<PRE>                              A WOMAN'S TALE
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>100 min., PG-13, Drama/Comedy, 1991
Director: Paul Cox
Cast: Sheila Florance, Gosia Dobrowolskia, Chris Haywood, Norman Kaye,
      Ernest Gray, Myrtle Woods</P>
<P>     This film is a segment in the life of an old woman, Sheila
Florance.  She embraces life with great hopes, and in ways that would
shock other people her age.</P>
<P>     I was surprised at how good A WOMAN'S TALE was.  It didn't look
very interesting to me, but it was part of a double feature and I wanted
to see the other film (THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE).  I enjoyed A
WOMAN'S TALE and suggest that you go to see it, whether you are a young
adult, a senior citizen, or in between.  On a scale of zero to five, I
give A WOMAN'S TALE a four.  A WOMAN'S TALE is rated PG-13 for adult
situations and female nudity.</P>
<P>     The cast in this film is great, especially Sheila Florance.  
Sheila Florance, I think, holds this film together.  Her character is
unlike what most people perceive old people to be like and Sheila
Florance seems to jump into the role.  With a different actress in the
role that Sheila Florance had, I think that this film would not have
been as good as it turned out to be.  Unfortunately, I have heard,
Sheila died shortly after the film's original release.  Gosia
Dobrowolskia is the woman who watches over Sheila Florance.  She did a
very good job, but doesn't hold the film together the way Sheila
Florance does.  The man who plays Sheila Florance's next door neighbor
(I don't remember who played him) also did a great job.  He also helps
hold the film together.  I think that the actor who was chosen to
portray him was perfectly picked.</P>
<P>     The film successfully combines comedy with a bleak, at least to
some people, subject.  The end result is an interesting film that makes
the viewer think while watching the film.  The film is very well
written, and provides interesting characters.  The scenes in the film
flow together smoothly and the film doesn't get too dark about the
subject of death, which otherwise could have bogged this film down.</P>
