<PRE>Stigmata -- That's Gotta Hurt
by Curtis Edmonds -- <A HREF="mailto:blueduck@hsbr.org">blueduck@hsbr.org</A></PRE>
<P>The year was 1990, the movie was Miller's Crossing, and the man was
Gabriel Byrne.  Byrne had the plum role of Tom Reagan, Irish gangster, a
smart guy in a tough town.  Byrne spent the whole movie laconically
spitting out hard-bitten Coen Brothers dialogue as if he were born to
it. He didn't have the Bogart charm but had all the Bogart flair, with
the cynical coolness thrown in.  Miller's Crossing didn't break any box
office records but has its place on many critic's ten best of the '90's
lists.  (Personally, I like Miller's Crossing better than Fargo, the
Coen Brothers movie that made the AFI 100 list.)</P>
<P>The year was 1993, the movie was True Romance, and the girl was Patricia
Arquette.  Arquette played Alabama Worley, who hooked up with Christian
Slater on a cross-country road trip in search of a better life through
drug trafficking.  True Romance was the movie that introduced us to a
young screenwriter named Quentin Tarantino, and there hasn't been a more
attractive performance in any Tarantino movie than Arquette's.  True
Romance is no Pulp Fiction, of course, but it has lots and lots of
things to like.</P>
<P>Hold on to these memories.  You'll need them if you go see Stigmata.</P>
<P>Arquette plays Frankie Paige, a Pittsburgh hairdresser working in the
Dennis Rodman Memorial Beauty Salon, offering a wide range of services
from hairstyles and manicures to tattoos and piercings.  Frankie is a
twenty-three year old party girl (Arquette is actually 31) hanging out
in the best dance clubs and coffee houses.  She lives in the type of
fabulously decorated Art Deco loft apartment you only see in the movies.</P>
<P>Arquette's mother (who we must assume is paying for all this) travels to
Brazil and sends her the rosary of a dead priest.  That evening,
Arquette is lounging in one of those bathtubs you only see in the
movies, surrounded by votive candles.  Suddenly a dove flies through the
apartment, all portentous and symbolic.  And then, to the tune of the
Smashing Pumpkins and with full music video accompaniment, big, bloody
holes appear in Arquette's wrists.  The shots of Arquette writhing in
pain are accompanied by close-ups of nails being driven into the wrists
of a crucified man to make sure we get the point:  Arquette is being
afflicted by the stigmata, the representation of the Five Wounds of
Christ on the cross.  (I count seven, but who am I to argue?)</P>
<P>There are four such scenes in the movie, with Arquette getting wounds on
her hands, head, feet, and back in slow motion.  (She's wearing platform
shoes in the scene where here feet are pierced, which makes for a
particularly silly vision.)  After the second such attack, Gabriel Byrne
shows up to investigate.  Byrne's character, a priest / organic chemist,
is the Vatican's answer to the Men in Black.  Or, if you like, he's the
keeper of the Catholic version of the X-Files.  His role is to
investigate paranormal happenings and either disprove them
scientifically or hide the evidence.  (One imagines him traveling to New
Mexico and surreptitiously scarfing down tortillas with Christ's image
on them.)</P>
<P>Anyway, Byrne reads about Arquette's stigmata through the Vatican's
press clipping service (one wonders if they get Weekly World News).  He
investigates briefly, initially dismissing the idea that the irreligious
Arquette could have stigmata.  However, after seeing the spirit of the
dead Brazilian priest possess Arquette in a rain-slicked alley, he
becomes a believer.  Things get even sillier from here, as the plot
begins to turn around a long-lost Gospel that has severe implications
to... er... the value of the Vatican's real estate holdings.  And it
gets even sillier when the plot threatens a romance between Byrne and
Arquette.</P>
<P>The problem with Stigmata is that it doesn't have any sense of humor to
balance out the sheer overwhelming preposterousness of the story.
There's a scene, late in the movie, where Arquette is possessed by a
demon, and it's almost exactly like a similar scene in Ghostbusters.
One almost expects Arquette to whisper huskily to Byrne, "Do you want
this body, sub-creature!"  But there's no levity to leaven the movie, no
sense by the actors that this is all just a colossal joke.</P>
<P>Stigmata is not a bad movie, in the sense of having bad acting or
production values or a lifeless, boring script.  But it's not good,
either.  Stigmata is a trashy, violent, witless movie, beset with a
deeply confused notion of the supernatural and a defiantly dumb ending.
It has a little, tiny bit of guilty-pleasure entertainment value, but
it's not worth passing by either Miller's Crossing or True Romance on
your video-rental shelves.</P>
