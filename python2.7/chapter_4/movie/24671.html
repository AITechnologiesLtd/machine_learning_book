<P>         Oh, to be able to go back to those happy, carefree days of
student life, when responsibilities could be easily shrugged off,
friends were loyal, dinner consisted of leftover pizza and ramen noodles
and studies could be easily brushed aside in favor of attending a beer
bash.</P>
<P> What? That wasn't your college experience?</P>
<P> Then you obviously didn't attend the University of Ithaca, the
alma mater of the gang in "Road Trip," a relentlessly tacky cruise into
the depths of cheap jokes and shock humor. Pasted together from scraps
of "There's Something About Mary," "The Sure Thing" and approximately 70
other teen-oriented comedies, the movie is a prime example of what can
result from filmmakers pandering to the lowest common denominator. It's
also pretty funny in its own right, although few people over the age of
21 are going to be courageous enough to admit they laughed at it.</P>
<P> Leading us on this perversion excursion is Barry (Tom Green),
an overripe undergraduate who's currently in his eighth year at Ithaca
and who conducts orientation sessions guaranteed to scare the living
daylights out of prospective attendees. Pointing out the psychology
building, he tells incoming freshmen "each semester, you'll be expected
to volunteer for cutting-edge experiments."</P>
<P> Barry also has a story to tell, a real whopper about his buddy
Josh (Breckin Meyer), who accidentally videotaped the one night he was
unfaithful to Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard), his girlfriend of three years.
Since she lives 1800 miles away in Austin, that wouldn't seem to be a
major crisis -- except that Josh's roommates accidentally mailed the
tape to her, thinking it was something else.</P>
<P> Now Josh, geeky Kyle (DJ Qualls), stoner Rubin (Paulo Costanzo)
and the happily amoral E.L. (Seann William Scott, destined to be forever
remembered as the "pale ale" guy from "American Pie") -- who theorizes
you're not really cheating if you and your true love are in different
area codes -- must scurry down to Texas to retrieve the cassette before
Tiffany gets ahold of it. Josh insists they must make it there in three
days, although given the speed of the U.S. mail these days, you'd think
they'd be able to take the scenic route and still make it with plenty of
time to spare. Following not so close on their heels is Josh's
one-night-stand Beth (Amy Smart), who was misled by Barry into thinking
the boys went to Boston instead of Austin and who winds up accidentally
causing some major mayhem of her own.</P>
<P> The screenplay by Scot Armstrong and director Todd Phillips
keeps beating you over the head with raunchiness until you're left with
only two choices: either walk out, or succumb. If you stick around,
you'll witness a gross-out farce that should make any cretin chuckle, a
veritable barrage of potshots at overweight lovers, blind people,
clueless sorority sisters, African-American fraternity brothers,
unctuous teaching assistants, snarky motel desk clerks, smarmy
restaurant workers, innocent white mice and drug-addled senior citizens.
A Best Picture nomination next spring seems somehow unlikely.</P>
<P> And yet "Road Trip" passes the test of a really good comedy: It
seems even funnier when you're telling your friends about it days later
than it did when you were watching it. Some critics have called this
phenomenon "depth-charge humor." If that's the case, then "Road Trip" is
a blast. James Sanford</P>
