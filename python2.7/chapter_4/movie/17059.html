<PRE>A Simple Plan</PRE>
<P>Starring: Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton & Bridget Fonda
Written by: Scott B. Smith
Directed by: Sam Raimi</P>
<P>Billy Bob Thornton, who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996's Sling Blade
after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer, is becoming
one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - American actors around
at the moment. As Jacob, the simple but at times very bright loser brother
of Bill Paxton's Hank, Thornton gives a performance which should leave an
indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers.</P>
<P>Three men, Hank (Paxton), Jacob (Thornton) and their friend Lou (Brent
Briscoe) stumble upon a plane wreck which, upon closer inspection, yields a
rotting corpse and a bag full of money. Jacob and Lou want to pocket the
cash. Hank, the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three, insists on
leaving the money for the authorities to find. Eventually, they agree to
keep the cash safe until the plane is found, and then split the money three
ways. Things start going wrong, though, with greed and violence weaving
their ways through their plan. Disaster is sure
to strike.</P>
<P>Director Sam Raimi, of The Evil Dead and Darkman fame, has made an
excellent and thought-provoking film, worlds away from the comic horror
films which made his name. While there are a couple of moments which might
remind one of his earlier work, Raimi has made an intelligent and mature
departure which will hopefully be
a sign of even greater films to come.</P>
<P>Scott B. Smith's screenplay, based on his novel (which I haven't read) is a
fine example of escalating tension. While it does remind one of Danny
Boyle's Shallow Grave without the abundance of black humour, it keeps the
drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality, or the lack
thereof, found in a film with this subject matter. Alar Kivilo's
cinematography reminds one of Joel and Ethan Coen's Fargo, with the bleak,
snowy landscape almost becoming another character. Danny Elfman also does
well with his moody, finely-written score.</P>
<P>If there's a flaw in the film, it's that it goes on for just a little too
long. Just when we think that they are about to wrap things up, Raimi and
Smith decide to let the film go on a little further. While this isn't
really a bad thing, it
did become a little frustrating at times (this may have been due to the
fact that I had consumed a large Sprite beforehand). The performances are
excellent, with the usually annoying Paxton in fine form and Bridget Fonda
giving a scene-stealing turn as Hank's scheming wife.</P>
<P>This is an excellent showcase for Thornton's fine skills as an actor and a
great change in direction for Raimi, who could very well have a career
ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films. Fingers
crossed, though, that this doesn't stop him from making another Evil Dead
sequel.</P>
<PRE>4.5 out of 5</PRE>
