<P>Nicholas Sparks' novel "Message in a Bottle" is a gossamer-thin story
of a columnist who finds the item of the title on a beach, reads the
enclosed letter, and then sets out to find the man who wrote it.</P>
<P>When she finally tracks him down, there's an instant mutual
attraction; sure, it's a sterling example of the literature one of my
college friends called "the 'I turned around and I was in love'
books," but on its own terms it's a perfectly passable daydream.</P>
<P>Director Luis Mandoki's adaptation of the best-seller maintains the
same mellowness,almost to a fault. Next to this, the films of "The
Horse Whisperer" and "The English Patient" could almost be mistaken
for entries in the "Die Hard" series. If the novel is best washed down
with a pitcher of herbal iced tea, this unquestionably beautiful movie
might make some in the audience wish for a triple espresso.</P>
<P>The screenplay has changed the setting of the drama, the occupations
of both the leads - Garret (Kevin Costner) no longer runs a scuba
school and Theresa (Robin Wright Penn) now has some kind of research
job that somehow allows her plenty of expense money and time off to
zoom around the country - and thrown in are some backwoodsy former
in-laws to make trouble for Garret. Why bother? Theoriginal material
would have worked just fine onscreen.</P>
<P>"Bottle" wants so very badly to be a world-class tearjerker and
there's no denying it has a whole lot of things going for it.
Costner's performance is relaxed and charming, much closer to the guy
everybody liked in "Tin Cup" and "Field of Dreams" rather than the
self-congratulatory figure of "The Postman." He and Penn - who seems
to have carefully studied Meg Ryan's moves from "Sleepless In Seattle"
- blend comfortably together, a major plus in any romantic drama.</P>
<P>The film's trump card turns out to be Paul Newman as Garret's salty
dad.  He and Costner have several wonderful small scenes together, and
Newman's work radiates with world-class starpower; it takes a lifetime
of training to turn a simple "go away" into a major laugh line.</P>
<P>The photography by Caleb Deschanel is also astonishingly pretty,
although that's not such a shock when you remember Deschanel was the
director of "Wind," a movie that was little more than two hours of
sailing ships and sea spray.</P>
<P>So why does "Bottle" feel half-empty instead of half-full? Part of the
trouble lies in Mandoki's approach to the story's ending, which worked
fine in the novel but seems corny in the extreme onscreen. Also, The
movie's pace is so leisurely - this being a Costner film you can bet
there are numerous lingering close-ups of Kev - attention tends to ebb
and flow like the tides Garret and Theresa ride.</P>
<P>There's a lot to enjoy in "Message in a Bottle," to be sure, and it
might be just the ticket for those in the mood for anything remotely
romantic. But like a festive basket of chocolate-covered potato chips,
it's the sort of thing that certain people will definitely appreciate
more than most.</P>
