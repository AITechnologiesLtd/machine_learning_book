<P>I know Godzilla. I love Godzilla. And I can tell you, THAT AIN'T GODZILLA!</P>
<P>An abomination to one of the icons of sci-fi history, "Godzilla" (aka Jurassic
Park 3) is another installment in a long line of merchandise-seeking films
botched by Hollywood in the greedy scramble for big $$$. Not since last
summer's "Batman & Robin" has the public been exposed to such a sham and
disgrace of a cultured figure.</P>
<P>Godzilla is portrayed by a T-Rex and -- in a "Gremlins" subplot -- manages to
have a horde of raptors as offspring. Of course, there is a bare thread of a
romance plot underlying the film that has the chemistry and excitement of a
Billy/Samantha storyline.</P>
<P>One pleasing aspect of Godzilla is the starring of Matthew "Wargames"
Broderick. I swear, this man hasn't changed a bit in 15 years! Sheesh. "Would
you like to play a nice game of chess?"</P>
<P>Bottom line? If you want to see more T-Rex's and Raptors running amuck in New
York, by all means see this movie.  But if you want to see a movie that has
ANYTHING at all to do with Godzilla,  go to your local video store! Hollywood
-- you have shamed yourselves yet again...</P>
