                   A ten-step film review by Ronald Hogan
                        Copyright 1992 Ronald Hogan</PRE>
<P>1)  The film begins with an invocation, a call to prayer which summons
Malcolm X to speak to the congregation.  And then the screen is filled
with the American flag.  Remember that the most significant film to
begin with that image was PATTON, and you're on the right track as to
what's at stake in MALCOLM X.  This film is nothing short of the first
black biographical film epic.  Most biographical films begin with some
sort of testament to their authenticity, usually in the form of a title
that says that the events are based on reality, sometimes through
voice-over.  PATTON had its subject directly address the film audience.
JFK relied on an extensive documentary-like overview.  MALCOLM X has
Malcolm address an audience, that might very well be us (on the symbolic
level, which is what I meant with PATTON as well), but significantly,
Malcolm X isn't seen.  Could it be that his words are more important
than his image?</P>
<P>2)  As the American flag burns, the film keeps returning to the
videotaped footage of Rodney King being beaten by LAPD officers.  I was
wary of this material before going to the film, wondering how it would
be handled, if it might just be in for inflammatory purposes.  This is
not the case.  It serves to underline the words of Malcolm in a way that
simply seeing him speak would not have done.  And, when Lee later shows
the violence against blacks that took place during the civil rights
movement, the viewer is struck by the similarities.  Spike Lee's point
is that things haven't changed for the black people since Malcolm X's
time, and the Rodney King footage is a very persuasive argument.</P>
<P>3)  After the overture, the film proper begins with a sweeping track
shot that eventually finds Spike Lee, and follows him down the streets
of Roxbury.  In a sense, the camera never really stops moving until the
film is done.  Oh yes, there are several static shots, probably more
than half the shots in the film, if one bothered to count.  But the eye
is drawn to the way the camera swoops and glides and revolves around its
subject.  Lee has always made the most of the incredible talent that
Ernest Dickerson possesses as a director of photography, and MALCOLM X
is Dickerson's highest accomplishment yet.  While the dance numbers in
SCHOOL DAZE seemed stagy and artificial, in MALCOLM X they overflow
with energy and exuberance.  Lee and Dickerson's control over the film
medium shows in every image.</P>
<P>4)  Malcolm X at one point states that he chose the name X because in
mathematics, it represents the unknown; as a black man, his past had
been taken from him so that he didn't know who he really was.  In the
broader sense, any life is unknown.  The biography or biographical film
can show the outward events, and surmise the inner life of the subject
from those events, but no matter how convincing, we have to remember
that it's only an inferential hypothesis.  In some of the ways the
camera moves around Malcolom, swooping in from different angles,
spinning around him, never staying in one place for very long, there may
be a suggestion of the kind of probing that goes on in the biographical
effort, the attempt to dig into Malcolm X's life and find out what was
at his core.</P>
<P>5)  The flashbacks into Malcolm's childhood, and the life of his
parents, are disjunctive at first.  They come abruptly, with no warning.
In the overall scheme, though, they establish an effective psychological
and symbolic link between Malcolm and his father.  The juxtapositions
become more meaningful each time they occur; the pieces fall into place
with each scene.  And the voice-over narration that accompanies some of
those flashbacks, and many other scenes, ground the film in Malcolm's
identity, making it the center of the picture.  Many of those
voice-overs seem to be straight out of the autobiography; as I mentioned
in step one, Malcolm's words appear to be his legacy.  The image, as
close as it is to the original, is not an icon to be worshipped, but a
reference point to what *is* important.</P>
<P>6)  While MALCOLM X is the history of Malcolm X, it's also the history
of black America.  Malcolm is there as a center around which the history
revolves, a focal point.  So it is through him that we learn about Joe
Louis, about zoot suits, about Jackie Robinson, and other key events.</P>
<P>7)  And through him that we get a history of black music.  Music has
generally been a strong suit of Lee's, but in MALCOLM X it improves
along with the rest of his talents.  The highlights include Lionel
Hampton, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and more.  Special attention
should, however, be called to the use of John Coltrane's "Alabama" for a
montage of the civil rights violence and Junior Walker's "Shotgun" as
the conspirators stake out the dance hall where they plan to kill
Malcolm.  And the full orchestral score that Terence Blanchard has
written for the film is as epic in scope as the subject demands.  The
music over the confrontation with the police is one of the most
effectively scored scenes of any film in 1992.</P>
<P>8)  I've already mentioned that the Rodney King footage is used in a
strong comparison with the civil rights violence of the '60s.  The use
of media footage from the period illustrates the conditions against
which Malcolm X was fighting.  It also works as a way to ground the film
in historical reality.  The 'imagined' life of Malcolm X is given
credibility not only through Denzel Washington's strong physical
resemblance, but through the art of surrounding that imaginative
material with footage that we already accept as the real thing.</P>
<P>9)  This technique was employed very effectively in JFK, and Lee has
taken some very useful lessons (and some graciously donated footage)
from that movie.  Like Oliver Stone, Spike Lee uses several different
types of film stock in the film.  Black and white film is used to
suggest television newscasts, no doubt recreating broadcasts that did
take place.  (In JFK, it was easier to tell, because we'd all seen
Oswald getting shot in reruns; we knew what it looked like, and we knew
that it was recreated accurately.  I rather doubt the majority of the
public is equally familiar with the media coverage of Malcolm X).  Then
there's the use of what looks like Super-8 in some scenes, and the
setting of most flashbacks in paler hues than the bulk of the film.
Film is a medium waiting to be manipulated, and Spike Lee is rapidly
becoming one of our best experts.</P>
<P>10)  The film began with an invocation.  It closes with a eulogy--and
the documentary footage of Malcolm X that had been missing until then.
Ossie Davis repeats the same words he spoke at Malcolm's funeral, and in
his words (and a special scene that follows), we are reminded that
Malcolm X is dead, but his legacy remains.  His life, like any life
deemed worthy of biography, serves as an example for all of us.  Much of
the talk around the film centers on Malcolm's separatist positions, but
MALCOLM X does present the tolerant Malcolm X that was emerging before
he was snuffed out.  It shows where Malcolm was heading--the footsteps
in which today's generation of black Americans would, it is implied, do
well to follow.</P>
