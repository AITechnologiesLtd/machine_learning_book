<P>    The second stinker and potential career-sinker for Rob Reiner
(remember NORTH?) is an odd one.  Here's an earnest, star-studded
docudrama about slain Sixties civil rights activist Medgar Evers that
all but ignores him!  Well, to be fair, GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI is really
about the decades-later retrial of Evers' assassin, white supremacist
Byron De La Beckwith, played here by a cackling James Woods in old-age
make-up.  (Calm down.  Though a scene-stealer-- and arguably the only
character who comes to life in this dreadful feature-- Beckwith is
on-screen for all of twenty minutes.  Maybe thirty.) At the center of
the story, instead, is Alec Baldwin's character, an Assistant D.A. who
spends years rebuilding the case against Beckwith and at the cost of his
marriage, reputation, and personal safety.  Yawn.  While it's always a
treat to see the one- time Jack Ryan front *any* film, his liberal-
white-legal-guy-with-guilt has been done before, and better, and most
recently by Mr. McConaughey in A TIME TO KILL.  You've already seen this
movie, so why bother?</P>
