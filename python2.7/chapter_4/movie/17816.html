<P>PLANET SICK-BOY:  <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>I can't decide which is more sick – seeing Hollywood cast my
grandfather's classmates as the romantic interests of girls that are
still waiting for their adult teeth, or the oddball casting of Dungeons
and Dragons club president David Spade and the ravishing French beauty
Sophie Marceau.  Or is it more twisted to make Spade, in his biggest
theatrical release since the death of Chris Farley, have a big, fat,
loser guy (Artie Lange, MAD TV) to hang around with?</P>
<P>Golden Globe nominee Spade (Just Shoot Me) stars as Dylan Ramsey, the
owner of a struggling Italian eatery who falls for the new tenant in his
L.A. apartment building.  She is Lila Dubois (Marceau, Braveheart), a
transplanted Parisian cellist who fled her country in an attempt to
ditch her smarmy ex-boyfriend Rene (Patrick Bruel).  Lila also has a
yapping little dog with a penchant of jumping out the window and hanging
out by the pier.</P>
<P>Dylan sees the dog as an attempt to get close to Lila, so he kidnaps the
dog while pretending to help her look for it.  As she grows fonder and
fonder of her seemingly kindhearted neighbor, he is horrified to find
out that the dog has apparently eaten the engagement ring of Dylan's
best friend and restaurant chef.  And, yes, there is a great scene where
he has to sift through the dog poop.</P>
<P>Spade, who co-wrote the film with first-timers James B. Cook and Marc
Meeks, is a slightly more sensitive version of his television character,
though his lines don't have the same gratifying sarcastic bite.  And he
is a little more successful than Just Shoot Me's Finch, as he is able to
woo both strippers (like Dylan's previous girlfriend) and women of
Marceau's caliber alike.  Conversely, Marceau really makes you
appreciate Emily Watson's cello-playing in Hilary & Jackie, although
when Sophie wraps her legs around the instrument, you don't so much care
about her acting chops.</P>
<P>Directed by Jeff Pollack (Booty Call), Lost & Found features a
hysterical cameo from hysterical cameo messiah Jon Lovitz, who plays a
dog whisperer (a la the Robert Redford film of a similar name).  There
are also a few great scenes involving some poker-playing grannies -
Estelle Harris (Seinfeld), Rose Marie (The Dick Van Dyke Show) and Marla
Gibbs (The Jeffersons).  For what it is, Lost & Found is not
disappointing and good for more than a few laughs.</P>
<P>1:40 – PG-13 for adult language, sex jokes and a little dog violence,
but nothing like There's Something About Mary</P>
