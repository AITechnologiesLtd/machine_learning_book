<P>THE RED VIOLIN (M).

Bideau, Greta Scacchi, Jason Flemyng, Sylvia Chang, Colm Feore, Anita

Running time: 131 minutes.</P>
<P>Canadian director Francois Girard, best known for his
inventive Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould, again uses music
as an inspiration in his new film, which is ostensibly five short
films about a fabled violin.  This beautiful, visually lush, and
breath-takingly romantic epic tells the story of a fabulous violin,
the last creation of master builder Nicolo Bussoti, and follows the
instrument across three continents.</P>
<P>The film opens in 17th century Italy, where Bussoti (Carlo
Cecchi) creates the violin as a lasting legacy for his beautiful young
wife, who died during childbirth.  Supposedly possessed by his wife's
soul, the magnificent violin plays haunting music that inspires all
who come in contact with it, and it becomes an object of obsession for
all who cross its path.  Over the centuries the violin passes across
Europe to England, and then on to China, where it narrowly escapes
destruction at the height of the Cultural Revolution.  The 300 year
old instrument then finds its way to a famed Montreal-based auction
house, where it is put up for sale.</P>
<P>The thread that links all the various stories is the auction
itself.  This key sequence is replayed several times, from the
different perspectives of the various interested parties who have come
to bid for the violin, which brings an element of suspense to
proceedings.</P>
<P>Girard has written the film in collaboration with Canadian
writer/director/actor Don McKellar (Exotica, etc), who plays a small
role here as an antiquities expert called in to help verify the
violin's authenticity.  However, not all the strands of this
multi-layered narrative dealing with lust, greed and the enduring
power of love and music, are successful.  Subsequently, the film is a
little uneven.  The modern day scenes in particular lack a sense of
passion and beauty.</P>
<P>Girard has assembled an impressive international cast to
breathe life into the story and the characters, but many of them play
small roles.  Samuel L Jackson lends dignity to his ambivalent role as
an expert called in to trace the provenance of a shipment of rare
violins due to be auctioned.  He becomes obsessed with the famed red
violin of history when he discovers it amongst the collection.  Jason
Flemyng (from Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, etc) and Greta
Scacchi steam up the screen as a flamboyant nineteenth century English
musician and his demanding and jealous mistress.  Christoph Koncz is
memorable as Kaspar Weiss, a young child prodigy.</P>
<P>The film has been beautifully shot by cinematographer Alain
Dostie, and the stunning visuals are further enhanced by John
Corigliano's compositions.  Francois Seguin's production design is
also impressive and brings alive the 17th century European settings.</P>
