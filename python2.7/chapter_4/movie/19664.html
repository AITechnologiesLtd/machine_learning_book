<PRE>                                THE MUSE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Albert Brooks, who last gave us a wryly cynical meditation on
mother-and-son relationships with MOTHER, turns now to a wryly cynical
meditation on Hollywood and inspiration with the aptly titled THE MUSE.</P>
<P>     Brooks plays Steven Phillips, a moderately successful Hollywood
screenwriter who suddenly finds he's lost `his edge.'  In desperation he
turns to friend Jack (Bridges), who introduces him to a girl named Sarah
(Stone), whom Jack claims is a muse.  Or rather, one of The Muses, a
source of divine inspiration.</P>
<P>     And Sarah seems to be the real thing inspiring greatness in
Bridges' character (he wins an Oscar) and a dozen really big celebrities
who make cameos throughout the picture (which becomes half the fun, so I
won't spoil their identities).</P>
<P>     Steven's wife (MacDowell) even gets in on the action, as Sarah
inspires her to bake cookies and eventually open a bakery.</P>
<P>     Of course, Brooks is typically hilarious here with humor that is at
once dry and at the same time over the top.  But he lost with me with
the end product that Sarah helps him create – an idiotic comedy script
that sounds like a cross between ACE VENTURA and `The Beverly
Hillbillies.'  It is even designed to star Jim Carrey.  I should hope
that if I get a muse, she brings me a better script than that.</P>
<P>     Any Albert Brooks fan will enjoy his latest.  It's not the home run
that say, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, is, but it's a classy film in an era of
low-class projects.</P>
<P>     Let me add the ironic footnote that Brooks himself ended up
distributing this picture through teeny outlet October Films, just as
his character is nearly forced to do in the movie.  You see, in the real
Hollywood, the greater your artistry, the lower on the totem pole you
have to go to find work.  That's how it really works.</P>
