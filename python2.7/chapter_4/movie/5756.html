<P>     Arriving in the latter half of the summer, Danny DeVito's MATILDA
beats out such worthy contenders as THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and
HARRIET THE SPY for best family fare of the season.  In fact, I haven't
enjoyed a so-called "children's film" this much since last year's BABE
or TOY STORY.  Although MATILDA, which is based on a story by Roald Dahl
(whose JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH reached screens earlier this year), is
primarily aimed at the under-10 crowd, DeVito has crammed this movie
with elements designed to appeal to adults.  The result is a highly-
satisfactory black comedy/fantasy that will find fans of all ages.</P>
<P>     MATILDA contains numerous elements of traditional fairy tales -- a
wicked step-aunt, a true friend with a pure heart, and more than a
little magic -- but "traditional" is about the last word that comes to
mind when describing this quirky film.  DeVito, whose previous efforts
include the viciously wacky WAR OF THE ROSES, is in fine form here,
exaggerating characters and situations to the point where they lose
their more terrifying edge without going so far that we no longer care
about any of the inhabitants of this world.  It's a fine line to walk,
but MATILDA rarely falters.</P>
<P>     The basic material may seem odd for a family film, dealing as it
does with issues of child neglect, abuse, and revenge.  By removing the
story from conventional reality, however, DeVito pulls it off.  This is
a world where adults (except two) are bad and children (except one) are
good.  It's a place where television is a force of mind-numbing evil and
where books represent escape and solace.  And, most importantly,
empowerment is genuine, not just a slogan.</P>
<P>     Matilda (Mara Wilson) is the youngest child, and only daughter, of
Harry and Zinia Wormwood (Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman), who are
described as living "in a very nice neighborhood in a very nice house",
but not being very nice people.  Mr. Wormwood is a used car salesman
with the police tracking his every move, and Mrs. Wormwood is obsessed
with bingo parlors and television game shows.  Both parents are
extremely neglectful of their little six-and-one-half year old daughter,
even though she shows signs of amazing intelligence and various
remarkable powers (she and John Travolta's character in PHENOMENON could
have long, meaningful discussions).</P>
<P>     Eventually, Mr. Wormwood notices his daughter long enough to send
her off to Crunchem Hall, an elementary school lorded over by the ogre-
like Miss Trunchbull (Pam Ferris), whose motto is "Use the rod, beat the
child."  She practices what she preaches, taking delight in punishing
her charges and informing them mercilessly that her idea of a perfect
school is one where there are no children.  Fortunately for Matilda, her
first grade teacher, Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz), is kind and good-
hearted, and immediately recognizes her new student's amazing gifts.</P>
<P>     Mara Wilson, who lit up the screen as Robin Williams' daughter in
MRS. DOUBTFIRE, and captured the Natalie Wood role in the remake of A
MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET, is enchanting without being either sickeningly
adorable or unbearably irritating.  She has a natural charisma, and
seems the perfect choice for the perky, indomitable Matilda.  Wilson
causes us care about the title character, and that identification is
necessary to MATILDA's success.  It's rare for an actor this young to
give such a polished performance.</P>
<P>     DeVito and his wife, Rhea Perlman, are effective in their
cartoonish roles.  Embeth Davidtz (FEAST OF JULY) radiates sweetness and
vulnerability.  And Pam Ferris takes on the Herculean role of Trunchbull
by sinking her teeth into it and going as far over-the-top as the
director lets her (which, in most cases, is pretty far).  She reminded
me forcefully of Ursula from Disney's animated THE LITTLE MERMAID.
Meanwhile, Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman) has a cameo as one of the
cops shadowing Harry Wormwood.</P>
<P>     MATILDA is not politically correct -- it is, after all, a pint-
sized revenge fantasy -- but, in this case, that's a definite plus.
Besides, for those who want bland, "wholesome" family entertainment,
there's always Disney.  Children aren't likely understand much of the
black comedy and satire here, but they'll be so involved in the story
that they won't notice that a lot is going over their heads.  Hardly a
moment of MATILDA can be described as either juvenile or condescending,
and, compared with many of this summer's so-called "mature" features,
that makes for a delightfully refreshing change-of-pace.</P>
