                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     David Mamet, among the best of the current American playwrights,
has adapted his two-character play by writing the screenplay and
directing the film, a story of sexual harassment.  Mamet maintains
there are two sides to every story.</P>
<P>     His play was written and completed shortly before University of
Oklahoma law professor, Anita Hill, testified to a Congressional
committee that Supreme Court nominee, Clarence Thomas, allegedly
subjected her to inappropriate behavior; U.S. Navy Lt. Paula Coughlin
spilled her story to the Washington Post of sexual abuse in the
Tailhook scandal ... and, of course, the Bobbit story.</P>
<P>     Mamet, in OLEANNA, tackles the problem of PC and what is sexual
harassment, how easily an innocent person can become a victim.</P>
<P>     In this case it is Carol (Debra Eisenstadt), a young college
student who visits her professor, John, (William H Macy), at his office
to complain about the low grade he has given her.   She comes as a
supplicant while the professor tries to explain to her the reason for
the low grade.  She blames him; he is a poor teacher.  He wonders if
that could be true.  He offers to erase the grade and give her an A for
the term if she will visit him once a week to discuss the course.</P>
<P>     She turns this into a case of sexual harassment which was the last
thing the professor, a happily married man, was thinking of.  Before
the session is over she has accumulated a list of grievances
(harassments) which she will turn over to the tenure committee that is
considering giving him tenure.</P>
<P>     As in most cases in real life, there is no real solution and the
film is no exception.  But the tense, very dramatic and literate
exchanges that are found in plays written for the theater rather than
TV or movies, make Oleanna a definite must-see film.   In addition the
acting is absolutely perfect; both Eisenstadt and Macy deserve to be
nominated when Oscar time rolls around.</P>
