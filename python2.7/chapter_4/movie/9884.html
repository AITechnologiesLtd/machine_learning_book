Kiss the Girls (1997)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 17 October 1997 with Lynne and Sandy for $7.75 at the Port
Washington Cinemas.</P>
<P>There is something compelling about *Kiss the Girls* that transcends its
inherent misogyny and depiction of depraved behavior. You want to find out
how they catch the man who is kidnapping beautiful and talented women and
who kills the ones who break the rules--his rules. Along the way, though,
you are imbued with a certain uncomfortable feeling that also transcends
the movie. Unless you're a serial killer yourself, there is nothing
entertaining about women being held captive and forced to do things
against their will, despite the porn industry's images that counter that
idea.</P>
<P>The movie is very carefully set up to make you want to care about finding
the killer. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) is a police psychologist whose
niece is kidnapped in the Research Triangle in North Carolina. Kate
McTiernan (Ashley Judd) is an doctor who is passionate about her work and
very gutsy and forthright. This, according to the movie's epistemology,
makes her ripe for being the next victim. But she manages to get away, and
insists on helping Alex find the culprit. </P>
<P>This is where the movie takes a few unbelievable turns--why on Earth would
these characters not *once* think of calling for backup? In New York City,
if a cop is even thought to be shot, 40 officers arrive on the scene in a
variety of vehicles. Why wouldn't an experienced detective call for back
up? Because making sense and making suspense do not always mix... </P>
<P>Ashley Judd really stands out at Kate. One aspect that I really enjoyed
was that when she escapes, runs through the woods, falls off a cliff and
suffers hypothermia -- it looks real. It's not like other filems where
heronines do all of it without scratching a nail. Her run through the
woods is full trips and falls and a lot of bruises; you are there with her
every step of the way, and that really makes the audience empathize. </P>
<P>What is disturbing throughout the film is the idea that somehow these
women made themselves victims simply because they were smart and therefore
visible. There is probably a good reason why there are so few female
serial killers, and this movie shows why, in so many ways. It's offensive
in that it is implied that compliant women are safe and the victim is to
blame.</P>
<P>Along the way, a few red herrings are tossed our way to "enhance" the
mystery, but formulaic movies defy these efforts.</P>
<P>Also starring were Cary Elwes, Tony Goldwyn, Bill Nunn, and Gina Ravera.</P>
