<P>     James Bond is back!  And isn't he better than ever?  After what
amounted to a six year hiatus, GOLDENEYE is the latest Bond movie
addition to the long-running 007 series tradition.  It has been
estimated that half the world's population has seen a James Bond
movie.  Meanwhile, hasn't the world changed?</P>
<P>     This time, the premise of the story concerns two lost secret
military first-strike earth orbiting Russian satellites with the
potential to burn ever so brightly enough to produce a burst of
electromagnetic energy overcharging and obliterating the electrical
circuits of every instrument and light-bulb within its target range ...
including, of course, flying MiG jets, computers, and other
orbiting eyes in the sky.  Such tactical precision, however, is not
without its disadvantages.  Once triggered, the spectacular fiery
explosion also takes the `Golden Eye` satellite down with it.  So it is
also with almost every device, every deception and every appendage that
makes the James Bond spy-adventure epic bond so well together.  Yes,
"Bond, James Bond" is back and this time REMINGTON STEELE's Pierce
Brosnan is the debonair secret service agent with the Aston Martin, a
penchant for vodka martinis, all of the luck and most of the toys.</P>
<P>     GOLDENEYE's addition to the 007 licensed-to-kill epic truly frames
a golden age of James Bond spy action and adventure.  The cinematic
event holds a rich history behind it - a rich tapestry of traditions
upon which this latest edition stands.  Afterall, depending upon how
one counts them, GOLDENEYE is the eighteenth motion picture adventure
adaptation of the literary works of Ian Fleming and later, John
Gardner.  Though Pierce Brosnan is no David Niven, in some respects
GOLDENEYE can be said to be the culmination of all nineteen Bond
movies.  Along with the usual measure of repartee-style satire, there
is a bomb of sorts, there is a James Bond nemesis and there are love
interests that probe the mantel of the story and the characters of all
the participants.</P>
<P>     Natalya Simonova, played by Izabella Scorupco, is the
Internet-savvy computer programmer in step with an information-driven
society.  She's a protagonist with Bond.  There is also the CIA and the
marines, a new "M," another Miss Moneypenny and good old "Q" played
once again by Desmond Llewelyn.  For antagonists, there is Xenia
Onatopp (rhymes with "on the top"), played with carnal abandon by Famke
Janssen.  She is a Georgian ex-fighter pilot in vacuous partnership
with former secret service agent Alec Trevelyan, as played by Sean
Bean.  As surely as death follows asphyxiation, the fate of such
relationships are fastened.</P>
<P>     Relationships to the old and usual are crucial.  In the all
familiar casino scene, the playing cards have no numbers.  Unless one
takes the time to count, only the shapes made by the configuration of
clubs, hearts, diamonds or spades on the cards are there to indicate
the card's value.  The idea that information counts is meaningful to
the story.  Afterall, in a world with no electrical circuits, there can
be no flow of information.  Just like the way in which a deck of
playing cards complete with numbers must in history precede the deck of
playing cards without any numbers at all, the flow of knowledge from
one utility to another is all essential.  Such is the legacy of
history.</P>
<P>     But does one need to know the historical significance of villain
Alec Trevelyan's Cossack parentage, or how historically the Zaporozhian
Cossacks became an authority unto themselves and with their hetmans
elected chieftains who proceeded to initiate schemes and designs
rivaling even those of SPECTRE?  No, enjoyment of GOLDENEYE makes no
absolute claim on this knowledge.  But the weight of history is another
matter.  What's bred in the bones of this epic are so many monumental
remains.  Though they provide ballast, they also exact a heavy toll.
GOLDENEYE confronts both the forces of our expectations and the ongoing
presence of our departed history.</P>
<P>     In GOLDENEYE, James Bond is indeed back and, chances are, he will
be back again to serve the interests of world peace and movie-screen
carnage.  But, if nothing else, he will also serve as sometimes
poignant testimony to the passage of time.</P>
