<PRE>IN SHORT: For the arthouse.</PRE>
<P>The Adventures of Sebastian Cole is one of those arthouse-centric movies
that goes heavy on character development and light on big story points.
Which is fine if the characters actually develop in some way. If they
progress from point A to, say, Point S. If they only get as far as Point
B, you're left to do all the work that the filmmakers should have done.
Sebastian Cole looked to be another coming of age story but is, in
actuality, more a series of reactions by the main character to small
events. Actors like pieces like this, because they get to develop Inner
Worlds to work from. If they their jobs well, we don't get to see them
"act". (usually a good thing). They do their jobs here, which means
there wasn't enough provided in writer/director Tod William's script to
satisfy me. It isn't that this is just a "small" film. It's downright
tiny.</P>
<P>The Adventures of Sebastian Cole begins with promise. Told in flashback,
we meet an upper-middle class family living life in the early 1980s.
Daughter Jessica (Mami Lustig) is leaving for college. Son Sebastian
(Adrian Grenier) is closing in on his last year of high school.
Step-father Hank (Clark Gregg) announces that he'd rather be Mother
Henrietta. Mom Joan (Margaret Colin) decides to take her son and return
to her native England.</P>
<P>That's a great beginning. Think how you'd react to this literally life
altering news. You could get angry, as Jessica does. You could meekly
accept, as Joan does. You could try to deal with it, which is what
Sebastian will do eight months on when he returns from England looking
like an 80s version of a mod. He's got frosted hair, styled clothes, not
as extreme as Flock of Seagulls but on that track.</P>
<P>His friends welcome him back. He finds a girlfriend, Mary. He balances
his real dad (John Shea) and that family with the very masculine
authority figure, who is always wearing a dress, that he lives with.
While Clark Gregg makes a really ugly woman, he pulls off the transition
with great skill. Indeed, his is the only character that you get a real
feeling for as Hank/Henrietta makes the full move from imitating
woman-hood to establishing a full identity as a woman to the final trip
to the clinic for the snip snip that will permanently end one life and
begin another.</P>
<P>Which leaves Sebastian, who has the usual rebellious streak that
teenagers have. Despite the strange twist life has presented, he seems
to be a fairly normal kid. He harbors ambitions to have great adventures
and to write of his experiences, as the young Hemingway did. While he
does have what he considers to be adventures, he never writes of them.
In short, just your average slightly-better-than-slacker teen.</P>
<P>When I first started writing this review, just after the screening, I
was really prepared to dump it into arthouse hell. Now, 24 hours later,
I've softened but not much. I don't consider The Adventures of Sebastian
Cole to be a great flick but the performances, at minimum, were good
enough to keep my attention focused while waiting for something to
happen. When that time hit, and I won't tell you what it was, it wasn't
enough for me.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Adventures of Sebastian Cole, he
would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$3.00</PRE>
<P>Rental level. The Adventures of Sebastian Cole is strictly for the
arthouse and festival circuit. If this is where you hang, this is what
you'll see.</P>
