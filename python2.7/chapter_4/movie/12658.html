<PRE>Godzilla:</PRE>
<PRE>A Review</PRE>
<PRE>by Jeremiah Rickert</PRE>
<P>Starring: Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Maria Pitilla, and Hank Azaria
Directed by: Roland Emmerich</P>
<P>     Oh boy, it's the edge of summer, and those two guys who ruled the
summer box office two years ago are back with their uber-flick, Godzilla.
With a gigantic budget and big-name stars...well, a gigantic budget
anyway, Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, the team behind Stargate,
Independence Day, and now Godzilla, are going for the summer-flick
hat-trick, and if hype alone can sell a picture, they will have it.</P>
<P>     The plot was definitely there, just enough to move the movie along,
although at times it seemed really slow.  With a running time of about 2
and a half hours, yet still barely enough plot, you have to wonder if the
next Devlin/Emmerich release will be all special affects and no story at
all...why bother with that pesky story element anyway?  There were a
number of jump-cuts, whenever the characters reached a decision about
something, the film suddenly jumped forward to just before it was about to
be implemented, making the transitions between grand action scenes as
short as possible, which means that the largest chunk of the movie is
action action action.  Some of the editing didn't quite seem up to snuff.
The cuts were jerky at times and you'd cut away from an action shot before
it was totally finished.  The editing team was a pretty good one too,
Peter Amudson (Daylight, Dragonheart, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, and SFX
work on Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back) and David Siegel (who
I believe was nominated for an emmy for work on Law and Order).  Despite
the pedigree of the team, I still thought the final product was not as
good as it could have been.</P>
<P>     The plot, by the way, is about the foul and large creature that is
produced due to French nuclear testing in the French Polynesian Islands.
(That's right, we've run out of enemies, so now it's time for the French.)
The French are the first to learn about the creature's existance, when
they investigate a large fishing vessel that was attacked and sunk.  They
are worried that their testing has caused whatever this thing is, and they
need to try to hush up the attack in order to protect their reputation.</P>
<P>     After -something- with huge footprints tromps across Jamaica, our
hero, Nick Tatopoulis (Matthew Broderick) is pulled away from his exciting
job of measureing radioactive worms at Chernobyl by the U.S. Dept. of
State, who takes him to the island to examine the large prints.  He is
added to a team of scientists, drafted by the govt. to try to get a bead
on what they are dealing with and how to deal with it.  Hollywood must
think that all scientists are beatniks, hippies, slobs, and wierdos,
because that is what we have in our group in this film. (as played by
Vicki Lewis, Malcom Danare, and Broderick.) The creature leaves a trail
that seems to be leading to New York City, where the creature is sure to
wreak a lot of havoc.</P>
<P>     Of course, he does hit new york, bigtime, causing a big ruckus,
panic, and a special effects extravaganza!  In the city, we are introduced
to the supporting players (well, they all kinda support old 'Zilla, but
who's counting) news anchor Charles Caiman, who gets the award for the
most horrible pun, played by Harry Shearer (Simpsons, Spinal Tap) his
assistant and former college flame of Tatopoulos, Audrey Timmonds, played
by Maria Pitillo (Dear God, TV's House Rules), and her friend's husband
and network camera man Victor "animal" Palotti, played by Hank Azaria
(Gross Pointe Blanke, Birdcage, Heat).  Also running around spying on the
Americans is French agent Phillipe Roche, portrayed by french actor Jean
Reno (The Professional, Mission Impossible)</P>
<P>     The French government still wants it covered up, the army wants it
dead, and Godzilla just wants to build a nest, even if it means (and it
does) destroying most of Manhattan in the process.  </P>
<P>     The special effects are of course excellent.  They are consistently
good throughout the film, and for the high price-tag they well should be.
The creature itself manages to be CGI without looking too much like CGI, a
welcome change from the recent Lost In Space, which featured a CGI
creature that looked like a cartoonist had sketched it on the film with a
colored pencil.  The sound was pretty darned good as well, with lots of
good breathing, tail swooshes, and crunching buildings to entertain the
ears and the eyes.  Emmerich's direction was satisfactory, and there was
actually one nice bit of foreshadowing, however obvious it may have been,
when the camera follows a dirt road that the footprints are leading down,
and then fades into a shot of a city street.  </P>
<P>     The acting is satisfactory as well, but even the "names" in the cast
don't do anything spectacular.  Broderick is wooden and distant, even when
he's trying to show feelings for his lost love, Audrey.  Apparently even
the oft-heard Love Theme From Godzilla cannot stir his emotional fires.
The army is, as usual, portrayed as bunch of buffoons, who can't and don't
think.  They seem to choose the hard way to do things, even though every
10yr old in the audience is saying over and over "why can't they just send
a laser guided bomb after him from a high altitude."  The rainy helicopter
chases were actually kinda fun, though, even if a bit far fetched.  Of
course, the idea of a giant lizard is far-fetched as well.  The French
mercinaries are played for laughs as well, frowning at stinky coffee and
being saddened that they couldn't find a croissant.  The laughs I got out
of the film were from things not meant to be funny.  When Nick is staring
into the face of Godzilla, and the love theme was playing, I accidentally
said "phone home" in an ET voice and sent the surrounding three rows into
laughter.  The casting of Audrey again pokes one of my biggest movie
nerves, and that is the female leads looking 15 or 16, but actually being
28.  Her acting was fine, it's just it's hard for me to visualise maturity
when the character looks 16.  </P>
<P>     Some of the other items played for laughs are the chubby Mayor Ebert
and his sidekick and assistant Gene, who try to play out the political
ramifications of Godzilla, with all the appropriate thumbs up and down.
It got old really really really quickly.</P>
<P>     Overall, expect a typical summer flick, action, explosions, lack of
plot, cheesy characters, cheap humor, this one fits the formula to a tee.
And of course, following the lead of Lost Word, they pumped it into as
many theaters opening weekend as possible (a record amount) so by the time
the word of mouth got out, a great number of people had already plunked
down their $6-$10 to see it.  Nice plan, and I expect a lot of films are
going to follow the same formula.  So for what it was, it delivers, as a
piece of art...a film, it's kinda bleah.  I will give them one point for
class, though, they managed to avoid a lot of bodies being ripped...blood,
guts, and I didn't hear one wet squish.  </P>
<P>Of the $3.50 I paid for it, it was worth about $1.75</P>
