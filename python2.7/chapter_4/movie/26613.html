<PRE>PLACE VENDÔME
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In Nicole Garcia's PLACE VENDÔME, Catherine Deneuve delivers an 
exquisitely underplayed and delicately nuanced performance as the 
alcoholic Marianne.  The problem in a nutshell is that her acting is the 
only reason to see the movie.</P>
<P>Early in the story, Marianne's husband of 18 years commits suicide.  A 
diamond dealer, he had been caught selling stolen stones, which caused 
him to lose face at his firm although not be arrested.  Although 
threatened with bankruptcy by her husband's partners, she refuses to 
sign over her shares in the firm.  Having once been "in the trade" 
herself, she goes back to the slightly seedy marketing of diamonds to 
private customers in hotel rooms.</P>
<P>In her husband's secret compartment, she finds a stake, three sizable 
stones, to get her started back in the business.  But with their Mafia 
connections, these large beauties are as hot as a firecracker, so no one 
reputable will buy them from her.</P>
<P>Much is made of Marianne's illness.  Her husband points out that she has 
checked herself in and out of the clinic so often that she has only 
spent 17 nights at home in the past year.  After starting back to work, 
she says that she is on the wagon, but hers is a strange sobriety.  She 
still drinks all of the time, but, since she doesn't guzzle it down, she 
no longer shows signs of drunkenness.</P>
<P>Laurent Dailland's cinematography is heavy on the dark atmospherics with 
a muted color palette that accentuates the drab grays.  He likes nothing 
better than to give us such hazy, underlit scenes that you wonder if 
there is a brownout.  And the director sets such a languid pace that if 
a character fired a gun, the bullet would take a full two minutes to 
strike its victim.</P>
<P>The biggest cheat is that PLACE VENDÔME is the type of story in which 
you wait in vain for something to finally happen.  Watching Deneuve at 
work is a treat, but it isn't enough.</P>
<P>PLACE VENDÔME runs 1:57.  The film is in French with English subtitles.  
It is not rated but would probably be an R for brief violence and 
language and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
