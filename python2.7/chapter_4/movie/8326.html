<PRE>                                FACE/OFF
                          A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1997) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        In a summer populated with stinker action flicks like 
SPEED 2 and THE LOST WORLD, John Woo's FACE/OFF is a 
breath of Fresh/Air. This is just what I want from an action movie -- 
something that gives us artistic, well-choreographed scenes of 
violence and explosions contained in an intelligent plot about 
interesting characters we care about. That's the recipe right there, 
and the auto-pilot writing of those two sequel action flicks 
shortchanged us in at least half of those departments.</P>
<P>        FACE/OFF takes the time-worn body-switching premise 
and makes it fascinating again. John Travolta plays a cop who's 
spent most of his adult life tracking down psycho criminal Nicolas 
Cage, to the chagrin of his sick-and-tired-of-it-but-still-standing-by-
her-man wife Joan Allen. When Travolta finally captures Cage after 
an airplane hangar, he can't let it go at that. He lets himself get 
sucked back into the case when he finds out Cage planted a bomb 
somewhere in the city.</P>
<P>        If a doctor came to you with the idea of cutting your face 
off and putting it on the head of your mortal enemy and doing the 
same to your enemy, you'd give the doctor a swift kick to the groin 
followed by the meanest rectal exam ever, right? Not Travolta. He 
sits right down in the chair and lets them cut his distinguished 
features right off his head. A few laser-induced hairline changes and 
one microchip voice implant later, Travolta is Cage and a comatose 
Cage is left faceless in an abandoned hospital.</P>
<P>        The plan is to send Travolta/Cage into prison so he can 
pump Cage's accomplice brother for information about the bomb. 
It doesn't work too well -- oh, he gets the information within a few 
scenes, but prison life is hell for poor John/Nick. He has to wear 
these heavy metallic boots that track his whereabouts at all times, 
take abuse from the Commie guards and get his ass whooped by 
fellow inmates. And, to top it all off, his damn face itches!</P>
<P>        Cue the faceless Cage, who soon wakes up from his coma. 
There's no one guarding him, no one in the entire building in fact, 
and before long, his henchmen have the doctor at gunpoint, forcing 
him to put Travolta's face on his head. Now Cage/Travolta has the 
upper hand, killing the few people who know of Cage/Travolta's 
mission and even showing up at prison to visit Travolta/Cage. It's 
delicious torture watching Travolta/Cage's world fall apart before 
his eyes, playing off the universal fear of being completely alone in a 
situation.</P>
<P>        The movie never stops being fascinating, as T/C tries to 
break out of jail and stop C/T, and C/T assumes Travolta's former 
life as a star agent of the law and a family man. Woo keeps the pace 
moving and gives us plenty of action to boot, but the key to the film 
is in the performances of Travolta and Cage. Cage in the trapped 
Travolta role has to go from psycho to mellow within minutes, but 
it's Travolta's mellow-to-psycho transformation that is the most fun 
to watch. The premise is outrageous, but these actors almost make it 
believable.</P>
