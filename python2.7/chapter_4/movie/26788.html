<P>   Identity crises are the stuff of comedy, as Shakespeare
knew, and while Roger Spottiswoode's "The 6th Day" is not
quite Shakespearean, the identity of its principal figure is
often in question--thereby inspiring both comedic touches and
some dramatic flavor.  Columbia Pictures' logo asks, "Are you
who you think you are?" which is quite a favorable concept
for a story line, but Spottiswoode--who is responsible for the
superior James Bond rouser "Tomorrow Never Dies"--settles
for the most insipid use of the notion with his high-budget
"The 6th Day".  </P>
<P>   Featuring some breathtaking airborne shots of snow-
capped mountains and the downtown skyline of Canada's
most picturesque big city, Vancouver, "The 6th Day" takes us
behind today's headlines into the technology of cloning.  The
picture starts with a reasonably high credibility factor.  We
already know that a sheep named Dolly was actually cloned
by science; that is (correct me if I'm wrong) some DNA
samples from its woolly body were captured, placed in a
Petrie dish, and given the opportunity to duplicate with all the
creature's thoughts, feelings and personality.  Because of
rapid, Dolly-inspired strides now being made in the field,
Spottiswoode situates "The 6th Day" in the year 2005 rather
than in the previously considered 2020, giving us the
conviction that people, too, may actually be duplicated within
a short period of time.  Instead of using the slow process of
allowing a cloned creature to be born and grow naturally,
Cormac and Marianne Wibberley's sceenplay has billionaire
industrialist Drucker (Tony Goldwyn) knocking out human
clones from pre-sculptured models so that his
Frankensteinian doctor, Graham Weir (Robert Duvall), can
simply implant the DNA into the models, allowing them to
spring quickly to mature life.</P>
<P>   The trouble begins when Drucker, believing the owner of a
charter aircraft company, Adam Gibson (Arnold
Schwarzenegger) to be dead, clones the man into an exact
duplicate, so that when Adam returns to his farmhouse he
finds his double kissing his wife and partaking of the birthday
cake which formed the centerpiece of a surprise party.  When
Drucker discovers that Adam is alive and thereby able to
smash his illegal operation, he sends his chief bouncer
Marshall (Michael Rooker) and Marshall's sidekick Talia
(Sarah Wynter) into action to remove the authentic Adam
from the scene.</P>
<P>  In a picture that is full of the sound and fury of seemingly
endless car crashes, the emission of laser guns, and some
predictably generic explosions, the part that offers a modicum
of interest is the comedy.  Adam's comrade-in-flight, Hank
(played by the ubiquitous Michael Rapaport), demonstrates
his affection for women who make no demands by keeping a
state-of-the-art holographic, Stepford-wife bimbo in his
residence, a consort who meets all his needs at her master's
command and disappears instantly when he becomes tired of
her.  Schwarzenegger himself is given some lines that are
humorous by their very clunkiness.  When he breaks the neck
of a villain who has already been killed and cloned several
times, he remarks to himself, "In my day people who were
dead stayed dead."  </P>
<P>   But look at the missed opportunity--what could have been
done when the two Adams finally meet fairly late into the film! 
Each could have affirmed that he was the true Adam (like
George W. Bush's and Al Gore's insistence that "I am the
real president-elect") and could have spent the balance of the
time sorting out their identities.  What's more, we do not get a
sense that Drucker is an entirely evil person whose laboratory
should be destroyed, nor do we see a reason for the
existence of an absolute 6th-day law forbidding human
cloning (the movie's title comes from the Biblical phrase, "On
the Sixth Day God created Man").  Why not simply tweak the
corporation?  Stop its people from killing people and put the
whole operation to use saving the lives of the terminally ill. 
That would be just one suggestion superior to the Luddite
mentality that informs this story.  The film, which suffers from
an endless barrage of noise and effects that have been
cloned over and over from previous movies, could have better
utilized A-1 performers like Robert Duvall and Tony Goldwyn
to be a mind-bending instead of ear-splitting drama.  </P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 90 minutes.  (C) 2000
