<PRE>IN SHORT: Very funny if you're twenty</PRE>
<P>>From the time they were five, Josh (Breckin Meyer) and Tiffany (Rachel
Blanchard) swore undying love. Then college came and they were separated
by 1800 long and lonely miles, he in New York, she in Texas, and one
burning hot telephone line. One day, Tiffany stopped returning calls
and, having aggravated her roommate to death, Josh is told that she
didn't come home the night before. Crushed, Josh falls into the arms of
the very hot for him Beth (Amy Smart) -- actually, he buys her for
twenty six dollars, but that's a whole 'nother story -- and being the
90s kind of guy that he is, gets the entire sordid encounter on
videotape. Beth's idea, for that matter.</P>
<P>It wasn't Josh's idea to send the tape to Tiffany, but that's what
happens and that's what kicks Road Trip into motion. Sure, it's one
boner joke after another with a couple of doobie gags, fat jokes and toe
sucking tossed in to break the monotony of nubile young ladies parading
about starkers on the big screen . . .</P>
<P>Yep, another teenflick. Not as politically incorrect as a Farrelly
Brothers flick. Not as flat out below the belt disgustingly funny as
American Pie, Road Trip nonetheless is consistently funny -- moreso if
you've never seen anything like it before. I have, God knows over the
last twenty years I've seen more than my share, but I can honestly
report that there was a consistent grin plastered to my face. Road Trip
didn't crack the cranky crust as American Pie did, but it was not
unamusing to this fossil.</P>
<P>The story is narrated by campus tour guide Barry (Tom Green), who's made
a full time career out of college life (he's eight years in to his four
year undergrad program). While leading a campus tour, Barry spins his
tale of sex, sex, dope, a snake and a mouse, to the disbelieving ears of
the freshmen to be and their folks. Quite honestly, there's nothing more
to tell you about the story without giving the jokes away. What I will
say is that everything you may have thought about what Tom Green does to
the mouse (as hinted in the previews and teevee spots) is nothing
compared to how sick his character is. It's the one performance that
kept Road Trip interesting for this old fart of a reviewer.</P>
<P>Well, that and Rachel Blanchard with red hair. Someone stuff me in a
freezer until she's my age . . .</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Road Trip, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$5.00</PRE>
<P>'cuz the youth are gonna go and they're gonna take dates. If I was still
tokin' Road Trip would be a rental.</P>
