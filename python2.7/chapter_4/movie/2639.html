<PRE>"That woman is a mockery of her s-e-x."
                        - Plowright on Richardson</PRE>
<P>     WIDOW'S PEAK is a shoddy comedy cum drama about a glamorous
English war widow (Richardson) who wreaks havoc in the humble hamlet of
Kilshannon, a small Irish resort town in the mid 1920's.  Her home is
on a hill--a minor mount called Widows' Peak, where all the residents
are childless and manless.  This maiden mafia is ruled by the blustery
Mrs.  Counihan (Plowright), whose son (Dunbar) is also the pride of the
Peak.  When the war widow sets her sights on the son, she also draws
the attention of the Peaks' strangest spinster, Miss O'Hare (Farrow).
Needless to say, the two commence a-feudin'.</P>
<P>     WIDOW'S PEAK is shoddy.  The dialogue is muted, the direction is
limp, and the music is way too-intrusive. (For a contrast, look at the
clean direction and smooth execution of SPEED.  Different subjects;
same medium.)  The story--written over ten years ago with Mia's mom in
mind--also has problems, notably in the late-in-the-film leap from
comedy to drama.</P>
<P>     The actors are fun, though, and help balance the boredom.
Richardson is great and even manages an accurate American accent.
Plowright is a gas, casually tossing off line after haughty line.
"Enough's enough, we don't want to spoil them!" she tells her fellow
widows, who are tending their husband's graves.  Farrow is fine, but
her character is underwritten.  A loss.  The two prominent
males--Adrian Dunbar and Jim Broadbent--are both good.</P>
