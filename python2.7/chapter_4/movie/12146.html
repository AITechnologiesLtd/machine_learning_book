<PRE>Mary Reilly
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1996 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The Jekyll and Hyde story told from his maid's point of view is, in a word,
"Dark". You wouldn't expect something bright and cheery based on Robert Louis
Stevenson's novel, but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal.</P>
<P>Jekyll/Hyde (John Malkovich) is terminally depressed and desperate. Mary
Reilly (Julia Roberts) is a victim of monstrous child abuse and the anti-woman
sentiment of the times. Director Stephen Fears' version of the London slums
makes us marvel that anyone survived them. The lighting level is exceedingly
low throughout the movie: it almost appears to be filmed in black and white.</P>
<P>The direction and cinematography are brilliant and liquid. Scenes flow into
the next scene like honey oozing off a strawberry. (Except there's no red, of
course.) The look is so moody and melodramatic that you'll be shocked when you
leave the theater. I saw it at a matinee and took quite a while to adjust to
the sunny skies afterward.</P>
<P>Often the Jekyll and Hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person
into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts. Here
the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good, but certainly powerless. His
alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience. Two parts that make up a
whole. Neither are capable of functioning without the other and once
separated, disaster is inevitable.</P>
<P>The differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were
accomplished by demeanor and attitude.  When we finally see the
transformation, the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science
fiction, not the psychological horror that the tale demands.</P>
<P>Roberts and Malkovich are skillful in their roles. Both are suitably
melancholy, fitting in with the rest of the film. The only flash of life and
color comes from Glenn Close (and her lips) as the madam of a whorehouse where
Hyde lives, and surprisingly, Jekyll apparently frequents. Life and color
maybe, but this is not Close's best role. She seems little more than a
cardboard cutout character.</P>
<P>A beautiful film in its own dreary way. You'll appreciate the filmmaking
craft, but don't expect to leave in an upbeat mood.</P>
