<P>   On the day of the New York opening of "Whipped"--
perhaps not coincidentally--New York Times critic Stephen
Holden came out with a think piece entitled "Can Art Cinema
Survive Cruder Times?"  Holden calls art movies a withering
relic, stating that "the...erotic frankness that seemed
revelatory and boundary-breaking to an older generation are
now taken for granted by younger audiences inured to (and
amused by) 'The Jerry Springer Show.'"</P>
<P>   "Whipped" elbows aside even the boundaries bulldozed by
Mr. Springer.  In a movie in which scarcely a minute passes
without the expression of a (once) taboo word or an
illustration of the sex acts embodied by the term, Peter
Cohen's film, which is at its most common downright vulgar
and at best suggestive, is an entertaining frolic, one that does
not stop to catch a breath for its entire eighty-two minutes'
duration.  Yep.  This is a guilty pleasure, one which can't help
inviting some laughs and grins, but which caters to the lowest
common denominator in the audience.  How so?  Instead of
allowing the viewers to extract the motif, or theme of the story
in their own minds, Cohen's narration states--not once, but
twice--"everyone f**** everybody else."  In other words, this
deeply cynical portrayal of humanity calls (mostly) men on the
carpet as Neil LaBute did in "The Company of Men," but does
so without the slightest attempt at subtlety.  And that is the
difference between an electrifying movie like "In the Company
of Men," a work whose low budget does not take away from
its dark view of the male mentality.  LaBute posits two yuppie
office workers who make a pact to date a woman and dump
her after she falls in love with them, allowing the audience to
summon his vision--while "Whipped,"  simply spoon feeds the 
writer-director's derisive dicta to the audience.</P>
<P>   Instead of LaBute's two scheming yuppies, one of whom is
reluctant to go through with his Iago-like pal's plan to mess
up a woman's life, "Whipped" focuses on three, actually four,
comrades who meet regularly at Sunday brunch to discuss
the scams they pulled off successfully on women to seduce
them.  Jonathan (Jonathan Abrahams) look like a post-'50's
beat with his goatee and comes across as the most
responsive one, the one who is not really sure of his charm
or even his sexual orientation.  He hangs out with Zeke
(Zorie Barber), who wears those fashionable, oval-shaped
glasses (which I hate) and with the handsomest of the group,
Brad (Brian Van Holt), who claims to bond with the women he
likes by pretending to know people who are close to them. 
Eric (Judah Domke), the only married guy of the lot, joins
them later, is initially considered an outsider because he is
not expected to tell the down-and-dirty stuff about himself and
his wife, but manages to restore his credentials at these
weekly meetings by doing just that.</P>
<P>   When the three gross-out single guys all wind up dating the
same woman, Mia (Amanda Peet), in a coincidence beyond
the ken of any sensible scripter, they get their comeuppance-
-but only after they have enjoyed the sexually liberated
fellowship of this lovely lass, fall in love with her, and come to
blows (so to speak) in competing for her heart.</P>
<P>   Writer-director Peter M. Cohen may be demonstrating his
philosophy, that men and women are both vicious beasts--no,
as stated before, he actually expresses his motif straight on--
or he may simply be feigning a dark, dark view of humanity to
make a few bucks on his film.  Credit the man with the ability
to write snappy, zappy lines that resound across the screen
with the speed of an Uzi.  Still, his real cynicism could be his
view that no audience is intelligent enough to fathom a film of
any appreciable subtlety.</P>
