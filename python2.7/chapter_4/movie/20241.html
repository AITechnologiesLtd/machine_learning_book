<PRE>THE MINUS MAN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>With just the sort of script that Hitchcock would have been drawn to,
THE MINUS MAN features everyday people who aren't always quite what they
seem. Full of small twists and subplots, the deliciously diabolical
drama stars Owen Wilson as Vann Siegert, a likeable all-American boy
type, who has just one tiny flaw -- he's a serial killer.</P>
<P>Vann, a deranged young adult, is really a sweet blonde with a strong
moral code, just not a normal one. "Never done anything violent to
anyone," he explains. His MO is to put fast-acting poison in
sweet-tasting liquor, which he keeps in a little flask. When his
intended victim notices the booze, he generously offers them a swig --
"to put them to sleep."</P>
<P>The story is told in voice-over from the perspective of the killer, who
shares his thoughts on his motivations and techniques. ("I take the
natural momentum of a person and draw it toward me." "I never make a
plan. Like a comet shooting across the sky. You never know where it'll
land.")</P>
<P>Written and directed by Hampton Fancher, the co-writer of BLADE RUNNER,
THE MINUS MAN should get bonus points for its trailer. In an age in
which studios think that audiences will not see a movie unless the
entire plot is revealed in the trailers, THE MINUS MAN dares to have a
trailer that features not a single clip from the film. All you see in it
are two fictional people leaving the movie, arguing about it.</P>
<P>A meticulous and delicate little mystery and thriller, THE MINUS MAN can
be thought of as the anti-SCREAM -- low on gore, as if the killer
himself made the movie. He's a gentle soul, who wouldn't want to disturb
the audience.</P>
<P>Vann is a loner who drives a pickup along small country roads until he,
uncharacteristically, settles in a small town for a while. He takes a
room in the house of a middle-aged couple named Jane (Mercedes Ruehl)
and Doug (Brian Cox). Supposedly, their daughter, who's off to college
now, used to sleep in the bedroom that they are renting. Like most of
the story, everything is suspect. Jane, for example, has a sullen look,
and her sunken eyes seem to be hiding something. Quirky Doug is a
conundrum. One night, he comes in beaten up. Who did it? A stranger in a
bar? Jane? Vann? Or maybe, Doug himself? Some of the story's puzzles are
immediately solved while others fester.</P>
<P>Vann quickly becomes ingrained into Jane and Doug's Rockwellian town. He
even gets himself a girlfriend at the local Post Office where he finds a
job sorting mail. In a surprisingly sunny performance, Janeane Garofalo
plays his girlfriend without a hint of her signature sarcasm. Showing a
naïve and playfully alluring side rarely seen, Garofalo proves that the
studios may have incorrectly pigeonholed her.</P>
<P>Hitchcock understood the power of humor, something THE MINUS MAN could
have used more often. When he tries, Fancher is able to enliven his
movie with carefully chosen comic situations. "I look harder than
anybody," Vann says in a wryly-funny scene, as he participates in a
large search for a guy that he has killed. "I look so hard,  I forget
there's nothing to find." He knows the body isn't buried in these woods,
but he searches diligently nevertheless.</P>
<P>Bobby Bukowski's intimately lit cinematography, full of close-ups, gives
the striking picture a realism and an immediacy. Although the film's
deliberately slow pacing will undoubtedly irritate some, the director's
style is more mesmerizing than soporific. With Fancher averaging about a
script a decade, one would hope that this film will boost his cachet in
Hollywood and he will be sought out more often.</P>
<P>THE MINUS MAN runs 1:45. It is rated R for language and a scene of drug
use and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
