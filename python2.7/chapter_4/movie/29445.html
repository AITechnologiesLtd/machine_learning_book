<P>   Americans are taking more meals outside of their homes than
ever before.  One out of five of us goes to McDonald's at least
once a week.  But these statistics do not mean that Americans
are rushing to the elite dining halls that charge over $100 per
feeding.  After you see Bob Giraldi's "Dinner Rush," written by
Brian S. Kalata and Rick Shaughnessy, you could go one of two
ways.  Either your mouth will water so much from the marvelous
exhibition of foods in the kitchen of a Tribeca establishment or
you'll be convinced that these overpriced mess halls are nothing
but palaces of snobbery and pretention.  Most likely both.  As
director Giraldi ("Hiding Out" plus a number of commercial videos)
perceives the scene, there's considerable drama going on in the
kitchen, which employs an army of chefs, salad makers, and
dessert people; there's tension in the back table of the
establishment (actually filmed in Gigino's in New York's chic
Tribeca area), as owner Louis (Danny Aiello) discusses business
with his accountant (John Rothman); and there's tension in the
main areas of the restaurant as waitresses are both hit on and
dissed, gangsters ply their trade in the balcony, and diners ooh
and ahh over the expensive cuisine they are served--if indeed they
can even get past the maitress d', Nicole (Vivian Wu).</P>
<P>   If you went to a place like Gigino and looked around without
listening to what the denizens are discussing, you'd imagine that
these are people out for a good meal, perhaps to discuss some
Wall Street deals, maybe a few bosses plying drinks into their
nubile secretaries.  On the evening of Giraldi's activities, however,
there's finagling on all levels of Gigino's that could be the subject
of a Robert Altman movie and, in effect, "The Dinner Rush" is
dished out to us as the great Mr. Altman might do.</P>
<P>   The first conflict is between owner Louis and his son, head chef
Udo (Edoardo Ballerini).  The young man will not be satisfied until
his dad makes him an equal partner, but Louis is stringing the kid
along.  The second involves a pathological gambler, Duncan (Kirk
Acevedo), who is in debt to the mob and who is being pursued by
two low-level gangsters who have been invited to the restaurant by
the owner--who has a soft spot in his heart for Duncan because
that young man is able to cook real, traditional Italian food for him
rather than the "phony" nouvelle cuisine favored by his son and by
the critics.  Yet a third involves a myriad of conversations among
the patrons and waiters, with art critic Fitzgerald (Mark Margolis)
insulting the work decorating walls which happened to have been
painted by his server, Marti (Summer Phoenix).</P>
<P>   Giraldi wisely avoids a conventional, tightly woven narrative tale
in favor of a looser structure, setting cameraman Tim Ives from
table to table, from bathroom to back room, giving us a pointillist's
point of view of what really goes on in those chic places that
people patronize not so much for the food as for the show.  In fact
one patron (John Corbett) muses from the bar, "When did eating
out become a Broadway show?"  The employees are all good
people despite their neuroses but the patrons are, almost to a
fault, gleefully obnoxious--providing much of the laughs of this
comic melodrama.  Sandra Bernhard does a particularly witty turn
as a cynical, seen-it-all restaurant critic who is given a surprise
dish of a lobster, standing tall in on tail, embracing a shock of fried
pasta in its bosom.    </P>
<P>   While the melodramatic conclusion is a break from the patina of
palaver, the hum that patrons love when they go out to eat, it is
right in tune with the themes du jour, bookending the plot that
begins with a shocking opener.  All in all, though some who have
seen the movie before advised me to make sure to have a good
meal before attending, I probably would have been as
disappointed with the nouvelle food being served at probably
outrageous prices as I was charmed by the wit and wisdom of the
film.  Surprisingly, Bob Giraldi, though considered a new director--
who had his film exhibited as such in the New Directors/New
Films series of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and of New
York's MOMA--turns out some cinema as tempting and delicious
as the prize creation of a master chef de cuisine.</P>
