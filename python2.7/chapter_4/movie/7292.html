<PRE>                                CITIZEN RUTH
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     "Huffer" Ruth Stoops has a big problem.  The judge has sent her to
substance abuse programs many times for sniffing everything from model
glue to brake fluid.  Now she has been caught again, and this time she
is pregnant.  The judge has had it with her.  She has already had four
kids taken from her, although she disputes the exact number taken
because she was an unfit mother, so the judge wants to try her for
felony criminal endangerment of the fetus in her womb.</P>
<P>     CITIZEN RUTH has the audacity to skewer both sides of the most
controversial issue in America today -- abortion.  The judge takes Ruth
aside and hints that, if she gets an abortion, he will not bring her to
trial.  The local anti-abortion group hears this and takes Ruth in.
They figure that the judge's twisted logic of kill the fetus through an
abortion or I will try you for abusing the fetus will turn the case
into a cause celebre, which it does.</P>
<P>     Laura Dern, acting for just union scale wages, gives a brilliant
and unflinching performance in a totally unsympathetic role.  If you've
never seen a spray paint can sniffer in action -- I hadn't -- then you
have no idea how gross it can be.  The script by first-time
screenwriters Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor never tries to gloss over
her actions or give her some big redemptive scene.  Throughout the
show, bathrooms pose a special danger for Ruth since she finds good
sniffing material in bathroom cleaning supplies.  Her serious role is
the fulcrum that supports the rest of the characters, who are drawn so
broadly that they become delicious parodies.</P>
<P>     So, you ask, can they form a compelling story out of this?  The
tug of war over the baby in Ruth's body becomes the basis of a comedy
that works surprisingly well.  First-time director Alexander Payne, one
of the co-writers, has a deft sense of how to balance the serious with
the comedy and balance the goring of both sides of the political
debate.  I was at a special screening of the film at which the film's
editor Kevin Tent spoke.  He said that although he believes the film
does not favor either side, many people with strong views pro or con on
abortion believe that it favors their own camp.</P>
<P>     Like prize fighters in a ring, we have the two sides, each of
which house Ruth at various times in the story.  In one corner is the
pro-life organization called the "Baby Savers."  The Stoney family runs
the local chapter of the organization.  Kurtwood Smith is hilarious as
the supercilious father and hardware store worker Norm Stoney.  He has
his flaws, including a roving eye toward Ruth.  Mary Kay Place does the
part of his middle-class wife Gail.  Gail wants Ruth to know that they
love her but that she must not sit on the chairs in the living room.
It just isn't done.</P>
<P>     The rest of the Stoney family includes a perfect eight year old
named Matthew (Sebastian Anzaldo III) and a completely rebellious
teenager named Cheryl (Alicia Witt).  While the Stoney family wears
their Christian values on their sleeves, Cheryl sneaks out to do drugs
and smuggles boys in her room for sex.  Her parents seem oblivious to
the problems under their own roof as they try to repair the problems of
the rest of the world.</P>
<P>     Outside an abortion clinic, Gail alternates between eating honey
glazed donuts and screaming "baby killer" at the arriving cars.  Other
anti-abortion activists are more articulate.  "It's just a business to
them," one Vietnam vet explains to Ruth.  "Four or five hundred bucks a
pop.  It's just contract killing."</P>
<P>     Just as soon as some in the audience gets riled up over the unfair
portrayal of the pro-life faction, the pro-choice group appears in the
other corner of the ring to get their taking down by the script.
Swoosie Kurtz plays Diane, the leader of the local chapter, who starts
the film as a spy deep in the Baby Savers group.  Diane's unabashed
lesbianism does not shock Ruth, but how little Diane ends up caring for
Ruth does.  Soon Ruth comes to realize that her body represents no more
than a small battleground in a larger war.  M. C. Gainey plays a Hells
Angel type pro-choicer named Harlan who surrounds Diane's house with
his buddies to guard Ruth like a prisoner.</P>
<P>     Both sides call in their big battleships -- their respective
national leaders.  Amazingly, Burt Reynolds is fairly good as Blaine
Gibbons, the Bible-toting national leader of the Baby Savers.  (I have
a rule, most recently validated by the turkey known as STRIPTEASE, to
avoid all Burt Reynolds films as completely hopeless.  Here Reynolds
displays some long hidden talent.)  Tippi Hedren (THE BIRDS) gives a
cameo role as Jessica Weiss, the head of the national pro-choice group.</P>
<P>     When Ruth's rock tape gets busted, she steals the only tape she
can find -- an investment strategy tape by someone named Larry Jarvick.
"...keep the chart handy as we figure the capitalization effect on your
assets," advises Larry.  Like someone listening to ancient Sanskrit,
Ruth becomes increasingly fascinated by its incomprehensible mantra.</P>
<P>     In the best scene in the show, Ruth goes wild inside Diane's house
when the Baby Savers announce on television that they will pay her
$15,000 to have the baby.  Hosanna, her ship has finally come in.  Not
having ten dollars to her name, she feels like she has won the lottery.
Her "friends" in the house cannot fathom her happiness so they explain
to her why she can't have the money.  To this Ruth moans, "Why can't I
ever have what I want?"  And later, "my body belongs to me!"  Soon the
inevitable bidding war will begin.  Nevertheless, the show is resolved
in a fresh and pleasantly surprising ending.</P>
<P>     After the screening, editor Kevin Tent stayed and answered some
questions.  The first was about the film's distribution problems.
CITIZEN RUTH opened last year to almost uniformly glowing reviews.
Even so, Miramax never put it into general release.  One member of the
audience speculated that perhaps the film was considered a hot potato
since it poked fun at so many groups.</P>
<P>     Tent went on to talk about the editing of the picture.  He said
that he was surprised at the casting of Kurtwood Smith as the father
since he usually plays a heartless bad guy.  Smith ended up being so
funny that they had to edit out a lot of his scenes to keep the movie
from going overboard.</P>
<P>     The other tidbit he gave was that originally there was an
additional ending added after the film's current ending.  All during
the show, Ruth kept wanting to watch TV, but was never allowed to.
Some of the scenes were left on the cutting room floor, but a few of
them made it into the final print.  In the additional ending that was
cut, Ruth goes to a video store full of monitors all covering the
controversy surrounding her.  She switches them off and turns to a soap
opera.  As the film ends, she is in bliss.</P>
<P>     Tent says the role of the editor and director is that of
hypnotists.  They must keep the audience in control and never lose them
by letting scenes run on too long.  Well, he and Payne certainly
hypnotized and mesmerized our audience with their delightful and
insightful black comedy.</P>
<P>     CITIZEN RUTH runs 1:44.  It is rated R for drug usage and some
profanity.  It would be fine for older teenagers.  I recommend the film
to you and give it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
