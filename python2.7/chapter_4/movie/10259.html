<P>There have been a few sequels that were as good as, or better than, the 
originals. "Godfather 2", "Terminator 2: Judgement Day", "Aliens", and 
the even numbered "Star Trek" films come to mind. "Speed 2: Cruise 
Control" doesn't. Listening to the audience as they left an advance 
screening of the film, the most frequent comment heard was "that was cute.
" Be honest, are you really interested in a big action-packed summer 
thrill-ride film that can be summed up as "cute?" </P>
<P>While it's doubtful that the original "Speed" will ever go down as a 
cinematic landmark, the film was both a fine showcase for Sandra 
Bullock's charm and an efficient little thriller. A big part of "Speed's" 
success came from the simplicity of the storyline. If the bus drops below 
50 mph, it will blow up, so we have to keep going 50, but we're running 
out of road. A simple conceit that confined the action to a set space and 
focused on the people involved in the situation. During the quiet moments 
of the ride, we were able to enjoy the chemistry between Bullock and 
Keanu Reeves.  </P>
<P>"Speed 2" lacks both the chemistry and efficiency of the original. 
Desperate to establish action-movie momentum quickly, director Jan De 
Bont ("Speed", "Twister") keeps the cameras jiggling from the second the 
film begins. Even during the subdued moments, the camera whooshes around 
as if the Tasmanian Devil was filming the story. The movie starts with a 
comic scene of Bullock taking a driving lesson from instructor Tim Conway.
 She jerks the vehicle through traffic as if she was in a high-speed 
chase, while Conway whimpers and cringes. The bit works on a primitive 
sit-com level, but undermines Bullock's character, making her look like 
some half-witted loon. </P>
<P>She soon hooks up with her new boyfriend, an L.A.P.D. SWAT team member, 
who invites her to take a cruise with him. The two leave L.A. for a 
relaxing Caribbean cruise on the Seabourn Legend.
As the handsome young couple gets acclimated to the ship, you wait to see 
the sparks ignite between them, but it doesn't happen. Jason Patric, who 
played the older brother in "The Lost Boys", is a fine actor renown for 
his intensity. It's in full flower here, as he searches with deadly 
earnestness for the right moment to propose marriage to Bullock. The 
moment doesn't come, as Bullock, determined to take things slow, plays 
her scenes in an odd, distracted fashion. During their romantic 
interludes, she looks as if something really interesting is happened just 
on the other side of the camera. There is absolutely no chemistry between 
the pair.</P>
<P>Of course, all hell breaks loose in short order, as Willem Dafoe, a 
disgruntled ex-employee of the cruise line, takes control of the ship's 
computers. He fakes a series of fires to force evacuation of the ship, 
then standard-issue action movie mayhem ensues. Dafoe is another of 
"Speed 2's" problems. Films like this work best with a memorable villain 
and Dafoe is eminently forgettable. He tries; giggling, twitching, and 
wrenching his eyes into a Charles Manson psychotic gleam, but overall the 
effect is silly, not menacing. "Speed 2" should have borrowed a villain 
from the "Con Air" prison transport plane – they had enough bad guys to 
float a loaner.</P>
<P>As the shipboard action erupts, so do several annoying movie clichés. 
First off, the entire crew of the ship has no idea what to do in an 
emergency. Thank God they had two plucky tourists to take command of the 
situation! Second, the curse of the talking villain strikes as Dafoe 
skips at least a half dozen opportunities to shoot our heroes, choosing 
instead to talk to them at great length, explaining his motivations and 
evil intentions, while giving them time to regroup. Finally, the helpless 
victim syndrome hits as Bullock is taken hostage by Dafoe and doesn't 
escape. Oh sure, she howls, threatens and swings at him periodically, but 
she stays by his side, skipping painfully obvious chances to get away.</P>
<P>"Speed 2" isn't all bad. A number of the action scenes are effective, and 
the film's nods to other movies and TV shows, particularly "The Love 
Boat" and "The Poseidon Adventure" are amusing ("Twister" fans should 
watch the skies for a brief bovine appearance during an explosion. ) 
That's about all the fun there is, though. The producers of "Speed 2" 
should savor their opening weekend receipts, because as soon as word of 
mouth (and this Friday's release of "Batman And Robin") gets around, this 
seaboard mish-mash of missed opportunities should sink like a stone. </P>
