<PRE>"Last Resort"</PRE>
<P>Tanya (Dina Korzun) is a pretty Russian émigré who came to England with her
10-year old son, Artiom (Artiom Strelnikov) on the promise of marriage to a
British citizen. She is shocked to learn that her would be fiancé has
stranded her and the boy and a happy life in London is nothing but a
vanished dream. She and Artiom find themselves stuck in a desolate holding
center for refugees with no passport, no money and no rights in "Last
Resort."</P>
<P>Documentary filmmaker Pawel Pawlikowski makes his first inroad into feature
length fiction with a tale (co-written by Rowan Joffe) about a naïve young
mother who digs up her Moscow roots with the hope of planting them in
prosperous London. Tanya's plans are dashed at the outset, when stranded by
the unseen fiancé, and she and Artiom are left in the hands of the
immigration authorities. She seeks asylum in England, not knowing it means
internment in the rundown, former resort town of Stonehaven - for 12 to 16
months!</P>
<P>Alfie (Paddy Considine), an ex-con who runs the local video arcade, takes a
liking to Tanya and Artiom and helps them out with food, a TV and
friendship. He even fixes up their dreary flat with a lick of paint here
and there. But, it is obvious to Alfie that the penniless woman is
desperate to break out of her prison and escape her humiliation. When Tanya
agrees to take a job with a cyberspace pornographer named Les (Britain's
most famous real life porno king, Lindsay Honey), Alfie realizes this as a
frantic cry for help. He makes it his mission to help Tanya and Artiom
escape, even as he falls in love with the pretty Russian.</P>
<P>"Last Resort" is a little gem of a movie that captures a world not known to
most - a refugee-inhabited land without hope of escape from its daily,
desolate grind. But, this setting is a backdrop for the real tale about
Tanya and Artiom and the misguided naivete that lands them in the bleak
gray hell of Stonehaven. When Alfie comes into their life, things change
for the better, but a prison is still a prison and escape is her only hope.</P>
<P>Dina Korzun, who looks like a Slavic Emily Watson, is perfect as Tanya. She
is protective of her son, but is at the mercy of the authorities that
interned her. Her one failed escape attempt is met with the threat of real
incarceration, driving Tanya to even deeper frustration. Korzun gives a
subtle performance as she realizes that her choices have put her and Artiom
in such dire straits. Complementing Korzun is a truly likable performance
by Paddy Considine as Alfie. The affection he feels for Tanya and Artiom is
palpable and naturally rendered. Young Artiom Strelnikov makes an
impressive debut as the savvy son with his own share of problems coping
with the situation.</P>
<P>Helmer Pawlikowski, using a combination of static and hand held camera (by
lenser Ryszard Lenczewski), creates a vision that is both cold and
intimate. The backdrop of Stonehaven depicts a bleak, unforgiving world
where security surveillance camera monitor every corner of the confined
world, making escape near impossible. This changes when the film
concentrates on the three principles and takes on a warmth that reflects
the trio's respective feelings and mood. All in all, "Last Resort" is a
little treat of a quality film at a time when Hollywood is releasing mostly
dreck.</P>
<PRE>I give it a B+.</PRE>
