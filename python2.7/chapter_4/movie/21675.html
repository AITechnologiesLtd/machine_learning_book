<P>Mansfield Park isn't a great movie.  Heck, it may not even be a good
movie.  It's the kind of period romance picture where you can tell who
each character will end up with romantically after about ten minutes.
The premise – a young girl uprooted from her impoverished family to live
with wealthy relatives - sounds like a bad Cinderella knock-off.  Yet
somehow, despite this, Park is damn entertaining.</P>
<P>How could something so predictable be so enjoyable?  For starters, the
film is based on a novel written by Jane Austen, the most consistent and
prolific writer of romantic comedies in the late 1990s.  Which is pretty
sad since she's been dead for almost 200 years.  Think about it – she
published four books when she was alive and their big screen adaptations
this decade have resulted in an Oscar and Writers Guild Award (Sense and
Sensibility), a Writers Guild nomination (Emma), a National Society of
Film Critics Award (Clueless, which was based on Emma) and an Emmy
nomination (Pride and Prejudice).  And not only is the film based on
Austen's 1814 novel, but also on her personal letters and journals,
which renders the film a bit more autobiographical than the book.</P>
<P>In the film, a ten-year-old girl named Fanny Price (Hannah
Taylor-Gordon, Jakob the Liar) is sent to Mansfield Park, her Aunt
Bertram's wealthy estate in Northamptonshire.  Fanny thinks the move
from her family's hovel in Portsmouth is temporary, but she quickly
learns otherwise.  Although she is treated like an unwanted stepchild
(especially by her snooty cousins Julia and Maria), Fanny is a gracious
guest during her stay at Mansfield.  She passes the time writing her
younger sister with creatively outlandish stories of her new
surroundings and new family.  She reads the letters –presumably Austen's
letters - directly into the camera.  Fanny also finds comfort in her
cousin Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller, Plunkett & Macleane), who is sharp
enough to overlook the differences in their social status.</P>
<P>Years later, an older Fanny (Frances O'Connor, Kiss or Kill) has
accepted her place in the Bertram caste system.  She's content to be in
the presence of her kin and guests, but is relegated to the background
of most societal functions.  But Mansfield Park is thrown into upheaval
when a brother/sister team hit the local scene.  Londoner Mary Crawford
(Embeth Davidtz, The Gingerbread Man) is a gossipy meddler that
recognizes Fanny as a bright young woman, declaring that she has a
`tongue sharper than a guillotine.'  Brother Henry Crawford (Alessandro
Nivola, Face/Off) is instantly smitten with Fanny, who must choose
between a superficial marriage that will secure both her social status
and the family's name, and an unlikely romance with the uninterested
Edmund, who wants to be a clergyman.</P>
<P>Directed and adapted by Patricia Rozema (When Night is Falling), Park
looks great and is lensed by Michael Coulter (Sense and Sensibility).
The art and production teams are led by Velvet Goldmine vets Andrew
Munro and Christopher Hobbs.  Of other note is the performance of
Lindsay Duncan (An Ideal Husband), who plays both Fanny's mother and
Lady Bertram.  Rozema's careful direction almost explains away the
predictability of the film by having Fanny deliver a nifty monologue
(directly into the camera again), saying `It could have turned out
differently – but it didn't.'  I guess we'll have to wait for the
Mansfield South Park spoof.  Or the big screen version of Austen's
posthumously published Northanger Abbey, which is set to star Rachel
Leigh Cook.</P>
