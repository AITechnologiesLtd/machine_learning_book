<PRE>                            DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST
                       A film review by Daniel Barrett
                        Copyright 1992 Daniel Barrett</PRE>
<P>     My wife and I saw DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST this weekend, mainly on the
strength of a previous review in this newsgroup (#1377).  The reviewer
called this "one of the best movies I have seen in years -- maybe the
best."  Well, here's a contrasting point of view:  DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST
was the *worst* movie we have seen in a long time!</P>
<P>     The "story," if you can call it that, focuses on a black family in
1902.  The people are preparing to leave their life on an isolated
island and travel north to join mainstream society.  The central theme
is that of "old versus new": the old traditions of the African
ancestors versus the new culture of the modern (read: white) world.
Various members of the family deal with this dichotomy throughout the
movie.</P>
<P>     With this much information, you essentially know the whole plot.
The "old versus new" theme is systematically beaten to death over a two-
hour period.  The characters are flat and develop little if at all.
Various subplots surface but go nowhere.  For example, early in the
movie, we watch a secret love note get delivered by a Native American to
one of the black daughters.  The Native American and the love affair are
barely mentioned for the rest of the movie, until he rides in at the
end.  As another example, there's the mysterious pregnancy of a central
character, and her husband's anger over not knowing whether or not he is
the father.  Virtually every scene involving this subplot is identical
-- the husband mopes around, gets angry, etc.  So many missed
opportunities....</P>
<P>     The movie's major flaw is that the dialogue is not understandable.
Although everything is spoken in English, it is an unfamiliar dialect
that was 75% unintelligible to us.  This is unforgivable in a modern
movie, and very naive on the director's part.  You can't expect people
to appreciate a movie if they can't understand the words.  This was
particularly pathetic during the climax, in which one of the family
members delivers an impassioned five-minute speech while the others are
held in rapt attention.  We couldn't understand a word of it.</P>
<P>     A second flaw is that some parts of the movie are unnecessarily
obscure.  For example, a central character, "Yellow Mary," is constantly
accompanied by a white woman.  During the movie, this companion laughs,
smirks, runs on the beach, and very occasionally utters a word or two.
Her presence, as far as we could tell, is completely unexplained.</P>
<P>     There are a few aspects of the movie that were adequate.  The
overall "feel" of the unity of the island family was well-communicated.
The hired photographer (making a record of the family's last days on the
island) was an enjoyable character.  And the island photography was
above average.  Finally, I suspect that people who are already involved
in this particular area of Black history might find other enjoyment in
the film.</P>
<P>     My wife and I love "art" films and non-mainstream movies, but this
one was poorly directed and quite boring.  DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST is a
dud.</P>
