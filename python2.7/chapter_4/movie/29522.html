<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A Roger Corman produced film that is a bookish adaptation from an H. P.
Lovecraft antiquarian occult work. It maintains the eerie atmosphere by getting
into the strange rituals and manifestations required from such a look at the
dark side, but fails to prove enlightening and is uneven in its presentation as
the ending allows the film to go up in a puff of hokey smoke (Stockwell and
Begley oppose each other offering up their curses in an undeciferable language,
until the evil Stockwell gets struck by lightning). But this version attempted
by director Daniel Haller (Monster of Terror), is much better at getting at the
freakish meaning of Lovecraft than his previous film. That doesn't mean this
film is good, just that it's better than the other version. </P>
<P>Sandra Dee was ineffective in her role as the victim of a fertility sacrifice,
as she brought no depth or spark to a role she was miscast for. While the
brooding Dean Stockwell seemed right at home with all the weirdness his role
called for as a warlock, yet he gave a boring performance as if he was drugged
and reduced to speak in a monotone voice throughout. The strength of the film,
is that it brings in the so-called normal people in the sleepy country town as a
contrast to Stockwell's creepy family and their strange lifestyle, allowing the
film to build on its tension before Begley saves the world. </P>
<P>A young man, Wilbur Whateley (Dean Stockwell), enters the university library and
requests reading the rare and valuable occult book, Necronomicon (Book of the
Dead), just placed under a locked case and not allowed to be removed by the
public. One of the student librarians, Elizabeth Hamilton (Baccala), refuses his
request, but the other librarian, Nancy Walker (Sandra Dee), allows him to read
the book. Liz calls up a philosophy professor and an expert on the occult, an
opposer of the warlock Whateley family, Dr. Henry Armitage (Ed Begley Sr., his
final role), to come and retrieve the tome. He wrote a treatise exposing the
dark aims of Wilbur's great-grandfather Oliver. </P>
<P>Oliver was lynched by the New England town because of his strange beliefs that
an earlier race of man, the "Old Ones," were superior beings from a different
dimension and by using the right chants and going through a fertility rite, he
hopes to conjure up that race to return and destroy present mankind. In his
attempt to do that he picked the wrong woman, Lavinia (Wilbur's mom), as she
resisted and ended up in a mental ward. </P>
<P>Armitage meets with Wilbur and refuses to allow him to borrow the book, but
Nancy is attracted to him and gives him a ride back to the small-town of Dunwich
that is hostile to his eccentric family. Here she meets his strange looking
grandfather (Jaffe), who wants her to leave because there have never been guests
in the house before. He carries around with him a staff with magical symbols on
it. There's also a secret room kept locked where Wilbur's twin brother, who was
supposed to be dead, is kept as an evil spirit since he is caught in the world
between the living and the dead. The father of the twins was never listed, but
is supposed to be not of this earth, with Wilbur's twin resembling the father.</P>
<P>When Nancy arrives at his creepy home, he disables her car so she can't leave
and spikes her tea with a drug so she has psychedelic dreams. The next day he
talks to her about sex. He plans to use her in an occult fertility rite at a
nearby hill called the Devil's Hopyard, as he believes he can accomplish what
Oliver couldn't because he has chosen the right woman. But the evil twin gets
out of his locked room when a visitor looking for Nancy makes the deadly mistake
of opening it and gets eaten by the hungry spirit, who escapes to chow down on
some of the other locals who were hostile to the Whateleys. </P>
<P>All the chills come from the sounds of an evil wind, the curdling sound of birds
eerily singing at the sign of death, the sounds of water splashing, heart's
thumping, and of the earth darkening as a shadow covers it. What failed to work,
was when Haller tried to reduce the visions to some chaotically contrived
psychedelic effects. The film should be more interesting for Lovecraft fans than
to the general audience. I found it, for the most part, to be dull and
uninspiring. </P>
