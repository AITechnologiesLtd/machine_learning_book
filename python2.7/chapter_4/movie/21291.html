<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Talk about false advertising.  The trailer for Palmetto tries to sell it
as a sexy thriller.  Strange, because there wasn't any sex and it wasn't
very thrilling.</P>
<P>Woody Harrelson stars as Harry Barber (insert dick joke here), a
ex-journalist currently serving a four years for exposing some sort of
corruption in the sleepy Florida town of Palmetto.  Harry is freed two
years into his sentence after someone turns state's evidence.  Bitter
and resentful of his incarceration, Harry plans to head as far away from
Palmetto as possible.</P>
<P>He sticks to his plan for all of two minutes, when ex-girlfriend Nina
(Gina Gershon) meets Harry just after his prison release.  The romance
is quickly rekindled, but strangely not shown to the viewers.  He starts
to look for work the next day, but finds nothing suitable until he falls
into the insipid plot line.  The plot-line with no sex.</P>
<P>While sitting in a bar and ordering bourbon that he smells but never
drinks, Harry eyes a curvy stranger using the phone.  The dame is Rhea
Malroux (Elisabeth Shue, The Saint), wife of the richest old guy with
terminal lung cancer in town and she offers Harry a mysterious one-time
high-paying job.  They agree to meet at a bungalow on the outskirts of
town to discuss the position further.</P>
<P>At the bungalow, Rhea reveals a plan to extort money from her rich
husband.  Her stepdaughter Odette (Chloe Sevigny, Gummo) will pretend to
be the victim of a kidnapping with the $500,000 ransom payable them
both.  Harry would clear ten percent for simply writing the ransom note
and collecting the cash.  Using the popular `Are you wearing a wire?
Let me frisk you to be good and sure' ploy to cop a feel, Harry seals
the deal with some steamy, but again unshown sex.</P>
<P>Predictably, once the plan is in place, things fall apart for Harry.  He
has fallen right into somebody's trap, but has no idea whom.  Leaving a
laughably unmistakable trail of clues that makes the Brown-Goldman
murder scene seem sterile, Harry tries to right each wrong that he
finds, but only manages to fall deeper and deeper into the scam.  How
this guy was smart enough to unmask corruption as a reporter, I will
never know.</P>
<P>There are some pretty cool twists in the last twenty minutes or so, but
I was so bored by that point that it hardly seemed to matter.  Director
Volker Schlondorff (The Handmaid's Tale) presents the story with all of
the emotion of a cold heartless German.  As a side note, Volker
Schlondorff was going to be my stage name if I ever decided to go into
porn.</P>
<P>Harrelson plays the slow-witted Harry not unlike each of his previous
film characters.  The unique casting of Shue as the naughty seductive
bombshell and Gershon as the steady vulnerable girlfriend seems reversed
from their norm, which is not necessarily a good thing.  Sevigny and the
oddly subdued Michael Rapaport stand out in supporting roles.  Did I
mention that there was no sex?</P>
<P>I wasn't going to bring this up, but if I had just gotten released from
prison and had Gina Gershon as an eager girlfriend, I would not have had
time to get wrapped up in a bad mystery like this.  I'd be too busy
getting what this move promised, but never delivered.</P>
