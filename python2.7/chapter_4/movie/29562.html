<PRE>FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>1990s saw great renaissance of British cinema. After many
years of stagnation appeared whole new generation of
talented filmmakers, able not only to create new,
interesting films that would enchant the critical
establishment, but also to get in touch with tastes of
general audience. The latter phenomenon could be seen in the
series of British comedies that proved to be better, and in
some cases even more popular and commercially successful
than their Hollywood counterparts. One of them was FOUR
WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, directed in 1994 by Mike Newell,
immensely popular film that even competed for Academy
Awards.</P>
<P>The script by Richard Curtis (best known for his excellent
work on BLACK ADDER television series) lacks the plot in
usual sense. It is composed of the scenes that show the
circle of friends - all 30-something mid-to-upper class
Britons - gathering on each other's weddings. The only one
who still hasn't tied the knot is Charles (played by Hugh
Grant), self-confessed "serial monogamist" who simply
doesn't believe that he would ever end his bachelor
lifestyle. However, everything changes when he meets Carrie
(played by Andie MacDowell), fashion editor from USA.
However, long time is about to pass before two of them
realise that they are made for each other.</P>
<P>Success of FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL is hard to explain at
first glance. The plot is not very solid, the length of two
hours seems a bit much for this kind of movie, and, finally,
the gags in this film are funny, but not exactly hilarious
(and that includes wedding scene scene in which famous
comedian Rowan Atkinson plays inexperienced priest). On the
other hand, director Newell had a good fortune to have a
truly stellar cast at his disposal, and that was essential
for the film which is character-driven instead of
plot-driven. Although Hugh Grant plays more-or-less the same
character he had played before (in SIRENS and BITTER MOON)
and would play again (in NOTTING HILL and countless other
comedies), his performance still carries the film. His
colleagues are equally impressive - Kristin Scott-Thomas is
very effective in her role, Simon Callow is excellent as
Charles' larger-than-life gay friend Gareth, while John
Hannah as Gareth's lover Matthew brings pathos in a powerful
scene that prevented this film from turning into
conventional Hollywood-style romantic comedy. Andie
MacDowell, although manages the role of Carrie very well, is
overshadowed by her British colleagues. FOUR WEDDINGS AND A
FUNERAL, with good acting, solid humour and adequate
proportion of crying and laughing, is nevertheless a very
good viewing experience and it could serve as a good
explanation why British romantic comedies became so popular
in the last decade.</P>
