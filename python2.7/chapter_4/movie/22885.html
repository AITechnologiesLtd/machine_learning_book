<P>Isn't She Great? No. Good? Nah. Mediocre? Not exactly. Borderline awful? 
Bingo.</P>
<P>Disclosure: I have neither read nor seen Valley of the Dolls, the book 
which made Jacqueline Susann famously trashy. Going into this movie, 
which is a many-liberties-taken adaptation of her biography, I had 
absolutely no intentions of checking out the sleazy novel or film 
anytime soon. The movie/book have now skyrocketed to the top of 
must-see/must-read list. That is the peculiar thing about Isn't She 
Great: the movie, atrocious as it is, makes you thrive its coveted 
subject material. Don't credit the film. Credit Susann.</P>
<P>Jacqueline Susann (Bette Midler) is a New York Jew with a dream of being 
famous. Irving Mansfield (Nathan Lane) is a New York Jew who's character 
isn't well-explained at all. For some reason, Irving craves Jacqueline 
(keep in mind that Midler is hardly a slender sex-star) and marries her 
under the condition that he make her famous. (Don't think Jacqueline is 
quick to marry though, she does seek G-d's approval when she drags 
Irving to Central Park and talks to a tree- something that doesn't look 
that odd for Central Park.)</P>
<P>Jacqueline, who admits "All I know about are aging astars, hopeful 
hookers and people popping pills and winding up in the gutter," is 
rather untalented in the performing arts. So, as history dictates, she 
earns her fame by writing about her aforementioned knowledge of a sleazy 
industry. En route to her pinnacle, there comes the humorless editor 
(David Hyde Pierce), who does the unthinkable when he orders mayonnaise 
in a deli, and assorted other characters that more closely resemble 
cliches and caricatures than real people.</P>
<P>How can a true story be accused of over-characterization and being too 
cliche filled? I quote the press notes when speaking of how the 
filmmakers "decided to loosen up the story a bit to make room for  the 
film they all wanted to make." So just how loosened were things? Well, 
this story isn't supposed to be a comedy, but the writers made it one. </P>
<P>In becoming the comedy into which it has no right morphing, Isn't She 
Great finds its most serious problem. Jacqueline had cancer. Her son was 
mentally retarded. There is something decidedly pathetic and unfunny 
about a joke aimed at a dying woman's hospital suite- just one of the 
many cracks made in the 95 minute production. And the scenes that are 
genuinely funny, which, thanks primarily to Nathan Lane, there are a few 
of, are too embarrassing to enjoy in the middle of a poorly disguised 
drama.</P>
<P>Poor Nathan Lane. This is a great role for him and nobody will remember 
it in two weeks. He is absolutely fabulous as a constantly schmoozing 
New York Jew. And David Hyde Pierce is commendable as well, playing his 
typical straight man role. Even John Cleese is fun in a supporting role. 
As for Bette Midler, you would never be able to tell that she is the 
great performer she is by watching this movie. </P>
<P>The opening lyric of Isn't She Great is "I don't know where I am going." 
Neither does the film.</P>
