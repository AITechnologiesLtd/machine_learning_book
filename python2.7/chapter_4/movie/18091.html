THE CRUSH
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Many men dream of being the love interest of a beautiful
young girl. However, such dream can turn into nightmare,
especially when such girl happens to be emotionally unstable
minor. Protagonist of this film, 28-year old journalist Nick
Eliot (Carey Elwes) can't imagine the ordeal that waits for
him, when he rents garage in upper-class home of Forresters.
14-year old Darien Forrester (Alicia Silverstone) needs
company and Nick soon becomes her trusted friend. However,
young nymphet soon develops certain feelings for Nick and
tries to seduce him. But her efforts are in vain; Nick not
only wants to do the right thing, he finds love interest in
Amy Maddick (Jennifer Rubin), female colleague with more
appropriate age. Darien is furious and begins not so subtle
campaign of harassing and dirty tricks, with the sole aim to
grab Nick and keep it for herself. Soon, Amy's, and later,
Nick's life come into danger.</P>
<P>The script by movie director Alan Shapiro was ideal for the
dark, erotic thriller inspired by Kubrick's LOLITA.
Unfortunately, the producers, fearing any possible
controversy during the zenith of Political Correctness,
decided to drop any hint of erotica down the drain. Instead,
they turned the movie into just one of the many thrillers of
those times, dealing with disturbed individuals who wreak
havoc in the idyll of middle-class American families. The
only difference this time is the fact that the psychopathic
individual in question happens to be is 14-year girl. She
was played by Alicia Silverstone, teen actress who had
already became famous as the star of "Aerosmith" videos. The
fame received through those videos was enough for
Silverstone to win the 1993 Best Villain MTV award based on
the role in this movie. Although she did put some effort in
her first major film role, her talent doesn't show very
much, mostly because of the terrible, formulaic script, full
of implausible situations and standard plot devices. In
order to be really impressive villain, her character had to
be really charismatic and possess some evil intelligence -
being pretty isn't enough, when her actions don't make sense
(like putting the object of her affection in jail). Even
erotic appeal, required for this kind of movie, is suppressed
because of auto- censorship. With the exception of male
lead, Carey Elwes, other actors in this film are doing the
capable job, and the direction is more or less adequate. In
the end, THE CRUSH is watchable, but easily and justifiably
forgettable Hollywood product, who could be interesting only
for the hard core fans of Alicia Silverstone.</P>
