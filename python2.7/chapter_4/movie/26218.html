<PRE>"Almost" But Not Quite
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>"Almost Famous" is like sneaking a peek inside
someone's diary and taking a glimpse into their life. 
Diary entries, however, don't usually make for
compelling reading.  And, rarely does it fascinate
enough to joggle your imagination.  It is, after all,
a series of brief observations and perhaps a few
poignant lessons learned.  But if you're glimpsing
into the life of Cameron Crowe (writer/director of
this film who also wrote "Jerry Maguire"), you may
find it to be an interesting chapter about his life
when in 1973, he was an adolescent that was able to do
a few things that most similarly aged boys could only
dream about.</P>
<P>In this pseudo-autobiographical film, Crowe is William
Miller (played by newcomer Patrick Fugit), a 15-year
old prodigy who has a love for rock and roll.  He's
not the kind of wild-eyed teen who praises it by
singing its songs or mimicking its stars.  Rather, his
homage to it comes in the form of articles that strive
to explain what it's all about.  His writing ability
garners the attention of Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour
Hoffman), a powerful editor within the music
journalism circle.  Impressed with William's level of
insight and concerned about his impressionable youth,
he counsels the star-struck kid about the realities
and ethics that underlie the business.  He warns him
not to make friends with rock stars.  "They make you
feel cool," he imparts. "But I've met you.  And, you
are not cool."  Above all, Bangs urges him to be
honest and unmerciful.</P>
<P>William is well on his way and eventually catches the
eye of Rolling Stone magazine.  They ask him to write
a cover piece about Stillwater, a (fictitious) band on
the cusp of stardom.  With his boyish appeal and his
arsenal of music knowledge, the young reporter
immediately makes a connection with the band members
and they welcome him as part of the family.  Of
course, William is about to enter an environment
totally foreign to him, full of compromised values and
the allure of fame, giddy girls and drugs.  It will be
a tough journey ahead as he tries to complete his
article, find his moral bearings in his strange New
World, and hold on as he is rapidly ushered forth
towards adulthood.</P>
<P>During his time with the band, he experiences dramas
that no 15-year old is equipped to handle.  The
largest issue involves him, a fan named Penny Lane
(Kate Hudson) and Stillwater band member Russell
(Billy Crudup).  There is a love triangle brewing
here, although it never reaches soap opera
proportions.  But the theme runs throughout the film. 
There's also a drama about the Stillwater band itself
as it struggles through its period of growth and
increasing popularity.  There's another dilemma about
William's responsibility to report truthfully and the
fondness he has for the group.  And there are other
milieus that arise here and there as the story winds
its way to a close.  </P>
<P>"Almost Famous" will be more warmly received by
critics than by the general movie-going audience, like
me.  It has several interesting and charming segments.
 But, it didn't quite achieve the emotional
highpoints.  I could not fully buy into the emotions
that the band probably felt or even the wonderment
that young Williams experienced.  It just lacked a
needed dimension of eagerness.  And oddly, the film
seemed to want to open itself to much grander ideas
such as the tenderness of young love, the zeitgeist of
that turbulent era, or the evolution of rock. 
However, it remained in a bloated state of
self-absorption.  The pace is never quicker than a
stroll and the payoff merely satisfies (thanks
primarily to Frances McDormand's role as William's
rational mom, who anchor's everyone back to reality). 
But, the film doesn't gratify.  We certainly deserved
more.  </P>
