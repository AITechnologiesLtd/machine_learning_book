<P>   A movie need not have a tightly-wound, unified plot to
work.  One recent film--a critically underrated box office flop 
--functioned like a series of Saturday Night Live sketches and
was laugh-a-minute funny throughout.  I speak of Mike
Judge's Dilbert-like "Office Space," which should have been a
hoot for those in the audience who make their living in
offices.  Mike Judge arrays in their cubicles crunching
numbers and doing assorted jobs which are not in the least
as meaningful as the genuinely productive deeds that
muscular guys accomplish on the street with their drills,
hammers, and saws.  The basis for its rich humor is its
grounding in reality.  Although as distorted as a Hirschfield
caricature, "Office Space" reveals the emotional truths that
inhabit the souls of so many guys and gals who trudge to
their metal desks in Kafkaesque rooms shuffling papers that
only wind up in the circular file.</P>
<P>   "Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me," similarly a
series of sketches, has virtually no basis in reality.  Even that
defect could be compensated for if the humor were not so
sophomoric, repetitive, just plain unfunny.  Despite the
abundant scatological references and allusions to the penis,
"Austin Powers 2" cannot even boast of its potential to offend
anyone to the left of the Ayatollahs.  Too bad the script is not
up to the acting ability of Mike Myers, who wowed his
aficionados in the (also underrated) "So I Married an Ax
Murderer," which found the humorist in multiple roles as well. 
He was almost unrecognizable when he affected a deep
Scottish brogue in the guise of his own father.</P>
<P>   Where "Office Space" holds a thesis--that work is a
travesty that kills the human spirit--"Austin Powers 2" simply
relies on scattershot gags loosely tied together by two
doctrines: 1) that most advertising and a great deal of TV are
largely ridiculous.  Then again, we knew that ever since we
were 4 years old and began spoofing the silly commercials
ourselves.  2) Much is made of the paradox that the private
parts of the human body are at once the source of sexual
turn-ons and the root of the most vulgar of excretory activity.</P>
<P>   The film jumps freely back and forth from 1999 to 1969 as
Dr. Evil (Mike Myers in his glabrous guise) plots to destroy
master spy Austin Powers (Mike Myers in his Carnaby Street
aspect).  Powers had been freeze-dried and, thawed out in
the 90s is now honeymooning with his bride, Vanessa
(Elizabeth Hurley), who turns out to be other than the person
he expected.  In the catchies scene of the entire work,
Vanessa asks, "Do you smoke after sex"? Powers replies, "I
don't know.  I never look."  The way Powers discovers that
his wife is a fembot is a gem.  While Powers ducks the
fussilades aimed at him by his stripped-down wife,  Dr. Evil
enters his time machine to return to 1969 with the aim of
stealing Powers' "mojo," which, loosely translated, is the
groovy guy's libido.</P>
<P>   Unlike "International Man of Mystery," this version treats
the eponymous spy as a all-around swinger and idol and not
as the nerdy oddball he portrayed two years ago.  Largely a
send-up of the James Bond series, the movie shows our hero
fixing a cup of coffee not in the manner of Sean Connery
(who could make a cappuccino in one-quarter the time of the
typical Starbuck's clerk today) but mistakenly pouring the
contents of a cup of stool sample into his cup and later
comparing the taste to that of almonds.</P>
<P>   There are some cute cameos, as of Burt Bacharach and
Elvis Costello, of Woody Harrelson and of Tim Robbins, but
the biggest surprise of all is in the actor who plays a
repulsive 400-pound Scotsman known as Fat Bastard. 
Heather Graham as Bond's CIA-based girl friend does not
have the sophistication or dazzling good looks of Liz Hurley,
but she has the talent for vaudevillian touches.  And Mike
Myers continues to charm.  I feel bad for him that he lacks a
more resonant script: the guy's a comic genius who can
charm the pants off even an adult audience.  But this time
around he's in yet another vehicle that does not adequately
exploit his flair for comedy, particularly his almost unique
ability to assume multiple roles with vaudevillian abandon.</P>
<PRE>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 90 minutes.  (C) 1999
