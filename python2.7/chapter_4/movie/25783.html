<PRE>The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle</PRE>
<P>I remember an old episode of "Dr Katz: Licensed Therapist" where Dr. Katz 
told Ben, "Puns aren't really good or bad, they're just puns." I think "The 
Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle" is just one big argument that puns are, in 
fact, good. </P>
<P>How this film ever got the greenlight is pretty amazing. It's obviously 
intended to be a "family" film but most little kids these days have probably 
never heard of Rocky and Bullwinkle and most adults who are old enough to 
remember them would probably dismiss the notion of seeing this in theaters 
and instead just wait for video (besides, their kids are probably kicking and 
screaming and dragging them to the "Pokémon" movie). It's a shame because 
anyone who's not seeing this now is really missing out. </P>
<P>Think of it as a G-rated version of "Austin Powers." There's a lot of wacky 
cartoony humor and puns and play-on-words as well as some really sly jokes 
that are quite the zinging [political] commentaries. The story tells of the 
cartoon villains from the old 1960s TV show (Fearless Leader, Boris & 
Natasha) who make a deal with a Hollywood producer to make a movie and when 
the contract is pulled out of the cartoon world the characters come with it. 
"We're attached to the project" says Fearless Leader (Rober De Niro) who then 
admits it's a bad pun but it works for the sake of the movie. </P>
<P>And that's the comedy stylings at work here - verbal and physical puns and 
parodies all over the place. It's all tongue-in-cheek, winking-at-the-camera 
comedy and it works very well. Every character's name is like this such as 
our co-star Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) who is a rookie FBI agent assigned 
to get Rocky & Bullwinkle out of the cartoon world and into the real one to 
help stop Fearless Leader's devious scheme to hypnotize the world with his 
own TV network that broadcasts shows so bad they turn all viewers into 
mindless zombies. </P>
<P>See? Isn't that funny, witty comedy? The film makers could have just done 
something more mainstream and predictable and have Fearless Leader do 
something Dr. Evil/James Bond villain-style such as something with hostages 
and blowing up stuff. The fact they chose to use this method for the plot as 
well as jokes upon jokes is pretty uncanny. Of course there's also the common 
"Rocky & Bullwinkle" plot of Boris & Natasha trying to destroy moose and 
squirrel which occupies the first half of the film. Jason Alexander and Rene 
Russo are fantastic as these classic baddies and the script and props really 
enhance the cartoony atmosphere. It's funny, but not silly. </P>
<P>Now it really wouldn't do the film justice to list just a few examples of the 
jokes and hope that would reflect the entire movie - every one is a little 
different from the last one. Taken out of context they might not work, but 
within the movie it's funny. </P>
