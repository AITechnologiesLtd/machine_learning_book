<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 stars</P>
<P>I gathered two meanings from the title "Tea with Mussolini."  The first
one refers to an actual, real-life event in which a character in the
film does indeed sit down and have a cuppa with the legendary Roman
leader himself.  The second, as I interpreted it, has a slightly
ironical overture.  The word "tea" brings to mind visions of calmness
and peace, and whist these are the overriding message of this film (it's
subtlety belt into your forehead by director Franco Zeffirelli), it
strives for more than just a story devoted to the kinship between its
central characters.  There's another message in the film that relates to
the political nature of war, as observed by a group of elderly,
respectable women.  Whilst Zeffirelli doesn't go wildly in depth into
war events - usually he shows a few clips of mild carnage and distress
then moves on - he does do it on enough occasions to jerk his narrative
out of flow, which leads to his one major misstep: he tries to cover too
much.  Unsatisfied by the breath of his lovable and beautifully
developed characters, Zeffirelli goes for a universal meaning, when
individual growth would have been good enough.</P>
<P>That's probably as cynical as I can get about this very likeable film,
and I've said it all in the first paragraph.  Although similar ground
was covered to greater affect in Roberto Benigni's much acclaimed 'Life
is Beautiful,' 'Tea with Mussolini' proves its right for theatrical
existence by first supplying quality production elements.  The film is
gorgeously shot by cinematographer David Watkin ('Memphis Belle') who is
privileged with the already stunning environment of Florence, and the
sixty-something actors all play their parts convincingly, bouncing off
each other with talent and authenticity that many years of experience
have given them.</P>
<P>Based on an autobiographical novel, the 'Scorpioni' were a small group
of eccentirc English ladies living in Florence.  The story begins in
1935, when Mary (Joan Plowright) brings a young boy, Luca (played as a
child by Charlie Lucas then later by Baird Wallace), into the circle of
friends.  Luca is encouraged to appreciate all kinds of art by Arabella
(Judi Dench), and is taken care of and loved by the members of the
group.  Lady Hester (Maggie Smith) is the undeclared leader of the
Scorpioni, whose dry humour and cynical comments at every corner keep
the group in stride.  All this is really just an inflated prologue, as
the centerpiece drama unfolds as World War II breaks out and, when Italy
sides with Germany, the Scorpioni find themselves in the wrong country
at the wrong time.</P>
<P>I suppose the surprise member of the cast is Cher, who plays a wealthy
and glamorous American (so far from reality, huh?) and fits in quite
nicely with the talent that surrounds her.  She proves that she is
strong enough, to live without music videos.  That said, Joan Plowright
is close to perfection as the lovable and wise Mary, and Maggie Smith
delivers her lines with a cool, dry wit that makes her one of the film's
most entertaining actors.  Judi Dench is also strong, but then again, so
is everybody.  'Tea With Mussolini' reassures us that, no matter how old
the protagonists of a film may be, basic characteristics of acting don't
change.  The film's characters are vivid and engaging, thanks purely to
these performers and, to a lesser degree, their dialogue, which flows
quite nicely and even contains some quaint English humour.</P>
<P>Tea With Mussolini looks, sounds and feels like an Oscar contender that
has arrived unexpectedly, and considerably earlier than usual (the
fierce competition usually begins in November or December).    I think
it's one of those films that most people will consider "good" but not
"great," it's a strong serve but it isn't an ace.  Zeffirelli, at times,
seems like he's taking his material a little too seriously, but that's a
problem that's pretty much unavoidable, considering the nature of the
picture, its context and its characters.  It's pretty serious stuff;
it's all about hope, and faith, and devotion, and togetherness, and
inspiration, and love and…boy, this does sound like an Oscar contender.</P>
<P>Many of the heights in Tea With Mussolini occur when the picture relaxes
and allows its characters - rather than its setting, or its Place in
History - to interact with each other.  When this occurs, the film
soars.  If Zeffirelli had kept his narrative intimate and close but
still mildly threatening, this good film could have been a great one.
In his attempts to cover world history, Zeffirelli lessens the impact of
his skillfully etched characters, but still includes enough of the good
stuff to make Tea With Mussolini an entertaining and sometimes moving
picture that aspires to achieve a little more than it actually does.</P>
