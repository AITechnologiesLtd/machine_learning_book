<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Unlike novels, comic books have traditionally proven extremely difficult 
to translate to the big screen. The list of quality film versions of 
comics is precipitously short: the original "Superman", the odd-numbered 
"Batman"s, "The Matrix", and little else. Marvel Comics -- historically 
one of the two dominant players in the comic book industry -- has been 
particularly inept in turning its super-heroes into box office gold, with 
most of its films either dying a quick death or going straight to video 
("Blade" being a notable exception).</P>
<P>Part of the reason for this is that several movies featuring Marvel's 
toplining characters have been stuck in development hell for years. 
Finally, however, their most popular franchise has made it into theatres as
"X-Men", a film about mutants, humans who represent mankind's next stage 
of evolution. Mutants develop extraordinary powers, but have incurred the 
suspicion and fear of normal people as a result.</P>
<P>Mutant abilities usually manifest themselves after puberty, as with 
Southern teenager Marie (Anna Paquin). While making out with her 
boyfriend, she discovers that her touch drains a person's "life force" -- 
whether she wills it or not. Panicking, Marie hits the road, assuming the 
alias "Rogue". Making her way into northern Canada, she meets Wolverine 
(Hugh Jackman), a mutant with a shadowy past who rapidly heals wounds and 
has metal claws which emerge from his hands.</P>
<P>Wolverine and Rogue are attacked by the super-strong Sabretooth (Tyler 
Mane). They are saved by Cyclops (James Marsden), who shoots lasers from 
his eyes, and Storm (Halle Berry), who controls the weather. Together 
with telekinetic Dr Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Cyclops and Storm are 
members of the X-Men, a team of mutants formed by Professor Charles 
Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who believes that mutants and regular humans 
should strive for peaceful coexistence. He is opposed by Magneto (Ian 
McKellen), whose Brotherhood of Mutants -- including the nimble Toad (Ray 
Park), shape-shifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), and Sabretooth --
is dedicated to the eradication of non-mutants.</P>
<P>The "X-Men" comic book was borne out of the social unrest of the Sixties, 
with mutantkind acting as a catch-all parallel for any oppressed 
minority. That metaphor is no less effective today, and the "X-Men" movie 
adroitly paints a world which resents mutants, without going over the 
top. We can understand why normal humans react the way they do, even if 
we disagree with them.</P>
<P>Particularly well-handled is Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison), a 
McCarthy-like figure who wants to enact mutant registration laws and 
other rights-restricting measures. An early scene in which Kelly waves 
around a list of "known mutants" is chilling -- made all the more so by 
the excellent publicity strategy for the film, which saw real people 
"campaigning" for Kelly and the creation of an "anti-mutant" website.</P>
<P>"X-Men" boasts several fine performances, particularly Jackman as the 
feral Wolverine. He manages to infuse his anti-hero role with humor and 
nobility, creating an exciting, engaging character. Also commendable is 
Paquin as Rogue, the film's most tragic figure. She conveys the panic and 
confusion Rogue experiences without neglecting the spunk and 
self-confidence which propels her character. The other actors have more 
limited screen time but generally do a good job with their material. Of 
note is Park ("The Phantom Menace"'s Darth Maul) who turns the 
potentially farcical Toad into an enjoyable yet threatening character. The 
entire array of "X-Men" characters is well chosen, diverse in both power 
and appearance.</P>
<P>Visually, "X-Men" is inspired, making the most of its comparatively 
limited budget (about US$75 million, in an era when most movies of its 
stature cost twice as much). Magneto's island base and the X-Men 
headquarters are well-designed, and the special effects are low-key but 
convincing. The realisation of super-hero costumes has long been a sore 
point for the genre; "X-Men" eschews the heroes' comic book attire for 
stylish motorcycle uniform-type outfits. The film also boasts some lovely 
attention to detail. For instance, one young mutant (inspired by the 
comics character Iceman) has the power to instantly freeze moisture. When 
he speaks, you can see his breath.</P>
<P>Director Bryan Singer does an effective job, setting the tone with a 
faux-"Schindler's List" scene of a young Magneto in a Nazi concentration 
camp. (This has drawn some criticism for being inappropriate, but I 
thought it was tactfully handled, and established a palpable mood.) 
Singer avoids the extremes of the "Batman" franchise by not letting 
things get too campy or too grim. He allows for a lot of humor (including 
some cute in-jokes for fans of the comic book) without forgetting the 
serious nature of the allegory the film is drawing.</P>
<P>It is unfortunate, then, that the script (by David Hayter and a host of 
uncredited contributors) treats the anti-mutant subject matter only 
cursorily after the first few minutes. At one point, Wolverine asks Storm 
if she truly believes Xavier's side is the right one. But the question 
may as well have been rhetorical, so little doubt is there as to anyone's 
allegiances.</P>
<P>The movie's biggest flaw is that it spends so much time on set-up that 
the actual meat of the plot (Magneto's strike against mankind) seems 
almost an afterthought. To an extent, this is unavoidable, given the 
dizzying number of characters and concepts to be comprehensibly 
introduced. But I don't see why "X-Men" couldn't simply have been 
lengthier -- at just over an hour and a half, it is not exactly a long 
movie.</P>
<P>I can only guess that the filmmakers felt the need to pander to the 
attention span-deficient MTV generation, and feared that a protracted 
movie would be less commercially viable. But I never found my interest 
flagging at any point; indeed, I wanted to know more about these 
characters and see the plot better developed. I was sorely disappointed 
that these things did not happen. If nothing else, "X-Men" leaves me 
looking forward to the sequel for which it is so clearly paving the way.</P>
