<PRE>MY GIANT

Genre: Comedy
Year of Release: 1998</PRE>
<P>Michael Lehmann's follow-up to the funny and touching THE TRUTH ABOUT
CATS AND DOGS (7.5/10) doesn't come close to that film, or his
directorial debut of HEATHERS (8/10), one of JoBlo's personal
favourites. Crystal is also credited as one of the people who came up
with the "story" for this film.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Fast-talking agent from New York (Crystal) gets his life saved by a
gigantic man in Romania (Muresan) and decides to bring him back to
America for a shot at success in the world of entertainment.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This film is anything but a comedy. Yes, it does have some funny
scenes. Yes, it does feature Billy Crystal, the successful host of the
Oscars, cracking us up from year to year. But no, unfortunately for all
those going into this film expecting a yuck-fest...'tis not to be, my
friends. This film is rooted in sentimentality and the manipulation of
emotions (in its characters and for the audience). Most of the film
involved a sub-plot about the "giant" coming to America to find his
long-lost love (nothing funny about that), and the fact that he may
have some health problems (nothing funny about that either).</P>
<P>As a general film, it does work on some emotional levels, but as a
comedy, it is definitely not something you would recommend to your
friends for a "good laugh". Muresan is excellent as the puppy-eyed
"giant" who doesn't want nor need much out of life. Crystal is generic
as usual, and does little to distinguish his character from every other
neurotic, wise-cracking Jewish yuppie that he's played over the years
(Did I just describe Crystal as a "person" or his "character"? Too
close to call. I guess the man's acting abilities don't necessarily
stretch from his own persona). Funny at times, overly sentimental at
others.</P>
<P>Overall, the movie doesn't deliver many laughs (one unique scene
featuring the real Steven Seagal is pretty cool, and pretty big on
Seagal's part, as the scene essentially makes fun of him-word on the
street is that Seagal originally turned the part down, but after
hearing that Van Damme might take it, he curiously reconsidered), has a
disappointing ending, and seems to use Muresan's pure innocence and
naiveté to garner emotional attachment from the audience (worked a
little bit, but after a while....). The good points, well, not too
many, but I guess I was never really bored or angry during the entire
screening, so that's a plus. A flaccid recommendation indeed.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
The film is dedicated to Andre. That's "Andre the Giant" to the laymen.</P>
<P>A scene featuring Mr. Muresan having to drink wine to get "tipsy", and
being hauled onto a horse by a crane, is based on an actual occurence
during the filming of Rob Reiner's PRINCESS BRIDE (8/10), when Andre
the Giant also ran into some problems attempting to mount a horse.
Billy Crystal stands 5"8, while Muresan towers at 7"7. Muresan's mom
was 5"7 and his dad was only 5"9. He wears a size 19 shoe, and plays
professional basketball in the NBA with the Washington Wizards.
Billy Crystal once studied film and television direction at NYU,
partially under the tutelage of filmmaker Martin Scorsese (TAXI DRIVER
8/10, GOODFELLAS 9/10 ).</P>
