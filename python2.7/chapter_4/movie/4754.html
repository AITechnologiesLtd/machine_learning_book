<P>     Owing more than just a nod to Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS, 
Gary Fleder's THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD tries to tell the 
same sort of hip tale about sympathetic gangsters whose crime goes 
horribly wrong.  A lot is missing however -- the snappy, polished 
dialogue; the tense, gritty atmosphere; and the nearly-perfect pacing.  
THINGS TO DO is a wannabe that never quite makes it.  That's not to say 
it's all bad, however. </P>
<P>     The film introduces us to Jimmy the Saint (Andy Garcia), a slick 
ex-gangster with style, class, and some great pickup lines.  For a 
while, Jimmy has been on the right side of the law, running a business 
called Afterlife Advice, in which dying men and women record words of 
wisdom for their heirs.  The debts are mounting, however, and Jimmy is 
in desperate need of cash.  So, when a shady, quadriplegic crime boss, 
The Man With the Plan (Christopher Walken), comes to him with an offer 
he can't refuse, Jimmy listens. </P>
<P>     The Man With the Plan has a son, Bernard, who desperately needs to 
get back together with his ex-girlfriend.  To facilitate this, Jimmy is 
commissioned to put a scare into the girl's intended fiancee.  The fee 
is $50,000 and Jimmy can bring in as many men as he wants.  So, armed 
with the promise of easy money, he rounds up his old crew -- guys with 
absurd names like Franchise (William Forsythe), Pieces (Christopher 
Walken), Critical Bill (Treat Williams), and Easy Win (Bill Nunn).  
Things don't proceed smoothly, however.  A couple of well-placed insults 
from the intended victim cause Critical Bill to go ballistic, and Jimmy 
is soon faced with the unpleasant prospect of disposing of two bodies, 
then explaining his failure to The Man With the Plan. </P>
<P>     The first half of THINGS TO DO is an unoriginal-but-entertaining 
tale of gangster-types botching a crime.  Many of the settings will be 
familiar to followers of film noir, and much of the self-consciously 
cool dialogue is derivative of, albeit inferior to, Tarantino's.  After 
the movie's midpoint, however, things go in the wrong direction.  The 
poorly-paced second hour features a lot of aimless running around and 
talking punctuated by bursts of bloody action that don't signify much.  
Most of the characters who get axed haven't been fleshed out enough to 
capture our sympathy, so it's easy to shrug off their deaths as a waste 
of screen time.  The only one we care about is Jimmy, and his motives 
and intentions become increasingly murky as THINGS TO DO moves towards 
its predictable conclusion. </P>
<P>     Andy Garcia turns in one of his best performances in years, 
infusing Jimmy with an unexpected dose of humanity.  Garcia has a number 
of deftly-acted scenes, the best of which center on his evolving romance 
with Gabrielle Anwar's Dagney, an innocent girl caught up in Jimmy's 
mess.  Treat Williams is wildly energetic as Bill, a nutcase with an 
itchy trigger finger.  Williams chews on the scenery a little, 
delivering lines like "I'm Godzilla and you're Japan!" with suitable 
gusto.  Bill Nunn, William Forsythe, and Chistopher Lloyd do adequate 
jobs playing the misfits who round out Jimmy's crew.  Christopher Walken 
is his usual creepy self as The Man With the Plan. </P>
<P>     As is true of his BEAUTIFUL GIRLS script, Scott Rosenberg's 
screenplay is largely a pastiche of themes and ideas from other, better 
pictures.  This movie has been assembled with enough aptitude to offer 
two hours' tepid entertainment, but it's not nearly as clever as the 
title suggests.  A few too many characters and scenes in THINGS TO DO IN 
DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD lack life and luster, making Fleder's film more 
of a pretender than a contender in a field that includes superior 
entries like RESERVOIR DOGS and THE USUAL SUSPECTS. </P>
