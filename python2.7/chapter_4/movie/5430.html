<PRE>                               ELIZABETH R
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>        Elizabeth I may have been the 16th Century's regal Mae West -- a
sexual tease who liked to have herself surrounded by pretty boy studs. She
loved playing the coquette, deliberating enticing her many suitors into
believing they had a chance to do more than kiss her hand and bow. The
royal vamping started early: at age 14, it was hotly rumored but never
proven that she consummated an affair with Lord Admiral Thomas Seymour.
(What's true is that their presumed sexless amorous play in and out of her
bedroom would lead to his arrogance and death.) As her charms manifested,
which included formidable intelligence (she spoke five languages) but not
true physical beauty, she thrived on as well as encouraged false flattery.
She selected "pets" and consorts like the Earl of Leicester (Robert
Dudley, her "Sweet Robin") and the Earl of Essex (Robin's stepson) because
they were unacceptable partners in marriage. She was steadfast throughout
her child-bearing years her resolute position that she'd never marry -- no
matter the long list of royal kings and princes who wished for marriagr
circle of council, who seldom let up on the need for her to give birth to
an heir. By all acceptable accounts, the queen remained a willed virgin
out of survival instincts. The bastard offspring of Henry VIII and the
beheaded Anne Boleyn -- scholar J.J. Scarisbrick calls the infant "the
most unwelcome royal daughter in English history" -- Elizabeth became
necessarily cognizant of her need to stay alive at the age of eight when
her stepmother, the beloved Catherine Howard, was also sent to the
chopping block. Shortly thereafter her brother Edward died prematurely and
she had to outfox a conspiracy lead by her Catholic half-sister Mary
Tudor's minions, who saw heresy in Elizabeth's Protestantism and mortal
threat to Mary's reign and succession. Not above the self-serving,
Elizabeth "converted" to Catholicism as a means by which she kept her
head, though such fears never -- not even during the more secure portion
of her reign -- dissipated: the murderous machinations of the Royals of
Europe and her own court's hangers-on precluded the feeling of safety.
Elizabeth understood that marriage and heir would not merely lessen her
own position, but would increase the likelihood of successful plots
against her. As Sir James Melville whispers into the queen's ear in part
two of ELIZABETH R, "For now you are both king and queen, but if you are
married, someone else would be king." Born out of the dread of the ax,
this Elizabeth, like Claudius some fifteen centuries before, survived by
the wisdom of political acrobatics. </P>
<P>        As Elizabeth, Glenda Jackson benefits from the miniseries format
and the lack of media-recorded impressions; there's no shortage of time to
watch her grow from lion's cub about to be devoured by prey to lioness --
a feline whose ferocity ruled England for forty five years -- and no film
or tape or voice recordings to permit petty criticism. Well, maybe this
one little quibble: she's long in the tooth to attempt to play the queen
as teenager -- she looks a tad ridiculous trying to, and often she
resembles Washington political writer Elizabeth Drew, irregular teeth, bad
epidermis and all. But the moment Jackson starts to outwit her
conspirators and then dons the title with its powers of governance, any
misgivings are wiped out, any comparisons to Flora Robson or Bette Davis
sent straight away to the trash heap. Though Jackson's got the peremptory
gestures, the roaring fearsome voice and hardy physique for Imperialism --
and her preeminent hard-edged, semi-masculine aura helps magnify the
imagery (you get the chills as you watch her pull back an arrow during a
game of archery) -- she's agile enough as actress to pull off the
coquettish games that were so integral a part of Elizabeth I. She
convinces us that her beloved Robin and all the others were kept from the
royal bed chamber, feats borne out of the queen's own unnamed fears about
marriage. In ELIZABETH R, she confesses to Sussex, "I can't do it. Every
day, I am more and more afraid." Supposedly an actual quote from the
queen: "I hate the idea of marriage for reasons that I would not divulge
to a twin soul." Publicly she vacillated between anger at courtiers'
proposals and humor: when informed that Spain's Philip II in marriage
could visit occasionally, and then only for a brief time, she replies: "In
short, the perfect husband." Historians continue their fascination with
her fears: some suggest that her doctor discovered a "woman's infirmity";
Ben Jonson the playwright believed she had "a membrana on her, which made
her uncapable of man," and others surmise she could have suffered from
Rokitansky's syndrome -- a very shallow vaginal canal and an
underdeveloped uterus. (During her own time, the London gossip be that she
had a child by Robin; in Catherine de Medici's court, as shown in part
three of the series "Shadow of the Sun," a dwarf Elizabeth mocks rumor of
the queen with "I am too narrow for a man.") Whatever the impediments to
marriage, they're all guesses, and mine is that she recognized what sex
had done to her family and suffered severe trepidation over the potential
consequences; her public pride of virginity acted as shield by which she
could protect herself. The six teleplays comprising the series smartly
avoid any license to explication de texte but as one hears Jackson's queen
periodically proclaim in vainglory her state of purity, it's more than a
guess that the actress is using it as her character's nucleus. </P>
<P>        Time has not much harmed the 1971 technique used for ELIZBAETH R:
using mostly video tape, there are a few jarring moments of film used for
the outdoor settings (this because of technical and lighting problems not
yet ironed out for tape), and perhaps the studio sets themselves are too
confining and overly dark, but it would only be a few years later when
Herbert Wise, who directed the second part of ELIZABETH R entitled "The
Marriage Game," would helm I, CLAUDIUS and perfect the use of video,
calibrating the actors to the settings in such a way that, especially with
Derek Jacobi's Claudius and Sian Phillip's Livia, the characterizations
would not be three dimensional but a 3D-like effect occurs: these
histsoric figures jump out at you, quelling the often irksome tape process
while at the same time aggrandizing it. Keith Michell as the king in THE
SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII opened the doors to this kind of intimate TV guide
to traverse the maze of history, Jackson would bring the prestige of a
great actress to the emerging miniseries genre, and Jacobi would become
its ultimate pilot. Some of the casting in ELIZABETH R can vex you: as
Mary Tudor, Daphne Slater is mea-culping like Martha Scott crossed as Jean
Harris; David Collings the traitor Anthony Babington a male Maggie Smith;
Michael Williams' Duke of Alencon about as appealing as the frog Elizabeth
refers to him as; Stephen Murray as Francis Walsingham emblematic
stereotyping; and Robert Hardy's Earl of Leicester and Robert Ellis' Earl
of Essex far removed from what most of us would see as handsome beaux to
the queen. Inflecting as sharp as a serpent's toothache, Vivian Pickles
comes close to juvenilizing Mary, Queen of Scots: recalling Nancy
Marchand, Pickles grates and you're not altogether sure if this is
intended as fair view, or if that voice is being used as a means by which
the character will be denied even a trace of sympathy. Pickles goes to her
death with the class of a royal, and Hugh Whitemore's script of this
episode, "Horrible Conspiracies," ends on the just the right notes of
horror and rue. (The same year as ELIZABETH R, Pickles would costar with
Jackson in John Schlesinger's modern soaper SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY, playing
a liberal, pot-smoking mother of four.) </P>
<P>        A few regrets: the series offers up little evidence of the
explosion of the arts, especially the theatre and Shakespeare, that
erupted during her reign. Thus, a separate chapter of her considerable
achievements and what flourished as result would have been appreciated:
Elizabeth attending a Bard production, reading or commenting on or even
socializing with Marlowe or Spencer. (Sirs Francis Bacon and Walter
Raleigh are included -- minimally.) While there are smidgens about
commerce, trade, standardization of coinage, judicial reform, ruinous
monopolies, these subjects are brought in as scene introductions, leading
to the more urgent and dramatic matters of petitioning for a decision
about marriage and heir, consoling bruised egos, battling over or
preparing conspiracies, decreeing punishments for treachery and treason.
(In "Horrible Conspiracies," Elizabeth demands a new killing device for
Babington, and Richard Topcliffe, the Queen's chief executioner, tells
Babs: "In such matters, I have the delicacy of a practiced seducer...the
sword begins here...with the privities. Castrated, ripped up...bowelled
alive...quartered yet still living. So many wonders await you...")
Watching the series, you get the impression that she saved her wrath
against Catholics only if conspirators, but history records that she
regularly persecuted Catholics and Puritans alike, and tried to wipe out
gypies. The defeat of Spanish Armada -- the basic subject of part five,
"The Enterprise of England" -- is maladroit and confusing, and though this
part's writer John Prebble attempts to make funny the details of England's
would-be naval battles, they're exasperating. All of the writers -- John
Hale ("The Lion's Cub"), Rosemary Anne Sisson ("The Marriage Game"),
Julian Mitchell ("Shadow in the Sun"), Whitemore, Prebble and Ian Rodger
("Sweet England's Pride") -- have refrained from the heavier colloquialism
as well as the lofty prattle of the time, in order to gain a wider
audience, but no line is fakespeak: this is the vernacular of the educated
using language as an instrument of precision, even when applied in a
manner most craftily evasive.</P>
<P>        Celebrating its silver anniversary, ELIZABETH R also celebrates
its survival against our Pentium age of media gotcha; our manic
destructive trashing hasn't reduced the magnitude of Jackson's portrayal,
which remains luminous -- historically just and sonorous. And she
accomplishes something else that astonishes in this era of special
effects: she burrows through all the powdered and rouge grotesquery of the
queen's smallpox-scarred last years; she conquers the horrors of Dawn
Alcock's spot-on kabuki makeup. You could get easily transfixed by it, and
by Elizabeth Waller's bejeweled wigs and progressively more majestic
costumes, a few of them gaudily adorned with butterfly wings. But Jackson
in character stays paramount: entrenched in her vision yet never
overwhelmed by it, she's not about to let us forget that she's playing --
and becomes -- the absolute Gloriana. Like Derek Jacobi's in the
triumphant I, CLAUDIUS, hers is a performance as the supreme example of
the balance of artistry. Both renditions are history as art and art as
history. Jackson's entitled to the superlative rarely earned --
magnificent.</P>
