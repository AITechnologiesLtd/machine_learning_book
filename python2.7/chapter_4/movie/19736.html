<P>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.</P>
<PRE>Starring Mike Myers and Heather Graham
Directed By Jay Roach
Running Time: 1 hour 35 minutes</PRE>
<PRE>(New Line Cinema)</PRE>
<P>When the original Austin Powers was released in cinemas around three years
ago, the screening I attended had about five people in total watching the
film. The Spy Who Shagged Me, (TSWME) the inevitable sequel, had about
thirty times that figure, a testament to Austin's video popularity. The hip
spy from the sixties returns to celluloid in this colourful, largely funny
sequel to 'International Man of Mystery.' Mike Myers plays the titular
Austin Powers, now living in the nineties with Vanessa Kensington.
Unfortunately, Austin's mojo is stolen by the evil Doctor Evil (Myers
again). Austin must return to the sixties to regain his mojo from the evil
doctor, and must also stop Dr. Evil from blowing up the earth with a large
"laser." He teams up with sexy CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Graham) and sets
off on his rather silly quest.</P>
<P>Mike Myers always seems to be lazy when making a sequel, usually by
recycling jokes from the original film to a less funnier extent. That
problem occasionally rears it's ugly head here: for example, the dancing
interludes don't seem nearly as funny as the original film, and barely raise
a laugh. However, although rather hit and miss, TSWME has enough laughs to
keep the film running until it decides to end just before it runs out of
steam. The cast, largely made up by Myers who plays three roles, is
energetic and fun. Robert Wagner repeats his brief part from the original
movie, before being replaced by Rob Lowe, who basically plays Robert Wagner
rather well. Mindy Sterling is fun as the German scarebag Frau Farbissina,
and Seth Green returns as Dr. Evils estranged son Scott. Heather Graham is
only slightly disappointing as Felicity, although this is largely to do with
the fact that her character is intensely shallow, little more than a sex
object. She looks great, but is more than a little empty. Finally, Verne
Troyer is rather good as Dr. Evils smaller clone, Mini-Me, although the
character is largely wasted until a funny fight between him and Austin near
the end of the movie.</P>
<P>The gags are largely good, stand outs include a funny tent gag, and a funny
performance of 'Just the Two of Us.' The film seems to have benefited from a
larger budget, with a much sharper, funnier look than the first film. It all
looks like a large set however, and clearly not filmed much in England (as
Austin points out.) The plot is full of inconsistencies, but Myers and Co.
desperately try to cover this up by telling the audience to 'go with it,'
which seems like a cop out. Vanessa Kensington's fate, for example, is badly
handled and then thrown away.</P>
<P>But although the set pieces are funny and some of the one-liners sharp,
there are some parts of TSWSM that just don't work. 'Fat Bastard,' a
Scottish assassin who weighs a metric ton, is largely unfunny, although he
gets one of the best lines near the end of the movie. Mini-Me is never fully
used. Austin is also curiously underused, and Dr. Evil gets far more screen
time. This is largely a good thing however, as Dr. Evil is much funnier than
Austin Powers, which is a bit odd seeing as Austin is meant to be the star.
But all the gags are delivered with a likeable charm, so even the ones that
don't work can get a smirk. There are some dead bits, but the belly laughs
that follow usually compensate. The film also delves into toilet humour far
more often than it's predecessor, and this gags aren't as funny or original
as the rest of the films jokes.</P>
<P>Overall, TSWSM is short and sweet enough to be good for some light comic
relief. It will keep you laughing, and Mike Myers charm practically flows
from the screen. There's enough effort to make this film work, and it is a
worthy enough successor to the already cult movie. It won't get you
thinking, but Austin Powers will certainly get you laughing.</P>
