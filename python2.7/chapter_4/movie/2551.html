<P>     While it may not be as enchanting as ENCHANTED APRIL (although it 
features two of that film's stars), as appealing as HEAR MY SONG, or as 
funny as FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, John Irvin's delightfully charming 
WIDOWS' PEAK can hold its own against those and many more.  This is a 
very British comedy that will cause laughter and smiles wherever it is 
shown. </P>
<P>     Overlooking the Irish village of Kilshannon is Widows' Peak - a 
group of select houses owned and inhabited exclusively by the rich women  
of the community who have buried at least one husband.  The matriarch of 
Widows' Peak is Mrs. Doyle-Counihan (Joan Plowright), who lives with her 
son Godfrey (Adrian Dunbar).  Also inhabiting the peak is Mrs. O'Hare 
(Mia Farrow), a woman who has never been married and who hasn't a penny 
to her name.  Then there's the newcomer:  a beautiful, young war-widow 
(it's 1920) named Edwina Broome (Natasha Richardson), who brings with 
her more secrets than those already buried in and out of the graveyard. </P>
<P>     Secrets are indeed at the center of WIDOWS' PEAK, and much of the 
comedy in this lighthearted romp comes through their revelation.  Though 
the film is a trifle overplotted, it's still enjoyable to uncover the next 
sordid detail of someone's past before the characters on screen do so. </P>
<P>     With a similar infectious charm to any of the previously-mentioned 
movies, WIDOWS' PEAK draws its audience in with promises of little more 
than a enjoyable time - a goal at which it succeeds.  There are no deep 
or hidden meanings to be found, no matter how much the plot itself relies 
on secrets. </P>
<P>     Joan Plowright has settled nicely into playing the stuffy matron, 
and she is again successful in that role.  Although the actress is more 
than capable of doing a dramatic turn when a part requires it, there's not 
much seriousness demanded from Mrs. Doyle-Counihan, and Mrs. Plowright 
pilfers countless scenes from her co-stars by sheer screen presence. </P>
<P>     Mia Farrow turns in a better performance than she has given in a 
number of years.  Having freed herself from Woody Allen's angst-riddled 
characters, she is allowed an opportunity to shine in a role that one 
might not typically associate with her.  Meanwhile, Natasha Richardson 
(THE HANDMAID'S TALE) plays her part with a delicious "falseness" which 
betrays that something's up - although we don't know exactly what.  Her 
American accent is flawless, which is something of a pleasant surprise. </P>
<P>     Jim Broadbent (LIFE IS SWEET, ENCHANTED APRIL) and Adrian Dunbar 
(HEAR MY SONG) do solid jobs as supporting characters, but it's the 
women to whom every scene - and the movie as a whole - belongs.  After 
all, it's not called WIDOWS' PEAK for nothing. </P>
<P>     Although there may be one twist or turn too many, and the plot 
skeleton is not without its supporting contrivances, few viewers will 
complain.  WIDOWS' PEAK, while admittedly not a great movie, offers a 
good time - and often that's all that is wanted from any motion picture. </P>
