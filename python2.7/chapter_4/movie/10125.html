<P>Note: This review contains spoilers at the end.</P>
<P>Watching "The Game" will fill one with quite a few thoughts and new
concerns when they leave the theater. You will never want to misplace
your keys again for one. Anyone suffering from clown-phobia will make
extra effort to avoid circuses and Venice Beach street actors. You'll
be wary of the next time a waiter or waitress accidentally spills
something on you. These are merely three of the many odd twists and
turns people are asked to take in throughout the entire film.</P>
<P>"The Game," starring Michael Douglas, is a psychological thriller in
every sense of the word. It starts off letting everyone know a little
bit about financial baron Nicholas Van Orton, a businessman with a
knack for making millions but little else. It's almost Gordon Gecko
revisited. He lives an empty life of work and stock reports with little
else going on outside of his office and country club. He's cold-
hearted enough that he can fire the head of a publishing company who
also happens to be a former best friend of his father without batting
an eye. His father was also a successful businessman who inexplicably
committed suicide by jumping off the roof of his estate. He alienates
his ex-wife who is also the mother of his child, he has a brother whom
he hasn't seen or spoken to in years (more on that later). His only
personally link to humanity is a kindly old woman who happens to be his
housekeeper for many years. Yet, throughout the movie, you realize that
he is capable of occasional moments of kindness, a dry humor, and other
interesting quirks. An interesting note; despite his riches, his
ability to dine at exclusive restaurants for during lunch breaks, a
membership at a posh country club, his dinners at home are simple fares
of hamburger and fries, or deli sandwiches. Complex? Yeah. Are you
following this so far?</P>
<P>Sean Penn brilliantly plays the seemingly mentally disturbed brother
Conrad. True Penn-ophiles might be disappointed to know he is limited
to only three scenes, but what little screen time he's given is used to
the utmost max. He first arrives on the scene on to wish Nick a happy
48th birthday and give him a card for a company called "Consumer
Recreation Services," or CRS. Incidentally, their father committed
suicide on his 48th birthday and this topic becomes a taboo topic
during their lunch meeting. Conrad guarantees a life changing
experience and Nick reluctantly agrees to it.</P>
<P>Nick meets up with a rather creepy CRS sales associate Jim Feingold.
Upon agreeing to it, he undergoes a battery of physical, intellectual,
and psychological tests to see if he qualifies to play the game. These
tests take quite a bit longer that expected, which as expected annoys
him, and even more frustrates him later to find out his test results
didn't meet requirements. Not all is what it seems however, as oddities
start popping up around him. One of the first being a waitress named
Christine (Deborah Kara Unger) who "accidentally" spills wine on Nick.
She unwillingly becomes a sidekick to Nick's upcoming mayhem.</P>
<P>The movie is expertly cast, with Douglas being the perfect choice to
play the icy and arrogant Van Orton. Few others can play such a
character with enough flair, charm and self-deprecating humor to the
point that he can get an audience to side with someone who just blew
off his kind ex-wife who called to wish him a happy birthday.</P>
<P>Master visual artist David Fincher takes viewers one a brain twisting,
darkly toned, and often depressingly moody view of San Francisco, the
city where Van Orton resides. Fincher, who last thrilled and disturbed
us in the brilliantly gut-wrenching "Seven," takes us on yet another
visual stunner of paranoia and confusion. He has a Hitchcock-ish eye
for setting the mood and tone of movies by knowing exactly how much
tension and suspense to use without going so far as to completely
alienate the audience. It helps to take your brain with you when you go
to see "The Game" since the clues and hints as to what really is going
on is multitudinous, though nothing will prepare you for the ending of
the movie. More on THAT later.</P>
<P>This movie isn't perfect, however. The otherwise well written plot is
so full of twists and turns that it's easy to not notice the artful eye
stimulation Fincher provides throughout the film. (Editorial note: it's
this very style that, in my humble opinion, kept Alien3 from being a
total disaster). Character development is enough for some, not enough
for others. One certainly gets to know the character of Van Orton as
the movie progresses. Unfortunately we're provided few ideas as to why
Conrad is the way he is. We're also asked to assume why the two of them
are estranged. Their relationship also isn't taken as far as it might
have been.</P>
<P>Depending on how the Game struck you, the ending will either be
fulfilling or a disappointment. Whichever it is, the viewers must
decide for themselves.</P>
<P>The first hour and half however, is a definite can't miss.</P>

<P>My view of the ending? I thought it was brilliant! Despite all the odd
occurrences throughout and the overall fast pace of  the film, I had
little trouble keeping up with the goings on of the Game. The plot
contorts itself and eventually tries to lead us to believe that CRS is
little more than a highly skilled and organized group of con-artist
after Nick's substantial wealth. I started to think Nick was
financially ruined and has little to lose -- even his life -- when I
realized that everything that was going on was in fact a Game. It was
truly a life changing experience, as Conrad promised, and we see this
change in Nick's attitude immediately. He finally shows some warmth
towards both his wife and her new husband. He and his brother start
acting like brothers, and the dead, cold look in his eyes prevalent
throughout the movie is no longer there.</P>
