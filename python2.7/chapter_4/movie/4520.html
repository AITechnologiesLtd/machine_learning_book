<P>     Like the recent HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT, this is another 
one of those "you go girl" films; that harmless subgenre of "chick 
flicks" in which a group of women gather to piss and moan about the 
stupid men in their lives, while never acknowledging that *they* 
are the stupid ones for having stayed with them.  The message of 
"needing a man to make me happy" is inappropriate, sure, but no 
worse than, say, the legions of big-gun testosterone poisoners that 
teach violence as a method of problem-solving.</P>
<P>     Even as a feminist fantasy, WAITING TO EXHALE is tremendously 
watchable.  Director Forrest Whitaker, making his feature-film 
debut, evokes genuine emotion from this stellar cast of leading 
ladies.  Standout sequences include a hilariously frank sex scene 
and the early show-stopper of Angela Bassett torching her hubby's 
BMW.  You go girl!  Equally engaging are the *male* roles; a parade 
of liars and cheats that could rival the entire rogues gallery of 
any DIE HARD, James Bond, or Batman movie.</P>
<P>     Writers Ronald Bass and Terry McMillan (from her novel) 
deliver a staggering number of mixed messages.  Only one of the 
characters (Loretta Devine) consistently acts responsible, and 
she's the least-glamorous of the lot.  More women are likely to 
identify with Bassett's character, a devoted wife whose husband has 
left her for a younger, whiter woman.  How does she react?  By 
having a "quick one" herself.  Sigh.  Ladies, go and enjoy this 
movie.  Laugh, cry, and talk back to the screen.  Get your 
catharsis and then go pay a counselor for some *real* advice. 
(Rated "R"/124 min.)</P>
