<PRE>DAS BOOT (1981)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson

<P>Many movies use a submarine as a setting to confine characters in order to
drive a movie, such as Crimson Tide and The Hunt for Red October. But, most
of these films never use the actual life aboard a submarine as the story.
These films use a larger point of view as the story - in Crimson Tide it
was about a nuclear attack, and in The Hunt for Red October it was about a
defecting skipper. Das Boot is a movie that shows us just how grueling life
was aboard a U-boat in World War II.</P>
<P>Wolfgang Petersen made the brilliant Das Boot before he made In the Line of
Fire, Outbreak, and Air Force One. His last three films are mediocre, all
of them falling in the stock action films department. I enjoyed them all,
but any director could have done them. I did not know Petersen's full
potential till I saw his first big hit, Das Boot.</P>
<P>Das Boot takes place about a German U-boat. This is where the film really
shines. Because it's a German U-boat in the middle of World War II, the
audience is not about to cheer for the crew. We are left gripped by the
story and their mission, instead of the hurrah of the "American Navy going
out and kicking enemy butt." </P>
<P>Das Boot follows a reporter (Herbert Grönemeyer) who goes on a tour of duty
with a U-boat. The U-boat is captained by a man only known as Captain
(Jürgen Prochnow). Though the captain is the eldest and strongest of all
the men aboard the U-boat, he is only in his mid-thirties. He is serving on
a boat full of young men, all of whom need strong leadership. The Captain
is the source of the leadership.
The Captain is not a real supporter of Hitler or the Nazis. He's just doing
his job. This is shown early on in the film.</P>
<P>Das Boot goes one step further; it shows us what life is like on a tin can
like the U-boat. The U-boat is truly a tin can - its dimensions barely
wider than a man with his arms outstretched and its height almost as tall
as a man. Das Boot goes to show that a submariner's life during a war is
truly 90% sheer boredom and 10% pure terror. We experience life at the pace
that the crew does - slow as molasses and repetitive, or quiet and
sweat-filled as the boat lays dormant trying to avoid depth charges. </P>
<P>Petersen and cinematographer Jost Vacano chose an ingenious way of
conveying the cramped conditions of a U-boat to the audience by shooting
the whole movie from within a real replica of a U-boat. This meant shooting
with a specially designed camera that could be used to follow crewmembers
from one end of the U-boat to the other. This makes for a movie that looks
and feels cramped.</P>
<P>There are moments in Das Boot that will make you sweat with the sailors.
The attack on a convoy is one. After the attack, destroyers criss-cross the
ocean above hunting the hunter. The terror from this moment comes not from
what we see but from what we hear the bolts popping, the slight creak, the
groan of the boat, and the hum of a near silent engine. Another moment
comes when the ship is sinking - again it's the sound that conveys the
terror, not the sights.</P>
<P>The version that I watched is the director's cut of the film, which spans
about 60 minutes more than the original cut. This puts the running time at
about three and a half hours. I have not seen the original cut, so I cannot
tell you what the differences are. The sound in this version has also been
digitally redone from the top down. And I congratulate the sound editing
team for putting together a wonderful soundtrack to the film.</P>
<P>A few weeks ago, I saw Saving Private Ryan, which I thought was a great
anti-war movie. Das Boot is of the same stature of Saving Private Ryan. It
is a movie of both technical brilliance and of great storytelling. And in
the end we are left wondering, why do humans fight wars? Don't Miss Das Boot.</P>
<P>Das Boot is available on videocassette and DVD. The video cassette version
is a subtitled version. The DVD version - which I viewed for this review -
contains both English dubbed, Spanish dubbed, and a German soundtrack. The
DVD version also has Spanish, French, and English subtitles.</P>
