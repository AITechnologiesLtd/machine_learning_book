<P>     Writer/director Mark Herman is so concerned about sounding the
trumpet to deliver a "message" in BRASSED OFF that he almost ruins a
perfectly good character study.  The story is set in the Yorkshire town of
Grimley, where Danny (Pete Postlethwaite) prepares to lead into
competition the brass band made up of workers at the local colliery (coal
mine).  Danny seems blissfully unaware of the issue which preoccupies
every other band member, including his own son Phil (Stephen Thompkinson):
the government program of coal pit closures which is threatening to make
Grimley the latest target.  Still the band, including a lovely new arrival
named Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald), plays on, trying to make progress toward
a national competition at the Albert Hall while a union vote over the fate
of the colliery looms.</P>
<P>     BRASSED OFF is at its best painting a vivid portrait of life in a
northern coal town.  Long days of hard labor are punctuated by pints with
the boys and nearly wordless exchanges between husbands and wives.
Meanwhile, the battle of wills between Danny and the other band members
points out a profound gap between what the band means to each side.  For
the players, it is a social club which provides a rare opportunity to blow
off steam, demonstrated in an amusing montage of ever-more-inebriated
performances.  For Danny, the band is a symbol, an enduring tradition and
the one beautiful thing in a dark, dusty world.</P>
<P>     If Herman had kept his focus on this clash between pragmatism and
idealism, best exemplified by the relationship between Danny and Phil (an
exceptional performance by Stephen Thompkinson), BRASSED OFF could have
been a minor gem.  Unfortunately, Herman is determined to make sure we
leave the theater enlightened about the injustice of the pit closure
program.  Phil rails against Margaret Thatcher in a church; Danny uses the
band competition as a soapbox for the miners' cause; statistics of job
losses roll by as the film ends.  Like too many directors of films about
social issues, Herman doesn't trust our sympathy for the characters to
create all the resonance the story needs.  Add an over-dramatized but
under-developed romance between Fitzgerald and Ewan McGregor (as a young
miner) and you have a film which strays from its strengths.  The human
drama of BRASSED OFF makes for much sweeter music than strident
sermonizing.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 brass bands:  6.</PRE>
