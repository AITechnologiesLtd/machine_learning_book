<P>     Movies about children can be made in four basic ways.  The first
is one of unabashed fantasy, without any pretensions to realism.  It
can yield very pleasing results, as in the Shirley Temple movies.</P>
<P>     The second way is that of the adults who exploit the kids' image,
and with premeditation try to con the public into believing that this
is how it really is.  Such films are false, but their lowest common
denominator formulas often work well with the mass public, including
the youthful public.  There are many such movies.</P>
<P>     The third approach is better intentioned, as the filmmakers kid
themselves that their depiction is genuine.  The fourth way is to make
the film as close and as faithful as possible to the kids' point of
view.  Theoretically, there could be a fifth method: films made
strictly, entirely, by kids and from their own viewpoint.  This is an
impossibility, a cinematic oxymoron.  One would have to implant
recording devices into a child's eye and brain, as in some
science-fiction pictures.</P>
<P>     So, the very best we can hope for is approach number Four.  This
is the attitude that gave us classics like Jean Vigo's ZERO FOR CONDUCT
or Francois Truffaut's 400 BLOWS and a few more films.  You now can add
to this tiny group the Swedish MY LIFE AS A DOG.</P>
<P>     Director Lasse  Hallstrom made his first movie at age ten, (with
his father's Super 8), the 3-minute "The Ghost Thief."  He went on
filming in high school, sold "Mascots" (about a music group) to TV
before graduating, became a freelance TV maker of short, funny
sketches.</P>
<P>     In the1970s, under contract to television, he made four rather
autobiographical series, including "Shall We Go Home to my Place or
your Place or Each One of Us to Our Own Place?"  The head of production
at the Swedish Film Institute found it funny, suggested that Hallstrom
make a film feature on the theme of "boy meets girl."</P>
<P>     That was A LOVER AND HIS LASS, followed by other features, all
described by a Swedish critic as "tranquil comedies."  In 1985, with
his fifth feature, the different MY LIFE AS A DOG, which is tranquil
and not so tranquil, a comedy as well as a drama with elements of
tragedy, Hallstrom stepped onto a broader scene.  The movie was voted
Film of the Year in Sweden, and its young star, Best Actor.  It has
since become a major international success, receiving prizes in
several festivals and getting excellent attendance.  Recent statistics
in the U.S.A. have it high on the box-office list, ahead of any other
current foreign film.</P>
<P>     MY LIFE AS A DOG, loosely adapted from a 1983 novel, treats in a
series of well-connected, smoothly flowing episodes, a period of about
a year in the life of a twelve-year old boy.  It is 1959, the year when
Swedish boxer Ingemar Johansson defeated world champion Floyd
Patterson.  The boy is also called Ingemar Johansson, and he too will
have to fight his way into growth.  His absentee father is out at sea,
somewhere in the Equator.  We never see him.  Ingemar is a private
boy, secret though not secretive.  He does not pass judgment on his
father or discuss him--or anyone or anything else for that matter--in
the orderly, narrative, cause-to-effect fashion of adults.  When asked,
he replies that father is loading bananas, and if he left, who would
load them?</P>
<P>     Ingemar lives with his older brother and his mother, a book-lover
terminally ill with tuberculosis.  The relationship among the three is
warm, understanding and attractive, in spite of some downs.  The boys
do their childish best to help with the chores, often with comically
catastrophic results.  Sibling rivalry, Ingemar's sub-teen high spirits
and awkwardness result in mischief and accidents that frequently
involve the elements, from water (Ingemar wets his bed) to fire (he
starts one by the beach).  There is an echo here of Truffaut movies
(THE 400 BLOWS, SMALL CHANGE) both in the details and in the way
the mishaps are treated matter-of-factly, humorously, elliptically,
without elaboration.</P>
<P>     The sick mother now and then goes into understandable fits of
rage.  When her condition worsens, the brothers are sent away to
different places for the summer.  Ingemar, separated from his dog, goes
to his uncle's house, in a small, provincial, unpaved nowheretown where
time seems to have stood still for decades.  The uncle, a married,
peasantish, kindly bon vivant, treats the boy like a pal, becomes a
bit--but not entirely--a surrogate father to him.</P>
<P>     Uncle works in a glassworks where old-fashioned methods are still
used.  Through him Ingemar meets a collection of oddballs and
eccentrics that could easily have become too picturesque or corny, were
it not for the film's ability to stop in time and to avoid
heavy-handedness.  He meets Saga, the best player in the soccer team
and the best boxer around.  Saga turns out to be a pretty tomboy who
despairs at her burgeoning breasts that will interfere with
athletics.  At the same time, attraction for Ingemar burgeons too.</P>
<P>     There is old, bedridden Mr.Sandberg, whose end is near but who
hides the equivalent of a Sears catalogue and almost swoons when he has
Ingemar read him the text that describes women's underwear.  There is
glassblower Berit, a sweet woman who looks like a younger Ellen Burstyn
and whose voluptuous figure is desired by all.  She brings out more
troubled, nascent sexuality in Ingemar when she has him accompany her
to a sculptor's where Ingemar must wait and not peek while she poses in
the nude.  On the whole, it is a good summer for Ingemar.</P>
<P>     After the boy's return home, his mother dies.  He is sent back to
the small town for good.  Following a short, painful period of
adjustment, he takes the step into adulthood, just as his namesake
triumphs in the boxing ring.</P>
<P>     We forget how marvelous it can be for a youngster to discover
that the most ordinary days can be filled with revelations and
discoveries.  In every episode, Ingemar lives the growing pains,
confusions and joys of coming of age.  He is a sober kid of few words.
He makes up for this with introspection.  His stream of
consciousness punctuates the film.  Whenever Ingemar is particularly
confused or sorrowful, the movie cuts to a star-studded sky and we hear
the boy's thoughts.</P>
<P>     Ingemar is a collector of odd facts, mostly about accidents
through which he ponders the mysteries of life and fate.  He thinks of
a train and bus collision that left five dead and fourteen wounded; of
an Evel Knievel-type daredevil motorcyclist who perished as he was
trying to jump over 31 barrels (" if there had been only 30, he would
have cleared them"); of an athlete in a stadium who was transfixed by
another's javelin throw.</P>
<P>     Ingemar talks to himself the way characters in the films of Godard
tell each other trivia and anecdotes, seemingly irrelevant but in
reality meaningful.  The meaning for Ingemar is that, after all, his
tribulations are minor: in relative terms he's not so badly off.</P>
<P>     Throughout, his constant, his leitmotif, is the story of Laika,
the dog that the Soviets sent into space and left to die among the
stars.  The boy identifies with Laika as well as with his own, absent
dog.  When particularly perplexed or annoyed, he gets down on all fours
and barks.</P>
<P>     Among the charms of MY LIFE AS A DOG is that it is sensitive
without being distancing, outlandish and cute (His Life) ; or familiar
to most viewers and maudlin (Our Life); or full of manufactured
surprises (This is Your Life).</P>
<P>     The cast is perfect.  Anton Glanzelius (Ingemar), is a homely
child with the kind of face that at first glance seems more appropriate
for The Dead End Kids or Our Gang.  Yet he gets to you within minutes
as his deep-set eyes prove what Ingmar Bergman said, that the eyes are
the mirror of the soul.  Glanzelius can convey an amazing range of
feelings through tiny changes of expression and body language.  His is
an Oscar-worthy performance.</P>
<P>     Script and direction introduce superb little details, visual and
behavioral (Ingemar takes out his alienation by chasing a potato around
his plate) or aural (the transition of sound from a vacuum cleaner to a
car engine).  Director Hallstrom's techniques--indirect, lovingly
ironical, elliptically humorous, based on razor-sharp observation--are
good enough to make you wish to see his other films.  Hallstrom's
approach is the closest thing to the methods of master filmmakers like
the Czech (now American) Milos Forman ("The Firemen's Ball"), that
other Czech Jiri Menzel ("My Sweet Little Village") or those of the
better, bittersweet Yugoslav movies.</P>
<PRE>It's a wonderful LIFE.</PRE>
