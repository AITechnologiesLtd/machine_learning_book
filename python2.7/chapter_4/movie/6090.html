<PRE>                              EXTREME MEASURES
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>This thriller is about the medical profession and, in
particular, the harm that could be done if a top doctor allows himself
to think that he has the answer that other doctors do not have.  This
allows him to experiment his theories on people who have not given him
permission . . . and if they die, they die, while he keeps on with
his experiments.</P>
<P>Dr. Guy Luthan (Hugh Grant) works in the emergency trauma
section of a hospital.  It is a madhouse in the sense that patients
are brought in from accidents, gun shots, etc. and Luthan has to make
instant decisions.  It's like a war zone.  Whom do you try to save?
If someone is obviously going to die why waste precious time on him
when you could be trying to save someone who appears may still be
savable?</P>
<P>What happens when a patient who is wearing one of those
hospital ID wristbands dies but no one can identify the hospital.  In
addition, his symptoms before he dies are very odd.  While everyone is
running around madly in the trauma ward, only Dr Luthan notices the
band and wonders what hospital had issued it.  This turns into a
mystery thriller as he attempts to track down the hospital and learn
why the man died.  Dr. Luthan feels there is something very fishy
going on and indeed there is.</P>
<P>What makes the film even more exciting is that it involves one
of the country's most famous doctors, Dr. Lawrence Myrick (Gene
Hackman).</P>
<P>Dr. Luthan's nurse is Jodie Trammel (Sarah Jessica Parker)
who works with him in the trauma ward.</P>
