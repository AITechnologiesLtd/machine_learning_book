<PRE>                     ZERAM & IRIA: ZEIRAM THE ANIMATION
                       A film review by Jon Lawrence
                        Copyright 1996 Jon Lawrence</PRE>
<P>Do not get Zeram. It is a live action movie, which they turned into a
anmation just recently called IRIA: Zeiram The Animation.</P>
<P>The basic plot of the movies are the same. IRIA is a bounty hunter, with
her computerised partner BOB, who is after the universes most dangerous
live being, the Zeram <or Zeiram>. But in the live action, the place is on
modern day Japan, where you have these 2 electricians (Japanese equivalent
to the Mario Bros.) who bump into Iria, and get sent to the Zone <an
alternative to demention to Modern day Japan). The 2 electricians get stuck
in the zone with the Zeram, and they are fighting for their lives, while
Iria is stuck in MD japan, trying to help these fool fight off the Zeram. </P>
<P>But in IRIA: Zeiram The Animation, it starts of on a the planet Mynse, with
BOB (he is human), Glen (Iria's borther) and Fujicrow (another Bounty
Hunter) doing a rescue mission on this space station where the Zeiram is
making mince meat of every one and any one. Glen disappears the explosion
of the space station. Afterward, Bod dies and get is conscience tranfered
to a computer. And Iria is now hunting the Zeiram, or is the Zeiram hunting
her? And what has happened to Glen? </P>
<P>Zeram is really stoopid. Gun Hed was far better. Zeram could be discribed
at Mario Brothers Meets ALIEN. As where IRIA: Zeiram The Animation is alot
better.</P>
