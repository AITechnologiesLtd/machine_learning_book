<P>     Michael Keaton plays a man so busy that he has to clone himself to
find enough time to work, play, and parent.  He's copied three times,
courtesy of your friendly neighborhood geneticist (Harris Yulin).  "Two"
is his aggressive side and takes charge at the office, while "Three" is
more prissy and stays home with the kids.  ("Four" is the flub; a fuzzy
copy with the mind of a child.)  Mr.  Keaton is very funny-- and
distinctly different-- in each of these roles.  He gives a command
performance that the movie doesn't know what to do with.  The best that
four (cloned?) writers could come up with are some recycled gags from
MR. MOM, a few hundred or so double takes, and one very funny sequence
involving the rule over who gets to sleep with the wife (Andie
MacDowell, looking dazed and confused even when she's not supposed to
be).  The latter is also the closest that the movie comes to having a,
uh, climax.  MULTIPLICITY attempts to end on a serious note and it
doesn't work.  Twenty minutes are wasted there.  Also curious is how
absolutely nothing is explained about the character of the scientist.
We see him in the cloning sequence and then he just disappears for the
rest of the movie.  Perhaps he's working on opening a franchise, maybe 
one called Clones 'R' Us?</P>
