<P>Woody Allen continues to make films his own way, and that is a major feat for 
an artist who has yet to have a major box-office success since "Hannah and 
Her Sisters." I am not sure "Small Time Crooks" will change all that, but let 
me be the first to report that it is one of Allen's funniest and most 
endearing films since "Bullets Over Broadway." </P>
<P>Playing a loser for the first time since I can remember, Allen stars as Ray 
Winkler, an ill-judged bank robber married to his manicurist wife, Frenchy 
(Tracey Ullman). Ray has a new plan to change his life from his current 
dishwashing activities - to rob a bank vault by tunnelling from an abandoned 
store's basement. The idea is that the store will be turned into a bakery and 
Frenchy will run it, along with her cousin, May (Elaine May). The surprise is 
that the cookies they sell become the talk of the town, and so successful 
that Frenchy and Ray become rich. Only problem is that their taste in clothes 
and furniture is garish at best ("Go on honey, show them your collection of 
leather pigs," quips Ray). Thus, Frenchy enlists the help of a British art 
dealer (Hugh Grant) who will teach her about class and elegance, and 
education. Naturally, Ray prefers the life he had and gets the impulse to 
steal all over again by scheming with May to get a priceless necklace. </P>
<P>"Small Time Crooks" made me laugh from start to finish, and I must thank the 
great writer-director Woody Allen (a comic genius, in my view). His sharp 
observations about these colorful brand of characters inspires many memorable 
one-liners, particularly the droll humor involving the typically relaxing 
charm of Hugh Grant and the high-pitched Ullman (some of it recalls the naive 
Annie Hall's dedication to reading more books and taking college courses). 
Also worth noting is the early appearance of Michael Rapaport (who was also 
in "Mighty Aphrodite") as a bumbling crook, John Lovitz as a possible 
entrepreneur who has burned down buildings to support his children's 
education, and the pleasant air of Elaine May's presence (she last appeared 
on screen in 1990's "In the Spirit") - she gives her character May a rich 
array of nuances and perfect comic timing. Her character begs the question - 
is she really smart or is she as ditsy and naive as we might think? The 
naysayers who feel that the 64-year-old Allen has been dealing with much 
younger female leads, such as Elisabeth Shue, will applaud the choice of the 
60-year-old Elaine May. Frankly, this is of little importance to me - I would 
still love to see Allen use Sharon Stone as a lead or foil.</P>
<P>Scrawny Allen is as always scrawny Allen, but here he has a slight edge ("I'd 
like to flatten you, just once") complemented with the adoration of his wife, 
Frenchy, and makes his character the most magnetic he's played in some time. 
Tracey Ullman runs hot and cold for me, but she gets to play a trashy, 
talkative, sprightly woman with an affection for her husband - we somehow 
know that things will work out between them despite her affinity for the 
suave Hugh Grant.</P>
<P>"Small Time Crooks" is not laugh-out loud funny (though there are many
sidesplitting moments but I could have done without the faux news segment) 
but it is smooth and refined, as we might expect post-"Crimes and 
Misdemeanors" or "Husbands and Wives." It is far more relaxed and kinder than 
Allen's early slapstick comedies such as "Take the Money and Run" or 
"Sleeper." I would love it if Allen returned to his more serious Bergmanesque 
period but as sheer entertainment and pointed humor, it is far more lively 
and less overstuffed than "Sweet and Lowdown" or "Celebrity." Small time 
business, to be sure, but you will have a grand time. </P>
