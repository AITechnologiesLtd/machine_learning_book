<PRE>                                MR. VAMPIRE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>     I recently have had a much appreciated opportunity to see three horror
films from Hong Kong: MR. VAMPIRE, A CHINESE GHOST STORY, and CHINESE GHOST
STORY II.  They were fun films, somewhat similar to each other in approach.
Each was heavy on the comedy aspects.  Generally I don't care much for
comedy in horror, particularly slapstick.  But I am told that Chinese
audiences really expect it and it would not be a Chinese horror film without
being tongue-in-cheek.  While horror does not get in the way of the comedy,
in my opinion comedy often damages or destroys the impact of the horror.  In
each of these films the result is a horror film that works no better (though
certainly no worse) than ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN.  While these
films have the pacing that a KWAIDAN lacks, they could afford take
themselves a little more seriously like KWAIDAN does.  Perhaps what I would
enjoy most is something between the Hong Kong approach and the KWAIDAN
approach.  It would be nice if Hong Kong were making films of the style of
Hammer Films of Britain, but that just isn't their style and probably not
what their audiences want.</P>
<P>     MR. VAMPIRE--which would more aptly be called MR. HOPPING GHOST--has
the novelty of adding a new folklore monster to the horror film, at least
new to us Americans.  I have, though, read a little about Chinese Hopping
Ghosts.  The idea is that in most dead the Po--that is the soul--has
departed for the next world.  But some corpses die with unfinished business,
for example if the body has not been buried in the corpse's home town.  In
such circumstances the Po will stay in the corpse, which will then not
decay.  For even more the corpse may get up and walk.  And when it walks it
will have superhuman strength and will kill any mortals it can get its hands
on.  Rigor mortis will, however, make the stiff, well ... stiff.  It will be
too stiff to walk, but will be able to manage a hop.  That is why a hopping
ghost hops.  So as an American seeing MR. VAMPIRE you have to be part
cultural detective as well as being a film fan.  But some of the images are
as eerie for me as they would be for someone raised with the culture.  Some
perhaps even more so since they are such alien images.  The film opens with
a scene of a row of hopping ghosts standing in a monastery, each with a
prayer paper seemingly tacked over its face.  I suspect it is as weird for
me, not knowing what it meant as it would be for someone who did.  Perhaps a
bit more.</P>
<P>     Some of the fun of seeing this film, and it is fun though faint
subtitles also make it also hard work, is in trying to figure out the rules
that apply to hopping ghosts.  If you are being stalked you can make
yourself safe as long as you neither move nor breathe.  Apparently they home
in on their victim's breath.  (How long can YOU hold your breath?)  They can
be stopped by putting some sort of inscription on a piece of paper and
attaching it to the hopping ghost's forehead.  I don't know what the
inscription says since I don't read Chinese, but I think it is a kind of
death prayer.  They cannot walk on uncooked sticky rice, probably because it
absorbs things around it (which is why restaurants will put some rice in
with the salt in shakers).  They are repelled by inscriptions written with a
mixture of Chinese ink and chicken blood.  You kill them by burning them
coffin and all.  So they do have some characteristics in common with cinema
vampires but they are not vampiric--they do not seem to suck blood.  Instead
they strangle and mutilate.</P>
<P>     I will say a bit less about CHINESE GHOST STORY 1 & 2 since they are a
somewhat better known in this country already.  In some ways they borrow a
lot from the EVIL DEAD films but they have a panache all their own.  A sort
of ne'er-do-well happens upon a haunted monastery and soon is facing ghosts
and Chinese demons.  Eventually he is has a guide through this world in the
form of a Taoist master who sings an amusing song that is a sort of
commercial for Tao.  They are sucked into another world where mythical
figures battle.  It is fast paced with variable special effects but always
watchable.  Again the worst touch is the poor subtitles, but much of the
action transcends the language barrier.  Again, as with MR. VAMPIRE, there
is a disadvantage for the Western viewer in that the rules of this universe
are foreign.  But like spiciness in some Chinese food, for some the
foreign-ness of the mythology will be a disadvantage and for others it will
be the main advantage and the greatest attraction.</P>
<P>     When I was about six years old there was a foreign-language movie
theater in the town I lived in.  I think it was Polish, but I don't remember
for sure.  And I found that frustrating because I imagined they had their
equivalent of Godzilla films and I was missing them because there was this
language barrier between me and the films.  As I got older many of these
mis-impressions became obvious to me and I realized I wasn't missing a whole
lot of great monster movies because I knew only one language.  Well, what I
am discovering is that my fears were not so foolish, they just were
premature.  Today in Asia there are a lot of good fantasy films being made,
many of which just are not making it to America for years or perhaps never
make it.  So far there are relatively few films I would miss, but the number
is clearly growing.</P>
