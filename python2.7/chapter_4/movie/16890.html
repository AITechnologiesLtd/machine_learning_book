<P>There are probably a lot of metaphors and symbolism that I just flat out
missed when I saw Chinese Box. It could have something to do with seeing
it at 9:00 AM with only 3 hours sleep, or it could just be the subject
matter which I am admittedly not an expert on.</P>
<P>The film is set in Hong Kong during the days between New Year's Eve 1996
(the last under British control) and July 1, 1997 (when China reclaimed
the province). Sounds exciting so far, right? Throw in a tiresome
romance that goes ultimately unresolved and you've got yourself two
hours of pure unadulterated fun.</P>
<P>Jeremy Irons plays John, a sickly Brit author transplanted in Hong Kong
for the last fifteen years. He's left his wife and kid back home,
presumably to pursue the love of his life, Vivian (Gong Li, Farewell My
Concubine). Vivian, a former hooker and John's ex, owns a successful
karaoke bar but wants only to marry her wealthy politician boyfriend,
Chang (Michael Hui), in order to distance herself from a dirty slutty
past. The trouble is that there is absolutely no emotional spark between
John and Vivian, and that is a fact that made me very sleepy.</P>
<P>The saving grace of Chinese Box comes from Maggie Cheung (Supercop), who
plays a street-wise con artist named Jean. John meets her while filming
a monotonous video diary of how  the impending hand-over will effect
citizens of different social pedigree. Jumpy Jean immediately intrigues
John, who squanders his days away trying to find out what makes her
tick.</P>
<P>What these two stories have to do with each other is beyond me. I guess
that I understand the basic comparison of the uncertainty of the three
main characters with the real life inhabitants of the province, but
that's a pretty weak plot. Perhaps viewers more intimate with the
subject matter may find it more passionate.</P>
<P>I'm not even sure if director Wayne Wang found that passion in his
finished product. Wang's previous efforts seem much more emotional to
me, especially The Joy Luck Club and, one of my secret guilty pleasures,
Slamdance. Don't laugh.</P>
<P>And what's the deal with Jeremy Irons career? If he's not playing a
terminally ill character (Stealing Beauty), he's in some big budget
piece of crap (Die Hard with a Vengeance and the reprehensible The Man
in the Iron Mask) or worse yet, the voice of a cartoon character (The
Lion King). Gong Li, who is widely regarded as the most beautiful woman
on the planet, is under used in her first English speaking role. Her
lines are limited and usually monosyllabic. And it is very strange to
see her wearing blue jeans. Cheung and Ruben Blades (The Devil's Own)
shine in their supporting roles.</P>
<P>To summarize, Chinese Box was about as exciting as the actual Hong Kong
hand-over. It was a lot more efficient as a three-minute sound bite
delivered by Peter Jennings.</P>
