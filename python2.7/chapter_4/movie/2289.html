<P>     The original WAYNE'S WORLD boasted a number of clever bits and
parodies glued together by a silly plotline, but at least it was
something a new, and a little different.  WAYNE'S WORLD 2 boasts far
fewer clever bits and parodies glued together by a nonsensical
plotline, and there's absolutely nothing remotely new or different
about this sequel.  It isn't appalling, but it's not worth a trip to
the theaters, either.</P>
<P>     A year has passed since the last cinematic recounting of the
adventures of Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey), the intrepid
duo from the SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE skits.  Now, the two middle-aged
post-teenagers have moved out of their parents' houses and into an
abandoned doll factory.  Neither has any idea what to do with his life,
but Wayne's search begins through a dream-meeting with Jim Morrison.
Our slumbering hero is told to organize a concert in Aurora, Illinois,
and get as many acts as he can.  "If you book them, they will come,"
promises Morrison.  So, with Garth's help, Wayne gets to work setting
things up.</P>
<P>     There are some worthwhile moments in WAYNE'S WORLD 2, but not
enough to justify the filming of a movie.  In the humorous parodies
category are a lampooning of Hong Kong chop-socky films, take-offs of
various old TV commercials (one of which occurs mid-way through the
closing credits--those who depart theaters early, take notice), and a
quick satire of a famous JURASSIC PARK scene.  Equally amusing are
sequences where Garth reacts with horror to the thought of listening to
mellow musician Kenny G, and where Wayne, Garth, and friends
impersonate the Village People.</P>
<P>     That's about it, though, and even the funniest parts are far-from-
original.  In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find anything in this
movie that's unique.  Even more unfortunate is that WAYNE'S WORLD 2 is
in the unenviable position of having been outdone by the movie preview
before it.  Packaged along with the feature presentation is a trailer
for Paramount's March release THE NAKED GUN 33 1/3, and this 90-second
gem is far better than anything that WAYNE'S WORLD 2 has to offer.</P>
<P>     In addition to Myers and Carvey, Tia Carrere also returns,
although her character is relegated to a disjointed subplot that
involves an underscripted slimeball record producer played by
Christopher Walken (who does a marvellous job acting as if he's playing
the heavy in a serious movie).  There are a number of cameos--by Kim
Basinger, Drew Barrymore, Heather Locklear, Charlton Heston, Kevin
Pollack, Olivia D'Abo, Jay Leno, Rip Taylor, Aerosmith, and others -
but few of these provide anything beyond juvenile puns and one-liners.
At times, WAYNE'S WORLD 2 tries to be like THE NAKED GUN, and falls
flat on its face.</P>
<P>     In the final analysis, WAYNE'S WORLD 2 lacks inspiration, and uses
up ninety-five minutes trying to find some.  As far as sequels go, this
is definitely not the worst of the year, and there are enough moments
to provide satisfaction to those who go in with suitably-limited
expectations, but this shtick is getting old.  This is mass-market
comedy at its least impressive.</P>
