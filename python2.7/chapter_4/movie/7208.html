                       A film review by Martun C. Winkler

<PRE>1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Absolute Power, the new film produced and directed by Clint
Eastwood, attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical
presidents and their murderous political staff. It is about as thrilling
as a lecture on the mating habits of the South American grasshopper. One
can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by
William Goldman could have ever interested Eastwood. Not only is the plot
unbelievable and contrived, but even the writing itself lacks any
consistency or intelligence. Continually underestimating the audience, the
film gives us information we already know or dont even need. Details
essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying
(like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night-vision
goggles in their car?).
        Oddly enough, the initial setup for Absolute Power offers
interesting possibilities. A masterful jewel-thief (played by Clint
Eastwood) witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire
(played by E.G. Marshall). While robbing one of Marshalls mansions, he is
forced to hide in the bedrooms vault. There, through a two-way mirror, he
sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay. Their game of
love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the
woman. In self defense, the woman grabs a letter-opener and stabs the man
in the elbow. She raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by
two secret service men. The man? He is the president of the United States
of America.
        Where does the film go wrong? It cannot be the acting. Clint
Eastwood, Ed Harris and Gene Hackman as the president give type-cast, but
decent performances. The cinematography is sufficient; wild and erratic
during action sequences, dark and mysterious during psychologically
suspenseful scenes, and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue. Even the
music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the
thriller/suspense genre.
        The fault clearly lies in the screenplay, and the screenplay
alone. While setting up a story about misuse of power, about the true
possessors of that power, and about intrigue and double-crossing, it does
not resolve it. Not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting
climax. Rather, the tense situations are left dangling at the end, giving
the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness.
        An example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a
scene: in an attempt to arrest Clint Eastwood, the police have set up a
trap at a small restaurant. Police officers are everywhere, incognito of
course. At the same time, not one but two hit men are preparing to kill
Clint Eastwood when he arrives. All three parties are unaware of each
others presence. This scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is
wondering how Clint Eastwood, who might suspect this is a trap, will get
himself out of this difficult position. He will probably have a brilliant
plan, involving ingenious preparations. However, when he arrives at the
trap, both hit men miss (how convenient) and in the confusion Eastwood
simply walks away. The buildup of this scene took about ten minutes. Ten
minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with
the police preparing for the trap. The scene was resolved in less than 20
seconds...
        Parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche
emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father Eastwood
and his daughter. The daughter blames her father for never being there for
her, because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere. Of course
their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and
they end up a happy family. Again, it is commendable that Absolute Power
tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a
dramatic subplot. However, trying is simply not enough! The second story
line should be subtle, original and preferably unpredictable... everything
this film is not.
        How could a screenplay like Absolute Power ever get the funding to
be produced? How could Eastwood, who has successfully produced and
directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant Unforgiven, ever
believe in a project like this one? I am sad to say that my respect for
the actor/director/producer has diminished substantially due to this film.
Director Quentin Tarantino once said: "I can make a good movie out of any
bad script." Director Clint Eastwood obviously cannot.</P>
