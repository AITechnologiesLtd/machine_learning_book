<PRE>.                             CONSPIRACY THEORY
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Hitting theaters shortly, with surprisingly little fanfare, is
CONSPIRACY THEORY, a very long and very scattered production which
introduces the never-before-used plotline that the government is full of
bad guys.</P>
<P>     I was intrigued at first:  as the ads tout, a conspiracy nut (Mel
Gibson) suddenly learns one of his theories is true, and everyone's out
to get him.  And in the process, he has to protect a redhead (Julia
Roberts).  That would normally be enough for me, but without spoiling
the movie for you, that just ain't what the movie is about.</P>
<P>     While the central plot twist turns out to be pretty shocking, it
can't make up for the sad reality that THEORY has an appalling script --
and most notably that the dialogue is totally ridiculous.  The film's
cinematography is painful to watch, and Gibson, who would seem perfect
for the nutcase role given his LETHAL WEAPON roots, comes off as silly
and pathetic.  Clocking in at well over two hours, THEORY quickly earns
a place on the too-much-of-a-bad-thing wall.  In the end, the movie
makes enough sense, but it leaves so many loose ends dangling that it's
hard to care.</P>
<P>     Oh well, I guess a Julia Roberts fetish can't overcome a crummy
script and bad production values after all.</P>
