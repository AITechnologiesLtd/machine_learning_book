                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Because it lacks a precise ideological agenda, CAUGHT is something 
of a departure for veteran director Robert M. Young (NOTHING BUT A 
MAN..., DOMINICK AND EUGENE, SHORT EYES), a film maker known for 
socially and politically-motivated dramas.  In fact, this is little more 
than an erotic, contemporary tale that plays like a Greek tragedy 
(OEDIPUS, to be exact).  CAUGHT crossections a dysfunctional family 
whose uncomfortable stability is disturbed by the introduction of an 
outsider.</P>
<P>     That outsider is Nick (Arie Verveen), a homeless Irish drifter 
trying to survive on the streets of Jersey City.  Luck is with Nick, for 
when he ducks into a fish store to escape the police, the owners, Joe 
(Edward James Olmos) and his wife, Betty (Maria Conchita Alonso), take 
pity on him.  They offer him a room, board, and $80 a week to work as 
Joe's assistant.  Nick accepts, not intending to stay for long.  But 
days turn into weeks, then months, and, soon, the young Irishman is more 
dear to Joe and Betty than their real son, Danny (Steven Schub), a 
failed standup comic who lives in Los Angeles.  </P>
<P>     Nick treats Joe like the father he never knew, but his feelings for 
Betty are more complex.  Although he regards her as a mother at the 
outset, he is powerless to stop a growing attraction.  Eventually, after 
one-too-many moments of hightened sexual awareness, their relationship 
is consummated.  From that point on, Nick and Betty are all over each 
other at every opportunity.  A further complication arises when Danny 
returns home with a wife and son to find that his place has been 
usurped.</P>
<P>     CAUGHT examines psychological and emotional family bonds as they 
apply to the "real" son and the "adopted" one.  The film also explores 
the most intense kind of sibling rivalry, a jealousy that is rooted in 
Oedipal impulses.  Danny has many reasons to hate Nick, but he doesn't 
go over the edge until he recognizes the sexual nature of Nick and 
Betty's relationship.  </P>
<P>     The final scenes close the story in an unforgettably stark manner.  
Although a relentless premonition of doom hangs over this picture, we're 
still not quite prepared for the brutal twist of events that marks 
CAUGHT's climax.  Even though the movie's overall arc is somewhat 
predictable, and occasionally melodramatic, it's impossible to deny the 
cumulative impact.  </P>
<P>     CAUGHT contains isolated moments of visual poetry that accomplish 
for fish displays what EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN did for food preparation.  
Joe teaches Nick the tricks of boning shad and placing snapper on ice in 
a manner that offers the greatest customer appeal.  In his words, "it's 
a gimmick -- a gimmick and an art."  Joe loves selling fish -- for him, 
it's more of a passion than a profession, and Nick's enthusiasm for it 
forms the basis of their relationship.</P>
<P>     Edward James Olmos and Maria Conchita Alonso, both of whom worked 
with Young in ROOSTERS, are in fine form.  Alonso radiates sexuality, 
and many of her scenes with newcomer Arie Verveen smolder, even when the 
two are fully clothed.  Steven Schub occasionally overplays his 
bitterness, but, in general, his portrayal of Danny is a study of grief 
and anger born through personal and professional failure.  </P>
<P>     CAUGHT opens and closes with an image of fish caught in a net, 
struggling to escape.  It's an apt metaphor, since all the characters in 
this film are trapped by fate in one way or another.  Due primarily to 
its dark, unsettling tone, CAUGHT has yet to capture a distributor.  
Hopefully, this is only a temporary condition, because thought-provoking 
tragedy like this deserves a place in American cinema.</P>
