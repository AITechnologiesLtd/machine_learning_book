<P>   A popular myth about those who kill in the heat of passion
is that they are quiet, friendless people who suddenly
explode, letting out repressions that have built up for years. 
Yet another fiction is that murderers are products of
anonymous, urban environments, misfits who are shunted
about amid the cacophony of voices, eternally lonely in the
bowels of the urban zoo.   In "The Butcher Boy," Neil Jordan,
best known for his direction of "Michael Collins," explodes
these illusions, at least in his treatment of one particularly
young, creatively intelligent, and highly sociable fellow.  With
a marvelous performance by 15-year-old Eamonn Owens in
the role of Francie, a life-of-the-party sort whose overly
cheerful and gregarious nature might make some psychiatrists
wonder what devils are lurking within, "The Butcher Boy"
explores the nature  of the killer instinct in a film co-written by
Patrick McCabe (and based on his novel), one which for quite
a while hardly seems as though it belongs to the genre of
horror.  Jordan mixes the waggery with the macabre so
successfully that the morbid and the whimsical seem to blend
together as a single species, until he takes his audience down
a grisly road with an act of murder that shocks us even as we
can predict its inevitability.</P>
<P>   The story, which appears autobiographical in that director
Jordan came of age during the era of the 1960s in which the
picture takes place, centers on Francie Brady (Eamonn
Owens), who is so outgoing and cheerful that one would not
suspect a malevolent family backdrop.  Situated in the small
Irish town of Cavan, "The Butcher Boy" follows the escapades
of the young man as narrated by Francie several years later,
a series of large and small episodes which are given equal
weight regardless of their dramatic poundage.  Nonjudgmental
to a fault, Jordan details Francie's tragic moments and
chipper experiences as though he wants to keep his audience
off guard and bemused, curious about where he is taking us
and what sort of payoff he has in mind.  The first clue we
have that all is not right under the Owens's roof is Francie's
discovery of a chair which his mother (Aisling O'Sullivan) has
positioned on a table.  His mom, her tears betraying a
profound depression and in the throes of a nervous collapse,,
begs her son not to allow her to die. This attempted suicide
lands her in the hospital.  His da (Stephen Rea) is not there
when Francie needs him most, a sickly man who is on the
sauce and thinks nothing of lashing the boy with his strap
without much provocation and kicking in the glass of a TV set
which is about dysfunctional as he.</P>
<P>   Though Francie's principal solace lies in his adventures with
his best friend Joe (Alan Boyle), his vitality and well-being are
continually undermined by the malicious gossip of the
neighbors, particularly the disapproving observations and
reflections of the snobbish Mrs. Nugent (Fiona Shaw), whose
bookish son is the object of Francie's contempt.  Entirely
committed to defending the honor his family, Francie
collapses emotionally when he is betrayed by his pal Joe,
who turns into an obedient mamma's boy when confronted
with the pressure of disapproving adults.</P>
<P>   The title comes from Francie's occupation as a cleaner in a
slaughterhouse for pigs, the butchery serving as metaphor for
the horrors which Jordan has in store for us as he piled on
the tensions and urgencies of his young protagonist.  </P>
<P>   Using Adrian Biddle's camera to capture both the lush
splendor of the emerald isle and the claustrophobic confines
of the rural village, Jordan makes insistent use of surrealist
imagery to portray the fantasy life to which Francie
increasingly turns.  Shots of the atomic bomb's mushroom
clouds mirror the young man's explosive energies while visits
from the Blessed Virgin (Sinead O'Connor) provide at least
temporary reassurance to his troubled soul.  The Ireland of
the 1960s is not the jolly land of leprechauns and blarney
stones but an island nation filled with pathologies from both
families and institutions.  As Francie begins to lose it, he is
shunted to various establishments, in one case receiving
brutal shock treatments for trashing the home of his worst
enemy, in another suffering the physical abuse of the priest in
charge of a reform school.  </P>
<P>  As a coming-of-age drama, "The Butcher Boy" will inevitably
be compared to classics like "Amarcord" (Fellini's poignant
and funny nostalgic trip to Italy of his youth in the 1930s) and
"The 400 Blows" (Truffaut's captivating study of Parisian youth
who turn to a life of small-time crime in reaction to derelict
parents).  Jordan adds the hypocrisies and fancies of the
people of Ireland to the joyful and trenchant qualities
embraced by the citizens of France and Italy, and in doing so
enriches the cinema's vocabulary with his stellar cast
portraying his country's diverse and all-too-human population.
