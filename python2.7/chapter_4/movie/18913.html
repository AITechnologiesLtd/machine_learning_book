<P>(Dialog in Bengali, English subtitles)</P>
<P>This film is also known by the English title "The Lonely Wife".</P>
<P>Ambition can be blinding.  Bhupati Dutta (Shailen Mukherjee) is a
wealthy man who pours all his efforts into running his political
newspaper in colonial India of the 1870's. He is an intelligent,
trusting, and gentle man, but the total immersion in his work has
isolated him from his beloved wife, Charulata (Madhabi Mukherjee).
Charulata loves Bhupati, so she does not attempt to pry him away
from his newspaper. As a result, she endures a lonely existence
in their large Calcutta house. When Bhupathi finds that his young
cousin Amal (Soumitra Chatterjee) is floundering in his studies,
Bhupathi invites him to join them, and perhaps help with the paper
and gain some focus. Amal arrives (symbolically, along with a storm),
and it is immediately apparent that the two men are very different.
Bhupathi is serious and dismisses sentimental literature for the
stolid political discussion of his paper. The mercurial Amal cannot
be tied down with responsibility. Bhupathi asks Amal to pay
Charulata the attention that he himself has been neglecting to give
her, perhaps even encouraging her to write. Bhupathi is unaware of
the potential danger of mixing a new dynamic into a strained
relationship. Inevitably, Charulata will be drawn to the attention
she craves.</P>
<P>Satyajit Ray takes this simple, straight-forward story and makes
it a rich, complete film by interweaving many layers of symbolism.
>From the initial scene, where we see the cloistered Charulata
embroidering a handkerchief for her absentee husband and observing
the outside world through viewing glasses, it is apparent that
every component of the film is telling a story. When Charulata
tellingly peers at Bhupati, who is pacing and lost in thought,
that single action immediately gives a snapshot of their
relationship with not a word spoken.</P>
<P>This story, by Rabindranath Tagore, is simple and familiar, but
because of its many nuances, it becomes fresh and engaging. It is
no surprise that Charulata becomes attached to Amal. What is
engrossing is how the relationships are represented on multiple
levels. Bhupati is not a bad person. His failing is that he is
living in a sphere that cannot be shared with his wife. He feels
that the only meaningful writings are the sober political opinions
that he espouses in his newspaper, in English. Charulata is also
educated, but does not have any interest in the serious writing of
her husband. Her interests lay in Bengali literature, in emotional
writing which is dismissed by Bhupati. When Amal writes a poetic
story that he shares with Charulata, it is a deep meaningful
gesture. It is an act of sharing and inclusion that the emotionally
hungry Charulata is longing for.</P>
<P>Class plays an interesting role in the nature of the characters.
Bhupati comes from a wealthy family, so he is free to spend his
time in pursuit of his avocation. As a man of high standing, he
is able to take a daring political stand and speak out on issues
in Britain that affect colonial India. Charulata, on the other
hand, is almost a prisoner. Although they live in a large
comfortable house with a beautiful garden, it is her whole world
because she never goes outside. It is actually very lonely for her
and the only company she has is her younger, immature sister-in-law.
All these factors escape Bhupati, and he is not aware that Charulata
only needs a small piece of him. He is so self-absorbed that he does
not even try to construct a world in which both he and his wife can
live.</P>
<P>The story is neither sentimental nor cathartic. It simply attempts
to put a relationship under a microscope to view it in full depth.
The explored themes are universal.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. Satyajit Ray is a the height of his talent in
crafting this film. It is a complex, multilayered story, but the
presentation is kept simple and compelling.</P>
