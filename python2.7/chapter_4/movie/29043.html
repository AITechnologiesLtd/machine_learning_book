<P>When films that take place during a specific period of time aren't released
theatrically during that same specific period of time, it's usually a bad
sign.  You know, like a movie about Mardi Gras coming out in September.  Or
a film about a dysfunctional family's Thanksgiving dinner that bows in May.
Or Reindeer Games.  The usual scenario is that the finished film sucks, so
release plans are scrapped, expectations are lowered and fingers are crossed
that nobody will notice anything is afoul.</P>
<P>Even though Disney's new animated film, Recess: School's Out, is set during
summer vacation (and being released in February), there still seemed to be
some potential for quality.  The film is based on a (supposedly) popular
Saturday morning cartoon, and its crew reads like a who's who of smart
animated comedies (director Chuck Sheetz has worked on The Simpsons and King
of the Hill, while writers Joe Ansolabehere, Jonathan Greenberg and Paul
Germain have served time on shows like Daria, Rugrats and Duckman).  And
there's a slew of interesting voice talent on board as well.  In theory,
Recess looked promising.</P>
<P>In practice, it's a whole different story.  Recess is as weak as an
asthmatic second-grader with glasses, a cowlick and a retainer, and it packs
the comedic punch of a devastating Third World earthquake.  The film opens
on the last day of classes at the 3rd Street School, where children and
teachers alike are celebrating their impending freedom.  We're introduced to
the school's principal, Vance Prickly (Dabney Coleman); a mean, old teacher
with sharp, kid-eating teeth (April Winchell); and, most importantly,
Recess' six main characters, who make up the typical cross-section of
Anytown, USA.</P>
<P>There's the fat kid (he's going to opera camp - Robert Goulet provides his
singing voice), the black kid (he's headed for baseball camp), the nerdy kid
(space camp) and the runty kid (military camp).  And then there's the
wrestling-camp-bound "other" kid (you know the one - can't tell if it's a
boy or a girl, Asian or Latino, and it wears a hat like Dumb Donald on Fat
Albert).  T.J. (Andy Lawrence), Recess' cool kid, isn't going away to camp
and, in his boredom, stumbles on a completely ludicrous adventure.</P>
<P>It seems that an evil former principal (James Woods), hell-bent on
instituting a worldwide ban on summer vacation, has taken over the school
and plans to knock the moon out of orbit with a giant laser beam.  If that
sentence made sense to you, perhaps your medication is wearing off.  T.J.,
with the help of his hot older sister (Melissa Joan Hart), smuggles his
friends from their various camps to do battle with the maniacal villain.
Will they be able to save the day?  I've got a feeling things will probably
work out, and the madcap finale will somehow involve the unique talent of
each of the six kids.</P>
<P>In what appears to be an attempt to keep bored parents interested, Recess is
packed full of songs from the '60s (including Goulet's bizarre rendition of
The Lemon Pipers' "Green Tambourine"), but, strangely enough, doesn't
include the Alice Cooper standard that shares the same name as the film.
The animation is shoddy, save the cool opening shot of the town that
descends onto the 3rd Street School playground.  Most of the celebrity guest
voices are over before you know what hit you, which will likely cause a lot
of head-scratching when the closing credits finally (and mercifully) begin
to roll. I totally missed people like Diedrich Bader, Dan Castellaneta,
Andrea Martin, Nick Turturro and about ten others.  What's the point of
getting (semi) famous talent to provide voices if nobody is going to notice?</P>
<P>Come to think of it, what's the point, period?</P>
