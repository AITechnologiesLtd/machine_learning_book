<P>Arthur Miller's play from the 1950's entitled 'The Crucible' was a very
timely play indeed in wake of the McCarthy hearings in the United States
designed to root out communists and which many of its critics termed a "witch
hunt."  The setting for this movie is Salem, Massachusetts in 1692 and the
root of this play is literally a witch hunt involving adultery, conscience,
betrayal and relentless evil.  Daniel Day-Lewis stars as John Proctor, a man
trying to save the honor and life of his patronizing wife (Joan Allen) who is
a woman of moral conduct and devotion to her husband.  An inquest conducted
by a British magestrate (Paul Scofield) in a chilling and commanding
performance which should snag him an Oscar nomination seeks to root out the
presence of Satan not only in Proctor's wife but presumably in the character
of a young woman (Winona Ryder) and other members of her group who meet in
secret ritual fashion.  The penalty for being convicted of any association
with Satan is death by hanging.  Ryder's character had an adulterous affair
with John Proctor and now seeks to destroy his marriage by aiding in the
conviction of his wife all the while trying to prove her own innocence.
 Director Nicholas Hytner ('The Madness of King George') fashions an
electrifying yet plain look to this film which is in keeping with Miller's
story and the entire cast shines with emotion and passion.  I was impressed
with the way this movie was able to avoid any pretentious conclusion as it
makes its point clearly and then exits appropriately.  One of 1996's most
well acted pieces. </P>
