<PRE>                                 BATMAN RETURNS
                       A film review by Sarah M. Elkins
                        Copyright 1992 Sarah M. Elkins</PRE>
<P>BATMAN RETURNS:        sequel to the box-office success BATMAN; directed again by
Tim Burton.</P>
<P>Plot/kick-off:        A bit messy and complicated to try to explain; a new set of
villains trying to take over Gotham City during the Christmas season,
plus the destructive Catwoman; a few subplots that are left hanging at
the end, but only if you think about them.  Despite the variety of
things going on, it all hangs together pretty well.</P>
<P>Characters/acting: Once again, the same mistake is made as in BATMAN:
the villains upstage Batman; at least the villains are more interesting
this time (but then, I've never been a big Nicholson fan).  I had my
doubts about Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, but she was perfect*, from
the way she twitches her whip like a cat's tail, to her portrayal of
Selina's realization of her own disintegration while dancing with Bruce.
Smart, intriguing dialogue between her and Bruce/Batman, and her and the
Penguin.  Danny DeVito is okay as the Penguin.  Chris Walken was not as
over-the-edge as the psychotic he played in A VIEW TO A KILL, but the
loving father-son corporate villains angle added a fresh twist.</P>
<P>Cinematography/FX: Sort of a combo of BATMAN and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS;
still, a few new shots that I thought were pretty spectacular (watch the
neon letters in Selina's apartment and the pullback the first time she's
in costume).  Actually, I thought extra attention must have been placed
on good acrobatics/stunts (all those flips and kicks etc.); they
impressed me a little more than the gizmos, though they may have been
slightly overused.  The last shot was disappointingly obvious, though.</P>
<P>Score/Sound: Score by Danny Elfman again; pretty similar, except for a
cool closing song, "Face to Face" performed by Siouxsie and the
Banshees; no Prince this time.</P>
<P>Violence/Gore: Lots of flying bullets and bodies, but no buckets o'
blood; the gore  was in short intense scenes, which I thought was pretty
well calculated to make the audience start to squirm, but not
overplayed, except perhaps too many close-ups of the Penguin's
disgusting oozing-black teeth (though they don't beat out Willem Dafoe's
in WILD AT HEART).</P>
<P>Language: Lots of use of bi***; also some pretty overt suggestions of
and references to sex by the Penguin.</P>
<P>Skin/situations: Implied fondling (cut off by camera angle), some
kissing</P>
<P>Analysis: Despite a few continuity errors and problems with internal
logic, I found it pretty easy to suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride.
I liked it better than BATMAN, probably because I thought the first
one dragged.  I might even go back and see it again for a matinee or
when it hits the cut-rate theaters.</P>
