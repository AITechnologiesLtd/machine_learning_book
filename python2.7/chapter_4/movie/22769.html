Reviewed by Dustin Putman, January 21, 2000.</P>
<P>At first glance at the cast list, one may instantly become under the 
impression that "Down to You" is a "teen" movie. There's Freddie Prinze, Jr. 
("She's All That"), Julia Stiles ("10 Things I Hate About You"), Selma Blair 
("Cruel Intentions"), Shawn Hatosy ("Outside Providence"), Rosario Dawson 
("Light It Up"), and Ashton Kutcher (TV's "That '70s Show"). Times, how they 
are a' changin', as all of these actors have graduated from being in high 
school to college, and the finale is even set after college graduation. What 
has remained the same, however, are the maturity levels of the characters, 
most of which rarely act like adults, but rather twentysomethings who are 
still stuck in their high school days. </P>
<P>Told in flashback as the two central characters annoyingly chatter away 
directly at the screen, discussing how their relationship blossomed, and then 
ultimately welted away, it is clear Al Connelly (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), an 
aspiring chef, and Imogen (Julia Stiles), a talented artist, are still in 
love with each other, so we are forced to sit around for ninety minutes until 
their inevitable reconciliation. Any film with such a predictable premise 
can, of course, still work, but it is vital that the writing be sharp, the 
actors appealing, and the plot developments satisfying and involving. One out 
of three isn't too bad, considering that it is January, the usual dumping 
ground for films that the studios have little confidence in, and that the 
other two 2000 movies I've seen ("Next Friday" and "Supernova") have been 
haphazard, to put it mildly.</P>
<P>When a film uses the vexatious gimmick of characters narrating the story as 
they talk squarely to the camera, the technique is usually a sign of 
amateurishness and desperation on the filmmaker's part. First-time 
feature-film director Kris Isacsson also wrote the screenplay to "Down to 
You," and you can easily tell it's a novice effort, as its approach to the 
subject matter is often shallow, uneven, or just a plain, old bad idea (Al 
talking to a spider in the middle of a supposed-to-be dramatic montage pops 
instantly to mind). The relationship between Al and Imogen, which the film 
centers entirely around, is one that isn't nearly developed enough to be 
fully engaging. After a couple charming early sequences where they "get to 
know each other," an overwhelming number of scenes between the two take place 
in bed, and since this is a PG-13 movie we're talking about, the proceedings 
come off as acutely tame, and rarely ever push the plot forward.</P>
<P>As Al and Imogen, Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Julia Stiles have winning chemistry 
with one another, but Stiles consistently acts Prinze, Jr. right off the 
screen. Clearly, a refreshingly bright talent, Stiles has been a standout in 
both last spring's superior "10 Things I Hate About You" and this film, and 
is able to inquire an added level of layers to her character of Imogen. We 
care for Imogen, and what happens with her, because she is an intelligent, 
sweet-natured young woman with ideas and goals for herself. In contrast, 
Prinze, Jr. is undeserving of his recent rising popularity. Frequently wooden 
or unable to sell the lines of dialogue he is given, his very limited thesp 
abilities are even more noticeable next to Stiles. Due to this, Al isn't a 
believable character, and next to Imogen, he seems intellectually lacking. 
What Imogen sees in Al outside of his cute physical appearance never is made 
particularly clear, and that is probably because Isacsson was unsure himself 
while penning the uneven script.</P>
<P>The supporting characters are almost unanonymously badly handled, with only 
Zak Orth and Shawn Hatosy, as Al's best friends, turning in something 
resembling more than one dimension. Orth, especially, makes quite an 
impression as Monk, a quirky pornography filmmaker whom Al is always going to 
for advice. Throughout the picture, up until his final scene, Orth is 
gradually able to unveil Monk's human side, and there is a very subtle 
development late in that is the one surprising element of the film, and 
actually makes perfect sense when you think back on his earlier scenes. 
Hatosy has less to do, but is a naturalistic actor, one that never 
disappoints, no matter how limiting his role is (and let's face it, it is very
 limited here). Meanwhile, Selma Blair, as Cyrus, a part-time student/adult 
film actress, is criminally wasted and only sketchily written, while Rosario 
Dawson, as Imogen's party-girl friend Lana, has even less to do.</P>
<P>"Down to You" is saved from being a total washout because of its final ten 
minutes, which hint at the possible depth and perceptiveness that the rest of 
the film is sorely lacking in its topics of true love and lasting 
relationships. The actors all have the ability to give strong performances, 
as they have in the past (except for Prinze, Jr., who hasn't proven anything 
to me yet), but either they are brought down by the unskillful writing, or by 
not even being given the chance to create flesh-and-blood characters. For 
example, Blair's Cyrus, we sense, is an individual hiding her insecurities 
just underneath the surface--a possibly intriguing subplot that the film 
frustratingly bypasses. For all of its attractive attributes, "Down to You" 
never rises above being merely skin-deep.</P>
