<PRE>                   HALFAOUINE: CHILD OF THE TERRACES
                  A film review by Thomas E. Billings
                   Copyright 1991 Thomas E. Billings</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
A kind-hearted story of the coming-of-age of a 12-year-old boy in modern
Tunisia.  Provides a rare look into sensuality and sexuality in modern
Arab societies.  Charming, frequently witty and funny, and very
entertaining.</P>
<P>Tunisia/France (English subtitles), color, 1990, 98 minutes.
Director/Writer: Ferid Boughedir</P>
<P>     The story centers on Noura, a 12 year old boy who is small for his
age.  Because of his size and appearance, he is still permitted to
accompany his mother to the women's bathhouse.  Inasmuch as Noura is
feeling the first desires associated with puberty, the baths are centers
of eroticism to him, as they are full of naked/partially naked women.
(I wonder whether the film was screened uncensored, i.e., including
nudity, in Tunisia?)</P>
<P>     However, Noura is growing up, and he will soon be banished from the
women's baths, and the society of women, into the much harsher society
of men.  The story line centers on Noura's exploits as he explores his
new and growing sexual desires.  Typical of "hormone comedies," he has
(two) male friends who are a bad influence on him, and encourage him to
engage in various types of mischief.  Noura's entry into the world of
men is helped by two women: his mother's cousin, and a beautiful young
woman hired as a maid in Noura's household.</P>
<P>     Because of religious sensitivities, films from Arab countries
usually cannot be as frank about sexuality and sensuality as Western
films.  In some ways that can be good, because it can force the
filmmakers to use humor or wit to compensate.  An example is the film
THE CITADEL, an extremely funny and witty film about polygamy and the
effects of uncontrolled sexual desire.  What makes HALFAOUINE
interesting is the direct view it provides of sexuality and sensuality
in an Arab culture.  The view is generally kind-hearted, and relatively
upbeat.</P>
<P>     In an interview published in the San Francisco International Film
Festival Program Guide, the director, Ferid Boughedir explains his
treatment of sexuality: "It has always fascinated me how everyday
sensuality has always belied the inflexibility of official dogma....  At
a time when cliches about the Arab culture are becoming as arbitrary as
ever, I am tempted to talk about a Mediterranean society that can still
be experienced today, a society that is luxuriant and tender, where
humor and eroticism are always prevalent together with tolerance -- a
word rather difficult to brandish about today."</P>
<P>     The film has been compared to MY LIFE AS A DOG, another story of a
young boy's coming-of-age.  However, HALFAOUINE is more upbeat, and does
not have the melancholy spirit of MY LIFE AS A DOG.  Of the two films, I
strongly prefer HALFAOUINE, for its pleasant humor and wit.</P>
<P>     Because of its pleasant humor and wit, I recommend the film to a
general audience.  Overall, the movie rates in the very good/excellent
range.</P>
