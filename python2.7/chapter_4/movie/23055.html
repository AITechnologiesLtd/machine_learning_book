<PRE>Cell Phone Mania
Hanging Up</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>An over-burdened Meg Ryan runs around town tending to everyone else's needs,
but her own. She remains mostly in good humor while doused with an
inharmonious silly physical comedy. Example: The phone rings and Meg answers
the TV remote.</P>
<P>Meg's Father (Matthau) is hilariously incoherent too deeply touching too
terminally ill. "How is it that a man can't recognize his own pants, but he
remembers his daughter's phone number." Matthau is wonderful, without him
"Hanging up" would have been completely "Disconnected." Kudrow, Keaton and
Ryan all give strong performances.</P>
<P>Aside from some early exposition, the dialogue is very good, very
re-written, and sharply detailed; however, the story line feels like a first
draft. What happens to Meg's kids as she tends to everyone else? After the
first 15 minutes, they're gone. We're teased into anticipating a plane crash
that never happens. And an interesting character (Dr. Amond) is left
undeveloped and un-used.</P>
<P>The intent was to portray a slice of the life of a good person with a
bleeding heart personality who is totally exhausting herself, but the
byproduct of that is ... we get exhausted along with her.</P>
<P>You might lose some sympathy when Meg tears a page from a public phone book
while driving to her estranged mother's house. Besides being a bit out of
character, that is so rude! What about the next person whose mother's maiden
name starts with the same letter?</P>
<P>In the end we have a film that touches on Meg's relationships with her
sisters and with her father and with herself in a on-again-off-again
humorous way, but without a great story to hold onto.</P>
