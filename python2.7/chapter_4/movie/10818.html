<PRE>GREAT EXPECTATIONS
 By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 20th Century Fox
 Director:  Alfonso Cuaron
 Writer:  Mitch Glazer  
 Cast: Ethan Hawke, Robert De Niro, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne
Bancroft</PRE>
<P>   They say that what makes a classic is a work's ability to
transcend its own time period--to set out universal truths
about human nature. The trouble with that idea is that ALL
works assert concepts that go beyond their own eras.  So
then, what makes "Macbeth" universal is not the swordplay,
which mires it in its own time period, but its views on the
nature of politics and greed.  But if that's true, then why not
say that any soap opera is a classic since every story on
afternoon TV will undoubtedly deal with envy, lust, greed,
and/or revenge?</P>
<P>   In any case, "Great Expectations," which might look remote
from our time period (despite its reference to universal ideas)
if done as a museum piece, shows its timelessness in Mitch
Glazer's overhaul adaptation of the Charles Dickens story.  To
avoid tonguetwisters, even the names have been changed:
out with Magwitch, Miss Havisham and England; in with Pip
and Florida and New York.</P>
<P>   Name changes are not the principal difference between
Dickens's work and Mitch Glazer's script.  In perhaps his most
popular work, the 19th century author underscored the
changes that money engendered in the life of Pip, an orphan
and the unwanted ward of his harsh sister.  Brought up
lovingly by his brother-in-law, Joe--who manages to retain his
selfless affection for Pip--the young man is corrupted by
receipt of a large sum of money from an unknown source,
moving him from a poor cottage in England's marsh country
to the position of a London dandy.  He becomes a snob,
ashamed of his backwoods brother-in-law and uncomfortable
in his presence.  Ultimately finding out the identity of his
benefactor--whom he has assumed to be the fabulously rich
and vindictive Miss Havisham--he waxes older and wiser,
acknowledges Joe as the kind man who gave him so much
love when he was a boy, and thus redeemed is able once
again to pursue his childhood sweetheart.</P>
<P>   This scenario was for the most part honored by David
Lean's 1946, 4-star movie, considered by some one of the
greatest films ever made, unmatched by the 1974 revival
and the 1934 predecessor.  The current version highlights the
change which softened the radiant ice-princess now known as
Estella.  The niece of the fabulously rich and terminally dotty
Miss Dinsmore, Estella has been brought up to be like a
female Chad, the villainous yuppie in the remarkable 1997
movie, "In the Company of Men." Estella's mission in life is to
act seductively toward men until they fell in love with her, and
then to dump them.  She is a tease, the sort of woman known
in some circles by a more vulgar expression.  Since her aunt
had been left at the altar some 30 years earlier, a traumatic
experience which Miss Dinsmore never got over, the rich old
lady now uses her niece to extract vengeance against the
entire male gender.  When Dinsmore invites the 11-year-old
Finn to her lavish home, known as Paradiso Perduto, she
warns the handsome youth not to fall in love with Estella lest
he be terribly hurt by her in time.  Staggered by the kiss he
receives from the young Estella while both drink from a
fountain, Finn falls instantly in love and is determined to marry
this comely blond goddess.</P>
<P>   "Great Expectations" is certainly not the Masterpiece
Theater type of production one might expect from the title, but
cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki pulls out the stops with
his exquisitely made production, which is designed with great
chic by Tony Burrough.  Directed by Alfonso Cuaron at an
appropriately relaxed pace, the narrative moves forward
insistently, albeit without many surprises, tracing the cycles of
life of its chief characters.  With many of Dickens's incidental
persons deleted in the interest of keeping the show under two
hours, Cuaron keeps the movie's theme uppermost in our
minds: how will the lives of Finnegan Bell (Ethan Hawke) and
Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow) touch, part, and reunite?  The
movie features some dazzling scenes, particularly one in
which Estella visits Finn to pose for the artist's sketches,
strips completely to Finn's astonishment, and at the
conclusion of the session simply leaves without so much as a
touch.  In yet another erotically-charged display, Estella asks
Finn to take her out of a party and to his home, where she
seductively invites his embrace and once again suddenly
departs. The movie's opening scene--which in the David Lean
version is a knockout in an English graveyard--becomes a
scary one in the Florida waters as the 11-year-old Finn is
surprised by an escaped death-row convict, Lustig (Robert De
Niro) who swears Finn to secrecy and is helped by the lad in
his escape.</P>
<P>   Ann Bancroft's performance as the loopy Miss Dinsmore
overshadows the rest of the cast.  As a hermit in her
mansion--in which all clocks have been stopped to designate
the moment she was stood up at the alter--she dances with
her young guest like a flaky Auntie Mame, made up to appear
twenty years older as she alternately coaxes Finn to make
nice with her niece and alerts him to the dangers of such
courtship.  Ethan Hawke is no match for Bancroft.  Ideal for
the role of the spirited Vincent in "Gattaca," Hawke is too
limited to portray Finn's metamorphosis from backwoods
fisherman to art-world ingenue and is likewise swallowed by
the lovely, resonant performance of Gwyneth Paltrow as the
adult Estella.  De Niro's final scene in the New York subways
is even less believable than his initial foray in the Florida
waters, but Chris Cooper is adept as the kindly but decidedly
un-classy Joe.</P>
<P>   Francesco Clemente's drawings of Estella are among the
highlights of this generally opulent but somewhat strained and
sentimental rendering of the Dickens classic.  Rated R.
