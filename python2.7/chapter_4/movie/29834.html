<P>So, what do you do when the very first scene in a movie has you rolling
your eyes...and you've barely made it through the credits?</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**)
Impulsive Cool Dude Joe (Bruce Willis) and his Neurotic Hypochondriac
Buddy Terry (Billy Bob Thornton) are escaped cons [roll] on the run, who
decide - rather, Joe decides on the cuff; the more careful Terry just
hangs on for the ride - to get back into the bank robbing business.
Needing to come up with a plan, they settle on a scheme to make enough
money doing bank heists to front a legit restaurant business in Mexico.
Being Gentlemen Bandits, they decide to take the unusual tack of
kidnapping bank managers and their families the night before a holdup,
taking them to the bank the next morning, thus causing as little
disruption as possible.  It is in Mom & Pop USA's homes where Hilarity
begins to Ensue.</P>
<P>The duo becomes a trio when Terry is nearly run over by almost equally
neurotic (and definitely sex-starved) Bored Housewife Kate (Cate
Blanchett), who pisses Terry off and melts over Cool Dude Joe's Manly
Manliness [roll]. They grow into a foursome when Joe brings on his
Braindead Stuntman Cousin Harold (Troy Garity) to drive the getaway car
[ooh roll].</P>
<P>Meanwhile, this unnecessarily long flick is further elongated by a
completely unnecessary "America's Most Wanted" take off, with Bobby
Slaton as a reporter tracking the "notorious" Sleepover Bandits, and
their supposed hostage Kate, across Oregon and Califunny, to what could
be their ultimate showdown.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
It is my custom to give my readers a "spoiler" warning, since any plot
info I divulge in "The Story" might be something for which the audience
did not want to be forewarned.  I needn't have bothered with BANDITS,
though.  This movie is actually its own self-contained spoiler, leaving
traces of itself all over the theater floor.  I wasn't surprised by a
single frame of it, not for one millisecond.  Every plot device,
inanimate or human, was clearly recognized for what it was from the time
it showed on-screen.  Forget the "too much information! They've shown
all the best bits!" trailers in the weeks before its release; BANDITS
spoiled *itself*.</P>
<P>In more ways than one.  I'll admit that I lost interest in this train
wreck early on, when Joe got all High And Mighty about being called out
his name by Kate when she chided him about stealing hard-earned moolah
from The Little People.  'Nonsense!', spewed Joe; 'this bank money is
FDIC-insured, I'm just stealing from the government who stole from us'.
PeeYEW, who left that fetid meat out on the editing table?</P>
<P>The only reason BANDITS doesn't get my full redlight wrath is because
you gotta love somebody named Billy Bob who doesn't also have most of
his teeth missing, fly a rebel flag at a civil rights picnic, and have a
broke down trailer for a home.  As often happens, Billy Bob Thornton
plays the only interesting character in the bunch.  His Terry is the
only one - and I do mean the! only! one! - I didn't feel like taking a
baseball bat to every time he opened his mouth.  And even then, Billy
Bob Thornton's presence just barely moved this flick to yellowlight
territory.  I especially cringed at e-v-e-r-y  s-i-n-g-l-e  m-o-v-e by
Kate; then again, Cate Blanchett tends to have that effect on me.
Terry's neuroses made him interesting, in a way that Joe's and Kate's
didn't even come close to, not to mention Harold the ObDoofus.  I found
myself cursing the day that Barry Levinson ever saw Wills and Blanchett
and thought, "aha!"</P>
<P>Not that Levinson - former writer, director, and producer of TSFKABDSOT
(ask somebody), HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET - gets a pass.  Indeed, I
blame him most, especially for that bile-inducing payoff at the end.
Come on, guy, you once wrote for HOMICIDE cops on TeeVee; you *know*
better than that!  Shame on you, Levinson.</P>
<P>An internet friend of mine (who, coincidentally, is a member of the same
ex-"Homicide" list I'm on) asked me if I thought the "Once Upon A Time
In China" parody movie IRON MONKEY, was over-the-top.  My response?
True story or not, given the crap that BANDITS asks its viewers to
believe about Mom And Pop USA eagerly welcoming these bandits into their
homes...well, give me "over-the-top" for $200, Alex.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:</P>
<P>     [...or, "watch Bammer piss some people off"]</P>
<P>Every now and then, I like to play a game called "Imagine It With Black
folks".  Wanna play?  Sure you do.</P>
<P>"Imagine Joe and Terry as Black bank robbers, traipsing across the
countryside, robbing banks and being generally thought of as Charming
Goofs...and no one ever calls the cops."  Can ya see it?</P>
<P>Then again, I can't really see this mess with *White* folks, so...</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
You mean, I dragged myself out of my Warm Comfortable Bed on a rainy
Sunday morning for *this*?  Bah.</P>
<PRE>BANDITS (rating: yellowlight):</PRE>
<P>BANDITS stole two hours and three minutes of my life.  I'd like it back,
please.</P>
