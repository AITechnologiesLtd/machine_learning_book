<PRE>AS GOOD AS IT GETS
**** OF **** grade is A-</PRE>
<P>Jack Nicholson gave one of his best performances in the James L. Brooks
masterpiece Terms Of Endearment.  Now almost 15-years later Nicholson is
back with Brooks in As Good As It Gets, a wonderful new film.  The
audience is so used to Jack's face that almost every time he raises an
eyebrow we erupt in laughter.</P>
<P>Nicholson plays Melvin an obsessive-compulsive writer of more than 60
successful romantic novels.  His next door neighbor is a gay artist
named Simon (Kinnear) who is financial trouble and has one cute dog. 
Nicholson eats every day at a restaurant and will only be served by
Karol a waitress with a chronically ill child.  </P>
<P>The acting in this film is great, but the brilliance of As Good As It
Gets lies in the writing.  This film is by co-written (and directed) by
James L. Brooks, a man that I cannot over-praise.  He has proven to be
one of the very best comedy writers alive.  This film's dialogue
sparkles and the main story maintains max quality while never falling to
sitcom shenanigans.</P>
<P>Many critics knocked the ending of this film, which maintains the fact
that As Good As It Gets is a romantic-comedy.  The entire film is unique
and uncompromising until the ending that is a bit of a let down.  It
almost has the feeling of studio handled end, that comes about after a
negative preview screening.  The ending doesn't stop the film from being
great but it does make it fall short of Brooks' 80s masterpieces.</P>
