<P>   The troubles in Northern Ireland have been going since
1969, the term referring to the effort by Catholics living there,
particularly by militant organizations like the Irish Republican
Army, to force out the British troops whom they consider an
army of occupation.  As shown in Jim Sheridan's
straightforward yet highly emotional and visceral movie "The
Boxer," the city of Belfast looks bombed out, and what's more
the hapless metropolis is separated into East and West
districts by sandbags and checkpoints with British troops on
patrol to check I.D. cards of those passing through.  You
wonder why the Catholics don't move to Ireland, the
Protestants, perhaps, to London.  Danny Flynn (Daniel
Day-Lewis), the film's quietly intense hero, explains in his
typically terse manner: This is my home.  Not only does
Danny choose not to move to London where he could pursue
a promising career in the boxing ring: he returns from a
British prison where he has served a fourteen-year sentence
for IRA activities, and when he finds his flat sealed with
stones, he takes a sledgehammer to the shelter and re-opens
it for occupancy.  Not that Danny has retained a
dyed-in-the-wool yearning for the city of Belfast.  He has
returned from jail, from a sentence he could have avoided if
he had only mentioned names of his co-conspirators, to
reclaim the woman he romanced in his teen years and who
remained in his mind throughout his incarceration.</P>
<P>   With "The Boxer," Daniel Day-Lewis, an Oscar recipient
from his role in "My Left Foot," is once again collaborating
with his favorite director, Jim Sheridan, perhaps the most Irish
of all filmmakers from a land actors, writers, and storytellers. 
This time Day-Lewis is teamed up with a marvelous English
actress, the thirty-year-old Emily Watson, who turned in a
magnificent performance as an eccentric Scottish 19-year-old
in "Breaking the Waves," and the chemistry is palpable.  As
the unhappy wife of Danny's best friend who insists that her
marriage was "over" before her son Liam was born, Maggie
(Emily Watson) is herself in a kind of imprisonment.  Since
her husband--who was Danny's best friend--is now a political
prisoner of the British, her activities are scrutinized by the
whole community.  Her Catholic neighbors, whether highly
politicized or not, believe that any fooling around by women in
her circumstances would demoralize them in their struggle
against the Brits.  The sexual tension between Danny and
Maggie remains in the foreground of this complex film
as Danny, who has barely uttered two words to his long-time
sweetheart because of his emotional bottling up in prison,
gradually warms up once again to Maggie while realizing that
the two can barely touch without bringing on the
condemnation of the neighbors, and even worse, severe
punishment from the IRA.</P>
<P>   Jim Sheridan succeeds in bringing home the torment of the
people of Belfast who are surrounded by British soldiers,
watched over by British helicopters, and kept under
surveillance by their fellow Catholics in the IRA.  Maggie's
own father, Joe Hamill (Brian Cox), is the district leader of the
organization.  He must contend not only with Maggie's
obvious attraction to Danny but with a hothead in his own
organization, Harry (Gerard McSorley) who threatens to stoke
the fires of hatred even as Joe is close to negotiating a
peaceful end to the conflict with Britain.  For her part Maggie
must not only fend off the advances of the man to whom she
is still mightily attracted but deal with her son, Liam (Ciaran
Fitzgerald), a troubled lad who is convinced that his mom is
about to leave him and run off with her teenage heartthrob.</P>
<P>   Director Sheridan's sympathies appear to be with the peace
faction of the IRA led by Joe and decidedly against the
fanatical Harry, who is so opposed to any compromises with
London that he singlehandedly reverses a peace process
which is bringing opposing camps together.  Using the sport
of boxing as metaphor to bring home the conflicts faced on
Europe's edge, Jim Sheridan and Terry George's script has its
mellowed hero organize a gym to give the district kids
something to do while simultaneously unifying the community
by making his ring non-sectarian: Catholics and Protestants
have been invited to box and to join as spectators and
contestants together.  In the movie's most surprising scene,
Danny resorts to a tactic while boxing in London amid a
crowd of upper-class British spectators which will bring to
mind a surprisingly rebellious act in Tony Richardson's
wonderful "The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner."</P>
<P>   Ultimately, "The Boxer" does not take sides between the
British and the IRA, as such partisanship would not serve the
cause of peace.  Sheridan seems, however, to want the
Catholics move forward and not be imprisoned--as both
Maggie and Danny feel they are--by memories of the people
who died for the cause, particularly for the ten imprisoned
young men who starved themselves to death to call the
world's attention to their country's plight.  He is as sincere in
bringing home the necessity for peace as is Kevin Costner in
that actor-director's corny but equally unaffected epic, "The
Postman."  He succeeds in evoking audience sympathy not
only by an honest screenplay which resorts to melodramatics
only when clearly called for, but by superb ensemble
performances highlighted by the suppressed romance of its
principals.  Daniel Day-Lewis once again shows his range as
an overly controlled prizefighter whose most challenging
struggle is in a continued pursuit of his romance with Maggie,
while Emily Watson gives an endearing performance as a
woman bound by her community's strictures, moving both
toward and away from the man with whom she is still in love
like a puppy exploring the trials of a new territory.  The fight
scenes are believable, if not particularly awe-inspiring while a
broken-down area of Dublin serves well to depict the
barbarous nature of Belfast's dilemma. Rated R.  Running
Time: 107 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
