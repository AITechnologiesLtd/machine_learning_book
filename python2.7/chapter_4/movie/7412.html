<PRE>                                THE SAINT
                       A film review by Adam Joyce
                        Copyright 1997 Adam Joyce</PRE>
<P>Based on the 1960's TV series of the same name, but very different from it,
comes "The Saint". The storyline is typical of the action/spy genre. The
lead character, Simon Templar (Val Kilmer) is essentially an executive
criminal and impersonator. He takes requests over The Internet for tasks
such as stealing special Russian microchips, asks millions of dollars per
assignment, and then completes the assignment in disguise. His aim is to
attain $50 million before retiring.
The main component of the story involves an assignment (purportedly his
last) in which Simon must steal the formula for Cold Fusion (limitless
energy from water) for the Russian Opposition Government which wants to
attain political power there. Of course, this Opposition Government is
completely corrupt, is secretly stealing all the heating oil from Russia so
that the people freeze. Without warmth, in the freezing Russian weather,
the people will be incited to revolt (at least according to the storyline),
hence electing the Opposition leader, Sofiya, to power.
There is two quite predictable problems. Firstly, the professor who has
designed the formula is an attractive young female, and therefore Simon
Templar MUST fall in love with her. Secondly, the Russian Opposition plan
to have Simon killed as soon as they have the formula for Cold Fusion (I
never would have guessed!).
Inevitably Simon and Emma Russell (the professor from whom Simon has stolen
the formula) end up in Russia, where Sofiya's evil son, Ilya, tracks them
down to kill them. The police in Russia are of course corrupt, and work for
Sofiya also, meaning that Simon and Emma are in a lot of trouble! It seems
that Ilya has an uncanny ability to track the pair, despite the fact that
they could be anywhere in a city larger than Sydney.
Nothing about this film is particularly surprising. Val Kilmer (who plays
10 very different identities as Simon Templar) gives a reasonably solid
performance, especially given his range of characters. His co-star,
Elisabeth Shue (playing Emma Russell) is equally good. Hollywood newcomer,
Valery Nikolaev (playing Ilya) who learnt English to play his part, is
undoubtably going to be a common sight in Hollywood films from now on,
probably playing equally evil characters who never seem to give up.
However, the storyline gives the actors little to play with. It is very
much a formulaic Hollywood action/adventure film, and although competent
and entertaining, is not original or particularly clever. </P>
