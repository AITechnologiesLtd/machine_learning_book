<PRE>THE WEDDING SINGER
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>        So what's Adam Sandler's shtick?</PRE>
<P>        That's the question I asked myself when venturing nervously into
"The Wedding Singer," the latest film to star the Saturday Night Live
alumnus.</P>
<P>        Does he draw laughs from his sad, puppy dog expression and
don't-hate-me-for-being-a-simpleton observations?  Or do fans giggle when
he screams at the top of his lungs at people?  Or is it just the fact that
he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over?</P>
<P>        Well, there's a little bit of all of that in "The Wedding Singer"
and while I exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of Mr.
Sandler's thing, I did have a surprisingly good time.</P>
<P>        That's because, in a nutshell, "The Wedding Singer" is one of the
sweetest movies you're ever likely to come across.  That's right.  Sweet.
The humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to
laugh-out-loud hysterical but the tone?  Well, it's just lovely.  I have to
admit I was half-expecting farting armpit humor, gratuitous nudity,
superfluous, cloying subplots, and some nasty, unnecessary violence.
Instead?  Well, I've said it before.  Sweet.</P>
<P>        The year is 1985 and Sandler plays Robbie Hart, the eponymous
wedding singer, a job aspiring rock stars often settle for.  When Robbie's
fiancée dumps him at his own altar, Robbie gets depressed and turns to a
plucky waitress called Julia (Drew Barrymore) who has some problems of her
own (she's marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who, unbeknownst to her,
isn't that big on monogamy).  It isn't giving anything away to say that
Robbie and Julia fall in love.  Aww...</P>
<P>        Sandler and Barrymore are a good match and they're assisted by some
terrific cameo appearances, including Steve Buscemi and Jon Lovitz, whose
individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film.</P>
<P>        Writer Tim Herlihy (with uncredited assistance from Carrie Fisher)
keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion.  It doesn't
all work but it's handled with such light-heartedness that Robbie and Julia
coming together generates more smiles than groans.  Herlihy and director
Frank Coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights, sounds, and
affectations of the 1980s.  The soundtrack--an ever-present force in the
film--is packed with wall-to-wall hits of the period, new wave upon new
wave of songs from Billy Idol's "White Wedding" to The Smiths' "How Soon Is
Now?" to Culture Club's "Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?"</P>
<P>        The mix of music and fashion would make "The Wedding Singer" a
great double feature with "Boogie Nights."</P>
<P>        If you grew up listening to The Cure and A Flock of Seagulls and
The Psychedelic Furs, then "The Wedding Singer" is bound to put a nostalgic
hop in your stride.  If you're a fan of the lovable, laughable Adam
Sandler, well...  Let's just say that "The Wedding Singer" might well be
the only film in recent memory to make *me* want to rent "Happy Gilmore."</P>
