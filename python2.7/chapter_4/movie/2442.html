<PRE>One-Line-Summary
----------------
     A young woman awakens to her sensuality in the midst of a conflict
between art and religion.</PRE>
<P>Tak Plot Summary
----------------
     Traveling with her husband, Rev. Anthony (Hugh Grant), Estella
(Tara Fitzgerald) discovers an unfamiliar and initially unwelcome side
of herself in the Australian retreat of controversial artist Norman
Lindsay (Sam Neill).  While Anthony debates the moral implications of
art with Lindsay, Estella hangs out with the uninhibited models, Stella
(Elle MacPherson), Prue (Kate Fischer), and the child-like Giddy
(Portia De Rossi), and finds the SIREN within her.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts 
------------
     Australian director John Dugan (FLIRTING) summarizes SIRENS very
well: "I wanted to make a film about sensuality and repression and the
church's attitude towards sexuality."  I'll give him an A+ then.  Like
HENRY & JUNE, SIRENS is extremely sensual and focuses on one woman as
she grapples with this powerful emotion.</P>
<P>     SIRENS shows heaps of unabashed, and occasionally very sensual
nudity.  Except for Lindsay, who is always clothed, all eight
characters (male and female) are seen butt-naked or half dressed, and
not just briefly.  The painter's models Stella (Elle MacPherson) and
Prue (Kate Fischer) use sensual nudity to their advantage.  They
delight in making the English reverend and his wife uncomfortable.</P>
<P>     SIRENS does an wonderful job of showing female sensuality.  The
women are passionate, playful, and powerfully aware of their
sexuality.  Traditional Hollywood male sexuality is missing, replaced
by something much more arousing.  Even with the debut of super-model
Elle MacPherson (who gained twenty pounds to lend her body a Boticelli
contour), the "beauty myth" woman has been replaced by real women.  As
an added treat, there's a turn-about--a fake male, "Devlin: the
odd-jobs man," subject of many a Harlequin and cheap porno.</P>
<P>     And yet, SIRENS is not a preachy movie.  Lindsay's painting
reflect his statements that the female body is beautiful.  He believes
the church suppressed sexuality, and women as its embodiment, to gain
power over pagans who worshiped fertility and celebrated sexuality.
"How do you compete with something that popular?  You suppress it."
His painting attempt to reclaim that time and feeling of sensuality.</P>
<P>     The visuals were great.  His estate reminded me of an Olympian
glade--sensual, playful nude statues, fountains, riotous colors, and
a naturally beautiful nearby swimming hole.  All in stark contrast to
the unrelenting brown of the nearby town.</P>
<P>     And animals are everywhere, giving it a garden-of-eden feel.  The
characters fearlessly encounter snakes, kangaroos and insects.  I was
startled to see a moving koala bear--did you know they sort of hop?
Maybe "gallump" is more accurate.  In one scene Estella is awakened by
noises at night and encounters a strange animal ... and even *I* didn't
know what the hell it was!  I can't remember the last time I saw a new
creature.  It was the size of a large pig, and looked sorta like a
compact gerbil.  Very odd.  If anyone knows what this is, drop me a
line, I'd love to hear about it.</P>
<P>     NOTE: Although there was a real Normal Lindsay, this is *not* a
biographical study, nor was it intended to be.</P>
<P>Tak Rating:
-----------
     Sensual.  That's the word for SIRENS.  I used it nine times in
this review and that's almost the limit there.  I fully intend to watch
it again, this time with my girlfriend.  I can't wait for this one to
hit video as well.  Then I won't have to wait 'til I get home.</P>
<PRE>   avoid at all costs            see several times (w/friends) as matinee
   wait for videotape            see once at full price
   watch it on cable          X see it several times - full and/or matinee
   see once as a matinee    see many times at full price
