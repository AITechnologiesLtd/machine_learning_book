<PRE>                            JACKIE BROWN 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
             2 :-) for a self disciplined Tarantino exercise</PRE>
<P>Cast: Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Bridget Fonda,
Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, Chris Tucker Director: Quentin Tarantino
Screenplay: Quentin Tarantino, based on the book RUM PUNCH by Elmore
Leonard</P>
<P>I walked into the cinema with a strangely familiar, sick feeling in my
stomach; my head spining the words, ‘Oh God not another Tarantino film.'
PULP FICTION actually nauseated me with it's bloody lack of respect for
life, and the dread feeling that I was about to be hit with another bout
of movie onset vertigo re: Jackie Brown, airline hostess, money
laundering, smart pussycat in high heels, and……</P>
<PRE>I was pleasantly proven wrong!</PRE>
<P>We have none of that usual excessive Tarantino, violent sick shit of
bullets spraying flesh, blood, parting heads from body, riddling torso,
an absolute lack of self-control permeating the likes of hits like PULP
and RESERVOIR DOGS. None of that Quentinessential nonsense hindering
this film, although some scenes do come perilously close. Instead I
found a likeable mix of down town funky 60-70's tunes (Tarantino always
has a good ear) matching the heartbeat of the movie. Also a cleverly
thought out plot and stylish look of direction not too dissimilar to
PULP, but without the high body count. Style and Look is the word, and
Quentin's eyes captures the soul of his character's, each have
distinctive personalities and motivations, and the dialogue is as sharp
as Quentin can get it.</P>
<P>So Ms Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a gal in strife, an independent woman
in her 40's who has to out talk, out smart the likes of a murderous, gun
dealer Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), his hardened criminal henchman
(Robert De Niro) and the feds (Michael Keaton and pal). Up for grabs is
half a million and Jackie Brown is out to secure it.</P>
<P>Pam Grier is wonderful as the beauty with brains and a cool disposition
that matches her leggy heels and panty hose. She has the Look. Samuel L.
Jackson merely reprises the street wise, foul mouthed pretentious
intelligentsia that shocked and humoured everybody in PULP FICTION. He
excels in these stereo type roles. His co-partner in crime, the always
reliable Robert De Niro, is unfortunately miscast as a rather lifeless,
boring sidekick, a role which should perhaps have gone to someone
equally lifeless and boring. I haven't seen Bridget Fonda give such a
good performance, since IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU. She glows on screen like
a bride or pregnant mother, but her character is that of a slut – oddly
charming.</P>
<P>An overall well performed, disciplined Tarantino exercise into movie
making, which is moderately entertaining.</P>
