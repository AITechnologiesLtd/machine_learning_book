<P>     It has long been my belief that the best movie mysteries are those
after which you can say to yourself, "I should have figured that out."
I loathe Joe Eszterhas-style thrillers which make me feel as though
I've been had; nothing that can change the "whodunnit" by shooting five
new minutes of footage is constructed tightly enough.  Almost equally
annoying are those which seem to twist and turn just for the sake of
twisting and turning, forcing you to engage in a two-hour discussion
with your fellow moviegoers just to figure out what the heck you just
saw.  MALICE avoids all these pitfalls.  This is a sharp,
artfully-constructed thriller, a snappy entertainment that does
everything I ask a film in its genre to do:  keep me guessing without
manipulating me.</P>
<P>     Andy Safien (Bill Pullman) is a student dean at Westerly College,
a picturesque New England campus plagued by a string of serial rapes.
While following up on the latest assault, Andy meets Dr. Jed Hill (Alec
Baldwin), a cocky new thoracic surgeon who turns out to be an old high
school classmate of Andy's.  Andy soon invites Jed to move into the
house being remodeled by Andy and his wife Tracy (Nicole Kidman) in an
attempt to defray expenses.  Tracy is none-too-pleased by Jed's playboy
manner, an added burden to the chronic abdominal pain she is
experiencing.  However, life in the Safien household will soon go from
bad to worse.  Andy becomes a suspect in the rapes, and Tracy suffers a
severe medical emergency, forcing Jed to make a decision which will set
in motion a serpentine chain of danger and deceptions.</P>
<P>     This is the point where reviewing a film like MALICE gets tricky.
Comment on the plot is next to impossible, particularly on those few
points where I felt credibility is stretched.  All I can really say is
that the script by Aaron Sorkin (A FEW GOOD MEN) and Scott Frank (DEAD
AGAIN) is intelligent and impressive in its plausible intricacy.  There
is an ingenious red herring crafted into the story which successfully
diverts attention from other key elements.  There were moments when I
sensed the entire audience realizing the same thing at the same time.
I saw very little of that telltale sign of a confusing mystery:  people
leaning over to friends and spouses to ask what just happened.  Every
explanation was clear and smooth, if not always perfectly believable.</P>
<P>     If there's one problem with the plot-heavy script, it's that
certain character developments are shallow.  Bill Pullman is very good
as the pleasant Everyman with a streak of jealousy, but his character
would have benefited from some early evidence to make his later
behavior more believable.  Ditto Nicole Kidman, who has the most
challenging role.  I found Bebe Neuwirth basically annoying as a police
detective sporting an accent that appeared to be a mutant hybrid of
Boston Brahmin and Brooklyn Italian.  On the plus side, Anne Bancroft
has a showy bit part as a loony mentor a la Robin Williams in DEAD
AGAIN (apparently a Scott Frank trademark).  Alec Baldwin is perfect as
Jed, delivering a great speech about his "God complex" with utter
conviction.  Baldwin should stick to roles such as this which require
colossal displays of hubris.</P>
<P>     Director Harold Becker showed his talent for atmospheric suspense
in SEA OF LOVE, and surpasses that effort with MALICE.  While never
spectacularly tense, MALICE is always gripping, thanks to a methodical
unfolding of the story with something important happening in almost
every scene.  Becker even cleverly undercuts genre expectations,
particularly in an ominously underscored shot of a big dark house ...
on a cliff ... overlooking crashing surf ... during a thunderstorm.
The audience was in hysterics.  This is a smart, deft directing job,
and one that establishes Becker as a name to watch for.</P>
<P>     I think I can get away with saying that you shouldn't go into
MALICE expecting a scream-out-loud suspense film.  It's more subtle
than that, but never less than thoroughly intriguing.  This is a
mystery for mystery lovers.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 plot twists:  8.</PRE>
