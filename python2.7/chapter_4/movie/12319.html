<PRE>"He Got Game"
Verdict: A-</PRE>
<P>The main character's name is Jesus. The movie's tag line is `The father,
the son and the holy game.'</P>
<P>Allegories don't get more obvious than that, but despite the explicitness
-- or maybe even because of it -- Spike Lee's heartfelt `He Got Game'
transcends its sports-movie orientation to become a convincingly
unsentimental examination of a father's tough love of his gifted son. And
we're not talking about that Father or that son.</P>
<P>Lee's enthusiasm for basketball, specifically the New York Knicks, is in
fact more famous than any of his movies. `He Got Game' is easily one of the
most eloquent odes to hoops committed to film and if you figured Spike Lee
would be the last director on earth to fall for mytho-poetics, you
underestimate the depth of his love for this game. A picturesque opening
montage shuttles from farm boy to ghetto kid and several demographic shades
in between, all engaging in the primal slo-mo of the well-executed jump
shot. Lee's lovingly rendered shots of the ball's arc through the air
recalls the famous bone toss in `2001: A Space Odysessy.' Even the
bombastic opening score by John Williams is jarringly unlike Spike.</P>
<P>>From that aching beginning comes a penetrating story of dubious redemption
involving one Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington), an aging ex-hoopster
serving hard time in Attica for accidentally killing his wife in a domestic
dispute. On the outside, Jake's son Jesus (pronounced just like a certain
King of the Jews) has blossomed into the nation's most highly touted
high-school basketball player. A lanky forward with Jordan-like moves and a
killer instinct on the court, Jesus is struggling to stay real amidst the
swirl of attention from colleges, sports agents, the media and friends and
family of less-than-pure motives.</P>
<P>The warden of Attica offers Jake a deal. If he can convince his son to sign
with the governor's alma mater, a school called Big State, then Jake's
sentence will be shortened considerably. Problem is, Jesus has nursed a
murderous resentment against his father for the murder of his mother. With
one week left before the deadline to state his intentions for his future,
the last thing Jesus needs is to deal with a father he hasn't seen in six
years.</P>
<P>`He Got Game' is gimmicky. Spike Lee's celebrity in the world of big-time
basketball allows him to line up a number of heavyweights -- from college
coaches like Dean Smith and John Thompson to pro players like Reggie
Miller, Shaquille O'Neal and His Airness -- to sing the praises of Jesus in
a faux SportsCenter report. The young man's first name is exploited in any
number of hokey media puns (`Jesus Saves' trumpets Sports Illustrated).
Underneath the hokum, however, is a movie worth savoring. Holed up in a
foul, dingy hotel, Jake attempts to get the ear of his son while making
time with a battered white prostitute (Milla Jovovich) and keeping at bay
the two cantakerous parole officers assign to birddog him (one of whom is
the wonderfully gruff Jim Brown).</P>
<P>At some point, however, the story finds it teeth in the travails of Jesus,
played with understatement by real-life NBA star Ray Allen. Like his
namesake seeking righteousness in a cesspool of licentiousness, Jesus is
intent on playing by the rules even when he is surrounded by corrupted
people with their own agendas who see Jesus as a potential cash cow
including his coach, his girlfriend and even his uncle and legal guardian.
With only his kid sister and his loyal cousin Booger (wasn't that the
Apostle Paul's nickname?) to trust, Jesus navigates the money-changers,
keeping his intentions to himself. Jake's job is to convince his son that
he's not just trailing the golden goose like everyone else, which is going
to be tough since he's got his own agenda.</P>
<P>The difficult relationship between Jake and Jesus is revealed in fitful
flashback as we observe an unforgiving Jake pushing his son to exploit his
talents to the fullest. When the eventful showdown comes between father and
son, it comes on a basketball court. </P>
<P>`He Got Game' certainly has it excesses and missteps, the chief among them
Jake's tryst with the hooker, a subplot that only adds length to the movie.
But Spike Lee's respect -- nay, worship -- of basketball is contagious and
his audacious metaphors give shape to a powerful story of a father's
efforts to save his son. And we all know a thing or two about that story.</P>
