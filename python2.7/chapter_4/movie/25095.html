<PRE>**1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Year: 2000. Starring Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton, Dougray Scott, Ving 
Rhames, Richard Roxburgh, John Polson, Brendan Gleeson, Rade Serbedzija, 
Anthony Hopkins. Written by Ronald D. Moore & Brannon Braga (story) and 
Robert Towne (screenplay). Directed by John Woo. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Now here's a curious beast: A film that's equal parts tedious and 
exhilarating, partially absorbed in its own self-importance, but also 
possessing moments of pure, unpretentious exuberance. That's what 
happens when an acclaimed action director (John Woo) meets crass 
Hollywood commercialism (personified by *producer* Tom Cruise). 
"Mission: Impossible 2" bogs itself down as a star vehicle and glamour 
project, but succeeds when egos get out of the way and allow Woo to work 
his special kind of magic. It's enjoyable once it gets to the good 
stuff, but the good stuff only takes up about half of the running time.</P>
<P>Cruise returns in his role as Ethan Hunt, super-secret agent for the 
mysterious IMF agency. He's called in to deal with a new crisis: Sean 
Ambrose (Dougray Scott), a former IMF operative, is attempting to steal 
both a new deadly virus and its only known cure. After releasing the 
virus to the public, he will make millions by investing in the only 
company producing the antidote. The plan is for Hunt to recruit one of 
Ambrose's old flames, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), professional 
thief and sexy love interest, to spy on the disgruntled former employee. 
Unfortunately, Hunt has fallen into a romantic relationship with Nyah, 
and is therefore reluctant to send her into dangerous situations.</P>
<P>Most of the setup is fairly laborious, with an exciting opening scene 
aboard a plane giving way to long, dull passages of exposition and a 
tedious romantic dalliance for Cruise and Newton. You can see the 
problems coming quickly: The script has been written in just such a way 
so that even the biggest idiot in the house will be able to understand 
what's going on. That means every time something is *shown* to us, it 
must also be *told* to us. I don't understand why this had to be done; 
Woo is a good enough director to indicate things to the audience. We 
don't need a shot of Newton entering a house and then a character 
saying, "She's in the house now."</P>
<P>The romantic relationship is set up in a ridiculous slow-motion car 
chase scene: They hate each other, get into a car crash, and then sleep 
with each other-just your standard action movie logic. I didn't find the 
romance at all credible, despite Woo's best efforts to spice up the 
proceedings. (I did like the scene with Cruise and Newton gazing at each 
other through the dress of a salsa dancer.) Then after Cruise gets some 
booty, the movie shuttles Newton off into support mode, revealing that 
all her thief skills won't be necessary; she's just supposed to be a 
front for the main man. You can tell this was Cruise's pet project 
because other characters are dashed off every time Tom wants to preen. 
Ving Rhames and Richard Roxburgh are brought in as Hunt's presumably 
skilled associates, then mainly stand around giving reasons why they 
can't help him at the crucial moment. That's too bad, because I wanted 
to see more of these guys. They're interesting characters; why not give 
them more screen time? Ms. Newton, meanwhile, is an absolutely gorgeous 
woman with tremendous screen presence and a lovely 
can't-quite-tell-what-race-she-is look that can't be manufactured. But 
she disappears for long stretches while Cruise shows off his pecs and 
flicks his hair. Again, too bad.</P>
<P>That's not to say there isn't fun stuff. There's fun stuff. The ending 
motorcycle chase scene is fun. The spycraft stuff, with earpieces, 
interceptions, and fancy Macintosh laptops, is fun. Slow motion gun 
battles are fun. The movie does come down with Invincible Villain 
Syndrome at the end (a Woo trademark that has always annoyed me), but 
the second half of "Mission: Impossible 2" does seem remarkably less 
tedious than the first-no surprise, because it's at about the halfway 
point that the script gets out of the way and lets Woo's action set 
pieces take over. But it's not only action scenes that have driven 
previous Woo films to success. His most successful American release, 
"Face/Off," had a human interest story at the center of the outrageous 
action. "Mission: Impossible 2," by contrast, barely has time for 
characters. Cruise is too busy posing to play a character, and the other 
actors have been shoved aside to make room for more of his posing. 
Consequently, all hopes for a great, well-rounded film have been dashed 
because of a star's ego.</P>
<P>Ultimately, there's a question one must ask when a film has fun action 
scenes conflicting with a lame script: Is the action good enough to make 
you forget about the other stuff? For me, for this movie, it wasn't. 
Maybe Tom Cruise felt he had the right to indulge himself in 2000 after 
delivering two of the least narcissistic performances of his career in 
1999. In "Eyes Wide Shut" and "Magnolia," Cruise put his ego aside and 
deferred to two directors he respected, Stanley Kubrick and Paul Thomas 
Anderson. Why couldn't he have done the same for John Woo? Where 
Cruise's deference helped elevate his previous two films to artistic 
heights, his egotism has deflated his latest.</P>
