<PRE>HOPE FLOATS</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  ** out of ****</PRE>
<P>Imagine yourself invited to a talk show because you think you've won a free
makeover.  Then imagine that on the show, for all the world to see, you find
out your best friend is having an affair with your husband.  At the rate
trash television shows do things like this these days, you might not have to
imagine it; it might have happened to you already.  For the rest of us,
we're given HOPE FLOATS, in which Birdee Pruitt (Sandra Bullock) is
humiliated in just such a way on national television.  Birdee loads up the
station wagon with her possessions and her daughter and leaves her
unfaithful husband in Chicago to move back to her hometown of Smithville, Texas.</P>
<P>In trying to start her life over again, Birdee is faced with several
obstacles.  For one thing, just about everyone in the small town has seen
her infamous television appearance.  "We have a satellite dish," says one of
her high school classmates, "and so we got to see it twice."  Another
problem is that her daughter Bernice (Mae Whitman) doesn't quite get the
idea of separation - she still thinks her father will be coming to get them.
Birdee's overbearing mother (Gena Rowlands), with whom Birdee and Bernice
have come to live, isn't much help either.  "You look terrible.  Have you
taken up drinking?" is the way she greets Birdie at her door.</P>
<P>The first half of HOPE FLOATS is devoted to Birdee trying to reincorporate
herself into life in Smithville.  There are some nice scenes where she meets
different classmates who never left the small town.  Some are happy to see
her, while others revel in the fact that she has been made a fool of and has
come crawling back home.  Here the movie shows promise, but then something
happens about midway through.  It begins to lose direction and drag....and
drag....and drag.</P>
<P>One direction the film tries to take is love story.  Birdee's mother tries
to set her up with Justin Matisse (Harry Connick, Jr.), who left Smithville
for California years ago, but then came back.  Justin used to have a crush
on Birdee, who was less than sympathetic, and it seems nothing has changed.
Justin is still very interested, and Birdee is still very stand-offish
toward him.  Now, you'd expect that there will be sparks as the movie
progresses, but there aren't.  The whole film is peppered with instances
where Justin gets close, but Birdee soon turns cold.  It's really no matter,
since there isn't any chemistry between them, and when they finally do get
together, it's totally forced.</P>
<P>Another direction taken is the reconciliation Birdee must make with her
past.  Birdee has issues with her mother, with her father, with herself, and
with half the townsfolk.  There are plenty of scenes where we see Birdee
deep in thought, and an image of her going through the same thing, but at a
younger age, is superimposed.  Two problems exist here.  First, we never get
the feeling how these instances fit in with the rest of the movie.  When
they appear, they seem isolated and disjointed.  There's hardly much of a
resolution for many of them.  Second, when the past images are displayed,
they are so vague that it's really mostly guesswork as to what they're
supposed to show.  In most of them, I could barely make out the image of a
young girl, so I assumed it was supposed to be Birdee.</P>
<P>There's also a subplot involving Birdee's daughter and how she doesn't have
any friends at school.  In fact, she makes an enemy of the school bully, Big
Dolores (Rachel Lena Snow) by accidentally hitting her in the face with a
volleyball.  There's this big buildup to an after-school fight.  Bernice is
scared.  The fight occurs with kids shouting and screaming and eerie music
playing and the whole thing looks like some kind of nightmare.  Then Bernice
gets up and goes home, unscratched.  I suppose director Forrest Whitaker
didn't think anybody wanted to see a kid actually all beaten up, but by
giving her only a bruised ego, we don't see the significance of the whole
thing.  Worse, Bernice's family then cheers her up by lip-synching to a song
by the Temptations in a scene which was so obviously put there just to break
up the monotony.  Too bad it wasn't very funny.  In fact, it was kind of
embarrassing.</P>
<P>Whitaker engages in a severe overuse of devices which are supposed to
provoke emotions.  He has Bullock cry too often, he includes too many slow
motion sequences, and he puts in too many musical montages, only serving to
trivialize each supposedly dramatic moment and drag the pacing even further.
There are even scenes which are in the movie for no apparent reason except
to mislead us into thinking there will be some kind of payoff down the road.
I guess they are there just to fill time.  Someone should remind him that
sometimes, the saying "less is more" is actually true.</P>
<P>You find the performances in HOPE FLOATS are pretty good when you can
concentrate long enough to pay attention to the screen.  Gena Rowlands is
fine as Birdee's unflappable mother, and young Mae Whitman does a nice job
playing Bernice, the typical precocious movie child.  Her part is actually
hampered by the script, however, which at first gives her the usual
older-than-her-years conversation, but then quickly gives her lines which
are not just unrealistic, they are nearly impossible to take from someone so
young.  You wonder if the screenwriter had actually taken the time to say
the sentences out loud.  Harry Connick, Jr. delivers some of the corniest
lines I've ever heard, my favorite being when he's at the local saloon,
trying to get Birdee to cut a rug with him.  "Dancing is like a conversation
between two people," he says.  "Talk to me."  I had to control my laughter.</P>
<P>Sandra Bullock clocks in with her most mature performance to date.  She is
strong, tender, vulnerable, and funny.  There's a scene where Birdee is
trying to get a job through an employment agency headed by a classmate she
didn't treat very well in high school, and the classmate, enjoying the turn
of the tables, decides to put Birdee in her place.  Bullock delivers a short
monologue which simultaneously shows all four of the qualities I have
mentioned.  The movie is almost worth seeing for those few spoken lines.
Just grit your teeth at the rest.</P>
