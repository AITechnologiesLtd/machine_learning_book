<PRE>                            LEGENDS OF THE FALL
                       A film review by Rich Siegel
                        Copyright 1995 Rich Siegel</PRE>
<P>Starring:   Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Aidan Quinn,  Julia Ormond,
            Henry Thomas
Directed by: Edward Zwick
Produced by:  Edward Zwick, Bill Wittliff, Marshal Herskovitz
Screenplay by: Susan Shilliday, Bill Wittliff (based on a novella by Jim
               Harrison)
Director of Photography: John Toll
Music: James Horner</P>
<P>     LEGENDS OF THE FALL would have made a good silent movie.  Its
well-worn story of a family divided by the love of a woman is sustained
primarily by images and music.  The epic sweep of  LEGENDS, which takes
us from a Montana ranch, to the battlefields of World War I, to the
South Seas and even to urban back alleys complete with gangsters, is
perfect camera fodder.  The actors provide the longing looks of
unrequited love, the writhing death scenes and the frail quiverings
of old age.  In the broader strokes of the silents, this would have
been first-rate material.  However, now, it all seems rather
overwrought and anachronistic.</P>
<P>     Brad Pitt, Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas portray the three sons of
a former Union Army Colonel (Anthony Hopkins), who, after being
outraged by the treatment of  Native Americans during the Indian Wars,
resigns his commission and starts a cattle ranch in Montana.</P>
<P>     Early on, Director Edward Zwick paints an idyllic portrait of the
life of this gentleman-rancher and his sons growing up in the wilds of
Montana (Recollections of BONANZA are unavoidable during the early part
of this film.).  The film patiently, almost reverently, depicts the
love and respect the boys have for each other and their father  (Their
mother, early on, departs for a less rugged environment.).  When we
first see Pitt,  Quinn, Thomas and Hopkins their characters seem to
have some genuine warmth and depth.  When the youngest son, Samuel
(Henry Thomas), arrives home from college with his bride-to-be, the
subtle sense of impending conflict amidst the brotherly camaraderie is
apparent.  Their harmonious life is about to about to come apart.</P>
<P>     When Samuel announces his plan to join the Army to fight the
Kaiser in the Great War and we see Tristan (Brad Pitt) comforting
Samuel's fiancee Susannah (Julia Ormond) when she learns of his plan,
we pretty much know where this story is headed: Samuel is doomed and
Tristan and Susannah will fall in love.</P>
<P>     LEGENDS is fairly routine melodrama.  Not that there's anything
wrong with that.  But in this case, once the stage is set and the main
conflicts defined, the film fails to lives up to its early promise of
rich characterizations and story.  Instead, Pitt and Quinn retreat
into, what for them, are becoming stock characters:  Pitt plays
Tristan--riddled with guilt at the death of Samuel and his love for
Susannah--as the same brooding, haunted soul he portrayed in INTERVIEW
WITH A VAMPIRE.  He unvaryingly expresses a sort of impenetrable
detachment throughout most of the film;  After years of traveling the
world as an adventurer and big-game hunter--which, on screen, is
depicted in a long, awkward section of narration and montage--Pitt's
character returns home with virtually no hint of change or maturation,
as if he'd been gone for a long weekend  (except for a beard that makes
him look remarkably like Val Kilmer's Jim Morrison from THE DOORS.).</P>
<P>     Quinn, also reverts to his predictably long-suffering,
self-righteous character that he has used before in films such as BENNY
AND JOON.  Despite his character's success in business and politics--he
becomes a Congressman--he can't shake that perpetual hurt and betrayed
look.</P>
<P>     Anthony Hopkins provides the appropriate strength and dominance to
the role of the Colonel until his character is reduced, by a stroke, to
a jumble of facial tics and mumblings.</P>
<P>     Despite these flaws however, the film isn't a complete loss.  The
power of John Toll's cinematography and James Horner's lush,
occasionally overbearing, score--which, at times, seems to be
sustaining the film by itself--saves LEGENDS from disaster.  The
beautifully photographed settings of the Montana countryside  (actually
shot in Alberta, Canada) dominates this film.  Even in close ups, the
richness of the backgrounds occasionally upstage the actors which, in
this case, is no great loss.</P>
<P>Rated (R) violence, sexual situations, brief nudity, language.</P>
