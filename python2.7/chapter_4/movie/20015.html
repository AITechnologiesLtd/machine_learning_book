<P>         When it comes to rolling with the changes in the music world,
KISS runs a close second to Cher. The band originally coasted in on the
glam-rock movement of the early 1970s, worked a few ballads like "Beth"
into their repertoire to broaden their audience, went disco in 1979 with
"I Was Made For Lovin' You," tried their hands at Alan Parsons
Project-style pomp-rock with "Music From The Elder" and returned to
their roots just in time for the '70s nostalgia craze. The closing
credits of "Detroit Rock City" find lead singer Gene Simmons belting out
a power ballad penned by Diane Warren, whose "I Don't Want To Miss A
Thing" put Aerosmith back on the top of the charts last summer.</P>
<P> The KISS story would undoubtedly make a fascinating film, but
"Detroit," despite taking its title from one of the group's early hits,
turns out to have very little to do with the band. Instead, it focuses
on a much less intriguing quartet, four Ohio teens (Giuseppe Andrews,
James Bellows, Edward Furlong and Sam Huntington) who go to extremes to
catch a KISS concert at Cobo Hall in 1978.</P>
<P> That too might have been a potent topic for a movie if anyone
connected with "Detroit" had any first-hand knowledge of what 1978 was
like.</P>
<P> No such luck. "Detroit" is so poorly researched it prominently
features David Naughton's "Makin' It" and Rupurt Holmes' "Escape (The
Pina Colada Song)" on the soundtrack despite the fact they were released
in 1979 and then includes a reference to the Weather Girls' "It's
Raining Men," which didn't come along until 1982. The slang in Carl V.
Dupre's shoddy excuse for a script is also alarmingly wrong for the
period.</P>
<P> Then again, what more should be expected from a film by
director Adam Rifkin, whose previous credits include "Psycho Cop
Returns" and the pitifully bad Charlie Sheen vehicle "The Chase"?
Rifkin's style, to use the term in its loosest sense, consists of
shooting his actors in tight close-ups and having them shout their
lines, as if that somehow makes dumb dialogue funny. Every bit of
slapstick is photographed from multiple angles which only goes to prove
how awkwardly set up most of it is.</P>
<P> "Detroit" is sorely in need of the authenticity and easy humor
of "Dazed and Confused," the 1994 Richard Linklater comedy it's
obviously trying hard to imitate. But "Dazed" had characters the
audience could actually feel something for; "Detroit" offers insipid
cartoons, including a perverted priest, a gang of John Travolta wannabes
and a witchy mom, ineptly played by Lin Shaye. Even its "heroes" are
interchangable and charmless.</P>
<P> KISS itself only turns up in person at the very end, performing
for a few brief minutes before the end credits roll. Fans who want to
see the band in action would be better off tracking down a video of
"KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park," a deliciously campy made-for-TV
movie that shows what 1978 was really all about. James Sanford</P>
