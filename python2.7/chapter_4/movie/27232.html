<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two
famous 19th century French poets. The film managed to remove all the
poetry from the poets and instead  concentrated on their abrasive
personalities. The result is merely an academic exercise, leaving an
emotional vacuum that it couldn't build on to show them as the poets
they were. On paper, this shouldn't have been so terrible -- it had a
talented director in Agnieszka Holland ("The Secret Garden"), a proven
screenwriter in Christopher Hampton (Dangerous Liaisons), and a capable
cast. But the film was done in by its inept script, the unappealing way
the film was directed, and the miscasting of Leonardo DiCaprio as
Rimbaud. I found his performance to be the most risible one in the film,
with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius, spouting
obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that
facade. He, especially, looked bad because David Thewlis as Paul
Verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon
him and how thin a character he was forced to be. But when the two of
them were together, it looked like a mismatch. Leonardo's Rimbaud only
made the young poet look petulant and crude, yet we know from Rimbaud's
poetry, that he must have had something going for him because his poetry
was awe inspiring.</P>
<P>The film opens in post-revolutionary France in 1871, the 16-year-old
Rimbaud has sent the established Symbolist poet Verlaine a letter with
his poems. He accepts Verlaine's praises and invitation to be a house
guest in his splendid Paris home, and Rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in
rural Charleville. Once there, Rimbaud is disappointed in the
bourgeoisie household, has an immediate conflict with Verlaine's busty
18-year-old wife Mathilde (Romane), and finds to his regret that the
drunken Verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off
her family's money, even though he has nothing else in common with her.
When Verlaine states, "Poets can learn from one another," Rimbaud
replies in a haughty tone, "Only if they're bad poets." He will continue
to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship.
Verlaine proves to be weak-willed, beating his wife regularly, and plays
just as despicable a character as Rimbaud. When Mathilde's father kicks
Rimbaud out of the house, Verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the
two become lovers.</P>
<P>It's a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious
behavior patterns on the part of the two poets, which leads them to
traveling together and Mathilde asking for a divorce. In Brussels,
Verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail. While
Rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another
poem after he becomes 19. He instead goes to North Africa and becomes an
adventurer and a gun-runner, and after ten years there, comes home with
a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37. The
hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in
detail and that was not very satisfying. The film ends on a
whimper...with Verlaine talking with Rimbaud's sister about her brother
and the poems of his he still possesses, which the sister wants
destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her
deceased brother if published. This film was especially annoying because
Rimbaud's poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even
approached in this film, as the film only manages to skim the surface of
the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their
poetry. I have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this
film, but whatever it was, it just didn't work. It certainly didn't
bring any light into understanding what Rimbaud meant to modern poetry
and why he earned the reputation as the so-called father of modern
poetry.</P>
