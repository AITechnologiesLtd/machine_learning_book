<PRE>                            THE HUDSUCKER PROXY
                       A film review by David Cowen
                        Copyright 1994 David Cowen</PRE>
<P>     The Coen Brothers have found success again.  After producing and
directing four stylish and increasingly brilliant films: BLOOD SIMPLE,
RAISING ARIZONA, MILLER'S CROSSING, and the spectacularly complex
BARTON FINK, one would guess that the brother's stab on the
high-budget, commercial genre would create a watered-down result not
even close to matching the quality of their previous successes.  And
while its doubtful that HUDSUCKER PROXY will be able to recoup its $25
(rumored at $40) million budget in the theatres, the film spends the
budget well, mixing the Coen's brother's usual dark themes (Death,
Fate, Work, Failure, Fear of pretending to be what one is not) into a
lush, magical, accessible, Capraesque family movie.  The Coen brothers
have put cream in their coffee, and the result is nothing short of
amazing.</P>
<P>     Tim Robbins stars as Norville Barnes, a small-town rube from the
Muncie School of Business who came to New York with a huge dream and
considerably less work experience.  He finally finds an exploitative
job at Hudsucker Industries in the mail room, and goes to work "long
hours and low wages," attempting (and failing at) absurdly huge tasks.</P>
<P>     Waring Hudsucker, on the other hand, is at the top of the huge
Hudsucker Enterprise, sitting at the end of a tremendous lacquered
board table, smiling as he listens to his accountant give an assessment
of the company: one of incredible success and optimism for the future.
However, his salubrious smile melts into a frown of serious dread as he
realizes that his pocket watch is ticking perilously close to noon.  He
winds the watch, sets it on the table, and as the watch ticks past
noon, runs down the board-room table, jumping through a huge plate
glass window.</P>
<P>     Paul Newman stars as Sidney J. Mussberger, Hudsucker's right-hand
man.  A cut-throat businessman, Mussberger instantly mans the helm of
the company.  Realizing that Hudsucker had decreed that in the event of
his death, Hudsucker Industries stock would be taken public--a move
that would take control of the company away from Mussberger and the
other power-elite in the board room, Mussberger forms a plan to keep
control of the company--find a stupid, unwitting dupe to be the
president, which would screw the company up so bad that Hudsucker stock
would lose its value so that it could be bought up cheaply by the board
members.</P>
<P>     Coming up from the mail room to deliver correspondence to
Mussberger, Barnes terrorizes Mussberger's office, setting important
documents on fire, letting contracts blow out the window, spilling
water all over the floor, all the while attempting to show Mussberger a
diagram for a crackpot new product--a perfectly drawn circle on a
crumpled piece of paper.  Mussberger, impressed by Barnes' bumbling
naivete makes him the head of the company.</P>
<P>     However, the crackpot plan turns out to be the hula hoop, which
Barnes produces using the Hudsucker's resources.  The ensuing hula-hoop
craze quickly turns the former small-town rube into a paparazzi-stalked
celebrity, hounded to come up with an idea greater than a hula hoop.
Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Amy Archer, a Pulitzer-prize winning
reporter who lies her way undercover into Hudsucker Industries and
discovers Barnes' inexperienced past.  Barnes is made out to be an
imbecile, and his fate turns for the worse as he senses his time at the
top running out.</P>
<P>     Not enough can be said about the Coen's knack for creating an
atmosphere in their films.  Shots of the inner-workings of Hudsucker
Industries, from rooms full of pneumatic tubes and the inner workings
of the huge Hudsucker Building clock to the ticker-tape luxuriance of
the offices of Mussberger and Barnes are striking and beautiful.  The
film's editing moves smoothly between segments, giving it a grace
missing in the somewhat abrupt editing of other Coen brother's films.
The dark, thick tone of dread found in their other films has somehow
given way into the air of a genuine magic one finds in the charm of
40's and 50's Christmas films.  The music adds greatly to this: it
swirls into heavenly, wistful crescendos at all the right moments.  THE
HUDSUCKER PROXY is by far the most handsome and magical American film
to be in wide distribution in a couple of decades.</P>
<P>     The performances are superb as well.  Tim Robbins has proved
himself to be one of America's finest actors in his roles in THE PLAYER
and SHORT CUTS, as well as an impressive director/actor in BOB
ROBERTS.  Robbins' Norville Barnes isn't just a hick
caricature--Robbins plays Barnes as a genuinely charming imbecile: a
wise fool, as it were.  Jennifer Jason Leigh's Amy Archer at first
glance seems to be a obnoxious imitation of the Katherine Hepburn type,
but upon closer inspection it becomes obvious that its the Archer
*character* who wants to be the fast-talking tough dame, not Leigh
imitating one--and Leigh's acting reveals all sorts of subtleties and
innocence in Archer's character a lesser actress would gloss over.  The
only loose point is Paul Newman, who doesn't give his character any
more life than of any other "scheming greedy rich corporate head"
caricature.</P>
<P>     Of course, the dialogue is incredibly well written--in a Coen
Brothers film, it is hard to have a favorite quote because everything
that flies out of every actor's mouth is instantly catchy and
quotable.  The only problem is occasionally, especially with the scenes
in the newspaper office, the actors fly through their dialogue so fast
it takes two or three viewings to decipher everything they say.</P>
<P>     All of this begs the question: why is what appears to be (and is
marketed as) an innocent light comedy given a $25 million dollar
treatment by action film producer Joel Silver?  Silver claims "It's
just ... a good *story*, and the invention of the hula hoop, that's
just *cool*."  Somehow, I never thought retro-cool was the only thing
needed to net a $25 million production budget (well, yeah, there was
Oliver Stone's tedious THE DOORS, but that's another story
altogether).</P>
<P>     But THE HUDSUCKER PROXY is much more than just a well-produced
light comedy.  Somewhere, buried beneath the high-gloss sheen of the
sets, the fine acting, the well-paced jokes and the machine-gun paced
dialogue lurks a bit more ... the Coen Brothers' scripts spawn layers
of themes below the surface of the plot, commentaries on life which
span from the evolution of man's survival, the difficulties of
producing successful art, to a literal struggle betwixt time and fate.</P>
<P>     The Coens proved themselves masters of this sort of
script-writing with the obtuse but engrossing Barton Fink, but in many
ways Hudsucker Proxy may be more successful--it turns the Coen's
twisted, enlightened view of the enigmatic sides of life into a
completely audience-accessible film, suitable for the entire family.
In doing so, the Coen brothers have either made the most realistic,
normal surrealist films ever imagined, or one of the most complex,
multi-faceted family films ever made.  "You know, for kids!"  Either
way, the film is superb.</P>
<PRE>        So what does it get?  9 [out of 10].  I loved it.</PRE>
