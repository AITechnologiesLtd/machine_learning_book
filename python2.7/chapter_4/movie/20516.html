<PRE>Eyes Wide Shut</PRE>
<P>Starring Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman and Sydney Pollack
Directed by Stanley Kubrick
Running Time: 2 hours 39 minutes</P>
<PRE>(Warner Brothers)</PRE>
<P>Stanley Kubricks last film, Eyes Wide Shut is a odd drama which could turn
into a unlikely money maker due to the presence of Tom Cruise and Nicole
Kidman. The two play married couple Bill and Alice Harford. During a pot
induced argument, Alice admits to Bill that she nearly cheated on him with a
sailor. Bill is shocked by the statement, and sets about on a odd trip
through New York while thinking about sexual and moral politics. He also
stumbles across a mysterious secret society.</P>
<P>Kubricks career hasn't always be perfect, with unfulfilling movies such as
The Shining, and the pretty but empty Barry Lyndon. Of course, he's made
classics such as Dr. Strangelove and Full Metal Jacket. Eyes Wide Shut is a
mixture of both Kubricks best and worst: the plot and characters are
unsatisfying, but the look and feel of the film are so carefully crafted it
makes the film entertaining to watch.</P>
<P>The film has a strange, dreamlike aura which helps it immeasurable. The
deliberate grainy look Kubrick gives to the film makes it seem dreamlike,
with lights looking brighter than bright, and the majestic sets, especially
in the secret society headquarters, are a joy to watch. The direction is
also faultless, with nice zooms, cut aways and fade in, and is all largely
seamless. There's also an appropriate soundtrack, featuring a eerie
collection of tunes, although the piano solo which makes itself unwelcome
during some of the more dramatic scenes is rather grating and atmosphere
defeating.</P>
<P>Another pleasant surprise with Eyes Wide Shut is the strength of the main
cast, especially Tom Cruise. Although Cruise gave a nice performance in
Jerry Maguire, it wasn't particularly demanding, and it took Cuba Gooding
Jnr to give the film any bounce.  But Eyes Wide Shut centres heavily on
Cruise's character, and it takes Cruise to carry the film. Thankfully, h
can, and he gives a sterling performance as the troubled lead man. Nicole
Kidman, although featuring heavily during the start of the film, is slowly
pushed out of the plot. This is shame, as her performance is certainly,
well, 'off centre.' She's either stoned or drunk during most of the film,
which gives her an opportunity to over emphasise her emotions. There's a
delicious scene where a Hungarian flirts with her, and her performance as
she goes giddy eyed over him is a joy to watch. Her pot-induced argument is
also bizarrely funny. Sydney Pollack gives solid support as a friend with a
strange agenda, and Todd Field is fun as a grinning piano player who gets
Tom Cruise into trouble with the secret society.</P>
<P>The plot and characters themselves, however, are a little unsatisfying.
Firstly, it is somewhat hard to work out some points of the plot. Although
Kubrick explains the main plot with voice overs and flashbacks, other plot
elements are introduced and thrown away with no real explanation. Seeing as
Kubrick had three years to strengthen up the plot, it's a little
disappointing. Some of the characters are a little two dimensional, and
Nicole Kidman suffers terribly from the plot mechanics due to the stories
insistence of centring on Cruise. The script, written by Kubrick and
Frederic Raphael, is deliberately slow, if a little too slow, and never
really exciting. Occasionally, it just meanders on a bit.</P>
<P>One last note: those watching Eyes Wide Shut for the sexual content will
most likely be disappointed. Unless you worship Nicole Kidman, the film is
curiously unerotic. Perhaps Warner's should of advertised the other merits
of the film rather than the sex.</P>
<P>Eyes Wide Shut is a fitting movie to end Kubricks career. It's no
embarrassment, it's not perfect, it sums up what was great and not so great
about Kubrick. This review is not truly accurate: it will probably take
multiple viewings to truly understand what is going on here. But as many
people will only see this once, the verdict is: Eyes Wide Shut is a
interesting, somewhat overlong drama with enough style to keep it going.</P>
