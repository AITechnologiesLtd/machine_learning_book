<P>Although the movie previews were the first time I'd heard of MIDNIGHT IN THE
GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL, it seems important to mention that it is derived from
John Berendt's best-selling, non-fiction book. Although rumors have led me to
believe it is a loose adaption of the book, this is still the source behind
the film.</P>
<P>In the movie, John Kelso (John Cusack) is a New York writer sent to the
lavishly quaint town of Savannah, Georgia to cover a locally famous annual
Christmas party for "Town & Country" magazine. The party is being thrown by
the extremely rich, genteel Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey), an antiques dealer
whose mansion consumes an entire block. It doesn't take long before John is
exposed to the many eccentric characters of the seemingly peaceful town,
including a man who walks a dead dog and another man who keeps house flies
attached to him at all times.</P>
<P>When John arrives at the party, Jim befriends him right away. On a tour of
Jim's luxurious estate, we are introduced to another key character: Billy
Hanson (GATTACA's Jude Law), a profane, often drunk, blue-collar employee of
Jim's . . . and also his lover! When Billy is found shot to death in Jim's
house the next morning, a murder mystery unravels and John quickly decides to
stay in Savannah with hopes of turning this into a definite best-seller.</P>
<P>Luckily the film doesn't fall into a John Grisham-like legal suspense
thriller, which is a good thing since it could have so easily done so.
MIDNIGHT stays fresh, original, and surprisingly upbeat. This is due in large
part to the spectacular debut of the Lady Chablis, a black transvestite who
plays herself (himself?). Chablis is never off the mark,  seemingly one up on
the script. Not only does she provide the biggest and best laughs, but she by
far provides some of the best acting of the year. She *should* get an Oscar
nomination, as long as they can figure out which category to put her in - Best
Supporting Actor or Best Supporting Actress?</P>
<P>The always charming John Cusack proves once again why he is so impervious to
failure. No matter what role we see Cusack in, he becomes the character with
ease, and this is no exception. Kevin Spacey, who is already developing quite
a following, is terrific as the Southern-gent turned murderer. But was it
cold-blood or merely self defense? Go see this movie and find out! It's well
worth it!</P>
<P>Clint Eastwood does quite a nice job directing this film. Visually enriching
and eloquent, MIDNIGHT possesses such a realistic (if not surreal) feel, that
you'll expect to find a cold glass of lemonade waiting for you outside of the
theater. The very end of the film, which I won't give away, is of special
note. I will say, however, that it was marvelously done and very intriguing in
it's almost afterthought-like way.</P>
<P>The most notable problems with MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL are a
few lacking characters, particularly John's supposed love interest Mandy
Nichols, played by Clint's daughter Alison Eastwood. Such a seemingly
important figure should have received a great deal more development and screen
time, but sadly she is wasted and becomes a feeble attribute to the film.
You'd think in a two and a half hour film that they could have paid more
attention to her. Aside from that, MIDNIGHT is really a well-done film that
will probably not receive as much praise and commercial success as it
deserves. I urge you to see for yourself.</P>
