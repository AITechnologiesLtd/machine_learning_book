                 Murder By Any Other Name--C'est La "Meme"
                       A film review by Gerard Martin

<P>     In Jon Amiel's film COPYCAT, a vicious and premeditated act of
murder is more than a perfunctory plot concept, more than a
cinematic reconstruction of a fatal event, and more than an immoral
lethal act.  Long before psychologist Helen Hudson, played by
Sigourney Weaver, takes a magnifying glass to COPYCAT's first murder
scene glossies, the act of murder is defined as something more
elaborate than the mere slaying of a life.</P>
<P>     Serial murder as the art of semi-ritualized killing would
ordinarily be the movie's principal overriding theme if not for the
unexpected presence of a possibly clandestine narrative element that
finds its analog somewhere in the modern-day dint of a powerfully
ubiquitous communication media.</P>
<P>     In today's rapid-transit communication environment, "media" is,
afterall, the plural of medium, and a copy of a copy is often far more
than the doubling sum of its number.  At some point, a copy or
replication of thought, point of view, bias or prejudice becomes
"memetic"--so many replicating components seeking to attach themselves
to value systems of previously existing memes.</P>
<P>     A "meme" is defined by cultural evolutionists as a
cognitive-behavioral pattern that can be transmitted from one
individual to another through communication.  Memes are ideas that
function in the mind in much the same way as a gene or virus would
function in the body.  Just as viruses can leap from body to body,
ideas will leap from mind to mind.</P>
<P>     COPYCAT begins with a birds-eye view of a university campus grassy
glade.  Students have flocked together in groups of two and three.  As
our point of view descends, we also see briefly where a female student
is silently reading a book.</P>
<P>     As our field of vision descends even further, a building appears
in the distance.  A narrative voice-over is heard describing the scene
of a murder.  As the scene changes to a view inside the building, the
spoken words are emanating from a large projection screen.  A more
complete view of the stage shows Dr. Helen Hudson, the speaker behind
the podium, who has just written an authoritative textbook on serial
killers.  She is on a publicity lecture tour.</P>
<P>     In a matter of seconds, three powerful media--the book, the
lecture and the television screen--have been introduced and revealed
as the powerful agents of dissemination that they are.  Briefly our
attention is directed into the shadows of a capacity audience where FBI
statistics would suggest that possibly one of our nation's "35 white
males aged 20 to 35 years" serial killers might be lurking.  Seconds
later in the lecture hall audience--a hand gesture, a silently mouthed
threat, a revolver cocking, hesitation at the podium--and we know that
he has just been located.  Signs are evident that Dr. Helen Hudson is
about to begin the ride of her life.</P>
<P>     Minutes later into the story but months later in real life; having
survived a brutal assault on her life, Helen Hudson remains a
house-bound victim suffering the agony of acute agoraphobia and
intermittent attacks of anxiety.  She is a prisoner in her own home.
We can see her but Dr. Hudson is not sure that she wants to see us.</P>
<P>     The murder rate in San Francisco must be comparable to most any
other city of its size in North America.  But what makes a series of
murders serial? This is where the insights of Dr. Hudson become
inestimable.  Though evidence indicates that each of the killings was
performed by a different person, Dr. Hudson insists on a serial
pattern for the crimes.  After fourteen frantic attempts to communicate
her knowledge to police, homicide investigating officer M.J.  Monahan,
played by Holly Hunter, takes the telephone receiver only to quickly
judges her "knowledge" to be inconsequential.  Monahan is, of course,
soon apprised of the psychologist doctor's estimable credentials.  We
very quickly see them together again at Dr. Hudson's apartment where
apologies and requests for assistance are negotiated and fulfilled.</P>
<P>     Dr. Hudson is perhaps correct in her assessment of a serial
pattern to the crimes.  Yet, soon realized is the full extent to which
this is no ordinary killing spree.  But how could she know? The serial
murderer, played by William McNamara, very meticulously pays homage to
every detail of other previous slayings by past nefarious darlings of
the broadcast media--Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy, Son of Sam, the
Boston Strangler and others--who were all made famous through
relentless media coverage.  It is as though he became those people and
they became his modus operandi!</P>
<P>     The COPYCAT nature of the crime surely suggests that the victims
of the story were killed more by media "meme" than by mere mortal man.
Memes of a harmful nature can obviously be very deadly when we consider
how the spread of thoughts and ideas might actually be analogous to the
rapid spread of a deadly virus.  Instead of moving from body the body,
the analogy would be a rapid or exponential ideological movement from
mind to mind.  Indeed, if direct bodily contact is necessary for the
spread of a disease, what different kinds of direct contact might
assist the spread of a meme?</P>
<P>     We might first ask ourselves about some of the more popular memes
in existence.  Ethologist and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins,
who coined the term meme, gives us a host of them--the belief in Santa
Clause, the existence of the tooth fairy, and then, for the adults,
potentially parasitic memes like the advertiser's slogan or jingle.</P>
<P>     But what of some of the arguably more deadly memes like those
leading up to the events of the post World War II Marxist-Leninist
Soviet Union, the soon thereafter immense military industrial build-up
during the cold-war, and present-day neo-Nazi assertions that the
killing of six million Jews never happened?</P>
<P>     Never missing an instance, COPYCAT offers us an utterly complete
tour of every circuit, every pathway, every promiscuous avenue by which
memes and their carriers can reach our eyes, ears and other vital
organs.  Even Dr. Hudson, who would never leave her apartment, is not
immune.  The best display of this is the full extent to which she is
hard-wired to the Internet--multiple graphical windows on her computer
workstation screen, real-time chess games in colorful three dimensions,
and extravagant video animation with full teleconferencing potential.
As if the most important carriers were limited to a computer desktop,
there is then her television, her police radio scanner and almost
always the telephone, right? If still not convinced, then listen for a
catchy tune by THE POLICE.</P>
<P>     COPYCAT gives us the usual for our money.  However, considering
that this movie is riding in the wake of other successes of the genre
like THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and, more recently, SEVEN, the "usual" is
understandably not always enough.  Fortunately, COPYCAT offers more
than the usual.  In addition to intense co-protagonist performances by
Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter, this film is brimming with subtle
intelligence and satire--even from the villains!  In a cinematic
portrayal where the tiniest memetic details can echo and reverberate up
and down through the multi-threaded channels of our media-tuned
make-up, this movie is a treat that, like all good thrillers, will soon
bare rewatching!</P>
