<P>I suppose that China is only at this day in time, been able to finally
discuss some of the problems which they have had for several centuries, and
the forms which are readier than most to show it, happen to be that of the
motion pictures.  And one of the first themes which I have seen, have dealt
mostly with the advent of women as second class citizens, servants to the
male superior, to whom she is basically a slave, a  mistress who has to bear
a boy, or they are dumped, or killed.</P>
<P>Zhang Yimou's first film ( to my knowledge ) is about a young lady that gets
bought out by a new master.  But he is rough, and unkind, and the new
mistress ends up receiving some solace in the friendship of one of the son's
in the clan.  But this fateful union proves to be terribly destructive.  The
affair produces a boy, who is brought up along, until one day, the couple's
affair is finally coming to a head.  The master of the house has become
disabled, and now is at the mercy of the mistress and her boyfriend.
However, as the child grows, he befriends the old man, though he
accidentally kills him.  And the old man has convinced the youngster that he
is the father, not the lover.  The young man grows angrier as time goes by,
and in the end kills the lover.  At that point
the mother sets the silk ( fabric dyeing ) factory on fire and puts an end
to the whole tragic affair, from the tainted marriage to the tragic love
affair.</P>
<P>It is interesting to notice that very much like the film which Zhang Yimou
would eventually do ( RAISE THE RED LANTERN ), the focus is strictly on the
event of the woman's involvement with her lover, which, has no choice but to
fall into a tragedy
since they are the ones violating the norm.  And it is convenient to notice
that by concentrating on the character's individual desires, the film pretty
much absolves the social atmosphere from its culpability in creating a
system where women are expendable depending on the desires of the master of
the house.  I suppose, that by doing this, the government can blame the
state of affairs on a system long gone, which
was corrupt, and which Mao Tse Tung tried to end.  And the film can find
funds, and avoid criticism.</P>
<P>In a more subtle manner, the film also decries the lack of modernization,
not only in the actual factory, but also in the way of thinking.  In the
beginning a buyer asks the
master why he does not upgrade his factory and modernize it, and the owner
dismisses it as not wishing to have too many people in there.  In other
words rugged individuality is the main reason why such a large country has
to be ruled with an iron fist...only to pay for it later.</P>
<P>The very attractive Gong Li, plays the role of Judou, and is actually very
good, though it appears that here she has the capacity of really becoming
very emotional, in contrast
to her role in LANTERN, which is so subdued.  The difference might just be
that in JuDou, the characters are commoners, where in LANTERN they are upper
class.</P>
<P>The film is nice, though very sad and tragic.  And it is well filmed, though
the symbolic edges during the film tend to appear a bit old for us, who have
seen so many films, but
very effective for a society that has not seen that many films.  And the
turn of events is actually very unexpected, which is really the product of a
well told story, something
which Zhang Yimou has definitely displayed in his work.</P>
<PRE>SEE IT.
