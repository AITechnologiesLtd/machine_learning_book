<P>This film, if not a power house, is really a surprise. It catches you when
you are not ready for it. And it is a heart breaking story, the kind that
one wishes had a better go at it, though we can see from the start that it
is nearly impossible.</P>
<P>And it takes a cast of focused actors to bring something like this to life,
and make it work.</P>
<P>With a terrible title, that does not do its story, or anything in the film
any kind of justice, this film really hits home at the differences between
many of us, be they just ethnocentric, or just plain, physical conditions
that are difficult to overcome.</P>
<P>Powder is the story of a boy that has been kept in captivity since his
birth, because he has a terrible skin condition that prevents him from
catching much sunlight. And he has been kept in a basement for most of his
early years, until one day when the caretaker grandparent dies. He has been
well taught, can read, and do many things, that otherwise, most can not do.
He also has some apparent abilities with lightning, or most forms of
electric energies, which he is capable of exchanging energies with.  And it
is the psychic abilities and powers that eventually gets him some attention.</P>
<P>He is placed in school, and becomes the laughing stock, but he also learns
there, that while those who are physically stronger than him may hurt him,
he can hurt them with something else. And he wastes no time putting that
energy to good use, from teaching a sheriff's deputy a large lesson in life,
about the misuse of guns, and the breaking of the law.</P>
<P>And, as the sad story continues, he meets a girl that comes to like him, and
vice versa, only to have her taken away from him in the end of the film,
like he is not deserving of anyone at all.  And this sends the film into its
climactic end.</P>
<P>POWDER is a sad film, but one that can not be ignored much, as its strengths
are beauty, of the kind that most films, can not even touch.  Some hint at
it, this film shows it. And though much of it is in the characters' minds,
sometimes, the moments are just breath taking, and totally special, to the
point of making your skin crawl.  Were this not handled deftly by a director
that can understand these things, this would have become a who cares story.
As it is handled, with so much affection, it is inspiring, something that
just isn't found in to many movies nowadays.</P>
<P>Mary Steenburgen is very good as a bit of the protective mother that she is
becoming. Jeff Goldblum, though always appearing fake, comes off as
interesting as a teacher  that is just surprised, as is the whole class, by
the example of electricity that they have been shown.  And he spends the
rest of the film trying to figure it all
out, at least the connection between mind, body and the electrical happening
which he witnessed.</P>
<P>But the spoils in this film go to the character of Powder, and the young
girl he meets, with whom he can not have a relationship on account of a
terribly protective father.</P>
<P>But the rest of the film is amazing, and a terribly enjoyable trip. We can
sense that this film, or character can not win, but we know that while he is
around, everyone is going to sample something that they will forever
remember. I dare say that we will, too.</P>
<PRE>Very strong content.
Excellent acting. Not overboard at all.
