DEATH OF THE PARTY</PRE>
<PRE>HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL
Directed by William Malone
Screenplay by Dick Beebe 
With Geoffrey Rush, Famke Janssen
UA South     R   95 min.</PRE>
<P>     Where was Wes Craven when we really needed him?  "House on Haunted
Hill", a gloss-and-guts remake of William Castle's 1958 horror flick, is
left in the journeyman hands of William Malone ("Creature").  It starts
with some nice campy fun, but it's designed as a thrill ride, and a 95
minute thrill ride gets long.
     Geoffrey Rush ("Shine", "Shakespeare in Love") reprises Vincent
Price's role as a billionaire amusement park tycoon who rents a haunted
house to throw a birthday party for his wife (Famke Janssen) and invites
four guests to whom he puts this proposal: stay the whole night, stay
alive, and leave in the morning with a cashier's check for a million bucks
(oh, inflation; Price only offered $10,000).  
     The joint is the former Vanacutt Institution for the Criminally
Insane, a towering structure closed and haunted since a grisly inmate
rebellion in the '31 left everyone within its walls horribly slaughtered. 
Now it's overseen by the nervous Pritchett (Chris Kattan), a descendant of
the evil Dr. Vanacutt.  But as soon as the four guests -- Eddie (Taye
Diggs), a baseball player, Sara (Ali Larter), a pretty blonde executive,
Melissa (Bridgette Wilson), a pretty blonde game show hostess, and Dr.
Blackburn (Peter Gallagher) -- are assembled, along with their host and
hostess, the house locks itself up tight as a drum, and there's no escape. </P>
<P>     That's all you need to know about the characters.  The movie
concentrates on scaring them, not developing them.  Mostly it lures them
into the basement, a dank place packed with ghosts and grisly displays.  It
hacks them up, twists some back to life only to devour them again, crawls
with creepy effects, and throws in a few random naked women when things
threaten to get unbearably tedious.
     When Castle unveiled the original in '58 he had skeletons dropping
from the ceiling and ambulances stationed outside. At the showing I saw at
the UA South, the lights and the FM between-the-shows broadcast kept coming
on during the movie.  I don't know if that was a device or not.  It was a
little weird.</P>
