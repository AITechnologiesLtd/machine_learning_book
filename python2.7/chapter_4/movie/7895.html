<PRE>                           THE FIFTH ELEMENT
                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>
<P>I truly enjoyed the visual beauty of Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' and
in certain respects, director Luc Besson has achieved with the 'Fifth
Element',  what can be described as a visually beautiful movie.</P>
<P>The concept of five elements coming together to protect earth is a good
base for any plot. Its opening scenes has a similar reminiscent feel to
'Star Gate'; the movie is fast moving and is never for a moment dull,
with snappy, alternative music to guide it along. The big disappointment
is it's ending which becomes cliched, when Korben has to profess his
love to the fifth element before she can perform her duty (not so
perfect after all).</P>
<P>Part of the promotion for this movie was 'The Fifth Element It Must Be
Found.' In all fairness they should have added 'Where Did They Stash The
Other Four?' as much of the movie madly revolves about finding them; and
the advertisements for MacDonalds is shameless but nevertheless
entertaining.</P>
<P>People have been talking about the intricacies of Blade Runner's plot
since it's release more than a decade ago. Who was the fifth escapee
replicant? Was it Deckard? Or was it Rachael? This makes an intriguing
after-dinner conversation (+/- argument), believe me.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, nobody will be having long discussions about why the
earth doesn't have more moons if 'Darkness' returned every five thousand
years, or why human space was so badly patrolled allowing the Mangalore
fighters to destroy the Mondoshawan craft, or why the Fifth Element goes
all soft and gooey when she reads about war and man's other destructive
qualities, then has second thoughts about saving mankind. Hmmmmm.</P>
<P>This movie will be remembered if not for it's plot, for its memorable
scenes like Lee Loo jumping of a sky scraper, the police car line up,
the Chinese sail boat take-away, and the enchanting blue Diva singing
operetta as Lee Loo fights, and will inevitably become what is
considered a cult classic.</P>
