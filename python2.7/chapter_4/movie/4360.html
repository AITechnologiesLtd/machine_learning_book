<PRE>                                  AMATEUR
                       A film review by Ben Guaraldi
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Guaraldi</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Hal Hartley
Photographed by: Michael Spiller
Written by: Hal Hartley
Edited by: Steve Hamilton
Music by: Hal Hartley and Jeffrey Taylor
Starring: Isabelle Huppert, Martin Donovan, Elina Lowensohn,
          Damian Young, Chuck Montgomery, David Simonds</P>
<P>     AMATEUR involves you.  One becomes attached to the eccentric
characters and their confused lives right from the start.  This should
not often be considered an extraordinary feat for a movie, but with the
way this film jumps wildly about from philosophical commentary to deeply
felt emotion to murder scenes right out of Monty Python, this trait is
somewhat surprising.  Add to that acting that is nearly uniformly dry,
characters that develop with massive contradictions and scenes that have
no jokes (yet still manage to be quite funny), and one finds oneself
with the surreal aura that makes this preposterous story believable.</P>
<P>     But let us begin with the characters, who are something to behold:
Isabelle, the nymphomaniacal (and virginal) ex-nun (Isabelle Huppert);
Thomas, the amnesiac pornographer who wants to lead a new life (Martin
Donovan II); Sofia, the child porn star whose naivete is intriguing for
one who has lived so long on the seamy side of life (Elina Lowensohn);
Edward, the sympathetic accountant who is electrocuted and becomes
insane (Damian Young); Jan and Kurt, the well-cultured ex-accountant
hit-men (Chuck Montgomery and David Simonds); and the deeply bass
disembodied voice of the double-crossing Jacques.  To even conceive of
these wildly anti-stereotypical characters is one thing;  to integrate
them into a coherent story is quite another.  Hal Hartley, the writer
and director, manages to do both, weaving in new characters and
sub-plots with the seeming ease that life weaves such things into our
experience.</P>
<P>     But Hartley doesn't truly believe in the randomness of life, as
betrayed by his use of color;  these characters descend from bright
colors to black and white as they get deeper and deeper into the
underworld.  It is inevitable for the color to disturb them again, with
the bright blue of the police officers' uniforms at the end.  Even with
this idea of pre-destiny, Hartley sets up an interesting dichotomy;
Isabelle says that God has told her that it is her mission to save these
people, but Hartley has quite a different idea, ending with the
climactic slaughter at the nunnery's steps.</P>
<P>     And yet what is the point to this entire movie?  The key to
understanding this is within the title:  Amateur.  This word refers to
Isabelle, who struggles to be both a nymphomaniac and a pornographer;
Thomas, who is finding what it is to be a new person and Sofia, who
attempts to blackmailing for the first time.  Then one must look at the
last line, "Yes, I knew this man."  Isabelle still knew little or
anything of Thomas' past life or past wrongs, but she still asserts that
she knows who he is, clearly saying that it is different than who he
was.  Herein the author makes a significant argument for the ability to
start anew.</P>
<P>     And it is this argument, not any of the crowd-pleasing bawdy humor
that it is at the heart of the film.  Hartley's almost bored treatment
of the bleeding heart missing persons cop coupled with his rushed
montage of electrocuted Edward's escapades show that his heart is not
truly in these scenes but is more in the deadpan, dryly humorous
philosophizing that fills the rest of the movies.  Perchance, however,
Hartley will soon find a way to tie these two widely different brands
of humor together.  Then he will have enough practice in both to make
films that adhere them together and cohere as a whole.</P>
