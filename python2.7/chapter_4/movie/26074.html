<PRE>THE WATCHER</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* *</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Joe Charbanic
Written by: Darcy Meyers, David Elliot, Clay Ayers</P>
<P>Joel Campbell (James Spader) is an FBI agent whose life was destroyed by one 
case. The case involved a killer named David Griffin (Keanu Reeves), who 
would study young women for weeks before strangling them with piano wire. 
During the course of his exploits, and Campbell's search for him, the hunt 
turned into a game for Griffin. Now Campbell has moved from Los Angeles, 
where the murders took place, to Chicago to escape the case. He's also 
seeing a psychiatrist, named Polly (Marisa Tomei), who is helping him slowly 
put his life back together. However, David Griffin isn't done with him yet. 
The killer has followed Campbell to the windy city and is trying to make 
their game more interesting. He's sending Campbell photos of the young women 
he will kill, one day before he murders them. Campbell and the Chicago 
police have that much time to find the woman in the photos before Griffin 
kills them, and Griffin won't interfere in any way. Campbell has to fight 
his personal demons about the case and face the fact that he and Griffin are 
connected. Time is running out too, since the killer has gone through four 
of the sins, there are only three left, and - oh, sorry, wrong movie.</P>
<P>Newcomer Joe Charbanic's idiotic film, "The Watcher", couldn't have come at 
a better time. I just finished a review of "Se7en", in which I said for 
every good serial killer movie we get, we're hit with a dozen poor ones. 
Well, we got "The Cell", and "The Watcher", so only ten more to go. I don't 
know about you, but that brings a smile to my face (that was sarcasm by the 
way). I will give "The Watcher" one thing, it's bad enough that you'll get 
quite a few unintentional laughs (I actually laughed harder at this movie 
than at many so called comedies this year). "The Watcher" bills itself as a 
horror/mystery/thriller. Let's take a look at those, shall we? Horror? Well, 
it's kind of horrifying to think this was made, but other than that, notta. 
Mystery? Uhh, I'll give it away right now. Keanu Reeves is the killer, 
sorry. Thriller? Aside from being thrilled when the end credits rolled, 
didn't happen. So what kind of movie is this? I haven't the foggiest. I 
don't think dull qualifies as a genre yet (but thanks to this year, it's 
getting there), but once it does this movie will fall nicely under that 
category.</P>
<P>The acting, the acting, where do I begin? Well, as everyone knows by now, 
Keanu Reeves is indeed the black hole of acting. In other words, not only 
does he act horribly himself, but his very presence can make other actors 
look bad. You want to know what made "The Watcher" look even worse? I was so 
bored by the proceedings I was actually looking forward to Reeves' 
appearances on screen so I could be entertained in some way (you'd be amazed 
how entertaining bad acting can be). James Spader (Of all his films, I've 
only liked him in "Two Days in the Valley") gives his usual emotionless 
performance, no surprise there. I was, however, surprised that the one 
intentionally humorous (at least I think it was intentional) scene involved 
Spader displaying some good comic talent. In the scene, Spader is yanking 
people off the streets, forcing them to look at a girl's photo. I know, it 
doesn't sound funny, and it wasn't hysterical or anything, but it was 
somewhat amusing watching the peoples' faces when they get yanked off the 
street. Should I spend time on Marissa Tomei? Why bother, Charbanic sure 
didn't spend any on her. You'll see Ernie Hudson's ("Ghostbusters") name in 
the credits, but don't bother looking for him since I think he appears in 
two scenes.</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong, I have a multitude of problems with this movie, but my 
biggest one was the suspension of disbelief factor. Now, on a scale from one 
to ten, your average Schwarzenegger movie has a SD factor of seven or eight. 
"The Watcher" nearly broke the charts. You want an example, eh? Alright, try 
an entire city hunting for one girl, her picture all over the place, cops 
hunting every building, and not only does no one find her, but she doesn't 
notice any of this? To top that one off, she works in a bloody mall! She's 
surrounded by television screens, all showing her face and shouting her 
name. I'm as oblivious as the next fellow (okay, maybe a little more so), 
but you've got to be kidding me. I guess it's possible this was all supposed 
to be some comment about how people ignore each other in a big city, but if 
that's the case it sure didn't fit in with the rest of the movie (plus we 
already know that, this wasn't exactly groundbreaking). I also have to give 
the film this, I did learn a few things. For example, I didn't know you 
could hotwire a car in less than five seconds. Keanu does it though, just by 
snapping the steering console open and turning a wire. Neat, eh? I also 
learned that police helicopters serve one purpose only: to light the 
killer's way while he makes his escape. Hey, I didn't say it taught me 
anything useful.</P>
<P>Perhaps in the hands of a more competent director (or even a film school 
student) this picture would have worked (but probably not). Instead, we get 
Charbanic trying such "innovative" techniques as showing things through the 
killer's eyes by making the screen go blurry, black and white, and shaking 
the camera around. How does this guy even move, much less stalk young women 
when his eye sight is that bad? Charbanic also has an irritating affinity 
for flashbacks. He loves them so much in fact, that he shows the same ones 
repeatedly. If that wasn't bad enough, they're filmed in that same "killer 
vision" we see when viewing things through Keanu's eyes. I guess I should 
mention a few good points, so here goes. There's one supporting character, a 
cop named Hollis (Chris Ellis), who provides some entertaining moments (he 
has a phone conversation during a high speed chase for example). There is 
also a nice score playing during the film's very long opening credits, but 
unfortunately the soundtrack turns into your typical popular music 
compilation after that. The film only runs 93 minutes, but I sure thought 
I'd been in the theater for a week or so. I'd recommend it to those who love 
unbelievable, cliched serial killer movies (it's sad, but such people are 
out there. You know who you are) and give it a generous two out of five 
stars.</P>
