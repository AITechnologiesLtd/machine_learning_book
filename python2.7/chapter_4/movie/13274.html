<P>Cyranno is a good film.  In fact, it is much better than the first film
version of this story which brought Jose Ferrer an Oscar.</P>
<P>I am not a Gerard Depardieu fan.  To me, he is to the French, what Arnold
and Bruce are to the American fans.  Heart throbs.  Sometimes I am glad I am
not a woman, to have those tastes.   But Gerard, does stand out in this
film, in a role that can fit his size and lack of ability.  He has been
taught how to  read poetry, or at least, how to say it.  And at the same
time, the film is so well directed, that it probably hides Depardieu's
inability's, while allowing  for his strengths.  As in his past characters,
in many small time films ( Jean de Florette is the exception ) he usually
played the part of bad boy, or lover  who took advantage of his many
girlfriends, and a good for nothing character, his brooding tendencies seem
to fit this character.  While Cyranno is quick to his feet with his epee, he
is slow to his feet with his honesty, and love.  And the procrastination
lasts a lifetime, which the poor girl Roxanne never has  realized, or
figured out.  Either Cyranno is too shy, or this girl just is too
naive, and not a good companion for him, who is so intellectually
stimulated. After 30 years, their love is still not discussed.  Only on his
last words is he capable of telling his beloved about all his letters, and
his tries to reach her attention.</P>
<P>It is a statement on the ideological ways of youth, who would rather get
involved with an idea they like, rather than a person who might be good for
them, and then wonder why things didn't work out, when they could try the
ones who really care first.  Roxanne is infatuated by the young fighter and
soldier whom she thinks is trying to reach her.  The young soldier dies and
Roxanne is grief stricken, but never notices that the beautiful letters
still come to her.</P>
<P>The best thing in this movie are the costumes and the moody settings.  The
weakest is the whole ending, when it gets a bit soggy.</P>
<P>The script is written by today's best known film writer, JEAN CLAUDE
CARRIERE, whose material has now graced the stages and film screens for over
four  decades, always with satisfying results.  The talent is the mix of
well  known poetry, and lines, with a setting that is excellent, and an
atmosphere
that is really  beautiful and well lit.  With such nice costumes, if you
don't do a good job acting it all through, you just don't have it.</P>
<P>Anna Brochet plays the role of Roxanne, and is a bit on the flaky
( youthful ) side and loses the innocence as she gets older, but never
figures out who  her pursuer is although it is obvious to us.  Depardieu
starts strongly and  ends weakly.  It may have merited his Oscar nomination.
He is good.  But the  movie is much better.</P>
<P>The Steve Martin film was taken from this story, and while it is funny, it
does not have the 'tragic lovers' feel that this film and original story
does.  The Martin film is a good natured love story, based loosely on a good
story, with a much better result.  If you are, or were, a French student,
you have read  this play, with its old French style.  The poetry is good.</P>
<P>See it, when you feel like seeing something different.</P>
<P>This film won a bunch of awards in many of Europe's film festivals.</P>
