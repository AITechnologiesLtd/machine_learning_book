Grade:  B+</P>
<P>Somewhere out in space, the peaceful Thermians are being slaughtered by a
belligerent race of lizard people.  Their last hope:  Commander Peter Quincy
Taggart and the valiant crew of the Starship Protector, heroes the Thermians
know from Earth's broadcasts.  The Thermians travel to Earth to find Taggart. 
One little problem:  the Thermians don't know that the "historical documents"
they've received from Earth are actually episodes of "Galaxy Quest," a TV
series that was cancelled in 1982.</P>
<P>Eighteen years after the show ended, the cast of "Galaxy Quest" is still in
costume, making personal appearances at conventions, spouting catch phrases,
and lamenting the lack of other opportunities.  William Sha - uh, I mean -
Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), who played Commander Taggart, is an egotistical boob
who doesn't realize how much his former co-stars hate him.  Alexander Dane
(Alan Rickman) played alien scientist Dr. Lazarus and now whines constantly
that he was once a Shakespearean actor.  Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver) wore a
tight, low-cut as Lt. Tawny Madison, whose only job aboard the Protector was to
repeat what the computer said.  Laidback Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub) was the
ship's engineer, and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell of TV's "Veronica's Closet")
was the child star at the steering wheel.</P>
<P>A contingent of Thermians led by Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni of TV's "Just Shoot
Me") scoop up a hung-over Jason and whisk him up to a working replica of the
Protector to negotiate with General Sarris, leader of the lizard people. 
Accustomed to personal appearances with fans who earnestly believe the show is
real, Jason only realizes that he's actually been on a spaceship after the
Thermians beam him back to Earth.  By that afternoon, the Thermians are back
for more help, and this time Jason brings the rest of the cast, including Guy
Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), who played the ill-fated "Crewman # 6" in one episode
of "Quest."  To survive, the cast will have to learn how to play their parts
for real.</P>
<P>"Galaxy Quest" does for science fiction television what "Austin Powers" did for
60's spy movies. The script is smart and on target.  It's filled with funny
moments that satirize ridiculous plots, motifs, and characters common to the
genre as well as attacking the obsessive fan culture that still surrounds shows
decades after they're cancelled.  My favorite sequence has Jason and Gwen
racing through the bowels of the ship to stop it from blowing up when they're
confronted by a passageway lined with huge metal choppers sliding menacingly up
and down.  Gwen:  "It doesn't serve any purpose!  Why would they even build
anything like that!"  Jason:  "It was on the show!"  Gwen:  "The show was badly
written!" </P>
<P>The cast is filled with comic talent, so much so that I was a little bummed
that Tony Shalhoub and Daryl Mitchell didn't get more screen time.  Sigourney
Weaver stood out (in more ways than one - considering the way her costume was
cut to accentuate her breasts), reminding me of the comic flair she showed
years ago in "Ghostbusters" and "Working Girl."</P>
<P>On the down side, the losers-rise-to-the-occasion-and-become-heroes plot is
predictable and thin.  More bothersome to me, however, were the serious moments
as Thermians are tortured by the evil lizard guys.  These scenes weighed down
the comedy that followed.  The theme of genocide (the small band of Thermians
aboard the ship are the last of their race) seems inappropriately heavy for
this movie.</P>
<P>Bottom Line:  There's more laughter than lulls, and I had a great time.</P>
