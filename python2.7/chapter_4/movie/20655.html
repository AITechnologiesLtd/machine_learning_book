CHOCOLATE WAR, THE (director/writer: Keith Gordon; screenwriter:from a
novel by Robert Cormier; cinematographer: cast: Brother Leon (John
Glover), Jerry Renault (Ilan Mitchell-Smith), Archie (Wally Ward),
Goober (Corey Gunnestad), Obie (Doug Hutchison), Carter (Adam Baldwin),

<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Robert Cormier's young adult novel is about Trinity, a boys' preparatory
school for low-to-middle-class Catholics. In the film version the hero
succumbs to all the violence around him and gets his revenge, as by the
film's end he happily wins a fist fight from his nemesis.</P>
<P>This directorial debut by the former actor Gordon (he was a psycho in
John Carpenter's Christine), is really a tale about fascism. It is
viewed from two sides of school life, one is from the side of the
malevolent new head of the school, Brother Leon (John Glover), who is
insanely mad, as he wraps his success in the school around how he can
get the students to sell more boxes of chocolate in its annual sale for
charity than the other head master did in his tenure. This, he thinks,
will surely impress the school's trustees. The other story is about how
the Vigils, a secret student organization meeting in the school
basement, also tries to control the student body of non-Vigils by making
them follow given assignments. The assignments might be in the nature of
a prank, like unscrewing the seats in a classroom, or they might be more
politically motivated, like making students sell chocolates for the
school so that their organization can attain more power in the school.
Their snake-like leader is a clever bully, Archie (Ward), whose sense of
control is challenged by a shy, entering freshman, Jerry Renault
(Smith), who refuses to sell the chocolates even after his 10-day
assignment by the Vigils to not sell the chocolates is over. They view
his rebellious action as a threat to their power and do everything they
can to make his life miserable, including a cowardly physical attack
upon him.</P>
<P>Everything that could be wrong about this school is wrong with it, as
the classroom teachers, the brothers, all have crosses dangling from
their robes, as if to remind the viewer that religion was something no
one in this school believed in anymore, it was just something to be worn
for show. It is so perverse a place, that there seems to be no way to
function in it without selling your soul. The non-conformist act by
Jerry leaves a sour taste in his mouth, as the Vigils, linking
themselves to the new head in an oral agreement that benefits both
parties, psychologically challenge Jerry's sanity as they act as gestapo
storm troopers trying to make him an example so that there will be no
more dissension on campus.</P>
<P>The acting is superb. The story is gloomy and perceptive. The problem I
had with the film lies in the sense that the only two decent students in
the film, Renault and his friend Goober (Corey), have no recourse but to
conform. There seems to be no real voice of reason. The heroes are too
dull and without any real conviction to fight these fascists they are up
against. All the other peripheral Vigil characters are weak-minded and
willing to do anything to advance their own cause in the world. Carter
(Adam) is a physical bully, and an all-to-willing strong-arm for the
group dictator. Frank Bolo (Landon) is a rotten and stupid thug, who
can't even look good in his school blazer like the other student
fascists he wants to impress with his brashness. Archie, as student
dictator, is a despicable worm and treacherous soul, who already has the
misguided demeanor of an elderly tyrant. Obie (Doug) is the creepy guy
who is a behind the scenes player, currying favor with anyone in power.
All-in-all, a pretty disgusting lot, which makes this film a tough
watch, with not enough elasticity to its story than to be more than a
coming-of-age film that ultimately brings up the wrong lesson in life to
learn: that it is sometimes better to conform than to rebel. The film
itself lacked any sustaining energy to show that it really cared about
the enemy it was fighting. It looked like it was too in love with the
evil elite being depicted and invested too much in their presence to
properly distance themselves from them and tell the story of the
resistance fighter, like it needed to be told.</P>
