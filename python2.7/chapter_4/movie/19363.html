<PRE>" American Pie "  * * * 1/2</PRE>
<P>    In trying to give proper praise to AMERICAN PIE, the drop-dead funniest
film of 1999, I compare it to other recent teen comedies, like CAN¹T HARDLY
WAIT and SHE¹S ALL THAT.  Movies which have zero ambition, go for the cheap,
easy laugh and nothing more, and dare not delve into the intricacies of what
adolescent sexual confusion might actually entail.  Movies concerned with
plot contrivance (will the geeky guy get the prom queen; will the girl be
able to figure out a devious bet against her, in time to fall in love), and
nothing that has to do with real life.</P>
<P>AMERICAN PIE puts them right in their place, with honesty and
unparalleled situational humor - embarrassing and rude as it may be.  Simply
put, this movie rocks.  Not about anything in particular, PIE focuses on a
group of high school guys who, three weeks before graduation, vow to lose
their virginity as of prom night, out of dignity if nothing else; because,
"It¹s tradition.  Like the Rose Bowl."  Oz (or Nova, played by a marvelous
Chris Klein) starts off the cliché misogynist pig jock, but then joins the
school choir, in hopes of wooing the pretty Heather (Mena Suvari), only to
realize his sensitive side.  Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) already has a
girlfriend, Vicky (the sexy Tara Reid), but she¹s holding out for just the
right time to consummate their relationship; "It¹s not a Space Shuttle
launch.  It¹s sex"Š love that line.  Jim (a break-through Jason Biggs) has a
slight crush on foreign exchange student Nadia, but faces more complicated
issues with masturbation, mainly on the homefront, to wonderful comic
result; the uncomfortable discussions with his father (a sly Eugene Levy),
about the birds and bees, are perfect gems of comic timing.</P>
<P>Will they succeed in getting laid?  No matter.  What makes AMERICAN PIE
great is its intrinsic sweetness.  Even the narrow-minded Stifler (Seann W.
Scott), who accidentally drinks "pale ale", has a core of innocence ­
albeit, buried far beneath an abrasive exterior.  Perverted and lewd, at
times, the film remains not mean or bitter in the least.  You want these
guys and girls to find happiness, or as much as one can reasonably expect to
find at that age.  Every character is thoroughly likeable, which is kind of
rare in a film like this.  I think, again, back to CAN¹T HARDLY WAIT, from
earlier this year, in which just about every one of the characters was
immature and selfish, and compare it to AMERICAN PIE, full of real and
genuine people experiencing more truthful trials of growing up.  There isn¹t
a comparison to be made, really.</P>
<P>I like the way Kevin goes the distance to please Vicky, and their
exploration of sexual satisfaction; you don¹t see many teen comedies where
both the male and female party concentrates respective attention on the
other¹s personal gratification.
I also found Oz¹s slow progression into true romantic kind of endearing.</P>
<P>And, not to be overlooked, is the film¹s overt raunch.  I laughed my ass
off during Finche¹s (Eddie Kay Thomas) bout with uncontrollable diarrhea in
the girl¹s bathroom.  Jim copulating with the titular centerpiece comes in a
close second.  And, I especially love Alyson Hannigan¹s (doing her Willow
bit) band dork, who gets the two biggest guffaws during the concluding
post-prom party. The film originally garnered an NC-17 rating for its
full-bore graphic content, but all that does is minimize the heart of
AMERICAN PIE - a true-blue coming of age tale.  The script, by Adam Herz, is
audacious and perceptive, while at the same time smart and sophisticated and
surprisingly gentle.  The actors are amicable and seem to be having a good
time.</P>
<P>If the movie falters, it¹s by ending on such a feel-good note.  By then,
it makes no real difference, however, as AMERICAN PIE has proved itself a
raucous hit.  Go!</P>
