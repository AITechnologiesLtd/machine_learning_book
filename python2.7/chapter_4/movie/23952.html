<P>MYSTERY, ALASKA (M).  
(Hollywood Pictures/Buena Vista International)
Director: Jay Roach
Stars: Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria, Colm Meaney, Mary McCormack, Burt
Reynolds, Lolita Davidovich, Ron Eldard, Michael McKean, Maury
Chaykin, Judith Ivey, Ryan Nortcutt, Mike Myers
Running time: 120 minutes. </P>
<P>The good folk of Mystery, a small town in Alaska, live and
breathe little else but ice hockey.  The Saturday afternoon games on
the local pond are a social highlight, and the men guard their
positions in the team jealously.  But after an article on this hick
town team appears in the prestigious Sports Illustrated, they are
offered a one-off opportunity to play an exhibition match against the
New York Rangers.</P>
<P>The deal is the brainchild of celebrated sports journalist
Charles Danner (Hank Azaria), who grew up in Mystery before seeking
greener pastures.  Most of the town rally around the team, with the
exception of the crusty old judge (Burt Reynolds), who urges that
Mystery cling to both its dignity and its illusions.</P>
<P>But as the match draws closer, tensions within the town
simmer.  The match represents something of a personal mission for John
Biebe (Russell Crowe), the town's sheriff, who has just been dumped
off the team after thirteen years.  The town's mayor (Colm Meaney,
from Con Air, etc) discovers that his wife (Lolita Davidovich) is
having an affair with Shank (Ron Eldard), a member of the team, while
Biebe becomes jealous of the former relationship that existed between
his wife (Mary McCormack) and Danner.</P>
<P>Mystery's brief flirtation with fame also brings with it a
number of problems, not the least of which is a sudden influx of money
and interest from big corporations that threaten the harmony of this
small town.  Can the team pull off an unlikely fairy tale win against
the best and most professional team in the business, or will defeat
rip the heart out of this tight knit community?  Mystery, Alaska is a
classic tale about an underdog that eventually has its day, but this
leisurely paced comedy takes its own sweet time about getting to the
climactic hockey match.  Director Jay Roach (the two Austin Powers
comedies) and television writer David E Kelley paint a wonderful
portrait of this small town, bringing to life its charming, laid back
lifestyle and colourful gallery of eccentric inhabitants.  At times,
it seems a little like a nice off spin from the quirky Northern
Exposure series.</P>
<P>Roach has assembled a strong cast to bring the delightful
residents of Mystery to life, and he has also coaxed a brief
appearance from his Austin Powers star Mike Myers, who plays a
vitriolic tv sports commentator.</P>
<P>As a film dealing with the fast but often violent sport of ice
hockey, Mystery, Alaska is better than Disney's increasingly tiresome
Mighty Ducks series, but somehow not as much fun as the ribald,
raunchy comedy Slap Shot.  Instead, this is another of those endearing
comedies that explore the rich textures of life in small town America,
and its quirky charms should win over most audiences.</P>
