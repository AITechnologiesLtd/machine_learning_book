<P>For several years Disney enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the lucrative market 
for animated features.  A monopoly breeds monotony, and Disney's annual 
offerings soon slipped into a predictable "ugly duckling" formula (a misfit 
having an identity crisis has an adventure and discovers how special he/she 
is).  Gradually, though, competition emerged:  Fox entered the fray with 
"Anastasia" (1997), and Dreamworks pulled off the unlikely combination of 
Woody Allen and family animation in "Antz" (1998).  "Antz" was followed by 
"The Prince of Egypt", Dreamworks' first foray into traditional animation.  
"Prince" stuck close to the Disney formula but showed a lot of guts in its 
choice of a religious subject and in its refusal to sugarcoat the unpleasant 
elements of the story of Moses.  (After the way Disney sanitized the myth of 
Hercules, I doubt the House of Mouse would have shown God's destruction of 
the first-born children of Egypt.)  Now Dreamworks gives us "The Road to El 
Dorado," which is a pleasant antidote to Disneyfication.</P>
<P>Inspired by the "Road" movies of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, "El Dorado" is the 
story of two Spanish con men, Tulio (Kevin Kline) and Miguel (Kenneth 
Branagh) who win a map to the legendary city of gold, El Dorado, in the 
Yucatan.  When the losers discover that our heroes were playing with loaded 
dice, Tulio and Miguel beat a hasty exit and unintentionally stow away on the 
ship of explorer Hernando Cortes (Jim Cummings).  Cortes threatens them with 
a life of slavery, but the guys manage another escape with the aid of Altivo, 
a war horse who's smarter than both of them.  Wouldn't you know it, they wash 
up on the shores of the New World right at a spot on the map.  With the help 
of Chel (Rosie Perez), a young thief who's not too keen on life in the city 
of gold, Tulio and Miguel enter El Dorado and, much to their surprise, are 
treated as gods by the high priest Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante) because their 
arrival fulfills an ancient prophecy about how the Age of the Jaguar will 
begin.  There's a power struggle going on between the evil Tzekel-Kan and the 
benevolent Chief Tannabok (Edward James Olmos), and both badly want to earn 
the favor of the "gods."  The boys have to keep up the ruse as long as they 
can if they want to get away with all the golden tribute they collect.  All 
the time, of course, Cortes is on his way . . . </P>
<P>If you overlook the coincidences in the plot (our heroes just happen to land 
at a spot on the map, the natives just happen to be speaking the same 
language they do), "The Road to El Dorado" is lots of fun.  Kline and Branagh 
bring rare enthusiasm to their vocal roles, and the friendship between Tulio 
the realist and Miguel the dreamer is touching without the overbearing 
sentiment of Disney.  It's also refreshing to see such rascals as these in an 
animated film.  Altogether, it's a breezier "Butch and Sundance."</P>
<P>The music for "El Dorado" reunites the Oscar-winning musical team from "The 
Lion King": songwriters Elton John and Tim Rice, and composer Hans Zimmer, 
with marvelous results.  When I saw "Tarzan" recently, I grew to hate Phil 
Collins, but when I left "El Dorado" I wanted to run out and buy the 
soundtrack.</P>
<PRE>Bottom line:  Refreshing romp</PRE>
