<P>Susan Granger's review of "THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS" (Sony Pictures Classics)</P>
<P>        In French with English subtitles, 42 year-old Erick Zonca's
first feature film revolves around two young working women of
contrasting temperament who meet as minimum-wage seamstresses in a
garment factory in the city of Lille, in northern France, and sustain
each other for a brief time out of necessity. Elodie Bouchez plays
Isa, a scruffy, spike-haired, happy-go-lucky gamine who travels with
her rucksack from city to city, taking odd jobs where she can find
them. Natacha Regnier plays the edgy, moodier Marie, who views the
world as bleak and perpetually clouded. Both come from broken
homes. Neither possesses marketable skills nor has a support network
of any kind. The strength of the film lies in its poignant, soulful
compassion and its stirring evocation of their raw, desperate daily
struggles, particularly with the men who use them for their own
selfish needs. While the plot is deceptively simple, the script is a
bit incoherent, and the pacing is definitely European, the charismatic
actresses are superb. Deservedly, they shared the Golden Palm for Best
Actress at last year's Cannes Film Festival. Parental Warning: this is
an adult film with nudity and intense sexual content. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "La Vie Revee des Anges" or "The Dreamlife of
Angels" is a gray, grimly realistic, yet delicate 7.  For those who
admire the art of acting, it may be worth the price of admission just
to marvel at the fully-realized, bracing performances.</P>
