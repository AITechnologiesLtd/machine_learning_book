<P>Act I: _Rear_Window_.  Claire thinks that the strange happenings in her
house could be a result of some suspicious goings-on with her neighbors
(James Remar and Miranda Otto), so she starts poking around where she
shouldn't.  Every once in a while, things predictably jump into frame
accompanied by a stinger chord on Alan Silvestri's score.  The only real
shock of this section is what a long waste of time it is (if you've seen
any of the advertising, you'll know exactly why).</P>
<P>Act II: "I see dead people."  The supernatural bent comes to the fore,
with Claire trading in amateur sleuthing for novice witchcraft in hopes
of contacting whatever apparition is haunting her home.  Zemeckis is able
to create some moments of tension and creepiness, particularly in one
sequence where Claire gets a bit too close to the ghost (again, if you've
seen any of the commercials, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about).
 But as Norman voices his increasing disbelief, so will you.</P>
<P>Act III: Slice and dice.  In a turn I was not at all prepared to take,
the disco
very of the rather down-to-earth truth transforms Claire into a helpless
and idiotic B-movie scream queen, paying no attention to common sense and
the rules of a horror movie.  Again, Zemeckis pulls off some impressive
moments and images.  The extended _Diabolique_ reference works better
than it rightfully should (a blatant _Psycho_ lift, however, far less
so), and in one bravura camera move, Zemeckis swoops the camera from
regular P.O.V. to right under the floor, as if it had magically become
transparent.  Still, this is your basic slasher movie climax, with Claire
running for her life as evil things have their way of grabbing at her.</P>
<P>Everyone involved in this film is clearly above the material.  As I have
stated, Zemeckis is able to generate some suspense out of some very silly
situations.  Ford acquits himself well in a fairly small role.  But the
one who maintains the most dignity--and rather ironically at that,
considering the ridiculous wringer she's put through--is Pfeiffer.  Her
character undergoes just as many radical shifts as everything else in the
film, but Pfeiffer's conviction and innate likability go a long way.</P>
<P>But, ultimately, she and what good there is in _What_Lies_Beneath_ isn't
quite enough to successfully bring together what is essentially three
movies in one--and despite the ready-for-a-promo sound of that
description, that is _not_ a good thing.</P>
