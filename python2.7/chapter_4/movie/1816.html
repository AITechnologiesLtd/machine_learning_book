<PRE>                                  A FAR OFF PLACE
                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Nonnie Parker (Reese Witherspoon) is a 14-year-old girl living on
a farm in Africa.  Harry Winslow (Ethan Randall) is a 16-year-old boy
visiting with his father from America.  The two get thrown together
when elephant-tusk poachers murder Nonnie's parents and Harry's father
in an attempt to cover their tracks.  With the help of a teenage bush
man named Xhabbo (Sarel Bok), Nonnie and Harry attempt a crossing of
the Kalahari desert to escape the poachers.</P>
<P>     A FAR OFF PLACE is undoubtedly designed as a "family film" (hence
the PG rating), but parents should be warned.  Some of the scenes of
animal death may be quite disturbing to younger children.  Despite
Disney's disclaimer that no animals were injured during the filming of
the picture (the dead elephants are actually meticulously-constructed
life-size replicas), this is unlikely to make more of a difference to
the little ones in the audience than the knowledge that Bambi's mother
was only a cartoon deer.</P>
<P>     The basic plot is relatively simple, although there are moments
when certain elements of it becomes needlessly (albeit briefly)
convoluted.  The best part of A FAR OFF PLACE is, predictably, its
centerpiece--the trek across the Kalahari.  On this journey, the
three principle characters learn a lot about life and each other.  The
revelations border on trite, but they're at least presented in an
enjoyable fashion.</P>
<P>     Reese Witherspoon (last seen as the charming younger sister in THE
MAN IN THE MOON) shows a lot of ability and presence in her role as
Nonnie.  Her character is not especially well-written, but she gets a
lot out of it.  Sarel Bok is equally good.  Unfortunately, the same
cannot be said of Ethan Randall.  Randall's Harry is an often-obnoxious
whiner, and the actor seems to have trouble finding much that is noble
in Harry's character.  Randall is outclassed by Witherspoon and Bok in
almost every scene.  They are pleasures to watch; he is not.</P>
<P>     As a family feature, A FAR OFF PLACE does a pretty good job.  It
puts together all the right formulas in a frequently-engaging fashion.
The villains are predictably evil and the heroes unabashedly good, but
the main struggle is less of a morality play than man against nature.
The cinematography (by Juan Ruiz-Anchia) is impressive, especially
coupled with James Horner's fine score.  A FAR OFF PLACE, while clearly
not a milestone of film, is a predictable-but-satisfying movie
adventure.</P>
<P>     Double-billed with A FAR OFF PLACE is the newest Roger Rabbit
cartoon, "Trail Mix-Up."  The nine-minute short is rather average
cartoon fare until the clever ending.  I found it neither exceptionally
funny nor dull.  Children will love it; adults, if not as fond of it as
their offspring, should at least be able to tolerate it.  "Trail
Mix-Up" has the subtlety--and plot--of a Roadrunner and Wiley Coyote
cartoon, although it certainly isn't as clever as the latter.  While
not worth a trip to the theater on its own merits, "Trail Mix-Up" is a
painless diversion, and an okay appetizer for the much longer A FAR OFF
PLACE.</P>
