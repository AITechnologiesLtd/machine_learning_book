                       A film review by Alex Fung

<P>     After much hype, 20th Century Fox's winter entry into the Oscar
fracas, NELL, has opened here in Toronto this Xmas weekend.</P>
<P>     NELL is a crowd-pleaser dealing with the discovery of the title
character, a young woman brought up secluded from society in the woods,
and found to communicate in unintelligible gibberish and grandiose
sweeping and swaying gestures with her arms and body.</P>
<P>     Nell's discovery is brought to the attention of two doctors, who
invariably differ upon the course of action to be taken.  One feels
that the 'wild child' should be brought to the local hospital for
observation and studying, while the other becomes enraptured by her
innocence and pure soul, and seeks to protect her.  However, the
agendas of both parties become altered by an unforeseen human element.</P>
<P>     Jodie Foster plays the title character in a breathtaking and
outstanding performance.  She brilliantly emotes with her eyes and
facial expressions, and makes a deceptively difficult acting job
convincing and effective.  Foster disappears completely into the role,
and makes Nell a very gut character while still exuding charisma.  With
this performance, it seems very likely that Foster will receive her
third Best Actress Oscar in less than a decade--it is excellent work.</P>
<P>     Liam Neeson plays Jerry, the doctor who befriends Nell, and is
capable in the role, if not quite up to the calibre of Foster.  He does
project likeability and a good sense of timing, while being a hulking,
imposing figure on the screen, especially in contrast to Foster's
fragile little Nell.  Natasha Richardson portrays Paula, the opposing
doctor who decides that it is in Nell's best interest to take her for
studying, and is just fair in the role.  Her performance tends to be
rather flat, and while she is competent, Richardson's emotional
interludes seem too forced and inauthentic.</P>
<P>     NELL's plotline is fairly formulaic and over-manipulative.  There
are many moments in the film where you may have more than an inkling on
future events in the movie, and some lines of dialogue are delightfully
hokey.  NELL suffers from an abudance of gushing weepy
over-sentimentalism, particularly in the ridiculous climactic scene
which almost undermines the entire film, and one scene designed to
bring suspense almost had me laugh aloud.  However, Apted utilises
visuals very well, with some beautiful shots of the brush and
wilderness, and a very pretty sky shot at one point in the film.  The
film's score is lush, if somewhat omnipresent, and the keynote song of
the film is Patsy Cline's CRAZY.  Although filled with several stock
characters, Apted has succeeded in producing a heart-warming tear-jerker
that should success commercially, and showcases an outstanding acting
performance by Jodie Foster.  On my four-star rating scale, I give
NELL three stars.</P>
