Directed by Des McAnuff  
Written by Kenneth Lonergan
Starring Rene Russo, Jason Alexander, Piper Perabo, Robert De Niro, and the

Grade:  A</PRE>
<P>When I saw that the classic early 60's cartoon "Rocky and Bullwinkle" was 
headed to the big screen with an all-star cast and a mixture of live-action 
and animation, I predicted, "It's either gonna be really, really good or 
really, really bad."  Either the filmmakers would get the distinctive humor 
of the cartoon (a clever mixture of political satire, word play, and 
self-reflexive references) or they wouldn't.  The verdict is in, and they got 
it right.</P>
<P>The movie finds the cartoon players suffering from boredom.  The cancellation 
of their TV series left Rocket J. Squirrel (voice of June Foray, the original 
Rocky) and Bullwinkle J. Moose (voice of Keith Scott) with nothing to do.  
Likewise, their Pottsylvanian nemeses Boris (Jason Alexander), Natasha (Rene 
Russo), and Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro) were crushed (literally) by the 
collapse of the Iron Curtain.  So, the bad guys hatch a plot to conquer the 
live-action world.  With the help of movie producer Minnie Mogul (Janeane 
Garofalo), the evil trio emerges into our world and sets about enslaving 
America with the hypnotic effects of bad television.  FBI Agent Karen 
Sympathy (Piper Perabo) realizes that only her childhood heroes can save the 
day and brings Rocky and Bullwinkle into the real world.  (She also gets the 
deep-voiced Narrator to boot.)  Before they can fight the baddies, our heroes 
have to take a road trip across the country, a trip with several twists, 
turns, and celebrity cameos (including Randy Quaid, Carl Reiner, Jonathan 
Winters, John Goodman, Whoopi Goldberg, Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell, 
David Alan Grier, Don Novello, and Billy Crystal).</P>
<P>The key element in the cartoon series for me was the voice of William Conrad 
as the Narrator who commented with deadpan seriousness about the comical 
goings-on.  In the movie, Keith Scott does a great Conrad imitation and the 
interaction between the Narrator and the characters produces the majority of 
the laughs.  (A favorite moment: the Narrator comments on a bad pun by 
saying, "Even their wordplay had become weak and hackneyed," and Bullwinkle 
responds, "No, it was always like this.")</P>
<P>"The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle" indulges unashamedly in cartoon 
silliness while winking at the audience and sharing the laughter at how silly 
it is.  Everything a critic might blast in the movie, screenwriter Kenneth 
Lonergan attacks with a preemptive strike.  Why don't they fly rather than 
driving across the country.  Bullwinkle:  "But then it wouldn't be a road 
movie!"  Why are the villains live-action and the heroes animated?  Karen:  
"Hey I didn't write the movie!"  When Karen asserts that Rocky and Bullwinkle 
aren't in a cartoon anymore, a safe falls from the sky in the path of her car 
(followed by bundles of dynamite marked with big letters TNT).  </P>
<P>De Niro is probably the last actor I'd expect to see in this movie, but then 
who ever thought Nicholson would do "Batman?"  Being a serious Actor in 
Hollywood (a live-action cartoon in real life) must get tiresome, and there 
must be an urge to just be silly.  De Niro parodied his many serious 
performances as gangsters in last year's "Analyze This."  In "Rocky and 
Bullwinkle," he seems to be having a great time doing a Nazi right out of 
"Hogan's Heroes."  He even gets the chance to parody his "are you talkin' to 
me" scene in "Taxi Driver."</P>
<P>I'm not sure if "Rocky and Bullwinkle" plays as well to kids as it does to 
adults.  My wife and I took two with us, and they were underwhelmed.  (They 
much preferred "Gone in 60 Seconds" and "X-Men.")  Come to think of it, I 
never really liked the cartoon when I was a kid.  But, seeing it again when I 
was old enough to get the in-jokes, I loved it.  And I loved the movie.  It's 
sheer fun that's intelligent and silly at the same time.</P>
<P>Bottom Line:  If you like the cartoon, you'll love the movie.</P>
