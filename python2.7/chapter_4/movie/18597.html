<PRE>`Notting Hill' Review
by Fontaine L.</PRE>
<PRE>`Surreal, but nice.'</PRE>
<P>Coincidentally, this key phrase in the movie also sums up the entire
film.  The whole thing seems like a surreal dream.  A nice, surreal
dream (has the horse been beaten enough yet?).  Let's face it, the
plot is ludicrous.  Almost as ludicrous, as, say, a prostitute falling
in love with her client.  Not that there is anything wrong with that.
In a season dominated by FX-laden blockbusters like Episode I, `The
Mummy,' and `The Matrix,' `Notting Hill' will provide a
welcome escape into fairy tale romance that the inner girl (okay,
inner boy too) in us all craves.  It's a movie for everyone
who's ever been starstruck.</P>
<P>Despite its overall success, the film is uneven at places.  From the
very beginning, awkward editing and abuse of rock music (a sadly
common event in the MTV era) threaten to eclipse the atmosphere, but
eventually the film picks up its own lighthearted yet slightly
bittersweet pace.  The selected soundtrack hits and misses, and the
score is often too cutesy and recycled (not only so, but cued at
similar scenes), but at dramatic intervals the swelling music is quite
effective.  The movie moves along at a fairly brisk place, but it does
not escape lagging in a few places (discussed later).  The romance
between Anna and William seems forced at first because of the very
rapidity with which it develops, but this becomes more acceptable as
we grow accustomed to the film's wonderland atmosphere.</P>
<P>While it *is* a romantic comedy (let's make that Comedy with a
capital C), it does not reduce secondary characters into
two-dimensional cardboard; rather, it puts them into good use.  Each
secondary character, from leading man William Thacker's (what, is
this supposed to allude to Will M. Thackeray?) (played by Hugh Grant)
eccentric circle of family and friends to Alec Baldwin's suprising
cameo as Roberts' insensitive boyfriend, has an interesting
characteristic of his own.  A standout is Thacker's grossly (and I
mean that literally) inapproriate roommate spike, whose idiosyncracies
bring comic relief in a bold way (read my lips: butt cheeks) that not
many romantic comedies of this sort dare do.  Another form of humor I
rather appreciated were the industry in-jokes (Harrison Ford, Mel
Gibson, Demi Moore).  Sadly, they could've used this form of humor
in many other places and given the film a real punch.</P>
<P>`Notting Hill' brings back the Julia Roberts of `Pretty
Woman': the pretty girl with the big grin and infectious laugh.
Roberts has never been an exceptional actress, but she's more than
perfect (and just a bit self deprecating) in her role as mega movie
star Anna Scott.  Glamorous and graceful when she's in the movie
star mode, Roberts also effectively morphs into the girl-next-door
mode that was her claim to fame in `Pretty Woman' and subsequent
films.  What's interesting about the casting of Roberts is the
apparent parallels between Roberts and the character she plays and
Roberts' willingness to poke fun at this structure.  Roberts and
Scott both became famous at a young age, both are under intense public
scrutiny whenever they do something as mundane as hold hands with a
boyfriend.  The irony comes when we see the (un)intentional parallels.
Scott describes herself as a bad actress with a pretty face that
everyone will forget ten years from now, just as critics everywhere
love to proclaim Roberts as just another long-legged beauty who
can't act.  Well I'll give her this: she does a great job of
acting like a bad actress in the pseudo-film clips.</P>
<P>Speaking of self-deprecation, we come to the master himself, Hugh
Grant, most known for `Four Weddings and a Funeral,' Elizabeth
Hurley, and the Divine Brown scandal.  Here again we have evidence of
masterful casting.  While Grant may look perpetually lost in other
films, his shy boy stuttering comedy and unaffected charm is perfect
for his role as the everyday man William Thacker.  There's even a
sly reference to his scandal thrown in:</P>
<P>Part of what makes the film different is its poignancy amidst the
lovey-dovey stuff and comedy.  There's just a subtle hint of the
common man versus the unreachable: in this case, the common citizen
versus Hollywood superstar.  Thacker's group often gets together
and laments about their lives, envious of Anna and treating her like a
walking Madonna, try desperately to impress her; while Anna in reality
lead a glamorous but lonely life in the spotlight.  Because of the
similarities between Roberts and Anna, we feel as if we've been
given a secret peek into Roberts' private life.  It shows the
sometimes inhumane treatment most celebrities have to endure.  Its
ingenuity is it simultaneously makes fun of the celebrities'
complaints by placing their troubles alongside a woman bound to a
wheelchair for life, a failed entrepreneur, a fired stockbroker, a
romantic failure, and starving refugees.</P>
<P>The film would have been immensely better if it had been, say, half an
hour shorter; toward the end you keep thinking it's going to end,
but it just keeps dragging on (the Death Flaw for romantic movies, in
my opinion).  It is times like these when the quiet, snippy, decidedly
British banter between the characters seem lifeless and forced.  Other
times they are witty and engaging.  I suppose this is worth it in a
way since it all builds up to a wonderfully fluffy happy ending that
is bound to send sensitive viewers everywhere looking for their
hankies and Kleenexes.  `Notting' made me laugh *and* cry; it
entertained me but it didn't try too hard to be sweet and
cute. There's no better way to spend a Friday evening.</P>
