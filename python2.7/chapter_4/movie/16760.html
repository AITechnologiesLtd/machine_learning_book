<PRE>Review:                THE 24 HOUR WOMAN</PRE>
<P>Starring:        Rosie Perez, Marianne Jean Baptize, Patty Lupone</P>
<PRE>Directed by:        Nancy Savoca</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<P>A cable TV show, `The 24 Hour Woman', is the focal point of this `real
life' story.  The male host of the show learns, on the air, that he is to
become a father.  The show's Producer is the mother.  That role is played
by Rosie Perez.   Rosie's voice, usually grating to the ear, is a bit less
strident here.  She's a bit easier to endure.</P>
<P>The event becomes a `ratings' booster as they follow Rosie through her
pregnancy, incorporating various experts on children, pregnancy, etc. as
guests on the show.  That part is delightful, but, after their daughter is
born and the couple must cope with the problems confronting working
mothers today, it gets a little heavy.</P>
<P>The more interesting story belongs to Marianne Jean Baptize [of Secrets
and Lies] who plays Rosie's assistant.  Marianne, the mother of three
children, has gone back to work because her husband is out of work.  They
have a lovely relationship.   It's a shame that they didn't pursue that
story further.   He feels bad that he is no longer the breadwinner so he
helps her with the chores and with the children.  Despite jeers from his
male friends he becomes a sort of Mr. Mom.     The difference is obvious
between him and Rosie's husband who is quick to take the plaudits
associated with fatherhood, but none of the work that's entailed.  His
actions cause his and Rosie's relationship and marriage to disintegrate.  
Her work suffers more and more.</P>
<P>There's too much reality here.  It isn't a feel-good film by any means. 
It just endorses the backbreaking work of a real 24-hour woman.  It's not
easy.  I give it a C.</P>
