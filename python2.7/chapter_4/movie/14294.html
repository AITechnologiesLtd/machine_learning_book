<PRE>Simon Birch
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Faith is a wondrous state of being. Sure knowledge without the benefit of
facts runs the risk of being misplaced but it is a remarkable comfort.</P>
<P>Oddly enough, even in these cynical times, we are a nation of believers.
Everything's going to get better. A better life is just around the corner.
Although the programmers working on it say that it's impossible, we believe
that the Y2K bug will be fixed in time. Despite the evidence of history and
Henry Kissinger's observation about power being the ultimate aphrodisiac, we
are shocked to find that the President has human foibles.</P>
<P>Religious faith in our individual destiny is a different matter. Confidence
that there is a design for our life is a rarity. Simon Birch (Ian Michael
Smith) is convinced that God made him the way that he is in preparation for
his ultimate fate, "I don't need proof. I have faith."</P>
<P>As a twelve-year-old boy just over three feet tall, Simon's faith in his
predestination is either his way of dealing or precognition. Something of an
outcast in 1964 Gravestown, Maine and parented by two people who ignore him,
he sticks to his conviction. God has a plan for him: he's going to be a hero.</P>
<P>Simon's best friend Joe (Joseph Mazzello) also doesn't fit the New England
small town mode. The illegitimate son of Rebecca Wentworth (Ashley Judd) who
refuses to reveal his father's identity, Joe is Simon's confidante and the two
are inseparable. When Rebecca virtually adopts Simon, the boys are like brothers.</P>
<P>Most of the story revolves around their church. Simon gets in trouble for
arrogantly challenging the minister in matters of doctrine, not co-operating
with his nervous uptight Sunday school teacher and copping a feel from the
Virgin Mary as he lies in a manger during the Christmas pageant.</P>
<P>When he does get his chance to shine, tragedy occurs. Because his strike zone
is minuscule, Simon's baseball coach has never allowed him to swing and he is
always walked to first. When the coach wants to go home early, he tells him to
try for a hit, hoping for an easy out. Simon connects with the ball but with
disastrous results.</P>
<P>Midway through the film, Rebecca is no longer available to the boys and they
turn to her suitor Ben Goodrich (Oliver Platt) for guidance in their searches
for Simon's destiny and Joe's father. Ben has worked his way into the boys'
hearts while trying to win that of Joe's mom.</P>
<P>The movie almost works. Like personal favorite "Stand By Me", the tale of
buddies growing up in a small town features kids with winning personalities.
Unfortunately, like "Stand By Me", it's a lot like "Stand By Me". There's even
a fat kid vomiting at a public event.</P>
<P>There are a few strong moments here. Joe's understanding of how a dead
person's existence disappears in bits and pieces from the still-living is
touching. Simon's faith is inspiring. Their friendship is poignant.</P>
<P>The biggest flaw is that everything is proclaimed in advance. There's no
foreshadowing here, it's foreannouncing. The film is framed as a flashback by
bookends featuring Jim Carrey in a small part as the adult Joe. His first
appearance reveals two important plot developments that come later. His
voice-over throughout the movie constantly tells us what is about to happen.
It's all so obvious that a woman in the row behind me was "Oh no"-ing for a
full minute before the climax of a key scene.</P>
<P>Judd (sibling and daughter of the country singers) and Platt are the
liveliest people in the film. She is vivacious, has a likable way and is
pleasant to watch. Platt is one of those actors you've seen in minor roles in
dozens of movies and is easy to warm up to. Unfortunately Rebecca disappears
halfway through and the movie is poorer for it.</P>
<P>Although it's obvious that this is Smith's first role, he and Mazzello are
excellent as the two friends. Their amiable friendship makes it even more
grievous that the film is flawed. Director Mark Steven Johnson isn't willing
to let them win us over, he has to be manipulative about it.</P>
<P>The film is loosely based on John Irving's "A Prayer For Owen Meany". It's so
loose that not only is the title character's name changed, but the credits
read "suggested by" the novel.</P>
<P>It's a bit confusing as to whether this is a story about two friends, one of
whom just happens to be a dwarf or if it's about someone who is "differently
abled" who happens to have a good pal. Just when I was admiring the story for
treating Simon as a regular human being, a scene would pop up where the
audience's heartstrings were tugged at based primarily on his size and awkward
movements. This is a fine line and to give Johnson credit, he mostly succeeds
at getting us to accept Simon as a boy rather than a freak.</P>
<P>Childhood is amazing. Films like this could allow us to revisit those times
we've left behind. Growing up is so full of awe and limitless possibilities
that it doesn't need a heavy-handed director to make us to appreciate it.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman as written this very column for over 23 years and sometimes
feels like his inner child is taking over. So there. Email your boy- and
girlhood misadventures to <A HREF="mailto:Redman@indepen.com.">Redman@indepen.com.</A>)</P>
