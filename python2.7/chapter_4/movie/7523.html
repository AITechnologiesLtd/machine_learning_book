<P>     Who says soap operas can't be fun?  Shu Kei's fifth feature, STAGE
DOOR, has all the elements of a sudsy melodrama, but with one key
difference:  the film's lightly comic rhythm dares us to do anything but
smile our way through the story.  STAGE DOOR makes some telling points
about sexual and national identity without ever abandoning its disarming
tone in favor of the soapbox. </P>
<P>     The film centers around the actors comprising the Shining Sword
Troupe, a group of performers who put on nightly shows of Cantonese
Opera.  The lead actress, Sum (Josephine Siao Fong-fong), who has played
male roles in operas and martial arts productions for decades, is
preparing to emigrate to Australia with her husband and step-daughter. 
As Sum's final performance approaches, minor dramas swirl around her. 
Her husband fears that his daughter may be a lesbian.  One of her co-
stars is in love with her.  Certain members of the troupe are on the
verge of rebelling against the director's attempts to modernize their
work.  Sum's pretty, young protege shows signs of emotional and physical
abuse.  And a figure from the past arrives in time to make Sum question
her decision to leave Hong Kong.</P>
<P>     Currently, Hong Kong is undergoing an identity crisis as the reigns
of power are transferred from England to China.  By having Sum and her
family wrestle with the decision to move to Australia and start a new
life, Shu addresses the matter in an oblique, nonthreatening way.  He
also touches on issues of gender and female empowerment.  Despite
continually playing a man, Shu is very much a woman.  She is also the
most independent-minded individual in the film, yet is willing to
sacrifice her successful career for the good of her loved ones.</P>
<P>     STAGE DOOR is exuberant and entertaining -- a comedy that creates
believable characters and allows us to laugh with them, not at them. 
The lead performance, by legendary Hong Kong actress Josephine Siao
Fong-fong, is masterful.  She crafts Sum into the kind of character that
it's worth spending some time with, and the film crackles with energy
whenever she's on screen.  STAGE DOOR radiates warmth and joy, but
there's a measure of substance to go along with the confection, and
that's what makes this a rewarding motion picture experience.</P>
