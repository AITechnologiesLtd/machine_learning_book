<PRE>                  Forrest Gump [1994]</PRE>
<P>   A retro reveiw by: Richard Matich
Somewhere out there is someone almost like Forrest
Gump. They have a limited Iq. Thats about as close to
being like Tom Hank's charecter as they are probably
ever going to get. Most people of that mental age are
in a "home" out in chicken coop country. Or perhaps
they attend "classes" in the city where they watch
Barney tapes, stare at the walls, or paint bad
watercolor. When they are not busy with those "fun"
activities, they are being cleaned because they wet
themselves. Forrest Gump is a uniquely American screen
figure. Money seems to be at the very heart of the
story. The morel to this tale is that you will live in
happiness and all problems are soon to fade as long as
you are rich and tremendously famous. What a naive and
twisted  vision! My theory on why this film has been so
widely populer is well [don't laugh] simple. Americans
have an extreme guilt for the way they treat the
"mentaly challenged". This film makes the average Joe
sixpack feel better about himself and the American way
of life all at the same time. He does not even have to
think all that much about plot since the music that
fills the movie gives a music video feeling. Take out
the music and you have one dull film that would not
"inspire" half as much as has been claimed by some
reviewers. I do not totaly hate the movie. The end was
done to great effect. It does tug at the heart strings,
even though it takes the mind for granted. It is
intresting as a look back at the times from the 1950s
to the 1980s. But, I must stress, its no substatute for
a great documentary on the era. Hearts And Minds,
Woodstock, and others are out there for you to see.
Hank's performance as Gump was exicuted in great ways.
I liked the accent that he learned from the boy who
plays Forrest as a youth. The score, by Alan Silvestri,
was one of the few treats of the film. I bought the
soundtrack on cd for that reason alone. If you like the
film, more power to you. I just think it is overly
simplistic to believe that this retard ends up winning
the beutiful blond, meeting several Presidents and
celebraties, and becomes a war hero. Want to explain
how any University "gives" a degree to somebody of
Forrest's low Iq? Want to explain how he graduated from
High School [or even passed any classes]? I dod'nt
think you can even begin to defend the "in your face"
problems with the script. If you want to see a movie
about a person of the Gump vein, I must recommend the
Hal Ashby and Peter Sellers collaberation Being There
[1979]. "Thats all I have to say about that!"-Forrest
Gump.</P>
