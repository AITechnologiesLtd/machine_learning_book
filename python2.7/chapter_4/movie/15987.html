<P>Down the halls of a royal palace lies a story based in fact about the
very essence of ancient English royalty and how its impact led to a
revolution of religion and a major turn in world history.  It's also a
story that makes for one of the best dramatic films of the year, if not
the last decade. Queen Elizabeth I ruled for 45 years beginning in 1558
and her reign was one of the most successful in the history of the
British monarchy.</P>
<P>'Elizabeth' begins in 1554 and Queen Mary, a Catholic, and daughter of
Henry VIII is on the throne.  Dying and fearing that the country will be
turned over to a Protestant revolution once her heir assumes the crown,
she has her half-sister Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett in an Oscar-calibre
performance), put into the Tower of London.  Elizabeth, in a show of
strong will, survives the punishment and assumes the throne upon Mary's
death.  Instantly, there are many problems such as a bloodline heir that
her advisers feel must be produced.  England's army is very weak and the
treasury is virtually empty.
Elizabeth is aided by three loyal advisers who help her even when it
comes to her life being threatened in her attempt to change the
country's religion.  There is the head strong William Cecil (Richard
Attenborough), the no-nonsense and most loyal Francis Walsingham
(Geoffrey Rush), and her lover Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes).</P>
<P>The film's dramatic structure is impeccable.  Michael Hirst contributes
a wonderful script of authenticity. The performances are stellar and
this film is very well staged by director Shekhar Kapur who takes the
subject material in hand and never compromises an ounce of its impact
for the sake of any comic relief.  What's interesting is that another
film out at the same time, 'Shakespeare in Love', is a rousing,
humourous, romantic and feel good production that also features
performances by Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes.  The two of them
demonstrate their range in a most convincing manner and illustrate the
beauty of the English craft of acting which is perhaps the best in the
world.  I remember seeing an interview with an English actor who will
remain nameless and he said he felt that American actors were better in
the movies while English actors are better on stage.  While that is
somewhat of a generalization, I relish the opportunity to see actors of
their own ethnicity demonstrating parts of their own history.  'The Man
in the Iron Mask' from early in 1998 featured American and English
actors doing a take on French history and somehow it just wasn't
convincing and no accents were implemented to even make it sound
convincing.  This is the reason many critics were harsh on 1984's
'Amadeus'.  That film, as great as it was, had an Americanized version
of European culture which didn't cut it for many.  1985's 'Revolution'
was a disaster for Al Pacino as his New York accent spoiled the entire
production and likewise for Robert De Niro who just didn't have the
credibility for appearing in 1986's 'The Mission'.</P>
<P>'Elizabeth' has a look that shows its roots are in the English theatre.
The film has few special effects, plenty of dialogue for its period and
a rigid depiction of why some nations today live under the separation of
church and state.  This is a highly respectable looking film that has
its appeal geared toward the high brow movie fan.  Casual fans will like
it if they accept its heavy drama for what it is.....factual.</P>
