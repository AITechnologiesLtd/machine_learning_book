<P>Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) 92m.</P>
<P>In NEVER BEEN KISSED, Drew Barrymore played a writer posing as a student in 
high school to research a story.  In real life, 22-year old Cameron Crowe 
(later a writer-director himself) spent a year ‘undercover' in a San Diego 
high school doing the same thing.  The resulting book and film, FAST TIMES, 
could easily have been written without recourse to such methods (maybe 
Cameron was just feeling nostalgic) but it's still one of the best of an 
undernourished genre.  Besides Crowe, you also have director Amy Heckerling 
and the quality cast to thank, several of whom went on to establish durable 
screen careers (You don't usually find an ensemble like Sean Penn, Phoebe 
Cates, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Judge Rheinhold in most teen campus flicks).</P>
<P>Ostensibly a comedy, FAST TIMES grounds itself in reality and avoids the 
hi-jinks route that cripples many of its not-so-smart imitators.  If it is 
the intention of Crowe's script to hold a mirror up to contemporary high 
school students and show us their lives, then the absence of a contrived 
storyline is a good decision.  It's the lack of plot that makes this film 
repeatable viewing – if anything, FAST TIME improves a second time around 
because its fluctuating tone doesn't subvert your expectations.  The diverse 
characters wend their way through a collage of set pieces, retaining 
credibility  without coming across as stereotypes.  Even the film's most 
overt character, Sean Penn's spaced-out surfer dude Jeff Spicoli, seems 
naturally drawn (he pretty much established the archetype with this 
performance).  His dialogues with the dogmatic History teacher Mr Hand (Ray 
Walston) are the film's most enjoyable moments, leaving Jennifer Jason 
Leigh's character to carry the burden of FAST TIMES' downbeat side.  We 
watch Leigh go through one miserable sexual/romantic encounter after 
another, but at least her advice from the more experienced Cates is 
juxtaposed with Brian Backer's coaching from Robert Romanus to some humorous 
effect (after being told to use Led Zeppelin for make-out music, Backer 
plays the ominous, booming  Zep track ‘Kashmir' on his car stereo).  
Surprisingly, the frequent discussions about sex are more blunt and crude 
when coming from the girls.  That doesn't mean these scenes are used for 
cheap laughs: FAST TIMES works well because we have the sense that, like 
Crowe, we are listening in.</P>
<P>FAST TIMES seemed worthy of attention in the early 80s because it hit the 
screen at about the time it looked like there was going to be a new wave of 
female directors (i.e. Susan Seidelman, Penelope Spheeris, and Martha 
Coolidge).  This didn't really happen, but the film seems to have made an 
impression on many viewers (although the main memory of anyone I've ever 
spoken to seems to be of Cates shedding her bikini top).  Nowadays the 
film's popularity is assured by fans who saw the film in cinemas when they 
were in high school themselves and have since claimed it as their 80s 
photograph album.  Even a moment as simple as Judge Rheinhold bopping to the 
radio while washing his car seems to be a perfectly-captured snapshot.  The 
great soundtrack is a bonus – though curiously the music itself doesn't date 
the film as much as its references to the likes of Pat Benatar and Cheap 
Trick.</P>
