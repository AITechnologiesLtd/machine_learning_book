<PRE>ANGEL'S LADIES
--------------</PRE>
<P>Mack and Angel Moore, senior Christian cemetary/funeral parlor owners from
Eugene, Oregon, had a unique retirement idea.  They sold their death related
businesses in the dreary Northwest and moved to sunny Nevada, where they
purchased Fran's Star Ranch, a legal brothel which they renamed.  Director
Doug Lindeman's documents their new business in "Angel's Ladies."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>"Angel's Ladies" sounds like a great idea for a documentary, especially
given the background of the business' new owners (Mack is seventy, Angel
fifty-five).  Lindeman even captures the prurient interest of the public
when he invites a tourist couple to go inside with him (funnily enough,
its the wife who thinks it 'sounds like fun,' while the husband is concerned
about their timetable).  However, "Angel's Ladies" quickly outwears its
welcome.</P>
<P>We're introduced to Mack and Angel as decent people who believe they're 
providing a needed service.  Angel, in particular, is showcased grieving
the loss of her two sons (one to illness, another to an accident) and first
husband while likening their three 'girls' to her new family.  Yet Lindeman
is holding many things about this couple back, information that is shockingly
abhorrent when revealed midway into the film.  This holding back of information
for dramatic effect later on seems dishonest.</P>
<P>The three prostitutes who we meet at "Angel's Ladies" are very different.
Kevin is an outdoorsy horsewoman who seems pretty down to earth.  Linda
is friendly with Kevin and seems like the ex-suburban wife she was, but
is given far less screen time than Kevin or Melody.  Melody is the harshest
of the three, seemingly more suited to the trade.  Her recollections of 
things she's done to satisfy men's fetishistic fantasies become more and
more offputting (as does the relish with which she relays them) as the
documentary trudges on.</P>
<P>And trudge on this does, with increasingly repetitious shots of the girls
cavorting in the desert in work costumes while addressing the camera
crosscut with Angel becoming more and more defensive about the way she
does business.  The only person who seems to be making out at "Angel's
Ladies" is the housekeeper, who professes to mostly sitting around drinking
coffee.</P>
<P>Technically "Angel's Ladies" resembles a pretty good cable access production.
Some editting choices are juvenile (repeat jump cuts to make someone
'dance' for example) while the music is cheesy and distracting.</P>
