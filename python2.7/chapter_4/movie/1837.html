                       A film review by David Pimmel

based on Luc Besson's 1991 film NIKITA, LA FEMME NIKITA in American

rated R for violence and such</PRE>
<PRE>Synopsis
========</PRE>
<P>     Maggie (Bridget Fonda) is a very bad woman, killing a cop in a
drugstore robbery.  She is sentenced to death, but is rescued from this
fate by Bob (Gabriel Byrne).  He turns out to be a recruiter for a
covert government organization of assasins, who offers the choice of
join or die.  Always the pragmatist, Maggie joins up.  She is trained
to be a killer and then let out into the real world, to perform kills
on call.</P>
<PRE>Review
======</PRE>
<P>     I have not seen NIKITA, the film this is based on.  So this review
is of the film POINT OF NO RETURN as a stand alone film.  I don't
really want to go into a debate about whether or not this film should
have been made or not.  I also don't want to argue about which is
better.  As a stand alone film, I would recomment this film with some
reservation.  It has several very strong aspects, but also several that
don't seem to work very well.</P>
<P>     Bridget Fonda's performance is definitely the highlight of the
film.  I really didn't like her in SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, but here I
think she taps into her genetic actor's roots.  Particularly in the
beginning, during her bad stage, her performance is very strong.  In
fact I thought that was the strongest part of the film.  After she was
fully trained and left the nest, I felt the quality of the film went
down.</P>
<P>     The primary reason for the drop was the Dermot Mulroney
character.  I found him to be an annoying bore who detracted from what
was interesting to me, the relationship between Bob abd Maggie.  He
also seemed like a plot gimmick to show Maggie what life could be like
if she weren't a professional assasin.</P>
