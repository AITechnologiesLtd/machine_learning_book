<PRE>                         IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                     Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Nicolas Cage plays an honest cop
     who agrees to share a lottery ticket with a waitress,
     then finds himself sharing four million dollars.  This is
     a light summer love story that also makes some comment on
     the selfish and unselfish uses of good fortune.  Cage and
     Bridget Fonda make a likable couple.  Rating: high +1 (-4
     to +4)</PRE>
<P>     IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU is claimed to be based on fact both
internally and in the publicity.  In actual fact, just about none of it
is true, but the basic situation of a policeman sharing a lottery ticket
as a tip and then splitting the payoff when the ticket actually wins.
Jane Anderson's screenplay takes that situation as a springboard to tell
a fable about greed and unselfishness.  Surprisingly, the invented story
is not all that far from credibility.</P>
<P>     Charlie Lang (played by Nicolas Cage) is a good, honest cop who
lives the kind of life that a good honest cop can expect to live.  He
has a one-bedroom apartment, a lot of aggravation, and a dissatisfied
wife Muriel (Rosie Perez) who is getting ready to give up on Charlie and
look for something new.  One day Charlie buys a lottery ticket.  Then
getting a cup of coffee he finds he does not have money for a tip so
promises to split any lottery winnings with his waitress, Yvonne Biasi
(Bridget Fonda).  When the ticket wins to the tune of four million
dollars Charlie's wife Muriel wants Charlie to keep all the money for
themselves.  Charlie insists repeatedly that a promise is a promise and
splits the money with Yvonne.</P>
<P>     As Charlie discovers, winning the lottery completely changes who
you are and how people relate to you.  Charlie and Yvonne find kindred
spirits in each other, each wanting to spend much of the money
unselfishly. They also begin getting interested in each other.  Muriel,
on the other hand,  wants to enjoy every dollar spending on herself.
What is more, she wants all four million.  What results is neither
entirely expected or unrealistic.  On top of this is a rather pleasant
love story in which Cage and Fonda work very well together on the
screen.</P>
<P>     And Fonda and Cage are something of a surprise as a screen couple.
Cage has overcome the goopy kid roles he has played in the past and
carries the film reasonably well as a leading man.  He has, of course,
worked with director Andrew Bergman before in HONEYMOON IN VEGAS.  Fonda
is captivating with a winning smile and a more winning acting talent.
Slightly misjudged is Rosie Perez whose grating voice was somehow an
asset when she played the traumatized plane passenger in FEARLESS, but
here, playing a human cockroach, she seems just insufferable on the
screen.  Also disappointing is the limiting of Stanley Tucci to three
scenes as Yvonne's wandering husband.  Tucci is a rubber-faced actor who
proved he had a great deal of comic potential as Alec Baldwin's best
friend in PRELUDE TO A KISS.</P>
<P>     Anderson's screenplay has a lot of what was good in older Frank
Capra films.  Unfortunately Capra films were far from perfect and an
unrealistic turn of events toward the end of the film is lifted straight
from a Frank Capra film.  What is oddly missing is the attention to
well-observed character development that one would find in a Capra film.
It is odd because Anderson proved she was good at creating charactersin
THE POSITIVELY TRUE ADVENTURES OF THE ALLEGED TEXAS CHEERLEADER-
MURDERING MOM for HBO.  Here, instead of developing the minor characters
the screenwriter actually seemed to be working with a checklist to make
sure a wide variety of ethnic minorities were represented in the film.
Also the telling of the story with a narrator seems to be a false move
on the part of the author.</P>
<P>     IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU is not a great film, but it is an enjoyable
love story and a pleasant change from much gun-blazing summer
entertainment available in the theaters right now.  I would give it a
high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
