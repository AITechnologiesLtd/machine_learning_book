<PRE>                         THE NEWTON BOYS</PRE>
<P> Despite the interesting, true stories of the exploits of the four
Newton Brothers with their career of robbing banks, the film never
gets any real excitement.  It comes across as a poor imitation of
Bonnie and Clyde.</P>
<P> The Newton brothers, Willis, (Matthew McConaughey),  Jess (Ethan
Hawke), Dock (Vincent D'Onofrio), and Joe (Skeet Ulrich), whose
robberies spanned a period mostly from 1919 to 1924, during which
they robbed over 80 banks from Texas to Canada, never killed anyone.
That is unique, especially when it includes America's biggest train
robbery.</P>
<P>  The "Boys" considered themselves businessmen, not killers. Most
outlaws became notorious because of the number of killings in which
they took part . . . but not the Newton Boys.   Oddly, too, they all
lived to a ripe old age with one of them  appearing on the Johnny
Carson show to tell about some of the brothers' exploits.</P>
<P> This should have made for an exciting thriller but unfortunately it
appears to be little more than a recounting of the facts, omitting
that certain something needed to get it off the ground.</P>
<PRE>                Directed by Richard Linklater.</PRE>
