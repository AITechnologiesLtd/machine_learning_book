<PRE>GUN SHY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>How fast can a film with a killer cast die?</P>
<PRE>In its very first scene.</PRE>
<P>GUN SHY, starring Liam Neeson, Oliver Platt and Sandra Bullock, opens in
an airport restroom stall, as Neeson is forced into an embarrassingly
bad routine as an undercover DEA agent known only as Charlie.  As
Charlie sits on the floor with his pants off, whining away, he scares
the janitor and the audience, albeit for different reasons.  The former
because the janitor thinks Charlie must be a psycho on the loose and the
latter because they fear, correctly as it turns out, that they've
stumbled into a deadly awful movie.</P>
<P>GUN SHY, written and directed with an awkward obviousness by Eric
Blakeney, is a comedy that's never funny.  Even if some of the script
might have sounded humorous on paper, on the big screen it is presented
so lifelessly that you'll want to take a gun and put it out of its
misery.</P>
<P>A nail-biting, pill-popping, booze-guzzling, chain-smoking, insecure DEA
agent, Charlie has more problems than being involved in a sting
operation that's going awry.  He's also got some serious bowel trouble
-- now that's a great unplumbed comedic source.  This allows him to meet
sadistic nurse Judy Tipp (Bullock), who gives him a barium enema while
taunting him with "Think happy thoughts!"</P>
<P>Oliver Platt, notably embarrassed to be part of such a production --
watch him rolling his eyes as a clue to his fans -- plays Mafioso Fulvio
Nesstra.  When we first meet Fulvio, he is in the process of chopping
his neighbor's hand off, Saudi Arabian style, for the crime of stealing
Fulvio's newspaper.  Fulvio, who'd rather be a gardener, doesn't like
his lifestyle or his sloppy wife.  One night he uses a toothbrush to
clean every part of their little kitchen so that the linoleum and the
Formica shine as bright as one of the mob's shiny chrome guns.</P>
<P>The film's coldly antiseptic look will probably match your reaction to
this peculiar, would-be comedy.  Charlie falls asleep during the middle
of a big drug deal -- a problem you will likely have as well while
watching it.</P>
<P>"Fun is overrated," Fulvio tells us at one point.  "Where is it?"
Charlie asks at another.  "Where is it?  Where is that happy feeling?"
One thing's for sure, it's not in this anything-but-fun film.  Arguably
the worst picture that Sandra Bullock has ever been in, the movie was
made by her own production company, so she has only herself to blame.</P>
<P>GUN SHY runs 1:41.  It is rated R for violence, language and some brief
nudity and would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
