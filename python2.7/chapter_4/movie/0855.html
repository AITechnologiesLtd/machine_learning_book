<PRE>                                    IT
                                (SPOILERS)
                       A film review by Jim Mann
                        Copyright 1990 Jim Mann</PRE>
<P>     I'll start this review by saying that I am not a horror fan.  I
won't pick up horror books unless I have a recommendation from someone
saying that the book is a good book, not just a good horror book.  I am,
however, very fond of Stephen King.  King transcends the genre, writing
good novels, full of good, well-drawn characters.</P>
<P>     The novel IT is probably *the* epic horror novel.  I chose the word
epic deliberately.  The book has the feel of an epic.  The actions of
the characters feel as if they are a part of something much bigger,
something very important.  King uses a number of narrative techniques
and extensive foreshadowing to achieve this.  Before any major action
happens, you have glimpses of it, helping to make the action seem much
bigger when it does occur.  (For example, there is mention of "the
apocalyptic rock fight" several hundred pages before it actually
happens.  By the time it does, the reader knows (and feels) that it is a
pivotal point in what is to happen.)</P>
<P>     IT, like of all of King's major novels, contains well-drawn
characters.  By book's end, we know the main characters well, understand
why they do what they do, have lived with them through several major
choices, and so forth.</P>
<P>     Last night, ABC presented the first part of a two part "novel for
television" based on IT.  Actually, instead of calling a "novel for
television" they should have called it a "Cliff's notes for television"
since it is as close to the King novel as Cliff's notes are to a novel.
That is, it seemed to portray some of the surface of the book (not all,
by any means.  A number of important events are left out).  It does not
capture the feel of the book.  It instead is a pale outline of the book.</P>
<P>     First of all, all of the epic proportions of the novel are gone.
Key scenes--the rock fight, the first confrontation with it in the
sewers--are over quickly and seem rather trite.  They certainly happen
too easily.  There is no real build up to these scenes--they just
happen.</P>
<P>     Secondly, the characters mostly seem shallow, there motives
unclear.  This happens a bit with the lucky seven (the 7 kids who
challenge it) and happens even more so with the villains.  Henry Bowers,
the main nemesis of the kids, starts with murderous instincts, unlike in
the novel where his descent into evil happens in stages as he crosses
barrier after barrier in his criminal behavior.  His companions aren't
really portrayed at all.  (For those who have read the book: I was
particularly sorry that they left out Patrick Hofstadter (sp?), one of
the creepiest characters I've seen.)</P>
<P>     The novel portrays it as an ancient evil, something that had come
to earth millions of years in the past and fed on and corrupted what
would become the town of Derry, Maine.  This comes through almost not at
all in the movie.  The kids see old pictures of Pennywise the clown (the
chief guise of it), and one tells the story of a particularly nasty
accident at the town's ironworks.  This is not enough to really create
the feel of ancient menace that the book conveys.</P>
<P>     Moreover, the book has some moments of real menace.  The kids seem
in real danger a number of times, both when confronting Henry Bowers and
his gang and in confronting it in its many forms.  The teenage werewolf,
a frightening figure in the book, is trivial in the movie, for example.
(The movie downplays its shape-shifting, in any case.)</P>
<P>     In summary, I'm glad I read the book before seeing the movie, since
the movie would have soured me on the book.  Will I watch part 2.  Yeah,
probably.  Although at this point it is more a morbid desire to see how
else they are going to butcher things.</P>
<P>     On final note: how would it rate if I were taking it on its own
merits, without reference to the book?  That's hard to say, since I have
read the book.  Probably I'd consider it on par with your typical grade
C Hammer film (like a Christopher Lee Dracula film), an OK way to spend
two hours at the movie theater, but not anything great.</P>
<PRE>(Part 2)</PRE>
<P>     On Monday, I reviewed the first part of the TV movie based on
Stephen King's IT.  At that point, I blasted it, calling it a "Cliff's
Notes for Television" rather than a "Novel for Television."  The
characters were rather shallow and the film just didn't have the scope
and epic feel of the novel.</P>
<P>     Part 2 was aired last night.  It was a bit better.  The characters
were fleshed out a bit (though still shallow) and the ending didn't seem
quite as rushed.  However, many of the problems of the first part still
remained.</P>
<P>     First of all, it failed to give you the feel of the scope, power,
and age of it.  It was simply a somewhat nasty monster faced by our
characters, not the timeless evil it was in the novel.</P>
<P>     The ending, while not as rushed as that of part one, still seemed a
tad too easy.  Moreover, the characters face down it on strictly a
physical plain.  It is a much more intense moment in the book, fought
primarily on what can best be described here as another plain, first by
Bill, then by Richie (whose role is trivial in the film).</P>
<P>     Another problem is that the film tries to bring in devices from the
book, but, without the buildup these things had in the book.  Thus, they
are just confusing or trite.  For example, Bill's "He thrusts his hands
against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts" chant builds up
to something of mystic significance in the book, in part because of
King's narrative technique, in which Bill remembers this bit by bit.  In
the movie, many readers must have been shaking their heads, wondering
why he was saying such things to the monster at the end.</P>
<P>     Similarly, Silver is just Bill's old bike.  In the novel, it is
built up  in such a way that it seems much, much more, so that when Bill
used it to "beat the devil" it fits.</P>
<P>     Finally, the characters just don't seem to jell the way they do in
the book.  In the book, each character is an integral part of the whole.
Richie, for example, is NOT just the class clown.  His joking and his
voices are important in the resolution, and are part of the synergy of
the lucky seven.</P>
<P>     I realize that much of this probably comes from the time
constraints.  If they had 6 or 8 hours rather than 4, they could have
done a much better job.  I certainly would have expected more of William
Goldman, who is a fine screenwriter.  However, what we wound up with was
OK and  enjoyable, but a pale shadow of what it could have been.</P>
