<P>     In 1861, Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert died of typhoid
fever, sending the monarch into years of secluded mourning.  MRS. BROWN
deals with an interesting footnote to those years, the relationship
between Victoria (Judi Dench) and a Scotish groom named John Brown (Billy
Connolly) who comes to service for the queen in 1864.  While Victoria has
grown accustomed to her servants and family humoring her moods, she finds
no such deference in Brown.  Indeed, his manner with her borders on
outright insolence, but such treatment seems to be exactly what the queen
needs to rouse her from her gloom.  As Brown becomes Victoria's closest
confidante, salacious gossip begins to accumulate around their friendship,
including references to Her Royal Highness as "Mrs. Brown."</P>
<P>     If MRS. BROWN had been a love story, it would be a pretty poor excuse
for one.  Jeremy Brock's script offers far too few scenes between the two
principles, providing very little sense of the basis for those rumors; 
their relationship is as much a rumor to viewers of the film as to the
scandal-mongers it portrays.  Victoria's devotion to Brown remains 
unexplored, the feelings of both parties purely a matter of conjecture.</P>
<P>     Despite promotional suggestions to the contrary, however, MRS. BROWN
isn't a love story at all.  Instead, it's a drama of political intrigue,
both on a national scale and within the queen's own household.  As
liberals in Parliament begin challenging conservative Prime Minister
Benjamin Disraeli (Antony Sher) with proposed reforms in the status of
the monarchy, the facts of the queen's relationship with Brown become
irrelevant.  The monarchy is no longer inviolate in the eyes of the
public, the idea of abolishing it no longer heretical.  MRS. BROWN is
quite effective as a portrait of rumor as political lever, as well as the
changing perception of monarchy.  In this context, MRS. BROWN works as a
companion piece to another recent film about the British crown in turmoil,
THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE -- think of this one as THE SADNESS OF QUEEN
VICTORIA.</P>
<P>     The household politics are less clearly drawn, due largely to the
uneven characterization of Brown.  Billy Connolly (previously best known
to Americans for replacing Howard Hessemann in the television series "Head
of the Class, I'm certain to his great dismay) portrays Brown with a
matter-of-fact arrogance which energizes the film.  Brown refuses to
suffer fools of any social station, a quality which is both his greatest
asset and his greatest fault.  His motivations, however, fluctuate too
frequently -- at times he seems self-serving, at other times insanely
devoted to Victoria.  John Brown remains as mysterious as his dalliance
with the queen.</P>
<P>     It is Antony Sher's performance as Disraeli which really makes MRS.
BROWN worth watching, capturing the work of a consummate politician in an
era when consummate politicians were few and far between.  Disraeli gets
exactly what he wants while convincing everyone around him that they are
getting exactly what they want, all done with a smile, an off-the-cuff
remark and a self-effacing manner.  If MRS. BROWN were half as compelling
behind the doors of Balmoral Castle as it is behind the doors of
Parliament, it could have been as fine a romantic tragedy as it is a piece
of political theater.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Disraeli gears:  7.</PRE>
