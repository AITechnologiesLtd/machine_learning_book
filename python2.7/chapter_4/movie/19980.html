<PRE>The Sixth Sense (1999)
* * * *
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1999 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>"The Sixth Sense" absolutely blind-sided me.  I don't know what I was
expecting, in retrospect -- maybe something along the lines
of "Poltergeist", with the spirits of the dead tormenting children in a
special effects showdown.  What I got was an absolutely breath-stopping
story that probably ranks as one of the best movies of the whole year.</P>
<P>"The Sixth Sense" could be considered the antithesis of "The
Haunting".  That movie, with its gum-wrapper screenplay and gobs of
CGI, inspired more audiences to laugh and sneer than to be scared or
even thrilled.  "The Sixth Sense" has the most minimal of surfaces
concealing one of the most remarkable of stories, and needs no CGI to
make its magic work.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis, in an atypically restrained and gentle role, plays Malcom
Crowe, a gifted child psychologist.  As the movie opens, he is
confronted by one of his ex-patients, who rants that Crowe has failed
him, and to punctuate this point turns a gun on himself.  One year
later, we find Crowe, humbled and sinking down into himself, estranged
from his wife, and working on a new case: a young boy named Cole (Haley
Joel Osment), who is withdrawn and fearful.</P>
<P>One of the most shameless things that happened during the marketing of
this movie was how several key secrets were revealed during the
promotions.  I don't want to make the same mistakes again, so allow me
to tread very carefully here.  Cole's terror comes from a peculiar gift
he has, one which makes him very much a pariah and an outcast, but for
reasons which become clearer later on.  Crowe isn't sure what to make
of the gift -- is the boy lying to get attention? -- but slowly casts
more and more of his beliefs with the boy.</P>
<P>A description like this does not do this movie justice.  On the
surface, this is a fantastically well-made film: the timing and
presentation of every scene is flawless.  The director and
screenwriter, M. Night Shyamalan, was responsible for the enjoyable but
slight "Wide Awake" last year; nothing in that movie seemed to presage
what "The Sixth Sense" would offer.  Shyamalan has managed to infuse
every scene in this movie with a primal dread that most other films
can't even come close to.</P>
<P>Volumes have been written about Hale Joel Osment, as Cole.  He is half
the reason the film works as well as he does: his hollowed-out eyes,
creaky voice, and disturbing visual tics let him steal every scene he's
in.  What's better is that it's not simply a gimmick performance; it's
all inserted into the movie for a reason.</P>
<P>One of the most astounding things about this movie -- and again, I'm
trying hard not to ruin anything -- is the way it plays on assumed
knowledge.  There is a revelation at the end, which I will not discuss
here, that forces us to COMPLETELY re-evaluate everything we have seen
and take it in a new light.  Even better, it doesn't come off as a
gratuitous gimmick, but as something that needs to happen to allow the
characters their final moment of peace.</P>
<P>"The Sixth Sense" is the kind of rare movie that makes up for a whole
season's worth of mediocrities and disappointments.  See it, and for
God's sake, don't ruin it for your friends.</P>
