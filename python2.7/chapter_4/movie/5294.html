<PRE>                                SWING SHIFT
                       A film review by Randy Parker

<PRE>(Review written in 1987)</PRE>
<P>        I rented SWING SHIFT with mixed expectations since the movie opened
theatrically to mediocre reviews.  However, my admiration for the film's
star, Goldie Hawn, and its director, Jonathan Demme, were more than enough
to overcome my hesitation.</P>
<P>        SWING SHIFT is a fairly good, but somewhat unsubstantial, stateside
World War II drama.  On one level, the film concerns the invasion of women
into the work force during the war.  On another level, SWING SHIFT is a
simple and sweet love story.  Unfortunately, the film does not fully
realize either of these two themes, as it treats both rather superficially.</P>
<P>        Hawn stars as an unambitious housewife whose husband enlists in the
navy after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  To make ends meet and to fill her
time, Hawn goes to work for an airplane factory, where she is subject to
relentless courtship from her foreman, played by Kurt Russell.  Hawn gives
a strong and credible performance as a woman who is torn between her
devotion to her husband on the one hand and her loneliness and attraction
to her suitor on the other.  Hawn's character in SWING SHIFT is much deeper
than the cutesy, air-headed roles she usually plays.  As she matures from a
naive and subservient housewife to a confident and assertive factory
forewoman, Hawn's performance always rings true.</P>
<P>        As Hawn's suitor and eventual lover, Kurt Russell is charming and
sympathetic in perhaps the most convincing performance of his career.
Russell seems like a real person in SWING SHIFT, whereas in other
movies--such as BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA and OVERBOARD--he has seemed
one dimensional.  Moreover, the chemistry between Hawn and Russell in SWING
SHIFT is much more potent than it was in OVERBOARD, a film in which they
were hampered by an uneven script.  In fact, Hawn and Russell reportedly
fell in love while making SWING SHIFT and have been an off-screen couple
ever since, which suggests that their romance in this film may not be
entirely a performance.</P>
<P>        SWING SHIFT is not especially plot-intensive so it must succeed or
fail on the strength of its characters and acting.  I think it does so on
both accounts.  All the characters, including the supporting ones, seem
genuine.  The strong World War II flavor and atmosphere that Demme brings
to the screen is also noteworthy.  Unfortunately, SWING SHIFT is not
terribly profound.  The movie does not provide any fresh insights into the
predicament of working women during and after the war.  Nor does it shed
any light onto illicit and adulterous love, the other major theme of SWING
SHIFT.  Nevertheless, I was able to enjoy SWING SHIFT for what it is: a
film with memorable and sympathetic characters, but one lacking in
substance and lasting emotional impact.</P>
<P>        Most critics, despite their lukewarm response to SWING SHIFT,
highly praised Christine Lahti's performance--as Hawn's strong willed
friend--and singled her out as the main reason to see the film.  Her
acclaimed performance, however, did not particularly impress me.  She plays
the character well enough, but I don't think she is any more effective than
is Hawn, Russell, or the rest of the fine cast.  A final noteworthy bit of
trivia about SWING SHIFT is that then-unknown Holly Hunter has about a
minute of screen time as one of the women in Hawn's circle of co-workers.
Needless to say, any movie featuring both Goldie Hawn AND Holly Hunter
cannot be without its merits.</P>
