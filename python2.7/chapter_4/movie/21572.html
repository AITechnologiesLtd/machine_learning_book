<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>A Mercedes speeds through a densely populated Middle Eastern city.
There is an American in the backseat, blindfolded.  His name is Lowell
Bergman, a 60 Minutes producer that is being led to a secret location to
line up an interview with an Islamic fundamentalist Sheik.  Bergman
isn't the least bit intimidated by the process and even plays hardball
with the Sheik's handlers, who eventually give up their fight to see the
questions prior to the interview.  Think your job is tough?  Unless your
name is Regis, you've got no reason to complain about your day job.</P>
<P>After Bergman (Al Pacino, The Devil's Advocate) secures the interview,
the gold-domed white buildings give way to the white lab coats of
Louisville's Brown & Williamson, where Vice President of Research and
Development Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe, Mystery, Alaska) has just
been fired.  The good news is that he will receive a beefy severance
package and continued health benefits, which will both keep his family
in the lifestyles to which they've grown accustomed and ensure medical
care for his eldest daughter who suffers from acute asthma.  The bad
news is that Wigand was forced to sign a confidentiality agreement that
prevents him from disclosing any information regarding his employer, who
happens to be one of the country's largest tobacco manufacturers.  And
he knows secrets that could severely cripple any company that makes
cigarettes.</P>
<P>More of a scientist than your typical corporate VP, Wigand, who was
previously employed by Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Union Carbide, has
been struggling internally for years.  He's been taking the big payoff
for something that he knows is wrong.  Bergman is given Wigand's name as
someone who can translate scientific data for a fire safety piece that
60 Minutes is producing.  But after speaking with each other, Bergman
feels that Wigand has a story to tell and Wigand realizes that Bergman
represents a chance to clear his conscience and inform the public that
tobacco companies are chemically enhancing nicotine to be even more
addictive.</P>
<P>Despite this opportunity, the doughy Wigand is still reluctant.  Just
meeting Bergman has thrown his life into chaos.  His former employer is
asking for an addendum to confidentiality agreement, he thinks he's
being stalked, and the local FBI agents seem to be in someone's pocket.
The Insider tells the true story of Wigand's decision to become a
whistleblower and the dramatic effects that the decision has on his
life.  It also shows the internal struggle behind the scenes at 60
Minutes, as CBS fears that airing Wigand's interview could result in a
huge lawsuit.</P>
<P>Based on Marie Brenner's Vanity Fair article called `The Man Who Knew
Too Much,' the film was adapted by Eric Roth (The Horse Whisperer) and
director Mann.  Crowe's performance is simply amazing, as is Christopher
Plummer's (Twelve Monkeys), who plays 60 Minutes vet Mike Wallace.
Pacino is typically wonderful and Philip Baker Hall (The Truman Show)
effectively portrays 60 Minutes chief Don Hewitt.  Mann's direction is
successfully accented by several scenes that are shot out of frame with
no dialogue, relying on the film's moving score to power itself.</P>
<P>Despite being a brilliant film, Mann's self-indulgent style proves that
he has no respect for the asses of moviegoers.  This is the guy that
turned Heat, a run-of-the-mill crime drama into a three-hour epic.  The
Insider could have easily been 30 to 40 minutes shorter and, as a
result, a much better film.  His choppy editing was, at times,
frustrating.  A film of this magnitude really needed a lot of long,
sweeping shots – especially in a scene like Bergman's blindfolded
interview in the film's opening.  And the driving-range-stalking scene
was way too much.  Perhaps a nice, quick montage of Wigand noticing the
same guy following him at the bank, the grocery store, the post office
and the liquor store would have been better.  But `quick' isn't a word
in Mann's vocabulary.  I think he may be Kevin Costner's cousin.</P>
<P>2:37 – R for adult language and the threat of violence</P>
