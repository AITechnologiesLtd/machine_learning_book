<PRE>                                THE SAINT
                       A film review by Marty Mapes
                        Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>** (out of 4) There are very few reasons to see THE SAINT.</P>
<P>One is that it has Val Kilmer. Another is that it has Elisabeth Shue.
Another is that not much else opened this week that's likely to be any
better, judging from current reviews.</P>
<P>Beyond that, THE SAINT is boring and too long (at under 2 hours). There
is very little in THE SAINT that's original or fresh. Here's the plot:</P>
<P>Simon Templar (Val Kilmer) is a thief and a master of disguise. He is
hired by evil Russians to steal the secret formula from the beautiful
young scientist, Emma Russell (Elisabeth Shue). Simon seduces beautiful
Emma and has the secret formula in his hands when he realizes that he
has fallen in love. He tells the evil Russians to buzz off -- he has
found a better offer.</P>
<P>The evil Russians, being evil Russians, demand the secret formula for
double the price, or the girl gets it. Simon Templar steals the secret
formula from beautiful Emma and sells it to the evil Russians -- for her
own protection. But beautiful Emma, not realizing the danger she is
putting herself and her new love in, tracks the elusive Simon Templar
into the lion's den and they both end up in the iron fist of the evil
Russians, who are not satisfied with the lovely Emma's secret formula.</P>
<P>The pair of young lovers manage to escape. Luckily, the beautiful Emma
has not finished the final calculations on her secret formula (she's 2
hours away from finishing it), so Tretiak (Valery Nikolaev), leader of
the evil Russians, in the line that defines the entire movie, proclaims
"Kill him and bring her back . . . alive!" The young lovers,
inseparable, are chased through the rivers, slums, and sewers of Moscow,
hounded by the minions of the evil Tretiak.</P>
<PRE>And so on.</PRE>
<P>Initially, I would say this movie is bad because it is formulaic and
cliched. However, I have defended admittedly formulaic movies (Dante's
Peak). Sometimes, I said,  the formula works. In THE SAINT, the formula
fails.</P>
<P>FORMULA DEVICE 1: THE DAMSEL IN DISTRESS.THE SAINT is condescending to
the lead female character Emma. She is treated as bait by the Russians
(do as we say or the girl gets it); she fouls things up for both her and
Simon when she tracks him to Russia; she is portrayed as an airheaded
ditz at the press conference early in the film (in spite of her being an
alleged expert in her field); the hero calls her very "domestic;" and
finally, the hero valiantly sacrifices his safety for hers at the end.</P>
<P>In light of all this, her being a brilliant scientist is a mere token
gesture by the screenwriters (Jonathan Hensleigh and Wesley Strick).</P>
<P>This device worked well when it was turned on its head in RAIDERS OF THE
LOST ARK. Marion (Karen Allen) is the damsel in distress, but she is
strong. She is not a helpless screaming sex object.
FORMULA DEVICE 2: BAD GUYS DIVULGING THEIR PLAN.The evil Russians are
sitting around having a casual conversation while, unbeknownst to them,
Simon is listening in. In the course of their casual discussion, one of
them mentions how funny it is that nobody knows where they were secretly
hiding the stash. They all have a good laugh.</P>
<P>This device works well in most of the James Bond movies, partly because
the movies are presented tongue-in-cheek (not so THE SAINT), and partly
because the Bond movies popularized, if not invented, this device (THE
SAINT has no such tradition). Also, the Bond villains viewed Bond as an
equal of sorts. They viewed him as a worthy opponent who could
appreciate their diabolical strategies. In THE SAINT, the device is
uninspired and transparent.</P>
<P>FORMULA DEVICE 3: TV REPORT SUMMARIES.This formula device has gotten
lots of exposure from the weekly humor newspaper, The Onion. Basically,
the movie shows TV reports (or, in a corollary, reporters on the scene)
to summarize what's happening, in case you haven't been paying attention
to the plot. THE SAINT is particularly guilty of this condescending
device.</P>
<P>I can't think where this formula worked well, but there are many fine
adventure movies that were better for not having to explain themselves.
If you missed the all the subtleties of the plot the first time around,
a second viewing was a pleasure (TOPKAPI, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, the
entire Indiana Jones trilogy, the James Bond series . . .).</P>
<P>FORMULA DEVICE 4: LUCK.When the author writes him/herself into a corner,
a stroke of luck will save the hero. There is a scene in which Simon is
doomed. He is unarmed and an evil Russian is pointing a gun at his head.
Luckily, a cop just happens to come by and tells the villain to freeze,
allowing Simon to escape.</P>
<P>This device doesn't work well. What works better is having a scene of
APPARENT luck that is attributable to a virtue of the hero. In other
words, the cop shows up because the hero foresaw the trouble and called
the police in advance, or the cop shows up because the hero is always
helping the cop, and this is an act of reciprocity (though even this is
becoming a formula device).</P>
<P>It is lazy and unfair to criticize a movie solely for being formulaic.
Let me criticize THE SAINT then, not because it follows a formula, but
because it is an unimaginative and half-hearted attempt at storytelling.</P>
<P>It does not borrow from, build on, or wink at formula; instead it uses
formula as the cheapest, easiest solution to the movie's potentially
interesting conflict.</P>
