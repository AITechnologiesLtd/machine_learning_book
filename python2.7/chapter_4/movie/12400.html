<PRE>WILDE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     "In this life there are only two tragedies," Oscar Wilde reflects
at the end of the new film about his life, entitled simply WILDE.  "One
is not getting what one wants.  The other is getting it."</P>
<P>     WILDE is neither the tragedy nor the comedy that audiences may be
expecting, although it certainly includes doses of both.  It is first
and foremost a celebration of the joy of life.  Even if his life did
turn horribly tragic in the end, Wilde lived it with great gusto up
until then, and audiences are apt to find this sublime picture just as
wonderfully satisfying as Wilde found the majority of his life.</P>
<P>     Stephen Fry, last seen as the judge in THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS,
gives a mesmerizing and highly nuanced performance as Wilde.  So
utterly natural in his acting, Fry becomes Wilde.  In a performance
worthy of Oscar consideration, Fry plays a man who was a doting father,
a loving husband, and a lover to a string of young men -- called boys
back then although they seem to be in their early twenties.  Wilde
referred to this love of young men by older ones as "the love that dare
not speak its name."</P>
<P>     After opening incongruously in the Wild West of an 1882 Colorado
mining town where the famous writer Wilde is on tour, the movie moves
to London, where his plays are becoming great successes.  "You really
must be careful, you're in great danger of becoming rich," his friend
Ada (Zoe Wanamaker) warns him.  Wilde ignores all warnings and lives
his life as if nothing is forbidden and everything is possible.  His
public loves him, and he loves them and everything in life.</P>
<P>     With a loyal and affectionate wife named Constance, played sweetly
by Jennifer Ehle, he fathers children whom he adores.  He is delighted,
however, to learn of his desires for relationships, both emotionally
and sexually, with men, especially young men.  ("I feel like a city
that's been under siege for twenty years, and suddenly the gates are
thrown open.")</P>
<P>     One day Wilde locks eyes with the handsome, young Lord Alfred
Douglas, a.k.a., Bosie, and they are both instantly smitten.  Jude Law
from GATTACA delivers an emotionally complex performance as Bosie.  A
man who has too much money ("No gentleman ever has the slightest idea
of what his bank balance is."), Bosie comes from an abysmally
dysfunctional family.</P>
<P>     In a compete change of pace, Tom Wilkinson from THE FULL MONTY
plays the angry and vicious Marquess of Queensberry, who is Bosie's
violent father.  The marquess hates Wilde both because of his affair
with his son and because Wilde is so disarmingly charming.  ("Men
shouldn't be charming," he complains.  "It's disgusting!")</P>
<P>     The warm and intimate cinematography by Martin Fuhrer contrasts
nicely with the subtly flamboyant costumes by Nic Ede.  The result is
an inviting picture that becomes more captivating with each moment.</P>
<P>     Director Brian Gilbert stages each scene with delicate precision.
The sex scenes are handled tastefully, showing enough romantic passion
that it is crystal clear what is happening, but without ever letting
the movie lapse into some tawdry, soft porn film.  The resulting
careful balance will likely leave audiences neither offended nor
disappointed.  You can feel Wilde's ardor for both sexes and the heavy,
open mouth kissing - there are more explicit scenes - manages to convey
it most effectively.</P>
<P>     When Wilde ends up being thrown in prison for his sexual
encounters, his witty barbs finally stop, and for once he ceases to
enjoy life.  Fry's bravado performance works as well in the latter
episodes of great poignancy as they do during his earlier revelry.  The
utterly exquisite picture is enthralling from beginning to end.  Even
if it ends in tragedy, Wilde's earlier felicity is likely to be the
emotion that viewers take away.</P>
<P>     WILDE runs 1:57.  It is rated R for profanity, nudity and strong
sexuality and would fine for older and mature teenagers.</P>
