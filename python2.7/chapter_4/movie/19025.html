<P>"Big Daddy" is crude and obvious, sloppy and mawkish, contrived and 
clumsily manipulative, and yet it still works. I went back for a second 
screening of the film, curious to see if it would charm me as much as the 
first time, and the damn thing did. The Adam Sandler comedy contains a 
laundry list of elements I find annoying -- standard-issue pratfalls and 
body function gags, sentimentality utterly lacking in finesse and even 
that most tiresome of clichés, the climactic courtroom scene -- but 
despite all the rubbish, there is something special going on here, 
something genuinely good-hearted and even brave, that made me surrender 
to "Big Daddy."</P>
<P>The premise is sheer hokum. When a little kid is left on his doorstep, 32 
year-old slacker Sonny Koufax (Sandler) "adopts" the boy, hoping to prove 
to his girlfriend that he's a responsible adult. She dumps him anyway and 
Sonny grudgingly tries to take care of the child until Social Services 
can find him a home. You can guess the rest.</P>
<P>On the surface, the film appears merely a calculated attempt to satisfy 
long-time Sandler fans with his usual combination of infantile humor and 
bursts of rage, while using the warm and fuzzy plot to nurture the 
mainstream viewers he gained with "The Wedding Singer." But there's more 
going on here than meets the eye. Quietly and oh-so carefully, Adam 
Sandler is challenging his own core audience, the army of young males 
crucial to the success of "Billy Madison," "Happy Gilmore" and "The 
Waterboy."</P>
<P>Outside of right-wing Christian extremists, young males are possibly the 
most homophobic people in America, yet "Big Daddy" includes an accepting 
portrayal of an affectionate gay male couple. The men, two of Sonny's old 
college buddies, behave like any romantic pair, sharing loving glances, 
cuddling and exchanging goodbye kisses. When another of Sonny's pals 
expresses discomfort with the guys' evolution from fellow frat-brothers 
to lovers, Sonny casually dismisses him, saying "They're still our 
brothers... our very, very gay brothers." Any jokes about the couple come 
not from their sexual orientation, but from the flustered reactions of 
others to their sexual orientation. Pretty nervy for an Adam Sandler 
movie.</P>
<P>But wait, there's more. Young males are also known for macho posturing, 
with their displays of bravado masking a fear of strong women, their own 
emotions, and the prospect of adulthood, aging and responsibility in 
general. "Big Daddy" features sisters Layla (Joey Lauren Adams) and 
Corinne (Leslie Mann), two extremely assured young woman. Layla, a 
hotshot lawyer, is clearly infatuated by Sonny, but sets her own 
boundaries and refuses to let him overwhelm her. Corinne is a doctor who 
was once a "Hooters" girl, a fact Sonny never lets her forget, but she 
never buckles despite his nonstop stream of insults (something else to 
consider -- here, Sandler mocks Corinne because she once worked at 
"Hooters" -- in his previous films, his characters would have worshipped 
her for that). </P>
<P>Sonny comes to grips with his emotions over the course of the story, 
gradually tempering his anger outbursts, freely expressing his love for 
his young ward and even making a heartfelt reconciliation speech to his 
father (that leads to one of the funniest scenes in the movie). He makes 
repeated references to his thickening waistline (although he actually 
looks quite fit) and other aspects of aging and, after many hapless 
attempts at indulgent childrearing, comes to accept and embrace the 
responsibilities of adulthood. </P>
<P>It's as if Sandler is gently telling his core audience, "Hey guys, it's 
okay to grow up. Confident women, parenthood, emotions and the whole 
aging thing aren't so scary, and by the way, picking on gay people is 
just plain stupid." As I said before, these are pretty daring notions for 
a fan base that considers fart jokes high art.</P>
<P>Of course, this is all subtext in a film that is sloppily constructed, to 
say the least, but it speaks volumes about the production's disarming 
sense of good will. Adding to the appeal is the sweet relationship 
between Sonny and five-year-old Julian (played by twins Cole and Dylan 
Sprouse) and the winning performance by "Chasing Amy's" radiant Joey 
Lauren Adams, who makes the most of her limited screen time. </P>
<P>As for the rest of the cast, Rob Schneider is fun as an immigrant 
delivery man grappling with the English language and Steve Buscemi has a 
few good lines as a homeless man. Jon Stewart, playing Sonny's roommate, 
is sadly underused and Josh Mostel merely annoys as an ex-hippie turned 
priggish social worker.   </P>
<P>Despite its flaws, its many, many flaws, "Big Daddy" is a satisfying 
offering. In this cynical age, it's refreshing to see a movie that 
celebrates love, maturity and acceptance of others. Hopefully, as Adam 
Sandler continues to grow, both as an actor and a filmmaker, it will 
become easier to praise his work without having to add so many qualifying 
statements.</P>
