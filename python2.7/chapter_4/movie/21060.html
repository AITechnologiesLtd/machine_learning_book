<P>They say that bad things come in threes.  For Christian Slater, I guess
the three bad things would be:</P>
<P>1. He's the star of Hard Rain
2. He's the Associate Producer of Hard Rain
3. He's in frigging jail for biting someone</P>
<P>You know you're in trouble when Betty White (denture wearer…Rogaine
needer) is the big scene-stealer.</P>
<P>Hard Rain is the kind of movie where the bad guys chase the good guy
(Slater) around, but can't kill him because he has some special secret.
It is also the kind of movie where the good guy finds some hot babe
(Driver) while he's running about.  It is also about… errrr…oh, who am I
kidding…it's not about anything else.</P>
<P>Slater plays Tom, an armored truck guard partnered with his Uncle
Charlie (human Chia Pet Ed Asner).  They've got $3 million and get
stranded during a flash flood in a small town.  Then the aforementioned
bad guys appear, led by Jim (Freeman).  Trouble soon ensues.</P>
<P>The best intentional part of the movie is when Tom is chased by bad guy
#3 (Wayne Duvall)…on jet skis…through a middle school.</P>
<P>The best unintentional part of the movie is the inconsistent levels of
the floodwaters.  At one point, the water nearly reached the traffic
lights but the one story sheriff station remained bone dry.  And I
didn't even hear a sump pump.  In fact, most places where the acting was
trying to happen had very little water until the actors showed up.
Then, it seemed to rise at an astonishing rate of about a foot per
second.</P>
<P>There is also a great unintentionally funny scene at the end when Karen
(Driver) signifies that killing is, in fact, bad by tossing her gun into
the flood water.  These scenes were finely crafted by Graham Yost, the
creative genius behind the recent Oscar hopeful Firestorm. Mikael
Salomon, whose only previous directing credit is the yawner Far and
Away, shows that he may be the second greatest helmer of water films
(after God…I mean James Cameron).  Next up…The Olsen Twins Splash-a-Bath
Christmas?</P>
