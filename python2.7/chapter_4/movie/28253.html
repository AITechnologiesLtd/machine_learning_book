<PRE>MIRACLES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>The sweetly silly MIRACLES (QIJI), stars Jackie Chan (RUSH HOUR and 
SHANGHAI NOON), who also serves as the film's writer and director.  
Originally released in 1989, a new, uncut and undubbed version is being 
shown in selected theaters now in the United States.  With a handsome 
new print that shows off the picture's sumptuous and colorful sets and 
costumes, the movie manages to rise above its slapstick roots.  </P>
<P>For those who go to Chan films only to see his signature brand of comic 
kung fu -- he prides himself in doing his stunts himself, no matter how 
painful -- the movie may be disappointing.  Not until a long ending 
sequence set in a rope factory does Chan really allow himself to cut 
loose and show off.  When he does, it is such a treat that even those 
who find the body of the story flagging will think it is worth the wait.  </P>
<P>The plot has the always adorable Chan, as Cheng Wah Kuo, accidentally 
becoming the leader of a group of Hong Kong gangsters, who are never 
happier that when their Tommy guns are blazing.  (The period isn't 
specified but appears to be the Roaring Twenties or perhaps just a bit 
later.)  Kuo wants his gang to find more respectable ways to earn a 
living, so he starts a nightclub called the Ritz in which Luming Yang 
(Anita Mui) becomes the lead singer.</P>
<P>The least interesting subplot has Kuo's rival, Tiger (Chun Hiang Ko), 
trying to extort half of the nightclub's earnings.  The main story 
concerns Kuo's big-hearted attempt to turn a flower woman, Madam Kao 
(Yah-Leh Gui), into a wealthy socialite for a short time in order to 
impress the family of the Shanghai man that her daughter, Belle (Gloria 
Yip), wants to marry.  Lies beget more lies as Kuo tries his best to 
help Madam Kao impress her future son-in-law's parents so that they will 
give their permission for him to marry her daughter.</P>
<P>"I'm tired of this farce," Kuo's right-hand man says at one point.  And 
to be honest, so was I.  A little trimming sometime could be a good 
thing.  Still, even if it does drag a bit, Chan's charm saves the day.  
It's a good-spirited production that's certain to leave a smile on your 
face.</P>
<P>MIRACLES runs 2:07.  The film is in Cantonese with English subtitles.  
It is rated PG-13 for action violence and some language and would be 
acceptable for kids old enough to read subtitles.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 12, seeing his first subtitled film, gave it ** 1/2.  
He said that he liked it and that it was cool and funny.  He found the 
subtitles -- it's a talky film -- a bit hard to keep up with at times.</P>
