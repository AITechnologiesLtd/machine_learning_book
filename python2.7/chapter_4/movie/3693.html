<PRE>            THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     If you're expecting a big joke about the unfortunate title of this
film, you'll be disappointed.  Everyone else has done it already.  I saw
the film late, and I'm just not falling into that trap.</P>
<P>     With that out of the way, THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME
DOWN A MOUNTAIN refers to the title character, Hugh Grant, who is given
this wacky Welsh nickname as the result of some wacky events surrounding
the wacky title hill/mountain.</P>
<P>     The story is a classic comic farce.  Set in 1917, in the village at
the foot of the mountain, Ffynnon Garw, a pair of surveyors from England
come to the village to measure its height.  Grant is Anson, as one of the
surveyors who recently returned from World War I only to find himself
shell-shocked so badly that public service is his only apparent employment
option.</P>
<P>     When Anson measures Ffynnon Garw, he finds it to be just a bit too
short to be called a mountain.  Now the Welsh take their mountains very
seriously, and this is quite a blow to the village, so with the aid of
villagers Morgan (Colm Meaney), Betty (Tara Fitzgerald), and a host of
others, they conspire to keep the surveyors in town long enough to pile
enough dirt atop Ffynnon Garw to push it into mountaindom.  Through high
school-style pranks and the affectionate ministrations of Betty, Anson
stays in town long enough to be charmed by its beauty, simplicity, and
fraternity.</P>
<P>     Some of this works.  Some of it doesn't.  THE ENGLISHMAN can be
hilarious at times, and really quite silly at others.  In fact,
Fitzgerald, who is normally the embodiment of the phrase "ingenue," looks
downright goofy with her 1917 Shirley Temple curls and period dress.  I
couldn't take her seriously at all.  Worse still, the critical romance
developing between her and Anson is completely unbelievable, and was a
real stumbling block for me.</P>
<P>     Otherwise, the film is good, if not entirely memorable, featuring
some excellent bit players and an original story (but not too
original--the story of Ffynnon Garw is true).  The film drags a bit here
and there, but the ending had me walking out with a smile.</P>
