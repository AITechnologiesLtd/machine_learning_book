<P>"Make me one promise," Mac Brashear (Carl Lumbly), sweating over a plow, says 
to his son Carl, "don't end up like me."  A few years later, Carl (Cuba 
Gooding Jr.) finds his escape from the life of a Kentucky sharecropper in the 
newly-integrated Navy.  However, the recruiter's claims of a bright future 
for Carl turn out to be lies.  African-American seamen are restricted to 
slinging hash or serving as valets.  Carl sees that he will have to claim a 
career for himself against stiff opposition from a racist system.</P>
<P>"Men of Honor" is based on the life of the U. S. Navy's first 
African-American Master Diver.  The film balances Carl's life against that of 
Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro), who is removed from diving duty 
after an injury to his lungs.  Like Carl, Sunday is a man "born to dive," and 
the loss of his career turns Sunday into a mean-spirited alcoholic.  When 
Carl finally gains entry into the Navy's diving school, Sunday is his 
instructor.  Like most of the cadets and the school's insane commanding 
officer (Hal Holbrook), Sunday hates blacks and resents Carl's presence.  
Carl, however, meets opposition with a fearless, iron-willed determination to 
succeed.</P>
<P>Although the real Carl Brashear stamps with approval the movie's 
authenticity, "Men of Honor" tastes suspiciously like Hollywood corn, Rocky 
Balboa in a diving helmet.  However, it's a high grade of corn, and a 
satisfying meal.  A movie like this has to sell its story to the audience, 
and in "Men" several strong performances successfully move the merchandise.</P>
<P>Not surprisingly, the most impressive acting comes from De Niro.  He seems 
well-rested from his vacation in comedy land ("Analyze This," "Rocky & 
Bullwinkle," "Meet the Parents") where he was needed only as an icon, not as 
an actor.   Sunday is a challenging role because the angry bigot goes from 
being Carl's nemesis to being his most ardent supporter.  De Niro pulls off 
the contradictions in this character with such subtlety that it seems 
effortless.  Sunday is repulsive, likeable, and completely convincing all at 
once.  This is De Niro's best work in years.</P>
<P>In contrast, Gooding has an easier job.  Carl is characterized by 
single-minded determination, and therefore doesn't present the complexities 
of Billy Sunday.  However, Gooding is completely convincing and brings 
limitless energy to the character.  </P>
<P>Charlize Theron wins the Not Just a Pretty Face Award for her impressive work 
as Sunday's neglected wife Gwen.  Also, take note of the always good, always 
underused Michael Rapaport as a stammering seaman who befriends Carl.</P>
<P>Although the script for "Men of Honor" is shamelessly manipulative, it is 
also effective.  When a room full of people give Carl a standing ovation in 
the film's climax, I was tempted to stand up in the theater and clap, too.  </P>
<PRE>Bottom line:  Honorable</PRE>
