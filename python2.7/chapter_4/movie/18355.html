<PRE>ENTRAPMENT
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Hollywood's fascination with the older man-younger woman romance
continues in the heist drama, Entrapment.  Sean Connery and Catherine
Zeta-Jones are the cross-generational lovers.  Their lukewarm romance is
the pitiful highlight of this thoroughly ridiculous film.</P>
<P>Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery), aka "Mac", is a master thief, rich
beyond all wildest dreams. He steals now for the challenge, seeing each
potential theft as a magnificent puzzle to be solved.  He is the best of
the best, and has never been caught.</P>
<P>Gin Baker(Catherine Zeta-Jones) is an insurance investigator who has
been tracing Mac's illustrious career.  She gets approval from her boss,
Cruz (Will Patton), to go undercover and trap Mac in a heist.  However,
Gin has other plans in mind...</P>
<P>Entrapment is a movie with only one redeeming value:  the personal
charisma of its stars.  The dialogue is horrible, the plotting
ridiculous, and even the stunts aren't all that alluring.  But when Sean
Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones are on the screen, you start to forget
how bad a movie this really is.</P>
<P>But it is bad...very bad.  The movie starts with some promise, in a
whiz-bang robbery scene right off the bat.  But when the dialogue kicks
in, the technical wizardry seems to go out the window, and the entire
film deflates into nothingness.</P>
<P>The plot hinges around the upcoming millennium shift.  It's a timely
topic, but the screenwriters apparently didn't research Y2K issues much
deeper than the name.  Then again, nothing in this movie seems to be
very well researched.  From security measures to tricks of the thieving
trade, the details of the film all seem to be invented off the cuff.</P>
<P>The leads, appealing as they are, are hopelessly trapped in their
shallow characters.  Sean Connery is actually given very little to do.
His role here is more of a coach than a player.   Catherine Zeta-Jones
would be much more enchanting if her character  wasn't constantly
whining and pouting.</P>
<P>Don't be lured into Entrapment on the basis of the stars alone. The
power of their sheer presence can only lift the movie so far. Entrapment
isn't worth the heist.</P>
