<PRE>Review: Return To Paradise</PRE>
<PRE>Starring: Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Joseph Ruben
Approx 110 min</PRE>
<P>Regardless of the critical response to this film, few would debate that
Return To Paradise is one of the most thought provoking films of the
decade. The story asks two main characters, Sherrif and Tony, if they
would spend three years of their life in a third world prison in order
to save a friend from execution. But from the get go it is clear, at
least to me, that the filmmakers are asking the audience to think about
it as much as they are asking the characters to.</P>
<P>Sherrif, Lewis and Tony meet each other for the first time in Malaysia.
They are three young men who are experiencing life, sharing hash, beer
and babes. Sherrif and Tony decide to return to New York to continue
their lives. Lewis stays put, planning to head off to Borneo to work
with mistreated apes. The three friends realize that they've bought too
much hash and toss most of the remainder in the trash outside their hut.
The story picks up two years later in New York City as a lawyer tries to
track down Sherrif and Tony. She informs them that Lewis will be
executed because of the sheer volume the officials found in his
posession. That amount makes anyone in Malaysia a suspected drug dealer,
the penalty for which is death. But if one man goes back for his friend,
he spends six years in prison but accepts half of the responsiblity,
thus half of the drugs. If both go back, three years each.</P>
<P>Most of the film tugs at our morality. We know what we SHOULD do, but
what we would actually do if faced with the situation is a different
story. The filmmakers make no bones about it, the characters ping pong
back and forth with their emotions, as do we. Conscience, the "right"
thing to do is not always the easiest, nor necessarily the best. The
conflict is firmly implanted early on. After that, we just wait to see
what they would do.</P>
<P>Return To Paradise is a well-crafted picture. It is dark, it is
depressing, and there are probably a lot of things in the film that you
might question, as I did. There were some things I just didn't buy. But
they are also intentional choices made by the men and women behind the
camera, and that was something I was able to accept. The film looks as
though every scene was shot using the one available light on the set.
Every shot is drenched in thick shadows. Reasonably, there arent' a lot
of moments of bright color in Return to Paradise, once the men part ways
early on. The decisions they have to make are grave. The situation their
friend faces is grave.</P>
<P>Like last year's pitiful Red Corner, this film tackles the issues of
Asian judicial systems, though the real story here is the morality of
man, a true "what if". But, the choice by the filmmakers is to make the
"enemy" (the Malaysian government) faceless for the most part is a good
one. A faceless enemy in the movies is always much easier to sell, and
it is easier for the audience to accept. But we do see the faces at the
end, and it is a matter of personal opinion whether or not what we see
really works.</P>
<P>Perhaps the most surprising amidst the fine performances in Paradise was
that of Joaquin Phoenix. He has a rather small part, playing the
imprisoned Lewis. But he makes the most of his limited screen time and
may, in certain circles, be considered for an Academy Award nomination.
(Are we talking about this already?) Vince Vaughn, as Sherrif, sells his
character well. We are pulled every which way with his character. Anne
Heche gives a good sentimental performance as Lewis' lawyer, who shows
grit and perserverance as a fighter who is always patient with the two
men who face the ultimate decision.</P>
<P>Return to Paradise is certainly good enough to recommend, but try not to
watch it with sharp objects in the vicinity. Be prepared to question
yourself, your morals, and for god's sake, don't go after a really fun
afternoon.</P>
