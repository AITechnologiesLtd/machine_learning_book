<PRE>Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (1982) 89m.</PRE>
<P>It helps if you're both a Steve Martin fan and an old Hollywood movie buff 
to get the most out of this fastidiously engineered conceit.  Martin, who 
co-wrote with George Gipe and director Carl Reiner, plays a private eye who 
is approached by slinky Rachel Ward (who brings her own performance to what 
might have otherwise just been a mock bombshell role) to find her missing 
father.  The first-person narration, black and white photography, art deco 
titles, and opening score by Miklos Rosza establish within moments that this 
is going to be spoof on Raymond Chandler crime thrillers, but if you were to 
enter this film without knowing its central joke, then you'd no doubt be 
surprised to suddenly see Alan Ladd walking down a corridor while Martin 
rummages through an office.  What DEAD MEN DON'T WEAR PLAID sets out to do - 
and it makes my head spin to think how many viewing hours must have been 
spent in order to knit this story together - is to seamlessly insert clips 
from classic Hollywood pictures into Martin's investigation.  Among his many 
encounters he has telephone conversations with Bogart, shares a train 
compartment with Cary Grant, and makes a date with Ingrid Bergman.  All in 
all, 18 different films and 18 different Hollywood players (some of them 
interweaving in and out of the same films) are edited effectively into the 
story.  It's the visual equivalent of David Thomson's one-of-a-kind novel 
'Suspects' - fortunately all the stars and their films are listed in the 
final credits so you don't have to drive yourself crazy trying to figure 
them out afterwards.  The mixture of material makes it hard to determine 
what era DEAD MEN DON'T WEAR PLAID is supposed to be set in - Martin's 
reference to the Kinsey Report would place it somewhere in the 50s, which 
seems a bit out of place considering that all but one of the contributing 
films were made in the 40s.</P>
<P>I admire the effort that's been made with the matching.  Not only the 
photography, but the sets, props and costumes (by no less than Edith Head!) 
are also tailored in service of the original footage.  For the most part, 
the clips have also been well selected.  The more familiar moments (e.g. 
Burt Lancaster getting plugged in THE KILLERS, James Cagney performing a 
casual execution in WHITE HEAT) don't work nearly as well - in fact it's 
annoying to see the Cagney scene, which was effectively chilling in the 
original, lifted out of context.  Contrast this to Veronica Lake's bit, 
which is funny even though she says only two words.  DEAD MEN DON'T WEAR 
PLAID was never meant to be a laugh riot - it's more an affectionate 
pastiche, if anything else - but some of Martin's hardboiled dialogue is 
hysterical.  There's a few in-jokes (the 'You know how to whistle' line from 
TO HAVE OR HAVE NOT; a reference to Charles Laughton's star turn as THE 
HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME) but the fun comes mainly from watching Martin 
delivering offbeat lines to Hollywood stars who are playing their scenes 
straight.  It should be noted that unlike many other comedies that integrate 
found footage, the tone of Reiner's film is never campy or patronizing to 
its older source material.  Finally, and most importantly, DEAD MEN DON'T 
WEAR PLAID has one rare distinction: it includes the only scene with an 
actor in drag that I've actually ever found funny.  Poor Fred MacMurray just 
didn't know what hit him.</P>
