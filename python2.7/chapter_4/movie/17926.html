<P>20th Century Fox is now on a roll.  This year, they have released many of what
I call "could have been great" films that have had everything in place to make
an outstanding, one of a kind film.  Pushing Tin is just another to add to the
list.  The main element in this film that could have made it an ‘A' film is the
wonderful cast.  John Cusack, Academy Award nominee Cate Blanchett, Academy
Award winner Billy Bob Thornton, and Golden Globe winner Angelina Jolie are the
key cast in this comedy/drama about the occupation of air traffic controlling.</P>
<P>John Cusack stars as Nick Falzone, an air traffic controller.  He is the best
at his station, and everyone admires his wonderful work of saving lives all day
long.  Nick is at a great stage in his life.  He is very happy in his marriage
with Connie, played by Cate Blanchett, whom he has two kids with.  One day, all
of that changes.  A new air traffic controller is introduced to his station. 
His name is Russell Bell (Billy Bob Thornton), and is top notch as well.  Nick
starts competing with him right off the bat.  For the rest of the film, the two
compete to see who is the better man.  Sometimes this is funny, but sometimes
it can be very dramatic as well.</P>
<P>At first it is all fun between the two, but then things start to turn bad. 
Nick finds himself losing everything he had.  He even cheats on Connie with
Russell's alcoholic wife, Mary, played by Angelina Jolie.  From the point where
this takes place, the film goes into more of a serious, suspense-drama mode
than the more fun, light, comedic mood.</P>
<P>The entire concept of Pushing Tin was based on a magazine article about an air
traffic controller.  It was neat to see such an interesting insight to this
overlooked job.  It's not often I walk away from a film knowing a lot more
about a subject than I did to begin with.  The 3-D scenes that the film goes
into makes the concept of air traffic controlling seem pretty simple.  I
thought this was very cleverly done.</P>
<P>The writing in Pushing Tin is absolutely horrible.  There are so many scenes
that don't serve any purpose at all to the overall film.  At least twenty
minutes of footage could have been cut from the film.  If scenes like the
pointless seven or eight-minute bomb scene were cut, the film would have been
much better.  Due to the amount of pointless scenes, the film dragged a lot. 
The running time is only two hours and hour minutes, but yet it seems like it
was three hours long.</P>
<P>Other than the writing, everything is okay in the film.  The sound really added
a lot to the film.  The sounds of airplanes send off vibrations that you can
feel.  The filmmakers turned down the sound at the right times and pumped it up
right when it was perfect to do so.</P>
<P>The strongest part in the film without a doubt was the outstanding
performances.  John Cusack, who has not been seen in a leading role since
1997's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, gives the best performance I
have ever sen him give.  He got to go a lot of places with this character, and
he took full advantage of that.  Billy Bob Thornton is good in Pushing Tin, but
it is a step down from the wonderful flick, A Simple Plan. (A-) Thornton's
character just kind of sat there silent for the majority of the film, and it
would have been nice to hear some more from him.  Also taking a step down is
Cate Blanchett, who perfected her role in the masterpiece Elizabeth. (A+) She
is very good here as well, but she doesn't get a lot of room to develop her
character too much.  Angelina Jolie, who was last seen in another one of 1998's
best, Playing by Heart (A-), pretty much plays the same role as she did in
Playing by Heart.  We didn't get to se her as much though, which was a
disappointment.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- The writer of this could have been great film were "pushing"
it a little bit.</P>
