<P>How many of us would become strippers? For those of us who wouldn't, is it a
moral reason, or purely a lack of confidence? That's probably not a fair
question, and for a lot of us, it could very well be for neither of those
reasons. As you watch THE FULL MONTY, however, you may begin asking yourself
these kinds of questions. Would you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in
some much needed dough?</P>
<P>In case you haven't guessed, THE FULL MONTY is about stripping, but STRIPTEASE
it ain't. It's actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a
great deal of tact and sophistication. It is the story of six out-of-work,
out-of-shape blue collar Brits whose recent job losses have left the boys
penniless, but not without need. What to do? It hits our main character Gaz
(Robert Carlyle) as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local
male strip club on a regular basis. It seems that simple: take it off and
bring in the cash.</P>
<P>Eventually, Gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their
own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance. These include the
overweight, confidence-lacking Dave (Mark Addy), the uptight, overly-officious
Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), the once suicidal Lomper (Steve Huison), and two
additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition: Horse
(Paul Barber), an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy, and Guy
(Hugo Speer), a young well-endowed looker who compares himself to Cary Grant.</P>
<P>When the sextet is complete, we're given a hefty dose of physical comedy. We
watch the bumbling middle-aged men choreograph pseudo-sexy dance numbers, all
the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place. As if
there anti-appeal wasn't enough, they decide to boost interest in the group by
promising "the full monty" on opening night, which for us Americans, means
baring it all . . . and I mean *all*.</P>
<P>The movie actually ends on opening night; a hilarious applause worthy ending I
might add. It's sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you
leave the theater. With the subject matter, you might not expect THE FULLY
MONTY to be such a feel-good, almost inspiring film, but it surprisingly turns
out that way. The amount of light, touching drama also comes as a nice
surprise, never feeling off-balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments
of the film. There's a lot more to this movie than you might think in other
words, and the ensemble cast couldn't be better. Each character is completely
individual, interesting, funny, and most importantly, real.</P>
<P>THE FULL MONTY is never offensive, a very impressive attribute since its
subject matter alone could've easily fallen prey to tastelessness. It's one of
those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment, perfect
for a great night on the town, or as a Saturday night movie rental. Either way
you see it, it shouldn't let you down in the slightest. And, pun heavily
intended, when it's all said and done, you'll be smiling from cheek to cheek.</P>
