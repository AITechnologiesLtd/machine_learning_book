<PRE>rated PG-13
116 minutes 
starring Bob Hoskins, Elaine Cassidy, Arsinee Khanjian, and Claire Benedict
directed by Atom Egoyan</PRE>
<PRE>A Video Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Joseph Ambrose Hilditch (Bob Hoskins) is a sort of modern Norman Bates. His 
strange obsession with his French cook mother (Arsinee Khanjian) leads him to 
pursue, videotape, and possibly kill young women, usually prostitutes, 
searching for answers in their difficult lives. Hilditch is very lonely, not 
to mention a little crazy, but he tries to be appealing. He's admired by his 
co-workers, the only friends he has. He apparently hopes the girls will stay 
forever, providing him with everlasting companionship. Felicia (Elaine 
Cassidy) is his latest young acquaintance. She is looking for her Irish 
boyfriend who says he works at a lawnmower factory in town. It turns out he 
may have joined the British Army and used the lawnmowers as a cover-up. 
Felicia relies on Hilditch for guidance and lodging since she has little 
money. She almost gives up all hope of finding Johnny, but Joseph tries to 
keep her optimistic and with him for his own personal purposes. The tension 
builds as Felicia may or may not meet the same fate as the previous young 
women.</P>
<P>With one exception, the acting was very good. Elaine Cassidy was never 
satisfactory, but was manageable. Bob Hoskins turns in a masterful 
performance as Hilditch, and Arsinee Khanjian succeeds in flashback scenes. 
Claire Benedict plays a small, but important role as a traveling bible 
saleswoman. She perfectly captures the essence of all Jehovah's Witnesses 
that have ever come to your door. Her marvelous performance got overlooked 
for an Oscar nomination. A wonderful score and soundtrack accompany the 
actors. During the frequent long periods of silence, Egoyan lets the music 
speak for his characters. Malcolm Vaughn's songs add to the unbearable 
intensity. </P>
<P>Despite being tense, Felicia's Journey has its downsides. The movie is 
remarkably slow and was very tiring. Dramatic build-up is probably the reason 
for lots of unneeded scenes. Too much of the movie is confusing. Felicia and 
Hilditch's actions always seem scripted. Since we never learn a huge amount 
about these people, it's tough to comprehend their motivations. The film 
obviously takes place in England, but the time period is uncertain. 
Hilditch’s old car model and home appliances suggest the 1950s or ‘60s. 
Felicia’s wardrobe, including platform sandals, suggests otherwise. It’s 
even harder to understand the perplexing ending. This mystery is actually 
entertaining for a while. The intriguing Hilditch is quite fascinating until 
his secrets get revealed. Around the same time the movie comes to a grinding 
halt. Another viewing would perhaps help to clear any of my confusion. 
However, another viewing would also put me to sleep.</P>
<P>Sadly, the boring moments outnumber the exciting ones. The material isn't 
enough to build an entire movie on, even though the cast and director try 
hard. This was a personal disappointment for me because Egoyan's 1997 film 
The Sweet Hereafter is one of my all-time favorite movies. Felicia's Journey 
is tiresome, hollow, and better suited as an eighty to ninety minute film. 
Superior performances don't save the poor script.</P>
