<P>When the Cuban missile crisis happened in 1962, I was too little to
understand the particulars. I remember sitting on the carpet in front of
our black and white TV while John F. Kennedy spoke in solemn tones about
the conflict. Afterwards, my father looked grim and my mother unusually
anxious as they discussed what the young president had said. In bed that
night, I tried unsuccessfully to sort it out. All I really knew was that
a face-off was occurring over Russian rockets and, if somebody didn't
back down, there was a good chance that the world would come to an end.</P>
<P>"Thirteen Days" provides a flawed but gripping look at the United
States' side of the crisis and shows that the men in the White House
were just as scared as I was. We see events primarily through the eyes
of presidential aide Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), a former classmate
of Bobby Kennedy and a close friend and confidant of both the Kennedy
boys. There are positives and negatives to the "World According to
Kenny" storytelling motif. On the plus side, it keeps the focus firmly
on the inner circle, establishing and maintaining a unique intensity. By
following O'Donnell, the filmmakers can offer personal observations and
glimpses of family life without concocting situations or exchanges for
John or Bobby Kennedy.</P>
<P>But the approach puts blinders on the audience similar to those that
were on the President and his advisors. Amazingly, there was no direct
line between the White House and the Kremlin in those days. For the most
part, messages were filtered through public speeches and private
meetings with ambassadors. On October 16, 1962, when U.S. aerial spy
photographs revealed the presence of Soviet medium-range ballistic
missiles in Cuba, the White House saw what Russia was doing, but had no
idea why.</P>
<P>And neither does the audience. The truth is that, after dealing with
President Kennedy at a summit meeting, Soviet Premier Khrushchev
dismissed our commander in chief as a lightweight and decided that the
USSR could get away with such a daring stunt. That's an important piece
of information that we never hear during "Thirteen Days." In fact, over
the course of the film's 144 minutes, we never get any specifics on the
Russian leader's mindset.</P>
<P>It's not as if the facts were unavailable. A number of documentaries
depict the goings-on in both Washington and Moscow, as did ABC in the
early '70s, when the network presented "The Missiles of October," a
well-received dramatization starring William Devane as John Kennedy,
Martin Sheen as Bobby and Howard da Silva as Khrushchev.</P>
<P>While the filmmakers behind "Thirteen Days" would likely argue that
their approach makes dramatic sense, I believe the film would not have
suffered by presenting a complete view. At the very least, why not
include substantial informative crawls at the beginning and the end of
the story?</P>
<P>The production has a few other problems. After watching the long,
remarkably effective music-free stretch in "Cast Away," I was acutely
aware of the scoring here. When the screen is filled with characters
heatedly discussing the fact that nuclear war could break out at any
time, do we really need orchestral cues to feel tense? I think not. And
why, oh why, does the film periodically shift from color to black and
white?</P>
<P>Speaking of needless affectations, what about Kevin Costner's Boston
accent? The oft-maligned actor told an interviewer, "Luckily, Ken's
accent wasn't as strong as the Kennedys' accent, but I still studied
hard because I know I did a really lousy accent in 'Robin Hood: Prince
of Thieves' and I didn't want to take that kind of heat again."
Apparently, old habits die hard, because, despite his protestations,
Kevin offers a repeat performance. He starts the film with a broad,
metallic accent, then fades into his standard Malibu Ken mode. Sadly,
the brassy Boston accent pops up throughout the film, mostly during
family scenes that were probably shot together early in the production.</P>
<P>Accents aside, Costner does fine work, adjusting his style so that he
doesn't overshadow the principals. As for the lead characters, Steven
Kulp is strong as Bobby Kennedy, projecting a sense of great energy
being contained by propriety, while Bruce Greenwood, neatly underplaying
his role, creates a John F. Kennedy that feels like a real person
instead of a cultural icon. Impressive. The supporting cast is sturdy,
with Michael Fairman a standout as U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson.</P>
<P>Despite its problems, "Thirteen Days" offers a chilling look at how
close to destruction our world came in 1962. Hopefully, those who
appreciate the film will seek out additional information so they can
learn what happened on the instigator's side of this life and death
chess match as well.</P>
