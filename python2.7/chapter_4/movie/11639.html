A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Sammo Hung</PRE>
<P>Written by: Edward Tang King-sang and Fibe Ma</P>
<P>Starring: Jackie Chan, Miki Lee, Gabrielle Fitzpatrick, Karen McLymont,
Richard Norton</P>
<P>Ingredients: TV chef, damsels in distress, runaway horse and buggy,
swiveling steel crane, shopping mall chase, bulldozing equipment, gun
swapping scene, hallway with many blue doors scene</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
MR. NICE GUY is a Jackie Chan action chase comedy. In the film Jackie
plays a famous TV chef in Melbourne who entertains guests with his ginsu
cooking moves. One day, a drug kingpin (Richard Norton, sporting a
Steven Seagal hairstyle) and his thugs go after a lady reporter named
Diana (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick) who has just filmed their dope deal with a
rival gang and has it on videotape. While grocery shopping, Jackie
stumbles into Diane, saves her and gets on the bad side of the thugs,
who are now desperate to find the videotape that contains evidence of
their drug dealing. The thugs chase Diana and Jackie. When Jackie's
assistant Lakeisha (Karen McLymont) visits Jackie's apartment, the goons
go after Lakeisha as well. Finally, when Jackie picks up his girlfriend
Miki (Miki Lee) at the airport, the crooks decide to kidnap Miki. The
lightweight plot is little more than one chase scene after another, but
of course it's all just an excuse for many wonderful and impeccably
timed comedic action sequences by Chan. Can chef Jackie save himself and
the three women from the drug kingpin?</P>
<P>MR. NICE GUY contains around nine fight scenes showcasing Chan's amazing
blend of kung fu and humor. </P>
<P>Opinion: 
Jackie Chan easily ranks with the geniuses of the silent movie era; he
is the undisputed successor and next evolution of the style of physical
comedy pioneered by such screen greats as Buster Keaton and Charlie
Chaplin. In these kinds of comedies the typical hero is the humble guy
with the expressive face, who through comic timing and athleticism,
manages to survive peril after hilarious peril and incidentally save the
damsel(s) in distress. Chan is a master of comic facial expressions and
timing, and he adds martial arts choreography to the comedic mixture. He
aptly demonstrates his unique style and talents in MR. NICE GUY. </P>
<P>To be truthful, plot-oriented people might be disappointed with MR. NICE
GUY's whimsical plot ("All this hoopla over a lost videotape?").
Similarly, politically correct people might gripe that the women in the
film are mere bikini fillers. And fans of Chan's previous movies might
say the ending takes it easy (using a bulldozer instead of kung fu). But
these are small things; on the whole MR. NICE GUY is pretty
entertaining.</P>
<P>What I would like to see in a future Jackie Chan movie is a layer of
situational comedy that uses the drama of the situation to give more
meaning to Chan's physical comedy. Another thing that would be good in a
future Jackie Chan movie is to have stronger parts for the female leads.</P>
