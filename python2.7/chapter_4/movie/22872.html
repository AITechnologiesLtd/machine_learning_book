<P>Director Michael Mann's first film since the brilliant Heat is
a wonderfully gripping and intelligent true life drama about the
scientist who blew the whistle on the tobacco companies for tv's 60
Minutes.</P>
<P>When he is unfairly dismissed from tobacco company Brown and
Williamson, scientist Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) eventually told a
60 Minutes news team that the tobacco companies had been lying for
years about the dangers of smoking.  But then the tobacco industry
began a massive smear campaign, dragging Wigand's life through the mud
in an effort to discredit him and his testimony.  When even CBS
eventually bowed to enormous legal pressure and failed to air the
damaging interview, veteran investigative reporter and 60 Minutes
producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) fought back to protect Wigand and
the right of the public to know the truth.  It was a protracted and
heated dispute that shook up the landmark television news show and
tested old loyalties.</P>
<P>This is probably the best drama featuring journalists as
heroic characters and newsmakers, pursuing a momentous story, since
All The President's Men.  The Insider is suspenseful, riveting stuff,
but it also has a strong emotional punch.  With this searing look at
corporate America out of control, Mann is dealing with some weighty
and important themes - big business ethics, greed, corruption, heavy
moral dilemmas, journalistic integrity, freedom of the press.</P>
<P>Mann directs with a commendable sense of restraint.  Mann uses
a pseudo-documentary style, to give the film a sense of urgency, which
is highly effective at times.  But the hand held camera work becomes a
bit tiresome and there are a few scenes that could have been tightened
up in the editing room.  There are also a number of characters who
come and go without making much of an impact.</P>
<P>However, The Insider is driven by two powerhouse, Oscar-worthy
central performances.  Pacino is intense and believable as the dogged
and disenchanted Bergman, and delivers one of his best performances
for quite some time.  Heavily made up, Crowe delivers a stand out
performance as Wigand, who acts out of conscience and then helplessly
watches as his life and reputation are systematically destroyed.  He
brings a wonderfully nervous edge, quiet honesty and dignity to his
performance.</P>
<P>Women often get short shrift in Mann's overtly masculine
films, but Diane Venora (from Heat, etc) is impressive as Wigand's
long suffering wife.  And Christopher Plummer (who often has a
reputation for publicly slagging off at his films) is terrific as
veteran journalist Mike Wallace, bringing a pompous air but also an
intelligence to his role.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, The Insider wasn't a huge success in the US,
which may affect its chances at the Oscars.  However, this is a rare
example of Hollywood producing a gripping and intelligent drama that
is also relevant, and it should be put at the head of the list of must
see films of this year.</P>
