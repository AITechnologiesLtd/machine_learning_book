<P>1995, R, 119 minutes [1 hour, 59 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[documentary]</PRE>
<P>Produced by Lynn O'Donnell, Terry Zwigoff, directed by Terry Zwigoff.</P>
<P>Most people are familiar with Andy Warhol, Salvador Dali, and other modern
artists whose art seemed to reflect their bizarre lifestyles. Robert Crumb is
one of those artists, but more blue collar and down-to-Earth and this is
reflected in his artwork. His art defines the division between the sexes, but
portrays them in such a distorted manner , it's no wonder the documentary
"Crumb" was made.</P>
<P>The film does not have much of a linear order, which causes it to be just as
strange as Crumb's artwork. We drop in on him in the present day and learn as
much about him by following him around, meeting others who know and/or are
related to him, and also learn about his past at the same time. </P>
<P>Crumb was a "geek" as a child, who wasn't accepted by his peers and vented
his emotions through his drawings and comics. They say the best revenge is liv
ing well, and Crumb gets his revenge in that manner, as he has become a rich
and famous comic book artist.</P>
<P>We also meet and spend (maybe a little too much) time with Crumb's brothers,
Max and Charles. Charles is over 40, clinically depressed, and still lives at
home. Max is much like Charles, ugly and weird, but seems to have more of a
life than Charles. All of this is just so bizarre it's interesting.</P>
<P>There is some attention paid to the effects of Crumb's artwork, but not
nearly enough. The art is also some of the craziest you will ever see, as
most of it somehow revolves around bizarre sexual situations, where women are
seen as only as bodies to have sex (in Crumb's mind). Is this degrading to
women? Perhaps, but that is not the point of the film. The point is to show
this man's outlook on the world, and in some ways this reflects how all men
feel. At least he does not blame society for his problems. In fact, Crumb is
not really depressed at all, he is quite happy with his situation.</P>
<P>"Crumb" was touching, but often confusing and bizarre. Art is a great medium
to comment about society and provide for quality entertainment and a source
of income. But sometimes the artist is even more fascinating than the art. </P>
