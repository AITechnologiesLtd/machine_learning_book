<PRE>HOLY SMOKE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Harvey Keitel in a dress!  The bizarre image of him in drag may be worth
the price of admission for some filmgoers.  Others may demand a bit more
for their entertainment dollar.  This latter group will probably feel
cheated by HOLY SMOKE, a mess of a movie by Jane Campion (THE PIANO).
Part quirky Australian comedy and part film about cult deprogramming,
the script by Anna and Jane Campion is neither funny nor credible.</P>
<P>With the speed of instant coffee, the show's central character, an
Australian named Ruth (Kate Winslet), becomes a cult member.  With
literally a single touch from a guru in India, she is converted.
Deprogramming in the film is done by an American expert, PJ Waters
(Keitel), who can restore a person's beliefs in a standard three day
ritual.  His three-day miracle cure, he claims, has been successfully
executed on 187 people with only a 3.1% recidivism rate.  ("Day one:
Insult her, get her attention, win her respect," he gives as the first
part of his cookbook recipe.)</P>
<P>This infuriatingly short time for religious conversion and rejection is
made even less believable by Winslet's flighty and flimsy acting.  Only
in her erotic scenes is she ever the least bit convincing.  To be fair,
though, she is forced to say some pretty ridiculous lines.  ("What do
you think of me?" Ruth asks PJ as a taunt.  "Do you like my personality
or my breasts best?"  Given her brat of a demeanor in the story, PJ
doesn't take long to decide his answer.)</P>
<P>Dressed totally in black from his sunglasses to his cowboy boots, Keitel
makes a stunning impression.  But, asked to give an intellectual
performance devoid of much emotional impact, he's embarrassingly
miscast.  Still, Keitel is such a good actor than he manages to make the
part more interesting than it has any right to be.</P>
<P>The movie is filled with an array of eccentric characters.  Typical of
these is the young woman who writes herself fake love letters, which
makes her boyfriend jealous.  She's a twit who makes love to her
boyfriend while looking at the pictures of movies stars and calling out
their names in ecstasy, "Oh Brad [Pitt]!"  She's also inclined to ask a
guy during sex if he has a Web site.</P>
<P>None of these subplots have much to do with the story.  Campion treats
the movie like a mixed salad, throwing in every ingredient in her
kitchen in the hopes of spicing it up.  Rather than enhancing, the
result is sensory overload.  Nothing seems to blend even if some of the
parts are mildly tasty.</P>
<P>Although the movie starts off seriously, it slowly dissolves into pure
kitsch.  And after a semi-satisfactory ending, an unnecessary epilogue
is tacked on that blunts the show's modest impact, making an already
unsatisfactory film even more so.</P>
<P>HOLY SMOKE runs 1:54.  It is rated R for strong sexuality and language
and would be acceptable for high school students.</P>
