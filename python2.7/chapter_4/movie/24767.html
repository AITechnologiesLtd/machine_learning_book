<P>         In the same way the muses inspired the artists of ancient
Greece, the five Lisbon sisters haunt the dreams of the adolescent boys
of Grosse Pointe in "The Virgin Suicides," director Sofia Coppola's
lyrical, chilling adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' novel about sexual
repression and promiscuity in the 1970s. Like those muses, the Lisbons
float out of reach of mere mortals and when they briefly descend to
Earth, they leave broken hearts and poetry in their wake.</P>
<P> Coppola follows the book almost to the letter, using dialogue
sparingly and letting a narration by Giovanni Ribisi carry her film to
its tragic conclusion. But "Virgin Suicides" cloaks the story in layers
of mystery and fantastic imagery, tantalizing its viewers as easily as
the wise-beyond-her-years Lux (Kirsten Dunst) commands the attention of
every young man who crosses her path. No detail is too minor to escape
Coppola's attention: The thump of a needle hitting a record, the
tickling of a clock and the drip from a leaking roof are just as
important in setting the scene here as the Styx anthems, peasant skirts
and shaggy haircuts. Instead of laughing at 1975, Coppola weaves a
sensuous suburban myth that seduces you completely.</P>
<P> "Suicides" is a work of fiction, although, like Eugenides'
prose, it's so believable you half-expect to find a "based on a true
story" label in its credits. The Lisbons are a quietly dysfunctional
family headed up by a do-nothing dad (an amazingly low-key and effective
James Woods) and a religious-fanatic mom (Kathleen Turner) who is so
obsessed with keeping her daughters hidden from the evils of society,
she inadvertently smothers them. Lux, the middle child, is the only one
who escapes her mother's grasp and when she does, she recklessly
searches for some kind of acceptance from the outside world.</P>
<P> With a come-hither smile and relaxed body language, Dunst
magically and vibrantly brings Lux to life. Watching this hopelessly
confused girl give herself up first to a dopey jock named Trip (Josh
Hartnett), then to a parade of anonymous lovers, results in the saddest
and most heart-wrenching sex scenes since Jennifer Jason Leigh's
similarly misguided character lost her virginity in "Fast Times at
Ridgemont High."</P>
<P> Coppola's screenplay doesn't throw out the humor of the novel
either. Far from the little sophisticates we've gotten used to seeing in
teen comedies such as "Down To You" and "Drive Me Crazy," the characters
here are just as awkward and fumbling as most high-schoolers. Since they
can't express their feelings in their own words, the boys call the
Lisbons up and play records over the phone for them. Songs such as
Carole King's "So Far Away" and the Bee Gees' "Run To Me" take on
enormous poignancy as they become the lifeline that keeps the girls
anchored to the outside world.</P>
<P> Even Trip, perceived by all as a dreamy stud, is overwhelmed
when confronted by the love-hungry Lux. It's easy to see why: Dunst,
perhaps best-remembered as the eerily wise little blood-drinker in
"Interview With the Vampire," is now outfitted with a combination of sex
appeal and vulnerability reminiscent of what we saw when the then
teen-aged Uma Thurman slithered through "Henry and June" and "Dangerous
Liaisons." No wonder Mama Lisbon is so worried about keeping her at
home.</P>
<P> The casting of former glamor girl Turner as the plump, pristine
matriarch works exceptionally well. Behind her facade of anxiety you can
glimpse the teasing siren she once was and see that somewhere along the
way Mrs. Lisbon buried her past under heaps of shame and
self-righteousness.</P>
<P> Her daughters refuse to go down that path, however, and instead
find a way to remain forever young and free from their mother's
influence. What's worse, Coppola asks, having children who don't always
behave as we'd like them to, or not having children at all? James
