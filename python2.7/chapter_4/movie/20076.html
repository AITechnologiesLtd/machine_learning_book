<P>   Some decades ago Freud made his most notorious pronouncement, "What
do women want?" Since then writers and movie-makers have obliged with
their answers.  We seem never to get over the idea that what the
female of the species wants is a gentle Prince Charming, a guy who
will take her to his condo in Maui for a weekend, get her a job in the
film he's making, surprise her with a 3-carat diamond and whisk her
off to the altar, a honeymoon in Tahiti, and a happy life ever ever
after.  He'll also remember--without being asked--to put the toilet
seat down after he uses it. This may work for some but the idea that
not all women are enamored of this ideal is nothing new.  Seventy-odd
years ago Noel Coward challenged Prince Charming in his "Design for
Living," a play about a menage a trois focussing on a woman who lives
with a painter, then selects the painter's playwright friend, finally
marrying a third guy, a stuffy, financially successful fellow with
whom she soon grows bored.  Deciding that the conventional life is not
for her, she bolts from her stifling union and heads for the sunset
with her two unpredictable bohemians.  Coward is all but saying
society be damned: do what makes you happy and not what your
traditional parents tell you is appropriate.</P>
<P>   Filmmaker Gregg Araki is obviously inspired by this modern
stage classic in fashioning his current offering, "Splendor."
Araki is known to a generation of teens for his anarchic
"Totally F***ed Up" (about a gang of gay, alienated L.A. kids
who hang out, talk about sex, and complain about
homophobia) and for his breakthrough film "The Living End"
(a road movie about two twenty-something gays who similarly
rage about their circumstances).  This time, Araki considers
the plight of a band of heteros of entirely diverse personalities
who make choices and learn to cope with the difficulties
inherent in their options.</P>
<P>   A zany, postmodern treatment that may suggest the
screwballs comedies of the 1930s, "Splendor" features
Kathleen Robertson ("Dog Park," "I Woke Up Early the Day I
Died") as Veronica, a pretty, promiscuous 23-year-old who
has fled her small town for the life of a temp in L.A. and who
hangs out with an irritating best friend, Mike (Kelly
Macdonald) who recalls the exasperating Mari Hoff of Mark
Herman's "Little Voice."  Almost simultaneously meeting a
witty music critic and unpublished novelist, Abel (Johnathon
Schaech) and the brainless but muscular sexual athlete Zed
(Matt Keeslar), she falls in love with both and develops a
solution to the dilemma.  She comes clean to her two
boyfriends, generates a diabolical party game to get the two
together, and sets both suitors up in her apartment where
they learn to overcome their jealous rivalry and become a
cohesive team.  Becoming weary of their slacker ways and
inability to make even a minimum wage, she walks out on
them and takes up with a handsome and rich but terminally
nerdish TV director, the appropriately named Ernest (Eric
Mabius), who tries to overcome their lack of chemistry by
giving her a role in a his drama, taking her on a whirwind
courtship to his condo in Maui, and presenting her with an
immense diamond ring.  </P>
<P>   Much of the comedy during this latter period comes from
the arrangement made between former rivals Abel and Zed
who--unlike Leo and Otto in the Noel Coward comedy--
continue to live together in Veronica's flat, mutually
whimpering about the pitiful hand they'd been dealt.
The scenes are divided by straight-at-camera narrations by
Veronica, Woody Allen style, as she summarizes events to
date and--completely absorbed in herself--informs us and
also her friend Mike about her thoughts, feelings, and hopes
for the future.</P>
<P>   "Splendor" is a thin, one-premise comedy without
the polished wit of the Noel Coward play that inspired the
script.  Still, Araki has taken a substantial step forward from
his violent, anarchic previous works to assert his take on the
old French theme of the menage a trois.  Women in the
audience are likely to root for the continuance of the
threesome in spite of themselves, as the wholly
compassionate new man in her life, Ernest, looks awfully
good for someone faced by Veronica's predicament.  Araki
films the production with bold, comic-book colors that should
appeal to MTVers as well as to adult looking for a zany, yet
seasoned comedy, though some in the audience may hope
for a break from the terminal frivolity of the enterprise.  The
choices that Veronica makes in the concluding scenes seem
impractical: we wonder how long she can remain deliriously
happy, a woman who seems not to have learned any lessons
from her experiences.  The acting is uniformly appropriate
though Johnathon Schaech has been seen to better
advantage in the off-the-wall "Welcome to Woop Woop."  A
hip sound track with works by The London Suede, Lush, and
Everything but the Girl.</P>
