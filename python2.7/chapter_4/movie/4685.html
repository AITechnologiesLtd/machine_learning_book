<P>     WHITE SQUALL combines male bonding drama, high seas adventure, and 
coming-of-age stories.  For his first film since the disastrously dull 
1492: CONQUEST OF PARADISE, director Ridley Scott (BLADE RUNNER, ALIEN, 
THELMA AND LOUISE) has again turned to the ocean.  This time, however, 
instead of sinking the film with a needlessly meandering plot, he 
energizes the screen with a movie that gives the audience an involving 
narrative and characters to care about.</P>
<P>     Based on the true-life memoirs of Chuck Gieg, WHITE SQUALL 
introduces us to 13 high school students who have elected to spend the 
1960-61 academic year on the American schoolship Albatross (a windjammer 
based out of Mystic, Connecticut).  The Captain is Christopher Sheldon 
(Jeff Bridges), a man who preaches two lessons:  the importance of unity 
among the crew and that "the ship beneath [them] is not a toy and 
sailing's not a game."  His wife, Alice (Caroline Goodall), is the 
ship's doctor and the boys' science teacher.  Other adults aboard are a 
Shakespeare-quoting English teacher (John Savage) and a Cuban cook 
(Julio Mechoso).</P>
<P>     The young crew includes Chuck (Tom Cruse look-alike Scott Wolf), an 
all-American student who wants to break away from his parents' vision of 
what his future should be; Tod (Balthazar Getty), a tough-as-nails kid 
who hides a secret; Frank (Jeremy Sisto), who can't escape from under 
his rich father's thumbnail; and Gill (Ryan Phillipe), a young man with 
a desperate fear of heights.  The trip on the Albatross is their rite of 
passage.  By the end of WHITE SQUALL, those who have survived are no 
longer boys, but men.  </P>
<P>     Given the title, it's no secret that the Albatross runs into real 
trouble.  In nautical language, a "white squall" is a sudden, violent, 
wind-and-lightning storm that can take the sturdiest ship and snap it in 
two.  However, this meteorological catastrophe doesn't make an 
appearance until the film's last forty-five minutes.  Until then, WHITE 
SQUALL devotes itself to developing its young characters, their growing 
admiration for their skipper, and the relationships amongst them.  While 
some of this drama relies on familiar formulas, a capable director like 
Scott can maintain the audience's attention through a long setup.</P>
<P>     As is typical of a Scott film, the visuals are marvelous.  The 
scenes of the Albatross as it rises and falls with the swells of the sea 
are majestic, and the fury of the squall is as terrifying an experience 
as you're likely to find in an adventure film these days.  With the aid 
of cinematographer Hugh Johnson, Scott composes each of these grand 
sequences carefully, in order to convey the maximum effect.  </P>
<P>     Jeff Bridges, who is beginning to look more like his father with 
every passing picture, is in top form, providing a compelling father-
figure/mentor.  The role isn't exactly unique, but Bridges brings enough 
personality to Chris Sheldon to create an interesting character.  John 
Savage, who hasn't done a film in a while, is delightful as McCrea.  The 
young actors playing the boys vary from passable to good, with those 
having key roles doing the better jobs.</P>
<P>     For nearly two hours, WHITE SQUALL is a completely involving motion 
picture, keeping its comic, dramatic, and tragic elements in perfect 
balance.  Unfortunately, the need to end with a DEAD POETS' SOCIETY-like 
catharsis brings the conclusion down.  Hopelessly corny and needlessly-
manipulative, the last scene is bad melodrama.  Mercifully, it lasts 
only a few minutes, and the overriding image left with the viewer as the 
end credits roll is not of this silliness but of the Albatross riding 
the seas in the face of a hurricane-force wind.  WHITE SQUALL is a 
success because the good elements are so well-orchestrated that they 
dwarf the few obvious flaws.  This film offers just about everything, 
including a twenty-minute white-knuckle sequence and a chance to shed a 
few tears.  In short, it's first-rate entertainment.</P>
