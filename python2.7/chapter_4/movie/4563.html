<PRE>                               TWO IF BY SEA
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Two stars if mediocre, that's a rule of mine in movie 
reviewing and boy oh boy does it apply here. I like Denis Leary--his 
supporting rols in DEMOLITION MAN and JUDGMENT NIGHT 
complemented what were already good movies--but when he tries to 
carry a movie himself, as in THE REF, the results are a little less than 
ideal. He can only keep up the complain-about-everything motif for so 
long before it gets stale, and in TWO IF BY SEA he doesn't even give 
us that. His character is more of a brainless jerk than just a jerk.</P>
<P>        And Sandra Bullock I like too, but I still think she wasn't cut 
out for romantic comedies. She does about as well here as in WHILE 
YOU WERE SLEEPING, only here she plays the Jersey Jew stereotype, 
a Rhoda for the 90's. The thing is, Bullock is just too sweet and 
appealing to pull off a brash, abrasive character like that. She's the 
victim of miscasting here, in a role I'd saw was originally intended for 
Marisa Tomei. Again I say, Sandra, stick to the action movies like 
SPEED and THE NET, or at least pick a _funny_ script when you want 
to do comedy.</P>
<P>        So, to recap, both of their characters are unsuited to their 
personalities. In addition, the idea of a Denis Leary-Sandra Bullock 
team-up in the first place isn't something nature ever intended. 
(What's next? Howard Stern and Kathie Lee Gifford?) The premise 
here has Leary as a small-time thief and Bullock as his lover. He's just 
stolen an antique painting and is trying to shake the cops. It opens 
with the traditional car chase and proceeds to a traditional train chase, 
before the two of them find a vacant island mansion to lay low in until 
their buyer shows up.</P>
<P>        Nothing original so far, and if you stick around for the rest of 
the movie, you'll see Leary try to get back to nature by going fishing 
(He ends up shooting the fish. Ha!), a cultured neighbor try to steal 
Bullock away from insensitive Leary and Leary act like a shot-fish-
out-of-water at the neighbor's cocktail party. All of these are second-
rate sitcom and movie cliches that are reworked here with nothing 
original or amusing to add.</P>
<P>        All the while, a group of the dumbest criminals you've ever 
seen and a detective are in the process of tracking Leary down to get 
the painting back. It all leads to a predictable, absurd climax, a 
suitable bookend to this dull comedy. You know, I heard Denis Leary 
say he devoted two years of his life to scripting this movie. It wouldn't 
have hurted to give it another two... if by sea, of course.</P>
