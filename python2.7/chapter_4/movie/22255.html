<PRE>_Onegin_ ** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Only a couple weeks after Neil Jordan's wrenchingly beautiful
_The_End_of_the_Affair_ comes another Ralph Fiennes-starring period
romance adaptation, based on the verse novel by Alexander Pushkin.  In
1820s Russia, the arrogant city-bred sophisticate Evgeny Onegin (Fiennes)
moves to a country estate bequeathed to him by his late uncle.  There, he
becomes the object of admiration for Tatyana (Liv Tyler), sister to the
fiancée (Lena Headey) of his neighbor Vladimir (Toby Stephens).  Onegin
rejects Tatyana, and a tragedy leads him to travel abroad for years; upon
his return, he suddenly feels affection for her, but it may be too late.</P>
<P>Thus the stage is set for grand romantic tragedy, but there's a bigger
difference between _Affair_ and this film than the setting and the
co-star.  Where that film was fiery and passionate, director Martha
Fiennes (yes, Ralph's sister; another Fiennes sibling, Magnus, provided
the score) takes the approach of Onegin--cold and distant.  That
principle is applied to the pacing as well, making the film that much
less involving, even though the two leads--in particular the radiant
Tyler, very at home in period garb--do admirable acting jobs.</P>
