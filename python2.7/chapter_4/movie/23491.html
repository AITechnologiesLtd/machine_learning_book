<P>         Post-WWII America was a place of prosperity and hope. But in
Europe, the conditions were quite different, and few films have captured
the grim atmosphere of the late 1940s as memorably as "The Third Man,"
director Carol Reed's 1949 classic. Shot on location in the war-ravaged
streets of Vienna and written by Graham Greene ("The End of the
Affair"), the movie succeeds both as a thriller and as a mood piece,
evoking a joyless world in which almost everyone has a past they won't
discuss and a future they can't fathom.</P>
<P> For years, we've been watching a 93-minute cut of "The Third
Man," but now Criterion has reissued the film with 11 extra minutes
previously seen only in the European release. The additions prove you
can never have too much of a good thing.</P>
<P> Set at the time of the Allied occupation, the story begins with
American author Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arriving in Vienna to take
a job with his long-lost buddy Harry Lime (Orson Welles). But within
minutes of getting off the train, Martins is told Lime recently died in
an accident. The conflicting stories of the alleged witnesses to the
death make Martins suspicious and, despite protests from British officer
Calloway (Trevor Howard), Martins tracks down Lime's girlfriend Anna
(Alida Valli) and begins searching for the truth about his friend's
fate.</P>
<P> Elements of German Expressionism, Italian Neo-Realism and
American film noir pop up regularly throughout "The Third Man," but Reed
forges them all into a magnificent whole. The titled camera angles
beautifully express Martins' sense of disorientation as he makes his way
through the city and sound and shadow become as much a part of the
action as any of the characters. Decades before Dolby Stereo, Reed
managed to find a way to make it appear voices were coming at the
villain from all directions during the movie's final chase through the
sewers.</P>
<P> Unforgettable images and scenes abound: an angelic-looking
little boy accusing Martins of murder; a taut meeting between two men on
a ferris wheel; the unnerving sight of fingers poking up through a grate
in the street like blades of grass struggling to sprout in a rocky bed.
The music, performed entirely on the zither by Anton Karas, is some of
the most striking ever heard in a film.</P>
<P> Meanwhile, Greene's dialogue crackles with grim humor and
frankness. "You were born to be murdered," Calloway tells Martins, while
the utterly disillusioned Anna's entire outlook on life is summed up in
one of her first lines: "I don't know anything anymore, except that I
want to be dead, too," she murmurs to Martins when he questions her
about Lime's untimely demise.</P>
<P> While the mystery is certainly compelling enough, the
relationship between Anna and Martins is truly the heart of the film. He
falls hopelessly for her and makes a difficult sacrifice in the hopes of
winning her affection, but she's too nihilistic to put any stock in
love. Were it made today, a happy ending would probably be imposed on
these two, but Greene and Reed understood that in real life people who
don't want to be saved rarely thank those who try to rescue them. James
