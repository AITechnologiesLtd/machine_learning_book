<P>Ron Howard, also known as Richie Cunningham from the famous 80's sitcom
"Happy Days", scrapes out another entertaining picture, following the
great success of BACKDRAFT (7.5/10) and PARENTHOOD (7.5/10).</P>
<P>PLOT:
This film covers one day, behind the scenes, in the life of a big-city
newspaper. A possibly untrue story breaks out about two
African-American youths who appear to have killed a pair of out of town
white businessmen. As the day, and the story unfold, we get entangled
in the personal, and professional, lives of every single person needed
to put a news article, and paper, together. Is the truth more important
than a story?</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Entertaining, extremely informative, rapidly-paced film that literally
puts you on the front lines with the cast and crew who fabricate the
news stories which we read in our newspapers every day. This film was
interesting for me because it seemed to give me a lot of insight into
the high-flying antics of a big city newspaper, without dumbing it down
for the sake of the lowest-common audience member. Having said that, I
didn't buy most of the extreme dinky personal stories that ran through
their lives during this one day (it seemed like that one day was the
biggest day in the lives of every single person in the movie!), but
then again, I guess they needed to jazz up some of their stories in
order to make their characters a little more interesting than Woodward
and Bernstein. </P>
<P>The acting was top-notch on all fronts, with Keaton pulling off another
quirky, stressed-out guy role, and Tomei demonstrating some depth as
the pregnant reporter wife who feels her husband's life slowly
trinkling away from her own. Close plays her cold, bitchy editor role
superbly, and Duvall also steps up to the plate as the old, editorial
coot with ailing health and family issues (his "uncomfortable for
everyone in the room" coughing sequence was very cool and authentic.)
One might argue that the film is a little too engrossed in its own
world of high-stakes stories and jargon, but I guess I didn't mind that
aspect one bit. In fact, that's exactly what I liked about the movie.</P>
<P>Overall, this picture will be extremely interesting to all those that
want to know more about the business of selling newspapers, and/or
those looking for some extremely bright acting moments from some of
today's best actors. If neither point interests you in any way, then I
suggest you stay away from this rat-race of a flick, and check out
Howard's more inclusive cinematic vehicles like PARENTHOOD and
BACKDRAFT.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Ron Howard frequently casts younger brother Clint Howard in
small roles. Ron also went to high school with one of the stars of his
movie RANSOM (6.5/10), Rene Russo.
Screenwriters David and Stephen Koepp are brothers. 
When Glenn Close was 13, her father opened a clinic in the Belgian
Congo (now Zaire) and ran it for 16 years. During most of that time,
the Close children lived alternately in Africa and at boarding schools
in Switzerland. Close once dated the ultimate Boston Bruin, Cam Neely.
Jason Alexander's (George from TV's "Seinfeld") real name is Jason
Scott Greenspan. In 1985, he appeared in a commercial for McDonald's
McDLT sandwich.</P>
<P>Critic's note: This film was watched during a weekend layaway in New
York City with Mrs. JoBlo by my side. Chinese take-out food was
thoroughly enjoyed during our screening, which may or may not have, in
some shape or form, altered my enjoyment of this film. Thank you for
understanding.</P>
