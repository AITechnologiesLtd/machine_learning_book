<PRE>MORTAL KOMBAT: ANNIHILATION (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>My mom taught me that if I haven't got anything good to say about
something, then I should keep quiet. It'll be hard to find something good
to say about Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, so I'll have to break that rule
for just one review.
I enjoyed the original Mortal Kombat movie, it was a fun movie. When it
made a bucket-load of money, I figure the studio heads also began loving
the movie, and what do studio heads do when they see a movie that grosses
so high? Produce a sequel of course!</P>
<P>What got me worried about Mortal Kombat: Annihilation was that there was no
press showing before the movie was released, meaning that the all the local
papers were not able to review the movie. This usually means only one
thing: the studio heads want this movie to make lots of money based on
namesake but they themselves have found that the movie was so bad that they
though it would harbor lots of bad reviews -- which might spoil opening
weekend grosses.</P>
<P>My fears were, unfortunately, proven correct. Mortal Kombat: Annihilation
is a horrible movie in which the plot plays out like a teen-ager with a
pocket full of quarters. The story is paper thin -- the gateways to some
evil world is opened up again and bad guys come to Earth to try to steal
the planet for reasons unknown, a group of fighters must fight the bad guys
to win back Earth. The movie moves from one fight scene to another taking
no breaks. At the length that the movie runs, after the first few fights I
was numb to the uniqueness of the heavily choreographed fighting. The
fighting scenes are hampered by some pretty bad special effects. Blue
screen effects standout like a sore thumb.</P>
<P>For the price of admission a Mortal Kombat fan could play a few games of
Mortal Kombat and have more fun than this painful piece of film. This film
should be skipped both on the big screen and on video. This is a horrible
attempt at trying to milk a pretty good original movie. Stay far away from
this one.</P>
