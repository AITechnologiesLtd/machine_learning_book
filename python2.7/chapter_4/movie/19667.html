<PRE>     " Deep Blue Sea "          * *</PRE>
<P>     There is a special-effects second or two in DEEP BLUE
SEA that makes the rest of the film stick out like a sore
thumb.  Samuel L. Jackson rambles incoherently, beginning
to raise his voice (in true SLJ fashion), about a botched...
avalanche mission (?), only to be rudely interrupted mid-
diatribe.  I'm not sure if this was itended as a bit of
self-referential parody - like, even non-human species'
can't stand bad dialogue - but that one, left field jolt
has more wit and humor than a dozen animated sharks or
dismembered bodies which litter the rest of DBS.</P>
<P>I'd like to compliment the local chain where I saw
this film, on Wednesday.  General Cinema, on 6th and Pine,
in Seattle:  great projection/picture quality; vivid color;
great sound; nice, panoramic screen.  Maybe it was just
that I saw one of the first showings of the day, I don't
know.  Sometimes, extraneous elements like these can influence
your viewing experience to the degree you find yourself
enjoying a film - even though, objectively speaking, it
sucks otherwise, probably.  And, I guess that's the case with
DEEP BLUE.  The premise is nifty:  six strangers stuck in
an oceanic research facility, headed by Saffron "could-I-look-
more-bored" Burrows, which is filling up with water, floor by
floor.  "We'll go down, to go up," they decide.  But, how;
what with man-eating Mako at every turn.  Swim 200 feet to the
surface and, having successfully held your breath, there would
still be the sharks to contend with until you've gotten safely
out of the water.  Not to mention avoiding them during the
ascent.  Because they move lightning fast, these sharks, whereas
an average person can only swim "two feet per second".  Not good
odds.  Plan B: stay put, and be killed via the eminent flood, or
a set of razors for teeth, whichever comes first.</P>
<P>The scenario reminded me, in a way, of the husband/wife
scene from THE ABYSS, when they came to the realization that one
of them was going to drown.  DBS has none of that tension or
impact, but the idea's there.</P>
<P>Also, the film looks fabulous.  Visual highlights include a
monkey-bar routine from a ladder, as water rises from below and
fireballs drip from high overhead; an underwater explosion, seen
through a fence; the death of a parrot; an aerial shot of Aquatica,
at sunset.  The shark attacks are explicit (check that twitching
foot), but not over the top; no need to get gross.  The cinema-
tography, I forget who by, is often stunning.</P>
<P>Yet, alas, looks are not everything.  Uh uh, not with this
measure of profoundly stilted dialogue ("Who ya gonna trust?  Me.
Cuz, I'm trust-worthy"), and performances this bland; Thomas Jane
is an expressionless actor - though nowhere the league of Viggo
Mortensen - to avoid... not to self.  The prologue, about reactivating
brain cells, feels profunctory and interminable.  And the action,
when it comes, isn't nearly the envelope-pushing sort I expect from
Renny Harlin (I'm thinking, LONG KISS GOODNIGHT... and scratching
my head).</P>
<P>In an interview, for Entertainment Tonight (I believe),
preceding the movie, Director Harlin described DEEP BLUE SEA as
"JAWS for the next generation".  Nope.</P>
<PRE>     Best line:  tie; "You think water moves fast?  You should
see ice."</PRE>
<PRE>              "Alright, people.  These sharks are thinking,
hard and clear."   </PRE>
