<PRE>HOLLOW MAN
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        What would you do if no one could see you?  Well, if you're a super
smart bio-molecular research scientist working for the military, you'd
grope a co-worker and rough-up your neighbor from across the street.</P>
<P>        That's right.  Of all the non-criminal possibilities brought about
by rendering oneself invisible, in "Hollow Man" Kevin Bacon's character
opts to commit sex crimes.  Er, it's Kevin Bacon who plays the super smart
military bio-molecular research scientist?  Something sounds horribly wrong
already.  But this is a Paul Verhoeven film, and the sleazepin director of
such open-crotch classics as "Basic Instinct" and the infamous "Showgirls"
never lets a little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic
tendencies which, when you come right down to it, is all this film is about.</P>
<P>        "Hollow Man" features a string of hapless, C-list actors (among
them Bacon, Elisabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, and Kim Dickens) in a grade-Z plot
with a lot of special effects that, frankly, don't look much better than
those used in the 1933 version of "The Invisible Man."  Oh Bacon glistens
when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap
flank steak when he's attempting reentry but otherwise it's lots of
"thermal" shots and inanimate objects (Elisabeth Shue included) bobbing
around without any visible signs of support.</P>
<P>        Since invisibility, once achieved, isn't much of an effect (the
actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of
their time talking to each other--it amounts to much of a muchness), the
director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in
loosely-buttoned sweaters so that the minute Bacon's character gets
invisible he can head straight for them.  It's as if that fascinating
concept--what would you do if no one could see you?--is simply a Verhoeven
ploy to show some skin.</P>
<P>        As a horror film, "Hollow Man" is unsophisticated and disturbing
(in its intent, not its achievements) and not worth your time or your
hard-earned dollars.  It's minor Verhoeven--and even that's not saying
much--and boy is it hollow.</P>
