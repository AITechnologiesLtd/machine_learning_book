<PRE>                                HOOP DREAMS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Most of the movie-going public shies away from seeing
documentaries ... and almost three hours?   They want nice,
fictionalized stories.  Those are going to miss out if they do not go
see the very exciting, thrilling, at times heartbreaking, story of two
real inner-city Chicago junior high school athletes whose dream was to
make it one day into the NBA.</P>
<P>     What makes the film so wonderful is that three filmmakers, Steve
James, Frederick Marx and Peter Gilbert, followed and filmed the two
young men, William Gates and Arthur Agee, for almost five years.  While
ostensibly about basketball ... and there is lots of footage showing
practice and games ... the story is really of the hope that motivated
William and Arthur, and about their fathers and mothers and what
happened to each during all the years it took to make the movie.</P>
<P>     More gripping than the basketball scenes are the relations with
the coaches, (one of whom is suing for having been pictured as a kind
of monster), and the personal lives of the young men and their
families.  Fortunately for the filmmakers, if not for the people in
the movie, much takes place that they could not have foreseen but which
enhanced the film with even more drama.</P>
<P>     This is one documentary you do not want to miss even if you do not
know a basketball from a ping-pong ball.</P>
