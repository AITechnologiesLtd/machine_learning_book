<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P> In 1991, we were graced as a viewing public with two of perhaps a dozen
horror movies to date which are actually scary rather than funny.  One was
the Best-Picture winning Silence of the Lambs.  The other was Jacob's
Ladder.</P>
<P> In Jacob's Ladder, Jacob Singer, a Vietnam Vet, is living in the Bronx with
his girlfriend Jezebel.  He's haunted by Post-Traumatic Stress of an
offensive (shortly before the Tet) that he can't remember anything but
scattered images.  Now, the insane world of New York offers to him the
strangest things he can imagine: demons straight out of the Book of
Revelations, horns and all.</P>
<P> As he goes deeper into his own insanity, he begins losing himself in time:
having flashbacks of the mysterious offensive and of spending time with his
wife and three children.  As it stands in the film, you have no idea which
part of it is real.</P>
<P> Although simpler than Lynch's 1997 effort into the psychotically bizarre
Lost Highway, Adrian Lyne does a much better job behind the camera,
delivering unto us stunning visuals of demons and other such monsters
roaming New York.</P>
<P> Sadly, I am at a quandary as to what information I part unto you.  I can
neither confirm nor deny what other people may have said, out of fear of
ruining one of the most shocking and surprising twist endings: one worthy of
a Twilight Zone episode or an O'Henry story.</P>
<P> What I can confirm is the review that states that Jacob's Ladder `redefines
the psychological thriller'.  It does. The psychological thriller is a genre
so diluted from its Hitcockian original (Psycho) by a dozen years of
Halloween-esque cliched horror films that believe the sight of blood itself
is terrifying.  Hemophobics of the world unite!  It has become the genre of
hacks and B-films and drive in necking sessions.</P>
<P> Jacob's Ladder will be a film no one necks during.</P>
<P> Jacob's Ladder is a brilliant effort, straight from the mind of script
doctor Bruce Joel Rubin (Deep Impact), a man repeatedly able to turn out
great stuff on his own and good stuff in collaboration with another writer.
Tim Robbins shines in one of his finest roles (the first in a string of four
great performances including The Player, Short Cuts, and The Shawshank
Redemption) ever to grace the medium of celluloid.  We are also greeted with
Elizabeth Pena, perhaps the most mysterious seductive woman ever on film
(step aside, Sharon Stone, you have company).</P>
<P> As the mystery of the strangely lyrical film unfolds in front of you, one
can't help but wonder why the horror genre, the bastard child of
psychological thrillers, ever came to be at all.  They are this good without
die-hard killers, big-busted screamers, and humorless humor.  Without those
elements, they possess the power to actually frighten someone, a skill that
seemed to be lost until this film came out.</P>
<P> What to say to convince someone to see a film that I know to be excellent?
Should I say that it actually is an excellent film?  Should I tell you that
it is the finest psychological thriller that I have ever seen?  That it is a
mysterious, beautiful, and terrifying film?  I think I should tell you all
of these things, and more, but I have no means to organize my praise for the
film I am extolling.  I only hope that you pick up where my words leave off,
and see the film.</P>
