<PRE>                                  VOLCANO
                       A film review by Paul Miller
                        Copyright 1997 Paul Miller</PRE>
<P>I had been expecting more of this movie than the less than thrilling
TWISTER.  TWISTER was good but had no real plot and no one to simpithize
with.  But TWISTER had amazing effects and I was hoping so would VOLCANO</P>
<P>Volcano starts with Tommy Lee Jones at EMO.  He worrys about a small
earthquake enough to leave his daughter at home with a baby sitter.</P>
<P>There is one small quake then another quake.  Then a geologist points
out to Tommy that its takes a geologic event to heat millions of gallons
of water in 12 hours.  A few hours later large amount of ash start to
fall.  Then....it starts.  The volcanic eruption....</P>
<P>I liked this movie...but it was not as great as I hoped.  I was still
good none the less.  It had excellent special effects.  The best
view...the helecopters flying over the streets of volcanos. 
Also...there were interesting side stories that made the plot more
interesting.  So...It was good!!</P>
