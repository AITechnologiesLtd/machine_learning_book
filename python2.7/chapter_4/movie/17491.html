<PRE>_The_Matrix_ (R) **** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>What is _The_Matrix_?  A derivative mélange of elements borrowed from
other science fiction films, including _Dark_City_, _The_Fifth_Element_,
the _Terminator_ films, _Aliens_, and even this past January's deadly
_Virus_.  Factor in the presence of wooden Keanu Reeves, whose last venture
into the realm of sci-fi was the unspeakable _Johnny_Mnemonic_; Laurence
Fishburne, a fine actor whose talents were lost in uneventful spacefarer
_Event_Horizon_; and Carrie-Anne Moss, arguably the worst actress in the
tantalizingly trashy, much-too-short-lived Aaron Spelling sudser
_Models_Inc._ (which is saying _a_lot_), and expectations aren't exactly
set soaring.  In fact, they come crashing down.</P>
<P>Fraternal writing-directing duo Larry and Andy Wachowski put themselves in
a similar situation with their 1996 debut _Bound_.  In that revelatory
film, they took the unpromising, tin foil-level pairing of Jennifer Tilly
and Gina Gershon as larcenous lesbian lovers and turned into cinematic
gold--no less than one of the best films of that year.  And with
_The_Matrix_, the Wachowski Brothers have once again achieved such a feat
of alchemy, blending these modest parts into a stunning whole that really
has no business working as brilliantly as it does.</P>
<P>Reeves's blank demeanor is a perfect fit for the often befuddled character
of Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer who leads a second life in
cyberspace under the name "Neo."  One night he is contacted by the
enigmatic hacker Trinity (Moss) on behalf of the even more enigmatic
Morpheus (Fishburne) regarding a mysterious concept that has been haunting
him for ages--"the Matrix."</P>
<P>None of this may make much sense in and of itself, but to go into more
detail is the ruin one of the great pleasures of the film: that of
discovery--that of the story's the secrets as the layers are gradually
peeled away and of an entirely new world as imagined by the Wachowskis (and
brought to spectacular visual life by special effects producer Matthew
Ferro).  Once again, they have come up with a story that is smart,
challenging, and completely unpredictable, and their direction is
characterized by an uncommon attention to detail.  For example, the line
deliveries by Hugo Weaving (who plays the sinister Agent Smith) initially
strike one as laughably stiff, but it is eventually revealed to serve a
purpose.</P>
<P>_The_Matrix_ is more than a head trip, however; the Wachowskis deliver the
action goods and then some.  They are the first American filmmakers to
successfully duplicate the wild abandon of the Hong Kong action style, from
a number of exhilarating martial arts fight scenes (choreographed by Yuen
Wo Ping, director of such high-flying HK films as _Iron_Monkey_ and
_Wing_Chun_) to some of the best Woo knockoff shootouts one is likely to
find anywhere.  As viscerally exciting as these passages are, what is
especially impressive is how the Wachowskis come up with an underlying
explanation for all the gravity-defying derring-do--something no Hong Kong
filmmaker has ever bothered to do.</P>
<P>If this review has struck you as incredibly vague, perhaps maddeningly so,
then I have done my job.  As Morpheus tells Neo, ""Unfortunately, no one
can be told what the Matrix is.  You have to see it for yourself."  But I
will say this much more: one of Morpheus's repeated urgings is to Neo is,
"Open your mind," and while watching _The_Matrix_ the audience would be
wise to heed that advice.  Fortunately for all of us, the Wachowski
Brothers already have--and the visionary products of their unbridled
imaginations are free for everyone to experience.  (opens March 31)</P>
