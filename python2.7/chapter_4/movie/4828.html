<P>     The nicest thing that you can say about this movie is that it's
*extremely* easy on the eyes.  Robert Redford plays a seasoned news
producer, Michelle Pfieffer is his ambitious young protege, and,
together, they lend a suitable star power to an otherwise lousy movie.
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL is a grand failure because it's ultimately about
*nothing.* No social statement, no compelling drama, and not even a very
good love story.  We're in fairy-tale land, here, where a female
anchor's drive has less to do with her career than her co-dependency,
and where the biggest story surprise is guessing which hideous hairdo
that Pfieffer will wear next.  Ugh.</P>
<P>     Early in the movie, Redford says of his co-star's character: "She
eats the lens." This fact is also true for the actors as actors.  Sure,
they're too old for their happily-ever-after roles, but R.  and M. bring
an illusion of buoyancy to a steadily sinking ship.  With those two on
screen, who wants to leave early-- even in the middle of a movie as
meaningless as this?</P>
<P>     Unwatchable?  No.  Awful?  Often.  The low points lay like land
mines, ranging from a succession of stomach-turning love scenes to what
must be at least *four* different endings.  And what's with all those
early shots of Pfieffer bending over??  Somewhere in the middle of UP
CLOSE AND PERSONAL-- which was based on the life and times of Jessica
Savitch, until Disney got a hold of it.  Now it's merely "suggested
by"-- the two travel to the Florida Keys, over the highway bridge that
James Cameron destroyed in TRUE LIES.  I kept wishing for those Harrier
jets to return, to blow-up the bridge that would strand them there that
would stop the movie that would send us all home.  It didn't happen.</P>
