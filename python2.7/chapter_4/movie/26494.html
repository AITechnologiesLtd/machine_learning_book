<P>This little preamble doesn't have much to do with the film at hand, but I
just thought it was strange how three of the main actors from this film,
were also three of the main actors from 1988's TUCKER: THE MAN AND HIS
DREAM. A fine film in its own right and probably the best film that Francis
Ford Coppola has directed in the past 15 years. Jeff Bridges played the
president here and Tucker in the latter film. Joan Allen is vying for the
vice-presidency here, and played Bridges' wife in the other film. And the
young Christian Slater played Bridges' son in TUCKER, and a congressman in
this one. While both films are indeed inspirational, I would recommend
TUCKER to anyone who wants to see a real-life tale of a man pursuing his
dreams through an enormous amount of adversity.</P>
<P>PLOT:
The president of the United States must choose a new vice-president to
replace the previous one who died. The president chooses to elect a woman
for the post, a woman who must first proceed through confirmation hearings
run by a powerful political adversary. That adversary attempts to discredit
the nominee by digging up all of her past improprieties and bringing them to
the political forefront. Political clashes ensue.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A solid political film which to my surprise, moved along at a speedy pace,
offered many strong performances, especially the incomparable Gary Oldman,
and provided great entertainment. This movie seemed to have it all packaged
and ready to deliver. An interesting and timely story line, debating the
personal nature of a politician's private life versus the American public's
"right to know". Twists and turns which I personally did not see coming, but
Mrs. JoBlo somehow did. Notable direction by Rod Lurie who admirably took an
extremely politically charged screenplay and turned it into a fascinating
drama, all without bogging it down in overripe political movie jargon. He
even spiced the whole affair up with perfect touches of humor throughout.
Who knew the president could be so loosey-goosey behind the scenes, but gosh
darn it, I bought it all with this film! But the true tip of the cap goes
out to the entire cast of this movie and the characters whom they chose to
inhabit. I loved them all.</P>
<P>Gary Oldman has always been one of my most favorite actors, a man who can
literally change his entire physical being to "become" someone else. In this
film, he completely personifies this character, creating a man who can only
be described as memorable beyond belief (he even managed to make him
irritating while chewing on a piece of meat...grrrr, stop making all that
noise, you bastard!). But he's not the only pearl in the bunch. More kudos
go out to Sam Elliott, a man not known for taking parts in "big" movies, but
certainly perfect as the president's right-hand man in this one. In either
case, I would be somewhat surprised not to see them nominated at the year
end recognition of talent awards. Joan Allen also drives home the intensity,
sensitivity and unshakable convictions of her character, while Jeff Bridges
surprises all as the amiable, yet shrewd president of the United States.
Although I could have done without the bombastic score during his final
sermon...I mean, speech. And yes, even Christian Slater worked as the
up-and-coming congressman looking to make something of himself. All in all,
I thoroughly enjoyed this film and especially its noteworthy performances.
If only this year's real-life candidates were even half as interesting any
of the main characters in this film... :)</P>
