<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 stars</P>
<P>Rush Hour's advertising posters read "The fastest hands in the East meet
the loudest mouth in the West," and that's probably the best description
of this film that you can get.  Chinese spectacle Jackie Chan is given
yet another action vehicle to revel in, but this time his partner is
comedian Chris Tucker, who often steals the show.   The Chan/Tucker
combination is a memorable screen partnership, and is sort of a mix
between the buddy relationship of Tim Robbins and Martin Lewrence in
Nothing to Loose, and the dynamic John Travolta/Nicholas Cage chemistry
in Face/Off.</P>
<P>The only difference here, of course, is that Chan's character is from
the East, and Tucker's the West.  That is emphasized emphatically by
director Brett Ratner, to the point where Rush Hour becomes a humorous
look at a clash of cultures with action scenes to boot (rather than the
other way around).</P>
<P>The calm and constructed Inspector Lee (Chan) and the loud, obnoxious
James Carter (Chris Tucker) form an unlikely partnership after being
brought together by a kidnapping case.  They are both cops - Lee from
China, Carter from Los Angeles - but have very contrasting ways to work.
Lee and Carter soon find themselves in all sorts of trouble, as they
bumble through the streets of LA, trying to find an eleven year old girl
and bring her kidnappers to justice.</P>
<P>Like most Jackie Chan films, Rush Hour relies largely on choreography
and physical stunts.  Chan's screen maneuvers are once again
spectacular, and even after more than thirty years of work, he hasn't
shown any signs of slowing down.  Ever since Rumble in the Bronx and
First Strike exhilarated Western viewers, it seems that even in
Hollywood nobody quite does action like Jackie does action.  That's why
it was just a matter of time until Chan signed on to a big budget
blockbuster.  In doing so, he has made some notable sacrifices: Rush
Hour does not take full advantage of his physical capabilities, and
Chan's subtle comic work is overshadowed by Tucker's loud presence.</P>
<P>When there are so many good reasons to see Rush Hour, it's a pity that
there are also quite a few reasons to give it a miss.  Brett Ratner
never knows exactly how to handle his two exceptional actors, so neither
of them are able to effectively develop on their stereotypical
characters.  Give Chan most of the action and Tucker most of the comedy,
and you have a great partnership, right?  Wrong.  When both actors could
be comedians, and both the action stars, it seems a bit of a cop-out
that their roles are pretty much limited to one or the other.</P>
<P>Fortunately for Ratner, he is far from incapable of making 90 minutes of
solid entertainment.  In fact, occasional moments of Rush Hour seem
almost magical and remind us of the film it could have been.  One scene
in which Lee and Carter share their different skills with each other is
a wonderfully high moment; a time when character and culture are
explored without viewers even noticing.   Most of Rush Hour's other
great moments do not rely on Ratner's direction, but rather the energy
that his two protagonists generate.  A memorable screen partnership is
usually enough to make a passable action film; and in the case of Rush
Hour, it is - although the finished product is not the classic it should
have been.  With any luck a sequel will be made, and Rush Hour 2 will
feature Jackie Chan and Chris Jackie at their best.</P>
