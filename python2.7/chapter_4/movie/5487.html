<PRE>                               THE CABLE GUY
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>First of all, let's get one thing straight. This is not the movie you 
think it is going to be. It's not another "Ace Ventura" and it's not 
very much at all what you would expect from Jim Carrey.
Matthew Broderick is Steven Kovacs, a white collar everyman who has just 
moved out from the apartment that he and his girlfriend shared. His 
eviction came at her suggestion following his marriage proposal. Not 
feeling all that great about his life and attempting to set up 
housekeeping, one of his initial orders of business is to order cable. 
His first mistake.</P>
<P>In a situation everyone can sympathize with, Kovacs waits and waits for 
his cable guy to appear. When Carrey finally shows up to deliver the 
electronic babysitter, he seems a bit off, but gives Kovacs free cable 
and the two lonely guys agree to hang out.</P>
<P>Carrey, who says his name is "Ernie Douglas, but my friends call me 
Chip" (ring any bells?), turns out to be a psychopathic emotional 
vampire who latches on to Broderick like a leech. In the Cable Guy's 
mind they have instantaneously become best buds.
The film has more in common with "Single White Female" and other stalker 
movies than it does with "Dumb And Dumber". It is certainly not for the 
kids (The most humorous event was the loud question from the 
four-year-old girl in the row behind me, "Daddy, what=B9s a prostitute?") 
nor is it overflowing with the typical Carrey stupid physical comedy, 
although it does feature some of that. Can you imagine a Carrey film 
that wouldn't?</P>
<P>For some reason unfathomable to me, audiences at most Jim Carrey films 
are rolling in the aisles in laughter. At this one they'll spend more 
time squirming in their seats. While there are a few funny bits, the 
uncomfortable ones are more plentiful.</P>
<P>Why uncomfortable? Probably because we all have had a "friend" that the 
Cable Guy reminds us of. Someone who has more invested in the 
relationship than we do. Someone who would do anything for us, except 
leave us alone. This film shoves the possibilities in our faces. </P>
<P>Carrey's character takes his position to the extreme: beating up Kovacs' 
girlfriend's date in a restroom, playing "Porno Password" with Kovacs' 
parents, giving Kovacs thousands of dollars worth of video equipment. 
The Cable Guy (we never learn his real name) doesn't have a life so he 
takes over Kovacs'. It's difficult to even write a sentence about him 
without using the word "Kovacs".</P>
<P>Carrey is passable in this role: certainly more of an actor and funnier 
than in his previous attempts. Broderick is always charming, but here he 
seems to concentrate on getting out of Carrey's way. The rest of the 
cast are minor roles that run the range from adequate to almost 
inspired.</P>
<P>There are a few plot problems and some shoddy editing, but it's a 
beginning for Carrey. If, that is, anything could be a beginning for a 
man that makes $20 million.</P>
