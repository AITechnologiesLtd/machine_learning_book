<PRE>Rating: 10 (scale of 1= low 10 = highest)</PRE>
<P>     A must see!  Canadian film maker John Greyson has pulled off the
nearly unthinkable: an uncompromising, in-your-face, Queer/Aids
*musical* that is highly entertaining, and is destined to be a cult
classic.  The film makes no apologies for its randy sexuality, and will
offend more conservative viewers.  But it's refreshing to see a
"message" film that, unlike PHILDADELPHIA, wasn't neutered to please
the Blockbuster crowd.</P>
<P>     Borrowing from a variety of cultural icons, on the surface the
film might be initially mistaken for a fluffy piece of entertainment.
But deft direction, inspired casting, punky rhythms with scathing
lyrics and healthy doses of frontal male nudity save the film from
taking on the didactic overtones of most "message" films.</P>
<P>     The whimsical script has Victorian sexologist and explorer, Sir
Richard Francis Burton (John Robinson), still miraculously alive after
over 170 years (due to an unfortunate encounter with the fountain of
youth).  Burton has resurfaced in the Natural History Museum, where
he's working on his upcoming exhibit, "The Hall of Contagion."  When
his most coveted exhibit becomes unavailable, he hits on the inspired
idea of making "Patient Zero" (the enticing Normand Fauteux, as the
maligned French-Canadian flight attendant, accused of bringing AIDS to
North America) in to the centerpiece of the show.  Like the tales of
Scheherazade, the telling of Zero's tale keeps him "alive," as a lusty
ghost that only Burton can see, and eventually touch.</P>
<P>     The film is peppered with imaginative musical segments that run
the gamut from synchronized swimming, to Buzby Berkeley camera angles
on Michael Callen (in drag as "Miss HIV").  Callen fulfilled a lifelong
dream by holding a note longer (19 seconds) than Barbra Streisand did
in any of her films!</P>
<P>     Though it's easy to rave about the film's more innovative visual
aspects, the glue that holds the film together is the corral of strong
performers that Greyson pulled forth from the highly fecund Canadian
performing arts scene.  The highly watchable Normand Fauteux brings
just the right impish charm to his Zero, who still wants to get laid
after years beyond the Grave.  Even still photographic images of
Fauteux holds the audience's attention like fly paper.  Also notable is
the memorable screen presence of Dianne Heatherington, as an ACT UP
leader who takes no prisoners.  Marla Lukofsky nearly steels the film
when she sings "Contagious," as the African Green Monkey.</P>
<P>     Video and film artist John Greyson's previous work includes "The
ADS Epidemic" ("Acquired Dread of Sex'--1987), and "The Making of
Monsters" (1991).  "Because I come from experimental film and video,
but want to reach broader audiences," Greyson relates, "the musical
seemed to be a perfect strategy.  In a perverse way, I loved adopting
such a traditionally 'fluffy' genre, and applying it to the politics of
such a controversial and depressing subject."</P>
<P>     Composer Glenn Schellenberg echoes Greyson's sentiments: "With
Zero, we were interested in creating a musical space where lots of
popular references would quote a whole smorgasbord of styles."  Not
wanting to privilege one style of music, Schellenberg relates that "our
references were everything from Pet Shop Boys and the Jesus and Mary
Chain to Ricky Ricardo and the Pirates of Penzance."  Calypso meets
barber shop.  Hi-NRG meets Broadway.  Gershwin meets Morrissey.</P>
<P>     Greyson and Schellenberg's songs richly deserve a soundtrack.  Not
every number is memorable, but several songs, particularly "Six or
Seven Things," "Zero Patience," and "Positive" stand out.  In
"Positive," school teacher George, who's losing his eyesight from AIDS
medication, sings the sentiments known to all too many:
        They're positive that I'm positive
        They're sure that these doubts are a curse
        I'm supposed to be certainly certain
        Well, I'm sure that I'm getting worse
        I'm positive I'm here, I'm positive I care
        I'm positive that there's nothing to be sure of
        I'm positive I'm positive, I'm positive I'm still alive
        I'm positive that I'm going to die...
        sometime.</P>
<P>     The randy, male sexuality that's in your face through out the film
will stretch the envelope for some mainstream viewers virtually to the
breaking point.  Yet, somehow, Greyson has managed to inform and
entertain, while breathing new life into the musical format.  Far from
being a comedy (there are searingly personal moments of the pain that
comes from living with the disease), it is a film you will not soon
forget.</P>
