<PRE>SUICIDE KINGS</PRE>
<P> By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.

Sean Patrick Flanery, Jay Mohr, Jeremy Sisto, Johnny
Galecki, Laura San Giacomo, Laura Harris, Cliff De Young</P>
<P>   Imagine an actor giving one of his greatest performance
while spending most of a movie taped to a chair!  The sizzling
dialogue and heart-pounding action of "Suicide King," Peter
O'Fallon's dark comedy about kidnapping evokes a
dazzling performance from Christopher Walken while
highlighting an appearance by four 20-something actors in a
film that is alternately jocose and jarring.  Moviegoers who are
fans of the work of Quentin Tarantino will take to "Suicide
Kings," but so will theatergoers who enjoyed Lyle Kessler's
"Orphans," about a middle-aged man taken hostage by young
people he refers to as the Dead End Kids.</P>
<P>   The kids in "Suicide Kings" are hardly dead-end, though. 
All rich--one even the son of a doctor who considers himself a
pre-med student--they are ironically desperate for cash.  The
charming Lisa (Laura Harris), sister of Avery (Henry Thomas)
and girl friend of Max (Sean Patrick Flanery) has been
kidnapped, an amputated finger sent to Avery, and a random
demand for two million dollars posted.  Unable to raise the
money on their own, the young men put together a daring and
risky plan that soon involves them way over their heads. 
They will abduct the semi-retired Mob figure, Charles Barrett
aka Carlo Bartolucci, and demand that he get his friends in
the Organization to dig up the cash.  </P>
<P>   The movie is loaded with breathtaking action that contends
with its broad humor, keeping the audience wide awake and
involved in scipters Wayne Rice and Gina Goldman's bracing
exchanges.  It becomes clear even in the scene involving the
chloroforming of their hostage in a madcap drive through a
New York City tunnel that these kids are as much in the game
for the sheer delight as for the money.  Brett Campbell (Jay
Mohr) is particularly convincing as the one kidnapper who
adamantly refuses to cozy up to the quartet's captive,
delivering a fully three-dimensional performance in his best
appearance to date.  Shedding his image as a stand-up
comic on Saturday Night Live and his unimpressive role as a
clueless accomplice to Jennifer Aniston's machinations in
"Picture Perfect," Mohn is captivating as the conspirator who
is opposed even to untying one of his victim's hands even
while the mobster is bleeding to death from an dismembered
digit.</P>
<P>   "Suicide Kings" becomes one of the year's great mobster
flicks largely by the way the rich kids are treated as
individuals with their own, distinct personalities.  The most
amusing fellow is Ira (Johnny Galecki), a nerdy guy whose
father's home is used by the gangsters as their headquarters
completely unbeknownst by the bespectacled young man who
expected nothing more than a game of poker and a few
beers.  Having a father who marks the levels of liquor in his
bottles, Ira is concerned more with cleaning up the blood on
the carpet than on the consequences of the crime, and uses
the opportunity to take revenge on the pals that must have
put him down not infrequently for his fussy ways.  Jeremy
Sisto comes across as the kid who hopes the AMA will not
look harshly on his activities when the time comes for him to
begin practicing medicine in about seven years.  A drug
addict equally adept at giving his prisoner sedating IVs as
with injecting himself with heroin, the young man known as
T.K. shows a side more concerned with most of the others
with his client's welfare, pointing out that the mobster is
probably an alcoholic whose liver is unable to process Vitamin
K and is therefore prone to bleeding freely.</P>
<P>   While "Suicide Kings" has a plot with enough twists and
turns to keep the audience unnerved, it features also the
comic side of Barrett's enforcer, Lono (Denis Leary), who can
shoot people without the slightest concern and yet show
remarkable defensiveness about the alligator boots for which
he paid $1,500.  </P>
<P>   The title "Suicide Kings" comes from the game of poker, in
which the titled monarchs are a wild card, but the best feature
of the movie is the virtual chess game in which Barrett tries to
outmaneuver his captors and save his own life by using his
wits.  Convincing the boys that the kidnapping is an inside
job, that at least one of the five affluent kids has a direct hand
in the kidnapping of Max's girl friend, Barrett demonstrates the
adage that the pen is mightier than the sword.  </P>
<P>   "Suicide Kings" features several scenes of intense brutality
including the bloody, bandaged hand of the captive, a
baseball-bat bashing by Lono of an abusive pimp, and an
intense tunnel ride involving the pile-up of motor vehicles
filmed with style, even poetry.  The narrative moves
relentlessly, sidetracked only once during a throwaway scene
featuring a long-haired Christopher Walken during the hippie-
influenced 1970s, a winning action piece edited sharply and
designed to appeal to an audience craving both visceral
particulars and clever colloquy.  Rated R.  Running Time: 106
minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
