                       A film review by Eric Robinette
                        Copyright 1997 Eric Robinette</PRE>

<P>Starring:  Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, Edward Norton, Brett Harrelson.
Written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski; directed by Milos
Forman.</P>
<P>"The People vs. Larry Flynt" is gross. That's why it's so great.</P>
<P>Okay, so the choice of words, is, well, a little blunt. But hey, since
we're talking about the infamous Hustler founder who won over the Supreme
Court, someone whose middle name might have been "blunt," I figure it's
only appropriate.</P>
<P>Anyway, back to this gross thing.  Things that are gross tend to be great
movie subjects. Take "Vertigo," for example. It's about a man unerringly
obsessed with a dead woman, "A Clockwork Orange is about a man who goes on
violent sprees just for kicks.  These people at heart, are really
repellent, and yet, for better or worse, the audience is made to like them
and side with them because we hate the forces against them worse than we
do the one being maligned.</P>
<P>Along these lines, the fact that "Larry Flynt" very obviously sides with
its hero is not, as some people have indicated, a flaw.  Focusing only on
the pro-and-con of free speech could be boring and obvious.  In fact, I
would argue that the free speech debate, while powerful, isn't the most
compelling part of the movie. It was  a much more impressive  feat to take
a repugnant character and make the audience side with him even if they 
might not personally like him.</P>
<P>First and foremost to credit in this feat are the actors.  Woody Harrelson
turns in a veritable tour de force that ranks, I think, as the most
powerful of 1996..  As Flynt veers from smug bar owner to devout,
born-again Christian to crestfallen paraplegic to defiant crusader, we see
a man put through an emotional wringer that literally almost killed him. 
The fact he keeps standing up despite all his enemies, despite his
confinement to a wheelchair, is what makes him such a compelling figure.</P>
<P>No less astonishing is Courtney Love as Flynt's flamboyant wife, Althea
Leisure.  No, it's not so surprising that she can play a scraggly,
strung-out prostitute, but how sympathetic she makes her.  The image of
her gripping the barrier separating herself and Flynt while he's in prison
burned into my memory.</P>
<P>And caught in the middle of this Constitutional whirlwind is that rising
star Edward Norton, who remains the calm of the storm as he dazedly tries
to hash out all the craziness around him and becomes the clear ringing
voice in support of free speech that even repellent trash like Hustler is
right to practice. </P>
<P>Ultimately, the tricky balancing act this movie pulls off is what makes it
one of the best films of the year. I've heard people argue that it's
drama, while others insist it's a comedy.  A case can be made for both;
after all, a movie that has about a man despised by many who gets shot and
paralyzed with a wife who irrevocably spirals to doom wouldn't seem to be
a barrel of laughs.</P>
<P>And yet the picture is acidly funny. Screenwriters Scott Alexander and
Larry Karaszewski, who also penned "Ed Wood" have a gift for making
guttural characters seem both funny and human. They have an ideal partner
in director Milos Forman, who has his own gift for taking larger-than-life
characters (like Mozart) and making them seem more human by revealing how
humorous and vulnerable they are.</P>
<P>So, at heart, The People vs. Larry Flynt, is a dramatic comedy, and a
great one at that. I know that it's cheating by having my cake and eating
it too, but it's the best description I could come up with about this
story of a man who is so gross he's fascinating.</P>
