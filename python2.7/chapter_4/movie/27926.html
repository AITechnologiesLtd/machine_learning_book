<P>PLOT:
A renowned British hairdressing competition is coming to a small town and
the local barber is iffy about hopping aboard. That is, until his son and
ex-wife get together and convince the man to join. And for kicks, his old
hairdressing nemesis is also entered into the tournament. Sounds kooky,
right? Well, his ex-wife is dying of cancer and she left him for another
woman a few years back. Have a blast!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
It seems as though every other year, the Brits slap a cute, quirky, small
town comedy into our theatres and into our hearts and as that same time of
year rolls around again this year, well...this movie is definitely not it!
Predictable, highly uneven, filled with too much drama and not enough humor,
this unfortunate attempt at capturing a small town's "obsession" with a
quirky British hair-styling competition, doesn't deliver much on any front.
The film lacks any real emotional narrative drive, falls flat on way too
many supposed jokes (although I couldn't really tell if they were supposed
to be funny sometimes, but I think colored sheep are supposed to be,
right?), has a very boring soundtrack featuring tunes decades old and just
seemed about 15 years past its prime. The only semi-redeeming quality of the
film is its actors, but even this eccentric bunch couldn't save this oddly
fashioned movie screenplay. Here's a film which tries to mix a woman dying
of cancer, a quirky hair contest, a lesbian couple dealing with past
infidelities and a teen romance all in one big pot, but none of it seems
sincere, interesting or fresh. In fact, there really isn't one thing in this
movie that isn't easily forecast about three scenes before it happens.</P>
<P>And to top that off, most of the characters are just plain boring. It isn't
bad enough that the film hasn't properly characterized the folks in the
movie for us to care about, but couldn't they at least have made them more
interesting? There's no panache here...zero! They should've taken some
lessons from all of the fun characters designed for a similar type of film
named BEST OF SHOW from last year. I mean c'mon, sure I was impressed by
Josh Hartnett's accent (although I have no idea if it was locally accurate
or not-"Mum!"), but couldn't the kid also been given an actual personality
to boot? (mind you, his "bedhair" remained intact) Or how about giving Alan
Rickman more to do than just stare at the screen and feel sorry for himself?
And is Rachael Leigh Cook ever going to develop into anything more than an
adorable little face on the big screen? I sure hope so. In the end, the film
falters the most in its inability to effectively balance its humor and
drama, and ends up being too emotional when it shouldn't be, and not funny
enough, when it should be. The best thing for this film would have been for
it to be released as a straight-out comedy or a straight-out drama, but this
shot in the dark was definitely not the way to go. Even a shot of Heidi
Klum's bush couldn't save this puppy (and I ain't kidding about that!).</P>

<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Yipes! This film was written by none other than the screenwriter of the
highly successful British comedy, THE FULL MONTY, Simon Beaufoy. I guess the
second time around is not always a charm, eh? Actually, he has apparently
been trying to distance himself away from this project (I could see why!),
which is why the credits of this film actually read "Based on a screenplay
by..."
Actress Natasha Richardson is married to actor Liam Neeson.
This film was originally titled NEVER BETTER.</P>
