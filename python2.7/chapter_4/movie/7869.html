<P>    Sandra Bullock in high heels and wielding a chainsaw?  Yup, it's
gotta be summer.</P>
<P>    Just when you thought the pointless sequel had gone the way of
franchise films and direct-to-video releases, into port slams SPEED 2:
CRUISE CONTROL, the gloriously godawful follow-up to the 1994 sleeper
about a bus rigged to explode if it slowed below a certain speed.  The
gimmick, this time, is an ocean liner rigged to, well, crash into stuff.
Sound exciting?  Dennis Hopper's disgruntled bomb squader, the villain
of the first film, has given way to Willem Dafoe's disgruntled computer
programmer, a maniac whose main beef has something to do with having to
use live leeches, I kid you not, as a self-treatment for copper poison-
ing.  (And said poisoning induced by prolonged exposure to electro-
magnetic fields, no less!  Calling Dean Edell...) So, he overrides the
boat's computer, convinces the crew to abandon ship, and sends the
remaining passengers, those who couldn't evacuate in time, on a col-
lision course with destiny.  (Oddly, no one thinks to just...  jump off
the back of the boat.)</P>
<P>     With Keanu Reeves electing not to return-- perhaps he read the
script?-- the job of John McClane goes to Jason Patric (SLEEPERS), as
the *second* LA cop and SWAT team member that that bus drivin' babe
Annie (Bullock) has dated.  (What are the odds?) They're on this
Caribbean cruise for pleasure, as are a handful of requisite stock
characters, including a deaf teenager (!) who has a crush on the hero
(!!) who also knows how to sign (!!!).  (And you thought the Raptor Slam
was a cool summer movie move?  Wait till you see the feats that *this*
little girl can do, when stuck on a shipboard elevator!) Bullock is her
pesky, perky self, though she ends up with far less screen time than her
top billing suggests.  (Those paying attention to her bikini- and tank-
tops probably won't complain, however) Patric is the main man in motion
and that's damn good, 'cause when he stops to talk, he's only slightly
less monotone than his predecessor.  (His first LOL line is to Ms.
Bullock:  "I'd like to boogie with you.")</P>
<P>     Of course, nobody in front of the camera embarrasses themselves
quite the way that returning director Jan de Bont does.  He also
produced this mess, which is insulting even by the most lax summer
standards.  (CON AIR, BUDDY, FATHER'S DAY, ROMY AND MICHELLE'S HIGH
SCHOOL REUNION, MURDER AT 1600, 8 HEADS IN A DUFFLE BAG, ANACONDA, VEGAS
VACATION, MEET WALLY SPARKS, METRO, BEVERY HILLS NINJA, THE RELIC, all
is forgiven).  Worse, he's spent a hundred mil on a premise that doesn't
even live up to its title!  There's no sweat-inducing motion of the
ocean here-- just two hours of shaky handheld camera work and a handful
of cross-cut exteriors, all leading up to the big slam, when the love
boat sideswipes an oil tanker and then plows into a harbor town.  (Oh,
how far we've come in twenty years.  Remember the simple fun of seeing a
locomotive smash into railway station in THE SILVER STREAK?) Admittedly,
either of the aforementioned sequences is worth the price of admission.
It's just the rest of the movie-- the other hundred or so minutes--
that's pure nonsense.  And wonderful nonsense at that.  I know he didn't
intend to, but de Bont has done one thing right:  he's created the
hands-down funniest film of the year.</P>
<PRE>     So, now, allow to present a few more things that made me laugh:</PRE>
<PRE>     o a box with a big label: "fiber optic converter"</PRE>
<P>     o plain English, whole-sentence computer instructions</P>
<PRE>     o an entire sequence devoted to opening a fire door</PRE>
<P>     o Jason Patric's character walks onto the bridge and immediately
       understands everything that's happening</P>
<PRE>     o a ships' navigator who speaks in a Scottish accent and actually
       gets to say "I canna override it!"</PRE>
<P>     o Willem Dafoe's amazing arm-mounted keyboard</P>
<PRE>     o two living, breathing adults (Bullock's character and the First
       Mate) who have to be told, step by step, how to disconnect a trip
       wire from the pin of a hand grenade.  Duh</PRE>
<PRE>     o "No wait!" screams the ship's intercom</PRE>
<PRE>     o yet another damn dog in peril</PRE>
<P>     o fishing reel.  Pontoon plane.  Memories of WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S</P>
<PRE>     o an oil tanker that explodes for no apparent reason.</PRE>
<PRE>     Any others?</PRE>
<PRE>     Grade: F </PRE>
<PRE>     (Or, as a comedy, Grade: A)</PRE>
