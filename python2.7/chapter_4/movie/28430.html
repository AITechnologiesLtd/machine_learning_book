With Sam Neill, Patrick Warburton
De Vargas     PG-13     104 mnin</PRE>
<P>     It's not that there are no good movies.  It's just that the chains 
can't be bothered to show them.  Take The Dish, a delightful Australian 
comedy that picked up nine nominations from the Film Critics Circle down 
under, and has been an audience favorite at festivals.  UA opened it 
here last Friday at the De Vargas, with no critics' screening or advance 
notice.  By the time you read this it will most likely be gone.  UA, you 
see, only brought it in for a week to keep a few seats warm until they 
hit us next week with the $100 million video game adaptation Tomb 
Raider, which they plan to spread across three screens, two at the North 
and one at De Vargas.</P>
<P>This is not to knock Tomb Raider, which for all we know may be the 
best thing since the Cooking Channel.  But wouldn't two screens do?  And 
leave us one for The Dish, as a sop to that small but deserving audience 
who would rather see a hilarious and moving little character-based 
comedy than watch Angelina Jolie riding a motorcycle and kicking ass.</P>
<P>But back to The Dish.  The tiny town of Parkes, New South Wales is, 
in 1969, the proud home of the Southern Hemisphere's largest radio 
telescope - a 1,000 ton dish that towers over a sheep paddock.  When 
NASA launches Apollo 11 toward the moon, it needs a backup facility to 
relay the signals from Neil Armstrong's historic "giant leap for 
mankind" when its Goldstone, California dish is on the wrong side of the 
planet.  </P>
<P>Parkes is agog.  The Prime Minister (Bille Brown) is coming.  The 
American Ambassador (John McMartin) is coming.  The Mayor (Roy Billing) 
and his wife Maisie (Genevieve Mooy) are beside themselves with the 
honor, even if their sullen rebel of a teenage daughter Marie (Lenka 
Kripac) is not.  And out at the facility, the small team of scientists 
led by director Cliff Buxton (Sam Neill) and NASA overseer Al Burnett 
(Seinfeld's Patrick Warburton) is nervously preparing for its moment of 
history. </P>
<P>Director and co-writer Rob Sitch (The Castle) weaves the charm of a 
comedy of quirky small-town characters with the excitement of one of 
history's most world-uniting events, with 60 million people glued to 
their black-and-white televisions ("And do the people in India get to 
watch it?" sniffs Marie.)  Neill anchors the movie with his tweedy, 
almost unflappable father-figure of a project director, and the rest of 
the cast is wonderful too.  The movie is filled with little human 
things, some of them very real and understated, some of them played for 
character zaniness, but Sitch never crosses the line to comic 
condescension.  Much of it is funny, some of it is thrilling, some of it 
brings a tear to the eye.  It does have a few downside moments, such as 
having to listen to Oliver's "Good Morning, Starshine" warbling on the 
sound track, but it's a small price to pay.</P>
<P>If UA doesn't have the sense to hold The Dish over, keep an eye on 
The Screen over at CSF, where they'll be trying to get hold of it in the 
next few weeks. </P>
<P>The Screen, by the way, is going this week with a festival of Toto 
movies.  No, not the little dog from Kansas, but the phenomenally 
popular Italian screen clown who at the height of his popularity in the 
'50s and '60s was regarded as one of cinema's greatest comics, on a par 
with Chaplin and Keaton.  Toto was born in 1898 to impoverished 
gentility (he was a Neapolitan baron) but became a true aristocrat with 
his ascension to movie stardom after a successful career in Italian 
music hall, where he honed his comic persona, which  was Chaplinesque, 
but also utterly and distinctively his own. </P>
<P>He was the titular character in a whole series of Toto comedies, a 
number of which will be at The Screen's festival and all of which are 
well worth seeing.  But don't miss Big Deal on Madonna Street, in which 
Toto joins a cast headed by Vittorio Gassman and Marcello Mastroianni to 
pull off a jewel heist in Rome.  This classic 1958 comedy, directed by 
Mario Monicelli, has been unsuccessfully copied a couple of times in 
American cinema, most recently by Woody Allen as Small Time Crooks.  The 
Screen will be showing it at 7:15 on Saturday and Monday evenings, with 
a 3:00 matinee on Sunday afternoon. </P>
