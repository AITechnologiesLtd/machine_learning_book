<PRE>The Mask of Zorro (1998)                                    </PRE>
<P>Seen on 14 July 1998 with Andrea and Patrick at the UA 64th and Second.
Studio preview.</P>
<P>The Zorro tale has been treated more than two dozen times in movies, since
the silent days. I was not completely familiar with it, though, and until
recently the most exposure I had to it was my plate-and-mug set from
childhood. I liked the marketing, so it follows I would like the movie
too.</P>
<P>The previews for *The Mask of Zorro* were quite long and practically gave
away the whole movie. So I thought I knew what to expect. I was wrong.
There was a lot more intelligence and thought in this recent incarnation.
It's got a lot of humor and wit to go along with all the swashbuckling and
swaggering. </P>
<P>There is some heavyhandedness, melodrama, and even some outright
silliness, but the movie is enjoyable nonetheless. It is fast-paced and
engaging. Perfect for a summer movie, and a lot more rollicking than any
of those comets or lizards bent on destroying New York City.</P>
<P>The story is your basic good-versus-evil tale. Don Rafael Montero (Stuart
Wilson) is an inate baddie who is raping the resources of Mexican-held
California in 1821. He is more than willing to kill innocents to lure the
mysterious Zorro out into the open. But Zorros is able to fend off
countless attackers with vigor and swordsmanship. He gets a little help
from the Murrieta brothers along the way.</P>
<P>Flash ahead to 20 years later. Don Rafael has arrested Don Diego de la
Vega (Anthony Hopkins) and absconded to Spain with Elena de la Vega as his
own daughter. But he returns as governor of California and brings her
fully grown back (with Catherine Zeta-Jones as the full-figured Elena)
with him. De la Vega gets out of prison and is seeking revenge. Along the
way he re-encounters the grown-up Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas),
now an ungroomed horsethief. A tale of revenge and honor ensues, as worthy
of the tradition as other tales of this ilk, like the better known *Count
of Monte Cristo*. Both Zorros are heroes to the people; the elder Zorro is
a rich man who doesn't have to help anyone, but follows a higher moral
code. I guess that's what makes him so sexy. That, and long hair. It all
depends on whom is asked.</P>
<P>While Don Rafael and a younger baddie, Captain Love (Matthew Letscher)
scheme to use California gold to buy the land from the Mexican government,
using natives to mine in in concentration-camp-like conditions, de la Vega
mentors Murrieta in swordsmanship and charm so they can both exact revenge
on their mortal enemies. These are among the most enjoyable scenes. </P>
<P>There is a lot of swordplay and impossible escapes in *The Mask of Zorro*,
some of them very comic. Some of them are also very heartstopping. It is
all abetted by great music and lavish costumes and set design.</P>
<P>Hopkins is by far the best actor in the bunch. Catherine Zeta Jones is
rather good also (watch for her "cleavage stage right" scene). Bandaras is
pretty good too; it's hard to believe, sometimes, that he's not just there
to look good and make a good percentage of the audience pant with sexual
desire. He's not a bad actor, but he's no Anthony Hopkins, who's not made
a bad movie for the past decade. But, Hopkins and Bandaras are both worthy
successors to the mantle first made famous by Douglas Fairbanks in the
silent era. He did his own stunts though. Today a small army is on hand to
help in that department. </P>
<P>Directed by Martin Campbell; original music by James Horner; production
design by Cecilia Montiel; costume design by Graciela Mazón.</P>
<P>Audience Note: A woman in front of us actually *gasped* when Don Rafael
opened a box to reveal a single bar of gold. Andrea and I could not stop
laughing.</P>
<P>Historical Note: Four years after the fictional Zorro story ends, the US
steals half or Mexico or more and we all lived happily ever after. Except
for the Mexicans. <HR>Copyright (c) 1998, Seth J. Bookey, New York, NY 10021
