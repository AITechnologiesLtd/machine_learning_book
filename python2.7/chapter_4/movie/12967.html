<P>Note: Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers.
      Be forewarned. </P>
<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   The two niche film genres which roared to success in the 1980s only
   to be arguably overmined were the slasher flick and the teen comedy.
   As the genres reached the end of their respective heydays, it became
   clear that audiences grew tired of watching maniacs in ski masks
   hacking up young virgins, while the typical formula adhered to by
   teen comedies eventually devolved to a group of guys in
   alcohol-induced romps spying on nubile young women in showers.  The
   best films of the teen comedy genre, which CAN'T HARDLY WAIT clearly
   aspires to emulate, the SAY ANYTHINGs and the FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT
   HIGHs, exceeded this stupefying formula by being more observant and
   giving us more -- relevant characters we could care about, and
   indelible, resonant moments: can anyone soon forget the wonderfully
   poignant and emotionally powerful scene in SAY ANYTHING with John
   Cusack standing defiantly with his boombox hoisted overhead?</P>
<P>   There aren't any moments like this in CAN'T HARDLY WAIT, and in truth
   the film doesn't remotely approach the zenith of the genre, but it's
   a harmless, watchable piece with a few somewhat touching moments and
   sporadic funny bits amidst the all of the adolescent hijinx which
   comprise its bulk.  Originally titled THE PARTY (and renamed when MGM
   indicated plans to remake the 1968 Peter Sellers film of the same
   name), CAN'T HARDLY WAIT appropriately spends almost all of its
   ninety-eight minute running time at a raucous house party being held
   to celebrate the senior class graduation of Huntington Hills High
   School.  Here we meet the usual suspects -- the stunning prom queen
   Amanda Beckett (Jennifer Love Hewitt), the self-absorbed class jock
   Mike Dexter (Peter Facinelli), the socially-inept class braniac
   William Lichter (Charlie Korsmo), the self-styled hipster Kenny
   Fisher (Seth Green), and, in a nod to SAY ANYTHING's John Cusack and
   Lili Taylor, our lovelorn chief protagonist Preston Meyers (Ethan
   Embry) and his faithful sardonic friend Denise Fleming (Lauren
   Ambrose); give her a guitar and him some kickboxing moves, and the
   homage would be complete.  Preston has been mooning over Amanda since
   he first saw her four years ago, and with she being unceremoniously
   dropped by her longtime boyfriend Mike and this being his last night
   in town before heading off to a Boston college, he's convinced that
   the fates are aligned in his favour (the incongruous broadcast of
   Barry Manilow's "Mandy" on the radio is a cincher) and heads to the
   party, Denise in tow, in order to win Amanda's heart.</P>
<P>   The motives of the other major characters are decidedly less
   poignant.  Mike, dumping Amanda in his plan to upgrade to college
   women, is out to convince members of his clique to do likewise to
   their high school girlfriends.  William seeks vengeance on Mike for
   years of torment and ridicule in school, and, in the film's most
   misconceived subplot, devises an ridiculous revenge fantasy involving
   chloroform and Polaroids.  And Kenny, who winds up revealing his true
   colours as a poseur, is simply looking -- desperately so -- for some
   action.  The many other characters which populate the party are
   cardboard-thin in depth and accordingly sport names such as Girl
   Whose Party It Is and Exchange Student.  (Melissa Joan Hart of
   SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH makes an impression as the overly zestful
   Yearbook Girl.)</P>
<P>   The cut-loose antics at the crowded, energetic party, in all its
   picture-defacing, furniture-destroying, beer-swilling glory, is at
   times amusing to watch and is supported by an entertaining
   soundtrack, but the film improves when it shifts its focus away from
   the teeming masses of revellers and towards its detached primary
   characters.  Denise and Kenny are the furthest removed from the
   festivities, literally isolated in a locked bathroom by an accidental
   mishap which eventually leads to a extended session of THE BREAKFAST
   CLUB-styled soul-searching and meditation, but almost all of the
   other characters are in some form similarly set apart from the party:
   Amanda mopes through the celebration in the haze of an identity
   crisis, while Mike stumbles about in confusion as he learns that his
   influence over his friends isn't strong enough to overcome their
   hormones.  Meanwhile, Preston wanders around on the brink of the
   ongoing chaos, trying to summon up the courage to present Amanda with
   his heartfelt love letter.</P>
<P>   The screenplay by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan, who also shared
   direction duties, is at times unforgivably lazy -- there are two
   separate occasions where, having presumably written themselves into a
   wall, summon up an incidental character (cameoed by recognizable
   faces such as Jerry O'Connell as a one-time highschool bigshot and
   Jenna Elfman as an ersatz roadside angel) to essentially tell their
   characters what to do next -- but there are moments of cleverness in
   the film, and CAN'T HARDLY WAIT captures the sheer purity of
   Preston's adolescent longing, when the love for a girl is so
   overwhelming that it's the only thing that matters in the world.</P>
<P>   The film's young cast fares well in the film.  Mr. Embry conveys his
   character's dreamy-eyed nature well, while Ms. Hewitt is attractive
   and convincing as his dreamgirl.  Ms. Ambrose is given the most
   complex character and the sharpest dialogue, and acquits herself
   nicely.  Mr. Green's character undergoes the biggest character arc
   in the film, and surprises in his ability to draw audience empathy.</P>
<P>   CAN'T HARDLY WAIT concludes in the way that many films of the genre
   do, with freeze-frame shots of its central characters as superimposed
   text appears at the bottom of the screen spelling out their
   respective eventual fates.  As the final shots of the film unrolled,
   I sunk in my seat -- this device usually leads to a series of glib
   one-liners that typically aren't either clever nor funny.  While this
   rule-of-thumb holds mostly true here, the final three lines, perfect
   in their simplicity, conclude the film on just the right note.</P>
