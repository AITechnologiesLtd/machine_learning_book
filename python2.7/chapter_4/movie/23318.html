<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is one of the top fight films ever made, along with Raging Bull and
Body and Soul. It is reportedly the role Robert Ryan, the college boxing
whiz liked the best, and the one he probably gave his best performance
in. It is the only boxing film developed from a poem. It was fleshed out
into a screenplay by boxing aficionado Art Cohn. The director, Robert
Wise, wanted to use the ring for a metaphor about the corrupt world,
using the innocence of a boxer against those in the business who tried
to make him take a dive. Wise captured the mood of the smoked-filled
arena, the fans' reactions, and the dirtiness of the boxing world. The
dark streets of Los Angeles, the brutality of the sport, and the seedy
hotels where the struggling boxers reside, were photographed in a gritty
manner, giving the film its noir look.</P>
<P>Stoker (Ryan) is a 35-year-old washed-up fighter. He is on the card for
tonight's fight at the Paradise City arena, a second-rate boxing venue.
His wife Julie (Totter) can't stand to see him fight any more, so she
waits for him back in the seedy hotel, though he is hoping she shows up
to watch him. Becoming restless, she wanders the streets that are filled
with arcades, bars, and chop suey places. She stops on a bridge to watch
the passing trolleys below and then listens intently to a radio ringside
report of the boxing match coming from a newspaper stand, and is
relieved to find that it was not her husband who was knocked out.</P>
<P>Tiny (Tobias), Stoker's manager, has arranged with the underlings of a
notorious gangster, Little Boy (Baxter), to fix the four round fight
after the second round. After receiving fifty dollars for the fix, he
decides not to tell Stoker, figuring he couldn't beat the much younger
fighter, Tiger Nelson (Hal), anyway. His cut man, veteran character
actor with the high-pitched, squeaky voice, Red (Percy), who is told by
Tiny that he got thirty dollars for the fix, receives his cut of ten
dollars but thinks it is mistake not to tell Stoker about the fix.</P>
<P>The film looks as if it is being shot in real time, as Stoker awaits in
the dressing room, exchanging good-natured barbs with the other boxers
present and listening to their nervous chatter. They are all dreamers,
filled with their own apprehensions and wants,  men caught in a world
where they have little chance of succeeding, but that million to one
shot to make it to the top is what motivates them.</P>
<P>The boxing scenes looked real. Stoker feeling he could win, goes all
out, even as his face is pummeled. The crowd was made up of an
assortment of fans, some there to wager, others to eat and enjoy
themselves, some getting a kick out of the mayhem seen, and a blind man-
having his pal give him a detailed description of the fight- just loving
the violence. After the third round, Little Boy's cronies realized they
had been double-crossed, as Stoker was holding his own, refusing to go
down. At this point, Tiny tells his fighter the fix is in. But it is too
late, Stoker's pride makes him want to win the fight, as he proceeds to
knock out Tiger.</P>
<P>Confronted in the dressing room by the gangsters, trapped alone in an
empty dark arena, as Tiny and Red have fled, the boxer runs into an
alley, where the gang beats him and breaks his hands with a brick so
that he'll never box again. This turns out to be a blessing in disguise
for Julie, who calls for an ambulance for her noble husband. She asks
his forgiveness for not attending the fight, then assures him that they
"both won tonight."</P>
<P>Ryan's performance gives this film the human drama the other great
boxing movies just couldn't deliver. His drive to win despite knowing
what that victory will ultimately mean and the noble way he handles
himself, provides this film with an insiders look into the boxer's
virile nature and the foolish pride he has in winning.</P>
<P>The Set-Up was one of the few films ever made in which narrative time
and screen time are the same-72 minutes. Wise brought in former boxing
professional John Indrisano to make sure the choreographed fight scenes
were realistic. Wise, striving for realism above all, visited the boxing
places around the Long Beach area, basing the boxing fans chosen for the
film on the same type of people he saw while attending those matches.</P>
