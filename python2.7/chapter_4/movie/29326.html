<PRE>ABERDEEN
A film review by Jeremiah Kipp
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Call it a road trip for the walking wounded.  Stellan Skarsgård plays
such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it's difficult to spend
nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly, boozed-out presence.  Yet
this ever-reliable Swedish actor adds depth and significance to the
otherwise plodding and forgettable Aberdeen, a sentimental and painfully
mundane European drama.</P>
<P>Playwright August Strindberg built his career on families and
relationships paralyzed by secrets, unable to express their longings
until the hour is far too late.  That's an accurate reflection of what
Aberdeen strives for, focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father,
Tomas (Skarsgård) and his alienated, openly hostile yuppie daughter,
Kaisa (Lena Headey, Gossip).  They haven't spoken in years, and wouldn't
even be making the long trip from Norway to Aberdeen, Scotland by
automobile if it weren't for Kaisa's mother (Charlotte Rampling, Under
the Sand) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer.</P>
<P>In a soap opera twist, mother has only a few days to live.  (Only in the
movies, right?)  Too blitzed to even step foot on a plane, Tomas hits
the open road with Kaisa.  Loathing each other all the while, they make
periodic stops for Tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out --
whenever he isn't muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be. 
Despite his sloshed viewpoint, Tomas recognizes that the apple hasn't
fallen very far from the tree.  Kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting
coke, sabotages her personal relationships through indifference, and is
unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper.  Ain't they a pair?</P>
<P>Unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note
and repetitively bitchy dialogue, screenwriters Kristin Amundsen and
Hans Petter Moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events
forward -- lost money, roving street hooligans looking for drunks to
kick around, nosy cops, and flat tires all figure into the schematic and
convenient narrative.  By the time they reach the hospital, it's time to
unveil the Secrets From A Dark Past that are not only simplistic devices
that trivialize the father-daughter conflict, they're also the mainstays
of many a bad Strindberg wannabe.  This revelation exists purely for its
own sake.  Aberdeen doesn't know where else to go.</P>
<P>Weak, unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of Kaisa.  If Lena
Headey were a stronger actress, perhaps Aberdeen could have been able to
coast on the performances and moody, haunting cinematography (rendering
Norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain
superior American indie flick intentional).  Headey's too busy acting,
using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of
insouciance.  If she were paying any attention to Skarsgård, maybe she'd
figure out that doing less can reveal so much more.</P>
<P>It's worthwhile to compare Aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001,
Jonathan Nossiter's captivating Signs & Wonders.  It's not just because
Skarsgård and Rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films
(they're not bound by ceremonial wedlock in Aberdeen).  The differences
in the way their characters were presented is significant.  In Aberdeen,
Rampling is a luminous diva, preening and static in her hospital bed. 
Despite Skarsgård's solid performance as Tomas, his pathetic drunk is
never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic
sorrow.  There's genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during
their understated confrontations in Signs & Wonders, allowing them to
suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and
years of stifled curiosity.</P>
<P>Nossiter's film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition
to delving into the Americanization of Greece and the use of mysticism
as an illusion to deflect pain.  If Signs & Wonders sometimes feels
overloaded with ideas, at least it's willing to stretch beyond what
we've come to expect from traditional drama.  Aberdeen is never half so
ambitious, content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other
movies.  When did character driven stories stop paying attention to the
complexities of real life?  The depressing answer can be found in
Lawrence Kasdan's trite but occasionally useful Grand Canyon, where
Steve Martin's Hollywood mogul pronounces, "All of life's riddles are
answered in the movies!"  Even foreign films are taking that advice to
heart.</P>
