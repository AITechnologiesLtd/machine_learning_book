<PRE>eview: Ever After: A Cinderella Story
Rating *** out of ****</PRE>
<P>     As fairy tales go, Cinderella has to be one of the most famous. Almost
everyone knows it, well at least in North America. So it is natural that
someone will try to make a movie out of it. It has been done before with
varying results. This version of the story is both similar to the original
and different at the same time. The basic story remains unchanged but,  one
thing that seems to vanish with this version, and that is all the
fantastical elements of the story. There is no fairy god mother or anything
even remotely of that nature. After the fantastical elements are stripped
away  what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the Cinderella
story and an interesting love story at the least. .</P>
<P> Unlike in the fairy tale, the prince plays a much larger part than just
that of  the masked ball at the end. The ‘Prince', who happens to be the
crown prince to the throne of France,  meets 'Cinderella', known as
Danielle,  on a few occasions, most coincidentally and he becomes smitten
with her. Although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it
allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative
story telling.. The story takes place in a renaissance setting;  in France,
with Leonardo Da Vinci providing some comic relief on more than one
occasion. This addition of Leonardo Da Vinci, was quite successful in that
it added some color to the movie, since some of the roles are a bit
stereotypical. For example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves
a few things to be desired. For instance the character seems to be a bit too
unstable and fickle, a crown prince should not be anything remotely like
that. Especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the
least and almost ready to take the throne.  The characters of
Danielle(Cinderella) played by Drew Barrymore, and that of the evil step
mother, played by Anjelica Huston, are well developed and well played by the
two women.  Although the part of Danielle is a bit stretched it is not too
unlikely and not totally unbelievable. The nuances of the character are
brought out well by Drew Barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like
she had fun making the movie. As a contrast the part of the evil step mother
is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique. But,  Anjelica
Huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie
nearly perfectly.</P>
<P>     The actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic
story of Cinderella, but there are more than enough twists in how the story
is told to make it interesting and enjoyable. The acting is of high caliber
and seems deserved of praise. All in all this movie takes you back into
history, into a seemingly magical fairy land. But, don't get me wrong there
is nothing but reality, it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not
based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening. So
although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not, and
that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion
makes it worth seeing</P>
