                       A film review by Zak Forsman
                        Copyright 1996 Zak Forsman</PRE>
<P>The Coen Brothers' latest film, FARGO is a combination of their earlier
works--specifically BLOOD SIMPLE and RAISING ARIZONA. I think what I'm
trying to say is that FARGO is at one moment hilarious and then sharply
horrifying. I've always had mixed feelings over violence on the movie
screen. When watching TAXI DRIVER I'd be thinking that it just wouldn't be
the same film without reaching that 'catharsis-through-urban-violence'
finale. On the other hand, I went to see ERASER and felt that the violence
there was indeed gratuitous. I had always felt that I was holding a double
standard until I realized that what makes violence gratuitous is the
integrity, or lack thereof, of the film exhibiting it. And in the case of
FARGO, I found myself disgusted and horrified at what I was seeing as
opposed to ERASER where aligators ripped arms from their sockets and the
effect on me was minimal.</P>
<P>FARGO, which claims to be based on actual events, is the story of a car
salesman (William H. Macy) who manifests a scheme to get nearly
one-million dollars in ransom money for the kidnapping of his own wife.
Her extremely wealthy, grumbling and growling father will be forced to
pay. The film unfolds as nearly everything goes terribly wrong--sometimes
funny, often frightening. We follow a pregnant police detective (Frances
McDormond) as she uncovers the case. I won't go any further in case you
haven't seen FARGO other than to tell you that I was skeptical as to how
involved her character could be considering her physical condition. Let me
tell you her character is well-engaged by the story and her involvment in
the climax/resolution is truly memorable.</P>
<P>The film's screenplay was written with extreme care for detail and
narrative verve, all too often absent from contemporary works. There are
times, and this is a good example, when it is obvious that this screenplay
had reached a final draft before principle photography was started. The
dialogue alone is so new and devoid of cliche that the audience is (and
this is rare) anticipating the characters' interaction instead of
predicting it. Even in so called 'talking heads' scenes, we are mentally
engaged by the film and certainly involved. Joel and Ethan Coen have
consistantly shown a talent for dialogue, storytelling and the ability to
integrate both into the film's visual elements. They are also one of the
few filmmakers with a signature--when you see a Coen Brothers film, you
know it.</P>
<P>Not one actor in the film would be considered by a studio executive to
headline a movie on their own. This is a cast of all those people you saw
in supporting roles in other films. William Macy (Oleanna, Homicide, ER)
performs flawlessly. He shapes his character so anxiously weak that we
both condemn his for his acts of cowardace and pity him for his lack of
social courage. Frances McDormond (Blood Simple, Raising Arizona) as the
pregnant police woman on the case has herself one of the most original
characters ever written. She is indeed quirky, and although quirkiness
does not neccessarily equal originality, McDormond grounds the character
in truly human qualities. Then there is Steve Buscemi (Reservoir Dogs,
Living in Oblivion) who's been doing similiar characters since his
supporting role in Martin Scorsese's short film, LIFE LESSONS, from the
film NEW YORK STORIES. Although his character in FARGO is not much
different, this time he does not come off as though he's playing for the
camera with the exception of a very funny, "total silence" monologue.
Buscemi seems to be making a career out of playing himself and this is
another of several films in which it works. Also, by the end of FARGO, his
character is so viciously frustrated that it mirrors the
hilarious/horrifying tone of the entire film.</P>
<P>The director, Joel Coen (Raising Arizona, Barton Fink) seems to have
matured a little--using his trademark wide angle lens with more reverance.
He saves his more visual shots for sequences in which they won't smother
the actors' performances and the story. If he sticks with it, I think he's
found a perfect balance. His best scene, I would say, is the triple
homicide sequence at night--part of which he borrowed from his own BLOOD
SIMPLE. I guess practice makes perfect.</P>
<P>Many people have been turned off by their own uncertainty as to whether to
laugh or cringe during this film. I know this was quite intentional and
would expect that the Coens take it as a compliment to their work to have
affected those people in such a manner. Anyway, FARGO is the best film
that's come out all year and I don't see anything coming in the future to
change that. It will certainly be nominated for Best Original Screenplay
if not Best Picture. I highly recommend you see FARGO. </P>
