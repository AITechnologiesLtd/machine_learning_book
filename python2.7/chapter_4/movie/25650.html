<PRE>High Fidelity </PRE>
<P>John Cusak stars in the adaption of the popular British novel about a broken 
hearted record store-owner
who spends most of the movie wondering why all his romantic relationships 
have failed to materialize his
whole life. Chicago is the backdrop to make the setting and characters more 
American-friendly but the
English style is ever present. </P>
<P>Think of it as a really mature Kevin Smith flick (but not TOO mature), 
there's tons of discussions analyzing
pop culture and music and relationships with an added dash of brash comedy 
and the like. The comedy and
the drama (the main plot about Cusak's recent break-up with his long-time 
girlfriend and his attempt to
win her back) balance nicely - so that you have one scene of serious human 
interaction and the next is
banter about "Top five side A's, track 1's." </P>
<P>It's a cute movie that has more to offer than the typical Hollywood romantic 
comedy. Probably one of the
best [first] date flicks to be released in a long time. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B+ </PRE>
