<P>REVIEW:  The Odd Couple II
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</P>
<P>Cast: Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Barnard Hughes, Christine Baranski,
Jonathan Silverman, Lisa Waltz
Director: Howard Deutch
Screenplay: Neil Simon
Australian Distributor: UIP</P>
<P>Australian theatrical release date: August 6 1998</P>
<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 stars</PRE>
<P>The addition of yet another Jack Lemmon-Walter Matthau combo film will
no doubt bring cheers from many and groans from some. I was optimistic:
the only Matthau-Lemmon films I had seen were Grumpy Old Men and its
sequel, and I enjoyed both.  Whilst The Odd Couple II is not
particularly fresh, funky or funny, it is nice to see these two
old-but-energetic actors up to their usual antics.</P>
<P>Reunited after many years, Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau
and Jack Lemmon) are the classic odd couple.  They find themselves on
the open road, and on the way to a wedding.  During their trip, Felix
and Oscar have all kinds of wacky adventures: their car explodes after
rolling off the side of a road, they become imprisoned three times for
three different reasons, and a mate of theirs dies whilst driving
possibly the world's slowest Rolls Royce.  If it could happen to anyone,
it happens to them.</P>
<P>Neil Simon has passively written the screenplay which, at times, is a
touch too simplistic and a lot too dependent on its main characters.
That is the best and the worst thing about the film - Lemmon and Matthau
are wonderful in their roles, but are given way too much screen time.
Thus, the gags and capers end up feeling cramped and forced, as there
are no other characters to lighten the load.  In the two Grumpy Old Men
films, we were not only treated to a terrifically cynical extra-old-man,
but also love interests for the two men.  This is something that is
severely lacking in Odd Couple II, and is most felt about three quarters
of the way through when we start to get a little tired of their
bickering.</P>
<P>But The Odd Couple II is never boring, never intimidating and never
patronizing.  I really got the feeling that I was there because I wanted
to be; and if you know what to expect, you're not likely to be
disappointed.  It's far from perfect - but it's far from boring.</P>
