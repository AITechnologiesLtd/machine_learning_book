Rated R: Language, sexuality</P>
<P>by Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>    This is one of those extremely rare cases in which I have actually
read the source text from which a film is based. Dickens' Great
Expectations was one of the books that I decided might be worth my time
in high school (though I was wary after David Copperfield). I was
pleasantly surprised by the novel, which I found to be an entertaining
and very insightful look into the growth of one young boy named Pip.</P>
<P>    The film version, for all who have not seen the preview, is a
modernization of the story. Finn is the name of the character, and he is
valiantly played by Ethan Hawke. The film opens in Florida and we are
introduced to Finn (as a child, played by Jeremy James Kissner) in the
famous scene with the escaped convict, played by Robert De Niro. Finn
brings the convict food out of the goodness of his heart, but the
convict is captured anyway. Later, we meet Finn's stepfather, Joe (Chris
Cooper); Finn helps Joe with his day-to-day labor, and it becomes clear
that, despite their lower-class living, they are at least somewhat
content with their lives.</P>
<P>    One day, Finn gets a call from the richest woman in Florida, Mrs.
Dinsmore (Ms. Havisham in the book); she wants Finn to come and
entertain her with his artistic talents. When he arrives at her home, he
finds an eccentric, possibly psychotic, woman (Anne Bancroft) who lives
in a great big, run-down house with her niece, Estella. The film takes
off from there, going through the many love battles between Estella and
Finn; Finn later ends up in New York as a successful artist, still
trying to win Estella's love.</P>
<P>    What I found most fascinating about the film is how close director
Alfonso Cuaron came to creating the same images that I pictured as I
read the book. Given that the book is from a different time period, I
find this amazing. The cinematography and production design are truly
striking, most notably in the scenes depicting Mrs. Dinsmore's lavishly
decadent home. The courtyard in front of the house, ornamented with
overgrown trees and vines; the rooms indoors, devoid of furniture but
full of empty space--the locations in this film feel detached from time,
as if we could look back on them in ten or thirty or one hundred years
and they will all be the same.</P>
<P>    I also think Hawke is the perfect choice to play Finn. Hawke has the
kind of strength that this character needs, and he is capable of letting
the audience know that a lot of what he does is just for show, that he
isn't as strong and sure of himself as he seems. Ironically, this
performance is not as powerful as I was expecting. The scenes in which
he is drawing Estella are very well-done; sometimes, however, when he
gets into situations in which he has to speak softly and be subtle, he
drops the ball and makes some lines sound silly.</P>
<P>    Gwyneth Paltrow plays Estella as an adult, and she does a great job
in the role (though I pictured the character to look entirely
different). I could see how some may say that she's one-dimensional, and
often purely cruel, but Paltrow conveys just the right amount of inner
torture, and it becomes clear that what she does to Finn is not out of
spite, but out of habit. Supporting performances from Anne Bancroft,
Chris Cooper, Hank Azaria, and Robert De Niro are all unique and
colorful, and add a lot of life to the film.</P>
<P>    Like all films, this one is not perfect. I wouldn't say that it
doesn't live up to the book, because I think in many ways it does. What
the film does that doesn't feel quite right is that it centers far too
much on the relationship between the characters and not enough on just
what Finn is doing and thinking in his life. It gets almost repetitive
at times, and I found myself saying, "Okay, so he's going to get screwed
again here," and I nearly became detached from the story a couple times.</P>
<P>    There are some truly brilliant scenes, though. My favorite in the
film is probably the one in which Finn storms into a restaurant,
approaches Estella, and says, "Would you like to dance?" with her
fiancée sitting right there. After dancing for a few seconds, he takes
her outside in the rain and they share a moment of passion--followed by
sex, of course.</P>
<P>    Great Expectations is thick on atmosphere and character, and in the
end I found it to be an effective film. Unlike the cinematic tragedy of
William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, Cuaron has successfully updated a
classic tale, and, despite a few flaws in content and story
concentration, the result is an intelligent, insightful picture that
both fans of the book and those not familiar with it can enjoy.</P>
