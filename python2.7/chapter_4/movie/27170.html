<P>     Over twenty years into a ridiculously successful film career, Mel
Gibson chose 2000 to do a pure comedy for the first time  and it seems
terribly unfair that he appears so good at it. Gibson has always had
tremendous charm on screen, and his light touch provided most of the best
moments in the LETHAL WEAPON series, but he has shied away from roles that
showcased those elements of his personality. In WHAT WOMEN WANT, he never
once picks up a gun of any kind. He picks up a hairdryer, and he still
kills. Mel Gibson delivers a wonderfully entertaining comic performance in
WHAT WOMEN WANT, the kind of performance that should make for classic
comedy.</P>
<P>     We'll forgive Gibson on grounds of inexperience for not choosing the
sort of script that could show off his newfound comic chops. WHAT WOMEN
WANT, a film that could have been GROUNDHOG DAY brilliant, comes out
merely adequate thanks to a script that's about two re-writes away from
being ready. Gibson stars as Nick Marshall, a divorced Chicago advertising
executive, man's man and career chauvinist. Nick expects to be promoted to
creative director, but his boss (Alan Alda) instead opts to bring in Darcy
Maguire (Helen Hunt) to provide the sensitivity to women's concerns Nick
clearly lacks. Then a twist of fate -- and an electric shock -- endows
Nick with the ability to hear women's thoughts. It's a gift Nick fears at
first, until he realizes he can use it to his advantage in any number of
ways, including undermining Darcy.</P>
<P>     WHAT WOMEN WANT is a gimmick movie, which can easily turn into an
empty marketing-friendly concept without some competent execution. In Mel
Gibson, they have a more than competent star to execute that gimmick. Mel
knocks out every twist of character and goofy situation he's handed, from
the swagger of the opening scenes to his broader physical gags to his
quiet moments with Hunt. He sells the humor in a macho guy both playing
sensitive and actually becoming sensitive. It's not jaw-dropping film
acting by any means, but it's so deft with the fluffy material that you'd
think he'd been doing it all his life.</P>
<P>     I wish the same could be said of the writers. At over two hours, WHAT
WOMEN WANT is a textbook example of a film with no sense of its story's
essential elements. There's a lengthy, unnecessary prologue
psychoanalyzing Nick's relationship with his Vegas showgirl mother;
there's a lengthy scene of Nick dancing in his apartment to Frank Sinatra;
there's an encounter between Nick and a therapist that exists only for the
sake of a distracting cameo. Supporting characters pack the fringes of
every frame, giving Nick sub-plots with a suicidal co-worker, his teenage
daughter (Ashley Johnson), and a high-strung coffee shop cashier (Marisa
Tomei). There's hardly a scene in WHAT WOMEN WANT that doesn't feel like
it should either be a minute shorter or absent altogether. Instead of
making all the necessary plot and character points efficiently the first
time, screenwriters Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa opt to make the same
point multiple times, just so we don't miss it.</P>
<P>     There are definitely some worthwhile individual moments to make up
for the sloppy structure. Some of them are pure script moments, like the
internal monologue Nick hears while trying to show off his sexual prowess.
Others are combinations of script and performance, like Gibson's drunken
experimentation with a number of women's products. And many of them are
purely showcases for the actors -- including Hunt, who tames her patrician
chilliness and delivers her most engaging big screen comic performance.
This is really a star vehicle, though, and if it provides any enjoyment,
it's from the pleasure of watching a macho man have so much fun doing
something he's never done before. Give credit to director Nancy Meyers for
finding this performance in Mel Gibson. Give credit to Mel Gibson for
finding this performance in himself. And next time, let's hope we can give
him credit for picking better material.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 playful weapons:  6.</PRE>
