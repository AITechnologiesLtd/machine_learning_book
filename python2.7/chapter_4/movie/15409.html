<PRE>Non-threatening `Enemy of the State'
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>I have a friend who works for the NSA, a pseudo-government agency
that, from the looks of this film, has the ability to shadow your life
without you ever really knowing it.  Whenever I ask him what he does
there, he can only reply, `pretty cool stuff.'  I guess that if he
actually did any of the things that was depicted in the film, it would
be ‘classified' as pretty cool.  Apparently, they can hear your
cellular phone conversations, access your bank statements, and put you
under the watchful eyes of hidden cameras 24 hours a day.  Privacy no
longer exists if the NSA enters your life.  As the watchdog for our
beloved citizens, their powers could get pretty scary if they had more
authority to initiate wire taps and other methods of surveillance. 
And that's what Director Reynolds (Jon Voight) seems to want.  To
promote his ‘the-NSA-must-know-all' philosophy, he will use every
means possible, including the execution of a key congressman and any
other ‘enemy' that stands in his way.</P>
<P>Unbeknownst to Robert Dean (Will Smith), he has been labeled an enemy
when sensitive information is passed on to him.  He doesn't even know
that he possesses this information, but soon becomes the target of a
massive manhunt.  Hiding is virtually impossible.  They bug his house
and make use of an eye-popping number of surveillance equipment, while
a platoon of agents discretely follow the lawyer wherever he goes.  
Steps are taken to discredit him by manipulating the media.  They also
make it difficult for him to escape by, among other things, canceling
all of his credit cards.</P>
<P>Why is everyone chasing him?  What secrets does he possess which
causes the NSA to invade his life?  He meets up Brill (Gene Hackman),
an unlikely ally with an enigmatic background.  He is a former NSA
operative and can help Dean stay ahead of them as well as help him
find the answers to his questions.</P>
<P>While "Enemy" is more-or-less suspenseful and showy, if you strip away
the techno-babble and the Morse code-like sound effects whenever
satellites are being repositioned, you basically have a conventional
manhunt.  Will Smith is reliably affable as a man looking for answers,
who has to rely on help from questionable sources as well as enjoy a
little bit of luck.  And I enjoyed Hackman as the bitter recluse who
understood all too well about how the government stealthfully lives
among us.  But consider this film more of a message rather than a high
octane vehicle that pushes its way from one scene to another.  How
much of our own constitutional freedoms are individuals willing to
give up for the sake of national security?   Maybe the State is its
own worst enemy.</P>
