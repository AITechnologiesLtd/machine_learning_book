<PRE>STIGMATA (1999)
Directed by Rupert Wainright
Review ©1999 Scott J. Promish</PRE>
<P>If nothing else, STIGMATA stands as the first Frank Mancuso, Jr. production
I've seen that wasn't just plain awful.  His previous record includes the
SPECIES films, BODY PARTS, COOL WORLD, and several FRIDAY THE 13TH sequels
which I haven't seen but could probably make an educated guess at.</P>
<P>This film at least has an air of quality about it: good actors (well,
Gabriel Byrne *was* also in COOL WORLD -- probably not something he's very
proud of), polished direction, and nothing in the script that caused me to
groan.  Its flaws only become apparent when you try to make sense of the
thing.</P>
<P>Hairdresser, clubrat and atheist Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) is
relaxing in her bath when she is suddenly gripped by a violent attack.  She
is rushed to the hospital, gushing blood from wounds that go all the way
through her wrists.  After an later incident on a subway during which her
back is lashed by an unseen force, the church becomes involved and sends a
scientist-priest named Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) to investigate the
phenomena.  The plot thickens when Father Kiernan discovers a conspiracy
involving the Catholic church and an ancient, lost scripture.</P>
<P>Like most stories whose premise revolves around religious phenomena,
STIGMATA falls apart under even the most casual examination.  It's hard to
discuss without spoiling the ending but I can say that what we finally learn
is the cause of Frankie's experiences does not explain them at all.  Why the
wounds, why the visions, why the violent outbursts?  Said ending is a
disappointment, and the `revelation' is a bit of gospel that even someone
with minimal knowledge of Christianity will find familiar, especially since
it is recited more than once previously in the course of the film.  The
conspiracy theme was handled much better -- albeit without the supernatural
element -- in THE NAME OF THE ROSE (1986).</P>
<P>The modern, techno soundtrack (composed by Smashing Pumpkin Billy Corgan and
which also features songs by Massive Attack, David Bowie and Afro Celt Sound
System) is an interesting contrast to a film in which one would expect to
hear symphonics.</P>
<P>It's a shame that a film that comes off so nicely otherwise is brought down
by careless storytelling.  In the end, STIGMATA is mildly enjoyable; just
take in the sights and sound and don't think about it.</P>
