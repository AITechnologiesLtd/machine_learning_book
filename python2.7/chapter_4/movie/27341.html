<P>_An_Everlasting_Piece_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>If for nothing else, young actor Barry McEvoy certainly earns points for
finding a new and unusual way of addressing the oft-explored issue of the
Northern Ireland Catholic/Protestant conflict in his script for
_An_Everlasting_Piece_.  Fortunately, there is more to savor in Barry
Levinson's film of McEvoy's script--though those charms aren't quite
enough to take this modest comedy over the top.</P>
<P>Interestingly enough, the term "over the top" is one that really cannot
be applied to the film, a fairly surprising fact given its wacky premise.
 Sometime in Belfast during the 1980s, Colm (McEvoy) and George (Brían F.
O'Byrne)--a Catholic and a Protestant, respectively--meet on the job as
barbers in a mental hospital and become fast friends.  When they learn
that a recently admitted patient aptly nicknamed "the Scalper" (Billy
Connolly) was the only toupee salesman serving all of Northern Ireland,
Colm and George see an opportunity to make it big as his piece-pushing
replacements.  That's easier said than done, for the newly-christened
"Piece People" (as Colm and George come to call themselves) aren't the
only team with the same idea--emerging from nowhere are the equally
enterprising but superior salesmen operating under the eyecatching name
Toupee or Not Toupee.</P>
<P>Colm and George's biggest obstacle, however, ultimately proves to be
their differing religions.  That fact may not be an issue to them or
their families, but it's the only one to the Irish Republican Army,
namely one member (Colum Convey) with whom the pair come into close
contact.  It's a credit to McEvoy and Levinson that the film smoothly
slides from light laughs to heavier material without a hint of
awkwardness.  Also contributing greatly is the cast of mostly fresh
faces, who are adept at handling both the comic and the dramatic.  More
than holding her own with the instantly likable pair of McEvoy and
O'Byrne is the delightful Anna Friel, who makes Colm's girlfriend Bronagh
as smart as she is spunky and sexy.</P>
<P>Despite the cast's considerable charm, _An_Everlasting_Piece_ still
falls short of the mark.  McEvoy, while displaying promise as a writer,
is at this point more skilled with his acting instrument than he is with
a pen.  His lively sense of humor makes for a number of amusing
sequences, but sometimes these scenes are inconsequential diversions;
case in point, a broad scene where Colm's mother mistakes a stranger
sleeping outside the house for his younger brother.  Also, the character
of the Scalper is rather clunkily kept in the action far longer than
necessity requires, sticking around for no real payoff.</P>
<P>Now and again, though, McEvoy serves up some pointedly, sometimes
absurdly, funny moments, such as Colm and George's initial encounter with
the IRA man; and his passionate concern over the Northern Ireland issue
shines through.  Similarly apparent in _An_Everlasting_Piece_ are the
high spirits with which all involved approached the project, making this
easygoing entertainment that more impossible to hate.  It's unfortunate,
then, that some shortcomings also make this undeniably likable and
sometimes lively film difficult to completely embrace.</P>
