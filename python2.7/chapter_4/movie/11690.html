<P>Some day in  Afghanistan,  when they start showing films again and import
"Primary Colors," most viewers will make neither heads or tails of it.
Perhaps a mere handful of Afghans will see it as a movie on the Clintons.
More, but still few viewers --never mind the sty in their eye --will think
it is about the corrupt American electoral system and its strategies.</P>
<P>It would be good if the American public could appreciate the movie both as
Clintonesque and as a kind of docu-drama of our politics, instead of the
just the former, which is the majority perception.</P>
<P>The fact is that "Primary Colors" is the filmization of the eponymous novel
by former Newsweek writer Joe Klein, published with "Anonymous" as the
author. Klein, immediately suspected, at first denied, eventually 'fessed
up.</P>
<P>The book was a "roman a clef," (which means "a novel with a key" in
French), the kind that shows historical facts and real people but disguised
as fiction. The fiction is generally tricky so that the readers have to
solve puzzles of identification.  The faithful (with some excisions) movie
version is a "film a clef," but both incarnations are so transparent that
they're not really very clef.</P>
<P>John Travolta plays the Democratic Governor of an unnamed Southern State.
His nom-de-film is Jack Stanton, Jack as in Kennedy, Stanton as in Clinton.
He is running in the Presidential primaries. His wife Susan (Emma Thompson)
is at his side, and she's a damn good campaigner and adviser. To Stanton's
staff --initially one of dedicated amateurs --is added the young idealist
Henry Burton who wants to be part of history, and about whose late
grandfather (someone like Martin Luther King) everyone gushes.  Stantonites
include spin-doctor southerner Richard Jemmons, cute Daisy Green,
troubleshooter-fixer Libby Holden, and others.</P>
<P>Jack and Susan are "constructed" to look and sound as humanly as possible
like Bill and Hillary Clinton.  Henry Burton, an African American, is
derived from George Stephanopoulos (and played by a Brit) --a clever move
because Stephanopoulos is  Greek-American, hence, in terms of politics, a
member of a minority,  and Henry is also a member of a minority. Even more
than Stephanopoulos, he reinforces the aura of an all-inclusive, non-racist
entourage. (It also helps to get more black votes, of course). As Jemmons,
Billy Bob Thornton is a projection of James Carville. And so on, down the
line.</P>
<P>The film's opening is an inspired, funny visual and aural essay on the
variety of hand-shakes the Governor uses. It would stand by itself as a
prize-winning short. Then the portrait of Jack is expanded, amplified and
constantly added to. The man is a consummate politico who can pretend,
manipulate, cajole, inspire, move, cheat, you name it, he can do it.</P>
<P>In his first dramatic appearance, in a New York school where he encourages
minority adults to get an education, Stanton follows the sad tale of a
black man whom illiteracy has seriously damaged, raptly and with swelling
tear ducts.  He segues with the heartbreaking story of his own uncle, a
Congressional Medal of Honor winner who refused all school scholarships or
civilian offers, because--that was his shameful secret-- he too was
illiterate. Jack concludes with a moving and realistic paean of education.</P>
<P>Now here's a candidate who knows how to listen, who has sensible ideas, who
understands the hurt of others. But hold on! The uncle yarn will turn  out
to be pure invention. Hold on again ! If quick-change artist Stanton  can
lie like, well, a politician, he can also feel for other people. That's
what makes Jack such a complex, multi-layered fellow, and that's what the
movie captures with amazing accuracy. This goes well beyond the simple
Jekyll-Hyde transformation and into a far more devious and complicated
character.</P>
<P>Jack has the searching eye of a ladies' man eye and a high level of
testosterone. In his case as in others, those traits can be inseparable
from other talents. It's one big ball of wax. I wager that the name "Jack"
was chosen to evoke JFK, not only for  fast-thinking one one's feet but for
sexual shenanigans too.</P>
<P>Just being next to Stanton flusters so much the New York teacher who hosted
the meeting that she keeps stumbling on stairs. She later comes out of
Jack's bedroom, while the Governor does not even blink as his helpers,
assembled in the hotel suite, watch her exit. Nerves of steel? Nerve? Both.</P>
<P>The complexity, which extends to most other aspects of the movie, makes
"Titanic" look like child's play, save for the specials effects. The "PC"
director and writer are the once famous cabaret-type duo of Nichols and May
who, separated for years, were reunited on the stage, then for the film
"The Birdcage." Both are devilishly talented.</P>
<P>I bet they hurried to finish "PC" while the Presidential hubbub was at its
then-apex. I also bet that they wished the film could have come out in the
Fall of 1998, since that's when the likeliest Oscar candidates will be
released. While at today's date (late March 1998), "PC" leads the pack by
light-years, the memory of voting Academy members almost always disfavors
pre-summer releases.</P>
<P>Back to Henry, who is inducted in Jack's ranks in a whirlwind recruitment.
In "PC" we follow everyone, but it is Henry whom we watch as the nearly
always present thread, and as though he were the chorus of an ancient Greek
play. It is his actions, observations, reactions and reactions to reactions
that make us, the audience, identify with this decent, able and likable
young man. Henry takes us everywhere, to the mechanisms, agonies and
ecstasies of campaigning, including the New Hampshire primary that ends
with Jack in second place (to general jubilation) well after the story's
mid-point.</P>
<P>Much, if not most of the plot deals with the staff having to counter
rumors, accusations or sometimes deliberate lies, and what seems to be a
severe case of satyriasis (that's the Don Juan syndrome, the male
equivalent of nymphomania).  Among them is a phone call that incriminates
Jack as he talks sex with a hairdresser deliciously named Cashmere McLeod.
To the rescue comes gun-toting old pal Libby (Kathy Bates) who seems to
know everything and everyone and is wise to the Age of Electronics. More, I
cannot divulge.</P>
<P>The movie is fast, elliptical, humorous, amusing. It is also raunchy in
speech, acts and behavior. As a farce, it is amoral, immoral, cynical and
very funny. As an expose of political animals it has wild moments and
touching moments. It peeks with savvy into the exhausting process of
running for office, the higher the office, the more killing the effort.</P>
<P>It pulls no punches, but understands Jack Stanton, warts and all. There's a
magnificent night scene, the culmination of the collaboration between
director, writer, set designer and the master cinematographer Michael
Ballhaus. The camera pulls in doughnut-fancier Jack sitting across the
street in a glassed in a doughnut shop, chatting with true sympathy and
empathy with the lone, gimpy  employee. It's a rare, quiet interlude, an
Edward Hopper moment of isolation,  except that Jack's presence promises
some hope for the proletarian employee. It is also a moving moment of
epiphany for Stanton. And it justifies another scene: as Billy Bob is
quitting his job (he'll come back), he takes his leave of Henry, asks him
to stick with Jack. "This one's worth it."</P>
<P>A speech to laid-off workers, from the heart and with no b.s. is as good as
anything Frank Capra ever did, and far more believable. Events that involve
talk-show hosts Larry King, Charlie Rose, Geraldo Rivera, Bill Maher (as
themselves), or  Rob Reiner (as Izzy Rosenblatt), keep hitting the mark.
The Reiner episode catalyzes changes that will affect Jack's rival
candidate. This sets in motion a crazy yet believable chain that ends up
involving ex-Florida Governor Picker (Larry Hagman), who is the soul of
decency --but has a secret.</P>
<P>Hagman underacts with admirable control, at the opposite pole of his famous
"Dallas" performances on TV. Which brings me to the performers. They are a
superb (and superbly cast) cast. As Susan Stanton, Emma Thompson has a
number of choice scenes with terse and fast dialogue as well as reactions.
She is attractive, at times seductive, even sexy. Henry is endearing. Libby
is a great, bossy, volcanic strategist with pit bull determination, yet I
have a feeling that her part is a bit overdone, not in acting but in her
skills. Nor am I too convinced by the final episode that concerns Libby.
(No, I won't give it away. This is, after all, also a political thriller).</P>
<P>Then there's Travolta, that Lazarus of actors who came back from the dead
with "Pulp Fiction." He does very well, yet if you expect a total
impersonation of Bill Clinton you simply won't get it. You might have, in a
stage-play. But in a film, with its merciless close-ups, Travolta can only
be a semi-Clinton.</P>
<P>There's common agreement that the real President is as smart as they come,
a well-educated thinker-doer. I'm not swayed by his Rhodes scholarship
since many scholars, even famous ones, are really duds. Still, the real
Clinton leaves no doubts about his native intelligence.</P>
<P>Travolta can be a very fine actor. He gives a striking, cunning
performance, but he cannot change his spots. If you don't allow Jack his
very own personality; if you concentrate on the Clinton/Stanton parallels
to the detriment of the bigger picture; if you search for convincing
Clintonisms, no matter what Travolta does, he does not exactly radiate with
brains. In any case, directors and witers have to be intelligent, but
thespians don't, so long as they have talent. There's no denying that a
person with Jack's characteristics could be a Governor or President. Or
become a Hollywood star.</P>
