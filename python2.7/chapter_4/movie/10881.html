<PRE>WISHMASTER</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: ** (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>Live / 1:30 / 1997 / R (gore, gore, gore, gore, gore, language)
Cast: Tammy Lauren; Andrew Divoff; Robert Englund; Tony Todd; Wendy 
Benson; Tony Crane; Jenny O'Hara; Kane Hodder 
Director: Robert Kurtzman 
Screenplay: Peter Atkins </P>
<P>The horror ... the horror. The horror of a horror film with no sense of 
horror. That statement would perfectly sum up "Wishmaster" were it not 
for one thing -- the movie's so laughably ludicrous that sitting through 
it is almost no chore at all. Don't go expecting legitimate thrills and 
chills, or you'll be quite disappointed; the words "Wes Craven Presents" 
have been plopped over the title in an attempt to get people buzzing 
about this hammy howler. The "Scream" director only serves as an 
executive producer here, but his reputation should remain intact after 
"Wishmaster" flops -- Craven has "Scream 2" scheduled for release this 
winter. </P>
<P>"Wishmaster" tells what happens when the gem-imprisoned Djinn (Andrew 
Divoff), sort of like Barbara Eden's evil mutant uncle, gets unwittingly 
released into modern society by a geologist named Alexandra (Tammy 
Lauren). Djinn gets his kicks by manipulating mortals to wish for all 
the usual stuff (everlasting life, vengeance against one's enemies), and 
then turning their requests against them in devious ways. An example: 
Djinn transforms a Structure salesgirl into a mannequin after she 
requests eternal beauty. If he can get three wishes out of Alexandra, 
then an army of Djinns will be released to take over the world. Or 
something like that. </P>
<P>If "Wishmaster" wasn't so unintentionally hilarious, it'd probably be a 
long, wooden bore. But there are so many scenes, situations and scares 
with the exact opposite effect than intended that the viewing experience 
is packed with many a hearty laugh. The gore is so frequent and macabre 
that it's downright hysterical -- one guy takes a mace in the head, and 
his cranium bears a large indent that'd be completely believable were he 
in a Warner Bros. cartoon. A jewel appraiser asks the Djinn to make him 
rich, so the plane carrying his wealthy mother explodes in take-off. And 
when an Ancient Persian party-thrower wishes for things to kick into 
high gear in the movie's grisly prologue, the guests begin tearing their 
own flesh off! Talk about killing the livelihood. Sheesh. </P>
<P>In the movie's production notes, the filmmakers guess that Djinn "could 
very well be one of the greatest horror figures of our time." Um, I 
don't think so -- he's not particularly frightening, but he is annoying. 
For some reason, Divoff insists on pronouncing his wannabe-scary lines 
phonetically ("Lis-ten to the mu-sic of their souls, Al-ex-an-dra!"). 
After you laugh and laugh and laugh at Wishmaster, you realize something 
sad -- the ideas here ain't half bad. If Djinn was a truly horrifying 
monster, if we were given a better protagonist than the annoying 
Alexandra, if there was a real story amidst the massive blood-letting, 
"Wishmaster" could have been a success. As it stands, it's strictly for 
bad movie buffs who couldn't get enough involuntary guy-puking from 
"Event Horizon."</P>
