<PRE>                                   GUN CRAZY
                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Anita (Drew Barrymore) is on the fast track to nowhere, staring her
own self-destruction in the face.  Abandoned by the mother whose
boyfriend she lives with and is sexually abused by, Anita is looking for
a way out.  She finds it through Howard (James LeGros), an ex-convict
that she becomes pen-pals with.  After his release from prison, the two
get together and find that their bond goes deeper than a mutual love of
guns.</P>
<P>     GUN CRAZY, while sharing the title and some of the themes of the
1949 Joseph H.  Lewis film that inspired it, is less a remake than a
re-interpretation.  The mood and tone remain constant, but the
characters and their relationships have been modernized.</P>
<P>     Distilled to its essence, GUN CRAZY is a love story.  Admittedly,
this isn't the kind of nice, romantic film that the audience can sit
through content to know that everything will turn out all right in the
end.  Equally, the formulas of the traditional romance are out the
window.  GUN CRAZY is unapologetically bizarre in its treatment of the
relationship between Anita and Howard.  In some ways, it's reminiscent
of what exists between Lula and Sailor in David Lynch's WILD AT HEART.</P>
<P>     The biggest negative about GUN CRAZY is a tendency toward
self-parody.  There are several instances during the movie when
circumstances become too outlandish to be believed.  A case in point is
that of a church service held by Hank (Billy Drago) that goes far beyond
the usual interpretation of a revivalist religious ceremony.  Even the
most ridiculous elements of this over-the-top scene have been left
intact in the final print of the movie.</P>
<P>     This film is not particularly concerned about getting all the
details right, either.  Some of the events of GUN CRAZY stretch the
limits of credibility.  While few of these slips are glaring, it will be
apparent even to a casual viewer that the script is not air-tight.</P>
<P>     The most fascinating element of GUN CRAZY is how it develops the
character of Anita.  The casting of Drew Barrymore in the role might at
first seem odd, but she does an excellent job playing an
affection-starved youth.  For Anita, sex is something she uses in a
fruitless effort to be liked.  Her mother has abandoned her and her
mother's boyfriend, with whom she lives, cares about her only when he
needs a woman.  That she happens to fall in love with Howard is a quirk
of fate.  She would have fallen in love with anyone - he just happens to
be in the right place at the right time.</P>
<P>     Anita initially learns to fire a gun so that she will have
something in common with Howard when he gets out of prison.  Later, the
particular gun that she learns with, and guns in general, take on
greater significance.  In many ways, because of Howard's sexual
impotence, they become a surrogate for sex in the relationship.  As
Anita puts it, sex was never anything special to her, but firing guns
is.  She'd rather shoot with Howard than sleep with him.</P>
<P>     At first glance, GUN CRAZY might appear to be a shallow
exploitation film, complete with low budget and little-known actors.
That it was shown on Showtime before getting theatrical release serves
only to further tarnish its image.  However, beneath the surface, this
movie has surprisingly deep currents, with characters and relationships
that are complex.  GUN CRAZY certainly isn't for everyone, but anyone
who has a taste for twisted love stories will find something here to
savor.</P>
