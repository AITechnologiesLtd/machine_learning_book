<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>Although this is considered one of Luis Bunuel's masterpieces, it really
isn't.  But it is, unlike many of his films, one of the easiest films to
follow along, and enjoy, something that some of his earlier films were not
easy to do with, and later, one wondered if we had missed out on a new style
of novel'ing a film....</P>
<P>And there are many reasons for that. It is filmed in glorious color, which
Luis Bunuel had just at the time started working with ( 1966 ) and it is
gloriously, and carefully, photographed for the best effect.  And it is
impeccably designed and written to get the most out of the main character,
though the novel itself is more pointy towards the  class divisions and
their life. The interesting notion, is that this film is one of the best
known of Bunuel's films in America, and was the one chosen to be touched up
and re-released. It is far less important a piece of work, as LOS OLVIDADOS,
or EL ANGEL EXTERMINADOR, or THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE.</P>
<P>In this story, Severine ( Catherine Deneuve ) is the wife of a well to do
man, but their marriage seems to be not inspired.  She is bored.  And in the
process of meeting a friend she finds out that many wives of her  stature
sometimes visit a house or two and participate in some extra curricular
activities outside the marriage.  Severine, decides that she  will try that,
in the hope that it will eventually spark something in her own marriage, it
is presumed, although, it also appears that the whole thing may start out as
a bit of curiosity.</P>
<P>Severine had inquired from her husband wether he had been to one of those
houses and he admits that he had, and his answer is vague, and by all
intents rather vulgar for Severine.  The suggestion is immediately made that
the main reason why they just do not have an active, or interesting,
marriage, is because they just do not seem to enjoy each other's company
very much.  She seems to go along with him, and he is polite enough that he
does not force his wife ( a trend in many Bunuel films ), an unusual bit,
which suggests that he is also participating in some extra curricular
activities of his own.</P>
<P>In the process of being a part of the various customers she comes to meet,
during the afternoons, she ends up liking one man, who is becoming attached
to her, and she to him, despite the fact that he
is a shady character.  And when he realizes that he can not win her over at
all, he decides to take the whole thing in his own hands.  He waits for the
husband and shoots him, and eventually he gets shot by a policeman and
Severine is now taking care of her husband.</P>
<PRE>And this is the easy part of this film.</PRE>
<P>The hard part, is how it is filmed, and how Luis Bunuel gets into his
characters' mind.  The film is full of bits and pieces inside Severine's
head ( this is  a famous Bunuel trademark ) and we constantly see how she
sees things, or at least how she feels about them.  All is well here, until
the resolution of the film.  Her husband is better, and finally gets out of
his wheelchair, only to have Severine get distracted by
the sound of a carriage on the road, outside their mansion.  And the film
closes.</P>
<P>Luis Bunuel, through out his career of film making, had always entered into
any of his characters' mind, and show us how they thought.  And then we see
how they react, maybe based on their thinking.  The fact that we see that
these characters rarely do what they feel, is probably Luis Bunuel's
greatest comment in any of his films.  We know how Severine feels, but her
excitement seems to derive from a completely different feeling which her
husband does not provide.  Be it forced, or demanded, she responds.  But
given her chance, she tends to be shy and not take any initiative in her
personal enjoyment.</P>
<P>This style of filming, which is not well used nowadays, has almost  been
forgotten, and considering that this film is now thirty years old, it is
quite amazing how well his style survives today, in a world of fast paced
films, that do not have half the depth that Luis Bunuel comes up with in a
few minutes.  It all appears in front of us, so immediate, and so ready to
show us another feeling inside a character. By comparison, American film
making tends to use exposition, to show us these things, and then pretty
much tells us, with hints, what the most likely result is going to be.  Luis
Bunuel, himself, does not make judgements about what he thinks, or how his
characters will do.... they just do, and the result is always open for us to
figure out what it all means, and most likely -- my feeling -- to come up
with a way that forces an audience to make a judgement and decision for
themselves, rather than preach.... and this from a man who was brought up in
a monastery of Dominican Friars.</P>
<P>If you have never seen a Luis Bunuel film, take a plunge.  While they are
phenomenally well written, they also make for outstanding thinking pieces,
that never let up.  His style is smooth, and specially well thought out.
Never showy, never judgemental.  Just let the characters live, and watch the
details... sometimes they are important. In later years, Luis Bunuel became
a bit more unusual, and one of his last films ( Le Phamtome de Liberte --
The Phantom of Liberty ) appears quite disjointed with the exception of a
theme that repeats itself, in this case, freedom is an illusion, because
someone is always around to ruin it in some way.  I am pretty sure that many
times he felt this way about his films, when they were constantly being
criticized by the catholic church, and other institutions for their endless
attack on the hypocrisy that many of his characters partake in.  But, unlike
many directors, this man has a soft spot for people's errors, and their
decisions.... and he makes the best, and fullest, out of these moments with
a camera... an exceptional film maker, that rarely made a bad film, and they
are all unusual and truly enjoyable to watch....</P>
<PRE>A must see, for serious film lovers.</PRE>
<P>Should also catch THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, THAT OBSCURE
OBJECT OF DESIRE, THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL, EL ( THIS SECRET PASSION ),
VIRIDIANA, TRISTANA, and just about anything he did. If you ever get a
chance catch his version of Robinson Crusoe... magnificent. And the early
Mexican comedies are very funny and totaly off the wall confusing stories.</P>
