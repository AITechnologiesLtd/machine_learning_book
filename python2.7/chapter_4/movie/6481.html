<P>     It won't be difficult for many viewers to accept Denzel Washington as
a character sent straight from heaven...particularly female viewers.
Washington has been a regular on "sexiest man" lists, dazzling audiences
with his confident smile while building an impressive body of work in
roles characterized by intensity, integrity and -- frequently --
inscrutability.  Yet for all his obvious talent and good looks, he has
often seemed unapproachable on screen, so cool that he fails to be warm.
THE PREACHER'S WIFE comes as a welcome addition to Washington's resume, a
somewhat predictable holiday confection buoyed by Washington's engaging
lead performance.</P>
<P>     THE PREACHER'S WIFE is set in an inner city New York neighborhood,
where local Baptist minister Henry Biggs (Courtney B. Vance) is facing a
personal crisis.  Confronted by financial problems in the church and
social problems in the community which seem beyond his ability to change,
Henry drives himself relentlessly, to the point of neglecting his wife
Julia (Whitney Houston) and son Jeremiah (Justin Pierre Edmond).  Finally
Henry asks for help from above, and he gets it in the form of Dudley
(Washington), a rookie angel thrilled to be back on earth.  Henry
naturally has difficulty believing this insistent fellow is divine,
especially when Dudley begins spending quality time with Julia and
Jeremiah, forcing Henry to consider his priorities more carefully.</P>
<P>     A remake of the 1947 Cary Grant-Loretta Young-David Niven vehicle THE
BISHOP'S WIFE is a natural notion for a spiritually renewed era when
angels are appearing on television ("Touched by an Angel") and in the
movies (the upcoming MICHAEL) faster than they can dance on the head of a
pin.  It is equally natural to expect a certain amount of holy-rolling in
such an effort, but THE PREACHER'S WIFE does a fairly good job of walking
the fine line between sincere and sanctimonious.  Penny Marshall (BIG,
AWAKENINGS) has shown herself to be that rare contemporary director who
can make a "feel-good" film which doesn't leave you feeling insulted, and
she generally avoids saccharine overload.  There is a bright good humor to
most of THE PREACHER'S WIFE which makes it possible to overlook such
manipulations as the fate of an adorable orphan and a conflict with a
nasty real estate developer (Gregory Hines, discovering a new career as a
heavy after this film and Marshall's 1994 RENAISSANCE MAN).</P>
<P>     The major problem with THE PREACHER'S WIFE is the same problem which
has characterized most of Marshall's films:  it's just too long.  Her
movies have a tendency to run out of gas with a lot of film left to run,
and THE PREACHER'S WIFE could have benefited from plenty of additional
editing.  Much of it could have come from Whitney Houston's performance,
which consists largely of finding reasons to break into song like Elvis
Presley in one of his carefully crafted vehicles.  Houston certainly has a
spectacular voice, and it is nice to hear her using it for gospel
standards rather than dreary ballads, but half a dozen musical numbers
simply pushes the limit and pads the running time.  Little Justin Pierre
Edmond should have been another strong candidate for the editor's knife;
the button-cute rascal is one of the worst child actors I have seen on
screen in years.</P>
<P>     Thankfully, Denzel Washington is on hand to provide a jolt whenever
THE PREACHER'S WIFE needs it most.  His first appearance may be a shock to
those who know him best as serious, determined characters in films like
MALCOLM X, CRIMSON TIDE and COURAGE UNDER FIRE:  dropped from the sky into
the snow, looking decidedly dapper in a grey suit, hat and topcoat,
Washington's Dudley proceeds to celebrate his return to corporeal form by
spinning around on the ground like one of the Three Stooges.  It is a
giddy and completely unexpected moment, and one of many where Washington
shows the mischievous edge to this angel seduced by flesh.  His innocence
and earnestness are thoroughly charming, and his scenes with Courtney B.
Vance (effective as the real principal character of the story) have a
particular appeal.  If there isn't much chemistry between Washington and
Houston, well, that's not really the point of THE PREACHER'S WIFE.
Besides, Denzel Washington is a chemical reaction all by himself, and it
is a pleasure to see that he can sparkle as well as he smolders.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 preacher features:  6.</PRE>
