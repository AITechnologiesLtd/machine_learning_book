                        Twelfth Night (1996)
                   A film review by Ben Hoffman
                    Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     The use of twins as a tool for a plot in farce or semi-farce is
not new.  It goes back before Shakespeare who some 400 years ago
employed it in the most popular of his works, TWELFTH NIGHT.   While
this is a comedy, like all good comedies there is a lot of truth in
it.  In this case Shakespeare examined the man that is in most women
and the woman who is in most men.</P>
<P>     And here is how he did it:  Look-alike twins Viola (Imogen
Stubbs) and her brother Sebastian (Steven Mackintosh)  are separated
when a ship on which they are cruising is wrecked off the coast of the
imaginary country of Ilyria.  Coming ashore, Viola is convinced that
her brother must have drowned.</P>
<P>     Viola discovers that she is near the home of a young countess,
Olivia, (Helena Bonham Carter) who has sworn not to have anything to
do with men for seven years because both her father and brother
recently died.   Duke Orsino (Toby Stephens) is in love with her but
she rejects any of his advances.</P>
<P>     Alone and unknown in this new country of Ilyria, Viola changes
her name to Cesario when she decides her safety lies in disguising
herself as a boy, which consists not only in wearing a fake mustache
but in learning how to ride a horse, fence, smoke and play billiards.
The truth is her disguise would not have fooled anyone except in a
comedy where it is OK to suspend reality.  "He" then gets himself a
job with the Duke Orsino where his first assignment is to woo the
countess on Orsino's behalf. . . but Olivia gets a bit of a crush, to
her surprise, on the slender boyish-looking Cesario, as Viola falls
for Orsino . . . while the plot thickens.</P>
<P>     Let us not forget that twin Sebastian is not dead and shows up
one fine day to further complicate that triangle of Cesario, Countess
Olivia and Duke Orsino.  All this time, the Countess' household is
having its own love battles as Malvolio (Nigel Hawthorne, whom you will
remember as the king in THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE) and, others are
involved in their own chicanery.   Throughout all of this, there is a
strolling minstrel, Feste, played to perfection by the amazing Ben
Kingsley who has enthralled us ever since he hit the screens as GHANDI
way back in 1982 when he won an Oscar for Best Performing Actor, as
well as everything else he has been in since.   This performance
should get him a Best Supporting nomination.     This being a comedy
we must expect that all's well that ends well.</P>
<PRE>          Directed by Trevor Dunn who has been doing Shakespeare for 18
years.</PRE>
