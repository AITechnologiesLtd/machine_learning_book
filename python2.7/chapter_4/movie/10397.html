<P>In politics, image is absolutely everything. Early in "Wag The Dog," 
someone challenges a top-level Presidential spin doctor about truth and 
he snaps "The truth? I'll tell you about truth. I saw the first draft of 
the Warren Commission Report. It said Kennedy was killed by a drunk 
driver."
"Wag The Dog" is a hilarious black comedy about people so far removed 
from morals that questions of right or wrong never even enter their minds.
 Their only consideration is the effectiveness of their elaborate 
deceptions, and who gets a cut of the merchandising profits. Cynical? Of 
course, but Barry Levinson's crackerjack direction maintains such a giddy 
momentum that there's really no time to reflect on how awful these people 
are. Instead, you just sit back and enjoy their brazen scheming.
Here's the set-up. 11 days before the election, the incumbent President, 
who has enjoyed a 17% lead in the polls, is accused of hitting on an 
underage girl during a White House tour. Within hours, his challenger 
(Craig T. Nelson) has crafted devastating new TV ads, set to the tune of 
"Thank Heavens For Little Girls." Quickly, Presidential assistant 
Winifred Ames (Anne Heche) calls in damage control expert Conrad Brean 
(Robert De Niro,) who reasons that the only way for the President to be 
re-elected is if they create a crisis big enough to divert the nation's 
attention from the scandal. Perhaps a war, maybe with Albania. "Why 
Albania?" asks Ames. "Why not," laughs Brean. To orchestrate the pretend 
war, he enlists the aid of Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Dustin 
Hoffman,) who is more than happy to help. "You know, there's not an 
Academy Award for producers," he moans, "Why is that? Do they think these 
things produce themselves?"
Motss quickly plots out the scenario for the crisis, then pulls together 
his experts to work on the really important stuff; the war's official 
slogan, theme song and merchandising tie-ins. When "that yellow ribbon 
business" is mentioned, Ames interrupts to explain that the yellow 
ribbons were a naturally occurring phenomenon. She stops short though, 
when she notices Brean smiling wearily at her naiveté.
And so the scam begins, with Brean instructing a White House Press 
Secretary to tell reporters that there is absolutely no truth to the 
rumors about problems in Albania relating to the B-3 bomber. When 
reminded that there is no B-3 bomber, Brean smiles confidently and says, 
"Exactly." The White House press corps dutifully responds to the bait, 
and within hours the nation is riveted to their TV sets, watching the 
latest on the crisis in Albania. 
David Mamet and Hilary Henkin's screenplay, based on the book by Larry 
Beinhart, is incredibly slick and fast-moving, operating on the 
assumption that movie-goers are savvy enough to roll with the concept. 
And, thanks to the surreal political realities of today, the absurdist 
story seems all too possible.
Barry Levinson is a uneven director, turning out a few great works ("Rain 
Man") and some real dogs ("Toys",) but he's in top form here. He shot 
"Wag The Dog" in just 29 days, and the film has an immediacy that keeps 
the proceedings buoyant. His camera work displays a breezy confidence and 
a great sense of play. It's obvious the director was having a wonderful 
time turning out this wicked little film.
Of course, it would be hard not to have fun with a cast like this. Anne 
Heche has a beguiling effervescence as the president's assistant. 
Winifred Ames may be new to deception at such a massive scale, but she 
hops right in and does her part. Robert De Niro exudes an ominous 
confidence as the man making the big decisions. His exact title is never 
divulged; you simply understand that when things go wrong, he's the guy 
you call to fix them. His role is much like Harvey Keitel's suave mob 
character in "Pulp Fiction," which makes perfect sense in this perverse 
context. Adding to the lunacy is Woody Harrelson in a deliciously twisted 
cameo as the designated hero for the bogus war.
But despite the fine performances of the rest of the cast, it's Dustin 
Hoffman who steals the show with his Oscar-worthy portrayal of producer 
Stanley Motss. Rich, spoiled and self-obsessed, Motss is a fascinating 
character. Mid-way through the film, when the opposition catches on and 
orchestrates a televised announcement that the war has ended, Motss 
explodes, shouting "Over?! This war isn't over until I say it's over!" To 
Hoffman's credit, you don't doubt him for a second.   
Skirting the line between preposterousness and uncomfortable plausibility,
 "Wag The Dog" is a nightmarish delight that invites comparisons to such 
great satires as "Network" and "Dr. Strangelove." Prepare to laugh 
yourself silly, and let's all pray that the film is less true than it 
seems to be.</P>
