<PRE>                          STRANGERS IN GOOD COMPANY
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     STRANGERS IN GOOD COMPANY is a film directed by Cynthia Scott and
produced by the National Film Board of Canada.  It stars seven
non-professional actors, Alice Diabo, Mary Meigs, Constance Garneau,
Michelle Sweeney, Beth Webber, and two others whose names have gotten
away from me.  The screenplay was written by Gloria Demers with Cynthia
Scott, David Wilson, and Sally Bochner.</P>
<P>     In some ways, this yank thinks STRANGERS IN GOOD COMPANY is the
perfect Canadian film.  It is quiet, sensitive, non-violent,
non-spectacular, the very opposite of the Hollywood flick; it is
informed by a love of its characters and the scenery (Mont Tremblant),
by intelligence, by the idea spoken by one the characters that everyone
has an interesting story.</P>
<P>     This story concerns six older women whose tour bus breaks down 20
miles from help.  They and their driver (Sweeney), a young, black woman
who has twisted her ankle, painfully make their way to a deserted
farmhouse above an idyllic lake.  They need shelter, beds, food, and
hope of rescue.  They set about surviving with an unhurried practicality
and openness.  Some of their efforts are silly, some crafty.  They do
what they can and they complain or blame hardly at all.  They spend a
lot of their time talking and revealing their interesting stories.  No
potboilers, no confrontations, no great break throughs, just people
depending on one another.</P>
<P>     The dramatis personae include a nun with an interest in
automechanics, an elegant lesbian who paints watercolors and who has a
fund of facts about nature (Meigs), an ex-Liverpudlian with a face like
an owl and a unique approach to aerobics, a woman with a high-pitched
voice and the cheeriness of an idiot or a saint, a Mohawk matriarch
(Diabo) who knows some tricks about wild food and survival, a beautiful
and young looking 80-year-old (Webber) with a fear of wattles, the
driver with a talent for making music and friends, and a 92-year-old
(Garneau) who thinks she may have found a good place to die.</P>
<P>     These women largely play themselves, it is their stories that they
tell so effectively.  The director from time to time shows old snapshots
from life of character or another; you see the story in their changing
faces.</P>
<P>     My audience had a preponderance of older people in it, exactly the
opposite of most movie audiences.  This may have been a reflection of
the matinee ticket prices (which are lower than seniors prices).
Certainly the mob waiting for the next show were more demographically
normal.  The younger couple behind me thought that every action and
utterance on the screen was so cute as to require a laugh.  It's true,
sometimes the women were unspeakably cute, but at other times they broke
our hearts, they moved us to tears, they filled us with awe at their
bravery, their grace, their acceptance of life.  They had their fears
(death, not seeing a great-grandchild grow up, being ugly, not dying
even); after all, they were human beings--and we are all afraid, but are
we all as wise about our fears and foolishness?</P>
<P>     If I have any complaints about STRANGERS IN GOOD COMPANY, it is
that the cast is too perfectly balanced.  Could such a group really find
themselves on one small tour bus--the nun, the dyke, the Indian, the
Afro-Canadian, the English immigrant, et aliae?  This is the only
artifice in a movie that emphasizes naturalness, the only fiction in a
movie that is really about real people.</P>
<P>     Please see this movie.  It will change you.  Pay whatever they ask
to get in.  If it doesn't play where you see import movies, as the
manager to schedule it.  And then send a letter of thanks to the
National Film Board of Canada.</P>
