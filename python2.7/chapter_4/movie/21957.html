<P>I don't know why anyone felt the need to produce another remake of 1956's 
classic sci-fi/horror film INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, yet here it is, 
and the lineup of creative talent behind it is promising.  Check out this 
intriguing combination:  writer-director Larry Cohen (screenplay credit), 
writer-director Stuart Gordon (story credit), and writer-director Abel 
Ferrara (who gets the directing chore despite being the only one of the 
three to show no previous interest in the genre).  It sounds as if the 
resulting film might be a body snatcher designed by committee, but the end 
result is a fairly tight product.</P>
<P>Prior knowledge makes this difficult viewing - there's little suspense or 
surprise because by now we have come to know the story so well: a few people 
discover that their family, friends, and neighbors are gradually being 
'replaced' by emotionally void duplicates and then find themselves running 
for their lives.  Story is faithful to the original (and the Jack Finney 
novel) in concept only.  Its two major changes are firstly that the central 
protagonist is a 17-year old girl (Gabrielle Anwar), and secondly that the 
small-town setting (changed to a big city in Philip Kaufman's 1978 version) 
has been overshadowed by a military base.  It would seem that what we have 
here is some ready-to-bake commentary on army personnel sacrificing their 
individuality to become a gestalt of emotionless drones, bla-bla-bla, but 
fortunately the story avoids this route and takes the more personal touch of 
paralleling the invasion of the alien 'body snatchers' with the 'invasion' 
of a new stepmother into Anwar's home (a creepy performance by Meg Tilly).  
As far as Anwar is concerned, her mother has already been replaced; the 
alien-invader scenario that follows is the realization/externalization of 
her fears now brought forth for everyone else to see.  Ferrara keeps the 
human element at the forefront of the story by shooting much of BODY 
SNATCHERS in closeup and midshot, letting faces and bodies fill the frame.  
This keeps the film real and down-to-earth until the first FX sequence, 
which may or may not be an improvement on previous versions depending on 
your point of view.  One of the more frustrating elements of the 1956 film 
for me as a young, first-time viewer, was the total lack of explanation 
concerning the body-transfer from seed pod to human copy.  
Ferrara/Cohen/Gordon present a simple, workable explanation - although it 
may be argued that it is scarier *not* to know anything of the process, and 
it was this lack of  information that contributed to the nightmarish quality 
of the original.</P>
<P>I don't think the FX are as big a problem as the decision to have Anwar 
narrating the story in flashback from frame one, however.  Automatically we 
are assured that her character will be still be around by the end of the 
story, which robs BODY SNATCHERS of a pivotal element of suspense.  I can't 
believe a writer as seasoned as Cohen would have let so obvious a slipup get 
by him.  But then again, I find it surprising to see Abel Ferrara packaging 
a film so uncharacteristic of his usual down-in-the-dirt urban dramas.  Has 
anyone checked their backyards for seed pods lately?</P>
