<PRE>Review: Waking Ned Devine
Starring: Ian Bannen, David Kelley
Directed by Kirk Jones
Approx 91 min</PRE>
<P>In these days of overlong movies (Meet Joe Black, The Thin Red Line,
The Mask Of Zorro) it is a shame that films like Waking Ned Devine
can't be longer than a paltry 90 minutes. This is just a cute movie,
even through its mildly risque subject matter.</P>
<P>Old friends Jackie (Bannen) and Michael (Kelley) try to find the
lottery winner (they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60)
so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings. Through
process of elimination, they find that it must be lovable old Ned
Devine, who they find sitting in front of his TV, clutching the
winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand. What results is
thuroughly amusing, as Jackie tries to convince his wife that not
claiming it would be wrong, and that they could really benefit. After
all, old Ned won't miss it. Rather than divulge the later twists and
turns, I'll stop here merely pointing out that Jackie and Michael get
into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy Irish villiage.</P>
<P>Bannen and Kelly are a perfect pair. One slightly stout, the other as
thin as a rail. Both getting on in years, they make such a cute pair
of old codgers. Waking Ned Devine may even be seen as a "Full Monty"
for the geriatric set, especially since Kelly gets buff-o for one
amusing scene.</P>
<P>Waking Ned Devine is by no means perfect, but it is so sincere and
touching that it looks so much better than most films. The
performances by everyone in the town are great, particularly the two
leads. There is one twist at the end which I find unnecessary, but it
hardly ruins the picture.</P>
<P>Writer/director Kirk Jones should be held up as an example to all
those Hollywood screenwriters. Scripts as creative and endearing as
this should be the norm, not the exception. Perhaps it makes us
appreciate this wonderful film even more. Had I held off on my year's
best/worst list for another day, Waking Ned Devine (officially
released in late November of 98) surely would have graced the short
group of the year's finest films. It is light, but thought provoking
and sweet. I can't think of anyone who shouldn't see (or wouldn't
enjoy) this film.</P>
