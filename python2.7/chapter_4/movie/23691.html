<PRE>The Ninth Gate
Directed by:  Roman Polanski
Starring: Johnny Depp, Frank Langella, Lena Olin, Emmanuelle
Seigner, Barbara Jefford
Running time:  132 minutes
My rating (5 star scale):  ***</PRE>
<P>Corso (Depp) is an unscrupulous dealer in rare books, hired
by Balkan (Langella) to track down the remaining two copies
of The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of the Shadows.  Balkan owns
the third copy but believes two of the books are fakes.  He 
wants Corso to compare them.  First Corso visits the widow (Olin)
of the former owner of Balkan's copy - a man who commits suicide
after giving up the book.  And things start getting complicated.</P>
<P>Corso doesn't trust Balkan, who may be following him.  He's 
definitely being followed by a mysterious woman (Seigner), who
seems to have supernatural powers.  And people keep turning up 
dead.  Meanwhile the not so grieving widow seems to be lurking
in the background.  And Corso is beginning to wonder whether the
legend of the book, that its coauthor was Satan, is true.  And 
he begins to fear what will happen when his mission is completed.</P>
<P>Polanski likes making movies about morally ambiguous people 
who find themselves slowly drawn into evil.  So slowly, that it
becomes difficult to determine exactly when the irreversible
step was taken.  Characters like that can be seen in films like 
Chinatown, Death and the Maiden, and Macbeth. Corso is one of 
those characters.  No one would mistake him for a saint, he 
begins the film by cheating a family on the value of a rare 
book, but he does have some morals.  He says he loves money, but
at times he is willing to give up the chance at big money just
to get out of this macabre deal he has struck.  But something
keeps pulling him back.  Curiosity, lust, the desire for revenge, 
maybe even fear - there's always something. </P>
<P>Depp is excellent, always stopping just this side of the brink 
of parody.  Langella and Olin are both suitably mysterious and
frightening.  Seigner gives a surprisingly strong performance.  
The direction is reasonable (weak for Polanski).  A few scenes, 
like the opening sequence and the titles stand out.  But compared
to most horror films, this is brilliant stuff. Unfortunately,
the story is the weak point.  While the characters are 
interesting, the story verges on dull.  Not much happens and
nothing is resolved.  I don't need to be spoon fed a resolution,
but this film doesn't even give you any decent hints.</P>
<P>I paid full price for this film and didn't feel cheated.  Horror
fans (and fans of Depp or Polanski) will find it well worth the
price.  For the rest of you, wait for the video.  </P>
