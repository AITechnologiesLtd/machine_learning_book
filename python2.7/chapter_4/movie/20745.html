<P>Starring Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Illeana Douglas. Rated R.</P>
<P>And so the horror craze of 1999 continues. The audience is hungry for
more fright-fests and Hollywood is more than ready to deliver them.
David Koepp, screenwriter of such flashy nothings as The Lost World and
Mission: Impossible is the latest to take a stab at this most lucrative
of genres and his Stir of Echoes is entertaining and, for the first time
this year, scary, though far too conventional. There have already been
complaints about the film Echoing The Sixth Sense and they are not all
together incorrect, though Stir of Echoes is a far more light-hearted
effort than its poignant predecessor.</P>
<P>Kevin Bacon's "center of the movie universe" status (popularized by the
"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" party game, in which a player would try to
connect Bacon to another actor in six movies or less) has been fading,
of late, what with this being only his second "major" motion picture
since Sleepers in 1996 (unless you count Picture Perfect, but you'd have
to be insane). This is probably a step down from Wild Things in clout,
but certainly a step up in quality.</P>
<P>Bacon plays Tom Witzky, a Chicago electrician, living with his wife (the
magnificent, though heretofore inconspicuous Kathryn Erbe) and his young
son. He notices that his son talks to someone who isn't there (in fact,
this is the basis for a staggeringly effective opening scene) but passes
it off, until something happens that opens his eyes. Now, Tom is
introduced as a harshy cynical fella, so when at a party his sister-in-
law starts talking about feats performed with the help of hypnosis, he
dares her to hypnotize him. Not surprisingly it works. Another wonderful
scene, and before we know it, he is out of stasis -- but something isn't
quite right.</P>
<P>He starts seeing visions. Scary visions. Violent visions. They pop up at
the oddest times. Then they disappear. At first Tom is scared, but he
soon becomes curious. Who is his son talking to? What's happening to
that strange girl in his dreams? What's that song he keeps hearing? How
can he make all this go away?</P>
<P>Scream's got nothing on this baby. In terms of jolts, Stir of Echoes is
second to none; a vertable jump-o-rama. In that sense, this is the first
"scary" movie this year: neither Sixth Sense nor The Blair Witch Project
managed this sort of visceral thrill (though these two were going for
psychological suspense rather than "Boo" moments).</P>
<P>Another thing Stir of Echoes has going for it is its unexpectedly witty
script. Not only is it full of one-liners, some generic, some not, but
it also has some funny characters. Tom's new-age sister-in-law has some
truly guffaw-worthy moments, and Tom's own blind determination towards
the end of the film is presented in an unconventionally innocuous way.
The film manages to keep up an extraordinary level of suspense while
maintaining an easy-going and unpretentious attitude. The action is
ominous and somehow gleefully facetious at the same time.</P>
<P>Plot comparisons to The Sixth Sense are not only inevitable, they're
justified. Stir of Echoes can not be faulted for being a "rip-off", per
se, as it was the first of the two to be filmed, but to those not made
aware of that crucial detail, the similarities between the two will seem
suspicious, at best. The most prevalent parallel, of course, is of a
young kid who talks to ghosts. Another: both films involve a murdered
girl whose ghost appears to the main character and wants him to do
something for her. The two movies are so uncannily similar in some
respects that I'm forced to wonder whether the two screenwriters aren't
roommates.</P>
<P>Of course to those (few) who didn't see The Sixth Sense none of this
will matter one bit. Standing on its own, this is pretty good stuff: an
entertaining and reasonably frightening thriller that, quite
shamelessly, makes you laugh and jump almost at the same time. If you
did see Sixth Sense, I'm going to say that this one is only worth paying
to see if you are willing to put the Bruce Willis movie out of your head
for two hours. It isn't a fun experience if you're subconciously forced
to constantly make comparisons to something you've seen before. It also
isn't particularly fair to this gem of a thriller, which, I shall remind
you once more, was filmed before its unwitting companion.
