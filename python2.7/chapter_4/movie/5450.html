<P>     I have a great idea for a movie, one that can't miss.  See, I've got
Coolio to do a song for the soundtrack, and about fifty athletes and
celebrities to do cameo appearances.  It's about professional basketball,
so I'll release it right around the NBA finals to guarantee added
publicity.  As for what the movie is actually about...well, that will all
sort itself out eventually.  I figure it will be a comedy, so I'll throw a
half-dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with. 
Maybe we'll put a gender spin on it, see if we can get some women out to
see it, too. </P>
<P>     EDDIE is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more
than any other kind.  TWISTER, as inane as the script might have been, at
least required some creative technicians; MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, overwrought
plot and all, at least involved genuine effort.  EDDIE just sits there,
hawking up a formula story without any laughs, and makes every possible
bad decision when a decision is required.</P>
<P>     Whoopi Goldberg plays Eddie Franklin, a New York limo driver and
die-hard Knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her
beloved team.  Coach John Bailey (Dennis Farina) has lost control of his
overpaid prima donnas, and the losses are beginning to mount.  The
dwindling attendance inspires new team owner Wild Bill Burgess (Frank
Langella) to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an
honorary coach of the team.  The winner (surprise, surprise) is Eddie, who
becomes a fan favorite, and eventually the actual coach.  The Knicks
continue to lose, but Eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire
her troops.</P>
<P>     Incidentally, the Knicks eventually start winning.  Please raise your
hand if that comes as a shock, and I will invite you to my all-night
marathon of THE BAD NEWS BEARS, MAJOR LEAGUE, ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD, THE
MIGHTY DUCKS, THE BIG GREEN, COOL RUNNINGS and LITTLE GIANTS.  Awful teams
in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds; it's what they do.  Those
teams usually involve kids, for a very sound comedic reason:  it's funnier
when they screw up, and they're more sympathetic.  Those which _don't_
involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles, for another
very sound comedic reason:  they generally have developed some sort of
comic timing.  EDDIE was cast under the misguided premise that it's easier
to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look
like basketball players.  This finds NBA players like Greg Ostertag,
Dwayne Schintzius, Rick Fox and Malik Sealy delivering punch lines as
though they were reading them for the first time off a Bazooka wrapper
(though Sacramento Kings center Olden Polynice has a nice moment
describing a black hole to fellow players).</P>
<P>     Perhaps that all didn't matter to anyone because there are so few
punch lines, and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick.  Steve
Rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender
and screaming, "Don't blame me, I just work here."  Perhaps it was
patently obvious to him that EDDIE isn't a movie -- it's a cameo
appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while.  Among the
notables who lend their faces to this travesty are Donald Trump, New York
mayor Rudolph Giulianni, former New York mayor Ed Koch, David Letterman,
Letterman regulars Mujibur Rahman and Sirajul Islam, ESPN broadcaster
Chris Berman and Knicks announcer Marv Albert, as well as dozens of NBA
players and several NBA arenas.  And those are the real jokes in EDDIE.
Nothing these individuals say or do is funny; you are supposed to be
laughing simply because you notice, "Hey, it's Donald Trump!" or "Hey,
it's Mujibur and Sirajul!"</P>
<P>     It's difficult to decide whether EDDIE is so bad because it was so
shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can't even get the
cliches in a cliche-ridden genre script right.  The Knicks coach who is
Eddie's antagonist early in the film reappears at the end, but he isn't
given a chance to be the villain EDDIE desperately needs.  Neither is
Frank Langella, and none of the athlete-actors have the ability to give
Whoopi Goldberg anything to play off of.  That leaves her to do her
street-wise Miss Thang routine, but with no character, no sharp lines and
no help.</P>
<P>     EDDIE isn't just a bad movie with a formulaic premise.  It's a movie
that makes you feel cheated and offended, because someone came up with a
poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie,
and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 technical fouls:  1.</PRE>
