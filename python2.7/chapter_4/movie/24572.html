"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Based on Roger Rueff's play `Hospitality Suite,' The Big Kahuna is the
first film to be made by two-time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey's new
production company, Trigger Street Productions.  Kahuna is set almost
entirely in a sixteenth-floor hotel suite in Wichita, where three
industrial lubricant salesmen for Lodestar Laboratories contemplate the
meaning of life while pitching their wares to prospective clients over
hors d'oeuvres and an open bar.</P>
<P>Any film that features salesmen who love to gab risks being compared to
David Mamet's far superior Glengarry Glen Ross.  But Kahuna borrows
ideas from more films than just Mamet's masterpiece.  Since the three
principal actors are crammed into a hotel room for most of the picture,
your mind will likely wander to those rascally kids in The Breakfast
Club.  When they talk about the greatest salesman in Lodestar history,
you can't help but remember the Saturday Night Live skit where the guys
talk up a legend by the name of Bill Brasky.  And when an important
client (`The Big Kahuna') doesn't show up to their meet-and-greet, you
get a little taste of Beckett's `Waiting for Godot.'</P>
<P>Offering little else but dialogue, Kahuna is one of those films where
each character experiences some kind of major life change by the time
the closing credits start to roll.  Bob Walker (Peter Facinelli,
Supernova) is an eager, young, Bible-thumping newlywed with no
experience and even less personality.  Larry Mann (Spacey, American
Beauty) sees a lot of his younger self in Bob, even though he's become a
cynical, middle-aged bully.  Phil Cooper (Danny DeVito, Drowning Mona)
is already over the hill, dreads the prospect of watching his life come
to end, and chooses to fritter his time reading pornography.</P>
<P>As the three bicker about work and religion, it feels like you're
trapped in the room with them – and I don't mean that in a good way.
Kahuna begins and ends fairly promisingly (aside from the obnoxious Baz
Lurhmann song "Everybody's Free [To Wear Sunscreen]' playing over the
closing credits), but the middle is very slow.  It's still worth a trip
to the theatre just to see Kahuna's first-rate acting.  Spacey hasn't
skipped a beat since his [insert award name here] winning performance in
Beauty.  DeVito delivers what could be his best performance to date, and
Facinelli makes the most of his biggest part yet.</P>
