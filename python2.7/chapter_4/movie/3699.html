<P>     In addition to being the name of the movie, WE ARE ALL STARS is the 
title of a fictional television game show broadcast daily throughout 
Lima, Peru.  The Huambachanos, like every other family in that part of 
the country, are devoted to the program, watching it faithfully, 
dreaming of the time when their application will be accepted and they'll 
have a chance to earn millions.  When the day finally arrives, it comes 
as the result of a mistake.  In reality, the Huambachanos' entry form 
was placed in the pile for those who should never appear on the show.  
But a mix-up occurs and a television debut awaits Carmen and her three 
children. </P>
<P>     With WE ARE ALL STARS, director Felipe Degregori attempts to take a 
humorous look at media manipulation in everyday life, but most of his 
jokes are juvenile and unfunny.  Like almost all supposed satires 
lacking humor, this one turns out to be pretty tedious.  While a half-
hour on the subject might be okay, eighty-eight minutes is definitely 
too much.  Meanwhile, we're supposed to sympathize with a family 
comprised of four (or five, if you count the absentee father) self-
absorbed individuals with the collective appeal of ragweed. </P>
<P>     WE ARE ALL STARS succeeds in presenting a snapshot of everyday 
Peruvian life, including the hardships created by desperate economic 
conditions.  In this society, it's easy to understand the popularity of 
a game show offering the universal hope that anyone can win.  Of course, 
it's all a lie, since only a certain kind of "acceptable" family has a 
chance of getting on the air.  Ultimately, however, these interesting 
elements are relegated to the background.  The spoof is very much at the 
fore -- and it's the failure of that satire which undermines the 
effectiveness of Degregori's feature. </P>
