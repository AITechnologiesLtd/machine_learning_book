<P>    When you pass somebody who seems quite a bit different
from the usual passersby--perhaps a homeless man with
unkempt hair and dirty clothes, maybe a person who is just 3
feet tall, could be someone who is not only in a wheelchair
but breathing with a the aid of a tube--you are likely to
believe that this individual is wholly distinct from all others on
the street.  You may be correct.  But  you may also be
overlooking two other factors. 1) The person with the strange
appearance may have sharp mental functions totally
unaltered by his or her physical condition; and 2) The
accompanying person who looks wholly ordinary may in fact
be the one with unorthodox mental functioning.  </P>
<P>   In "The Theory of Flight," Paul Greengrass makes use of 
Richard Hawkins's wholly original script to unfold a comedy of
offbeat proportions between two such individuals.  Jane
(Helena Bonham Carter) is a woman of just twenty-six years
who'd likely get a wide berth from others.  She is wheelchair
bound, suffering from terminal Lou Gehrig's Disease, a
severe neurological condition which does not affect her
intellect or her ability to feel but restricts her physical
movement and slurs her speech almost beyond
comprehension.  Richard (Kenneth Branagh), looks
reasonably average but has a Peter Pan complex, a refusal
to grow up, which leads him at one point to go literally over
the edge.  One day, after suffering a mini nervous
breakdown, he perches with a pair of wings on the edge of a
London building and takes flight--right into a net provided by
the police.  Winding up in court, he is sentenced to 120 hours
of community service and assigned to a rehab center to be
Jane's companion.</P>
<P>  If you can accept the premise that a court would
commission a handsome but troubled young man to escort a
virtually paralyzed young woman about, you can embrace the
oddities in the rest of the film.  As the two get to know each
other, the usually untrusting Jane gradually warming up to
her escort's infantile dreams of taking flight, Jane asks a
favor which serves as the story's bombshell.  She is a virgin,
having suffered symptoms of deterioration at the age of
eighteen, and is obsessed with erotic fantasies.  Jane spends
most of her time glued to a computer, has been exposed to
porno films, sees advertising on the tube that plays up sexual
fantasies to sell products, and observes the influence that sex
plays in the stories she watches as well.  Carefree that
Richard may be, he cannot bring himself to satisfy what is far
more than a passing whim of this woman, a person who is
treated like a child by so many others and who therefore can
relate to Richard's own, self-created immaturity.</P>
<P>   "The Theory of Flight" has a modicum of comical and
sentimental scenes alike.  One involving Richard's hiring of a
strikingly handsome gigolo for his unfortunate friend is a gem
with both farcical and tragic import, while the schemes of
Richard's ex-girl friend Julie (Holly Aird) play up the
restraining, even joyless nature of the down-to-earth life.  </P>
<P>   Ultimately the film does not soar.  Director Paul Greenglass
does what he can to liberate the two from all that is holding
back their enjoyment of human existence, but though he films
much of the comedy on the rolling hills of Bristol, "The
Theory of Flight" has the imprint of staged play: two
frustrated oddballs turning their backs on society to work out
their defeats and disappointments.  Helena Bonham Carter,
who has studied the movements and attitudes of people with
severe neurological challenges, is convincing, making the
audience listen closely to understand her speech.  Kenneth
Branagh still belongs, in my opinion, to heroic roles, and
should avoid cloning Woody Allen as he did to some extent in
this film and in "Celebrity" before it.  His stuttering is irritating
enough: his frequent use of the adolescent expression "you
know" is dispiriting, just as Woody Allen's was in the latter's
"Full Tilt Boogie."  The performers and director do realize the
writer's contention that you may have a disease, but the
disease needn't have you, but do so in such a feathery
manner that the movie lacks a sufficient sense of comedy,
catastrophe, or convincing eccentricity.</P>
