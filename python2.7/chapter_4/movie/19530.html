ROUGE (YIN JI KAU) (director: Stanley Kwan; cast: Anita Mui (Fleur),
Alex Man (Yuen), Emily Chu (Ah Chor), Leslie Cheung (Chan Chen-Pang),
1987-Hong Kong)</P>
<P>This is a visually appealing Hong Kong ghost story film, that is highly
stylized, told from the perspective of a courtesan, Anita Mui (Fleur).
She committed suicide from an over-dose of opium and sleeping pills; she
also gave the deadly dosage to her unsuspecting male suitor, Leslie
Cheung (Chan Chen-Pang), in 1934; it was at a time when his wealthy
parents would not allow him to marry her, but he continued seeing her
despite his parents protests and was thereby cut off from the family
wealth. Her plan was, that she would rather be with her lover in hell,
than to not be with him in this world. But things didn't work out as she
expected and she never met him in hell; she did not know that he
survived.</P>
<P>We now see her as a wraith in a modern and thoroughly changed Hong Kong,
a place that leaves her confused, as she tries to contemplate the
different changes in the city 50- years later. She enters a newspaper ad
office hoping to place an ad in the paper to locate master 12, as she
used to call him, believing that he is now reincarnated in this world
and she will locate him by tracing the places he would frequent.</P>
<P>The film is evocative; its strength lying mostly in its poetical
presentation, as it masterfully weaves a visual work of great scope and
intelligence.The essence of the story does not depend on whether you
believe in ghosts or not, though it would help if you would not be
entirely reluctant to accept the possiblity that there could be a
life-after-death. The film's plot is based on the knowledge that
everything in life is transitory, that even love is questionable when
thought of in eternal terms.</P>
<P>Fleur, still dressed as a 1930s courtesan would be dressed, appears out
of place in this modern capitalistic society, that has forgotten not
only its ancient roots but its recent past. She befriends the perplexed
young head of the ad office, Alex Man (Yuen), who becomes frightened
when she follows him home after work, and he dramatically realizes that
she is not human. He is, only, too human, living with his cute
girlfriend Emily Chu (Ah Chor), who is a reporter on the newspaper. When
Yuen tells her he took this strange woman back to their place, she is,
at first, jealous, then her curiosity gets the better of her when she
examines her and discovers Fleur does not have a heartbeat. She listens
to her story; and, thereby, agrees to help Fleur track down her missing
lover, though she has horrible feelings about what Fleur did, not
believing suicide is needed as a proof for love. The contrasts between
old and new Hong Kong is accomplished in a very revealing manner, as the
young couple come to look at their relationship in a deeper way than
they ever had before, and look back on a Hong Kong that no longer exists
with the help of their ghostly guide.</P>
<P>This film fascinated me on many levels, but mainly, it made me wonder
about unfulfilled expectations in this world and how the netherworld
could really exist as a domain for such things that remain unresolved.
It questioned what it is one really believes in and how easy it is to
stray from what one believes in. It allows us the opportunity to ask
ourselves, if we can really believe in spiritual things without being
spiritual? Can love be so enduring to last forever? Is there something
worth dying for?</P>
<P>This is truly one of the best films to come out of Hong Kong in the
modern era. Even its ironical ending, is handled with great dignity and
care; and, even if, you are not convinced by the logic of this
super-natural tale, the beauty of its characterization is enough to make
up for any shortcomings you might have thought this film had, such as
the improbability of such vivid ghosts being so openly seen by everyone.</P>
