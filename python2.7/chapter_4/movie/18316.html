<PRE>VIRUS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: 1/2 out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>You always have to be careful with the initial releases of any calendar
year. January is a traditional dumping ground in which the studios
release films that they don't believe are good enough to even merit a
shot at getting awards, nor entertaining enough to benefit from the
high-traffic holiday box office.  Such a film this year is Virus, a high
tech zombie movie that resembles, in more ways than one, last year's
January-release: Deep Rising.  Both are sci-fi thrillers set aboard a
boat.  And both deserve to be sunk as quickly as possible.</P>
<P>In Virus, Jamie Lee Curtis stars as Kelly Foster, the navigator of the
Sea Star, a tugboat under the command of Captain Everton (Donald
Sutherland), who (at some point before the movie starts) has gone
completely mad.  It's up to Foster and the ship's engineer Steve Baker
(William Baldwin) to keep the tug in one piece. Everton has led the ship
into the middle of a typhoon, where they encounter something
mysterious:  an abandoned Russian scientific vessel.</P>
<P>Upon exploring the derelict ship, the crew of the Sea Star discover
plenty of unusual phenomena.  The entire Russian crew is missing (except
for plenty of bloodstains here and there), there is evidence of gunfire
throughout the ship, and many systems have been smashed or otherwise
destroyed.</P>
<P>But that is only the beginning, as the crew of the Sea Star are about to
find out.  An energy-based life form from outer space has inhabited the
ship's computers.  It controls all the ship's systems, and is building
cyborg robots to further its control.  The alien considers human life to
be a noxious virus that must be eliminated (though in a way that will
provide plenty of spare parts for the next cyborg...).</P>
<P>It is in this way that, you can be certain, everyone who dies will be
back as a bad guy later in the film.  The film never explains why the
alien life form even bothers creating these cyborgs.  It is not as if
they are more powerful than the purely robotic creations.  Nor do they
seem more efficient or more intelligent.  Perhaps they were created out
of boredom (there's certainly enough of that in this movie).</P>
<P>Virus falls into the same trap as many sci-fi horror films.  It's full
of seemingly smart characters who do extremely stupid things.  (Hmmm...
an abandoned ship in the middle of a typhoon, filled with blood and
signs of violence?  Let's split up and wander aimlessly through the dark
corridors...)</P>
<P>The actors in Virus aren't given much to work with, and they don't give
a lot in return.  Donald Sutherland's campy performance (with a
mumble-mouthed on-again, off-again accent) may qualify as the worst in
the film...but at least he was trying something different.  Jamie Lee
Curtis and William Baldwin simply stroll through the film with nary an
ounce of effort.</P>
<P>The robot designs in Virus are halfway interesting, and the high point
of the film.  But, they're hardly worth wading through the rest of the
film just to see.  Very few things would be...</P>
