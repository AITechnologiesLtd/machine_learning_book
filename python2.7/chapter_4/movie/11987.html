<P>     There is a scene in NIL BY MOUTH, actor Gary Oldman's directorial 
debut, that is excruciatingly difficult to watch.  It's not especially 
graphic, since the gruesome details take place out of frame, but anyone 
with an imagination can conjure up an image to chill the blood.  The 
sequence depicts a particularly brutal instance of spousal abuse, and is 
perhaps only recently rivaled in intensity by a similar occurrence in 
ONCE WERE WARRIORS.  One might think that movie-goers, inured to 
explicit on-screen violence, would not flinch at what Oldman presents, 
but there's a major difference between the decapitations and 
eviscerations of a STARSHIP TROOPERS and the savageness of NIL BY MOUTH 
– the former plays like a comic book come to life; the latter is 
shockingly real.</P>
<P>     Oldman has based this bleak, gritty tale on his memories of growing 
up in the economically deprived projects of South London.  Only Oldman 
knows how much of the story is true and how much is made up, but there's 
an eerie sense of verisimilitude about nearly every scene in the film, 
and the dialogue couldn't be more exact.  This is an uncompromising 
drama – it doesn't shrink from presenting the horror of the situation, 
nor does it take the easy path of demonizing the abuser and deifying the 
victim.  And there's no facile conclusion that wraps everything into a 
neat package.  Like life, NIL BY MOUTH is messy and open-ended.</P>
<P>     From the beginning, it's clear that three elements are going to be 
critical to the events that transpire during NIL BY MOUTH:  alcohol, 
drugs, and poverty.  They are facts of life in contemporary South 
London, where the movie is set.  Our first glimpse of the main 
character, Raymond (Ray Winstone, in a stunningly forceful performance), 
is in a pub where he and some friends are sitting around drinking lager 
and trading profane stories.  Oldman allows the film to develop slowly, 
giving us a feel for Ray and his buddies.  They are all victims of 
society, but do the best they can to get by, and use alcohol to dull the 
pain of not having any real purpose in life.  It's a far cry from the 
more upbeat picture painted by THE FULL MONTY.  </P>
<P>     Ray is a family man.  He has a wife, Valerie (a heartwrenching 
Kathy Burke, who won the Best Actress prize at the 1997 Cannes Film 
Festival), and a young daughter.  But all is not well under his roof.  
When he has had a few pints, Ray is prone to explosive exhibits of 
violence.  With little or no provocation, he will lash out at anyone in 
range.  His favorite target is his wife's drug-addicted brother, Billy 
(Charlie Creed-Miles), who lives with Ray's family.  When Billy isn't 
around, there are other possibilities, including his wife.  And, 
although Ray never harms his daughter physically, there is little doubt 
that his behavior leaves deep psychological scars (witness the shot of 
the little girl sitting alone on the staircase above the room where her 
father has just battered her mother).</P>
<P>     Oldman does an excellent job of bringing the audience into a world 
where despair and hopelessness are the norm.  NIL BY MOUTH does not 
sympathize with Ray, but it forces us to understand him.  He is the 
product of a dysfunctional family and the son of a man who was incapable 
of expressing affection (the film's title refers to this).  He loves his 
wife and daughter, but, like too many men under the influence of 
alcohol, he cannot control himself, and the most base impulses of his 
nature emerge with devastating consequences.  The film's treatment of 
Valerie is equally well-rounded and believable.  The director shows her 
pain, desperation, and humiliation, as well as her growing determination 
to free herself from the cycle of violence that threatens her safety.  </P>
<P>     From time-to-time, the movie becomes a little unfocused.  In 
attempting to flesh out the world surrounding Ray and Valerie, Oldman 
occasionally wanders far afield.  A little too much time is spent 
developing Billy's character, and one particular subplot involving 
Billy, his friends, and their attempts to procure drugs, is presented in 
a sketchy, haphazard manner.  Other than that, however, NIL BY MOUTH is 
extremely strong, and, at times, shattering.  Oldman's direction is sure 
and the performances he culls from a talented cast are consistently 
remarkable.  </P>
<P>     NIL BY MOUTH is as powerful as it is uncomfortable, and those in 
search of a pleasant movie-going experience would be best served looking 
elsewhere.  However, for anyone who isn't bothered by the thought of 
experiencing a shock to the system, this film is not to be missed.  It 
approaches a serious social issue in the best, most dramatically true 
manner.  Instead of resorting to lugubrious sermons or prettying things 
up Hollywood-style, it tells a simple, psychologically-exact tale that 
illustrates the depth and breadth of pain caused by domestic abuse.  NIL 
BY MOUTH leaves an impression that is hard to shake off, and that's the 
mark of an top-notch film.</P>
