<PRE>A Video Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>This is not an unseen movie. Thousands, even millions have watched it. Feast 
grossed just under 4.4 million dollars in the United States alone. Most of 
this revenue comes from its theatrical run, not its video release because Babe
tte's Feast is something most screenwriters avoid. It's a tough sell, and 
there's no hook to go along with it. Unlike the theater, if you rented the 
movie, and wanted to turn it off, you could. There's nothing unique you could 
convey to your friends about the story in under two sentences either. Despite 
this, Babette's Feast is an elegant, simple film. A wonderful and 
heartwarming experience awaits those who are patient enough for it to find 
its footing and unfold.</P>
<P>Martina (Birgitte Federspiel) and Philippa (Bodil Kjer) are the daughters of 
a long dead minister (Pouel Kern). They carry on their father's religious 
sect even though they've had several opportunities to leave their remote 
village. Through flashbacks we learn that young Martina (Vibeke Hastrup) and 
young Philippa (Hanne Stensgaard) were beautiful and kind young women who 
drove all the young men in town wild. They drove old ones, including French 
opera singer Achille Papin (Jean-Philippe Lafont), crazy too. Years later, 
Papin has aged even more, but remembers the women and their generosity. He 
sends Babette (Stephane Audran), a French refugee and cook, to them. Babette 
beseeches the two to let her stay, and eventually the sisters agree. It's 
back to the present. Martina and Philippa want to honor their father's 100th 
birthday. Since she has recently come into good fortune, Babette offers to 
cook a real French dinner for the celebration. The feast of a lifetime 
conflicts with the guest's conservative beliefs, and by the end they will all 
be changed. </P>
<P>The only major problem with the movie is one common to older foreign films. 
The subtitles are the traditional yellow, but they're in a large and 
difficult to read font. If a character says more than two lines of dialogue, 
it ends up filling the bottom third of the screen. To compensate, the words 
move very quickly, often too fast to read. This is really a shame because 
there is some beautiful framing. Parts of the movie, especially the 
beginning, are just gorgeous. The scenery is constantly changing and we get a 
good view of the character surroundings every time. There's also some very 
enjoyable singing.</P>
<P>The flashback format works for the movie, and it never gets confusing. 
Gabriel Axel wisely takes the background information from Isak Dinesen's 
novel and uses it to his advantage. He makes sure we know the people onscreen 
before they get put into an awkward situation. The performances are 
excellent, and I particularly like Audran and Lafont. Audran makes Babette an 
almost mysterious individual who always seems like she knows something or has 
something to say that she's not divulging. Lafont portrays a tender Achille 
Papin, a famous man who doesn't seem like he wants celebrity. While it 
languishes a bit, Babette's Feast is never boring. There's always something 
going on that's entertaining regardless of what it sounds like from the video 
box.</P>
