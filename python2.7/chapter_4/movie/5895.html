<P>     The sophomore jinx, the bane of hot, young film makers, has struck 
again.  After claiming the likes of Steven Soderbergh (SEX, LIES, AND 
VIDEOTAPE), Kevin Smith (CLERKS), Robert Rodriguez (EL MARIACHI), and 
Eric Schaeffer (MY LIFE'S IN TURNAROUND), it has now hunted down Edward 
Burns.  Burns, whose charming, low-budget THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN was the 
toast of last year's Sundance Film Festival, has brought another tale of 
sex, love, brotherhood, and Irish-Catholic angst to the screen, but this 
one isn't nearly as enticing as its predecessor.</P>
<P>     THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN's greatest appeal lies in its quiet, unforced 
portrayal of reality.  It's a small, well-written motion picture with 
modest ambitions.  We can believe that the three protagonists are 
brothers, and that their individual crises are actually happening.  
Nothing in THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN is so outlandish that it strains our 
credulity.  Unfortunately, Burns hasn't translated this quality to his 
latest film, SHE'S THE ONE, which opens with an implausible plot 
contrivance and struggles thereafter to get its feet on the ground.</P>
<P>     That contrivance is every romantic cabby's fantasy.  Mickey 
(Burns), the eldest of the two Fitzpatrick brothers, is driving his New 
York City taxi when he picks up a pretty fare, Hope (Maxine Bahns).  
During the short trip to the airport, they get to know each other, and, 
less than twenty-four hours later, they're married.  News of Mickey's 
sudden nuptials don't go over well with his father (John Mahoney), who 
thinks Hope is either an illegal alien or pregnant.  Mickey's younger 
brother, Francis (Mike McGlone), isn't too pleased with the situation, 
but he's too busy balancing his relationships with his wife, Renee 
(Jennifer Aniston) and his girlfriend, Heather (Cameron Diaz), to take 
much notice.  To further complicate matters, Heather, who was once 
engaged to Mickey, unexpectedly runs into her former beau and discovers 
that she's still attracted to him.</P>
<P>     While the brothers McMullen did their fair share of whining, they 
were still likable guys (even if they were clueless about women).  The 
brothers Fitzpatrick, on the other hand, are petulant, irritatingly 
arrogant, and combative.  They don't seem to like each other, or, for 
that matter, anyone else.  Their relationships with their lovers and 
spouses aren't warm, and there's something strained about the way they 
relate to their parents (despite being mentioned many times, their 
mother never makes an appearance).  None of this leads us to sympathize 
with either Mickey or Francis.</P>
<P>     Acting, like poor character identification, is another area where 
SHE'S THE ONE falls down.  With the exceptions of John Mahoney and 
Cameron Diaz, the performers fail to display significant range.  Burns 
is basically playing the same character he essayed in THE BROTHERS 
MCMULLEN.  Mike McGlone and Maxine Bahns, who were also in BROTHERS, 
don't impress, although McGlone has a better grasp of his role than 
Bahns, who seems confused by any scene requiring an expression of 
emotion.  Her real-life chemistry with Burns doesn't translate well to 
the screen.  Jennifer Aniston, known best for her role in the TV series 
FRIENDS, could generously be described as adequate -- the camera 
certainly doesn't love her plastic posturing.  When Diaz or Mahoney are 
in scenes with the others, the talent gap becomes apparent.</P>
<P>     The best thing about SHE'S THE ONE is the dialogue.  While there 
are juvenile stretches where Burns gets too cute, more than one scene 
features the same sparkling repartee that enlivened THE BROTHERS 
MCMULLEN.  Francis, on Mickey's taxi-driving lifestyle:  "That ain't a 
job -- it's an excuse to avoid reality."  Mr. Fitzpatrick, on his 
youngest son's affair:  "Let me get this straight -- you don't want to 
cheat on your girlfriend with your wife?"  And the old man's take on the 
lives of all three Fitzpatrick men:  "Here we are, crying in our beers, 
while our women are out living their lives."</P>
<P>     I'm sure there's an interesting story of sibling rivalry somewhere 
in SHE'S THE ONE, but Burns has cluttered it up with so much 
artificiality that it never gels.  Who really cares whether Francis and 
Mickey make peace with each other, or who ends up with what girl?  If 
these things mattered to us, SHE'S THE ONE would have been a success, 
but since they don't, it isn't.  Since New York only needs one Woody 
Allen, maybe for his next film, Burns will try stretching his thematic 
and geographical boundaries.  Otherwise, his promising film making 
career may already be in trouble.</P>
