<P>        Before I could even begin to write this review I had trouble trying 
to distinguish which genre to classify `The Matrix' as. Considering the basic 
premise of the film and the sheer title alone, it definitely falls under the 
science fiction category, yet there are a lot of other elements that make up 
this film such as action, adventure, fantasy and a helluva lot of deep 
philosophy. But that's what science fiction is, and this film completely and 
totally lives up to all aspects of the genre.</P>
<P>        It seems that many modern filmmakers have lost the concept `science 
fiction,' which is as simple as breaking down the phrase into its two words. 
But instead of taking elements of science and mathematics and bending them to 
tell a story, creators seem to be relying more heavily on recycling bits and 
pieces of works of the genre and not concentrating on the basic ideals of 
science plus fiction.</P>
<P>        `The Matrix' succeeds where other films have not because its creators 
demonstrate a vivid knowledge and personal experience with all aspects of 
sci-fi and how to make it poignant, interesting and thrilling for a 
mainstream audience.</P>
<P>        The premise of the film and its look is not unlike many of the best 
sci-fi works Hollywood has produced in the last few years. The art direction, 
production design and cinematography go to show that the film has many 
inspirations, thus the result is a movie that does not seem very familiar to 
any specific work or series. It seems more like a mathematical result of the 
absorption of every aspect of the genre.</P>
<P>        As the film opens it's clear we're about to be told a story of 
something relative to the world as we know it, but of course with a sci-fi 
spin on it. And what else could be more scientific and modern than computers? 
The first shot is of a black screen with a green, blinking cursor in the top 
left corner which seems to type automatically a message partially 
understandable and partially coded. Then there's a shot of dozens of rows of 
letters moving vertically up the screen while changing thousands of times per 
seconds and slowly a phone number is revealed. It's a simple trace of a call, 
but listening to the conversation it has a very eerie tone and gives the 
feeling that what the voices were referring to wasn't remotely simple and 
mundane.</P>
<P>        After a brief, but visually-stunning opening credits sequence, the 
real story begins. The filmmakers, Andy and Larry Wachowski who are former 
comic book writers, show us they've been paying attention to what it takes to 
create a neo-Gothic setting without it coming off as cliche horror or 
pretentious hardcore. There is a brief but violent scene of arrest in which 
the arrestee, a seemingly normal woman (Moss as Trinity), moves so quickly 
and powerfully it's unreal. Then there's a rather typical rooftop chase 
scene, but at the same time the establishment and the villains who are one 
and the same, are introduced, demonstrating their power and cold presence.</P>
<P>        Soon the real story begins to unfold which revolves around a computer 
hacker/working stiff named Thomas Anderson (Reeves) who goes by the alias 
`Neo' on-line. His introductory scene shows him being awaken at his bedside 
PC by words slowly appearing across the screen. It's as if the PC itself is 
talking to him and the message is very typical of a sci-fi/fantasy story, yet 
still interesting and moving. It's reminiscent of `2001' and `2010' where 
unknown, unseen intelligent sources manipulated man's technology. The overall 
theme of the film is much the same as Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke and 
Peter Hyams tried to evoke with those films.</P>
<P>        Neo is basically a loner who can tell that something is wrong with 
the world but can't put his finger on it. He's been searching for the hacker 
`Morpheus' (Fishburne), who has also been searching for him. When the two are 
finally introduced it's clear that the rest of the story about to unfold is 
not going to take place in the reality as we know it, or even one closely 
related to it.</P>
<P>        >>SPOILERS<<
        It turns out that everything in the world as it exists, or at least 
as Neo believes it does, was all the biggest conspiracy to ever be concocted 
in the history of time (probably the biggest ever conceived in a work of 
fiction). In a series of scenes in which Morpheus explains it all to Neo, 
we're told that sometime in the early 21st Century man invented artificial 
intelligence which it could not control and a massive war broke out between 
man and the machines. Man attempted to fight the machines by blocking out the 
sun, but machines eventually won the war and enslaved all mankind as energy 
sources whose brains have been plugged in to one giant virtual reality world 
known as the `matrix.' Absolutely no one in the matrix has any clue where 
they are, it's exactly the same as us in the real world as we know it to be 
told we're actually in a computer program.</P>
<P>        Morpheus also broadens the story (and thus the plot) but mentioning 
something about `Zion,' the last human city and that a man was born inside 
the matrix who prophesied the coming of `The One' who would free man from the 
machines. There is also reference to an `Oracle,' a psychic-like woman who 
will later tell Neo of his significance and will also make some other 
predictions about him that come true (sort of).</P>
<P>        And thus begins a story which is both simple and of epic proportions 
simultaneously. The conflict is as basic as good versus evil without many 
sub-plots or goals for the heroes to achieve besides beating the machines. 
Yet at the same time the Wachowski brothers go out of their way to continue 
to flesh-out the world they've fashioned and in the process create for 
numerous philosophies that are profound within the film's context, but many 
also carry over to the real world. </P>
<P>        For example, one of Morpheus's crew members says he liked `Tasty 
Wheat' when he was in the matrix, but wonders how the machines knew what it 
tastes like. For all he knows, what he's tasting is the taste of chicken, 
`which is why chicken tastes like everything,' he says. That might not seem 
too deep much beyond a one-liner but there is validity to it and many of the 
other philosophies dropped here and there carry much more weight.</P>
<P>        Another sign of the film's intelligence and originality is in the 
structuring of its story. The basic idea of a man coming to save mankind 
isn't anything new, that's what the entire Bible (and Judeo-Christian 
theology) is about. Most creators wouldn't dare try to make such a parallel 
within a story with such universal implications, but the Wachowski brothers 
are able to pull it off well here. They don't try very hard to disguise their 
symbols, though (`Neo' is an obvious anagram of `one,' as is `Morpheus' to 
`Push Rome.' The last human city is `Zion' which is a term for Heaven in the 
Bible. Other references: the character name Trinity, the ship Nebuchadnezzar, 
a Judas-like betrayal of the alleged savior... oh, and a slight case of 
resurrection).</P>
<P>        However, the film is not without its problems. It essentially has no 
middle act  as the first two-thirds of the film are spent explaining the 
reality and the concept of the matrix to Neo and his importance and his 
training, and all of a sudden a specific conflict is thrown in as Morpheus 
and his crew fall into grave danger because of a traitor. The last half hour 
is mostly a typical series of violent action sequences in the name of the 
ultimate good versus the ultimate evil.</P>
<P>        Even if the last act is somewhat of a cop-out it's no different than 
many other excellent sci-fi and fantasy films' climaxes (eh hem, >cough<, 
`Star Wars'). In fact, the Wachowski brothers don't seem to be taking the 
battle over the fate of the world too seriously because there's a hint of 
satire in the air. Most notably, the head of those really bad guys, a 
cyborg-like agent of the matrix itself, known only as `Agent Smith' (Weaving, 
who nails the role perfectly), speaks in a way that's soft and cold but 
almost to the point where it's cartoony (he almost sounds as if he's stoned 
or getting over a novacane injection). The fact that Agent Smith and the 
other agents all dress and look exactly alike with their sunglasses and suits 
is a cliche thrown in for the fun of it.</P>
<P>        Rumors indicate this film is only the first of a trilogy, but even if 
it's not, there's so much to the film that the viewer can conclude their own 
background elements and the long-term finale of the story.</P>
<P>        There's really nothing more satisfying than watching a film and 
getting the sense the creators are simply taking everything they've learned 
about the genre from tons of other similar works, drawing from them all and 
producing something new and original without coming off as trite and cliched. 
That's the feeling that comes with `The Matrix,' which is great because it 
doesn't rub off after the film is over. It's something to continually ponder 
how well so many elements were synchronized together to make for such an 
enjoyable piece of entertainment.                 </P>
