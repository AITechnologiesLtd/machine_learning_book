<PRE>Oscar & Lucinda</PRE>
<PRE>(Australia / USA 1997)</PRE>
<P>Have you even noticed the difference between vegetables that have been
boiled and those that have been steamed? Boiling leaves them recognizable
but drained of color and flavor; steaming makes the colors brighter, even
brighter than they were originally.</P>
<P>This, dear viewers, is the difference between *Oscar & Lucinda* and its
competition, the epic and ballyhooed *Titanic* and the enjoyable but
superficial *As Good As It Gets*. What exactly is it that is so wondrous
about *Oscar & Lucinda*? It's a confluence of  storytelling, music,
direction, and cinematography.</P>
<P>Set in the 1840s, the movie follows the title characters' lives from
childhood on. Oscar is the son of a hardened fundamentalist minister who
won't even refer to 25 December as Christmas because it's "papist!" and
smacks his son for eating Satan's fruit (Christmas pudding), in the bleak
but beautiful landscape of southern England. Lucinda grows up rather happy
in New South Wales, Australia. Through various adventures and growing
pains, they come to love God and gambling.</P>
<P>Ralph Fiennes is completely out of typecast here, looking less than
handsome as the nervous jittery Oscar, with his scarecrow appearance and
lack of haircut. Cate Blanchet is absolutely captivating as Lucinda, the
woman of independent means who buys a Sydney glassworks. She lights up
every scene she's in. It would be a cliche to say she is luminous, but she
is. Also wonderful are Tom Wilkinson (recently seen in *The Full Monty*) 
as the Anglican minister Hugh Stratton and Clive Russell as the strict
Theophilus, Oscar's father. </P>
<P>While some might find the story lacking, the music and the cinematography
are really extraordinary. Watching *Oscar & Lucinda* is like eating a ripe
fruit, or steam vegetable, and this is due to director Gillian Armstrong,
whose career has included *My Brilliant Career*, and more recently a
remake of *Little Women*--she's an Australian national treasure.</P>
<P>What we see is not the typical romance, but a true love story with vivid
characters doing things that are simply not acceptable in the 19th
century, and how they come to rely on each other. This is no ordinary
cookie-cutter romance with situation comedy e elements thrown in. If
anything, it's a situation tragedy with people who are 99.44% pure, and a
church that floats. While there are some slow moments and uninteresting
subplots, Oscar and Lucinda is anything but typical, and the turns it
takes are real, and moving, and shown with a strong sense of empathy. </P>
<P>Based on the novel by Peter Carey; screenplay by Laura Jones.
Cinematography by Geoffrey Simpson, music by Thomas Newman. </P>
