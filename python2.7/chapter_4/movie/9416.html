<P>starring the voices of: Kevin Conroy (Bruce Wayne/Batman), Dana Delany
(Andrea Beaumont), Mark Hamill (The Joker), Stacey Keach Jr. (Carl Beaumont,
The Phantasm), Hart Bochner (Arthur Reeves), written by Alan Burnett, Paul
Dini, Martin Pasko, Michael Reaves, produced by Benjamin Melniker, Michael
Uslan, directed by Eric Radomski, Bruce W. Timm, based on characters
appearing in DC comics, Batman created by Bob Kane.</P>
<P>"Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm" is a pretty exciting film that could have
been terrific if it just didn't try so hard. It's a serious, mature story
trapped in the spirit of cartoon adventure.</P>
<P>The immediate style, design, and animation here is overwhelming. As the
opening credits fade in and out over a computer generated animation scene,
the Gothic, art deco mood is established quickly. The film wastes no time and
getting in some action as we witness Batman (Conroy) crash a counterfeiting
scheme and single-handedly disarm a half dozen men. The lead gangster
escapes, but he is confronted in the parking garage by, what appears to be a
phantasm. This phantasm seems invincible; bullets, and even getting hit by a
car doesn't seem to stop it, and thus kills him.</P>
<P>This first scene, and the entire first act really held my attention. I liked
this Batman much better than those in the live action movies. He seems much
more realistic fighting "high level" criminals instead of costumed nut jobs.
The fact he uses some actual detective skills makes the film seem original
and even a bit realistic. </P>
<P>The story does not follow a linear order, it constantly engages in
flashbacks to make things interesting and bit complex. Unfortunately, many
plot holes, continuity errors, and just plain corny scenes result from this
storytelling style.</P>
<P>Batman slowly puts the pieces together concerning the phantasm murders, but
Bruce Wayne is distracted as by the return of an old lover, Andrea Beaumont
(Delany). We get a tremendous amount of back story concerning his
relationship with Andrea and her father's involvement with the gangsters. In
fact, the back story often takes precedence over the main story, and at times
it seems both are happening at the same time. These flashback scenes also
tend to run on longer than they need to, and as the story shifted back to the
present, I sometimes forgot what the main story was about.</P>
<P>A gangster who thinks Batman is murdering mob bosses (and soon him), hires
The Joker (Hamill) to exterminate Batman. Mark Hamill is hilarious as the
Joker's voice, but the character's presence doesn't seem essential to this
story. This fact, along with the entire ending is a total cop-out.</P>
<P>There are a lot of things in "Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm" that could have
made for a great film instead of the satisfactory one it is. The actual
breakdown of the story is choppy and often distracting. I liked it for what
it was, but I didn't like it for what it was trying to be. </P>
