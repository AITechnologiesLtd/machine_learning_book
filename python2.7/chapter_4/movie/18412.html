 Trekkies (1999) 4 stars out of 4. A documentary directed by Roger Nygard.</P>
<P> If you know the name of the bit actor who played the red-shirted security
officer zapped within the first minute of episode eight of the second
season, or if you can speak Klingon, than "Trekkies" is your kind of movie.</P>
<P> "Trekkies," directed by Roger Nygard, is a documentary about one of the
largest fan phenomenons in pop culture.</P>
<P> And the truly amazing aspect of Nygard's look at some of these eccentric
people is that he treats them with respect.</P>
<P> How easy it would have been to make a documentary mocking the obsession of
these fanatics. Instead, Nygard displays an affection for them. His
approach is non-judgmental.</P>
<P> The movie has no narration; these people speak for themselves.</P>
<P> Our guide through this strange world is Denise Crosby, who serves as the
film's co-executive producer, and who played Lt. Tasha Yar on "Star Trek:
The Next Generation" before deciding to leave the show.</P>
<P> Crosby takes us into the conventions, the homes and workplaces of people
and families to whom "Star Trek" is more than a television series.</P>
<P> In "Trekkies" we meet such people as Barbara Adams of Little Rock, Ark.
Adams had been chosen for jury duty in the Whitewater trial and wore her
Starfleet uniform every day.</P>
<P> Some people may consider such behavior odd, but, as Adams sincerely
explains, as Lt. Cmdr. Barbara Adams she never leaves home without her rank
pips, tricorder, phaser and communicator badge.</P>
<P> Adams has embraced the philosophy of "Star Trek" and lives her life
accordingly. We see her at various "Star Trek" conventions signing
autographs. Because of the publicity affored her by wearing her uniform to
the trial, she has become a minor celebrity in her own right, admired by
others for her convictions.</P>
<P> Then there is Dr. Denis Bourguignon, an Orlando, Fla., dentist whose
office has a "Star Trek" theme. He and his entire staff wear "Star Trek"
uniforms, and his office is a treasure trove of "Trek" memorabilia.</P>
<P> "Trekkies" may elicit some rather odd reactions. At first you may feel
embarrassed for some of these people. You laugh or chuckle, maybe even
mentally ridicule them. You think to yourself that you wouldn't want to be
caught dead in the same room with them.</P>
<P> But as you watch and listen, a feeling of understanding and respect and
possibly even a bit of admiration creeps into your psyche. They may be
different, but they are principaled and decent human beings.</P>
<P> They are devoted individuals who have found a purpose in "Star Trek."</P>
<P> And that is this documentary's greatest asset. Cast members from the
various "Star Trek" series and films are included and they speak with awe
and great affection of their fans.</P>
<P> Even William Shatner, who mocked them years ago in a famous "Saturday
Night Live' sketch in which he told the Trekkies to "get a life," speaks of
his regard for these individuals.</P>
<P> "Trekkies" is a warm, enjoyable experience, as cuddly as a tribble and as
refreshing as a cup of tea - Earl Grey.</P>
