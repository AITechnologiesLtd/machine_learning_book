<P>Plot: Anthropologist Ted Harrison returns from an expedition to India 
and goes to stay in a caravan out the back of his sister Janet's house. 
But while away Ted was attacked and gored by a werewolf and each night 
transforms into a werewolf, handcuffing himself to a tree in the woods 
to restrain the wolf. But Janet's dog Thor takes a dislike to this 
invader in its domain and a territorial dispute between the two ensues.</P>
<P>Eric Red wrote two of the best horror films of the 1980s - `The Hitcher' 
(1986) and `Near Dark' (1987). Since then Red has progressed to become 
director of his own material with the kidnap thriller `Cohen and Tate' 
(1988), the horror film `Body Parts' (1991), the thriller `Undertow' 
(1996), and this. None of Red's directorial efforts are bad films by any 
means. But the relative failure of any of them to set the movie-making 
world alight either with directorial panache or dazzling innovation 
leave one with the increasing suspicion that the successes of `The 
Hitcher' and `Near Dark' belonged more to the bravura style that their 
respective directors brought to the projects than any native talent upon 
the part of Red.</P>
<P>`Bad Moon' is a werewolf film. Red offers a rather amusing spin on the 
theme - that of the werewolf and the dog of the household squaring off 
in a dispute over whose territory the place is. And Red conducts it 
quite competently directorially - he even manages to get a performance 
of sorts out of the usually wooden Michael Pare. But it is just that in 
many other aspects the film disappoints and leaves you wondering just 
how much more it could have been. Part of the problem here is its length 
- a surprisingly short 80 minutes which leaves it feeling dramatically 
rather slight. Red barely sets up the situation than he seems to almost 
cursorily jump to the climactic showdown. One cannot help but think 
another whole middle act would have filled the film out to a far more 
dramatically satisfying whole.</P>
<P>The most disappointing aspect of the film are the werewolf effects. It 
is not that there is anything wrong with them - they are technically 
impeccable and have an impressive fluidity of movement. But the end 
effect is thoroughly unconvincing - the werewolf looks like one of those 
plastic Classic Creature kitset models. And any effectiveness is 
considerably undercut by the actual transformation scenes which resort 
to cheap and unconvincing morphing effects. I am becoming increasingly 
of the opinion that the morph is a special effect that has run its 
course. For all the innovation in digital effects technology that 
`Terminator 2: Judgment Day' introduced in 1991 with the morph there 
have been a bare handful of films which have justifiably used it since - 
organic shapes simply do not transform with the fluidity of a morph. But 
for the sake of cost-effectiveness the morph now seems to have now 
supplanted air-bladder transformation effects. But despite such classic 
physical makeup effects films like `The Howling', `An American Werewolf 
in London', `The Thing' and `Fright Night' still retain an infinitely 
greater edge over the eminently forgettable digital effects 
transformations in films like this and `From Dusk Till Dawn'.</P>
