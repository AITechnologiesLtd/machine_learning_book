Eight Men Out (1988)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 87</PRE>
<P>"Eight Men Out" tells the story of the Black Sox scandal,
the 1919 Chicago White Sox baseball team that threw that
year's World Series.  The film has the over-riding message
that greed is the root of all evil: stingy owners, corrupt
players, and cynical gamblers chase dollars, forfeiting their
future for a brighter present.  Only the sportswriters and
the fans are honest.</P>
<P>The players' owner is Charles Comiskey (Clifton James).  He is 
notoriously stingy, paying starvation wages, and welching on player 
bonuses.  When the team reaches the World Series, the players are 
given flat champagne to celebrate.  This fuels resentment among the
players that makes them susceptible to the influence of gamblers.</P>
<P>There are several very interesting characters in "Eight Men
Out."  The kingpin gambler Arnold Rothstein (Michael Lerner) 
carries a chip on his shoulder against athletes.  This is the result
of ridicule he faced as a child when trying to play sports.  He 
seeks revenge by fixing sports events and taking the profits, but
no amount of money will satisfy his resentment.</P>
<P>Christoper Lloyd also plays a gambler, a former pitcher looking
for a big score.  For once his role is not eccentric.
Once the fix is in, the gamblers get greedy and stop paying off
the players.  "It's all out on bets" is their favorite line.</P>
<P>Several of the Chicago players are in on the fix but play their
best anyway, leaving it to starting pitcher Eddie Cicotte (David 
Straithairn) to throw the games. In the film, I count six World 
Series games that Eddie starts. Web research indicates that 
Lefty Williams pitched and lost three series games but is portrayed 
at that position in the film. Perhaps the two characters were 
essentially combined for dramatic purposes.  Another inaccuracy is 
that the players are tried and suspended apparently during the 
offseason, when in fact they played much of the 1920 season.</P>
<P>The director focuses on one player in particular, and 
surprisingly it isn't Joe Jackson, the most famous of the 
Black Sox players.  The spotlight is often on Buck Weaver
(John Cusack) instead, perhaps because his character is
more eloquent than the simpleton Jackson.  Cusack has several
scenes hanging with kid fans that don't seem completely
credible.</P>
<P>Despite its minor weaknesses, "Eight Men Out" is an excellent
film that demonstrates a love of baseball and the corruption
of character that occurs with greed.</P>
