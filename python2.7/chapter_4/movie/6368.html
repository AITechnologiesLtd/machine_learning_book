<PRE>                                THE FUNERAL
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: In large part this is an old
          fashioned anti-crime morality tale.  Abel Ferrara
          does some of his best directorial work to date in
          this story of a family of three gangster brothers.
          When the youngest of the brothers is murdered and
          eldest has to avenge the crime, the family begins
          to disintegrate.  The dark piece of cinema, in tone
          and in lighting, looks at each of the three
          brothers, each with his own viewpoint on violence
          and in an odd way his own brand of idealism.  This
          is a violent film, occasionally graphically.
          Rating: +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     In 1936 the Tempio brothers are three small-time criminal
enforcers, first generation immigrants from Italy. Ray (played by
Christopher Walken) is by default the patriarch of the family and
controls the others with a heavy hand.  He is quiet and introspective.
Chez (Chris Penn) is volatile and given to short emotional bursts.  The
youngest was Johnny (Vincent Gallo) who developed a social conscience
and was leaning toward the Communists whose meetings he had visited.  I
say "was" since as the film opens Johnny is being brought into the
house of his brother Ray in a coffin.  Johnny has been murdered and Ray
knows that it is his job to track down the murderer.  This is not
directly for revenge, but because in the philosophy he has been taught
the killer has to eliminate anyone who might be coming after him in
vengeance.  These are the Old Country values that at the age of
thirteen back in Italy Ray was told he must learn to run the family
when his father died.  His responsibilities at that young age included
the cold-blooded execution of a family enemy.  So Ray and Chez must
find out who killed their twenty-two-year-old younger brother.  The
story is told in present action and in extended flashbacks.  The
screenplay by Nicholas St. John delves into the forging of the violent
family with scenes from Ray's childhood and the action in the month or
so leading up to the killing of Johnny.  It also shows how the violence
of the family poisons each remaining brother's family life.  Ray is
married to Jeanette (Annabella Sciorra), as intelligent as her husband
and just as assertive.  She rages against the pain while Chez's wife
Clara (Isabella Rossellini) quietly bears all.  THE FUNERAL is like a
de-romanticized THE GODFATHER on a smaller scale, and often with more
believable conflict and more realistic dialogue.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the biggest surprise of the film was Vincent Gallo's
performance. He plays with a certain tension just beneath the surface
and has a lively performance style and an unforgettable--not to say
"homely"--face. The face and style remind one of the early performances
of John Turturro.  Director Abel Ferrara probably has some of the best
performances of any of his films in THE FUNERAL.  He has overcome some
of the self-indulgent over-acting in films like MS. 45.  Some of the
most effective performances come from the actresses playing the two
wives, Annabella Sciorra and Isabella Rossellini, reacting differently
as they see their lives unraveling as their husbands are pulled into
the events that follow the killing.  Only Christopher Walken, in the
top-billed role, seems a trifle too reserved for the proceedings.</P>
<P>     Nicholas St. John's screenplay has some nice touches.  Each of the
brothers has his own style of idealism and his feeling of how things
ought to be.  These interpretations are based in large part on each's
views of Catholicism and each's responsibility to the family.  Ferrara
has a penchant for melodrama and this film has it, though it has always
been hard to do a gangster films without a least some melodrama.
Ferrara is a sort of outsider as a filmmaker.  He was not aiming at
making one of the great gangster classics, he just wanted to tell a
superficially simple story and create some characters of some depth.
This is not an ambitious film, but there certainly are some nice
touches.  I would give it a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
