<PRE>     Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson=85 =20</PRE>
<P>     Matt Reeves' THE PALLBEARER is loaded with none-to-subtle=20
references to Mike Nichols' 1967 classic, THE GRADUATE.  The problem is=20
that this mediocre toast to the past has lost its fizz, resulting in a=20
bland concoction that's as devoid of originality as it is of warmth and=20
humor. =20</P>
<P>     Oh, there are occasionally funny moments, but those are outnumbered=20
by instances when THE PALLBEARER makes its audience feel uncomfortable. =20
There is a funereal atmosphere, and even the most "lighthearted" scenes=20
are handled with a heavy hand.  This is the most grim comedy since=20
MURIEL'S WEDDING, but THE PALLBEARER is neither as well-written nor as=20
deftly directed.</P>
<P>     Only in the movies could a guy like David Schwimmer find himself=20
the romantic target of both Gwyneth Paltrow and Barbara Hershey. =20
Schwimmer plays Tom Thomas, a directionless, post-college architect=20
who's looking for a job, financial independence, and a way out of him=20
mother's house.  One day, Tom gets a phone call from a distressed woman,=20
Ruth Abernathy (Hershey), who wants Tom to be a pallbearer at her son's=20
funeral.  Tom doesn't remember the dead guy, but, unable to refuse a=20
crying woman, he agrees.  Meanwhile, Julie DeMarco (Paltrow), a high=20
school classmate Tom had a crush on, moves back to town, and he=20
convinces her to go out with him.  Complications arise when his attempts=20
to comfort Ruth develop into a sexual relationship, and Tom finds=20
himself caught between two women.</P>
<P>     There are some cute scenes between Schwimmer and Paltrow, but the=20
pairing with Hershey doesn't generate any heat or pathos.  Two of the=20
characters in the film, Tom's Mom (played by Carol Kane) and his best=20
friend, Brad (Michael Rapaport), are irritating beyond belief.  Rapaport=20
(BEAUTIFUL GIRLS) is normally annoying, so this is no surprise, but Kane=20
(THE PRINCESS BRIDE) is typically likable.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, the real problem is that THE PALLBEARER is a real=20
downer -- and it's more than just the title.  From the dark=20
cinematography, glum tone, and stagnant humor to the uninspired=20
direction, there aren't many reasons to like this film.  While it's not=20
a terrible example of movie making, it represents a clear picture of=20
mediocrity, and those hoping to see a '90s version of THE GRADUATE will=20
be disappointed.  THE PALLBEARER doesn't have what it takes to make the=20
grade.</P>
