<PRE>_Bride_of_Chucky_ (R) * 1/2
_John_Carpenter's_Vampires_ (R) * 1/2</PRE>
<P>In 1988, killer doll Chucky made his splash in _Child's_Play_; in 1978,
director John Carpenter burst onto the horror scene with _Halloween_.  Ten
and twenty years later, respectively, neither Chucky's novelty nor
Carpenter's horror skill have aged very well, as evidenced by the schlocky
_Bride_of_Chucky_ and _John_Carpenter's_Vampires_.</P>
<P>Unlike eating a box of chocolates, walking into the movie
_Bride_of_Chucky_, you're pretty sure what you're gonna get.  For the
fourth film in the _Child's_Play_ franchise, you pay your admission to see
Chucky, the diminutive, redheaded "Good Guy" doll possessed by the spirit
of a dead serial killer, slice and dice his way through a long line of
human victims--no more, no less, all done somewhat tongue-in-cheek but
largely done in the name of a good scare.</P>
<P>How surprising it is, then, to watch _Bride_, which plays less like
another sequel than a Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker sendup of the series.  Perhaps
writer Don Mancini (the creator of the series) saw self-parody as the only
way to keep Chucky alive in the irony-drenched post-_Scream_ horror
climate, making free use of self-deprecating dialogue such as "Chucky?
He's so '80s!"  The plot itself is a joke, with Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), a
former flame of the incarnate Chucky, becoming Chucky the doll's (voiced by
Brad Dourif) partner in serial murder after her newly-liberated spirit
inhabits a female doll.</P>
<P>All of the added humor, though, does not make _Bride_of_Chucky_ a good
film--just a campy one.  For all their irony, post-_Scream_ thrillers, in
the end, are horror films, going after the big scare.  _Bride_, however,
makes no attempt to be scary; the scariest thing about it is the fact that
it was directed by the gifted Ronny Yu, who in his native Hong Kong
directed the brilliant 1993 action fantasy _The_Bride_with_White_Hair_.  As
gruesome as some of Chucky and Tiffany's murders are (for instance, one
man's face becomes a pincushion for nails), they are too over-the-top to
truly shock.  In fact, the film's big problem is just that, being too
over-the-top too much of the time, from the acting (the dreadful Tilly in
particular) to story developments (yes, a doll-doll sex scene is funny, but
_still_...).  Even a film called _Bride_of_Chucky_ could use some restraint
and be all the better for it.  By the time the film came to its predictable
"twist" ending (hint: what logically follows "_bride_ of..."?), you may eel
like groaning.  The audience with whom I saw the film did (and quite
loudly, I might add).</P>
<P>That's all _Bride_of_Chucky_ leaves you with--a groan: a groan that this
tired series may not yet be over; a groan that you blew hard-earned cash to
see it; but most of all, a groan that you've just lost 80-some-odd minutes
of your life that can never be recovered.</P>
<P>More polished technically, but no less groan-worthy, is _Vampires_.
Carpenter obviously has a lot of fun at the helm of this one, staging the
brutally (and, some would argue, excessively) bloody scenes of carnage with
gleeful abandon: blood, bodies, and body parts fly across the screen in
every direction.  A great deal of credit goes to the make-up work by the
KNB EFX Group (Robert Kurtzman, Gregory Nicotero, and Howard Berger), which
is convincing and, yes, more than a little repulsive.</P>
<P>So what's the problem?  Just about everything else, but mostly Don
Jakoby's odious script, which is based on John Steakley's novel _Vampire$_.
 There's no real plot, just vampire slayer Jack Crow (James Woods) hunting
out master vampire Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), who is after a sacred cross
that will make him and his fellow bloodsuckers, as Crow's priest sidekick
(Tim Guinee) says, "a force unstoppable--unless we stop him!"  That line,
which would make the late Ed Wood proud, should tell you all you need to
know about the overall quality of the dialogue.</P>
<P>But the laughable dialogue and lack of plot isn't as problematic as the
uninteresting and unlikable characters.  For someone who was raised by the
Catholic church after his parents died when he was young, Jack is awfully
disrespectful, tossing around priests, threatening them with mortal
violence, and frequently flinging F-words at them.  Woods's insufferably
smug performance makes the character even more unsavory.  In addition to
being anti-Catholic, the film is also terribly misogynist, with female
lead, a Valek-bitten prostitute named Katrina (Sheryl Lee, reduced to
screaming and trembling), constantly getting slapped around and humiliated
by Jack's boorish partner Tony Montoya (Daniel Baldwin, who, quite simply,
sucks--bad pun intended).  Even more insulting?  Tony eventually falls for
Katrina, and--yep--her with him.</P>
<P>Like _Bride_of_Chucky_, I'm certain a number of _Vampires_'s laughs are
intentional; Carpenter has always displayed an arch sense of humor, and
that comes through in certain scenes, including the ridiculous resolution
scene.  But I'm not so sure so much of it was meant to be laughed at; two
women sitting behind me at the screening understandably laughed non-stop.
The most disheartening thing about _Vampires_, however, is not its
campiness, but its lack of scares; it's hard to believe the same man who
made the elegantly creepy (and largely bloodless) classic _Halloween_
directed this piece of schlock.  </P>
