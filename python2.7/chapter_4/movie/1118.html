<PRE>                               THE COMMITMENTS
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  The setting upstages the plot in this
     story of a group of working-class (or dole-class) Dubliners
     who form a rock band.  Seeing all those Irish singing and
     immersing themselves in American popular music has a sort of
     whimsical irony akin to that of THE SINGING NUN.  But somehow
     a film set in this interesting city could focus on something
     more meaningful than its music.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     Alan Parker has been a new filmmaker for eighteen years now through at
least ten major films.  The way he remains a new filmmaker is by making a
clean break with the past and jumping off in a new direction every film he
makes.  The man made BUGSY MALONE, MIDNIGHT EXPRESS, FAME, SHOOT THE MOON,
PINK FLOYD: THE WALL, BIRDY, ANGEL HEART, MISSISSIPPI BURNING, COME SEE THE
PARADISE, and now THE COMMITMENTS.  At least superficially it is hard to
find any sort of pattern in these films.  This time around he is doing a
bittersweet adaptation of Roddy Doyle's novel about the life and times of
Dublin (Ireland)'s first soul band.  The idea of an Irish band doing soul
makes sense to the band's manager Jimmy Rabbitte (played by Robert Arkins)
since he sees himself not just once but triply black.  As he says, the Irish
are the blacks of Europe, the Dubliners are the blacks of Ireland, and the
northern Dubliners are the blacks of Dublin.  So he pulls together a band of
North Dubliners willing to say they are black and proud of it.</P>
<P>     As the film opens, Rabbitte is a hustler of cheap cassettes and T-
shirts.  His father places Elvis Presley just a bit lower than God and a bit
higher than the Pope.  With this minimal musical background, after pulling
together a rather poor band for a wedding he is struck by the raw singing
talent of a drunken guest who grabs the mike and starts belting out a song.
With this dubious inspiration he starts to put together a band to feature
the singing of Deco Cuffe (played by sixteen-year-old Andres Strong).  In
addition to Cuffe he finds an off-the-wall drummer, a frustrated jazz
musician, and a forty-five-year-old trumpeter who may or may not have played
with just about all the American greats.  He also finds three feisty female
backup singers.  From there it is a toss-up if this mismatched group will
tear itself apart or become a phenomenon.</P>
<P>     The real stars of this film are the music (big surprise) and the hard-
edged working-class (and lower) settings in northern Dublin.  One might say
that the view of living conditions in Ireland--with far too many filthy
children and with so many of the adults on the dole--by far upstages the
foreground story.  (This may be more true for me than for other viewers
because I do not really know soul music particularly well.  I may have
missed some of the jokes.  On the other hand, a top-of-the-lung belting out
of "Try a Little Tenderness" may not have been intended to be as humorous as
I found it.)</P>
<P>     Some of the humor was a bit derivative and no longer as funny as it
might have been.  The humorous audition montage is getting over-used after
SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT, THE PRODUCERS, (the underrated) SOUP FOR ONE, and
Robert Kline's (hilarious) "New National Anthem Auditions" routine.  The
realism of the film is undermined to very little positive effect by a pair
of twins who always speak in unison.</P>
<P>     THE COMMITMENTS is a film that us amusing at times and well-textured,
but one in which I strongly recommend looking around the characters and
watching instead the scenery.  For me the film rate a +1 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
