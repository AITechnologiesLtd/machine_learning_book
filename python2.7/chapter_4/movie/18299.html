<P>American History X is the story of one man's redemption in a world where
you can't dance with the devil and be left unscathed.   The film boasts
many meaningful - if not fascinating - social-political insights, but
one scene puts everything into perspective.  You'll know it if you see
it; it's a moment that is as moving and disturbing as Spike Lee at his
best.  Debut director Tony Kaye looks at a profound evil, making it
accessible through characters with radical but understandable views.
Labeling these characters as simply "Neo-Nazis" or "racists" doesn't
give them the depth they require.  In the case of American History X,
the two protagonists are people who have been dealt a rough hand in
life.  In no way does this excuse the sins of the past, but Kaye knows
that - and this unforgiving but sympathetic view on American society is
why American History X succeeds in packing a powerful emotional punch
when it goes in for the kill.</P>
<P>Derek Vineyard (Edward Norton) has just been released from prison after
serving a three-year sentence for killing two black men during an
attempted car theft. On the day of Derek's return, his younger brother
Danny (Edward Furlong) is assigned by his school principal (Avery
Brooks) to write a special essay on the events that led to his
incarceration.  Before his jail sentence, Derek was an eccentric
Neo-Nazi leader whose racist views were spawned after his father was
killed by a black man. Whilst serving time Derek became friends with a
black man, and slowly realized the error of his ways.  When he is back
on the streets his primary concern is to save Danny from following the
same ill-fated path as he.  But after taking a strong moral stance,
Derek's life is in jeopardy by vengeful African Americans and the group
of which he was once a leader.</P>
<P>Derek's drastic change in personality is surprisingly very believable,
thanks largely to Edward Norton's Academy Award nominated performance.
In 1996's Primal Fear, Norton brandished his character with an evil but
simultaneously sympathetic edge, and here he does a similar trick but on
a different level.  Norton projects a performance that is frightfully
realistic - unflinching and unrelenting, he's an actor that will have
you shifting in your seat.  Derek, as a character, is also frightfully
real.  The scariest thing about him is not the Neo-Nazism symbol
tattooed on his chest, nor his menacing shaved head appearance.  It is
that his racist views begin to make sense.  A passionate believer in
white supremacy, Derek is no Pauline Hanson - for every bit of fear he
generates through his appearance, an equal amount is matched through
what he says and how he says it.  At a time of emotional struggle, Derek
is asked a painful question: "has anything you've done made your life
better?"  He shakes his head whilst refraining from crying, knowing that
the path to redemption is much more difficult to walk down than the path
to evil.</P>
<P>Like the surprise hit Pleasantville, American History X slightly
sensationalizes and simplifies its themes so that all audiences can
respond to them.  For the most part it works well, but the film does
become sentimental in its final moments, and that's a notable mistake.
In a film about a cold and unforgiving world, why have a warm ending?
Perhaps this is what led Tony Kaye to publicly denounce the film,
stating that the final product did not reflect his original version.
Whilst one can only wonder what changes Kaye was upset about, American
History X is one of the finest American offerings so far this year.
Rather than opting for singular disturbing scenes or characters, the
film crafts a powerful and disquieting view on society in general.
Don't be put off by the title - American History X has universal
meaning.  It's a film that will linger in your mind and force you to
reevaluate the term "racism."</P>
