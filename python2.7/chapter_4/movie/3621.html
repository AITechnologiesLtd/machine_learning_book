<PRE>                                 FORGET PARIS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     It's a shame that so many romantic comedies are in current release,
because inevitably, something good is going to be overlooked due to the
cinematic glut of warm fuzzies.  As the third of its type in about as many
weeks, FORGET PARIS is one of the strongest entries of the genre.</P>
<P>     Billy Crystal directs and stars in this Baby Boomer romantic fable
about a pair of star-crossed lovers (Crystal, as Mickey, and Debra Winger,
as Ellen) who can't seem to get their relationship right.  Going through a
dozen iterations of "boy meets girl, boy loses girl," the couple's story
is told through a narrative from their friends over dinner.</P>
<P>     Mickey is a tempestuous basketball referee (and some of the film's
funniest moments are with him on the courts with the
players--unfortunately, they have been overplayed ad nauseum in the film's
trailers).  Ellen is the newly found love of his life, an American
expatriate working in Paris for an airline which loses Mickey's dead
father, who is being flown to France for his burial.</P>
<P>     What follows is Woody Allen-esque hilarity.  The couple really click
and finally get together.  Ellen leaves Paris to be with Mickey.  Mickey
quits his traveling ref job to be with Ellen.  Ellen's father moves in. 
No one is happy, and one thing after another conspires against our tragic
couple to keep things from getting better.  The bulk of the film is their
various attempts at working things out, none of which seem to work.</P>
<P>     Crystal and Winger (cast against type and pulling it off well) have
some great chemistry, and they play off each other perfectly with
characteristic sarcasm.  Using the friends as a narrative plot device is
weak, but it is understated enough not to distract you from the rest of
the picture.</P>
<P>     As a romance, FORGET PARIS is hauntingly realistic and downright
hilarious, and although it gets a bit silly in places (as is expected when
Crystal is around), it doesn't flinch in showing you the unglamorous flip
side to the Hollywood Ending.  I'd wager that most of the audience will
leave the theater with a "been there, done that" sentiment that balances
the comedy perfectly.  Don't miss it.</P>
