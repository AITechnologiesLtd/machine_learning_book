<P>The "World-In-Jeopardy-By-Satan" genre has gone into overplay in the last 
couple years, offering viewers so many vague variations on the same subject 
that it has long-since grown tiresome. Acquiring a shooting gallery of 
pop-religious mumbo-jumbo, it seems present-day producers who grew up with 
the spooky likes of 1968's "Rosemary's Baby" and 1973's "The Exorcist" have 
no idea how to write a believable, involving story. Look no further than 
1999's "Stigmata," 1999's "End of Days," and 2000's "Bless the Child" to find 
pure rubbish disguised as something more stylized and intellectual.</P>
<P>"Lost Souls," the directorial debut of brilliant cinematographer Janusz 
Kaminski (1999's "Saving Private Ryan"), is the latest entry in the "end of 
the world" cinematic sweepstakes, and, surprisingly enough, it is a stylish 
and purely adult psychological thriller that pays respect, rather than 
tarnishes, its worlds-of-old predecessors. </P>
<P>Winona Ryder stars as Maya Larkin, a Catholic school teacher who has devoted 
her life to religion and helping others ever since she was possessed by a 
demonic spirit several years before. As the film opens, she is called upon by 
Father Lereaux (John Hurt) to act as an assistant in an exorcism he plans to 
perform on family-man-turned-serial-killer Henry Birdson (John Diehl). 
Although they fail to save Henry, Maya does uncover a series of numbers Henry 
wrote, and after carefully decoding them, discovers the name of Peter Kelson 
(Ben Chaplin), who happens to be a best-selling true-crime novelist living in 
Manhattan with his girlfriend (Sarah Wynter). It seems that the faithless 
Peter is set to become the antichrist on his 33rd-birthday and take over the 
world, even though he doesn't know it yet.</P>
<P>Moving at a deliberately slow pace, and free of any sort of MTV-style film 
cuts or false alarm scare sequences, "Lost Souls" is a refreshing throwback 
to the days when a horror film didn't have to rely on a mad slasher chasing 
teenagers around a house, or a cat jumping out of a closet, in order to be 
scary. That said, "Lost Souls" has its heart in the right place, but still 
isn't very frightening. Disturbing? Yes. The ingenious idea of an innocent 
man who gradually comes to find out that he will soon be transformed into the 
antichrist is cause for several thought-provoking, evocative notions, but the 
movie doesn't gain the momentum to become downright scary. In director Janusz 
Kaminski's attempt at making a horror picture that is somehow "above" all the 
other recent efforts, he has, perhaps, gone too far in the opposite 
direction, causing this film to be too glacial to be completely touching.</P>
<P>At 28-years-old, Winona Ryder (1999's "Girl, Interrupted") is still the same 
captivating presence that she has always been, and the ability she has to 
capture the screen every time she appears is quite remarkable. Ryder is 
earnest and likable as Maya Larkin, even when we, as an audience, are unsure 
if she is possibly going crazy herself, and she holds the film together even 
through its questionable patches. Meanwhile, Ben Chaplin (1998's "The Thin 
Red Line") starts off blandly, but becomes enthralling by the final act, as a 
man who can't quite believe the tragic things Maya tells him, but can't deny 
that some very strange things are occurring to him, as well. All supporting 
roles are filled by powerful veteran actors, none of which are given much 
material to work with: John Hurt (1998's "Love and Death on Long Island") is 
Father Lereaux; the incomparable Philip Baker Hall (1999's "Magnolia") is 
Peter's girlfriend's religious father; and Alfre Woodard appears unbilled as 
a strong-willed worker at the psychiatric ward where the possessed Henry 
Birdson resides.</P>
<P>For the majority of its 94-minute running time, "Lost Souls" left me 
wondering exactly where everything was going, and I feared it wouldn't add up 
to much, joining the rest of the recent ill-fated attempts at a 
religious-themed thriller. Moving slowly throughout and with few truly 
astounding scenes beforehand, the ending blindsided me. Without giving it 
away, what occurs is not at all what you would expect, yet it is really one 
of the few honest ways to conclude the story, downbeat or not. Its final 
scene is challenging and fairly equivocal, casting a whole new light on 
everything that had come before. By taking his times and building to a 
fateful climax, Kaminski has realized that the most riveting films are not 
those with non-stop action and a scare a minute, but the ones that ask for 
its audience to slowly get involved and open up their minds, in exchange for 
an ultimately rewarding experience. Kaminski may not hold a firm grip on the 
picture the whole way through, but he does conclude on an unexpectedly high 
note that questions life, faith, and one's mortality. In other words, fans of 
the recently reissued "The Exorcist" will be impressed. Fans of "Leprechaun 
in the Hood" will decidedly not be.</P>
