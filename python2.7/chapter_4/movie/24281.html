<P>   Being able to walk and chew gum at the same time is all
very nice, but multitasking is getting out of hand.  People
can't walk in the street any more without drinking their
morning coffee while simultaneously talking on their cell
phones, and carrying backpacks loaded with survival
equipment (bottled water and the like) more suited to
camping trips than subway rides to the office.  People read
magazines in restaurants while chomping on food they have
not looked at, they cruise the web and they watch pictures
within pictures on TV.  The decade from 2000 to 2009 could
be called the time of "The Unfocused Generation."</P>
<P>   Mike Figgis now makes matters worse.  Apparently
believing that we in the movie audience cannot sit still to
watch a story, he divides his screen into four quadrants, with
each telling a part of the story during four 93-minute takes
filmed digitally in real time without editing.  He splashes the
sections across the screen, each showing characters involved
in actions in separate areas from the others, but all taking
place in and around an L.A. movie studio building.  The
performers move from cell to cell, each improvising the lines,
because Figgis gives the talent only a broad outline and lets
everyone loose to ham up a paltry story.  We might wonder
whether the experimental photography, involving digital tech
that is supposed to be the wave of the near future, is
designed simply to distract the audience from a banal non-
script, just as Emperor Commodus gave his Romans bread
and circuses to divert them from his tyranny and his designs
on a popular general.</P>
<P>   The story takes place in the area of Sunset Boulevard. In
opening scene which thankfully takes place in only one
quadrant, Emma (Saffron Burrows) talks to a psychotherapist,
moaning about her life while her husband Alex (Stellan
Skarsgard), the director of a small movie company, enjoys 
sexual affairs.  His current mistress is an actress, Rose
(Salma Hayek), whose purse has been bugged by her liaison,
Lauren (Jeanne Tripplehorn) as Lauren drops Rose off for an
audition.  Allegedly a satire of Hollywood production, directing
and acting procedures done with darkly comic overtones,
"Time Code" unfolds an unimposing story of auditions,
attractions and conundrums.</P>
<P>   We are invited democratically to look inside any quadrant
that strikes our fancy, but generally action that is at all
dramatic or comic occurs in only one.  The unifying element
is a series of earthquakes that sets all four cameras a-
shaking when Figgis anticipates enough audience ennui.  For
better or worse, he mutes or shuts off the sound in three
quadrants at any given time to allow us to hear the ad-libbed
conversations in the fourth box.</P>
<P>   Mike Figgis's greatest coup also involves a hand held
camera, but there is no way to compare the quality of his
stunning "Leaving Las Vegas" with the useless anarchy he
perpetrates this time around.  "Time Code" helps prove the
theory that to tell effective truths, you must distill everyday
reality.  Given the minimalist camera technique, the lack of
editing, the want of a script, not even the energetic
performance of Salma Hayek can save this probing of novelty
that appears to exist for its own sake.  There might have
been material for a decent tale in "Time Code," but this film
looks as though it were sent to an execution to have it drawn
and quartered.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 93 minutes.  (C) 2000
