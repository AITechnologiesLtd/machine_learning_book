<PRE>                                 THE ROCK
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Long touted as the low-budget (in action movie terms) alternative to
this summer's Hollywood blockbusters, THE ROCK has been something of a
question mark among movie forecasters.  It doesn't have any real special
effects like TWISTER or INDEPENDENCE DAY.  It doesn't build on a 40
year-old history like MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE.  It doesn't even have any big
name action stars.</P>
<P>     What it *does* have is some of the best actors working in film today
(Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, and Ed Harris), seasoned producers Jerry
Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson (TOP GUN, for starters), BAD BOYS
director Michael Bay, and some relatively unknown screenwriters (David
Weisberg, Douglas S. Cook, and Mark Rosner), who all pull together to tell
one hell of a story -- and hands-down the best action flick of the
year-to-date.</P>
<P>     Based on the first 15 minutes of the film, I started off with some
severe doubts.  Poorly photographed and edited, the intro barely managed to
belch out the premise of the movie: that jaded General Francis X. Hummel
(Harris) and his gang of marine mutineers are taking over Alcatraz with 15
rockets full of V.X. nerve gas, holding the city of San Francisco hostage
until his demands are met.  (These demands are pretty stupid, involving
some cash and reparations for injury to the honor of dead marines.)  Well,
actually paying the money is never an option, so the FBI sends in a group
of Navy SEALS, plus biochemist Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) and hardened
criminal/Alcatraz escapee Patrick Mason (Connery).</P>
<P>     But after this 15 minute lull, THE ROCK explodes into an
incredibly-paced actioner that turns in one of the best entries of the
ever-growing DIE HARD genre.  The best part of the film is Cage and
Connery's chemistry -- the fact that they are such unlikely action heroes
makes them so very believable and so fun to watch.  The comedy in the film
also goes a long way -- something Bay is also good at, as he proved in BAD
BOYS.</P>
<P>     THE ROCK has one thing going for it that no other summer actioner
does, and that's believability.  It's just outrageous enough to make a
movie out of -- just real enough to make you wonder why it couldn't happen
tomorrow.  Plus, you get to see a guy's face melt off, which is always a
bonus.  (The production notes say that this V.X. stuff is *real*.)</P>
<P>     Minor quibbles aside (composer Nick Glennie-Smith ripping off his own
CRIMSON TIDE score and a huge 10-minute meaningless car chase), I highly
recommend action fans see THE ROCK when they finally wake up and realize
just how stupid MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE *really* is.</P>
