<PRE>THE RAGE: CARRIE 2
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: 1/2 out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Most horror films are hesitant to trumpet their lack of originality.
That's not the case with The Rage: Carrie 2, which displays its copycat
plot proudly.  It has to...there's not much else which connects this
film with the original Carrie.  It's certainly nowhere near the dubious
quality of Brian DePalma's mid-70s teen horror film. Heck, even Stephen
King's name is no longer associated with this project (which should tell
you quite a lot).</P>
<P>The Rage can call itself a sequel to Carrie by the thinnest thread. Sue
Snell (Amy Irving), one of the tormenting teens of the original, is the
only returning character.  She has grown up into a school guidance
counselor, determined to prevent the type of telekenetic violence she
instigated twenty years earlier.</P>
<P>Emily Bergl stars as Rachel Lang, the teen you don't want to mess with
in this sequel.  Unlike the original Carrie, Rachel isn't a complete
outcast.  She's bonded with another white trash goth girl named Lisa
(Mena Suvari), who also has low self-esteem.  However, both girls are
about to run afoul of the "popular" crowd.</P>
<P>It seems that the local jocks have a game they've been playing: to
deflower and dump as many pathetic girls as possible.  Lisa's reaction
as a victim of this cruel game is predictable, but it really only serves
as a plot device to further isolate Rachel.</P>
<P>When sensitive jock Jesse (Jason London) befriends Rachel, are his
feelings true?  Or is he merely luring her into a cunning trap which
will unleash her psychic fury to kill?!?  (Seeing as this is a "Carrie"
movie, which do you think?)</P>
<P>In a strained attempt to link itself to the earlier film, The Rage
contains several "flashbacks" to the original Carrie (most of which are
quite a stretch).  It even goes so far as to replay the original's
"They're all going to laugh at you" line over and over again on the
soundtrack.  The effect seems more pathetic than frightening.  It's as
if the new film realizes it has failed to create anything even mildly
creepy, and must dredge up the memories of the past in an attempt to
shock.</P>
<P>The film is almost robotic in its mimicry of the original Carrie. At
least the first film had originality on its side.  With The Rage: Carrie
2, every step of the plot is irritatingly obvious, even to those who
never saw the first film.  You would at least think that, with such a
detailed blueprint, the film would move along at a decent pace. Wrong
again.  The film is painfully sluggish in creeping towards its
inevitable conclusion.</P>
<P>But, of course, the characters are completely oblivious of the utter
predictability of their situation.  No one even pays the  slightest heed
when windshields shatter without cause, and the  school lockers have the
darndest habit of exploding open at random times.  These things would
raise flags even in a town which hasn't had an entire senior class
slaughtered by telekinetic  violence.  The filmmakers behind The Rage:
Carrie 2 must be as oblivious as these students!</P>
<P>Certainly as an audience member, you wish you had their amazing powers
of ignorance, both during and after the movie.  As a horror film, The
Rage: Carrie 2 is more likely to elicit groans than shrieks.</P>
