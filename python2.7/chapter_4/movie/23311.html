<P>The man who has brought audiences his very unique directing style with such
daring and bizzaro films as 'Eraserhead' (1977), 'The Elephant Man' (not so
bizzaro) (1980), 'Blue Velvet' (1986), 'Wild at Heart' (1990), 'Twin Peaks:
Fire Walk With Me (1992)', and 'Lost Highway' (1997) has now decided to
embark on a real life subject with docile characters, no insanity contained
in his subject matter, and a dose of what it feels like to take your grand
parents to the movies in this day and age.  A real comfort with safe, tame
and extremely likable aspects.</P>
<P>Director David Lynch is getting almost no recognition (and that's a shame)
for 'The Straight Story', a wonderful and low key film that is the most
fondly remembered of its kind since 1983's 'Tender Mercies' which wasn't so
much a motion picture as it was a series of still photographs brought to
life through the miracle of characterization.  That's what 'The Straight
Story' looks and feels like.  And it shrinks the marvel of the big screen
motion picture into a compact memory of finely wrought images and the story
of a simple man who really did exist.</P>
<P>Based on a true story, in 1994, a 73 year old man named Alvin Straight (who
died in 1996), drove his lawn mower some 300+ miles from Iowa to Wisconsin
to see his brother who has suffered from a stroke and Alvin wants to make
peace with him since the two men last spoke because there has been some bad
blood between the two of them.</P>
<P>The film begins in Alvin's home town in Iowa.  Alvin is poverty stricken.
He lives in a small run down shack with his simple minded daughter Rose
(Sissy Spacek).  One day he falls in the kitchen of his home and needs to
see the doctor.  Alvin suffers a series of physical ailments.  He has bad
vision.  His hips are shot etc., etc.  He can't afford treatment and tells
the doctor that.  Alvin then needs to walk with two canes instead of the
doctor recommended walker (he can't afford that either).  Upon receiving the
news that this brother has had a stroke, Alvin under takes a project that no
one (not even the audience) knows about until it completed.  He fixes up his
John Deere lawn mower and welds a trailer like contraption to the rear that
will carry his supplies and provide his shelter, including a place to sleep.
His first trek is unsuccessful.  He gets a few miles from town but then has
to come back.  He buys a better lawn mower and then takes off for a bumpy
but successful go of it.</P>
<P>Alvin has many encounters on his trip.  One night after parking for the day
and relaxing, Alvin meets a young female runaway and invites her to spend
some time with him by his camp fire.  He is roasting wieners on a stick and
offers the lady one.  She asks him if he's afraid to be an old man at night
by the wayside with no one around.  Alvin tells her that as a war veteran,
if he could survive the trenches, he can't be afraid of anything.  They
strike up a conversation where Alvin does most of the talking and he tells
of how his daughter Rose had a tragedy in her life that saw the removal of
her children from her home because authorities thought she was a danger to
them because of her Forrest Gump/Rain Man personality and acts of the mind.</P>
<P>Alvin meets college kids and a group of ordinary, middle aged folks.  He is
almost killed when he loses control of his lawn mower while rolling down a
steep hill.  The town's folks find out about his trek to see his sibling and
they help Alvin fix his lawn mower, give him lodging and even offer to drive
him the rest of the way.  Alvin accepts their help except for the part about
being driven to his destination.  He wants to do that himself.</P>
<P>The film has little or no music score.  It looks extremely easy to make but
that's the deception.  This is an extremely difficult film to pull off
because the subject matter is so ordinary that unless it is told in a simple
fashion it will look like more than it really is.  There are no fancy camera
tricks, no sharp, quick witted editing flashes, and virtually no technical
marvels at all.  Richard Farnsworth's Oscar worthy performance is the best
thing the film has to offer.  While Alvin is something of an enigma to
behold, Farnsworth portrays him as a wise, level headed man who never gets
angry and while the performance is one track for the most part, it's done
with the quality of making those who see the film, want to adopt Alvin as a
foster grand parent because he hasn't let life get him down.</P>
<P>'The Straight Story' is just the kind of slapping down many of us need in
our homogenized, digitized and computerized worlds of high technology with
cell phones, DVD players, fax, e-mails and other gadgets that make society
seem artificial as we forget where are roots are.  Alvin never lets us
forget who we really should be at certain moments in our lives.
Extraordinary!</P>
