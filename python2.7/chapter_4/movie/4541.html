<PRE>                               ANTONIA'S LINE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Filled with almost a dozen of the most fascinating characters who
comprise the story of this utterly intriguing film, Antonia's Line does
not waste a moment as it moves from its beginning to its conclusion
when Antonia (Willeke Van Ammelrooy) dies.  The story, in parts, is
narrated by Sarah, (Thyrza Ravesteijn ). Antonia's great-granddaughter
who, with family and friends stand around 88-year- old Antonia's bed as
the old woman says that today is her last day of life.  Before she
dies, she reflects in her mind's eye on her long and full life and,
through one long flashback, we see that life and the people whom she
encountered on the way to this fateful final day.</P>
<P>     All of these people have experienced their own lives, most of them
filled with excitement, passion, hard work.  Here we have one
beautiful fairy tale.  There is Antonia's longtime friend known as
"Crooked Finger " (Mil Seghers) . . . and Olga, the Russian (Fran
Waller Zeper) whose three jobs consist of cafe-owner, undertaker and
midwife.  There is Farmer Daan, (Jakob Beks), the chauvinist landowner
who believes women have no other purpose in life than to breed.  He
has a retarded daughter, DeeDee (Marina De Graaf).  The town has other
retarded inhabitants such as Loony Lips (Jan Steen). and poor Mad
Madonna (Catherine Ten Bruggencate) who, because she cannot marry the
love of her life (Paul Kooij) as he is a Protestant, howls at the moon
at night.  The Village Priest (Leo Hogenboom) is fire and brimstone
but has his own fire burning within him  And there is Bas (Jan 
Decleir),
a farmer who despite having lived in the town for 20 years is still
considered a "newcomer."</P>
<P>     Marleen Gorris, who wrote and directed the film, maneuvers the
film's characters like a virtuoso juggler, never for a moment missing a
beat.  Not to be missed.</P>
