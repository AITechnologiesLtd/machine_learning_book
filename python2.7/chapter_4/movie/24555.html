<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Joe DiMaggio, Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron. These players most often get thought of
when people look at prominent baseball figures from the 1930s and 1940s.
However, another great slugger of the time often gets overlooked. Hank
Greenberg, the first Jewish baseball player to not change his name to a
Christian one usually gets forgotten. Those who remember him are most likely
baseball buffs, or former residents of the Detroit area. Director Aviva Kempner
wanted to change that. After Greenberg's death in 1986, Kempner began a 12 year
struggle for funding, filming, and spreading awareness of this film. Her hard
work is evident. The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg is a wonderful
documentary. It's just long enough to keep it from getting boring, it has a
good amount of humor, and the interviews and cross-references are mini-marvels.</P>
<P>Hank Greenberg first stepped to the plate in 1934 when he got signed to the
Detroit Tigers. Throughout the season, especially when the pennant race heated
up, he has the constant target of anti-Semitic remarks from people in the
crowd. Baseball was America's game, and some believed Jews shouldn't be allowed
to play it. Greenberg gained popularity by hitting most often one or two home
runs a game, and leading his team to the pennant. For so many people though, he
was much more than a baseball player. He was a Jewish icon, a sign of hope. A
voice speaking to all Jews in America that said they could be just as
successful as the "true" Americans. In one interview a fan describes his school
days when they used to listen to baseball games on the radio during class.
Whenever Greenberg came up to the plate all the other kids would look at him,
perhaps thinking he knew whether he would hit a home run or not. Indeed he was
a sense of pride for people he hadn't even met. While Hank Greenberg was a very
tall (6'4'') and gawky man, he was not a very religious one. He rarely attended
synagogue, and played on Rosh Hoshanah, but decided not to play on Yom Kippur.
Despite this, he was still considered a religious symbol of hope. The film also
chronicles his experience in the military, as well as his final seasons with
the Tigers, and his one year playing on the Pittsburgh Pirates.</P>
<P>I really enjoyed The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg, mostly because of its
humor and subject matter. I personally have never had a large interest in
baseball, but I found the movie entertaining because I knew very little about
the man before seeing it. It's enjoyable because we are supposed to take the
film in a light sense. All fans (mostly famous Jews including Walter Matthau,
Carl Levin, and Alan M. Dershowitz) celebrate their experience with and
memories of him with zeal. The film opens and closes with another treat, the
Marx Brothers singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" in Yiddish. While we don't
get a heavy focus on racism and anti-Semitism, Kempner expects the audience to
comprehend what this man had to go through without making the racism factor
seem overwrought. In the last minutes of the movie, Hank Greenberg meets Jackie
Robinson who at that time got taunted much more than when Greenberg first
started. The two talked long after their game, and Jackie Robinson later
described Greenberg as, "Nothing but class." Itâ€™s a kind, simple, and
somewhat sweet way to end the film. The movie is about a man and his fans with
an undeniable passion for baseball, but the film paints a larger picture. It
shows us an America on the verge of change. Well done Ms. Kempner, your twelve
years of labor are well worth it.</P>
