<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a man's film, for the kind of a man who is lost in his sense of
being a man and lost in the nostalgia of the '70s drug scene. The women
all have minor parts and are viewed as sex objects or conniving harlots.
It's the 1990s and we're in layed back L.A. and there's a character
called Lebowski (Bridges), who likes to be called "The Dude." His two
other bowling pals, Walter (Goodman) and Donny (Buscemi), like him, are
dysfunctional. The plot unfolds into a series of mistaken identity
scenes and over-the-top comedy, by mistaking "The Dude" for another
Lebowski, a wealthy cripple, the story takes on the weird humor of the
Coen Brothers, as they build a case for this likable California bum to
get satisfaction over his pride being hurt. He plays out a very funny
fantasy role, spoofing the Raymond Chandler private detective type of
stories in the Hollywood of the '40s.</P>
<P>You see, the story is about intruders who piss the Dude off when they
piss on his rug. So he goes to the rich Lebowski (David Huddleston) and
asks payment for his rug's damage, using the logic that it is this guy's
fault why it happened, even if he didn't do it; after all, he does have
the same last name and this mistake wouldn't have happened if that was
not the case. So you see the direction this film is going, it is
cartoonish in characterization, with ridiculous dialogue, plenty of zany
characters, and no discernible plot. Stars make cameo appearances and do
their shticks, even if it adds nothing to the plot. The John Turturro
one, where he plays the flaming Mexican queen, is particularly funny.
The absurd story goes on with the Big Lebowski hiring "The Dude" to be a
private detective for him and get back his kidnapped wife Bunny (Tara).
But since "The Dude" is just being set-up, it really doesn't matter that
he is not qualified for the job, even if he does take this job to be a
serious one, and his dim observations of things are humorously abetted
by his friends even dimmer observation of things, which makes things
really seem absurd.</P>
<P>The comedy here is sometimes so sharp, that you could roll in the aisle
with laughter and not seem any odder than the characters you see
onscreen. The John Goodman character, of the hot-tempered, ex-soldier,
and adage prone advisor to "The Dude," is hysterically funny. In one
bit, he tells one of his bowling opponents, " this is not 'Nam, this is
bowling. There are rules." Everything about John Goodman's character
will apply to his tour of duty there, whether or not it is relevant to
the situation.</P>
<P>It is not as good a film overall as Fargo, but it is funny enough to be
a minor work in the Coen brothers continuing attack on our sitcom
culture. It also added a nice touch by having Sam Eliott, with his rich
melodic voice, garbed as a cowboy, do the voice-over, adding touches of
inane wisdom; such as, his saying in mock seriousness, "sometimes you
get the bear, sometimes the bear gets you." This only adds more
absurdity, to a story that was already bizarre to begin with.</P>
