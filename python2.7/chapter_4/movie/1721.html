                       A film review by Andrew Hall
                        Copyright 1993 Andrew Hall</PRE>
<P>     Whew!  What a weak selection of movies there was this weekend.
After suffering through BODY OF EVIDENCE last week, I decided to take a
break from "erotic" thrillers for a while - maybe forever.  And
LORENZO's OIL seemed like too much of a tear-jerker (plus, I had just
seen Nick Nolte in CAPE FEAR on video).  So I opted instead for what
threatened to be a stupid comedy.</P>
<PRE>     What the heck, I thought, take a little risk.</PRE>
<P>     Nonetheless, since I expected little, I was pleasantly surprised by
Alan Spencer's new film, HEXED.  The film stars Arye Gross, Claudia
Cristian, and Adrienne Shelly.  Norman Fell (Mr. Roper on THREE'S
COMPANY) has a bit role as a hotel manager.  Spencer also wrote the
script.</P>
<P>     The story concerns Matthew (Gross), a career hotel clerk who
escapes his dull life by pretending to be glamorous, successful men.
Instead of dating his cute co-worker Gloria (Shelly), Matthew would
rather dazzle other women with his BS.  Yet his co-workers constantly
remind him of his meager life.</P>
<P>     When they mock him for claiming to know European supermodel Hexina
(Cristian), a guest at the hotel, Matthew is determined to prove he does
by impersonating a man Hexina is supposed to meet.  He succeeds beyond
his wildest dreams, and he takes Hexina back to his place, where she
turns out to be a wildwoman.  Unfortunately, she's perhaps a bit too
wild, and she soon embroils Matthew in a blackmail-murder plot.</P>
<P>     As a whole, the movie doesn't quite jell.  The pieces are better
than the sum of the parts.  But there are lots of great lines, silly
gags, and slapstick falls.  Spencer pokes fun at everything from models
to police to horror films.  I liked the right-wing detective and cop who
gives fashion tips.  Another cute bit was the nod to Hitchcock's
VERTIGO, which also appeared in the trailer.</P>
<P>     A few of the jokes of questionable taste.  For example, there's the
mocking of the Rodney King beating.  I found it darkly funny, but some
people might be offended.  And people *die* in this "comedy," so the
comedy is a little black at times.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the funniest part of the film was the sex scene between
Hexina and Matthew.  This is one of the goofiest love scenes I've ever
seen (right up there with Leslie Nielson and Priscilla Presley in THE
NAKED GUN).  The audience was just dying.</P>
<P>     Cristian does a hilarious send-up of a glamorous model gone mad,
but Gross can't quite carry the film as the comic lead.  Still, Alan
Spencer shows promise as a filmmaker (his first film, I believe).  I
hope he gets the chance to make more films, though, because HEXED
probably won't make any money.  I doubt it will be at the box office
long.</P>
<P>     At least HEXED fulfills the basic rule of a comedy:  it makes you
laugh.  So if you're tired of Madonna and Nick Nolte and you're in the
mood for a little silliness, go for it.  Just don't expect the comic
masterpiece of the decade.</P>
