<PRE>Whipped (1999, R)</PRE>
<P>Written, Produced, and Directed by Peter M. Cohen</P>
<P>Starring Amanda Peet, Brian Van Holt, Judah Domke, Jonathan Abrahams,
and Zorie Barber</P>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>The time is the present, and the setting is New York: where everyone has
game… or at least thinks they do.  Brad (Brian Van Holt) thinks he's got
game but is really an unabashedly sexist pig.  Zeke (Zorie Barber)
thinks he's got game but all he has are physical shortcomings.  Jonathan
(Jonathan Abrahams) knows he doesn't have game, but is forced to ante up
stories as if he did because Zeke and Brad constantly brag over Sunday
breakfasts about how they scammed during the week.  And Eric (Judah
Domke), a man who was designed to `jump on the grenade' at parties and
ended up marrying the grenade, just wants to escape from his utterly
pitiful life.</P>
<P>Enter into the story Mia (Amanda Peet), a girl who appears to be
innocent but who we quickly discover to be playing all sides against the
middle.  Mia meets Brad, Zeke, and Jonathan one week, then schedules
dates for the next week, only to be surprised by all three on the same
night.  Knowing that she is found out, she decides that it will be
impossible to do a relationship with any single one of them because she
likes them all too much and offers them the choice of each one having a
relationship with her or having them all leave.  Because all of them are
too cocky to let Mia go, they all end up dating her… alternating nights,
bumping into each other on the way out, and generally growing to hate
each other rather quickly.</P>
<P>This is about a half hour into the movie, and the remaining hour and
fifteen minutes are spent poking fun at the trio of headstrong men who
are too dumb to realize what we do immediately: that Mia is a player.</P>
<P>Combining great dialogue with toilet humor (and I mean toilet
literally), Whipped is something like watching a hybrid of `Sex and the
City', Swingers, and There's Something About Mary.  And, like all of
them, it is destined for greatness.  In fact, the best way to describe
whipped is as the second coming of Swingers, except this time the girls
come out on top.</P>
<P>Fully aware of its status as a sex comedy, Whipped never takes itself
too seriously.  Instead, Whipped whips up a batch of great laughs
combined with a light touch of satire.  Peet plays the same perky, sexy
girl that we so easily fell in love with in The Whole Nine Yards, and
writer-director-producer Peter M. Cohen handles the film like he had
been directing since birth.</P>
<P>The films flaws come in two aspects.  One is that the movie is done in a
sort of documentary format, showing clips of each man talking to the
camera (and, as is suggested towards the end, talking to Mia behind the
camera).  The other is that the men are overdrawn in their actions.
They overact their parts until they become nothing more than
charicatures, and when that happens, the satire starts to become too
heavy for such a light film.</P>
<P>Yet Whipped is ungodly funny.  How funny?  Let's just say I'm whipping
out my wallet to pay for a ticket when it comes out.</P>
<PRE>4 stars</PRE>
