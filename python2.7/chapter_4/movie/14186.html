<P>Plot: SWAT team commander Jack Lomax is shattered to find the body of 
his younger sister, having been murdered by psychopath Martin Kagan. 
Lomax's testimony is pivotal in putting Kagan away in Westgate 
Penitentiary under the ultra-hardline Warden Munsey. But after ardently 
liberal assistant governor Alice Barnes is appointed to Westgate and 
looks certain to have Kagan sent to a soft psychiatric rehabilitation 
facility, Lomax decides to take the law into his own hands and break 
into Westgate and kill Kagan.</P>
<P>`The Expert' is a direct-to-video action film that suffers from an 
identity crisis. It seems a peculiarly divided film with the script that 
gives evidence of having wanted to go in one direction and a director 
that has insisted on taking it in different directions. It reminds one a 
good deal of William Friedkin's little-seen serial killer courtroom 
drama `Rampage' (1987) - but having been conflated into an action movie. 
On one hand the film gives the impression of wanting to put a serial 
killer into the courtroom and engage in a discussion (for which read 
demolition) of the various psychiatric vs free will arguments over the 
insanity plea, and to elsewhere similarly engage various associated 
issues like the liberal vs the hardline penal system, the liberal parole 
system, the death penalty and whether child abuse can be offered as 
exculpatory of disturbed adult behaviour. The arguments are clearly 
swayed in favour of the right wing libertarian soapbox with Shaner's 
killer painted as a smiling psychopath who gleefully abuses and twists 
the liberal system to his advantage. The only solution for such a 
contemptuous abuser of the system, the film sees, is vigilante justice - 
for hero Speakman to break into the prison and execute killer Shaner 
himself after Shaner manages to fool the system.</P>
<P>On the other hand however the film doesn't entirely make its arguments 
black-and-white. The lines are blurred far more than say they are in the 
similar `Just Cause'. In the prison, for instance, Alex Datcher's 
recklessly liberal reformer and the sadistically hardline warden (James 
Brolin in a rare villainous role and having the time of his life) are 
both seen as being as bad as one another, with the film sitting in the 
middle and taking neither's side. Similarly the scenes surrounding the 
death sentencing of one of the inmates are portrayed in sympathetic 
terms that  suggest that the victim may well have been sentenced 
innocently.</P>
<P>Unfortunately the film gives the impression of starting with a script 
that wanted to at least raise some issues, if not exactly deal with them 
in a profoundly original or even that literate a way, that has been 
taken over and turned into an action movie. It is only really finally in 
the latter quarter that the film breaks away from being a 
courtroom/prison drama to open out into the action film that it has been 
wanting to be all along. Up until that point the insertion of gratuitous 
action scenes badly jars. Particularly obnoxious are a couple of 
sequences - one where hero Speakman slaughters, rather than disarms, 
every single one of a group of armed hillbillies, and another where he 
beats up and smashes the car of a group of drunks who run him down in 
alley. The unquestioning righteousness of these acts, sanctified solely 
by the fact that they are being conducted by the hero, is repellent. And 
in the end whatever argument the script may have offered up to justify 
its case in having the hero, given no redress for his hurt in the face 
of a frustrating liberal justice system, take justice into his own 
hands, is reduced to the most mindless form of brutal vigilantism.</P>
<P>Nor is it ever made clear who the titular expert is meant to be.</P>
