  If you want to know how well a woman will get on with a
man, or whether she will make a suitable wife, try to find out
something about her relationship with her dad.  In
"Repulsion," a look at an old photo of the principal character,
Carol, would be worth a thousand words, but since that photo
figures strongly in the dramatic final seconds of the film, its
contents will not be revealed here.
  "Repulsion," a film which receives revivals several times in
any given year, is now enjoying a run at New York's Film
Forum.  The black-and-white work made in 1965 when
Roman Polanski was 32 years old has not been restored,
revitalized or colored.  Presumably its return 32 years after its
production is motivated by its qualities.  For want of a better
terminology "Repulsion" could be called a work of horror, a
grand guignol, though by today's Craven standards it is too
subtle to hold the interest of the typical targeted audience for
the category, the 16-25-year-old set.  For adults able to
appreciate its caliber, "Repulsion" still packs a wallop.  The
horror emerges not from outside threats but within the mind of
its protagonist, and watching the picture, you can't help
thinking that Polanski himself might have had episodes of
schizophrenia--Mental deterioration has rarely been so
convincingly portrayed and by so lovely a star.
   The story takes place in a seedy London flat where Carol
(Catherine Deneuve), a resident of Brussels, is now living with
her sister Kate (Yvonne Furneaux).  When Kate tells her
sister that she is taking some time off with her boy friend
(John Fraser) to visit Italy, Carol is terrified, and like a lost
puppy begs Kate not to go.  Left alone perhaps for the first
time in her life, her fragile mind slowly unwinds.  She begins
to see the walls crack and, at one point, when she turns on
the light, a huge gap seems immediately to materialize as
though London were hit by an earthquake. In her
hallucinations, men three times succeed in raping her.  When
she touches the walls, her hand leaves a deep imprint. 
These symptoms do not appear from nowhere: Carol is
repelled by men.  When a handsome young guy (Ian Hendry),
obsessed with her beauty, kisses her ever so faintly, she runs
to her room and brushes her teeth frantically.  As you might
guess this repulsion toward the opposite sex will lead to no
good.
   Polanski's violence is rarely prominent.  He exploits brutality
in more subtle ways than Sam Peckinpah and Arthur Penn,
being more concerned with how savagery arises from
solitariness, from people cut off, unsupported by any shared
view of life and society. His direction is slow and deliberate,
exhibiting Carol's change in her London tenement from
marginal functioning to withdrawal to ferocity with English
patience.  And he makes sure to add just the right amount of
humor, coming mostly from his depiction of others who are
also odd but in harmless ways.  There's the old woman with
the dog who is a neighbor, who stands for quite a while
outside Carol's open door to view a conversation between
Carol and her would-be boy friend.  An old man with a cane
enters her apartment, looks around at the overturned couch,
and slowly creeps out.  Still another eccentric, seeing Carol
lying unconscious, asks with his broad Scottish accent, "Can I
get her some brandy?"  And the rich old lady, Mrs. Walsh,
can drive her beauticians up the wall with her banal but quite
comical statements about men: "There's only one thing men
want and I don't know why they make such a fuss about it."
   As for Catherine Deneuve, who appears in virtually every
scene, is it possible for any in the audience not to fall in love
with such beauty?  No matter that she scarcely utters a word,
and that when she does she is anything but encouraging or
warm.  It's simply not possible to be unaffected by her
loveliness.  We need wonder not at all how she could beckon
a cornucopia of male attention simply walking down the street,
eyes down, unsmiling.   She is well supported by her sister
Kate, a thoroughly modern Millie whose man sleeps with her
next door, her moans driving Carol bananas.
   A contemporary audience might find the horror in
"Repulsion" occurring too little, too late, but the fun of the
movie is in the details, the careful etching of the mind of a
woman cracking under the strain of her alienation. Rated R.
