<PRE>                            THAT OLD FEELING
                       A film review by Marty Mapes
                        Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*1/2 (out of 4) NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS ONE OR TWO OF THOSE WORDS
SOME PEOPLE GET UPSET OVER. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.</P>
<P>Except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy, That Old Feeling
is embarrassing to sit through.</P>
<P>Bette Midler and Dennis Farina play Lilly and Dan, Actress and Author,
once married, now violently divorced, and back together one last time
for their daughter Molly's (Paula Marshall) wedding. Lilly and Dan hate
each other passionately -- so passionately that they have sex at the
wedding and fall in love again.</P>
<P>Each ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years and runs off with the
other. Molly, married now only 24 hours, runs off in search of her
irresponsible parents while her husband Keith (Jamie Denton) tries to
console the abandoned spouses.</P>
<P>In Molly's search for her parents, she somehow falls in love with
Lilly's paparazzo Joey (Danny Nucci). Meanwhile, the newlywed Keith ends
up consoling Dan's wife Rowena (Gail O'Grady) in bed.</P>
<P>The audience I saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery
was hilarious. I'm no Dan Quayle, but I thought it was a bit creepy. The
message seemed to be "ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and
have fun fucking who you wish." "Family values" aside, there's something
cruel about all this.</P>
<P>Perhaps this movie would have played well as a black comedy, but the
movie is a romantic comedy. We are supposed to be ROOTING for these
creeps.</P>
<P>Reiner and screenwriter Leslie Dixon tried to make it easier on us by
making the victims unlikeable. Lilly's husband is a new-age flake who
rambles about "emotional valet parking," so we can write him off as
irrelevant. Dan's wife is vain, manipulative, and jealous so we can
write her off as a bitch. Molly's husband is a career-conscious,
self-centered Republican politician who thinks she's too fat (and just
for good measure, he also fucked Dan's wife), so we can write him off as
a prick. Everyone else falls in love.</P>
<P>But still, that somehow doesn't justify the actions of the movie's main
characters. "He's a prick" or "she's a bitch" is no defense.</P>
<P>The movie is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialog -- often during heated
arguments -- and by above-average performances by Midler and Farina
(breaking out of his character-actor mold).</P>
<P>Other than that, it's a standard romantic comedy with a very substandard
gimmick.</P>
