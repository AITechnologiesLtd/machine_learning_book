<P>1999 is already turning into the Year of the Bard.  Shakespeare in Love won
the Oscar, A Midsummer Nights Dream is coming to theaters soon, a Taming of
the Shrew update is already there.  So I suppose it shouldn't come as a
complete surprise to anyone that Jackie Chan has remade The Two Gentlemen
of Verona.</P>
<P>Well, perhaps that's a bit of a stretch, but the story of twins separated
at birth that fuels Twin Dragons is at least as old as Shakespeare's tale.
Jackie Chan steps out of his usual Hong Kong cop screen persona to play
mismatched twins -- one a successful American pianist and orchestra
conductor, the other a Hong Kong mechanic with ambitions to drive race
cars.  They cross paths in Hong Kong and, predictably, are swiftly mistaken
for each other. The mechanic gets crossways with one of the Hong Kong
street gangs, who are generous enough to provide any number of henchmen so
that our heroes can beat the stuffing out ot them.</P>
<P>Up to now, the Jackie Chan movies (that have been released in the US) have
always worked because they've been balanced in two important ways.  First,
there's been a balance between Chan's formidable rock-'em sock-'em skills
and his equally formidable skills as a physical comic.  The fun thing about
Jackie Chan movies is not that he beats up on the bad guys, but how he
beats up the bad guys -- with impeccable comic timing, just as though he
were in a Roadrunner cartoon.  Secondly, there's always been a balance
between the technical deficiencies of Jackie Chan movies -- the poor
dubbing, the silly scripts, the overall averageness of the supporting cast
-- and the excellence of the stuntwork and the imaginativeness of the One
Big Stunt that redeems the movie's flaws.</P>
<P>It's a tough balancing act for Chan, but he's always pulled it off up until
now.  The few movies that have gotten theatrical release in the States have
all been a hoot to watch.  Remember the scene where Jackie uses that
samurai sword to stop that out-of-control hovercraft in Rumble in the
Bronx?  Or the giant Kevlar hamster ball in Operation Condor?  Or the scene
where he wrecks that Pepsi truck in Mr. Nice Guy?  (Probably the greatest
product-placement scene ever, next to the one in Wayne's World.)  But in
Twin Dragons...</P>

<PRE>work.</PRE>
<P>There.  I said it.  I didn't want to say it, believe me.  I love Jackie
Chan movies.  I've been a consistent defender of his work against those who
would dismiss his film career.  Why, I even kept my mouth shut after seeing
Rush Hour because I didn't want to rain on Jackie's parade.  But even in
the most generous light possible, Twin Dragons isn't good.</P>
<P>Shakespeare's work aside, there just isn't a lot that can be done with the
concept of mismatched twins.  The best Twin Dragons can do is use the
wrinkle that one twin is affected by the muscle movements of the other.  We
see the mechanic twin's hand twitching when the pianist twin plays, and we
see the pianist twin thrash around violently while the mechanic twin is
fighting.  I grinned a little at that, I'll admit, but the gag just gets
worked to death.  So is the gag where people faint when one twin, then the
other walks by.  Not to mention that the twins both have girlfriends, and
they keep crossing paths as well.</P>
<P>With all the really lame comedy present in the movie, you would hope that
the fight scenes and the stunt scenes would counterbalance things enough to
make Twin Dragons entertaining.  Unfortunately, it doesn't happen.  The
fight scenes aren't all that bad, really, and the final fight scene in an
auto factory is probably worth a ticket if you have a dollar movie theater
handy.  But the One Big Stunt that characterizes Chan movies is absent.
For whatever reason -- low budget, or that Chan's body isn't quite so
resilient anymore -- there isn't the one grand, gooey, destructive stunt
scene that's the signature of Jackie's work.</P>
<P>Twin Dragons is a disappointment, but it's not a bad movie.  Instead, it's
a reminder of just how good the other Jackie Chan movies are.  They've all
had to keep their balance in an unforgiving critical climate.  Twin Dragons
loses its balance, true, but it's a narrow high wire at best with heavy
winds.</P>
