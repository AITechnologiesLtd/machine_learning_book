FEARLESS (1993)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>One of the things that make psychology so fascinating is the
fact that the same events create different reactions to
different people. This is case even with the worst possible
traumas, when the most experienced psychologists have
difficulties dealing with psychological aftermath. FEARLESS,
1993 drama directed by Peter Weir, represents the study of
one of such characters permanently altered with such
experience.</P>
<P>The movie is based on the novel by Rafael Yglesias, who
wrote the script. Max Klein (played by Jeff Bridges) has
just survived the terrible plane crash, which left many of
his co-passengers dead. Klein helps other survivors to leave
the burning plane and afterwards simply wonders off, not
even bothering to tell his wife Laura (played by Isabella
Rosselini) that he is alive. Afterwards he is found, brought
back to his family, but his wife can't fail to notice that
her husband is a totally changed man. Max escaped certain
death and now he thinks of himself as invulnerable and
godlike. Airline-appointed psychologist Bill Perlman (played
by John Turturro) can't reach him, but Klein, who became
totally alienated from his family, finds spiritual
connection with Carla Rodrigo (played by Rosie Perez),
grief-stricken mother whose child died in the same plane
crash.</P>
<P>FEARLESS, same as many other movies by Peter Weir, is hardly
experience which could leave viewers with smiles on their
faces. It is grim, uncompromising drama that deals with
death and makes the audience think about arbitrary nature of
that unavoidable fact of life. This is achieved through the
sharp contrast between two characters who are differently
affected with the same event, both in their soul and in the
ways they communicate with outside world. Max, who is
excellently played by Jeff Bridges, might see himself as a
person who cheated death, but since he can't connect with
the outside world anymore, his freedom is only superficial -
for all the loved ones he might be dead, nothing more than a
stranger dwelling in his body. Rosie Perez is also very good
as survivor whose guilt and grief make her not only very
alive, but the only person able to bring back emotionally
dead Max to the world of living. Unfortunately, Weir has
some problems in pacing of the film, and the large segments
on the film being wasted on unnecessary subplots or
characters, like John Turturro's therapist or money-grabbing
attorney played by Tom Hulce. The hallucinatory ending
doesn't answer questions about the nature of Max's
experience, and although some films might benefit from
leaving some questions opened, FEARLESS is not one of them.
But it could still be recommended as one of those rare
Hollywood examples of thought-provoking cinema.</P>
