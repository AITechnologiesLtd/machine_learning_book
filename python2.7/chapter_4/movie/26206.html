<P>   Before 1955, American audiences were used to seeing only
the handsomest young stars involved in romantic adventures. 
Delbert Mann's "Marty" changed all that by exploring true
love between two homely, lonely and desperate middle-aged
people played by Ernest Borgnine and Betsy Blair who
discover to their delight that for every lonely guy in the Bronx
who looks even slightly better than Quasimodo there's an
equally lonely gal who'd love to cook for him for the rest of
their lives.  While oodles of comparable films, particularly
indies, have come out of the woodwork since "Marty," all too
many have played up to the most obvious audience pleasers,
a good recent example being Stephen Kinsella's schlocky
"Double Parked," as insipid as it is predictable--a sitcom from
the get-go.</P>
<P>   What a pleasure, then, to take in Raymond De Felitta's
sincere, alternately funny and poignant drama about ordinary
working-class people from the Marty era, the 1950s, except
that in this case most of the folks are married and living
across the water from the Bronx.  This Staten Island saga,
filmed on location in that outer borough and also in Jersey
City and Bayonne, hones in on small but telling incidents in
the lives of the anonymous people living in ramshackle
homes, folks who may perhaps travel to Manhattan once a
year to see a show.  Staten Island in pre-Verrazano Bridge
days could as well be Fiji without the palms--that's how
isolated from the world so many of these people chose to be.</P>
<P>   In "Two Family House" the principal character, Buddy
(Michael Rispoli)--a name as familiar to working-class stiffs
then as Jennifer or Chad might be to today's debutantes--is
in prison.  The jail has no bars but is a brig constructed by
the fellow's milieu, particularly his demanding and critical wife
Estelle (Katherine Narducci).  Buddy was once scouted by
Arthur Godfrey during his military service, invited to audition
as a singer for Godfrey's TV show, but thanks to his
"practical" fiances warning, he passes that up and instead
launches a series of failed businesses.  Buying a two-family
house, part of which he plans to convert to a bar, he fails to
contemplate the presence of drunken tenant Jim O'Neary
(Kevin Conway) who, together with his pregnant wife Mary
(Kelly Macdonald) refuses to vacate the premises.  When
Mary's baby turns out to be black, her Irish husband leaves
her, unwittingly setting the stage for a romance between the
maritally challenged Buddy and the indigent new mom, Mary.</P>
<P>   With the help of an exquisitely restrained performance by
Michael Rispoli, known to viewers of the TV series
"Sopranos," De Felitta spins a trenchant tale of people who
live on the same island but who are worlds apart.  The
paisans from the neighborhood bar together with the woman
friends of Buddy's cantankerous wife Estelle have only
contempt for the hapless Mary--not so much for her strange
marriage to a drunken bum but for giving birth to a black
baby.  In fairness, we must say that in insular communities
like Staten Island at a time that knew little about political
correctness, such prejudice was common, just as people
freely accepted the frequent use of pejoratives to describe
those of other ethnic and racial groups.  </P>
<P>   Buddy's growing affection for Mary is not difficult to
comprehend given the restrictions imposed on him by his wife
and friends and particularly given the beauty of a lass whose
lovely Irish lilt could make you think she'd as well be named
Shannon or Erin rather than Mary.  De Felitta, who wrote the
screenplay as well and who perhaps is influenced by Spike
Lee, evokes humor from Buddy's banal chatter with his pals,
but even more captivating is his portrayal of the growing love
between Buddy and Mary who are, at first, as hostile as
landlord and tenant (which they were) but who find though a
series of spontaneous meetings that they have far more in
common with each other than they have with the spouses of
their own ethnic circles.  </P>
<P>   "Two Family House" is a small film, one which proves that
you can evoke emotions from an audience by showing real
people in critical situations who overcome their initial distrust
to work out gratifying solutions. The story is narrated
throughout by an unseen African-American, purportedly the
now-grown baby who bore witness to the developing bond of
the two people who nurtured him.  To no one's surprise, "Two
Family House" won the audience award at this year's
Sundance Festival.</P>
