<PRE>                               ADDICTED TO LOVE
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Sam and Maggie start off their relationship on an odd note. Hiding out
in a tumbling down building opposite their former lovers' apartment;
they watch visions projected on a whitewashed wall and listen to their
orgasms blasting out of loudspeakers while plotting their demise.</P>
<P>Well, it may not be much more bizarre than the beginning of many
relationships, but this one features Matthew Broderick and Meg Ryan not
your best friend and new paramour.</P>
<P>Astronomer Sam (Broderick) is shocked when he receives a Dear John
letter from long-time love Linda (Kelly Preston) who is far away in New
York for a two-month teaching workshop. Stunned, he hops the first plane
to the Big Apple and tracks her down by going from hotel to hotel.
(Don't try this at home kids, it's a little more difficult in real
life.)</P>
<P>Discovering that she has shacked up with French chef Anton (Tcheky
Karyo), Sam breaks into the abandoned tenement across the street and
sets up his personal observatory. Constructing the world's best camera
obscura, he watches their comings and goings and takes copious notes
hoping to scientifically predict their breakup.</P>
<P>His dedicated study is interrupted by breaking glass and the entry of
leather-clad motorcycle-riding babe Maggie (Ryan). She isn't interested
in waiting around so that he can reclaim her former sweetheart as Sam is
doing. Maggie wants to inflict pain on the man who dumped her. Revenge
is her motive.</P>
<P>Bugging the apartment, she brings sound to Sam's pictures and adds
artistic passion to his scientific rationality. Their spy station
complete, they are content for a while to be voyeurs. Then they slip
into a more active mode; plotting to destroy the relationship, bugging
(in another sense) Anton's restaurant, getting it shut down and
virtually destroying his life.</P>
<P>All along, as is inevitable, Sam and Maggie fall in love despite their
best efforts not to. Bad Girl Maggie The Cat is just the person to wake
Sam up and he brings hope to her life.</P>
<P>The stars are among the most appealing people working in films today.
>From a man's point of view, Meg Ryan is beautiful and overtly sexual
without having the typical Hollywood overly-endowed body by "Playboy"
and Broderick is the guy you'd like to have as a best buddy.
Occasionally there's some very heavy chemistry between them, but
sometimes it is strangely lacking.</P>
<P>Ryan's role is a stretch for her from her usual romantic roles ("When
Harry Met Sally") but she's up to the task. Maggie is out for blood and
although sensuous in a severe way, she's no naive Sally. Broderick is
his usual nice guy, but even he shows a talent for the sadistic.</P>
<P>There are several dazzling visuals, many of which involve the projected
images as Sam and Maggie stand with moving pictures of their past
significant others covering their bodies. In one particularly striking
moment, the astronomer is painting the wall white as parts of Linda's
likeness begin to sparkle with vitality.</P>
<P>Preston's character is nothing more than a place-holder for the plot,
but Karyo's is a different matter. For the first half of the film, he is
not much more, but when the movie shifts into the farce mode, he becomes
the center of attention.</P>
<P>It is this French farce component that is the weak point of the film. If
it is true that the French worship Jerry Lewis, then this section is for
them. Not being a huge Lewis-imitator fan, the bumblings around in a
body cast scenes fall flat for me.</P>
<P>It's damning with faint praise to say that, for all of its darkness,
this is one of the best romantic comedies recently. It's worth a watch,
but not as memorable a one as it could have been.</P>
