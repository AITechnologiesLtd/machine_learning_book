<P>As Reviewed by James Brundage (MovieKritic2000)</P>
<P> Yesterday I was in a chatroom.  This is the 90s, the information age, and
not at all an abnormal experience.  When inside chatrooms, as we all well
know, everyone talks past each other.  One could say that the chatroom is
the ultimate proof of Mark Twain's thesis "there are no conversations, only
intersecting monologues."</P>
<P> My personal monologue concerned the nature of movies.  The people around me
persisted at chatting away on which movie was good or bad, as they normally
do, with no progress being made towards agreement.</P>
<P> At about 7:40 EST, something inside me cracked.</P>
<P> LOOK, I said, THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT MOVIES SUCK.  THEY HAVE
ALWAYS SUCKED, THEY WILL ALWAYS SUCK, BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE ALONG COMES
A GREAT MOVIE THAT GIVES US HOPE TO CONTINUE.</P>
<P> I am not going to say that Clue is that movie.  No.  What I am going to say
is that this is an example of that fact that, no matter how predictable each
individual movie may be, movies as a whole are a completely wild and
unpredictable animal.</P>
<P> A proof of this thesis is the movie Clue.  A studio movie by the two
producers that inspired the book "Hit & Run", Peter Guber and Jon Peters
(the ones so annoying that Barry Levinson's contract with Rain Man
explicitly said that they be barred from the set), Clue is something quite
different from what we associate with studios.  For one, it is a dark
comedy.  For two, it has a script with dialogue that jumps off the page.
For three, it's postmodern and satiric.</P>
<P> Clue takes place during the McCarthy era of the 50s where the red scare was
in full effect and the Cold War was heating up in Korea.  Six people, all
under an alias, come to the house of Mr. Body (Lee Ving) at the behest of
the butler Wadsworth (Tim Curry).  In the bunch are a Senator's wife, Mrs.
Peacock (Eileen Brennan), a black widow killer, Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn),
a World Health Organization ex-psychiatrist who got friendly with his lady
patients, Professor Plum (Christopher Llyod), a homosexual, Mr. Green
(Michael McKean), a war profiteer, Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull), and a lady
pimp, Ms. Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren).  All of them are locked in a mansion
and given the opportunity to stop the blackmailing or kill the blackmailer.
Thus because a series of murders and perhaps the funniest spoof of
parlor-mysteries ever done.</P>
<P> As each of a bunch of supporting cast and visitors die (the maid, the cop,
the singing telegram girl, the cook, and the motorist), the seven become
increasingly paranoid and increasingly funny.  Sure, sometimes it resorts to
completely childish humor (i.e. the sexy woman says "search me", the man
proceeds to feel her up), but the film works incredibly well.  As repressed
as the McCarthy era was, several jokes are made at its expense as well as
using several plays on words and a heavy use of dramatic irony.  An example
is when a beatnik comes to the door and has a quick snippet of conversation
with the entire terrified bunch.</P>
<P> "The time of Armageddon is near." he says.</P>
<P> "You ain't just Whistilin' Dixie."  retorts the tart Miss Scarlet.</P>
<PRE> "Your souls are in danger."</PRE>
<P> "Our lives are in danger, ya beatnik!" yells Mrs. Peacock as she slams the
door on his face.</P>
<P> Admittedly not the most intelligent movie of all time, Clue remains a bit
of childish fun.  A low-grade dark comedy and a high-grade spoof, it is
worthy spending a couple of hours with.<HR>MovieKritic2000: Reviews for the Generation of a New Millenium
