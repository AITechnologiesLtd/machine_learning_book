<P>There are some simple rules to making a feature film. They include: 1)
Try to avoid venturing over the two-hour mark. 2) Don't rip the plot
out of a history textbook. 3) Use a lead actor.</P>
<PRE>Duh!</PRE>
<P>Cradle Will Rock violates all three of those rules. The work is over
two hours long, rips its plot out of the Great Depression chapter in
textbooks and uses nearly 15 supporting actors in lieu of a lead role.</P>
<P>The odds of a movie with the aforementioned infractions of common
practice being decent are about the same as a little Italian man who
speaks fractured English beating out Tom Hanks for Best Actor. Well,
Benigni not only won the honor but literally walked on Steven
Spielberg in doing so. Cradle Will Rock not only gets away with the
no-nos, but achieves absolute brilliance in the process.</P>
<P>It is the 1930's and the Great Depression has divided American into
the minority wealthy and the majority poor. In an attempt to provide
cheap entertainment for the masses and save an institution known as
Broadway, the Federal Theatre Project (FTP) is born. The mission is to
provide talented, trained and experienced actors and crew members with
jobs.</P>
<P>Marc Blizenstein (Hank Azaria), with the aid of sleepless
hallucinations, pens a show titled Cradle Will Rock. Orson Welles
(Angus Macfadyen) directs the piece after Hallie Flanagan (Cherry
Jones), the director of FTP, decides to produce it. Cast members
include a poor but pride-filled actor (John Torturro) and a homeless
street singer who catches a break (Emily Watson).</P>
<P>There is a problem with Cradle Will Rock, however. It is
pro-union. Lest we forget that Martin Dies is leading a pre-McCarthy
committee investigating possible incidents of communism and FTP is
already under examination in the most notorious witch-hunt in American
history.</P>
<P>The film's suporting character overdose is actually countered by the
history book issue; since the actors are wonderful playing people we
are familiar with, much of the movie works itself out. Azaria's grasp
on Blitzstein is marvelous, John Cusack's take of Nelson Rockefeller
is extremely noteworthy, Ruben Blades' Diego Rivera is fabulous and,
most impressively, Bill Murray plays Tommy Crickshaw in a convincing
and oftentimes chilling manner.</P>
<P>Another interesting actor in the cast is Philip Baker Hall. The
veteran actor seems to have struck gold this year, appearing not only
in this fine film but The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Insider and
Magnolia as well. It is conceivable that he could appear in three, if
not four, of the 1999 Best Picture nominates films.</P>
<P>If all this sounds semi-chaotic, that's probably because it
is. Keeping track of all the film's characters, their issues and the
politics is indeed challenging. However, what is being shown in the
movie is a time of equally dense chaos and uncertainty. Director Tim
Robbins should be credited, not blamed, for properly portraying the
realistic setting of his subject matter.</P>
