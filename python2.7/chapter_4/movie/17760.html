<PRE>20 Dates</PRE>
<PRE>[2.5/4.0]</PRE>
<P>Myles Berkowitz thought it would be interesting to combine his two biggest
failures--his professional life and his personal life. Being a recently
divorced, failed filmmaker, his idea is to make a documentary about finding
love by filming himself going on dates with women. Just meeting women is
difficult for Berkowitz, but he must also persuade them to allow him to put
the date under the microscope of the camera. It is hard to kindle romance
when followed by a film crew. He must wrestle with his financier who
believes that Berkowitz' approach is too boring and that there must be more
prurient and marketable items in the final product. Another big obstacle is
that he is taking both the dates and his film very seriously. He must deal
with the issue that if he is successful at finding love along the way, would
it be possible to attend the remaining dates with other women?</P>
<P>The concept of portraying real romance in a documentary is a very compelling
one because of the way it would compare with the view of romance that is
usually depicted in film. It is Berkowitz' intention that the film takes
both a serious and comic look at this concept. He mostly fails at the
former, but succeeds at the latter. It is hard to imagine that anyone who is
taking a date seriously would consent to allowing two extra people along to
handle the camera and sound recording. This makes any serious exploration
doomed to failure, and it usually also gives the women an unflattering
opinion of Berkowitz.</P>
<P>It seems that Berkowitz has kept the film from becoming a muddled mess by
staging much of what is portrayed. The surreptitiously recorded discussions
with Elie, the film's funder, are quite funny, but not believable. Among
many other questions, if Elie is opposed to the concept of the film to begin
with, why is he so insistent that Berkowitz attend exactly 20 dates? The
interaction between Berkowitz and strangers on the street all seem real and
are often entertaining. The interaction with some of the women he actually
dates sometimes seem scripted. How is it that some of the women can react
negatively to Berkowitz, even threaten to sue him for taping them, yet
apparently allow him to use the footage in the final film? If Berkowitz had
been up front and admitted that some of the film was dramatized for the sake
of comedy, it would have been easy to forgive, because much of the film was
entertaining. Instead, there are too many inconsistencies to ignore, and the
viewer might feel cheated for taking it seriously. However, the film can be
rather entertaining if not taken seriously and viewed for its comedy.</P>
<P>Recommended. The most annoying aspect of the film is the implication that
all the events were real, when there are too many parts that appear staged.
Berkowitz himself is a rather uninteresting person, but his interaction with
seemingly random people is entertaining and sometimes hilarious.</P>
