<P>     At one pivotal point in MAGNOLIA -- one of several pivotal points in
Paul Thomas Anderson's epic of human connection and disconnection -- a
woman sits alone in her apartment, singing along to a song. At first it
seems she's singing along to her stereo, until Anderson cuts to another 
character singing the same song. He does this half a dozen more times,
capturing every one of his principal characters accompanying the haunting
original Aimee Mann composition "Wise Up." As the characters struggle
with moments of painful realization, they become individual voices in a
mournful chorus looking for forgiveness, reconciliation and redemption.</P>
<P>     That sequence in MAGNOLIA is one of the year's best pieces of
film-making, and I could name a dozen more moments from the film that will
be sticking in my memory. If Anderson had pulled all those pieces of
film-making together into a stronger whole, MAGNOLIA might have been the
year's best film, instead of just a very good one. It's certainly an
ambitious work, following many characters through one rainy day in the San
Fernando Valley. Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) is dying of cancer,
inspiring his young wife Linda (Julianne Moore) to guilt-ridden thoughts
and inspiring Earl's caretaker Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to seek out
Earl's estranged son, self-help guru Frank T. J. Mackey (Tom Cruise). Game
show host Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) is also dying of cancer and also
has an estranged child, a coke-addicted daughter named Claudia (Melora
Walters) who becomes the object of affection for good-natured cop Jim
Kurring (John C. Reilly). Meanwhile, quiz show whiz kid Stanley (Jeremy
Blackman) tries to get through another show, while has-been whiz kid
Donnie Smith (William H. Macy) tries to get through another day.</P>
<P>     Anderson sets out to connect his stories thematically with a wild
prologue involving three unrelated tales of coincidence and chance. In a
way, the whole thing is little more than an extended attempt to justify
the film's most surreal device (more on which later). It's also undeniably
compelling, charged by Anderson's kitchen sink visual style. And for three
hours, that's what MAGNOLIA does: It delivers thrilling scene after
thrilling scene which, by all rights, should simply feel self-indulgent. 
Tom Cruise is positively electrifying as the motivational speaker who
teaches a course in male sexual conquest called "Search and Destroy" (it's
the best performance of his career until he once again makes the mistake
of crying on screen). Reilly is wonderful, both in his awkward
flirtations with the hopped-up Claudia and in his trite straight-arrow
response to a young would-be rapper. And Macy once again finds the wounded
humanity in a pathetic figure.</P>
<P>     When Anderson nails these characters at their most vulnerable and
conflicted, he creates sensational scenes for actors. MAGNOLIA plays like
a cross between a symphony and a jazz jam, with solo showcases building
toward splendidly edited crescendos. The only thing missing is an anchor,
something that ties Anderson's multiple story lines together in a way that
makes them greater than the sum of their parts. It shouldn't have been
that difficult considering the parallels Anderson sets up (present day
whiz kid and past whiz kid, the two cancer patients and their angry
progeny). And yes, sins of the fathers play a role in most of the
characters' lives. It's obvious Anderson wants us to feel a connection. I
just don't think he pulls it off, giving more attention to the individual
trespasses and recriminations than to the links between them.</P>
<P>     There's sure to be much talk about Anderson's most audacious attempt
to pull his story together, a cloudburst in which something besides rain
falls from the sky in a torrent. I'm not about to guess what Anderson was
thinking by loosing a Biblical plague upon the San Fernando Valley, nor
will I pretend the credulity-stretching trick doesn't feel more like a
grand gag than a dramatic fulcrum. There's also something about it that
just plain works -- maybe just as damn-the-torpedoes film-making, maybe as
acknowledgement of how primal forces can throttle you into re-evaluating
your life. That, in a nutshell, is the wonderful frustration of MAGNOLIA.
Part of you wants to expose Anderson as a philosophical poseur, and the
other half can't stop watching everything he throws at the screen.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 surreal magnolias:  8. </PRE>
