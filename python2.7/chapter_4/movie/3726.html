<PRE>                               TWENTY BUCKS
                       A film review by Mike Church
                        Copyright 1995 Mike Church</PRE>
<P>     TWENTY BUCKS follows a twenty-dollar bill in its passage from a
cash machine, through the hands of a startlingly variety of people, to
its penultimate fate of being torn into tiny pieces.  Along the way it
gets stolen about four times, lost a couple, pushed into a stripper's G
string, inherited, swallowed by a fish, mailed, driven over, and so
on.</P>
<P>     There's lots of good acting, notably by Linda Hunt who plays a bag
lady.  Like many of the characters, she keeps popping up in one
scene after another.  The result is a series of sub-plots that are
woven together by their shared characters and by the double sawbuck.</P>
<P>     An interesting side note: the script was written decades ago, and
has been rejected by various studios many times over the years.  As it
appears here, the script has been re-written by the original author's
daughter -- there's a scene in the movie which will probably remind you
of this fact.</P>
<P>     The acting, directing and so on all seemed great to my novice
eye.  It has a great sense of humour, and of the cruelty of fate.  I'd
recommend this movie to any of you who find yourself in a video store
with intent to kill an evening.</P>
