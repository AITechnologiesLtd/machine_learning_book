<P>Whatever you do, do not bother with the R-rated version of `Dead Alive'.
Stripped of twelve entire minutes of slimy gore, this version is not
worth your hard-earned cash. I mean, who would possibly rent a movie
like `Dead Alive' for anything but the gratuitous blood and extraneous
death scenes? First, ensure that the copy you picked up does not have an
MPAA rating of Restricted on the back cover. Then, with access to a
plastic barf bag, sit back and enjoy the uproarious Unrated version of
this pinnacle in horror movie-making.</P>
<P>Lionel (Timothy Balme) is a cowardly New Zealand man controlled by his
oppressive, domineering mother (Elizabeth Moody). One day, Lionel is
delivering a shipment of goods to a local convenience store and he meets
a beautiful clerk named Pequita (Diana Penalver). Harnessing all of his
courage and strength, Lionel asks Pequita out on a date to the zoo
(wonderful choice). Of course, in typical overbearing mother fashion,
Lionel's mum comes along for the trip to spy on the happy couple.
Unfortunately for the old hag, she stumbles too close to an adjacent
cage and is bitten by a Sumarian Rat Monkey, which has just been flown
in from overseas.</P>
<P>The Rat Monkey (presented in hilariously cheesy clay-mation) carries
with it a terrible plague: whoever gets bitten transforms into a
flesh-craving zombie. Lionel's mum begins experiencing certain changes -
namely, the loss of certain body parts - and nauseates baffled dinner
guests. When she eats Pequita's dog, it becomes clear that Lionel's dear
mum is not who she used to be. Soon, the entire town is infested with
zombies, even while Lionel attempts to control the plague by locking up
the undead in his fruit cellar.</P>
<P>`Dead Alive' (which was originally released as `Brain Dead') is perhaps
the goriest movie ever made. Director (and fellow New Zealander) Peter
Jackson has gone overboard in the field of splattered blood and
stomach-churning gore to such an extreme level that, after the final
showdown, the remaining characters are nearly knee-deep in a lagoon of
dismembered bodies. Those who carry with them a strong stomach and
appreciate the audacity of the horror genre may laugh until it hurts.
Balme is perfect in his naive, innocent role as an everyday shmoe caught
in an unlikely gorefest.</P>
<P>During the film's final thirty minutes, things get a little out of hand.
Lionel is forced to give up the family estate to his greedy uncle (Ian
Watkin), who invites dozens of people over for a party. Can you guess
what happens next? Here are a few helpful hints: rib cages are torn out,
people are disemboweled, legs are eaten off, and decapitated heads slide
around on the floor trying to chew on people's ankles. If that doesn't
sound like your cup of tea, then I suggest you rent `The Sound of Music'
again. This half-hour in frenetic film is sometimes so funny it causes
your sides to ache. Alas, when Balme begins using the underside of his
lawnmower to thwart the zombie intruders, Jackson gets almost too
content with himself. It gets to be a trifle too much, even for a
carnage-craving adolescent such as myself.</P>
<P>But, for the most part, `Dead Alive' is deviously inventive and darkly
hilarious, featuring astonishing gore effects that are often downright
sickening. The goal Jackson has in mind from the jump-start is obviously
this: to create a fun homage to classic zombie movies (such as George A.
Romero's `Night of the Living Dead'), and add buckets of blood to amuse
modern horror fans. Any individual who has followed the genre closely
and is disgusted with it's repetitive mediocrity is sure to have a
blast.</P>
<P>Along with the violence quota, the humor in `Dead Alive' is surely it's
most vital asset. In the single-funniest scene, a courageous priest
(Stuart Devenie) dismembers a group of zombie punks using nothing but
his hands and feet (as he puts it: `I kick ass for the Lord'). There is
also the presence of a zombie baby, which provides several fall-down
funny moments. Sure, Jackson also relies on this flesh-eating toddler so
much it gets annoying, but that's a minor problem. How in the world do
you draw a line in a film like this? If limits were set, then it could
have ruined a large portion of the fun.</P>
<P>I'm sure you've now realized `Dead Alive' is not for everyone, but for
all those who dare get involved, the experience will be a side-splitting
one. Just don't watch it with a full stomach. For that matter - don't
watch the R-rated version either.</P>
