<P>   "I am the master of my fate/ I am the captain of my soul,"
said the poet William Ernest Henley back in 1888, to which
some of us, having witnessed some mighty irrational
occurrences during this century, would cynically reply, "Ha!"  
Are we indeed creatures whose use of free will can make or
break us? Of are we mere bondsmen to our real overlords
and rulers, the vagaries of life--namely chance, accidents,
coincidences, and our own past?</P>
<P>  In Paul Thomas Anderson's vision, we are like puppets on
strings, manipulated by Divine Will, flukes, happenstance,
societal norms, and driven at times to near-insanity by the
afflictions of our own past.  Anderson's previous film, "Boogie
Nights," re-created an extended family of pornographers in
California's San Fernando Valley from the late seventies to
the early eighties, centering on an alienated teen (Mark
Wahlberg) who is made into a porn star.  Like "Magnolia,"
that creation of the twenty-eight-year-old director features
flamboyant cinematography, a garish production design, and
some gritty shots of the California landscape that could give a
foreigner watching the film the impression that with few
exceptions, the whole state houses no less than an
anguished collection of guilt-ridden, media-obsessed,
coke-snorting, manipulating, erratic, unloved and
unloving freaks.  What a panorama of personalities to exploit
for the making of a bold, imaginative, envelope-pushing
movie!  Fellini would shape his material to suit his neeeds:
Anderson does so his way.</P>
<P>   Anderson deliberately and happily does not try to shape his
epic-length story into a timeless classic that could be suitably
viewed and enjoyed by people a century from now. Though
we do see the family dysfunction that had fired the fancy of
the Greeks and Elizabethans, "Magnolia" spotlights a
particular place with a unique lifestyle--California's San
Fernando Valley--just as Anderson had centered on the
characteristic environment of L.A. in "Boogie Nights" and on
Nevada in "Hard Eight."  While the pornographers of "Boogie
Nights" plied their trade with little embarrassment, however,
many of the folks in "Magnolia" are overwhelmed with
feelings of guilt for their transgressions, spiritually dried up
and dying for their inability to give or receive love.  But
like Dirk, the stud at the core of the 1997 film, the
characters in the current work try to compensate for the put-
downs and abuse suffered at the hands of their parents in
odd, but often futile, ways.</P>
<P>   If the porno scene of "Boogie Nights" was a reflection of
the greedy 1980s, the rootless nineties forms the backdrop of
"Magnolia."  More people in America are living alone than
ever before, many subsisting on the meager rewards of
watching TV, attending support groups (like the guys in David
Fincher's "Fight Club"), engaging in meaningless, recreational
sex, and filling their bodies with harmful substances--the
drugs which, we are told, are being consumed in place of the
hugs we should be receiving.  Anderson frames the story with
some faux-historical clips to demonstrate the workings of
chance and coincidence on our lives, the first frames actually
taken with a century-old Pathe camera to evoke a feeling of
authenticity.  From there, cinematographer Robert Elswit joins
with editor Dylan Tichenor to create Altmanesque short cuts
which capture the goings-on of a small group of Californians,
occurrences which at first seem absolutely unrelated but
which, in fact, are interwoven.  All events in the movie take
place during a single, striking 24-hour period, all bolstering
the cogent expression, "What a difference a day makes."</P>
<P>   Each of the principals in this character-driven tale
possesses a solid, distinct personality.  The most flamboyant
is Frank Mackey, who is played by Tom Cruise in a role
unlike any other he has rendered.  On the surface, Mackey is
an arrogant, successful leader of a male support group who
prances confidently before expensive seminars teaching his
devotees how to seduce women--how to be the in-charge guy
who is irresistible to the opposite sex.  One of the chapters in
his study manuals is: "How to fake that you are a caring
person."  He is estranged from his 65-year-old dad, Earl
Partridge (Jason Robards), the producer of a quiz show who
is quickly and painfully dying of cancer and wants only to see
his son before he goes. Partridge's much younger wife, Linda
(Julianne Moore), has been driven into a frenzy by guilt over
her relationship with her husband, while most of the principals
are either similarly awash with overwhelming regrets for their
past deeds or unhappy products of ill treatment they received
from people they had trusted.</P>
<P>   "Magnolia," which gets its title from Mark Bridges and
Williams Arnold's production design--the greens, browns and
off-whites of the flower, the colors deepening as the
characters grow to understand their motivations--will probably
not enjoy the popular appeal of the more vigorous "Boogie
Nights."  Anderson's loosely constructed script requires more
patience from the audience, which may be too eager to
discover the connections among these diverse personalities
and are left hanging for quite a while before locating the
director's aims and understanding his vision.  Nor does
"Magnolia" enjoy the level of humor that Anderson rouses in
his previous script.  While Alfred Molina is his usual
exuberant self this time around, we miss the side-splitting
shtick of two years ago when he portrayed an easy-going
fellow who just wants to party throughout the day.  </P>
<P>   Rarely before has a film utilized its soundtrack in the
pulsating style of "Magnolia."  Aimee Mann's songs are every
bit a character, their palpitating tones punctuating all aspects
of the story--particularly the final strain in which everyone
joins, dead and living alike.  Mark Bridges's costumes
symbolize the camouflage behind which we all hide our truer,
darker personalities, most pointedly the expensive
outfits worn by Linda Partridge to hide her inner
impoverishment.  Some particularly arresting roles are played
by young Jeremy Blackman as Stanley, the love-starved boy
genius who sings part of a "Carmen" aria to win points on a
quiz show m.c.'d by first-class phony Jimmy Gator (Philip
Baker Hall), and by William H. Macy as a former boy
genius so messed up by his parents that he winds up a near
basket case thinking that orthodontia could bring him love.</P>
<P>   Though there is cause for optimism as "Magnolia"'s
personalities come to grips with their psyches, making
amends sometimes successfully, sometimes fruitlessly, and in
one case disastrously, Anderson's concept is a bleak one.  If
his country continues on its current, rootless path, ignoring
the obligations and joys of family connection and healthy
relationships with friends and associates, California and the
other alienated centers of America are in for a cataclysmic
disaster.  We could perhaps suffer even the Divine
punishment which Anderson so boldly and surrealistically
splashes across the screen toward the movie's conclusion, a
punishment that recalls God's harsh treatment of the
Egyptian pharaoh who would not let his enslaved people go.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 195 minutes.  (C) 1999
