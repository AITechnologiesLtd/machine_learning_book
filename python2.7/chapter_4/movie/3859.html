<PRE>                                  NINE MONTHS
                       A film review by Melissa Martin
                        Copyright 1995 Melissa Martin</PRE>
<P>     I will truly expect every professional critic to absolutely hate
this movie.  It makes no pretenses for being anything but a stupid,
childish, predictable, cliche comedy.  The film is awful on that
level.</P>
<PRE>     But if the public loves the film as much as I did, it'll be a
hit.</PRE>
<P>     This is a great comedy, more in the tradition of DUMB & DUMBER
than something oh, say, cleverer, like CLUELESS.  I laughed like a
fool from some stupid physical comedy, cartoon-style gags and some
really corny jokes.  The script is unquestionably cheesy and cheap, but
it's hilarious ... which is all that really counts.</P>
<P>     Hugh Grant, who I thought was horrible in FOUR WEDDINGS AND A
FUNERAL (actually, a friend and I didn't even finish the film, we
thought it was pretty awful) and I never liked previously anyway, turns
on the English boy charm like a firehose.  I walked into the theatre
with a slight loathing for him, and by the middle of the movie I wanted
to have his child.  :-)  He is absolutely hilarious and has an obvious
knack for corny comedy.  He even managed to switch gears and carry
something more emotional ... during the middle of the film, at one of
the fleeting moments of seriousness, I almost cried (seriously) because
of the look in his eyes.</P>
<P>     Julianne Moore is a goddess given actress form.  With her
strangely stunning, delicate average-girl appearance and high-quality
acting, we get a character to put our heart into, unlike the childish
Samuel (Grant).  She carries her performance through well and is a
pleasure just to look at.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, Moore and Grant do *not* make a cute couple.  There
are no sparks nor chemistry between the two characters, which is
unfortunate considering the appeal of the two.</P>
<P>     I never liked Tom Arnold either, and so was surprised that I didn't
sit back and wish he was not in the entire movie.  In fact, he was
rather enjoyable.</P>
<P>     Joan Cusack is lovely as Arnold's also-pregnant wife (which was a
sad plot attempt, a little too much like a coincidence).</P>
<P>     Robin Williams, as is natural for the man, is side-splitting funny
and a darned fun ride.  It is unfortunate that he got so little time :
I would have preferred him to take the place of both Cusack's and
Arnold's characters.</P>
<P>     The most unfortunate thing about this film is somewhat in the vein
of ACE VENTURA : PET DETECTIVE, it has been billed as a kind of
semi-family movie.  I saw a huge number of obviously under-13 kids (I'm
thirteen, I should know) get tickets and go in, when it was very
clearly stated 'PG-13.'  What particularly saddened me was that one
sweet ol' grandma had taken two children, about seven and ten, to the
film.  There is a *lot* of sexually explicit and lewd writing here.  It
is very funny at times, but completely inappropriate for anyone under
my age (especially with parents, which is what we tend to call
"unbelievably embarrassing").  There is also one prelude-to-a-sex-scene,
where Julianne Moore gets to participate in a rather demeaning
strip-tease.</P>
<P>     I can't really write much about this film, because there isn't
much to write about.  To sum it up, NINE MONTHS is a very funny but
purposely stupid film.  Not exactly the kind of
"don't-miss-comedy-of-the-year," but easily merits a few good laughs if
you have nothing else better to see.</P>
<P>     Of course, the best films of the year remain POCAHONTAS and APOLLO
13.  If you haven't seen those yet, you've missed a hell of a show.</P>
<P>     WATERWORLD comes out this week.  Can't wait to review it for the
reading public.  :-)</P>
<PRE>Cheers!
