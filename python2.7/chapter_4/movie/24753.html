<P>Easily one of the most highly anticipated movies of the summer (for
audiences and yours truly alike), MI2 was filmed in Australia, features the
great-looking Tom Cruise with long hair, Thandie Newton looking extremely
sweet in her biggest role to date, and ex-Wolverine candidate Dougray Scott
as the official "bad guy". Mix all that in with a healthy dose of Mr. John
Woo at the helm, and God knows the trailer makes it look like the
action-adventure kickass movie of the summer. So is it really that good?
Well...</P>
<P>PLOT:
Super-spy Ethan Hunt is once again asked to take part in a virtually
impossible mission featuring the recovery of a deadly new virus and antidote
from a madman bent on unleashing it upon the world.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This movie starts off with a bang, downshifts into some pretty long and
surprisingly tedious exposition, but ultimately regroups and punches you in
the face during its last 30 bone-crunching minutes. Having said that, I was
slightly disappointed in the film, only because the trailer made it seem
like it was going to kick so much ass all over the place. My hopes might've
been set too high in the anticipation of full-blown action, and even more so
because of the superior talents of director Woo in that regard. Overall, the
film was good, but parts leading up to the halfway point just seemed to
uneventfully drag along for some strange reason, with talk of viruses, the
pharmaceutical angle, and ultimately, one too many rubber mask deceptions
(didn't we get enough of these in the first MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, as well as
FACE/OFF?). And being one of the few people to have actually really liked
the first movie, this one lacked a lot of that cool "spy feel" which I liked
so much in the first. Granted, this film also takes some of its time to
marinate the new "romance" vibe tossed into its cinematic recipe, but I
personally don't go to see John Woo movies in the hopes of finding out more
about the birds and the bees. I want to see action, cool stunts, slo-mo
shots of guns rattling off and an obscene amount of style.</P>
<P>This film definitely delivers on most of those counts, especially the
slo-mos and the proverbial Woo "pigeon scene", but not all in a
well-proportioned manner, in my opinion. The last third of the movie finally
picks up the pace, presenting us with an awesome motorcycle chase scene
which simply has to be seen to be believed, but overall, the pace of the
first half actually had me starting to twitch a little (in a "can we get on
with it already" kinda way). Of course, most of this review sounds negative
only because of my extremely high expectations, so maybe if you go in with
lesser anticipation than I did, you might just really love it. I very much
enjoyed the film's first twenty minutes or so, which included a great
sequence of Tom hanging off the side of a mountain with his little-bittie
fingers, and a pretty darn cool car chase. But the film ultimately crushed
some of my hyperactivity, with a slower, less in-your-face approach during
its next forty-five minutes of set-up. In the end, this film still spends
too much time discussing the plot, which could easily be described in a few
simple words (bad guy has deadly virus, get bad guy before he sets it free
on the world), and not enough time properly dividing up all the action.</P>
<P>I loved both MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and FACE/OFF, both of which I gave 8/10, and
despite this film's few great action scenes, decent acting by most, so-so
story, and captivating soundtrack, I can't help but feel a little
disappointed with thoughts of what-could-have-been. But comparing it to
other films and judging it according to my expectations isn't really fair,
so I will try and get past that and still recommend this film pretty
solidly, despite its leisurely paced build-up and stronger focus on romance.
Whatever you do, don't go into it as I did, expecting one of the most
action-packed movies of the last few years. Enjoy it as a good film
featuring Tommy Cruise, a babe, Ving Rhames sitting in front of a monitor
for two hours, an okay premise and a few over-the-top action sequences. All
in all, I liked it and look forward to a part trois.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:

entire movie.

name, and was previously featured in another Tom Cruise film, INTERVIEW WITH
