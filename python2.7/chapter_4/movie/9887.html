<P>
Alien: Resurrection won't revive creatively bankrupt Alien franchise</P>
<PRE>by Michael R. Smith</PRE>
<P>        It began as a chilling idea, stylishly realized on screen (Ridley
Scott's original "Alien") and was then transformed into a rollicking good
action premise with loads of potential energy for sequels (James Cameron's
epic and as yet unsurpassed "Aliens"). Unfortunately, the once promising
Alien franchise has rapidly degenerated into rock video
incomprehensibility (1993's "Alien III") and this latest mess, "Alien: 
Resurrection," slithering into theaters nationwide on Wednesday, 11/26. </P>
<P>Sigourney Weaver, looking haggard and gaunt in the
sinewy/heroin-addict chic mode of '90s haute couture, is back as the
irrepressible Ellen Ripley: implausible survivor of countless Alien
attacks and now at least two lousy Alien movies. Having plunged cruciform
to her death at the end of "Alien III" (she should have stayed there), the
one-time space pilot turned reluctant uber-femme and Alien hunter fulfills
the titular Lazarus event by emerging, via some sort of goofy cloning
hocus-pocus that's never fully explained, into a brave new world of
corrupt military officials and nihilistic scientific researchers hell-bent
on taming the ferocious Alien warriors for their own nefarious ends.</P>
<P>Bad idea, as it turns out. After a baby Alien queen is gruesomely
extracted from her abdominal cavity (the first of many deliberate
gross-outs), it becomes increasingly clear that there's much more to
Ripley than meets the eye. And when a scurvy, foul-mouthed band of
contraband-carrying space pirates shows up aboard a Ripley-haunted
scientific research vessel, jammed to the bulkheads with newly-birthed
Alien hombres (and lots of nameless grunts and crew-members for cannon
fodder), can the carnage be far behind?</P>
<P>Suffice it to say that you've seen it all before. As with the
raptors in "Jurassic Park," the slavering nasties again break loose in
spectacular fashion, and then quickly decimate the ranks of anyone
carrying a working firearm that doesn't jam at a critical moment, leaving
our beloved principals--none of whom ever come to life as
characters--stranded in a hostile, dimly lit environment with little-to-no
hope of escape or salvation (note to spaceship designers of the far
future, in which the film is set: ventilated steel decking is a VERY bad
idea). After a briefly suspensful underwater scene quoted directly from
"The Poiseidon Adventure"--but without the benefit of a Gene Hackman or
even a Shelly Winters to sell it emotionally--all that remain to challenge
the rampaging, toothy horde are Ripley and the mysterious terrorist known
only as "Call,"  played flatly and with an overt lack of enthusiasm by
that doe-eyed paragon of wren-boned perfection, Winona Ryder, who really
needs to eat more, and often, and whose repeated use of the "f" word to
convey mock surly-ness is about as charming and convincing as the rest of
this unholy and unwholesome mess. (And messy it is, too, as viewers are
time and again treated to ghastly images drawn straight from the
morgue-and-meatwagon school of filmmaking.) Where are Irwin Allen and
Ernie Borgnine when you need them?</P>
<P>Squandered amidst all the grue and splatter, of which there is at
least as much as in Paul Verhoeven's recent "Starship Troopers," are the
great Dan Hedaya as the ranking military officer, who, with an
over-the-top, spit-and-polish, gung-ho performance, seems to think that
he's actually in a remake of "Dr. Strangelove"; Michael Wincott, a slickly
frightening presence as the hippie-freak heavy in "The Crow," here reduced
to scenery chewing and, in short order, to that which is chewed; and
Weaver herself, who can't seem to decide if this is serious business or a
colossal joke: When, as the hybrid Alien-shaman lady, she puts her ear to
the deck and grimly announces that "they're moving; I can smell them," she
may as well have said "heap big war party over next ridge, kemosabe." 
Puh-leese.</P>
<P>Wasted too are a handful of mildly diverting subplots, including
one in which Ripley demonstrates superhuman physical powers. But if this
is the case, then why don't we see her fight an Alien in xeno-a-womano
combat? Her relationship with Ryder's Call, meant to echo that between her
and the orphaned urchin-child Newt in Cameron's "Aliens," similarly never
pays off. The director, French arthouse graduate Jean-Pierre Jeunet,
clearly lacks Cameron's thematic vision and narrative craft--not to
mention his flair for action scenes that crackle with intensity, instead
of those which drip with bodily fluids. Thus, where "Aliens"--never for a
moment lacking in thrills--sparkled with a refreshing humanity and pathos
largely unknown to the sci-fi action flick crowd, "Resurrection" merely
strobes its way blindly through blood-drenched attack after alien attack
(how many of these things are there, anyway?), without ever demonstrating
why it is, precisely, that we should be paying attention. Worth ignoring,
too, is a frankly offensive plot-thread implying an incestuous, and also
unabashedly bestial, sexual attraction between Ripley, the Aliens, and
what amounts to her bastard Alien grandson, whose graphic, on-screen
birth--envisioned as some sort of "symbolic" denouement by Jeunet--is
about as much fun to watch as a haggis-eating contest. Gross.</P>
<P>But it's not the ample gross-outs, nor the grossly underused cast,
that ultimately makes this "Alien" installment the most alienating of the
lot, as far removed from Cameron's peak achievement in the genre as the
"Freddy" movies are from "To Kill a Mockingbird." When we don't care about
the humans or the Aliens, it's damn hard to care about much of anything at
all.</P>
