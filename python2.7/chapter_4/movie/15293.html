<PRE>The Past Digs Itself Up</PRE>
<PRE>Review of Gods and Monsters (1998)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 8 November 1998 with Tony at the Quad for $8.</P>
<P>"You must please excuse me. You see, I'm blind," says the old man to the
monster--the noble, misunderstood, and murderous creature cobbled together
by Dr. Frankenstein. And so a pure but brief friendship ensues in The
Bride of Frankenstein.</P>
<P>Contrast this to the first meeting of Frankenstein's director James Whale
(Sir Ian McKellen) and yardsman Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser), where
first appearances prove deceptive. That friendship takes longer to blossom
but finds a real depth.</P>
<P>The movie opens during the final year in the life of gay film director
James Whale, best known as the director of Frankenstein and its first
sequel, and less known for The Invisible Man and Showboat. He suffers a
stroke, and while he remains as wily as ever in his 1950s-style
queer-dirty-old-man way, the past he spent his life escaping now "floods
all over" him. Not just moviemaking, but also the ghosts of a lost time
and lost possibilities. The memories of a boy brought up by people who
were "like a family of farmers given a giraffe and not knowing what to do
with it."</P>
<P>Clayton Boone proves to be an exception for Whale. He's not the typical
fawning acolyte, impressed by status and fame. In his own environment, the
trailer-dwelling gardener is surrounded by more simplistic people, who say
things like "Funny is funny. Scary is scary. You don't mix 'em." While
Whale slowly reveals himself to Boone, making himself visible a bit at a
time, his devoted yet somewhat disgusted housekeeper Hanna (Lynn Redgrave)
spills all the beans eventually ("He's a buggerer!") to Boone. Despite
having the gaps filled for him, he keeps coming back, posing for a
painting and befriending the ill, older man, finding a real affection and
respect for him. Remember, this is the mid-1950s. Such understanding
between two men so clearly different is not expected.</P>
<P>The friendship has two culminations--a hilarious one at a party thrown by
George Cukor (another gay director) for Princess Margaret, and a more
pathos-filled one later that evening during a thunderstorm. While
comparisons to Love and Death on Long Island have been made, Gods and
Monsters succeeds in two ways the earlier film did not: There is a certain
degree of fulfillment, and a greater sense of depth of the two
protagonists.</P>
<P>McKellen's performance is outstanding, as he vascilates from witty
(laughing off his "touch of stroke") to heartrending (as he remembers his
personal losses during World War I) to salacious and lubricious (cajoling
a reporter into stripping). (It almost makes up for the homophobic Apt
Pupil). Fraser holds his own as typical working man with an atypical
capacity for understanding. </P>
<P>Redgrave, as Hanna, brings a real Calvinism to her role as the
near-spousal devotee of her boss in a Hollywood where the invisible are
allowed to live out dissipated lifestyles as long as they keep it quiet.
Her almost puritanical outlook brings a real hilarity to the "den of
iniquity" she thinks she is tending.</P>
<P>Director Bill Condon brings a fullness to James Whale by mixing movies and
memories, alternating black and white with color, and humor with sadness.  
This has brought Gods and Monsters to a higher level that has garnered him
several awards already, was the toast of the New York Film Festival, and
has a lot of people calling for Oscar nominations. Based on Christopher
Bram's novel Father of Frankenstein (which received lukewarm reviews),
Condon's adaptation is one of those instances of the movie bettering a
book.</P>
<P>Also starring Lolita Davidovich, David Dukes, Jack Plotnick, and Rosalind
Ayres as a dead ringer for actress Elsa Lanchester (who played "The
Bride"). Original music by Carter Burwell. Cinematography by Stephen M.
Katz.</P>
