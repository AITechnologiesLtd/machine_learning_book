<P>Director: Errol Morris
Cast: Dave Hoover, George Mendonca, Ray Mendez, Rodney Brooks
Rated PG: Minor thematic elements</P>
<P>by Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>    I had no idea what to expect from Fast, Cheap & Out of Control. I
saw it simply because it was there. I knew ahead of time that it is a
documentary, and that it was directed by Errol Morris, but I couldn't
have even guessed about its content. And how pleasantly surprised I am!
Not only is the film fascinating and deeply informative (albeit centered
primarily around less-than-conversational topics), but Morris probes
seriously into some deep issues. The result is an enchanting, lively
film that anyone can watch and enjoy, and still learn something in the
process.</P>
<P>    The film is about four individuals who initially seem to have
nothing in common. Dave Hoover is a wild animal trainer for a circus. He
speaks at great lengths about the perils and rewards involved in
attempting to manipulate a lion. George Mendonca is a topiary
gardener--he shapes plantlife to look like animals. Ray Mendez is an
expert on the hideous mole-rat. And Rodney Brooks is a robot scientist
concerned with re-creating the way certain animals and insects move
about the earth.</P>
<P>    Visually, the film is striking. The cinematography, by Robert
Richardson (who commonly works on Oliver Stone films), is full of truly
absorbing images. Often times, throughout the film's amazingly brief
80-minute running time, the audience is given an image that is almost
shocking in nature--Mendonca standing on a ladder, for instance,
trimming one of his animals in the darkened rain. What goes along
perfectly with this is the music by Caleb Sampson. The soundtrack
continually pulses throughout the film with a lively, energetic feeling
that drives the film at a brisk pace. Even if you aren't interested in
the subject material, the film would be a feast for the eyes.</P>
<P>    Fortunately, Morris has gone to great lengths to make sure that
there's no way you can't be interested in the subject matter. Not only
are the four professions described in the film fascinating on their own,
but their relation to each other is the central meaning that Morris
manages to convey. He says something profound about life an existence
here, and it doesn't feel overwrought and pretentious--it's a
level-headed, public oriented message. In concept, it's almost so
obvious that I was surprised I had never thought of it before.</P>
<P>    Take Brooks, for example, whose comments on robots taking over human
life in the future are truly alarming. Here is a guy making machines
that imitate insect life almost perfectly. Before watching this film, I
had no idea that robot technology was already so advanced. Mix this with
the musings of Mendonca, who explains why the modern electric shears are
totally useless for what he does--he requires detail, and so only
old-fashioned hand shears can do the work appropriately. Meanwhile,
Mendez is totally fascinated with the way his mole-rats roll in their
feces to identify one another. And Hoover modestly explains that, if the
lion were to understand its power, that the human taunting it would
never stand a chance.</P>
<P>    But what do these guys have to do with one another? Well, that's why
you need to see the film. I think to truly understand and gather
everything that Morris has packed into this movie, one needs to see it
more than once. This is the way all documentaries should be--interesting
and entertaining on the surface, but also containing underlying themes
that aren't apparent just from idly watching. Fast, Cheap & Out of
Control didn't change my life, but it did change the way that I look at
this genre. It also gave me something to think about, and that alone is
worth something these days.</P>
