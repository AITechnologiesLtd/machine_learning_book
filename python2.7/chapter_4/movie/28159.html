THE TAILOR OF PANAMA
--------------------</PRE>
<P>Andy Osnard (Pierce Brosnan, "The World Is Not Enough") has just about used up 
the good will of MI6 when he's assigned to Panama to keep an eye on British
interests in the Canal.  In order to gain contacts and information, Andy
ferrets out Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush, "Quills"), an ex-convict with a
Saville Row front in "The Tailor of Panama."</P>
<P>Adapted from the John le Carre novel by the author, director John Boorman
("The General") and Andrew Davies, "The Tailor of Panama is a cheeky lark
about an immoral agent playing colleagues, superiors and countries against
each other to his own benefit while spinning an 'innocent' tailor into a
duplicitous stew.  While family man Harry Pendel doesn't deserve Andy's 
blackmailing, he's susceptible to it because he's duped his wife along 
with his customers and is facing financial difficulties.  Harry's a decent 
fellow who remains loyal to  anti-Noriega freedom fighters Marta (Leonor 
Varela, TV's "Cleopatra"), who was brutally disfigured, and Mickie Abraxas 
(Brendan Gleeson, "The General") now a brokendown alcoholic.  Yet he uses 
these two to concoct a story about "The Silent Opposition," a group 
purportedly arming up to defend the Panamian President's selling of the Canal 
to a) Japan, b) France or c) China/Taiwan. </P>
<P>Andy's bs detector is on, but he figures Pendel's story will be bought.  
It is, and soon offers in the millions rain down from the U.S. via 
Osnard's boss Cavendish (Johathan Hyde).  That hasn't stopped Osnard 
from attempting to also get at Harry via his wife Louisa (Jamie Lee Curtis),
an American who just happens to work for U.S. Government interests in
the Canal with unshakeable loyalty.  She's already sensed something amiss
with Harry, though, and goes on the offensive.  Meanwhile, Harry's 
make-believe has caused events to take such a dramatic turn that he's 
shaken to his core.</P>
<P>"The Tailor of Panama" works wonderfully in its playful setup right up
through the beginning of an American invasion of Panama City (played
for yucks and getting them!).  Deceit is everywhere, from Harry's seemingly
sympathetic banker (Jon Polito, "Stuart Little") calling in a loan to 
naive Cavendish's handling of the U.S.  Osnard plays hard and fast to bed 
British diplomat attache Francesca (Catherine McCormack, "Braveheart").  
Harry amusingly gets advice from Uncle Benny (Harold Pintner), the 
deceased Jewish Uncle who set him up in Panama.</P>
<P>The film goes into a nose dive, however, as the two leads get into serious 
business trying to outmaneuver one another.  There's no satisfaction in 
the wrapup, in which the (marginally) 'good' guy barely squeezes out of 
harm's way as corruption still reigns.</P>
<P>Rush gives another delightful performance as the put upon Pendel, whether
he's chalking up a suit pattern, making breakfast for his kids or trying
to keep one step ahead of Osnard.  He gains audience empathy as a man 
deserving the second chance Uncle Benny provided.  Brosnan has a ball 
turning his suave Bond agent sideways with malicious glee and his is a 
fun performance to watch.  Gleeson is odd casting as a Panamian rebel, 
but he takes ownership of the character and makes us believe he's a 
Central American hero destroyed by his own fighting spirit.  Jamie Lee
Curtis brings little to her role as the bewildered wife in a lackluster
performance.  Get your first screen glimpse of the boy cast as Harry Potter, 
Daniel Radcliffe, as Harry and Louisa's son Mark.</P>
<P>The film, shot on location in Panama by cinematographer by Philippe
Rousselot ("Remember the Titans"), looks sweatily slick.  Editting is
comical while the film remains in hijinx mode.  Bush family supporters
will have their noses tweaked.  </P>
<P>"The Tailor of Panama" is best when it's shaken, not stirred.</P>
