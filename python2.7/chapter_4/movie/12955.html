<PRE>(Commentary only)<HR></PRE>
<P>A daring thought, if I may: Grease in the 70's is no where near as
impressive as Grease in the 90's.  Whilst the film; first released in
the beginning-of-the-end of "the psychedelic era", may have been a
spectacular, vivid musical celebration back then, I sense that it means
so much more now.  Not only is it a celebration, but it's a
retrospective celebration.  It's a journey back in time to when leather
jackets clearly defined the cool from the nerdy, when Jimi Hendrix
rocked on and when sex was safe.  It looks genuine, because it is.
Through the span of twenty years, Grease has lost none of its charm and,
if anything, is more magical now than ever before.  In summary: it was
great back then.  It's even greater now.</P>
<P>John Travolta (at that time, famous for his role in Saturday Night Live)
stars as the now legendary character of Danny Zuko, who had the perfect
summer romance with Australian Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John).  But
school comes all too soon for the two, and they split paths - mistakably
thinking that they will never see each other again. On the first day at
Rydell High we find Danny with a slick, leather jacketed image as the
leader of the "T-Birds."  The rebellious T-Birds comprises of Danny and
his friends - Kenickie (Jeff Conaway), Doody (Barry Pearl), Sonny
(Michael Tucci) and Putzie (Kelly Ward).  Meanwhile, the T-Birds female
counterparts - the "Pink Ladies" - welcome Sandy (who transferred
schools to Rydell) to the school.  It doesn't take long for Danny and
Sandy to meet again, but this time Danny has a reputation to live up
to - so things don't go as well as he would have liked.</P>
<P>As the couple begin to appreciate each other again, different subplots
emerge as the Pink Ladies' Rizzo (Stockard Channing) has the possibility
of being pregnant from a rousing night with Kenickie, and Frenchy (Didi
Conn) quits Rydell to go to beauty school.</P>
<P>If I did have a gripe about Grease, it's a small one: occasionally, the
films conversion from spoken dialogue to sung is not as good as it
should be.  In one scene, involving Frenchy and her "guardian angel," a
rendition of "Beauty School Dropout" is included simply to add another
song to the track list.  It may be enjoyable, but it isn't entirely
appropriate - the best types of musicals are those that feel exactly
like one, not just a collection of scenes with musical slabs meshed in
to create a higher entertainment level.  But on the whole, Grease's
lyrics are wonderfully written, and the unashamedly 70's style dialogue
is charming and easy to absorb.</P>
<P>I have no doubt that the same people who have ignored Grease's
flourishing existence will dodge the re-release at all costs.  But for
many - fans and spectators alike - Grease should still be the word as we
remember, with loyal respect, such a screen wonder that paved its way
through two grueling decades of film - looking better with every year
behind its back.</P>
