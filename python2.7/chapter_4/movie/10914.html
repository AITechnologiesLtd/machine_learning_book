<PRE>"Deep Rising" - Sinking Fast
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>If you're the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you
long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn (butter optional),
then this is the movie for you!  Indeed, this has got to be either one
of the most unimaginative rip-offs of other recent action movies, or
an incredibly unfunny spoof of them.  It's difficult to fathom such
insipidness unless you actually watch this film.  But at least we're
warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase, giving us
an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show.</P>
<P>What are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie?  First,
the movie gives us an introductory premise.  Huge caverns exist deep
beneath the ocean floor, and in this area, many ships have
disappeared.  Oooh...scary!  Secondly, a cheesy soundtrack tries to
connote a tone of mystery, but only succeeds in drowning our ears with
an abrasive musical score.  Third, the main character is a mercenary
that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo
(Treat Williams).  He operates a sophisticated military-style PT boat
and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical
flippancy.  Finally, in the cargo hold, we see those that hired him.
They are also mercenaries that have tough-looking haircuts, talk with
accents, and try to show how macho they are.</P>
<P>During their trip across the stormy sea, their boat suffers an
incident and requires repairs.  Spotting a cruise ship in the
distance, they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to
raid the machine shop, take the parts that they need, and then
continue on their merry way.  Little do they know that this cruise
ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster.  Yet, they
board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that
can kill dozens in a matter of seconds.</P>
<P>This is nothing more than a by-the-book action film.  Their
realization of the situation that they're in doesn't happen until they
are in the bowels of the boat.  Those who are dumb enough to stray off
on their own will ultimately get killed.  The corridors on the ship
are narrow, misty, and provide the kind of atmosphere that all
scare-fests must have. Yet, despite the predictable nature of this
film, there are some scary "boo" moments.  But most of it is just
outright silly.  And this film is unusually gory too.  Monsters
basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains.  There is
one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and
reveals a victim that is still alive.  He screams horribly as the
monster's digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away.
Additionally, it borrows heavily from Speed2, Alien and a bunch of
other recent films.  The mercenaries even run into a lone, surviving
passenger (Femke Jannsen) who looks amazingly like Sandra Bullock.</P>
<P>To be honest, when I left the theatre, I just had to laugh at how
witless the film was.  It's moronic fun at best.  So, if you're
hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of
silliness, then this might just hit the spot.</P>
