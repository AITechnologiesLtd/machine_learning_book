<PRE>THE NEWTON BOYS
 By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 20th Century Fox
 Director:  Richard Linklater
 Writer:  Claude Stanush, Clark Lee Walker, Richard Linklater
 Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Julianna Margulies, Ethan
Hawke, Skeet Ulrich, Vincent D'Onofrio</PRE>
<P>   "Why do you rob banks?" asked a journalist to Willie
Sutton.  "Because that's where the money is," he answered, a
one-liner which insured Mr. Sutton's place as one of the best
known of his profession.  Now, Richard Linklater, who
directed "The Newton Boys" in a script he co-wrote with
Claude Stanush and Clark Lee Walker (based on a book by
Stanush), aims to make a group of four men as famous as
Sutton. In fact, when its principal character, Willis Newton
(Matthew McConaughey), rallies his brothers, he uses a
similar expression, "We're gonna get the big banks because
that's where the money is."  </P>
<P>   "The Newton Boys" is the story of four bank robbers who,
according to production notes, pulled off the most lucrative
train robbery in U.S. history when they ended their career by
ripping off a huge stash from a mail train outside of Chicago
in the early 1920s.  The movie is based on a book written by
former Life magazine reporter Claude Stanush, who had
gained the confidence of Willis and Joe Newton in 1973 and
got their story in a series of interviews which grew into a full
volume.</P>
<P> In translating the story from page to screen, director Richard
Linklater--heretofore known for his sophomoric albeit involving
movies "Slacker" and "Dazed and Confused"--goes for the
light touch.  The story is conceivably inspired by one of the
great caper movies, George Roy Hill's 1969 "Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid" (about outlaws Paul Newman and
Robert Redford who are pursued by a relentless but remote
sheriff's posse), but Linklater's creation lacks the sharp
dialogue, originality, and the score of that masterwork. 
Though the picture is sporadically dramatic and involving, for
the most part its attempts at levity are leaden, the chemistry
between Matthew McConaughey and Julianne Margulies
unconvincing, and given the lackadaisical planning and
generally drunken condition of the brothers, their overall
success not credible.  The story is bogged down from time to
time by the whining of the perps, particularly Mr.
McConaughey in the role of the gang leader, Willis Newton,
who insists that the banks abused him, and he was only one
thief robbing from another.  His whimpering begins early on
when he gripes about the rejection of his courtship by the
girl's father, who continued to employ him in the fields: "An
ex-con is not good enough for his daughter, but he's good
enough to pick cotton."</P>
<P>   Edited briskly by Sandra Adair, the film shifts smoothly from
a collage of small banks blown sky-high to scenes of the
robbers playing at being gentlemen; from close-ups of the
safecrackers carefully pouring nitroglycerin into the crevices of
the locks to their feeble attempts at humor.  The last category
highlights some cornball sallies, as when a strikingly clean-cut
Willis Newton asks the lovely hotel shopkeeper Louise Brown
Julianna Margulies) what's fun to do in Omaha, receiving the
reply, "You can chew gum," or when one of the gang
anticipates investing his money in stock and bonds: "Silk
stocks and bonded whiskey."</P>
<P>   While Matthew McConaughey's character is reasonably well
developed, his partners in crime are for the most part ciphers
who fail to win our sympathy or interest because of their
odious ways.  Ethan Hawke in particular plays Jess Newton
as an infantile drunk, an unlikely partner in the burglaries of
eighty banks and a mail train, while the usually superb
Vincent D'Onofrio makes embarrassing attempts to engage in
horseplay with his brothers.  Skeet Ulrich's character, Joe
Newton, is merely a wide-eyed cipher, and other criminals,
notably Charles Gunning as Slim, are stereotypes, smirking in
the obvious ways in which brigands have been depicted for
decades in the old-fashioned Westerns.</P>
<P>   Linklater seems determined to portray these robbers in the
style of the cowboy films that shrouded the TV sets of the
sixties, substituting hotel clerk Louise for the cliched, tough
but vulnerable saloon-keeper of the "Gunsmoke" era and
slipping in implausible scenes as when Slim shows up
unannounced where the Newton boys are holed up and tells
Willis with a smirk, "You can look me up in Chicago" before
disappearing into the horizon.  Perhaps truth is stranger than
fiction, though.  Though the boys pulled over eighty burglaries
including several armed robberies (without killing anyone),
they ultimately received sentences as light as nine months. 
As the credits roll, an epilogue depicts two of the actual, aging
Newton boys in interviews, one with Johnny Carson, neither
exchange particularly insightful. Rated PG-13.  Running Time:
124 minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey Karten</P>
