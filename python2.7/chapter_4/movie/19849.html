<P>I hate to admit it, but the blistering satire DICK made more sense to me
in explaining the ins and outs of the Watergate scandal than any news
reporter or political analyst of the day ever did.  Sure it's revisionist
history... but at least it tied up every loose end and answered every
question.  Besides, it was a lot more fun to sit through than the real
thing.</P>
<P>According to DICK, it all begins when 15 year olds Betsy Jobs (Kirsten
Dunst, DROP DEAD GORGEOUS) and Arlene Lorenzo (Michelle Williams, DAWSON'S
CREEK) leave the Watergate hotel where they are staying in order to mail a
love letter to teen idol Bobby Sherman.  Their actions, when sneaking out
of the complex, prompt a guard's call to the police who then stumble upon
the Watergate burglars.</P>
<P>Later, during a high school field trip tour through the White House, they
meet up with G. Gordon Liddy (Harry Shearer, SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE), Bob
Haldeman (Dave Foley, KIDS IN THE HALL), Henry Kissinger (Saul Rubinek,
BAD MANNERS), and John Dean (Jim Breuer, SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE).  Being teen
aged girls, they of course lavish all their attention upon Checkers the
dog.</P>
<P>While all the president's men try to decide how to handle these two
bubble-brained adolescents, President Nixon ("Call me Dick") takes matters
into his own hands because, to use his own oily words, "I have a way with
young people.  They trust me."  He christens them official "White House
dog walkers" and "secret youth advisors."</P>
<P>Thus begins an irreverent romp through modern history as Betsy and Arlene
are credited with being inadvertently responsible for: the end of the
Vietnam War; a new peace initiative between the US and the USSR; Nixon's
signature "V" pose; erasing eighteen and one-half minutes of presidential
tape and; giving the bickering Washington Post reporters Woodward and
Bernstein the biggest story of their careers.</P>
<P>Director Andrew Fleming (THE CRAFT) and newcomer Sheryl Longin
co-scripted DICK and were so faithful to their initial premise and so
inventive in carrying it out, that there is an unexpected plausibility to
the outrageous scenarios being depicted.</P>
<P>It helps that both Miss Dunst and Miss Williams are priceless, being
delightfully giddy and appropriately pubescent in their characterizations.
Miss Williams is especially amusing as her Arlene fantasizes about
President Nixon to the point that he replaces Bobby Sherman as her
teen-dream poster boy.</P>
<P>  The girls manage to play the naiveté of their on-screen roles with a
sweet genuineness and believability that serves to enhance their
crestfallen disappointment and teen-aged ire once they realize that their
Dick is "a bad man!"</P>
<P>The confrontation between these two teenyboppers and their President
after they hear his private tapes (before the expletives were deleted) is
not only a hoot, it is somehow oddly rewarding.  How many of us wished we
could have said these words to President Nixon's face:  "You've got a
potty-mouth!"</P>
<P>In a brilliant piece of casting, Dan Hedaya was tapped to play the
"Tricky Dick" caricature of Nixon and he does himself proud.   His Dick
Nixon is shifty, incapable of sincerity, and deserves to go down.</P>
<P>Trust is something that once lost, is almost impossible to regain.  All
comedy aside, the two female leads had no reason to distrust their
president until he gave them cause.</P>
<P>A lie is never excusable.  No matter how tempting it might be to offer a
lie to avoid a punishment, a lie will always lead to a worse consequence.</P>
<P>"Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be
filled with gravel."  Proverbs 20:17 [KJV]</P>
<P>We can only hope that this is a lesson that, sooner or later, our
presidents will be sure to learn.</P>
