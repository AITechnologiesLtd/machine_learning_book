<P>     Chantel (Ariyan Johnson) is a 17-year old high school student
living in a housing project in Brooklyn.  With excellent grades, high
spirits, and even higher aspirations, she intends to graduate a year
early, get into college, then go to medical school.  As she sees them,
her future plans are set in stone.  Then she meets Tyrone (Kevin
Thigpen).  Pretty soon, one thing leads to another, and Chantel ends up
pregnant.  Undecided about an abortion, she must face critical
questions upon which her entire future rests.</P>
<P>     JUST ANOTHER GIRL ON THE I.R.T. (the I.R.T. is a New York subway
system) tells a story that has been told a million times before.  It's
also something familiar on a more intimate, personal level to countless
Americans.  Nevertheless, as familiar and unspectacular as the plot
might be, the manner in which the film looks at the subject is
decidedly different.  Leslie Harris brings a gritty perspective to this
tale, making it seem more fresh and interesting than it actually is,
and illustrating that it isn't just boys who live and suffer in the
hood.</P>
<P>     One of the film's strong points is that it gives us a rather stark
view of some of the root causes of teenage pregnancy.  In a discussion
with some of her friends, Chantel claims that if a man and a woman have
sex standing up, she can't get pregnant.  Another girl says that
pregnancy can't happen during a woman's period, and still another
advocates withdrawal as a 100% foolproof method of birth control.
These ideas are not just some filmmaker's plot device; they're a
legitimate reflection of what a large portion of the teenage population
(male and female) believes, and a good indication of why there are so
many young mothers.</P>
<P>     The questions that Chantel has to answer following her pregnancy
are those that every girl in her position is faced with.  Should she
have an abortion?  Can she tell her parents?  How will her boyfriend
react?  She faces the situation by doing her best to hide it and
thereby deny its existence, even going so far as to raid the
refrigerator by night and throw out food so that her bulging midsection
can be explained by midnight binges.</P>
<P>     The greatest weakness of JUST ANOTHER GIRL ON THE I.R.T. is not
its story, but an unfortunate tendency to preach to the audience.
While I applaud Leslie Harris' desire to get certain issues out into
the open (such as the need to give a truer perspective on history than
is commonly found in many of America's classrooms), her methods leave a
little to be desired.  Having one of the characters launch into a
didactic monologue not only lacks subtlety, but ruins the atmosphere of
the scene.  Other movies have found better ways to integrate messages;
Leslie Harris should have taken lessons from them.</P>
<P>     The production values are low, but this serves to further heighten
the sense of starkness.  Acting, all done by complete unknowns, varies
from excellent (Ariyan Johnson) to mediocre.  There are times when some
of the performers appear to be reciting something from a script rather
than speaking from the heart.  Chantel, however, is consistently played
with high energy and an appealing sassiness.</P>
<P>     Overall, while JUST ANOTHER GIRL ON THE I.R.T. doesn't have the
power or emotional depth of a BOYZ 'N THE HOOD, it is not without its
strengths.  There are a number of memorable moments.  A childbirth
scene is one of those.  It is perhaps the most realistic that I've ever
seen portrayed in a non-documentary--not just a couple of grunts and
groans and out pops a baby.  So, while the message of the film is as
old as human society, the method of its presentation is new enough to
make the movie worthwhile.</P>
