<P>     Oh, where to begin?  This morning-after mess of a movie, starring
Val Kilmer as the latest screen incarnation of Leslie Charteris'
gentleman thief, is billed as a "romantic thriller." Meaning, and when
translated into a language that test audiences can understand, a movie
with an action hero who talks about his feelings.  That's right-- a
roguish, real *James Bond* of a character who mouths "I love you" and
makes goo-goo eyes and, Heaven help us, has a moral crisis before
screwing somebody's brains out.  All of this would be fine, of course,
if we could believe even a minute of any scene starring Elisabeth Shue.
The Academy Award-nominated actress is horribly miscast as the intro-
verted, poetry-sensitive, cold-fusion scientist with, get ready, a heart
condition.  (I'm going to spoil the surprise:  one scene puts the pair
in handcuffs, with Kilmer palming her pills on the sly!  Hilarious!) Her
best worst moments are when she looks in the direction of the camera,
wearing an expression of vacancy as glaring as a neon sign.</P>
<P>     THE SAINT is preposterous in other places.  A couple of Kilmer's
disguises are absolute howlers.  (His long-haired Spaniard is pretty
funny.  As is his buck-toothed Nutty Professor.) Every Russian somehow
speaks English.  A later sewer sequence makes no sense.  (Where in the
Hell did they find those flashlights?) And, in an equally far-fetched
climax, a mob of thousands miraculously understands the significance of
a miraculous energy source.  Oh, and let's not forget that coda!  The
final fifteen minutes of this movie have to be seen to be disbelieved.
More sex.  Another of Shue's laughably vacant stares.  Kilmer getting
cutesy.  An encore presentation of the Jerry Lewis disguise.  And, even,
a botched joke involving the theme to the television series!  (Hint:
listen closely.) Rates higher than lousy, though, for production values
and location photography, both of which are exemplary. </P>
