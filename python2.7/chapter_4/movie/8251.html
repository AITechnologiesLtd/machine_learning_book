<PRE>                       GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE</PRE>
<P>Remember George when he was a mere cartoon back in the 1960s?   He
is now alive and well in this boisterous, most enjoyable, laughable
version interpreted by Brendan Fraser. George is just short of being
dimwitted but then, how would you be if every time you swung from a
jungle vine you went crashing into a huge tree?   Despite that,
George keeps on grinning, happy with the jungle friends, the wise
ape whose name is "Ape" (voice of John Cleese),  the drum-playing
chimps, the lion, the toucan and George's own pet dog who just
happens to look exactly like an elephant but, it must be admitted,
does behave like a dog.</P>
<P>So this inept Tarzan-more-or-less-clone loves his home.   We know
this because there is a narrator's voice (Keith Scott)  with a great
sense of humor, who fills us in on anything we ourselves may not be
aware of.  There is Ursala Stanhope (Leslie Mann) who is on safari
in Africa.   When George, who has never seen a woman, first meets
her he wonders what kind of "funny-looking fella" is this?   I told
you he has been hit on the head just a bit too often,</P>
<P>George takes the willing Ursala to his 2-storied home while Lyle Van
de Groot  (Thomas Haden Church), her ostensible sweetheart and
safari-companion worries that the giant ape they are seeking may
have carried her off.      George gives up the jungle to return with
Ursala to the "civilization" of San Francisco (as exemplified by
Ursala's mother Beatrice Stanhope (Holland Taylor) who informs
George that if he does not give up Ursala, Mother will see that
George will no longer have a need for  wearing a loin cloth.    (One
of several bits of adult humor.)   As it happens, George has to
return to Africa (with Ursala) because poachers are after his
friends.   Before George leaves San Francisco, he has some hair-
raising adventures atop the Golden Gate bridge (Joey Preston is the
stuntman).</P>
<P>Expecting another Disney film suitable solely for younger children,
I was most pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing from
beginning to end at this live and lively version of George, suitable
for adults as well as kids.   To top it off is the beautiful take
off of The Lion King which I will not describe.    Go see for
yourself; it is one funny, slapstick movie.</P>
