<PRE>                               MIMIC 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                       1 :-)  for the Judas Breed</PRE>

<P>Ever thumped a fat bug with a book, and then watch it's insides splatter
on the wallpaper? It's the kind of sight that generally grosses people
out so I personally prefer spraying the bug to death. It's hands free,
hygienic and compact. Why swat the fly when you can fry it with
chemicals. This brings me to my point on the big, bad ugly bugs known as
the Judas breed. Once the salvation of mankind but now it's demise.
Mutated and evolved in a period of three years into horrific flying
creatures breeding in the murky depths of a city sewer and feeding
silently on fleshy prey. So if you're a fly swatter and not a bug
sprayer - this movie is for you. Imagine the juicy remains on wall or
book. Imagine a lot of it. Then imagine wiping the bug insides over
yourself over and over again. In "Mimic" the key to survival is the
perfume of bug slime, and the aroma of death is none other than human
blood.</P>
<P>Now imaging a spider in a feeding frenzy, or a preying mantis cleverly
dissecting its prey with razor sharp jaws. Now magnify this picture by a
hundred times and watch this enormous bug rip apart several children,
several cops, several homeless people, somebody's father and a homeless
Reverend. My query - was it really necessary to slaughter the boys - it
rather defeats the purpose of an innocent bug hunt. AND is it ethical to
murder a father in front of his son's eyes?  It isn't everyday that we
are made to see a child watch his father pierced with scissor-like fangs
and have his blood splatter over him.  It's a rather sloppy and
insensitive scene if you ask me. The father reaches out for his child
and before you know it - splat - lots of holes through the torso and
blood foaming at the mouth. How does a child respond to this?</P>
<P>So despite this movie's wanton thirst for blood, bug poop and
fascination with bug insides, it does create a confused and fascinating
story about the web of life. This time we are the prey and the insect
are the predator. It gives as a different perspective on life when the
giants are insects, and it's their turn to wreak revenge on humans who
wouldn't give two hoots to another bug gone under the boot. The heroine
(Mira Sorvino) does a good job faking terror, as she is privileged
enough to face the male drone in hand to hand combat and win -
politically correct. As for the our Hero (Jeremy Northam), who was the
dashing Mr Knightley in Emma, is present dashing about this movie
blowing up the female bugs which is not so politically correct. Also our
Hero and Heroine are trying to reproduce and are having great difficulty
conceiving a child despite repeated attempts. The writer's solution to
this problem is kill the autistic kid's father, make him an orphan,
place him in the middle of the hive and somebody will just have to adopt
him - I wonder who?</P>
<P>So I really should have hated this movie more for all the above reasons,
but somehow, I didn't and I don't know why. For some unexplained reason
my fascination with the big bad insect kept me interested throughout.
Personally I would have liked to spray the six legged vermin from a
distance, being a "Mortein" kind of a guy; but I guess on occasion I
won't mind getting my hands dirty, and slapping a bug or two around for
recreational purposes.</P>
