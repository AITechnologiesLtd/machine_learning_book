<PRE>BRING IT ON</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Peyton Reed
Written by: Jessica Bendinger</PRE>
<P>Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) is a high school senior, facing a few 
problems. First, she has just become the new captain of her cheerleading 
squad. That's a problem because most of the team doesn't want her there, and 
she has quite a legacy to live up to since the former captain led the team 
to five straight championship victories. She's also having problem with her 
boyfriend, who just went off to college. While he's away, she starts eyeing 
a new student, Cliff (Jesse Bradford), whose sister, Missy (Eliza Dushku), 
is the latest addition to the cheerleading squad. Her last problem is her 
most severe. Torrance just found out that all the team's cheers have been 
stolen from a neighboring, urban school's team. That school, called the 
Clovers, is finally sending its team to the championship, and Torrance needs 
a new cheer so she won't be stealing. With only a few weeks till the 
championship, Torrance has to find a solution to all three of her problems, 
or quite cheerleading for good.</P>
<P>Did that sound just a little cheesy to everyone? I thought so too. I usually 
don't do this, but I thought I'd better warn everyone that this review 
contains at least one statement that might be viewed as a spoiler. "Bring it 
On" bills itself as a comedy; but since there's only one funny scene in the 
film, it's more akin to a... well, it has elements of an... umm. Oh forget 
it, I'm not sure just what "Bring it On" was supposed to be, and I'm not 
entirely sure Peyton Reed knew what he was trying to make either. I suppose 
this is just another movie which can be added to the ever growing list of 
teen films (a genre I detest more and more with each passing week). In other 
words, "Bring it On" is a cliched, predictable movie which appeals only to 
those who understand high school lingo (I didn't even understand high school 
lingo when I was in high school). If you enjoy these sorts of teen movies, 
you should have a blast. The rest of you will either be bored stiff or 
violently ill (I hadn't eaten, so I was only bored stiff). Actually, the 
only reason I was talked into seeing this movie was because I was curious 
how Bendinger would write an ending that would avoid being both cliched and 
politically incorrect. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised at the 
cliched, politically correct finale. I'll give you two guesses who wins, but 
you're only going to need one.</P>
<P>I seem to be one of those strange people who can't understand this Kirsten 
Dunst craze. I'm sorry, but in my opinion, the girls simply cannot act. She 
either overdoes it, like she does in this and in the overrated "Dick"; or 
she under plays it like she did in "The Virgin Suicides". Her supporting 
cast doesn't offer much in the way of help, with nearly everyone turning in 
performances that never rise above mediocre. The only exception is Eliza 
Dushku (television's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"), playing the team's newest 
member. While I never thought of Dushku as much of a talent when she first 
showed up on "Buff", I'm forced to admit that her acting abilities have 
improved considerably, and she turns in such a good performance in "Bring it 
On" that she nearly makes the film watchable. However, close only counts in 
horseshoes and handgrenades. One good performance can seldom hold a movie 
afloat when surrounded by bad performances. When it's surrounded by such 
performances and used in a poor script, it's lost amidst the rabble.</P>
<P>I suppose I could be mistaken about how funny "Bring it On" actually is. 
There were two teenage boys a few rows behind me who were laughing so hard I 
thought I was going to have to call an ambulance. The thing that confused me 
is what they were laughing at. Tell me, do you find the word "fag" funny? 
I'm sure a few of you said yes. Okay, do you find the word "fag" funny after 
it has been used about two dozen times? If so, "Bring it On" is just the 
movie for you. The film's jokes never rise above that level of humor, except 
in the one, truly funny scene of the film. When Torrance's team calls in a 
special cheerleader trainer named Sparky (newcomer Ian Roberts), it leads to 
a hysterical five minute scene. Sparky decides to bring his own brand of 
cheerleading to the group, and puts the team on a special training program. 
This includes putting all the girls on diets because, as he says, "You girls 
are being thrown in the air, and you can't throw fat people as high." He 
also proceeds to go through each girl in the class and tell them all their 
faults (in great detail, when discussing the size of one girl's rear end). 
The scene only lasts five minutes, but you'll get more laughs in those few 
minutes than you will at the rest of the movie (in fact, I didn't get a 
single laugh from the rest of the movie).</P>
<P>One of the biggest problems I had with "Bring it On" was that the entire 
plot about the two teams competing against each other was pointless. That's 
the entire plot though, right? Hardly, since the Clovers team is only in 
about fifteen minutes of the movie. If the film had been about the new 
captain having to whip an out of practice team into shape, maybe there would 
have been something to it. Instead, by featuring a race related contest, 
Benedinger insures that someone is going to be offended, and to be perfectly 
frank, I was. When lines like "You think a white girl could have thought up 
moves like those?" are prominantly featured in a movie, and are then 
tolerated by audiences, I have to wonder at the state of Hollywood. Okay, my 
rant is over with. The soundtrack to "Bring it On" features, get this, 
cheerleading songs. In other words, you've heard it all before, but it's 
still appropriate to the movie. The movie runs only 98 minutes, but feels 
more than a bit longer. I'd recommend "Bring it On" to those of you who 
simply adore both teen flicks and cheerleader outfits (but not if you only 
like cheerleader outfits), and give the movie two and a half out of five 
stars.</P>
