<PRE>                               UNSTRUNG HEROES
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Diane Keaton's directorial debut is a very impressive one.  UNSTRUNG
HEROES is a smart, bittersweet drama about a boy growing up in postwar
suburbia.  Twelve-year old Steven Lidz (Nathan Watt) is surrounded by his
inventor father (John Turturro) and nearly-insane uncles Danny and Arthur
(SEINFELD's Michael Richards and Maury Chaykin).  When his mother Selma
(Andie McDowell) develops cancer from her chain smoking, Steven's life
begins to slowly unravel.</P>
<P>     The pressures of Selma's illness take their toll on everyone, and
Steven becomes lost in the cyclone of anger and sorrow that accompanies
any tragedy like this.  To find peace, Steven runs away to stay with his
uncles, where he finds a new world of self-realization, living on his own
terms instead of the indifferent rules set down by his father and by
society.</P>
<P>     Along the way, the antics of Steven's uncles and the outrageous
inventions that his father develops are hilarious, and the trio play off
of each other like a seasoned comedy troupe.  Watching Steven's
metamorphasis from introvert to extrovert is similarly funny.</P>
<P>     This film is worth seeing if for no other reason than to see
Richards's Oscar-caliber performance, but UNSTRUNG HEROES offers so much
more.  The story of loss and rebirth is genuinely touching, and while the
plot meanders and seems to break down in places, it somehow seems
appropriate, almost mimicking the characters' lives.  Ultimately, the
picture is a truly memorable look at dealing with pain while maintaining
your sanity.</P>
<P>     On a personal level, I also enjoyed the general contempt that the
medical profession receives in the film, especially regarding the doctors'
constant inability to act or even offer explanations for Selma's illness. 
It's a frightening metaphor that's just as relevant today.</P>
