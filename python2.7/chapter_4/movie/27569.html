<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>As moviegoers, there is a temptation to believe that we understand more 
about the actors and actresses than we really do. All too often, fans come 
to think that they know how the stars behave off-screen, when in fact 
they're merely extrapolating from the performers' on-screen personas. 
Natalie Portman, for example, stirred up a minor controversy last year 
when she dared to suggest that those "Star Wars" aficionados who would 
approach her thinking they could automatically be friends had the wrong 
idea.</P>
<P>Denys Arcand's new film "Stardom" takes this cult of celebrity as its 
inspiration. It's a movie about how stars are as much manufactured as they 
are born -- how the way a person appears on camera may not only be 
completely different from the way they really are, but even different from 
the way they want to be seen. In particular, Arcand examines the rise from 
obscurity of a model -- because, after all, what better embodies the 
notion of packaging over personality better than modelling, a career which 
is all about grooming your appearance, and very little else? In a scathing 
lampoon of the industry, "Stardom" depicts its inherent superficiality by 
examining the way that true identity is not only glossed over but, in 
fact, is virtually quashed.</P>
<P>Tina Menzhal (Jessica Pare) is a small-town hockey player in Cornwall, 
Ontario, who happens to be captured in a nationally-distributed 
photograph. Tina's alluring, enigmatic (but entirely accidental) pose 
captures the attention of fashion photographer Philippe Gascon (Charles 
Berling) and soon her star begins to rise on the Canadian modelling scene. 
But fame is a fleeting thing, and Tina quickly finds her stock dropping,
particularly after a disastrous attempt to give her face international 
recognition by working in Paris.</P>
<P>Just when it seems Tina's career is on the verge of fizzling as quickly as 
it came about, though, she has the good fortune to sign on with a powerful 
agent (Thomas Gibson from TV's "Dharma & Greg" in a delightfully subdued 
performance). Soon, Tina is a household name and a tabloid fixture -- 
especially as she finds herself the object of affection of various 
powerful men, including Gascon, restauranteur Barry Levine (Dan Aykroyd), 
and Canadian ambassador Blaine de Castillon (Frank Langella). As her fame 
grows, Tina's life starts careening perilously out of control.</P>
<P>The most striking feature of "Stardom" is Arcand's decision to relay his 
story about the medium through the medium: virtually every scene is cast 
in the form of a TV interview or documentary segment or something similar. 
En route, Arcand takes the opportunity to satirise such media stalwarts as 
Oprah Winfrey and Jerry Springer, and other programmes which use 
appearance and formula as a substitute for genuine content. Some of these 
are successful parodies, some less so. For instance, a spoof of MuchMusic 
(Canada's MTV counterpart) is manic and frenzied when programming on the 
real television station is laid back and relaxed; a takeoff on MuchMusic 
is not necessarily unwarranted, but Arcand adopts entirely the wrong 
approach.</P>
<P>Still, this narrative technique works well for a time. It allows us to see 
Tina's development in almost exactly the same way as her fans, with only 
an occasional glimpse behind the curtain. However, as the film wears on, 
the device becomes cumbersome, forcing Arcand to go to more laborious 
lengths to maintain the conceit. In particular, he eventually resorts to 
using scenes from a documentary being made about Tina by an eccentric 
filmmaker (Robert Lepage). In small measures, this would not have seemed 
so awkward, but because Arcand comes to rely on the "documentary" 
increasingly in the latter half of the movie, it begins strain disbelief. 
Its status as nothing more than a storytelling artifice becomes 
transparent.</P>
<P>Similarly, Arcand's entire parody of the fashion and television industries 
starts off fresh, but gradually loses steam as he fails to find much new 
to say. "Stardom" is amusing and intelligent enough, but has little 
insight not already imparted by numerous other treatises on the trade. It 
loses its way as Arcand getting caught up in the absurdities of his 
storyline.</P>
<P>Fortunately, "Stardom" does possess a fine cast to ease the way past its 
rougher segments. Jessica Pare, in her first major film, does a fine job 
as Tina. It might appear at first that Pare has little work to do, given 
that the whole point of her character is that she is a media-molded cipher 
whose personality extends no further than this month's magazine cover. But 
Pare doesn't forget that there is a real person beneath the glitter and 
lipstick, even if Tina's depths are never fully plumbed. One running gag 
is that, whenever Tina tries to offer her own opinions or say something
intelligent, she gets cut off mid-sentence, so instead she eventually 
resorts to speaking only in the sort of meaningless sound bites that too 
many reporters love. But before this happens, Pare effectively 
communicates the frustration -- more accurately, perhaps, the 
disappointment -- Tina feels at not being allowed to be more than just a 
model. It raises the question of how her time in the spotlight would have 
gone had she not been automatically pigeonholed as a mindless camera 
drone.</P>
<P>Also excellent is Dan Aykroyd as Tina's erstwhile paramour, Barry. Barry 
starts the film as every bit as much the media whore as Tina. But once he 
gets sucked into her orbit, his own fifteen minutes of fame quickly begin 
to wear out, until the only thing saving him from obscurity is his 
relationship with Tina. Aykroyd's degeneration from a savvy smooth-talker 
to a desperate, ranting lunatic is "Stardom"'s most fascinating story arc.</P>
<P>But in too many other respects, "Stardom" is just not very satisfying. It 
is not a bad film by any means, and certainly has a lot to recommend it, 
but it sets its sights high and misses the target by a fair margin. 
Ironically, its lack of true substance means that it suffers from the very 
deficiency it seeks to criticise.</P>
