<PRE>                            MURDER IN THE FIRST
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>I was asked by the publicist for MURDER IN THE FIRST to write a book
review based on a copy of the novel by Dan Gordon she gave me a few
weeks ago.  This makes it difficult to now see the film and write a
review of the movie with the book fresh in my mind.  (The book review
is in the following message.)</P>
<P>     For one thing, the book is more exciting than the film.  For a
second thing, why was it necessary to change the fictional names the
author, Gordon, had given the characters?  Does everything have to be
twisted around when making a movie from a book?  Willie Moore (in the
book) sounds better than Henry Young (Kevin Bacon).  Henry Willard
Davidson (Christian Slater), the young lawyer in the book, becomes
Stamphill. Oh, well.</P>
<P>     There have been many books on prisons and prison life but none so
clearly describes the utter authoritarian brutality visited on anyone
when a jailer, Mr. Glenn (Gary Oldman), wishes to punish.  This film is
based on a true story, an attempted escape of Alcatraz and the
subsequent events that made present day Alcatraz a tourist attraction
in San Francisco bay.</P>
<P>     When Warden Humson asked Mr. Glenn why number 532 (the number was
also changed!) was in solitary confinement for three years, the reply
he got was that the records will show that no one has attempted an
escape since Young received his punishment.  "You let those animals
think escape is possible you might as well stick in a revolving door.
Is that what you want, Sir?"</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, the warden decides Young has learned his lesson and
he is released from solitary, half crazed.  Gordon has described the
darkness, in the cave-like one-room, the little peephole in the "door,"
the smell.  Three years.  In the film, it is too dark to see much of
the "dungeon" as solitary was called.</P>
<P>     In all the time Young was holed up, his mind was on learning who
was the snitch who gave away the escape plan.  It was the one thing
that kept him alive.  When, his first day out of the dungeon (as it was
called) and on line in the mess hall, another convict whispers the name
of the snitch. A few moments later, Young gets his revenge and once
more is thrown under Mr. Glenn's authority.</P>
<P>     Gordon details the new punishment Young must now endure.  The
story then switches to the young Public Defender and his efforts to get
a fair trial for Young ... with Young not responding.</P>
<P>     While Gary Oldman and Christian Slater are let loose to give forth
with their histrionics, most of Kevin Bacon's work is in the dark ...
as is most of the film.</P>
