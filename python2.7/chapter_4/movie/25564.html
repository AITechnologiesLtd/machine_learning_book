<PRE>SPACE COWBOYS
A film review by Norm Schrager
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>The good news about Space Cowboys is that Clint Eastwood proves to be a
skilled comedic director.  The bad news is that only the first half of
the movie is a comedy - the second half is a sloppy attempt at a
heart-pounding, Apollo 13ish, mission-gone-haywire space drama that's
vague, oversimplified and unbelievable.  There's a gem of an
entertaining movie somewhere in there, but it's never fully realized.</P>
<P>The plot is solid high concept.  If you did a double-take when you first
heard that John Glenn would return to space, you'll love the basic
premise of Ken Kaufman's and Howard Klausner's script - four daring, old
Air Force codgers weasel their way back into NASA's space shuttle
program to attempt an equipment repair mission that only they know how
to perform.  Our movie visions of strapping, young astronauts (Dennis
Quaid, Bill Paxton, Ben Affleck, to name a few) are smashed once we see
an aging James Garner pull on an airtight suit.</P>
<P>The man behind the idea is Eastwood's Frank Corvin, a brilliant Top Gun
style troublemaker from the 50s who's bitter about his exclusion during
NASA's inception.  Once he pushes his unlikely proposal through the
space program, Corvin travels the South collecting his old flyboy
buddies - Tommy Lee Jones as the hard-headed Hawk, a widower who takes
unsuspecting thrill seekers on wild flights; Donald Sutherland as smooth
ladies' man Jerry, a roller coaster engineer completely unfazed by
negative Gs; and Garner as the humble Tank, an old navigator turned
pastor.  Meeting each of these guys in their natural habitat is a real
comedic treat, as Corvin's first mission of convincing them all to join
is a fun combination of Armageddon and The Blues Brothers.  And these
four actors are seasoned to the point of marinade, so they've got no
trouble digging in and getting the laughs.</P>
<P>When the movie stays light, dealing broad laughs and poking fun at
maturity and ageism, it's easy to suspend disbelief.  At times, when the
movie jumps ahead without much substance, or the characters seem a bit
too cookie-cutter, it's still passable and enjoyable.  But when the
quartet finally jump on the space shuttle, Space Cowboys dive bombs,
becoming just a tepid drama.</P>
<P>>From that point, Eastwood shoots for wide-eyed amazement from the
audience (hell, we've seen space walks since Kubrick did it more than 30
years ago), and all the forgivable weaknesses become glaring.  The
well-timed laughs of the first half become childish, predictable
dialogue.  William Devane, as a funny, wise-ass, gum-smacking flight
director, turns into a cheap imitation of Ed Harris' Apollo 13
character, bellowing lines into space like "Attaboy Frank!"  Cut to
worried, underdeveloped wife character.  Cut back to grimacing, troubled
Eastwood.  Oh boy.</P>
<P>There's no denying, though, that it is a roar seeing these guys get sent
through the ringer at NASA.  And it is refreshing to see a movie who's
youngest lead actor is 54.  But aside from the consistent laughs,
there's a lot missing.  There's a chance to see these men contemplate
the paths of their interesting lives.  There's the opportunity to learn
more about the families behind them.  And there's even more that
could've been done about respect of an older generation, and the fact
that mistakes and lessons can be learned at any age.  Instead, it's all
generally ignored as Space Cowboys opts for an easier, less demanding
path.</P>
<P>The brutal truth is that this movie was over for me once these guys hit
space.  The characters lose their energetic charm and begin to pale. 
The plot becomes wildly unbelievable but asks to be taken seriously. 
The longer the movie progressed, the lower my admiration.  There's a
better Space Cowboys than this two-part, 129-minute version - one where
an entire 90-minute film is just about four funny, respected men
reliving their former glory, blasting off to space in the finale, riding
into the sunset and out of sight.  </P>
