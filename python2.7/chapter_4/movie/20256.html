<P>"From the director who saw 'George of the Jungle,'" touts the ads for 
Universal's live-action remake of the old cartoon, "Dudley Do-Right." At 
least they aren't afraid to admit it, as "Dudley Do-Right," which features 
Brendan Fraser in the title role, is almost a carbon copy of that 1997 hit, 
right up to the jokey narration (by Corey Burton) over many of the scenes. 
While I wasn't one of the supporters of "George of the Jungle," it at least 
felt like a full-length movie, while the 75-minute "Dudley Do-Right" is so 
fast-paced and determined to push on to the next scene that it never stops 
long enough for you to even grow attached to, or involved in, the characters. 
You're obviously supposed to root for Dudley to triumph, but his character 
remains nothing more than a clumsy, accident-prone doofus.</P>
<P>The simple story goes like this: Dudley Do-Right is a Canadian Mountie for a 
quaint town who must stop his nemesis, Snidely Whiplash (Alfred Molina), from 
stealing his main squeeze, the sprightly Nell (Sarah Jessica Parker), and 
turning Semi-Happy Valley into Whiplash City through an elaborate gold hoax. 
To tell the truth, there's not much more to it than that. Through his fight 
to win Nell over and stop the dastardly villain, Snidely, Dudley is always 
falling off of his office chair, stepping on loose floor boards that fly up 
and hit him in the face, and accidentally smashing through windows. His loyal 
horse, named Horse, is always breaking the wind and sticking out his tongue 
at Dudley, and in a goofy dream sequence, played to the song, "Reunited," 
Dudley runs up a large hill to Horse and lovingly hugs him as they 
are--yep--reunited. As I said before, there's not much story to speak of.</P>
<P>"Dudley Do-Right" is an ideal example of a movie that is perfectly cast, but 
otherwise is a wasted opportunity that has forgotten about its story, written 
by Wilson. It even skips right over its trademark plot point, of Nell being 
tied to the railroad tracks by Snidely as a train is coming towards her. 
Since this would be politically incorrect (insert rolling of eyes here), we 
get a similar scene early on with a banker, and an overblown, creatively 
bankrupt climax that features motorcycle and speedboat chases. I don't recall 
speedboats ever appearing prominently in the cartoon, but why question such 
things when most of today's family films show no interest in quality 
entertainment for children (just look at the easily inferior "Inspector 
Gadget"). It is only when parents show contempt for what their children watch 
("Gadget" has made approximately $85-million to date!) that studios, most 
notably Disney, will start making smart live-action family films</P>
<P>As already mentioned, the cast couldn't get any better than this, and the 
three principles are so very right for their roles that it's almost scary. 
Brendan Fraser, I'm afraid, should branch out a little bit more, as I fear he 
is beginning to make the same types of films over and over again, such as 
blockbusters (1999's "The Mummy"), children movies based on cartoons, and 
"fish-out-of-water" comedies (1992's "Encino Man," 1999's "Blast From the 
Past"). My advice for him is to go back to making more challenging work, such 
as 1992's "School Ties" and 1998's "Gods & Monsters," rather than taking on 
roles that are so familiar he could sleepwalk through them. Alfred Molina, 
clearly having a lot of fun, is outstanding as Snidely Whiplash, capturing 
the exact physical look and speech of his animated counterpart. Sarah Jessica 
Parker is appropriately innocent as Nell, but for someone who is 
characterized as being very intelligent, she's fairly stupid, particularly in 
being smitten by Snidely. Finally, Eric Idle gains a few laughs as the bum 
who "discovers" the gold in the town, and ends up appearing on the Regis and 
Kathie Lee talk show.</P>
<P>With a cast so right, how did director Wilson go so wrong? The movie is 
needlessly empty and uneven, and for every good idea (setting the story in 
the present day, even though it is filled with old-fashioned values), there 
are dozens of bad ones. No effort is made to add much originality to the 
proceedings, or give you a strong sense of Dudley or Nell or their budding 
romance. Instead, we get some action chases more appropriate for "Universal 
Soldier: The Return," and the way Dudley overcomes Snidely is ridiculous. For 
one thing, in the cartoon there's no way Dudley would have been able to 
defeat him so easily, because Snidely would always come back for another 
feud. Think of "Dudley Do-Right" as a failed movie not much longer than a 
one-hour television show, and take the kids to see "Tarzan" for the umpteenth 
time.</P>
