<PRE>                              PULSE
               A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>    CAPSULE: The director of CURE brings a weird and very complex 
    concept to the screen.  One viewing will not be enough to 
    understand fully the premise of PULSE.  The idea is something 
    about ghosts and the Internet.  The film has an amazing 
    apocalyptic style.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2 (-4 to +4) </P>
<P>Perhaps the most disturbing (and disturbed?) filmmaker in the 
world is Kiyoshi Kurosawa.  His films all seem to have one style, 
bleak.  The worlds he creates are terrifying and cold.  Little 
known in the US to date, his films deliver the kind of horror that 
so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver.  Most 
of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid.  His 1998 film 
CURE, with one of his niftiest ideas, is just now getting a sadly 
limited release in the US and hopefully enough people will see it 
that his name will soon be one to conjure with.  CURE is probably 
his classic.  Last year he released SEANCE, a remake of SEANCE ON 
A WET AFTERNOON.  That was perhaps a miscalculation inserting 
supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story.  PULSE is 
Kurosawa back on form. </P>
<P>Taguchi, a young computer expert, is late with his delivery of 
some important software.  Two co-workers go to his apartment and 
find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment.  
Taguchi, acting very strangely, lets his friends look for the 
missing software.  Meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain.  
When he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind 
the curtain and discover he has hanged himself.  If that was not 
horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange 
dark mildew-like spot on the wall.  Taguchi's computer seems to 
have been infected with some kind of computer virus.  People whose 
computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide.  
But they are not entirely dead.  Their spirits seem to remain 
present somehow in the real world and on the Internet.  People who 
get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost.  If 
they say yes, they seem to be able to see real time images of the 
spirits still nearby somehow.  The computer shows them impossible 
images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do 
not exist.  This is all somehow connected to heaven and hell 
somehow filling up and overflowing "like a computer disk."  
Instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting 
computer viruses.  There is some sort of passage between worlds 
having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange 
electronic disturbances on computers.  Leave it to Kurosawa to 
find a new kind of death. </P>
<P>This is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than 
LIFEFORCE and somehow Kurosawa makes the film all work.  It may 
not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to 
death, but whatever it does convey is nightmarish.  Kurosawa, who 
directs his own screenplay, ties his story into the real world 
with some familiar and accurate computer discussion.  Frequently 
the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be 
fact.  His plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very 
strange. </P>
<P>Junichiro Hayashi, the cinematographer who recently has been doing 
all of Kurosawa's films, creates a dark, cold, and gloomy tone.  
Images are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic 
curtain.  Scenes are not milked for their horror the way American 
exploitation films might.  People are shot with guns but there is 
little if any blood in evidence.  Seeing black silhouettes on 
computer screens is not immediately scary.  Kurosawa is not going 
for and easy visual shock, but a deeper metaphysical dread. </P>
<P>Of any horror filmmaker in the world, Kiyoshi Kurosawa is the one 
to watch.  I rate this metaphysical look at isolation a 7 on the 0 
to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale. </P>
