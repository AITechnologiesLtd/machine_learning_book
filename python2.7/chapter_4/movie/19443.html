<PRE>                            EYES WIDE SHUT
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: What starts as an exploration of
          sexual mores takes a turn for the bizarre, then
          becomes a paranoia suspense thriller with an
          unexpected nod to 18th century European history.
          This film is probably not as erotic as people might
          be expecting, nor is it a deep self-contemplative
          piece, but it still is a surprisingly rewarding
          film.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low +2 (-4 to +4).
          SPOILER WARNING: Following the review (and a
          spoiler warning) I have a historical note relevant
          to the plot of this film.</PRE>
<P>     The way to become rich in the American entertainment industry is
to give the public what it wants.  Evidently what the public wants is
to see Nicole Kidman nude.  Last season Broadway offered NICOLE KIDMAN
NUDE: THE PLAY, officially titled THE BLUE ROOM.  The draw of this play
was apparently from all the publicity that one got with the price of a
ticket a quick look at Nicole Kidman starkers.  And free with the look
you got a reputedly mediocre play about sexual mores.</P>
<P>     But most of the country could not get to Broadway to see this
theatrical indelicacy.  Now no less a filmmaker than the late Stanley
Kubrick brings to the screen NICOLE KIDMAN NUDE: THE MOTION PICTURE,
officially titles EYES WIDE SHUT. The film is not based on THE BLUE
ROOM--it just happens to be another story about sexual mores.  Kubrick
himself is no stranger to the act of bringing heavenly bodies to the
motion picture screen.  But I do not remember another film that has so
titillated the audience into wanting to see the body of a major
character since GODZILLA.  And in fact, Kidman does show off her body
so frequently and so gratuitously in the early part of this film we can
only conclude that she has decided she likes doing it.  The irony is
that her character's nudity and even her sexuality is only tangential
to the main line of the plot.  Most of the scenes of nudity, the first
one being a good 60 seconds into the film, are added totally
gratuitously.</P>
<P>     As the film opens successful young physician William Harford (Tom
Cruise) and his wife Alice (his wife Kidman), a stylish and wealthy New
York couple, are preparing to go out for the evening.  They are going
to a Christmas party at the palatial home of the well-connected Victor
Ziegler (Sydney Pollack).  When they get to the party both Harfords
find themselves being seduced by other guests. William is set upon by
two young models, Alice by a somewhat older Hungarian Lothario (Sky
Dumont) who quotes Oscar Wilde as if the wit was his own.  The Harfords
each resist, but the tension later causes a rift in their marriage that
has them each questioning their relationship.  But that disagreement is
only the background for the central action, a bizarre chain of
incidents sparked by a chance meeting at the party.</P>
<P>     That evening the Harfords have a sort of sophomoric argument on
sexuality that does little more than show that both William and Alice
are each in their own ways naive about sex.  Kubrick allows the
argument, and much that follows it, to go on way too long.  With 2001:
A SPACE ODYSSEY Kubrick started pacing his film more slowly.  Going
counter to the trend of films moving faster, Kubrick has made the
pacing of his films more deliberate and occasionally more textured.  In
this pacing some points get really belabored.  A few of his sequences
seem to go on much too long and his storytelling is characterized by
foot-dragging.</P>
<P>     EYES WIDE SHUT is not in all ways a well-directed film in spite of
the Kubrick name.  Cruise's acting style seems limited to facial
expression.  There is little emotional impact in his performance.
Kidman goes through a wider emotional range more believably, but still
there is nothing impressive done here.  Ironically Spartacus and
Varinia in SPARTACUS make a more compelling couple than William and
Alice played by an actual husband and wife in EYES WIDE SHUT.  Stanley
Kubrick's final film surprises the viewer with an engaging thriller
plot involving a sinister forces having their roots in history.  There
are some surprising problems with the film but it is not without its
moments of delight.  I rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     Spoiler... Spoiler... Spoiler... Spoiler...</P>
<P>     The society that we see portrayed in this film is almost certainly
based on one that did exist, though the original probably died out in
the middle 18th century.  The original is popularly called the Hellfire
Club (though members called themselves "The Monks of Medmenham") and it
was for a time an important force in European, and particularly
British, politics.  Like the society that Kubrick shows us here it was
a secret society; even most members may not have known who the other
members were.  The secret society combined satanic mysticism--either
real or feigned, probably some of both--and orgies.</P>
<P>     The founder and leader of the secret society was Sir Francis
Dashwood, an influential Member of Parliament and eventually Chancellor
of the Exchequer.  It is not known with any sureness who else was a
"monk."  One person who it is strongly rumored was a member or perhaps
only an honorary member but a repeated guest was Benjamin Franklin.
The Earl of Sandwich was certainly also a member. (As an aside, if his
name sounds a little funny the latter was not surprisingly also an avid
gambler.  His unwillingness to leave the gaming table to eat caused him
to invent a food concoction more portable than a plate of food.  He
would grasp a piece of meat in the hand between two slices of bread.
And that's the origin of the "sandwich" and of its name.)</P>
<P>     Other members of the Hellfire Club included painter William
Hogarth and politician John Wilkes.  The club met and had their orgies
and their strange ceremonies at Medmenham Abbey.  Meeting at the chapel
of the abbey and at the West Wycombe caves near the Dashwood estate,
the club held strange ceremonies and orgies very much like the ones we
saw in the film.  For more information, read
