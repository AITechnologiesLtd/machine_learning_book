<PRE>                                A TIME TO KILL
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Strongly reminiscent of "To Kill A Mockingbird", this is an incongruent
combination of riveting performances, a controversial topic, compelling
tear-jerking, one dimensional characters and overly simplistic political
statements. The film is based on John Grisman's first novel, and feels
much like the rest of his books turned films ("The Firm", "Pelican
Brief", "The Client").</P>
<P>A young black girl is brutally raped, beaten and left for dead by two
southern rednecks. Arrested and lead through the courthouse, they are
gunned down by the girl's father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson)
who has learned they would probably be released in less than 10 years
because she is black and they are white.  The remainder of the
two-and-a-half hour film features his trial and the question of whether
a black man can get a fair trial in Mississippi with an all-white jury.
Hailey's white lawyer Jake Brigance is played by Matthew McConaughey,
Hollywood's latest instant star and the focus of the film. In a twist,
this particular golden boy's hype is justified and he is one of the high
points of the movie. Aided by his alcoholic mentor (Donald Sutherland),
sleazy buddy (Oliver Platt) and sexy plucky northern legal aide (Sandra
Bullock); Brigance sets out to find a way out of what looks like a
no-win situation.</P>
<P>The film addresses heavy questions concerning racism in a bizarre mix of
some very human situations and a few cartoonish scenes. Jackson gives a
great performance in his talks with McConaughey concerning his view of
black and white relations. Contrast this with the caricature of the
self-serving NAACP representatives and the cinematic short-cut of white
racism as evidenced by the KKK, both of which are peopled by cardboard
characters.</P>
<P>The acting and casting are also a mixed bag. Jackson and McConaughey are
notable in their roles. Bullock, a personal unfavorite, turns in one of
her better performances (faint praise indeed), but for a strong female
role, she is sure dressed as if she=B9s fulfilling the babe role. It=B9s
entertaining to see Donald Sutherland on one side and son Keifer on the
other, but they are both one-note characters. Sutherland The Younger is
a KKK member in yet another of his (surprise!) psycho roles.</P>
<P>Platt has a fascinating screen presence and could have contributed much
to the film, but is casted in a throwaway role. There are far too many
characters who clutter up the story and could have been dropped from the
movie without affecting the story at all.</P>
<P>The strong acting makes up for the film's flaws, but leaves you
wondering how it would have worked if the rest of the elements had
measured up.</P>
