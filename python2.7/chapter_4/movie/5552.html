<PRE>PC Review of Hunchback and Gypsies</PRE>
<PRE>The What Of Notre Dame?</PRE>
<P>With a title like Hunchback, it looks like Disney really dropped the 
political correctness ball on this one. Heck, even the townspeople call 
him the "bell ringer". Maybe they should just call him "appearance 
challenged. At least they'll be having Americans saying "No - Tra Dom", 
instead of pronouncing it like the football team. </P>
<P>When multiculturalism is supposed to be about exposing minority children 
to people who look just like themselves, why take them to Paris? What do 
inner city children need to know about a minor religious landmark that 
only rich white and Japanese vacationers will ever live to see? But the 
dark-skinned Gypsies show that even Europe has diversity. In this 
country, we don't have much of a Gypsy "problem", yet when the American 
Jewish Committee did a poll of the best liked and worst hated ethnic 
groups, the people on the bottom weren't black, or Jewish, they were the 
Gypsies. You've got to wonder what these guys did to get such a 
reputation even in this country. One problem is that the Gypsies aren't 
Catholic, or even Judeo-Christian. They believe in fortune telling and 
magic, which draws complaints from some Christians today every time 
Halloween rolls around.</P>
<P>We hear about great African Americans every Black History Month. But the 
best Isabel Fonseca's book "Bury Me Standing" can come up with about the 
Gypsies is that while not all of them are habitual transients, liars, 
and criminals, a lot of them were and still are. She compares them to 
the Jews, but nobody ever accused the Gypsies of being over-achievers. 
The New York Times profiled a Gypsy murder suspect whose mother said 
"Gypsies don't keep regular jobs, but at least they don't kill people", 
and said that the Gypsies make a career of living apart from the 
civilized mainstream. </P>
<P>Maybe Disney thought they were just simplifying things, but by making 
Clopin the King of the Gypsies, they made all of the Gypsies into the 
beggars and thieves, instead of the poor Frenchmen in the original 
story. We all avoid the "N" word, but don't even realize that to use the 
word `gyp' as a verb implies all Gypsies are cheats. Even that term is 
misleading because they really came from India, not Egypt (which would 
actually make them Asian) These days, many would prefer to be called the 
"Romani". </P>
<P>Interestingly, the Seattle may be the only school district in the nation 
that breaks out the Gypsies as a disadvantaged group. Well, they might 
have problems elsewhere, but the Seattle data book shows that the 
Gypsies score just as well or better than other white children in test 
scores and grades, and no worse in dropouts or suspensions. When the 
Bell-Curve school says that groups at the bottom are genetically 
destined to stay there, this may prove that at least this white group 
can assimilate into the norm.</P>
<P>In this updated story, Quasimoto's gargoyle friends still sing in "A Guy 
Like You" that his looks are one of a kind. But where the early movies 
were placed in the horror category, Disney's Quasi is just a boy in a 
tower with a big song and dance number. Like the Little Mermaid, 
Quasimoto wants to go "out there" and mix up with the other people. </P>
<P>He's practically a prisoner in the care of the evil Judge Frollo long 
before the days of child protective services. Talk about your one-parent 
Disney families. Esmerelda is the latest Disney heroine who wouldn't 
look out of place on the cover of Cosmo. If NOW complained about 
Pocahontas's looks, this working girl makes a living making guy's eyes 
pop out. </P>
<P>Pheobus is the blond he-man who eventually switches teams and joins up 
with the geek to save the girl. It's Phoebus that gets packaged with the 
girl in the Mattell 2 figure gift pack, not title character. The 
creators said that Quasimoto has "puppy" love for Esmerelda, and Phoebus 
has real love. But Spike Lee's "Jungle fever" would probably put the 
outcasts together. Disney made a reasonably happy ending, but in the 
1939 version, Phoebus gets killed halfway through, Quasimoto flings 
Frodo out of the tower, Esmerelda gets tortured, Clopin gets hit in a 
friendly fire incident, and Gringoire, the wimpy poet who got dropped 
entirely by Disney gets the girl. Boy they don't make them like they 
used to.</P>
<P>Two years from now, Disney is slated to give us a legend set in China. 
That is, if we can get over human rights issues, pirated Michael Jackson 
CD's, and see if they hire enough Asian Americans in the cast.</P>
<P>Net pointers - check out the disney site www.disney.com for promotional 
background. The real gem is hidden under the Disney publishing section, 
they are putting up the full pictures from the children's book that 
pretty much gives a condensed plot.</P>
<P>ps, I'm picking up extra burger king toys and I have some
sets of the Skybox cards that were givven out at the
travelling exhibitions with all the characters if anybody
needs them. I'll be putting up the toys on my home page soon.</P>
