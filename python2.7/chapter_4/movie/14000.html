<PRE>Starring:        Christina Ricci
                Martin Donovan
                Lisa Kudrow
                Lyle Lovett</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>It is usually difficult for child stars to prove that they can play
grown-up roles.  There is no doubt that Christina Ricci has made the
transition.  She is a wonderful slut!</P>
<P>How times have changed.  There was a day when young girls prepared for a
date by pinching their cheeks to give them a touch of blush.  Christina
pinches her nipples!</P>
<P>Without a doubt, Christina doesn't care for anyone but herself, but she
makes every male think that he is special to her allowing her to "use"
them in various ways.  </P>
<P>When her stepfather dies, the sixteen year-old Christina leaves home to
live with her half-brother [Martin Donovan] whose gay lover has recently
died, leaving him financially independent.  Christina manages to seduce
his new lover, and then convinces him that he is the father of her
expected child.   </P>
<P>Lisa Kudrow, as the sister of the dead lover, does not like Christina,
and makes no attempt to hide her feelings.  In a very unglamorous role,
she turns in an excellent portrayal of a woman with   deep feelings, who
needs to be loved.  Luckily for her, Lyle Lovett comes along.  But as a
local sheriff, he's there for other reasons as well.</P>
<P>This is a memorable movie.  It does a good job of portraying the world of
a gay man in today's society.  It'll make you laugh as well as cry.   
This is definitely not a movie for everyone, but if you like it...you'll
love it.  I give it a firm B.</P>
<P>I'd watch it again on TV, but some of the scenes will probably be cut out.</P>
<PRE>See you at the movies.</PRE>
