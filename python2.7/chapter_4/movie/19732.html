<PRE>Lawrence of Arabia (1962)</PRE>
<P>What strikes me most about watching Lawrence of Arabia again is its length 
-well over three hours.  Yes, I think director David Lean could have edited 
out a good deal of footage and still had an epic.  On the other hand, I 
admire the pace Lean uses to build momentum;  and certainly momentum - of 
narrative if not of action - is a large part of what gives the film its epic 
impact.</P>
<P>The Arabian desert fascinates the viewer with its natural shadows and hidden 
but sure danger.  Lean's five-month shoot is legendary, with cleverness and 
endurance pitted against hardships mustered by nature.  Outside of The 
English Patient, I have not seen such an interesting use of the desert in 
any film.  This awesome land formation should be credited up there with the 
main players.</P>
<P>The acting is marvelous, too, the casting a series of strokes of brilliance. 
  In his first film, Peter O'Toole proves that the choice of a young and 
quirky style was the best choice.  This man has the eyes of a silent film 
star, large and expressive, outlined to an almost feminine degree.  O'Toole 
inhabits the character thoroughly; I cannot imagine another actor so intense 
in his changes of mood and ironies of ego.</P>
<P>As well, Omar Sharif is outstanding as Sherif Ali ibn el Karish.  A young, 
dark and handsome threat at first, his character grows nearly as dynamic as 
Lawrence's in its alteration by story's end.  How to match Sharif's 
magnetism was addressed by casting Anthony Quinn, that multi-ethnic utility 
man, as a rival tribal chief, Auda abu Tayi.  Quinn truly matches each iota 
of Sharif's anger and passion.  Auda embodies a great Bedouin's jingoism.</P>
<P>How to ensure a solid backup cast?  Let's face it, political intrigue is 
usually a sure way to comment on the ironies of human nature, and Jack 
Hawkins as General Allenby, and Claude Rains as Mr. Dryden - the 
plainclothes, behind-the-scenes manipulator - were about the best thing 
going in the field of character acting.  Further, Alec Guiness, the lead 
actor in Lean's The Bridge on the River Kwai, is subtly masterful as Prince 
Feisal.  The way the world is portrayed as both cruel and beautiful results 
mainly from the dimension of the script added by strong supporting roles.</P>
<P>Robert Bolt's screenplay is both spare and poetic.  It's like the best 
writing by Raymond Carver - laconic but not minimalistic, honest but not 
prideful.  Bolt surely relied on the strength lent by the desert, where 
one's actions are magnified as if by a brightly-lighted stage.  He also 
makes the political strife fairly understandable:  the desert tribes need 
unification if they are to be a threat to the Turks, who have included them 
for some time in an extensive empire.  As it is a World War, the British 
have it in their own interest to see the Turks defeated, as Turkey is allied 
with Germany.  What throws off British imperialism is the quasi-rebellion of 
one of their own - T. E. Lawrence, the officer who takes it upon himself to 
bring together a large faction of these desert peoples.  After he assists in 
the liberation of Damascus, he tries to ensure the area stays under Arab 
control:  not a popular path at a time Great Britain was still expanding its 
own empire.</P>
<P>Maurice Jarre's music is a masterpiece in its own right.  The main theme and 
its variations reach throughout the entire narrative, accompanying the major 
characters on their exploits and adding dramatic undercurrent to many 
confrontations.  It's truly music fit for an epic.</P>
<P>Watch for a cameo that has David Lean on a motorcycle asking the resonant 
question of identity, "Who are you?" as Lawrence and a young companion 
appear after crossing yet another desert.</P>
<P>It's been ten years since Robert A. Harris restored the old and rotting 70 
mm film he found in dented and rusting cans.  Had he left it there, perhaps 
we would not have such a bright and crisp version to enjoy today.  This film 
is a must-see for a number of reasons.  Yes, it's way up there on the 
American Film Institute's Top 100 List, but more importantly, it's a glimpse 
of vanished filmmaking, a real epic and a valuable piece of history in the 
areas of film and world politics.</P>
