<P>     You know, I used to think that firefighting, a former occupation of
mine, was the perfect job for a problem solver.  That was before meeting
Mike Roark, director of Los Angeles' Office of Emergency Management.  As
played by Tommy Lee Jones, this guy has one *heck* of a problem on the
city's hands:  orange stuff is spewing from the La Brea Tar Pits and
oozing it's way down Wilshire.  Palm trees are aflame, fire trucks are
melting, and these nasty little things called lava bombs (what, you
didn't see DANTE'S PEAK?) are ruining everybody else's day.  Oh, what to
do, what to do?</P>
<P>     Now, since Mr. R. is a Hollywood construct, he's also a single dad,
who's supposedly on vacation with his surly daughter, and both of whom
just happen to be riding by The Pits when they erupt.  (You can decide
if the story has more fuzzy logic or convenient coincidences.) His part-
ner in grime is a plucky geologist ("get me a scientist!" he hilariously
barks and is handed Anne Heche), who tried to warn him, yesterday, that
something in the rock might be ready to roll.  (Had he heeded her warn-
ing, we wouldn't have a movie.  Or, for that matter, the once-in-a-
lifetime chance to see Ms. Heche wearing a silver, heat-reflecting
suit.)</P>
<P>     In a perfect world of guy movies, VOLCANO would be all about how to
divert the lava, extinguish the fires, triage the casualties, and save
the city.  Director Mick Jackson (L.A. STORY), obviously bored by such
linear thinking, has more on his mind.  He's included a hokey moral
message (black and white is gray, when covered with ash), some classic
camp (how else to explain yet another dog barking at lava?), and plenty
of homage to the city that, admit it, you're happy to see burn.  (My
favorite bit:  a Metro employee reading a book on writing screenplays 
that sell.)  All of this-- in-jokes, action sequences, cornball drama, 
and spectacular special effects-- is compressed into an exhilaratingly
exhausting 105 minutes.  If you don't shut down from sensory overload,
you should be entertained.</P>
