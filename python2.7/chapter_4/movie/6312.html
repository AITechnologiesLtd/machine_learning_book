<PRE>                             ROMEO AND JULIET
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     It was just 60 years ago that I saw my first ROMEO AND JULIET,
and loved it even though (or perhaps because) the leads were played by
Leslie Howard and Norma Shearer who were, respectively, age 39 and 36.
But what did a kid know?  They were two of my favorite actors and
I adored the film.  The music was by Tschaikowsky and that did not
hurt one bit.   I recall that when Romeo spent the  first night with
Juliet, the camera panned up over the balcony, into the sky and over
the trees and when it came down to earth it was morning.  How
beautiful it was!  How this teenager ate that up!</P>
<P>     Somewhere around 1958 I saw the Russian filmed ballet version
with Ulanova and with the great music of Serge Prokofiev and I went
wild about the film and especially the music.  Since then I have seen
the ballet (Bolshoi) a dozen times and nothing can surpass the ballet
version.</P>
<P>     In 1968, there was Zeffirelli's wonderful production starring the
15-year -old Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting who was a mere 17,
which was more in keeping with the original play by Shakespeare.  And
now we are approaching the millennia with Baz Luhrmann's
interpretation of that great work.</P>
<P>Four hundred years ago, Shakespeare wrote:</P>
<PRE>               "Two households, both alike in dignity,
               in fair Verona (where we lay our scene)
                From ancient grudge break new mutiny.
             Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
             From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
           A pair of star-crossed lovers take their lives."</PRE>
<P>     The current version opens with a TV broadcast by an anchorwoman
(Edwina Moore) reporting a shoot-out between two rival gangs, the
Montagues and the Capulets in Verona, Florida.  The TV camera takes us
to
the scene where the gang members are firing revolvers at each other. 
Among them is Tybalt (John Leguizamo), a Capulet and Mercutio (Harold
Perrineau) a Montague  who is Romeo's best friend.</P>
<P>     My first reaction to this scene was "This movie is going to
bomb!"  I felt a small revulsion at the desecration of a great writer.
But shortly, thereafter, I was caught up in the film, with the nice
touch that the characters spoke Shakespearean English.   The
appearance of Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio. whom I correctly chose to be
nominated for  Best Supporting Actor in WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE?
and that of Juliet (Claire Dane, who won an Emmy nomination in MY
SO-CALLED LIFE, and followed that with LITTLE WOMEN, HOW TO MAKE AN
AMERICAN QUILT and TO GILLIAN ON HER 37TH BIRTHDAY) moved the film
into another dimension).  Both DiCaprio and the very innocent-looking
Dane gave the film  a feeling of young love at first sight.  There
could not have been better casting.</P>
<P>     A couple of quick complaints.    Was it really necessary to make
Mercutio into a cross-dresser?  Was it really necessary to have Juliet
blow her brains out with a revolver . . . or was that supposed to be
in keeping with the modern crazy world of guns?  I would have much
preferred had she finished the deadly potion Romeo had just taken.</P>
<P>     Anyone upset that I have committed "a spoiler" by revealing that
both Romeo and Juliet die?   You have to be kidding, right?</P>
<P>     Other notables in the cast are Pete Postlethwaite (as Father
Laurence) who absolutely knocked me out as the tragic father in that
wonderful film, IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER as well as his appearances
in many other fine films . . . and Brian Dennehy as Ted Montague as
the head of the Montague clan and Paul Servino as Fulgencio Capulet,
the patriarch of the Capulet clan, Diane Venora as his wife Gloria
Capulet.   Paul Rudd is Paris, Juliet's suitor; and let us not forget
Juliet's nursemaid, played by that fine British actress, Miriam
Margolyes, who here has a Spanish accent.</P>
<PRE>     All in all, an exciting, spectacular film . . . and certainly
original.</PRE>
<PRE>                      Directed by Baz Luhrmann.</PRE>
