<PRE>The 6th Day (2000)
Review by Steve Kong

<P>Let me first say that The 6th Day is better than Arnie's last film End of 
Days.  But, that's not saying too much since End of Days was so 
terrible.  We are entering in to the era of neo-Arnie  a softer and gentler 
Arnie who makes movies that are no longer rated R, but are rated 
PG-13.  The 6th Day has one huge failing and is rescued by one great 
idea.  More on this later.</P>
<P>In The 6th Day we follow the life of ordinary guy Adam Gibson (Arnold 
Schwarzenegger).  He's a helicopter pilot with a pretty ordinary life with 
a wife, daughter, and even a cute dog.  On his birthday he decides to 
switch off a job with his work partner Hank.  Hank is killed during the job 
and Adam comes home to find someone who looks interestingly just like 
him  this person is living in his house, acting like him, playing with his 
child, and even having sex with his wife.  Well, in any other movie a 
mind-over-anger approach would have taken place.  But, come on!  This is an 
Arnie film and all hell breaks loose, as there are two Arnies on screen.</P>
<P>In the near future  and we're told the not so far away future by the 
opening titles  cloning of pets has been perfected and though humans have 
been cloned, it is outlawed.  The master-cloning doctor is a brilliant man 
named Dr. Weir (Robert Duvall) and he has a scheming business partner named 
Drucker (Tony Goldwyn).  Well, like in real life, laws are made to be 
broken and Adam has been cloned and now that there are two of them in the 
world, one of them has to be eliminated to eliminate the evidence of 
illegal cloning.</P>
<P>The story for The 6th Day is not deep, this is an action film, but the 
issues brought up in the film are great!  The cloning process basically 
reproduces an exact clone of a person within two hours.  What does this 
mean really?  It means that a person can live forever.  A snapshot of a 
person's mind at a moment of time (called a "syncording") and a sample of 
the person's DNA is all that is needed to create a perfect clone.  This 
clone doesn't even know that he is a clone.  The issue of cloning is quite 
real in today's world and the film does bring up some of these interesting 
issues.  It is because of this that the film survives, it is able to infuse 
enough action to please the audience and also put in something for the 
audience to think about after the film.</P>
<P>Where the film fails, but not failing hard enough for me to not like the 
film, is in its tone and setting.  See, the opening titles try to scare us 
by saying that what we are going to see is the near future.  But, it goes 
on specifically to let us know that this is not too far away from now.  And 
if the film had stuck to this then it would have been a brilliant 
film  what I mean is if the film had put the characters in a world that is 
not far different than our world right now, it would have helped put the 
audience closer to what is happening on screen and what is at the core of 
the film, the question of cloning.  What director Roger Spottiswoode 
("Tomorrow Never Dies") does though is tell us one thing and then show us 
another  he puts us in a world where helicopters can transform into jet 
planes, where instead of ammo firing guns there are laser guns, and 
holographic displays for football games.  With these things he's just put 
us not in the near future, but way "out there".  And but doing that the 
points and issues brought up by the film do not him home well enough.  Also 
the suspension of disbelief is now greater since we now have to believe 
that cloning technology is perfected to the point where a human can be 
cloned in two hours plus that there are helicopters that can turn into jet 
planes and that there are laser guns.  I think Spottiswoode seriously 
dropped the ball here.  He should have said that it was in the not so 
distant future then set it up just like that, it would have made the film's 
depiction of the cloning much more frightening.</P>
<P>Lets not forget though that this is an action film and there is action in 
the film.  Like Spottiswoode previous action film Tomorrow Never Dies, the 
action is pretty flat in this film.  Spottiswoode does not know how to do 
action well.  The action is flat and at times yawn inducing.  A car chase 
is shot early on in the film and that was a dud.  The laser gun fights 
were, well, laser gun fights that looked as exciting as some cutting room 
floor stuff from the original Star Wars film.  It's enough action to carry 
the film along, but it sure isn't exciting enough to carry the film by 
itself  thank goodness for the good core ideas about cloning.</P>
<P>The actors seem to do what they can with the film.  Arnie is Arnie.  This 
isn't one of his best performances.  It also isn't one of his worst.  He is 
serviceable and likeable on screen.  I wish Arnie would return to the 
classic style Arnie and make movies like T2, Total Recall, or even 
something like Predator.  Neo-Arnie is a little too soft for my 
tastes.  Worth mentioning is actress Sara Wynter as Talia.  Talia is one of 
the agents working for Drucker's corporation trying to eliminate 
Adam.  Wynter is does pretty well with her part and it was always 
entertaining to see her on screen.</P>
<P>The 6th Day is an average movie that eludes my recommendation for a big 
screen showing at full price.  But, if you see it at a cheap matinee or on 
video it will be a decent flick to see.  The ideas brought up about cloning 
are good conversation items and it is nice to see Arnie back on the screen 
doing something better than that hellacious (pun intended) End of Days.</P>
