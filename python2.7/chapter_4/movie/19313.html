TEN BENNY (director: Eric Bross; cast: Adrien Brody (Ray), Michael
Gallagher (Mike), Tony Gillan (Butchie), of time  Temchen (Joanne), Lisa
Roberts (Linda), James E. Moriarty (Donny), Frank Vincent (Ray Sr.),
1997)</P>
<P>This independent film written and directed by Eric Bross has the look
and feel of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have
inundated the market in recent times. It is hard to tell what is
independent about this film; it might as well have been made in
Hollywood or on a home videocam. It is the debut film for the director,
who tells his personal story about Italians growing up with heavy New
Jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into
young adults, a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the
1950s, where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded,
but to see it in the 1990s is a different story: it is old news. The
love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her
luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn't mean much, since their
relationship remained undeveloped. The introduction of the wise-guy
angle and the loyality among buddies bit, are not moving enough
emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this
film above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance
by the star of the film, Adrien Brody as Ray.</P>
<P>Ray is the only son of a low-level mobster once arrested for running an
illegal casino operation out of his Bloomfield, New Jersey, suburban
basement. Ray Sr. (Vincent) is now trying to make a go of it by running
a small scale home-repair business. His son lives with him and works
unhappily as a shoe salesman, dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can
open a business and marry his long-time waitress girlfriend Joanne
(Sybil).</P>
<P>The title of this film refers to the shoe size of Paul Newman-10B, which
really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film.You
should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that
don't make sense: its constant brainless chatter between the buddies,
their uneventful growing pains, and the despair of their lives, make it
very difficult to feel any empathy for them.</P>
<P>Desperate to make his dream come through, Ray goes to a loanshark,
humorously and menacingly played by James E. Moriarty, and borrows 10
grand to bet on a "sure thing" at Freehold Raceway. The horse loses and
now Ray has big problems, as the loanshark comes after him with his
muscle to get his dough.</P>
<P>There is nothing I have seen so far to like about Ray. He is
undependable, mean-spirited, and stupid. So when his best friend Mike
(Gallagher), the narrator of the film, gets a chance to sleep with his
girlfriend--who cares? The director must be kidding himself if he thinks
we do.</P>
<P>As for Ray's gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off, the
story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect
to happen. His buddies, the college student Mike and the dependable
Butchie (Gillan), and his old man, who he has this love/hate
relationship with, rally to his aid. And the film ends on an obligatory
artistic note of ambiguity, that seems to be the way it is for all those
wannabe artistic films, as Ray is off to Florida all by his lonesome
self to try to put his life together.</P>
<P>There was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this
superficial film to keep it interesting, though Adrien Brody showed
signs that he could be a future star. Because of his intensity and
looks, he reminds me of Sean Penn.</P>
