<PRE>                            THE FIRST WIVES CLUB
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I was a minority for the opening night rush hour showing 
of THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. Affirmative action on the part of most 
middle aged mothers couldn't get most teenage guys into the theater, 
but I allowed myself to be dragged along to see this one because the 
only other movie opening was the Bruce Willis western LAST MAN 
STANDING and I didn't want to be the first or last man standing in 
line for that.</P>
<P>        THE FIRST WIVES CLUB, as expected, abounds in 
feminine mid-life crisis humor. If movies were paired off, THE 
FIRST WIVES CLUB would be married to CITY SLICKERS, its 
masculine counterpart. Both have an abundance of laugh-out-loud 
lines and physical comedy, although the female version isn't quite 
on par with the 1991 Billy Crystal classic. Beneath the comedy, 
CITY SLICKERS had a poignant seriousness about friendship 
and aging that THE FIRST WIVES CLUB tries harder to achieve 
but never quite does.</P>
<P>        Still, the teamup of Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn and Diane 
Keaton makes for an amazing comic partnership. Even though the 
combined age on those three has to be over 150, they're still in top 
form. Midler is the spurned Jewish woman whose rich husband 
(Dan Hedaya) has left her for Sarah Jessica Parker. Hawn is the 
washed-out actress who relies on cosmetic surgery -- particularly 
collagen injections that leave her looking like Lips Manlis from 
DICK TRACY -- to stay young. Keaton's character is the neurotic 
type who spends most of her time on her therapist's couch, trying 
to stay optimistic about her failing marriage. Her contribution to 
the movie seems like ANNIE HALL: TWENTY YEARS LATER, an 
inevitable comparison since her character's name actually is 
Annie.</P>
<P>        The three were inseparable friends in college, but have 
proven separable in the almost thirty years since. They reunite at 
the funeral of a fourth friend who committed suicide after being 
dumped by her husband for a younger woman and, after a drunken 
lunch of several hours, realize they're all three in the same boat. 
Midler's got Sarah Jessica to contend with, Hawn's movie producer 
husband is currently with Elizabeth "Jessie Spano" Berkeley and 
Keaton soon finds out her husband is getting it on with the 
therapist.</P>
<P>        Having this much in common, they decide to form an 
informal organization to help each other out. Remembering the 
title of the movie, they name it THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. What 
follows is a series of juvenile pranks and blackmail scams on the 
bastard husbands, including the most memorable scene of the 
movie, in which the three of them break into Hedaya's penthouse 
and must make a hasty exit in the window washer's cart when he 
and Parker return.</P>
<P>        The movie itself is predictable, juvenile and all that, but 
I liked it anyway and so did the predominantly fortysomething 
audience I saw it with, including my mom, who was lobbying for 
a four-star rating. I recognized enough flaws to not be completely 
enthralled in the movie, and I certainly couldn't identify with being 
dumped for a younger woman (give me a few years on that), but 
when something is as funny as THE FIRST WIVES CLUB is, I can 
overlook the brief but forced drama and contrived sitcom 
recycling.</P>
