<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>There are some movies which, on a purely aesthetic level, you know you 
shouldn't really enjoy, but which are blessed with such charm that you do 
anyway. "Where The Heart Is" is this kind of movie. Its storyline lacks 
creativity and is sometimes hard to swallow, its dialogue is for the most 
part only serviceable, its direction is fair but undistinguished. But its 
characterisation is fun and unusual, and the performances of its cast -- 
especially stars Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd -- are so endearing that 
it's hard not to leave the theatre with a grin on your face.</P>
<P>Novalee Nation (Portman) is a pregnant teenager who leaves her Oklahoma 
home to head to California with boyfriend and would-be country music star 
Willy Jack (Dylan Bruno). On the way, they stop at a Wal-Mart so that 
Novalee can use the washroom. She returns to the parking lot only to find 
that Willy Jack has abandoned her. Alone, penniless, and well into her 
third trimester, Novalee hides out in the Wal-Mart until her baby is 
born. In the meantime, she meets some of the locals, including a 
recovering alcoholic named Sister Husband (Stockard Channing) and Forney, 
the eccentric librarian (James Frain).</P>
<P>Finally, in an unexpectedly stark scene, Novalee gives birth. In the 
hospital, she befriends nurse Lexie Coop (Judd) who is also an unmarried 
mother, though in her case her brood numbers four (all named after candy 
bars). Acting on a suggestion to give her daughter a strong, meaningful 
name, Novalee calls her Americus. (You'll notice the movie's penchant for 
bizarre phenomenology; and I haven't mentioned other characters like 
Moses Whitecotten or Mr Sprock!)</P>
<P>The rest of "Where The Heart Is" tells the story of Novalee and her new 
friends as she comes to find her place in the world. Covering five years, 
the film alternates between good, solid character development and an 
unfortunate tendency to substitute incident for real characterisation. 
Some sequences are genuine and amusing, like the formative stages of 
Novalee's burgeoning career as a photographer, or her keeping accounting 
of every little thing she has borrowed from the Wal-Mart she makes her 
temporary home. But others are obvious and clumsy plot devices. One 
unlikely scene, for example, sees Novalee nearly being swept into a 
tornado, clinging to a slowly disintegrating staircase and trying to save 
Americus at the same time. (I kept expecting Helen Hunt or Bill Paxton to 
show up, myself.)</P>
<P>As a result, "Where The Heart Is" has a somewhat disjointed, episodic 
feel to it. To be fair, I do wonder if this may be partly a consequence 
of trying to condense Billie Letts' novel down to a two-hour screenplay. 
But in the end, I wished the movie had spent less time on glaring set 
pieces and played more often to its strength, which is the often unusual, 
sometimes unexpected, but always very human incidents which color our 
days. "Your life can change in a breath," Novalee tells Lexie at one 
point. But those changes are rarely major show pieces, and sometimes 
"Where The Heart Is" seems to forget that.</P>
<P>It is somewhat astonishing to realise that "Where The Heart Is" is 
Natalie Portman's first leading role. Less surprising, however, is that 
she handles the extra duties with typical aplomb, despite the fact that 
Novalee may be one of her more difficult assignments. Many of Portman's 
characters in the past have been preternaturally intelligent or mature: 
Queen Amidala in "The Phantom Menace", Ann August in "Anywhere But Here" 
and Marty in "Beautiful Girls" all spring to mind. Novalee, on the other 
hand, is a character who has not had the opportunity to cultivate her 
intelligence, nor who innately possesses considerable maturity. 
Consequently, she represents a different sort of challenge for Portman, 
who has to let Novalee slowly develop these characteristics over the 
course of the movie. In successfully doing so, Portman demonstrates once
again why she is one of Hollywood's most talented actresses. (Portman has 
reportedly decided against doing any more movies other than the next two 
"Star Wars" instalments until her undergraduate education is complete. 
With doubt, Hollywood's loss is academia's gain.)</P>
<P>Also superb is Ashley Judd as Lexie. It would have been easy to make  
Lexie just a slightly older version of Novalee, but Judd carves her own 
niche, bringing to the proceedings an infectious enthusiasm which belies 
her deeply troubled character. Lexie is the unlucky sort of woman who is 
always looking for Mr Right but only manages to find Mr Wrong. The end 
result is four kids (and more as the movie proceeds). Judd conveys the 
difficulty of her life while still maintaining a believable, indeed 
admirable, positive outlook. This makes Lexie particularly endearing, and 
the rollercoaster she endures as the film unfolds truly involving.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is also very good. Frain finds just the right note as 
Novalee's friend and would-be lover, neither under- nor over-indulging in 
his character's idiosyncrasies. Despite limited screen time, Bruno brings 
Willy Jack to life, wisely portraying him as immature and misguided 
rather than out-and-out rotten. Indeed, I found myself at times wishing 
Willy Jack's story had earned a little more of the spotlight; it would 
make a fascinating movie in its own right. Similarly underutilised is 
Joan Cusack as Willy Jack's tough-as-nails agent Ruth Meyers. Indeed, the 
only disappointing performance is from Channing, whose Sister Husband is
surprisingly bland and uninteresting.</P>
<P>Although it is certainly a flawed movie, I nonetheless find myself 
recommending "Where The Heart Is". It's not often a movie can succeed so 
totally on the basis of its characters, but that is the case here. Many 
will find the film's unlikely elements off-putting, and I am 
hard-pressed to disagree. But this is the kind of movie that is best 
watched with your brain in the "off" position. Its target is the 
audience's heart, and in this respect it hits a bulls-eye.</P>
