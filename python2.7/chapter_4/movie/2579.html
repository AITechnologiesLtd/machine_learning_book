                   THIRTY-TWO SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD        
                        A Film Review by Scott Renshaw 
                         Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw </PRE>
<PRE>Starring:  Colm Feore.
Screenplay:  Francois Girard and Don McKellar. 
Director:  Francois Girard.</PRE>
<P>     What I know about classical music, I could explain to you in
ten minutes.  I had never heard of Glenn Gould before I heard of this 
film.  It is possible that with greater background knowledge, I might 
have appreciated THIRTY-TWO FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD more... although I 
can't imagine how.  GLENN GOULD is a thoroughly remarkable film 
experience, as confident as it is ambitious, as masterfully realized as 
it is skillfully constructed.  It is difficult for me to conceive of a 
biography which more vividly conveys its subject, in all his complexity, 
and it is easy for me to state that it is the best film I have seen in 
1994.</P>
<P>     THIRTY-TWO SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD is exactly what its
title would suggest:  a series of vignettes examining in various ways the 
life and music of Glenn Gould, the acclaimed and enigmatic Canadian 
classical pianist who died in 1982 at the age of 50.  Gould caused a 
sensation with his unique interpretations of Bach, Schoenberg and others, 
and even more of a sensation when he retired from live performance at the 
age of 32.  Among the thirty-two films (the number taken from Bach's 
Goldberg Variations) are dramatizations of events from the life of Gould 
(Colm Feore), as well as interviews with friends, family and professional 
associates. There are also abstract interpretations of Gould's work as a 
performer and as a composer.</P>
<P>     While each of the thirty-two individually titled segments in
GLENN GOULD is self-contained, it is the manner in which they are 
connected which makes the film so compelling.  "Lake Simcoe," a fairly 
straightforward narrated look at Gould's childhood, leads into our first 
look at Gould the man in "Forty-five Seconds and a Chair."  We only just 
have time to register reaction to Gould before an acquaintance describes 
_his_ first meeting with Gould, and how he turned out to be quite a 
different person from what his appearance might suggest.  Later, Gould 
picks up snatches of conversation while dining in "Truck Stop," then uses 
that experience as an inspiration for his unique radio production "The 
Idea of North."  Despite the changes in perspective and varying film 
techniques, GLENN GOULD never seems fragmented; it maintains an 
unmistakable flow which is rarely anything but gripping.</P>
<P>     It helps that Francois Girard has chosen such a fascinating
subject, but it is Girard's brilliant direction which makes GOULD, the 
movie and the man, come alive.  Girard never tries to pin Gould down, the 
way a conventional biography might; rather, he uses his singular format 
to allow the complicated and multi-faceted Gould emerge slowly.  Although 
he gives up life performance to go into virtual seclusion, he so longs 
for contact that he spends hours each day talking to people on the 
telephone; in fact, the segment "Solitude" might in many ways be 
considered the centerpiece of the film.  Suffering throughout his life 
from high blood pressure and other chronic circulatory problems, Gould 
becomes a virtual slave to his medical conditions, highlighted in "Pills" 
and "Diary of One Day."  And while the dramatized sequences tend to 
present a man of almost other-worldly talent and insight, the inclusion 
of the interviews with real acquaintances of Gould's gives him a 
fundamental humanity.</P>
<P>     There is the occasional misstep.  A few of the sequences seem
repetitive, particularly "Practice" and "Passion According to Gould," 
both of which show Gould's rapture in response to his own music; and "The 
Tip," while amusing, seems somewhat out of place.  I was also less than 
enthralled by the lengthy animated segment "Gould Meets McLaren," and 
"Variation in C Minor," another FANTASIA-like visual representation of 
music.  When the music was separated from the man, I grew impatient.  
THIRTY-TWO SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD introduced me to a fragile, 
uniquely humanistic genius I wanted to know more about, and in a way I 
doubt I'll ever forget.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Goldberg Variations:  9.
