<P> Near the beginning of "At First Sight" there's a scene guaranteed to
make almost every female viewer very, very jealous of Mira Sorvino, who
plays Amy Benic, a worn-out yet still somewhat glamorous New York
architect who's come to a mountain spa for a bit of rest. And what
better treatment to start with than a full-body massage from the magic
fingers of Virgil Adams, who is played by -- breathe deeply, ladies --
Val Kilmer?
 Minutes after he touches her, Amy is so relaxed, she bursts into tears.
"Oh no," Virgil apologizes. "Did I go too deep?".
 Like Virgil, the slickly produced "At First Sight" tends to shy away
from depth as well. Sad, since there's certainly the potential for a
fascinating picture here as Virgil, blind since early childhood, is
persuaded by Amy to participate in an experimental surgery program that
may restore his vision. The movie's most intriguing stretch begins
immediately after the operation, as Virgil struggles to reintrepret his
world visually, instead of through his other senses.
 But after paying lip service to the challenges of adjusting to being
able to see again, the Steve Levitt screenplay backpedals into the safer
ground of conventional romance, as long-suffering Amy does her best to
be patient while Virgil rants about how "seeing sucks." Though derived
from a true story chronicled by Dr. Oliver Sacks in his 1996 book "An
Anthropologist On Mars," "Sight" always seems closer to soap opera than
case study.
 All the usual suspects are brought in, including Virgil's
overprotective scold of a sister (Kelly McGillis), the hand-wringing
research scientist (Bruce Davidson) and Amy's cynical ex-husband (Steven
Weber), who's certain she'll come back to him on the rebound. The most
enjoyable of these walking cliches, a smart-mouthed therapist played by
Nathan Lane, ends up getting short shrift after a promising build-up.
 As for Kilmer and Sorvino, suffice to say the sparks don't exactly fly
between them. Speaking in a slowed-down, slightly thick voice, Kilmer
gives a performance that seems technically accurate but strangely
chilly, while the generally bubbly Sorvino seems to be trying to channel
the spirit of Justine Bateman here; she's all goofy looks, curled lips
and "ohmigod" flutteriness.
 Though the movie is not particularly insightful as either a medical
drama or a love story, director Irwin Winkler knows how to make a pretty
picture, and "Sight" even works in a couple of creative touches, such as
a distorted, disorienting double-exposure technique used to express
Virgil's first visions of the people around him. The soundtrack,
featuring two scintillating new songs from jazz pianist Diana Krall and
a host of standards, is also highly agreeable, even though the sluggish
plot it accompanies could inspire most viewers to close their eyes for a
long winter's nap. James Sanford</P>
