<P>_My_Favorite_Martian_ (PG) no stars (out of ****)</P>
<P>Grab a thesaurus.  Look up the word "bad."  See those words listed?  There
you have my review of the absolutely atrocious screen version of the 1960s
TV sitcom.  The Martian in question (Christopher Lloyd) becomes the
"favorite" of TV news producer Tim O'Hara, who reluctantly allows the alien
(who passes himself off as Tim's "Uncle Martin") and his living, talking
space suit to live with him as they repair their damaged spaceship.
Certainly some suspension of disbelief is in order, but there was one thing
that kept on bugging me while watching this film: just where exactly was
the Martian heading if he didn't want to land on earth?  It makes no sense.</P>
<P>Not that sense should be the priority of director Donald Petrie and
writers Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver--their main concern should be
laughs.  But there are none to be had in this tedious turkey, which uses a
lot of admittedly diverting (but not diverting _enough_) effects work in a
futile attempt to hide the 
clunkiness of the script and, worst of all, the performances.  Lloyd is
insufferably obnoxious and smug; Daniels is a complete blank; Daryl Hannah
(as Daniels's devoted camera operator) is even worse.  But as bad as they
are, they don't come close to the abysmal, forced work of Elizabeth Hurley.
 She's a born straightwoman, yet she's called on to actually _be_ funny as
bitchy reporter Brace Channing--and she has no clue _how_, showing no sense
of comic timing whatsoever.  It's not a pretty sight---a statement that can
be applied to the entire waste of celluloid that is _My_Favorite_Martian_.</P>
