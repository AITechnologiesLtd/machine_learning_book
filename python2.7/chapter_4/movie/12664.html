<P>Ice Storm, The (1997)
<A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Ice+Storm,+The+">http://us.imdb.com/Title?Ice+Storm,+The+</A>(1997)</P>
<P>Rating: 9 out of 10 (alternate scale: ****1/2)</P>
<P>_The Ice Storm_ is perhaps the first movie ever to have taken a long,
probing look at the Sexual Revolution of the 1970s, and then decided to
unwaveringly condemn it for what it was: an infantile exercise in sexual
adventure that ultimately destroyed families. It might strike some as
ironic (or distasteful) that it took a foreign director, the masterful
Ang Lee, to expose America's Nixon-era social shortcomings, but he does
it with the evenhanded objectivity that only a spectator of the game
could hope to enjoy, creating in the process a truly remarkable piece of
filmmaking.</P>
<P>In the opening scene, as the sun comes up over an ice-beaten
Connecticut railway line, we are led to believe that this will be a
story about the blows that family members deal one another without even
knowing, or meaning it. Instead, the focus here is on pain: profound,
all-encompassing pain. In this bleak Connecticut autumn, everyone is a
victim, and the victimisation is as deliberate and inescapable as it is
pervasive. There are no pointed fingers, no convenient scapegoats. There
is no one without sin here, and no one whose sins go unpunished. Far
from engaging in the naive outrage of the day at a corrupt system
spinning out of control, the film takes a detached historical
perspective of events, resigned to a tacit approval of those horrors of
modern society which constitute its characters' greatest fears. This
film reminds all of us that we have stopped wincing at our
convictionless environment. It has become normal.</P>
<P>The inept, halfhearted extramarital misadventures of the affluent
Silent Generation parents of New Canaan, Connecticut eerily mirror the
hesitant sexual explorations of their children. These wizened,
politically conscious children look on in disbelief as their ignorant
and self-absorbed parents spiral into oblivion. The traditional familial
roles of parent and child have been reversed; not in order to conform to
some clever poetic device, but because that is what actually went on in
the American households of the early seventies. The inference is clear:
something is rotten in the state Connecticut.</P>
<P>The entire cast functions perfectly together, a large and
incomprehensibly complex machine that brings to fruition the film's
desolate theme. Kevin Kline drives his character, the disconsolate
adulterer Benjamin Hood, with boundless, naked talent. He stares,
dead-eyed, out the window of his concrete tower high above New York; he
carries his daughter in his arms through the forest, determined,
intense; drunk, at a party, he sits, sullen and withdrawn, but never,
ever idle. Benjamin Hood is a selfish man, but he takes no pleasure from
life; indeed, nor do any of the characters: they all smile, at one point
or another, but these are but temporary glimpses of what a happy life
could be like, and in the face of all that is going wrong, these moments
do not last long. The chill, wet air, `the molecules,' as Mikey Carver
(played with touching innocence by Elijah Wood) says, seem to cast a
palpable pall over everyone and everything in New Canaan. Joan Allen's
finely-wrought, intelligent portrayal of Benjamin's wife, Elena, fuming
impotently at the wrongs done her, provides the perfect compliment to
Kline's character. Christina Ricci turns in what is certainly the most
flawless and fully-realised performance of her young career, as the
Hoods' inquisitive and opinionated daughter, Wendy. This girl is a
complete, believable person whose anguish spills out onto the screen in
great torrents.</P>
<P>_The Ice Storm_ is a film that had to be made. It provides no easy
answers to its characters' problems; it solves nothing. But perhaps it
stands as a warning against allowing the social and psychological
mismanagement of an entire generation of North American children to ever
again occur.</P>
