<P>Hilary and Jackie is a moving and poignant tale of the love between two
sisters.  Emily Watson and Australian Rachel Griffiths portray Hilary
and Jacqueline du Pré with stunning precision, in two of the best female
performances you're likely to see this year.  It would be easy to say
that Watson and Griffiths are the reason why this drama works so well,
but that would be without crediting the screenplay that was adapted from
the true story "A Genius in the Family" (written by Hilary and Piers du
Pré).  The script is solidly directed by Anand Tucker, who is obviously
interested in the way music is conceived and manipulated - and,
eventually, the way music leads to one woman's dissatisfaction with
life.</P>
<P>Jacqueline "Jackie" du Pré (Watson) is a cellist prodigy.  As young
girls, Jackie and her sister Hilary (Griffiths) - a flutist - would win
countless junior tournaments, and there was a vaguely unhealthy
competitive spirit between them.  As adults, they have chosen very
different lifestyles: Hilary has given up the flute to a simple life of
marriage and family, whereas Jackie is a wildly successful cellist who
tours all over the world.  Jackie finds out the hard way that sometimes
the simplest values are the best, and as she continues her constant
search for happiness, she hinders the happiness of those who love her.</P>
<P>Jackie is a complicated character, and it is often hard to know what
leads her to commit purely selfish actions.  Feeling lonely, Jackie
tells Hilary she wants to have sex with her husband.  "She just needs to
feel loved," Hilary explains to him, with more than a hint of doubt in
her voice.  Jackie's plights through stardom and self-destruction (the
two come hand in hand, it seems) are believable thanks to Watson, who
knows how to make a dramatic part work.   Rachel Griffiths also shines -
perhaps even a little more so - in a subtler performance, which is an
impressive mix of happiness amongst gentle but profound sorrow.</P>
<P>For the first thirty or so minutes of Hilary and Jackie, I was
completely captivated.  The performances from young girls Auriol Evans
and Keeley Flanders are incredible - their parts demand a mature
approach that is rare with kids this age.  After the film's lengthy
prologue finishes, Hilary and Jackie is divided into two main parts, one
for each sister.   This enables the story to be told from two
perspectives, although conveying the narrative in this way doesn't
always work.  Hilary's story, although less spectacular, I found much
more interesting, so its frustrating when she is absent from the screen
during long slabs of time.  Sometimes the narrative is also
unnecessarily confusing and, call me fussy, but the film's final reel is
silly - I'm not quite sure what Tucker was trying to tell us with it.</P>
<P>Still, Hilary and Jackie is an involving drama.  The classical music
soars, the cinematography is lush - it is a pleasing experience.  But
more than that, this is a film that is charged by emotion and a central
relationship built on love and devotion (although that's not always
immediately evident).  Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths play off each
other beautifully, and are gracefully, powerfully the two best reasons
to see Hilary and Jackie.</P>
