<P>     Love, passion, and Irish Catholicism collide in THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN,
writer/director Edward Burns' feature debut.  This is one of the better
independent romantic comedies to come along in a while.  Although it
generally stays true to the cliches and plot turns of the genre, THE
BROTHERS MCMULLEN is smart and honest rather than manipulative.  Instead of
resorting to hard-to-swallow story complications, this film stays on-target
from its opening moments.  Along the way, the empty dialogue too often
incipient in this sort of picture is replaced by intelligent, insightful
conversations.</P>
<P>     One of THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN's top assets is the brothers themselves.
Despite their flaws (and each has a reasonably obvious one), Patrick (Mike
McGlone), Jack (Jack Mulcahy), and Barry (Edward Burns) are likeable guys.
They drink beer together, reminisce none-too-fondly about their dead father,
and discuss topics ranging from true love to whether there's a hell.</P>
<P>     Patrick, the youngest, has just graduated from college and is getting
cold feet about the prospect of spending the rest of his life with his
Jewish girlfriend, Susan (Shari Albert).  He thinks he loves her, but he's
not *in love* with her, and he yearns for something more romantic.  On top
of that, Patrick is saddled with the usual Catholic guilt inherent in a
relationship -- especially one that involves pre-marital sex -- with a
non-Catholic.  But is this a genuine concern, or just an excuse to avoid
commitment?</P>
<P>     Jack, the oldest, is happily married to Molly (Connie Britton), the
love of his life.  But, as her maternal instincts assert themselves, Jack's
eye begins to roam.  Waiting to seduce him is Ann (Elizabeth P.  McKay), a
woman who's interested only in sex, not a relationship, and has decided that
the best way to get what she wants is to become involved with a married man.</P>
<P>     Barry, the middle brother, is the most cynical of the three.  ("Being a
pessimist," he says, "makes it easier to deal with my inevitable failure.")
A screenwriter on the verge of a big breakthrough, Barry goes from
relationship to relationship without ever finding love.  For him, marriage
is out of the question, and whenever a woman mentions the possibility of
something long-term, Barry is out the door.  Then he meets Audrey (Maxine
Bahns), and suddenly nothing is quite so clear-cut.</P>
<P>     If this film was only about the three men and their relationships, it
would be enjoyable, but not particularly noteworthy.  However, Burns has
given his characters a slew of interesting things to say, and he hasn't
reduced the women to pawns in male-centered romantic fantasies.  In fact, in
THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN, the female halves of the relationships are often
smarter and hipper than their male counterparts.  When one of the brothers
thinks he's putting something over on his wife/girlfriend/lover, he's more
likely just fooling himself.</P>
<P>     In many closely-knit Irish American communities, as in many Italian
American communities, Catholicism is more of a culture than a religion, and
THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN explores the differences between accepting Catholic
doctrine as a way of life and simply calling oneself "Catholic."  Of the
brothers, only Patrick is especially religious, and he's a perfect example
of the adage "You can't be Catholic and have a healthy sex life."  Barry and
Jack accept their heritage, but, if they even believe in God, they don't
show it.  Yet even Barry is concerned about dating a non-Catholic woman.</P>
<P>     Despite its occasional forays into weighty matters, THE BROTHERS
MCMULLEN largely stays on the light side, where all good romantic comedies
reside.  The tone is upbeat and the script is laced with wit and, upon
occasion, there are moments guaranteed to cause deeper, louder laughter.
Barry's comparison of relationships to peeling and slicing a banana is the
movie's comic highlight.  Above all, THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN is undeniably
charming, and that's the best reason to spend ninety-seven minutes with
these men.  You don't have to be Catholic, or Irish, or even American, to
"get it."  Burns' language, despite originating on Long Island, is universal
in appeal and meaning.</P>
