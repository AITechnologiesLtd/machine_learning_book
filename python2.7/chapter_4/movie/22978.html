<P>Miramax "disinvited" on-line media from press screenings of Scream 3.
They ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled
reviews and post them prior to the film's February 4th release
date-unsound reasoning. You see, 'net critics established enough to be
on any sort of VIP list are professionals-Miramax surely knows the
difference between a member of The On-Line Film Critics Society (OFCS)
and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at Ain't It Cool News. No,
the ‘mini major' was afraid we'd let a bigger cat out of the bag than
whodunit, that Scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved (by this
writer, at least) franchise.</P>
<P>Something smells rotten in the state of California right from the
get-go: Cotton Weary (Liev Schrieber), the former lover and would-be
killer of Maureen Prescott, Sidney's mother, is juggling phone calls in
his luxury car. (Once considered a danger to society, Weary now hosts
his own talk show, "100% Cotton", a clever, if dated, jab at American
pop culture.) Of course, a new Ghostface dials him up, and, with
memories of Scream's unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind, we
immediately wonder, Where is the killer? The backseat? The next car?
Thrilling prospects, to be sure, but actually, Ghostface is at the Weary
residence, waiting for Cotton's girlfriend (Kelly Rutheford) to
finishing showering. What's missing from this sequence, and indeed
Scream 3's remaining frights (most disappointingly, the moment when an
ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with Ghostface
costumes, one of which might spring to life), is an elaborate and
attenuated payoff.</P>
<P>Our other surviving regulars have become estranged. Sidney (Campbell) is
living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected
locks, while Dewey (Arquette) acts as technical advisor on the second
sequel to Scream 2's movie-within-a-movie, "Stab 3", and Gale Weathers
(Cox Arquette) headlines a gossipy news program. Murder reunites them,
as knife-wielding Ghostface stalks the set of "Stab 3", imitating its
sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with
Sidney's death.</P>
<P>The appeal of Ghostface's villainy is that he/she/they could be your
boyfriend, your classmate, your next door neighbour...or a combination
of people. Scream was the first of its kind: a slasher mystery, with the
guessing game not only entailing who will be next, but also who is/are
the perpetrator(s) and what is/are his/her/their motive. Ironic
self-reflection aside, parts one and two stand out in a crowd that
includes umpteen Friday the 13th and Halloween flicks because there's at
last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume. With Scream 3,
the novelty of Ghostface's ever-mutating identity has worn off some, but
the character remains conceptually potent.</P>
<P>Conceptually. The execution of Ghostface's master plan this time around
is creaky, because screenwriter Ehren Kruger has invented a new
mythology for the world of Sidney Prescott far afield from what we'd
come to understand in Scream and Scream 2. The movie gets in the silly
habit of saying "All bets are off!" in reference to the "rules" of a
trilogy's third act, but there's a difference between rule breaking and
cheating. With the departure of Kevin Williamson, who authored the
previous Screams as well as a tidy outline for Scream 3 (that, for
reasons incomprehensible to me, was ignored, save the notion of "Stab
3"), Kruger needed to be reined in tighter, and by Wes Craven.</P>
<P>Craven's direction of Scream 3 is lazy in most respects. How else to
explain the Jay and Silent Bob cameo (the slacker duo of Kevin Smith
movies), akin to seeing Mickey Mouse pop up in Mulan and more
distracting than funny. It pains me to write this, but Scream 3's comedy
is generally laughless, with the exception of well-timed performances by
Josh Pais (as a police detective possessed of the same personality he
had as a persnickety teacher in Craven's Music of the Heart), Jamie
Kennedy (resurrecting film geek Randy for the sendoff he was denied in
Scream 2), and Parker Posey (through sheer force of will as a
B-actress).</P>
<P>The visuals are much weaker in part three, as well-the occasional
sweeping gesture of Peter Deming's camera is a pale imitation of the
stalking Steadicam Craven gave us twice before. (Aside: in the wake of
Columbine, Craven toned down the violence significantly for Scream 3-why
the sanctimony, when  Scream and Scream 2 are still readily available on
video store shelves?) Finally, Marco Beltrami's music cues the suspense
too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station
in Scream 2? It's mostly silent. Sting notes are a whole lot more
effective if they spring from nowhere; here, they act as the crescendos
of an incessantly nerve-jangling score.</P>
<P>I look at Scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe, the same
place that birthed The Godfather Part III and Superman III-woefully out
of synch with its prequels, Scream 3 is a nightmare instead of
nightmarish, and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs. The
film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a T:
‘part three must disappoint'.</P>
