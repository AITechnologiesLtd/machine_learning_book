<P>   When I was a kid, the first time I heard the juke box in the
local coffee house, some song or other of Frank Sinatra's
was on.  Sinatra sounded happy, so I told my mom to ask the
owner to unlock the back of the machine so that I could see
the guy who sounded so good.  The owner smiled as though
he heard the request a hundred times before, and opened the
back of the unit.  I looked in and was depressed for days. 
Despite the shattering of my illusions, when I saw my first
movie--I think it starred either Lassie or Rin Tin Tin, can't
recall--I was sure that the characters were acting out their
little story behind the big white screen--didn't you?  I never
did get to look there but had to take my dad's word that I
would only get depressed once again.</P>
<P>   So there...those experiences were not for nought because
as I watched the charming Chinese movie (which won their
equivalent of the Oscar for best picture), "Shadow Magic," I
could appreciate the fascination that the people of that Asian
nation felt in 1902 when they heard a phonograph for the first
time, the year the events of the story took place.   And when
I watched the absolutely astounded faces on these
simultaneously bemused and amused folks in the makeshift
theater in what was then called Peking, my mind wandered
back to those happy days of my childhood when everything in
the world was new, fresh, exciting.</P>
<P>   "Shadow Magic" is the creation of Ann Hu, who was
allowed to leave mainland China after the so-called Cultural
Revolution, came to the U.S. in 1979 for her Business
Administration degree from NYU, was a success trading
commodities and used the capital she acquired to finance
films.  (She is currently working on "Red Guards," a doc
about the Cultural Revolution with interviews never before
seen in the West.)</P>
<P>   "Shadow Magic" takes as its implicit theme the idea that
while East is East and West is West, the twain can
sometimes meet--if the players in the human drama have
enough patience to work out particular differences in their
traditions.  The movie is beautifully photographed,
emphasizing a rich array of costumes, courtesy of the well-
stocked Beijing Film Studio.  The story deals with several
conflicts: the traditions of the East vs. the technology of the
West; the clash between believers of arranged marriages and
those who prefer to choose their own life's partners; the
competition between individuals whose prestige and income
come from years of pleasing their audience and others whose
prestige and income depend on the success of new forms of
diversion.  The romantic tension is intriguing; the partnership
between a bright and therefore erratic worker and a
disappointed British expatriate promotes hope in today's
troubled times.</P>
<P>   The central character, Liu (Xia Yu), works for a
photographer's studio under the proprietorship of Master Ren
(Liu Peiqi), but has no rigid regard for the state of current
technology.  Always experimenting, particularly with gadgets
created in the West, he draws the contempt of some around
him while playing a Caruso record on a Victrola. "Not refined
like our own music," sniffs Lord Tan (Li Yusheng), who has a
large following for his brilliantly-costumed performances in
Chinese opera but who is evidently threatened by all new
technology.  Liu, concerned about criticism but not ready to
give up his tinkering, has a thing for Tan's attractive
daughter, Ling (Xing Yufei), but Liu's dad wants him to hitch
up with a rich widow--who looks like the usual older-woman
butt of Gilbert and Sullivan's satires.  When the unhappily
divorced Raymond Wallace (Jared Harris) arrives in Peking
hoping to make it big financially with his motion picture
projector (which no one in China had ever seen before)--
presuming a large audience would pay to see his shadow
magic on the screen of a makeshift movie house--he and Liu
hit it off, form a partnership, and fight the Luddites who want
to kick them both out of their lives.</P>
<P>   While the two entrepreneurs struggle to attract an audience
propagandized against purported Western cultural
imperialism, they effect changes on each other.  Wallace
nudges his Asian pal to go for it, to make a big play for the
woman of his dreams and to shuck off the old ways years
before a revolution against the Manchu Dynasty would free
him and millions of others from pigtails and bound feet.  For
his part, Liu makes a human being out of a westerner whose
failed marriage has made him hard and cynical and
sometimes inebriated.</P>
<P>   The most amusing scene during the two hours of stunning
cinematography--which embraces a most enjoyable history
lesson--occurs when a fairly large group of Chinese witness
their first film, a silent, of course, given riotous dimensions
when two of the stand-up comedians who have been
photographed by Liu and Wallace get up from their seats in
the audience and fill in the dialogue that they had pursued
while before the lens.  I like the way Wallace seduced the
attention of the would-be actors by telling one of them that
one hundred years from now, he would appear before an
audience (in 2002) without having aged a day although he
would be 170 years old.  Now, why couldn't he have seduced
Lord Tan in a similar way, but saying that the movies would
expose his operative talents to the whole nation if not the
world?</P>
<P>   The pace is brisk, the acting convincing, and here's one
movie written by five scripters that doesn't look as though it
were written by a committee.  When Wallace looks at the
Great Wall (which can be seen and walked, I believe, just 20
miles outside Beijing) and tells the folks that they don't need
to keep invaders out but should be welcoming new ideas in,
you can't help thinking of the nut cases of the world today
like the Taliban who are threatened by big stone statues that
are alien to their belief.  All in all, a thrilling experience, a
history lesson for those who don't like history as well as
those who are intrigued by the past.</P>
