<P>   After you see a romantic comedy like "How Stella Got Her
Groove Back"--an overlong, predictable, commercialized take
on the game of romance--you'll have your faith restored with
Brad Anderson's indie gem, "Next Stop, Wonderland." 
Despite its clunky title, this movie has an alternately dreamy,
melancholy, happy and comic ambiance boasting fresh
writing, sensitive direction, and a lead performance by Hope
Davis which reflects the Brazilian term saudade--an
oxymoronic expression meaning sadness and happiness at
the same time.  Ms. Davis is known chiefly to patrons of indie
films which show up at the Sundance Festival, having
garnered enthusiastic responses in movies like "Daytrippers"
and "The Myth of Fingerprints," and is known to Broadway
aficionados for a starring role in Chekhov's "Ivanov."</P>
<P>   Erin Castleton (Hope Davis) is one of the most interesting
young women we've come across in recent months because
she is anything but a one-sided character.  In fact she is a
hodgepodge of opposites.  Though she has no problem being
alone, she feels lonely in crowds, and while she would like to
have a boy friend, she is not the type actively to seek one. 
Though she is melancholy, displaying a broad smile only once
in the entire narrative, she claims to be basically happy.  She
has had the good--and bad--luck to have adored her recently
departed father and will not settle for a young man who does
not embrace her dad's poetic qualities.  The fun begins when
her mother secretly places a personals ad in the local Boston
paper describing Erin as "vivacious and carefree," itself a bold
prevarication because this terminology describes not the
daughter but her mother, Piper Castleton (Holland Taylor), a
smart, bourgeois, fast-talking modeling agent whose
temperament is quite the converse of her daughter's.</P>
<P>  Brad Anderson, who directs and co-wrote the feature
following his less accessible "The Darien Gap, sets up a
series of comical situations of the sort that the dating game
naturally evokes, and in the funniest scene lays out a collage
of suitors for Erin's affections who are virtually all wimps,
jerks, and flat-out liars. A threesome of yuppies call the young
woman and take bets among themselves for who will be the
first to French-kiss her. They plan, in turn, to make
themselves inconspicuous in the bar which she has chosen to
meet her candidates.  Anderson sweeps through a quick take
on the fibbers who don't make it past the telephone
conversation including one who, seated in the john, claims to
operate his own business and, as he reaches for the toilet
paper, asks her to hold on because "a fax is coming through." 
"I'm a temp but that's not a permanent thing," admits a
flustered suitor, while yet another, taken aback that she's
anything but carefree and vivacious, learns that her mother
put in the ad and inquires, "What's your mother's number?"</P>
<P>   The more she tries, the more she fails to meet Mr. Right. 
In one scene she discusses with her fellow nurses whether
love comes along by the Large Hand of Fate or whether it is
a random occurrence.  Director Anderson deliberately does
not take sides but instead lays out a parallel story of an
earnest 35-year-old man, Alan (Alan Gelfant) who is a
plumber but is going to college to become a marine biologist. 
Deep in debt and pressured by a loan shark to steal a
valuable fish from the city's aquarium, Alan gives no thought
to finding a mate, but after repeatedly coming close to
meeting Erin is literally thrown into her arms.</P>
<P>   Erin is surely not an ideal woman.  She does not possess
classic beauty, her expression is deadpan throughout, and is
capable of coming up with some on-the-money put-downs of
aggressive men.  She captures our interest and concern
simply because she cannot be pigeonholed like the bimbo,
Julie (Cara Buono), a gum-chewer who repeatedly throws
herself on the bemused Alan.  </P>
<P>    Alan Gelfant is a model college student, the sort who has
taken many years off to work at a well-paying job but chooses
in mid-life to quit, go to school, and pursue a career he loves.
The only man who comes close to his quality is Andre De
Silva (Jose Zuniga), an ultra-romantic Brazilian who is
returning home to Sao Paolo and, on a whim, invites Erin to
join him.  She is entranced by the poetry of his words, which
reflect the Bossa Nova sountrack permeating this delightful
film.</P>
