Rated R: Violence and brutality</P>
<P>by Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>    Spielberg's Amistad begins with a spellbinding scene. On board the
Spanish slave ship Amistad, an African slave named Cinque (Djimon
Hounsou) escapes and frees all of his brothers, leading a violent mutiny
against the overseers on the ship. The opening shot is dark, and it
takes a few seconds to understand what we're looking at--the shot
changes from a close-up of a pair of straining eyes down to raw, bloody
fingers removing a nail from a piece of wood. The man pulls the nail out
after what we expect was an extremely long time, and looks at it in
wonder for only a second before standing to help his fellow captives.
The ensuing moments are violent and horrifying, as Cinque and the
others, enraged, murder the ship's crew.</P>
<P>    The slaves keep two of the seamen alive to navigate the ship; these
two men take the ship to America (the slaves thought they were going
home to Africa) and the entire group of slaves is arrested for murder.
Much of the film involves the trial, in which a young activist lawyer
(Matthew McConaughey) defends the group. Later in the film, he enlists
the help of John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins).</P>
<P>    Amistad is the latest Important film this fall. The hype on this one
is intense, mostly because audiences are expecting a film with similar
impact of Schindler's List. Amistad, arguably in the same technical
realm as Schindler's List, never reaches the emotional level of the
latter. Of course, to base my criticism on a comparison between the two
is unfair: it is unlikely Spielberg intended to make something that
would be as powerful as Schindler's List. Amistad's subject matter is
one to which most individuals in this time period have very little
exposure, and is immediately limited because of this. Spielberg,
however, has done a spectacular job of recreating the values of the time
period and educating viewers as to what went on in the mid 1800s. His
work is so successful in this respect that I was truly moved by the end
of this film.</P>
<P>    As a whole, however, the film's progression and the script don't
quite live up to Spielberg's potential. My biggest problem is with the
length. Many of the scenes went for far too long; towards the end of the
film, Hopkins gives a speech to the US Supreme Court. The speech lasts
roughly 15 minutes, but it seems to go on forever. Hopkins' delivery is
nice, and the speech is well-written, but it meanders, and despite its
meaning, I was tempted to tune it out. Many of the scenes have this
quality, where the development isn't always apparent and the point of
each scene isn't totally obvious.
Scenes between McConaughey and Hounsou, which should be magical and
energetic, often come across as dull and obligatory. The performances
are all very good, but the characters don't feel like they're
interacting with one another--it seems like they're always talking to
the audience, almost knowing of the fact that they're in a film meant to
teach us something.</P>
<P>    Morgan Freeman, who is top-billed for some strange reason, is mostly
wasted in this role as anti-slavery activist Theodore Joadson. He has
almost no lines, and is given basically no time to create a character.
The prize of this film is newcomer Hounsou, who is charismatic and
powerful as the leader of the slaves. McConaughey is also good (and I
found it ironic that he actually toned down his Southern accent for this
role), and Hopkins gives an authentic portrayal of Adams (and he
maintains a better accent than he did in Nixon). Pete Posthelwaite,
another British actor covering up his accent, delivers a cold and
balanced performance as the prosecuting lawyer Holabird.</P>
<P>    Although Amistad has some significant problems with pacing and
character interaction, the mood is perfect. The experience wasn't always
engaging, but the parts that worked really worked. The best scene in the
film is a flashback to a horrible moment during which a group of slaves
are tied to a bundle of rocks and thrown off the ship because there
wasn't enough food. Spielberg doesn't pull any punches here; just as he
did in Schindler's List, he allows the material to speak for itself, and
the result is pure and painful to watch. Cinque's character, as well, is
an enticing individual, even though he doesn't speak a word of English.
His struggles are easily accessible to the audience, and understanding
him is almost too easy a task.</P>
<P>    I found great satisfaction from the last fifteen minutes of the
film; two of the scenes nearly brought me to tears. The way Spielberg
ends the film--almost as a hollow victory--seems so appropriate for the
subject of slavery. I went into Amistad not knowing much about what I
was going to see, and, despite its problems, I left the theater with
something new and tangible to think about.</P>
