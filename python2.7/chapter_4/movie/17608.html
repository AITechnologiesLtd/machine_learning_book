                           THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS
                         A movie review by Joe Barlow
                              (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:  Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, John Cleese
DIRECTOR:  Sam Weisman
WRITER:    Marc Lawrence (based on the screenplay by Neil Simon)
RATED:     PG-13
RELEASED:  1999</PRE>
<PRE>                 RATING: ***  (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        Ever have one of those days?  I'm not referring to a
mere "bad day"-- we all have those on occasion, and in the
end things usually work out okay.  No, I'm talking about the
kind of day where the universe itself seems to be on a personal
vendetta against you; when life flings catastrophe at you like
bread crumbs at a duck pond; when you'd give anything to be
having ONLY a "bad day."</P>
<P>        Henry Clark (Steve Martin) isn't merely having one of
those days; he's having one of those *lives*.  He no longer
knows how to relate to Nancy (Goldie Hawn), his wife of
twenty-four years.  His daughter has dropped out of medical
school to pursue an acting career.  He's recently been fired
from his job, although he's afraid to tell Nancy.  And his
son Alan (Oliver Hudson, the real-life son of Goldie Hawn)
is about to move to London, which will leave the house empty
except for Henry and his wife... a thought which terrifies
the couple, since they will now be forced to communicate with
each other.  So when Henry gets an interview with an advertising
firm in New York City, a land of golden opportunities, he and
Nancy think it may be a sign that their luck is about to change.
They are correct: it's about to get much, much worse.</P>
<P>        The trip starts off with a bad omen: their plane is
rerouted to Boston due to heavy fog, an event which will
eventually result in Henry and Nancy arriving in the Big Apple
with no money, no credit, no food, no clothes, no patience, and
no idea how to resolve their predicament.  From this moment on,
"The Out-of-Towners" shifts gears into slapstick comedy while a
never-ending string of disasters besets our weary, hungry couple:
Rest assured that anytime Henry or Nancy enter a new locale,
something horrible is about to happen to them.  I sighed.  Since
the film seemed to be in the process of settling into a rut of
cheap comedic payoff, my expectations plummeted.</P>
<P>        But a funny thing happened on the way to the lowest
common denominator: Henry and Nancy came to life on the
screen!  I found that against all logic, I was actually
becoming interested in the fate of our two lead characters,
and started cheering for them to triumph over their
circumstances.  Credit Martin and Hawn, last seen together in
1992's "Housesitter," for possessing a plethora of screen
chemistry and the ability to rise above a screenplay that has
no sense of restraint.  Somehow, their characters find the
time to experience the beauty and pulse of New York, despite
all the wretchedness they're going through.  This could be the
reason I liked them so much: I'm dreadfully tired of movies
in which the people do nothing but whine.</P>
<P>        Director Sam Weisman ("George of the Jungle") repeatedly
stages the movie's most intimate moments in public places: in
hotel lobbies, on sidewalks, in Central Park, on crowded airplanes,
etc.  It's an interesting choice, perhaps intending to reflect an
urban culture in which privacy is a privilege, not a right.
Through Henry and Nancy's public displays of emotion (both good
and bad), we understand and identify with the frustrations of
these two wonderful people.  Hawn brings a fiery streak to Nancy,
giving her an impressive dramatic flair (I liked the scene in
which she attempts to seduce a businessman (Mark McKinney) in a
madcap plan to obtain some food), while Martin has imbued the
loveable Henry with the fierce sense of sarcasm he (Martin)
displayed so hilariously in "The Muppet Movie."  For example,
during an exchange with an auto-rental clerk:</P>
<PRE>        CLERK: "Our cars are very safe.  They practically
                drive themselves."
        HENRY: "That's great."
        CLERK: "Would like you collision insurance?"
        HENRY: <trying not to go ballistic> "If the car drives
               itself, wouldn't any accident be its fault?"</PRE>
<P>        "Monty Python's" John Cleese is also wonderfully evil in
his extended cameo as Mr. Mersault, a snooty hotel clerk whose
driving passion seems to be making the Clarks' lives miserable.</P>
<P>        "The Out-of-Towners" is based on Arthur Miller's 1970
film of the same name, which starred Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis
in the lead roles.  I haven't seen the original movie, and have
no idea how faithful this version is to it, but I must admit that
I had a good time.  The cast is absolutely wonderful, the dialogue
has teeth, and if the film occasionally borders on absurdity, then
hey, so does life.</P>
<P>        "The Out-of-Towners" is marvelous fun, and I laughed both
loudly and often.  And how wonderful to see a romantic comedy
that has the guts to cast two middle-age actors in the lead
roles!  The way Hollywood seems to make movies, one would think
that all hormones magically evaporate from the human body around
age 35.  Kudos to someone for telling it like it is.</P>
