<PRE>FORCES OF NATURE (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Steve Kong
Copyright 1999 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Forces of Nature is a film that I fell in love with from the very start.
This film has a sort of charm and style that immediately drew me in, and as
the film moved on, it showed that it doesn't just rely on charm and style
to keep me loving it.</P>
<P>Ben Holmes (Ben Affleck) is a guy who writes the blurbs on the inside of
book jackets. He and his fiancée Bridget (Maura Tierney) live in New York,
but have decided to have their wedding in Savannah. Bridget leaves early
for Savannah, while Ben stays behind in New York for a day because of some
family complications. Ben, who has a fear of flying, gets unwittingly onto
a plane that will take him to Savannah.  But, as the plane is about to
take-off, it crashes. Stuck with no way to get to Savannah, in comes Sarah
(Sandra Bullock) who has struck a deal with a guy named Vic to get to
Savannah in a small rented car. As you might have guessed, this is only the
beginning of Ben and Sarah's adventures.</P>
<P>Along the way to Savannah, Ben and Sarah find different modes of
transportation. And everything that could go wrong, does go wrong. They
encounter fires, rain, hail, and anything else that nature can throw at
them. During all of these happenings Ben starts to look at why he is
getting married to Bridget. He wonders if he truly loves Bridget or if he
is really in love with the free spirited Sarah. The story doesn't all
pertain to Ben though; there is a subplot with Bridget and an old
boyfriend. And Sarah is not as big of a free spirit as she initially leads
us to believe.</P>
<P>Though a movie can throw gobs of charm and style at an audience, it only
carries a film so far. And the director, Bronwen Hughes, and writer, Marc
Lawrence, know exactly this. So, although Forces of Nature is full of charm
and style, both Ben and Sarah are also fully fleshed out three-dimensional
characters that we can relate to and care about. It also helps that Affleck
and Bullock have a tangible onscreen chemistry. On top of that Affleck and
Tierney also have that same tangible onscreen chemistry. So, as the film
goes on we know that someone is going to get hurt, but we don't want anyone
to. And throughout the film we are wondering whom Ben will eventually end
up with.</P>
<P>Forces of Nature could have ended up as a mediocre film that is a lump of
different other films.  But, a smart script, strong performances, and a
wonderful sense of style keep the film from that. All through the film
there is a sense that the filmmakers know exactly what they want and how
they want it to turn out, and this helps the film immensely.</P>
<P>Affleck, who hasn't really had a lead role in his career, shows that he is
lead-role material. He also shows that he is not a one-hit-wonder.
Following his brilliant performance in Chasing Amy, his Academy Award for
Good Will Hunting, his small and hilarious role in Shakespeare in Love, and
his huge presence in last summer's Armageddon, Forces of Nature is a film
that shows that Affleck is here to stay. Kudos to Affleck for a wonderful
performance in Forces of Nature.</P>
<P>Bullock, who shot to stardom in Speed and then had a string of miserable
failures (Practical Magic and Hope Floats being the latest), comes back
with guns blazing. She is able to recapture that girl-next-door persona
that we all fell in love with in the film Speed. Kudos to Bullock for a
wonderful performance in Forces of Nature.</P>
<P>Though not something that I would have expected from a romantic-comedy, the
special effects in Forces of Nature are superb. They are subtle enough not
to completely take us out of the film, but stunning enough to make us
notice. There are two standout squences: The rain/hail sequence early on in
the film and the hurricane/party sequence towards the end of the film. I
especially loved the rain/hail sequence.</P>
<P>>From the get-go I knew Forces of Nature was a Don't Miss film. There's just
nothing to hate about this film and everything to love. Don't Miss Forces
of Nature on the big screen. This is a wonderful romantic comedy.</P>
