<PRE>No Beauty in the `Eye of the Beholder'
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Have you ever been in an automobile accident where
you've miraculously walked away with only a few
scratches, yet the car has been obliterated into an
unrecognizable, mangled wreck?  Well, that has never
actually happened to me and I hope that none of us
will ever experience this situation.  But after
watching this inane exercise of a movie, I certainly
feel that I've miraculously walked away unscathed
after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back
and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond.</P>
<P>Oddly, `Eye of the Beholder,' which is a
psychological-romance-thriller, starts off promisingly
enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a
British Intelligence agent, called The Eye (Ewan
McGregor), working in Washington DC.  In the humorous
opening scene, he eyes a top lawyer across the street
in his office with his pants down.  Using an array of
high-tech surveillance and communications equipment,
he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer
to PC screens and fax machines in his office.  The law
firm's employees get a good chuckle.  The audience
gets a good chuckle. </P>
<P>The Eye is later given an assignment where he
encounters a beautiful woman (Ashley Judd).  There is
something compelling about this mysterious woman. 
Despite her glamorous looks, however, we learn that
she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that
get too close to her.  After the murders, she sobs
while singing the Christmas tune `Little Bluebirds'
and laments about being abandoned by her father long
ago.  After each killing, she puts on a different wig,
assumes a new name, and then makes her way to another
state.  </P>
<P>The Eye has witnessed all her murderous
transgressions.  But he does not alert the
authorities.  He somehow empathizes with her sense of
loss.  The Eye, it turns out, also is haunted by his
past.  His daughter was taken away from him and he
anguishes this loss every day of his life.  His
tormented psyche creates a ghost-like image of his
daughter with which he engages in conversation.  She
becomes a sort of spectral adviser, and one thing that
the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the
woman.  He now diverts his energies into trying to
help her find some kind of salvation.  It doesn't
matter that he has witnessed all of her murders.  And
it doesn't matter that The Eye is abnormally reticent,
hiding his entire life behind computer screens.  He
follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows
her every move to keep her out of trouble.  When a
crazed druggie (Jason Priestley) attacks her, he shows
up for some quick butt kicking.  When the police are
closing in to arrest her, he provides a distraction so
that she can escape.  All the while, the woman has no
idea who her guardian angel is and The Eye stays just
out of sight.  Peculiar.</P>
<P>How bad is this movie?  I refer you to my `Review
Quote Source' litmus test.  Just take a look at the
full-page ad in the newspaper and see where they are
pulling quotes.   For this movie, they are from
magazines called `Flaunt' and `Mirabella.'  No doubt,
they were impressed with Judd's series of catwalks and
disguise changes.  The major problem with `Eye of the
Beholder' is that the film jerks forward, always
unsure of its ultimate destination.   If it was a
thriller, there was little to keep us entranced.  If
it was a love story, there was absolutely no emotional
pull.  Completely disjointed in structure, it's only
saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of
my favorite car commercial (the one where the `6' on
the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a
passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on
a child's train set).  I am also still hopeful that
Ashley Judd will find a serious role to showcase her
potential talents.  Beyond that, the film is
hopelessly out-of-control and is in need of seriously
better traction and handling.</P>
