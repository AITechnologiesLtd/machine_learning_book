<P>     In an era when too many films bludgeon you with exposition,
desperately afraid of leaving anyone behind, Neil LaBute says as much with
what he refuses to tell you as he does with his words.  His blistering
1997 debut IN THE COMPANY OF MEN explored corporate and interpersonal
power games without ever naming the company, its product, or the city in
which it was located.  In so doing, he gave the story an uncomfortable
sense of generic familiarity.  Now comes YOUR FRIENDS & NEIGHBORS, a tale
of the complicated social and sexual dynamics between six urbanites:
college drama teacher Jerry (Ben Stiller); his live-in girlfriend Terri
(Catherine Keener); he best friend Barry (Aaron Eckhart); Barry's wife
Mary (Amy Brenneman); their womanizing pal Cary (Jason Patric); and
artist's assistant Cheri (Nastassja Kinski).</P>
<P>     Chuckle at the rhyming name conceit if you will, but that would only
be your most immediate reaction if you saw them in the closing credits.
You'd spend a bit more time puzzling over the realization that not a
single one of those names was ever spoken during the film.  For all the
memorable conversations LaBute gives to his characters, YOUR FRIENDS &
NEIGHBORS is really about failure in communication, a failure at achieving
any semblance of intimacy.  Cary prepares for his sexual encounters by
rehearsing his pillow talk into a tape recorder; Terri berates Jerry for
"breaking [her] concentration" by talking during sex; Barry and Mary find
themselves unable to talk about their sexual dysfunction problems, leading
to Mary seeking comfort from another man.  Despite the friendship or love
which ostensibly is between them, these six people treat each other like
strangers, as though they don't even know each other's names.</P>
<P>     It's a premise just as provocative as that of IN THE COMPANY OF MEN,
but it's not executed with quite the same skill.  IN THE COMPANY OF MEN
was an example of clockwork plotting, leading a viewer to a powerful
conclusion in which everything that preceded it suddenly took on greater
resonance.  YOUR FRIENDS & NEIGHBORS is more pure character study, less
concerned with where the characters are going than with where they are.
The few bits of unique composition LaBute includes, specifically a
recurring scene in an art gallery where only the characters change, are
more self-consciously clever than revelatory.  As intriguing and often
darkly comic as YOUR FRIENDS & NEIGHBORS may be, it doesn't entirely
satisfy as a narrative.  It's more like a slice of domestic life sliced
off with the razor of LaBute's caustic words -- Altman's SHORT CUTS as
written by David Mamet.</P>
<P>     That still makes YOUR FRIENDS & NEIGHBORS a cut above the
competition, particularly as a showcase for its cast.  Jason Patric sinks
his teeth into the showiest role, the baldly self-absorbed Cary,
delivering one monologue about participating in a sexual assault with a
frightening tenderness.  Aaron Eckhart, the callow Chad from IN THE
COMPANY OF MEN, is almost unrecognizable as the paunchy cuckold who
believes that he has been his own most satisfying sexual partner.  The
women fare less well, with Amy Brenneman a puzzlement as the unhappy Mary,
but every one of the six principal performers has at least one gripping
moment.  YOUR FRIENDS & NEIGHBORS isn't the icy triumph IN THE COMPANY OF
MEN was, but it continues Neil LaBute's unflinching, unnerving examination
of language as assault, of every human interaction as a power struggle.
He says all the things we're generally unwilling to admit we say...and,
sometimes, the things we don't say.</P>
