<P>_Nutty_Professor_II:_The_Klumps_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>"Eddie Murphy is the Klumps," state the print ads for
_Nutty_Professor_II:_The_Klumps_, and Universal must be commended for an
uncommon level of truth in advertising.  Peter Segal's entertaining
sequel to Tom Shadyac's smash 1996 remake of the Jerry Lewis starrer
_The_Nutty_Professor_ is, like the original, a stunning testimony to the
brilliance and versatility of its star.  Indeed, Eddie Murphy _is_ 
_The_Klumps_.</P>
<P>As in the first film, Murphy not only plays large, gentle Professor
Sherman Klump, but also Sherman's grouchy father Cletus, loving mother
Etta, surly brother Ernie, and feisty Granny--as well as Sherman's
destructive alter ego, Buddy Love.  As the film opens, Sherman is haunted
by and occasionally taken over by Buddy, the manifestation of his more
outspoken urges.  Seeing the ever-increasing emergence of his Buddy
personality as a threat to his relationship with his true love, colleague
Denise Gaines (Janet Jackson), Sherman undergoes a risky procedure to
have Buddy's DNA permanently removed from his brain.  Naturally, things
don't go as smoothly as planned, and while Buddy is indeed separated from
Sherman, he becomes an entirely separate person.</P>
<P>The science that brings about the rebirth of Buddy--who, in an inspired
twist, isn't quite his old self--is pure hokum, as are all the mechanics
behind the ingredient at the center of the film: Sherman's revolutionary
youth formula, which he hides from Buddy in the Klump family garage.  But
more than the Klump home plays an increased role in _Nutty II_; as the
title implies, Sherman's other family members are given subplots of their
own--most prominently Mama and Papa, who are looking to bring back some
spark in their marriage; and Granny, who has a new beau (Gabriel
Williams) with whom she shares the joy of "relations."  Not only are the
family members' roles expanded, so is the type of humor surrounding them.
 Director Peter Segal and writers Barry W. Blaustein, David Sheffield,
Paul Weitz, and Chris Weitz (the latter two the duo who directed
_American Pie_) haven't completely dropped the toilet humor that
characterized the Klump family's two scenes in the original film (though
they probably should have; the flatulence jokes are among the film's
flattest gags), but the bulk of their laughs derive from their
personalities--or in the case of hilariously bickering Papa and Granny,
the clash of them.</P>
<P>With a number of other Klumps getting their share of screen time along
with Sherman, not to mention Buddy (who once again plots Sherman's ruin),
something had to give, and what gets the short shrift is the romance. 
Jackson, in her first screen role since _Poetic_Justice_, is likable and
poised, but Denise is so blandly written, loving Sherman unconditionally
from first frame to the last and doing little else.  It would have been
nice to see their relationship develop, like the first film's more
endearing one between Sherman and Jada Pinkett's Carla Purdy (who is
briefly mentioned here); or at least run into some turbulence to create
some dramatic tension.  But since they're perfect for each other,
everything's perfect between them, and while that's all well and good, it
doesn't make for the most interesting of viewing.</P>
<P>But what never fails to interest is the virtuoso acting display by
Murphy.  With four credited writers, the script of _The_Klumps_ doesn't
always quite flow, but Murphy's unparalleled prowess smooths over the
rough spots.  Each character he plays is clearly, distinctly drawn and
funny and endearing in his or her own way.  Of course, Murphy's bravura
turn is aided immeasurably by Rick Baker's outstanding makeup work and
the efforts of the visual effects crew, but it is Murphy who gives each
one of the Klumps energy and soul.</P>
<P>That's what ultimately makes _The_Klumps_ an enjoyable time at the
movies: its overall high spirits--and, of course, the simple fact that it
makes you laugh.  And in the season of unpretentious cinematic
entertainment, that's what matters.</P>
