<P>   They say that absinthe makes the heart grow fonder, but
don't believe it.  This liqueur with its opaline-green color,
flavored with wormwood and consumed largely by bluebloods
from the American South can make a mean and crafty
gentleman into an even more dangerous and deceptive dude. 
If the imbiber is cursed with epilepsy to boot, watch out.  You
don't know what he's capable of doing.  What's more, even he
may be oblivious to his actions.  By centering "Deceiver" on
such an individual, Jonas Pate who directed the dazzling
police drama which he and his twin brother Josh wrote have
concocted an intoxicating whodunit.  This cat-and-mouse
game between a murder suspect and two detectives who
subject him to a series of polygraph tests pits a Princeton
summa cum laude graduate with a 151 I.Q. against two cops
who just can't keep up with his maneuvers.  Conceived with
the working title "The Liar," the Pates' rogue has as much in
common with a recent picture bearing a similar name as does
Tim Roth with Jim Carrey.</P>
<P>   Filmed entirely in one of the most handsome of American
cities, Charleston, South Carolina, "Deceiver" fails to exploit
its location but is photographed principally within one of the
town's police precincts and in the minds of its three principal
characters.  A classy prostitute, Elizabeth (Renee Zellweger),
is found dead, divided in half by a long kitchen knife and
buried in suitcases in opposite corners of the municipality.  A
suspect who has been frequently seen with her and who, in
fact, had invited her to a posh party in his parents' home is
pulled in by two detectives from the polygraph unit, Kennesaw
(Michael Rooker) and Braxton (Chris Penn).  The suspect,
Wayland (Tim Roth), has no lawyer but needs none: he is
convinced that he can turn the tables on his interrogators and
by doing so can be permanently removed from suspicion.   
On the one hand Wayland--who had from time to time
conversed with the hooker but who insists he had never
touched her--has brains and money in his favor.  He is what
they still call in Charleston a blueblood, whose wealthy father
provides him with enough cash to allow him access to
important information about the town's residents.  On the
other hand, he is an alcoholic who is fond of absinthe, and
subject to liquor-augmented seizures.  When in the midst of a
paroxysm, he can climb furniture and attack people who touch
him without recalling the event when he returns to
consciousness.  </P>
<P>   During the course of several sessions with the lie detector,
Wayland surprises the two cops with his knowledge of their
weaknesses.  For Braxton it's an addiction to gambling, a
compulsion which has put him $20,000 in debt to the head of
the town's underworld, Mook (Ellen Burstyn).  For Kennesaw
it's a seething, internal rage against his wife, a woman who
outclasses him and who is having an affair.  "Deceiver" is one
movie that helps prove the premise bandied about in the
nation's schools that knowledge is power.  By seeming to
know as much about their lives as they do themselves,
Wayland is able to gain the upper hand on the detectives, an
advantage that gives the final half hour of the piece a
particularly compelling nature.  Hold on to your shoes
because the final twenty seconds--which sew up the loose
strings--may knock your socks off.</P>
<P>   Josh and Jonas Pate are known to a select audience for
their 1996 Sundance Film Festival work, "The Grave." That
indie movie looks at first like a horror picture but actually
deals in an intermittently comic style with a shotgun-wielding
maniac and some moronic grave-robbers motivated by what
they hear about a rich man who buried millions of dollars of
goods inside his own grave.  Shucking their preoccupation
with over-the-top theatrics, the Pates this time have
disciplined themselves wonderfully to produce a work
emphasizing language, particularly its use by the articulate
Wayland to turn the tables on his examiners.</P>
<P>   In a sense, it's a shame that cameraman Bill Butler is able
to give us just a scant insight into the beauty and charm of
that old world city of Charleston--every bit as aristocratic as
the Savannah, Georgia of "Midnight in the Garden of Good
and Evil."  Instead he focuses inward to underscore the
churning of emotions as three men play their canny chess-like
game of one-upmanship.  As such the movie takes on a
theatrical milieu, with its emphasis on dialogue and situation
in enclosed spaces.  Yet "Deceiver" works quite well on the
big screen thanks to a clever plot and its larger-than-life
performers, particularly the great Tim Roth--who has
entertained us so wonderfully in a variety of villainous roles in
movies like "Rob Roy" and "Hoodlum."  When Roth's pupils
bury themselves deep into his forehead, we in the audience
virtually feel the torment of a man succumbing to seizures, fits
made all the more devastating by his love for absinthe and his
consumption of powerful pills.  We sit at the edge of our seats
understanding perfectly the perspiration that pours from
Michael Rooker's brow, the tension that builds in Chris Penn's
body as he tries to regain command over out-of-control
situations.  Ellen Burstyn is not so fortunate, being cast not
too successfully (and virtually unrecognizably) against type as
the remarkably sinister queen of the underworld, a woman
who dispenses pills, takes bets, and generally knows the
weaknesses of the important people in this closed community
of manifestly antebellum aristocrats.  As Elizabeth, Renee
Zellweger has thrown off the naivete that allowed her to go
totally gaga over Tom Cruise in "Jerry Maguire," turning in a
fairly convincing role as a seductive prostitute, while Rosanna
Arquette acquits herself well as the abused wife of the
policeman she married beneath her class.</P>
<P>   "Deceiver," like "L.A. Confidential," is a thoroughly adult
drama which presses its audience to listen carefully to the
spoken word and keeps the Big Secret effectively hidden until
the final, dramatic frames. Rated R.  Running time: 102
minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
