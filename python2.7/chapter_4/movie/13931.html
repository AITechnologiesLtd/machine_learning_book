<PRE>A Bittersweet "Return to Paradise"
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>How much would you be willing to sacrifice for someone that you hardly
knew?  For my family and closest of friends, I'm sure that I'd sacrifice
everything I could to help them.  But I'm not so sure that I could say
the same if the person in question was just some casual acquaintance.</P>
<P>Sheriff (Vince Vaughn) and Tony (David Conrad) are faced with that same
moral dilemma.  Two years ago, these two and Lou (Joaqin Phoenix) met as
vacationers in Malaysia.  They spent their days and nights picking up as
many women as possible, drinking as much beer as possible, and smoking
as much hashish as possible since it's so easy to buy and inexpensive
too.  A few days after Sheriff and Tony left, the police raided the
bungalow and found Lou and all of the leftover hashish.  Because of the
excessive amounts found, Lou was charged with trafficking, which carries
a sentence of death.</P>
<P>Sheriff and Tony find out about this after they are located by Lou's
attorney, Beth (Anne Heche).  With only 8 days left until Lou's
execution, Beth explains to them that she has struck a deal with the
Malaysian magistrate.  If one or both goes back to share the
responsibility and serve jail time, Lou's life will be spared.  Tony has
a beautiful fiancée, a promising life, and a heart of gold.  He
tentatively agrees to go back if Sheriff will too.  However, the burly
Sheriff who has always been reckless and careless can not find it within
him to go back.  And both voice extreme reservations about their chances
of survival given that the prison system is fraught with disease,
malnutrition, and guards that randomly torture the inmates.  With time
running out, Beth must find a way to change their minds.</P>
<P>Beth's task is enormous.  She delicately walks a fine line between
promoting the courage behind the deed and moral blackmail.  All the
while, she is also being hounded by a hungry reporter that threatens the
stability of her deal.  I liked Heche's performance.  She remained
focused and I liked the way her character tried to read every emotion in
order to figure out the next mode of approach.  She's sincere but also
scheming at the same time.  Another nice element was the questionable
attraction that Heche develops for Sheriff.  Is this just one of her
plays?  Already in a situation mired with ambiguity, this further
complicates Sheriff's life as the loner slowly learns the meaning of
compassion.</P>
<P>Despite the good performances and the pungent atmosphere, I somehow
wished that this film would have been more compelling.  As pure drama,
this film delivers, but my reservation lies within the fact that the
storyline was too cerebral in nature.  I would have preferred something
more visceral.  I would have liked a closer examination of the Malaysian
government's view on drug trafficking or would have liked to have seen
the brutal environment of the prisons.  I think that with that added
sensation, this movie might have been more memorable.  Nonetheless,
Heche's worthy performance and good supporting roles merit a
recommendation.</P>
