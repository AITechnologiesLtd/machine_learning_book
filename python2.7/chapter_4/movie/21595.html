<P>LIGHT IT UP smolders and spits out some smoke, but no fire.  The film
treads lightly on the volatile crossroads where disenchanted inner city
youth meet the desperate state of urban public education.  A la HIGHER
LEARNING, the prevailing simplification of issues concludes with empty
and confusing platitudes in answer to some complex stuff.</P>
<P>Queens, New York – it's about as bad as it can get at Lincoln High.
Almost nobody has textbooks, snow is blowing through broken windows in
dilapidated classrooms, and student favorite Mr. Knowles (Judd Nelson –
THE BREAKFAST CLUB, FROM THE HIP) was just fired for no good reason by
heavy-handed Principal Armstrong.  When Officer Dante Jackson (Forest
Whitaker – THE CRYING GAME, JASON'S LYRIC) struggles to detain gifted
student artist `Ziggy' Malone on bogus charges, Lester Dewitt (Usher
Raymond) takes matters into his own hands by seizing the Officer's gun
and taking Jackson hostage.  Now barricaded against the New York Police
Department, the basketball star Lester, the artist `Ziggy,' along with a
student council member, a punk-rocker, a hustler, and a gang banger have
to figure out what they are standing for.</P>
<P>Lester and the other students ultimately attempt to use their newfound
leverage to demand improvements for a decent education.  They use e-mail
to rally support from the community and dispel allegations by the media
that they are nothing but violent gang vigilantes.  As negotiations
fail, the stakes for Lester, the other students, and Officer Jackson
escalate.  The dramatic climax centers around whether loss of life can
be avoided as the NYPD closes in without meeting Lester's conditions.</P>
<P>Some may contend that LIGHT IT UP does well to leave its audience
frustrated with incomplete answers; after all, there are no easy
solutions to the problems it examines.  On the other hand, it seems
irresponsible to present such radical actions and then gloss over the
consequences in this incomplete fashion.  Call me old school, but I'd
rather `light it up' with a pint of JD than a ticket to this show – at
least a hangover usually has a few decent stories to go with it.</P>
<PRE>2.5 stars</PRE>
