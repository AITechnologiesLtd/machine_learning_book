<P>Late in "The Adventures Of Sebastian Cole", there is a prom scene. But
it's not a normal high school movie prom scene. A conversation arises
between the title character and his friends, about how different their
prom is from proms they've seen on film, that it prompts Sebastian to
say, "I hate those high school movies."</P>
<PRE>Don't we all?</PRE>
<P>But Tod Williams' "The Adventures Of Sebastian Cole" turns Ferris
Bueller flat on his face, bringing us a high-school flick that is
offbeat, unsentimental and dead-on. The structure of "Sebastian Cole"
is set up so that we, the viewer, get to experience the randomness of
adolescence.</P>
<P>Sebastian Cole (Adrian Grenier) is a 17-year-old slacker who lives in
upstate New York with his stepfather (Clark Gregg), his mother (Margaret
Colin) and his sister (Marni Lustig). One day, the father calls a
family meeting to announce that he is going to have surgery in order
to become a woman. Sebastian's sister throws a fit and runs off to
California, while Sebastian leaves with his mother to England.</P>
<P>But after six months in an uptight school, he leaves his neurotic mom
and comes back to New York to start his new life with Hank/Henrietta,
his stepfather/stepmother.  Sebastian continues to do poorly in
school, and announces that he just wants to "live" more, and the movie
becomes his adventures.</P>
<P>His adventures include an up-and-down relationship with a girl (Aleksa
Palladino), riding his bike at top speed through the halls of school,
and seeing what happens when he drinks way too much.</P>
<P>Writer/director Tod Williams has the 80's mood down perfectly, but he
is helped by two amazing performances. As Sebastian, newcomer Adrian
Grenier ("Hurricane Streets") pulls off a more-than-believable
portrayal of teenage angst, but it is Clark Gregg, as Hank/Henrietta
who steals the show. He is exceptional without being over-the-top, and
I can see a starring role for him in the near future.</P>
<P>Since many questions are left unanswered, many will leave "The
Adventures Of Sebastian Cole" baffled. But Tod Williams has infused a
subtle grace to the seemingly shaky structure, and he shows that in
teenage life, the answers aren't always there.</P>
<P>"The Adventures Of Sebastian Cole" is not a great film, but it is one
of the most original portrayals of adolescence that I've ever
seen. Tod Williams has made an excellent first film, a film with the
quirkiness of John Irving, but with a style all his own.</P>
