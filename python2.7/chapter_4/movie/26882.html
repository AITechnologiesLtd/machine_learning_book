<PRE>The Legend Of Drunken Master </PRE>
<P>How much martial arts fighting can you take? How much kung fu fighting can a 
movie have and still have a story? How many men can the world's greatest 
combatant take on? How many impossible situations can a hero survive through 
before your suspension of disbelief is gone? Those are the questions "The 
Legend of Drunken Master" poses - and your answer to the last question is how 
much you will like or dislike this movie. </P>
<P>A lot of critics who have reviewed this film don't discuss much of the story 
since this a Jackie Chan movie and the choreography of the stunts and 
fighting are the focus of the movie. Still, I think it's worth mentioning 
because as far as cheesy martial arts movies go, this one has a pretty 
intricate story that is both antagonistic of the action as well as reflective 
of it. For a movie that is about 2/3rds fighting there's enough background 
detail to fit into one normal movie. </P>
<P>The setting is a Chinese city in the 1930's or so. Jackie Chan plays the 
eldest son of a doctor and as the film opens he figures out a way to smuggle 
ginseng onto a train so that they don't have to pay taxes on it. Chan's 
character is a mischievous lil' devil and his ideas tend to do more harm than 
good. Soon he finds himself fighting with an old man he doesn't know and when 
he returns home he has to find a substitute for the ginseng because he lost 
it to the old man. His father is a pretty over-bearing, strict conservative 
guy who never seems to be in a good mood. Chan's best known for his physical 
action but the script here puts him in many situations where he must run all 
over the place in order to not get in trouble. It's lowbrow and slapstick, 
but it's in good humor so it's passable. </P>
<P>The story itself is kind of fuzzy. It has something to do with British 
Ambassadors smuggling out ancient Chinese artifacts with the help of some 
crooked executives at an iron mill. There's an entire story running virtually 
simultaneously as Chan's story about workers in the mill who are treated like 
slaves by these nasty guys. You know they're going to get their cumuppence in 
the end. </P>
<P>But how does the movie breakdown this process? Only average at best I'd say. 
The screenplay seems to be written backwards with the story existing as the 
glue between the fight scenes. It's exhausting after a while because the 
action keeps going and going. There's no breaks for some drama or character 
development - all this crops up as things roll along. It's like someone 
telling you a story while you're walking to your car and once you start to 
drive away they run alongside to finish the story. By the time the third act 
rolls around the plausible story seems to have been long forgotten about but 
the action continues to build and build. The last act is all fight scenes 
that look like background visuals in a video game and not the exciting 
showdowns you're expecting. </P>
<P>The final 20 minutes are made up of one fight sequence between Chan and the 
head honcho of the evil executives. It's probably the most physically 
demanding fight and carefully choreographed action you can expect out of 
human beings. Chan and his nemesis pretty much get their clock cleaned by 
each other (including being thrown into a pit of hot coals and breathing fire 
on each other). It's almost disturbing and far too serious for what had 
started out as such a high spirited movie. </P>
<P>So how much kung fu fighting CAN you handle? "The Legend of Drunken Master" 
shows that even those not easily amused by martial arts can still appreciate 
the work and dedication Chan and his cronies have to their craft. They just 
need to find a way to make a really good movie out of it. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B- </PRE>
