<P>"Topsy-Turvy", for at least its first hour, is fragmented, unfocused and 
incredibly boring. When it finally settles down to actually following some 
semblance of a story, it gives us some wonderfully witty and perceptive 
moments about the putting on of a theatrical production -- but getting there 
is no mean feat. Watching the movie is like an endurance test to see how 
prepared we are to remain in the cinema, and only after a long while do we 
pass and get rewarded.</P>
<P>The film takes place in London in the late 19th Century, where the team 
behind some of the most successful stage musicals of all time, WS Gilbert 
(Jim Broadbent) and Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner), have just released 
"Princess Ida". The show is an international flop, due to sweltering weather 
and reviews that accuse Gilbert and Sullivan of repetitiveness. Sullivan 
agrees with the criticisms, and decides he cannot keep going on writing the 
same material. The partnership seems in jeopardy.</P>
<P>Much is made of this plot point in the early sections of "Topsy-Turvy", and 
yet it does not lead to anything else. Gilbert and Sullivan start to work 
together on "The Mikado" halfway through the film without Sullivan having to 
be won over. There's more: Actors, producers, musicians, friends, relatives 
and business partners are introduced, and then abandoned; some until the end 
of the film, some completely. Several of the main characters are shown to 
have grave weaknesses such as joyless marriages, problems with drugs and 
alcohol, ill health... but none of these things relate to the rest the story.</P>
<P>It's a confusing mishmash of irrelevance, not least because Mike Leigh, the 
writer and director, feels the need to jump in and out of hundreds of 
different locations without ever exploring them. He's never had to explore 
before, since all his previous films have been gritty dramas set in easily 
recognisable modern-day situations; but he does here, because the densely 
cluttered interiors of Victorian London are alien to most of us, and we need 
to get our bearings.</P>
<P>That is easy to do once rehearsals for "The Mikado" begin, because then 
"Topsy-Turvy" spends most of its time in one place -- the theatre. It is 
immensely satisfying to watch songs and dance routines develop, and see 
actors master their lines. Leigh knows this, and allows entire musical 
numbers to act as the payoffs to a lot of his scenes.</P>
<P>As someone who has both directed an independent film and starred in several 
school plays, I also enjoyed "Topsy-Turvy" for its entirely accurate 
depictions of the difficulties that arise when doing such things. Technical 
problems are a mere trifle when actors are making ridiculous complaints about 
their costumes, or not paying attention to directions and testing their own 
terrible ideas on how to play their roles. The picture's best moment comes 
when one of the "Mikado" players suddenly develops another accent, and 
Gilbert stops the rehearsal to say in shocked disbelief: "You've become a 
Cockney!"</P>
<P>It doesn't sound very funny, I know, but the humour is in Broadbent's timing. 
"Topsy-Turvy" features a lot of excellent performances; costume dramas bring 
something miraculous out of British actors -- they're put into different 
worlds, and so the only way to be convincing is to completely inhabit their 
roles. Nobody here does that better than Broadbent, whose eyes are always 
busy, whose mouth is always muttering something to itself -- he really does 
seem to be thinking Gilbert's thoughts.</P>
<P>Rethinking all the film's good qualities, though, leaves me even more 
perplexed at what on earth was going on during its first hour, which is a 
pointless, dreary waste of time made even worse by the fact that my watch was 
broken. Perhaps the projectionist got the reels in the wrong order. 
Topsy-turvy indeed.</P>
