<PRE>ARLINGTON ROAD
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        In the wake of the recent Columbine High School tragedy, and the
not-so-recent Oklahoma City bombing, some people felt that a film like the
incendiary "Arlington Road," with its homegrown terrorism theme, might have
difficulty securing a widespread release.  But finally moviegoers are being
given an opportunity to see it, an opportunity well worth pursuing.</P>
<P>        "Arlington Road," for all of the difficult memories it may
reawaken, is an excellent motion picture.</P>
<P>        The only sequence more shocking than the film's disturbing opener
is the last, a heart-pounding, brilliantly-constructed series of events
that comes close to matching the surprise and unconventionality of
"Psycho"'s famous shower scene.  No amount of cold hard currency will force
me to reveal the film's startling denouement, but if you don't leave the
theater visibly shaken then blood does not flow in your veins.</P>
<P>        Sandwiched between these two cinematic highpoints is a taut, tense,
pulse-quickening film which raises the question "What do your neighbors get
up to behind closed doors?" and then goes on to answer that question in
truly terrifying style.</P>
<P>        The film stars Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, and Joan Cusack and is
written and directed by Mark Pellington, who shows great promise with this,
his second feature.  Bridges plays Michael Faraday, a history professor at
a District of Columbia university who teaches a class on terrorism.  After
helping the injured son of some new neighbors from across the street,
Bridges begins to suspect the normal-looking Langs of plotting a diabolical
scheme involving explosive devices.  Normal-looking, that is, except for
Robbins' severe haircut; just one look at that do and you *know* he's
guilty!</P>
<P>        Faraday's paranoia builds to national security-threatening
proportions, much to the frustration of his girlfriend (sympathetically
played by Hope Davis), and leads to a confrontation that thrusts his whole
family into immediate danger.</P>
<P>        Perhaps the scariest thing about the film is the justifiable fear
of a normal guy realizing how little he knows about the true characters of
his closest neighbors, what they might have hidden behind drapes, buried in
basements, or locked away in attics.  One of Pellington's trump cards is
that he doesn't tip the audience off earlier than necessary in determining
who's the real crazy in this drama.  And he made wise casting choices in
maintaining that suspense: Bridges is brilliant, as is Robbins, and Cusack
(in a rare straight role) has hardly been better.</P>
<P>        In addition to the fine performances, Angelo Badalamenti's creepy
score helps crank up the tension several notches.</P>
<P>        Several years ago, during the filming of a similar Jeff Bridges
mad-bomber thriller called "Blown Away," special effects experts
miscalculated and blew out windows of unrigged buildings adjacent to the
set.  Be prepared to be blown away by "Arlington Road": it carries that
amount of unexpected power.</P>
