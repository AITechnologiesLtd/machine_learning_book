       SLEEPY HOLLOW
       --------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            GRADE: B</PRE>
<P>       One of the most anticipated films of the year (by me, anyway)
       turns out to be a big, beautiful dud. A must-see for sheer
       visual splendor, Sleepy Hollow is nonetheless a fundamentally
       unsatisfying whodunnit that saddles its towering imagery with
       a tortured story that works so hard at misdirection that it
       never realizes what it's good at.</P>
<P>       Johnny Depp plays Ichabod Crane, who in this version of the
       classic tale is a New York policeman sent to the picturesque
       village of Sleepy Hollow, two days' journey up the Hudson
       River, where a number of locals have been reported beheaded.
       Lore has it that a beheaded Hessian horseman who was
       notoriously vicious in life has returned from the dead,
       galloping through the woods under cover of darkness and
       decapitating hapless villagers. Crane has arrived with every
       intention of dispelling this sort of foolish superstition. By
       the time he leaves, he has learned to believe.</P>
<P>       It's too bad Burton isn't much of an action director. Sure,
       he's big on spectacle, but when it comes time to choreograph
       a big showpiece fistfight or chase scene for the camera, he
       can't quite invest it with the requisite sense of
       physicality. (This is one reason why the first Batman movie
       puts me to sleep.) This gives most of the beheadings that
       take place in Sleepy Hollow a detached quality -- they are
       almost certainly meant to be tongue-in-cheek, but I'd like
       them to be a little more lively. The marketing campaign
       (tagline: "Heads will roll") promised some chaotic wickedness
       along the lines of Burton's previous Mars Attacks!, a
       sensibility that is, to some extent, in evidence; still,
       while the scenes are technically impressive, they remain
       strangely uninvolving. (You'd think a stylist like Burton
       would be above the kind of shameless computer-animated
       ooga-booga that's used for a cheap shock in one scene, but
       you'd be wrong.)</P>
<P>       More on-target are the grisly aftermaths of the murders,
       which are presented with a morbidly tongue-in-cheek
       sensibility. There's a certain gothic fascination in the
       sight of Crane kneeling next to a headless corpse, examining
       the reddish-pink tissue of an open neck. It's gruesome, but
       it's a friendly gruesomeness (Burton complained that his
       movie, which is exactly the sort of thing that healthy
       13-year-old boys live for, was saddled with a restrictive R
       rating, rather than a PG-13, and he does have a point).</P>
<P>       In counterpoint to these almost elegant visuals, the
       screenplay, by Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en, 8MM) is just too
       busy. Abandoning the premise of the original Washington
       Irving story, which posited the Headless Horseman as a morbid
       hoax perpetrated on gullible villagers, Walker positions the
       Horseman as a strictly supernatural phenomenon -- a fine
       idea, in itself. The dialogue is pleasantly stylized, but the
       story is hopelessly overwritten, drawing our attention away
       from the vengeful galloping ghost who's the film's
       centerpiece and into the banal convolutions of village life.
       It only gets worse as the tale goes on. Not only must we buy
       into some piffle about the horseman being controlled by one
       of the townspeople, but we're expected to care about their
       petty schemings and power plays, all this while there's a
       back-from-the-grave villain running around who's frankly much
       more interesting than any of them.</P>
<P>       That the screenplay is so bloated with unnecessary
       contrivance is a particular shame in light of the various
       wonders that Burton and Co. have worked elsewhere. In terms
       of visuals, this picture is perhaps the most sure-footed of
       the year. It's photographed in shades of blue and slate-grey,
       with a bloody garnish the color of cherry pie. Johnny Depp
       appears as pale and frightened as the little boys who figure
       into the movie's backstory, and kudos are certainly due for
       the casting of an uncredited Christopher Walken as a
       distorted, silver-teethed rhyme to Depp's fragile
       handsomeness. Christina Ricci is even more delicate here than
       Depp, her round-eyed and childlike china-doll demeanor
       married to a potent yet unassuming sensuality. Late in the
       film, with her head pulled back and her throat in peril,
       we're convinced that something beautiful is in horrible
       danger. Sleepy Hollow could have done well with a rewrite
       that relied more on moments of such innate drama, and less on
       narrative convolution.</P>
