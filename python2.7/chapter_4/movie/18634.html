<P>The idea of a teenage comedy set in a high school has been used
extensively over the past few years. It seems we're also seeing a
pattern in the plot of these movies: a guy or girl is masquerading as
something they are not, they fall in love in the process, and then their
girlfriend or boyfriend finds out about the scheme they are pulling. It
happened in She's All That, it happened in 10 Things I Hate About You,
and now budging in line is Never Been Kissed.</P>
<P>Here, Drew Barrymore plays Josie Gellar, a young reporter for the
Chicago Sun Times. She's given the breakthrough opportunity of her
career: an undercover story about the lifestyle of today's teenagers.
This means that Josie must disguise herself as a 17-year old and go
behind enemy lines at a local high school to get the scoop. She must
elude the school geek (Leelee Sobieski) and become chums with the `in'
girls without hurting anyone's feelings. Ah, to be young again...</P>
<P>Barrymore has come a long way since her turbulent childhood, and has
proven herself to be a great young actress. Even as the film becomes
increasingly hard to swallow, Barrymore has the ability to sweep us off
our feet at any given time. I hardly believed a moment in Never Been
Kissed, but the film and it's stars are so unexpectedly charming and
sweet you will have to fight off the urge to smile.</P>
<P>There is one aspect of the story that is quite different. The main
character here has two alternatives for love. There's her kind English
teacher (Michael Vartan) or a hunky classmate (Jeremy Jordan) who both
have their respective eyes on Josie. Director Raja Gosnell decides to
take the easy route, tying up the loose ends in an unsurprising manner,
but the film's genuine charm still manages to catch you off guard during
the final scenes.</P>
<P>This also leaves room for a few key supporting players to shine. David
Arquette plays Josie's once popular brother, in a funny performance that
rings nicely true. John C. Reilly is her editor, and Garry Marshall
plays the big boss of the paper. The screenplay is about as lumpy as a
disastrous Thanksgiving gravy, but that's the least of your worries.</P>
<P>When you actually stop to think about the movie's plot, you may realize
how completely ludicrous it sounds. Never Been Kissed even ends with the
ultimate teen movie cliché: the Prom. How in the world the film develops
into a sheer delight I may never know, but the probable reason is the
young executive-producer and star. These are high times for Drew
Barrymore, and here she displays the charisma and magnetism that all
great Hollywood actresses possess. I hope the world is ready for Drew,
because she's making her move in high style.</P>
