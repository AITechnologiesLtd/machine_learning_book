A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Barry Levinson</PRE>
<P>Written by: Hilary Henkin and David Mamet, from the novel AMERICAN HERO
by Larry Beinhart</P>
<P>Starring: Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, Anne Heche, Denis Leary,
Willie Nelson, Woody Harrelson</P>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Washington and Hollywood spin doctors making fake news to fool the
American public</PRE>
<P>Synopsis: 
Does a dog wag its tail, or does the tail ever wag the dog? Do events
drive publicity or do publicity specialists drive events? In WAG THE
DOG, it's definitely PR wonks who drive events. This fun spoof is a
behind-the-scenes look at the mechanics of manipulating the American
public - - how over-the-top moguls in Washington and Hollywood use  the
media to control public opinion. Eleven days before the Presidential
election, Presidential aide Winifred (Anne Heche), political spin doctor
Conrad (Robert De Niro), and Hollywood producer Stanley (Dustin Hoffman)
are charged with a monumental publicity project. Although the President
has a comfortable 17% lead in the polls against his opponent, a breaking
new sex scandal concerning the President and a teenage girl threatens to
derail his upcoming reelection. Winifred, Conrad, and Stanley are hired
to distract the public's opinion from the sex scandal. To rally the
American people around the President as well as temporarily take all the
attention away from the sex scandal story, the three spin doctors
produce a fake war between America and Albania in their little movie
studio - - complete with heroes, victims, music, press conferences and
disaster footage. Just as Ronald Reagan's real life inexplicable flash
invasion of Grenada diverted public attention from what certainly would
have been public outcry over the murder of over 200 marines in Beirut,
the three spin doctors figure they can divert attention away from the
President's dubious morality by convincing America it is at war - - just
long enough to ensure the President's reelection. Will the eleven-day
ruse succeed?</P>
<P>Opinion:
I figure the average Hollywood movie these days costs 60 million dollars
to make and takes 90 days to film. Frankly, WAG THE DOG is a much better
movie, and it only cost 15 million to make and thirty days to film. WAG
THE DOG is a fine screenplay with superb acting and a resounding message
as well. The running gag is that the publicity is all fake, and the
public is eating it up.</P>
<P>Although in theory the American government has three branches
(executive, legislative, judicial), in practice it has four. The media
is the fourth branch of government, and we all know in our hearts that
American public opinion is regularly manipulated by media-savvy spin
doctors in Hollywood and Washington, espousing various angles for
economic or political gain. </P>
<P>A racial minority allegedly kills a white. Which angle sells more
papers? In the O.J. Simpson case the press played the race card. In
Cunanan/Versace (Cunanan was Filipino) the press played the gay card.
Impartial news, or just angles for making more money? A Middle Eastern
minority male associated with arms dealing and his white girlfriend die
in a drunk driving accident, not wearing seat belts. Which angle sells
the most papers? The drunk driving angle, or "Princess' Fairy Tale Life
Gets Cut Short."  The answer, of course, is the fairy tale sells more -
- especially if it comes with commercial tie-ins such as tribute CDs
made from re-hashed songs to Marilyn Monroe, with advertisements for the
next album on the back, and perhaps film rights later on. Let's ask
ourselves. Are we being hooked and played for dollars by Hollywood and
Washington spin doctors?</P>
