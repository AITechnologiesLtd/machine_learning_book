<PRE>                                    THE VAN
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>THE COMMITMENTS in 1991 introduced us to the mythical (but
representative) town of  Barrytown in North Dublin.   That was the
first of a trilogy written by Roddy Doyle. You may recall that it was
about an Irish soul band.  This was followed three years later by THE
SNAPPER, about a young woman who becomes pregnant but who will not
reveal who the father is.</P>
<P>The Commitmentswas directed by Alan Parker.  Both Snapper and THE VAN
are the work of Stephen Frears.</P>
<P>Barrytown is a quiet town on the surface but if you look around there
are many stories, funny and sad.  Take Bimbo (Donal O'Kelly) for
instance.  In a town where there are all too many unemployed, Bimbo
gets a pink slip . . . and now he is one of those without hope who hang
out in bars.  But Bimbo is not really one of them; he will work at
anything honest if he can only find something.</P>
<P>Out of the blue, Bimbo realizes that with Ireland qualifying for the
World Cup in football (soccer), there will be many people glued to
their TV sets, unable to cook.  If he can get a van and set it up as a
catering truck, he can make a good bit of change and be his own boss at
the same time,    He also wants to share his new enterprise with his
best friend, Larry (Colm Meany) whom he hires to work with him as a
partner.  Larry's first contribution is to name the van, BIMBO'S
BURGERS.</P>
<P>Another buddy, Weslie (Brendan O'Carroll) finds a van on an empty lot
filled with junk. The van looks "like the inside of a leper," to quote
Bimbo; filthy, rusty, and an engine that will not start up. However,
nothing is going to stop the two friends who have the car towed home
with the aid of hundreds of the town's children joyfully pushing the
vehicle as it is being towed. Bimbo and  Larry work on the van until it
is looking half human. Someone else gets the motor to run and away they
go to the pub where everyone will be watching the games.</P>
<P>It would be nice to report that all went well, that they got tons of
customers and that they made lots of money and lived happily ever
after.  Real life and movies do not work like that and so we are
witness to the trials and tribulations of two friends trying to run a
catering van when neither has any experience.</P>
<P>Not too far into the enterprise, they have a falling out and Larry
wants to quit not only the partnership but their friendship as well
while Bimbo decides what must be done to keep from losing the
friendship of Larry.</P>
<P>Interspersed between the sad parts and the frustrations, there is lots
of comedy provided by Larry who is a big blustering type.</P>
<P>Pity the poor worker who has a family to support, wants to work, but
can find no job.</P>
<P>Others in the cast include Ger Ryan, Caroline Rothwell, Neily Conroy, Ruaidhri Conroy, and Stuart Dunne. </P>
<PRE>Directed by Stephen Frears.</PRE>
