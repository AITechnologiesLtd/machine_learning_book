<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>An outstanding melodrama. It's a film noir that is influenced by Freudian
psychology, and was shot in 18 days by Otto Preminger. The reason for the rush
is that Howard Hughes, the RKO owner, just bought Jean Simmon's contract from
the English studio of J. Arthur Rank and the star, who disliked Hughes, had only
18 days on her contract left. The result was that this was arguably her best
film performance and Otto, a known bully to actors, came up with an intelligent
and exciting thriller. The film scores big because of the great nuanced
performances from the stars Robert Mitchum and Simmons, the sharp black and
white photography contrasting the wealthy estate to Mitchum's humble stature and
rosy dreams, that the tale of obsessive love was credibly presented, and the
typical noir tale of the protagonists getting hooked on sex and money gave the
film the dark energy it thrived on. </P>
<P>Mrs. Tremayne is almost asphyxiated by gas in her bedroom but her novelist
husband, Charles (Marshall), has come in the nick of time to get some air into
her room. She thinks someone wants to kill her for her money. Her husband
married Kathryn after his wife died, and she supports him and his daughter in
her mansion. Ambulance driver Frank Jessup (Mitchum) answers the call to the
Beverly Hills mansion and when he tells the attractive stepdaughter, Diane
(Simmons), that her mother will be fine she only requires a sedative, she gets
hysterical and doesn't seem all that pleased. </P>
<P>The manipulative Diane sets her sights on Frank and works to break up his
relationship with nice-girl nurse Mary (Freeman). Even though she looks angelic,
behind her serene beauty is a need for possessiveness and an unbalanced state of
mind. She manuevers to get Frank hired as the family chauffeur to drive her
expensive sports car and even use it to enter racing events, as the ambitious
Frank is interested in becoming a racing car driver and opening up his own
specialty racing car shop. She talks her stepmother into sponsoring him in that
business, but then lies to him and says her mother is only playing with him. She
fails to tell him there is a delay because her mother's lawyer is out of town.</P>
<P>The lower-class Frank is attracted to her and believes she can help his career,
but doesn't think this romance could work. Threatened by Frank leaving her and
doting on her father's unconditional love that she doesn't want to lose to her
stepmother and her irrational hatred for her stepmother, she rigs the car so
that when her stepmother puts the gear into reverse it goes over the cliff. But
what she didn't figure on, is that her father was also in the car and they both
died. </P>
<P>The law accuses her and Frank of murder, and their case goes to trial. She is
being represented by a top lawyer, Barrett (Ames), who suggests they get married
as he correctly reads the jury's mind and gets an innocent verdict for both of
them. </P>
<P>Warning: spoiler to follow in the next paragraph. </P>
<P>When back in the mansion, Frank realizes Mary won't have him anymore and decides
to get a divorce. He packs for a trip to Mexico. But Diane can't live without
her father and now Frank, and offers him a ride to the bus station by saying she
deserves some time to get him to change his mind; but, the psychologically
crippled woman backs the car off the cliff and they both perish. </P>
