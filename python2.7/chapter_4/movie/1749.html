                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     The United States Civil War has ended and Jack Sommersby (Richard
Gere) is returning home to a farm in ruins and a wife (Jodie Foster)
who wishes he was dead.  It's up to Jack to prove is that he's no
longer the person he was six years ago when he left.  Gone is the man
who gambled and beat his wife, newly replaced by someone of a giving
and caring nature.  Yet even as Jack begins to assemble a new
beginning, questions of identity arise--his identity.  Could Jack
Sommersby change this much, or is this really him at all?</P>
<P>     SOMMERSBY is based on the 1982 French film THE RETURN OF MARTIN 
GUERRE, and is one of those rare remakes that does not tarnish the image
of its inspiration.  While SOMMERSBY owes much to its predecessor, it is
not a direct copy.  There are differences, not only in setting, but in
scripting.  With the exception of a few early scenes lifted almost
directly from MARTIN GUERRE, only the general direction of the movies
remains the same.  As a result of a cleverly-written screenplay,
SOMMERSBY manages to be faithful to the essence of MARTIN GUERRE while
also crafting a story that is different in specifics.  The transition
from 16th Century France to 19th Century America works better than I
had dared hope, and allows a few surprises for those who are familiar
with MARTIN GUERRE.  </P>
<P>     First and foremost, SOMMERSBY is a love story.  Much screen time is
devoted to the relationship between Jack and Laurel.  The movie takes
its time with its characters; there are no sudden epiphanies.  Love,
and its realization, comes slowly, with a look and a touch.  SOMMERSBY
is a perfect example of a film that can be erotic without nudity or
overt sexual displays.</P>
<P>     In many ways, this film goes against the grain of a typical
Hollywood film.  It has a slow, leisurely pace, and is almost (but not
quite--there is one fight scene) devoid of action.  It will be
interesting to see how audiences react to this sort of picture, and
whether the names of Gere and Foster have enough box-office draw to
bring out enough of an audience to trigger what will invariably be a
positive word-of-mouth.</P>
<P>     In SOMMERSBY, Richard Gere gives one of his most energetic
performances in recent years.  After a slew of films through which he
has drifted with little display of emotion or talent, Gere manages to
imbue Jack Sommersby with life.  This isn't the performance of a career,
but it's effective enough to allow us to accept the picture's title
character as a person.</P>
<P>     Jodie Foster outdoes her SILENCE OF THE LAMBS performance, again
showing why she is among today's most sought-after talents.  Foster
plays Laurel with equal parts of strength and believability.  Often in
period pieces such as this, forceful female characters seem
anachronistic.  SOMMERSBY shows that with good scripting and even better
acting, that problem can easily be overcome.</P>
<P>     Technically, SOMMERSBY is a superior production.  Period details
abound and the cinematography is consistently strong, and occasionally
breathtaking.  Virginia is shown to its best advantage.  Composer Danny
Elfman, best known for his BATMAN score, delivers something
refreshingly different for this film.  Occasionally the music is
imperfectly matched to the scene, but the typical Elfman repetition is
absent.  This is his most original work to date.</P>
<P>     SOMMERSBY should equally entertain those who have seen THE RETURN
OF  MARTIN GUERRE and those who have not.  From start to finish, it is a
well-crafted film: part love story, part mystery, and all drama.
Attention has been paid to detail, and the most painful and obvious of
Hollywood's contrivances are nowhere to be found.  With respect to
MARTIN GUERRE, SOMMERSBY is not a "rip-off".  It can legitimately be
viewed as an homage--the spirit of the story remains intact.</P>
