<PRE>                                LITTLE ODESSA
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     LITTLE ODESSA refers to an old Russian Jewish neighborhood in
Brooklyn, New York, along the lines of Little Italy or Chinatown.  There,
everyone speaks Russian, wanders through bleak snow-covered streets,
drinks vodka, wears heavy wool coats ... and most carry guns.  This is the
age of the "organizatsya," the Russian mafia, for whom Joshua (Tim Roth)
is employed as a hit man.</P>
<P>     Joshua, a long-time Little Odessa expatriate, is called back to the
neighborhood to perform a hit on a big shot resident.  When he arrives, he
encounters his worshipful brother Reuben (Edward Furlong), former lover
Alla (Moira Kelly), hateful father Arkady (Maximilian Schell), and dying
mother Irina (Vanessa Redgrave).  Together, the cast creates a highly
dysfunctional family the likes of which you've probably never seen before.</P>
<P>     As Joshua closes in on his target, relations with his father become
more and more strained, as Joshua tries to return home to visit his mother
before she dies.  While Reuben and Alla grow closer to Joshua, so do the
thugs who are out to avenge the man Joshua has murdered.  Ultimately, the
film culminates in a tragic shoot-out that Quentin Tarantino could have
scripted.</P>
<P>     Tarantino is not the man behind this film, however.  LITTLE ODESSA is
the surprising first feature of James Gray, who wrote and directed it. 
Gray is obviously good at scripting action sequences like the finale, but
when it comes to old-fashioned storytelling, he still hasn't arrived.  The
film's opening and long expository sequences set the tone well, but many
scenes don't serve any real purpose, dragging the narrative out instead of
moving the picture forward.  A huge problem for me was that a number of
characters look, dress, and sound the same, making it often impossible to
figure out what's going on and who's involved.</P>
<P>     Thankfully, most of this remedies itself by the end.  The
multi-layered story ties up neatly, and the net result is a generally
satisfying yet heartbreaking finale.  However, the acting is what makes
LITTLE ODESSA watchable.  Roth is perfect as the dark and disturbed hitman
who still loves his mother.  Redgrave as Mom is truly jaw-dropping:  the
veteran actress playing a cancer-ridden matriarch with frightening
realism.  Even Furlong shines, proving he has something left after PET
SEMATARY 2.</P>
<P>     A more polished script would have carried LITTLE ODESSA a lot
farther.  The film's intentions were honorable, and the cast and crew
obviously genuinely wanted the film to succeed.  It unfortunately isn't
the masterpiece they were hoping for, but it is enough to make you
consider vacation spots other than the real Little Odessa.</P>
