<P>_The_Color_of_Paradise_ (PG) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Like his crowdpleasing _Children_of_Heaven_, the latest from Iranian
writer-director Majid Majidi is also a tribute to the spirit and
innocence of a child.  Here, the subject is a smart blind boy named
Mohammed (Mohsen Ramezani, superb), who is unwanted by his heartless
father, Hashem (Hossein Mahjub).  Hashemsees his son not as a person, but
as an impediment on his forthcoming marriage and a burden on his life in
general.</P>
<P>Majidi takes his time to reach the inevitable crisis where Hashem is
confronted by his duties not only as a parent but a human being, but the
time getting there is fairly well-spent.  While he drives home the point
of Mohammed's good nature a bit too hard (I could've done without the
scene where he takes a fallen baby bird and puts it back in its nest),
the sight of the Northern Iran countryside is stunning; thanks to
Mohammad Davoodi's breathtaking photography, it's easy to see the colors
of paradise.  All this is just a prelude to the grabber of a final shot,
a simple image that is haunting in its ambiguity.  Similarly, the entire
film is memorable in its sweet simplicity.</P>
