<PRE>LES MISIRABLES
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with Les Misirables from
the pop-Broadway musical rather than Victor Hugo's original tome.
Adapted several times for the cinema, this latest effort does a superb
job of translating the characters, story, and heart of the novel to the
screen.</P>
<P>Liam Neeson stars as Jean Valjean.  As a young man, Valjean stole some
bread to satisfy his hunger...and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard
labor for his crimes.  Prison hardened him, and on his release he seems
doomed to a life of crime and squalor.  However, an unexpected act of
compassion changes his outlook on life, and he vows to become a better
man.</P>
<P>However, he runs up against one man who doesn't believe in reform.
Inspector Javert (Geoffrey Rush) is an obsessive law abider.  He has no
tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules, even with benign intentions.
He once served as a guard at the labor camp where Valjean served, and
after Valjean breaks his parole, Javert devotes himself to bringing him
to justice.</P>
<P>Two women also get caught up in the struggle.  Fantine (Uma Thurman) is
an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society.  Her daughter,
Cosette (Mimi Newman, and later, Claire Danes), is her life, yet she
cannot afford to raise her.  Instead, Cosette is sent to live with a
cruel foster family which extorts money from Fantine, and forces Cosette
into a life little better than a slave.</P>
<P>Director Bille August manages to create a faithful adaptation of Victor
Hugo's novel, which, though omitting some of the political undertones,
remains true to the overall story and tone of the book.  Hopefully you
won't, as some clueless members of the audience did, wonder where all
the songs went. The movie manages to be completely engrossing without
the Andrew Lloyd Webber flourishes.</P>
<P>The experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout, though
Neeson and Rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles.
Neeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to
do good, but continually haunted by his past.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is also extraordinary.  The only actor who dims in
comparison is Hans Matheson, playing the revolutionary, Marius.  The
film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair, but it is
transitory, and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of
the film.</P>
<P>The novel Les Misirables is, by any account, an epic, both in its scope
and in its length.  While it would be nearly impossible to cram
everything from its pages into a two hour movie, this latest attempt
does an admirable job at the translation.  It, too, is an epic...and one
worth seeing.</P>
