<PRE>The Wedding Singer (1998)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 23 May 1998 for $3 at the Cineplex Odeon Worldwide</P>
<P>Do you remember the first time you heard Kajagoogoo's "Too Shy"? Did you
ever try to solve Rubik's cube?  Did you ever have to explain to your
mother that Boy George was not a girl, no matter how good his makeup and
no matter how womanly his features were? Do you remember when guys with
deliberate stubble and equally deliberate white blazers, thanks to Miami
Vice? Do you have more than one album by A Flock of Seagulls? Do you
remember when albums cost $4.99 on sale? Did anyone in your neighborhood
drive a Gremlin and see a movie with the same title?  "Deadhead sticker on
a Cadillac" mean anything to you? Do you remember your... President
Reagan? </P>
<P>If you answered yes to any of these questions (I answered yes to *all* of
them), you will probably enjoy *The Wedding Singer*. Actually, all the
1980s nostalgia is a red herring, and underneath all the pastel and
two-tone tuxedos and feathered haircuts is a rather endearing little love
story. That Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are endearing is also a nice
surprise. Plus, the movie is hilarious. Sandler is espcially surprising.
It's good to see that he's a bit more than the obligatory movie actor SNL
alumni are expected to become no matter how bad the movie scripts they're
offered are.</P>
<P>Robbie Hart, who sings at weddings every weekend for $60, seems to enjoy
his life despite his lack of income, and his basement apartment in his
sister's house. It bothers his fiancee, who leaves him standing at the
alter at his wedding. Robbie, who is tenderhearted and humorous and adds
to the occasions where he sings, turns sullen. Luckily, the results are
equally humorous, and either way, he gets the attention of Julia
(Barrymore)--a waitress at the catering hall. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, Julia is engaged to a ratfink named Glenn Gulia (Mrs. Julia
Gulia..., yikes), and Robbie is an honorable man.  But this is a romantic
comedy and we all know how it ends. The difference is how they get there.
The nice thing about this movie is that the nostalgia is not completely
overpowering the storyline. The movie's basic dialogue is pretty funny on
its own, free of the 1980s trappings. That Carrie Fischer is one of the
uncredited writers might have a lot to do with this. But, all that
nostalgia is very amusing. References to Moonwalking, someone shooing
J.R., and "time to make the donuts," don't hurt the movie either. The only
thing that puzzles me is that it's a movie about the 1980s that sometimes
looks a lot like the 1970s, which were being made fun of quite heartily
by 1985.</P>
<P>The supporting characters are also amusing. Christine Taylor plays Julia's
cousin, the Madonna wannabe; Alexis Arquette is the Boy George wannabe; 
Ellen Albertini Dow is particularly hilarious as the octogenarian singing
student Robbie tutors for a fee of two meatballs a week. Jon Lovitz makes
a funny appearance as a rival wedding singer; Steve Buscemi has a nice
cameo bookending the movie. There's even a special guest star (Billy
Idol!). </P>
<P>So, go and enjoy the Wedding Singer. You'll laugh, you'll almost cry,
you'll wonder what happened to Spandau Ballet, LPs, and men named Marilyn. </P>
