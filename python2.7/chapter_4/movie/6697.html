                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>(1996) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Hopefully, MICHAEL will be the last nail in the angel-
obsession coffin. In the last couple years we've been overrun with 
the angel theme in the media. "Touched By an Angel," THE 
PREACHER'S WIFE, there was even a TV special where incidences 
of angels helping people in dangerous situations were re-enacted 
by bad actors. I'm still wondering why they didn't just get William 
Shatner to do voiceovers and call it "Rescue 777."</P>
<P>        The religious folk have been talking about how wonderful 
this angel revival is, apparently realizing that there's almost zero 
correlation between movie angels and Biblical angels. Nowhere is 
this polarization more concrete than in Nora Ephron's MICHAEL, 
in which the title character, who the Bible says threw Satan out of 
heaven, smokes, drinks, eats like a pig and beds down with multiple 
women. This kind of behavior isn't justified in any Bible not written 
by Anton LeVay, but I guess John Travolta doesn't care because 
it's not his religion to begin with. If he had to play a boozing, 
promiscuous L. Ron Hubbard, he'd probably feel differently.</P>
<P>        Travolta, of course, plays Michael, a slovenly New Age 
angel who quotes not John and Paul, the disciples, but John and 
Paul, the Beatles, with a love-is-all-you-need message. His mission 
on Earth involves match-making tabloid writers William Hurt and 
Andie MacDowell, who get a letter from an old women in Iowa 
(Jean "Edith Bunker" Stapleton) claiming she has an angel living 
in her house. Hurt, MacDowell, Robert Pastorelli and his cute dog 
cross several states to get the story, which they figure will probably 
win them the tabloid equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize.</P>
<P>        Michael's first appearance in the movie sets the tone for 
everything that follows. He wanders down the stairs, wearing 
nothing but a pair of boxers, his giant dirty wings flapping. 
Cigarette in mouth, he scratches himself, grabs a beer from the 
refrigerator and heads back upstairs. Travolta said in one of his 
myriad television interviews promoting MICHAEL that people who 
don't buy the entrance probably won't buy the rest of the movie. 
He was right; I didn't buy either.</P>
<P>        It's not just the fact that this is one of God's right-hand 
men having premarital sex with Teri Garr, it's also never clear why 
Michael would think the way he does. These movie angels live in 
a perfect heaven with the Creator of the universe Himself, but their 
main goal throughout eternity is to find ways to get back to Earth. 
With Denzel Washington's character in THE PREACHER'S WIFE, 
it made more sense because he was once a human. Michael's an 
archangel, though; he's never lived down here and therefore would 
have no reason to continually want to leave heaven to experience 
the pleasures of a flawed earth.</P>
<P>        One more thing I didn't buy -- this movie assumes the Bible 
is true. Michael says he wrote Psalm 85 and when Stapleton quotes 
from Revelation, he verifies it. But is this the same Bible that makes 
it perfectly clear that God hates sin? Fornication, drunkenness, 
gluttony, those are pillar sins. That God would let this winged angel 
come down from heaven every hundred years or so to do this stuff 
doesn't seem plausible.</P>
<P>        We're probably not supposed to think about the movie's 
theology, though. We're just supposed to sit back and let MICHAEL 
entertain us. Unfortunately, everything about the movie is just as 
muddled as its characterization of angels. The plot is thin and 
predictable. The tabloid writers drive Michael back to Chicago and, 
along the way, he does all sorts of human things and helps Hurt 
and MacDowell fall in love. There aren't very many laughs and the 
drama is forced and laughable.</P>
<P>        Travolta and everyone else do a decent job acting, but 
the fault here lies in the script. This movie was probably sold to the 
studio on the basis of, "Hey, we've got John Travolta as an angel in 
a romantic comedy that's going to open on Christmas Day." None of 
the executives had to read the script to realize the very concept 
would make money, but they should have realized Ephron's mix of 
dark themes and storybook romance would make for a bizarre 
combination. MICHAEL could have used a little divine intervention.</P>
