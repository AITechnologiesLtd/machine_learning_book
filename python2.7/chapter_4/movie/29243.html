<PRE>"I'm Michael Jackson, You're Toto!"</PRE>
<P>Starring Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, Chris Penn, John
Lone, Ziyi Zhang. Directed by Brett Ratner. Rated
PG-13.</P>
<P>I guess it's a credit to Jackie Chan and the general
likeability of the franchise that Rush Hour 2 could
not be ruined even by the nauseating "comedy" of Chris
Tucker. I'm a fan of Jackie Chan in just about any
medium, and this movie lets him not only do his
impressive-as-ever martial arts schtick, but show off
his comic timing as well. It would have worked better
if he was the only name above the title.</P>
<P>The plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline
for stunts and special effects. This time around, the
evil smugglers are led by Ricky Tan (John Lone), who
makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into
the United States (I'm still not sure how you can make
a fortune doing that: is there a place where one can
exchange fake bills for real ones?). The only way to
tell the phony money from the genuine article is to
set it on fire and see what color it burns.</P>
<P>Of course, it's up to Hong Kong Detective Lee (Chan)
and trash-talking LAPD Detective James Carter (Tucker)
to take the bad guys out and the authorities, to the
extent that they even exist, stay out of their way.
Rush Hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that
here it's Carter who gets the two of them into trouble
and Lee who winds up having to get them out.</P>
<P>I guarantee that my rating would have been at least a
half of a grade higher had anyone other than Chris
Tucker been cast as the foil for Jackie Chan. He
refuses to shut up. Not only did his voice feel like a
jackhammer on my head, but his jokes just aren't
funny, a pathetic mixture of sub-par Eddie Murphy
fasttalking blather and wannabe Chris Rock
white-man-black-man jokes that wind up being more
offensive than funny. I realize that in a movie like
this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the
actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates, but
didn't anyone realize how irritating Tucker's
incessant ranting and raving was? If this is all the
comedian has to offer then I don't care to see any
more of his films.</P>
<P>Fortunately, Chan makes for a marvelous straight man,
and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely. It's
not often that one actor can so completely save a
movie, but there is no other name for what he does;
whenever he's on screen, Rush Hour 2 comes to nearly
breathtaking, often hilarious, life. Much of it hinges
on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch Chan
try to be a "player," but who cares? I can think of
few high concepts that are funnier.</P>
<P>The movie ends with outtakes that, as usual, show that
Chan isn't perfect, and that it does, indeed, take him
a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to
look seamless. Chris Tucker botches some lines as
well, and his mistakes are funnier than anything he
says in the whole movie.</P>
<P>A lot of people have pointed out Rush Hour 2 isn't
very different from its predecessor in tone or style.
But I liked the original, and I like the sequel,
though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best
to ruin it. Director Brett Ratner (The Family Man)
keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to
keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable
hit to miss ratio of the jokes (I guess sometimes the
shotgun approach works). It's not great Jackie Chan,
but it's Jackie Chan, and that's enough. </P>
