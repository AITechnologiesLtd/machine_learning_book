TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A.
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>If the current trends of Hollywood filmmaking continue, we
are probably five or six years away from the moment when the
1980s would become the next Golden Age of movie nostalgia.
Although some Hollywood products already use the last decade
as a background for their stories (mostly in ironic way,
like GROSSE POINTE BLANK and ROMY & MICHELLE'S HIGH SCHOOL
REUNION), some time should pass before the good memories of
that era overcome the bad ones. Until that happens, 1980s
would be remembered as the Decade of Greed, when the
revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel,
materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing
that matters. Contemporary movies are good in illustrating
what was bad for the people who had to live in those times.
One of such movies, one that probably brings the essence of
1980s to the screen, is William Friedkin's TO LIVE AND DIE
IN L.A.</P>
<P>The money isn't just the symbolic motive in the film, it is
the major elements of the plot. Rick Masters (Willem Dafoe)
is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to
become one of the best counterfeiters in L.A. Being too
intelligent to fall into police traps, and ruthless enough
to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his
career, Masters managed to elude law for years and became
well- connected. Richard Chance (William L. Petersen) is a
Secret Service agent, adrenaline junkie whose life gets new
meaning after his partner got killed by Masters. However,
his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one
obstacle after another. Finally he sets up a final sting,
but his superiors deny him the necessary money. Being
frustrated, and against the reluctance of his new partner
John Vukovich (Bill Pankow), he decides to get the money by
robbing underworld courier. Their plan backfires with almost
tragic consequences when their target turns out to be
undercover FBI agent, but Chance decides to carry out his
scheme anyway.</P>
<P>Like FRENCH CONNECTION, one of his previous masterpieces,
this Friedkin's movie was inspired by real life. Gerrald
Petievich, author of the novel that later served as basis
for his screenplay, spent many years working as a Secret
Service agent. That turned to be useful for the portrayal of
that law enforcement agency, not much utilised by Hollywood.
Secret Service millieu was also cleverly used in order to
bring the viewer into the Decade of Greed; the beginning
scene where the movie's hero works as a part of presidential
security detail is a nice opportunity to hear Reagan's
speech that could illustrate the political and economical
notions of those times.</P>
<P>Ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is
shared by almost any character in the movie. Willem Dafoe
brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath,
whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn't seem
like affliction in the Reagan years; on the contrary, those
qualities actually makes Masters socially acceptable.
Compared with him, and all the other side characters that
want their "piece of the action", two heroes on the side of
Law seem like losers. Instead of being a classical good guy,
Secret Service agent Richard Chance (portrayed by William
Petersen in his most impressive role so far) is nothing more
than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work
against his better judgement; his sidekick, who should serve
as those "better judgement" is a weakling and sentimental
fool that gets suckered in the end. In such surroundings of
moral decay, the not so happy, yet surprising ending doesn't
seem out of line (although the very last shot leaves too
much questions unanswered).</P>
<P>The dark atmosphere of L.A. - city of glamour and moral
decay - is nicely captured by William Friedkin's directing
skills. The tight and realistic scripts with memorable
characters (portrayed by such capable actors like John
Turturro, Dean Stockwell, Debra Feuer, Darlanne Fleugel and
Steve James) gave opportunity for Friedkin to use another
gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great
car chase. That scene alone, with lot of realism, thrills
and surprise twists, is worth seeing the rest of the film.
The soundtrack, provided by now almost forgotten band "Wang
Chung", is also one of the more memorable of that decade. In
every case, TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. is one of the rare
movies in which Hollywood actually tries to tell some
unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it.</P>
