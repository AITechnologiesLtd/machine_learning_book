<PRE>                          MR. IN-BETWEEN
               (a film review by Mark R. Leeper)</PRE>
<PRE>    CAPSULE: Beautifully filmed, this is perhaps the best 
    English gangster film since THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY.  It is 
    sharp as a stiletto, entirely etched in tones of blue and 
    black.  A hit man gets involved in the lives of an old 
    friend and his wife.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10), low +3 (-4 to +4) </PRE>
<P>This is the best British gangster film since THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY.  
Jon Bennet (played by Andrew Howard) is an extremely good 
assassin.  As such he is probably an evil man but it does not 
worry him.  He has become an unquestioning weapon.  He is in the 
employ of a kingpin (David Calder) far more evil than he is.  But 
even assassins have innocent pasts.  He runs into an old from 
school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school.  
Complicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent 
job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime. </P>
<P>A big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the 
kingpin.  Calder is a familiar actor in Britain, though not 
frequently seen in the US.  He was seen in THE WORLD IS NOT 
ENOUGH.  Here he creates one of the best screen villains in recent 
years.  He is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful 
venomous snake.  His lair is underground, apparently in a sewer, 
where he lives like the king of sewer rats.  It is the kingpin who 
pulls the strings that will control Bennet's life. </P>
<P>Paul Sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a 
cinematographer and like the kingpin's lair, he has molded images 
of class and style out of the darkness.  By using semi-darkness 
and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene 
he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether 
world.  This is a world that is cold and unfriendly. </P>
<P>Sorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than 
what we see.  This is a film with a great deal of physical 
violence occurring just out of reach.  We see very little but we 
hear a great deal more and we imagine more than that. </P>
<P>The screenplay is by Peter Waddington based on the novel by Neil 
Cross, but it is Sarossy's film all the way.  It creates indelible 
images of evil.  I rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +3 
on the -4 to +4 scale.  (I do hope they do not use the tagline 
"Don't mess with Mr. In-between.")</P>
