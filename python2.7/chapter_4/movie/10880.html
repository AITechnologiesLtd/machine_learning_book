<PRE>[film] "Alien Resurrection"
A Postview, copyright 1998 p-m agapow</PRE>
<P>It's 200 years later and they still haven't fixed the poor lighting 
and dripping problems aboard starships.  The tireless alien-hunting 
Ripley awakes on a military research vessel to find that she's not 
dead, just cloned.  But there are some strange fish splashing about in 
her gene pool, and when the (also resurrected) aliens run amok, she 
falls in with a band of amoral pirates and escape while engaging in 
many widely framed metaphors for motherhood and birth.</P>
<P>A fundamental law of Hong Kong movies and Star Trek is that death is 
tragic but only a minor inconvenience.  It looks as though that rule 
will now have to be extended to the Alien franchise, with La Sigourney 
being decanted from a two centuries old blood sample.  But even given 
modern biotechnology, is there any energy in the fun loving hijinks of 
everyone's favourite polymorphic lifeform?  That's a more complex 
question, complicated by the poor reception of its predecessor 
(Alien^3) and the knives being sharpened for an expected failure.</P>
<P>While incompletely realised, "Resurrection" is quite good.  It 
harkens back to the flavour of the first film, a Victorian gothic 
horror novel set in space, a shifty psychological thriller.  (As an SF 
or horror film, the second installment "Aliens" was a good blockbuster 
action picture.)  The characters and story exist in a moral vacuum 
with extra stress contributed by their unknown allegiances.  The 
Ripley clone gives the impression that at any moment she may back the 
alien side, the pirates (who guiltlessly hijack cryofreezed bodies for 
experiments) are motivated by little but self-interest.</P>
<P>French director Jeunet (here bereft of his other half, Caro, from 
"City of Lost Children" and "Delicatessen") brings a worldly European 
air to the Alien franchise, with the occasional surreal touch.  This 
is best exemplified by the choice of actors, from the decidedly 
non-glamourous Ron Perlman as a chauvinist tough guy to the even less 
glamourous Dominique Pinon as a grungy crippled mechanic.  (Both are 
Jeunet and Caro alumni.)  Weaver is fabulous as the Ripley clone, with 
an almost wolfish quality to her.  Tired of other people's mistakes, 
almost too tired to live there's an ineffable dangerousness to her 
character.  Winona Ryder as a guilt-stricken pirate fares less well: 
as the character with the most depth after Ripley her performance is 
not as good as hoped but better than expected.  (It's back to 
generation-X dramas for you, dearie.)  The cast spark off each other 
in some snappy dialogue.  ("Must be a chick thing," sneers Perlman 
after La Sigourney goes bananas with an incinerator.)  Throw in a few 
well-framed action pieces - there's a nice underwater chase scene that 
segues into an equally nice fight on a ladder - and you've got not a 
bad little picture.  The whole motherhood analogy schtick from 
"Aliens" is here revved up to the nth degree, it not being so much a 
subtext as a supertext.  If Ripley ever gets to a shrink, I can see 
the two of them writing books and going onto talk shows for years.  
("On Ricki Lake today: My child surrogate died and then my new child 
surrogate destroyed a military base.  Now make me over!")</P>
<P>But "little" may be the problem.  To convince the sceptics, 
"Resurrection" has got to go the hard yards and make itself stand out.  
Although it wisely doesn't try to outdo the previous entries, it also 
doesn't try to be enough of its own thing.  The evil corporation has 
here been replaced by the evil government.  (Who, hilariously, wish to 
use the aliens for "urban pacification".  Drop one of them aliens onto 
the West Bank and let's see how long it lasts.)  For all the 
quirkiness of the characters, there really isn't enough time for each 
to develop and so several die in that uncomfortable period between 
when you can recognise them but before you know their name.  While 
there are some pleasing intelligent points to the story - "The aliens 
are loose!  Evacuate the ship!" - there are plot stupidities to match 
- "Hey, a hole in the deck made by acid!  I wonder if I stick my head 
down there if it get torn off?".</P>
<P>In summary, it's a pleasing addition to the series that while not 
reaching quite as high as intended, at least manages to hold itself 
with pride.  If there must be another entry, let's hope it continues 
and extends the good work.  [***/interesting] and "A Better Tomorrow 
3" on the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
