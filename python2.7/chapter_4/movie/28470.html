<P>Of all the sins in the world of motion pictures, the most unforgivable
sin is to bore the audience to death.</P>
<P>Which is why TOMB RAIDER is damned to hell.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Based on the best-selling videogame series, TOMB RAIDER stars Angelina
Jolie as Lara Croft, Butt-Kickin' British Archaeologist Babe.</P>
<P>  [insert silly Hollywood plot about how Lara is The Only One who can
   possibly save Earth from the Evil Plan To Rule The Earth And All The
   Other Little Planets by greedy little pissants like Illuminati member
   Manfred Powell (Iain Glen) and Powell's cohort in the person of
   traitorous American archaeologist Alex Marrs (Daniel Craig), using
   only her manservant Hilary (Chris Barrie), TechnoGeek employee Bryce
   (Noah Taylor), The Force carried around by her dead father Lord Croft
   (Jon Voight), and most of all, her handy-dandy Big Guns - oh yeah,
    plus her pistols - here].</P>
<P>The Upshot (WARNING: **DEFINITE spoilers contained below**):
Beyond all the MysticMumboJumbo, beyond Lara's SuperPowers (chief among
them, her PerkyTits), beyond the total lack of character development in
this completely plot-driven movie (Not A Good Thing, when the plot
stinks), there is a question that I kept asking; one similar to the
question Spock had in the similarly-bad STAR TREK 5 when he asked, "why
would God need a starship?"</P>
<P>My question?  Why in the world would someone who had the capacity to
give someone else The Power Of God, do so?  No, really; I need to know.
If you had The Key, the only way to unlock The Mysteries Of The
Universe, something no one else could force from you, because you could
always call a Do Over - would you just say "right; here ya go, mate".
WTF? I mean, WTFF?</P>
<P>Nothing else about this movie mattered to me beyond that question.  It
didn't matter that Patrick Massett and John Zinman wouldn't know a good
story if it fell on its knees and offered them a Lewinsky, or that Simon
West apparently only watched the second, gut-bustingly awful "Indiana
Jones" flick [maybe the much-superior first and third installments
weren't available at Blockbuster that weekend], or that Angelina Jolie's
Humorous Bits were delivered in such a staccato voice, they may as well
have been absent, or that NOT ONE of the supporting characters'
backstories, made the slightest bit of bloody sense (not that their
front stories were any better).  No, none of that mattered, nor did the
admittedly well-executed stuntwork of TOMB RAIDER - all because of that
damnable question.  Or, more to the point, because of its only logical
answer.</P>
<P>Thanks, guys, for trashing another hero of mine, with illogic, bad
plotting, and useless background characters.  Thanks a bleepin lot.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
I'm pissed.  Sorry, but there's no better way to put it.  I'm completely
ripped.  I had anticipated this movie for so long - mostly because I
thought Jolie was absolutely perfect for it.  And this is the thanks I
get?</P>
<P>I'm just glad Hollyweird has no interest in developing a QBert movie.</P>
<P>TOMB RAIDER (rating: flashing redlight):
The upside?  It's pretty much a sure bet that there won't be a "Tomb
Raider 2".  How could there be?  They've already used up their Power Of
God chip; where would one go from there?</P>
