<P>"Scream 2" is kind of an oxymoron in itself: it's a film which looked
good because it mocked sequels, but was also a sequel.  Talk about
hypocrisy.  Now, the first one also had a similar fallacy: believing
that horror movies suck, but hell, it's a horror movie, but it worked
awesomely, and brought back the slasher genre in a cool, hip 90s kinda
way, without getting all alternatively whiny or anything.  "Scream 2"
wishes it were as cool as the original.</P>
<P>"Scream 2" picks up two years after the first one ended, where a killer
(or killers) killed a bunch of teens, but was ultimately stopped.  The
chief survivors of the first film - protagonist Sydney (Neve Campbell),
obsessive journalist Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox, now with admittingly
kinda attractive streaks in her hair), boyish yet lovable Deputy Dewey
(David Arquette, with a punctured nerve from the original, causing him
to limp and hold one arm out like he was Bob Dole), and dorky film geek
guy (not me) Randy (Jamie Kennedy, looking almost too cool with a
goatee) - well, they're all back.  And someone else is too.</P>
<P>Like the first one, we get an elaborate, satirical, and pretty bitching
opening sequence involving two collegiate lovers (Jada Pinkett and Omar
Epps) who attend a preview screening of the movie that was made from the
book that Gale wrote on the first one, "Stab," and are subsequently
murdered individually by a killer dressed in the mask from the first
one, which they're handing out at the door as Rocky Horror-esque
promotional advertisements.  Sure, it's cool as hell, but it's neither
as tense or clever as the first one, and didn't really have my adrenalin
pushing or anything.  Bad omen?</P>
<P>We then get two more hours of sometimes fun/sometimes not whodunit,
sorta/sorta not in the tradition of the first one.  There are some more
characters introduced, as it is two years later, and it's in college
where Randy and Sydney attend (did they do that on purpose...or is Randy
turning into Syd's own Hinkley?).  There's Syd's preppy fratboy
boyfriend, Derek (Jerry O'Connell, remember Joe from "Joe's
Apartment"...and that fat ass from "Stand By Me?"), two more film
students for fun (Tim Olyphant and Sarah Michelle Gellar), Syd's roomate
Hallie (Elsie Neal), an annoying journalist named Debbie Salt (Laurie
Metcalf, the sister from "Roseanne"), a freaked-out cameraman for Gale
who hasn't read her book yet (Duane Martin), among others.</P>
<P>Also back from the first is the man who we saw once or twice, and only
on TV in the first one: Cotton Weary (played by indie fave Liev
Schreiber).  This time, he actually has a whole bunch of lines, as he's
trying to get exposure so people will stop being afraid of him, and get
on with his life (there's a direct cause-and-effect if I ever saw one). 
Anyway, Liev rocks, giving possibly the best performance in the film.</P>
<P>The killings, obviously a result of a copycat, are pretty fun, even if
they are more elaborate.  Of course, Randy does a redo of his "How To
Survive a Horror Film" speech, modifying it slightly for sequels, and
one of is more blood and more elaborateness in general.  I respect that,
but one of the reasons the first one worked was the structure.  The film
was tightly scripted by Kevin Williamson, making it more satirical and
more fun.  It was a guessing game from start to finish.  This time,
there's some guessing, but most of the time I wasn't even caring. 
Probably because the big sequences were too distracting.</P>
<P>Yes, they're great, and I was having fun with a lot of them.  But they
don't really work well with the plot for some reason.  Take for example
a sequence that is brilliantly done but ultimately hurts the structure a
bit: Syd, a drama major, is playing, of all roles, Cassandra, and during
a rehearsal (with full special effects - this is obviously a utopian
college, I mean, the dorm rooms are gigantic), she starts hallucinating
that all the people with masks on are tying to kill her.  With a
brilliant score by Danny Elfman (who sadly only does this one scene),
it's scary, and with cool camerawork, it's effective.  But it's
distracting.  What does it have to do with the plot?  Nothing.  As do
most of them.</P>
<P>I do respect a lot of this film, though.  As I said, the film has some
great sequences (my favorite was the scene in the car - have to see
it...).  And there are some clever ways it makes characters look
suspicious, although not as well.  There are some genuine shocks, some
more character development (the whole Gale/Dewey thing, though never
really explained, is dealt with some more...and god help me if I wanted
them to get together), and some clever lines.</P>
<P>My big problem with reviewing this is the film comes back a lot towards
the end.  Although totally proposterous as to why it takes place where
it does, the ending is great, albeit extremely corny.  But, as a friend
said, how could it NOT be corny.  At least it plays it up for laughs,
and even tosses in some delicious satire.  Including some clever
afterthoughts, playing up the fact that it was contrived (it actually
made me happy), the ending is the most satisfying part of this.  I did
leave with a smile on my face, then I reflected on the film as a whole.</P>
<P>It's pretty much a mess.  With spots that shine here and there, the film
is very much a hills-and-valleys experience.  Sure, I liked the whole
take on sororities (with one of the lead sorority girls played by
Rebecca "I'm the Noxema Girl!" Gayheart), I dug the acting ('cept Laurie
Metcalf's), and even liked the set pieces, but could never really get
into them for some reason.  The original had me at the edge of my seat,
not because of the suspense, but the way it was done, but for some
reason I was left kinda cold by it all.  None of it really excited
me...even the cool ending...or the "I Think I Love You" singing by
Jerry.</P>
<P>Maybe the problem is that it wants to be so much.  It wants to be a
satire on media.  It wants to be a parody AND satire on sequels.  It
wants to clever, hip...I mean, it ends with a Collective Soul tune.  It
wants to have movie allusions (I spotted only a few, though, notably a
"Shining" reference), and it wants it all to be crammed into over two
hours.  The original was simple, yet it worked wonderfully.  I'm not
saying it's not great because it's no "Scream 1;" it wouldn't hold up
well on it's own anyway.  But of course, it's a sequel, damn proud of
it, and it never even works well when held up to the first one.</P>
<P>A special note should be made to the cool movie-within-a-movie, "Stab." 
It's one of the more inspired parts of the film, as it is overly corny,
and filled with heavy media attention.  At the premiere, the companies
send promotional costumes and glowing knives, adding to the cool
satire.  And the funniest part is it stars Heather Graham as Drew,
"Bottle Rocket"'s Luke Wilson as Skeet, and Tori Spelling as Neve (it is
also mentioned that David Schwimmer plays Dewey).  Too bad it isn't
really dealt with in any deeper fashion, as it could have added to the
overall greatness of the film.</P>
<P>"Scream 2" is not a major disappointment; a mere minor one.  It needs
tighter scripting, that's all.  I did laugh, I did jump a couple times,
and I even smiled a lot of the time.  But the overall feeling, once
reflecting on it, is a tad unsatisfied.  Oh well.  We always have
"Scream 3" - already in the making!</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): **1/2</PRE>
