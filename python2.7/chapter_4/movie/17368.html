<P>Todd Solondz is one of America's few truly independent
directors, who doesn't bow to convention or safe formulas.  In his
debut film, Welcome To The Dollhouse, Solondz looked at a
dysfunctional New Jersey family largely through the eyes of the
troubled teenage daughter.  In his disquieting and confronting new
black comedy Happiness, Solondz yet again taps into the lives of a
dysfunctional family from suburban New Jersey and unearths more rich
and fertile material.  Here he also deliberately pushes back the
envelope and tackles some of the few remaining cinematic taboos -
including masturbation and paedophilia - in a brave, frank and
forthright fashion.  Although he is tackling some important themes and
issues, many in the audience will find elements of Happiness
disturbing.</P>
<P>It is a pretty ironic title, as all the characters here are
looking for happiness, but never seem to find it.  Love often ends in
betrayal and hurt and bitterness.  Solondz seems to tap into much that
is wrong with personal relationships and families in the latter part
of the 1990's.  For him, sex is not the answer, it seems to be an
integral part of the problem.  The film concentrates mainly on the
three Jordan sisters, and the narrative follows their interrelated
stories without glossy embellishments or unrealistic or melodramatic
plot devices.</P>
<P>The film unfolds mainly as a series of conversations, which
reveal much about the various characters.  There is a sense of real
pain and anguish lurking just beneath the surface of their seemingly
content and fulfilled lives.  There is an aching loneliness, as they
are all desperately trying to make a connection in a largely uncaring
world.</P>
<P>Trish (Cynthia Stevenson, from Forget Paris, etc) is the
typical suburban housewife, who has no idea that her psychiatrist
husband Bill (Dylan Baker, from Murder One, etc) harbours a secret
lust for young boys.  A seemingly normal family man and father of
three, Bill turns out to be a paedophile who coldly preys on the
vulnerable friends of his 11 year old son.  We watch, appalled yet
morbidly fascinated, as he drugs his own family one night so that he
can take advantage of the young boy who is sleeping over.  While we
never actually see Bill's actions on screen, Solondz still paints a
pretty chilling picture of him as a predator, without remorse or
compunction.  While Adrian Lyne's remake of Lolita is currently
attracting controversy for its depiction of a man's torrid affair with
his 12 year old stepdaughter, Happiness seems to have slipped in under
the guard of the self-appointed and self-important moral watchdogs.</P>
<P>Trish's sister, the self-absorbed and bitchy Helen (Lara Flynn
Boyle, from Twin Peaks, etc) is a best selling author full of self
loathing and pity, who looks down on her two sisters.  She develops a
relationship with an obscene phone caller (Philip Seymour Hoffman,
also appearing opposite Robin Williams in the far more mainstream
comedy Patch Adams), who turns out to be her next door neighbour.
Taking a plunge, she decides to invites him in one evening.  The
meeting unfolds in an uncomfortable, embarrassing silence that is
abruptly ended when she throws him out of her apartment, declaring
that he is not her type.  Helen's other neighbour is Kristina (The
Practice's Camryn Manheim), a lonely and overweight murderess.</P>
<P>The other sister, Joy (Jane Adams, from Kansas City, etc), is
the pitiful, insecure and naive loser who lurches from one hapless and
unsatisfactory encounter to the next, yet remains full of optimism.
Solondz also introduces us to their parents (Ben Gazzara and Louise
Lasser), who live in Florida, but are in the throes of a separation
after forty years of marriage.</P>
<P>Happiness has something of an Altmanesque quality to it, as
Solondz draws together with deceptive ease and skill the disparate
plots and characters.  Solondz draws wonderful and perceptive
performances from his ensemble cast that bring this collection of
colourful losers to life.  Especially good is Baker, who gets under
the skin of his character and manages to make him more sympathetic
than you would expect.</P>
<P>Happiness is, by turns, sardonic, cruel, relentlessly
uncompromising, earthy, funny, poignant, honest, confronting,
compassionate, insightful, uncomfortable, bleak, despairing, and
challenging.  Many may well find it tasteless and shocking.  Solondz
balances his observations about life, love and other bruises with
humour and casual horror.  Some scenes are excruciatingly
uncomfortable to watch.  Happiness is a powerful and provocative film
that cuts close to the bone, yet lingers in the mind long after the
final credits.</P>
