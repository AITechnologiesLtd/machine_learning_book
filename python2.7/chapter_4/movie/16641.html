 Amistad (1997) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Djimon Hounsou, Matthew
McConaughey, Anthony Hopkins and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Steven
Spielberg.</P>
<P> The first scene is an extreme close-up of a man's sweaty face as he
struggles mightily to loosen a bolt.</P>
<P> You neither know who the man is nor the reason for his actions.</P>
<P> In quick succession, the man successfully loosens the bolt, frees himself
from shackles and then frees others, who gather weapons, attack the crew of
the ship on which they are being held and capture the ship after a short,
but bloody, skirmish.</P>
<P> These are the opening images of Amistad, Steven Spielberg's film based on
a little-known event in American history.</P>
<P> The year is 1839 and 53 kidnapped Africans are being transported from Cuba
to begin lives as slaves in America.</P>
<P> After their shipboard revolt, the Africans spare two crew members and
order them to turn the ship east and head back to Africa. During the day,
the sailors steer into the sun, but at night, when their captors sleep, the
sailors turn the ship toward North America.</P>
<P> Eventually, the ship winds up off the coast of Long Island, where a U.S.
naval vessel captures the Africans.</P>
<P> Brought to trial in the United States, the Africans are charged with
murder. However, the situation becomes a political tinderbox as the Spanish
government claims them as property and wants them returned.</P>
<P> The whirlwind that surrounds this event eventually lands at the doorstep
of the U.S. Supreme Court, and involves an incumbent president, Martin Van
Buren, and a former chief executive, John Quincy Adams.</P>
<P> Amistad is an earnest examination of one race's fight for their rights and
their freedom. Led by Cinque (Djimon Hounsou), the Africans are confused
and frightened by the international uproar they have unwittingly created.
Yet, they only want one thing - to go home.</P>
<P> Coming to their defense is a property lawyer, Roger Baldwin (Matthew
McConaughey), whose initial success in winning the Africans their freedom
is sabotaged for political expediency by President Van Buren's minions.</P>
<P> A reluctant and retired Adams (Anthony Hopkins) must then present their
case before the Supreme Court, seven of whose nine justices are
Southerners.</P>
<P> This sounds like rather dry material for movie fare, but Spielberg gives
it a deep emotional core. He makes you care about these uprooted people and
their wretched plight. You do more than pity them - you root and pray for
their success.</P>
<P> The heart of the picture is Cinque. Newcomer Hounsou, a former model whose
previous acting experience includes a Janet Jackson music video, gives a
towering performance.</P>
<P> A man of great strength and dignity, Cinque finds it difficult to grasp
the various complications and ramifications being woven around him and his
fellow Africans. To Cinque, there is only right or wrong, justice and
injustice.</P>
<P> Hounsou learned the Mende dialect of West Africa for his role. And though
he speaks an unfamiliar tongue, Hounsou is able to display Cinque's
courage, as well as his vulnerability.</P>
<P> McConaughey is adequate as Baldwin. Even though his New England accent
comes and goes, he captures the lawyer's passion and fire to do his best
for his clients.</P>
<P> Hopkins, as Adams, buried under old-man makeup, reveals the spark and
righteousness that age could not dim.</P>
<P> Morgan Freeman, however, is given little to do as leader of the
abolitionists who adopt the Africans' cause as their own.</P>
<P> Spielberg's strength, as it was in Schindler's List, is showing the
cruelty one human being can inflict upon another. His recreation of the
Middle Passage, the deadly journey that transported captured Africans from
their homeland across the Atlantic, is as harrowing and horrifying a series
of images as ever put on film.</P>
<P> And, to his credit, Spielberg has not fallen into the trap of other
filmmakers who have told black history from a white person's viewpoint.
Most of the story and much of the action is told and shown through the eyes
of Cinque and his people.</P>
<P> In a film in which the lines between right and wrong, good and evil, seem
defined, Spielberg and screenwriter David Franzoni do not stoop to
stereotypical villains to further their cause.</P>
<P> His antagonists are not villains, per se, but rather flawed men who value
political expediency above morality. They are amoral politicians who feel
they are doing what they must to preserve their country.</P>
<P> Amistad has its slow moments. Overall, though, it is a riveting
examination of a piece of American history ignored in the textbooks. But it
makes a powerful statement about the value of freedom.</P>
