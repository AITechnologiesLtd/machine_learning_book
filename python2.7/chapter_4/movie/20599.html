<P>We've been accustomed to seeing Al Pacino play loud, unruly lawyers so it is
quite refreshing to see Andy Garcia as a smart, tough lawyer in one of his best
roles since "Internal Affairs." The movie may not be great but it is a
well-crafted, watchable piece of entertainment.</P>
<P>Garcia stars as Sean Casey, a tough New York City lawyer who has been trying
minor cases such as freak accidents, drug dealers, petty thieves, etc. He's no
ambulance chaser but he's trying to get ahead by playing the rules, and he was
a former cop so he "knows the streets." His father, Liam Casey (Ian Holm), is
an undercover cop trying to catch a big-time heroin dealer and is subsequently 
shot while on a stakeout. Sean is upset by this and so is the whole city since
two cops were killed by this psycho dealer. The D.A. Morgenstern (Rob Leibman)
screams bloody murder and wants the dealer found who managed to escape in an
NYPD car! The D.A. makes Sean the leading prosecutor, much to everyone's
chagrin, but he's also risking his political future when the defense attorney
turns out to be a brilliant shyster, Sam Vigoda (Richard Dreyfuss). It is,
theoretically, an easy case and one that could launch Sean's career, but is
there police corruption at the core? What do you think? Have you seen movies
about corruption before or is this something entirely new to you? </P>
<P>"Night Falls on Manhattan" is not an original film nor should you think that
director Sidney Lumet hasn't made similar films before. This time, Lumet has
made it fresh by instilling a sense of humanity and making his characters
invigorating and real. Garcia's Sean Stone is the moral center of the film - a
lawyer who uncovers a hotbed of corruption and lies and people who mask the
truth. Could his father, Liam, be concealing evidence? And what about Liam's
partner, Joey (James Gandolfini)? And how did all three precincts manage to
arrive within seconds after Joey calls for backup during the stakeout? If you
haven't heard the disturbing news of New York City cops lately, then you must
be residing on a mountain top in Tibet somewhere. </P>
<P>Lumet's problem as a writer is his frequent lack of credibility. For example:
why would a psychotic dealer turn himself in to a defense attorney when he
could have skipped town? Why would the D.A. assign such a media crazed event
over to a small-time lawyer who has no experience trying such cases? Because
the lawyer's father is a cop who was badly injured? I don't think such cases
occur in New York City but what do I know. This movie was written for the
screen by Lumet and based on a pulp novel by Robert Daley. Maybe that explains
it. </P>
<P>As usual, Lumet's casting is impeccable. Garcia is strong and believable as
Sean, a lawyer who by chance becomes D.A. in a movie full of miraculous
chances. Richard Dreyfuss is superbly witty as the Alan Dershowitz-type who is
trying to reveal the corruption himself. The great British actor Ian Holm is
quietly understated as the wise old cop who may or may not be involved, and
adores his bewildered son and his partner. James Gandolfini, who has appeared
in a slate of mediocre movies, shines brightly and evocatively as Liam's
partner - his scene with Ian Holm and Garcia crackles with energy as he begins
to admit his involvement. This is an actor to watch for in the future. Veteran
actor Rob Leibman shouts and spews with relish in several great scenes as
Morgenstern, the D.A. who is always looking for a fight. The one performance
that doesn't ring true is Lena Olin ("Unbearable Lightness of Being") as Peggy,
a legal assistant to Sam Vigoda. Her frivolous romance with Sean exudes little
charisma or excitement and takes up too much screen time. </P>
<P>"Night Falls on Manhattan" falls short when compared to Lumet's great,
intelligent police movies such as "Prince of the City" and "Serpico."
Nevertheless, it is a fine film and uniformly well acted but it ends with a
silly anticlimax that diminishes the power of the first three-quarters (a
similar problem pervaded Lumet's "Family Business"). Still, how can you resist
a great cast in a generally vivid, exciting picture when we are mostly
bombarded by superfluous hogwash nowadays. Don't resist.</P>
