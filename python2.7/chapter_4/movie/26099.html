Susan Granger's review of "DUETS" (Hollywood Pictures/Disney)</PRE>
<P>   For Oscar-winner Gwyneth Paltrow, making this dark comedy
was obviously a labor of love since it's directed by her real-life
father, Bruce Paltrow (creator of TV's "St. Elsewhere," "The White
Shadow"), who was stricken with throat cancer. Shooting began in
Vancouver only three weeks after he completed radiation therapy. The
story revolves around six unhappy characters hoping to win $5,000 in a
karaoke competition in Omaha, Nebraska. Huey Lewis plays a karaoke
hustler who meets his long-lost daughter, a third-generation Las Vegas
showgirl - that's the too-thin, too flat-chested-to-be-believable as
an innocent showgirl Gwyneth, when they're introduced by her
grandmother (Angie Dickinson in a cameo) at her mother's wake. Paul
Giamatti's a meek, mild-mannered salesman, obsessed with redeeming his
frequent flyer miles, who picks up a hitchhiking escaped convict,
Andre Braugher. And Maria Bello, as a scheming waitress/wannabe rock
star, promises sexual favors to a Cincinnati taxi driver, Scott
Speedman. They're all maudlin misfits who like to sing but, for the
most part, their renditions make you cringe. Gwyneth's not bad
warbling "Bette Davis Eyes," but she's not good either. Written by
John Byrum, this manipulative, ill-fated project has gone through
several incarnations, beginning originally as a starring vehicle for
Gwyneth Paltrow and her then-fiance Brad Pitt. After they split up, it
was revised and, in an unprecedented move, because of its violent
content, Disney shopped "Duets" around to other studios; eventually,
studio executives decided to re-cut it, editing the objectionable
scenes. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Duets" is a
disappointing, discordant 4. This rambling, raucous road trip-to-
redemption saga strikes a distinctly sour note.</P>
