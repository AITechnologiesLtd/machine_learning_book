<P>Neil Labute's writing and directing debut delves deep into the sickest
and most inhumane part of men's psychology, and comes out with an
independent look at the twisted head games that some degrading people
could play, and the real emotional consequences that are regurgitated
upon all involved.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Two third-tier businessmen with a history of negative experiences with
women, decide to turn their 6-week stay at an out-of-town corporate
setting, into an opportunity to play an emotional head game with an
unsuspecting woman employee. They both agree to wine her, dine her and
romanticize her for the period of their stay, up until the day on which
they have to leave, at which time they will both unceremoniously dump
her, and laugh about it for years to come.  </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Interesting, original premise starts off with a slow burn, but
eventually challenges you into watching the screen without a cringe, as
the actors work their thespian chops, and the script gets more
involving as it moves along. I did however find the cinematic style of
this film to be quite distracting, as a lot of shots were taken from
long-view, and felt too symbolic and impractical. I found myself
waiting for the camera to zoom in on the characters, rather than
attempting to listen in closer to their far-away conversations. That
aside, the three main characters had strong showings, with the
character of Chad, as played by Aaron Eckhart, rating the highest as
the bastard with the heart of ice. Eckhart looks like he chewed into
this part like a rabid dog on a bloody bone. </P>
<P>This movie does not have any other side-stories to offer the viewer,
and doesn't even recognize any real secondary characters either. The
film is based solely on these three characters and the dysfunctional
dynamic of their respective relationships. And despite my patience
being tested during the film's initial slow build-up, I did find myself
engrossed enough by the end of the film, to warrant a thumbs up in
regards to character development. Having said that, I did find some of
LaBute's writings manipulative and exaggerated just for the effect on
its audience, but mostly interesting to watch. The conclusion left me
satisfied to a point, but did not wholly resolve all of my
reservations. It also felt a bit set up, and unbelievable in respect to
Chad's destiny. All in all, the acting and the dialogue were good, the
pace very slow, and the premise very original and brave to tackle.
Watch it with your buddies or your loved one, and try to figure out if
you know anyone as disgusting as Chad in your life. If you do...you're
in trouble!!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
In the press kit for this film, director LaBute described the movie
thus, "It's a simple story: boys meet girl, boys crush girl, boys
giggle." He apparently filmed the picture for a little under US$25,000.
Despite playing a deaf woman in this film, actress Stacy Edwards is not
deaf in real life. She was born in Glasgow, Montana, the daughter of an
Air Force officer, and grew up all over the world, from Guam to
Alabama. At 18, she received a scholarship to the Lou Conte Dance
Studio in Chicago and began her performance career as a dancer and
actress. She is married to actor Eddie Bowz, and currently stars as Dr.
Lisa Caterra on TV's "Chicago Hope". 
Originally from Northern California, Aaron Eckhart was a college friend
of director Neil LaBute's at Brigham Young University where he appeared
in several of LaBute's plays.</P>
