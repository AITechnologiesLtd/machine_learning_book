<PRE>                             GUILTY BY SUSPICION
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Perhaps this is the wrong film on the
     right subject.  Irwin Winkler could not go too far wrong
     having DeNiro play a top director whose career is ruined by
     blacklisting, but the film does not go too far right either,
     not having sufficient rage to be engaging.  Rating: +1 (-4 to
     +4).</PRE>
<P>     An artist painting a picture has the option of reproducing exactly what
the eye sees or of distorting reality to reach a deeper truth.  The artist
who just reproduces reality may be little more than a human camera; the
artists whom we consider to be great have known how to distort reality to
show a greater truth.  It is possible to make a film about a subject that is
realistic and at the same time does a disservice by being so realistic.
Irwin Winkler's GUILTY BY SUSPICION, based on his own script, is a very
realistic and at the same time subdued portrait of a blacklisted film
director.  But what is called for is a howl of rage against the government
subversion of the Bill of Rights.  Martin Ritt's THE FRONT, which starred
Woody Allen, does have that release at its climax.  GUILTY BY SUSPICION
whimpers its way up to a modified version of an exchange that actually took
place during the Army-McCarthy Hearings, but it is not nearly as effective
as Allen telling the government to go fuck itself.</P>
<P>     GUILTY BY SUSPICION mixes real Hollywood figures such as Darryl Zanuck
with purely fictional ones and ones who are thinly disguised versions of
real actors like cowboy star Jerry Cooper.  The story begins as one of
Zanuck's best directors, David Merrill (played by Robert DeNiro) returns to
Hollywood in 1951 after having been in Paris for a while.  However,
Hollywood is not the town he remembers.  The House Un-American Activities
Committee and the FBI are conducting a witch-hunt to find Communist
sympathizers in the film industry.  Careers are being destroyed and
marriages broken up by the paranoia and the government pressure.  David sees
the family of a friend destroyed and soon he too is called upon to explain
his attendance at a few meetings of what is now accused of being a Communist
front organization.  He is willing to cooperate until he is required to
start by giving names of involved associates.  For refusing to draw others
into the net, he finds himself blacklisted.  The project he is working on is
canceled and the studio nearly bankrupts him by insisting he return a
$50,000 advance.  What follows is a long and not entirely interesting siege
of unemployment seasoned with FBI harassment.  The film builds to his
eventual hearing with HUAC.</P>
<P>     Winkler spent a fair amount of the budget recreating the early 1950s,
much more than Martin Ritt did, or needed to do, for THE FRONT.  I thought
while watching the film that some of the women's hair styles were
anachronistic, but I could easily be wrong.  The period feel was somehow
just missing, as was the dramatic edge of the film.  DeNiro's character is
weak and indecisive and spending so much time showing him not finding work
just does not grab the audience the way it could.  I give the film a flat +1
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
