<P>Susan Granger: "THOMAS AND THE MAGIC RAILROAD"  (Destination Films)</P>
<P> For almost two decades, Britt Allcroft's imaginative Thomas
the Tank Engine has intrigued youngsters on television and video - and
now Thomas chugs off on a feature-film adventure. The plot is
ridiculously complicated but, basically, Thomas and his friends on the
magic railroad live on the Island of Sodor while humans live in a
happy village called Shining Time. Using sparkling gold-dust that he
sprinkles with his whistle, a miniature man known Mr. Conductor (Alex
Baldwin) travels between the two worlds but he's losing his gold-dust
supply. "My universe is in danger!" he wails, adding: "I think you're
going to help me and Thomas sometime in the story." This sets up an
inter-active premise with the audience that is never fulfilled as the
live-action characters function in an animated world. Instead, we meet
a somber, resourceful 12 year-old (Mara Wilson) who is going to visit
her grumpy grandpa (Peter Fonda), who spends his days tinkering with
Lady, an enchanted steam engine he's hidden in Muffle
Mountain. Mr. Conductor needs to find the long-lost Lady in order to
get more gold-dust. Meanwhile, there's a subplot involving the efforts
of nasty Diesel to relegate Thomas and his shiny cohorts to the
roundhouse, and Mara befriends a local lad (Cody McMains). Curiously,
the trains speak with British accents while the Conductor's slacker
cousin (Michael E. Rodgers) has a Scottish brogue and the other humans
are distinctly American. Alec Baldwin smiles relentlessly, looking
silly, while Peter Fonda seems befuddled. On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, "Thomas and the Magic Railroad" is a stiffly tedious,
awkwardly fragmented 4.  Pre-schoolers - two, three, four year-olds -
may enjoy this fantasy about being "useful," but I suspect anyone
older will be squirming. Wait for the video.</P>
