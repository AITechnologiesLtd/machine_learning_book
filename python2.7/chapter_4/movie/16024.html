<P>The first big disappointment of the holiday season is You've Got Mail (*
½), Nora Ephron's uneven re-pairing of Sleepless in Seattle lovebirds
Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Surprisingly empty and enormously light, Mail is
anchored only by the presence of its two huge stars.</P>
<P>Once past the nifty computer-generated opening of a virtual New York
City, viewers will be introduced to the two main characters.  Ryan is
Kathleen Kelly, an endlessly perky and chipper owner of a small
children's book store.  Hanks plays Joe Fox, the puffy-faced owner of a
huge chain of successful bookstores (a la Barnes and Noble) that is
opening its new outlet around the corner and intends to run Kelly's shop
out of business.  They unknowingly met in a chat room (before the film
starts) and have been communicating via e-mail for months…but neither
knows who their pen-pal really is.</P>
<P>The rest of the story unfolds so predictably unimaginative that it
actually rivals Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit in terms of a sheer lack
of originality.  Essentially a remake of The Shop Around the Corner, the
1946 Jimmy Stewart/Margaret Sullavan classic, Mail plods along at
powerfully sluggish two-hour pace that is about 30 minutes too long for
fare this shallow and slight.  Nobody that has been to the movies in the
past forty years should be entertained by this film or surprised by its
outcome.</P>
<P>Hanks' phoned-in performance is particularly vacant and reminiscent of
Harrison Ford's wooden turn in Sabrina, while Ryan is, as always, a
pleasure to watch.  His charm is turned down to around `3' and hers is
cranked up to about `12'.  Mail will likely draw many comparisons to
Seattle – a film about two love-hungry adults that fall for each other
site unseen.</P>
<P>Why did the studio honchos think that the average American needed to see
a flick so similar that they actually enlisted the same stars?  The
answer is simple – money.  Hanks and Ryan are huge box office draws.
Why?  Because he's the type of guy that men want to be, and she is the
girl that most women secretly wish they were (but will never ever
admit…ever).</P>
<P>Mail also boasts an amazing cast of co-stars – Greg Kinnear, Jean
Stapleton, Dave Chappelle and Dabney Coleman capably handle their roles,
but Steve Zahn and indie-goddess Parker Posey stand out in their smaller
parts.  How does a film pay for this many stars of this magnitude?  The
answer is simple – product placement.  Prepare to have America Online,
Starbucks, Apple and Microsoft products shoved in your face for a full
two hours.</P>
<P>I have a few suggestions for better plots; the most obvious being a more
realistic story of two people who meet on the Internet.  He would be a
400-pound unemployed Star Trek fan pretending to be a successful
businessman, while she would say that she resembles Cindy Crawford but
would actually turn out to be a man.  Oh, yeah, and he would be a serial
killer, too.  The tagline would be `Life Is Like A Box Of Chocolates.'</P>
<P>Other suggestions include You've Got Herpes – a madcap comedy
(presumably starring either Pauly Shore or Charlie Sheen) about a guy
who has a drunken one-time sexual encounter with a girl he meets on the
Internet and wakes up with genital warts and a white, clumpy discharge.
The rest of the film would be a hilarious romp as the Shore/Sheen
character tried to track down the one-night stand, who would also turn
out to be a serial killer.  Tagline – `This Christmas, Pornography Isn't
The Only Thing Brad Flaherty Downloads.'</P>
<P>Or You've Got Cancer – a bittersweet drama, directed by David Lynch,
about a Willy Loman-type travelling salesman who neglects his family and
dies of prostate cancer.  Things take a surreal turn when, one year
after his death, the soul of the salesman is transferred to the toilet
brush in his family's downstairs bathroom.  The brush tries to be a
better father to his two small children, but fails miserably as the
children grow so frightened of him that they develop a psychological
fear of the bathroom and must be hospitalized for severe constipation.
Tragically, when the family returns home from the hospital, they find
the brush hanging from a pipe on the bathroom ceiling.  Then the two
kids would grow up to be serial killers.  Tagline – `Frank Schwartz
Thought His Life Was Bad…Until He Died.'</P>
<P>How about You've Got Conjoined Twin Myslexia – the big-screen debut of
television's South Park centers around the origins of the two-faced
school nurse.  The kids would get to use dirtier words, Cartman's
manhood would be revealed, Stan would be a serial killer and Kenny would
die in every reel.  Tagline – `Give Us Your Money; It's South Park!'</P>
<P>Actually, You've Got anything (except Mail) would have been an
improvement.</P>
<P>You've Got Mail (1:59) is rated PG for some very mild language and some
adult situations.</P>
