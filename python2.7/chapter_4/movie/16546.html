<P>Since the debut of W. Somerset Maugham's "Quartet", filmmakers have often
used the omnibus format of several tales to imbue a single idea or thought.
Such diverse films as the above mentioned title through Vincente Minnelli's
'Story of Three Loves' onto Quenten Tarentino's 'Pulp Fiction' have used
the multi-story approach to enhance their film. Jorge Fons' film adaptation
of Naguib Mahfouz's novel of a small poor neighborhood in Mexico is the
latest film to utilize the technique. And the end results are remarkably
satisfying.
                 "Midaq Alley" uses the multiple story frameworks in a way
to tell the complex stories of several characters. The script by Vicente
Lenero, expertly takes these individual stories, and combines them;
creating a marvelous whole, wherein any event from any of the three tales
could impact on the forth.  The film is actually broken up into four
distinct tales, three of which are introduced with the same game of
dominoes at a local tavern.</P>
<P>           The first tale is entitled 'Rutilio',  wherein we are introduced
to a middle aged man, Rutilio (Ernesto Gomez Cruz); owner of a small bar in
the town. He is a pitifully shallow man, oblivious to the thievery by his
employees, estranged by his wife and family and succumbing to his own
latent homosexuality. Rutilio's son, Chava dreams of running to America to
make his fortune. Relations become violently strained when Chava discovers
his Father having an affair with a younger man (Esteban Soberanes).
Attacking the young man and almost killing him, Chavo is forced to leave
Mexico, fearful of his Father's vengeance.</P>
<P>The second tale, 'Alma' gives us the story of Alma (Selma Hayek), a young
innocent girl in her mid twenties. She is the object of affection of Abel,
a young man who works as a barber in the town. As Alma and Abel date, Alma
is approached by Don Fidel (Claudio Obregón), an elderly businessman in
town; with a proposal of marriage. When Abel joins his friend, Chava (from
the previous tale) on his flight to the U.S., Alma agrees to the marriage
arrangement. But, Don Fidel passes away of a heart attack before the
wedding, leaving Alma ripe for the suave attentions of Jose Luis (Daniel
Giménez Cacho).</P>
<P>The third story, 'Susanita'; introduces us to the matronly landlord of a
small apartment in the  neighborhood. Her sad tale of loneliness and
despair is possibly the most riveting and heartfelt. Margarita Sanz plays
Susanita as a spinster longing for romance, longing for at the very least..
heartbreak. When she accidentally injures Güicho (Luis Felipe Tovar), she
immediately falls in love with the younger man. They marry, but the
marriage is a sham from the beginning as Güicho is only interested in
Susanita's money. The final tale, 'El Regreso' (The Return) ties up all of
the plot threads in a sad and effecting final act.</P>
<P>The film is nicely presented, without any flashy moves or tricks. The
camera work is modest but extremely effective, giving the film a glossy
look that belies its limited resources. The direction by Jorge Fons
concentrates on the performances, and there is not a false note among the
fine group. The standout performance is by Bruno Bichir as the lovelorn
Abel, who deftly shows both the heights of love and the depths of despair.
This is an actor to watch. Selma Hayek is wonderfully innocent as Alma. Her
child-like and playfully naive questioning of sex, to her final
transformation to a spiritually bankrupt call girl is quite possibly the
best performance of her career to date.</P>
<P>The most remarkable aspect of 'Midaq Alley' is that the film makes you love
and care for these diverse and desperate people. All of the inhabitants of
the neighborhood dream grand dreams, but all of them soon realize that the
dreams are well beyond their reach. Forgiveness is something that only God
can aspire to. It is only at the denouement, where Alma tries to save Abel
from himself that true forgiveness is granted. But to what end, the
filmmakers will not tell us. It is a wonderful morality tale of how life
circles and recreates itself.</P>
<P>                  "MIDAQ ALLEY" is a fine film, told from a point of view
that neither vindicates nor abdicates it's character's actions. These are
people we have all known, people we have all loved, people we have all
hated. In other words.. they are us.</P>
