<P>Plot: In the year 2036 Todd is a solider who has been programmed from 
birth as an emotionless killing machine. But then the ruthless Colonel 
Mekum introduces a new and superior breed of genetically-engineered 
soldier designed to replace the other soldiers. Todd is defeated up 
against Mekum's top soldier, Caine 607, and, left for dead, is dumped on 
the garbage world of Arcadia 234. But Todd there survives and is granted 
refuge by a group of survivors from a crashed spaceship who have built 
their own peaceful community. However his emotionless and violent 
reactions have him barred from the community. But as Mekum's forces move 
in and start exterminating the community, perceiving it as a military 
threat, Todd becomes their unexpected saviour.</P>
<P>'Soldier' came with enormous promise - there were many that hailed it as 
a film that had the potential to become a genre landmark. It had a 
script from David Webb Peoples who had written such genre classics as 
'Blade Runner' (1982) and 'Twelve Monkeys' (1995), as well as having won 
a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for the stunning anti-Western 
'Unforgiven' (1992). The advance word on the film was good - Kurt 
Russell was so enamoured with the script that he changed his schedule on 
other films so that he could star. And one can see much has been placed 
into the production - the film is clearly made on an A-budget.</P>
<P>Which all adds up to make 'Soldier' seem even more of a disappointment. 
What held the potential to be a landmark genre film turns out a 
surprisingly ordinary variant on the cliched humanization of the inhuman 
soldier/android theme tried and familiar from the likes of Harlan 
Ellison's script for 'The Outer Limits' (1963) also entitled 'Soldier' 
and films like 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' (1991), 'Universal Solider' 
(1992) and 'Solo' (1996). Indeed the story arc that 'Soldier' carves is 
so identical to 'Solo' - programmed soldier/android gets free from 
military control, discovers a human side amid a group of simple but 
honest villagers and stands up in armed conflict against his military 
programmers and, at the climax, in hand-to-hand combat with his intended 
successor - that one is tempted to cry plagiarism. There are also times 
where it is just shabbily written - Jason Isaacs' colonel is 
single-dimensional and cliched, we never get to learn what drives his 
ruthlessness, and his decision to cleanse the garbage world is very 
poorly motivated.</P>
<P>The film proves a competent-enough run through of all the cliches and 
had it been made on a much smaller, more intimate scale one suspects it 
might have been a considerably more likeable film. It's just on the 
A-budget it is made on, its cliches collapse into over-inflated 
pretension. The scenes among the people on the garbage world are so 
pumped up with patently artificial emotive cues - the honest and earnest 
simplicity of the communal lifestyle, ragged but plaintive orphans, the 
woman shot in warm and sensual silhouettes, even for God's sake the 
pseudo-Celtic wailings of Loreena McKennit on the soundtrack - that it 
collapses into a forcedness that verges on the absurd. It all mounts to 
an efficiently large scale but unmemorable action climax. Director Paul 
Anderson (no relation to 'Boogie Nights' director Paul Thomas Anderson) 
is clearly shaping up as a regular genre contributor - he debuted with 
the unpretentiously enjoyable 'Mortal Kombat' in 1995 and made 1997's 
'Event Horizon', where his directorial style triumphed despite one of 
the most brainless scripts of any sf film in recent years. But, as 
'Event Horizon' and this show, Anderson has a good deal of talent but 
clearly little discernment when it comes to scripts.</P>
<P>The film is almost saved by Kurt Russell's performance. Or more 
ironically and accurately, his lack of a performance. The very blankness 
of Russell's battle-scarred face, the subtly-made up sunkenness of his 
eyes, the blank minimalism of the dialogue he gets, creates a character 
that fascinates in its hollowness. All the emotion comes to be in the 
smallest movements of the eyes.</P>
