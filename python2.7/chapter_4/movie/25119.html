editors: Jolanda Benvenuti/Laurent Quaglio; cast: Carlos de Carvalho,
Toni Ucci, Flora Carabella, 1978-Italy)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Roberto Rossellini's attempt at telling the Christ story. This is the
last film made by the celebrated Italian neorealist. It was made for
Italian TV and was completed in 1975 (Rossellini died in 1977). "The
Messiah" did not surface in the States until this year, as it was
released on video, and it still remains one of his least known films.
This is not a good swan song for him to go out on. It was an unbearably
dull and simplistic film: poorly acted and with a vile and inaccurate
depiction of Jews, the scenery consisted of gaudy TV stage sets, and
there was just no emotion drawn from the story. It was so badly done,
that it seemed like all the figures were wooden. It therefore doesn't
surprise me that this film was rarely seen, even in Europe, the
producers were probably happy to bury it.</P>
<P>Rossellini has had a checkered past in films due to his changing
politics and controversial lifestyle. He comes from a wealthy family,
his father was an architect.  Rossellini showed his love for film as an
amateur by making short subject films. In 1938, he was recruited by the
Fascist regime to make films, and started out as a collaborator on the
script of Luciano Serra Pilota (38). This was strictly a propaganda film
and Il Duce's son was the film's supervisor. He made a few more
Fascist-commissioned films and in 1943 he shot Desiderio, which was a
precursor of his trademarked neorealist style to come later.</P>
<P>In the postwar years, Rossellini caught the attention of the
intellectual crowd because of his neorealist style and became one of
their favorites, causing him to have a large international following.
His WW11-theme trilogy captured the fancy of the public and the
neorealism movement. He made Open City (45), Paisan (46), and Germany
Year Zero (47). He gradually moved away from the neorealism movement and
by the early '50s "The Ingrid Bergman" period developed. The
Swedish-born actress was a successful Hollywood star who wrote him a fan
letter and suggested they work together on a film. In 1950, they married
amid a public scandal. They both left their spouses and lived as lovers
before their divorces could come through. For that, the couple were
constantly scandalized by the print media.</P>
<P>Because the public reacted poorly to their private lives, both film
careers suffered greatly.
Together they made Stromboli (49), a film that I liked very much and
thought it was underrated. He also made Strangers in 1953, which might
be the best film he made during this period. By 1957, Rossellini fell in
love with Indian screenwriter Somali Das Gupta, whose pregnancy led to
his separation and divorce from Ingrid. He had a rough few years from
the movie public, who stayed away from his films and booed him at the
Moscow film festival. In 1959, he started his way back in the public's
favor with General Della Rovere. By the 1960s, he was doing many TV
movies, culminating in this one.</P>
<P>The first mistake Rossellini made in "The Messiah," was that he went
back to the time of the first Hebrew king, Saul, and tried to tell in an
anecdotal form the history of eleven centuries, leading up to the empty
tomb of Christ after the crucifixion. He chose for himself an impossible
task and proved that he was only haphazzardly able to cover such complex
themes; such as, why a king was such a terrible concept as conceived by
the Hebrews, how the Hebrew tribes fought amongst themselves, the John
the Baptist story, and finally his emphasis on Jesus's own people, the
Pharisees, delivering him to the Romans to be killed. The Romans are
made to seem like benign rulers, only too glad to please the Jews and
grant them their wish. The cruelty of the Romans was never even hinted
at. Rossellini also took the religion out of Jesus and made the rabbi
seem as if he was merely a moralist, who was more a humanitarian and a
Mr. Nice Guy than anything else. I found this a difficult film to find
anything in it that was praiseworthy. The director was trying to go back
to film in his neorealism style, but couldn't even come close to
duplicating the passionate films he is best remembered for. This film is
only for those who feel compelled to see all of Rossellini's films from
1936-1978, the good, the bad, and the ugly.</P>
