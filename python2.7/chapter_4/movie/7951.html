<PRE>                            MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4 = OK)
1996, PG-13, 110 minutes [1 hour, 50 minutes]
[thriller/action]
starring: Tom Cruise (Ethan Hunt), Jon Voight (Jim Phelps), Emmanuelle Beart
(Claire), Henry Czerny (Kittridge), written by  David Koepp, Robert Towne,
Steven Zaillian, produced by Tom Cruise, Paula Wagner, directed by Brian De
Palma, based on the television series created by Bruce Geller.</P>
<P>In Hollywood, the way to make an audience think a movie is well crafted and
full of detail is to make the plot very confusing but the individual events
interesting. "Mission: Impossible" is probably the epitome of this type of
mindset, as it follows it to the letter. Some of the scenes and events are
pretty interesting, but from beginning to end it's nearly impossible to
follow as a whole.</P>
<P>Although the movie is based on the television series of the same name, it
bears little, if any, resemblance to its inspiration. It starts off in the
spirit of the series by showing a team of super sneaks and computer hackers
trying to sabotage a foreign embassy banquet. There is Tom Cruise as Ethan
Hunt, the fearless agent who plunges deep into "enemy" territory under a
perfect disguise. There is Jon Voight as Jim Phelps, the wise old leader who
coordinates the team via super advanced technology. And there are also two
women (Emmanuelle Beart and Kristen Scott-Thomas) undercover, along with the
wiseass hacker (played by Emilio Estevez in an uncredited role). </P>
<P>At first their teamwork seems to have a lot of potential to it; the
chemistry between the characters more than makes up for the loopy plot. It's
interesting to watch them use such fantastic technology, such as micro
cameras inside their glasses, and lots of computer hacking. The story doesn't
seem like something to take seriously, and it even could have been a good
satire like James Cameron's "True Lies." Unfortunately, something terrible
goes wrong and all the team members start getting killed, except for heroic
Ethan Hunt of course. And just as all these bad things start happening to the
characters, the same thing happens to the movie.</P>
<P>Ethan escapes and makes it back to the group's makeshift headquarters and
from here on the film has a huge snowballing effect with conspiracies,
espionage, computer crime, money laundering, and any government-related,
white collar crime you can think of. There are the token scenes as Ethan
starts to put clues together and realizes things that were under his nose all
along. Scenes like these can have a  chilling effect when done properly (a la
"Sneakers"), but it doesn't occur here because the story is too hard to
follow. For example, Ethan's mission was called "Job 314," and when he sees a
Bible, he realizes it's a code for the book of Job, chapter three, verse 14.
He even figures out someone's e-mail address from this quote!</P>
<P>You have to give this movie credit, it knows it's confusing, but at least it
throws in a lot of individual, [supposedly] suspenseful scenes. One such
incident involves the breaking into CIA headquarters with sensors so
sensitive alarms will go off even if a drop of sweat hits the floor. Break-in
scenes like this all always the same - the heroes barely accomplish their
mission by doing tasks at the last possible nanosecond and just when they
think they're in the clear, an accident happens and we get a terrific battle
and/or escape scene. </P>
<P>The ending is an action/adventure extravaganza; the enemy turns out to be
the person you'd least expect with a lot of double crosses and tricks. Tom
Cruise peels off a mask to reveal his face so many times, it's difficult to
tell if his character is the same person in every scene. There is a scene
with fantastic stunts and special effects with a helicopter chasing a train
through a tunnel... if you've seen the highlights you know where this is
going (not to mention the whole movie for that matter).</P>
<P>I don't know why "Mission: Impossible" was made the way it was. You would
think the filmmakers would realize how confusing it is and try to clear up
the story a little, but they probably just assumed the whole reason to make
it and to watch it is for the special effects and the neat gadgets. Yes,
these elements are well done, but what good will they do if we have no idea
what's going on? </P>
