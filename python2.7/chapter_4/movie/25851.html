<PRE>THE CREW
--------</PRE>
<P>Now that we've had our of fill of mob shrink comedies, it's time to movie
on to the senior set in "The Crew."  Narrator Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard
Dreyfuss, Casey Siemaszko in flashbacks) fills us in on his and his mob
buddies' pasts and present.  Joey "Bats" Pistella (Burt Reynolds) is the 
muscle of the group with a hair trigger temper that's just cost him his
job at Burger King.  Mike "The Brick" Donatelli (Dan Hedaya) is the sweet
but dim one who loves his new profession as a corpse cosmetician.  Tony
"Mouth" Donato (Seymour Cassel) is the ladies man who doesn't say much, but
still wows them on the dance floor where he makes his living as an instructor.</P>
<P>Bobby himself was the brains and leader of the group and is responsible for
leading them all to retirement in South Beach.  Bobby lost his wife and
small daughter Olivia over his mob ties and had heard that they had moved
here.  Now the foursome need to cook up a plan to save their homestead -
the ramshackle Raj Mahal retirement hotel is in danger of being converted
into pricey condos.</P>
<P>They fake a mob hit in the lobby with one of Brick's clients to drive away
potential business and it works!  The landlord even decreases their rent to
get them to stay.  But things quickly get messy.  The corpse turns out to
be the father of a notorious drug lord (Miguel Sandoval).  Mouth blabs all to
stripper Ferris (Jennifer Tilly) who blackmails them into putting a hit on
her mother-in-law Pepper Lowenstein (Lainie Kazan).  The detective on the
case turns out to be Bobby's long lost daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss, "The
Matrix").  Comedic capering ensues.</P>
<P>The screenplay by "Golden Girls" writer Barry Fanaro is just too loud,
messy, overly ambitious and overly reliant on coincidence.  This type of
senior crime caper was handled far better over twenty years ago in "Going 
in Style."  There's so much plot you begin to lose the sense of why
certain things are happening.  A subplot that has corrupt cop Steve
(Jeremy Piven) trying to win back Olivia is totally superfluous (as if
having Bobby's daughter turn out to be the law wasn't hackneyed enough).</P>
<P>The cast can't be faulted, however.  The four leads are all
endearing, particularly Hedaya's Brick who keeps in homey touch with mob
guys all over the country via Christmas cards ('What are you - the yearbook
editor?' barks Bobby after Brick updates them on former colleagues).
Lainie Kazan is amusing as a hostage who turns happy when her abductors
discover she's the owner of the deli they frequent.</P>
<P>The film tries to be a little different with a couple of slick editting
moves (a morgue drawer is closed and segued to a file cabinet being opened) 
and a comedy bit right out of "Mouse Hunt," but the techniques are used
a couple of times then dropped, making the film stylistically muddled.</P>
<P>"The Crew" is an OK piece of fluff to kill an hour and a half, but on the
whole, the film lets down its talent.</P>
