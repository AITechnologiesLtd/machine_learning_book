<P>WING COMMANDER
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: no stars (out of ****)
20th Century Fox / 1:40 / 1999 / PG-13 (language, violence, sexual 
wisecracks)
Cast: Freddie Prinze Jr.; Saffron Burrows; Matthew Lillard; Tcheky 
Karyo; Jurgen Prochnow; David Suchet; David Warner; Ginny Holden 
Director: Chris Roberts 
Screenplay: Kevin Droney<HR>When the mediums in question are video game and feature film, has there 
ever been a respective here-to-there transformation that achieved any 
ground higher than noodle-headed mediocrity? "Super Mario Bros.," 
"Street Fighter" and "Mortal Kombat" were silly stinkers all, and now 
the empty, execrable "Wing Commander" joins their lowly ranks. Enduring 
this spectacularly bad bit of sci-fi, easily the worst of its kind, is 
like watching someone futz around with a video game for 100 minutes - 
that is to say, there's little fun to be had when you're not the one 
holding the joystick. </P>
<P>The movie, then, is a missed opportunity for director Chris Roberts, who 
created the original, groundbreaking PC incarnation of "Wing Commander" 
back in 1990. How an interactive brainchild so revered could end up such 
a cinematic pile of junk under the helm of the same guy is a 
head-scratcher. "Wing Commander"'s story, credited to Roberts and 
screenwriter Kevin Droney, is clueless chaos melding incoherent 
narrative and unoriginal ideas. It rips off the finest films of its 
genre, Top Gun and, in one scene, even those spiffy "stereoscopic 
freeze" Gap commercials. </P>
<P>Set in 2654, "Wing Commander" stars Freddie Prinze Jr. as a daredevil 
cosmos cowboy who hopes to be a great fighter pilot like his father 
before him. Along the way, he plays kissy-face with his stoic superior 
(Saffron Burrows) at the new galaxy hangout where he's posted, comes to 
terms with bigots who resent him for his "Pilgrim" heritage (don't ask), 
and goes on a top-secret mission involving the "jump coordinates" (what, 
no Death Star plans?) of a nasty alien race known as the Kilrathi. Or 
something like that. Given the immensely confusing activity, it's hard 
to tell. </P>
<P>On the other hand, what's easy to see is that "Wing Commander" is a big 
old mess. The lame dialogue strains, filled with such original lines as 
"Don't you die on me!", "Battle stations!" and repeated (and frequently 
unanswered) calls for a "Medic!" Action sequences fizzle. The character 
conflict garners unintentional giggles. The sole source of suspense here 
is what these Kilrathi creeps look like, as they're kept out of view 
until the concluding 15 minutes. Imagine bearded Siamese cats crossed 
with something from a ‘50s Roger Corman cheapie and you've got a good 
idea. </P>
<P>Little but techno-babble happens for an hour, and then it's as if "Wing 
Commander" tries to do too much at once; when it appears as though the 
movie's about to show signs of a pulse, it instead provides a hilarious 
touch of human drama culminating with a use for a bulldozer that has 
probably never been seen in this kind of space camp before. Matthew 
Lillard, featured prominently in said sequence, is cast as Prinze's 
hotshot partner, and though the two are fine young actors - recently 
paired in the hit "She's All That" - they're fighting more than 
otherworldly evil here. </P>
<P>Rumor has it that "Wing Commander" was slated as a later-in-the-year 
release, bumped up to capitalize off this hot casting coup as well as 
the premiere of the new "Star Wars: Episode I" trailer. But in my 
audience, there were no females present to make goo-goo eyes at Prinze 
or Lillard, and many a member exited after the much-ballyhooed sneak 
peek. Since most cineplexes won't be granting refunds to the latter 
contingency, "Commander" might rake in some dough, but be warned: The 
high wears off as soon as the coming attraction gives way to the feature 
presentation.<HR>© 1999 Jamie Peck
