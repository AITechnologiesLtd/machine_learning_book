<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>I'll be the first to admit that I know precious little about the whole
Pokémon phenomenon that has captured the attention of our nation's
littlest ADD sufferers.  I know the translation of Pokémon is `pocket
monsters,' which sounds like something you would hear in a seventh grade
boys locker room, or possibly as a feature at your local porno theater.
I know that the television show gave a bunch of Japanese kids seizures.
And I know that I was secretly thrilled when it debuted here, just
because I thought the seizures might lead to a `thinning of the herd.'
You know, a good way to test that whole survival-of-the-fittest thing.</P>
<P>Now that I've seen ninety-five minutes of Pokémon, I know a few more
things.  I know that they resemble a chew toy that you would buy for a
dog – if you really hated your dog.  I know that the most popular
Pokémon is Pikachu, a yellow thing that looks a bit like Ernie's rubber
ducky.  I know that Pokémon are kept in Pokéballs until they are
instructed by their masters to come out and fight another master's
Pokémon.  And I know that once, in a billiard hall, I experienced
something very similar to Pokéballs, when I walked into a horizontal
pool cue.</P>
<P>The theatrical version of Pokémon begins with a twenty-minute short
called Pikachu's Vacation.  In the short we meet several of the chew
toys as they take a trip to what appears to be a Pokémon theme park.
Pikachu is responsible for a baby Egg Pokémon while he holidays with his
friends the Turtle Pokémon and the Duck Pokémon.  At the end, prepare to
be amazed when the Lonely Pokémon, who ordinarily only cares for itself,
helps to rescue the trapped Dragon Pokémon.  The short is mostly
composed of these horrible bumpers that are supposed to serve as
transitions between the scenes.  There's nowhere to go but up once the
feature starts.</P>
<P>In the feature, which is called Mewtwo Strikes Back, scientists have
replicated a Pokémon named Mew, which was apparently the Babe Ruth of
Pokémon.  The clone, called Mewtwo, is upset that it is an experiment
and goes Carrie on its creators.  Mew also hates all Pokémon masters
because it sees the relationship between them and the Pokémon as more
owner/slave, thinking that the humans and the chew toys should not and
could not be friends.</P>
<P>Mewtwo falsely leads the world's best Pokémon masters to a Pokemon
convention at Pokemon Center, inviting the protagonist, a young Pokémon
master named Ash.  He's the kid who owns Pikachu and his little chew toy
friends.  There is a big battle and everything works out.  Then I went
home.</P>
