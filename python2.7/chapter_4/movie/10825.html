<P>     It's Wednesday, March 27, and a murder investigation is underway in 
Charlotte, South Carolina.  The crime:  a young prostitute, Elizabeth 
(Renee Zellweger), has been brutally slain.  One half of her severed 
body was found in a bag at the train station.  The other half was 
discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority, miles away.  The police 
duo of Braxton (Chris Penn) and Kennesaw (Michael Rooker) are strapped 
for leads.  At the moment, they have only one possible suspect:  Wayland 
(Tim Roth), a wealthy, unemployed genius who graduated Summa Cum Laude 
from Princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit 
such a heinous act.</P>
<P>     That's the premise for DECEIVER, a new thriller from the Pate 
Brothers, Jonas and Josh, who made their mark on the film world two 
years ago at Sundance with the movie THE GRAVE.  DECEIVER plays out like 
a mind game between the intellectually superior Wayland and the two not-
so-bright cops (captions early in the proceedings let us know that 
Wayland's IQ is 151; by contrast, Kennesaw's is 122 and Braxton's is 
102).  The setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector 
test is about to be administered.  Over three days, as Wayland returns 
to answer more questions, the drama and tension among these three 
characters gradually escalates until, inevitably, it boils over.</P>
<P>     Other plot elements are thrown in for good measure.  Wayland 
suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can, in stressful 
situations, render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent.  
Braxton, a compulsive gambler, is deep in debt to a local syndicate.  
And Kennesaw is haunted by a dark, abusive side that delights in 
terrorizing women, especially his wife (Rosanna Arquette), whom he 
suspects of being unfaithful.  The foibles and failings of these three 
are brought into the open as the mystery around Elizabeth's death 
deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand:  the suspect or 
his questioners.  </P>
<P>     DECEIVER, which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves 
a lot of smart dialogue, has the feel of a David Mamet play:  edgy, 
claustrophobic, and tense.  The atmosphere is explosive, and some of 
pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting.  DECEIVER has the power 
to grab an audience.  Unfortunately, in the end, it succumbs to the need 
to throw in one last, unexpected twist, and this is its undoing.  For, 
while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers, it also stretches 
our credulity too much, and raises more questions than it answers.  It's 
only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its 
full implications.  Of course, the film as a whole plays fast and loose 
with reality and logic.  Police procedure is totally ignored and it's 
almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or 
could proceed in this manner.  But the real focus in DECEIVER is on 
character interaction, not plot details.  </P>
<P>     DECEIVER only occasionally gets out of the police station, and 
those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the 
prostitute.  The Pates employ a number of interesting techniques to 
present vignettes from Elizabeth's final days and hours.  The most 
intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining 
the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really 
happened.  Moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as 
gimmicks.</P>
<P>     The movie, obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir, 
drips atmosphere.  There are some fascinating stylistic touches; for 
example, although the setting is contemporary, all of the telephones are 
old-fashioned, rotary models.  Cinematographer Bill Butler is given an 
opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up DECEIVER's 
look.  Some of the things he tries (mostly those that involve the 
contrast between light and shadow) work exceptionally well, while others 
(like any of several Lazy Susan shots) seem more like unnecessary visual 
tricks.</P>
<P>     As Wayland, Tim Roth gives the film's top performance, despite 
occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting.  Roth 
makes us believe that Wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as 
he's supposed to be.  The other two leads, Chris Penn and Michael 
Rooker, aren't as effective.  Both play their characters like familiar 
types.  Penn's performance is uninspired; Rooker's lacks subtlety.  Some 
of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors.  Renee 
Zellweger, in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in 
JERRY MAGUIRE, brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part 
that could easily have become a caricature.  Rosanna Arquette is solid 
as Kennesaw's wife, and Michael Parks delivers several wonderful scenes 
as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating Wayland's condition.</P>
<P>     One of the best things about DECEIVER is that it never talks down 
to the audience.  Plot points aren't hammered home, and, although the 
ending has its weaknesses, everything isn't spelled out in bold letters.  
The Pates give audience members credit for having brains, which is an 
increasingly rare characteristic for film makers.  Occasionally gripping 
and never uninteresting, DECEIVER is a fine noir effort.</P>
