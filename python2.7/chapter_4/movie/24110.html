<PRE>THE GIRL NEXT DOOR
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>"I never had anything I was good at," says Stacy Valentine about her 
growing up. Everyone wants to be good at something. It's human nature. 
Eventually, Stacy, the fascinating subject of Christine Fugate's THE 
GIRL NEXT DOOR, did find something at which she excelled. It's an 
activity practiced with pleasure by most of the world's adult population 
-- sex. </P>
<P>But, unlike most of us, Stacy found a way to make a living at it. She is 
what is euphemistically called "in the business," specifically, "in the 
adult entertainment industry." She makes a living starring in videos 
that people, mainly men, watch in the comfort of their homes.</P>
<P>As soon as most people hear the subject of the story, which Fugate 
carefully filmed herself over a two-year period, their minds are already 
closed. Most viewers are ready for a documentary that will ridicule 
Stacy, or at the very least, patronize and marginalize her. Americans 
stand foursquare behind their movies' right to splatter people's brains 
all over the ceiling, awarding stars, like Bruce Willis, millions of 
dollars to do exactly that. But, sex is another matter entirely. Porn 
stars are routinely detested by the media and the public.</P>
<P>The most shocking part of the documentary is how Stacy really does seem 
like the innocent girl next door. As Producer Adam Berns, who was at our 
screening, so aptly put it, "she is basically a very normal person. She 
isn't a whack job." </P>
<P>Good documentaries make you think, and this got me to thinking about the 
parallels with another movie, WITHOUT LIMITS, based on the life of the 
famous runner Steve Prefontaine. One of the most gruesome parts of that 
movie was when we see him pushing himself so hard in the service of his 
sport that he turns his feet into bloody pieces of raw meat. He knew a 
runner's career is short so he always pushed himself to a limit way past 
what most people would be willing to endure.</P>
<P>So it is with Stacy. As we see in some hard-to-watch footage, Stacy has 
surgery after surgery to mold her body into her ever-changing version of 
perfection. Her breasts, lips, thighs, hips, you name it, are put under 
the surgical scalpel and suction device. Berns says that Stacy, who 
loves watching herself on screen, cannot stomach these scenes and has 
vowed never to have such plastic surgery again. Like a runner, the life 
of a porn star doesn't last long so Stacy pushes herself in ways most 
people would never consider. Then again, traditional Hollywood stars 
have been known to invest quite a bit in such reconstructive surgery.</P>
<P>The movie, however, isn't some dry compendium of talking heads followed 
by carefully covered porn scenes. This sexually explicit, but not 
graphic, movie is extremely funny, thanks to the Fugate's approach and 
choice of subjects. Stacy's mother and stepfather, for example, who 
support her career but have never seen her videos, are a comedy duo, as 
they talk about their daughter and about themselves.</P>
<P>We find that the carefully controlled filming of pornographic movies is 
not without hilarious incidents. One producer has a man with a back-up 
organ in case the organ of the male lead fails. When the male lead 
disappears, she is left with nothing to film. Her backup doesn't have a 
suitable body, just an organ. In another scene we hear how the director 
has the male lead count off, "one-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, etc." so 
that his orgasm is precisely timed. And the director barks out orders to 
his camera operators about keeping everything in focus, as the stars are 
faking great passion.</P>
<P>Stacy's arc in the film has a certain predictability. At first she 
genuinely believes that she is in it because she loves sex so much, and 
she is ready to criticize many of her fellow stars for just being in it 
for the money. Eventually, her enthusiasm wanes as her income increases 
and as she becomes burnt-out. By the end, she says that she's ready to 
abandon it all for another career entirely. </P>
<P>Like a roman candle, Stacy shoots for her star and reaches it. It is a 
star that most of us would never want to aim for, and on her descent, it 
becomes clear that Stacy is beginning to harbor doubts as to whether she 
really wanted it in the first place.</P>
<P>THE GIRL NEXT DOOR runs 1:22. It is not rated but would be an R for 
strong sexual content and language and would not be appropriate for 
those under 19.</P>
