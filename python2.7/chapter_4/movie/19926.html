<PRE>MYSTERY MEN
Directed by Kinka Usher
Screenplay by Neil Cuthbert from the comic book by Bob Burden
With Ben Stiller, William H. Macy
UA South      PG-13      117 min</PRE>
<P>     "Mystery Men" is high-concept satire with low-concept execution,
a spoof of superhero conventions that finds itself unable to leap low
comedy at a single bound.  It's full of smart lines and ideas, and yet
its sophomoric leaden-footedness renders it as bankrupt of comic
superpowers as the inept title characters.</P>
<P>Champion City, home to the superstar superhero Captain Amazing
(Greg Kinnear), has hit a crime drought.  Thanks to his crime-busting
talents, the few remaining crooks are pathetic gangs up only to such
criminal enterprises as crashing a dance at a nursing home and
stealing wigs and dentures.</P>
<P>A trio of superhero wannabes -- Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), who
gets furious and rides a Harley compatible; The Blue Rajah (Hank
Azaria), who speaks with an affected British accent and throws forks;
and The Shoveler (William H. Macy), a decent family man who hits
people with a shovel -- tries to foil the nursing home caper, but even
at this they have to be bailed out by Amazing, an effective but
preening and commercialized crime-fighter whose face appears on
billboards all over the city, and whose uniform is plastered with
advertising logos. But Amazing, faced with the Alexandrine dilemma of
no new worlds to conquer, arranges to spring his former arch enemy,
the evil genius Cassanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush), from the
nuthouse.  When Frankenstein turns the tables and captures Amazing,
the hapless trio springs into action to save him and Champion City.</P>
<P>To recruit some backup they hold superhero auditions which
produce aspirants even more hopless than the core trio.  Out of this
pool they select Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who can only be
invisible when nobody's looking; The Spleen (Paul Reubens), who farts
spectacularly; The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), who flings a transparent
bowling ball with her mafioso father's skull inside it; and The Sphinx
(Wes Studi), who utters deeply inane nuggets of wisdom.</P>
<P>There are moments of wit, and Macy does his best to lend comic
dignity to the production.  Garofalo utters her one-liners with
spirit, and Kinnear makes a nicely pompous hero when the inanity of
his dialogue doesn't hog-tie him tighter than his nemesis ever could.</P>
<P>It sounds so much better than it plays.  When a movie gets some
of its biggest laughs from flatulence, it is probably fair to conclude
that it stinks.</P>
