HOTEL SPLENDIDE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Writer/director Terence Gross's HOTEL SPLENDIDE is like a Tim Burton 
episode of "Faulty Towers."  Set on a cold British island in the middle 
of nowhere, the hotel is a spa for elderly guests with a regime that the 
Marquis de Sade would love.  The bad cuisine there is ipso facto good 
for you.  After it blocks your system, Cora Blanche (Katrin Cartlidge) 
administers enemas from a strange contraption that looks straight out of 
Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL.</P>
<P>With overcast skies and the look of a gothic horror picture, HOTEL 
SPLENDIDE is literally a dark comedy.  The film is more intriguing than 
funny, but it has an excellent cast, not the least of which is Toni 
Collette (THE SIXTH SENSE) as Kath, an ex-chef at the hotel, who is 
there for a return engagement.  Daring to serve edible and even tasty 
food, she sets herself up in competition to Cora's brother, Ronald 
(Daniel Craig), the hotel's head chef.  Stephen Tompkinson plays Cora's 
brother Dezmond, the crazy manager of the hotel, and Peter Vaughan plays 
Cora's father.  Cora's pedantic mother, although dead, lives on in 
instructional records on proper eating and health that are played during 
meals.   </P>
<P>The director is, first and foremost, a visual stylist.  The running joke 
of the film concerns the hotel's heating system.  Powered by the human 
waste of the hotel's guests, the system is explosively affected by 
Kath's changes in the dietary patterns of the hotel's residents.  The 
director, who has a wicked sense of humor, milks the overflowing sewage 
joke for all it's worth.  After our screening, he told me that the test 
audiences who saw the picture hated it.  He intended it for an art house 
audience, but the distributors wanted to market it as a crossover film 
so they got the multiplex crowd to see it.  Guess what -- the test 
audiences wanted him to recut it into a different picture entirely.  
After agonizing over it for months, he gave up and went with a slightly 
trimmed down version of his original vision.  The result is a 
fascinating film that's almost funny.</P>
<P>HOTEL SPLENDIDE runs a bit long at 1:45.  It is not rated but would be 
an R for some sex, nudity and language.  It would be acceptable for most 
teenagers.</P>
