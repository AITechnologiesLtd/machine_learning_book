<P>After Wild Wild West, viewers might be understandably apprehensive about
a summer film set in the Old West, the mere sight of a tumbleweed
striking fear into the hearts of moviegoers ‘round the world.  But
Shanghai Noon will change the way you feel about the recently maligned
genre.  Noon not only proves that Jackie Chan's mainstream hit Rush Hour
was no fluke, but also looks likely to establish co-star Owen Wilson as
one of Hollywood's most likeable comedic stars.</P>
<P>Noon's story is so simplistic that it could have been taken from a video
game (in fact, some games are much more complicated).  A Chinese
Imperial Guard named Chon Wang (Chan, Rush Hour) is sent to the great
western frontier of the United States to rescue a beautiful princess
(Lucy Liu, Ally McBeal) from working in a railroad slave camp.  Along
the way, he teams up with a struggling outlaw named Roy O'Bannon
(Wilson, The Haunting), who is being chased by a Machiavellian U.S.
Marshal.</P>
<P>As in any self-respecting buddy film, Chon Wang (pronounced like `John
Wayne') and Roy don't become friends right off the bat.  As Noon opens,
Roy and his gang of inept cowboys are trying to rob the train that is
carrying Chon Wang and his fellow Imperial Guardsmen.  It doesn't go
down as planned, and Roy ends up buried up to his neck in the desert,
while Chon Wang is separated from his group, which is now light
approximately one person.</P>
<P>What transpires from that point is a series of fantastic fighting scenes
that display Chan's physical prowess, plus enough side-splitting
one-liners from Wilson to keep even those that abhor martial arts glued
to the screen.  There are at least six great fight sequences that, quite
frankly, blow away the ones in the highly touted Mission: Impossible 2.
And, like many of Chan's other high-kicking extravaganzas, Noon offers
outtakes of flubbed lines and stunts gone bad (hey, that sounds like one
of Fox's May `sweeps' specials!).</P>
<P>As politically incorrect as any film that I can remember (fun is poked
at the Chinese, Native Americans, Jews and the irreverent White Man),
Noon also boasts a very funny scene where Roy trains Chon Wang to become
a cowboy (to Kid Rock's song of the same name), as well as a very
bizarre sequence involving a whorehouse, bubble bath and a Chinese
drinking game, the latter of which I was hoping would result in some
intoxicated fighting (a la Chan's wickedly cool Drunken Master 2), but
unfortunately that dream was never realized.</P>
<P>Noon is the directorial debut of Tom Dey and was written by Miles Millar
and Alfred Gough of Lethal Weapon 4 fame.  Dey's direction and the
co-written script skillfully blend the important elements of action and
comedy, but Wilson's deadpan drawl makes the whole picture worthwhile.
I couldn't help but wonder how much creative input he had in his own
lines, which seem as well written as either of the finely crafted
screenplays the actor has penned (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore).</P>
<P>PG-13 for action violence, some drug humor and mild adult language</P>
