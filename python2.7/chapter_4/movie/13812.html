<PRE>Ever After
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>It's not a bad thing to update old stories. It's done all the time in the
oral tradition. The difficulty with this film is not that the tale has
changed, it's that it's dry.</P>
<P>The new Cinderella, Danielle (Drew Barrymore) is not sitting around waiting
for her prince to come. She's a woman of the late twentieth century albeit
situated in sixteenth century France. When her father dies, she stays on in
his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother Rodmilla
(Anjelica Huston). She works by day, but reads Sir Thomas More by firelight at night.</P>
<P>Although the story is updated, you know the plot. Danielle meets Prince Henry
(Dougray Scott), goes to a ball disguised, is later found out and they live
happily ever after.</P>
<P>The movie is often like watching a filmed play. Theater in real life is
engrossing. Theater on the screen is usually lifeless. There doesn't seem to
be much going on. The camera can be a star of films. Here it's a co-conspirator.</P>
<P>Danielle's convictions are compromised. A socialist and a feminist, she
pretends to be royalty to get her man. A kind woman, her last act in the movie
is one of revenge.</P>
<P>The most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish. The fairy godmother
stand-in, Leonardo Da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) is fun to watch as the eccentric
old man who advises Danielle. Huston is enjoyable in her over-the-top wickedness.</P>
<P>In all fairness, my companion loved the film. Maybe it's one of those "chick
flicks" that men don't like. It is certainly a date film. Nearly the entire
audience was couples. Oh well, maybe it's good for something.</P>

known that his run of enjoyable summer films was bound to end sometime. Email
