<P>     WHEN WE WERE KINGS, a documentary about the Muhammad Ali/George 
Forman heavyweight "Rumble in the Jungle" boxing match, is a wonderfully 
nostalgic, and occasionally insightful, window into the recent past.  By 
nature, however, it is not a motion picture of any particular depth, nor 
is it intended to be.  Although the film touches on issues of racism and 
nationalism as necessary background elements, it does not delve far 
beneath the surface.  Those who would criticize the film view this as a 
fault; I see it as a creative choice.  WHEN WE WERE KINGS does not take 
a political or philosophical stance, and, as a result, successfully does 
what it sets out to do.  </P>
<P>     While WHEN WE WERE KINGS is not a biography of Ali, it offers a 
great deal of insight into why the boxer was equally beloved and 
despised during his heyday.  It's easy to forget how controversial a 
figure Ali was in the '60s and '70s, when he constantly proclaimed 
himself "the greatest", refused to register for the draft, and said 
things like "Damn America.  I live in America, but Africa's my home."  
Age and Parkinson's Disease have softened the man's image, and, as Spike 
Lee comments, it's shocking to realize how few young people understand 
who Muhammed Ali was.</P>
<P>     Today, George Forman is one of America's best liked public figures, 
but that's the result of a lengthy personality makeover.  In 1974, when 
the "Rumble in the Jungle" took place, Forman was a taciturn, 
frightening individual.  To gain his heavyweight championship position, 
he had "destroyed" both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton in the ring.  He 
didn't boast that he would beat Ali, but almost everyone believed he 
would.  He was as close to invincible as a fighter could be.  </P>
<P>     From the early press conferences to the aftermath, WHEN WE WERE 
KINGS chronicles the meeting of these two titans.  At times, the 
structure is uneven, especially when the film goes on a tangent 
detailing the start of Don King's career, but the bulk of the material 
is engrossing.  Since most of the footage was shot in 1974 (with the 
exception of "talking head" interviews with Spike Lee, Norman Mailer, 
and George Plimpton), watching this film is like taking a little time 
trip.  Ali and Forman appear on-screen, but only as they did around the 
time of the fight.  No retrospective interviews with either are 
presented.</P>
<P>     WHEN WE WERE KINGS has several high points, including footage of 
Ali's press conference and coverage of the "Black Woodstock" event that 
was supposed to precede the fight (the music festival went off as 
scheduled, but the fight was postponed for more than a month).  
Unsurprisingly, however, the most involving portion of the film is the 
coverage of the match, which details exactly how Ali was able to use the 
now-famous "Rope-a-Dope" tactic to pull off what is probably boxing's 
greatest upset.  This match, which took place at 4 a.m. local time on 
October 30, 1974 in Kinshasa, Zaire, marked the point at which Ali's 
image began to change from that of anti-hero to that of hero.  For sheer 
dramatic impact, "The Rumble in the Jungle" exceeds even the best 
fictional boxing stories, including ROCKY.</P>
<P>     Leon Gast's film has a fascinating production history.  The primary 
footage was assembled on location in 1974, but a long series of problems 
and delays kept the project shelved until 1989, when Gast, along with 
director Taylor Hackford (AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN, DELORES 
CLAIBORNE), began working to pare down hundreds of hours of film to a 
reasonable length.  The result is a dynamic look at one of the great 
moments in sports history, and an examination of how and why the 
participants were so important.  Through Gast's camera, we see the 
charisma of Ali and the menace of Forman, feel the energy of the crowd, 
and understand what an amazing fight the "Rumble in the Jungle" actually 
was.</P>
<P>     To use the old cliche, you don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy 
this motion picture.  All you need is an appreciation of recent history 
and a desire to learn more about an event that had far more importance 
in the world's eyes than any other heavyweight bout in the history of 
boxing.</P>
