<PRE>                               GODZILLA
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This film has little to do with the
          Japanese monster Godzilla.  A mutated iguana grown
          to giant proportions gets loose in New York City.
          Most of the thrills are really warmed-over JURASSIC
          PARK. Matthew Broderick is wasted, but Jean Reno
          has some nice moments.  The comic approach too
          often falls flat and does little for the story.
          Rating: 4 (0 to 10), low 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     In 1954 there was an anti-American uproar in Japan.  A Japanese
fishing boat had unknowingly caught fish contaminated by an American
nuclear test.  The fishermen had been sickened but not in time to stop
the fish from going to market. Japanese newspapers called the incident
another American atomic attack on Japan.  The Toho film company took
outrage from this incident as inspiration.  That combined with the
recent successes of the film THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS and the re-
release of KING KONG inspired them to make their own monster movie.
This was the bleak and very angry film GOJIRA.  In the story Gojira was
a mythical beast identified with a 200-foot radioactive dinosaur who
comes out of the Pacific.  Made on a very small post-war budget, it
very ingeniously stretched some inexpensive special effects to massive
effect.  Some of the sets initially used wax miniatures of large
structures to save money.  Under harsh studio lights these props wilted
and melted.  As an inspiration an aerosol spray was added to the hand
puppet that was Gojira's head together with the wilt effect combined so
Gojira had breath that would fry chicken.</P>
<P>     American film entrepreneur Joseph E. Levine saw GOJIRA and seemed
oblivious to the anti-American tenor of the film.  He crudely added
additional footage with American actor Raymond Burr.  The name "GOJIRA"
probably sounded too Japanese for a country that had so recently been
fought a vicious war with Japan, so the name of the monster was
slightly modified to be less Japanese sounding but to still fit the
same lip movements.  The resulting film was redubbed GODZILLA, KING OF
THE MONSTERS. The Americans turned this little anti-American film into
a big international success, the first such success that there had ever
been in the Japanese film industry.  Godzilla has remained an enduring
character in Japanese film, even as the character has been repeatedly
modified.  Two series of monster films have been built around him.
Finally it was decided little more could be milked from the character,
and Toho killed him off and licensed the copyright to be used by other
studios.  Roland Emmerich who made the films STARGATE and INDEPENDENCE
DAY apparently wanted to do his own giant monster film.  No name they
could give their creature would have the marquee value of calling their
beast Godzilla.</P>
<P>     While the new Godzilla may indeed have been inspired by Toho's
monster, the thing that they have ended up with has more differences
than similarities.  The new Godzilla is a mutant marine iguana owing
its unusual genetics to French nuclear testing in French Polynesia.
(Incidentally, there are no marine lizards in French Polynesia.  The
only marine lizard in the world is the marine iguana, and it is found
only in the Galapagos Islands.)  The creature, who would appear to be
about a hundred feet high, with powerful enough hind legs that it walks
bipedally, though bent over.  The massive creature destroys a number of
boats on its way from Polynesia to New York City, fulfilling a mission
of his own.</P>
<P>     Called in to investigate is Dr. Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew
Broderick), an expert in atomic mutation called from a three-year study
of earthworm mutation at Chernobyl.  Nick follows in the wake of
destruction left by the never-seen titanic beast destroying ships.
Also following in the wake seems to be a sort of French secret agent,
Philippe Roche played Jean Reno of LEON (in the US: THE PROFESSIONAL)
and of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.</P>
<P>     A full scale Godzilla movie with the sort of quality special
effects that the Japanese could not afford to lavish on the film was,
at least for me, an exciting idea.  Unfortunately, this was not the
film I was hoping for.  The approach of GODZILLA is intended to be in
large part comic, but only Jean Reno manages to make the humor really
funny.  Michael Lerner plays New York City Mayor Ebert and is made up
to look like Roger Ebert.  His assistant is Gene and looks just enough
like Gene Siskel for us to realize that that is the point of the joke.
But the joke just falls flat as often as it is used.  As with
INDEPENDENCE DAY there are several scenes that are homage to previous
films, also just not very amusing.  The film painfully lacks logic.
People do some totally unmotivated actions to keep the plot going,
though it often slows to a snail's pace.  Or the plot will move forward
by contrivance.  Nico suddenly get the urge to do a very specialized
chemical test on Godzilla's blood.  It turns out he is looking for a
result he apparently had no reason to suspect and which on the face of
it seems impossible.  But of course it turns out to be just the key
chemical test to move the plot forward.  Many of the effects and the
thrill scenes are borrowed directly from JURASSIC PARK.  The love story
awkwardly thrown into the mix is totally superfluous.  The empty
plotting and failed humor attempts are certainly not new to Godzilla
films, but it was hoped that they would be left behind with the low-
budget special effects flaws.</P>
<P>     The Japanese I have talked to have been anxious to see what
GODZILLA was to be like with good effects and a serious plot.  I am
sorry to say that I expect that they will be disappointed.  I rate this
one a disappointing 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
