<PRE>                                CRIMSON TIDE
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1995 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     Every summer, there are usually two or three "big" movies that
people just can't wait to see.  This summer, which is filled with
sequels and movies from television shows, the E-ticket ride I was
looking forward to was CRIMSON TIDE.  Why?  Well first off, it had a
great trailer that showed Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman, two of my
favorite actors.  It had a plausible and frightening premise: a Russian
radical gains control of nuclear missiles and threatens to launch
them.  Finally, to top it off, it took place on a American nuclear
missile sub, a place where many of us would love to visit but few
actually can.  Sure, it reminded me of a lot of other films and maybe
it should have been called, MUTINY ON THE HUNT FOR RED TOP SUB, but I
was hooked.</P>
<P>     Hackman plays the captain of the U.S.S. Alabama, Frank Ramsey, an
old seadog, warrior-without-a-war type who, when given the order to
launch his nukes, is contradicted by his executive officer, Lieutenant
Commander Hunter (Washington).  Hunter, a highly educated but untested
officer, tries to stop Ramsey until they can confirm a half-received
message fragment that may be a stand down order.   Ramsey will have
none of Hunter's doubts and continues to proceed to launch position.
With no other option, Hunter relieves  Ramsey of his command and then
it becomes musical mutinies.  Ramsey and certain sympathetic crew
members get their hands on some weapons and then they retake control of
the ship.  But wait, Hunter does not give up so easily.  He and his
mutineers grabs some guns and then....</P>
<P>     Produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Tony
Scott (the team gave us the frothy but entertaining TOP GUN),  I
expected CRIMSON TIDE to be, if nothing else,  a crowd pleaser that
would go like gangbusters and have an explosive climax.  I was right
about the first part, wrong about the second.</P>
<P>     There is a lot of excitement as we watch the superb performances
by Hackman and Washington.  Pulse raising side-plots such as an attack
by a renegade Russian sub and a scene where the Alabama nearly sinks
are the stuff that great submarine pictures are made of.  These give us
enough thrills to make up for the fact that there are some deep
problems in the hull of CRIMSON TIDE that eventually sink it in the
last twelve minutes.</P>
<P>     The producers, director, executive producer Lucas Foster and
screenwriter Michael Schiffer, created a great set-up, however, they
did not have the courage (a rare commodity in movies these days) to
make somebody the bad guy.  This is a film with no real villains.  Yes,
there is the mad Russian who wants to launch his missiles but he
doesn't count because we never see him except in a newscast and more
importantly, we know he isn't going to launch his missiles, so there is
no suspense there.</P>
<P>     The real conflict and source of tension is on the submarine and
the main question that has to be answered is: who is right, Ramsey or
Hunter.  The filmmakers essentially "wimp" out however and ultimately,
no man is completely wrong or right.  It is a good choice to give both
characters sympathetic qualities but this is not an art film, one of
them has to be the bad guy, or else there is nothing tangible to defeat
and we leave the theater unsatisfied.</P>
<P>     CRIMSON TIDE is worth seeing for the performances, hardware, and
stunning production values.   Tony Scott and cinematographer Dariusz
Wolski provide a tons of eye-candy and editor Chris Lebenzon keeps the
pace cracking.  The underwater effects by Dream Quest Images are far
superior to the last big sub picture, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, (RED
OCTOBER was a much better story) and Hans Zimmer's score is effective.
The best part is the sound.  I saw it at the Cinerama Dome and that
deep base.  Wow!</P>
<P>     If you want a ride, CRIMSON TIDE delivers.  If you want a great
high-tech thriller, you might have to wait until next summer.</P>
