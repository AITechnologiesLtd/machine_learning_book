<P>     "[Dorothy Parker] was a groundbreaker in a lot of ways.  In her
day, to write captions and fashion stories was about all that a woman
writer could aspire to.  Dorothy had the respect of her peers.  But she
was also a critic, and I think she worked against herself as an artist
in that capacity.  We show her once with a note in her typewriter--'Oh God, please let me write like a man.'  And what we really remember
her for is how much like a woman she wrote."
     - Randy Sue Coburn, co-writer, MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE</P>
<P>     MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE is set primarily against the
backdrop of the roaring '20s, with critic/poet/writer Dorothy Parker
(Jennifer Jason Leigh) as the centerpiece.  Parker was by far the best
known female member of the famed Algonquin Round Table--a collection of
journalists, actors, writers, and other artists who gathered daily for
lunch at a 44th Street Manhattan hotel.  Also included in the
membership of this exclusive circle were Robert Benchley (Campbell
Scott), Harold Ross (Sam Robards), and Charles MacArthur (Matthew
Broderick).  Among their successes, the Algonquin clique could claim
Pulitzer Prizes, Oscars, successful stage shows, and bestselling
books.  To the outside world, they were celebrities; to some on the
inside, they were "just a bunch of loudmouths showing off."</P>
<P>     Dorothy Parker is perhaps best remembered for her tart sayings and
pithy turns of phrase, and that's the tone that this movie initially
adopts--playful and clipped.  However, as the screenplay delves beneath
the surface of its lead character's personality, a grim, more serious
mood becomes pervasive, turning Dorothy's witticisms into self-
contemptuous jabs or cries for help.</P>
<P>     MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE is uncomfortable, as we in the
audience are forced to watch someone emotionally drowning without being
allowed to throw a life preserver.  If, as is asserted, the source of
all great literature is "an upheaved soul", then Parker had an endless
supply of inspiration, especially as her life became progressively more
dissolute (sex and alcohol have always been supposed antidotes to empty
existences).  Jennifer Jason Leigh, giving the best performance (to
date) of a varied career, is tremendous, drawling her lines in a
Katherine Hepburn-like voice and expressing pain as much through her
eyes as through words and body language.  Oscars have been awarded for
less.</P>
<P>     One of the most difficult tasks for a film maker is to blend
comedy seamlessly into a drama.  I'm not talking about inserting a few
pointed jokes here and there, but incorporating the humor as an
integral part of the story--one that makes the serious elements all the
more poignant.  Director Alan Rudolph (THE MODERNS, EQUINOX) succeeds,
creating in MRS. PARKER a picture to both laugh and cry through.</P>
<P>     Visually, this is the most interesting and ambitious of Rudolph's
projects.  The film opens in 1937, with Parker reminiscing about the
previous decade.  The bulk of the movie is shot in color, but various
flash-forwards--to '37, '45, and '58--are photographed in black-and-
white.  It's a memorable way to structure a motion picture.</P>
<P>     Arguments can be made about the historical accuracy of the film.
Many of the events related herein are based on Parker's own statements,
and she was notorious for exaggerating--if not outright lying--about
her past.  Regardless of how faithfully it records its title
character's life, however, MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE is a
top-notch movie.  Everything is in place--a striking lead performance,
solid supporting players, a well-written script, and, above all, expert
direction to merge the ingredients.  In a case like this, "truth" may
not be the most important factor to consider in the overall
evaluation.</P>
