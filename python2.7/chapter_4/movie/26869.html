"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Nobody has ever made a feature-length film based on a Dr. Seuss book,
and you'd better believe that nobody has ever been crazy enough to
attempt a live-action version of the good doctor's stories.  The reason
for this becomes painfully evident almost immediately in How the Grinch
Stole Christmas.  The sets are horrendously cheap-looking.  It seems as
though the filmmakers were going for a Willy Wonka & the Chocolate
Factory effect, but the overall gaudiness of everything smacks of the
last two Batman films.  And the fact that it took over $120 million to
make a film based on a 70-page book is a little alarming as well.</P>
<P>Luckily, Jim Carrey is a strong enough star to overcome the rest of this
mess.  The Grinch, based on Seuss' 1957 children's classic, will
probably be a big commercial hit no matter what any critics think. Which
brings up another interesting point – Seuss' story is supposed to be a
rallying cry against the commercialism of the holidays, but you can bet
your ass the film will have product placement tie-ins out the wazoo.  At
the end of the book, The Grinch sheepishly admits `maybe Christmas
doesn't come from a store,' but they're the only place you'll be able to
get your official Grinch merchandise.</P>
<P>Carrey (Me, Myself & Irene) stars as the titular Grinch, a green-fur-
covered, onion-eating creep with a heart two sizes too small.  He lives
on the mountain peak that overlooks Whoville, a town full of cheerful
people known as Whos (they're all pretty freaky looking in the face,
hair and teeth departments).  Whoville loves Christmas, as evidenced by
its residents shopping up a storm in the film's opening scene.  For the
holiday, Whoville celebrates something called a Who-biliation, and this
year marks the festival's 100th anniversary.</P>
<P>We learn the origin of The Grinch – a funny tale added here to pad the
film's running time - but the film's main focus is on the relationship
between the cold-hearted Grinch and precocious little Cindy Lou-Who
(Taylor Momsen).  She seems to be the only person in Who-ville
interested in giving the green grump another chance at redeeming his
social status in town.  Despite the girl's good intentions, The Grinch
still raids the town on Christmas Eve, absconding with everything
related to the holiday and hauling it up to the top of his mountain.</P>
<P>The Grinch started to get on my nerves after about 30 minutes, but then
Carrey's screen time was increased, which jump-started my interest in
the film.  He really saves the movie when it starts to slip off the
tracks. That said, Carrey's rendition of Burl Ives' `You're a Mean One,
Mr. Grinch' is a disaster, but the montage of him creating various evil
devices are pretty cool despite the song.  Momsen's gut-wrenching
rendition of the James Horner (Titanic) penned `Christmas, Why Can't I
Find You,' is much more enjoyable.  The film is at its best when it
sticks to the book's original narrative, provided here by Sir Anthony
Hopkins (M:I-2).</P>
<P>Although he didn't seem to affect many of the kids at my screening of
the film, this Grinch would have scared the crap out of me if I were a
little kid (my fear of the Hamburglar almost turned me into a child
vegetarian).  When was the last time you took your kids to a movie that
featured a $20 million star wearing a big, furry codpiece?  Plus, The
Grinch has piercing yellow eyes (so help me, God, yellow eyes).  Anybody
who knows anything about decent Christmas films knows this is the sign
of pure anti-holiday evil (see A Christmas Story – a real holiday
classic).</P>
<P>Like Battlefield Earth, there aren't many shots in The Grinch that
aren't off-kilter.  The effect is annoying, and makes it look like
director Ron Howard (Edtv) and crew were filming during an avalanche.
Howard predominately uses the same production team he's worked with on
his previous films, but he's never made a picture quite like The Grinch
before.  The sets looked like they'd collapse under the weight of a wee
kitten.</P>
<P>For some reason, Audrey Geisel (Seuss' widow) gave Howard and his
production company the okay to make the film after years and years of
rebuffing Hollywood's attempt to make her husband's story into a
feature-length film (he, apparently, was pleased enough with the cartoon
version).  Geisel was able to finagle veto power over the film, putting
the kibosh on several jokes she referred to as `bathroom humor' (despite
signing off on the casting of Carrey) and a scene that sounded pretty
anti-Semitic (it involved the Who-Steins…seriously).  The offensive
material comes from the odious duo of Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman
(Wild Wild West).</P>
<PRE>1:45 – PG for some crude humor</PRE>
