<PRE>Rating: Near Miss  (2 out of 4 stars)</PRE>
<P>Make no mistake about it, Space Cowboys succeeds due to the varying
iconic levels of three of its main leads; Eastwood, Jones and
Sutherland. Over the years, each man has arguably put a distinctive
stamp on American cinema. Dropped into the unsurprising, yet satisfying
Space Cowboys, their strength of personality lends the film it's best
moments. The script has no real unexpected moments and doesn't seek to
blast you with over the top special effects. It's quite simply a fun
movie that's as enjoyable as a home cooked meal.</P>
<P>The script pleasingly plays off the respective star's real life and film
images with varying degrees of success. Eastwood's first moments on the
screen, he's seen working in his garage, listening to jazz music, a nod
to his real life devotion to the music form. Sutherland spends much of
the film flashing his trademark loopy grin. It's that crafty smile we've
seen time and again in films such as M.A.S.H and Backdraft. Jones plays
off his acerbic, gruff screen persona to great effect, eliciting a
pathos from his role that is truly bittersweet. Garner, by comparison,
has a certain fuzziness to his character. His inclusion and role feels
more like an afterthought than an integral part of the film.</P>
<P>Frank Corvin (Eastwood), "Hawk" Hawkins (Jones), Jerry O'Neil
(Sutherland) and "Tank" Sullivan (Garner) are first shown as young men
in 1958. They are Team Daedalus, the country's top Air Force pilots. In
a gorgeously filmed black and white flashback, rebellious Hawk and rigid
leader Frank are seen test piloting a jet plane, soaring high enough to
see the moon, despite the blazing daytime sun. In a nice reference to
Greek mythology, like Daedalus' son Icarus, they fly too high and come
crashing to the earth. They have seen their prize, the moon, and both
men dream of someday visiting it.</P>
<P>Flash forward to modern day NASA. There is a crisis involving a
satellite of Corvin's design. It's in decaying orbit and falling towards
earth. The only solution is an in-flight repair and Corvin is the only
man who can do it. Realizing his strong negotiating chip, Corvin
leverage's his way into Team Daedelus making the space trip.</P>
<P>Most of the film's heart beats in the pre-flight training the geriatrics
must endure. There is an easy camaraderie between the stars and the tone
of the film slides into an almost TV sitcom-like quality. Due to
Eastwood's deliberate directing hand, the scenes play more sweetly
amusing than cloying. Frank and Hawk, despite their age, get into a bar
fight that plays like siblings venting life long grievances. The "Aw,
Mom, we weren't doing nuthin'" looks they give a team supervisor upon
explaining their shiners shows the actor's strength through subtlety.
Hawk, sans computer assistance, shows two young, hotshot astronauts, how
pilots flew in the old days. Jerry, with the practiced subtlety of a
snake charmer, hits on any women within range of his droopy shouldered,
coke bottle thick, be speckled sight. Eastwood sends the message that
old means nothing more than wiser, maybe a bit smarter and still
sexually potent.</P>
<P>There's almost an audible grate of metal on metal as the second half of
the film grinds gears from a character driven focus to adventure.
Although beautifully realized visually, the space rescue is truly
unremarkable. Nothing occurs that we haven't seen in other recent films
involving space travel. By shifting from the film's strong suit, its
leads, to straightforward action, a certain momentum is lost.</P>
<P>If you're not looking for any big revelations or insight into the human
condition, this is a movie for you. Space Cowboys doesn't try to present
itself as anything other than what it is: Fun, eminently watchable,
summer fare.</P>
