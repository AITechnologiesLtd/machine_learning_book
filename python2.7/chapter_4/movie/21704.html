<P>"Happy, Texas" is set in the kind of place that goes by in a wink if 
you happen to drive through it.  Its motto is "a town without a 
frown." And the movie justifies it. It is also remarkable in many 
ways. It is a first film by its director (42-year old Mark 
Illsley).and the co-writers. Their previous credits in showbiz are 
minimal, even microscopic. What we have here is The Bunch That Came 
from Nowhere and certainly got somewhere.</P>
<P>The movie they made is loads of fun, improbabilities and 
impossibilities. But then, it is a comedy-farce, a genre that is not 
confined by verisimilitude. At the same time, while farce often has a 
lining of nastiness, even cruelty, this one does not have a mean bone 
in its body, while, additionally,  escaping the temptations of a 
feelgood picture.</P>
<P>The unreal plot has two convicts, Harry and Wayne, minor criminals 
and pals, plus a third one, a killer, returning to the penitentiary 
from road building. A vehicular accident frees them. The buddies 
snatch a motor home whose owners, in dire straits, will not report 
yet as stolen so as to get the insurance money. The escapees are 
(don't ask) somehow led by a sheriff (William H. Macy) to Happy, in 
the lawman's mistaken belief that the duo are the long-awaited 
organizers of Happy's Eighteenth Annual Beauty Pageant for pre-Teens.</P>
<P>It  happens that the genuine organizers are a gay couple, so that 
Harry Sawyer and Wayne Wayne Wayne must assume both professional and 
sexual identities. You get the drift by now. Everything is, and will 
increasingly become, a tangle of quid pro quos which is carried out 
with much brio and with the audience's willing suspension of 
disbelief. Helping the spectators is the overall kindness of Happy's 
denizens, their total lack of anti-gay (the word they use is 
"homosexual") prejudice, and, of course, love.</P>
<P>There are two appealing women in this tall tale, Josephine, who runs 
a diminutive bank that looks like something from an old Western; and 
schoolteacher Ms. Schaefer, whose pupils are the pageant's 
performers. (I must say here that this is not really a beauty pageant 
but a talent competition with other towns, a fact that gets us to 
avoid thoughts of a certain, murdered beauty queen).</P>
<P> From the start the two buddies have started planning a robbery of the 
bank. The execution of this deed is Harry's job. Wayne gets stuck 
with training the kids. But what happens is --yes, a cliche, but so 
sweetly handled here-- that rapidly Harry and Jo (whose boy-friend is 
an on-off fellow)  are mutually attracted, while. more slowly, the 
same happens to Wayne and Mrs. Schaefer.</P>
<P>A third element, nicely worked in, is Sheriff Chappy, a very sweet 
fellow who discovers that he is attracted to Harry. And a fourth 
element, much later, is the reappearance of the third escaped convict 
who also wants to rob the bank while Harry and Wayne have second 
thoughts about it.</P>
<P>Does all this make sense? Not a bit, but who cares? The performers 
are all likable. The accents are fine, including Jeremy Northam 
(Harry Sawyer), the British actor recently seen in "The Winslow Boy" 
and in "The Ideal Husband."  Steve Zahn (Wayne), with his overgrown 
mustache and sideburns, and his redneck accent, is a model of 
vulgarity. Do notice that after his fling with Illeana Douglas, she 
shaves him, he loses his hickish looks and much of his low-class 
accent. A good, subtle touch.</P>
<P>Also subtle, during the weird courtship between Harry and Jo, is that 
he, her best friend by now, fixes her hairdo and makeup. This brings 
on a perceptible but un-showy progression of her looks from pleasant 
to beautiful.</P>
<P>The amorous sheriff is also subtly depicted, and so on. On the other 
hand, the film gets tangled up in too many directions which muddy the 
waters, especially in its second half.
When the only villain in the story (the nasty convict) takes 
hostages, robs the bank and has outside authorities come in, the 
slightly wounded sheriff says "I'm a little confused."</P>
<P>So might also say the public. What is a gay bar (or at least a Gay 
Night of dancing) doing in such a tiny town? Where did Wayne learn 
how to use a sewing machine? How do the kids get to be so so well 
prepared that they give a delightuful performance in the pageant. And 
more. But even then, even with a few dead spots, the movie's warm, 
inventive nature wins over the potholes of the plot.</P>
<P>Note: If you wish to see a splendidly comical satire of beauty 
pageants, get "Smile" a 1975 picture directed by Michael Ritchie, 
starring Bruce Dern.</P>
