<P>_The_Virgin_Suicides_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>To use an exhausted cliché, the whole of _The_Virgin_Suicides_ is far
less than the sum of its parts.  There are a lot of good individual
elements on display in Sofia Coppola's screen adaptation of Jeffrey
Eugenides' novel, yet they never quite gel into something that completely
satisfies--a shortcoming that can be blamed by the film's most
distinctive quality.</P>
<P>With a title like _The_Virgin_Suicides_, the film's outcome is never in
doubt.  The setting is the suburban Midwest sometime in the 1970s, and
the "virgins" in question are the five Lisbon sisters--Lux (Kirsten
Dunst), Therese (Leslie Hayman), Mary (A.J. Cook), Bonnie (Chelse Swain),
and Cecilia (Hanna Hall)--who all take their own lives within the space
of a year.  The exact reasons why is the mystery at the heart of the film
and the point of obsession of three lovestruck boys who live in the
neighborhood, who are most prominently represented by a still-haunted,
unseen adult narrator.</P>
<P>In filmic terms, to label something a "mystery" almost implies the
presence of a clear-cut solution, but there are no real answers given in
_The_Virgin_Suicides_, only questions--a bit ironic, considering its
tell-all title.  The questions, however, appear to be entirely the point.
 The film is supposed to be the shared memory of these boys, and like a
memory faded through time, _The_Virgin_Suicides_ has an ethereal,
dreamlike vagueness.  Not much is ever learned about any of the sisters,
not even the focal Lux, whose adventurous sexuality (she's the exception
to the "virgin" label) leads to a decision by their parents (James Woods
and Kathleen Turner) that plays a part in the girls' destruction.  But
the thinness of their characters is forgivable since they are near-mythic
figures to the boys.</P>
<P>I haven't named any of the boys nor the actors who portray them because
they, too, have virtually no distinct identity individually nor as a
group.  While the dreamlike quality that Coppola gives the film is
largely effective, from the evocative score (by Air) and visual style to
the idealized vision of the Lisbon sisters, extending that to the boys is
a major misstep.  They are the audience's entry vessel into the story,
but it's impossible to connect with them on an emotional (or any other)
level since nothing is ever learned about them.  As such, when the title
event occurs, it's in an emotional vacuum; the audience can't really feel
for the loss of the girls since it never really knew them, and without a
sense of who the boys are and were, it's just as impossible to completely
empathize with or understand their loss.</P>
<P>With the characters intentionally made sketchy, the actors are called on
to shade them in, and Coppola coaxes fine work from them all.  Especially
noteworthy are Woods, both sleazy and charming as the model
airplane-obsessed Lisbon patriarch; Dunst, who strikes the right balance
of innocence and sensuality for Lux; and Josh Hartnett as Trip Fontaine,
the jock stud who takes an interest in Lux.</P>
<P>Much like how strong individual elements add up to a curiously
undernourished whole, the most memorable thing about
_The_Virgin_Suicides_ turns out to be its greatest hindrance: the
atmosphere.  While lending the film an eerie beauty as it unspools, the
relentlessly dreamy mood makes the film similarly weightless. 
_The_Virgin_Suicides_ is indeed an entrancing experience, but there's
nothing solid left to hold onto once it's over.</P>
