<P>     If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Woody Allen should
feel sincerely flattered by WHEN HARRY MET SALLY..., Rob (THE PRINCESS BRIDE)
Reiner's latest romantic comedy.  The comparisons between this film and Allen's
ANNIE HALL are inevitable -- Reiner almost seems to be inviting them in fact.  
But, whilst it doesn't quite match that film stylistically, it does come
awfully close on occasions.  </P>
<P>     The film stars Billy (RUNNING SCARED, MEMORIES OF ME) Crystal and Meg
(INNERSPACE, D.O.A.) Ryan in the title roles.  They are two mismatched
individuals -- she an aspiring journalist, he a successful political consultant
-- who meet and fall in love, yet don't fully realize it until twelve years
afterwards.  </P>
<P>     Prior to that revelation, the two of them bump into each other on two
separate occasions and end up discussing love, sex, and marriage.  Harry's
philosophy on life is that a man can never be friends with a woman to whom he's
attracted because "the sex thing always gets in the way."  Nevertheless he
finds Sally "empirically" attractive.  What follows is a love/hate relationship
in which the hate often outweighs the love.  </P>
<P>     When Harry and Sally meet for the third time in twelve years, it's in a
book store.  "There's a man staring at you in Personal Growth," comments
Sally's girlfriend Marie.  She's played by Carrie Fisher of Princess Leia fame
and, together with Bruno Kirby as Harry's best friend Jess, provides the two
leads with staunch acting support.  </P>
<P>     The screenplay, by Nora (HEARTBURN) Ephron -- who also serves as the
film's Associate Producer -- is well-structured but misses some of the insight
and astuteness which garnered ANNIE HALL an Academy Award back in 1977, the
year this new film opens, ironically.  Nevertheless, it remains consistently
funny, with writing of the "In a city of 8 million people, I have to run into
my ex-wife!"  calibre.  </P>
<P>     But the nicest surprise is Meg Ryan's performance as Sally.  Frankly, it's
a gem.  Although not known for her comedic talents, director Reiner certainly
brings them out in this movie.  Working shoulder-to-shoulder with Crystal, a
comedian of considerable skill, Ryan is never out of her depth and often
outshines him.  </P>
<P>     Crystal's rendering of the smug, know-it-all Harry often drifts into some
of the characterizations which populate his stand-up routines, and it's
distracting at times.  His character doesn't develop much throughout the course
of the movie.  In fact, one of the few things that does change about Harry is
the length of his sideburns.  </P>
<P>     Sally, on the other hand, develops significantly.  The scene in which she
learns that her ex-boyfriend has recently married is a joy to watch.  Ryan's
red-eyed, rag doll hysterics are spot on and beautifully realized.  And there's
a scene in a sandwich bar which is an absolute riot.  </P>
<PRE>     But to return to the parallels between this film and ANNIE HALL... </PRE>
<P>     WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... opens with a bouncy, nostalgic jazz tune
reminiscent of Woody Allen's later films.  Reiner also intersperses the action
with documentary-style interviews -- a common Woody Allenism -- between married
couples.  Seated against a pastel backdrop, they discuss how they met and how,
after all these years, they're still together.  And the film's subject matter
itself -- New Yorker's neuroses about sex, marriage and relationships -- is
prime Woody Allen territory.  </P>
<P>     Moviegoers who don't particularly like Woody Allen, but enjoy his brand
of humor, might get a big kick out of WHEN HARRY MET SALLY....  At its worst,
the film is simply derivative.  But at its best, it holds its own against some
of that director's finest work. </P>
