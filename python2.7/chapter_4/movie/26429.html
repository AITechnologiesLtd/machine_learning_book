<P>   I once corresponded by e-mail with a rich woman, the wife
of a successful doctor.  She regularly said, only half-jokingly,
that he is a lucky man.  Why?  Because "he gets to see
women in their panties."  Are male doctors really fortunate in
that respect?  This is doubtful since they get to see a large
number of women each day and I suspect they take a purely
professional interest in the panties.  Then again: could the
converse be true?  Could a gynecologist, who sees women in
the most intimate way, become so anesthetized that he would
no longer appreciate his wife or girl friend as a woman?  This
is not the case with Dr. Sullivan Travis (Richard Gere) who,
in Robert Altman's new, intermittently comic and lovingly
satiric "Dr. T and the Women," portrays a busy man who has
the highest respect for the opposite sex.  "They're saints," he
believes, and he is very much attracted to his wife, Kate
(Farrah Fawcett).  But when Kate falls victim to a
psychological ailment described, perhaps tongue-in-cheek by
psychiatrist Dr. Harper (Lee Grant), as a reversion to
childishness and virginity, Dr. T finds that notwithstanding all
the women he sees in his examining room and the seductive
moves by his nurse Carolyn (Shelley Long), he is missing the
tenderness he craves.</P>
<P>   In his usual style, Robert Altman has created yet another
quirky, multilayered film that casts his impudent eye on an
aspect of American culture.  This time around, he does not
complicate his tale as he did with the movie for which he is
most known, "Nashville," which is a mosaic of the American
experience created by interweaving 24 characters into a
loosely structured plot.  His target is women who lunch,
described as the upper reaches of Dallas, Texas society but
who appear more like members of the haute bourgeois than
the genuine aristocracy.  Women of various ages are looked
at with Altman's cocky gaze, though none is differentiated
from the other by level of wealth.  These matrons patronize
Dr. T's medical office in droves, often showing up without
medical reason weekly, ostensibly to be touched by the
gentle and expert hands of this handsome and charming
physician.</P>
<P>   In a series of comical takes, Altman--taking full advantage
of Anne Rapp's knowing script--throws a series of episodes
our way even while focusing on his principal story, that of the
travails of Dr. Travis.  No sooner have the opening credits
disappeared than we find ourselves in the presence of one
patient who smokes while being examined and is told by the
doctor that she is the only person allowed to do this
anywhere in the suite.  Except for age differences, the
women are alike in that all have blond hair, all dress in high
heels even when leisurely visiting the mall.  As for the mall
itself, this Dallas creation is nothing like the Wendy's, Pizza
Hut and McDonalds emporium  so cleverly parodied in Paul
Giamatti's "Duets" monologue but consists rather of shops
like Godiva, Tiffany's and Guess.</P>
<P>   While Altman spends the first half of the movie with his
overview of the chattering, clucking, women, seen during the
opening credits as nothing less than a human imitation of a
chicken coop, he gets down to business some time after his
wife Kate reverts to a virgin childishness and warns him that
his advances are "not nice."  Though Travis is surrounded by
women day and night--his home houses two college-age
daughters, Connie (Tara Reid) and Dee Dee (Kate Hudson)
and even his sister-in-law Peggy (Laura Dern) and her three
kids--he is a one-woman man and finds love in the arms of
an independent, athletic spirit, assistant golf pro Bree (Helen
Hunt).  Burnt out by an accumulation of dilemmas including
his wife's psychosis, his daughter's wedding plans, his
perpetually overbooked practice and his attraction for the
elusive Bree, Dr. T undergoes a psychological, and later
physical, breakdown that allows him to reassess his life.</P>
<P>   While Altman is obviously sending up these chattering and
yet need rich women, he is sympathetic to all his characters
and, we suspect, under his satiric tone he too believes that
the gentle sex harbors an unlimited number of candidates for
sainthood.  Even Richard Gere, traditionally wrapped up in
himself and in several films more concerned about his flowing
mane than about the people who surround him, is likeable. 
Helen Hunt is particularly good as the one woman about his
age who is different from the rest.  Her character is not
society, she rents a house for just $750 a month, and is the
happiest and most centered individual in the picture.  On the
whole, "Dr. T and the Women" does for Texas what Nashville
did for Tennessee except that this time Altman more
decisively casts himself in the image of a Truffaut in his
affection for women.  The movie is a charmer.</P>
