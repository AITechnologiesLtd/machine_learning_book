<P>     The first star vehicle of the summer of 1996 is also the first 
major disappointment of the season.  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, the big screen 
resurrection of the popular late-'60s/early-'70s series, fails to 
generate much in the way of excitement or intrigue. This globetrotting 
adventure looks like an opportunity for Tom Cruise to play James Bond  -
- a role he is totally unsuited for.  The writing for last year's 007 
return, GOLDENEYE, isn't a lot better than that for MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, 
but, as an action hero, Pierce Brosnan is considerably more debonair and 
charismatic than Cruise.</P>
<P>     There's no Bond in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE.  Instead, the lead 
character is Ethan Hunt, the point man for Jim Phelps' IMF (Impossible 
Missions Force).  Phelps (played by Jon Voight, not Peter Graves) 
receives assignment messages from his boss, Kittridge (Henry Czerny), 
via video transmissions rather than old-fashioned tapes.  His group's 
latest job is to prevent something called a "NOC list" from falling into 
the hands of an international arms dealer (Vanessa Redgrave).  If placed 
on the open market, the NOC list would put every United States deep 
cover agent in danger of exposure.  However, when they embark on this 
mission, the IMF runs straight into an ambush where everyone is killed 
except Hunt and Phelps' wife, Claire (Emmanuelle Beart).  Because he 
survives the carefully-orchestrated massacre, Hunt is suspected of 
turning traitor.</P>
<P>     Fans of the TV series expecting a faithful translation may be 
disappointed.  Except for a few nods to its small-screen predecessor, 
this MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is a vastly different, autonomous entity.  Nine 
years ago, director Brian DePalma used a similar approach for a superior 
version of THE UNTOUCHABLES, but lightning hasn't struck twice.  
Teetering on an uncertain edge between action flick and thriller, 
MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE doesn't succeed well as either.  There are some 
high-energy moments, but none offers more than a moment's edge-of-the-
seat excitement.  Too much of what happens in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE comes 
across as fait accompli.</P>
<P>     The predictable plot generates little interest.  It's pathetically 
easy to guess the mole's identity despite the screenwriters' attempts to 
obscure the issue.  The overall storyline contains a legion of gaping 
holes -- the more you think about it, the less sense it makes.  Weak 
character identification allows TWISTER to seem like a masterpiece by 
comparison.  In fact, taken as a whole, TWISTER is a significantly more 
involving spectacle.</P>
<P>     Megastar Tom Cruise (who also co-produced the movie) struts and 
smirks his way through his role in a way that makes Hunt easy to 
dislike.  It's not a particularly good performance, either.  Cruise's 
supporting players form an interesting group, although not necessarily 
the kind of names one might expect in a big-budget action film.  They 
include a highly-respected French actress, Emmanuelle Beart (MANON OF 
THE SPRING, NELLY & MONSIEUR ARNAUD); a veteran American actor, Jon 
Voight (MIDNIGHT COWBOY); FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL's Kristin Scott-
Thomas; and the internationally-renowned Vanessa Redgrave.</P>
<P>     What does it say about the current status of American motion 
pictures that three of Paramount Pictures' big 1996 releases, MISSION: 
IMPOSSIBLE, A VERY BRADY SEQUEL, and STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT, are TV 
series regurgitations?  If this movie is any indication, originality 
isn't high on the studio's list of priorities.  TWISTER has taken a 
critical drubbing because of its style-over-substance approach to 
entertainment, but MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is a worse offender.  The 
substance here isn't appreciably stronger, while the style is less eye-
popping.  Due primarily to several deftly-crafted action sequences, 
MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE boasts a few memorable moments.  Keeping in mind 
what's expected from would-be summer blockbusters, this movie isn't a 
disaster, but, all things considered, there's little reason to make it a 
high priority for theatrical viewing.</P>
