<P>         Originally shot in 1996 and scheduled for release last May,
``Hard Rain'' is a costly embarassment Paramount is trying to sweep
under the carpet as quickly and quietly as possible. Of course, the
recent publicity about star Christian Slater's new role as a celebrity
jailbird won't help matters in that area, and although the title was
changed from ``The Flood'' to ``Hard Rain'' - supposedly to more
accurately reflect the film's content, if you can believe that - a
better choice might have been ``Total Washout.''</P>
<P>  All the earmarks of a troubled production are here: slapdash
visual effects, choppy continuity, a plot that never quite seems to
get going.  The direction by former cinematographer Mikael Salomon
dutifully follows the credo of ``when in doubt, shoot it in slow
motion and hope it looks good.''  Unfortunately, one body slogging
around in the water at night tends to look very much like another, and
often in ``Hard Rain'' it's a challenge to tell who's doing what.</P>
<P>  Nor are most viewers likely to care. After a passable first
reel in which armored car drivers Tom (Slater) and Charlie (Ed Asner)
run afoul of hijacker Jim (Morgan Freeman) and his crew, Graham Yost's
screenplay quickly degenerates into water-logged chaos as the few
folks left in the submerged town of Huntingsburg, Ind., spend the
night chasing and shooting at each other, all for the love of money,
in this case some bags containing $3 million that Tom salvaged from
the car. Somehow everyone in town has managed to get ahold of a boat
or a jet-ski, so each cast member gets an opportunity to be thrown out
of his or her watercraft into the dirty canals of this Midwestern
Venice.</P>
<P>  Also lurking around is a derelict former sheriff (Randy
Quaid) and, in one of the film's typically absurd twists, an art-lover
named Karen (Minnie Driver) who has made it her mission to save the
windows of the local church, come hell or, in this case, high
water. As ``Hard Rain'' doggie paddles into its final stretch it
becomes obvious that the real reason Karen is around is to give
Salomon a chance to photograph Driver and Slater in matching clingy
wet T-shirts.</P>
<P>  Although a couple of bickering senior citizens (Betty White
and Richard Dysart) surface occasionally to contribute some put-downs
and profanity, the only real laughs come from the character who
miraculously comes back from the dead just long enough to murmur
crucial pieces of information, and the only words in the script that
seem to ring true are Freeman's frequent declarations that ``I'm only
here for the money,'' an attitude that carries over to his lifeless
performance.</P>
<P>  Technically, the film is sometimes impressive, with a few OK
stunts and one solid sequence detailing Tom's escape from a flooding
jail cell. But when it resorts to throwing in a near-rape scene for
cheap thrills and throws logic out the window by having almost
everyone involved completely change their personalities in the last
reel, it's obvious this mess was created by people who probably don't
have the sense to come in out of the ``Rain.''</P>
