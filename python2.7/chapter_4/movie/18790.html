<P>Okay, so I was a little distracted by the fact that I had Jacques
Villeneuve, Formula I race car driver, snuggling up to his better half a few
rows behind me in the theatre, but once the groovy tunes sounded off, the
colorful characters jumped on-screen and Austin Powers blasted into his
all-familiar mojo fever, there was no denying that the 60s were back, and
this shagadelic sequel had begun!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Dr. Evil time-travels back to the 1960s to steal Austin Powers' mojo (His
essence, his aura, his libido, if you will). With the absence of his horny
spirit, Austin loses focus and must also return to the 60s in order to
regain his essence.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Clever, witty, enjoyable, fun and almost as fresh and original as the first
one, save for a few redundancies which didn't click and Heather Graham who
was not as interesting as Elizabeth Hurley in the original (although her
outfits are simply smashing!), this movie will definitely satisfy all
Austin/Dr. Evil lovers and guarantee a solid box-office summer for Myers and
crew. This movie starts off with a bang, as the first 20 minutes deliver
some of the film's funnier moments (The whole Jerry Springer sequence
cracked me up). It also seemed as though they put more emphasis on the Dr.
Evil character in this follow-up, which was all fine with me, cause I
personally found him to be more entertaining than Austin in the first place.
Nevertheless, kudos go out to Mike Myers once more for pulling off plenty of
smart one-liners, movie homages galore, and tossing a couple of new
characters into the mix. Mini-me, a midget Dr. Evil, seemed to be the
biggest crowd pleaser, and the Fat Bastard (Myers under 80 pounds of latex
fat), who I could've done without, save for one hilarious scene in bed with
a female spy.</P>
<P>A couple of other things which didn't truly delight me were the Austin
Powers dancing segues between scenes, which seem forced and self-indulgent,
and the song and dance numbers in the film, which appeared to be nothing
more than time-fillers. But on the whole, this movie is funny and will have
you cracking up at Dr. Evil's father/son silly banter, Mini-me's fight with
Austin, the multitude of sexual overtures delivered by Austin, and the
overall enthusiasm of the entire ride down the 60s free-wheeling, all-loving
shagfest. Folks who did not enjoy the first film, will undoubtedly scoff at
this sequel, which plot-wise, does even less than its predecessor. But for
all of you who enjoyed the first movie for what is was, a goofy, original,
over-the-top spy parody, chances are that you will most certainly enjoy the
bulk of this film, with its re-occurring characters (and jokes, at times),
Myers' fantastic performance as Evil and Powers, its fun loving,
self-deprecating attitude, and all the kitchy goodness that you could stuff
inside of ninety minutes of groovy cinema. Now does that make you horny?</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Cameos galore in this one as well (Don't read further, if you don't want to
know who they are). Tim Robbins plays the President of the United States of
America, Woody Harrelson shows up as, well, a character named Woody, and
Kristen Johnston plays some husky Russian babe, Ivanna Humpalot. Clint
Howard, Ron Howard's brother, also returns as the radar operator. Burt
Bacharach, Elvis Costello, Willie Nelson, Rebecca Romjin-Stamos and Jerry
Springer also show up as themselves.
The actor playing Mini-me is named Verne Troyer. He is 32 inches tall. You
may remember him as the tiny Santa Claus on top of Arnold Schwarzenegger in
1996's JINGLE ALL THE WAY.
Mike Myers claims that nearly 40% of the dialogue in this film was
improvised on the spot, and that he has agreed to do up to five Austin
Powers films in all. Even King Hussein of Jordan was a huge Austin Powers
fan according to Myers, and watched the tape when he was ill at the Mayo
Clinic.
The original AUSTIN POWERS film became Billboard's No.1-selling video in its
category in 1998, and has been there ever since (as of June 9, 1999...64
weeks and counting).
James Bond film references: (Entertainment Weekly#489) The title is a direct
rip-off of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. When Austin and Felicity hit the beach in
bikinis, it's a reference to Ursula Andress in DR.NO. The new volcanic lair
of Dr. Evil is from YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE (Just as Dr. Evil is patterned after
TWICE's Blofeld character). The music for the sequel is very CASINO ROYALE,
and there's a bit of GOLDFINGER in the scene where Austin sees an assassin
behind him in the reflection of his glasses. There are also plenty of other
film references tossed in and around, such as INDEPENDENCE DAY, JERRY
MAGUIRE, THE EXORCIST, STAR WARS, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, and many more
which I just can't seem to remember at this time.
This film was originally titled IT'S SHAGGING TIME and THE RETURN OF DR.
EVIL.
In the U.S., "shag" is far less offensive than in other English-speaking
countries. Singapore briefly forced a title change to THE SPY WHO SHIOKED ME
("Shioked" means "treated nicely.").</P>
