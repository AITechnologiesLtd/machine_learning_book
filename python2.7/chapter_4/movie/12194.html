<P>Victor Hugo's classic epic has been brought to the screen magnificently.  Aided
by a top-notch cast, the film will surely be considered come Oscar time.  In
1812, Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson) is the convict who spends 20 years in jail at
hard labor for having stolen a loaf of bread.  His pursuer, Javert, (Geoffrey
Rush) is nothing less than malicious as he relentlessly tracks him.</P>
<P>When Valjean seeks food and shelter at a house several days distance from his
jail, it is the home of a Bishop.   He is allowed in to have dinner and to have
a good night's sleep.   However, the many years of hard labor as a convict have
taken their  toll and Valjean will do anything to survive: steal, lie, cheat.
Amazed that the Bishop will allow him to spend the night there, he cannot help
but ask "How do you know I will not kill you?" To which the Bishop replies, "And
how do you know I will not kill YOU?"</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the 20 years in jail overcome Valjean and before he leaves the
house he steals some silverware and, when the Bishop enters the room and
discovers the theft in progress, Valjean bludgeons him and runs away.   Shortly
thereafter the police find him because being poor he looks like a suspicious
character.  The silverware is found on him and he is returned to the Bishop.
The gendarmes are told that Valjean told them the truth when he said the Bishop
had given him the silverware, and the astonished police release him.   If the
police are amazed, Valjean is even more so,  that after having stolen  and
physically hurt him, the Bishop did not turn him in.    At the Bishop's urging,
Valjean promises to turn over a new leaf.</P>
<P>Fast forward 10 years to 1822.   Valjean is not only prosperous but is also the
quiet, honest Mayor of the small town of Vigau.    All would have been well had
not Javert happened to come to town and recognize Valjean as a former prisoner
who after being released had not reported to the authorities which the terms of
his parole required. Thus begins the  chase.</P>
<P>In the town, there is a poor, sick  woman named Fantine (Uma Thurman) who has
had a baby  out of wedlock.   Before she dies, Valjean promises to raise her
daughter, Cosette (Claire Danes) as if she were his own.   To evade the pursuing
Javert, the two take refuge in a convent.   Eventually, as Cosette matures into
a beautiful young lady she persuades Valjean they must leave the convent.  She
wants to see the outside world.</P>
<P>It is now 1832, with young revolutionaries challenging and wishing to unseat the
government.  Among the leaders of the revolution is Marius (Hans Matheson) a
young handsome man with whom Cosette falls in love when she sees and hears him
urging revolution to a crowd of bystanders.   More trouble ensues when, shades
of Tien An Men Square, the army kills and routes many of the young
revolutionaries.</P>
<P>But the main story is that of Valjean and Javert who, in the film's several
climaxes, encounter each other.  What takes place between them in each of the
tense meetings as well as the final one could only come from the pen of a genius
such as Victor Hugo.</P>
<P>Both Neeson and Rush are superb in their roles.  There is nothing about
Schindler in Neeson, nor is there the slightest resemblance to SHINE's David
Helfgott in Rush's malevolent, unsmiling, vindictive Javert.   A fine film with
Screenplay by Rafael Yglesias and excellent music by Basil Poledouris.</P>
