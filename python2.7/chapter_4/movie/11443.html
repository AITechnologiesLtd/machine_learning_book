<PRE>Akira (1988) 124m. </PRE>
<P>The mother of all manga (Japanese animation) films.  If you don't like
this sampling of the genre, then quit now - there aren't many that
come better, or at least bigger, than this.  AKIRA is the manga that
all others, for better or worse, are measured by (its popularity in
the West has helped this enormously).  As with others of its type, the
plot of AKIRA - which I won't even try to capsulize here - is
secondary to the visual action. Story is set 30 years after World War
III, which nominally makes it science fiction, and its convincing
portrayal of a high-gloss dystopia (a mix of BLADE RUNNER and
CLOCKWORK ORANGE) does stamp a strong SF feel onto the first half
hour.  Eventually this gives way to the personal torment and wholesale
destruction conventional of manga, and the SF element is consumed by
the quasi-religious ascension that appears to be the only logical
'out' that films of this type can conclude with.</P>
<P>At the time of production AKIRA was the most expensive animated film
produced in Japan, and it may well still hold that record.  It was
obviously a labor of love for writer/co-director Katsuhiro Otomo, who
also wrote the graphic novels on which it was based.  His meticulous
attention to detail (especially noteworthy are the finely-rendered
backgrounds and enormous palette of colors) shows that he approached
the task of animating his book as if he were making it as a
live-action film - the drawings were so finely rendered that frames
were drawn for 70mm film.  He also departed from the conventional
techniques of other Japanese studios by pre-recording the dialogue
before animating the characters.  Otomo and animation director Takashi
Nakamura use such 'live' camera techniques as slow motion,
focus-pulling, dollying, and tracking; infuse the soundtrack with a
rich variety of background/foreground noise; and revel in simulating
the effects of smoke, water, fire, wind, and speed.  Most impressive
is the way light sources (and their resulting shadows) are used,
especially when they 'flare' into the lens.  In fact, it's almost too
much of a good thing.  AKIRA is so consistently brilliant in its
execution that it's hard to keep appreciating just how good it is. 
There are the inevitable dull spots - it's over two hours, after all -
and some of the action sequences are never-ending, but it does manage
to pull through at the end to deliver a huge-scale climax.  If the
finale doesn't seem as impressive as the opening ten minutes (which,
like the rest of the film, deserve to be seen on the big screen for
real impact) its only because we've seen enough of it already.</P>
<P>I like AKIRA more than other films of its ilk (see ten minutes of
LEGEND OF THE OVERFIEND and you've seen the whole movie) but it's
distracting to see the characters speaking in American accents, and it
gets on my nerves hearing the characters screaming each others names
continuously.  There are also too many lantern-jawed Pekingese-nosed
he-men running around for my liking. Scenes of mass
destruction/carnage aren't as disturbing as the moments of more
personal one-on-one violence (we've seen Tokyo trashed on film too
many times to get upset about it now), which makes it distinctly
unsuitable for children.  Not that they'd be able to keep up with the
plot anyway, but then again, who can?  This also may be the only
cartoon with product placement - unless a new trend now catches on.</P>
