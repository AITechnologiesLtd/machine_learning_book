<PRE>        The hipster had absorbed the existentialist synapses of the Negro, and 
        for all practical purposes could be considered a white Negro.     </PRE>
<PRE>        -Norman Mailer (The White Negro)</PRE>
<P>In 1957 a young writer by the name of Norman Mailer composed the infamous
essay, THE WHITE NEGRO, a post-war musing designed as one of many strategies to
shock his way into becoming a major literary figure of Hemingwayesque stature.
Though the essay itself is consciously offensive (heralding the "Negro" as the
definition of coolness), but perhaps in spite of himself, Mailer caught sight
of a trend that was in its zygote stages; the glamorization of the black
lifestyle, a lifestyle that indicates fashionable oppression as its
provocateurist white members see it. The blackness projected by whites who want
to be black (somewhat offensively designated as wiggers) is all surface
hipness, for of course they cannot truly know what it means to be black, they
want to be the black they see presented on that dictator of youth culture, MTV.
They call each other "niggaz" and seek out black sex partners because they see
them as exotic, and they want to make themselves exotic and different. James
Toback's film is mostly about upper middle class whites who take on so-called
black vernacular, adorn themselves in the latest hip hop fashions, and steal
the attitudes of commercialized black culture.</P>
<P>Toback himself (like Mailer) has seemed in awe of this culture ever since the
early seventies when he began his film career. His screenplay for THE GAMBLER
(directed by Karel Reisz) was about a man who gambled, not for the money but
for the utter thrill of that win or lose moment. It wasn't the result that
propelled him but the process and by the end of the film when the gambler
ventures out into a dangerous black neighborhood, we realize that it is nothing
more than another gamble (one with his life). It's seen as the ultimate test of
man hood, and I don't doubt for one second that the gambler is a stand in for
Toback.</P>
<P>He explored a similar character in his directorial debut, my favorite Toback
film, FINGERS, which ended with a sensual menage a trois between two lithe
white women and a big burly black man (played by an eroticized Jim Brown) that
soon turned dangerous. This all while the white protagonist watches as if
viewing an animal make love to, then inflict pain upon his prey. The blackness
Toback gives us in BLACK AND WHITE is similar. At first it's presented as
sensual with ripe exoticism as the ultimate aphrodisiac, then titillation gives
way to fear--the message being one I'm sure Spike Lee would approve of: that
our cultures can never really mix it up without severe repercussions. Sadly,
Toback doesn't explore the issue, he exploits it. With this film he's making a
blaxploitation flick that thinks it's anthropology. He's so enthralled by rap,
by the very essence of soulful ebony sexuality (mostly male) that he forgets to
make an actual movie and by the end nothing is illuminated, except that Toback
clearly has issues.</P>
<P>The writer\director lays his themes out like bumper cars, all his various views
colliding into each other resulting in a mess of provocative ideas. It is
reported that about 85% of the film was improvised, and that certainly shows.
Improvisation is a chancy way to approach film. When it works it can be highly
invigorating as in some of he better Robert Altman films, though when it
doesn't, it can be torturously awkward as in some of the lesser Altman films.
In BLACK AND WHITE we get helpings of both, though I think by the end the
latter response wins out. Most of the invigorating exchanges happen when Robert
Downy JR (as an eccentric gay man, though acting completely different from the
eccentric gays he portrayed in HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS and WONDER BOYS) is on
screen. Much of the film's comedy comes from when he hits on various unassuming
men, one of those being Mike Tyson (who is fetishized here in the same way that
Jim Brown was in FINGERS), who comes across a little brighter than you would
expect, though reacts exactly the way you'd expect. Another terrific example is
a scene wherein a bunch of black gangsters confront a white club owner (Scott
Caan) over salary, with guns instead of negotiating tactics.</P>
<P>But alas, those are like a Janeane Garofalo appearance in a poorly made film
(i.e. just about her entire output). The energy of those scenes only work to
show how good the film could have been had Toback reigned himself in. Much of
the movie becomes repetitive with elliptical conversations that don't lead
anywhere. It's as if Toback blew his load early on and had nothing more to say
so he simply repeated himself. That's a shame because the essential idea, to
explore an identity crisis among white teenagers aching to be black (hip), is
one of great promise.</P>
<P>But Toback doesn't explore these ideas, or points of views, he simply has his
characters yap at us, using such devices as a documentarian who asks the white
kids direct questions (giving them a chance to provide lengthy explanations),
or unfocused conversations between blacks ("What do these white people want
from us"). Instead of exploring the culture, he presents us with diatribes and
monologues (all be it highly improvised, but Toback still controls the content)
given by a crew of actors all in hopes of getting to the "truth". Whatever
truths we get come entirely from these Hollywood actors (from teen idols like
Jared Leto and Elijah Wood to ex-supermodels making an attempt at artistic
credibility like Brooke Shields and Claudia Schiffer) attempting to emulate a
culture I doubt they know much about.</P>
<P>In the Tobakian tradition he intertwines a pulp thriller plot with his
ponderous anthropological explorations. That plot concerns a hyper verbal cop
(Ben Stiller) who offers a college basketball star (real life point guard Allan
Huston in a relatively bland performance) a bribe to throw a game. This plot
doesn't go anywhere interesting, nor does it cohere with the rest of the film,
but Toback has found something interesting in Stiller's character, who isn't
much unlike the James Caan character (Toback's stand in, I'm convinced) in THE
GAMBLER. He's an ex-con (referred to by others in the film as "the gambler")
searching (not too swiftly) for some sort of redemption. The character is so
interesting on his own that I would like to see him get his own movie. Ditto
for Downy and (trust me this was a big surprise) Claudia Schiffer. Though her
character is a typically beautiful, cunning, female fatale (whose motives still
remain unclear to me) Schiffer plays her with such a cold, detached ideation
that she transcends the Sharon Stone-esque similarities and becomes a rather
potent and chilling force. Her final bit (during the end credits) gave me
chills because of there not-so-subtle ramifications. Unfortunately Toback gives
the majority of screen time to the stoical, emotionless Power whose cold stare
never hints at anything beyond coldness.</P>
<P>I know I've given the film a harsh review, but I still applaud Toback for the
effort. He's a true renegade, and it's quite extraordinary that he got such an
eclectic cast to perform with such intemperance. He gets these stars to do
things we've never seen them do and with a terrifically reckless abandon. He's
also exploring the American culture with a kind of film that, at least on the
surface, resembles the inventive cinema of the early 70's. Currently, we
occasionally get Oliver Stone's bombastic ramblings on American institutions,
but those are pandering at best. Even the majority of independent films shy
away from cultural examination, opting instead for gleeful family dysfunction
and cool detached white gangsters. (Though to be fair within the last year
we've seen several films attempting to get back to this). Toback is
unsuccessful, but he clearly had a vision and while he might not have tapped
the pulse of the zeitgeist, he at least hit the wrist, which is something, I
guess. It was reported that Toback ended up with four hours of possible footage
to cut down. I'm willing to bet that there is a truly brilliant film in there
somewhere. Instead Toback fished out a mediocre one.</P>
