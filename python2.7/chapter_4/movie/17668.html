PAYBACK (*** out of ******)</PRE>
<PRE>A review from the Stockholm Film Review
<A HREF="http://www.reviewfilm.com/">http://www.reviewfilm.com/</A></PRE>
<P>When Porter (Mel Gibson) and his partner Val Resnick (Gregg Henry) rob a 
bunch of Chinese mobsters, the last thing Porter expects is to be left 
for dead, having been double-crossed by Val and shot in the back by his 
wife, Lynn (Deborah Unger). He survives and decides to hunt the two 
down,and get his money back. His task is complicated by the fact that 
there are a lot of other parties interested in the money, not least the 
Chinese, but also a couple of bent cops and a whole syndicate of bad 
guys.</P>
<P>Director Brian Helgeland's career so far has ranged from the excellent
L.A. Confidential to the God-awful Assassins. He has worked with Gibson 
before (on Conspiracy Theory). The film is intended to be a darkly 
humorous and slick thriller, along the lines of Get Shorty, but with 
more violence (The tagline is " Get ready to root for the Bad 
Guy").There are a few problems with this approach. The first is that 
this movie is rather violent, with plenty of killing. Since some of the 
film's punchlines involve somebody dying violently, it makes the average 
viewer a little uncomfortable about laughing at such moments. A subplot 
involving a female sadomasochist offers the audience the opportunity to 
laugh at her taking a beating; a dubious pleasure. </P>
<P>To say that most of the film's characters are not very smart is an 
understatement - some of the most stupid bad guys ever committed to 
celluloid reside within Payback. Porter wants revenge and his share of 
the money from the Chinese heist. Unfortunately (both for him and almost 
everyone else he meets), Resnick has used to money to pay off a crime 
syndicate which is led by a smooth talking mobster called Carter (played 
as an oily smoothie by William Devane). Carter decides to have Porter 
killed to avoid any problems for his organisation. Porter also attracts 
the attention of a couple of crooked detectives, Hicks and Leary (played 
unsuccessfully for laughs by Bill Dukes and Jack Conly)who want the 
money, and the Chinese mobsters themselves are also hunting Porter 
(whose depiction would be racist except that everyone gets a raw deal in 
this movie).</P>
<P>Porter's various efforts to get his money back are both clever and 
stupid, sometimes both within the same scene. The film also relies 
too much on coincidence (never a good sign in a movie). Raymond Chandler 
(who scripted classics such as The Big Sleep and Double Indemnity) used 
to claim that, whenever he got stuck on a plot detail, he would 'invent 
a body', figuring that he could explain it away later in his story. 
Helgeland seems to have the same approach, but his script lacks the dry 
wit or style of Chandler. </P>
<P>The film lacks the courage of its own convictions, too. Porter's wife 
is his first target but he doesn't get to kill her (she dies 
accidentally, from a drug overdose). Even his encounter with his former 
partner, Resnick, is more self-defence than cold-blooded revenge. Sure, 
Porter gets to kill a few defenceless people later in the film, but 
since they were really bad guys, the audience doesn't mind so much. 
Gibson seems unsure whether his character is supposed to be sympathetic 
or scary. The result is that he is neither.</P>
<P>I never though I would ever write this sentence but what this movie 
needs is Bruce Willis. Mel Gibson is just not convincing as a ruthless 
gangster obsessed with murder and revenge, and his ability to take 
constant beatings, gunshot wounds and torture recall his adventures as 
Detective Martin Riggs. Willis, for all his flaws, could have played 
this with more tongue-in-cheek.</P>
<P>If Helgeland has taken Point Blank (John Boorman's 1967 classic, with 
Lee Marvin) as his inspiration, the result is, unfortunately, Lethal 
Weapon 5. Not much of a tribute.</P>
