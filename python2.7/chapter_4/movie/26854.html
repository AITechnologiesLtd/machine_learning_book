<P>The story of 11-year old prole Billy Elliot is set in a small town 
in Northeast England in 1984. It is a grungy place like all the 
mining towns we have seen in British films. The place is not just 
joyless, it is downright depressing. I suspect it always was but now 
things have hit rock bottom.  Margaret Thatcher has ordered the 
closing of many mines because they are losing money. I suppose the 
correct term is "not cost effective" -- like Presidential Elections 
in some countries.</P>
<P>What would a certain, big slice of British cinema --the biggest one, 
the one that deals with the working classes --have done without 
Thatcherism?  One wonders.</P>
<P>The miners, that is, practically all able-bodied men in the place, 
are striking. It's a violent strike which pits them against hordes 
of police, and vice versa.</P>
<P>Billy is a schoolboy (seen just one in his class) who loves all 
sorts of pop music. It makes him kinetic. He wiggles, jumps up and 
down and moves with agility. He lives with his striking miner dad, 
his striking miner older brother Tony, and his vague, senile 
grandma. His mother is dead and sorely missed by all.</P>
<P>Billy is a good kid, takes care of grandma and some household 
chores. He goes regularly to the local (and grungy, of course) gym 
for boxing lessons, This is Dad's will and his preparation of his 
son for a tough life. But the kid is not gifted in that direction.</P>
<P>One day, after messing up his pugilism, as he lingers in the gym 
Billy chances on a lady's ballet lesson for a bunch of little girls 
in tutus. Somehow drawn to that class, he manages to join it, and is 
not only accepted by teacher Mrs. Wilkinson, but quite soon 
encouraged, then specially coached by her. She knows that she has a 
fine dancer-to-be on her hands. And she becomes, sort of, his 
surrogate mom. She is a champion chain-smoker, which strikes an 
overdone note since she could hardly dance with the kid with all the 
stuff he inhales around the clock.</P>
<P>Then again, perhaps the black-lung disease, the scourge of miners, 
may have built up in the atmosphere some sort of immunity to mere 
tobacco. Go figure. </P>
<P>The movie is discreet and does not push any of its elements. It 
moves at a slow but sensible, natural pace, even  languishing, if 
compared to the  frantic tempo of so many US films.</P>
<P>Dad is puzzled, at first worried that this is a sign of "poofiness" 
but comes to accept that the old status quo has changed.  Especially 
when, after some sturm und drang, Mrs. W. wants Billy to audition 
for the Royal Academy of Dance. Which he does, and which makes him 
officially a dancing apprentice.</P>
<P>In an awkward post-scriptum, 13 years later Dad and Tony see Billy 
dancing what I take to be a major ballet role in London, (pronounced 
Loundon).</P>
<P>Billy is as natural as they come the way he is played by Jamie Bell, 
who began to dance at age six, comes from a Northern town similar to 
that of the movie, and gives to his part a quietly original, modest 
and realistic shape.</P>
<P>He is a real find. The rest of the cast are very good. The movie 
flows quietly like the Don River with no sudden changes, no 
particularly spectacular dances. Yet the violent background of 
miners vs. police is ever present, as is the cul-de-sac future of 
the strikers. </P>
<P>Curiously, the image that I remember best is that of the 
black-uniformed police, their transparent-plastic shields and their 
ominous sticks forming a massive line -- indeed, a wall--and 
starting to beat the shields in a way that's uncannily like the 
shield-and-spear natives doing exactly the same in "Zulu" and in 
"Zulu Dawn."</P>
