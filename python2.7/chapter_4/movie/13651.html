<PRE>--------------
Little Nikita
--------------
(USA 1987)</PRE>
<P>Directed by Richard Benjamin; With River Phoenix, Sidney Poitier,
Richard Jenkins, Caroline Kava, Richard Bradford, Richard Lynch</P>
<P>Here we have just another example of two fine actors wasted in a badly
written and weakly directed film.</P>
<P>The American teenager Jeff Grant (River Phoenix) applies for the
admission into the Air Force Academy. FBI man Roy Parmenter (Sidney
Poitier) examines Jeff's particulars and stumbles on contradictory
information about Jeff's parents (played by Richard Jenkins and Caroline
Kava). At the same time Parmenter works on another case: The former KGB
agent Scuba (played by Richard Lynch), who murdered Parmenter's
colleague 20 years ago, now commits a series of murders of Russian
agents to blackmail the KGB. Then KGB agent Konstantin Karpov (Richard
Bradford), who wants to catch Scuba, is seen in Fountain Grove, the
Grant family's place of residence. That makes Parmenter conjecture that
Jeff's parents are Russian spies. His investigations confirm this
suspicion. Jeff doesn't know of the espionage job of his parents. When
he is told of it by Roy, with whom he has made friends, he gets
thunderstruck. His parents - Russian spies?! Jeff's parents have been
living the life of ordinary American people for 20 years. They run a
garden nursery in Fountain Grove and use the false family name Grant.
Now KGB man Karpov instructs them, who are also potential victims of
Scuba, to become active again. They shall help in a surrender of money
organized to catch Scuba. The Grants don't want to take part. But Karpov
forces them by kidnapping Jeff ...</P>
<P>What may sound like an interesting idea, gets a disappointing film here.
"Little Nikita" doesn't nearly exhaust the opportunities of the subject.
It convinces neither on the level of Jeff's and his parents' identity
problems, nor in its treatment of the Cold War, nor is it a suspenseful
spy thriller.</P>
<P>The main problem of the film is its really weak screenplay (by Bo
Goldman and John Hill). We are told little about Jeff's girlfriend
although she doesn't seem unimportant in Jeff's life. The characters of
the parents aren't paid enough attention. The Russians are degraded to
cartoon characters. In short: The film can't be considered a serious
work. Yet it could have become an exciting film. It hasn't. The
screenplay is overly constructed and full of improbable incidents
leading to a totally unbelievable finale.</P>
<P>Another fatal problem is Richard Benjamin's clumsy direction, especially
in the action scenes of the film. An example is the weakly filmed scene,
in which Scuba makes a woman be run over by a ship. The directorial
flaws in the last 20 minutes of the film are much more serious than in
this scene. Benjamin's direction makes the implausible finale even more
absurd.</P>
<P>It is due to River Phoenix and Sidney Poitier that "Little Nikita" isn't
completely unwatchable. They give the film some interest and a little
bit suspense. Phoenix' performance is solid, partially fascinating,
although he sometimes tends to overacting here. His interpretation of
Jeff Grant hasn't the accuracy of his excellent performances in "Stand
by Me" (1986), "Running on Empty" (1987), "Dogfight" (1991) and "My Own
Private Idaho" (1991). Sidney Poitier is also quite good in the role of
the FBI man Parmenter.</P>
<P>There are some references to the bilateral policy of détente between the
Eastern and Western blocs. But to treat this theme convincingly it would
have needed a serious dealing instead of clichés.</P>
<P>After all "Little Nikita" is a disappointing film with some
entertainment value thanks to the two leads.</P>
<P>To all those who want to see better films starring River Phoenix, I
especially recommend the following film in his filmography, Sidney
Lumet's masterpiece "Running on Empty" (1987) in which Phoenix gives one
of the best performances of his career.</P>
<P>I give "Little Nikita" still a ** rating on the Maltin scale of four
stars.</P>
