<P>   As the ditty has it, "Hinomous, honomis,/ Woman's
monogamous. Honomis, hinomous,/ Man is polygamous.  It's
a wonder that the male of the species ever accepted the
concept of marriage, which binds a man so unnaturally to a
single woman.  There comes a time in the life of every college
sophomore coed that she begins to question the wisdom,
even the truth of this saying.  Given the paucity of
monogamous relationships throughout the animal kingdom, is
it not possible that the female of the human species has
varied tastes as well?  This is the conclusion drawn by James
Toback in his risky new film, "Two Girls and a Guy," a chancy
venture in that its dialogue feels almost completely improvised
while its appropriate forum is live theater.  Frequently
materializing as an actors' exercise designed to showcase the
many talents of Robert Downey, Jr., "Two Girls and a Guy"
suffers from the claustrophobic ambience of a photographed
play and a tendency to repeat and rehash prosaic dialogue. 
Its particular appeal is in watching Downey, a master, at work,
particularly when he seems to be exorcising his own demons,
and in appreciating the facial expressions on its three
characters who are filmed by Barry Markowitz in bold closeup.</P>
<P>   "Two Girls and a Guy" recalls "The Designated Mourner,"
David Hare and Wallace Shawn's more static photographed
play with Mike Nicholas as a flawed individual who, joining a
cerebral family that takes pleasure in the arts, just doesn't get
it.  Downey, in the role of a narcissistic though down-on-his-
luck actor, is forced into a dialogue with two young women
who discover that the man has been two-timing them,
spending three nights per week with one and three nights with
the other, though insisting to each that she is his exclusive
lover.</P>
<P>   A more conventional story would have the girls seeking
revenge on the duplicitous performer, who touches our
heartstrings each time he shows his concern for his dying
mother and tickles our funnybones when backed to the wall
by his interrogating girl friends.  Toback, who has written the
script which he directs almost completely within a spankingly
decorated Manhattan loft, takes on a different center.  His
women want simply to know why their man insists on seeing
two different, lovely creatures, and while receiving only a
fragmented answer to their query, they wonder why he simply
did not tell each of them the truth.</P>
<P>   As a date movie, "Two Girls and a Guy" might have the
young men in the audience squirming as they recognize some
of the lines they traditionally feed their dates.  Blake, as the
Downey character is known, has relied on hackneyed phrases
which had been surprisingly accepted by each woman,
expressions such as "I never experienced real love before I
met you," and "You own my [sexual member]."  Lou (Natasha
Gregson Wagner) and Carla (Heather Graham), in turn,
respond with "I thought you loved me, I really did," and "He
showed how helpless he was in the grips of overwhelming
passion."</P>
<P>   As the camera pans about the loft--which features lots of
space on a bare, polished wooden floor, Japanese curtains
separating the bedroom from the living area, a grand piano on
which rest a picture of Blake's mother and another of his girl
friend du jour--it rests on two provocative scenes which are
almost embarrassing in their intensity.  In one situation, Blake
looks in his bathroom mirror and sheds a tear while intoning,
"When are you going to shape up," a line which will have the
cognoscenti in the audience wondering whether he is talking
about Robert Downey Jr. as much as about Blake.  In
another, an extended sexual sequence between Carla
(Heather Graham) and Blake in the bedroom, we watch the
steamy progression filmed in shadowy dimness while the
camera frequently pans outside to show Lou sitting just
outside, listening to everything without showing signs of envy.</P>
<P>   Heather Graham is stunning to look at and provides a foil
for the cuter, if less beautiful streetwise Wagner.  Downey
turns in a forceful and varied performance as foiled lover,
Shakespearean actor, and concerned son.  On the whole,
however, "Two Girls and a Guy" is a work for the stage and
could use pruning and a tighter script even at a fairly brief 92
minutes.  Rated R.  Running Time: 92 minutes.  (C) 1998
