<PRE>                            GAS, FOOD, LODGING
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>104 min., R, Drama, 1992
Director: Allison Anders
Cast: Brooke Adams, Ione Skye, Fairuza Balk, Robert Knepper,      
      Donovan Leitch, David Lansbury, Chris Mulkey, James Brolin, 
      Julie Condra</P>
<P>     Brooke Adams is a waitress at a truck stop.  Her husband, James
Brolin, has moved out of the house and left her with two girls, Ione
Skye and Fairuza Balk.  Skye spends her time skipping high school and
having sex with men.  Balk spends her time either trying to fix up Adams
with other men, or trying to get in contact with Brolin.</P>
<P>     I read a preview of GAS, FOOD, LODGING in PREMIERE magazine during
the summer and I have been waiting for it to be released in my area.  It
just came, and so I rushed out to see it.  I had high hopes for this
film, and I am pleased to say that the film lived up to them.  I highly
recommend that you try to see this film, in the theater if possible, and
if not, off video cassette when it is released.  On a scale of zero to
five, I give GAS, FOOD, LODGING a five.  GAS, FOOD, LODGING is rated R
for explicit language, adult situations, and female nudity.</P>
<P>     All the actresses and actors in this film do a great job.   Brooke
Adams (SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK) is excellent as the girls' mother.  Her
performance showed the stress from raising Ione Skye's character, while
trying to show love for her.  Ione Skye (SAY ANYTHING...)  is
exceptional as Brooke Adams' troubled daughter.   She shows the
resentment that she has for her mother, but the love that exists between
her and her sister Fairuza Balk, even though it is not always shown by
Skye.  Fairuza Balk is very good as Brooke Adams' other daughter.  Most
of the things that happen in this film, happen to Balk.  She is
constantly looking for a father figure so that she can have a complete
family.  She learns about love and loss through the course of the film.
James Brolin (THE AMITYVILLE HORROR) does a good job as Brooke Adams'
ex-husband.  He has to face his fear and go visit his children, of whom
at least one wants to see him.</P>
<P>     GAS, FOOD, LODGING is very well written.  The film never gets slow,
boring, or tedious.  The characters are extremely well written and kept
my interest throughout the entire film.  I found myself caring for the
people in the film, wanting to see what would happen to them.  The
locations used are great.  Especially the desert scenes.  They really
add to the quality of the film.</P>
