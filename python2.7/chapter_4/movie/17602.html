<P>Susan Granger's review of "THE-OUT-OF-TOWNERS" (Paramount Pictures)</P>
<P>Back in 1970, Jack Lemmon and the late Sandy Dennis made this
movie about what went wrong for two midwestern visitors on a business
trip to New York City. Written by Neil Simon and directed by Arthur
Hiller, the misadventure worked because the comedy was firmly rooted
in everyday reality.  This new version, far from being a re-make, is a
glossy, flashy star-vehicle for Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin, two
clever sophisticates not even remotely believable as Nancy and Henry
Clark from Ohio. Both Sam Weisman's direction and Marc Lawrence's
script are forced beyond redemption. Looking impossibly young, trim
and beautiful, albeit in soft-focus, Goldie plays Nancy, a middle-aged
woman going through "empty-nest" blues after the departure of her
youngest child (played by Oliver Hudson, her real-life son), while
Steve's Henry is advertising executive who has just been fired. Faced
with an uncertain future in suburbia, they're both edgy, which is why
she decides to tag along when he goes to Manhattan for a job
interview. Immediately, things go wrong. Their plane is diverted to
Boston; their luggage gets lost; they miss the last New York-bound
train; they wreck their rental car in the Fulton Fish Market; they
fall for a street scam and get robbed by a con-man who claims to be
Andrew Lloyd Webber. And that's just the beginning. Reunited for the
first time since "HouseSitter" (1992), bubbly Goldie and resourceful
Steve demonstrate their undeniable talent for physical comedy - and
John Cleese hams it up as a supercilious hotel manager - but no one
can save this painfully strained film from being a great
disappointment. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The
Out-of-Towners" is genial but tiresome 4. It's a feeble downer.</P>
