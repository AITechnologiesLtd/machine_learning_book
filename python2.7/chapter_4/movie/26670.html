<PRE>THE LITTLE VAMPIRE
A film review by James Brundage
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>Just when you thought movies couldn't get any more ridiculous, along
comes a film that poses the question, "Did Dracula ever have a teddy
bear?"  I'm talking, of course, about The Little Vampire, a movie about
a nuclear family of vampires that feed on cows, live in Scotland, and
make friends with the little kid from Jerry Maguire.</P>
<P>In The Little Vampire, Jonathan Lipnicki plays Tony Thompson, recent
émigré to the Highlands.  Rather than go the traditional route for
Scottish fantasy and pick up a wooden sword and proclaim, "There can be
only one," Tony begins dreaming of vampires.  Night after night, Tony's
slumber is disturbed as he dreams of a rite being performed by a clan of
vampires.  What it means, Tony has no clue.  So Tony simply does what
any other eight-year old stereotyped by cinema does: Goes to mommy
(Pamela Gidley) and daddy (Tommy Hinkley), sleeps in their bed for the
night, and then gets ridiculed by everyone he knows for his "wild
vampire fantasies" during the day.</P>
<P>Lo and behold, one night a guy named Rudolf (Rollo Weeks) happens upon
Tony incanting what he heard in the dream, and before the night is
through the two have saved each other's life, fed on cows, and played on
top of a blimp.</P>
<P>Should I even bother telling you at this point that The Little Vampire
is kiddie fare?</P>
<P>As kiddie fare goes, The Little Vampire is actually one of the more
imaginative offerings in recent memory.  In a highly vapid genre, The
Little Vampire injects a quasi-sardonic imagination (and sense of humor)
into the field  There are enjoyable running gags (such as the vampiric
cows who disappear one-by-one, much to the chagrin of the forlorn
farmer) and a storyline that doesn't absolutely reek.  Sadly, the rest
of the film doesn't fare quite so well.</P>
<P>In fact, the rest of the film runs rather hot and cold.  One minute, the
acting is terrific, the next minute, you're wondering if this is the
players' first film.  One minute, the humor is sidesplitting, the next
it's too melodramatic to stand.  In the end, The Little Vampire is
really only a good film if you view it next to a contemporary like, say,
Pokemon.  Without that, it's just another movie to float into the mist
of mediocre cinema.</P>
