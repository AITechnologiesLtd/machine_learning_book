<P>The very Gallic writer-director Andre Techine has a special niche in 
his country's cinema. It is not easily defined or classifiable. He 
tends to make novelistic movies in which aestheticism and lyricism 
mix with the psychology of the characters. Techine is also an actors' 
director. He has baffled certain critics, been praised by others. 
It's a mixed picture.</P>
<P>Techine's best works have a strong record of awards in festivals such 
as Cannes (a host of nominations and one win as Best Director); at 
the Caesars (French Oscars), with four wins (including French film, 
Director, Screenplay, etc. In the USA his "Wild Reeds" was voted best 
foreign-language movie by the New York, the Los Angeles, and the 
National Societies of Critics.</P>
<P>"Alice and Martin" is his 17th feature (out of 18). The three 
features preceding it were "My Favorite Season," "Wild Reeds," and 
"The Thieves" all major hits. "Alice and Martin" however has had 
reviews that range from positive to ho-hum.</P>
<P>In a small town of Southwest France, hairdresser Jeanine lives with 
her 10-year old son Martin, an illegitimate child. Without 
explanation except "it's time you met your father" she packs off 
Martin to elderly industrialist Victor. The latter has an also 
elderly wife--and three boys with her.</P>
<P>Jump 10 years ahead. Martin, now 20, is seen disheveled, wandering 
about the country side, looking  crazy, stealing chickens and eggs. 
He ends up in a police station where we learn that Victor had an 
accident and died. The police does not connect this death with 
Martin's most bizarre behavior, and does not even hold him for 
raiding chicken coops. It is all extremely vague, in fact confusing 
and unconvincing.  This is the start of a film that will continue 
making the audience wonder about who, when, why, how.</P>
<P>Cut to the strange Martin showing up suddenly in Paris.. (Did  he 
have train-ticket money in his shabby clothes?) He looks up his 
half-brother Benjamin who is gay and an aspiring actor but  currently 
works in a large store, hand scanning people at the exit. (I think 
this is also symbolism but of  what, I cannot tell). At a cafe a 
woman accosts Martin, hands him her business card and leaves. She, it 
turns out later, is in the advertising business.</P>
<P>Benjamin shares a minuscule apartment with Alice, about 35 -- a 
violinist whom the director describes as "repressed."
She hardly survives through a variety of musical gigs. (One of her 
best lines::" Other music wants to heal wounds. Tango keeps them 
open.")</P>
<P>Alice sounds like a good, serious musician, but how good we do not 
know. It is interesting to follow her haphazard professional 
activities in classical and in popular music, but if the subtext 
includes a criticism of talents that go begging, Techine does not 
insist on the artist-in-a-garret theme, one that is true, but alas, 
also banal.</P>
<P>Martin now shares Benjamins-Alice cramped lodgings.   Remember the 
woman with the card? Thanks to it Martin   becomes, overnight it 
would seem (by time is unclear in this film) a hit as a model. He 
makes very good money (is this a satire of the advertising business? 
Unclear)  He can pay the rent. (Ask not how three people and a cat 
can fit in the space).</P>
<P>Now too, for reasons equally foggy, he stalks Alice. What is 
understood however is that the young man has psychological problems. 
Alice too but not uncommon ones.  As the two talk, she relates  a 
rather cock-and-bull story about her young sister who had an 
incredible memory that   suddenly drained out when she had a brain 
tumor. The girl died at age 11. And so on. Such confidences 
apparently make A and M draw closer to each other. They become a 
couple, and couples copulate, of course. Yet, while the act is sudden 
and energetic, it is not particularly sexy. And there is no strong 
evidence of " l'amour fou."</P>
<P>Martin has a photo shoot in Spain. Alice comes along. There she has 
symptoms of pregnancy while Martin  keels over from psychic 
disturbances, is hospitalized, loses his job. The twosome stay in a 
middle-of-nowhere seashore area of Spain. Martin is getting 
antagonistic, wants to stop the affair, swims at night in ominous 
waves. They have no money left.</P>
<P>A flashback to Victor leads us to Martin killing his dad. This 
explains his mental state and feelings of guilt. Throughout. we spend 
our time figuring out things. We become like the film characters who 
grope with people and feelings. There's much more of this  in Spain, 
in small-town France, in Paris and in a mental hospital outside 
Paris. And more yet.</P>
<P>But I will not reveal anything else about the story, the odd 
behaviors and the semi-closures. It seems to me that director Techine 
is really artistic, sincere and a believer in his 
creatures/creations. But the story, people, techniques and, what in 
Techine's mind are subtleties, tend to confuse us -- and must have 
adversely affected him, so that he did not look objectively at what 
he was doing.</P>
<P>There are several portrayals that flesh out the events. And they 
score points. But the overall structure is such that it would take a 
second viewing to "get into" the movie and its virtues.</P>
<P>There is also Juliette Binoche, a major star. She has been in films 
by Godard, Techine, Carax, Malle, Rappeneau, Kurys, and other major 
"auteurs." Even more notably she had the lead role in Kieslowski's 
superb "Three Colors: Blue," for which she won Best Actress at the 
Felix, the Caesar and the Venice Awards. Then came her Oscar for Best 
Supporting Actress (in "The English Patient.")</P>
<P>Juliette Binoche is celebrated for her talent in showing feelings, 
reactions, thoughts and the like through eloquent body and especially 
facial expressions. For "A and M," Techine, who compares her to the 
great Lilian Gish of silent movies' fame, wanted to give Ms. Binoche 
a part that would stress her speaking. He did, by in my opinion, not 
far enough.</P>
<P>Her Alice is Alice in Wonderland, but in the sense that the 
spectators wonder about what's going on.</P>
<P>Alex Loret who plays Martin, makes here his feature debut. The others 
are on the unfamiliar side, with the exception of Spanish actress 
Carmen Maura. She has appeared in almost 70 films since 1969, mostly 
Spanish (several by Pedro Almodovar,) some French. But here her 
character is sketchy and without the fire and agitation of her best 
roles.</P>
<P>French movies can be "la creme de la creme" in showing psyches and 
brains, complex relationships and behaviors, family matters and 
conversations, intimate relations, people and situations as they 
really are. But those characteristics can also go sometimes with 
obscurities, opaqueness, over-intellectualism, bizarre constructions, 
unraveled threads and loose ends.</P>
<P>"Alice and Martin" has beautiful photography but is a tortuous and 
tortured work, with people who can neither make contact among 
themselves or with the audience. It  kept me at arm's distance, 
although it could be that a repeat screening might remedy some of 
that.</P>
