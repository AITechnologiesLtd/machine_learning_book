<P>Tango is the kind of balletic dance that infuses sex and mystery in equal
parts, and is traditionally performed by a man and a woman. It necessitates
coordination and skill and lots of practice, like any other dance. Carlos
Saura's film, "Tango," is an attempt to understand the history of tango mixed
in with personal relationships and creative talents to produce a film on tango.
It is not a complete success, but it is a visually luscious trip. </P>
<P>Miguel Angel Sola plays Mario Sanchez, a filmmaker who feels his private life
is in a state of confusion. His former wife, Laura Fuentes (Cecilia Narova), is
living with another man, though Mario still loves her. Laura is also a tango
dancer, and is part of the troupe who will perform in Mario's theatrical
presentation on the history of tango. A rich gangster, Angelo Larroca (Juan
Luis Galiardo), gives Mario a new recruit, an especially attractive dancer,
Elena Flores (Mia Maestro), who eventually has an affair with Mario. Naturally,
Angelo loves Elena and if he discovers she is having an affair, it will result
in death. </P>
<P>"Tango" is imminently watchable when it shows us the pure tango dances against
creative, color backgrounds. There are silhouettes, flashes of color, and just
about every other camera trick you can imagine from the imaginative
cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, an active collaborator of Bernardo
Bertolucci's. I also love the moments when we witness the preparation of the
production itself, the set design and the choreography of the movements of the
dancers, etc. These are the moments that count, but the human interest level is
at a minimum. </P>
<P>I wanted to know more about the middle-aged, flamboyant dancer Carlos Nebbia
(well-played by Juan Copes) and his tango desires. I also wanted to know more
about Mario Sanchez and the relationships with these women. There is one
effective scene where he has a dinner date with Elena and he tries to explain
his feelings about men and women, and fails to make sense. There is also a hint
of Mario's imagination unfolding before our eyes, like when we see him
inattentive as a young boy in school or when he envisions a strikingly sexy
dance in silhouette while he blows the fan to create the mood. But these are
all hints of character development and nothing more. </P>
<P>Perhaps I expected more from director Carlos Saura, who made the flamenco
masterpiece "Carmen," a film of unbridled passions in every sense of the word
and strong characters. If you want tango dancing and colorful, imaginative
landscapes of color and sound, "Tango" is the film for you. If you like some
human involvement and a meatier story, look elsewhere. </P>
