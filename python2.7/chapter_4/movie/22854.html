<P>Picture this: It's the last weekend of January 2000, and every film I have 
seen in theaters that was released this month has been bad (i.e. "Next 
Friday," "Supernova," "Down to You"). They say that the first month of the 
year is a motion picture dead zone for quality, but I am still understandably 
growing worried. But then I stumble upon a rather peculiar film, one that may 
be uneven on certain levels and, by no means, not imperfect, but that is 
simply too audacious and original to ignore, and leaves me thinking about it 
for the remainder of the evening and the next day. The name of that movie is 
"Eye of the Beholder," directed by Stephan Elliott (1994's "Priscilla, Queen 
of the Desert"), and when a wealth of movies in the genre are so disposable, 
as you can just forget all about them once they are over, this one actually 
has a mind to go along with its mysterious storyline, and could easily be one 
of the most thought-provoking thrillers in a long while. </P>
<P>"Eye of the Beholder" takes a lot of risks, particularly for a film that is 
being released wide on opening weekend. Because it doesn't take the road you 
would always expect from a thriller; because Ashley Judd is not playing the 
completely virtuous heroine; because the film is relatively deliberate in its 
pacing and there isn't very much action, per se; and because Elliott relies 
on stylish camera techniques and the visual aspect of the story, as opposed 
to buildings blowing up and dialogue spelling out the plot developments for 
you, the picture is in danger of isolating many mainstream audiences 
expecting another "Double Jeopardy." That's too bad, for those interested in 
a more unconventional film that doesn't always play by the rules will find 
themselves rewarded with a deeper, more texturally layered thriller than they 
are usually accustomed to.  </P>
<P>The ball gets rolling when a British intelligence agent in Washington, D.C., 
known by his code name, Eye (Ewan McGregor), is assigned to track down the 
22-year-old son of a government official, who is suspected of being 
blackmailed by an inscrutably alluring woman (Ashley Judd). Spying on them at 
the son's home, Eye becomes the only witness to his murder, as the woman 
repeatedly stabs him to death and then disposes of his body in a nearby lake. 
Eye, whose wife and child were allegedly "lost," still envisions his young 
daughter around him, and thus, feels inexplicably drawn to this woman who, 
herself, is clearly lost, and begins to follow her everywhere she goes, from 
NYC to San Francisco, to Death Valley, to Philadelphia, to Chicago, to 
Alaska, all the while leaving death in her wake. Wanting to know more about 
her, Eye learns from an unusual therapist (Genevieve Bujold), who used to 
care for her, that her real name is Joanna Eris, and it was she who taught 
Joanna how to constantly disguise her true self, both physically and 
emotionally. But Joanna is a confused, almost tragic figure, even while 
being, more or less, a serial killer, and there are hints throughout that her 
relationship with her own father as a child was relatively unstable.   </P>
<P>Although a thriller, "Eye of the Beholder" also offers an utterly odd, yet 
effective romance, as Eye realizes Joanna is a murderer, but somehow deeply 
sympathizes with her. Since Eye is missing a child, and Joanna is a lost 
soul, there is an instant connection on his part, and Joanna strangely feels 
it too, even when she doesn't even know he is following her, and has never 
met him. Basically, both Eye and Joanna are little more than enigmas at the 
beginning, but the more that is learned about their unfortunate pasts and 
their beings, the more easily understood both of their actions are. And 
without giving anything away, when Eye and Joanna inevitably do meet, there 
is an unmistakable poignancy that charms us, all the while making us nervous 
since we know Joanna is capable of doing many bad things, even when she 
doesn't want to.</P>
<P>Kudos to writer-director Stephan Elliott and director of photography Guy 
Dufaux for making a motion picture that is such an invigorating treat for the 
eyes, and a testament to their imaginations. When the setting changes from 
one place to the next, for example, the camera zooms in on that particularly 
city's snow globe and enters right into it, until what is in the globe 
transforms effortlessly to the real place. Eye voyeuristically spies on 
Joanna with his advanced audio and video equipment, and occasionally the 
camera will be centered on the grainy television of Joanna's hotel room, 
until it goes right into the T.V. and ends up literally in her room. "Eye of 
the Beholder" is a stylistically brilliant film, never ceasing to impress 
with its gorgeous, energetic visuals.</P>
<P>While Eye and Joanna are satisfactorily developed throughout, some of their 
motivations remain a little sketchy, leaving it up to the viewer to decide 
the "why's" for themselves, which sometimes works but here just feels like 
minor plot holes. Joanna, who occasionally breaks down crying after doing 
away with another innocent victim, is a severely unhinged woman, but why is 
that? And what does her killing spree substitute that is missing in her life? 
When Eye keeps seeing his daughter and carrying on conversations with her, it 
works well because of its eerie supernatural implications, but doesn't give 
us enough of a reason for why he can see her. Does he imagine it because of 
his otherwise solitary existence? Or is he delusional? These questions and 
others are unavoidably brought up because we never learn the answers, but 
better to be left pondering a film after it is over, rather than forgetting 
it altogether, which is what the majority of today's thrillers do.</P>
<P>Ashley Judd is a class act in every film she appears in, and she is even able 
to turn mediocrity into something slightly more successful than it has any 
right to be ("Double Jeopardy"). Since her stunning debut performance in 
1993's "Ruby in Paradise," Judd has been on an unbroken road to stardom, and 
does not disappoint here. Joanna is a flawed woman (after all, she does kill 
people), but she desperately wants to change and lead a normal life, and Judd 
turns her into a likable character, or at least one that we care about. 
Midway through, Joanna has a run-in with a kind, older blind man (Patrick 
Bergin) at the airport, and because he cares about her without having to see 
her, she falls in love with him. There is a touching scene in which Joanna 
explains to him that he may be older, but she loves him no matter what 
because her physical appearance doesn't matter to him. In other words, he 
will never be able to see the "monster" she has let herself become in life.</P>
<P>Ewan McGregor has a less showy role, since he is voyeur to his subject, which 
is Joanna, but McGregor is worlds above his misguided, underwritten turn in 
"The Phantom Menace." He believably is able to project the loss of his loved 
ones, and while the idea of him falling in love with this killer he has 
followed but never even met is, perhaps, difficult to swallow, it 
surprisingly makes sense. Gazing warmly at Joanna from afar, Eye longs to be 
with her, to comfort her sort of as a father figure, and McGregor creditably 
helps to make this plot development work. </P>
<P>In supporting roles, Genevieve Bujold is excellent, even while only given two 
scenes, as she turns her character into more than just a one-dimensional 
figure. Pop singer k.d. Lang shows up as Eye's friend and embassy contact, 
and proves to hold a real screen presence. And Jason Priestley is 
appropriately slimy and intense as a drug addict who picks Joanna's up in the 
desert when her car breaks down.</P>
<P>The final scene in "Eye of the Beholder" is one I haven't quite figured out 
my feelings on yet. It is certainly not an upbeat, mainstream conclusion, and 
will turn off many viewers, but in its own way is just the right way to end 
the film. Both Joanna and Eye have very little to live for, except for each 
other, which makes the proceedings all the more lamentable. They are at the 
end of their ropes, desperately attempting to cling to one another even when 
they don't have the means to do such a thing. "Eye of the Beholder" is a 
sleek, impressively well-made movie, a lyrical flower in a bed of January 
thorns, if you will. It is simply too admirable a film on too many levels to 
be thrown to the wayside.</P>
