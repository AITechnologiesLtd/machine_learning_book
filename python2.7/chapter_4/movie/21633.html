<P>_Light_It_Up_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>_Light_It_Up_, written and directed by Craig Bolotin, is different from
most urban dramas in that in emphasizes ideas more than violence; in
fact, the quantity of the latter is surprisingly low for its genre.  But
it's too bad that not many other things about the film are quite so
distinctive.</P>
<P>Bolotin's setup, however, is rather interesting in its complication.  A
popular teacher (Judd Nelson) at Lincoln High is put on suspension after
taking his class off-campus without permission.  His students, led by
star b-baller Lester (Usher Raymond) and senior class president Stephanie
(Rosario Dawson), confront the principal (Glynn Turman) in protest,
indirectly leading to a physical struggle between artist Ziggy (Robert
Ri'chard) and the on-campus cop, Dante Jackson (Forest Whitaker).  A
bullet is fired; Jackson is wounded in the leg; and Lester finds himself
with the gun, holding the cop hostage.  Soon, Lester, Stephanie, and
Ziggy, along with drug dealer Rivers (Clifton Collins Jr.), gang member
Rodney (Fredro Starr), and pregnant outcast Lynn (Sara Gilbert)--now
dubbed "the Lincoln 6"--find themselves being listened to for the first
time.</P>
<P>Neglected but largely well-meaning inner city youths come into a
position of power.  It's a promising premise, but before long
_Light_It_Up_ devolves into cliché.  The hostage talks his captor into
giving him a drink of water, only to attempt physical harm.  The popular
girl and the outcast set aside their differences and learn to cooperate. 
Most annoying, however, is Lester's "dark secret," which points to a
deeper personal grudge against the police--as if there needed to be added
justification for his rebellion.</P>
<P>Raymond's popularity as an R&B crooner is undoubtedly the justification
Bolotin had in casting him as the lead, but that proves to not be a good
enough reason.  Raymond does a fairly adequate job (though his emotional
scenes are rather strained), but he doesn't have the forceful,
charismatic presence needed to convince as the ringleader of a group of
such headstrong individuals.  It's not terribly believable that Raymond's
Lester can keep the hotheaded Rodney in check.  Dawson has the strongest,
most composed presence of the six, and she gives Stephanie a steely yet
vulnerable confidence that Raymond's Lester clearly lacks.</P>
<P>Thankfully, Bolotin's wrapup to _Light_It_Up_, while not completely free
of convention, resolves the film's issues in a realistic and satisfying
manner.  There is no idealistic happy ending; hard lessons are learned by
all, and through them comes an inspiring sense of hope.  If only all of
_Light_It_Up_ lived up to that conclusion.</P>
