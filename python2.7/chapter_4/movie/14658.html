<P>   There are two kinds of students who drop out of high
school or get kicked out on their ear: the dullards who just
can't cut it and are likely to be disciplinary problems; and the
real brains, like chess champ Bobby Fischer, who are
understandably bored out of their minds by instructors who
can't teach them anything.  Max Fischer, whose name is
perhaps inspired by the chess wizard, is of the latter variety,
an obsessed tenth-grader who expends so much effort
spreading himself thin on extracurricular activities that he is
failing his classes.  "Rushmore," the story of Max's
sophomore year in high school, details the yarn in such a
vivid way that it stands as one of the most refreshing movies
of the year. Though directed by a mature adult, it's the sort of
story they annually try to put on in New York's annual Young
Playwrights Festival but never quite succeed in conveying
the polish that director Wes Anderson brings to a script
written by him and Owen Wilson.  Nor did the Young
Playwrights Festival ever capture the spirit of an idiosyncratic
15-year-old the way first-timer Jason Schwartzman does.</P>
<P>  Now, this is no ordinary tale of a kid whose brain and
ambition are outsized for his school.  Max's dilemma is that
he's in love with a twenty-something teacher, Rosemary
Cross (Olivia Williams), who towers over him in height and
poise but is barely a match for her youthful lover's attentions. 
What gives "Rushmore" its comic overlay is the presence of
Bill Murray as millionaire steel magnate, Herman Blume, his
rival for the affections of the first-grade teacher at Rushmore
Academy, whom he convinces to build a huge aquarium on
the prep school's campus as Max's dedication to the lovely,
bemused lass.</P>
<P>   A perceptive movie audience will immediately detect the
relationship between "Rushmore" and Wes Anderson's first
project, "Bottle Rocket," a 1996 low-key comedy about two
young, thwarted pals who try to embark on a life of crime. 
Like "Rushmore," Mr. Anderson's earlier venture is quirky but
accessible: this time around he's likely to connect to anyone
who has ever considered himself not an outsider but a person
so inside that he consistently finds himself in a heap of
trouble.  It's also for a congregation for whom a film like "The
Mighty" is just too conventional--for all its pseudo-imaginative
images of King Arthur and his knights.</P>
<P>   Anderson begins his story in a math class as Max, eyes
glazed-over in Walter Mitty mode, fantasizes a solution his
math teacher's problem--one which, the instructor informs the
class--was not solved even by M.I.T.'s Dr. Leaky.  After
finding the answer (in his daydream) Max is filmed in various
vignettes in his role as editor of the French club, and an
officer in such diverse activities as fencing, debating,
German, Astronomy and dodgeball.  He makes the
acquaintance of Rushmore's chief benefactor, steel tycoon
Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), who ultimately agrees to fund the
aquarium in Max's--and later Blume's--sweetheart's honor. 
When Max is finally expelled from Rushmore, he goes into
virtual combat with the much older Blume, a kind of love-hate
relationship, a knight determined to conquer his foe and win
his lady's hand.</P>
<P>   Jason Schwartzman is ideal in the role of the nerdy guy
who asserts himself everywhere, is overconfident (he
convinces himself that he will apply to Oxford and the
Sorbonne, with Harvard as his safety), with a toned-down Bill
Murray fitting the role of an unhappy millionaire whose buddy-
buddy relationship with a high-school kid shows that he wants
a new start in life.  (It's a healthy affiliation--after all, this is
not a Todd Solondz movie.)  Seymore Cassel stands in as a
supportive father, a barber whose son passes him off to his
friends as a neurosurgeons but who takes a large stride
toward maturity when he ultimately introduces him proudly for
what he is.  Olivia Williams's girl-next-door role charms.  She
appreciates the 15-year-old's attentions while warding off his
aggressivness, but is undoubtedly grateful to him for
introducing her to the steel tycoon.  </P>
<P>   Incidentally as plays-within-movies go, you'd look hard to
find a funnier, zestier example than the second-graders'
reenactment of the Vietnam War which pretty much
concludes the show.</P>
