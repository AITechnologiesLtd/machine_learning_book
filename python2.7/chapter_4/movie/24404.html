<P>Starring Sandra Bullock, Viggo Mortensen, Dominic West, Elizabeth
Perkins, Steve Buscemi, Alan Tyduk. Directed by Betty Thomas. Rated PG-
13.</P>
<P>I often wonder why so many writers choose a mental institution of some
sort as the setting for their movie. The most plausible explanation is
the potential for quirky supporting characters -- you need look no
further for colorful personalities than a group of basketcases and
preferably drug addicted ones. It also gives a screenwriter a picture-
perfect set-up for an ordinary-person-placed-in-group-of-eccentric-
misfits plot, a favorite in Hollywood for years. The quitessential
mental hospital movie is, of course, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest;
there have since been many imitators. The latest entry into the genre
is the Sandra Bullock vehicle 28 Days, a superficially entertaining
drama that doesn't bother to expand on its concept much beyond a
skeleton. The characters are enjoyable; the plot is wafer-thin.</P>
<P>In this version, Bullock plays Gwen Cummings, a happy-go-lucky
alcoholic who doesn't realize that she has a problem until she falls on
her sister's wedding cake and, in an effort to find a replacement,
crashes the "just married" limousine into a house. In her trial, which
the film (for better or worse) skips over, she is sentenced to either
28 days of drug rehab or the equivalent time in jail. Not wishing to
spend time in the slammer, Gwen understandably chooses the former. She
arrives at the Serenity Glen Rehabilitation Center where people
basically chant 24/7 (as a substitute for prayer, she is told). Of
course, she's high above all of these freaks, utterly convinced that
she can stop using any time she wants to.</P>
<P>The only person who liked Gwen the way she was before rehab was her
boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West). He comes to visit Gwen at Serenity
Glen, taking her out on boatrides and the like, never forgetting to
bring along a bottle of champagne. This is about the time when Gwen
starts getting serious about kicking the habit. She resents her
boyfriend's attempts to turn her back into the mess of a person she was
before and gets involved with a baseball pitcher (Viggo Mortensen) who
is also in rehab.</P>
<P>28 Days is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: a melodramatic tale
of a woman discovering her worth as a person and that life can be good
without booze. It's nothing groundbreaking, certainly, and director
Betty Thomas (Private Parts) doesn't even suggest that there might be
something here that is beyond the self-evident. Still, there is
something to be said for a film that remains so watchable even when
it's so obviously taking all the easy ways out. This is hardly The Road
Less Traveled, but this highway is so smooth that it's a comfortable
ride.</P>
<P>The film owes its success, in large part, to the typically likable lead
performance by Sandra Bullock. We root for Gwen because Bullock makes
it so apparent that she doesn't know any better; that the only path
through life that anyone has ever shown her has been this destructive
one. As she finally begins to wise up around the middle of the movie,
we can't help but cheer her on. By the same token, Dominic West makes
Jasper an effective bastard without foaming from the mouth; we despise
him, but can imagine why Gwen was attracted to him in the first place.
The characterization is simple, but it works.</P>
<P>Probably the only undisputed triumph here is the ending, which is sweet
without being saccharine and nicely underscores the idea of positive
human interaction instead of mind-altering substances. Despite
everything, I became attached to Gwen Cummings during the course of the
movie and its conclusion made me walk out with a smile.</P>
<P>The most remarkable thing about 28 Days is that it is being marketed as
a comedy. I guess the marketers thought that no one in their right mind
would attend a drug rehab movie that's not magically hilarious so they
spliced together random clips from the film and made it seem like a
laughfest. The film is not downbeat and it isn't depressing, but it
certainly is not a comedy. As a drama, it's nothing special, but I must
admit I enjoyed it and, at times, was even touched. Maybe next time
someone will actually take some chances with the genre.</P>
