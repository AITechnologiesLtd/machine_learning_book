<P>IN SHORT: At least there's a satisfying ending</P>
<P>His brother, Donnie, was right, Mark Wahlberg can't sing. But he can
play the average middle class guy, in this case a homesick soldier,
well. Ice Cube finally delivers a good performance and George Clooney is
subtle and superb in Three Kings, in which greedy Ugly Americans learn
all about moral courage. I've said this several times on CNN, the better
movies should offer you characters that you can believe in. They should
push your buttons (good or bad) and provoke some kind of reaction --
whether it's laughter or anger -- and Three Kings provoked both in
Cranky.</P>
<P>The setting is the 1991 Gulf War, cheered by those too young to remember
Vietnam, because "we kicked Sadaam's ass," and reviled by us old folks,
liberal and conservative alike, because we didn't finish the thing and
take Sadaam Hussein down for good. David O. Russell's script for Three
Kings, inspired by a true event during the Vietnam War, doesn't dance
lightly around the politics and violence of the situation. Soldiers are
ordered to do nothing as Iraqi troops gun down their own civilians --
this after we said we'd support any uprising against said troops. Things
organic and non-organic, explode as necessary and always to make some
kind of story point. Nothing gratuitous, here, so points to Russell for
that. Politically, being the old fart that I am, my stomach was turning
to the point that it got in the way of enjoying the flick. Across the
board, after the fact, everyone I spoke with after the screening was
positive towards the movie. So I'll stay the hell away from the
political soap box as much as possible and get on with the nitty gritty.</P>
<P>The Gulf War, as we see it, is populated by enlisted men who are not
exactly the best and the brightest, enemy troops who are even dumber,
jaded Special Forces officers who want a bigger payoff and bulldog tough
television reporters with inferiority complexes. The humor in Russell's
script runs close to satire (and satire has killed three very funny
movies this year alone). His directorial style is hard core, liberally
tossing film processing and camera tricks at you, to the point that they
intrude on the telling of the tale. The strength is in his script, which
allows for redemption and a happy ending that we all hold so near and
dear to our hearts.</P>
<P>Our grunts are Army Sgt. Troy Barlow (Wahlberg), who has spent the war
doing cleaning up after the hi tech troops. As the film starts he still
hasn't notched his first kill. Still, he's the moral center, and looked
up to by Pvt. Conrad Elgin (Spike Jonze), who is illiterate,
undereducated and unemployable back home. Rounding up surrendering
solders they discover a map that Staff Sergeant Chief Elgin (Ice Cube)
believes to show the location of bunkers containing gold and other goods
Sadaam Hussein has boosted from Kuwait. Rather than turning the map over
to their Commanding Officer, they fall under the spell of Special Forces
Captain Archie Gates (Clooney) who convinces the grunts that, with a
borrowed truck and a couple of hours of AWOL time, they can go home and
never have to work a day in their lives. Materialistic to the core, it's
off to raid the bunkers.</P>
<P>Adding a bit of humor to the location is a CNN type reporter, Adriana
Cruz (Nora Dunn). Clooney's character is supposed to be leading her to
the good stories (just what we train our Green Berets to do) but Clooney
is shtupping one of Cruz' much younger, and prettier, rivals. Labeling
both of 'em as burnout cases would be kind, but would be true. The
conflict between the two – she's annoying, he doesn't want to play the
PR game, even under orders -- helps take some of the edge off the rest
of the flick.</P>
<P>This isn't a "greed is good" flick, though that's how it begins. Yes,
the gold is found. Yes, our boys stand by and do nothing as Iraqui
troops trash their own civilians (it was part of the cease fire deal, as
explained ad nauseum). Yes, the violence is graphic and sobering and
shut up the laughing audience very quickly. And, yes (finally) they do
the right thing, made even more poignant because the rest of the Army
doesn't want to.</P>
<PRE>. . .</PRE>
<P>I've been staring a the keyboards for two hours now folks. This thing is
pissing me off politically and I promised I'd stay the hell away from
that. So, goodnight.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Three Kings, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$6.00</PRE>
<P>I'll say it again. Despite skipping the bleach, Three Kings is well
made, well acted, and it sure as hell got a reaction out of this guy.
That's what I say I want 'em to do. That's what Three Kings did and why
the flick hits the "recommended" level. I also know my history, folks.</P>
<P>Films that piss me off like this invariably become monster hits, so
don't bother with the flame mail. I've seen it all before.</P>
