<P>The FBI, the media and statistics claim that the Mafia in America has 
finally lost its blood and is but a shadow of its former self. Maybe 
so. But the gangster genre in movies and TV is alive and well. The 
films are fiction, and from the looks of the recent Analyze This and 
the current Mickey Blue Eyes, the latest tendency is gansgster 
comedy. Not that it is a new genre. (Let me put in a plug for the 
very underrated Oscar (1991), from a French play. It was directed  by 
John Landis. Sylvester Stallone played Angelo Provolone)</P>
<P>Gangsters, lawmen, and historical events in films (both fictional and 
biopics)  are seldom accurate--though this does not harm the 
excellence of many productions. The recently deceased Mario Puzo made 
no bones about his books and scripts (The Godfather, The Sicilian, 
The Last Don, etc.) being imaginary creations based on research and 
not at all on familiarity with gangsters. So, from there to gangster 
comedy, the gap is not really big.</P>
<P>Here Michael Felgate (Hugh Grant) plays an urbane, very British 
auctioneer at a Manhattan house which tries to emulate Sotheby's. The 
start of the film is a most amusing auction of paintings, with witty 
remarks by Grant. There follows the lovey-dovey introduction of 
schoolteacher girlfriend Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn), leading to 
a sequence at a Chinese restaurant, a comic imbroglio involving a 
fortune cookie. Grant proposes marriage. To his dismay and 
bewilderment, Gina, without giving a reason, refuses and runs off.</P>
<P>These preliminaries,  whatever their entertainment values, run  too 
long, muddling us, along with Grant. The plot, in a round-about way, 
has him meeting Gina's father Frank Vitale (James Caan) at the 
latter's restaurant. Michael is  too naive and dense to catch on to 
the blindingly obvious fact that Frank & Relatives & Friends are 
big-time Mafiosi. It takes an elucidation by Gina to reveal that the 
family is a Family, that her refusal comes from her conviction that, 
if she marries Michael, Frank & Co. will inevitably involve him in 
their activities.</P>
<P>Heroically in love and undeterred, Michael presses on, gets engaged, 
and unwittingly
becomes the recipient as well as the giver of "favors" with the Mob. 
The plot escalates into complications which involve paintings by a 
disturbed scion of the group, messy art auctions, a labor union, the 
FBI, money-laundering, a dotty rich old lady, the accidental killing 
of a Family member, quid pro quos regarding the presumed killer, and 
more. Several of these sections are funny while, at the same time, 
most of the black humor is forced. But neither the overall structure, 
nor any of  the single episodes is believable or convincing. What 
started out as a rather sophisticated reminder of the auction with 
Cary Grant in North by Northwest, is transformed into an unholy 
tangle of broad-to-blatant gags, incredible coincidences and an 
outrageously messy, confusing last act (the wedding).</P>
<P>In spite of feverish twists and action, the movie lacks 
verisimilitude, continuity and coherence. Sinews too,  partly because 
of its structure, partly because, in this aptly-named Simian 
Production, Hugh  Grant apes himself by playing the familiar dazed 
and confused, passive and predictable Hugh Grant, a boyish ninny as 
opposed to our recollections of the suave, appealing, active Cary 
Grant. Mickey is as far as can be from the holy simplicity of Alfred 
Hitchcock's productions.</P>
<P>Curiously, within the limits and confines of a silly movie (the title 
of which refers to a Midwestern mobster whom Grant is forced to 
impersonate), there are several bits of good acting. Paradoxically, 
while the Family members are caricatures and cliches to a great 
extent (at least to those of us who are not familiar with the Mob), 
there is some realism behind it all. And it is good to see again, 27 
years later,  another Mafia performance by James Caan who played 
Sonny Corleone in The Godfather.</P>
<P>The bottom line is that Mickey Blue Eyes is not a good movie, yet, 
mega-warts and all,  it is quite watchable, mostly for a plethora of 
gags. The visuals are fine, well supported by the profuse, ironical 
use of old Italian-American songs (vocals and instrumentals), mostly 
pop classics, with, if I am not mistaken, some contemporary Italian 
items.</P>
