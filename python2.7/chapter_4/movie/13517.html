<P>A veteran returns to the helm, this time directing probably his best =
effort ever. Even though Robert Redford's time as a box-office star in =
his younger days are long gone (in the likes of Paul Newman and Steve =
Macqueen, in the eary 70's), his progress in the art of American Cinema =
never did cease.  Departing the indulgence with complexities in modern =
human lives (QUIZ SHOW), THE HORSE WHISPERER, wonderfully merges scarred =
lives in a beautiful tale of spiritual and emotional healing.</P>
<P>The film opens into a cold harsh winter sequence followed by a shot of =
Grace (Johansson) getting out of bed cheerfully to meet up with her best =
friend, obviously a routine but enjoyed by both. Grace looks forward to =
this meeting as it involves her other best friend, a horse named =
Pilgrim.  As both of them rode their horses through the snow, gossiping =
on boy topics, an unexpected accident occurs. The result; the death of =
her best friend and the loss of part of her right leg. Pilgrim survived =
the accident, heavily scarred and injured. Deeply shocked with the =
incident, Robert (Neill) and Annie (Thomas) struggled to come in terms =
with the trauma which had obviously devoid Grace of any form of hope in =
life. Pilgrim's entire persona too, has changed. Wild and violent, =
Pilgrim is no longer the same horse which embraced Grace's love and =
care.=20</P>
<P>Knowing how much the horse meant to Grace, Annie put her ladder-climbing =
career as a magazine editor on hold to drives both Grace and Pilgrim to =
the wild-west to a well known `Horse Whisperer', Tom Booker (Redford). =
The `Horse Whisperer', like Booker is known to have a special talent in =
being able to relate to the emotion of horses.  Annie hopes that by =
bringing healing Pilgrim, which to her, personifies an icon of hope to =
Grace, will ultimately heal her daughter as well. Little does she know, =
Booker will heal just a bit more than Pilgrim.</P>
<P>THE HORSE WHISPERER merges Pilgrim, Annie, Grace, Booker and Robert, =
each with their own personal in-bound demons and liberates them; =
providing a solution to all but one. While I will no tell you the =
ultimate outcome of it all, I will tell you that Booker's character is =
probably one of the greatest `hero' to embrace the screen. Redford and =
Thomas both give Oscar-nominate-able performances as Booker and Annie =
respectively. Two other performances worthy of mention comes from =
Johansson as the out-of-hope Grace and of course, who cannot fall in =
love with that Brown Wonder, Pilgrim.</P>
<P>Redford's ability as a director may as well earn him some sort of =
recognition here. Even though most will find the pace a tad too slow, =
THE HORSE WHISPERER never falters in term of story progression and =
character development. The wonderful cinematography and landscapes =
formed the formula for a remarkable visual experience but it too served =
in many ways to belittle its characters, making them seemingly powerless =
to their surroundings, hence increasing their vulnerability. Smart move, =
Mr. Redford.</P>
<P>THE HORSE WHISPERER is definitely one of the best films I've seen this =
year.</P>
