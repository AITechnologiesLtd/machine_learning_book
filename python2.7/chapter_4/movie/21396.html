 Country: USA; Year: 1999
 Rating (4 star system): ***1/2</PRE>
<P>        I think it's safe to say that Martin Scorsese is mostly known
for his crime dramas although that niche is probably outnumbered by his
other works, including Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Last Temptation of
Christ, and Kundun. Although, he's been so associated with that type of
film, it's never seemed to stop him from making different types of
films, and this is no exception.
        Although it's a bit uneven, it's extremely pleasing to see
Scorsese take such risks in filmmaking. He really does a lot of daring
things in the film, all the more impressive seeing as how is arguably
the most respected filmmaker working today and that he really need not
take such risks. No, that doesn't sound right. Perhaps that is why he
must be so daring. Or, conversely (and this makes much more sense simply
because it's entirely obvious), he is probably the most respected
filmmaker working today because he does take such risks.
        This film is in the same strain as Taxi Driver, sharing many
thematic elements. In fact, I'd venture to say that the parallels are so
close, it's nearly surprising it doesn't seem like a rehash. Maybe it's
the freshness of the filmmaking, or maybe it's the nearly quarter
century gap between that separates them just enough to really see them
as familiar, yet dissimilar works.
        Scorsese has a knack for picking interesting material and that's
why his direction usually seems even more at ease than it really is.
Here, the source material is a novel about a paramedic, Frank Pierce,
who can no longer deal with what he witnesses on the streets without it
affecting him to the point where he feels entirely responsible and
begins to go insane. The screenplay, by long-time Scorsese associate,
Paul Schrader, maintains a nice balance between objectively observing
Pierce (played by Nicolas Cage) descend into his madness and allowing
the audience to see the situation from a point more subjectively aligned
with Pierce.
        This point is infinitely helped by the strong performance of
Cage, and, to a lesser extent, by his supporting cast. Cage is very
expressive with minimal effort here. He is often very quiet and often
very worked up, but he is always intense and, at least, somewhat
seemingly disturbed. Not once did I think he played over the top (not
something I've been able to say of most of his performances of late) and
not once did I really think he underplayed a thing. The supporting cast
was not quite as strong, but they were close and perhaps the only reason
they weren't just a bit more effective is because they were never really
allowed to express as much. They simply weren't put to the same use as
Cage, and this is a choice that had to be made. Whether it's the best
choice remains to be seen, but it doesn't seem to really harm the film.
John Goodman, Ving Rhames, and Tom Sizemore were all great
characterizations, but they never really became much more than that--
never really characters, that is. The only other real character is Mary
Burke (Patricia Arquette). She could be seen as this film's Iris (Jodie
foster in Taxi Driver), not really a love interest, but more of a rescue
victim (she never really asks for it, but the hero feels the undeniable
urge to help, even against her wishes). While her performance, at first,
seems a bit on the dull side, her importance escalates as the film
moves and she seems to gain from this.
        This is a good solid film, but it is a bit hard to really get
into. I found myself feeling as if I was outside of it for a rather long
time, but once I finally got myself into it (and I'm not even sure how
or when this occurred), it was quite enthralling. Even while I was
feeling outside, it was still quite impressive, even if distanced. I
have a feeling, however, that this will be a film I will be more apt to
enjoy as I see it on other occasions.</P>
