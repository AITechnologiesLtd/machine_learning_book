<PRE>FANTASIA 2000</PRE>
<P>STARRING:  (animated)
DIRECTOR:  Pixote Hunt, Hendel Butoy, Eric Goldberg, Gaetan & Paul
Brizzi, Francis Glebas, James Algar
WRITTEN BY:  Various (see above)</P>
<P>The original Fantasia, made in 1940, was intended by Walt Disney as the
first of a planned series of 'concert features,' a continually evolving
document which would showcase some of the world's finest animation
married to some of the world's finest music.  It was an overly
ambitious-- and very expensive-- undertaking, and despite a successful
run, the sequels to Fantasia never materialized... until now.  Never a
company to shy away from hype, Disney has decided to kick off the new
millennium with an IMAX-size version of the classic, featuring seven new
animated segments (retaining the original's most famous segment, The
Sorcerer's Apprentice, featuring Mickey Mouse in the title role) and
different pieces of classical music (except, of course, Paul Dukas'
"L'Apprenti sorcier").  Assorted celebrity hosts (from Penn and Teller
to Angela Lansbury) are also recruited to introduce each short.  The
result is quite often visually and aurally breathtaking; nonetheless, I
felt strangely distant from the proceedings.  No matter how hard I
tried, and despite the inescapably immersive IMAX screen and sound
system, I simply could not lose myself in the childlike wonder I was
really hoping to feel.  It was a continual reminder that I, like the
company Walt Disney founded, have grown increasingly cynical over the
years.</P>
<P>The first segment, set to music from Beethoven's instantly recognizable
Fifth Symphony, is also the weakest, if only because the color-splashed,
triangle-based butterfly motif seems so out of tune with the strident
music.  This'll be the one most people forget to tell their friends
about when they describe the movie.  The second piece is far more
effective:  with its gorgeous look and majestic humpback whales, it
would have been moving enough, but when those whales rise slowly into
the air in vast numbers to the accompaniment of Ottorino Respighi's
Pines of Rome, the effect is absolutely spellbinding.</P>
<P>The third segment features the stylized artwork of longtime New York
Times caricaturist Al Hirschfeld and the slinky clarinet of George
Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue in a funny little fable about a few big-city
dwellers whose lives affect each other in profound ways.  Although the
constant references to Hirschfeld's subliminal name-dropping get
annoying, the piece is probably the best match of musical and visual
styles in the film.</P>
<P>Fourth in line is a condensed version of Hans Christian Andersen's The
Steadfast Tin Soldier, whose very basic plot is hurried along by a rush
of tinkling notes from Dmitri Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2.  It
is followed by the shortest piece, a cute and clever homage to the
original's pink hippos involving flamingos, a yo-yo, and Saint-Saens'
Carnival of the Animals.</P>
<P>A Disney-character double bill comprises the sixth and seventh entries.
First, Mickey Mouse tries on the sorcerer's hat with disastrous results
in The Sorcerer's Apprentice (which, with its resonant themes of the
miscreant Mickey and parental, authority-figure wizard, should win
Disney a few more kiddie converts); afterward, Donald and Daisy Duck
show up in a love story set aboard Noah's Ark to the strains of Edward
Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance.  This is another case, as in the
Beethoven piece, in which the sheer familiarity of the music works
against the animation.</P>
<P>The film ends on a strong note, with a segment that depicts nature's
endless life cycle of life destruction and renewal by pitting a
beautiful dryad against a fire-breathing, volcanic bird of prey.  Igor
Stravinsky's Firebird Suite provides the ideal musical tone for the
segment, making it the best of the bunch.</P>
<P>The first Fantasia was a bold experiment in fusing two very different
forms of art into something which combined their emotional power.  With
Walt gone, however, Disney's idea of bold experimentation has
increasingly been to cannibalize its own successes in a short-sighted
attempt to maintain a bloated corporate empire.  For all its delusions
of grandeur, Fantasia 2000 is no less derivative than any of the
animated fodder the Mouse House has churned out in the last decade, no
matter how big and loud it may be.</P>
