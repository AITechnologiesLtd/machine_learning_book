<P>Unlike many films that come out in America, Chinese films ( mainland or
otherwise ) have to be careful with their politics and their attitudes
towards their opinions.</P>
<P>If they can not come up with a political film that speaks mountains of
views, say something like Zhang Yimou's TO LIVE, then they spend their time
updating old stories with modern twists.</P>
<P>TEMPTATIONS OF A MONK is this kind of film. It's difficult to decipher,
though, if this film is an attack on an old fashioned, ineffective system of
politics, or just a simple story of a man, who failed in life and  decided
to become a monk, and his past keeps trying to show up and  get him back to
his old life.</P>
<P>Fortunately, in this film, the new attitude, that is, the old past is dead,
survives, even if it takes an old man to do it for the younger one, in what
is a very ironic twist of fate and story, but a rather satisfying one.</P>
<P>The thought that this film adds to the mix, is that not every old person is
stuck on the past. In fact, some elders are also hipper than the younger
ones, who have chivalric ideas and lifestyles, where ego and tradition  tend
to live. Though the old man is stuck on this as well, at least his hermetic
style, presumably, adds a more civil understanding of the life any
individual ought to take. The old man makes the point that the social scheme
( sort of, anyway ) is a trap for everyone except the person itself.</P>
<P>This is a really good film, given that the exposition of the situation is
odd, and perhaps unusual. But we do find that one samurai, failed in his
attempt to save his master and as he feels failed he has to leave the place
where he lives or he will live forever in shame. He figures that he will add
his services somewhere else. However, he finds an isolated space, where an
older man lives, and they strike up a friendship. From this point on, the
samurai begins tackling his past. And it comes to him in all sort of manners
and fashions, until, towards the end, it comes in the form of a sexual
encounter with a woman he used to love very much. And
it is here that the old man interferes.</P>
<P>One may think of this as inhuman, or not correct, but as an allegory, it is
excellent. Just about everything had failed to get the old samurai back,
except a woman. And it takes the religious minded person to show the new
monk that the social trappings of sex can be maniacal, and  downright ugly.
The film ends here, in another peaceful outdoor setting, without making any
more statements.</P>
<P>Making up your mind, in this film is not easy. Perhaps I see more into it.
But it is a nice film, that speaks bundles, and these statements are very
subtle. But one thing is for sure. There certainly is more than one voice
saying, in China, these days that the past needs to be buried and that a new
life is needed. And this may be the under current that undoes the Communist
hold in China.</P>
