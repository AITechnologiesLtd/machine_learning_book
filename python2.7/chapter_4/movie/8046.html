<P>     Few of us who call ourselves "adults" truly remember the experience 
of childhood, except as a dim and distant illusion.  Oh, we can recall 
what we did as a child, and often our memories of that period are among 
our most precious, but, looking back, we view things through the haze of 
maturity.  Every once in a while, however, something comes along that 
breaks through that filter -- a movie, a scene on television, a page in 
a book, or a moment in real life.  Jacques Doillon's PONETTE is one such 
catalyst.  By presenting the world through the eyes of a grieving four-
year old, PONETTE manages to do what few motion pictures can -- regress 
an audience into childhood.</P>
<P>     I would place PONETTE in the company of two other recent films that 
have successfully attempted something similar: Dorota Kedzierzawska's 
CROWS and Rebecca Miller's ANGELA.  In both of those movies, however, 
the protagonist was older (9 in CROWS, 10 in ANGELA), and neither 
featured a young actress with as much emotional power as Victoire 
Thivisol, who plays the title character in this film.  When Thivisol's 
eyes well up with tears and her upper lip begins to quiver, viewers 
reach for Kleenexes.  </P>
<P>     PONETTE works in large part because of its simplicity and realism.  
The plot is minimal -- just enough to give us a reason to stay with the 
tiny protagonist for ninety minutes.  Ponette has recently lost her 
mother in a car accident.  Her father, a somber, emotionally-detached 
man, informs her that "Mommy was broken," then disappears for a while, 
leaving his daughter in the care of her aunt.  So, with the aid of two 
cousins and, later, a group of other school children, Ponette must 
grapple with confusing religious issues while trying to understand the 
meaning of life and death.</P>
<P>     The film effortlessly takes us into the magical world of a four-
year old, where stuffed animals have extraordinary powers, dolls are 
more than inanimate objects, and God is someone you can talk to and 
expect an answer from.  Some of the most memorable moments in PONETTE 
center around the innocent conversations of children -- how Catholics 
are different from Jews, what it means to be "single", and how eating a 
certain candy can make you fall in love forever. </P>
<P>     For more than eighty minutes, PONETTE continues strongly, but, in 
the end, writer/director Jacques Doillon seems at a loss how to end the 
movie.  His choice, while admittedly cathartic, feels like a cheat.  The 
pseudo-realistic, almost-documentary quality of the film evaporates; 
PONETTE's final scenes jar us out of the fragile reverie generated by 
what preceded them.  Fortunately, the contrived ending does little to 
dampen my enthusiasm for the picture as a whole.  When I recall PONETTE, 
the first thing I think of is the heartbreakingly pure performance of 
young Victoire Thivisol.</P>
<P>     From start to finish, Thivisol is nothing short of amazing.  This 
is the kind of portrayal that would be labeled as a standout from an 
actor of any age, but, from someone who's only four, it's astonishing.  
A share of the credit must be lavished upon Doillon -- it takes a 
masterful film maker to elicit this kind of unforced performance from a 
child.  Had Thivisol shown a hint of artifice, PONETTE would not have 
worked.  The strength and consistency of her acting keeps this film on a 
high level.  Even if the movie was not so moving and evocative, it would 
be worth viewing simply for the character that Thivisol brings to life.</P>
