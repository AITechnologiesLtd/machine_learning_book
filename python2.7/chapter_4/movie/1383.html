<PRE>                              LETHAL WEAPON 3
                       A film review by Jose R. Perez
                        Copyright 1992 Jose R. Perez</PRE>
<P>     I went to this movie with very low expectations for a variety of
reasons: first, and unlike the other two, it has gotten mixed reviews in
the media (although mostly good); secondly, the net has also had mixed
opinions; and last and foremost in my apprehension, Shane Black (the
writer of the others) has apparently departed the LW team.  However,
since Richard Donner and the regulars were back, I decide to gamble on
seeing it.</P>
<P>     To my surprise, LW3 surpassed by far my expectations; I am still
amazed that some opinions in the net hint of not enough action.  One big
part of the LW movies is the action, and the incredible stunts; (IMHO)
this movie had more than enough spectacular and new action and
situations to blow me away.  Another part of the LW movies, and what is
almost as important, is the buddy cop relationship between the
characters.  With Mr. Black departed, I was concerned the relationship
(and the chemistry) wouldn't be as strong.  Again, I was pleasantly
surprised, as the Riggs-Murtaugh relationship is stronger than ever, and
even though Mr. Leo (okay, okay, okay!) Getz is on screen for few parts
of the movie, the character is still interesting.  What's more, Rene
Russo worked *perfectly* for me as an addition to the usual duo, even
though she is only a female Riggs.  The last Shane Black movie THE LAST
BOY SCOUT disappointed me, in that the relationship seemed strained and
in that I *hate!* Tony Scott's directing style of almost complete
constant closeups and grisly violence.  Kudos to Mr. Donner and
Mr. Jeffrey Boam (who has written the last two LW screenplays and the
LW3 story) for making LW3 as good as it was.</P>
<P>     As to the plot, it had as much of it as the others.  To me the LW
movies are simply this: Completely fleshed out characters interact with
each other with expertly done humor and action with unbelievable (and
new) stunts.  LW3 delivered in all these counts.  Plot is not irrelevant
in these movies, but does demand a little suspension of disbelief;
thankfully, since the action and humor are so well done, and the movies
are so well filmed by Mr. Donner and his crew, the fun experienced by
the movie-goer more that makes up for the occasional "oh, sure...."
LW3 simply delivers.</P>
<P>On that note, the LW movies get the following ratings:</P>
<PRE>LW1: ***1/2 : Damm near perfect; the first cop buddy relationship that
              evolves and is believable since 48 HOURS.</PRE>
<PRE>LW2: *** : Great movie! Riggs may not be suicidal but he is still crazy;
           the character change in the first one is supplanted by
           nonstop action and humor in the second one. One proof that
           when the heart is in a production, a sequel can work.</PRE>
<PRE>LW3: *** : (See above!) Ms. Russo is an excellent addition; the movie
            simply is fun.</PRE>
<P>     These series are evolving into the American Bond movies, (IMHO).
Let's hope the fourth one (if there is one) is as good as LW3.</P>
<PRE>Footnote: (AND SPOILERS!!!!!!!!)
^L
I mean it!
^L</PRE>
<P>     Russo's character didn't die!!!  HURRAAAYYYYY!  Maybe it was for
the best that Mr. Black departed; he seems to kill all the females :-)
Who knows?  Maybe Russo will save Riggs on the next one (Big :-))</P>
<P>     To some people, the ending seemed tacked on; to me, ever since
Riggs told Murtaugh that by retiring himself he would be retiring them,
I *knew* he wasn't going to retire.  To me, it was a treat to relive his
birthday scene in the first one with his retirement party; guess they
didn't change the bathroom much after the explosion :-).</P>
<PRE>     That's it. Be excellent to each other,</PRE>
<P>     Next weekend: ALIEN^3 - Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised again.</P>
