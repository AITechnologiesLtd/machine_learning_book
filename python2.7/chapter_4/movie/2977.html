<P>     It's been more than fifteen years since the release of John
Carpenter's HALLOWEEN, and ten since Wes Craven's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM
STREET arrived on the big screen.  Each, in its own way, was a top-of-
the-line horror flick--a film that relied more on chills and thrills
than on graphic displays of butchery.  Those movies had unique visions
of what was required to scare an audience, and neither resorted to the
pointless and grotesque displays of gratuitous gore that permeated the
other "big" entry of the time (FRIDAY THE 13TH).</P>
<P>     But then came the inevitable sequels, and the corresponding
plummet in quality.  Making a cheap buck took precedence over
everything--including telling a good story.  HALLOWEEN 2 was steeped
in blood.  NIGHTMARE 2, not directed by Wes Craven, lacked even a
coherent story.  The race to mediocrity--and worse--was on.  By the
end of the '80s, it was difficult to discern much difference between
the various screen bogeymen:  Jason, Michael, and Freddy.</P>
<P>     The NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET series perhaps took a slightly
different path than the HALLOWEENs and FRIDAYs.  It was still
gore-happy, but its baddie, Freddy, had a self-deprecating sense of
humor (his one-liners reminded one of the kinds of things that Arnold
Schwarzenegger was wont to spout).  By the fifth NIGHTMARE sequel, the
films had become self- parodies.</P>
<P>     So why do another NIGHTMARE movie?  Probably, as New Line Cinema
exec Robert Shaye puts it (in a cameo in this new entry), because the
public wants it.  The Freddy Krueger mask is still a pretty hot seller
in Halloween costume stores.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the best turn of events is the return of Wes Craven,
directing a NIGHTMARE for the first time since the original.  He has
returned a sense of genuine horror to the series, in part by taking it
to completely new ground, and in part by giving his actors a legitimate
script to work with.  The Freddy of old--a horrifying, murderous
creature--is back, replacing the caricature who gasped his last in
1991's FREDDY'S DEAD--THE FINAL NIGHTMARE.</P>
<P>     WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE focuses on the lives of some of the
actors who appeared in the 1984 original (Heather Langenkamp, Robert
Englund, and John Saxon, all of whom play themselves).  Langenkamp is
having dreams about Freddy and Englund is painting some very strange
pictures.  For his part, Craven (who also appears in the film) is
writing a new script (which turns out to be the screenplay for this
picture).  All of them realize that something is very wrong.</P>
<P>     Then, Langenkamp's young son Dylan (Miko Hughes) starts having
catatonic episodes where he speaks in Freddy's voice, and her husband
Chase (David Newsom) is involved in an accident that appears to involve
razor-sharp claws.  Freddy, according to Craven (who is called upon to
provide an explanation for everything that's going on) is a being of
mythical evil whose essence was captured by the NIGHTMARE films.  Now
that the series is completed, he is seeking a gateway to the real
world.</P>
<P>     Whereas the other NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET films delighted in
blurring the lines between waking and dreaming, this one adds another
layer--that of pseudo-reality versus fantasy.  Craven has given
himself a wonderful new playground to fool around in, and he clearly
relishes the opportunity.  Those who can accept the basic premise are
likely to have nearly as much fun.  This isn't quite cinema verite, but
at its most clever, it comes close--a sort of big-budget, horror
version of MY LIFE'S IN TURNAROUND.  The only argument against Craven's
vision is that he perhaps didn't push the envelope far enough.</P>
<P>     Of course, the centerpiece of WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE is Freddy
Krueger (once again played by Englund, even though the end credits
ascribe Freddy's role to "himself").  This time around, the dream demon
has been given a newer, meaner look and a set of nastier claws, but
there's no questioning that he's the same monster that began his screen
haunts a decade ago.  The visual and gore effects, while not ILM
top-of- the-line, are believable and occasionally downright chilling.
The entire production is steeped in an unsettling atmosphere.</P>
<P>     The cinematic horror genre, like the science fiction one, has been
badly hamstrung by poor films, and several of the NIGHTMARE ON ELM
STREET entries have been at the forefront of the decline.  Therefore,
it's somewhat ironic that one of the most intelligent and creative
efforts to come along in a while bears the NIGHTMARE theme, title, and
signature villain.  Any copycat features spawned by this movie will
hopefully take a cue from WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE and favor quality
of scares over quantity of blood.</P>
