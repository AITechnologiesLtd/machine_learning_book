<P>1972's DELIVERANCE was pretty much the last word on 
civilization-vs-wilderness pictures, but this didn't discourage many 
imitations.  In this one, four friends travel to Africa for a week-long 
rafting vacation down the Zambesi.  Their brusque guide Raymond (Stephen 
Shellen) treats them at first with indifference, then contempt.  As the 
water gets wilder, so does Raymond - he snaps at his passengers and then 
snaps in his mind.  Yes, the storyline is standard exploitation (or 
raftploitation?) fare but tries for better.  Shellen has a few good lines 
and he’s amusing when yelling abuse at the rafting party without regard 
about how they might be 'feeling' about the whole experience (you get the 
impression that this was written by river guides as a revenge fantasy for 
every this-wasn't-in-the-brochure whining customer they've had to take on 
board).  Cinematography (all filmed on location in Zimbabwe) is good, and 
director Michael Schroeder makes an effort to keep things visually 
interesting:</P>
<P>Weight of film falls on Shellen's shoulders, and he does a reasonable job.  
It makes sense that we're supposed to link Shellen with the wilderness as a 
contrast to the controlled behavior of his passengers, but he seems trapped 
in a middle zone, neither truly natural/savage enough to belong completely 
to the river nor domestic/ethical enough to belong with the others of his 
party.  Note that Shellen follows every unexpected or violent act with an 
explanation, excuse, or justification.  Clearly the moral code he operates 
on is completely his own - that's why I don't think this film works at any 
potential allegorical level.  It's easy enough to explain Shellen's behavior 
by passing him off as a confused war veteran, but when his passengers refuse 
to fight fire with fire ("we're better than him") the film only makes a 
statement about one individual rather than a general human condition.  I 
know this kind of conjecture seems a little overwrought for this type of 
movie, but that's what makes DAMNED RIVER interesting.  I like the idea 
underpinning the film - that a group of people are forced to depend entirely 
on someone erratic and dangerous - and it would have paid to highlight this 
angle in deference to letting Shellen go over the top so soon.  With a 
tighter script DAMNED RIVER could have been considerably better; with any 
less production value it could have been a lot worse.  It's an exploitation 
film that doesn't come across as an exploitation film, but it doesn't really 
make it to 'legit' status either.  Film is like its central character, 
trapped in a middle zone.  As river movies go, it would rate a Class 3.  
That's somewhere between THE RIVER WILD and RACE FOR YOUR LIFE, CHARLIE 
BROWN.  And just for the record, crocodile does *not* taste like chicken.
