The Fighting Sullivans (Reviewed on Aug. 21st/98)</PRE>
<P>"The Fighting Sullivans" contains a major plot development in the last ten
minutes that every movie guide has seen fit to give away.  There was no
dramatic tension for me while watching the film, as I knew exactly what
was going to happen.  And that's the worst thing that can happen before
viewing a movie.  Because of this, I will tread lightly so I don't ruin it
for anyone reading this review, and it would be very advisable to avoid
all other material regarding this film until after you have seen it.</P>
<P>"The Fighting Sullivans" revolves around a family that consists of a
mother, father, sister, and five brothers.  The brothers are very close,
despite the occasional disagreement.  They are inseperable, and never
stray from one another.  Their friendship and loyalty is the foundation of
this picture.</P>
<P>The first half of the movie follows the brothers as young children, and
their various adventures.  When four of them get into a fight with some
local boys, the youngest Sullivan, who is inside a Church at the time,
comes running out to assist, but not before properly exiting the chapel.  </P>
<P>If I'm being awfully vague about details, it's because what I have told
you is essentially the first hour and a half.  All I can say is go watch
this film, because it is a fine portrait of a family that sticks together,
through the good and the bad.</P>
<P>And after you see the movie, you will understand why this review has been
written the way it has.</P>
