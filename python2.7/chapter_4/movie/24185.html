<P>The most honest film I've seen about the Recovery Process is Al
Franken's much maligned "Stuart Saves His Family." The 1995 feature, a
spin-off from "Saturday Night Live," centers on Franken's Stuart Smalley
character, a maddening, but endearing little guy who belongs to several
12-step programs. Flinging around Recovery slogans ("denial isn't only a
river in Egypt," "that's just stinkin' thinkin'") like confetti at a
parade, Stuart struggles to break free from his obsessive-compulsive
behavior patterns, generally taking two steps forward and three steps
back.</P>
<P>"Stuart Saves His Family" was a critical and commercial flop, but videos
of the movie remain hot properties on the 12-step circuit, because
members appreciate the warts-and-all portrayal of a man determined to
become a better person.</P>
<P>Although the subject matter is similar, "28 Days" is the antithesis of
"Stuart Saves His Family." The film plays like an escapee from the
Lifetime Channel, boosted only by the talents of Sandra Bullock. This is
a star vehicle and, while there are scattered affecting moments, the
production is glib and overly pat, often using humor inappropriately.</P>
<P>Take the wedding scene, for example. After too much partying with her
boyfriend, Jasper (Dominic West), Gwen Cummings (Bullock) shows up late
to perform bridesmaid duties for her sister, Lily (Elizabeth Perkins).
Gwen's tardiness is just the beginning, though. The drunk young woman
insults the newlyweds during a toast, loses balance while dancing and
falls on the wedding cake, takes off to replace the cake by stealing the
couple's limo, then careens for several blocks before crashing into the
front of a house.</P>
<P>Director Betty Thomas plays the situation for laughs and, judging from
the howling audience at the screening I attended, it appears that
driving while intoxicated isn't appalling – it's funny.</P>
<P>The court system in Movie Land doesn't take it that seriously, either.
Instead of throwing her ass in prison, Gwen is allowed to opt for a mere
28 days in rehab rather than jail. With a massive chip on her shoulder,
she arrives at Serenity Glen, a New-Agey recovery center that
specializes in group chants and sing-alongs.</P>
<P>Thomas shoots for a "M*A*S*H" motif – throughout the film, we hear wacky
announcements over the P.A. system and Loudon Wainwright III, who served
as official camp troubadour on a few episodes of the TV series, does
another tour of duty here. Gwen is surrounded by a group of
one-dimensional fellow patients: tough-as-nails Roshanda (Marianne
Jean-Baptiste), self-loathing Daniel (Reni Santoni), wise guy Oliver
(Mike O'Malley), sacrificial lamb Andrea (Azura Skye) and
easy-target-for-cheap-laughs Gerhardt (Alan Tudyk), a gay German
stripper who comes off like the "Sprockets" version of Andy Dick. What a
shame it is to see so many fine character actors used as little more
than props.</P>
<P>Two bits of inspired casting offer brief hope for greater things. Steve
Buscemi, who has popped up as the weird guy in virtually every film made
over the past decade, plays a well-balanced counselor, and Viggo
Mortensen, a specialist in portraying smarmy heels, appeared as a
baseball star who, substance abuse problems aside, is a clean-cut,
stand-up sort of man. Unfortunately, neither actor is given much to do,
as the spotlight remains firmly on Gwen.</P>
<P>Sandra Bullock is good – she generally does her best work when given a
character placed in an extremely tense situation – but Gwen's journey is
too easy. As Stuart Smalley can tell you, breaking self-destructive
behavior patterns is tough business. Compared to what most people
endure, Gwen's rehabilitation is a cakewalk. Revelations and
reconciliation come in tidy little packages, with just enough angst
thrown in to allow Bullock to strut her stuff.</P>
<P>Anyone who has dealt with drug addiction, codependency, compulsive
eating, gambling, etc. can tell you that a key to the recovery process
is learning that, while you are a vital part of the human tapestry, you
are most certainly not the center of the world. "28 Days" trivializes
what it seeks to honor by placing one character's concerns above all
others, and by milking potentially deadly actions for laughs. Sorry,
Sandra, but I'll take the awkward, messy "Stuart Saves His Family" over
faux grit like this anytime.</P>
