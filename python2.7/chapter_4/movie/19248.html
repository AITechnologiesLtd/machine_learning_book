<P>
Recent thrillers have become mired in lurid details and overcooked melodrama.
Some manage to be suspenseful ("8mm") and others are just plain flat and dull.
Nothing can be further from the truth than "The General's Daughter," a silly,
humdrum thriller purporting to be more than the sum of its parts. </P>
<P>The basic premise deals with the titled character, Captain Elisabeth Campbell
(Leslie Stefanson), who is found strangled, naked and spread-eagled openly at
an Army base. John Travolta is the Army cop, Paul Brenner, assigned to the case
to investigate her death - he met her briefly when she fixed his flat tire.
Everyone at the Army is a possible suspect, and the fierce Paul will do
anything he can to uncover the truth. It seems almost every Army official slept
with Elisabeth. And there are the incriminating S&M videotapes found in her
basement. And there is Elisabeth's father, Gen. Joe Campbell (James Cromwell),
who may be a key figure in her torrid past at West Point Academy. </P>
<P>"The General's Daughter" heads for the low road once the investigation
begins...simply because nothing remotely interesting happens. Once the S&M
tapes appear, they are whisked away violently by someone in the Army and never
mentioned again. The introduction of Elisabeth's mentor, Col. Robert Moore
(James Woods), a supposedly key figure in psychological warfare and alleged
lover of Elisabeth's, is fascinating but is dispatched too early on. </P>
<P>We are left with many plot holes after every suspect is questioned - there are
no answers and no logical spins. Instead, we get many red herrings, shopworn
characters, and inexplicable motivations. </P>
<P>Travolta is one of the film's few virtues. He is charismatic, smart,
unrelenting, and vigorous, if only the script was involving enough to lure our
interest. He does have numerous one-liners and his slight tilt of the head and
cocky walk are more than enough compensation for the thin characterization,
just not enough to save the film. </P>
<P>Still, the central focus of the film should have been the relationship between
General Campbell and his daughter. The West Point flashbacks are visceral and
powerful but the film peters out with a predictable, anticlimactic conclusion.
The theme seems to be that women have no place in an organization like the Army
- they will be abused, mishandled, or worse, murdered. It's unfortunate the
film does not stay true to its original convictions. </P>
<P>"The General's Daughter" is nasty and tedious, sacrificing illuminating story
potential about sexism, murder, and scandal in the Army with absurd plot twists
and clinical murder investigations. Once it is over, you may ask yourself: who
was the General's Daughter anyway?</P>
