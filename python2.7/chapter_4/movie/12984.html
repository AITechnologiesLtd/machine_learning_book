<P>     HAV PLENTY comes from that school of independent film-making that
enchants some and aggravates others.  Like other recent indy success
stories including THE BROTHERS McMULLEN and CLERKS, HAV PLENTY will win
admirers for its comic charms and low-budget, can-do enthusiasm, even as
detractors line up to fire pot-shots at its gross amateurishness and
complete lack of visual style.  Think of it as Puppy Cinema:  it's so easy
to be won over by their cute, slobbery energy that you may overlook how
much they need discipline to avoid making a mess time and time again.</P>
<P>     Christopher Scott Cherot, the multi-hyphenate creator of HAV PLENTY,
definitely has the puppy thing down cold.  Cherot stars as Lee Plenty, a
struggling would-be screenwriter living out of his car while he waits for
his Big Break.  The maybe-girl-of-his-unrequited-dreams is Havilland "Hav"
Savage (Chenoa Maxwell), a well-to-do New Yorker with whom Lee shares a
love/hate friendship.  During one New Year's weekend at Hav's mother's
home in Washington D.C., with Hav taking time out from her philandering
fiance (Hill Harper), Lee becomes an object of interest for Hav's
high-maintenance friend Caroline (Tammi Katherine Jones), Hav's sister
Leigh (Robinne Lee) and Hav's old prep school chum Bobby (Kim Simmons) --
everyone, it seems, except the one person whose interest he most wants.</P>
<P>     Not everyone could get away with a premise that sounds like a
film-maker's ego-stroking fantasy.  Cherot, however, is so unassuming and
self-effacing -- and so doncha-just-love-him puppy-cute -- that all the
unsolicited romantic advances actually seem like they make him
uncomfortable.  Though far from a polished performer, Cherot has a natural
screen presence, an eye for wry commentary and the rare ability in the 90s
to sell a pratfall.  Simply put, it's easy to like him, even when the
film's narrative gets a little rough around the edges.</P>
<P>     Make that a _lot_ rough around the edges.  Cherot has a solid enough
sense for how to put together a comic scene, but he hasn't got a clue yet
how to unite them.  HAV PLENTY amounts to little more than a series of
vignettes, ideas for character encounters lined up in a row until they add
up to 90 minutes.  The characters are little more than one-dimensional,
occasionally even grotesque caricatures for the deadpan Cherot to react
to.  There are even takes included where the actors clearly fumble their
lines.  In such a makeshift effort, the sly, slick performance of Hill
Harper stands out as a hilarious delight.  Playing Hav's fiance Michael, a
criminally insincere R&B star whose song titles involve such romantic
analogies as comparing a woman to malt liquor in "Love Forty," Harper
creates one genuinely brilliant scene and one great comic character.</P>
<P>     That scene and Cherot's low-key appeal are enough to push HAV PLENTY
over the edge as an entertaining diversion.  Mostly, however, Cherot will
earn plaudits for his good intentions -- for making the film nearly as a
one-man show, for creating a romantic comedy with smart, upscale
African-American characters, etc.  HAV PLENTY ends with Lee finding
success as the "true story" of his relationship with Havilland becomes his
first film.  If Cherot wants to find success beyond HAV PLENTY, he'll need
to mature as an effective story-teller rather than just an effective
joke-teller.  A messy puppy may be cute, but all grown up he's just a
mess.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Hav and Hav-Nots:  6.</PRE>
