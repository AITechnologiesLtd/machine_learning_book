<PRE>TOMB RAIDER
Directed by Simon West
With Angelina Jolie, Iain Glen
UA North, De Vargas      PG-13     98 min.</PRE>
<P>     In the great tradition of such classics as Mortal Kombat, Super 
Mario Brothers, and Wing Commander comes Tomb Raider, the latest entry 
in the video-game-to-movie sweepstakes.  And to give credit where credit 
is due, this one makes the transition with flair and invention.</P>
<P>It's a genre that has a built-in problem to overcome: video game 
addicts are used to doing, not just watching.  Here they'll have to rely 
on Lady Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie), the game's heroine, to take care of 
the action for them.  And they couldn't have found a better substitute.</P>
<P>Jolie is tough, athletic, cocky, brilliant, sexy, and a little 
vulnerable.  When I say vulnerable, I don't mean all soft and girlie.  
But prick her, and does she not bleed?  Evoke the image of her dead 
father (played by her real father, Jon Voight), and does she not become 
misty-eyed?  Otherwise, she's pretty invulnerable - she can swing 
through a withering hail of bullets with devil-may-care insouciance and 
never get a scratch. </P>
<P>But she's tough on the set and the props.  She'd rather go through 
a wall than open a door, and if she wants to take a clock apart she uses 
a hammer.  At one point she reduces an ancient tomb to rubble, and when 
it turns out to be a private training facility in the basement of her 
manor house, one shudders at the thought of what the budget for her 
workouts must run per year.  Figuring she does these training exercises 
at least once a month, and estimating repairs and construction of new 
tomb sets, with overtime, at about $5 million per, the only way it 
becomes cost effective is because she's in the business of saving the 
world.</P>
<P>The video game's producers insisted on star approval, and their 
other deal-breaker was a ban on nudity.  So it was a pleasant surprise 
to come upon a shower scene early in the action, following which Ms. 
Jolie drops her towel in front of her butler (Chris Barrie), who primly 
reproves her, noting that "A lady should be modest."  "Yes," she 
ripostes with saucy irony, "a lady should be modest."  There is equal 
time for admirers of the other gender in a shower scene featuring one of 
the male leads (Daniel Craig), who plays an entire nude scene Peter 
Sellers-like, with the area between hip bone and mid-thigh cannily 
obscured by camera angles and furniture.</P>
<P>There is a plot, and it is constructed along the conventions of a 
video game, with the player facing challenges of increasing degrees of 
difficulty.  The goal is to find the two severed halves of an icon 
called the Triangle of Light before the bad guys do.  The bad guys are a 
secret society called the Illuminati that wants to, would you believe 
it, rule the world, which they will be able to do with this gizmo 
because it controls time.  The catch is that the two halves are hidden 
in secret tombs in far corners of the globe, and they must be joined at 
the precise moment of the alignment of all the planets, which is 
happening in a couple of days and then not again for five thousand 
years.  The Illuminati have set rival tomb raider Manfred Powell (Iain 
Glen) on the trail, and if you didn't already know he was a bad guy your 
alarms would flash when he says patronizingly to Lara "I hear you're 
quite the little archaeologist yourself."</P>
<P>Tomb Raider borrows with good-natured liberality from a lot of very 
recognizable sources.  At the head of the list is Raiders of the Lost 
Ark, with plenty of James Bond stirred (not shaken) in.  There's a cute 
riff on the Pink Panther movies, with an electronic Cato robot 
programmed for surprise attacks Lara. </P>
<P>Tomb Raider stomped the competition over the weekend, raking in 
nearly 50 million  at the box office, which lends a prescient quality to 
a line uttered by the chief Illuminatus:  "If one tomb raider is good, 
two tomb raiders will be even better." </P>
