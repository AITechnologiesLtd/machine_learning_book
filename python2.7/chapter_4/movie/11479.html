                        REVIEW: TITANIC (1997)

<P>        With an epic love story touched by disaster, a three hour running 
time, and great early press, I feared that "Titanic" was going to become 
this year's "The English Patient."  After all, that horribly 
disappointing picture was touted for Oscars long before it hit wide 
release.  Happily, after three viewings, and I hope one more next week, 
"Titanic" has proven my skepticism completely wrong.  Alongside "Good 
Will Hunting," this is the best film of 1997 and deserves many of the 
accolades and awards it has been given.</P>
<P>        Some people are losing themselves to the spectacle of effects and 
editing.  Certainly these were some of the best effects Hollywood has 
witnessed, but the true splendor comes in the storyline.  A vagabond 
sketch artist, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), and young rich poseur, 
Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), become embroiled in a forbidden love 
affair on board the R.M.S. Titanic.  Rose is engaged to Pittsburgh 
businessman Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) as arranged by her mother Ruth  
(Frances Fisher).</P>
<P>        This story is told through the eyes of a 101-year-old Rose 
(Gloria Stuart) after she has seen a news report of divers led by fortune 
hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) searching for a priceless diamond necklace 
aptly called "The Heart of the Ocean" that she  still owned since the 
ship's sinking. The old Rose takes us back to 1912 for the maiden voyage of 
the Titanic, when she, a miserable teenager, was heading home for a wedding 
that would keep her family out of debt, while sucking away her life.  Here 
she met Jack after a botched suicide and quickly falls for him.  In this 
relationship, there are no pretentions, just casual flirtation followed 
by deep emotions: the type of love we would all like to have.  This meets 
the scorn of Cal and Ruth. </P>
<P>        Foreshadowing (though we know what will happen) of the disaster 
about to occur is hinted at throughout the first half of the picture.  
The mystique of the ship is that it is deemed unsinkable by all involved 
in its creation.  In spite of Rose's concerns about the limited 
amount of lifeboats, builder Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber) assures her 
they will not be needed.  Guided by fate, pressure, and human error, 
Captain E.J. Smith (Bernard Hill) turns the engines to full speed.  With no
moonlight and no speakable wavecrests around the iceberg, the Titanic 
became history's most famous blunder.  For over an hour we watch as the ship 
sinks, and Jack and Rose's love grows deeper and stronger as their time 
runs slowly out.</P>
<P>        Everything in this film deserves mention and praise, so here 
goes.  The Oscar nominated Kate Winslet tempers naivete with strength, 
while DiCaprio plays Jack with youthful exuberance.  Their romance is 
believable and heartwrenching.  Gloria Stuart is wonderful as the old 
Rose, conveying eighty years of repressed emotions.  Her role might have 
been too slight for an Oscar nomination (though her age, 87, will endear 
her to the Academy) and it could be a recognition of her longevity.  
Kathy Bates does not show up on screen long enough, though she nails the 
nouveau riche and brave Molly Brown on the head with gusto.  
Billy Zane, all caked up with eyeliner, is the biggest jerk on the 
screen.  We are not supposed to like him and he never gives us any 
reason to.  Frances Fisher, as Rose's icy mother could have received her own 
Oscar nomination.  </P>
<P>        James Cameron is lucky he was given such free reign on this film, 
because he has made one of the best films of all time.  His direction 
and eye for detail makes this film worth viewing many times, and has 
given the world a gift with "Titanic."  The hardest workers, though, 
have to be the stunt men and women, as well as the extras, who might never 
see more than their names in small print in the credits.</P>
<P>        Cheers to James Horner for his haunting score and to Wilbur Jennings 
(lyrics) and Celine Dion for "My Heart Will Go On."  Her voice has become 
synonymous with soundtracks and this year she should take home the big prize.  
If you see one movie more than once this year, make it "Titanic."  You will
not be disappointed.  I have not gotten up in the nine hours and forty-five 
minutes I have watched of "Titanic."  Watch it for the effects, watch it 
for the love story.  If "Titanic" does not move you, I don't know what will.</P>
<PRE>My grade: a resounding A+</PRE>
