<PRE>Utterly Ridiculous
Price of Milk</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Director Sinclair states, "So this film is my dream about New Zealand, 
this make-believe country that seems almost empty of people, where love 
stories are played out in silence and loneliness, where white farmers 
make deals with indigenous Maori people, where the land is like a vast 
quilt of fields, where life seems perfect but we find ways to make 
ourselves unhappy ... But like a dream, I wanted this film to have no 
obvious message, more of an invocation of symbols. And mostly it's about 
love, and what it's worth." </P>
<P>The film begins with a young farming couple pulling a quilt back and 
forth while they sleep, the credits are sown in. The dramatic 
"Fantasia"-esque music plays as awkwardly over this picture as a cowbell 
hung from a kangaroo. </P>
<P>She loves him, he loves her, but doesn't want kids. Perhaps the kid 
issue prompts her to feel that the fire has slipped from the 
relationship (though the film seems to depict just the opposite). In 
search of sparking the flame, she pisses him off completely and spends 
the rest of the film sorting that out. Not a very interesting story, but 
it's told beautifully, haphazardly, magically, impossibly. </P>
<P>Planted like seeds in the earth, surrealisms sprout: Two lovers taking a 
bath in a tub in a field, they finish dinner in the tub, then wash the 
dishes in their own bath water. Their dog, afraid of daylight, romps the 
fields in an appliance box. </P>
<P>Other scenes I enjoyed: Singing by the fire, house moving as she 
"chases" him from the window. The picture is well paced, from the 
standpoint of intensity and comic relief placement. However, it's still 
a film that can be reduced to three crazy women conspiring to drive one 
nice guy crazy. And though Sinclair acknowledges the film has no point, 
I certainly felt one would have been nice. </P>
<PRE>Fine performance by Karl Urban. </PRE>
