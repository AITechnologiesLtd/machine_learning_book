<P>There will be inevitable comparisons of SPACE COWBOYS to THE RIGHT STUFF
(though I liken it more to ARMAGEDDON meets MISSION TO MARS meets
COCOON).  I could most def groove on veterans Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee
Jones, James Garner, and Donald Sutherland bucking the "current" Youth
Fad in Hollywood; but I was less encouraged by Eastwood's uneven
handling of the humorous aspects in some of the movies he's directed or
starred in (cf TRUE CRIME.  ewww.)  Let's see which side of Eastwood
comes to the fore...</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
A full forty years after being upstaged by a monkey for the right to
show they had The Right Stuff in outer space, retired Air Force pilots
Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood), Hawk Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones), engineer
Jerry O'Nell (Donald Sutherland) and navigator Tank Sullivan (James
Garner) are reunited in "Operation Dateless" when a Russian satellite,
"Ikon", malfunctions.  Much to the dismay of "Dateless'" former Air
Force commander, Bob Gerson (James Cromwell), Frank is found to be the
designer of a system much like the one found in the satellite.  And
since the technology he designed is too ancient for the current NASA
scientists like Sarah Holland (Marcia Gay Harden) to figure out, the
ball is in Frank's court, and he plays it: he'll gladly fix the
satellite - as long as he and his "Dateless" crewmates are allowed to go
on that long-awaited space mission along with reluctant current
astronauts Ethan Glance (Loren Dean) and Roger Hines (Courtney B.
Vance).</P>
<P>And the big question, voiced by both Frank and NASA Flight Commander
Eugene Davis (William Devane): just how did that "similar technology"
get into a Cold War-era Russian satellite?</P>
<P>The Upshot:
It seems like my fears were misplaced: it wasn't the humorous aspects of
the movie that were the problem at all.  In fact, the humor in SPACE
COWBOYS was what saved the day for me - and the better comparison there
was to the best parts of GRUMPY OLD MEN.</P>
<P>I'm an Old Skool kinda Chick, and in Hollywood, there's not much Older
than the likes of Eastwood, Jones, Sutherland, and Garner.  Each were
charming in their own way, none more than Tommy Lee [whose name alone
makes me want to make him an Honorary Brother].  Tommy Lee Jones puts
the Grump in "Grumpy Old Man", and manages to do so without coming off
either smarmy or as irritating as one would think his perpetual Good Ol'
Boy acting would play.  Jones is one of the most talented, natural
actors in the business, and it's almost always a pleasure to watch him
work.  RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, notwithstanding.</P>
<P>SPACE COWBOYS was Jones' and Clint Eastwood's puppy to play with.
Jones' Grump was matched by Eastwood's patented Grimace; I almost saw
Clint crack a smile...once...but I'd not have it any other way.  Where
Jones is at ease with his suthern drrrrawl, Eastwood Emotes through the
grit of his teeth; and though age has softened that grit somewhat, Dirty
Harry At 70 is still a force to reckon with.</P>
<P>Of the two remaining leads, Donald Sutherland fared much better than
James Garner.  I saw shades of Sutherland's younger self - no, not that
hack son of his; I mean his character in THE DIRTY DOZEN - in the
laid-back Jerry O'Nell.  Less a lecher than Walter Matthau's GRUMPY OLD
MEN character, Jerry's playful horniness was never laid on so thick as
to make that character unappealing.  Less successful was Garner; it
didn't help that his character was mistakenly hobbled to start with [I'd
like to throttle whomever decided that making him an uninspired preacher
was A Good Idea], and neither Tank the character nor Garner the actor,
were given much more to work with throughout the flick.  Garner looked
tired; certainly, he was a long way from THE ROCKFORD FILES and MURPHY'S
ROMANCE, two of the better projects I've seen him in.</P>
<P>And speaking of romance - what, you didn't know that Old Folks Need
Love, Too? - there was Love in the most unexpected of places.  The brief
flirtation scenes with Frank & Mrs. Corbin (I never caught Babcock's
character's name, but I smiled when I remembered her in the spicy role
of Sgt. Phil Esterhaus' paramour Grace in HILL STREET BLUES. Unlike many
of her contemporaries, she's aged very well) were only a teaser for the
more unexpected, yet somehow Obligatory, romance between Hawk and Sarah.
I didn't have a problem with that, per se - if anything, Harden brought
out even more of Jones' natural charm - but I'd like the name of Marcia
Gay Harden's hairdresser.  She (I assume) needs her butt whupped for
letting Marcia Gay go out in public looking like that.</P>
<P>I loved "Cowboys'" sense of itself, of how John Glenn and THE RIGHT
STUFF had to be acknowledged, and especially how it never really pushed
the age bit too far [well, almost never].  What I *didn't* like was the
illogic of Cromwell's character Bob Gerson and how he related to the
Russian Engineer [without giving too much away here, howthell was Gerson
kept on after...well, I guess that'd give too much away, so let me stop
there.  Watch it; you'll see what I'm getting at].  More to the point,
though, it was the second, serious half that almost broke "Cowboys'"
spell for me.  And, since I couldn't hear half of what was being said,
almost put me to sleep.</P>
<P>The comedic first half of SPACE COWBOYS certainly worked better for me
than the more serious second half; once the Cowboys blasted into space,
my initial estimation of the movie blasted out with them, and in fact, I
had originally given this movie a lower rating than what it ended up
with (see below).  Fortunately, I saw the movie a second time; and with
a better view of the screen and a better sound system in the theater, I
was able to understand the space stuff a bit more than the first time.
It still didn't compare to the first half, but certainly didn't drag the
movie down as much as I first thought.  Though I wish I'd left the
theater more excited about what I had just seen, I most def felt
Entertained...and ain't that what it's all about?</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
I had to chuckle at the way Diva's "Brotha Rule" played out here.
Courtney B. Vance may be married to Angela "Born To Be Storm, I said!"
Bassett, but apparently her cachet hasn't done him much good, as far as
the usefulness of his Hollywood roles goes.  Can't fault a brotha for at
least showing up on the set, though - even if his fairly non-existent
part amounted to not much more than a playful shove to the back of the
shuttle by Tommy Lee.</P>
<P>[Oh...and please, Mr. Vance, bring back your mustache.  Your fans will
thank you for it.]</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
This one was a tuffy.  I almost gave it a greenlight, for its sense of
humor (Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland kept me laughing), but the
serious outer space stuff left me rather cold, and I spent way too much
time straining to hear what was being said.  If you're in the mood to,
check it out if for no other reason than to see three-and-a-half good
old boys give it ye olde college try.</P>
<P>A rarity: upon second viewing, I've changed my mind.  Greenlight, it is.
Hey, it's a Chick's Prerogative...</P>
<P>SPACE COWBOYS (rating: greenlight):
Now if I could only get that infernal Bon Jovi song outta my head...</P>
