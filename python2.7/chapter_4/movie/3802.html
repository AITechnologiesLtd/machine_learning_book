<PRE>                                    APOLLO 13
                       A film review by Thomas Wheeler
                        Copyright 1995 Thomas Wheeler</PRE>
<P>     I've seen a good number of movies this summer--more than usual,
actually, and there's several more I'm looking forward to.  Thus far,
I've been to CASPER, BATMAN FOREVER, CRIMSON TIDE, DIE HARD WITH A
VENGEANCE, POCAHONTAS, and am looking forward to attending JUDGE DREDD,
UNDER SIEGE 2, and MORTAL KOMBAT.</P>
<P>     As much as I've enjoyed each of these movies as they've come
along, none of them have compared for pure emotional intensity as
APOLLO 13.  I am not given to emotional reactions in movie theaters.
This one had me in tears several times.</P>
<P>     Even though we all knew the outcome, that the astronauts would get
home safely, the sheer drama of the film more than compensated for what
would usually be a terrible hindrance for a movie--knowing how it turns
out.</P>
<P>     Every aspect of this drama--the astronauts trying to survive, the
Mission Control people having to scrap everything they knew to find
ways to *keep* them alive and get them back, the families trying to
cope--and the disappointment in being *so close* to the moon--and not
making it, were brought full force to the screen.</P>
<P>     The cinematography was spectacular.  You weren't looking at
"special effects" here.  In fact, some of the filming actually took
place in zero-gravity! Ron Howard, Tom Hanks, and crew got permission
from NASA to use a training plane known as the "vomit comet", which
flies in ascending and descending parabolas to simulate zero-gravity.</P>
<P>     Words cannot easily describe the drama and intensity of this
movie.  Go see it.  You'll see what I mean.</P>
<P>     On a personal note, I was alive in 1970, when all this happened
for real (that this incredible adventure did actually take place truly
enhances the movie).  I was 10 at the time, but my father was in the
news business, so I heard a lot about it.  This movie took me back *and*
brought me up to date.</P>
<P>     The closing words of Tom Hanks/Jim Lovell in the film should be a
rallying cry. "Sometimes I still look up at the moon, and wonder when
we'll return." It can't be too soon.  Would I go? Knowing the dangers,
the risks, if given the opportunity, would this 35-year-old graphic
artist take a trip on a multi-story bullet to the moon? Just hand me an
astronaut suit and point me to the launch pad.</P>
