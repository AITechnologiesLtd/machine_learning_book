<P>     The fact that Kevin DiNovis' debut feature, SURRENDER DOROTHY, won 
the Grand Jury Prize at the 1998 Slamdance Film Festival should be a 
warning signal to anyone expecting something even remotely mainstream.  
SURRENDER DOROTHY is startling, gripping, disturbing, and out on the 
film making edge.  It's the kind of movie that we don't see enough of 
because its commercial prospects are so limited.  This kind of picture 
is unlikely to appeal to typical movie-goers (or, for that matter, even 
to a significant portion of the art house crowd), and, as a result, 
directors stay away from this sort of in-your-face excursion into 
psychological deviance and obsession.</P>
<P>     The story follows a twisted, co-dependent relationship as it 
spirals into ever-darker territory.  The lead character is Trevor (Peter 
Pryor), a 27 year-old busboy who lives alone in a Philadelphia 
apartment.  His only friend is Denis (Jason Centeno), a drug dealer, and 
his extreme fear of women prevents him from even going out on a date, 
let alone having a girlfriend.  So Trevor lives his solitary, stale 
life, nursing his loneliness until someone comes along to change it.  
That person is Lanh (Kevin DiNovis), a 25 year-old heroin addict.  
Following a drug theft, Lanh is in hiding from Denis and comes to Trevor 
for a place to stay.  In return for shelter, Trevor exacts a price -- he 
gradually begins to transform Lanh into his vision of the "perfect 
woman."  To obtain a daily fix, Lanh must wear women's clothing, makeup, 
and high heels.  And, as Trevor's need to have a "real woman" grows, his 
plans for Lanh become progressively more bizarre.</P>
<P>     SURRENDER DOROTHY betrays its low budget through its 16 mm black-
and-white print.  Rather than detracting from the experience, however, 
the grainy, almost primitive-looking cinematography enhances the film's 
effectiveness, lending an almost-documentary quality to the proceedings 
that offsets the twisted fairy tale quality of the narrative.  The 
movie's look is perfect for the story; color or even a crisper black-
and-white would not have been as effective.</P>
<P>     The core relationship between Trevor and Lanh is obviously 
homosexual, but SURRENDER DOROTHY isn't a "gay film."  The fact is, 
Trevor wants a woman, and is able to delude himself into believing that 
Lanh (who he calls "Dorothy") is (or can become) one.  The real focus of 
DiNovis' picture is on Trevor's obsession.  It's frightening to consider 
the kind of monster that can lurk within the psyche of someone as 
apparently-ineffectual as Trevor.  (Of course, neighbors of mass 
murderers, when interviewed, inevitably remark, "He seemed to be such a 
nice, quiet person.")</P>
<P>     SURRENDER DOROTHY can also be seen as an autopsy of a universal 
problem:  domestic abuse.  Trevor is the abuser and Lanh is the victim, 
and, although their roles are nontraditional, the patterns are familiar.  
The abuse is psychological, not physical, with Lanh trapped in this 
dysfunctional cycle, unable to break free.  The defeated, broken Lanh we 
see late in the film is a far different individual from the cocky man 
who first moves into Trevor's apartment.  Likewise, Trevor has been 
transformed from a frightened mouse into a cruel monster.</P>
<P>     The lead actors both give fine performances.  Peter Pryor is 
completely believable as Trevor, the kind of meek person we see every 
day on the street and in shops, but rarely notice.  Even more impressive 
is Kevin DiNovis, who shows great courage by placing himself in such a 
controversial role.  Apparently, DiNovis wasn't his own first choice for 
Lanh, but, when the actor originally cast in the part backed out at the 
last minute, DiNovis had no choice if he wanted to make the film.  The 
results are a testament to the sometimes-fortunate twists of fate on an 
independent movie shoot.  DiNovis is the perfect Lanh/Dorothy.</P>
<P>     SURRENDER DOROTHY is part dark comedy and part (David) Lynch-
inspired melodrama, although it doesn't fit neatly into either category.  
It's an assault on political correctness and middle class values, but 
the underlying message is too urgent to disregard.  Ultimately, 
SURRENDER DOROTHY isn't easy to like (in much the same way that 
something in the nature of BLUE VELVET isn't easy to like), but it is 
undeniably powerful.  A week after I saw SURRENDER DOROTHY, it still 
lingers in my consciousness while movies viewed in the interim have 
already faded.</P>
