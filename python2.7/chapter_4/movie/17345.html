<P>MY DINNER WITH ANDRE is one of the greatest movies of all time because
it works on a seemingly infinite number of levels. Yet at the same
time it is one of the biggest failures in film because it only
succeeds in connecting to the most insightful of its audience. The
resulting paradox only serves to prove the film's lesson to be true.
Brilliant! </P>
<P>This is either a movie you will turn off after fifteen minutes, or it
is a movie you will watch over and over again to pick up all the
things you missed in previous screenings. The former will be bored and
lost by the endless, meaningless talk. The latter will find gold in
every word, and veins left to be mined time after time. </P>
<P>In simple terms, the question is understood "If life is a stage, are
you going to be an actor, a director, or a playwright?" It is the
viewer's choice. Wally is a struggling playwright who has fallen back
on acting. Andre is a former actor and director who has left the
theatre entirely. Wally and Andre meet for dinner, and Andre recounts
his experiences since leaving the theatre. </P>
<P>But one of the many ironies is that their dinner itself is theatre,
and both Andre and Wally have roles to fill. [Notice they wrote the
script and use their real names. They are not playing characters. They
are necessarily playing themselves.] And summarily the viewer also has
a role to fill. If life is a stage, viewing the theatre is in itself
theatre. The viewer is now in a place of filling a role, and the
question is will it be done mechanically or deliberately?
Mechanically is to be put there by script, or director, or instinct.
It is done without thought or personal intention.  Mechanics is
acting.  Deliberation is with personal intention and therefore choice.
Deliberation is thought.  Deliberation is playwrighting.</P>
<P>This is a brilliant, brilliant film. One of the greatest movies of all
time. And its resolve is purely subjective to the individual viewer.
The goal is for viewers to deliberate and come away enlightened
(literally). Unfortunately the majority of viewers will act
mechanically and turn it off.</P>
