<P>187 (R) *** (out of ****)
        Fifteen months after being stabbed by a student in a New York high
school, teacher Trevor Garfield (Samuel L. Jackson) returns to the
profession at a Southern California inner-city school a changed man--his
passion is not the same as it used to be; his guard is always up.  And he
soon finds out that while he and the setting have changed, everything is the
same as it was in New York--the gangs, the crime, the senseless violence.
And Trevor will no longer be anyone's victim.
        187 at times threatens to become another inspirational "teacher who
makes a difference" film a la Dangerous Minds, but scripter Scott Yagemann
(himself a teacher) has a darker agenda.  If anything, 187 is about the
impossibility of making a difference, at least a wholesale one.  Another
smart move is to not paint Trevor in the most sympathetic of lights; while
he is noble of intention, he at times is certainly not noble in action,
making for a refreshingly human educator instead of the saintly
Michelle-Pfeiffer-as-Louanne-Johnson types.
        The film does, however, have a problem at its core, and that is
director Kevin Reynolds.  Directing an urban drama is a stretch for the
one-time Waterworld helmer, and it shows.  Apparently bored by the
down-to-earth material, he and cinematographer Ericson Core amuse themselves
by juicing up the visuals, but the fancy camera  work only serves to
undermine the grit and reality of the story.  Is it really necessary, for
example, to have the camera ceaselessly circle two characters having a quiet
dinner at home?  Or, in a scene where Trevor and fellow teacher Ellen Henry
(Kelly Rowan) have a discussion in his classroom, to see the oversized
silhouettes of basketball-playing students projected onto the walls behind
them?  The visual flourishes are not only unnecessary, but pointless--who
wants a gritty drama to look pretty?
        What makes the film work, perhaps better than it has any right to
be, is Jackson, who brings a quiet dignity and slow-simmering anger to
Trevor that is fascinating.  But this is not to say that he isn't
vulnerable, and its his emotional rapport with the audience that makes the
character of Trevor sympathetic to the audience, even when his actions cross
the line.  The other actors, such as Rowan, John Heard (as a burnt-out
teacher), and Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez (as a delinquent student) are able
to hold their own, with the exception of the badly miscast Karina Arroyave
in the pivotal role of Rita, Trevor's star pupil.  It is her character's
duty to deliver the film's key closing speech, and Arroyave can't shed a
tear to save her life.<HR></P>
