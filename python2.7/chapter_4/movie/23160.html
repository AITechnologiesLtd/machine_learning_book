<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>It's a sad fact that Hollywood saves its worst films to put out in the
first two months of each calendar year.  Most of these stinkers get
yanked from theaters so quickly that you may forget that they ever
existed, unless you had the misfortune of paying to see one.  For some
reason, I seem to remember more of these early-season science-fiction
bombs than anything else.  If it has to do with space, and it comes out
in January or February, then run.  In the last two years, we've had
Phantoms, Wing Commander, Supernova and Firestorm (there's `space'
between Howie Long's ears, so it counts) – a crop that represents the
worst film has to offer.</P>
<P>Pitch Black certainly didn't seem like it would be an exception to the
general rule.  The pedigree is less than stellar - David N. Twohy (The
Arrival) directing from a script that he wrote with brothers Jim and Ken
Wheat (you may remember them from such sequels as The Fly 2, The Birds 2
and Nightmare on Elm Street 4).  There are no A-list stars.  There
aren't really any B-list stars, either.  In fact, the C-list might even
be out of reach.  The story isn't anything special, either.</P>
<P>But Pitch Black isn't bad.  I might even go so far as to say that it's
good (how about `goodish'?).  It's about a passenger freighter called
the Hunter-Gratzner, a spacecraft with thirty-nine lives on board –
including Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel, Boiler Room), a diabolical
prisoner that can see in the dark.  The ship crashes into a strange
planet during a routine hyper-jump, killing the captain and leaving
Pilot Second Class Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell, High Art) in charge of
the crew, prisoner and multi-racial travelers.  Wait a second…Fry?
Prisoner?  Multi-racial travelers?  This sounds like a cross between
ConAir and Futurama.</P>
<P>Of course, Pitch Black is more like Alien than anything else.  The basic
plot of the movie involves these nasty nocturnal creatures that will
only attack Fry and crew when it's dark.  As the title indicates, things
become pitch-black when a rare eclipse shrouds the planet in darkness.
Hey…that guy that can see in the dark should come in handy, eh?  People
predictably start getting bumped off one by one until three are left to
battle the CG monsters.</P>
<P>There are three things that make Pitch Black entertaining.  The first is
that the film doesn't seem to have the typical stock characters that
plague the genre.  Black also isn't as clichéd as you would expect from
a sci-fi flick released this early in the year.  That is to say, it
doesn't rip off every successful space flick, like Supernova did.  The
third and most impressive feature is the editing (Rick Shaine, Extreme
Measures) and cinematography (David Eggby, Blue Streak).  The crash
scene is really well done, using bright flashes of light and quick cuts,
but it isn't until after the crash that the feel of the film is
established.  The planet is essentially dead:  A desert littered with
barren trees, abandoned outposts and bones of humongous animals, and
Eggby shoots it like Three Kings – beautifully washed out with muted
colors.  If nothing else, it's a visual winner.</P>
<P>1:52 - R for sci-fi violence and gore, and for language</P>
