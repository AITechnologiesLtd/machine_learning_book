<PRE>                    ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS (1961)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Since it is just slightly less than 101 days until the opening of
the live action remake (with Glenn Close, Jeff Daniels, Joan Plowright
and Joely Richardson) of Disney's 1961 classic ONE HUNDRED AND ONE
DALMATIANS, we decided to watch the original cartoon version.  What fun
it is.</P>
<P>     As the show starts, a Dalmatian named Pongo (voice by Rod Taylor)
is contemplating ways to play matchmaker with his happy but recluse
owner and song writer, Roger Radcliff (voice by Ben Wright).  He does
this by looking for a woman with a female dog heading for the park.
After rejecting several unacceptable ones, he finds Anita (voice by
Lisa Davis) and her Dalmatian Purdy (voice by Cate Bauer).  As one of
many delightful little aspects of the film, notice how the owners and
their dogs look so much alike.</P>
<P>     Soon Anita and Roger are married, but in a twist it is the dogs
who are expecting.  Into their happy life comes hyper-evil Cruella De
Vil (voice by Betty Lou Gerson).  She is a classic cartoon figure of a
villain - very exaggerated, but effective.  She is as thin as a rail,
but wears an extra thick fur coat.  She has hair that is half black and
half white, and she smokes mile long cigarettes in a cigarette holder.
Although she could make great anti-smoking ads, here her evil is
manifested in her obsession for animal furs.  When she demands to know
when the pups will arrive, everyone is on their guard.  Soon over a
dozen pups arrive and are they ever cute.</P>
<P>     The drawing for the picture is a blend of the real and the
romantic.  Indoor scenes are highly detailed, but the outdoor scenes
have the look of a kid's storybook with the windows and doors lit up.
The music (George Bruns) and songs are tuneful, but not memorable which
works with lightheartedness of the script by Bill Peet, which is based
on a book by Dodie Smith.</P>
<P>     What is special about the movie are the small scenes.  My favorite
has all of the pups watching a black and white TV show about a cowboy
and a dog.  The pups are fascinated by it much as a human child would
be.  The most precious part is the plethora of little wagging tails.
Other sweet little nuances are the way the dogs call the humans their
pets.</P>
<P>     The tension in the story is supplied by a pair of bungling
dognappers named Horace (voice by Frederick Worlock) and Jasper (voice
by Pat O'Malley).  Cruella employs them to steal Dalmatian pups from
all over town, and they end up getting ninety-nine of them including
Pongo and Purdy's.  There is another delightful scene where the bad
guys and the pups watch Sunday's episode of "What's My Crime?"  Perhaps
those of you too young to remember "What's My Line?" will not be quite
so enchanted by it as I was, but it is a cute scene.</P>
<P>     Soon Pongo and Purdy use that time honored tradition of "the
barking chain" to find where their pups are hidden.  Now you finally
know what those dogs are doing every night when they keep you awake.</P>
<P>     ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS is not great drama, but it is a
children's story well told.  It should delight people of all ages.
>From start to finish it is a very sweet show.</P>
<P>     ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS runs just 1:29.  It is rated G, and
there is nothing to offend or scare anyone of any age - a great piece
of family entertainment.  Jeffrey (age 7) loved it as did I.  I
recommend it to you strongly and give the picture *** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
