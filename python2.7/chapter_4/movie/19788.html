<PRE>JAWBREAKER</PRE>
<P>  In Jawbreaker, the braindead teen angst comedy from writer/director Darren
Stein, a Heathers-like clique of popular high school girls led by the venomous
Courtney (Rose McGowan) accidentally asphyxiate one of their own while
kidnapping her as a birthday prank. They decide, as teens sometimes will, to
return the dead friend to her bedroom and make it look like she was raped. The
scheme gets complicated when the timid, socially retarded school misfit Fern
Mayo (a cartoonish Carrie lookalike in a fright wig) discovers their plot.
Courtney makes Fern an offer she can't refuse: if Fern doesn't tell anyone that
the nice popular girl she has a crush on has been murdered, Courtney will give
Fern a makeover to make her popular. The audience is not given any compelling
evidence that any human being would go for this ludicrous deal. But hey, says
Stein, they're only teens. What do they want, believable characters and
situations? Sheesh.
  Jawbreaker is one of the best examples ever of a high school movie that seems
to come from filmmakers who never went to high school, but instead watched a
lot of movies about it. Unlike the earlier dark teen angst films that it
blatantly apes (mainly Heathers and Carrie), it seems completely clueless about
what is funny and terrifying about being a teenager. Stein clumsily imitates
superficial aspects of those films without ever capturing their satirical
accuracy, their emotion, their storytelling or their characterization. You
don't believe in these characters or what happens to them and you can't be sure
how you're supposed to feel about them. All you know is that whatever it is,
you don't feel it.
  Heathers is powerful because it has protagonists we relate to and villains we
know in the real world, and it slashes at them with a dark, morbid wit. Stein
goes for the morbid and leaves out the wit. His villains remind us of the
villains in the other films more than they remind us of the real people those
films remind us of. But even as super villains they're not as successful.
McGowan's most-popular-girl-in-school is a "megabitch," but she doesn't have
any of the enjoyable wickedness of Shannen Doherty's Heather. Daniel Waters'
memorable Heathers dialogue is full of invented slang ("What is your damage,
Heather?"), clever insults ("Grow up, Heather - bulimia is so '87", "Football
season is over. Kurt and Ram had nothing left to offer this school but date
rapes and AIDS jokes") and occasional surprising vulgarities ("Well fuck me
gently with a chainsaw!", "Why are you pulling my dick, Veronica?"). Stein
isn't that funny - he tries to give the dialogue a crispness by sandwiching
'fucking's between phrases ("Peachy fucking keen") but it just comes off as
pale imitation.
  Heathers doesn't just take a big bite out of high school life, chew it up and
spit it out on the floor. It knows its targets and attacks them with precision.
It paints a vivid portrait of a world of cruel teenagers and parents whose
understanding of their kids' problems comes from clueless local news reports. A
world of macho dads who bury their sons in football helmets, flakey hippie
teachers who try to heal the school with "The New Happiness" banners, a
preacher who sees the word "eskimo" underlined in a dead girl's copy of Moby
Dick and says, "Let's hope she's rubbing noses with Jesus!" Part of the
believability is in the little, knowing details - the jock with the Sports
Illustrated football phone, the reference to the 8th grade boyfriend who's into
mythology, the college party goons with the Sharper Image poster on their wall.
  Jawbreaker doesn't have knowing details, because it doesn't know shit. It
presents a crude Pee-Chee doodle of high school culture - you really never get
a feel for the inhabitants of the school or the "cruel politics" of their
world. In fact, you hardly get to know the characters, or the movie itself.
It's a short movie, just over 90 minutes, but it's loaded with flashbacks to
earlier scenes, as if you might have forgotten. It's like an hour long TV
special with commercials. It never really feels like characters or scenes, just
actresses rushing through plot points. 
  Most of the minor characters use an atrocious, sub-Troma style of comedy
acting to deliver lines like "Oh my god! That is soooo cool!" - the kind of
satirical dialogue that was cutting edge in a certain region of California when
these characters were in kindergarten. Today it's not an observation, it's an
echo of a cliché of an out of date observation. There is even a football player
character who seems to be modeled after Kurt from Heathers. Both characters
look way too old to be in high school, and both have 1987 hairdos. The do is
most distracting in the 1999 movie. This character might have seemed a little
out of date when I was in high school, but in a contemporary movie he's
ridiculous.
  Along with the unbelievable high school world comes unbelievable behavior.
You don't believe Julie (Rebecca Gayheart) when she stops hanging out with her
popular, murderer friend and for some reason has to start dressing down. And
you really don't believe Fern's transformation into the popular Vylette. She
goes from mousy, mumbling Carrie White to cocky, talkative valley girl
superbitch (at one point looking like Princess Diana as Amber from Clueless)
and back to shy misfit, without convincing evolution or motivation. You are
never given any reason to relate to her as she covers up the murder in exchange
for fashion tips, but at the end, when she abruptly joins the good guys, it
seems you are supposed to forgive her.
  Heathers isn't a perfect film - its cheesy keyboard scoring has always grated
on my nerves, and many people are driven crazy by Christian Slater's whole Jack
Nicholson shtick. But it helped me get through high school because it so
perfectly reflected how I saw the world at that age. It made me feel like I
wasn't alone. I can't imagine that teens will relate as strongly to Jawbreaker.
Like most of the recent slew of teen movies, it has a weird view of popular
kids vs. social outcasts that doesn't come very close to jibing with reality.
When Fern gets made over as Vylette, the whole school talks about her and
follows her around and applauds her arrival at school as if she were a rock
star. When they find out that she is actually Fern, the quiet girl with the
fake looking wig, they are disappointed and angry, they mob her and chant at
her and hit her until she is bloodied and unconscious and laying on the floor
wrapped in xeroxed photos of her old yearbook photo. It's difficult to relate
to this kind of scene because throughout the horrible history of high school
humiliations on this planet, nothing even remotely similar to this has ever
happened. We can't believe in her rise or her fall - I mean, would anyone
really care? At worst, they'd stop talking to her.</P>
<P>  The obvious model for Jawbreaker, besides Heathers, is Carrie. And as
mentioned earlier, Fern is obviously meant to look like Carrie. But Carrie is a
believable outcast. She doesn't fit in because her mom is a crazy, abusive
zealot; girls pelt her with tampons and pig's blood because she has her period
in the gym shower and doesn't know what's happening to her. They don't
understand Carrie and they hate her for it. But Fern's biggest sin is looking
like Carrie. She's quiet and she's awkward, but she's just not pelting
material.
  There is one enjoyable homage to Carrie: the parents of the dead girl (seen
only for a few seconds) are played by William Kat and PJ Soles. So it's really
piling it on too thick later in the film when a character suggests going to
prom and Fern says, "Oh yeah, why don't we stop by the slaughterhouse and pick
up some pig's blood?" And then it really goes over the line when the climax is
modeled after De Palma's classic bucket of blood sequence, but without the
virtuoso technique or the suspense or the blood or the telekinetic aftermath.
  (There's also what seems to be a Blue Velvet reference - Fern smells a rose
and is horrified when an ugly centipede crawls out of it - but I'm not sure
why.)
  One of the more preposterous scenes has Julie casually telling her new
boyfriend about the murder - only as background information to explain
Vylette's makeover. Suddenly the conversation shifts to righteousness and
"You've got to do something!" and Stein seems to expect us to relate to Julie. 
  Julie decides to turn in Courtney, so she meets with the detective
investigating the case (Pam Grier, who is so likable that I could almost buy a
line like, "Some of the sweetest candies are as sour as death inside" before I
thought, "Wait a minute, Pam, why are you saying these lines? You escaped the
world of Steven Seagal movies for this?"). The detective reveals that there is
a man being held as a suspect in the murder, Julie figures out that Courtney is
framing a stranger, and inexplicably she leaves without telling the detective
the truth. (The suspect is played, briefly, by McGowan's offscreen fiancee,
Marilyn Manson, who looks funny in a mustache. His tiny walk-on must have had
something cut; early publicity was hyping up a "shocking sex act" which as far
as I could tell never materialized. If he ever breaks up with McGowan his
buddies will surely give him shit for being whipped into appearing in such a
lame attempt at a hard-edged black comedy.)
  Later, when Julie finds a recording of Courtney confessing to the murder, she
doesn't bring it to Grier because the plot requires her to instead perform an
uninspired prom prank - the old "play a recording of the villain saying
something self-incriminating while she is making a speech" routine. Of course,
in the world of bad movies, playing the recording over the PA system involves a
complex under-the-clock rewiring rather than just commandeering a microphone.
Worse, the consequences of being proven a murderer in front of an audience are
more like what you'd expect as punishment for a bad standup routine - everyone
calls Courtney a bitch and throws flowers at her. I don't think this is
supposed to be a swipe at the superficiality of high school culture. It's just
another scene that develops Stein's weak motifs at the expense of story and
character. And by this point the film has completely abandoned things like
Fern's opening narration and the implication that she is a lesbian. Shit, says
Stein, these kids grew up on MTV - they won't remember what I showed them 90
minutes ago.
  Jawbreaker is more insidious than other bad teen movies of the '90s because
it purports to be anti-establishment. Whereas Can't Hardly Wait and She's All
That really believed in the teen institutions of Prom Queen and Class President
and Cute Couple and Thrower of Parties, Jawbreaker tries to cast those things
in a wicked light and stand up for the outcasts. But it's empty and out of
touch. It doesn't even pretend that the outcasts are any less hollow than the
cheerleaders. 
  In Scream, Skeet Ulrich reminded everyone of Johnny Depp. Now the actor who
plays Julie's new boyfriend reminds me of Skeet Ulrich. He's a good analogy for
Jawbreaker: a second generation copy of an American original. (Don't apply the
analogy to Christian Slater's Jack Nicholson imitation in Heathers, though -
that would be uh cheating or something.)</P>
