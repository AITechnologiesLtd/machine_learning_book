                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Another year, another Meg Ryan romantic comedy.  In 1994, it was 
I.Q.  In 1993, it was SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE.  In 1990, JOE VERSUS THE 
VOLCANO; in 1989, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY.  And the thing is, no matter how 
she wears her hair, she always plays basically the same
character--bubbly and energetic yet repressed.  That description fits
her latest on-screen personae, FRENCH KISS' Kate.  But the problem is
that having played the type so often, Ryan has gone on auto-pilot.  This
time around, the effervescence is flat and the likableness is forced.
Kate is champagne that has stood out too long. </P>
<P>     Not so with the male lead in this Lawrence Kasdan-directed film.  
Kevin Kline, who won an Oscar as Otto in A FISH CALLED WANDA, brings the 
same degree of comic aptitude to Luc, a good-hearted scoundrel.  With a 
flair and enthusiasm that everyone else involved with this production 
seems to lack, Kline very nearly single-handedly saves this film.  
Almost, but not quite.  They say it takes two to tango, and with Meg 
Ryan's moves so much more mechanical than those of her partner, this 
pair engages in a decidedly clumsy dance.   </P>
<P>     The storyline takes the same old romantic comedy formula, bends it 
a little (but not too much -- Kasdan apparently doesn't want his 
audience to feel uncomfortable by facing new territory), and adds a few 
passages of decent dialogue.  There is one scene early in the film with 
Kate and Luc discussing kissing that's noteworthy for its sincerity and 
intelligence.  This isn't Kieslowski or Rohmer, but it's about the 
deepest one can reasonably expect from this type of motion picture. </P>
<P>     As the curtain rises on FRENCH KISS, Kate is engaged to Charlie 
(played with absolutely no charisma by Timothy Hutton).  They're the 
perfect couple:  boring, adoring, and ready to settle down.  Then 
Charlie heads off to Paris, falls madly in love with a French beauty 
(Susan Anbeh, who looks great but doesn't do much real acting), and 
calls Kate to cancel the wedding.  Distraught and determined to win back 
her fiance, she overcomes her fear of flying, gets on a plane, and heads 
off to Europe.  Sitting next to her during the flight is Luc, an unkempt 
Frenchman with a stolen necklace in his pocket and a plan to use Kate to 
smuggle it through customs.  Of course, problems occur, the necklace 
gets lost, and Luc and Kate fall in love. </P>
<P>     Lifeless performances by Ryan and Hutton aside, this movie might 
have been more endearing had it spent less time on the inane jewelry 
theft story and more time developing something other than a cliched 
relationship between the two leads.  FRENCH KISS isn't all bad -- it has 
its share of mild humor, and the scenery in Paris and Cannes is often 
more photogenic than the actors.  However, the delicate air of romance 
that often makes this sort of film worthwhile is absent.  FRENCH KISS 
does it by the numbers, not from the heart. </P>
