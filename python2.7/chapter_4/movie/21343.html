<P>Stage shows do not translate very well to film....</P>
<P>But then again, there are certain things you can not exactly put on film, or
on the stage, for that matter.</P>
<P>Spalding Grey, all by his lonesome, has an attitude about the stories he
tells us that are a t first weird, then get better, and then, they hook us
into laughing.  This whole thing is actually one man's view of his
experiences in Vietnam, and the various incidents and accidents that
happened, even when he was an actor on the set of the film THE KILLING
FIELDS.  And the adventures go from totally crazy, to being far out, to 'you
got to be kidding me...' and then some.</P>
<P>For a one man show, this is excellent, it really doesn't get any better than
this.  It has an easy setting, and is augmented by some very good music by
the artist Laurie Andersen, and well co-ordinated by the  director to keep
us as in tune as possible.</P>
<P>There are some incidents that aren't pleasant, but then, the description of
the events comes off so surrealistic, that it is difficult to distinguish
where the event stopped and the writer started with his literary license.
And license, he does take.  From the discussions of the beach Hiltons and
the holidays with bullets a la carte to the prostitutes and their ways about
the foreign men, who paid them better than any job might in a whole year, of
course, if there were jobs... after all this was a war, and the jobs were
non existent.</P>
<P>But amidst all this, there is at least one man scared out of his wits, and
his comic demeanor manages to save the day on occasion.  It is all somewhat
of a distant memory of Spike Milligan's wonderful stories about his part in
the fall of Hitler, and Hitler's part in Spike's downfall.</P>
<P>An evening of delightful entertainment awaits you if you get to see this
oddity of a show.  It isn't an action movie.... unless you have
the imagination to be sooooo active.  And for some of us, there are a few
visual aids to help us figure out what he is talking about, which at times
is a problem.</P>
<P>Extremely fast paced, it gives you no breaks at all. Worth seeing, as a
reminder, that even if we make mistakes, we not only
can learn from them, we can also laugh..... and cry.</P>
