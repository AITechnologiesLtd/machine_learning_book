<P>Ellie Arroway is a radio astronomer that's taken the professionally
dangerous specialisation of searching for extraterrestrial life. She's been
interested in radio since learning about her father's ham radio as a child.
Her old teacher David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt), as gruff as he is, thinks she
should change to a more respectable field within radio astronomy. When she
refuses, he manages to get the funding for her project pulled.</P>
<P>She manages to find funding from the enigmatic mega-rich recluse S.R.
Hadden (John Hurt) and continues the search. Later, she's given notice that
this search is to be cancelled, but not before she finds a signal from an
extra-terrestrial civilisation. The U.S. Government, in the guise of
Micheal Kitz (James Woods) moves right in and tries to limit the
information leaking out to the public.</P>
<P>Despite all the interference, they discover that there's a television
signal in the transmission and there are coded plans that seem to be for
some sort of machine. Should they build it? It clearly shows that there's a
seat for someone inside. Of course it's built, but what will it do when
activated?</P>
<P>I haven't revealed any more than the trailer or television commercials but
I think they even have gone a bit far. I don't even know where to begin
this review because there's so much I want to say.</P>
<P>Firstly the story. It's a faithful rendering of Carl Sagan's 1985
best-selling novel Contact. Of course, books change in their translation to
the screen and this one is no exception. I think that the story is very
strong and can easily hold the interested viewer for the two-and-a-half
hour length of this film. The shares the qualities of the best science
fiction. That is, the story is about people rather than effects or gadgets,
and it always makes you re-examine things that you normally accept without
thought. The film pays off in spades in both of these departments.</P>
<P>Jodie Foster has to have been the perfect choice to play Ellie. She's a
very strong character, but has weaknesses that Foster made the audience
believe. Every film I've seen Foster in has increased my respect for her
work and Contact has probably best displayed her flexibility as an actress
to date. The film was so much about Ellie, that very few other characters
had major roles. Notably though, most other characters without bit-parts
were given opportunities to show some development or different sides. I
rarely got the impression that they were one-dimensional cutouts.</P>
<P>The effects were excellent, but as I mentioned earlier, they serve only to
support the story. If you're expecting Independence Day, you'll get the
same quality effects, but they are attached to a very different type of
film. Particularly notable were the effects during the first test of the
machine. I distinctly recall that the whole theatre was completely silent.</P>
<P>And that wasn't the only time that the film had the crowd completely in its
thrall. But make no mistake, this isn't a film for everyone. If you're
looking for entertainment to be handed to you pre-digested, you're in the
wrong theatre. This is a film that requires you to think and pay attention.
Like any good piece of art, the onus is as much on the viewer as it is on
the artist and every viewer will take something different away from it. I
suspect that it shares that quality with 2001: A Space Odyssey but it's not
nearly as abstract. It's not an ID4 type of film and for that reason, I
very much doubt that it will be a runaway success. People seem not to want
to give anything to be entertained, despite the rewards. But because of
that, this film will be remembered for a very long time after ID4 is
forgotten.</P>
<P>I understand that Sagan was intimately involved with the film in an effort
to keep it true to the spirit of his work and to make sure that the science
was right. There he has succeeded brilliantly. No where will you find that
the filmmaker has bent the laws of physics for the purposes of the story.
How refreshing. And indeed that should never be necessary if it's taken
into account right from the start. Contact is one of the few examples of
hard SF that's ever made it to the screen intact. And that attention to
detail must've been contagious because it appears everywhere in the film.
The effect is so convincingly complete, that it's easy to forget you're
watching a completely fictional film. </P>
<P>Sadly, Sagan died during the production and never got to see the finished
product. He's given a touching tribute at the end with all the love and
respect he so richly deserved. I thought to myself that dedication was a
nice offering to his memory, but realised the whole film is largely a gift
from him to us. And what a gift.</P>
<P>Contact is easily the best science fiction film in a decade but it
transcends what Hollywood means when it says science fiction. It's a story
about humanity, not aliens. Don't under any circumstances miss this one.</P>
