<PRE>SCREAM
**** OF **** grade is A-</PRE>
<P>Scream is the best and worst thing to happen to the horror genre. 
Horror films were pretty much gone in recent years and Scream revived
them, it has also probably killed the horror film without
self-referencing dialogue.  Now like Halloween, Psycho or Night of the
Living Dead we have a horror film that will create scores of imitators,
for better or worse.</P>
<P>Scream starts with a masterpiece scene that could make an exceptional
short film.  A girl is home alone in a big spooky house.  She gets a
phone call from a stranger, who slowly becomes more threatening and
deadly.  The stranger then puts her through a movie trivia test, the
results of which could prove fatal to her.  These scenes are taunt and
unrelenting and start Scream's flare for taking standard horror film
cliches and turning them on their heads.</P>
<P>After the opening tension the film settles down into a group of
teenagers stuck in a horror film (al a Halloween, Friday the 13th, etc.)
and gives them satirically smart dialogue and a darkly comic surrounding
in their High School.  The group consists of two girls (Campbell - our
hero and McGowan) and four boys (Ulrich - Campbell's boyfriend, Lillard
- McGowan's boyfriend, and Kennedy - movie-addicted nerd).  </P>
<P>The film has many key scenes that work very well.  As when Kennedy
explains the probable killer to Lillard or as he explains the rules
("Never Have sex!." He yells as Campbell is deflowered).  There is also
a wonderful scene that has Campbell call the bluff of the killer on the
phone.</P>
<P>A lot of credit has to be paid to screenwriter Kevin Williamson and
director Wes Craven.  They both handle the film marvelously.  The
script, which was part of a major studio bidding war, is very smart and
funny.  So funny that most horror directors passed because they wee
confused of the films actual genre (even though the original title was
Scary Movie).  Craven is a natural choice to direct this film because he
never really takes his films that seriously anyway.  He tried a similar
mix of horror and comedy with Wes Craven's New Nightmare and Vampire in
Brooklyn, the first was successful.  He plays this film expertly careful
not to be too funny in key scenes that require empathy for dying
characters and he also finds ways to keep comedy up while anticipating
violence.</P>
