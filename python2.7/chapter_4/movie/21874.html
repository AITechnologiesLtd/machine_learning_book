<P>   Since "End of Days" and Neil Jordan's "The End of the
Affair" are playing simultaneously in many theaters, you just
might be confused about which to see.  I can imagine
Richard Kwientniowsky's creation, Giles De'ath, heading for
the literary film based on the Graham Greene novel and
winding up seeing a mediocre actor with big pecs throwing
his weight around in the far more visceral universe of Peter
Hyams.  He might exclaim, "I say, Ralph Fiennes must be
working out these days!"  On second thought, there is at least
one point of congruence between the plodding Canadian
novel and the high-speed vehicle for Arnold Schwarznegger. 
Graham Greene's book is suffused with a mystical run of
Catholic convictions, principally with a belief that some
minor miracles can happen in our own, expiring century. 
For example, when Sarah Miles gently kisses the cheek of
the young detective, his huge birthmark gradually disappears. 
More important, God presents Sarah with an apparent
miracle that ironically ends her affair with the novelist Maurice
Bendrix.</P>
<P>   Despite the belief in the occult that Greene shares with
"End of Days" director Peter Hyams, the audience for the two
movies is not likely to be the same.  The heavily marketed
millennium disaster movie is as high caliber as the Canadian
novel is lumbering and Schwarznegger is to Ralph Fiennes 
as Ed Wood is to Alfred Hitchcock.</P>
<P>   As chock full of logical flaws as it is loaded with brimstone
and fire, "End of Days," which features a mock, Greek-
tragedy ending (think Ajax), recalls such pseudo=religious
movies as "The Omen" and "Stigmata."  Despite its portrayal
of some high-ranking church officials as hoodlums, there
hasn't been a peep from the Vatican about the show while
Catholic groups have rallied against such dulcet, pro-faith
fairy tales like "Dogma."  Perhaps the obvious cartoonish
violence and pointless performances (wasting such talents as
Kevin Pollak and Miriam Margolyes) are so obviously tongue-
in-cheek that the theme could not offend anyone in the
audience.</P>
<P>  Nonetheless, "End of Days" is more watchable than some
critics would have you think.  Just observing Miriam
Margolyes beat the stuffing out of Arnold Schwarznegger
might be worth the price of admission.  The scene with
Gabriel Byrne as the Devil's agent speaking of his intended
bride "I'd treat her like a queen" will have to make do for
laughs in a film which--given the flat-falling one-liners of
Kevin Pollak--will have to make do for comedy.  In only one
case does Andrew W. Marlowe's script rise to the level of wit,
as The Man (Gabriel Byrne), infused with Satan's spirit,
compares the Bible to a publicist's press kit.  "When things
turn out well, we say 'It's God's will.'  When they turn out
bad, it's 'God works in mysterious ways.'"</P>
<P>   The story gets under way when a priest rushes into the
inner chambers of the Vatican to announce to the seated
Pope, "The child will be born today."  The year is 1979 and in
a hospital, a newborn girl is rushed from her mother's womb
to a mysterious chamber where doctors and nurses (including
the notable English performer Miriam Margolyes) observe as
a physician cuts open the belly of a snake and smears the
blood over the infant--who is ironically named Christine. 
Twenty years later, that little girl is a pixieish orphan (Robin
Tunney) who is destined to have a brief affair with the Devil
himself, to spend some time in bed while everyone else
crowds around Times Square to watch the birth of the new
millennium.  According to Scriptures--as interpreted by the
prescient priest (Rod Steiger)--during the final hour of our
own century, Satan is to mate with this particular woman,
who will give birth to the anti-Christ.  The Devil will then reign
over the Earth: unless, that is, a former cop, Jericho Cane
(Arnold Schwarznegger) who quit the force when the murder
of wife and child left him chronically depressed, can end the
affair before it begins.  With his cynically jocular partner
Chicago (Kevin Pollak), he determines to protect the 20-year-
old woman from The Man (who, as fans of Gabriel Byrne
know would be irresistible to women even if the Devil had not
entered his body).  </P>
<P>   "End of Days" features plenty of violence of the sort that
would have teens call out "Yeah!" and a couple of fairly sexy
near-encounters, one taking place near the podium of a
church.  If you can forget the logic by which The Man's body
can almost instantly heal damage done to it by bullets and
yet Jericho's bazooka-like artillery can down him for minutes
at a time, you can sit back and enjoy New York undergoing
more mayhem than usual as fires consume churches and
subway trains alike.  Y2K may yet end our days but Peter
Hyams interpretation of havoc is harmless.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 118 minutes.  (C) 1999
