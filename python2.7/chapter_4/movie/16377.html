THE SPY WHO LOVED ME
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Some films are good illustration how people's tastes and
movie preferences change through the years. Once upon a
time, the author of this review used to live in a blissful
world of childish ignorance. During that time, he honestly
believed that STAR WARS is the best motion picture ever
made, and that nothing on this world could match its quality
and impact. However, even in those times, there was a movie
that threatened the top spot of STAR WARS in this reviewer's
heart. It wasn't as spectacular or influential as STAR WARS,
but it managed to entertain me as no other film before. Its
name was THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, tenth film in the James Bond
series. For many years, I considered this film not only
among the best films ever made, but, naturally, the best
Bond film ever made. I had to wait for years before I had an
opportunity to change my mind after my movie-going
preferences matured and had an opportunity to watch classic
Bond films with Sean Connery. When I changed my mind, I
changed it by 180 degrees - THE SPY WHO LOVED ME was a
silly, unimaginative attempt by Bond franchise to cash in on
the contemporary trend of the 1970s. Then, years have passed
and things changed again. After a while, I began
appreciating this film again, and now, although I can't say
that it represents one of the best films ever made, it still
remains very good piece of entertainment.</P>
<P>Story begins with the mysterious disappearance of the
British nuclear submarine. In response to the crisis,
British government sends their best secret agent, James Bond
(Roger Moore), to investigate. His quest leads him to the
new, revolutionary submarine tracking system, that is put on
sale by few shady characters in Cairo. Bond comes there,
only to realize that his KGB counterpart, Major Ania Amasova
(Barbara Bach), wants the same thing, for the same reason -
somebody snatched a Soviet nuclear submarine too. While two
of them try to steal the precious data from each other and
in the same time evade professional killer nicknamed Jaws
(Richard Kiel), their respective government forge temporary
alliance. Bond and Amasova are now working together, faced
not only with their own unresolved sexual tension, but also
with some past issues - Bond had killed Amasova's colleague
and lover. Their investigation leads him to Stromberg (Curd
Juergens), oil tycoon who is obsessed with the underwater
life and who might be the link to the mystery of
disappearing submarines.</P>
<P>Like all of the first four Bond films with Moore as
Connery's replacement, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME finds its
inspiration in the popular cinematic trends of the 1970s.
While the previous two unsuccessfully tried to exploit
popularity of blaxploitation and kung fu films (and
MOONRAKER would two years later be more successful with
science- -fiction), this one pays homage to Steven
Spielberg's JAWS and the short- lived sub-genre of
underwater adventure. This might indicate the lack of
originality among the film-makers, but THE SPY WHO LOVED ME
was something quite opposite. Script by Christopher Wood and
Richard Maibaum was the first with plot that didn't have
even nominal resemblance to Ian Fleming's novel with the
same name. That gave film-makers enough freedom to make the
film as contemporary as possible. Unlike Fleming's Cold War
days, Soviets and West actually co-operate in the spirit of
detante; in the aftermath of oil crisis shipping tycoons are
the real nemesis of the free world; Bond's girl is his equal
in the era of feminism; finally, even immortal Bond musical
theme received disco treatment.</P>
<P>THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, because it was made in synchrony with
the moods, fashions and worldviews of the contemporary
audience, actually managed to fulfill almost impossible task
for a post-Connery Bond film - its reputation became almost
equal to the reputation of the classics. That shouldn't
surprise anyone, because this Bond has all the ingredients
of the classic formula - beautiful women, exotic locations,
daredevil stunts, spectacular scenes, impressive villain,
high-tech gadgetry and plot that deals with saving the world
from evil megalomaniacs. The concept is spiced with large
quantities of humor, and also by a lot of movie reference
jokes (one scene is direct allusion to LAWRENCE OF ARABIA,
while the other segment references BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN).</P>
<P>This Bond was good and entertaining, but it doesn't mean
that it was perfect. The special effects, while impressive
at some points (especially those dealing with Stromberg's
supertanker), are unscuccessful at others (blue screen ski
chase, that was saved by real-life stunt in the last shot).
The chief villain, played by not too enthusiastic Curd
Juergens, had undeveloped character and was definitely
bellow Bond standards. In that regard, it was from the
scriptwriters to spare his main sidekick Jaws for another
film. However, the biggest mistake was casting of Barbara
Bach as Anya Amasova; her lack of acting abilities was
almost painful at times, and her stunning look barely
manages to hide it. But, despite those flaws, THE SPY WHO
LOVED ME still remains a very good film, one of the best
Bonds ever made.</P>
