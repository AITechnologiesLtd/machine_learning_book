                       A film review by Mark Takacs
                        Copyright 1994 Mark Takacs</PRE>
<PRE>Twentieth Century Fox /  rated R
Starring:   Wesley Snipes   Theresa Randle              Abe Vigoda
                Michael Wright  Clarence Williams III   Ernie Hudson
Classification: Gangster Tragedy
Tak Rating: see it several times - full and/or matinee</PRE>
<P>One-Line-Summary
----------------
     A native drug lord in Harlem's Sugar Hill neighborhood tries to
break away from the cycle of violence and start a new life.</P>
<P>Tak Plot Summary
----------------
     SUGAR HILL revolves around Romello (Wesley Snipes), his brother
Ray Nathan (Michael Wright) and their father (Clarence Thomas III),
told from Romello's point of view.  With both parents as victims of
heroin addiction, native Harlem residents Romello and Ray Nathan now
control the drug action, supported by old-time mob suppliers.  Problems
arise when smart, educated Romello wants out, tired of the
hopelessness, fear and violence.  Forces beyond his control, including
mob ties, a new and more ruthless operator, and his own family, try to
convince him that his place is in Harlem.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts 
------------
     I love deadly serious, epic gangster movies like NEW JACK CITY,
JUICE, BOYZ IN THE HOOD, PUBLIC EYE, and THE GODFATHER series.  These
movies usually include slow motion shoot-outs, agonized and anguished
characters, and plenty of what could be considered melodramatic
scenes.  Sometimes they end on an upbeat note, and sometimes they end
like classical tragedies, with everyone dead or wishing they were.
SUGAR HILL manages to do both.  How?  I can't tell ya....</P>
<P>     The violence inherent in any drug/gangster movie was well handled
and not glamorized in the slightest.  When people get killed, tortured
or roughed up, it's not pretty, though it's not a gore-fest either.
It's stark, and all the more shocking.</P>
<P>     A friend of mine thought the pacing was slow, and even complained
about extraneous scenes, but I was totally into the movie and didn't
even notice the time.  Nor did I think any scenes were out of place.</P>
<P>     The scene under discussion involved Romello's love interest after
she spurns his lifestyle and goes out with an athlete, who ends up
almost raping her--instant asshole, just add alcohol.  She realizes
she had a good, loving man in Romello, especially as he's trying to
escape his old ways.  My friend argued that the whole "bad date" scene
was worthless, but I felt it served to explains why she returned after
so firmly rejecting him.</P>
<P>     Clarence Thomas III was wonderful as their shattered father.  A
former musician who used to deal but strayed, he was crippled by his
mob suppliers and was directly responsible for Romello's entry into a
criminal career.  Romello cares deeply for his father, a feeling not
shared by Ray, who can only see his father's failings.  Michael Wright
gives a believable performance as Ray Nathan, who is Romello's
constantly strung-out and emotionally insecure older brother.</P>
<P>     Wesley Snipes convinced me that Romello was intelligent,
street-wise and strong enough to establish his turf, yet also wise
enough to see that he's headed nowhere fast.  I believed he was a
basically good, caring person who had begun to regret the role he had
taken in life.  When I think about it, what I just wrote sounds really
implausible, but it worked, and worked well.</P>
<P>Tak Rating:
-----------
     I liked the intensity of SUGAR HILL.  The acting is first rate,
and I enjoyed the story.  If you like serious gang/drug dramas (verging
on tragedy) that depict the hopelessness and simultaneous struggle for
redemption, treat yourself to a performance of SUGAR HILL and then
bring some friends.</P>
