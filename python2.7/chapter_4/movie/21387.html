<P>Imagine that you're in the woods and you hear a noise.  Birds and other
animals scatter.  Something else is out there.  And it's getting closer.</P>
<P>If you think this is the latest Blair Witch spoof, you're dead-wrong
(and probably a victim of the non-stop internet ads announcing its video
release).  This story takes place some six centuries ago in feudal Japan
and the rustling in the woods is actually a giant boar covered with what
seems to be millions of earthworms.  Ashitaka sees this creature bearing
down on his village one day while riding his red elk through the
forest.  He believes the animal to be a threat (wouldn't you?) and slays
the beast, but not before it gives Ashitaka both an ominous message and
an itchy arm rash.</P>
<P>Instead of being hailed as a hero, Ashitaka (voiced by Billy Crudup,
Without Limits) is banished from the village as a result of the injury
to his arm.  Even though he is the Prince and the last in the bloodline
of a family that was driven from town 500 years ago, Ashitaka is told he
is suffering from an evil infection and booted out into the surrounding
forest to die.  While the infection may not actually be evil, it does
bestow Ashitaka with some strange powers.  When physically confronted,
he is able to knock the heads and arms off adversaries with a simple bow
and arrow.</P>
<P>Desperate to learn the mysteries of the giant boar and seeking a cure to
his affliction, Ashitaka heads for Iron Town, an industrial village
compromised of women that are nearly busting out of their tops.  Why
they don't call it `Cleavage Town' is beyond me, as it would certainly
be a boom for local tourism.  Ashitaka meets Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver,
An Ideal Husband), the leader of Iron Town hell-bent on rampaging
through the lush Japanese forests to use its untapped natural resources
for iron production.</P>
<P>This puts Eboshi at odds with San (or Princess Mononoke), a human raised
by the Wolf Gods.  San (Claire Danes, Brokedown Palace) is intent on
stopping the progress of encroaching civilization, which could threaten
to disturb the forces of nature.  The main force of nature is a creature
called the Forest Spirit, which changes into the Night Walker at dusk.
Confusing?  Yes, but better than Night Walker, Texas Ranger.</P>
<P>The animated Princess Mononoke was a runaway box office success in Japan
a couple of years ago, second all-time only to a little film called
Titanic.  The battle between environment and industry probably played
well in Japan, but I just can't see too many Americans getting into the
story.  In order for a cartoon to succeed in this country, we apparently
need a linear plot and upbeat musical numbers.  Look what happened to
The Iron Giant.  Never mind the complicated story - the half-wits here
in America won't even be able to tell Ashitaka and San apart.  Okay,
neither could I.  They both looked like Speed Racer.  It's too long and
violent for children and seems to be targeted to the small segment of
our population that enjoys Japanese anime.</P>
<P>On the plus side, Mononoke's landscapes look pretty fantastic, but not
as good as Tarzan.  Writer/director Hayao Miyazaki – a.k.a. the Japanese
Walt Disney – has crafted a very intelligent story about the
co-existence of humans and the forest.  The version that will hit U.S.
theaters was dubbed in English and spiced up by Neil Gaiman, who created
a popular monthly comic called "The Sandman".  And there were these
really cool cuddly little tree-dwelling creatures called Kodama that
shook their heads and made a sound like the one that coincided with the
appearance of the Tiki idol in the Hawaiian episodes of The Brady
Bunch.  A bit heavy-handed, but still enjoyable.</P>
<P>2:17 - PG-13 for images of violence and gore</P>
