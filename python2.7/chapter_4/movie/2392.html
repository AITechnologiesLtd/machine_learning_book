<P>     This certainly isn't the first motion picture to focus on
father/daughter bonding, nor will it be the last.  But I'LL DO ANYTHING
has the distinction of being enjoyable and entertaining, while bringing
a new twist or two to an old subject.  Not everything works out quite
as expected, and that's the biggest element of the movie's charm,
because these days it's usually too easy to predict what's coming
next.</P>
<P>     In 1980, Matt Hobbs (Nick Nolte) was nominated for an Emmy that he
didn't win.  On the night of the awards ceremony, he and longtime
girlfriend Beth (Tracey Ullman) decided to get married.  Seven years
later, around the time that Matt and Beth's marriage was beginning to
fray, their only child Jeannie (Whittni Wright) arrived.  By 1993, the
pair have not only divorced, but are living on opposite coasts.  With
his career in a state of collapse, Matt agrees to become the chauffeur
of powerful movie producer Burke Adler (Albert Brooks), a man with a
heart of stone and a disposition to match.  While performing his new
job, Matt catches the attention of Cathy Breslow (Joely Richardson),
one of Adler's assistants.  Then, just as a little cash starts flowing
in, Matt has to fly out to Georgia to pick up his daughter for a
"visit."  When he gets there, however, he learns that Beth is on her
way to jail, and he's been lumbered with a little girl who he hasn't
seen for two years.</P>
<P>     Kids in movies generally come in one of two categories:
sickeningly cute or terminally annoying.  Young Whittni Wright has a
membership in both clubs.  More importantly, however, she can act,
unlike many of the crop of under-ten performers.  There are a few
scenes where she fails to convince, but far more in which she's
entirely believable.  If Ms. Wright avoids the "Culkin syndrome", she
could have a bright future.</P>
<P>     As always, Nick Nolte is the consummate professional, and his
supporting cast is equally solid.  Especially noteworthy is Albert
Brooks, playing a tough-as-nails, repressed movie producer who has
trouble committing to a relationship.  This isn't a unique role, but
Mr. Brooks acts the part with gusto.</P>
<P>     I'LL DO ANYTHING is blessed with a wonderful screenplay that
shares equal parts drama and comedy.  The emotional texture is
surprisingly firm, especially as it relates to Matt and Jeannie, but
there are plenty of laughs to be had.  Much of the script works because
it rarely strays from the commonplace.  Since the audience can
therefore relate to the characters and their situations, the movie has
an impact.  Those scenes that go over-the-top, such as the incident
with Jeannie running around screaming on an airplane, come across as
silly and unnecessary.</P>
<P>     I'LL DO ANYTHING presents similar themes to those developed in,
among other projects, THE PLAYER, THE BIG PICTURE, and MISTRESS.  The
satire isn't as biting because the overall intention is to create a
human interest story rather than a cynical look at a jaded industry
ripe for parody.</P>
<P>     Movies about parent/child relationships are usually riddled with
formulas.  However, while James Brooks' project occasionally allows a
too-pat resolution to slip by, there are a few minor surprises.  I'LL
DO ANYTHING can justifiably boast a freshness and intelligence too
often absent from motion pictures.  Just take a look at MY FATHER THE
HERO for an example of how a film can take a similar idea and
completely botch it.</P>
<P>     The greatest strength of I'LL DO ANYTHING isn't difficult to
pinpoint--it has immense appeal.  Not only is the movie well-scripted
and competently-acted, but it presents its characters in such a way
that the audience can feel for them without being aware of overt
manipulation.  Mr. Brooks, the director of such films as BROADCAST NEWS
and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, has delivered a rare jewel in the bleakness of
February's movie wasteland.  I'LL DO ANYTHING may have started out life
as a failed musical, but with judicious edits and re-shoots, it has
become a thoroughly enjoyable dramatic comedy.</P>
