<PRE>                               MAXIMUM RISK
                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1996 Bryant Frazer</PRE>

<P>You've got to think twice before you go see a movie with a
title like MAXIMUM RISK.</P>
<P>The title is generic. It's meaningless. And I can't believe
it's good business. When you pick up the phone and dial
777-FILM, how in the world are you supposed to remember that
the new Jean-Claude Van Damme movie, the one that looked kind
of cool in the trailers and is directed by some Chinese hot
shot, is called, geez, MAXIMUM RISK? Yuck.</P>
<P>The movie itself deserves your attention. For sweet bloody
thrills, this one beats the summer blockbuster competition
hands-down. Only MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE came close to delivering
as skillful a thriller, and I'll give Maximum Risk the edge
simply because it's not as slick as the Tom Cruise picture,
and therefore more gratifying in its execution.</P>
<P>Much to my surprise, Van Damme continues to develop as a
pleasant, unpretentious action hero. His track record isn't
as solid as Schwarzenegger's, but he's a hell of a lot more
adventurous than Arnold. In 1993, Van Damme worked with Hong
Kong's premier hardcore action director, John Woo, on a
fairly lame movie called HARD TARGET. (If you can find a bootleg
copy, Woo's radically different director's cut is much better
than what was eventually released.) This follow-up is
directed by Ringo Lam (CITY ON FIRE, FULL CONTACT), whose
Hong Kong films are distinguished action pictures that have
consistently played second fiddle to Woo's more operatic
offerings. The surprise here is that MAXIMUM RISK is a more
effective Hollywood action flick than either HARD TARGET or
Woo's subsequent BROKEN ARROW.</P>
<P>Here's the rundown. Van Damme plays a French cop named Alain
Moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend (Jean-Hugues
Anglade) finds a corpse that's Alain's exact double. Turns
out Alain was separated at birth from his twin brother,
Michael, who has been killed by some Russian heavies (and
some strangely American looking cops). Alain does some
investigating. He finds that Michael had booked a flight to
New York City, and received a message from someone there
named Alex Bohemia. Assuming Michael's identity, Alain flies
to New York and gets tangled up with Michael's girlfriend
(Natasha Henstridge), the FBI, and the Russian mob in Little
Odessa.</P>
<P>That's as much as you need to know. The story is adequate,
but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are
basically explained to you twice, just in case you go out for
popcorn at the wrong moment. There's a love story, too, but I
didn't find it terribly convincing, partly because ex-model
Henstridge is too high-strung in her high-profile debut (she
had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in SPECIES).
She's great to look at, and she can certainly read a line,
but what she does here can't really be described as "acting."
Of course, "acting" isn't really what she was hired for (I
lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than Van
Damme's).</P>
<P>The movie is exceptionally violent, bordering on gratuity.
(Keep that in mind when planning your date.) The stunts are
spectacular, and the fact that you can spot Van Damme's
stand-in makes his work no less impressive. There's only so
much you can do with a car wreck, but this movie makes crisp,
effective use of pile-ups in a handful of frenzied
destruction derbies. And Lam has a surprising, innovative
sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit
of action.</P>
<P>The main difference between Lam and Woo, I believe, is that
while Woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show
pieces, Lam has figured out more about using cinematic space
and double-barreled points of view to make things run. Don't
get me wrong -- when Chow Yun-Fat soars through space pumping
bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with
glass and confetti littering the air around him in Woo's
HARD-BOILED, it's an amazing moment. But it's a moment that's
hard to reproduce in Hollywood. (For one thing, Hollywood
doesn't yet have Chow Yun-Fat!)</P>
<P>While Woo's Hollywood movies look like the work of a talented
upstart, MAXIMUM RISK is a surprisingly confident picture.
The very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view
of a chase through the streets of a European city, but Lam's
use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on. The
film editing is a particularly savvy complement to Lam's
shooting style, accentuating rather than amplifying the
action.</P>
<P>The performances could have used some fine tuning (in
particular, there's an annoying, overwritten Manhattan cab
driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or
jettisoned completely), and the movie doesn't always overcome
the limitations of its genre. The story is a little mundane,
although there are some effective moments involving Van
Damme's unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew
he had. But it's not often that Hollywood cranks out a truly
satisfying action picture, and it's doubly surprising that
this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity. Van
Damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the
man's best movie, and international action buffs will no
doubt savor this flavorful Hong Kong/Hollywood hybrid.</P>
