<PRE>   In 2001 you'll hear it told, 
   This movie "Glitter" is not gold. </PRE>
<P>   If the Bard is watching the screen from high above the clouds, 
he'd probably say "I told you so!"  "Glitter," which yields more 
unintentional humor than any other movie since Paul 
Verhoeven's "Showgirls," is a sappy, soapy, songfest which, if 
the film were a debut for Mariah Carey might have ended her 
career before it ever started.  Her large public would have been 
thwarted,  missing the mellifluous tones of the person whom 
Billboard Magazine in 1999 called The Artist of the Decade. 
Cheryl L. West's story is subverted by some of scripter Kate 
Lanier's dialogue, a sample of which comes from Ms. Carey's 
character's introduction to a large audience at Madison Square 
Garden, "Do not take your friend for granted: you'll never know 
when you'll lose him."  Featuring scenes borrowed from the naive 
romances of the 1950's, Vondie Curtis-Hall's film is a fictionalized 
homage to Mariah Carey, one of pop song's most celebrated 
vocalists of the nineties who was responsible for selling 140 
million albums and singles, earning 84 gold, platinum and multi- 
platinum certifications.  </P>
<P>   Mariah Carey, who is physically as endowed as is her voice, 
fills the screen in virtually every scene in the role of Billie Frank, 
who at the age of eleven or so is abandoned by her mother Lillian 
(Valarie Pettiford), a traumatic event which causes Billie to be 
mistrustful of the kindness of strangers.  Director Curtis-Hall 
introduces young Billie (Isabel Gomes) observing her mom's 
performance in a night club, shyly joining her in a song before a 
respectful but small audience.  When her mother is fired and 
financial problems loom, Billie is turned over to a social services 
agency, later attracting the attention of a second-rate producer, 
Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard). Walker is pushed aside by 
popular DJ Julian Dice (Max Beesley),  who persuades her to 
turn her production contract over to him.  Little does Dice realize 
that his own coup will be topped by some major talent in the 
industry, forcing this handsome young man--who has become 
her lover--to surrender his find to the big guys. </P>
<P>    Filmed by Geoffrey Simpson in Toronto and New York, with 
some stunning footage from (sigh) the World Trade Center, the 
chic Soho neighborhood and Madison Square Garden, "Glitter" is 
awash with Terence Blanchard's score, featuring so many songs 
(performed by talent including Mariah Carey's own "All my Life," 
"I Didn't Mean to Turn You On," and "Loverboy" plus an 
assortment of pop favorites by Stevie Wonder, The Strikers, 
Zapp, Whodini and others) that we in the audience are virtually 
MTV'd rather than able to enjoy whole pieces sung  passionately 
by Ms. Carey.  "Glitter" is not unlike George Cuckor's 1954 
semimusical "A Star is Born,"about a doomed Hollywood star 
couple featuring Judy Garland as a performer on the way up 
while James Mason is on his way down.  While Mariah Carey's 
songs simply cannot compel like the classics of Harold Arlen and 
Ira Gershwin and the script bears none of the quality of Moss 
Hart's for the Cuckor classic, the fatal flaw is the series of 
borrowed and banal interplays between Billie and her first real 
boyfriend, Dice.  Watch especially for the poorly directed scene 
featuring Billie's walking out on Dice after the former has gone 
through a jealous tantrum and particularly for an unintentionally 
laughable juxtaposition of their getting together, as Dice and 
Billie, now living apart, seem to be communicating by ESP, the 
estranged couple separately composing a song as though they 
were in the same room. </P>
<P>   Max Beesley is the one standout performer, working 
courageously with a fatuous script while Mariah Carey--who 
insists that her rendition of Billie Frank is only marginally 
autobiographical--acts throughout like a wide-eyed tourist who 
has just arrived from Kansas for a week in the Big Apple rather 
than a world-class singer who climaxes her career as the star 
performer at Madison Square Garden. </P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 98 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
