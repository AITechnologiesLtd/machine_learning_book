<P>Plunkett & MaCleane marks the directing debut of Jake Scott, brother of
Ridley and Tony. Naturally, this got me worried. Would Jake's talent be
inherited from Ridley or Tony? If it was from Ridley, than the movie would
be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in. If it was from Tony, it
would be wham bang drivel. Unfortunately, the latter is true for this
worthless picture with little charm. Carlyle and Miller are the titular
highwaymen, Plunkett (Carlyle) who is poor and unruly, and Captain James
MaCleane (Miller) a clean cut gentleman. As the tagline clearly wants to
make known, they rob the rich and nothing else. The film basically follows
the rowdy hold ups the two stage, along with romantic interludes with Lady
Rebecca (Tyler.) Hot on both their tails is Mr Chance (Ken Stott) who wants
to see them both dead.</P>
<P>Plunkett & MaCleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose.
Although undoubtedly slick and fast paced, there's very little merit
contained in the film. Carlyle and Miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed
pair, although their characters are criminally undeveloped. It appears that
much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes,
but not on the script. The five(!) screenwriters (three credited) have
produced an still born movie: there's very little development in the story.
Also, major events, such as Mr. Cash finding out who Plunkett and MaCleane
really are, are so rushed that they barely happened. The story is a bit of a
mess, frankly.</P>
<P>The performances aren't bad: Carlyle and Miller are typical lads, but Liv
Tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest. Her irritable, stilted
performance sticks out like a sore thumb, and I was quite unsure on what
accent she was trying to put on. She looks nice, though. More interesting is
Alan Cummings as the campy Lord Rochester, and although his character
amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character, he hams
it up well. Ken Stott is suitably evil as Chance, but again he is nothing
but a flat character. I didn't particularly care when the predictable death
sequence arrived.</P>
<P>Although a disappointment in writing, and a minor success in acting, the
film certainly look lavish, with good costumes, and wonderful sets. But
production design alone can't save a movie, especially a movie as bad as
this mess. Jake Scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather
than this failed update of a period drama: the only update seems to be the
fact that everyone must talk dirty, with 'f*ck this' and 'stand and f*cking
deliver' splattered all over the place. The MTV editing and direction are
flash enough, but in the end decidedly empty.</P>
<P>Plunkett & MaCleane is a massive disappointment. Although somewhat enjoyable
during parts, it's so light it could float off the screen if it wasn't just
images on a reel. There's no thought, no development, no plot, just a series
of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to
Gen-Xers. Although it's a great idea: update a period drama to the MTV
generation: it's execution is awful, and would more likely bore than excite.
Sloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless, it's hard to recommend
Plunkett & MaCleane as a movie, but easy to recommend it as a overlong music
video. Give it a miss.</P>
