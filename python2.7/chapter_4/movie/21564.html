<PRE>Review:          Music of the Heart</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Meryl Streep, Angela Bassett, Cloris Leachman, Aidan Quinn, 
                Gloria Estefan, Jean-Luke Figueroa</PRE>
<PRE>Director:        Wes Craven</PRE>
<P>The fact that this movie is rated PG will probably work against it.  Too
many people will think that it would be drab and boring.  It's not. 
Actually, there is violence (a killing), racial bigotry, and sex among
other things.  There isn't anyone who won't identify with someone in this
film.  If you've ever struggled with practice to learn to play any
instrument, or if you've had to listen to someone else practice, you will
sympathize with that actor.</P>
<P>Basically, this is true story of a woman, Roberta Guaspari (Streep) who
teaches violin in a Harlem school.  Sure, you know where the storyline is
going.  If she didn't succeed, they wouldn't have made the film, now would
they?  But this is the story of the road she takes to achieve her goal. 
She teaches her pupils, their parents, and the staff much more than how to
play the violin.   She also helps her two sons overcome the problems that
accompany her divorce from their father.  They manage to grow into
upstanding young men despite the living conditions that are thrust upon
them.</P>
<P>I wish that movies such as this were compulsory for children to see.  We
‘re all aware of the multiple problems facing today's youth.  Some of it
is addressed here, such as the racial tension that exists between Ramon, a
Hispanic boy and his classmate, an African-American.  Their classroom
argument ends with Ramon telling the other boy to drop dead.  That
evening, when the boy is killed by a drive-by shooting, Ramon feels
responsible for his death.  Roberta reassures Ramon that if he had such
powers, he would be the world's greatest violinist!  More important, if we
are not exposed to good, classical music when we are young; we miss out on
one of the most pleasurable things in life.  No, liking the classics does
not make you a nerd….it makes you a more well rounded person.  This is
truly a `feel-good' movie.  Give yourself a treat and see it.  It's an A,
all the way.  I could see it over and over again.</P>
