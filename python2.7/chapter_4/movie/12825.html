<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>Two Girls and a Guy is most easily summed up with the five words of its
title.  It's about two girls, Carla (Heather Graham) and Lou (Natasha
Gregson Wagner), and a guy, Blake (Robert Downey Jr.).  The two girls
meet outside of Blake's apartment building, at which point they realize
that they're waiting for the same guy.  It turns out that they're both
his girlfriends, and that he's been lying to them for the past ten
months.  They break into Blake's apartment, and have a lively
conversation about their mutual boyfriend.</P>
<P>Through about fifteen minutes of constant dialogue, they learn that
he's said the same things to both of them, word for word.  (My favorite
line is, "You own my [penis].  It's attached to me, but you own it."). 
Soon, Blake returns home, and his girlfriends hide out for several
minutes as he calls his mother, and then goes to the mirror and sings a
few tunes for himself.  At this point, Carla makes herself seen, and
they have a long conversation in which she toys with him and tries to
get him to admit his guilt.  Finally, Lou emerges from the closet, and
they engage in a big, hostile argument.</P>
<P>Written and directed by James Toback, Two Girls and a Guy is a static
picture that takes place almost entirely inside Blake's apartment, with
almost no lapses in time or jumps in action.  There are a lot of very
funny scenes, but there are also a lot of strange moments that feature
inconsistent tones and weird story developments (there isn't much of a
story, but it does develop a little bit).  Too much of the film feels
staged (the picture probably would have worked better as a play) and
doesn't quite strike me as realistic.  It's never a boring picture, but
there are almost as many flaws as there are laughs.  </P>
<P>Take, for instance, Toback's direction.  Since there isn't a lot of
movement (although the apartment is enormous and very interesting to
look at), there isn't much room for cinematography or intricate
camerawork.  And there really shouldn't be a lot of camerawork, but
Toback tries to do the pretentious artistic thing, which results in
really strange camera angles, random zoom-ins and zoom-outs, lots of
focus shifts (the person speaking is out of focus), and other such
pointless tricks.  It certainly doesn't help the film, and really just
calls attention away from the dialogue.</P>
<P>A lot of the dialogue is funny, and a lot of the segments work well as
stand-alone pieces (the film is episodic and can be watched in portions
without seeing the entire thing).  My favorite scene has Blake cornered
in his bathroom as Carla explains that she's been with four other men,
and Lou tells him that she's been with three women.  It's funny, and
works on the right kind of humor.  Most of the scenes that work don't
feel forced, and they are funny because of their realism.</P>
<P>But there are a lot of things here that simply feel strange.  The
entire subplot with Blake's mother is very odd, and never feels quite
right (even the end is completely ambiguous, and neither of the two
possibilities for what actually happened seem very plausible).  Halfway
through the film, Carla and Blake engage in a gratuitous marathon of
mutual masturbation and oral sex, and the reasons for this are not
apparent.  Blake also fakes a suicide at one point just to "prove a
point" as he says; but, the scene is strange and just wouldn't be
feasible in real life.</P>
<P>All of the acting is entertaining.  Downey is, of course, funny, and
seems allowed to roam free and do whatever he wants here (and he does
one hell of a Hamlet, I might add).  Graham is wonderful and beautiful,
and she just makes me want to look at her forever.  Wagner, an actress
I've not seen before, is also adequately spunky and is right for the
role.  It seems that a lot of the film is improvisation, and I think the
three performers have done a good job of staying with their characters
and making the film fun to watch.</P>
<P>Two Girls and a Guy is a reasonably interesting picture, but it has the
feel of a film that was thrown together on a whim, one that needed more
input from other sources.  I'm not sure if this kind of material is
right for film on its own, mostly because Toback doesn't utilize the
advantages that film has over other mediums.  And he's a talented
writer, but someone else should have been involved to mediate the scenes
that are peripheral and just plain strange.  I'm not sure if I liked Two
Girls and a Guy, but at least it kept me interested.</P>
