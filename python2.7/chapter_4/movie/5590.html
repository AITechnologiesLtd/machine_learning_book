                       A film review by Chuck Dowling

<P>I was a big fan of the ABC television series, and most likely the only one
according to the ratings. (Well, my mom watched it too but we both watched
it on the same TV so that really doesn't count now does it?) I was also one
of the first in line the day the film opened. After watching it, I can
safely say that I have never come out of a theater angry, as I did that day.
Not disappointed, but angry. The first twenty minutes of the film were quite
promising, but after that it's one of the worst films of all time,
regardless if you are a fan of the TV show or not.</P>
<P>The TV show was really all about a murder in a small town and the
investigation which followed. The show lasted a year and a half, and the
final episode ended with a cliffhanger. So when It was announced that a
feature film was being made, I was more than overjoyed. Well guess what, the
film turns out to be a prequel to the TV show and just shows in detail (and
I do mean detail) the events that happened the week before the murder. These
are events that we already knew about and were satisfied with the way they
were presented. There was no reason to make this film about those events.
What writer/ director /creator David Lynch should have done is to continue
on with the show from the final episode instead of retreading on familiar
material.</P>
<P>Halfway through this mess, the film seems to jump forward in time, but then
again not really. Anyway, a reference is made to the cliffhanger ending and
you would think that would mean that eventually, before the film is over,
that plot line will be resolved. It's not. It's not even really mentioned
again. I think Lynch slipped that scene into the film so that the audience
wouldn't walk out, that bastard.</P>
<P>Twin Peaks:Fire Walk With Me is loaded with contradictions from the TV show,
and unnecessary language, violence, nudity, and sex. The hero of the TV
series, cool FBI agent Dale Cooper (MacLachlin) is reduced to a mere cameo.
The only good thing about the film is the score. This was easily the worst
film from all of 1992. It was even booed when it was shown at the Cannes
Film Festival, and deservedly so.</P>
<P>There are many other problems I had with the film, but thay are all plot
specific and only people who watched both the show and the film would
understand them. If your interested, email me at <A HREF="mailto:chuckd21@southeast.net">chuckd21@southeast.net</A> and
I'll discuss them with you in detail.</P>
