<PRE>Bounce </PRE>
<P>Did you notice Hollywood doesn't really make romances anymore? Movies today 
are rarely centered around a man and woman who meet, fall in love, have their 
share of problems and either break up or stay together forever. That only 
tends to happen in "period pieces" or as sub-plots in movies about other 
subjects. "Bounce" is the first movie to come along in a while that's 
actually set in the present day, is about real people really falling for each 
other. The problem is there's a secret between them, it's the film's niche 
but it becomes so overbearing at times the romance becomes virtually 
unbelievable. </P>
<P>Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow star here as Buddy Amaral and Abby Janello. 
They're good friends in real life and each has played romantic leads in other 
movies about modern-day star-crossed lovers. They come together here in a 
rather unusual way and once they get together they're immediately locked into 
a close-knit relationship. </P>
<P>The film tells the story of how Buddy met Abby - through a traumatic situation
that some might pin on fate but others might attribute to luck but the 
most cynical will say randomness has nothing to do with it. </P>
<P>Buddy is a Los Angeles-based advertising exec stuck at O'Hare airport in 
Chicago waiting for his flight to get clearance to take off in the snowy 
weather. While waiting in an airport bar he picks up a hot chick named Mimi 
(Natasha Henstridge) and befriends a man named Greg. The three converse as if 
they were old friends. Buddy is funny and charming and when he hears Greg 
talk about how he wishes he could get home to L.A. earlier Buddy gives him 
his plane ticket and manages to convince the airline's ticket checker to let 
him on no problem (which is a serious FAA violation in case you didn't know - 
I didn't). That plane crashes. Buddy feels a little relieved he wasn't on 
that flight and a little sorry Greg had to die but it bounces off his thick 
shell quite easily. Meanwhile we cut back to L.A.and meet Greg's wife Abby 
who is put through an emotional hell because she was certain Greg wasn't on 
that flight and shouldn't have been. </P>
<P>I'd seen the preview for "Bounce" at least 20 times this summer and it 
portrayed the love affair between Buddy and Abby as being purely chance. 
However, the actual screenplay here is much different and I think I have to 
take the more cynical route in discussing how Buddy and Abby meet and fall in 
love. </P>
<P>Buddy enters re-hab for three months and upon his release he tracks down 
Greg's family. He stalks Abby for a day and pretends to be an interested 
buyer in the property she's showing (Abby's a real estate agent), but is so 
smitten by her beauty he can't bring himself to tell the truth and pursues 
her as he would any other woman. Through a series of pretty quirky and 
somewhat humour events the two flirt, have a lot of awkward pauses, go on one 
date, almost decide to give up on each other, but then quickly realize they 
probably are perfect for each other and suddenly fall into a very serious 
relationship. </P>
<P>There's really no sub-plots going on throughout this movie. The screenplay is 
focused mainly on Buddy and his battle with his inner demons over whether he 
should tell Abby he's responsible for her husband's death. He's also a 
recovering alcoholic and there's a few scenes of drama along those lines. Not 
surprisingly Buddy's assistant is a young gay man who's also a recovering 
drunk and gives him the kick in the pants and makes for the obligatory gay 
one-liners we've come to expect in such movies (but which are funnier on 
television). </P>
<P>For the most part "Bounce" works as a fine dramedy. It's constantly on the 
edge between super-serious drama and all-out melodrama. Let's face it, under 
these circumstances can this story really be told in a believable, realistic 
manner? </P>
<P>Writer/director Don Roos does his best to pull it off but he only partially 
succeeds. The film is very reminiscent of another Ben Affleck romantic 
dramedy, "Chasing Amy." The romance between Buddy and Abby is pretty much 
plugged-in and implied through a lot of musical montages and cute scenes of 
Buddy having to meet Abby's friends and relatives and relate to her two young 
boys. Paltrow's screen time is surprisingly short compared to Affleck's, and 
most of what she does on film is look pretty, try hard not to cry, and spout 
a lot of dramatic cliches. </P>
<P>The last act of the film takes a turn for the worst in all ways, for both the 
characters and the movie itself. It becomes a rollercoaster of emotional 
battles and thus many tear-jerking scenes ensue. I have no problem with drama 
but "Bounce" dabbles with melodrama and tries to play it off as nothing and 
it doesn't work. The story is very predictable when things get so dramatic so 
you feel you're being pandered to than watching an authentic drama. </P>
<P>"Bounce" might have worked a lot better if it had a different hook. That 
Buddy and Abby are able to get together despite the fact he's indirectly 
responsible for her husband's death is an acceptable premise. The way the 
story is told just doesn't convey that as plausible. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B- </PRE>
