                      Film reviews by Evelyn C. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Evelyn C. Leeper</PRE>
<P>THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT, directed by Stephan
Elliott, Australia, 1:42:</P>
<P>     This is a "road picture," but what a road!  Through the wide open
spaces of the center of Australia travels "Priscilla, Queen of the
Desert," an old and not very luxurious bus, along with Priscilla's
passengers, three drag queens on their way to a gig in Alice Springs.
They meet various people (including the obligatory meeting with native
Australians), have adventures, and reveal their personalities and
problems to each other along the way.</P>
<P>     This is a movie with a lot of style--not surprising, given the
occupation of the main characters.  In fact, one of the film's messages
seems to be that when it comes to style, drag queens have it all over
the rest of us.  (The scene as the bus pulls out of Sydney is hardly
subtle in this regard.)</P>
<P>     THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT has some things
to say, but its value lies in the interesting characters, especially
Terence Stamp as a transsexual drag queen past her prime, and the sheer
pleasure of watching flamboyance on a grand scale.  It may not be a
great film, but it certainly is a fun one.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>THE SECRET ADVENTURES OF TOM THUMB, directed by Dave Borthwick, Great
Britain, 1:01:</P>
<P>     This is a very difficult film to describe.  It uses an animation
technique I can't recall seeing before in which the "live action"
actors are filmed in stop motion as well as the clay figures.  (Or
maybe they film the actors in the regular way, then remove some frames
and duplicate others.)  In any case this is fascinating from a visual
standpoint, but definitely not for children (in spite of what the title
might lead you to believe).  Tom lives in a very dark world, full of
disturbing images, swarms of strange insects, and unspeakable
scientific experiments.  It seems at times more like something out of
Franz Kafka than a children's fairy tale book.</P>
<P>     This is not for everyone's taste (though it played to an almost
full house here), and given its length (or lack thereof), is unlikely
to play in "normal" theaters anyway.  Look for this at theaters which
shown experimental film, film festivals, or perhaps science fiction
conventions (which seem a perfect venue for it).  Rating: +2 (-4 to
+4).</P>
<P>MESMER, directed by Roger Spottiswoode, Great Britain/Canada/Germany,
1:42:</P>
<P>     Franz Anton Mesmer has been considered both a charlatan and a
visionary. This film makes no definitive judgment, but seems to fall
into the visionary camp, albeit perhaps a misguided visionary.</P>
<P>     Played by Alan Rickman, Mesmer is a man who sees the practice of
medicine in his day (the 18th Century) as barbaric, which of course it
was.  The cure for almost every ill was to bleed the patient.  Mesmer
takes a different approach.  Calling on "animal magnetism," he attempts
to use magnetic currents and forces to cure his patients.  He achieves
some notable successes, but many of the cures seem to be temporary and
the patients relapse.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, much of Mesmer's philosophy regarding his
treatments (the term "mesmerism" is never used) seems as bizarre today
as it did to the established medical professionals then.  It is left
for the audience to see the seeds of hypnotism, the power of
suggestion, holistic medicine, and the nature of psychosomatic
illnesses in Mesmer's explanations of the pull of the moon and magnetic
forces.  Although Rickman is very good (I refuse to call his portrayal
mesmerizing, though Lord knows someone will), and Amanda Ooms excellent
as his patient Maria Theresa Paradies, some of the supporting
characters are rather sketchily drawn.  In the end it is perhaps the
strangeness of Mesmer's philosophy which makes it difficult for
screen-writer Dennis Potter to give us a character we can understand.
Rating: +1 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>THE ADVOCATE, directed by Leslie Megahey, Great Britain, 1:35:</P>
<P>     The year is 1452.  The place is Abbeville, France. To this small
village comes Robert Courtois to serve as the advocate (the public
defender).  His first case is defending a man accused of killing his
wife's lover.  That goes pretty well.  Then he defends a woman accused
of witchcraft; that case does not go so well.  His third case is even
more peculiar by own standards, and we begin to see that what at first
seemed like isolated aberrations in the law are actually part of a
larger insanity.  Or as the priest says, "In a world where nothing is
reasonable, nothing can be said to be truly mad."</P>
<P>     Colin Firth as the advocate in this film (which I might describe
as "THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE Meets TWELVE ANGRY MEN") seems a bit
out of his depth in a cast containing Nicol Williamson as the local
seigneur, Ian Holm as the priest, Donald Pleasence as the local
prosecutor, and Michael Gough as the magistrate.  But then the
character of the advocate finds himself a bit out of his depth as well.</P>
<P>     It may seem odd to say that a mystery set in a period of
superstition, prejudice, and the Inquisition in France has some very
funny moments, but Megahey's script takes advantage of the weirdness
going on all around, and the actors carry the humor off quite well.
The supporting cast looks authentic to the era (perhaps more so than
most of the principals), although not quite to the level of the casting
in THE NAME OF THE ROSE.  If THE ADVOCATE occasionally has the look of
a made-for-television film, that may be in part due to the fact that
the BBC was one of its financiers, and also to the fact that Megahey's
background is in television and this is his first feature film.</P>
<P>     This is a very entertaining film that is (so far as I can tell)
historically accurate to its time period.  (For example, all the court
cases are based on actual court cases of the time.)  I recommend it
highly.  Rating: +3 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>CYBERTEENS IN LOVE, directed by Brett Dowler, Canada, 1:33:</P>
<P>     Shot on video, this definitely has the look of a student film,
though technically the filmmakers were not students, but were working
under the auspices of British Columbia Film and the National Film Board
of Canada (Pacific Center).  The acting of some of the supporting cast
is mediocre to bad (although Carole Henshall is perfect as Kid Cutter).
The computer animation is fairly basic for today.  The staging of some
of the action sequences is pretty lame.  Even the basic plot is
unimaginative: girl escapes from state-run orphanage, finds love with
street-smart computer wiz, and gets involved in adventures and danger
in cyberspace.  But the script by John Dowler shows great imagination
and creativity in its use of "futurespeak."  For example, a rhetorical
question becomes an "answer-free question" and Su doesn't try to find
her family, she tries to "family-find."</P>
<P>     The film does have a lot of rough edges, but the dialogue helps
you past a lot of that, with its poetry and flow.  Rating: +1 (-4 to
+4).</P>
<P>TOTAL BALALAIKA SHOW, directed by Aki Kaurismaki, Finland, 0:56:</P>
<P>     One newspaper complained about the choice of this as one of the
free outdoor shows of the festival because they felt it was nothing but
an extended music video, and not even Canadian.  Of course, the same
could be said of WOODSTOCK, but wasn't--at least not by that writer.
In any case, we actually paid to be this indoors because 1) the free
showing was opposite THE ADVOCATE, and 2) rain was predicted for the
day of the free showing.  While the theater wasn't full, it still had
quite a respectable crowd for something that had just been shown for
free.</P>
<P>     On June 12, 1993, the largest stage ever erected in Finland was
set up in Senate Square (hey, we were just there!) for a joint concert
of the Leningrad Cowboys and the Alexandrov Red Army Chorus and Dance
Ensemble.  THE TOTAL BALALAIKA SHOW is the concert film made there by
noted Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki (who first introduced the
Leningrad Cowboys to the world in LENINGRAD COWOYS GO AMERICA).</P>
<P>     Songs included "Finlandia," "Together We Stand," "Volga Boatmen,"
"Happy Together," an absolutely wonderful rendition of "Delilah,"
"Knockin' on Heaven's Door," "Oh, Field," "Kalinka," "Gimme All Your
Lovin'" (with strains of the "Internationale" and the "Hallelujah
Chorus" added as background), "Sweet Home Alabama," "Dark Eyes," and
"Those Were the Days."</P>
<P>     I have to say that during "Happy Together" I found myself
comparing and contrasting this concert with "The Three Tenors."  It was
an even stronger feeling when the Russian soloist held the note in
"Kalinka" for what seemed like at least a minute.  I also got a real
feeling for the fact that the Cold War is over if the Red Army Chorus
is singing Western rock music, especially when they sang the lines from
Bob Dylan's "Knockin' on Heaven's Door": "Put my guns in the cold black
ground; I can't shoot them any more."</P>
<PRE>     One can only hope.</PRE>
<PRE>     Rating: +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>DADDY, COME TO THE FAIR, directed by Nitza Gonen, Israel, 1:16:</P>
<P>     One of the problems of reviewing a film about the Shoah
(Holocaust) is that the subject gives the film some element of
"untouchability"--it is very difficult to say anything negative about
it unless it is almost intentionally offensive.  But there are some
many mis-steps and misjudgments in the making of this made-for-
television documentary that I simply cannot recommend it.</P>
<P>     From the very beginning, or even before it in some sense, I think
there were problems.  This is a documentary of a man returning to
Poland, where his parents were murdered in the Holocaust.  With him
travel his son and his daughter, and the film (it's actually videotape,
but "film" has become generic) concentrates more on the son than on the
father.  It is true that during the trip, the relationship between the
son and the father undergoes a transformation, but how could they know
this would happen at the beginning of the shooting?  At time the camera
angles and other effects seem too studied, more suitable for a
narrative film than a documentary.  One almost gets the impression that
the entire project was the idea of the son, who just happens to be in
show business, and is more designed to promote his career than to focus
on his father.  Rating: 0 (-4 to +4).</P>
