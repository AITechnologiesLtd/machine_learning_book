<PRE>BOGUS
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     BOGUS (1996) is a fantasy about an invisible friend.  People who
exist only in one's imagination are common in childhood and in films.
Perhaps the best known of the latter is the movie HARVEY (1950), which
plays on the television in BOGUS lest we miss the connection of this
show to a greater one from the past.</P>
<P>     As the show opens, effusively happy Albert Franklin has a mother,
Lorraine (Nancy Travis), and plenty of visible friends.  Lorraine works
as a magician's assistant in a traveling act, which is now playing on
the Vegas strip.</P>
<P>     Albert is played by Haley Joel Osment in the strongest performance
in the movie.  Haley, whom you may recognize as Forrest Junior in
FORREST GUMP, is as assertive as he is cute.  His voice projects with
an authority that surpasses many adults.</P>
<P>     Shortly after the beginning of the story, Albert's mother is
killed in a car accident.  Director Norman Jewison cuts away quickly so
as to remove any chance of emotional impact.  Throughout this uneven
movie he will retain this proclivity to shy away from more than surface
depth.  The script by Francis X. McCarthy, Jeff Rothberg and Alvin
Sargent suffers from a similar problem.  The characters, Albert being
the exception, are outlined adequately, but they are only partially
filled in, leaving the viewer with a frustratingly incomplete feeling.</P>
<P>     By the provisions of the his mother's will, Albert is packed off
to Newark, New Jersey to live with his mother's foster sister Harriet
(Whoopi Goldberg), who did not know Albert existed.  (Albert's father
is explained away as a "fly-by-night," with his mother not even knowing
his last name.)  Since Albert is white and Harriet is black, this might
cause some challenges to be dealt with, but this script pays the issue
scant attention.</P>
<P>     Graffiti-encased Newark is cast against type.  Rather than its
usual collection of drug dealers and gangs, we see it as a friendly
working class town.  Nary a bad guy shows his head.  For those of us
who have lived in New Jersey, albeit not in Newark, it is refreshing to
see someone look upon its brighter side.</P>
<P>     As Albert travels on the plane to go to live with Harriet, a large
French stranger named Bogus (Gerard Depardieu) materializes out of a
drawing Albert has made.  Since Bogus can be seen and heard only by
Albert, we have the canonical set of scenes where Albert talks to Bogus
and a confused Harriet asks to whom Albert is speaking.</P>
<P>     Although the child actor gives an excellent performance, the
adults are merely adequate.  Depardieu plays his part whimsically, but
little more.  A more complex interpretation of his character would have
helped.  Similarly, Goldberg has the tough part right as the owner of a
small business, but her role as a reluctant mother is not believable.
She develops little genuine chemistry with anyone else in the picture.</P>
<P>     It is plausible that Harriet starts off tough.  ("This isn't going
to work.  I haven't had a conversation with a child since I was a
child.")  But when the inevitable emotional crack finally comes, it
happens too late and too unconvincingly.</P>
<P>     Notwithstanding these problems, the film does have its magical
moments and none more so than when Harriet and Bogus are transformed in
a daydream to a pair of dancers a la Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.
This scene was presaged earlier in another movie on the television.</P>
<P>     While always pleasant and sometime downright charming, Jewison's
film remains strangely uninvolving.  The ingredients are there but he
has trouble staging them into a compelling whole.</P>
<P>     BOGUS runs too long at 1:50.  It is rated PG for a little bad
language and its more serious themes.  It would be fine for kids around
6 and up.  My son Jeffrey, age 8, said he thought the film was "okay,
but it can get a little boring at times." His favorite part is when the
boy does magic tricks.  Since I never disliked the film and since there
are several touchingly funny portions, I am giving the film a mild
thumbs up and ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
