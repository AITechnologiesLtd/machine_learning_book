<PRE>THE ADVENTURES OF ELMO IN GROUCHLAND
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In Gary Halvorson's THE ADVENTURES OF ELMO IN GROUCHLAND, Elmo (voice of
Kevin Clash) has lost his prized possession, his blue blanket. It has
fallen into the trash can home of Oscar the Grouch (voice of Caroll
Spinney) and from thence to a place called Grouchland, U.S.A.</P>
<P>After the simple setup, Halvorson uses every excuse he can to get his
characters to break out into another song and dance number. With
hyperactive pacing, the Sesame Street regulars, along with some guests,
sing their hearts out. Indeed, the musical numbers are the film's best
part, even if none come close to being memorable.</P>
<P>Mitchell Kriegman's script is the movie's weakest link, giving the film
slightly less punch than a typical television episode from the series.
In our packed audience, filled with kids from toddlers on up, the laugh
quotient was remarkably modest. Typical of the picture's humor is the
location of the villain's home -- it's "high atop Mount Pick-a-Nose."</P>
<P>Kriegman throws the adults in the audience a few random funny lines.
("You have the right to scream your head off," Grouch Jailer (Spinney)
says to his prisoners in a muppet version of the Miranda rights. "If you
give up these rights, someone will be provided who screams their head
off for you.")</P>
<P>With its 3 to 5-year-old target audience, the movie stops the action,
literally, whenever anything threatening occurs. As the frame is frozen
behind them, Bert (voice of Frank Oz) and Ernie (voice of Steve
Whitmire) step out to reassure the audience that nothing bad will
happen. Bert and Ernie steal the show with these antics.</P>
<P>Also interactive, the movie requires audience participation, lest bad
things happen to its protagonist. Elmo, for example, needs us to come up
with 100 raspberries in less than 30 seconds to convince the Queen of
Trash (Vanessa L. Williams) that he isn't a cohort of the nefarious
Huxley (Mandy Patinkin). The movie keeps a dynamic count on the screen,
so you may want to practice in advance.</P>
<P>Even if the film isn't all it could be, some scenes are special. The
most magical is one filled with fireflies. Like a hundred Tinkerbells,
they come together to form an arrow to guide Elmo out of danger.</P>
<P>THE ADVENTURES OF ELMO IN GROUCHLAND runs 1:13. It is rated G and would
be fine for all ages.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 10, gave it **, liking mainly the music. His friend
Alan, age 10, gave it ***, finding the movie hilarious but the plot
weak. His friend Nickolas, age 10, gave it ** 1/2, liking the songs and
the excitement about what would happen next. Nickolas's sisters,
Danielle and Kaity Rose, ages 7 and 5 respectively, both gave the movie
**** with their favorite part being the queen's song.</P>
