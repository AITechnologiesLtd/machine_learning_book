<PRE>Scale: **** / ****</PRE>
<P>Ang Lee ventures into new territory in "The Ice Storm" - 70s America.
At least I thought it was new, until about two minutes in a character
makes a speech about what families are like ("personal negative
matter" apparently). That's OK by me though - Lee is the undisputed
master of this type of film-making, as he showed in "The Wedding
Banquet" and more recently "Sense and Sensibility".</P>
<P>Something is badly wrong in the well-heeled suburbia of New Canaan,
Connecticut. It isn't the interior decor, or the hideous shirts and
flared trousers - the malaise is deeper. Fortunately the director
realises that, and although there are a few jokes at the expense of
waterbeds he cuts straight to the deeply troubled relationships of the
inhabitants.</P>
<P>"The Ice Storm" is about two families: that of Joan Allen and Kevin
Kline, and Sigourney Weaver and Jamey Sheridan. It is a period study
of the era where the experiments of the late sixties had seeped into
the middle-aged middle-class consciousness, wreaking havoc on their
respectable lives, and changing the face of their society. Ben Hood
(Kline) is having an affair with neighbour Janey Carver (Weaver). His
daughter is experimenting with sex with her two sons. Elena, Ben's
wife, is uneasy, sensing his betrayal, and is meanwhile preyed on by
seedy clergyman Michael Cumpsty. Paul Hood (Tobey Maguire), the
insightful narrator has his sights set on a vacuous rich girl after
she spouts about existentialism.</P>
<P>The film is played out at dinner parties and "key" parties, and as the
story unfolds to its climax the ice storm of the title rages outside.
Ice is big in the movie, like the pressure on its characters to find
direction and meaning in the inhospitable climate of the day. Their
notions seem ridiculous, but Lee manages to retain our sympathy for
them, no matter how screwed up they are. They struggle with the
consequences of the upheaval, seeking emotional satisfaction: the
adolescent Paul seems to have the profoundest understanding, and that
comes from a Fantastic Four comic book. A lack of connection between
them has deadened their lives like the fury of the elements outside -
one scene shows Kline bored out of his skull in a board meeting, yet
he cannot communicate his frustration to either his wife or Janey, who
seeks only an "explicitly sexual relationship". Elena attempts to
block out the pressures and turns towards the artefacts of the
seventies like cultish religion and group marriage therapy. Even she
succumbs to quite possibly the most unerotic extra-marital love scene
ever filmed.</P>
<P>All the while the children are on a journey of discovery themselves:
Wendy, the independent daughter of the Hood family (played
marvellously by Christina Ricci) threatens the remaining order by
exposing herself to Sandy (Sigourney Weaver's reprimand speech about
coming of age rituals in "Samoa and other developing nations" is
particularly acute). In another scene she and Mikey fumble as she
wears a rubber Nixon mask - a disturbing image. The seventies are
evoked through this listless search for something and the bizarre
solutions that were offered. With their partner swapping and gullible
self-help philosophies, their need for emotional support, the adults
attempt to play the children, whilst the younger generation attempt to
find their way in the adult world.</P>
<P>The forces at play on these people are like the ice: ice so powerful
that it can bend iron lamps and fell trees: such an immense force that
it will crush anything it forms on: there is a sense that something
terrible will happen throughout - images like Mikey jumping up and
down on a frozen diving board, or Sandy playing with explosives. The
tragedy of these battered relationships is clear right from the
beginning: the families are splintered by straining marriages and
generation difference, but ultimately tragedy brings them together,
the ice storm uses up its energy and calm is restored: and in the bare
new light emerges understanding.</P>
