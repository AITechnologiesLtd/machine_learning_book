<P>>From the man who presented us with HENRY: THE PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL
KILLER (6.5/10) comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash
of Florida's South Coast.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Guidance Counselor (Dillon) is accused of raping one of his students.
She happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in
Florida. The counselor is brought to court on the charges, as another
white trash girl (Campbell), also joins the rape finger-pointing club.
As the story unfolds, we find that many things aren't exactly as they
seem (that's as much as I could say without ruining anything).</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Good little flick that slows down at certain points, and runs a tad
long, but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people
interested throughout. Mind you, I could see many people not liking it
because it takes "one too many" twists and turns, but hey, I happen to
like that kind of thing. And besides, the twists and turns in this
movie managed to remain within the realm of believability (or
scathingly close to), and even "explained" many of its turns with a
showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the
film (DO NOT leave the theatre before you see the credits...it really
does clear up some stuff !!).</P>
<P>Other than that, the acting was good, with Campbell transforming her
"good girl stereotypical" role into a pot-smoking, goth-looking white
trash chick out for a good time. Denise Richards (from STARSHIP
TROOPERS (7/10) fame) solidifies herself as Hollywood's jelly-donut
pinup girl of the moment, and proves that all breast implants needn't
lead to lawsuits. Bacon is solid, and so is Dillon (while continuing to
prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world !!).
Sprinkle the story with a bunch o' shots of alligators peeking through
the swamp waters, Bacon showing the world the size of his ding-dong (do
we really need to see this??), a couple of lesbian kissing scenes, and
a menage-a-trois, and you've got yourself a decent time at the movie
theatre.</P>
<P>On the down side, the soundtrack was not as prominent (or slick) as I
thought it would be, and Theresa Russell (real name: Theresa Paup)
seems to have lost her way in every which way possible....ooooh, I
almost forgot Bill Murray's exquisite role as the down-trodden lawyer
who agrees to defend Dillon in court. Murray actually added that extra
little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as
a quirky little noirish tale of sex, greed and mystery. </P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Neve Campbell specified a non-nudity clause in her contract (she's also
born in Guelph, Ontario...go hoser!)
Director John McNaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown
Matt Dillon and Kevin Bacon showering together, as it was gratuitous.
Kevin Bacon plays in a band with his brother, called The Bacon
Brothers, is married to actress Kyra Sedgwick, and has a game based on
him called "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon".</P>
