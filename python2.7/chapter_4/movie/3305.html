<PRE>                                 JUST CAUSE
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1995 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     A young girl is murdered in the Florida Everglades and the police
force the confession of the man they think who did it.  Eight years
later, Harvard professor Paul Armstrong (Sean Connery) must find the
truth behind the killing and set an innocent man free.</P>
<P>     With its weak script by Jeb Stuart and Peter Stone and Arne
Glimcher's uninspired direction, JUST CAUSE just barely manages to be
entertaining and it is due solely to the strength of its cast.  Dealt a
bland character, Connery is only able to peak our interest in Armstrong
because of his potent star-persona.  Laurence Fishburne also does his
best portraying the unorthodox cop, Tanny Brown, but poor writing
undermines him.  Ed Harris has the film's plumb role as the psychotic
Blair Sullivan, a poor man's Hannibal Lecter but in this film, we'll
take what we can get.  Blair Underwood is positively boring as the
innocent man accused and Kate Capshaw is downright bad as Armstrong's
wife.</P>
<P>     With the help of its Florida location and some alligators,  JUST
CAUSE has a few thrills sprinkled throughout its one hour forty-two
minute running time but it is hardly enough to make up the slow pace
and gaping plot-holes.  This one is a rental.</P>
