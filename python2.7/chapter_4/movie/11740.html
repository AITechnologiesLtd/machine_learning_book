<P>Wide Awake (PG) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
        The occasionally affecting Wide Awake is a strange paradox of a film.
Although it is clearly targeted at children, this sometimes humorous but
often somber meditation on death and religion will mystify most young
moviegoers.  On the same token, its rather facile treatment of its serious
themes will leave older audiences less than satisfied.
        The existence of God becomes a major concern for the film's protagonist,
10-year-old Catholic school student Joshua Beal (newcomer Joseph Cross, in
a promising debut) after his beloved grandfather (Robert Loggia) dies of
bone marrow cancer.  Joshua cannot comprehend why he had to pass on, and
his fifth grade school year turns into a nine-month long search (told in
three phases: "The Questions," "The Signs," and "The Answers") for an
explanation from a higher power--that is, if one indeed exists.  For a
kid-aimed film, this is pretty heavy, heady subject matter, perhaps a
little too much so to engage the young 'uns.  But writer-director M. Night
Shyamalan does not address these lofty issues satisfactorily enough for
adults, offering simple answers and easy miracles.  I suppose a compromise
of sorts was necessary to reach audiences at the opposite ends of the age
spectrum, but in hitting middle ground he reaches no one.
        More accessible to the tots are the subplots that hover around Joshua's
quest, such as his dealings with his carefree best friend Dave (Timothy
Reifsnyder), a school bully, and a portly schoolmate who desperately wants
a friend.  While some humorous amusement is to be had from these lighter
threads, they degenerate into the manipulative, melodramatic hokum of those
sappy "very special episodes" of sitcoms or, in the case of David,
disease-themed afterschool specials.  Granted, a few isolated moments
involving these stories and the main plot achieve some level of poignance,
but that is more due to the heartfelt, earnest performances of the cast
(which also includes Rosie O'Donnell, Denis Leary, and Dana Delany) than
Shyamalan's writing or directing.
        Towards the end, the newly enlightened Joshua lends the film its title
when he declares himself "wide awake."  Audiences of all ages will have
some difficulty saying the same for themselves.  To borrow the metaphor,
they will indeed be awake (OK, the really little ones may not
be--literally), but likely in that alert-but-still-drowsy state when one
first gets up in the morning.</P>

 for so long, but then you don't know how to react when you
 get it.  I still don't know how to react."
