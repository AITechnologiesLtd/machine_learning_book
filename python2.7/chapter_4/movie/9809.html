                          FIRE DOWN BELOW 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                  2 :-( :-(  for a vague whiff of smoke</PRE>
<P>Cast: Steven Seagal, Marg Helgenberger, Harry Dean Stanton, Kris
Kristofferson, Stephen Lang, Levon Helm, Brad Hunt Director: Felix
Enriquez Alcala Screenplay: Jeb Stuart and Philip Morton</P>
<P>There is something pristine about Segal and his action heroes who remain
virtually invincible in harms way. He will occasionally be cut or
stabbed, but you'll never see too much blood on that well chiselled face
and solid torso. For some reason blood, dirt, sweat and bruises don't
hang well on Segal. Punishing injury is for the die hard Willis,
physical damage follows the kick boxing Van Damme, and multiple gun shot
wounds riddle after the robotic Swharzenegger. As for Segal it's not his
style to let the enemy throw too many close punches, let alone get his
expensive clothes dirty. For that reason, I like Segal because he has
redefined the meaning of a clean fight.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, there isn't anything unique about "Fire Down Below" that
hasn't already traversed down the road of previous Segal action
thrillers. He's a special agent once again, with a slick appearance and
familiar pony tail; well dressed and diet controlled since his last
siting with pot belly in the embarrassing "The Glimmer Man". Once again
the hero he creates is perfectly balanced, poetically just and an
effortless killer who defeats up to twenty men with guns in any given
situation. I have no qualms with this particular style of polished
action and safety margin thrills. The real let down for me was how very
ordinary this movie turned out.</P>
<P>I do not carry a keen love of pure special effects in movies, but in an
action flick, especially in a Segal action flick I would like to see
more than a couple of bins explode and objects burn. I would also like
to see Segal wearing something outside his usual dark overcoat and
leather jackets; especially in a small country town where he is supposed
to blend with the natives in order to carry out an investigation. Come
on Steven, how about some jeans, a pleat shirt and a cowboy hat? Too
risque or just trying to hide weight? You need to dress the part if you
want us to believe you have some carpentry skills. Just swinging the
hammer in clothing suitable for a "Planet Hollywood" presentation
doesn't quite cut the cheese.</P>
<P>On the unusual side of things, Segal has decided to include a love
interest for his hero notably absent in his most recent movies. He has
strangely chosen a frail, weedy looking creature (Marg Helgenberger) to
be the main contender. There is no question that Segal remains the
perfect gentleman in his movies and women naturally fall for that sort
of a thing. But it becomes hard to swallow when he comes across as a
Russian Mafia thug, whilst his love interest is mostly clothed in rags
and lives like a hermit. The only thing they have in common is her porch
needs fixing, he likes her cooking and they both collect honey. Maybe
that's enough for some relationships to work, but there certainly isn't
any chemistry under the stove.</P>
<P>So overall I was disappointed by this latest of Segal offerings. I guess
in my heart, I still carry that simple wish that he'll get back into
whites and rescue another battle cruiser from the claws of terrorists.
Somehow rescuing country bumpkins from the jaws of polluting
industrialists doesn't carry the same missed heartbeat of thrill and
ride.</P>
