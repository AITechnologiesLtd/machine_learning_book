<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"Gun Shy" puts in a lot of effort to be zanier than the other mobster
comedy films it takes the same theme as, except here it is a lawman
instead of a hood who is suffering from anxiety attacks and is in need
of seeing a shrink. Sometimes it succeeds in being mildly funny, like
when the legendary DEA undercover agent Charlie Mayo (Liam Neeson) finds
romance with a gastroenterologist's nurse, Judy Tipp (Sandra Bullock),
while she is giving him a barium enema. He has a chronic stomach
problem, which is used as a running gag throughout. It was also amusing
to see him in need of a psychiatrist (Mantell), who assures him "You
need to share more than anyone I've ever known." Liam talks his head off
to the shrink, but really gets help when he joins a men's group therapy
session and bonds with them as they talk about how they hate their jobs,
whereby he opens up to them how he lost his nerve for the job. Liam is
having second thoughts about his career in the DEA, as he is consumed
with fear that he will be killed in his latest undercover assignment. He
feels vulnerable after the last operation nearly got him killed. What
Liam wants now is a place with an ocean view and early retirement after
18 years on the job.</P>
<P>On this current dangerous assignment, Liam helps in putting through a
deal between the Colombian drug cartel's queer son Fidel Vaillar (Jose
Zuniga) and the Mafia don's psychotic son-in-law, Fulvio (Oliver Platt).
Fidel wants to money-launder the cartel's drug money and needs Fulvio's
help. Fulvio has hired a yuppie Wall Street investor Jason Cane (Andy
Lauer) to do the money-laundering and work a stock-fraud scheme. Liam as
the undercover agent is caught in the middle, as he is the calm one who
tries to keep each side from killing each other. His m.o. is that things
are constantly going wrong for him, but they always turn out OK.</P>
<P>Everything is played for laughs; Fidel and Fulvio are cartoon figures,
with the only difference being Oliver Platt is funny and Jose Zuniga is
seen as either being psychotic or preening, but he's not funny. He is
seen most of the time pouting over his bodyguard (DeLorenzo), who is his
lover.</P>
<P>This is TV writer Eric Blakeney's debut feature as director-writer, and
he gets mixed reviews. The comedy was mild, the script was choppy, and
the story had an inane charm to it, but no more. The usually bland Liam
Neeson had more of a flare for this type of farce than I thought he
would have and Platt, in his inimical style, got off a few good
one-liners, such as "Fun is overrated." Sandra Bullock, whose acting
career is spinning ever-downward, had a small role that only required
she look good in that oversized shirt she likes to always wear. Her role
put no other demands on her. She produced the film. Platt's sarcastic
wife (Mary McCormack) had a few zippy retorts, which she delivered in a
heavy New York City accent, as she made her presence felt in her very
small role.</P>
<P>Overall, the comedy was too slight, as was everything else about this
film, to make it more than passable entertainment. Its nearest relative
in ganster comedy films is "Analyze This"(Gun Shy was made before that
film), but this film didn't have De Niro as its star, which made this
film seem not as good, though it was on the same level.</P>
<P>But, if you ask me to state confidentially, the worst thing one can say
about this film, I would say that it suffered from too much flatulence.</P>
