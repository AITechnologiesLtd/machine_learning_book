<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>Up front, I will humbly admit that I laughed with frequent intensity
throughout most of There's Something About Mary.  Unfortunately (perhaps
only for myself), that is not enough to make me like a movie.  This
particular picture, written and directed by Peter and Bob Farrelly, is a
pointless and insipid romantic comedy at the core, and is set apart from
the crowd of insipid romantic comedies only because of its ridiculously
cheap humor.  It has no story, weak characters, and, like all romantic
comedies, it expects us to care. </P>
<P>See, I don't mind laughter.  I engage in it every once in a while, but
I like to feel something when a film is over.  I felt so indifferent, so
unmoved at the end of There's Something About Mary, that I can't give it
a positive review.  I laughed equally hard during The Opposite of Sex,
but that film is smart and subtle, in addition to being funny.  The
Farrellys -- whose credits include the boring Dumb and Dumber and the
unwatchable Kingpin -- have a talent for making us laugh at disgusting
and painful images.  But it's just not that interesting, and not the
least bit satisfying.</P>
<P>Ben Stiller, although he is third-billed, is the main character, Ted. 
The film opens thirteen years in the past, when Ted is in high school. 
Inexplicably, he gets invited to the prom by the luminous Mary (Cameron
Diaz); when he goes to pick her up on prom night, a few awful things
happen -- Mary's mentally handicapped brother (W. Earl Brown) attacks
him, he gets in a fight with Mary's stepfather (Keith David), and he
gets his genitals stuck in his zipper.</P>
<P>Flash ahead thirteen years; Ted's still thinking about Mary, so he has
private investigator Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) find her in Miami. 
Naturally, Healy falls for Mary, and Ted is left in the dust.  The film
progresses from there, as Ted discovers numerous individuals who have
all been hopelessly swept away by Mary, and who are all now stalking her
and attempting valiantly to win her affections.  </P>
<P>All right, so if you're less critical than I, and you simply want to
laugh, then don't let these words stop you.  I'd be doing a horrible
disservice to the Farrellys if I didn't remind myself continually that
There's Something About Mary is a uniquely funny film -- the laughs are
more-or-less constant (aside from a few unbearable lulls), and you're
likely to find yourself guffawing so loudly that you won't be able to
hear the people around you doing the same thing.  Typically, it's good
form to give examples of points made in a review, but much of the humor
here is intended to be shocking, and, therefore, I shouldn't tell you
about it.</P>
<P>I can, however, mention all of the groaners, from the "touching" scenes
all the way up to the point at which the Farrellys make it clear that,
dear God, there's a story buried somewhere in this mess.  Movies like
this shouldn't even bother with stories and characters; it's a pointless
endeavor, condescending and cloying.  You wouldn't even have to see the
preview to predict the outcome of this film -- all you'd need is a
five-word synopsis of the story, and then you'd know.  I realize
consciously that no one was trying to surprise me with the turn of
events in this film, but, for once, I'd like to see a film like this
that actually manages to capture my interest without the use of
fishhooks or semen.</P>
<P>In the acting arena, Ben Stiller is amusing, but not given the kind of
sarcastic and cynical material that makes him funniest.  But he makes a
good hero, and I like that he's constantly unaware of everything.  Matt
Dillon, however, shows superb comic timing -- watch closely the scene in
which he's first telling Mary about his job, helping mentally deficient
people.  Diaz, in all of her shining beauty, still manages to express a
hint of intelligence and warmth, and is therefore a pleasure to watch. 
Lee Evans and Chris Elliott are both fun in unpredictable supporting
roles.</P>
<P>Now that they're on their third movie, I'm reasonably certain that the
Farrellys don't know the first thing about cohesive storytelling or
narration.  As directors, they're not terrible, but they don't strike me
as gifted.  As writers, they should stick to the jokes and sight-gags,
because the "serious" material here is enough to keep my eyes
permanently facing the back of my head.  So, shall I leave you admitting
that There's Something About Mary is pretty darn funny, or should I
emphasize that it lacks even the most pathetic attempts at depth and
intelligence?  Well, perhaps I'll do a little of both:  There's
Something About Mary is the funniest unsatisfying film of the year.</P>
