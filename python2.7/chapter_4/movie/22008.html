<PRE>RIDE WITH THE DEVIL
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Patience.  In this Jerry Bruckheimer era of rock 'em, sock 'em
filmmaking, audiences have little patience.  Worse, when they do, the
films frequently don't deliver the rewards promised by their slow
approach, frustrating audiences and making them more likely to go for
quick gratification the next time.  There's nothing like watching Bruce
Willis save the world, or some large part of it, to pump up your
adrenaline.</P>
<P>In a complete opposite to the in-your-face action style of filmmaking,
Ang Lee's career has been devoted to the human dimension.  From his
comedic EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN to his intimate SENSE AND SENSIBILITY to his
biting THE ICE STORM, his pictures have cut through the gloss to deliver
fascinating, realistic character studies.</P>
<P>Lee's latest, RIDE WITH THE DEVIL, tells a rarely told story of the
American Civil War.  Set on the Kansas/Missouri border, it follows a
group of Southern militia, called the Bushwhackers, as they fight
skirmishes with the locals, the Union army and their Northern
counterparts, the Jayhawkers.  Soldiers in the regular army fought
gloriously and died, whereas the Bushwhackers just fought and died.  The
complex reasons why they chose this unusual path are explored and
explained convincingly in James Schamus's script, which is based on a
Daniel Woodrell novel ("Woe to Live On").</P>
<P>Those going expecting a traditional war picture will be sorely
disappointed.  If that's the film you want, then Lee is not the director
to make it.  RIDE WITH THE DEVIL moves with its own methodical rhythms
and with most of its story told in quiet moments of anguish as the
Bushwhackers hide between fights.  Battle scenes there are, but they are
few and far between and rarely take center stage.</P>
<P>The story is one of men, young and old, but mainly older teenagers,
trying to wage a war of retribution against the better equipped
Northerners.  Lee sets this in a wonderfully pastoral setting, full of
chirping crickets, clucking hens and mooing cows.  The fighters aren't
glamorous or heroic; they're just persistent and, for all their bravado,
obviously frightened.</P>
<P>In the large ensemble cast, Tobey Maguire (THE ICE STORM), as the
innocent and naive Jake Roedel, has perhaps the most important role.  He
isn't the leader, but the story revolves around him and his friends.
With the arrival of a bleak winter the Bushwhackers disband into
foursomes that go off to hide in the woods.  Along with Jake the first
winter are Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich), George Clyde (Simon
Baker-Denny) and Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright), an ex-slave whose freedom
George purchased.</P>
<P>Adopted by a local Southern family, the men take a liking to the
family's recently widowed daughter-in-law, Sue Lee Shelley (Jewel).  "He
was a good husband to me," Sue Lee rather matter-of-factly tells the
four of her deceased husband.  "The three weeks he was a good husband.
He didn't last."  It was a time when not much of anything lasted.  Every
visitor brought news of more dead friends, neighbors and relatives.</P>
<P>One of the touching scenes has the men reading stolen mail to Union
soldiers.  The letters are full of resignation to the fact that the
recipient or the sender or both may be dead before the letter is
delivered.</P>
<P>It was a cold and lonely calling, but the Bushwhackers coped somehow.
The beauty of Lee's picture is that he relates their story with
compassion but without schmaltz.  Enlightening, fascinating and tender,
it is the movie for those who want to get behind the lines and the
action and get to know the individuals drawn into such a hellacious
situation.</P>
<P>RIDE WITH THE DEVIL runs a little too long at 2:18.  It is rated R for
some graphic war violence and would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
