<P>Salo, or The 120 Days of Sodom (1975) 115m.</P>
<P>I've yet to read more than two pages of the infamous Marquis de Sade volume 
on which this film was based, but that's still enough to establish the 
cataloguing of carnality and scatology that appears to be the books raison 
d'etre.  After working his way ever more deeply into controversial subject 
matter such as sex, religion, and politics, director Pier Paolo Pasolini 
finally decided to go the whole hog and make a film from a text which 
single-handedly defined the term 'unfilmable'.  He would be bludgeoned to 
death near a soccer field shortly after filming was completed, making this 
his final opus - but after SALO he would have been hard pressed to come up 
with material for an encore.</P>
<P>SALO starts with gorgeous, summery photography of rural Italy but quickly 
moves indoors and stays there for the duration of the story.  This is Italy 
under fascism in the 1940s, and the mansion that is the central set of the 
film plays host to a number of appalling aberrations beneath its sunny 
skies.  In Pasolini's restructuring of the original text, a group of 
wealthy, corrupt fascists have rounded up young Italians and imprisoned them 
within a large country estate in order to play out the De Sade book as if it 
were a type of instruction manual (Pasolini actually kept his cast inside 
the mansion for nearly two months of shooting).  Whether or not they hope to 
learn something more about their own baser nature isn't even a subject for 
consideration as they humiliate and torture their hapless prisoners 
relentlessly.  SALO is, by its subject, a confrontational film, and was 
banned outright in different countries.  I think the charges brought against 
it are less a result of what is shown on screen than the sense that it 
appears so studiously committed to its own moral vacuum.  You'll see more 
graphic sex and violence in other films but these are usually punctuations 
within a wider context - in SALO these elements are present constantly.  Not 
for one moment are we offered any relief from the emotional and 
psychological torment being inflicted upon the fascist's victims, and just 
when we think the film is all bark and no bite, it offers a final scene that 
is horrific not only for what it portrays but because it can be the only 
logical conclusion.</P>
<P>I believe that SALO is not as controversial for its content as it is for the 
conditions it imposes upon the viewer from the outset: that there is no 
hope, that there will be no rescue, that these young people will suffer and 
that we will be witness to every moment of it.  Because we accept these 
conditions and view on regardless we get the feeling that we are conspiring 
with an agenda of the film-maker's.  Is it a film that exists more in the 
reaction to its content than the content itself?  Is the event of the film 
emulating the anarchic argument behind De Sade's own scandalous writings?  
What's problematic with SALO is that by means of blasphemy, cruelty or 
depravity it positions itself as a dialogue with which the audience cannot 
help but engage, overwhelming conventional attitudes of storyline or 
character.  I also can't help feeling that Pasolini's decision to update the 
text to a wartime setting is pure strategy on his part, as if allegory 
conveniently excuses his indulgence.  It's not a film that should be banned 
(there were lines around the block when I went to see it), or that people 
should be discouraged from seeing, or that most people should be encouraged 
to see, for that matter.  Ultimately, despite its controversy, I'm left with 
a muddled reaction to SALO.  It's certainly disturbing, but probably for the 
wrong reasons.  Just as De Sade's book tells you more about the man who 
wrote it than the work itself, so too do I think less of SALO as a film than 
the end-product of the man who made it.</P>
