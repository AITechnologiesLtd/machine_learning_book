<PRE>                          THE WINTER GUEST 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
          5 unhappy :-( :-( :-( :-( :-(  for a cranky old lady</PRE>
<P>Cast: Phylida Law, Emma Thompson, Gary Hollywood, Arlene Cockburn,
SheilaReid, Sandra Voe, Douglas Murphy, Sean Biggerstaff
Director: Alan Rickman
Screenplay: Sharman Macdonald and Alan Rickman</P>
<P>I cannot adequately express how disappointed I feel after watching THE
WINTER GUEST. I had expected great things from Alan Rickman in this his
debut as a director. Let's face it, he's a better actor. Secondly,
whatever persuaded Emma Thompson, an Academy Award Winner for best
screen adaptation, to except a very poor adaptation of stage play to
screen play carrying the same name???</P>
<P>Yes I hated, I greatly detested, THE WINTER GUEST from the instant that
Phyllida Law opened her mouth. Perhaps, her character is meant to be
that of a nagging old bit'hmm, but to the extent that it cat whips the
viewer's nerves raw? Several people walked out early when they saw where
this movie was heading. I should have done the same and got my money
back, but unfortunately I don't do it on principle. One kept expecting
the old crone to drop dead, with the fake Parkisonian tremor an all, but
no she has to live right to the end and say ‘My name is Elspeth', like
it's something profound and the audience is meant to understand what she
means by it. I couldn't, so I put it down to early onset dementia. She
could have done the audience a favour and walked out onto the frozen sea
and never returned.</P>
<P>Other annoying factors is how stagey the entire movie feels, even though
most of the sets are outdoors. There is also a problem with the script
sounding artificial, ‘Shakespearan' without the heart of the great poet.
The actors speak, but most of the time what they rant about is
inconsequential, empty and even baffling. There's almost never more than
two people in a scene, it's like no one lives in this town except for
eight people split into pairs. Other problems concern two boys who find
condoms and kittens on the beach, before deciding to rub deep heat on
their dicks. Every second word spoken is a swear word, and they're only
ten! You may expect it from PULP FICTION, but not from kids! Then there
are two young people experimenting with their bodies, wanting to have
sex but don't because there's a feeling the dead boy's father is in the
room. Before we meet two old ladies, one screaming ‘I'm going to fall,
I'm going to fall.' No doubt she is having a panic attack, but hey she's
on a bus there is no where to fall! Finally, Phyllida Law and Emma
Thompson, mother and daughter, I just hope there relationship in real
life is not as awful as it is on screen. There is enough nagging in this
movie to make one grow old in their seat.</P>
<P>This was an awful script and an awful movie with little resolution of
the presenting problems, leaving the viewer (myself) very angry and
dissatisfied.</P>
