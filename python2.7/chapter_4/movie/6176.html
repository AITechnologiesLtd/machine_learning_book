<PRE>                 Screamers (1995)</PRE>
<PRE>           A film review by Joshua McAdams</PRE>

<P>When adapting a science fiction story to the big screen three
pre-requisites are required: unique alien sets, interesting
characters, and a "hook" that sucks the audience in.  "Screamers",
based on a short work by Phillip K. Dick, appears to have been
assembled piecemeal by the interns at "Deep Space Nine". This film
look so much like low-budget TV sci-fi that I was expecting Patrick
Stewart to make a cameo. "Picard to Enterprise. There's no intelligent
plot here. One to beam up."</P>
<P>Director Chris Duguay, the mastermind behind "Scanners II" and
"Scanners III", made his first mistake when he signed on to this
project.  I mean listen to the plot: It's 2078 on the distant planet
of Sirus 6B where two armies, the NEB (New Economic Block) and "The
Alliance", battle for control of the vital Byrinium mines. The
Alliance commander Hendrickson (Peter Weller) runs a depleted outpost
that is protected by the real stars of this celluloid disaster:
mechanical moles armed with spinning saw blades called "screamers."</P>
<P>When the NEB command sues for peace, Hendrickson and a space marine
make the journey across Sirus 6B's scourched surface to the enemy
fortress. Along the way they discover that the "screamers" have become
self-aware and are independently upgrading themselves into more
effective killers. At the NEB base, Hendrickson teams up with a buxom
black marketeer (Jennifer Rubin) and a couple of soldiers in order to
combat these dreaded subterranean menaces.</P>
<P>Duguay's second mistake is taking this script seriously.  His  attempt
to inject suspense into this farce  reveals just how weak the story
actual is. To cover up this lack of content, he offers us mindless
philosophy, generic romance, and cheesy  point-of-view shots of
"screamers" tearing along the ground at their hapless victims. Duguay
lops a few plot twists at the audience but these are so blatantly
telegraphed he'd have better luck sending them Western Union.</P>
<P>While the premise - technology, if given the chance, will attempt to
destroy it's creator - is a good one, it is demonstrated far better in
the "Terminator" films. Even die hard trekkies would feel insulted by
this offering so it goes to reason that  Joe Movie Goer should be
doubly reluctant to plunk down a hard earned seven dollars for this
drivel.  You'd be better off renting a truely suspenseful sci-fi flick
like "Alien" or "Predator" and steering clear of "Screamers" - it's
nothing to shout about.</P>
