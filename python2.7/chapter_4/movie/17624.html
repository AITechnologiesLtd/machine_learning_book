<P>"On October 21, 1994, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael 
Williams hiked into the Black Hills Forest to shoot a documentary film 
on a local legend called 'The Blair Witch,' and were never seen again. 
One year later, their footage was found."</P>
<P>This is the title card that appears at the start of "The Blair Witch 
Project," a film made on a microscopic budget by first-time 
writer-directors Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick that probably caused 
more of a stir with audiences than any other motion picture that was 
showcased at this year's Sundance Film Festival.</P>
<P>What follows is that footage that was ultimately found in the forest, 
meticulously edited together from the 16mm and video formats they used 
to shoot it on. Set up as a sort of pseudo-documentary, "The Blair Witch 
Project" begins with the three aforementioned Montgomery College 
students preparing for their trip to Burkittsville, Maryland, home of 
the legendary Blair Witch who, as the people they interview in the town 
tell it, lives within the Black Hills Forest and murdered a string of 
children in the 1940's. Playfully shrugging off such horrific stories, 
the headstrong Heather, constantly with a Hi-8 video camera in her hand 
and using a map and compass, leads Joshua (who is filming with a grainy 
black-and-white 16mm camera) and Michael (who is there to pick up the 
sound) deep into the woods for what is supposed to be a simple 2-day 
excursion. It doesn't turn out that way, however, as they ultimately 
never make it back to their car on the second day and are forced to set 
up camp another night. Faint footsteps are heard, and the next day, they 
discover voodoo dolls and eerie symbols hanging over the trees. As the 
days pass by, their food begins to dwindle, the pitch black, freezing 
nights grow more and more intense and threatening as increasingly loud 
cackling noises and screams are heard, and they become hopelessly lost 
within the mouth of the forest, the three students are forced to come to 
terms with themselves and reconstruct their vision of what raw, 
unadulterated horror really is.</P>
<P>When was the last time you've been scared by a movie? No, strike that. 
When was the last time you have been so completely and utterly horrified
 by a motion picture that, when the end credits began to roll, you were 
left curled up in your chair, literally shaking, and filled with so many 
strong emotions that you weren't quite sure how to decipher it all? If 
your answer was never (which it most likely was), look no further than 
"The Blair Witch Project," which is a horror film like no other. It is 
not another manufactured and slick "Scream"-style flick, but a true 
horror movie, one drenched in such a thick, smothering veil of 
hopelessness and dread, not to mention utter realism, that it finally 
stops becoming merely a "movie" and is transformed into something that 
means more, as if you are watching a true-to-life documentation of the 
terror three students fell face-to-face upon on that fateful, chilly 
October week before they disappeared without a trace.</P>
<P>Also, unlike any other film I have ever seen, "The Blair Witch Project" 
is constantly shown from the point-of-view of one of the characters, 
since the movie is made up of the footage they filmed. This cinema 
verite style of filmmaking adds to the constant feeling that what you 
are watching is not fiction, but genuinely authentic, as it puts the 
viewer smack dab in the middle of the absolute nightmare. Jittery, 
shaky, and hand-held, the camera ultimately takes on a life all its own, 
used as a sort of metaphor for the off-kilter frame-of-mind the 
characters are forced to obtain as their spirits diminish and they start 
to question whether they will survive their dire, to say the least, 
ordeal.</P>
<P>To put it bluntly, there is no acting in "The Blair Witch Project." 
There is, since Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard 
are playing characters (despite have the same names), but what I mean is 
that there isn't a minute, a second, or even a frame where you can ever 
catch the actors "acting." Their entirely believable performances which, 
for the most part, were improvised for the eight days they spent in the 
woods, are mindblowing, to say the least. As the character of Heather 
starts off as a confidant young woman, and the leader of the group, she 
gradually finds that this feeling of always being right is only a facade 
to hide her own weaknesses and fears for the future. As Heather, as well 
as Michael and Joshua, slowly break down, becoming vulnerable and beyond 
frightened, they have nothing to do but pray that they will make their 
way out of the seemingly endless wilderness before whatever really is 
out there gets them. In a late scene, filled more power and truthfulness 
than I can remember in any other film I've ever seen, Heather, centering 
the camera directly on her right eye and nose, pours all of her emotions 
out, confessing to the faults of her own life, apologizing to her 
family, her comrades' families, her friends, and finally, making peace 
with herself. </P>
<P>To see "The Blair Witch Project" is not to simply watch it, but to 
experience it. No film in recent memory has shocked me, petrified me, 
unsettled my spirits, and left me so enthusiastic afterwards, making me 
want to discuss and share the picture with others. After rustling 
through so many recent turkeys, "The Blair Witch Project" has reminded 
me why I love the sacred medium of film, and why I want to dedicate my 
life to it. Writer-directors Sanchez and Myrick have thrust upon the 
world a motion picture with more promise, originality, and excitement 
than I can remember, and as a horror film, without any actually physical 
gore or even violence, it is more unsettling, atmospheric, devastating, 
and unforgettable than I ever, in my wildest imagination, expected a 
film could possibly be.</P>
