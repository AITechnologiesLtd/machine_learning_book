<PRE>THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1998 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1998) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I thought DUMB AND DUMBER was tasteless. I thought KINGPIN 
was even more tasteless. Little did I know the Farrely Brothers' most 
conventional comedy, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, would have the 
least taste of all. This is a movie where a woman uses semen as hair 
gel, a dog receives electroshock therapy and mouth-to-mouth 
resuscitation (first DR. DOLITTLE, now this -- is 1998 the summer of 
performing mouth-to-mouth on animals for laughs?), and a man traps 
his genitals in his zipper.</P>
<P>        Cameron Diaz, previously one of the more distinguished 
young actresses, presides over the gutteral humor with grace, poise 
and a lot more comedic sense than I would have pegged her for. As the 
title character, she's the object of Ben Stiller's affection. Simian Stiller, 
who has disgraced such movies as THE CABLE GUY and IF LUCY FELL, 
finally picks a good comedy again. It's been two years since FLIRTING 
WITH DISASTER, but Stiller still remembers how to play the horny 
loser role.</P>
<P>        The movie begins in 1985, exploiting the '80s as so many of 
today's comedies manage to do. There's even a Rubik's Cube, for God's 
sake, and the ultimate reminder of the '80s -- Markie Post from "Night 
Court." She plays Diaz's mother, while Some Random Black Guy 
plays the stepfather. (Yes, an afro is mined for laughs.) Less politically 
correct is Diaz's brother, a retarded kid who asks everyone where his 
baseball is and gets picked on. When Stiller stands up for her brother, 
Diaz asks him to the prom and he shows up in a bad tuxedo, all ready 
to go until the Zipper Incident occurs in the bathroom.</P>
<P>        Flashforward to the present, Stiller's bleeding genitalia 
having ruined any chance of happiness with Mary. As a thirtyish loser 
(you know he's a loser because his best friend is Chris Elliot), he 
suddenly decides to look up his old would-be flame, and hires a sleazy 
detective friend of Elliot's to find her. Matt Dillon, looking nothing 
like himself, plays the detective, who gets one look at Diaz in a bra 
and decides he's in love with her.</P>
<P>        It's a fun sitcom plot, the loser guy who pretends to be 
someone else to win the hand of the beautiful woman. This version is 
pretty close to Woody Allen in EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU -- Dillon has 
access to inside information about Mary and pretends to be everything 
she wants in a man. She falls for it about the same time Stiller decides 
he has to come to Florida. What ensues is a nonstop saga of disgusting 
humor, a lot of it incredibly funny.</P>
<P>        What THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY boils down to is the first 
romantic comedy about a stalker. Stiller is the least of the evils, in a 
movie where the suitors include the private detective who listens in on 
her conversations, the pizza boy pretending to be an English man in 
arm braces and a shoe fetishist. Surprisingly, for a movie this daring 
in plot and gags, the ending is about as conventional and predictable 
as one could expect. It's a good movie, but when will we see a movie 
this bold that actually functions as satire right to the end?</P>
