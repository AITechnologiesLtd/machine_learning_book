Susan Granger's review of "THE MIGHTY" (Miramax Films)</PRE>
<P>It's amazing how things come in pairs. Early this summer,
there was "Deep Impact" and "Armageddon," both about meteors headed
for earth. There's "Antz" with "A Bug's Life" to come. And now, after
"Simon Birch," there's yet another movie about a disabled youngster
and his friendship with a neighbor. Based on the novel "Freak the
Mighty" by Rodman Philbrick, the story unfolds through the eyes of
mopey Max (Elden Henson), a hulking kid who lives with his
grandparents ("Gram"Gena Rowlands & "Grim" Harry Dean Stanton). After
the trauma of his father murdering his mother, he has retreated into
his own private world. He rarely speaks, fails his seventh grade
classes repeatedly, and is bullied by tiny punks. Then, next door, a
single mother (Sharon Stone) and Kevin, her bright, inventive son
(Kieran Culkin, Macaulay's younger brother), move in. Kevin's legs are
in braces and his back is bent because he has Morquio's syndrome, a
degenerative condition that retards bone growth. "My father was a
magician," he explains. "He heard the words birth defect and he
disappeared."  Together, these two "misfits" battle local bullies and
their own inner demons by uniting to form "The Mighty," a towering,
heroic figure based on King Arthur's Knights of the Round
Table. Director Peter Chelsom ("Funny Bones") has fashioned a moving
drama with strong acting performances. My reservations about this film
revolve around its target audience. The bullies are terrifyingly
aggressive but it's the actions of an unrepentant ex-con that give the
film more dark menace than I'd recommend for the under-10 crowd,
despite the boys' symbiotic relationship. On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, "The Mighty" is a lively, imaginative 8. For older
children, this is an excellent family film.</P>
