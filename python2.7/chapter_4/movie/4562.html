<PRE>                           A SHORT HISTORY OF TIME
                       A film review by Lons Ponschock
                        Copyright 1996 Lons Ponschock</PRE>
<PRE>" My dreams at that time [1963]
  were rather disturbed. Before my
  condition had been diagnosed, I had
  been very bored with life.  There had
  not seemed to be anything worth doing.
  But shortly after I came out of
  hospital, I dreamt that I was going to
  be executed.  I suddenly realized that
  there were a lot of worthwhile things
  I could do if I were reprieved."</PRE>
<PRE>           - Stephen Hawking -
                                        An egg is an idea in
                                        the mind of a chicken
                                        to get more eggs.</PRE>

<PRE>                   A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME
                  directed by Erroll Morris</PRE>
<P>     This is the documentary on the life and work of
theoretical cosmologist Stephen Hawking.  I am in the
position here similar to the anecdote about some sports
figure who wrote a book and had to have someone else read it
to him.</P>
<P>     In due time, the other Netters here will be able to
explain to us what the actual import of Hawking's work is.
As with every great mind and new scientific discovery we are
reminded of the phrase from the Firesign Theater: "Everything
you know is wrong."  If I interpret what is said correctly,
Hawking is saying that the steady state theory of the
cosmology refutes Einsteinian physics which is to say that
it is Hawking's contention that God truly _does_ play at dice
with the Universe and occasionally throws them in the corner
where they cannot be seen: that there is true randomness in
the Universe.</P>
<P>     In propounding the Steady State Theory (that the
Universe is continually expanding,) it is his contention that
there is no God or that there are limits to the nature of
God's work.  (Neither Hawking nor Morris are familiar with
the work of Julian Jaynes, but this is a digression.) God can
only exist as The Creator if there is a beginning to Time:
The Big Bang theory which is the idea that the Universe began
as a violent explosion fusing bits together to form matter:
the star stuff of which Carl Sagan speaks.</P>
<P>     Morris' documentary combines theory with biographical
details from Hawking's life which were most enjoyable.  The
naturalness with which Hawking was able, through his genius,
to convert from an analytical method to a conceptual method
due to his growing infirmities from a progressive illness is
the center on which the story turns.  This is to say that
_without_ the infirmities, those conceptualizations of the
Universe; Black Hole constructions and a model of the
Universe based on a _reverse_ Black Hole may never have taken
place.</P>
<P>     The film discusses such topics as Imaginary Time,
Singularities and smooth troughs in Black Holes.</P>
<P>     -------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>     There is a story in the mysteries of the Hassidim
concerning the student who told his rabbi that he was
not satisfied with the way God made the Universe.  The
teacher asks the student, "Do you believe that you could
have done better?"  The student replies, "Yes, Rebbe, I
believe that I could."  The Master picks up the student by
the front of his garment, looks the young man in the eye
and with great force says, "Then BEGIN!"</P>

     For the discerning viewer, I suggest that after watching
this documentary a couple of times... which you will *need*
to do... that you go out and buy some Louis Prima records.</P>
