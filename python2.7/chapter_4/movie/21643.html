THE ROAD WARRIOR
(MAD MAX 2)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>The author of this review considers late 1970s and early
1980s to be the Golden Age of Science Fiction cinema. In
that relatively short period we were introduced not only to
the best science fiction films in the history of the genre;
we were also witnessed somewhat rare phenomenon of sequels
being superior to the original movies. Of course, film
aficionados often ignore this phenomenon because the
original movies were classics as well. Best known example is
THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, 1980 sequel to original STAR WARS.
However, a year later the audience was introduced to the
sequel to MAD MAX, surprisingly successful action film from
Australia. MAD MAX 2, also known as THE ROAD WARRIOR, was
not just the superior to its original; it was also
remembered as one of the most influential films of its time.
Its great commercial success spawned the entirely genre of
post-apocalyptic action films that would, decades later,
lead to WATERWORLD and POSTMAN. It was also the film that
finally launched successful careers of its lead actor Mel
Gibson and director George Miller. THE ROAD WARRIOR was also
the film that finally showed that Australian filmmakers
could compete with Hollywood, which allowed Australians to
pride themselves with one of the most vital film industries
in the world.</P>
<P>Plot of this movie takes place few years after the events in
MAD MAX. Sorry state of the civilisation, only hinted in the
original, deteriorated into total collapse, following the
World War 3 that had deprived the world industries of
necessary fuel. All mechanism of the societal order had
crumbled and in the ensuing anarchy the roads became the
domain of gangs ready to wage wars over a single drop of
fuel. Max Roxatansky (played by Mel Gibson) is former
policeman who is roaming the wastelands of Australia with
his V8 Interceptor, living on canned dog food and often
having to fight just to live another day. Along the way he
meets a bizarre character Gyro Captain (played by Bruce
Spence) who informs him about the chance to get huge
quantity of fuel. Somewhere in the desert there is a still
operating oil refinery, run by Papagallo (played by Michael
Preston) and his followers. However, this group can't have
much use of their precious fuel because their compound is
being besieged by the gang led by evil Lord Houmungus
(played by Kjell Nilsson) and his psychotic lieutenant Wez
(played by Vernon Welles). Max decides to get part of that
fuel in exchange for helping Papagallo's people reaching
safety.</P>
<P>Few films could be cited as the better example of ingenious
and effective filmmaking than THE ROAD WARRIOR was. When
George Miller shot this film, the budget looked huge
compared with the original, yet it was shoestring with
similar Hollywood projects. However, same as in the case of
MAD MAX (with second-hand cars as good illustration of
industrial decay), lack of finances turned into advantage
for Miller. Locations of New South Wales, with unforgiving,
harsh nature and road as the single and almost unnoticeable
trace of civilisation, provided the perfect setting for this
tale of post-apocalyptic world (and provided a cliche later
overused by Miller's less inspired imitators). By creating
this world, inspired by Herrman's cult comic book JEREMIAH,
Miller didn't have to spend a lot of money - the
"futuristic" clothes, vehicles and buildings aren't
futuristic at all, since they have been simply scavenged
from the remains of the civilisation. However, what Miller
did with such details made all the difference. Most obvious
example is use of fashion for the purpose of
characterisation. Good guys wear white robes (except Max),
while Bad Guys have strange combination of punk rock
hairstyles and black leather clothes more appropriate for
the protagonists of BDSM videos (that would also later be
used as post- apocalyptic cliche).</P>
<P>Another thing that turns THE ROAD WARRIOR into the triumph
of creative filmmaking are the action scenes. The
post-apocalyptic world is rather unspectacular by itself;
but the brutal realities of such world - prospect of murder,
rape, pillage, all presented in very naturalistic and often
gory fashion - face the protagonists with the need to act
fast in order to survive. So, the film is full of superbly
edited, ingenious and suspenseful action scenes. One of the
excellent examples is the final battle, breathtaking yet
able to provide us with unexpected twists, black humour and
even the scene that could match Hitchcock's PSYCHO with the
shock value. And all that was done with small budget,
without computer graphics with small, but dedicated and
talented band of stuntmen doing most of the work. Those
scenes are extremely violent, but all that violence does
make sense in the context of the story.</P>
<P>Of course, that doesn't mean that this film lacks good
characters and plot. Some of the critics were put down by
the lack of dialogue and often considered this film as
nothing more than the cheap excuse for 90 minutes of
violence. It may look that way on the surface, but this film
has more depth that any other action film. First of all,
bleak future presented in this world didn't look that
fantastic for the audiences of the early 1980s; the new oil
crisis and resurrection of Cold War after the decade of
detante created rather pessimistic worldview in which the
collapse of civilisation really looked close. Same as CONAN
THE BARBARIAN, another forgotten and ignored masterpiece of
1981, THE ROAD WARRIOR dealt with society deprived of
civilisation. That was the perfect setting for Miller to
portray the eternal conflict between Men As They Should Be
and Men As They Are. The simple plot, borrowed from classic
westerns, provided an interesting and thought-provoking
contrast between two groups. On one hand we have Good Guys -
idealists who work very hard to keep the values of old
world, even when such values, like democracy, happen to be
rather impractical in the new circumstances. And while they
argue about their course of action, Bad Guys don't have any
dilemmas - those who don't have scruples and who use brute
power are those who are adapted for this world. Although the
viewers sympathise with the former, they know that the
latter would win.</P>
<P>Into this conflict comes the mysterious, lone figure in the
form of Mel Gibson. His character doesn't talk much, but his
actions are short, decisive and quite obvious, as well as
his motivation. But in the course of this film Max slowly
transforms into the real hero, the same one which inhabits
collective unconsciousness of every culture on this planet -
lone person that would make the difference and save people
from grave danger. His mythical figure is accompanied with
the whole bunch of interesting and memorable characters that
paint broad pictures with small gestures and details. We
have obligatory comic sidekick in the form of Bruce Spence
as Gyro Captain, who is less troubled with the collapse of
civilisation than with his personal sexual frustration. The
other characters are also fleshed-out (for example, child
actor Emil Ginty as Feral Kid and Virginia Hey foreshadowing
feminist role models of the 90ies as Warrior Woman) and it
is real shame that most of the actors playing them didn't
enhance their careers afterwards. The sole exception is
Vernon Welles, whose homosexual villain (rather rare thing
in cinema, especially these days) later brought him numerous
roles of heavies in 1980s.</P>
<P>THE ROAD WARRIOR, unfortunately, shared another thing with
CONAN THE BARBARIAN - infantilised and uninspired sequel in
mid- 1980s. However, those who really appreciate good,
thought provoking yet entertaining films would never fail to
see THE ROAD WARRIOR as true masterpiece.</P>
