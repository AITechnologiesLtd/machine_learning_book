<PRE>`Fight Club' – No Knockout but a Few Good Jabs
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>If there's one thing that `Fight Club' unabashedly
displays, it's that the era of the sensitive male is
over.  Men do not gush with gooey sentimentality. 
Restraint is only a temporary state of mind.  There is
an animal inside all of us, and it's aching to break
out.  But the rules of society and the pleas of our
local community beg all of us to be kinder and
gentler.  Thus, we simply brush aside any feelings of
aggression and replace them with happy thoughts and
trance music.  But just once, I'd like catch up to the
guy who cut me off and run him off the road.</P>
<P>With that in mind, `Fight Club' is a movie to which
many of us can relate.  Narrated by the angst-filled
Edward Norton, he represents something that is
probably inside many of us.  Dressed in buttoned white
shirts and solid dark ties, he's stuck in a job that
gradually squeezes every ounce of passion from his
life.  He is the beleaguered worker whose personal
nirvana comes from furnishing his condo with as many
items from the IKEA catalogue as possible.  There is
very little excitement in his life as he constantly
drifts between a state of consciousness and
unconsciousness.  This man has every reason to be
angry.  But he doesn't have the spirit to do so.  He
has been asleep far too long.  </P>
<P>His life is a stark contrast to soap maker, salesman,
and chance acquaintance, Tyler Durden (the chiseled
Brad Pitt).  Everything about Tyler is a little bit
larger than life.  He's extremely confident, donning
red-tinted glasses and looking somewhat like a pimp. 
He's extremely intelligent, reciting to him how
certain household chemicals can be easily mixed
together to form highly power explosives.  And he's
fearless, taking him on a raid of a liposuction clinic
where he steals human fat needed for the high quality
of his soap.  Tyler is God.  He talks, walks, and
attracts girls in the way that Norton's narrator never
could.</P>
<P>The only commonality between them is that they both
possess pent aggression that they need to release. 
Finally, Tyler says, `Hit me as hard as you can. 
You'll never learn anything about yourself unless
you've been in a fight.'   So, the first swing is
taken and surprisingly, there is actually something
therapeutic about clenching one's fist and thrusting
it forward into someone else's face.  Fight Club is
born.  Soon, other men are joining this secret
society.  They are the local garbagemen, drivers,
delivery boys, waiters and middle managers who are
sick and tired of their lives.  Fight Club can bring
about the catharsis that they so desperately seek,
which outweighs any pain that they feel from the
myriad of broken noses and bruised faces.</P>
<P>Up through the first act, I enjoyed the essence and
smartness of `Fight Club.'  It's a good-looking film
with a terrific effort by Norton and Pitt.  And I also
liked Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), as the frustrated
loner who can't understand why pounding each other
with fists is better than having sex with her.  Then I
realized that the men who participate in Fight Club do
not find the spiritual freedom that they so badly
want.  Oddly, Fight Club evolves into some kind of
cult where members engage in acts of vandalism
throughout the city.   The argument can be made that
the direction in which the film takes asks the
question of ‘how far is too far.'  With Norton at one
end of the spectrum and Pitt at the other, can a
comfortable middle ground be found or does one side
have to give it all up?  It's an interesting question
to be sure, and I wish that there were a smarter way
in which the film tries to answer the question.  As it
stands, `Fight Club' is philosophy on one end of the
spectrum and glossy thriller at the other end with no
comfortable middle ground.</P>
