<P>Capsule: Four Ladies clump together to rent a castle in Italy for the
month of April in the early 1920's.  The film revolves around the four
of them their relationships with men and with each other as they go on
their journey from a rainy London to Italy and their stay there.  (+2).</P>

<P>     This year's London Film Festival opened with the World Premiere of
ENCHANTED APRIL, a film made by the BBC, in conjunction with Miramax,
and in the same series as TRULY, MADLY, DEEPLY.  The film is a
delightful little picture that, although not fast in the early stages,
blossoms once the participants reach Italy.</P>
<P>     The performances are exquisite as each of the four leading women
blossom in turn as they find a new facet of their existence.  Although
it was made for television, I would reckon that the film works better in
the cinema where the audience can't switch over before the film takes off
and the beautiful photography of Italy is enhanced on the large screen.</P>
<P>     ENCHANTED APRIL takes place in the early 1920s when four ladies,
strangers at the beginning of the film, decide to rent a house in Italy
for the month of April.  The film is based on the novel by Elizabeth Von
Arnim.</P>
<P>     The film will be getting a theatrical release in the UK later this
year and I thoroughly recommend it as an enjoyable evening's
entertainment.</P>
<P>     The London Film Festival Continues until 21 November at the
National Film Theatre and around London.  For further information call
