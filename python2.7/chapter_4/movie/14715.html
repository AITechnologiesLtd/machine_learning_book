<P>Susan Granger's review of 'SHADRACH" (Columbia Pictures)</P>
<P>Based on a short story by William Styron, "Shadrach" is a piece
of Americana, set in the Depression-era of 1935, as a young boy
recalls three unforgettable summer days when he was ten years old. As
the only child in a proper, middle-class Virginia family, Paul
Whitehurst (Scott Terra) often escapes to the ramshackle house of
impoverished neighbors, the earthy, volatile Dabneys (Harvey Keitel,
Andie MacDowell), who have seven mischievous children, one of whom is
his best friend. One hot afternoon while the boys are shooting
marbles, a frail, 99 year-old former slave, Shadrach (John Franklin
Sawyer), appears, having walked from Alabama to be buried on the old
Dabney grounds he fondly remembers from childhood. When the Dabneys,
who have fallen on hard times, realize his quest, attempting to
fulfill his final wish and allowing him to die in dignity has a
profound effect on everyone, as the family embarks on a heartbreaking,
hilarious expedition to the dilapidated family plantation, discovering
"Death ain't nothing to be afraid of. It's life to be feared of."
Harvey Keitel's benign bigot, who is touched by an old slave, is the
kind of character he hasn't done before, just as the beer-guzzling
mother is a change of pace for Andie MacDowell.  First-time
writer/director Susanna Styron's integrity scores with her father's
fictionalized, autobiographical, character-driven material, touching
our human chord of kindness. Curiously, both "Shadrach" and William
Styron's "Sophie's Choice" are about living survivors of the defining
tragedy of their century: slavery and the Holocaust, respectively. On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Shadrach" is a poignant,
compassionate 8. It's a gem, a gentle, funny, family story that will
find a place in your heart.</P>
