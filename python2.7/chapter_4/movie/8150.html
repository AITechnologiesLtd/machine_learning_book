<PRE>                              ULEE'S GOLD
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A Florida beekeeper foils two petty
          hoods while he saves his family. This same plot
          could have been a simple--even a bad--crime film.
          What makes this better than simple cable fare are
          the deep emotional resonance, the textured
          filmmaking, and the fine performances.  This is a
          moving story of what a single man can accomplish.
          Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4) 7 (0 to 10)
          New York Critics: 18 positive, 0 negative, 4 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Ulysses "Ulee" Jackson (played by Peter Fonda) is a beekeeper from
a small, sweaty town in the Florida panhandle.  He lives with his two
granddaughters (Vanessa Zima and Jessica Biel) in what in a nicer
neighborhood would be called a "dysfunctional" family.  The older
granddaughter is a little wild and does not have a lot of respect for
her grandfather.  Ulee's son-in-law Jimmy (Tom Wood) is in the
penitentiary for robbing an armored car.  And his daughter-in-law Helen
has run off to have a good time, leaving her two daughters to Ulee.
Hurt by the most of the people he loved, Ulee has withdrawn into
himself emotionally.  He relies on nobody and nobody can let him down.
He has trained his family to never ask the help of outsiders.  Above
all he maintains his integrity and his dignity, even at the expense of
a backache or two or not meeting his honey production goals.</P>
<P>     Then Jimmy gets word from his two partners in the robbery, still
free, that they have Helen in Orlando, high on drugs, and they want
someone to take her off their hands.  When Ulee comes to pick her up,
they make clear how they have used her and at the same time tell Ulee
that they want the $100,000 of bank money from the robbery that they
just found out that Jimmy had and hid from them and the police.  Ulee
brings home Helen, but finds that she is too much to handle in drug
withdrawal and he is forced to ask help of the nurse who rents from
Ulee a house across the street from his house.  Ulee wants as little
help as he can manage, but it is the time of year he needs to give a
lot of attention to his business of producing honey.</P>
<P>     Peter Fonda has never been the most expressive of actors, but here
it works to his advantage playing a man who has retreated into his
shell and divorced himself from his emotions.  This is being called the
best role of Fonda's career, but it may be just a matter of calling for
the type of non-emotive acting that Fonda is best at.  The entire cast
does well with Steven Flynn and Dewey Weber genuinely detestable as
Jimmy's two slimy partners.</P>
<P>     The film DEAD CALM would have been a standard stalker if it had
not included some fascinating scenes of how Sam Neill, as a nautical
man, saves a foundering yacht.  Just seeing the processes used by an
expert makes for some good filmmaking.  Though ULEE'S GOLD does not
take full advantage some of the most interesting scenes of the film
show how Ulee maintains the hives and the discussions of rotating the
hives and the various grades of honey.  In addition these scenes
characterize Ulee as a careful and contentious man who does things a
step at a time.  His care to repair the hives and to return the bees
that have strayed makes a metaphor for Ulee's care for his home.  Later
his behavior around the bees is his guide for how to handle the two
hoodlums who threaten his family.  Unfortunately only in certain scenes
is it clear what Fonda is doing with the hives.  This is not a
documentary on beekeeping, but it would not have taken a lot of effort
to make the task a little more comprehensible.  Though even as it is it
does engage the viewer.</P>
<PRE>     Victor Nunez tells a simple powerful story of emotional depth.  I
rate it a low +2  on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
