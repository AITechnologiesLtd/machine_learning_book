<PRE>Braveheart
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1996 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Mel Gibson is William Wallace, the Scot commoner who started and lead the
rebellion against the English and shamed Robert the Bruce into joining and
finishing their fight for freedom. An epic film in all senses of the word, the
movie is a spectacular feast for the senses.</P>
<P>In this story, Wallace goes on a killing spree when the occupying English
troops kill his wife to draw him into battle. His search for revenge draws in
their village and eventually the entire country.</P>
<P>The rebellion of sons and the fulfillment of their father's desire themes runs
throughout the tale. Wallace is raised by an uncle when his father is killed
and he is living his father's warrior legacy. The treacherous English King and
his son have a strained relationship to put it mildly, as do Bruce and his
Machiavellian father.  Two of Wallace's most trusted warriors are a father-son
team. </P>
<P>The battle scenes as the blue-painted `Woad Warrior' Gibson and his army of
berserkers attack the invaders are impressive and convincing in their blood
and gore. It makes sense that a war with hundreds of men armed with swords and
battle axes would not be a pleasant sight, but viewers with an aversion to
graphic violence are forewarned. Gaping wounds and decapitated bodies by the
score surround the blood-splattered Scots.</P>
<P>There are a few cultural stereotypes – a hot-blooded French babe, a weak gay
prince, a mad Irishman – that go against the grain of the current politically
correct wave, but they're still intriguing, believable characters.</P>
<P>The film is long, but you won't want to miss a minute. Skip the 10-gallon
Coke, you won't find a convenient time for that trip to the restroom.</P>
<P>[This appeared in the 5/30/96 "Bloomington Voice", Bloomington, Indiana.
