<P>You know how every now and then, a film comes out that just blows the roof
of the entire movie industry? I'm talking a film that not only challenges
your mind, but one that completely sweeps you into a world that you'd never
even thought about before? Sparks of originality, chemistry all around! Sure
you do, and so do I, which is why I could say in full confidence that this
film is anything but that kind of a movie.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A rich, snooty woman living the "good life" in Florence, Italy, during the
late 1930s, suddenly finds herself caught up in a messy love triangle
involving a wealthy, older gentleman, a younger, more abrasive American, and
an Austrian refugee. When a murder takes place, the politics of the day take
over, and the film switches its romance gears into those featuring intrigue.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This film is full of pretty pictures, nice decorations and beautiful
scenery, but lacks any palpable romance, tension or chemistry. It's just
sort of "there". It's a film which never really bored me at any point, it
was like being a voyeur at a rich guy's party, but never really managed to
get me excited about anything either. Sean Penn, who has always been one of
favorite actors, despite continually bashing the craft that consistently
feeds him, is actually pretty so-so in this film, underplaying the part and
appearing strangely out of place. Of course, Kirsten Scott Thomas invented
these movies, so she certainly fit her role like a glove, but unfortunately
her character, who is the lead in the film, doesn't really provide the
audience with any tangible reasons to like her. I mean, she's obviously very
pretty but am I supposed to feel for a lady that dicks around with every
Tom, Dick and Arnold, while making decisions on her life based primarily
around finances? Sure, the film offers some insight as to the deep-rooted
misappropriations of values which these people apparently subscribed to at
the time, but I could only invest so much of myself into folks with  whom I
obviously have zero in common (besides the fact that every guy seemed to
want to dick Kirsten Scott Thomas). The romance level is also pretty thin in
this film, with only a tiny shred of it showing up between Penn and Thomas,
a little more in Thomas' relationship with Davies, but generally
non-existent.</P>
<P>Of course, the film turns into more of a "political" game during its second
half, but none of that really interested me much either. No real tension,
just a little politics here and there, nothing we haven't seen before. And
when is Jeremy Davies finally going to play a character different from every
single one that he portrays in all of his other movies? Dude, it's pretty
obvious that you could play the "shy, nervous, twitchy guy", but how about
taking a shot at a role with a little more range? The ending of the movie is
also pretty weak and foreseeable, with much of what goes on, predictable and
tidy. Having said all that, I did enjoy looking at this film, the scenery,
the actors and the wonderful city of Florence, which were all quite
spectacular. I also loved Anne Bancroft's performance, which let her chew up
and spit out most of the scenery around her. Great job, Mrs. Brooks! As well
as Derek Jacobi's comical turn as Lucky Leadbetter. And yes, Scott Thomas
does deliver a decent showing, but somehow it all seems to be a little "old
hat" with her. This film might ultimately entertain those content enough to
sit and watch some really pretty and pretentious people prance around in
lush surroundings with little more than a simple story to tell. But on the
whole, the film didn't manage to entertain me enough to recommend it to any
of my friends. And yes, dear reader...I consider you my friend (fluttering
eyelashes) :)</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Anne Bancroft's birth name is Anna Maria Louisa Italiano (do you think she's
Italian?). She was born in The Bronx, New York in 1931, and has been married
to writer/actor/director Mel Brooks since 1964.
Kirsten Scott Thomas' younger sister Serena Scott Thomas, had a role in the
latest James Bond flick, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH (7/10), in which she played
Dr. Molly Warmflash. Director Philip Haas also directed Kirsten in the 1995
movie ANGELS AND INSECTS.
Jeremy Davies' birth name was Jeremy Boring.
Actor Derek Jacobi was the mentor and acting instructor of fellow British
actor Kenneth Branagh. He also won a Tony in 1985 for "Much Ado About
Nothing", a play which friend Branagh turned into a movie in 1993. Also, Mr.
Jacobi was apparently one of the few runners-up for the part of Hannibal
Lecter in the original SILENCE OF THE LAMBS movie. Of course, that part
eventually went to fellow Brit Anthony Hopkins.
Director Philip Haas and screenwriter Belinda Haas are indeed husband and
wife.</P>
