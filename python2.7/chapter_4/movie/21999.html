<PRE>Deep Rising
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Treat Williams; Famke Janssen; Anthony Heald; Kevin J. O'Connor &
Wes Studi</P>
<P>A luxury cruise liner is on its maiden voyage when terrorists decide to
hijack it. The terrorists only have one problem -- when they board the
vessel, they find that all the passengers have been killed by a sea
monster -- and they are its next meal. Deep Rising is not real heavy in the
plot department, as you might have gleaned from that very brief synopsis.
This is what you would call a typical b-horror flick if it weren't for the
fact that the production values are high enough to bring it out of the
low-budget b-basement. It's obvious that far more effort was expended on the
look of this film than on the story.</P>
<P>I'm taking my shots at this movie, but to tell the truth, as average monster
flicks go, this was fairly entertaining. The cast, while far from
outstanding, wasn't that bad. Treat Williams and Famke Janssen (Goldeneye)
head up the cast. Sure, Treat was a bit over the top, and Famke was clearly
cast more for her stunning looks that her acting talent, but they were fun
to watch together on screen. The supporting cast of mostly unknowns is good
while they are with us. But, as is typical with movies like this, most are
just meals in waiting for the nasty sea monster. It goes after, and devours
things with a great deal of zeal and gore. We mustn't forget the gore in a
film like this. If there were no gross-out moments, where would we be?</P>
<P>The CGI monster shots are not bad (certainly no where near as bad as
Anaconda was), but they won't be heralded as groundbreaking either. They
work well in a movie of this caliber. The ship is very well done -- most of
the action seems to take place on the lower flooded levels of this rapidly
sinking cruise liner, and it all is very impressive from that standpoint. Of
course, the lower decks are also consistently splattered with generous
helpings of gory slime and excreted digested human bodies. How appetizing.</P>
<P>Fun little flick. No more suspension of disbelief required here than in any
other typical horror/monster movie. Just sit back with a big bowl of popcorn
and enjoy. But I would finish the popcorn before they start going to the
lower decks, if I were you. Enjoy.</P>
