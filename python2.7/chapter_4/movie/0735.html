                               PRETTY WOMAN
                       A film review by J. M. Ivler
                        Copyright 1990 J. M. Ivler</PRE>
<PRE>      Movie Review: Pretty Woman
      Stars:        Richard Gere and Julia Roberts
      Director:     Gary Marshall
      Released by:  Touchstone and Silver Screen Partners
      Produced by:  Arnon Milchan</PRE>
<PRE>      Pre-released: 16-Feb-90
      Release date: 23-Feb-90</PRE>
<P>Overview: Take one *very* rich man.  Add one "smart cookie" who has not had
good breaks and is "working the streets."  Mix well.  Add one very sappy
ending.  Serve.  For a formula movie, it was entertaining.  Not recommended for
children.</P>
<P>     The acting was above par (Gere downplayed, Roberts overplayed) and 
although the plot left a lot to be desired (anyone could have figured it out
from the first few frames) it proved to be a fun movie.</P>
<P>     Some of the characterizations and motivations that surrounded Gere and
Roberts were poorly drawn sketches that lacked any real substance.  Others were
well defined and were played by actors clearly able to understate the roles.
The overall lack of emotion throughout the film may make it seen disjointed at
times, but also provides an excellent counterbalence to those times when the
emotion is show.  Those emotions, sometimes a delicate as the changes in
Roberts face as she watches her first opera, have far more impact than they
would have had this picture been made with a constant flow of emotional highs
and lows.</P>
<P>     Although the plotting is somewhat predictable, almost everyone can leave
it with a smile (maybe shaking their head no, since it is so predictable, but
smiling).  A feel-good movie that doesn't require a large amount of thought,
but does provide entertainment.</P>
<PRE>Rating: (-4 - +4) +2</PRE>
