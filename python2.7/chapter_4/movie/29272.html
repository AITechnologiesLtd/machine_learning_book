<P>Susan Granger's review of "RAT RACE" (Paramount Pictures)</P>
<P>   Like Stanley Kramer's "It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World" (1963), this
silly screwball comedy has a simple premise. Six unsuspecting people, along with
their partners, are entered a bizarre "human rat race" devised by an eccentric
Las Vegas casino owner (John Cleese) as a new kind of gambling game for his
Venetian Hotel high-stakes rollers who can make bets on the outcome. Each
contestant, chosen at random, is given a key to a locker in a train station in
Silver City, New Mexico, containing a duffel bag filled with two million
dollars. Whoever gets there first keeps the loot - and there are no rules. The
competitors include Whoopi Goldberg and Lanai Chapman, a reunited birth-mother
and ambitious daughter, who are sent over a cliff by frustrated Kathy Bates;
con-artist brothers Seth Green and Vince Vieluf, who plot to sabotage the
airport's radar system, thus forcing others to find slower transportation;
Breckin Meyer and Amy Smart, who use a helicopter since it doesn't need the
airport radar; Jon Lovitz and Kathy Najimy, who planned to see David Copperfield
but wind up stealing Hitler's Mercedes limo; Rowan Atkinson, a narcoleptic
Italian, who grabs a ride with ambulance driver Wayne Knight, who is
transporting a heart to Texas; and Cuba Gooding Jr., a disgraced NFL ref who,
stranded in the desert, hijacks a chartered bus filled with Lucille Ball
impersonators. Writer Andy Breckman ("Sgt. Bilko") and director Jerry Zucker
("Airplane!") show no restraint, throwing in every gag imaginable to get a
laugh. Unfortunately, several of them miss the mark due to bad timing, the
schtick wears thin, and the conclusion is corny and contrived. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Rat Race" is an absurd, madcap 5  but it's not, as
claimed, "the gambling experience of a lifetime.</P>
