<P>"Radioland Murders" was a long time pet project for Excecutive Producer
George Lucas, who first thought it up after finishing "American Graffiti"
in 1973. He had his friends, who also helped him write "American Graffiti",
Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck (also responsible for films like "Howard the
Duck" and "Best Defense") write a screenplay, which was subsequently
rewritten by sitcom writers Osborn and Reno before the movie finally went
into production in 1993.</P>
<P>The movie takes place in 1939 and concerns a struggling radio station, WBN
in Chicago, that plans to take on the three major radio networks in
America. It is opening night, and the cast of zany characters have to cope
with last-minute script changes, hostile sponsors and MURDER. Brian Benben
plays Roger Henderson, one of the writers for the radio station. He is dead
set on winning back his soon-to-be ex-wife, Peggy Henderson (Mary Stuart
Masterson), secretary to the station manager (Ned Beatty). Peggy is
convinced that he has been unfaithful with the sex-crazed Claudette
Katzenback, the "va-va-va-voom" girl (Anita Morris), who is married to the
station's owner (Larry Miller, with a terrible german accent). In reality,
Claudette has been getting it on with everyone at the station except for
Roger, especially the director (Jeffrey Tambor), who is being blackmailed
by the trumpet player. When the trumpet player is killed, things start
going to hell...</P>
<P>The premise holds some promise for great comedy, but the writers seem to
have confused "frantic action" with "humor" too much of the time. During
the too-long 112 minutes you are hit over the had with gag after gag, too
many of which fall flat. The cast contains many familiar faces, so many in
fact, that you fail to make an emotional connection with any of them. Some,
like Bobcat Goldthwait, Cristopher Lloyd, Harvey Korman, George Burns and
many others, play so small and pointless characters that you wonder why
they are even there.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, there are many things about "Radioland Murders" that actually
work. Brian Benben (from the TV series "Dream On") is quite a good leading
man, and manages to evoke smiles and laugter from time to time, as do
Michael Lerner and Dylan Baker as a pair of detectives. The production
design and overall look of the film is excellent, and you'd never know the
movie was shot with a budget of only $10 Million. After all, with George
Lucas, the owner of the THX programme and Industrial Light & Magic, on
board you can excpect top-notch a Audio- and Visual experience.</P>
<P>However, the hyperactive pace of the film and the inscessant cross-cutting
between events, on stage and off, detracts from the overall enjoyment of
the film. If the filmmakers had only taken it easier (and allowed some more
re-writes) it might have been better. Still, if you are rested and prepared
for 112 minutes of mayhem and craziness and you manage to overlook the 50%
of jokes that don't work, you will find that Radioland Murders is a movie
quite unlike any other, frantic and flat in places, but still amusing and
interesting to watch.</P>
