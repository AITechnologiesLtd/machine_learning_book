<P>     Rosewood, central Florida, 1923.  The town's population numbered 
about 120, mostly black.  It was a prosperous, happy community until a 
January day when one woman's lie set off a chain of events that would 
have devastating results.  That woman was Fanny Taylor, and her false 
claim to have been assaulted by a black man resulted in the formation of 
a lynch mob that headed for Rosewood with arson and murder on their 
minds.  Before the week was over, blood was shed and the town was in 
ashes.  </P>
<P>     The quote that was foremost in my mind as I sat down to watch the 
fact-based ROSEWOOD came from director John Singleton:  "I am concerned 
about absolute historical accuracy to an extent, but I am really more 
worried about being truthful to the essence of what happened at 
Rosewood... I am making a movie that people will respond to."  Indeed, 
this motion picture, which combines the flavor of a John Ford western 
with Singleton's uniquely visceral power, is an epic that stands alone 
in the latter weeks of a dismal movie winter.</P>
<P>     Following his dramatic debut in 1991 with BOYZ 'N THE HOOD, 
Singleton attempted two other contemporary tales -- one was a love story 
(POETIC JUSTICE) and the other was an ensemble piece set on a college 
campus (HIGHER LEARNING).  Neither came close to the impact of the 
director's first feature.  With ROSEWOOD, however, Singleton has once 
again fulfilled the promise he exhibited when the Academy honored him 
with a Best Director nomination.  Despite an occasional narrative 
hiccup, this is a rich and moving motion picture.</P>
<P>     If Singleton takes liberties with the historical account of what 
happened at Rosewood (and that account is murky at best -- the death 
count differs greatly depending on which source is being consulted), 
it's in the name of dramatic license, and it works.  This is a deeply 
affecting tale about the naked emotional and physical devastation that 
can be wrought by racial hatred.  But it is also a story of hope that 
highlights the indomitable nature of the human spirit and the fraternity 
that can bind together two apparently different people.  ROSEWOOD does 
not glamorize evil, but neither does it demonize those who practice it.  
Singleton is careful to present a balanced and believable picture of the 
participants on both sides.  The result presents a forceful message 
without ever preaching.</P>
<P>     Jon Voight and Ving Rhames, both of whom appeared in last summer's 
blockbuster, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, lead an impressive cast.  Voight is 
John Wright, the head of the only white household in Rosewood.  Wright 
is a store owner who finds himself torn between cultures.  The blacks 
view him with suspicion and distrust; the whites see him as a traitor to 
his race.  One aspect of ROSEWOOD focuses on his attempts to find solace 
for his tormented soul.  Meanwhile, Rhames plays Mann, the only entirely 
fictional character in the film.  A wandering World War I veteran, he 
comes to Rosewood seeking peace.  What he finds instead is another war.  
And, after being decorated for saving the lives of men on the 
battlefield in Europe, here he finds himself fighting to rescue women 
and children from an equally implacable enemy.</P>
<P>     While both Voight and Rhames are exemplary, they are ably 
supported.  Don Cheadle (DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS) is Sylvester Carrier, an 
outspoken citizen who refuses to let the white man walk all over him.  
Esther Rolle brings dignity and a quiet sadness to the role of Sarah 
Carrier, Sylvester's mother.  Michael Rooker plays a sheriff torn 
between his own distaste for black people and his growing horror at what 
is transpiring.  And Bruce McGill portrays one of the most chillingly 
realistic crackers ever to appear on screen.  His is a startling 
performance because he defies tradition by not going over-the-top.</P>
<P>     While ROSEWOOD must be seen as a cohesive whole to be fully 
appreciated, there are isolated moments that stand out because of their 
haunting power.  One of the most startling depicts white folk picnicking 
and frolicking while Rosewood burns in the background.  In another 
scene, McGill's character carefully teaches his son how to make a noose 
for a lynching -- one of the essential lessons he must learn to become a 
man.  There are, in fact, times when ROSEWOOD is reminiscent of 
SCHINDLER'S LIST.  There's a kernel of truth that both films have in 
common -- the theme of the duality of human nature:  the capacity for 
great good and great evil, boundless love and infinite hatred.  And, 
while this film is not as well-paced or tightly-structured as 
Spielberg's Holocaust drama, it evokes many of the same feelings and 
emotions.  It is an important film that should not be missed.</P>
