<P>PLOT:
A cute and cuddly cheerleading squad consider robbing a bank, when their
captain gets preggers and must deal with the harsh reality of paying bills,
etc... The girls watch movies and talk to some real-life con-women to get
prepared for their roles.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Despite my rating of "so-so", I was actually disappointed with this movie
because its fresh and punchy premise started off strong, only to disappear
in the film's less than impressive second half. What the heck happened
there? Here's a movie that bangs out on all cylinders, give you a few
smiles, a few laughs, some dark comedy and a very cool idea, and suddenly
about halfway through, the screenwriter seems to have given up on the whole
thing and just wrapped it all up with some filler. I'd love to know what
happened. If anyone associated with this production can explain this to me,
please email me...seriously! My theory is that the "premise" of the movie
alone sold it to the production company. "Five wholesome cheerleading
teenage girls out to rob banks"-- where do we sign? But once production
started, they probably realized that they actually had to make a complete
story out of this very cool premise and despite the second half playing
"okay", most people will likely be let down. Seemed kinda anticlimactic to
me. But all is not lost, since the film does still ring original, which is
why I would still recommend it to most.</P>
<P>Just take some HEATHERS, grab a stick o' RESERVOIR DOGS and dash it all up
with some BRING IT ON (natch, the film grossed all kinds of dough last year)
and that's pretty much what you've got here, albeit...on a very light tip.
The girls are all very good in their roles, over-the-top, goofy and pretty
sexy for the most part. Teenage boys can't really go wrong with this movie,
as the girls love to walk around in their cutesy-patootsy cheerleading
outfits no matter where they go, and we even get a couple of Victoria's
Secret moments. Woo-hoo! And teenage girls will likely connect to the whole
concept of wanting to rob banks in Betty masks...uuuhmmm, well, you get the
idea. Female empowerment, rah-rah and all that jazz! And howsabout that
James Marsden? Yowsa! And kudos to the makers of this film for tipping the
proper cap of homage out to their influences such as POINT BREAK, HEAT and
many more. So what can you take away from this review? Well, I liked the
whole "idea" of the movie, enjoyed most of its execution, till about the
half-way point, and was pretty disappointed in the film's second half (which
slowed and seemed to forget about one character in particular...what the
hell?) and its very weak ending. I don't know what to tell you, kids. I'm
pretty much in the middle on this one. Great marketing, cool premise, creepy
masks, but in the end, too much unrealized potential. Check out my ratings
of similar films below and see if you jive with me at all.</P>
<P>PS: And by the way, Heather Graham does not star in this movie! I know, I
know...the lead girl looks EXACTLY like her, but trust me when I tell you
that it's not her. It took The Arrow and I some time to figure this out, but
geez, do they ever look alike or what? The actress' name in question in
Marley Shelton.</P>
