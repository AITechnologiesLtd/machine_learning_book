<PRE>                                DANTE'S PEAK
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     For those keeping score, here's the new Hollywood movie formula: 
TWISTER - tornado + other disaster = $$$!</P>
<P>     $$$ may be right, but ***** is definitely not forthcoming, at least
not in the case of DANTE'S PEAK, a shameless and blatant rip-off of the
mildly entertaining aforementioned film that is largely responsible for
the return to prominence of the disaster movie.  This time around, it's
a volcano that threatens the peace of little Dante's Peak, and it's
Pierce Brosnan who comes to the rescue.</P>
<P>     Here's how frightening the similarities are.  Both films open with
a flashback explaining why this particular act of nature is so traumatic
to the hero (Helen Hunt in TWISTER, Brosnan in PEAK).  Both feature a
team of gosh-darn-nutty scientists investigating the disasters, plus an
unlikely romance-on-the-run for the leads.  Both sport far-too-crisp
digital effects.  Both are full of small-town kitsch (TWISTER is set in
the midwest, PEAK is a sleepy Northwestern village).  Both are full of
bad jokes and bad acting to go along with the bad weather.  Both have a
"grandma" character *and* a dog who are injured by the force of nature. 
Hell, both even feature a big red truck that gets destroyed by the
disaster in question!</P>
<P>     DANTE'S PEAK, trying to outdo TWISTER with a volcano, ups the level
of things that are destroyed, and it features lots of ash raining down,
flowing lava, and lots and lots of buildings blowing up(!)  And that's
really about it.  Really.</P>
<P>     But what makes PEAK so bad, where TWISTER was passably good?  Is it
the cheeseball dialogue and a really horrid performance from Linda
Hamilton?  Or is it the precocious children?  Is it the fact that if
everyone in the town of Dante's Peak wasn't dumber than a post, this
whole disaster would have been avoided (that means you, grandma)?</P>
<PRE>     I say, let 'em fry.  DANTE'S PEAK blows.</PRE>
