<P>   "It's not always good to let things calm down," advises
Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear) when his next-door neighbor
Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) hesitates to pursue a romance. 
"As Good As It Gets" is a rare romantic comedy in which the
audience does not have to worry: things never get too calm,
particularly when its lead performer inhabits the role of an
obsessive-compulsive misanthrope whom Moliere would
probably write about if the great French playwright were alive
today.  James L. Brooks, who co-wrote the script and directed
it with precise comic timing is, as critic David Thomson
describes, "living proof that American television, week after
week, can deliver smart, well-written, beautifully played
comedy series that are devoted to being decent and humane
without seeming smug or idiotic."  With Jack Nicholson in his
classic role as a highly-strung urbanite and Helen Hunt as
Carol Connelly, the woman who makes a mensch out of him,
"As Good As It Gets" is perhaps the year's smartest comedy. 
To Brooks's credit, the film's romantic theme even draws
great moments of sympathy for its three principal characters,
all of whom seem destined to have happiness forever elude
them.  </P>
<P>   At one point in the tender and whimsical tale, Melvin pays a
surprise visit to his psychoanalyst, Dr. Green (Lawrence
Kasdan) and, looking with dismay at the sad sacks in the
waiting room asks himself, "Is this as good as it gets?" 
Considering that the man is a highly successful writer of sixty-
two novels living on a classy street in New York's Greenwich
Village, we are at first surprised that life could appear to him 
prosaic, at best.  But this film will assure those of us with very
ordinary incomes that money and fame do not automatically
guarantee happiness.  Melvin Udall is the sort of guy who is
really not out in the world, not the kind who would attend
writers' conferences in the Hamptons or even know that there
are certain rules that govern civilized speech.  He seems
either happy about his capacity to insult people with almost
every comment he makes or completely unaware of his effect
on humanity, all of whom are more likely than not to cross the
street upon seeing him or hide from their waitress stations in
restaurants when he approaches their tables.  Luckily for
Melvin, though, he has a soft spot for the only waitress he will
allow to serve him, the only one, in fact, who will put up with
his abuse--Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) who is in her late
thirties and is troubled with a chronically asthmatic little boy
who is often left in the care of Carol's mother, Beverly (Shirley
Knight).</P>
<P>   In what is easily his best role to date, Greg Kinnear shines
as Melvin's gay next-door neighbor whose Brussels Griffon
dog Verdell (Jill) is sent down the compactor chute by Melvin,
who hates dogs as much as he dislikes people.  Scripters
James L. Brooks and Mark Andrus score points for irony in
showing how the little dog, the love of Simon's life, actually
shows a preference for Melvin's company--so much so that
even when his owner holds up a strip of bacon and invites the
dog to come, Verdell heads right for Melvin's arms.</P>
<P>   Until the very conclusion of the film, Melvin seems
completely unable to filter out his anti-social feelings before
expressing them or, as some would say more appropriately,
to engage the brain before putting the mouth into motion. 
When Simon is severely attacked and confined to a
wheelchair by the jealous lover of a man (Skeet Ulrich) he is
sketching, Melvin assures him "You'll be back on your knees
in no time," and when a woman of Latin American
background speaks to him with a flourish, he asks, "Where
did you pick up that talk...in some Panama City hump-hump
bar?"  Despite his affection for Carol, while he spends an
evening with her at a posh restaurant in which he is not
admitted until he puts on a jacket and tie, he complains to her
that they let her enter wearing just a housedress while he has
to be inconvenienced by the establishment's dress code.</P>
<P>   Brooks evokes a wonderful, Oscar-potential performance
from Helen Hunt, an archetypal working-class woman who will
remind TV viewers of Alice Kramden, as she juggles her life
from her modest Prospect Park, Brooklyn apartment to her job
as a server in a middle-class Manhattan restaurant.  She
leaves no question that she is eager for a hug and more but
cannot find a normal guy to be her boy friend, which does not
surprise her mother, who explains, "They don't exist."  
Fishing perpetually for compliments, even from the cynical
Melvin, she is almost continually wide-eyed, waiting for him to
complete his sentences, prompting him for the right words
which seem never to arrive.  Jack Nicholson's career is back
on track after his indifferent job in "Mars Attacks."  Nicholson
is once again the paradigmatic New Yorker, the sort who
does not suffer fools (or even wise folks) gladly--who swept
the table clear in his famous scene with Karen Black in "Five
Easy Pieces."  With the further support of Greg Kinnear, who
turns in a surprisingly agile performance as a hard-luck guy
who gets to know and even love the man who at first piqued
him, "As Good As It Gets" is a convincingly upbeat and
encouraging story of three unhappy and disparate people who
find one another and realize that life can be agreeable. Rated
PG-13.  Running Time: 130 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
