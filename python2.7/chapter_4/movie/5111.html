<PRE>                               MULHOLLAND FALLS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Just so you know, there are no waterfalls in Los Angeles.  The titular
MULHOLLAND FALLS refers to the smarmy practice of taking a criminal to the
high point of the mountainous Mulholland Drive and booting him off, only to
catch up with him sometime later at the bottom.</P>
<P>     MULHOLLAND FALLS is the preferred method of ridding 1950s L.A. of
unwanted baddies, and it is most often used by a foursome of elite cops:
Nick Nolte, Chazz Palminteri, Chris Penn, and Michael Madsen.  Their newest
mission:  to find the murderer of Allison (Jennifer Connelly), a girl whose
bizarre death leads the gang to a General (John Malkovich) at the Atomic
Energy Commission and his number one thug (Treat Williams).</P>
<P>     Could have been interesting, but it unfortunately isn't.  The main
problem appears to be substantial meddling with what likely started out as
a good script.  Instead, there are no surprises here at all.  The plot is
formulaic and leaves nothing to the imagination, and it moves at a snail's
pace.  Also, important expository scenes have been cut out to apparently
give more screen time to the many big-name stars paraded through the film.</P>
<P>     The most noticeable flaw in this regard is Melanie Griffith's
character, playing Nolte's estranged wife, whose role is a complete
throwaway but is used to try (and fails) to develop sympathy for her and
her poor hubby.  Almost as bad are Andrew McCarthy, as a stereotypical
homosexual informer, and Connelly, who we see only in flashbacks.  Note:
when we do see her, we are treated to generous portions of
surgically-enhanced cheesecake.</P>
<P>     Still, the movie has its moments.  The quartet is mostly entertaining
when they interact among themselves, particularly Nolte and Palminteri.
There are a number of nice lines of dialogue that really imbue the film
with a sense of the macabre.  And placing us against the backdrop of
nuclear testing is somewhat thought-provoking and interesting.  As well,
director Lee Tamahori, who last did ONCE WERE WARRIORS, is as capable here
as can be expected given a lackluster script.</P>
<P>     The bottom line is that MULHOLLAND FALLS runs in circles pretty
slowly.  You might expect a little more from an American film, but as
Nolte's character puts it, "This isn't America; this is L.A."</P>
