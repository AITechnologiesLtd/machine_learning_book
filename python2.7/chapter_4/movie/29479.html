<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>Robert Altman's first film is a forgettable 1950s teenager film about troubled
youths in  Middle America's suburbia (filmed in Kansas City, Mo., using real
police officers). It was shot semidocumentary style, with a sober voiceover
telling of the growing juvenile delinquency problem in the film's beginning and
ending on the note that it's up to the family, school, church groups. and other
responsible members of society to make sure their community is safeguarded
against the threat from unsupervised teens. </P>
<P>Tom Laughlin plays Scotty, an upper-class nice teenager who needlessly gets into
trouble because of over zealous parenting on the part of his girlfriend Janice
White's (Howard) parents and poor decision making on his part. Mr. White, an
authoritarian figure without the ability to listen to his daughter, decides that
his 16-year-old daughter is too young to be going steady and must stop seeing
Scotty until he returns from his Christmas college vacation next year. </P>
<P>The upset Scotty goes to a drive-in alone and gets mistaken for the one who
punctured the tires of a car full of teens. He's pounced on by them, but to his
rescue comes the gang that actually did do that. Scotty is grateful that gang
leader Cholly (Miller) acts friendly toward him and is appreciative that they
saved him from a real beating. But gang member Eddy (Bakalyan) recognizes that
Scotty is not like them and mouths off at him. This rumble was the only thing
that was remotely watchable in the film. </P>
<P>New trouble starts when Scotty agrees to go along with Cholly's bright idea that
he switch places with him and go out on a date with Janice. He will bring her to
Scotty after meeting her parents and after the date bring her home. But the plan
goes awry when the gang breaks into an abandoned house and throws a wild party
with liquor served to the teens. When Janice insists on leaving early with
Scotty, they avoid a police bust that comes later as all the gang members are
pulled into the police station. Eddy gets the gang to believe the cops came
because Scotty snitched on them, as the film deals with how the teens with
different values work out their problems. </P>
<P>It's amazing that a director like Altman, who was to go on and have a great
career in films, made such a feeble one here. The film might be of mild interest
to those who desire to see how suburban white teens socialized, dated, had
fights, and dealt with their parents back in the 1950s. ... The film didn't even
have good music to go with its teen story, and that includes Julia Lee singing
her rendition of "Dirty Rock Boogie." </P>
