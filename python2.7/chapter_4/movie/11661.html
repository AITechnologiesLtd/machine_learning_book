<P>"In this country you have to change quickly, and all the time;
otherwise people say, 'You already did that...Next!'. I want to reply
'Wait, wait...it seems like the same film, but it's not..."</P>
<PRE>-Martin Scorcese</PRE>
<P>The subject of the much anticipated, new Scorcese film, Kundun, is not
clear. This is not a liability. The most that can be said is that it
is a cinematic description of events surrounding the life of the 14th
Dalai Lama. Unlike, previous films by the director (Taxi Driver, Alice
Doesn't Live Here Anymore), however, anything beyond this description
is mere speculation. I was not sure what to make of Scorcese's last
film Casino (something more than Goodfellas but less than Raging
Bull). Kundun, unlike Casino, whos formal merits are undeniable but
that somehow never leaves the realm of conventional cinema, transcends
previous elements of Scorcese's style by using devices familiar to the
director in wholly new ways. The voiceover is only the most obvious
example which in this film is an accomplished and integrated layer of
the film as opposed to a crutch or support to an overburdened
narrative as it has been elsewhere in Scorcese's films. The director
has offered an unlikely film, to say the least, and one that is a
happy indication that he is not through astonishing us.</P>
<P>    The film has been faulted in various sources for its lack of
dramatic cohesion. That Kundun does not benefit from the deft plotting
and eerie characterization of a film like Taxi Driver is undeniable,
however, to cite this as a fault seems short-sighted. By his own
admission, there was little interest in approaching Kundun, along
classical lines; the dramaturgy of the film is particularly loose,
breaking from the narrative for long periods of time for the Dalai
Lama (the title character) to comtemplate and debate key decisions
with his advisors or for Scorcese to simply present moody montages.
Formally, Scorcese employs a number of motifs including shoes and
ancient art (the sand Mandala) layered with a nearly constant use of
music. The result is not the type of film we have come to expect but a
type of sound-poem instead. A film as concerned about conveying mood,
intention and meaning as it is with generating pace.</P>
<P>    The careful craftsmanship that has produced Kundun is evidenced by
the approach Scorcese took to the film. The very first translations of
the concept came not in the way of a conventional storyboard but
rather as loose sketches or visual ideas. The precise plot thrusts
were left deliberately, vague a the director focussed his preparatory
work on how best to convey mood through the visual construction of the
film as well as the cinematography. DOP Roger Deakins has credited
Scorcese with paying particular attention to how the his lighting
would serve as one of the key players in any scene. (There is an
excellent account of the circumstances surrounding the photography and
production of Kundun in the February issue of Americain
Cinematographer). That all this was achieved on a relatively low
budget is testimony to the team's technical mastery.</P>
<P>    It seems clear that this film is destined for a Western audience:
the actors all speak in english (albeit somewhat awkwardly) and
although, the cinematic merits in and of themselves are reason enough
to see Kundun, there is little, thematically, in the film that an
Eastern audience would not already be aquainted with.  This being the
case Scorcese's strategy seems particularly well chosen. In opposition
to the necessary perversions that come with this territory (not using
the mother tongue, etc..) the style of the film in terms of the
narrative strategy and formal arrangements employed remains true to
the culture being portrayed. The serene beauty and meditative tone of
Kundun are a more responsible treatment of Eastern themes than, for
instance Schindler's List is of Germany during WWII. In other words by
confronting the viewer with a film that falls outside the realm of
conventional cinema Scorcese compenstaes in some ways for other
necessary distortions. The result is both more legitimate and
responsible than a film like Schindler's List that attempts to cloak
its deceptions in more duplicity; the equivocal, lowest comon
denominator, button pushing, that is the Hollywood continuity style.</P>
<P>    As usual, the fact that great films such as this receive only a
pitiful release here in Ottawa must be opined. In fact if I am not
mistaken Kundun's first-run here in the capital lasted 2 weeks and
consisted of one screen at the Capitol Square cinema (one of the
marginally better venues we have). It is both depressing and
surprising that this was the case since it is largely a reflection of
popular tastes. It is a shame that even Scorcese's stature was not
enough to keep the film around.</P>
