<PRE>‘A PRESENT-DAY SAVIOR'</PRE>
<P>On Martin Scorsese's ‘Bringing Out the Dead'
USA, 1999, 188 min. 
Direction: Martin Scorsese
With: Nicolas Cage, Patricia Arquette, John Goodman, Ving Rhames, Tom
Sizemore, Marc Anthony (I)</P>
<P>With  ‘Bringing Out the Dead', Martin Scorsese returns to his native
city New York once again.  The movie features Frank Pierce (Nicolas
Cage), a paramedic working in Gotham's Hell's Kitchen.  "Saving a
life," Frank tells us, "is like falling in love." But Frank has not
saved a life for months. Instead, his waking dreams are haunted by the
image of Rose, a young woman who died while under his care.  When he
finally does succeed in saving the life of a heart patient, the man
needs to be kept alive through repeated shocks with the defibrillator.
With each shock, however, his daughter, Mary (played by Cage's wife
Patricia Arquette) freaks out. To Frank, it is a dilemma representing
many others.  Accompanied by the dead Rose and the living Mary, he
embarks on a three day journey closely reminiscent of Louis-Ferdinand
Céline's novel ‘Journey to the End of the Night', brimming with
dreams, horrors, jokes, hallucinations and revelations.</P>
<P>Core
Hosting such early films as ‘Mean Streets' (1973) and ‘Taxi Driver'
(1976), the city of New York has been a major influence on Scorsese's
movie-making career, as it continues to be with next year's staging of
‘Gangs of New York' (starring Leonardo DiCaprio). Outside this
autobiographical core, Scorsese's body of work becomes as vastly
versatile as that of Stanley Kubrick, who seems to have lacked such a
core altogether.  But watching ‘Eyes Wide Shut', who would not wish
Scorsese had taken charge of those nightly New York scenes?
Scorsese's empathic understanding of New York is unsurpassed by any
other film maker (with the exception, perhaps, of the incomparable
Woody Allen).  His crack-dealers and hookers, graffiti and garbage are
not the stage props that we are used to seeing in any old action flick
or police show.  In Scorsese's films, they represent a grim and
inescapable reality.  No one can make you feel unsafe in your seat the
way he can.  Scorsese knows at exactly what moment you should cross a
New York street when you see someone coming your way you don't fully
trust.
Of course, a neighborhood like Hell's Kitchen provides the perfect
setting for Scorsese's appropriated Catholic themes of sin, conscience
and redemption.  Frank's co-workers can hardly be distinguished from
the world in which they are taking charge.  Indeed, their indifference
and cynicism serve as a lubricant to make life 'easy'.  In the case of
Ving Rhames' character, the cynicism even transforms into an elated,
but superficial and campy religious posture.  Frank, by contrast, has
not yet resigned himself to a life that would have the better of him.
While he is not too rigid to not mingle with characters of suspicious
reputation, he refuses to have the world decide on him that easy.  It
is a trait that brings him on the verge of physical and mental
devastation, and it seems to be Scorsese's message that one can only
hold on to oneself under compromising circumstances if one is prepared
to make an effort.</P>
<P>Catharsis
However, an effort can be made in different ways.  Over the years,
Scorsese has increasingly shifted the emphasis from an outer to an
inner arena.  In ‘Taxi driver', that archetypical movie, Travis Bickle
(De Niro) sought redemption by confronting the visible world; the
young hooker played by Jodie Foster served merely as a welcome
focusing point for Travis' sense of righteousness, never as the object
of any genuine interest.  In ‘Bringing Out the Dead', written by Paul
Schrader (who also signed for Scorsese's ‘The last temptation of
Christ', ‘Raging Bull' and ‘Casino') this detour is no longer
followed.  Rather, Frank Pierce goes through an inner catharsis, one
that does involve Mary up to a point, but without ever turning into a
love affair, for which neither of them seem to find the time or the
space.  Perhaps their relationship can best be described as an
anti-romance.
To illustrate, Scorsese provided his movie with plenty of Catholic
symbolism.  Starting with the cross on the filmposter - in which the
international Red Cross should not be overlooked - there is the
hospital's name of St Mary's, Patricia Arquette's character's name is
Mary, there are hands that are repeatedly being washed and, to top
everything, there is a man whose side is being pierced.  But the true
modern-day Savior is none other than Frank himself, who not only heals
the sick but also saves souls, as is shown in a dream sequence that
expresses the title of the movie quite explicitly.</P>
<P>Dramatic
With his characters portraying principles rather than themselves,
Scorsese seems to be more interested in themes than in people.  Of
course, the script does not owe its dramatic power to any moral
content, but, rather, to the transformation that this moral conflict
brings about in Frank and Mary.  There is no guarantee as to the
outcome of their purification process, just the certainty that they
have no choice but to go on.  "You promised to fire me," Frank yells
out to his employer, half in jest, half in despair.  "I'll fire you
tomorrow, I promise," the man answers.  In Hell's Kitchen, he doesn't
have much of a choice either.
Although all the ingredients seem to be present, ‘Bringing Out the
Dead' is not as frightening as ‘Taxi Driver' or ‘Cape Fear', nor is it
as violent as ‘Goodfellas' or ‘Casino'.  Fans of those features may be
disappointed by ‘Bringing Out the Dead' and they may say that Scorsese
has begun to repeat himself.  That is hardly the case.  ‘Bringing Out
the Dead' simply comprises another step in a development of which the
end is not yet in sight.  Already, Scorsese's mastery has reached
beyond the mere exotic, be it in form (‘After Hours') or content
(‘Kundun').   It has made him examine and question the validity of
moral values (particularly in ‘Cape Fear' and ‘The Last temptation of
Christ'). By using his art as a means of formulating questions, rather
than using ‘answers' to make some kind of ‘art', his importance as a
film director exceeds the realm of the strictly artistic.  His films
contribute to a more sophisticated understanding of this world in
general.  In that sense, ‘Bringing Out the Dead' can be thought of as
a homecoming after a journey that simply could not leave his own New
York untouched.
Besides, the true Scorsese fan still has a lot of good stuff to enjoy.
It must not have been easy to come up with visual solutions within the
limits of an ambulance, but no one knows better how to charge his
shots with meaning and emotional power than this master of
cinematography.  Nicolas Cage, without being superficial, may not have
the power of expression that Robert de Niro has, but his held-back,
serious and seemingly unmoved style of acting fits Franks introvert
personality perfectly.
Finally, the movie's soundtrack brings forth an aspect of movie-making
that usually remains underexposed.  Scorsese, now 57, knows the
repertoire: he plays old and new rockmusic, thus passing the
atmosphere of the hybrid '90s accurately on to the movie.  Meanwhile,
the raw voices of the various performers perfectly express Franks
attempts to elicit something humane from a world that has gone adrift
around him.</P>
