<P>        I've heard a lot of complaints about Starship Troopers in the 4
days since it's been open: "it's too violent!", or "the characters
suck!" or "the action scenes are non-stop". Well, not to point out the
obvious, folks, but THAT'S NOT THE FRIGGIN' POINT OF THE MOVIE!
        First of all, Starship Troopers IS the most violent main-stream
movie I've ever seen, about 10 times the scale of Braveheart. Seriously.
The director, Paul Verhoeven(Robocop, Total Recall) who's already known
for his willingness to show graphic images, completely lets himself
loose here. I want get into the gory details, but let me just say this:
I truly believe that the reason there's so little profanity in this
movie is so they could squeak by the MPAA with an R rating, instead of
the dreaded NC-17.
        But that's beside the point. Basically, the movie, like most good
sci-fi movies, is set in the future(did that make any sense?). The hero,
Rico(Van Dien) just recently graduated from high school. He joins, both
in an attempt to impress his girlfriend AND to gain citizenship(I'll
explain later) the Federation Army.
        Back to that citizenship part: the earth, or even the universe, for all
we know(that's one thing I like about this movie: it doesn't have a
"dummy history" at the beginning that scrolls down and gives you a
complete history of the movie. You kind of have to figure things out for
youself) is comprised of the Federation(yeah, yeah I know it's a trek
rip-off.) You can either be a civilian, without advanced priveliges like
being able to give birth to children, or you can become a citizen by
touring with the armed forces for a couple of years. Rico desires to
become a citizen, mainly because of the influence of a high school
teacher. Lucky for the plot of this movie, he joins just as the "Bug
War" breaks out.
        "Bug War?", you ask. Let me explain: in a planet not too far from here,
named Klandathu, there live various types of "bugs", albiet really big,
really mean bugs, that keep launching meteors at earth. One hits,
conviently killing Rico's parents, and earth, of course, declares war on
the bugs.
        Here's where the fun begins: Rico slowly rises through the ranks,
accompanied by his friends Diz(Meyer) and whoever Neil Patrick Harris
plays. I can't remember the dude's name. He also slowly loses touch of
his girlfriend, who's a pilot in the service, to a cocky pilot named,
uh, something-or-other, played by Patrick Mulroon.
        The infantry, with Rico and Diz, lands on the bug planet. They fight
the bugs, mainly the swords-for-limbs arachnids, with machine guns.
These aren't really too effective on the bugs. Which brings me too a
point: in the future, if they can launch handheld nukes from
bazookas(which they do numerous times in this movie), then why can't
they just drop a big nuke on the bug planet? Of course, the answer's too
simple: that would eliminate the cool fight scenes.
        Which brings me to the fight scenes: technically speaking, they're huge
accomplishments for Verhoeven and his team.  The bugs are visually
stunning(even if you can't tell where their faces are), and the blood
and guts fly convincingly as well. Of course, if you're squeamish,
you'll hate these scenes completely. Let's just say I have a very strong
stomach concerning movie violence, and even I gulped a little when an
arachinid bit a man in half and the bottom half flopped down on Rico.
Eww.
        To wind things down(I think this is the longest review I've ever
written), let me just say this about Starship Troopers: it's a witty,
somewhat forgettable, high budget b-movie.  The witty part comes from
Verhoeven's very sick sense of humor indulged in these sort of
"newsreel, propaganda pieces" the federation uses to recruit new
members. These shorts, very remniscient of the 40's and 50's same-type
thing, are hilaroius. Even if that "Would You Like to Know More?" thing
gets annoying after a while(it doesn't always tell you more. Maybe I
wanted to know more, dangit!)
        So what's the bottom line skinny on Starship Troopers: if you liked
Robocop, Total Recall, or just action and sci-fi films in general, this
is definitely the best film of that type this year(much better than The
Fifth Element".) If you're a little squeamish, or pregnant, then stay
away. Or if you're just stuck in the middle, trying to find an
alternative to "Bean" or "The Devil's Advocate"(God knows, who isn't?)
then check this one out, for sure!</P>
