<P>   We all know people like the lead characters in Terry Zwigoff's
"Ghost World," based on an underground comic strip by co-
scripter Daniel Clowes.  They are people who are so judgmental
that they look down on the rest of the world, considering all others
to be dorks.  Generally these types are pretty dorky themselves,
and they tend also to be unhappy folks whether extroverted or
otherwise, covering up their feelings of inadequacy by their cynical
demeanor.  "Ghost World" describes a relationship between two
such people, the outgoing, fun-loving Enid (Thora Birch) and her
more withdrawn and also more attractive best pal Rebecca
(Scarlett Johansson--who at the age of 15 is playing someone
three years her senior).  Enid and Rebecca are at a crossroads in
their lives having just graduated from high school. Will  their
friendship slip away as, regrettably, so many harmonious
connections do at this point?  Since neither young woman is
going to college and the two even plan to share an apartment, the
odds are that their close affiliation will be unaffected. And yet...</P>
<P>   "Ghost World" is about the "and yet," about how events
conspire to change their fellowship and lead Enid into quirky new
affiliations that help her to find out who she is.  Zwigoff opens the
story at a graduation from a high school in a small-to-medium
sized town.  Enid discovers that she must attend summer school
to make up an art class that she did not pass, a circumstance that
sees her predictably rolling her eyes and turning down her
brightly-painted lips in at least mock disgust.  To brighten what
looks like an otherwise dull season, Enid coaxes Rebecca into
another bout in her favorite game: humiliating people she
considers beneath her, and sets her sights on an ad she finds in
the personals.  Pretending to be the woman that the ad placer
had once almost met and now seeks, she induces the middle-
aged man to meet his alleged date in a restaurant, only to watch
him suffer as his intended does not show.</P>
<P>   The story, written by comic strip writer Daniel Clowes and the
director, puts us into the world of these two 18-year-olds, allowing
us to eavesdrop on a series of events, some humorous, others
poignant, still others a combination of the two.  While Enid takes
her art class with a New-Age instructor, Roberta (Illeana Douglas),
who encourages the kids to express themselves, she winds up in
a relationship with the "loser" whom she humiliated days earlier,
Seymour (Steve Buscemi), who turns out to be a quiet collector of
78 rpm records and knows a lot about jazz from the '20's on.  She
acts as his dating service, fixing him up with an attractive and
willing woman, even forcing Seymour to realize that she likes the
bespectacled 18-year-old more than the woman he had once
speculated was made for him.</P>
<P>   The film is brimming with shtick, a particularly incisive one
occurring in a movie theater with Enid working the concession
stand, losing her job within hours because she is brutally honest
with the customers.  </P>
<P>   The title of the movie comes from graffiti that Daniel Clowes
once saw on the wall in a bad Chicago neighborhood--which got
the scripter to think that the America of today is undergoing a
steady change for the worse, as malls and fast-food chains take
away a sense of neighborhood; and to the characters themselves
who are about to lose their friendships.</P>
<P>   There are marvelous performances in this toned-down film, 
different from the usual summer teen fare, with Bob Balaban
playing the laissez-faire single dad whose rekindled alliance with
his ex-wife Maxine (Teri Garr) puts additional pressure on Enid's
current living arrangements and by Illeana Douglas as the kind of
art teacher we wish we had in high school.  Lenser Affonso Beato
wisely keeps his camera pretty steady throughout avoiding the
quick editing and panoramic views that cause audiences to reach
for the dramamine.  The end, slightly surreal, is a magical
moment, giving the viewers some insight into a major decision
which Enid is forced to make.</P>
