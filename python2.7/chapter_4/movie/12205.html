The Elephant Man
Directed by David Lynch</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Chris Loar</PRE>
<P>As David Lynch's first commercially viable film, THE ELEPHANT MAN is an   
odd -- but nearly perfect -- blend of the conventional and the   
idiosyncratic.  What's remarkable about it is that, despite its   
mainstream appeal, it's still emphatically a film by David Lynch; it   
jettisons all of the mawkish sentimentality that might well have burdened   
a film about the travails of John Merrick, Victorian England's Elephant   
Man, and replaces it with a complicated meditation on voyeurism and   
ethics.  To my mind, this is one of Lynch's most successful films; the   
discipline of adhering to a conventional storyline makes his style here   
less solipsistic and self-indulgent than it has sometimes been elsewhere;   
and the credible characters of Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) and   
John Merrick (William Hurt) make the picture more emotionally involving   
than, say, WILD AT HEART.</P>
<P>The film tells the tale of the unfortunate John Merrick, an Englishman   
afflicted with a rare congenital deformity; he has a profoundly misshapen   
skull, and most of his body is covered with fleshy growths and tumors.   
 He's on exhibit in a sideshow when he is rescued by Dr. Treves, who   
reacts to him with a mixture of pity and fascination.  And because that   
pity is tainted, the rescue itself is somewhat ambiguous; Dr. Treves   
initially assumes Merrick to be an imbecile, and puts him on display for   
his colleagues.  Later, as Merrick begins to open up to his new   
caretaker, the two begin to develop a friendship, and Treves begins to   
introduce his friend to members of polite society.  But that friendship   
and those introductions are also, arguably, tainted; as Merrick begins to   
enter polite society, he does so as a spectacle and a curiosity rather   
than as an active member of society.  Or so Lynch seems to argue.  What I   
admire most about this film is its refusal of easy sentimentality; there   
is no triumph here for Merrick.  Even in one of the final sequences, when   
Merrick attends the theater and, for the first time, is a spectator   
rather than a spectacle, there is no victory -- for immediately after the   
performance, the audience turns and looks to him, and it's HE that   
receives the standing ovation.  For a child of the carnival, there is no   
easy escape from the freakshow.</P>
<P>All this might not have worked were it not for some fine acting,   
including some first-rate work by Hopkins and Hurt.  Hurt, in particular,   
is excellent, even under what must have been fifteen pounds of prosthetic   
makeup; his dialogue shows a perfect sense of timing, and his body   
manages to convey debility mixed with a blend of self-hatred and pride.   
 Hopkins is nicely modulated as the morally confused doctor.  And there   
are some fine secondary parts; the virtually unknown Michael Elphick is   
particularly good as a night porter who profits by humiliating Merrick.</P>
<P>The film is also a technical marvel.  It's shot beautifully in black and   
white by Freddie Francis (a onetime director of horror films; he went on   
to win an Oscar for his work on GLORY), and Lynch's more expressionist   
tendencies are blended nicely with a relatively conventional visual   
style.  The soundtrack, too, makes excellent use of Lynch's trademark   
sound effects; hisses, clanks, and other sound effects blend with the   
dialogue to give the production a rather eerie effect.</P>
<P>Lynch's work since ELEPHANT MAN has increasingly veered back towards the   
arty self-indulgence of ERASERHEAD -- which isn't altogether a bad thing,   
and has resulted in some spectacular films.  (Indeed, some, such as BLUE   
VELVET, are clearly superior to ELEPHANT MAN.)  But this film -- by   
demonstrating that unconventional filmmaking can find a home in the   
bottom-line world of Hollywood melodrama -- is in some ways his most   
important achievement.</P>
