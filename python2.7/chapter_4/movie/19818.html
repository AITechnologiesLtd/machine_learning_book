<PRE>Iron Giant, The (1999)
A film review by Steve Lipson</PRE>
<P>Upon reading the poster tagline for "The Iron Giant," the latest animated 
feature from Warner Brothers, one may be forgiven for assuming that the 
movie is intended strictly for children. After all, what more should one 
expect from a movie that attempts to grab audiences' attention with such a 
sensationalistic headline as "It came from outer space!" Only upon watching 
this highly-accomplished film does one realize how unfair to Brad Bird's 
debut picture this tagline really is; I was even reminded of the injustice 
done to "Citizen Kane" by its similarly-worded slogan: "It's terrific!"</P>
<P>While I do not mean to put "The Iron Giant" in the same league as Orson 
Welles's classic, I nevertheless feel that the advertising campaign for 
Bird's film trivializes its serious intentions. For "The Iron Giant," though 
vastly entertaining for anyone in the audience, possesses themes and lessons 
as meaningful for adults as they are for children. The depth of the movie 
should come as no surprise given the film's pedigree: it is based on the 
book "The Iron Man" by the late British poet laureate Ted Hughes. And as is 
to be expected from such auspicious beginnings, the great strength of the 
film lies in its story.</P>
<P>Admittedly, the basic plot of "The Iron Giant" sounds simple enough: In 
1957, at the height of the competition between the Americans and the Soviets 
in the Cold War, a meteorite crashes in the ocean near the quiet Maine town 
of Rockwell. Some locals speculate that the debris came from the Russian 
satellite Sputnik, but what actually fell to Earth was a 100-foot tall alien 
robot. The adventurous local boy Hogarth Hughes (voice of Eli Marienthal) 
discovers the giant in the woods, saving his life in the process. The two 
overcome the language barrier to become friends, although this period of 
bonding is made more difficult by the need to find metal to feed the Iron 
Giant (Vin Diesel)  and the desire of Hogarth to keep his large new friend 
secret from his mother Annie (Jennifer Aniston). More ominously, Hogarth 
soon discovers that he must hide the robot from Kent Mansley (Christopher 
McDonald), a government agent sent to Rockwell to investigate the crash of 
the meteorite and the mysterious sightings by townspeople. To ward off any 
possible threats to the security of the United States, Kent has the entire 
arsenal of the U.S. Armed Forces at his disposal. Hogarth's only ally in his 
efforts to save the Iron Giant from imminent destruction is the beatnik 
artist Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick, Jr.), who reluctantly allows the robot 
to hide out on his property.</P>
<P>At first, this plot outline with its youthful hero and dastardly villain 
may seem like it resembles the descriptions of countless other animated 
films released over the years. But what distinguished "The Iron Giant" from 
other fare are the serious issues raised and stressed in the screenplay. 
Brad Bird and Tim McCanlies, who adapted Ted Hughes's book for the screen, 
wisely chose not to update the story to modern times. Keeping it in 1957 
allows them to explore the ramifications that these incidents in Maine would 
have on a country and a people frightened by the Cold War. In the process, 
"The Iron Giant" delves into themes still highly relevant to today's times: 
the danger of guns, the folly of nuclear war, the difficulties of 
communicating across cultures. And the great achievement of this film lies 
in its ability to make these issues meaningful to people of all ages. On the 
topic of nuclear war, adults will find themselves uneasily laughing at a 
recreation/ parody of those "Duck and Cover" videos of the 1950's that 
explain how to survive a nuclear attack; children will be struck by a line 
during the climax that succinctly encapsulates the utter destructiveness of 
nuclear weapons and how not even the people that launch them are spared. And 
the movie does not pull punches, either, at another problem as pressing 
today as it was in 1957: xenophobia. Kent and many others in the movie feel 
that anything alien is dangerous and must be destroyed; this fear of 
foreigners extends not just to extraterrestrial beings, but to foreigners on 
our own planet. Like most of the other important issues raised in "The Iron 
Giant," Bird does not treat this point in a heavy-handed manner; in fact, 
Kent most explicitly reveals his xenophobia in a line as humorous as it is 
ominous.</P>
<P>This sense of humor is a facet of the film that should not be neglected. In 
addition to being very effective in its action and dramatic scenes, "The 
Iron Giant" is a very funny movie. Comic highlights of the film include 
Hogarth's efforts to hide the robot from his mother, especially as he tries 
to say "Grace" at dinner, and the attempt of the Iron Giant to imitate his 
friend doing one of his favorite summertime activities. Never does Bird 
allow the important messages of his film to undermine its basic 
entertainment value.</P>
<P>"The Iron Giant" delivers what audiences have come to expect from most good 
animated features this side of "South Park": a story that captivates both 
children and adults. The term "animation" has unfortunately come to pick up 
negative connotation in some quarters, from people who deride animated 
features as kiddie cartoons. But Hughes's book virtually cried out for 
animated treatment. By filming the movie in such a way, Bird avoided the 
pitfall that plagues so many summer movies: having the special effects 
overwhelm the story and characters. Instead of directing a movie that 
basically forces the audience to marvel at the latest advances in 
computer-generated imagery, Bird has created a film in which the marvel of a 
100-foot robot walking on Earth can be experienced, but then the audience 
moves on, to focus on the relationship between Hogarth and the Iron Giant 
and the issues that the screenplay explores. And it cannot be denied that 
the use of animation allows for some undeniably impressive effects, as in a 
neat scene where the robot reassembles himself after being separated into 
pieces. But never do such images seem as if they are inserted for their own 
sake, rather than to further the story.</P>
<P>Brad Bird, formerly a director for the television show "The Simpsons," has 
fashioned a movie that combines the best aspects of both animated and 
non-animated features. In fact, Bird's film, aside from its screenplay, 
possesses artistic merits that rival those of most any motion picture. 
Admittedly, the animation in "The Iron Giant," while quite good, is not up 
to Disney standards. But Bird compensates for this minor flaw by a mastery 
of the visual and story-telling techniques universal to success in the 
medium of film. His use of light and shadow in particular stood out for me. 
Throughout the movie, one observes impressive lighting effects that add to 
the mood of a scene: the mother's angry look emphasized in the car 
headlights she stands in front of, a flashlight beam swooping through the 
dark, hazy patches of light filtering through the trees in a mysterious and 
idyllic forest setting. Later, in the Hughes house, the menace represented 
by Kent Mansley is rendered very clear as he emerges from the dark to 
confront Hogarth in his room. Seeing the very sharp contrast between light 
and shadow on Kent's face made me think nostalgically back to black and 
white film-making, when such high-definition lighting effects could be 
created with ease and effectiveness. But color animation can create such 
ominous scenes at times when their live-action counterparts cannot.</P>
<P>With his use of sound, too, Bird demonstrates an awareness of the lessons 
learned from non-animated settings. In the typical Disney animated movie, 
one's enjoyment of the film is often marred if one does not like the songs 
in it. But "The Iron Giant" is no musical; like most live-action films, the 
songs  are played in the background of the action. And Bird even improves on 
the way most directors employ their soundtracks. Too often in non-animated 
features, the director adds a popular song as filler or as a transition 
between scenes. Bird does not fall into this trap; in one notable scene, for 
example, Kent's investigation into the mystery of the robot does not stop 
though a song that is not part of the action is playing. The audience still 
understands what is going on and we still laugh; the movie continues 
unimpeded despite relying for its effect on silent comedy and drama. By 
merging the freedom and creative potential of animation with the time-tested 
techniques of live-action film story-telling, Bird has fashioned a truly 
memorable picture.</P>
<P>Perhaps best of all, one's satisfaction with "The Iron Giant" is not 
hampered by a disappointing conclusion. The film ends as it should: somber 
enough so as not to trivialize the important issues it raises, yet happy 
enough to please children. And after the end credits roll, the movie leaves 
one with a lot to think about and talk over with one's family. "The Iron 
Giant" leaves unresolved such issues as the robot's origin and purpose, and 
the religious intentions of the film. At first, I considered such ambiguity 
to be one of the few weaknesses of the film. But upon further reflection, I 
realized that leaving us with such uncertainty may have been just Bird and 
McCanlies's intention. The movie raises a lot of points for discussion in 
which the film-makers' message is clear, as in their attitude to nuclear 
war. But many questions remain open for us to come to our own conclusions: 
If extraterrestrials exist, why might they want to visit Earth? Does the 
Iron Giant (as a sentient robot) have a soul? In the end, "The Iron Giant" 
is a thought-provoking motion picture that provides solid entertainment for 
all ages; perhaps this is the highest compliment one can give to a family 
film (or any movie for that matter). But I cannot resist one more 
commendation. Because I was not pleased with the original advertising slogan 
for the film, I have come up with my own tagline: "It's terrific!"</P>
