 Cast: Stephen Blackehart, Jackie Chan, Philip Baker Hall,

Mark Rolston, Christ Tucker, Tom Wilkinson</P>
<P>   In the ecumenical spirit, police dramas traditionally pair up a
black cop and a white cop, a match best exploited in the
"Lethal Weapon" series.  In scripters Jim Kouf and Ross
LaManna's take on the pairing of distinct ethnicities
and personalities, Jackie Chan is braced with Chris Tucker. 
As Lee and Carter, two such talents could not be more
disparate.  Per the usual formula, the duo rub each other the
wrong way at first and gradually come to depend on each
other and to share a genuine measure of affection.  To
director Brett Ratner's credit, their growing affection is
believable.  No matter that Lee (Jackie Chan) is modest and
altruistic while Carter (Chris Tucker) is egocentric and motor-
mouthed.  Each prefers working alone to operating with a
partner. Their very differences open both up to new
experiences that enrich their lives.  Lee, who is from Hong
Kong, will teach his reluctant partner something about
Chinese food and martial arts; in return, Carter will have Lee
speaking about his crib and his Hong Kong hood and singing rap with
abandon.  </P>
<P>   Nothing is less than lighthearted in this otherwise routine
action film which features moderately witty dialogue, a
hurricane of bullets, some nifty explosions, and super stunts
which are noteworthy particularly because Jackie Chan 
continues to do his own at the age of 44.  "Rush Hour" shows
how Lee and Carter get into each other's hair, irritate the FBI
and the LAPD, and rankle bad guys Juntao and a British
collector, Griffin (Tom Wilkinson).  </P>
<P>   The story begins in Hong Kong in the days before the
British bow out of their crown colony.  Detective Lee
singlehandedly crushes a smuggling operation but the leaders
successfully run to the United States where they abduct the
daughter of the Chinese consul in Los Angeles.  Consul Han
(Tzi Ma), a wealthy individual who is debating whether to
meet the kidnappers' demand for a cool $50 million, wants his
family friend, Detective Lee, to pursue the case.  The FBI and
the LAPD have other plans.  To distract Lee, they commission
screw-up cop James Carter to be his partner, in effect, to 
keep Lee out of the investigation.  Seething under this
boondoggle, Carter nonetheless takes on the chore while Lee
does what he can to get away from his unwanted tour guide.</P>
<P>   While Chris Tucker cannot match his best role--as a fugitive
and hustler in Brett Ratner's "Money Talks"--he is reliably
comical while delivering an endless stream of patter that
would delight operetta lyricist W.S. Gilbert.  Even
when speaking slowly he can evoke laughs from the
audience, as when he meets Lee and loudly and carefully
asks him whether Lee speaks English:
"Do...you...know...what...I'm...saying...?" he implores, his huge,
expressive eyes flashing with incomprehension.  This movie,
though, belongs to Jackie Chan, who has just published an
autobiography "I am Jackie Chan" in English, surely not the
language in which he is most at home.  In a Harold Lloyd-
style stunt on a double-decker tour bus which he is compelled
to take under Carter's watchful gaze, he suddenly leaps up
and holds onto a "to Hollywood" directional sign overhead,
somersaults into a city bus and dances his way into a taxi in a
series of gestures that would impress Martha Graham.  When
he attacks the gangsters in the pool hall using the cue as a
weapon and his powerful legs as a missile, his actions look
more authentic than all those phony martial arts movies that
rely on the eyes of the editors more than on the appendages
of the heroes.  The high point of Chan's acrobatics occurs
near the conclusion as he loses his grip on a beam in a
conventional hall atrium while his partner saves his life by
extending a silk streamer to break the fall.</P>
<P>   There will always be martial arts movies.  "Rush Hour"
signals this by underscoring the role of eleven-year-old Soo
Yung (Julia Hsu) as the consul's daughter and prize student
of detective Lee, who during captivity is anything but passive. 
Though she fails to gouge out eyes as her master has taught
her to do, she is a persuasive young woman who pulls her
weight in making "Rush Hour" as whimsical as it is routine. </P>
<P>   As with other Jackie Chan movies one of the best parts is
the outtakes which play along with the final credits in which
the lead actors deprecatingly show the audience the
bloopers--the missed stunts, the failed dialogue.  When Chris
Tucker fails in his intial efforts to say sheh-sheh (thank you) to
the hostess from his first-class seat on a United Airlines flight,
you've got to appreciate Mr. Chan's surprising skill with the
English language, which he tackles with the dexterity of a
seventh-degree black belt.  But then, Jackie did not come by
his abilities easily.  As a kid he spent ten years in physically
demanding and abusive training for the Peking Opera, which
included mime, acrobatics, and martial arts, after which he got
work as a child actor in more than twenty films.  With that sort
of history, he should be doing his high kicks well into his
sixties.  Let's hope so.</P>
