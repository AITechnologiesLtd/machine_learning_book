<P>I am a fan of the original Austin Powers, and I'm also a fan of Mike
Myers.  I don't know much about him, but he seems like a really
down-to-earth guy, one of those comedians who doesn't find it necessary
to make a fool of himself every time he appears before a live studio
audience.  I'm glad to see that he's finally found his crowd-pleasing
niche; though most of his films have found their audiences on video,
Austin Powers:  The Spy Who Shagged Me is likely to be the first massive
box office success of Myers' career (with the exception of Wayne's
World, which doesn't count for various reasons).  </P>
<P>I liked AP2, but not as much as I liked the original.  My reasons for
this should not come as a surprise:  too many elements are rehashed or
expanded from the first film, there are sizeable gaps in the laugh-flow,
and there is way too much toilet humor.  The story is goofy and dopey
enough to carry itself through the slow sections, and so I never found
myself completely bored.  There are also some brilliant casting choices,
a few truly hilarious subplots, and the gleeful use of sexual vulgarity
and phallic symbols.  I recommend the film, but I miss the
excrement-free environment and hokey originality of the first movie. </P>
<P>However, I think I like the story behind this one better.  It has a
kind of insane genius about it that makes it entertaining even when
there aren't many laughs.  Myers also does the right thing by giving Dr.
Evil what seems like more screen time than Austin himself.  (That also
makes me wonder if the series shouldn't be named after the villain.) 
The basic structure revolves around Dr. Evil -- he goes back in time to
steal Austin's mojo.  After drinking the mojo, Dr. Evil becomes much
more hip, and even has a one night stand with Frau Farbissina (Mindy
Sterling).  Austin, meanwhile, works to recover his mojo with the help
of Felicity Shagwell (the luminous Heather Graham, looking happy to be
in an Austin Powers movie).  Little does he know that Dr. Evil has new
evil cohorts:  Fat Bastard (an unrecognizable Myers in an enormous
prosthetic suit), and Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), a robot version of Dr.
Evil, one-eighth his size.</P>
<P>AP2 is a rare example of a comedy that uses subplots in the right way. 
Just before things get dull, the scene switches to any one of the three
or four subplots, and audience interest in the film is held through the
end.  The best subplot is certainly the relationship between Dr. Evil
and Mini-Me; Troyer is absolutely wonderful as the mute little monster,
and Dr. Evil's love for his diminutive pet is actually kind of touching
in a sarcastic sort of way.  This also adds a new dimension to Dr.
Evil's biological son, Scott Evil (Seth Green).  Green is a very funny
young actor, and the rivalry between him and Mini-Me is quite
effective.  Mindy Sterling, reprising her role from the first film as
the crazy German lady, thankfully is given more screen time here.  And
Rob Lowe does a perfect imitation of Robert Wager, playing the young
version of Number Two.  </P>
<P>There's no doubt that AP2 shines in several scenes with inspired
brilliance.  The two best sequences really can't be described in words,
but those who have seen the film will remember the way various people
all over the world describe Dr. Evil's phallic space ship as it blasts
off.  And Myers' love for these characters and this series keeps the
film from ever feeling perfunctory or dull.  But some scenes go way too
far:  everything with Fat Bastard, for instance, is not funny, and
simply disgusting (laughing and cringing are two separate reactions
altogether).  </P>
<P>I had the distinct sense of deja vu all through AP2, as if Myers had
been afraid to explore new territory.  I can't say I blame him; it would
have been a mistake to seriously change the look and feel of this
sequel.  But it lacks the discovery and newness of the first film, and
so it comes off almost as outtakes from the original, rather than a new
movie altogether.  Don't get me wrong:  Myers has made a funny picture. 
And, seeing as how a third installment in this series is inevitable, I
have high hopes that Myers will find an all new angle on his series and
exploit it into oblivion.</P>
