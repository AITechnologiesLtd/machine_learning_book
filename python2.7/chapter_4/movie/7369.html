                    A film review by David Landers
                     Copyright 1997 David Landers</PRE>

<P>THE GRADUATE, a terrific movie that paved the way for the careers of
Dustin Hoffman and Mike Nichols, whose only previous directorial
experience was in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRIGINA WOOLF?, will long be remembered
in the years to come.  THE GRADUATE follows the events of recent
college-grad Benjamin Braddock, a young man who is "concerned about his
future", as one of the original theatrical posters put it.  </P>
<P>Benjamin is the son of a businessman, and, when he returns home from
college, he finds himself becoming involved with the wife of his father's
business partner - Mrs. Robinson.  You know, "And here's to you Mrs.
Robinson . . . ".  After a short series of flings with her, Benjamin finds
himself wondering what he is doing.  His parents want him to take out
Elaine Robinson, the daughter of Mrs. Robinson.  Benjamin doesn't think
that she likes him very much, and Mrs. Robinson forbids him to take her
out.  He does anyway, in an attempt to steer her away.  His means for
doing this are driving erratically, walking ahead of her throughout the
date, and taking her to a type of strip-show where he displays more
interest in the performers than her.  His plan works well, but he finds
himself feeling sorry for her and decides to pursue her more.  After
attempting to put Mrs. Robinson out of the picture, Benjamin concentrates
fully on Elaine.  But Mrs. Robinson is determined to put an end to it, and
the events that follow are a great piece of work involving Benjamin trying
to avoid Mrs. Robinson and to regain Elaine Robinson.  Eventually,
Benjamin learns that Elaine is to be married to another man, and he
decides it is upon himself to rescue her.</P>
<P>THE GRADUATE is a very memorable movie with many unforgettable scenes, and
Dustin Hoffman's performance is extremely good.  Definitely a must-see
movie.  You'll need to see it in order to understand all the references to
the "Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me . . ." line.</P>
