<P>   I was born too early.  The more I see pictures about the fun
that 19-year-olds are having these days, the more I regret that
the Ayatollah Khomeni was the dean of men at my college and
Taliban regularly enforced the curfew on the women's campus. 
"American Pie 2" does show that some hearts get broken; for
example, one young woman insists that she and her ex-boy
friend must remain just friends and ditto one young man's
declaration of mere friendship to his girl friend.  But all's well that
ends well and the whole team of lovable collegians, some
boisterous, others quiet and meditative; some geeky and others
cheeky, are paired off by the closing credits of this rollicking
comedy from the pen of Adam Herz with James B. Rogers at the
helm.</P>
<P>   A sequel to "American Pie," which broke some new ground as
a primer on establishing an intimate relationship with a dessert,
"American Pie 2" is more of the same, though without the cutting
edge provided by the predecessor's novelty, the party begins to
outlive its welcome.</P>
<P>   No matter though, because so many of the sketches work once
Rogers gets past a fairly flat opening and we get to like each one
of the fellas and gals that the picture is a compelling enough
dash of summer silliness to garner an endorsement.  The high
school seniors that we met and loved last year have just
completed their freshman year of college and though a couple of
the romantic relationships have fizzled, the fun-loving boys  are
sticking together for a season of merriment at an endless
summer-resort beach party.  Leading the levity is Jim (Jason
Biggs), a not yet confident fellow who regularly gets firm
encouragement in matters sexual from his liberal-minded but
often embarrassing dad (played by the wonderful Eugene Levy). 
After a goodbye tryst from a woman with whom he had never
shared a hello relationship, he moves out to the lakeside retreat
with the motormouthed Stifler (Seann William Scott), who like
everyone else of both genders has just one thing on his mind--
but is the one least likely to hide his consuming preoccupation. 
Joining them are the disparate denizens of the college including
the geeky Sherman (Chris Owen), who turns everyone off by
insisting that he's the Shermanator; Oz (Chris Klein), whose
woman friend Heather (Mena Suvari) has gone to Europe; Finch
(Eddie Kaye Thomas), whose fixation with sex leads him to
Eastern thought, namely the practice of Tantric yoga which he
claims could generate an orgasm lasting for an hour or so; and
Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) who simply can't get over his
breakup with the gorgeous Vicky (Tara Reid).</P>
<P>   According to the press notes, "the women in the movie want to
have fun and they want adventure...They're ready for
shenanigans with the guys, but they're not about to be taken for
granted."  The sure had me fooled, then, because these girls
come across as hornier than the guys and in one case Michelle
(Alyson Haningan) is even willing to teach the inexperienced Jim
how to seduce a woman as though she were instructing him in
the latest and coolest dance steps.</P>
<P>   Most of the fun comes from the mishaps and while there's no
pie this time around--no need for one when there are so many
sweet young things around to take its place--the topper involves
Jim once again who halfway through the story gets stuck not on
a girl but on...himself, using a brand of Krazy Glue which he
places liberally on himself thinking that it's a KY-type of
lubricating ointment.</P>
<P>   If you've been introduced to the vulgarities of the screen
beginning with "There's Something About Mary" and anything
else by the Farrelly brothers, you may find that either the
coarseness is toned down in the J.B. Rogers picture or that we
have become so accustomed to indelicacies in the theater that
"American Pie 2" seems delightful without being offensive.  We
root for all of these folks to get hooked up with the persons they
most desire, even the obnoxious Stifler, because uncouth as
these revelers may be at times, they're all good natured--as is
the picture.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 100 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
