<P>     I know that Americans love an underdog, but really...enough already.
It has gotten to the point in the marketing of independent films where
selling the meagerness of the budget and the film-makers' sacrifices in
getting their pet projects made has turned into a kind of bizarre
one-downmanship.  If your guy made his movie for $20,000, our guy made his
for $15,000; if your guy financed his movie with Visa cards, our guy sold
one of his kidneys to pay the caterer.  It is tempting to sell the
compelling story behind the movie (particularly if you arc concerned about
whether there is a compelling story _in_ the movie), but I believe that
there are negative consequences to turning every independent film-maker to
come down the pike into Horatio Alger.  These young directors are
experiencing success, but it is success with an asterisk, because the
audiences have been asked to appreciate their work not on its merit but
because they worked so darned hard.</P>
<P>     Take ED'S NEXT MOVE, for example.  Written and directed by newcomer
John Walsh, it is the story of Eddie Brodsky (Matt Ross), a Wisconsin
chemist who decides to take a big step when his long-time girlfriend
(Cathy Curtin) dumps him:  moving to New York to take a job in a genetic
engineering lab.  The big city is daunting, but Eddie begins to adjust
once he finds an apartment -- and a roommate named Ray (Kevin Carroll) --
and begins to get into a routine.  The one thing missing is a romantic
relationship, a special someone like Lee (Callie Thorne), a musician Eddie
keeps running into.  When he finally gets up the nerve to ask her out.  He
finds the road to true love is complicated by boyfriends, mousetraps, the
common cold and the double-edged sword of being a Nice Guy.</P>
<P>     ED'S NEXT MOVE is a perfectly pleasant little romantic comedy, an
unassuming and unpretentious character study which makes more than a
casual not to ANNIE HALL.  Walsh has fashioned an outsider's-eye-view
valentine to New York's idiosyncracies the way Allen fashions
insider's-eye-view valentines, and both films find neurosis getting in the
way of a potential romance; Walsh even cribs from ANNIE HALL's more
surreal moments, like a scene with translators interpreting the 
conversation in which Anne breaks up with Eddie which recalls ANNIE HALL'S
sub-titles scene.  Still, there is an appealing performance by Matt Ross
as a smart, likeable protagonist who, blessedly, is not a self-absorbed
aspiring artist of some sort like so many indie film protagonists, and
solid supporting work from Kevin Carroll as a ladies' man who is not a
stereotypical jerk.  Although Walsh provides few laugh-out-loud moments,
he also doesn't seem wrapped up in showing off his own cleverness, and the
result is a comedy which makes you feel comfortable.</P>
<P>     And that is about all it does.  There is a place for entertainments
like ED'S NEXT MOVE, and you could spend your seven dollars at the movies
in far worse ways, but it would not surprise me to see a rush to anoint
Walsh as the next Edward (THE BROTHERS McMULLEN) Burns or Kevin (CLERKS)
Smith.  Of course, we saw how short the honeymoon was for those two after
SHE'S THE ONE and MALLRATS, respectively.  There is a disturbing tendency
among critics (and yes, I include myself among them) to treat an
independent film like a high school play, where it is considered a great
show if everyone remembers their lines and no one trips over the set.  The
thing is that those high school actors and directors turn into college
actors and directors, and mere competence suddenly isn't quite as cute.</P>
<P>     Getting a film made -- independent or otherwise -- is a brutal
business, but a film is no more or less worthy of praise because it was a
labor of love.  ED'S NEXT MOVE has several things going for it, notably
young characters who have some ambition and common sense, but Walsh shows
no particular facility with a camera, and his story has virtually nothing
going on beneath its agreeable surface.  Basically, it is an amusing bit
of fluff which is quite similar to other bits of fluff you have seen
before, one which promises and delivers little more than a few inoffensive
smiles.  It is the independent film world's fickle romance with starving
artists which starts making promises which John Walsh and other young
directors -- armed a couple of years later with more money but the same
amount of talent -- might find themselves unable to keep.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 opening moves:  6.</PRE>
