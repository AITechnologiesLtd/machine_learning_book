<PRE>"You're not a columnist.  You're a reporter who writes long."
                                        - Keaton to Quaid</PRE>
<P>     Ron Howard makes good, old-fashioned Hollywood movies with good,
old-fashioned Hollywood casts.  In PARENTHOOD, Opie snagged Steve
Martin, Rick Moranis, Dianne Wiest, and Mary Steenburgen.  In
BACKDRAFT, he "fired" Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, Scott Glenn, and
Bobby DeNiro.  Howard's newest, THE PAPER, is an immensely enjoyable
big-city newpaper nod with a by-line that reads Michael Keaton, Robert
Duvall, Glenn Close, Marisa Tomei, and Randy Quaid.</P>
<P>     So what if the notion of a newspaper film is nothing more than a
tired truckstop on the information highway?  In New York City--where
the story is set--newspaper newsrooms, plural, still exist and still
reach a readership that television hasn't turned completely
illiterate.  This PAPER is the fictional "New York Sun," a tabloid
loosely modeled on the "New York Post."</P>
<P>     First and foremost, THE PAPER reminds us why we like Michael
Keaton.  As the editor of the City Desk, who's worried about everything
from a job interview to a very-pregnant wife (Tomei), Keaton crackles
with an energy that we haven't seen in years.  MY LIFE was no life and
the real Mr. Mom appeared only briefly in both MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
and BATMAN RETURNS.</P>
<P>     THE PAPER brings Keaton back into the foreground with a role he
can sink his sharp teeth into.  His character is super-strung and lives
on Coke product placements and never takes a break to eat or sleep or
have a lengthy conversation with his wife.  He stays wired as only
Keaton can, which is one-step below W.F.O.  Except for one scene on a
phone call to Spalding Gray-- who plays an edtior at a rival 'paper--
when Keaton get nuts and transforms into Beetlejuice Beetlejuice
Beetlejuice.  And that's why we love him.</P>
<PRE>     Compared to Keaton, the *rest* of the cast is moving in
slow-motion.</PRE>
<P>     Randy Quaid is a riot as a gun-toting columnist who's waging a
personal war against the City's parking commissioner.  Even in a
mock-serious bar fight, Quaid drops one-liners like the seasoned pro
that he is.  Marisa Tomei seems to have fewer scenes than Quaid, but
she has a good time getting ticked at her husband and playing roving
reporter and looking like all other movie wives who are at least
ten-years younger than their husbands.</P>
<P>     Glenn Close is a delight as the bitchy Managing Editor who is
perpetually feuding with Keaton up to the point of exchanging blows
without the benefit of rubber costumes.  Her role improves with the
running time, though, and Close closes the film with a classic line.</P>
<P>     Oddly, Robert Duvall is wasted as the weary-with-prostrate-cancer
Editor-in-Chief.  We've heard his voice-of-experience rap before and
with an estranged-daughter subplot, his character exists solely to
hammer home the central idea of "do not squander time, that is the
stuff life is made of."</P>
<P>     The dialogue crackles from start to finish.  Pick your scene and
pick your favorite line.  Keaton to Quaid: "When did you get so
paranoid?" Quaid to Keaton: "When they started plotting against me."
The words are backed by impressive images--a nice synthesis of
photography and production design.  Which translates into a lot of
conversations with gorgeous skylines or gargantuan printing presses in
the background.</P>
<P>     THE PAPER smudges in a few spots.  Howard employs a handy-cam too
many times and, obviously, didn't watch either HUSBANDS AND WIVES or
MANHATTEN MURDER MYSTERY to see just how annoying *that* technique can
be.  Unless you're filming in Poland, Ron, keep your stuff steady.  The
story is also rather pat in places and this to be expected because in a
Ron Howard film *everything* gets wrapped in a comfortable and logical
fashion.</P>
<P>     Still, a little more grit would've been welcome.</P>
<P>     Finally, THE PAPER is a great sum of great parts.  Smaller, but no
less significant, bits include a hilarious bar fight with Jason
Alexander wearing a fake moustache and waving a gun while overacting; a
wall of clocks displaying separate times for each borough; and Tomei
touch-typing baby-shower thank-you notes.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:  THE PAPER is a quintessential Ron Howard film with a big
              cast and a big budget and a big story that even teaches
              lesson while favoring funny newspaper films like THE
              FRONT PAGE.  THE PAPER is also the best Michael Keaton
              movie in a number of years.</PRE>
