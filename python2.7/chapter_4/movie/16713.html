A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Donald Petrie</PRE>
<P>Written by: Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver</P>
<P>Starring: Jeff Daniels, Christopher Lloyd, Daryl Hannah, Elizabeth
Hurley</P>
<P>Synopsis:
MY FAVORITE MARTIAN is a special effects comedy based on the 1963 black
and white TV sitcom of the same name starring Ray Walston and Bill
Bixby.</P>
<P>A young Santa Barbara newsman named Tim stumbles upon a crashed Martian
spaceship and befriends a wacky but kindhearted Martian as well as the
Martian's sentient space suit. To help the friendly Martian remain
undetected, Tim and the Martian pretend the Martian is Tim's "Uncle
Martin." Funny situations arise out of cultural misunderstandings,
attempts to remain inconspicuous in the community, and trying to
outsmart alien-catching dark-suited agents from a menacing research
organization called SETI.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Martin tries to help Tim's romance life. Tim fantasizes about
glamour gal Brace (Elizabeth Hurley), but isn't plain coworker Lizzie
(Daryl Hannah) closer to his heart?</P>
<P>Opinion:
Truth is stranger than fiction. Blurry, high altitude shots of the Mars
northern hemisphere's Cydonia region (taken by the 1976 Viking I Mars
orbiting probe and published by the National Space Science Data Center)
reveal what seem to be various triangular, square, and 5-sided pyramidal
objects, along with straight lines among and between them. Most
intriguing is a gigantic Washington Monument-type obelisk standing tall
on the side of a huge crater and casting a long shadow. Since craters
are large indentations caused by meteorites smashing into the ground,
it's likely the monument was created after the crater formed; otherwise
it would have been smashed to smithereens by the meteorite. If so, what
natural process could have erected a tall, thin, pointy structure? It
would take a six-month journey from Earth to Mars in order to reach the
site and investigate.</P>
<P>As for the movie, fans of the 1960s TV series will recognize the theme
song and welcome the familiar face of Ray Walston. There's not a whole
lot of substance to MY FAVORITE MARTIAN, but plenty of energetic running
around and MEN IN BLACK-style morphing into goofy alien creatures make
it entertaining as a children's film. Parents, however, should be warned
there are some instances of crude humor that aren't too appropriate for
little kids such as the space suit growing breasts and a scientist
hinting of sexual advances to a tied up lady.</P>
