<P>Filling the hole usually occupied by crappy Saturday Night Live
skits-turned-feature films, Ben Stiller's Zoolander is a comedy cut from the
same cloth as Airplane and The Naked Gun.  Like those pictures, it throws a
lot of jokes at the audience, but most of them stick, which makes it better
than all of the recent SNL debacles.  Zoolander, like Superstar and Ladies'
Man, was born in sketch comedy, expanding a character created by Stiller for
the 1996 and 1997 VH-1 Fashion Awards.</P>
<P>Stiller plays three-time Male Model of the Year Derek Zoolander, a
brain-dead pretty boy we meet as he's being interviewed for Time by a
reporter named Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor, Marcia from the Brady
film updates) just before the VH-1 Fashion Awards (the cable channel
produced the film).  Matilda, intent on writing a scathing piece on the
modeling industry, gets plenty of good stuff, topped off by Derek showing
her his catalogue of different "looks" that all look the same.</P>
<P>Derek is up for an unprecedented fourth straight MMOY Award but loses to
red-hot newcomer Hansel (Owen Wilson, Stiller's Meet the Parents co-star),
who tools around with a yo-yo, a scooter and an entourage that seems to grow
in each scene.  Crushed, Derek considers retiring, but he is talked into one
last campaign by agent Maury Ballstein (Jerry Stiller).  The big Derelicte
show, it turns out, is really a ruse by an international syndicate of
fashion designers who want to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia
because he's threatening to enact laws that will do away with the cheap
child labor the designers need to make their dumb clothes.  Derek is
hypnotized by a Bond-like baddie (Will Ferrell, SNL) named Jacobim Mugatu,
who has a foxy Russian henchwoman (Milla Jovovich, The Claim) available to
do his bidding.</P>
<P>Most of Zoolander's laughs come at the expense of male models, but the
film's biggest gag might be its attempt to push Stiller (who's practically a
chimp) and Wilson (who has the worst nose in Hollywood) as the cream of the
world's modeling crop.  But Zoolander is far from a one-joke flick.  There
are plenty of very funny set pieces (including Derek's return to his
coal-mining roots) and a ton of nods to other films (most notably and
hysterically, 2001: A Space Odyssey).  Stiller also casts half of the
industry as both themselves and fictional characters (including a nearly
unrecognizable Andy Dick), as well as most of his family.</P>
<P>Wilson, once again, steals the show in the acting department (he's been
believable as a cowboy, a serial killer, and now, a rock-star-like model).
As far as Stiller's direction (which I've thought has been overrated ever
since Reality Bites), he's far from being what even the dimmest person could
consider accomplished, but he gets the job done by keeping the film's pace
quick and steady.  Stiller co-wrote Zoolander's script with Drake Sather,
who has worked on some of television's funniest shows (NewsRadio, The Larry
Sanders Show).  And Zoolander is yet another film that previously featured
shots of the World Trade Center, which have been removed from the prints
that will make their way to theatres near you.</P>
<P>1:30 - PG-13 on appeal for sexual content and drug references</P>
