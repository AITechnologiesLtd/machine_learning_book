<P>Too many movies use the words "based on a true story" as an excuse for 
blandness. What they don't realise is that just because a story might be true 
doesn't make it interesting. Then again, sometimes the fact that a tale 
really happened might give it more importance or context. If only that had 
been the case with István Szabó's "Sunshine". The film is a silly fiction, 
but if it had really happened, well, that would have been something.</P>
<P>"Sunshine" follows three generations in a Hungarian family in three different 
times of revolution, dividing its three-hour running time evenly between each 
of its three stories. The first main character is Ignatz Sonnenschein, a 
lawyer in the late 19th Century who allows himself to change his Jewish name 
to Sors for purposes of conformity, marries a girl who had been raised as his 
sister, and finds that his work for the imperial government puts him in 
danger when communists come to power. Next we focus on his son Adam Sors, who 
allows himself to change his religion for purposes of conformity, marries a 
girl he hardly knows, has an affair with his sister-in-law, and finds that 
his heritage puts him in danger when the Nazis seem set to take over Europe. 
Finally comes the tale of Adam's son Ivan, who allows himself to get 
entangled in Stalinist persecutions, has an affair with an important army 
general's wife, and finds himself in danger during the Purges.</P>
<P>The connections are obvious: Each man somehow sells out, dives into 
troublesome romance and then winds up in over his head in a deadly political 
situation. What's more, Ignatz, Adam and Ivan are all played by the same 
actor, Ralph Fiennes. Subtle. The theory that the mistakes and sins of 
fathers can be repeated by their sons was present in the background of the 
"Godfather" and "Jean de Florette" movies, through vital situations and 
interesting characters. "Sunshine" thinks it's some kind of profound parable 
where the drama doesn't need to be fulfilling in itself. The people and 
plights are all just one-dimensional cardboard, existing to prove points. 
Nobody is convincing as a living, breathing person, and so we never care, and 
the point of the film is clear but carries no power.</P>
<P>Much of the movie has the silliness of "Legends of the Fall", without any of 
the gusto that made that movie enjoyable. When I saw it, people in the 
audience were laughing in key moments. Consider the amateurish attempts to 
mix the movie's own footage with old newsreel clips, just by developing bits 
in black and white. Or the exaggerated reaction shots of people rolling their 
eyes. Miriam Margolyes, as Ignatz's mother, breaks down crying so often that 
eventually the woman sitting next to me started doing a countdown whenever 
she appeared onscreen.</P>
<P>But even when the film does work on the level of performances and technical 
beauty, that doesn't change how simple-minded it is. Director Szabó's own 
"Mephisto" (1981) took its title from a fairly obvious parallel -- the one 
between its lead character and the story of "Dr. Faustus" -- but the content 
of the film didn't rely on it, and introduced it up front and kept it as a 
side-issue. "Sunshine" spends 180 minutes reiterating the same message, one 
that we've heard before and could be reminded of in a single line.</P>
