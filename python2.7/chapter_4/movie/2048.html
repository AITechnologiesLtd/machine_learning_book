<PRE>                             LAST ACTION HERO
                       A film review by John Walker
                        Copyright 1993 John Walker</PRE>
<PRE>My form of "rating": I saw it twice at first-run prices, and
     *wanted* to see it more.  It had left (I don't get much
     time for movies), so I bought the baseball cap as a
     token of loyalty.  I'll buy the tape when it comes out.</PRE>
<PRE>                               <<In brief>></PRE>
<P>     If you leave your expectations behind, you'll find LAST ACTION
HERO to be an enjoyable film worth recommending to others.  If you like
a movie that explores the fantasy/reality dichotomy, you'll find an
*extremely* enjoyable flick worth at least a second viewing.</P>
<P>     And if you like movies that allow layers of interpretation where
one level unfolds to another, then you may wind up boring your friends
with continued discoveries.  (If, further, you're a movie freak who
enjoys humorous references to other films, watch it with a friend who's
similarly minded.  You can compare notes afterwards.)</P>
<PRE>                            <<The story>></PRE>
<P>     Well, for those of us in the States, this is post mortem.  But
I've heard one too many comment from folks who seem to have seen a
totally different LAST ACTION HERO than I saw.  If nothing else, maybe
some folks in Europe will benefit from a different point of view.</P>
<P>     The story is probably known, but it can be recapped briefly:</P>
<P>     Danny (Austin O'Brien) is a fan of Jack Slater (Arnold
Schwarzenegger) movies.  He gets two gifts from Nick (Robert Prosky), a
theater projectionist: one, being allowed to sneak in on a
pre-screening (at midnight) of the latest Jack Slater flick; and two, a
"magic" ticket given to the projectionist when he was kid by none other
than Houdini.</P>
<P>     The ticket has "a mind of its own" and throws Danny right into the
film.  He and Jack must deal with a gang lord (played by Anthony Quinn)
and his hit man Benedict (Charles Dance) as they plan to pull off a
major slaughter of the competition.  Benedict will get hold of the
ticket and find that our world (Danny's) is a place where "bad guys can
*win*."  Jack and Danny have to defeat him.</P>
<PRE>                        <<Not quite a satire>></PRE>
<P>     One thing about expectations becomes obvious at the outset: this
ain't an action flick.  And yet it's not *not*-an-action-flick.  It
might better be called an action-flick flick.</P>
<P>     Those who expect a satire of action flicks will be only partially
satisfied.  The spoofing of the genre is coming from people who
basically *like* action flicks.  And Danny is the chief representative
of that crowd.  As he settles down to his first viewing of the new Jack
Slater flick, he *knows the rules*.  Watching the Jack Slater film's
first explosion, Danny practically lists out the body count before we
even see what's really happened.</P>
<PRE>             "He's okay.  ...  All the cops dead."</PRE>
<PRE>     Of course, he's right.</PRE>
<P>     If it's all so predictable, some might wonder why he bothers to
go.  It's not novelty of plot; presumably there's *something else*.  We
never get told what *he* thinks the something else is in the Jack
Slater flick.  But LAST ACTION HERO's something else is Danny himself
and his relation to the Slater film (*and* to LAST ACTION HERO).</P>
<PRE>                            <<Two worlds>></PRE>
<P>     As LAST ACTION HERO progresses, there are two quite separate
"lines" going: the first is the plot of the Jack Slater flick that
Danny is trapped in.  The second -- the something else -- is a sort of
dialogue between Danny and Jack.  Danny repeatedly tries to prove to
Jack that they're in a movie.  For instance, he points out that there's
an *animated cat* at police headquarters.  And he points out that all
the telephone numbers begin with 555 -- which allows only 9,999
possible phone numbers for millions of people in Los Angeles alone.</P>
<P>     The interesting thing is that from Jack's perspective, there's a
perfectly plausible reply: he knows the cat is there -- the cat is a
*good cop*.  And they have *area codes*!  Nonetheless, Jack does seem
to recognize that this kid has something.  Danny knows things he should
have no means of knowing.</P>
<P>     An important point is reached when Danny writes something on a
piece of paper, shows it to Jack, and asks him to say the word.  Jack
won't.  Of course, he won't -- he *can't*.  This is rated PG!</P>
<P>     Although nothing is said of this, my own conclusion is that Danny
has hit a weak point in Jack's logical armor: why *can't* he say it?
Jack's expression is one of confusion and consternation.</P>
<P>     For his part, however, Danny is recognizing that the movie is in
some sense *real*.  At one point the villain is escaping in his car;
Danny, on a girl's bike, decides it's the time to play chicken.  After
all, this is a movie: the car will swerve to avoid him, and it'll
crash.  Right?</P>
<PRE>            "Chicken it is.  ...  This is *gonna* work.  It's a movie,
       I'm a good guy.  This has *got* to *work*!</PRE>
<P>But as he pedals on, something dawns on him:</P>
<PRE>            "I'm a comedy sidekick!  It's not gonna work!"</PRE>
<P>He's *expendable*!  So *he* swerves and crashes!</P>
<P>     Danny has recognized this may be a movie, but he's *in* it.  He's
not immortal.  Even if this is a movie, he still doesn't want to get
killed.  He has to *act* as if it's real, because in some sense it
*is*.</P>
<PRE>                       <<Worlds behind worlds>></PRE>
<P>     Well, it's fun to have a movie let you think about how fantasy and
reality work together.  But the "dialogue" between Danny and Jack (and
Jack's world) is not all there is.</P>
<P>     First, we may well be learning more about Jack's world than
customarily shows up on the screen.  His apartment is empty and
barren.  He gets a store clerk to call him at headquarters so people
will think his ex-wife is still interested.  She ain't.</P>
<PRE>     There's a reality behind the fantasy.</PRE>
<P>     But, if there's a reality behind the fantasy, what about
"reality"?  What about Danny's New York?</P>
<P>     When Benedict gets hold of the ticket, he uses it to go to the
"real world."  From his perspective, it's not the real world, it's
simply a parallel universe.</P>
<P>     Well, if there's a reality behind the fantasy, there's also a
fantasy behind the reality.  Sooner or later, it must dawn on us that
we're *watching a movie*.  The only historical/cinematic analogy I can
think of is the Roy Rogers type of westerns compared to the "Gunsmoke"
type.  Gunsmoke *looked* real, but it was still a fantasy.</P>
<P>     Danny's New York superficially looks real.  And when Jack gets hit
there, it *hurts*.  But there are tell-tale signs all over.  Take only
one example (of many): We get at one point a virtual sea of
*immaculate* cabs!  And they all seem available!  Yeah, this is the New
York I have seen.  Yeah, right away.</P>
<P>     The time in New York apparently disappointed a number of critics
and viewers.  But if you see it as learning about the fantasy behind
the reality, it's one of the most pleasing sections of the film.  It's
where the "dialogue" gets wrapped up.</P>
<PRE>                   <<So why didn't it do better?>></PRE>
<P>     As some have noted, LAST ACTION HERO did pretty well -- but *not*
in terms of expectations or dollar investment.  (It remains to be seen
whether European audiences can bring it into the black.)  I think that
the problem is that it's a "niche-breaker."  As I said above, it's not
an action flick, but it's not *not*-an-action-flick.</P>
<P>     Action-flick fans probably saw it once, thought it was okay, but
not TERMINATOR, and didn't see it again.  Or worse still, expecting
TERMINATOR, felt let down.</P>
<P>     People who can't stand action flicks probably stayed away on
principle.</P>
<P>     In the "middle" we have the critics -- people who spend most of
their time bewailing Hollywood's reliance on predictable niches -- and
the rest of the time savaging any film that doesn't fall into a
predictable niche.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, people who can't stand action flicks are frequently
the sort of people who pay attention to critics.</P>
<P>     My own litmus test of LAST ACTION HERO's potential was a woman who
usually likes relatively "serious" films.  A Schwarzenegger flick would
*not* be on her must-see list.  But, having heard my praise, and being
in a spur-of-the-moment mood, she and her husband saw it.  They both
enjoyed it -- and more than the serious film they'd been looking
forward to (THE FIRM).</P>
<PRE>                       <<Some random comments>></PRE>
<P>     First, I haven't got into all the "references" in LAST ACTION
HERO.  I'll give one that I didn't notice the first time.  Early on,
Danny watches a Roadrunner cartoon, and it includes the requisite
product from ACME, where *everything* comes from in Roadrunner
cartoons.  After Danny's thrown into the flick, villains are throwing
dynamite sticks.  What's the label on the side of the box?  Yup,
"ACME."</P>
<P>     LAST ACTION HERO is packed with these.  If you don't see them, you
don't lose anything.  If you *do* see them, they're freebie extras.
Watch it with a friend; compare notes.</P>
<P>     (For independent research: what's the significance of the title?)</P>
<P>     Next, I have been told that Schwarzenegger cannot act.  What he
has, I'm told, is "presence."  Well, perhaps what that means is that
he's really a character actor, that he has a range into which he fits
comfortably, but the range is not as wide as other, better, actors.</P>
<P>     As far as acting and presence are concerned, I particularly
enjoyed watching "Jack" confront "Arnold" in the the "real" New York.
If Schwarzenegger can't act, he can at least change presence at will.
There were two different people on screen as far as I was concerned.
If that's not acting, it's a good substitute.</P>
<P>     Finally, I do hope that LAST ACTION HERO does well in Europe.
Maybe if the film makes money, however little, more people in Hollywood
will be willing to break niches.  To do that, however, they're going to
have to figure ways to circumvent the critics and the other media, and
to get to those audiences (or audience segments) who are apt to like a
particular flick.</P>
<P>     I can't really blame the TERMINATOR fans who didn't like LAST
ACTION HERO.  People have preferences and that's that.  In music, I
happen to like (among others) Renaissance, late Romantics, the 30s
"sweet" sound, and hard rock.  Statistically, however, folks who like
one are apt to dislike or be bored by *at least* one of the others.
But I get tired when people seem to think that they can only defend
their music by putting down someone else's.</P>
<P>     In film, the jerks are not those who like one genre or another.
The jerks are the critics who get locked into niches while pretending
to be above them all.</P>
<P>     Alas, poor Arnold, you did a flick that was meant to be seen by
people who tend to pay attention to critics!</P>
