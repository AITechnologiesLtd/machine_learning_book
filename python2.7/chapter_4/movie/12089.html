<P>     From a major league baseball radio broadcast, featuring play-by-
play man Harry Canary and color man Whitey Hashbrown, with special guest 
commentator James Berardinelli.</P>
<P>HC:  As we go to the top of the 8th, we're joined in the booth by film 
critic James Berardinelli, who's here fresh from seeing the new baseball 
movie, MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO THE MINORS, the third in the popular saga 
taking a lighter look at the Majors.  Nice to see you, Jim.  As a big 
baseball fan and a movie reviewer, can you give us the scoop on the new 
flick?</P>
<P>JB:  My opinion:  the producers should have stopped while they were 
ahead, and that was nine years ago.  One entry was definitely enough, 
and I'm surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low 
quality of MAJOR LEAGUE 2.  This latest installment has all the earmarks 
of something that should have been released direct-to-video.  It's worse 
than a mediocre made-for-TV feature.  I should also mention that this 
movie likely won't play all that well in Cleveland.  Now that the real 
Indians are perennial contenders, they have been replaced by the 
Minnesota Twins as the cinematic sadsacks.  Actually, most of the action 
involves the Twins' AAA minor league club, the Buzz, rather than the 
actual major league franchise.</P>
<P>HC:  Sorry to interrupt, Jim, but we still have to do play-by-play for 
the game on the field.  Leading off this inning is John Warren.  He 
steps into the batter's box and takes Kent's pitch low for ball one.</P>
<P>WH:  So, the story's strictly minor league, right?  What's it about?</P>
<P>JB:  Scott Bakula, the guy from QUANTUM LEAP, plays career minor league 
pitcher Gus Cantrell.  When Twins owner Roger Dorn, once again portrayed 
by Corbin Bernsen, needs a new manager for his AAA team, he offers the 
job to Gus, who is now faced with two daunting tasks:  turn the team 
around and groom hot prospect Downtown Anderson (played by Walt Goggins) 
for a promotion to "the Show."  With the help of former major leaguers 
Pedro Cerrano (Dennis Haysbert), Rube Baker (Eric Bruskotter), and Isuro 
Tanaka (Takaaki Ishibashi), Gus gets the Buzz on the right track.  In 
fact, he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous 
manager of the big-league club, Leonard Huff (played with over-the-top 
relish by Ted McGinley).  Soon, Dorn has arranged an exhibition game 
that pits Gus' overachieving group against Huff's overpaid, last-place 
bunch.</P>
<PRE>WH: Can we guess who wins?</PRE>
<P>JB:  The results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a 
game when you've already seen the box score.  On top of that, none of 
the mock-ups are presented with much flair.  They're not just boring; 
they're lackluster.  But the MAJOR LEAGUE movies have never been about 
drama or tension; they've been about using baseball situations to 
generate laughs.</P>
<PRE>HC:  Warren fouls off a fastball.  1 and 1.</PRE>
<PRE>WH:  Are there lots of yuks in this one?</PRE>
<P>JB:  Not one, from start to finish.  I enjoyed the first MAJOR LEAGUE 
because it was reasonably fresh and funny.  Okay, a lot of the jokes 
were sophomoric, but they made me laugh.  The two sequels haven't just 
been stale, but their humor quotient has been abysmally low.  Even Bob 
Uecker's once-sharp one-liners have turned lame, and they're the closest 
the film comes to being even vaguely amusing.</P>
<P>HC:  Here's the 1-1 pitch.  Looooooong drive… fair or foul…  Foul Ball!  
The count goes to 1 and 2.</P>
<P>WH:  Does the film at least get the baseball details correct?</P>
<P>JB:  Yes.  There aren't any glaring errors like there were in one of the 
best-ever baseball movies, THE NATURAL.  But I'd gladly trade a 
technically accurate film for one with a good story, believable 
characters, or even a little genuine humor.  Heck, THE NAKED GUN is a 
better baseball comedy than MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO THE MINORS.</P>
<P>WH:  It's nice to see old friends one more time, isn't it?  Like 
Cerrano, Tanaka, and Dorn.</P>
<P>JB:  Depends on whether you really care that anyone is back. There 
aren't any real characters here – just an assortment of cliched 
oddballs.  Yeah, the voodoo hitter, the catcher who can't throw back to 
the pitcher, the Japanese player, and the conceited player-turned-owner 
have all returned, but who really cares?  They have no depth.  Notable 
absences include Tom Berenger's veteran and Charlie Sheen's "Wild 
Thing."  We don't really miss them, though.  </P>
<P>HC:  Breaking ball, low and outside.  2 and 2.</P>
<P>WH:  So you're saying that we should give this one a miss?</P>
<P>JB:  That's right.  To use baseball terminology, it's a three-pitch 
strikeout.  If you're looking for a good movie that involves baseball, 
try popping THE NATURAL, FIELD OF DREAMS, BULL DURHAM, or even the first 
MAJOR LEAGUE into the VCR.  Actually, this is an oddly-timed release, 
since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in 
theaters.  Even the minor league seasons are already underway.  Don't 
bother with MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO THE MINORS. It's a wretched time-
waster.</P>
<PRE>WH: Thanks for the advice.</PRE>
<PRE>JB:  You're welcome.</PRE>
<P>HC:  And here's the 2-2 pitch.  Fouled back, right into this booth.  
Hey, Jim, heads up!  Oops.  Somebody better get him some ice for that.  
He may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies, but he needs to learn 
not to duck into foul balls.  Odd how Warren seemed to aim that ball 
right at him, almost as if he has a grudge to settle.  Anyway, back to 
the action on the field…</P>
