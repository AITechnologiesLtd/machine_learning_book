<PRE>                             THE PREACHER'S WIFE
                        Copyright 1996 D & S Associates</PRE>
<P>Penny Marshall updates the 1947 holiday film, "The Bishop's Wife",
which starred Loretta Young, Cary Grant and David Niven, with her
latest effort, "The Preacher's Wife", starring Whitney Houston, Denzel
Washington and Courtney B. Vance.</P>
<P>The Reverend Henry Biggs, played by Vance, is the pastor of a small,
urban church which has seen better days. Henry, living in the shadow
of the church's former pastor, the father of his beautiful wife Julia,
played by Houston, has doubts about his ability to save his little
parish from its downward spiral. Finally, in desparation, Henry asks
the big guy himself, God, to lend a hand.</P>
<P>Help does arrive in the guise of Dudley, played by Washington, an all
too down-to-earth angel sent to assist the skeptical preacher in
turning things around for the church and community.</P>
<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>I have a very strong affinity to the original film, "The Bishop's
Wife", mainly because of a decades-long crush on Loretta Young as the
luminous Julia. Young gave a deeply charming performance, exuding
warmth, love and beauty, making the film a poarticular holiday
favorite of mine.</P>
<P>Penny Marshall, with "The Preacher's Wife", does a competent job in
remaking and updating the original film, catching the spirit of "The
Bishop's Wife", if not the more palpable magic of the first.</P>
<P>Whitney Houston, not a particular favorite of mine, is far more self
assure than her earlier outings, dominating the screen when singing,
especially the gospel tunes. Her acting is still stilted, but getting
better. The many songs she sings takes attention from her developing
acting skills.</P>
<P>Dudley, the angel, as played by Cary Grant, always struck me as a
vacuous, if suave, character, in the film for the face. Denzel
Washington lends the character the necessary charm and wit, with a
hint of randiness, that it needs.</P>
<P>Courney Vance, of the principle cast, fares best ast the beleaguered
preacher, Henry, who is trying to hold his church and his marriage
together, while also trying to cope with the dealings of the
ubiquitous Dudley. Where David Niven played Henry as a straight-laced
prig, Vance gives the Reverend more dimension and nuance.</P>
<P>There are some theological problems about Dudley's origins that go
against the teachings of Christianity, but, what the hell, we'll let
it slip by.</P>
<P>"The Preacher's Wife" is a kind-hearted holiday flick with lots of
gospel music and decent performances, and a fair rtelling of the
original.</P>
<P>I give "The Preacher's Wife" a B-  (I give "The Bishop's Wife" a B)</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Director Penny Marshall and screenwriter Allan Scott have done a fine
job of updating "The Bishop's Wife" for the 90s with "The Preacher's
Wife." Whitney Houston stars as Julia Biggs, the wife of Reverend
Henry Biggs (Courtney B. Vance), a man trying, but failing, to walk in
the footsteps of Julia's inspiring father and keep his poor New York
City parish from going under. Their son Jeremiah (Justin Pierre
Edmund) is about to lose his best friend Hakim to child welfare, the
church boiler is near collapse, a young parishioner is falsely accused
of a crime and developer Joe Hamilton (Gregory Hines) has purchased
the church's mortgage with pricey condominiums in mind.</P>
<P>Denzel Washington is Dudley, the angel who's been waiting to be sent
to earth to good deeds and eat pizza.  While Washington doesn't quite
embody the charm of the original's Cary Grant, he comes fairly close.
At least the women, including Julia's mom Marguerite (Jennifer Lewis),
don't find him too tough to take even though Reverend Biggs views him
with suspicion.</P>
<P>"The Preacher's Wife" is obviously a Whitney Houston showcase, though.
She's the church's choir leader, giving way for ample opportunity to
let her belt out a few numbers.  I usually find her singing grating,
but here, singing mostly Gospel numbers, she's just fine.  This is her
most natural and relaxed performance.  You believe she's as good
hearted as she's supposed to be, even if she indulges in a little
'window shopping' with Dudley. </P>
<P>The real standouts in the cast are Jennifer Lewis, a still beautiful
and devillish older woman with a solid moral core and Courtney B.
Vance's beleagered Henry (he's beginning to show a real chameleon-like
acting ability - his character here is SO different from those of
"Dangerous Minds", "The Last Supper" and "Panther").  Also amusing in
a supporting role is "Waiting to Exhale"'s Loretta Devine as Bigg's
single mother church secretary.</P>
<P>I have a couple of complaints with "The Preacher's Wife."  For one
thing, Whitney's wardrobe is largely inappropriate.  During the
skating sequence she's wearing a hat that looks like an expensive
designer number. In fact, the struggling family seems to lack for
nothing - Jeremiah's bedroom is strewn with toys.  The costumes used
for the church's nativity play look Hollywood professional as well.
Also, the running time is padded out to a full two numbers because of
all the musical numbers, not all of which are necessary.</P>
<P>Overall, though, "The Preacher's Wife" is a fine holiday family film.</P>
