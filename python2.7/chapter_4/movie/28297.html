 The Mummy Returns (2001) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Brendan Fraser,
Rachel Weisz,  John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Freddie Boath, The Rock, Oded
Fehr, Patricia Velasquez and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Music by Alan
Silvestri. Written and directed by Stephen Sommers. PG-13.</P>
<P> The Mummy Returns is like the desperate comedian who machine guns joke
after joke because he needs his fix of laughter like a junkie needs his
fix of heroin.</P>
<P> This express train-paced sequel to the hit of a couple of years ago
piles thrill upon thrill and special effect upon special effect until
the audience nearly overdoses. As the final reel unspools you want to
stand up and shout, ìEnough already!î</P>
<P> The Mummy Returns, at about two and 10 minutes, is relentless, never
giving the viewer a chance to catch a breath.</P>
<P> Set in 1933, this sequel reunites all the main characters from the
original: soldier of fortune Rick OíConnell (Brendan Fraser), the brainy
Egyptologist Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), now Mrs. OíConnell, her
neíer-do-well brother, Jonathan (John Hannah) and the evil high priest
mummy Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo).</P>
<P> The movieís plot is a bit complicated, dealing with several Egyptian
relics that, in the wrong hands, will unleash the forces of darkness
upon the world. Donít they always.</P>
<P> Added to the mix is popular wrestling figure The Rock as The Scorpion
King, an evil warrior who has promised his soul to the dread god Anubis
in exchange for military might.</P>
<P> Well, old Anubis took The Scorpion King and put him in charge of his
army of darkness.</P>
<P> But now itís the Year of the Scorpion, and guess who is planning on
making a comeback.</P>
<P> One interesting note about the feature: The Rock has been played up
very prominently is publicity about the film, yet his appearance is
rather brief and he barely utters a line. This is something like
bait-and-switch, so for those going to see this mainly for The Rock, be
warned.</P>
<P> Another new character ó and the one who nearly steals the film ó is
Rick and Evelynís brainy 8-year-old son, Alex (Freddie Boath). Heís a
precocious little chap, who could have been rather obnoxious.
But director Stephen Sommers, who also wrote the script, takes such a
tongue-in-cheek attitude to the entire affair that you donít mind the
kidís wisecracks.</P>
<P> The Mummy Returns is a fast-food movie; you view it, are entertained
and leave. It has no lasting impression. Itís a quick stimulation.
Nothing profound, nothing deep.</P>
<P> Just cheap excitement, lots of stunts, lots of special effects ó some
of the computer generated images, though, are rather obvious ó and loads
of action.</P>
<P> Is The Mummy Returns a good movie? No. But it does deliver what the
audience for this type of  outing wants ó a mindless rush that allows
you to put your brain in neutral for about 130 minutes.</P>
<P> You donít critique performances in a movie like this because they are
secondary. Anyone could have played these roles and it wonít have made
an iota of difference.</P>
<P> The Mummy Returns is the clarion call for the summer movie season; that
time of year when movies are long, loud and simplistic to a fault.</P>
<P> So buckle up, summer is on the horizon and The Mummy Returns has just
jump-started the cinematic tour bus.</P>
