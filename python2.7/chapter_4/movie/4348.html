<PRE>(* out of four)</PRE>
<P>     I'm really starting to wonder about Alicia Silverstone.  Sure, she
is one of the most beautiful creatures on God's green earth (second
only to that Movie Critic at LARGE guy), but when it comes to choosing
what movies she stars in, she always strikes out.  The Crush was a
slow-moving, predictable piece of fluff.  Hideaway was a horrific novel
adaptation Alicia had only a minor role in.  CLUELESS was an annoying,
unfunny waste of time.  And people have e-mailed me too, saying
CLUELESS is a good movie and that I'm the only one who doesn't like
it.  One girl said if I'd seen the movie with "an open mind," I would
have enjoyed it.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I went into
the theater expecting to love the movie.  The preview looked good and of
course I'm crazymadinlove with Alicia, but the movie was a bunch of bad
jokes coming from whiny, unlikable characters.  Almost everyone I saw
the movie with felt the same way.  When we were walking out of the
theater, one guy (and it wasn't me) yelled out, "That was the worst
f$&#in' movie I've ever seen" and the rest of us had to laugh in
agreement.</P>
<P>     So last night I walked into the video store and saw Alicia's
pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called The
Babysitter.  I knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion I'll
probably never understand made me rent it anyway.  What I got was 90
minutes of regret--the worst Alicia Silverstone movie ever.  And you
already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like.</P>
<P>     Where to begin in criticizing this movie? The plot is a thin shred
that moves slower than a glacier, the writing could have been done (and
for all we know it was) by a ten year old, Alicia is the star and she's
still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever.  There is zero
humor, zero suspense, zero drama and zero action, until the last ten
minutes, when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a
violent sequence.  Zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero.  So
why does this movie get one star out of me? Well, Alicia spends twenty
minutes of the movie in the bathtub.  And if it wasn't bubble bath, The
Babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four-
star features, but you settle for what you can get.</P>
<P>     Alicia plays a babysitter who's spending Friday night looking
after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail
party.  And of course anyone as beautiful as Alicia automatically
spends their Friday nights at home (at least that Movie Critic at LARGE
guy does).  As the movie trods along, we discover she's not only the
mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male
character's fantasies (and probably every male viewer's too).  The
drunken father thinks she's just the thing to recapture his lost youth,
her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on Alicia from
outside, even the prepubescent boy looks in on Alicia through the
bathroom keyhole while she's taking her bubble bath.  They even throw
in the middle aged wife's fantasies about a male counterpart at the
party.  Not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this
200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy.</P>
<P>     At least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the
PG-rated.  In fact, I could imagine THE BABYSITTER becoming a Cinemax
late-night staple if not for the fact that there's absolutely no nudity
in it.  So you can't call it a sex flick.  I've already pointed out
that it can't fall under drama, comedy, thriller or action, so what do
you classify THE BABYSITTER as?  Bad.</P>
