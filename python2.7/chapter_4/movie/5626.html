<PRE>                           THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1972) *1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        The crown jewel of 1970's Irwin Allen disaster movies, 
THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE features an all-star cast including 
Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine spouting some of the most 
laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a 
cruise ship. The story begins on the U.S.S. Poseidon's big New 
Year's cruise, where we are introduced to the ensemble of people 
who will soon be the only passengers left alive.</P>
<P>        Let's see, there's the New Age preacher (Hackman) who 
advises people to "pray to that part of God within yourself." 
There's the ex-cop (Borgnine) who busted a hooker (Stella Stevens) 
six times -- then married her. There's the hippie singer ("There's got 
to be a morning after...") who turns to the company of a lonely man 
(Red Buttons) once her brother is killed. And to round out the 
group: the elderly couple (Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters) 
who live aboard the ship, the beautiful teenage girl and her brother 
who are sailing alone and adventurous Scotsman Roddy 
McDowall.</P>
<P>        We get to know these people a little too well in the first 
thirty minutes of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, before straight-
faced ship captain Leslie Nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal 
wave headed right for the ship. Everyone's in the giant ballroom at 
the time, shortly past midnight of the new year, when the ship 
turns first on its side, then completely upside down. The second-
in-command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help 
arrives, but rebel Hackman leads his small band of followers on 
a quest to the top of the ship.</P>
<P>        In this case, because the ship is overturned, the top is the 
bottom. Or is the bottom the top? Either way, we get to see a lot of 
bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both 
conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera 
shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and -- in the ballroom 
scene -- Christmas trees. Thus begins an hour or more of hushed 
trips down long corridors, through burning rooms, etc. while the 
ship slowly fills with water behind them.</P>
<P>        It's a race against the clock which is only mildly 
interesting. THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE works more as a Bad 
Movie To Laugh At, with all the melodrama that comes in-between 
the non-thrilling action scenes. The one note in Borgnine's one-note 
performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with Hackman 
every step of the way while Buttons and the hippie fall in love 
(although since there isn't a sex scene, we never find out if his 
buttons really are Red) and Albertson and Winters wonder if 
they'll live to see their grandson's birth.</P>
<P>        Shelley Winters provides the most hilarious scene in the 
movie in a scene toward the end, where water has flooded the next 
two rooms of the ship and Hackman is preparing to dive under with 
a rope for the rest of them to pull along. Winters, who has been the 
whiny fat woman throughout the movie (Stevens even not-so-
affectionately calls her "fatass" in one scene), finally finds her 
purpose. "I was the underwater swimming champ of New York 
three years running when I was seventeen," she brags, and before 
Hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three 
years, she's swimming through the water, her skirt billowing up 
around her hips, showing off her cellulite (or do you call it 
Shellulite?) ridden thighs. It's not so much funny as innately 
disgusting, which pretty much sums up THE POSEIDON 
ADVENTURE as a whole.</P>
