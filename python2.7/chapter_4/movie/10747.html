<P>PHANTOMS(Miramax)
 Author Dean Koontz got a lot of press three years ago when he roundly
bashed the screen adaptation of his best-seller "Hideaway," and his
criticisms were justified: "Hideaway" was a lurid mess that squandered
the talents of Jeff Goldblum and Alicia Silverstone. But before someone
hires Koontz as a film critic, let it be noted that he's gone on the
record praising the filmization of  his novel "Phantoms," a movie so
dull and mechanical it makes "Hideaway" look like "Silence of the
Lambs." Combining all the worst tendencies of contemporary horror films
into one slimy package, "Phantoms" isn't even an effective gross-out,
with some of the most un-special effects to soil the screen in a long,
long time.
 The real horror here is Koontz's pathetic dialogue ("Are you okay, 'cuz
I need you to be okay, alright?" is one of his more inspired lines) and
illogical story. "Phantoms" starts off like that classic "Twilight Zone"
episode in which a man wandered through an empty town and kept finding
evidence that someone had just been there, even though he couldn't see
or hear any other people. But Koontz isn't interested in mystery, he
wants to peddle gratuitous gore and highfalutin hoodoo about
soul-sapping demons who periodically visit the Earth to digest everyone
in a remote, isolated area, be it the Roanoke Colony in 16th-century
Virginia, the ancient Mayan cities, or, in this case, everyone in sleepy
Snowfield, a hamlet in the Rockies.
 When sisters Lisa (Rose McGowan) and Jennifer (Joanna Going) realize
they're the only ones left in town, they don't go on a looting spree in
the business district. They go looking for trouble instead, stumbling
upon several decapitated bodies and gruesome remains in the process.
Sheriff Hammond (Ben Affleck) and his weirdo deputy Stu (Liev Schreiber)
show up to help investigate the mystery, which grows more tedious --and
ridiculous-- by the minute. Frequently, our heroes receive phone calls
from the evil  forces; it's a sad sight to see gifted actors like
Affleck and Going standing around and trying their best to look
terrified by what sounds like a malfunctioning car wash. A
ghastly-looking Peter O'Toole also shows up to embarass himself as a
scholar-turned-tabloid-journalist who makes such dramatic prouncements
as "It's chaos! Chaos in the flesh!" while struggling stay on his feet
during his scenes.
 Some comedies are so funny you forget to laugh; "Phantoms" is so scary
you'll forget to scream. You will, however, do a lot of yawning and
perhaps some unintended giggling before the pointless, badly staged
finale in which the "Ancient Enemy" that everyone's been babbling about
for the past hour and a half reveals itself  to be little more than an
oversized version of the old Ajax "White Tornado." The appropriate
response to "Phantoms" is a long, loud "Boooooo!".</P>
