Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</P>
<P>     Few filmmakers in the last twenty years have so consistently had
so little to say as loudly as Oliver Stone.  By pairing up his
single-note self-righteousness with cinematic histrionics, Stone has
managed to create a controversial body of work which dazzles with its
visual inventiveness even as it clubs you insensible with its strident
moralizing.  NATURAL BORN KILLERS is the natural culmination of this
style/message schism, a gutsy and gaudy assault on the senses that
forgets to bring along a single original or insightful thought.  Even
the dynamic performances of Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis can't
salvage this busy mess.</P>
<P>     Harrelson and Lewis star as Mickey and Mallory Knox, a pair of
happy-go-lucky lovebirds who happen to be in the middle of a massive
killing spree when first we meet them.  Both are the result of deeply
dysfunctional families, and with little moral awareness they cut a path
of death through the Southwest.  Eventually they are captured, and
become the objects of a media frenzy and a cult of personality.  Most
eager to cash in on this fame is Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.) the
hose of a tabloid television program called "American Maniacs."  He
sets up a live interview with Mickey on Super Bowl Sunday, destined to
be a ratings bonanza.  The one hitch in the plan is a riot at the
prison, which turns into a nationally televised bloodbath.</P>
<P>     The first hour of NATURAL BORN KILLERS is made watchable only by
the intensity of the two stars.  Woody Harrelson stretches himself as
never before, his simpleton charm connecting to a genuine amorality,
while Juliette Lewis takes her wounded white-trash act from KALIFORNIA
and runs with it, exploding at arbitrary moments into astonishing
ferocity.  But for all their sound and fury, Mickey and Mallory aren't
really characters.  They're ciphers, stick-figure representations of a
societal ill, and ciphers just aren't all that interesting.  The
technical flotsam and jetsam surrounding them can't disguise that fact,
and only the positively inspired segment casting Mallory's home life as
a twisted 1950s sitcom goes anywhere beneath the surface.  As it nears
its mid-point, Mickey and Mallory's road show becomes extremely
tedious.</P>
<P>     The prison-based second half of NATURAL BORN KILLERS is something
of an improvement, if only for the inclusion of some delightfully
bug-eyed acting by Tommy Lee Jones as the prison warden and Tom
Sizemore as the brutal cop who arrested Mickey and Mallory.  As
over-the-top as they are, they seem at least remotely grounded in
humanity, unlike our surreal chauffeurs through the netherworld.
Again, however, Stone falls victim to the One Obvious Idea syndrome.
"Look at what the media has done to us," he says with genuine shock
and, of course, superiority.  "Any of us could become like Mickey and
Mallory."  The problem is that it's the same idea that drove MAN BITES
DOG.  And KALIFORNIA.  And SERIAL MOM, for that matter.  And every one
of those films told the same story better, without pumping steroids
into the production.  There is no satire to the excesses of NATURAL
BORN KILLERS, because Oliver Stone has no idea how to achieve that
level of subtlety.  It's simply a freak show, and Stone comes off
looking like a colossal hypocrite attempting to cash in on exactly what
he spends two hours clucking his tongue at.</P>
<P>     If NATURAL BORN KILLERS had been made by any other director, I
might have given it grudging support simply for having the courage to
run to the limit in its audacious originality.  Unfortunately, I have
lost all patience with Stone's pedantry-as-art approach to filmmaking.
Compare the first hour of NATURAL BORN KILLERS with David Lynch's WILD
AT HEART, which leavened its shock value with a warped sense of humor
and simmering menace, and you'll see that what Stone attempted to
accomplish could have been done right.  Instead, NATURAL BORN KILLERS
is like getting a lecture from your parents during a particularly bad
acid trip.  You just want it to stop.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 natural born killers:  3.</PRE>
