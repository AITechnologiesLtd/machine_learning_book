<P>Wong Kar-Wai is in the middle of one of the most exciting periods of
sustained brilliance in some time. Although it would be sheer hyprbole
and, frankly, totally out of order to compare it to Godard in the 60's
I'm sure it won't be long before someone does. It was a relief to have
Happy Together land in the Ottawa region, particularly after being
denied the inestimable treat that is Fallen Angels (Wong Kar-Wai's
fourth film that never made it here).  The film has no doubt
benefitted from the 'Best Direction' accolade it earned at Cannes last
year.  Although, praised or not, there is really no need to look for
an excuse to show Wong's films. He is one of the most unique
filmmakers practicing today and has shown the ability and willingness
to transcend and challenge past triumphs. It would be easy to imagine
an interminable series of variations on Chungking Express's style and
technique but instead the director has treated it as one step in his
filmmaking. Some will argue that Fallen Angels disproves this, and
they may be right (though I would beg to differ) but the fact remains
that taken as a whole the filmmaker's canon (Days of Being Wild, Ashes
of Time) is void of redundancy.</P>
<P>    The film chronicles the trials and tribulations of a gay man whos
trip to Argentina with his partner has not turned out as planned. The
film is about their relationship: jealousy, ambiguity, hypocrisy and
sincerity. It is about travel: spontanaeity, discovery, adventure and
the unexpected. It is about Hong-Kong: It's limitlessness, isolation
and ambivalence. And it is about a million other things that I surly
missed altogether.</P>
<P>    This is only the most superficial layer of the film. It is
cursory, maybe even unimportant since Wong's and DOP Christopher
Doyle's off-balance style take center stage. Although the events and
situations in Wong's films are never banal or uninteresting the real
strength of the filmmaker is his abiltiy to appropriately employ every
facet of the medium. The photography in this film consists of murky
gray-scale scenes or sepia tinted, washed out colour. The colour is
controlled quite carefully with the sepia occasionally being replaced
by more natural skin tones as to create certain associations between
the state of the relationships shown. One effect of this
cinematography is a bewildering number of allusions emerging. The use
of sound in the film is equally complex: Wong has a predilection for
voiceover which is a device that can easily get annoying. It was used
expertly in Chungking. It's use in Happy Together, however, is
comparatively spare. The relative futility of spoken words is alluded
to by the repeated references to nature (the waterfall) and in the bar
scene in which Liu is asked to leave a message on a tape recorder and
can only muster sobs. In this way the confusion and difficulty of
expression that the protagonists seem to experience is mirrored by the
film's technique. This provides a very distinct tone compared to the
dismayed though rarely verbally challenged characters of Chungking
Express.</P>
<P>    The narrative technique used can best be descrtibed as
non-continuous.  It contains fragments, repetitions isolated musings
and coincidences. The film ends up feeling like a rough copy, however,
further inspection betrays this first impression. I am not sure why
but an event that should be little more than an awkward sledgehammer
beating of a point to death such as the Taiwanese friend's trip to the
'bottom of the world' seems eleagant in Wong's hands. Scenes that
could deceptively be passed off as filler like the repeated soccer
games with the many bumps, touches and glances that Liu throws his
Taiwanese friend speak volumes. And cruel coincidence that could feel
totally contrived such as the bathroom scene in which Liu resorts to
acts he has condemned earlier in the film feel absolutely perfect.
Perhaps it is because Wong places his emphasis in the right
places. There is no long deliberate scripting process (thought to be
essential for a well planned relatively low budget shoot) instead his
last three films were largely based on notes and sketches made on the
day of shooting. The result is a very specific spontanaeity to the
films. There are no heavy handed compositions or forced
symmetries. Instead the films seem to be the result of intuitively
collecting the right material and then rigorously editing it together.
I have already heaped enough praise on the results that these methods
yield.</P>
<P>    When so much cinema seems to be at pains to push the limits of
content: more violence, more nudity, more shock therapy Wong Kar-wai
seems much more interested in pushing the limits of how things are
said and told as opposed to what is told. On this basis, Happy
Together seems linked to Sokurov's Mother and Son. The two films are
negatives of each other that on first glance could not be more
different. Both films however, render wholly new methods of expression
positioning themselves well ahead of their peers and their time.  --
