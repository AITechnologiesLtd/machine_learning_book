                       A film review by Gregory N. Bond
                        Copyright 1993 Gregory N. Bond</PRE>
<P>(This has just opened in Australia - it may be old news for the rest
of you.)</P>
<P>     This film is basically a reworking of the film THE RETURN OF
MARTIN GUERRE which in turn taken from the book THE WIFE OF MARTIN
GUERRE, which in turn is a dramatisation of real court records dating
from the French 100 years war around A. D. 1350.  Rather than set in
medieval France, the setting is the southern United States just after
the end of the United States Civil War.  John Sommersby (Gere), an
apparently cruel and cold man and the richest man in the local area,
has gone off to the war.  He has been missing six years, and, just as
his wife (Foster) is preparing to remarry, a man who may or may not be
her husband returns to claim his wife, his property and the loyalty of
the local town.  He has obviously been changed by four years in a
prison camp; his wife finds the new Mr. Sommersby a much more
attractive person and falls in love with him in a way she never had
before he went to war.  The film climaxes in a court case where
Sommersby is charged with a murder committed some time earlier.  Should
he be proved to *not* be Sommersby he would get off, otherwise he will
hang.  Is he really Sommersby? Would he pretend not to be in order to
get off?  Will he prove he is and die?</P>
<P>     This film is in large part a story of the (re-)discovered romance
between Foster and Gere.  The crux of the film is the uncertainty
around the identity of Gere's character.  Both leads handle the strong
ambiguity in the relationship well, and the developing affection is
well told.  The audience is not absolutely certain whether Gere is or
is not the actual Sommersby until the end (although the hints are
pretty obvious).  It is this ambiguity that gives the film its power
and appeal.  The final court case, where the questions of loyalty,
love, betrayal and identity are exposed, is powerfully moving.</P>
<P>     Acting from the supporting cast is excellent, including James Earl
Jones as the judge in the climactic court case.  Gere, despite his
reputation, succeeds in conveying the pain, the turmoil and the
ambiguity.  We the audience really feel for his character and
understand his motives in the final scenes (quite unexpected from
Hollywood, and potentially very unconvincing).  Foster is brilliant in
conveying the love, the doubt, the faith.  Also very impressive is the
photography - the landscapes, the scenery is spectacular.  Go and see
it on the wide screen; much of the impact will be lost on the video.</P>
<P>     One thing that was definitely surprising was the audience
reaction.  One of the witnesses in the court case is a true son of the
south and a "nigger-hater."  He insults the (black) judge and gets sixty
days in "our sadly uncomfortable correctional facility."  At that
point, the whole audience cheered and clapped.  Obviously, we're all
very Politically Correct.</P>
<PRE>Rating:  On a scale of 1-10, I give it a B+.  Go and see it on the
wide screen.</PRE>
<PRE>[Spoilers follow]</PRE>
<P>     Unlike (I believe) the original story, where the real Guerre turns
up in the court case and it all ends in an anticlimax, the real
Sommersby is dead (buried during the opening credits), and the imposter
admits it to his wife.  This is after he has proved to the judge that
he is the real Sommersby, and been sentenced to hang.  And, bugger me
dead, he is actually hung.  This came as a bit of a shock, as I
expected the usual Hollywood happy-ever-after ending, and was (in the
back of my mind) considering how they might get out of the developing
situation.  To the credit of the director (British, not American!), he
stuck to the artistically correct ending and wasn't pressured into
diluting it, and the film is much more powerful because of it.  And
despite expectations, the end is actually quite uplifting, thanks in no
small part to the strength of Gere's acting in portraying the noble
nature of a liar and cheat grappling with honesty and love for the
first time.</P>
