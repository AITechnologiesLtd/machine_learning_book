<PRE>BY AARON MICHAELS</PRE>
<P>Analyze This stars Robert De Niro and Chazz Palminteri who have both
used up a good amount of their film careers playing mobsters. It just
seems to be the characters they are offered. This time around they get
to put a little satire into the mix to produce one funny mobster
picture.</P>
<P>Ben Sobol (Billy Crystal) is a psychiatrist who is having a tough time
in life. He can't stand how pathetic and uninteresting the people who
come to his office are. His son spends all his time listening in on his
conferences with the patients also. The only bright spot in his life is
his upcoming marriage to his girlfriend Laura (Lisa Kudrow).</P>
<P>Don Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) is also having a tough time. He is
having problems with anxiety attacks and crying at sappy TV commercials.
This is horrible because people can't be afraid of a crying mobster. He
calls upon Ben to cure him. This messes up Ben's wedding plans and turns
his life
upside down.</P>
<P>Robert De Niro does a wonderful job playing his usual mobster character
with a twist. His crying scenes caught me very off guard and got quite a
few laughs. Billy Crystal also does a good job and redeems himself after
My Giant and City Slickers 2: The Search For Curly's Gold.</P>
<P>Director/Co-Writer Harold Ramis does a fine job highlighting many scenes
and not over doing them. He has done this before with the very good
pictures Groundhog Day and Caddyshack. Other directors would have
overused the comedy or gangster parts of the movie and seem lopsided,
but Ramis balances them very well. The pacing of the film is also very
well done and the film is over before you know it.</P>
<P>The film does however overuse a couple of scenes dealing with the FBI
trying to track down Vitti. This type of sub-plot has been used over and
over again for a long time. Also the film, although has a good many
solid laughs, isn't hysterically funny like Ramis past pictures. Maybe
it was hard to make
more fun of the mobster business though.</P>
<P>Analyze This is a fine comedy that, although a little predictable at
times, does offer some comedy greats teaming together and is quite
enjoyable.</P>
