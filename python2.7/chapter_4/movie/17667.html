THE BIRDS (**** out of ******)</PRE>
<PRE>A review from the Stockholm Film Review
<A HREF="http://www.reviewfilm.com/">http://www.reviewfilm.com/</A> </PRE>
<P>A beautiful socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) arrives 
in the small town of Bodega Bay, ostensibly to deliver two 
lovebirds to someone. While out on a boat, she is attacked 
by a gull. She meets up with Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) with 
whom she had a previous encounter in San Francisco. He invites 
her to his young sister Catherine's (Veronica Cartwright) 
birthday party the next day. She seeks out lodging in the 
nearby home of Annie Heyworth (Suzanne Pleshette). That night, 
a bird smashes against a window. At the party the next day, a 
flock of bird descend on the children and attack them.</P>
<P>Alfred Hitchcock made The Birds in 1963, arguably at the height 
of his fame. His three previous pictures were Psycho (1960), 
North by Northwest (1959) and Vertigo (1958), and during the 
Fifties, he also made Dial M for Murder (1954), Rear Window 
(1954) and To Catch a Thief (1955). It seemed that he could 
master any genre to which he turned his attention; suspense, 
horror, comedy, romance or a mixture of all. He was fascinated 
with the dark consequences of apparently minor human failings. 
In Psycho, white-collar crook Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) pays 
the ultimate price as a result of her theft, while the seemingly 
innocuous habit of bored invalid Jeff Jeffries (James Stewart) 
leads him to a very dark place indeed in Rear Window. Hitchcock's 
work could be light and humorous (To Catch a Thief) but he preferred 
his comedy black (The Trouble with Harry) or even macabre. He 
used romance to explore the obsessive (and therefore disturbing) 
side of love, such as Vertigo and, in a perverse way, Psycho. 
The Birds shares many of Hitchcock's trademarks. It is a horror 
story but the cause of the horror is so banal, so ordinary, that 
nobody can believe it to be true. It is also a tale of obsession. 
Mitch Brenner is a highly successful lawyer and very eligible 
bachelor but spends most of his weekends at home with his possessive 
mother Lydia (Jessica Tandy). He is powerful and self-confident, 
and is surrounded by women who care for him. Aside from his mother, 
Annie Heyworth, Melissa's landlady for the weekend, was once Mitch's 
girlfriend, and moved from San Francisco to Bodega Bay just to be 
near him, after they broke up. Melissa is also attracted to Mitch, 
and her errand of love-birds is merely an excuse to meet him again.</P>
<P>Even though Melissa makes a good impression on Mitch, she receives a 
much cooler reception from his mother Lydia. She finds out that 
Annie's relationship with Mitch had cooled only after his mother 
had voiced her disapproval of her. Melissa is beautiful, rich and 
famous and has led a privileged existence, but feels trapped in the 
glare of the public eye (much like the caged lovebirds she has 
brought to Bodega Bay). </P>
<P>The psychological elements of the story are consigned to the background 
once the bird attacks begin. There is no real attempt to explain why the 
birds turn nasty, though there is a suggestion that perhaps the caged 
lovebirds may be the source of the problem. It is this element of the 
story that has dated badly. One can only imagine the gleeful sequences 
Hitchcock would have devised if he had the benefit of 1990's special 
effect technology.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, many of bird scenes are chilling, particularly when they 
gather silently at a school playground before attacking the 
schoolchildren. Indeed, Hitchcock anticipates by decades big-budget 
horror movies of the Seventies (such as Swarm) and also sci-fi movies 
such as the Alien series and Jurassic Park. (Of course, Hitchcock was 
cleverly updating the familiar scenario of the Western, by substituting 
Mitch and the others for the embattled homesteaders and normally 
harmless 
birds for ferocious Indians). In fact, there is a direct link between 
The Birds and Alien, since Veronica Cartwright plays a screaming (and 
for the most part, fleeing) character in both movies.</P>
<P>Despite Hitchcock's skill, The Birds is not one of his better movies, 
though memorable nevertheless. Neither Taylor nor Hedren are 
particularly 
strong leading characters. Taylor's character should exude power and 
charm, but comes across as bland. Tippi Hedren made her debut here as 
a leading lady but doesn't measure up when compared to previous 
Hitchcock female leads, like Grace Kelly and Kim Novak. Some of the 
action is a bit hokum too. In the history of hysterical leading ladies 
doing something stupid to advance the story, Tippi deserves an 
honourable mention. In one scene, she opens a door slightly to glance 
inside, screams in fright when she sees it is full 
of birds, and then manages to fall inside the room, so that her body 
blocks the door. I suspect an unfinished page in the script. There is 
also a bizarre scene with an ornithologist who just appears to 
order to reel off a list of statistics about birds. It is also difficult 
to overlook the creaking special effects - both the super-imposed and 
the mechanical birds are not very realistic. Now, if Gus Van Sant had 
decided to re-make The Birds with state-of-the-art special effects and 
strong leading roles, instead of messing around with a masterpiece 
(Psycho), he might have actually done something useful.</P>
<P>Directed by Alfred Hitchcock.
