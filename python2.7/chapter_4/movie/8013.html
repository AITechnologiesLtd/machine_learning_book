<PRE>                             ADDICTED TO LOVE
                       A film review by Marty Mapes
                        Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) Romantic comedies are often hard to differentiate. You
might think that a great romantic comedy would need something special
to set it apart -- a great gimmick that works well on film, funny
scenes, and great chemistry. Of these attributes, Addicted to Love only
lacks great chemistry.</P>
<P>Goes to show how important that attribute is.</P>
<P>Sam the astronomer (Matthew Broderick) tries to keep his girlfriend
Linda (Kelly Preston) from leaving their small hometown for New York
City. But she feels constricted by small town life and leaves anyway.
Sam waits for Linda to come back, but she doesn't return. Instead she
sends him a "Dear John" letter.</P>
<P>Sam doesn't take being dumped lightly, so he sets off for New York in
search of Linda.</P>
<P>He finds her with her new boyfriend and he watches them through the
window. He discovers that the apartment across the street is abandoned
so he makes a nest.  He orders a few spare parts from his observatory
and lines all the pieces up just right so that his camera obscura
projects what's happening across the street onto the big back wall of
the abandoned apartment.</P>
<P>In an inspired moment of great filmmaking, Sam "paints" Linda on the
wall. The projected image from the camera obscura is muted because the
wall is brown.  Sam starts painting the wall silvery white, following
Linda's virtual image around her apartment. Each time she moves, Sam
follows, leaving a trail of reflected light where he goes.</P>
<P>Maggie (Meg Ryan) moves into Sam's nest without telling him who she is
or what she's doing. Turns out that Maggie's ex-boyfriend (Anton,
played by Tcheky Karyo) is seeing Sam's ex-girlfriend. Maggie has
chosen Sam's nest as the best place to bug and monitor Anton's
apartment.</P>
<P>Between Sam's and Maggie's equipment, they have picture and sound: a
live-action movie of their ex-significant others.</P>
<P>Though Sam's motives are pathetic and Maggie's are spiteful, they find
they have a common goal -- breaking up Anton and Linda -- Sam, so he
can reunite with Linda, and Maggie, so she can revel in her revenge.</P>
<P>Most of their schemes are funny, and the movie is full of great lines.
One scene has Maggie and Sam watching Anton and Linda with the sound
off, while Maggie and Sam supply running comedy a la Mystery Science
Theater 3000.</P>
<P>If you've seen the previews (or if you know the genre) you already know
how it inevitably must end. Actually, the movie ends much more kindly
and humanely than it could have, but really there are no surprises.</P>
<P>Overall, the movie was enjoyable, and it's hard to fault it for
anything in particular.  Mostly, the problem is that Sam and Maggie
lack chemistry. Most of the time, they don't need it, but eventually,
it becomes important. (It's hard to imagine Broderick having
"chemistry" with anyone.)</P>
<P>But even with everything this movie did right, it just doesn't add up
to greatness.</P>
<P>P.S. you might be glad to know the title song never played over the
movie.  Frankly, the title seems like an afterthought. But a rose by
any other name . . . .</P>
