<P>   During the sixties a popular notion among acolytes of the
student left was that so-called insane people are not insane
at all: that the society which in the Twentieth Century brought
us two world wars, a holocaust, genocidal "cleansings" of
Armenians and Bosnians and Serbs and Rwandans among
others, and assorted cruelties on a more intimate, family
level, is the party which is guilty of being thoroughly
demented.  On a less dramatic note, psychologists like
Wilhelm Reich and perhaps most others in that field even
today stress the concept that in a defensive world in which
people guard their emotions as tightly as do nations in their
paranoia, love is difficult to find.  Wim Wenders, known to
American audiences most notably for his surreal, lyric fairy
tale "Wings of Desire," is down to earth this time around and
has hooked up with an ensemble of performers you'd not
expect to find in a small, character-driven work like this.  By
focussing the action in and around a Los Angeles hotel that
was the trendy place during the 1920s but has since become
an occupant of skid row, he contrasts a bizarre bunch of
tenants--uninsured mental cases all--with an FBI agent so
uptight that he metaphorically displays his stiffness by
wearing a brace that extends from his neck down to his lower
back.  While juxtaposing the story of an unconventional
romance with an investigation into the possible murder of one
of the hotel's residents, Wenders attempts to demonstrate an
array of themes from the age-old difficulty of our species to
communicate, the view that lunacy is simply a product of
society's beliefs that fluctuates according to time and place,
and that the Great Truths come from the mouths of so-called
disturbed people whose defenses are weak and who are
therefore able to spot verities that "sane" people cannot. 
That Wenders does not succeed in his mission should take
no credit away from the noteworthy director. We are regularly
inundated with formulaic, banal films churned out by
Hollywood committees and need the challenges that Wenders
and others of his ilk provides for us.  His willingness to take
risks and fail--as he does in this case because of a
threadbare plot and irritating characters unable to support the
weight of his arguments--makes him a better man than the
box-office driven suits who play their cards straight and
thereby guarantee by-the-numbers hokum.</P>
<P>   The hotel of the title is inhabited by a cross-section of
down-and-out Americans in much the style of Lanford
Wilson's Hot L Baltimore, each with a specific idiosyncracy
that makes him or her lovable or annoying.  The most
amusing of all, Dixie (Peter Stormare), looks and attempts to
sing like John Lennon and claims to have been the Beatles'
songwriter: if you listen closely to his gibberish you might find
some kernels of insight.  While he rarely if ever leaves his
room, Geronimo (Jimmy Smits) by contrast is an American
Indian who is look to make a killing by selling some paintings
allegedly completed by one Izzy (Tim Roth), the victim of
murder or suicide, a rich man's (Harris Yulin) son who was
either pushed or fell from the roof of the hotel.  With FBI
Special Agent Skinner (Mel Gibson) patronizing the tenants to
discover the truth behind the presumed crime, a romance
unfolds between the retarded Tom Tom (Jeremy Davies) and
the introspective intellectual, Eloise (Milla Jovovich), who
hides behind a book because she thinks she is nothing.  </P>
<P>   The hotel's derelicts at times prove not so different from
the respectable folks in the "sane" world.  They meet in the
hotel lobby to exploit the death of the painter and evoke the
interest of the media in the paintings which the dead man had
produced--tar pictures, actually, huge smudges of black which
have suddenly become trendy and have brought fame,
media, and beautiful people to the now celebrated lodging.</P>
<P>   Two turnabouts are striking.  In one situation FBI Agent
Skinner, whose naked back displays a gruesome series of
stitches as though the man had been taken apart like a
character in a David Cronenberg film, realizes that he is as
much a freak as the tenants of the hotel.  This leads him to
make a startling decision: to protect the person who later
confesses to the crime rather than add a notch to his resume
by making the arrest.  At about the same time Eloise has
made a sharp recovery, tossing aside her books and
behaving like a thoroughly standard woman open to love.</P>
<P>   The film, unfortunately, is unconvincing in cementing its
argument that 'tis folly to be sane if the whole world is
insane.  Wenders gives the impression that when the
pressure is on, these loony tunes can meet and vote
democratically on how they will deal with the death of one of
their own and the investigation that the tragedy evokes.  This
is a "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" that is unable
successfully to dramatize the triumph of the human spirit as
did Milos Forman in his adaptation of Ken Kesey's
masterwork.  Listening to these people prattle on and
watching the St. Vitus-Dance antics of Jeremy Davies in the
role of Tom-Tom is an exericise in tedium.</P>
