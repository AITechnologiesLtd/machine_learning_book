<PRE>                                  HIGHER LEARNING
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1995 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Written and directed by John Singleton
Starring: Jennifer Connelly, Ice Cube, Omar Epps, Kristy Swanson,
          Laurence Fishburne
Title sequence by Elaine and Saul Bass</P>
<P>     Everyone in HIGHER LEARNING has the same first name.  It's "The."
There's The Athlete, The Black Activist, The Stern Professor, The
Lesbian Feminist,  The Skinhead and The Clueless  Blonde.  Except the
professor, everybody belongs to organized campus groups.  The
advertisement for the film points to the main problem with the film.
There is a totem pole like object with the actor's faces superimposed
onto icons- a swastika, a black power fist,  a double-female lesbian
symbol plus others..  This is topped by a gun.  The actors are not
people but walking sets of values.  The gun alerts us that the values
will be in conflict.</P>
<P>     One of the best things about the film is Saul (PSYCHO) Bass's
pulsating title sequence set to Shaft-like music.  The energy rapidly
dissipates when the film cuts to a too obviously staged pep rally.  You
can imagine an assistant director off screen yelling,"OK now, everybody
chant in unison."  An obviously set-up quality plagues much of the
film, both visually and narratively.  The prop statue of Columbus at
the fictitious Columbus University oddly kept reminding me of the
"Knowledge is Good" sign in ANIMAL HOUSE.</P>
<P>     HIGHER LEARNING does get going eventually.  A protracted series of
small conflicts over music and roommate manners leads to more
substantive issues.  Once the characters are established, several of
them do become interesting, if not entirely credible.John Singleton did
give an amount of depth to his iconic characters.  They do more than
just espouse their party lines.  Even one of the neo-Nazi skinheads
shows some evidence of having thought through the things he believes
in.  When characters discuss similar topics among their own groups, the
lack of common ground among these ideologies becomes clear.</P>
<P>     Kristy Swanson (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER) is in a group called
something like Students for a Non-Sexist Society.  Men are not allowed
to join.  When a man asks if that isn't sexist, he is treated as if he
is dense to suggest that.  Obviously it is a women's issue and a
women's group.  Singleton has his actors underplay the scene.  It
becomes a casual boy-meets-girl scene, more sweet than pointed.  Groups
that state their purpose as unity but only let a narrow group join do
abound on college campuses.</P>
<P>     Best among the ensemble cast is Laurence (DEEP COVER) Fishburne.
The character of the highly educated and Jamaican accented political
science teacher is a big departure from his typical cop and hoodlum
roles.  Through many years of teaching, he has seen it all and heard it
all.  I suspect that billing for the film was alphabetical since top
billed Jennifer Connelly (CREEPERS) was only a few scenes.  The film
stereotype for feminists is often an angry bitter woman with a bad
haircut.  Connelly gives us something quite different.  She is a gentle
and supportive character, relaxed with her friends and at peace with
the world.  Of all the students, she is the one that comes off most as
real person.  In a larger role, Ice Cube (BOYZ N THE HOOD) shows a
talent for both comedy and drama.  Unfortunately he is surrounded by a
less interesting collection of followers, and has one too many
confrontations with the racist University Police.</P>
<P>     Much of the story development is too obvious.  When a character
gets a leaflet warning about a crime problem on campus, that person
becomes a victim of that crime the very next day.  The Black activists
and the neo-Nazis are on an obvious collision course.  Singleton tries
to create a SHORT CUTS like world where people's offhand actions affect
others in unforeseen and unknown ways, but the world is too tightly
connected.  Out of 33.000 students, the core group of a dozen
characters has way too much effect on eachother.  HIGHER LEARNING
should have been another DO THE RIGHT THING, but it winds up as a
warmed over SCHOOL DAZE.  Still, with more and more Hollywood films
about absolutely nothing, credit should be given to John Singleton for
making a film about relevant ideas in our society.  Several excellent
performances and some thought provoking writing make the film worth
seeing.</P>
<P>     I would like to recommend a somewhat better and quite overlooked
film that examines the forces in society by juggling a microcosm of
people,  John Sayles' CITY OF HOPE.</P>
