<P>Erin Brockovich (2000) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Julia Roberts and
Albert Finney. Written by Susannah Grant. Directed by Steven Soderbergh.</P>
<P> "Erin Brockovich" is like watching a master magician perform: You know
you're being hoodwinked, nevertheless, you find it entertaining.</P>
<P> Erin Brockovich is a free spirit. How do you know? She wears halter
tops and mini skirts, curses like a sailor and elicits disapproving
glances from the uptight people around her.</P>
<P> How do we know these people are uptight. Because they wear starchy
clothes, they're not perfectly built and they work in a law office.</P>
<P> Catch my drift. "Erin Brockovich" is an enjoyable David vs. Goliath
story, only this David is a twice-divorced mother with three little
kids. But beneath its glossy veneer, this based-on-a-true-story feature
appears smug, sanctimonious, self-righteous and pandering.</P>
<P> I'm not saying that's all bad. All movies try to manipulate your
emotions, that's what good films are supposed to do. But "Erin
Brockovich" does it in such a contemptuous style. It's like the magician
daring the audience to guess the secret of the trick.</P>
<P> You may still feel you are being entertained, but at the same time you
almost feel as if you were being held in contempt.</P>
<P> Julia Roberts' Erin Brockovich is a kindred spirit to Sally Field's
Norma Rae and Meryl Streep's Karen Silkwood - with a bit of Cher's biker
mom from "Mask "tossed in.</P>
<P> That is she's not an educated person in the classical sense, but she is
a smart woman who knows right from wrong and has a built-in b.s.
detector. Roberts' Erin usually fails to see any gray area. Things are
either yes or no, black or white.
Lawyers and the legal system in general merely complicate the world and 
muddle clear-cut issues of morality. Thus, Erin Brockovich is a very
proletarian movie.</P>
<P> Yet Roberts cuts through all this baggage. She is the movie, a true
film star whom the camera loves, a young woman who holds the screen and
draws you to her.
There's a cliché about someone being good enough to sell ice to eskimos.
That's Roberts, especially when she flashes that multimillion dollar
smile. You forget all the movie's manipulations, everything that is
bogus about "Erin Brockovich" and just melt in her personality.</P>
<P> The rest of the cast? Well, there basically props, furniture off which
Roberts plays. Even Albert Finney as the gruff, pragmatic Ed Masry, the
head of the law firm at which Erin works as a filing clerk, is putty
when up against this human dynamo.</P>
<P> The story, oh yea, I almost forgot. Erin, when filing some papers for
her boss, uncovers a cover-up by massive Pacific Gas & Electric
involving contaminated water in a nearby community.</P>
<P> She rallies and bands together those affected by PG&E's actions and
through her tenacity and dedication - and some legal expertise from her
boss - wins them a massive settlement.</P>
<P> If only screenwriter Susannah Grant and director Steven Soderbergh had
had the same determination as Erin to let the story tell itself without
resorting to smoke and mirrors.</P>
