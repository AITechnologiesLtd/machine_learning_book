<PRE>MANHATTAN (1979)

<P>Very few films can make you laugh and care about the characters at the same
time, Woody Allen's "Manhattan" has both in spades. A brilliant tale of a
contemporary neurotic in the romanticized world of Manhattan. The contrast
is as clear cut as Gordon Willis's magnificent black and white
cinematography. With Gershwin blasting in the background, we follow the life
of would be writer Isaac (Allen) Davis as he and his friends clumsily bumble
around each other trying to find the right key of happiness. The problem for
Isaac and his pseudo-sophisticated friends is that they think they earned
the answer to the secret to life because they can dissect art and drive
convertibles. A healthy relationship however, still alludes them.</P>
<P>Allen is in rare form as he puts on the balancing act of his questionable
career moves, underage (Hemingway) girlfriend, lesbian ex-wife (Streep), and
a rendevous with his best (only?) friends mistress (Keaton). The plot is so
seamless it almost seems unrehearsed, a tribute to Allen as he masters his
insecurity shtick but never relies on it to get him through a scene. Isaac
is dating 17 year old mature for her age Tracy, but recognizes his
insecurities and refuses to commit to what she wants -- a serious
relationship. Isaac pushes her away because subconsciously he wants to
escape this kind of life. Very soon after that, his best friend, Michael,
introduces him to his mistress Mary so he can go back and live happily ever
after with his wife. The male characters essentially use each other to clear
their collective conscious. But it doesn't work, it can't work, not in this
world with these characters. Isaac almost knows to begin with that he can't
be happy, but goes through the appearance of striving for it anyway. Mary,
played so wonderfully by Diane Keaton is so insecure that she needs men like
Isaac and Michael to justify her existence in the world of higher culture.</P>
<P>There's a famous scene in "Manhattan" with a still shot of the 59th street
bridge. It's beautiful and perfect, almost too perfect to be used in a movie
with characters so undeserving. As they take us through their daily routine
of savvy dinners racquetball clubs and museums we begin to discover that
there's less to admire about this kind of life and more to pity. The last
scene would be painful to watch if it were in any other movie. Isaac pleads
with Tracy to take him back as she's just about to board a plane to Europe.
Does she take the plane and escape this world? It's an important question,
and the fact that we care to know is what makes "Manhattan" one of the best
films of all time.</P>
