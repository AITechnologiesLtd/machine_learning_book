<PRE>THE CIRCLE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>THE CIRCLE (DAYEREH) opens with bad news.  Awful news under the 
circumstances.  When a grandmother is told that her daughter has given 
birth to a beautiful baby girl, she demands a recount.  She's quite 
serious about the midwife needing to look again since, if the baby is a 
girl, the in-laws will be furious and insist on a divorce for their son.</P>
<P>Welcome to a day in the life of the oppressed -- the women of Iran, at 
least those bold enough to want freedom independent of men.  Daring to 
attempt to walk around the city solo, these fugitives share a common 
bond of having spent time in prison, and, given their actions, they will 
undoubtedly be sent there again.  </P>
<P>Women in this country where men alone rule dare not go outside without 
the proper clothing.  Even buying a bus ticket without a man or the 
proper papers is almost impossible.</P>
<P>The gripping tale, directed with great compassion by Jafar Panahi and 
written with touching subtlety by Kambuzia Partovi, is mesmerizing from 
the first scene to the last.  Told with little dialog, the movie 
masterfully uses handheld cameras to transform us into another one of 
the women running along the streets in constant fear of the police.  I'm 
not a fan of handheld cameras since too often the filmmakers who use 
them create something akin to a shaky, bad home video.  Here, 
cinematographer Bahram Badakshani holds his camera steady but uses it to 
peer over the shoulders of the women and to focus it on their faces.  
And, oh, those faces.  So tragic.  Don't be surprised if you find 
yourself jumpy after you leave the theater.  It's a movie filled with 
palpable terror as the women in their chadors fly through the alleyways 
and corridors with their robes making them look black ghosts on the lam.  
These images will be forever indelibly marked in your memory.</P>
<P>Among many chilling stories, all told with the simplicity for which 
Iranian filmmakers are so well known, the most unforgettable involves a 
three-year-old girl.  This adorable and precious child with a bright red 
and white dress looks like an Iranian Shirley Temple.  Being under 9 she 
is not yet covered by the stern dress code.  For complicated and not 
fully explained reasons, her mother abandons her on the street so that 
the girl will be placed in a foster home.  This episode will break your 
heart.</P>
<P>Most Iranian films relegate the political messages to the sometimes 
barely decipherable subtext, but Panahi doesn't pull any punches in his 
denunciation of the repression by the Iranian regime.  Don't be 
surprised if watching it makes you want to join a protest group against 
such inhumane treatment.  You can try to tell yourself that your 
indignation is just because we Westerners don't understand their 
culture.  But it's a stretch.</P>
<P>THE CIRCLE runs a fast 1:29.  The film is in Farsi with English 
subtitles.  It is not rated but might be PG-13 for mature themes.  It 
would be acceptable for any kid old enough to be concerned with serious, 
intense issues.</P>
