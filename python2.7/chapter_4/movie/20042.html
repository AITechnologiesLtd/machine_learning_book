<PRE>INSPECTOR GADGET
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR></PRE>
<P>Rating: **1/2 (out of ****)
Walt Disney / 1:20 / 1999 / PG (innuendo, comic violence)
Cast: Matthew Broderick; Rupert Everett; Joely Fisher; Michelle
Trachtenberg; Dabney Coleman; Andy Dick; Michael G. Hagerty; Cheri Oteri</P>
<PRE>Director: David Kellogg
Screenplay: Kerry Ehrin; Zak Penn<HR></PRE>
<P>Disney's track record with turning past film and television concepts
into big-screen fare for the multiplex-happy family crowd hasn't been
too successful - "Mr. Magoo," anyone? - so it comes as a slight surprise
that their "Inspector Gadget" makes for a mildly amusing 80-minute
diversion. Whether or not this astonishingly hasty running time was
intentional or a result of post-test screening tampering, it certainly
serves the material: Goofy "Gadget," an overblown adaptation of the
mid-'80s cartoon, finishes before it has a chance to truly grate. This
alone is more than can be said for "George of the Jungle."</P>
<P>Anybody who's seen and loved the original incarnation will carp (and
probably has) that Matthew Broderick seems all wrong for the title role,
a contraption-laden crime-fighter, but the story adjusts to fit the
actor's coolly meek demeanor. In the show, Inspector Gadget was aloof -
if extremely equipped, with utensils, gizmos and doohickeys hidden in
every imaginable appendage - and constantly retrieved from the brink of
disaster by his super-smart niece Penny and dog Brain. Here, the kid
("Harriet the Spy"'s plucky Michelle Trachtenberg) and the canine get
relegated mostly to the background while a less-hapless but just as
well-armed hero takes center stage.</P>
<P>Not much in "Gadget" stays the same, actually. Mega-villain Claw never
allowed his face to be seen on TV, but is played in the movie by Rupert
Everett in a rare display of over-the-top fussing and mugging. He wants
to defeat his adversary with a synthetic creation called RoboGadget
(also Broderick), an Inspector doppleganger with Chiclet teeth and a
flair for destruction. Good idea: Giving the typically straight-laced
Broderick a change-of-pace chance to run wild in this part. Bad idea:
Allowing Broderick's genuine article to seem dull by comparison. Guess
it's true that bad guys have more fun.</P>
<P>A set-up explaining the intrepid Inspector's origins - humble security
guard suffers horrible accident - is executed quickly, all the better to
usher in Stan Winston's nifty special effects and some humdinger action
sequences. But what's up with the studio's inclusion of wisecracking
inanimate objects that children may take to but adults will find
irritating. In February's "My Favorite Martian," a suit named Zoot
failed to steal the show. "Inspector" has the Gadget Mobile, a
jive-talkin' roadster (comic D.L. Hughley does the voice) that comes
complete with its own assortment of uneven self-referential jokes and a
snack bar. Cue intrusive product-placements galore.</P>
<P>Easier to not mind than out-and-out like, "Inspector Gadget" finishes a
spotty endeavor. At least the picture benefits from wall-to-wall
wackiness - the vivid camera work makes bombastic Jerry Bruckheimer
films look subtle by comparison - and a pair of female performances that
further push its lively quotient: "Ellen"'s Joely Fisher as a
scatterbrained (but brainy) scientist and "Saturday Night Live"
scene-stealer Cheri Oteri as a noisy city official. David Kellogg
directs the sound and fury with confident flair. His sole other credit:
1991's Vanilla Ice vehicle "Cool as Ice." "Gadget"'s far better, but
really anything would be.<HR></P>

"It presents as comedy things that are not amusing. If you think this
movie is funny, that tells me things about you I don't want to know."
