<P>By all rights, I shouldn't have liked VERTICAL LIMIT.  After all, Action
Flicks usually aren't my thing, especially mindless (or, in the case of
this movie, overly-earnest almost to the point of unbelievability)
Action Flicks.  So it came as a shock to me when I realized that not
only did I like this movie, I was thrilled, and even *surprised*, by it.</P>
<P>I reckon this was one of those times when you just had to sit back and
enjoy the ride.  And boy, whadda ride...</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Our Earnest Young Hero, mountain-climber Peter Garrett (Chris O'Donnell)
is estranged from his fellow mountain-climbing sister Annie (Robin
Tunney) after a tragic accident involving their father (Stuart Wilson)
leaves Peter not ever wanting to climb again.  Peter learns that Annie
has joined the climbing crew of mega-billionaire Elliot Vaughn (Bill
Paxton), an eccentric adventurer who's using the planned climb up the
Really Big Mountain called "K2" as a publicity stunt coinciding with the
inaugural flight of his Majestic Airlines [Richard Branson...calling
Virgin Airlines' Richard Branson...]</P>
<P>Of course, Vaughn, an Evil Megalomaniac in disguise, has a Secret, one
which involves the Wizened Mystic climber Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn),
who has plans of his own for the Evil Megalomaniac once Wick finds out
that Vaughn plans to go up K2 with a climbing team, led by Best Damn
Climber Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea).</P>
<P>But when something goes Terribly Wrong with the climb, Earnest Peter
insists on rescuing his now-Damsel In Distress sister and company,
enlisting the aide of Wizened Mystic Wick, Comic Relief Aussie Dudes
Malcolm and Cyril (sorry; I can't find their credits listed *anywhere*),
Sensitive And Prayerful Guide Kareem (Alexander Siddig), and Medic
climber (and Peter's potential Warm Place To Put It) Monique Aubertine
(Izabella Scorupco).</P>
<P>Don't be fooled though: despite what the credits say, Chris O'Donnell
isn't really the star of this show.  No, the *real* focal point of this
flick is the mountain itself; K2, in all its treacherous glory, was far
and away the big kahuna here.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
If my rampant capitalization of those characterizations make me seem
cynical about all the Types that make up the characters of VERTICAL
LIMIT, it's because my genuine liking of this flick really surprised me.
In my book, there's little about the mix of an Earnest Young Hero, a
Damsel In Distress, an Evil Megalomaniac, an Wizened Mystic, etc., that
should Do It for me.  But yet, it did; *they* did.  Or, perhaps more
correctly, the mixologists - director Martin Campbell and
cinematographer David Tattersall - thrilled me with Gee Whiz action
shots galore.</P>
<P>The audience never had time to fret over the relatively-transparent
plotline, because whenever there was a moment to sit there and think
"hey, waaaait a minute...", **BOOM**! you're hit with something new
comin' 'round the mountain.  This kind of plotting couldn't hold the
movie up by itself - there's only so much Thrilling Action one can take,
even as good as "Limit"'s Thrilling Action was.  Fortunately for
VERTICAL LIMIT, a few of its characters - namely Bill Paxton's Vaughn,
the surprisingly well-used (and no, not That Way) Monique, and humorous
brother climbers Malcolm and Cyril - added a whiff of credible storyline
to the action surrounding them.</P>
<P>There are brief subplots involving the Pakistani army (as a
plothole-filled excuse to use devices which go **BOOM** way easily) and
one character's great need for Revenge, both of which strain the
viewer's ability to suspend disbelief just up to the point where Big!
Action! comes into play again.  I was able to work around it; some
viewers may not be able to do so.</P>
<P>VERTICAL LIMIT is one of those rare Action Flicks that overcomes (if not
transcends) the genre in which it resides; it maintains its high
excitement level throughout, keeps the viewer guessing about what comes
next, and even lets its supporting characters have more interesting bits
than the so-called stars have.  If only for its potentially big
surround-sound thump, VERTICAL LIMIT is most def on my "can't wait till
it's on DVD" list.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
"Story?  We don' need no steenkin' story!"  Seriously, though, VERTICAL
LIMIT was a helluva rollercoaster ride, from beginning to end; truly a
thrill a minute. If you don't mind a see-through plotline and story
resolution you can predict from a mile away, VERTICAL LIMIT is the
Action Flick to catch this season.</P>
<P>VERTICAL LIMIT (rating: greenlight):
Don't worry: I won't end this with a lame "Eagles" punchline.  I'll
leave that one to the movie.</P>
