<P>I don't get it.  Why all the comparisons between "Jakob the Liar" and "Life 
is Beautiful" when the similarities are superficial?</P>
<P>Benigni's "Life" is a fable full of exaggeration;  "Jakob" is a morality 
play set in a sordidly real ghetto.  Yes, both settings are Holocaust 
Europe, and each contains a child under protective secrecy.  That's about 
it.</P>
<P>Another "it" I don't get is why Robin Williams?  Did director Peter 
Kassovitz feel assured of success when he landed such a popular American 
actor?  Now I like Williams as a comedian, and many of his performances have 
been top-notch.  And, his face is starting to age enough to qualify as the 
mug of a real character actor.  BUT - his performance lacks either the 
scenes or the passion to qualify it as moving.</P>
<P>Jakob is a former maker of latkas and blintzes:  his abandoned café is now 
the basement of his living quarters.  Jakob's wife was murdered by the 
Nazis, and Jakob now works in a detail of other Polish Jews imprisoned 
within their formerly comfortable neighborhood.  When Jakob, chasing down a 
stray sheet of paper to obtain any trace of news, wanders into a forbidden 
zone, he is sent to be punished.  From a German officer's radio Jakob hears 
news of Russian troops just 400 kilometers away.  Luckily Jakob makes it out 
of the office unscathed, but has to sneak home after curfew.  It is now that 
he is obliged to care for a girl - Lina, played by Hannah Taylor-Gordon -- 
who has escaped a train headed for a concentration camp.</P>
<P>All these details create a grim tone, but the capacity for hope arises when 
Jakob saves his friend Kowalsky (Bob Balaban) from suicide with news of the 
Russian advance.  Is the war almost over? is the question countless people 
are soon asking Jakob.  Believing Jakob has a forbidden radio, the men of 
the ghetto are soon pestering him for the latest news - hopefully of the 
impending German defeat.  Jakob soon finds himself creating outlandish 
stories about American tanks and jazz bands, Russian divisions and planes.  
In short, he is a liar.  But doesn't spreading hope justify lying?  Not 
necessarily, Jakob sees when a neighbor perishes in his own attempt to 
spread the news he obtained through Jakob.</P>
<P>As you might expect, the atmosphere of the film is stark.  The set 
decoration is marvelous, suggesting the long period of desperation that 
ghetto dwellers must have experienced.  The characters are careworn, as are 
their shops and streets and infrastructure.  The viewer in turn feels a mood 
of claustrophobia and darkness, a mood very fitting for the plot.</P>
<P>The acting helps to make "Jakob the Liar" a solid enough story.  Alan Arkin 
plays Frankfurter, the former actor and current doubter of the value of the 
radio. As Mischa the former boxer, Liev Schreiber turns in a strong 
performance;  he sketches Mischa with a big heart but loose lips.  Michael 
Jeter (Avron) delivers his lines well, but is woefully underused, his comic 
genius not evoked once.  A similar problem surfaces with much of Williams' 
performance.  Indeed he is turned loose only once, during a scene I think is 
the film's best.  When he can no longer put Lina off about listening to the 
fictional radio, Jakob creates an amazing broadcast, followed by a 
life-affirming dance about the vacant café.  In the end, though, Williams 
seems cornered by a wrong-headed conclusion.</P>
<P>The crux of the problem is the commonplace.  Perhaps Peter Kassovitz failed 
to recognize the need for more scenes like the dance.  I'm not talking about 
dips into farce as we see in "Life Is Beautiful."  I mean just a few more 
scenes that would endear the characters to us to a greater degree. We see 
enough of the ordinary and bleak.  After all, the ending takes a dip into 
magical realism, but is ultimately unsupported by the elements of 
foreshadowing and fantasy that would properly ready us.  The bug is in the 
storytelling, then.</P>
<P>Hope is a thing worth many sacrifices, is one of the main messages we 
understand from the film.  When these souls get back to their former lives, 
it will be because they hoped they would.  It's certainly an important 
theme.  It's just not full of enough humor, even carefully-wrought dark 
humor - to make "Jakob the Liar" an important film.</P>
