<PRE>THE GENERAL (Sony Pictures Classics)
Directed by John Boorman</PRE>
<P> If Martin Scorsese had hailed from Ireland instead of New York, he
might have made a picture like "The General," a dazzling, frequently
hilarious crime story about Martin Cahill, a legendary figure in the
Irish underworld. Cahill, marvelously played by Brendan Gleeson, saw
himself as a modern-day Robin Hood who spirited away the valuables of
the wealthy and shared part of his take with his less-fortunate
neighbors. "My way of paying taxes, y'know?" he explains to one of his
cronies.
 But his busy schedule of thieving didn't get in the way of his family
life. He fathered children by both his wife Frances (Maria Doyle
Kennedy) and her sister Tina (Angeline Ball), an arrangement neither
woman had a problem with, according to the film. There are echoes of
HBO's superb series about gangsters in the suburbs, "The Sopranos," in
the way Martin manages to come home from his unsavory career and still
have the energy to throw a backyard birthday party or shop for racing
pigeons, another of his passions. Buying larger ticket items is a bit
more complex, however. When he decides to purchase a new house, Frances
has to remind him that realtors aren't likely to accept 80,000 pounds in
cash.
 Cahill's nemesis is police inspector Ned Kenny (Jon Voight), with whom
he maintains a prickly relationship that has undercurrents of grudging
mutual admiration. Voight, whose recent performances have ranged from
the flat-out bizarre ("Anaconda," "U-Turn") to underplayed ("Rosewood"),
finds the perfect key for Kenny, a beleaguered cop who calls Cahill a
"scooombug," yet seems on some level to enjoy the mind games the men
throw out at each other.
 "The General" was directed by John Boorman, whose films such as
"Deliverance" and "The Emerald Forest" are red-blooded examples of macho
cinema at its most virile. But though this is one of Boorman's lighter
works, it still has plenty of violence, colorful language and raging
testosterone. At one point, Cahill, suspecting an associate of
treachery, nails the man's hand to a snooker table, hoping to get a
confession. When the terrified guy still pleads his innocence, Cahill
relents, apologizes and even drives him to the emergency room.
 Not enough can be said about Gleeson's amazing characterization of
Cahill; did the Academy Award voters who handed the Best Actor Oscar to
Roberto Benigni's soppy Jerry Lewis impersonation bother to take a look
at this work? It's tremendous, full of witty little touches, such as the
way Cahill is constantly wandering through the streets with his face
hidden behind his hands, like a movie star caught by the paparazzi in an
indiscretion. Much of what Cahill does is morally reprehensible and even
shocking, and Boorman and Gleeson don't attempt to make him admirable.
By the same token, it's obvious they were fascinated with him and in
this vivid black comedy they manage to rope us into sharing their
obsession.</P>
