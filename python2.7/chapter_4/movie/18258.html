<PRE>                              "eXistenZ"
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Reality comes in layers as a game
          world is the gateway to more game worlds within
          still more game worlds.  David Cronenberg's new
          film is not for all tastes, but it is whimsical,
          witty, and weird.  The Canadian director plays with
          themes of electronic games, mutation, religious
          fatwas, and some just plain weird stuff.  This is a
          film that is kinky in many ways and some have
          nothing to do with sex.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10), high
          +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     While there is much in "eXistenZ" that harkens back to VIDEODROME,
the film is new and fresh.  It is a big night for Antenna Research, a
leading virtual-reality game company.  They are ready to start the
last round of tests for their new reality-bending game eXistenZ.  They
do not want to say what makes eXistenZ so different,  but it is a
distinct step beyond other virtual reality games that also tap directly
into the nervous system through jacks in the base of the spine.
eXistenZ is something of a breakthrough.  It is so new that the demo of
eXistenZ will be done by the inventor of eXistenZ, the queen of game
designers Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh).  But something is
wrong.  The competition has gotten an agent into the crowd and he
nearly assassinates Geller with a strange handgun made of living
matter.  Ted Pikul (Jude Law), who is providing security, takes Allegra
to safety at a local motel.  But Allegra has to test her eXistenZ
gamepod, containing the only complete version of the game.  (It is
worth in the tens of millions of dollars and she keeps the only copy in
her pocket.  Right.)  That means she needs a playing partner.  But Ted
does not have the jack at the base of his spine and is less than
anxious to get one.  Luckily there is a local gas station attendant
(deliciously played by Willem Defoe) who installs jacks as a sideline.
And for Ted a strange new world is about to open.</P>
<P>     David Cronenberg makes some of the most bizarre films of any
popular filmmaker. What is remarkable is that the more his films get
strange the more he crosses over to a mainstream audience.  It was not
enough that he had the weird alien medical instruments that he had in
DEAD RINGERS, here he takes things a step further and makes all the
machinery of the games, the game pods and the connecting cables, out of
organic material.  One does not so much flip a switch as massage and
caress it.  Connections are not made by cables but by umbilical cords.
Cronenberg comes dangerously close to alienating his viewer by
disgusting him.  But ingeniously he keeps the tone just light and
freakily witty enough that the viewer happily goes along for the ride.
But the wit is never so over the top to turn the "eXistenZ" into a
farce.  When I saw the film the audience seemed to be enjoying the film
immensely.  Cronenberg's problems are not with his audience but with
his financial backers.  Reportedly the major studios that could have
financed "eXistenZ" found the plot to be "too non-linear."  They were
absolutely right that as the plot goes skin-diving through layers of
reality things do get a bit complex, but that is much of the fun of the
film.  The non-linearity works for the film, not against it.</P>
<P>     Early in her career I found Jennifer Jason Leigh's roles to be an
irritating combination of ingenue and counter-culture.  She was sort of
the Homecoming Queen with a gun from Julie Brown's song.  But as her
collection of offbeat characters increases I am beginning to appreciate
what an accomplished character actress she has become.  Here she gives
a well-balanced performance that is generally perfect for the
Cronenberg material.  Jude Law of GATTACA and MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF
GOOD AND EVIL plays the understandably bewildered protagonist pulled
into the worlds of reality switching and being implanted with strange
impulses.  Along for the ride are Ian Holm with a thick accent.  Also
present is Don McKellar, the actor who seems to be as ubiquitous in
Canadian film these days as Denholm Elliot was at one time in British
film.</P>
<P>     "eXistenZ" is nearly as complex as the current THE MATRIX, but it
has real characters and a plot involving three-dimensional people with
motivations rather than with martial arts skills.  For the right
audience the film is a kick.  I rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
