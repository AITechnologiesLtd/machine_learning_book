<P>   When David Lynch made a movie this year starring a
lawnmower, we felt sure that this was not just an instrument
to make suburban grasslands look like golf courses but an
out-and-out serial killer.  What a surprise that the machine
was simply a convenient--if unstable--transport system for an
half-blind octogenarian visiting his ailing brother in a
neighboring Midwestern state.  Wes Craven has now joined
the bandwagon of newly chaste and virtuous filmmakers. 
The horrormeister who has already turned out
such dramas of fear and loathing as critic Jon Bauer's
favorite "Last House on the Left," "A Nightmare on Elm
Street," "Vampire in Brooklyn" and "Scream" now turns to a
sweet, inspiring, true story with a documentary look about a
woman who faced the horror of stubborn parents and
tenacious administrators before butchering the bogeymen of
bureaucratic bullheadedness.  </P>
<P>   "Music of the Heart" is sentimental like "The Straight Story"
but unlike Lynch's conflict-free tale, this one is loaded with
contention.  The trouble with "Music" is not its occasional
stickiness but its predictability.  We follow the usual
trajectory: the principal character is in heaps of trouble during
the initial phase but by the conclusion every last knot is
neatly tied.  The marital difficulty, the dissension of school
authorities and some parents, the difficulties in getting grade-
school kids from the ghetto disciplined and involved with the
violin lessons--not a single dilemma remains at the
conclusion of the two hours and then some.  In this case,
however, the argument can be made that the facts of the
story are true: that "Music of the Heart" is simply a
dramatized version of the wonderful documentary "Small
Wonders" that you can easily obtain today on video which
details the miraculous teaching done by Roberta Guaspari
over a ten-year period despite the difficulties she faced at
home as a single mother of two boys, devastated that her
Navy husband had deserted the family that so loyally followed
him from base to base.  </P>
<P>   Despite the flaws of predictability and occasional
mawkishness, Craven's story tugs at the heartstrings just as
the fifty lads in each of Guaspari's classes tug at their violin
strings.  Craven opens the tale as Guaspari (Meryl Streep),
having been dumped by her husband, takes a humiliating job
gift-wrapping presents at a department store on the advise of
her interfering but well-meaning mother, Assunta (Cloris
Leachman).  When a former friend she had known from high
school, Brian Sinclair (Aidan Quinn), runs into her, some
chemistry develops, but while Guaspari is looking for a stable
man to take the place of her ex, Brian is not interested in
commitment.  </P>
<P>   Moving to East Harlem with her boys, Guaspari overcomes
the resistance of the principal of an elementary school, Janet
Williams (Angela Bassett), and of a constipated music
teacher and is hired as a substitute.  In one bizarre
altercation, she is confronted by a parent who refuses to
allow her son to continue in her class because Guaspari is
teaching the works of "dead white composers" and because
she has come to Harlem presumably "to save poor black kids
who never asked to be saved."  When this parent asks the
teacher to name a single black composer and gets no
answer, she seems to have lost her own argument.  If indeed
there are no major African-American composers, wouldn't the
violin class be a step toward bridging that gap?</P>
<P>   Almost miraculously restoring order in a classroom of
young, energetic but unfocused kids, she gains their affection
by proving to them that they could improve their playing
weekly through practice and dedication, even holding a
successful concert in the auditorium before previously
incredulous parents.  When after ten years' time the
shortsighted local Board of Education and District
Superintendent cut the funds out of the music and art
programs, Guaspari is to be out of a job by the end of the
term.  But she survives by holding a concert of her charges
together a few ringers like Isaac Stern and Itzhak Perlman in
Carnegie Hall, no less, raising enough money to continue the
wonderful program.  Guaspari continues to this very day
teaching in East Harlem and, in fact, during the closing
credits the audience is given a phone number to call if they
wish to pledge money to the program.</P>
<P>   As satisfying to the soul as the movie is, perhaps it would
not have succeeded so well in evoking the affection of an
audience had someone of lesser talent than Meryl Streep
been cast as Ms. Guaspari--though I wish that scripter
Pamela Gray did not give her so many annoying "you-know"'s
to say.  At no time does she look like an actress rather than
a grade-school teacher.  A bit on the frizzy side and as
vulnerable in her personal life as she is a strong presence in
the classroom, Ms. Streep turns in her usual radiant and
expressive performance of the sort we've come to expect
after watching her in films like "Kramer vs. Kramer," "The
Deer Hunter," and "The Bridges of Madison County."  One
wonders why her character in this film, however, remains a
substitute teacher having never taken the necessary tests for
a regular license.  (Being a substitute, she can be dismissed
at the whim of the principal and her salary can never rise
above about 2/3 of what she might earn with the same work
as a regular.)</P>
<P>   The film moved me particularly because I've taught in
inner-city schools for quite a number of years and have
always tried to introduce programs to enrich the regular
classroom curriculum.  I've taken kids to Broadway and off-
Broadway theater weekly, to field trips outside the country
(Montreal), and to sites around New York City as diverse as 
concert halls and veterinary offices.  During that time I was
continually badgered by administrators to fill out the field-trip
forms correctly, by parents who worried that their kids would
be missing regular instruction, and by teachers who resented
my taking the youngsters out of their classes occasionally for
purposes that they considered only marginally educational. 
I'd not be so arrogant to say that in my years as an educator
I'd achieved anything like what Ms. Guaspari had, but I hope
that the public does not come away from this film believing
that she is one in a million.  There are 70,000 teachers out
there running against almost insurmountable odds in trying to
do their jobs with mostly poor kids in New York City.  Many of
them are heroes in my book though there is not nearly
enough time or public interest to allow them to display their
wares on the silver screen.  Consider Ms. Guaspari not
unique but an example of the daily miracles that quite a few
career teachers have been capable of effecting.</P>
