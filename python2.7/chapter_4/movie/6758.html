<PRE>                              THE FRIGHTENERS
                       A film review by P-M Agapow
                        Copyright 1997 P-M Agapow</PRE>
<P>[laserdisc/film] "The Frighteners"</P>
<P>In a provincial town, people are dying suddenly and inexplicably.
Snooping around the edges of the mystery is the smarmy but
disturbed "psychic investigator" Frank Bannister (Fox) whom many
suspect of being involved.  Bannister, who fears they may be
correct, is only slightly fraudulent for he can see the dead and
the sinister figure which stalks the town.</P>
<P>Whoever the genius was that recognised the talent in New
Zealand director Peter Jackson should be congratulated.  His
first three features ("Bad Taste", "Braindead" aka "DeadAlive",
"Meet the Feebles") were low budget, disgusting gorefests that
were a lot of fun but are hardly the sort of thing that would
encourage you to see Jackson as a director of Major Serious
Projects.  Yet "Heavenly Creatures" confirmed this vision.</P>
<P>"The Frighteners", although not his best picture and
sometimes illogical, is yet further evidence.  It shows a
perceptive balance in juggling a humorous, sad and even
frightening story in an economical framework.  The sad sight of
Bannister's half-complete dream house gives way to comic misfit
ghosts to angry poltergeists literally straining the structure of
an old house.  Even once in a while the plot throws us a curve
ball but neither this nor the extensive but subdued special
effects are allowed to dominate.  Jackson insists that the story
be told and that these other things are there merely to support
the tale.</P>
<P>As one wonders who would have picked Jackson, a similar thing
might be said of Michael J Fox.  It's all too easy to cast the
perpetually cherubic Fox as cloying or overly-earnest, the legacy
of too many years in "Family Ties".  Yet he comfortably slips
into the role of the downbeat Bannister, an shyster but a
pathetic and broken one, just skimming the surface of life.  The
seriousness of this central character is balanced by his spectral
sidekicks, including an unrecognisable John Astin, and lunatic
Jeffrey Coombs playing a deranged FBI agent (in what may well be
a sly "X Files" reference).</P>
<P>In truth the climax is rather cluttered and in parts very
Hollywood but not to any extent that ruins the picture.  In
summary "The Frighteners" is a well constructed and entertaining
picture.  Despite Jackson's next project being "King Kong" (no,
really) his work will be looked forward to with some
anticipation.  [***/interesting] and summer bays at the beach on
the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
