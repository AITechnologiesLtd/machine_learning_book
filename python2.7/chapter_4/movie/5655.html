<PRE>                          COURAGE UNDER FIRE
                       A film review by Ife Hsu
                        Copyright 1996 Ife Hsu</PRE>
<P>Twentieth Century Fox (1996)
Running Time: 1:50hr
Starring: Denzel Washington, Meg Ryan, Lou Diamond Phillips,
Matt Damon, Scott Glenn, Michael Moriarty.
Director: Edward Zwick.</P>
<P>Edward Zwick's  Courage Under Fire is not really about the Gulf
War. It is an inspiring, thoughtful, and honest movie about the
search for truth, and ultimate redemption. Washington plays
Colonel Nathaniel Serling, a decorated officer who wrongly
ordered shooting of own troops at the Gulf War.  While
struggling with guilty and remorse, he is given an assignment to
investigate the story behind the death of Karen Walden (Meg Ryan). </P>
<P>Walden is the first woman to be nomindated for the congressional
Medal of Honor. She is to receive the posthumous award for
having led a mission to rescue other US soldiers surrounded by
Iraqi troops. 
Withstand all the pressure (White House, Pentagon, Newscasters)
to produce a report commending Walden, Serling finds
inconsistencies behind the stories told by surviving members of
the rescue mission and refuses another situation where only
authorized truth is revealed. </P>
<P>Washington, Ryan give riveting performances. Washington's
Serling immerses into alcoholism, denial, and isolation to
combat his remorse.  Walden's story is a way to cleanse his soul
marked by the lies forged onto his fatal misdoing at the Gulf
War.  Ryan divergely plays four Karen Waldens that come to life
only through those who remembers her (parents, fellow soldiers),
and shows vulnerability, strength, and charisma. Courage Under
Fire also features excellent supporting cast especially Lou
Diamond Phillips and Matt Damon. </P>
<P>Zwick has shown an excellent eye for cinematography (note
previous efforts Glory, Legends of the Fall). All battle scenes
are well choreographed and fairly accurate. The horrors of war
are not focused with gore and violence much reduced from other
war-related movies (i.e. Platoon). Despite some emotional
manipulation of the audience at the end, Courage Under Fire
still ranks easily as the best movie of this summer and will
likely contend for Academy Awards.  </P>
