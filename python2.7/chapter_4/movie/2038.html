<PRE>                       SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1993 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     As the title suggests, this is a B-movie-style romantic comedy. It
is a vehicle for Michael Myers, who gets to do several different
characters:  beat poet, Scottish father, romantic guy. Nancy Travis
stars, but does not distinguish herself, as the potential axe
murderess.</P>
<P>     I thought the movie worked fairly well as a vehicle for Myers.  I
liked him both as a beat poet and as his own Scottish father (who sings
sentimental favorites from the House of Stewart -- that is, Rod).</P>
<P>     In terms of plot, though, forget it. The film makes no pretense of
caring about coherence or much else. What does Myers's character do for
a living?  Why do the police know so little about "Mrs. X"?  Why were
none of the disappearances reported?  Etc. If this were a complete
fantasy I could see the these details as unimportant, but the film is
not constructed that way.</P>
<P>     There are a few fine comic actors in small but fun roles.  Alan
Arkin plays the police sergeant, Charles Grodin is the commandeered
motorist, and Phil Hartman plays a guard at Alcatraz.</P>
<P>     The fine actress Brenda Fricker, who is unfortunately (for her
career) no longer young, is wasted in a humiliating role.  Remarkable,
isn't it, how men can mature into interesting characters who get great
parts (De Niro, Nicholson), while fine actresses disappear after a
certain age (e.g., Streep).</P>
<P>     This is a fun movie if you like Michael Myers.  It is a reasonable
date movie. But its quality puts it more in the VCR rental arena.</P>
