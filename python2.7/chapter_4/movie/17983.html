<P>"The Matrix" (1999) - Lawrence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Keanu
Reeves...</P>
<P>        "Cyberpunk" is a young literary genre, but one intriguing enough
that Southeast already has a class devoted to its study. Dominated by
writers like William Gibson ("Mona Lisa Overdrive," "Neuromancer") and
Neal Stephenson ("Snow Crash," "Cryptonomicon"), cyberpunk fiction tends
to focus on a dark, gritty near-future setting where attitude and high
technology reign.</P>
<P>"The Matrix" is one of very few films that would fall into the
cyberpunk genre - the only other in recent memory is "Johnny Mnemonic"
(which, coincidentally, also stars Keanu Reeves). To fans of the genre,
"The Matrix" will likely seem a bit derivative, but the rest of us will
discover a action-packed film with a gripping story and some of the most
awe-inspiring visual effects since "Dark City."</P>
<P>Our hero is, naturally, a computer programmer. By day Thomas
Anderson (Keanu Reeves) works in a Dilbert-style dystopia, but by night
he's Neo, computer criminal. For the most part, his life is quiet and
lonely, uninspiring, the kind of cubicle Hell most of us have nightmares
about. He sits in his apartment most of the time, a bank of computers his
only friends, selling computer data like drugs.</P>
<P>Enter Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), THE legendary hacker.
Morpheus offers Neo an answer to the one question even he can't fathom -
"What is the Matrix?" As it turns out, the Matrix is the ultimate
computer, the ultimate virtual-reality device, and the ultimate hack, all
rolled into one.</P>
<P>Explaining too much more would give away the plot, which would be
a shame since the rest of this review will be dedicated to convincing you
to see this movie.</P>
<P>So Keanu Reeves can't act. Many of his lines are delivered with
all the conviction of a cup of coffee. So what? The other actors
(Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Joe Pantoliano) don't do too
much better, but they get the point across. The real stars of "The Matrix"
are the story and the effects.</P>
<P>The story was written by Andy and Larry Wachowski ("Bound"), who
have turned out a splendid sophomore effort. "The Matrix" and its
McGuffin, the Matrix, has just enough twists to keep you off-balance, but
not so many as to make you dizzy.</P>
<P>That's the role of the camera and the special-effects team. Some
shots will, in fact, make you dizzy, but that's exactly the point. And the
visuals are uniformly stunning - you've seen the commercials, where
characters dodge bullets by making time seem to stop around them, but
those are actually some of the film's less impressive effects. All the
best parts are reserved for the theatre. The action sequences are
similarly stunning.</P>
<P>So, what IS the Matrix? That, gentle reader, would be telling. But
if you go see "The Matrix" you'll find out, and you won't be disappointed.</P>
