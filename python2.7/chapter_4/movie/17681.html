<P>   On the day I screened this wonderfully dramatized story
on April 6, Chinese Premier Zhu arrived in Los Angeles in
preparation for his meeting with President Clinton in
Washington.  Since Mr. Clinton has taken a strong stand pro-
human rights by justifiably battling ethnic cleansing of Kosovo
Albanians by Serbs in Yugoslavia, the producers of this
film--including its entire cast and crew--would probably just
love to have our president see it before or during his meeting
with the Chinese leader.  The drama could awaken him to
such an extent that he would drive a harder bargain than
currently anticipated with China over its human rights abuses,
particularly in its western province of Tibet.  Stating that
1.2 million Tibetans have been killed by Chinese forces
since 1959 and that 100,000 of the Tibetan people have
trekked across the Himalayas to freedom in India and
Nepal is one thing.  Seeing the horrors of Chinese rule in
that brave area on top of the world is yet another.  What
could have been crude propaganda in the hands of a
second-rate filmmaker comes out--under the exquisitely
nuanced hand of writer-director Paul Wagner--as pure
poetry.  The very first feature film ever in the Tibetan
language, "Windhorse"--which has already been seen and
cheered by tens of thousands of Tibetan refugees in India,
Nepal and at U.S. film festivals--is a must-see for anyone
with the slightest interest in world politics.  Viewing the film
affords the sort of insight that only motion pictures can
provide into the brutality that humankind is capable of and
the unending desire for freedom that such ruthless
treatment engenders in its victims.</P>
<P>   The ponderous narration which frames the movie (its
only weak point) informs us that the titled windhorses are
pieces of paper left on the ground to be spirited to the
gods by the wind.  Each sheet of paper, written in the
Tibetan language, is a prayer, a plea for freedom.   The
story then opens in a remote mountain village in 1979.  Two
girls jump rope: Dolkar and her brother Dorjee are interrupted
from play by the arrival of two Chinese soldiers who
summarily execute their grandfather for putting up a poster
demanding that the Chinese leave Tibet and go home.  </P>
<P>   Director Wagner shifts to the year 1997.  The
children, now grown, have gone off in different directions. 
Dolkar (Dadon) is a beautiful singer with hopes of 
national fame, while her cousin Pema (Name withheld) has
become a Buddhist nun.  Dolkar and her brother Dorjee
(Jampa Kolsang) have moved to the provincial capital of
Lhasa where they live with their mother and feisty
grandmother. The latter adamantly refuses to stash her
pictures of the Dalai Lama into a hiding place per a ban by
the Chinese government on exhibitions of the Tibetan
spiritual leader.  The old lady's militancy is reflected in the
hostility which Dorjee feels toward the occupying power.
He has become a bum who drinks and hangs around the
pool hall while his sister, together with her Chinese boy
friend Duan-ping (Richard Chang), plan out a career for the
lovely singer.  To rise in her profession, Dolkar must sell
out: she must follow the orders of record producer and
party boss Mr. Du (Richard Chang) and go on China-wide
TV with songs praising the glories of Chinese rule,
comparing Chairman Mao to the Golden Sun.</P>
<P>   When Dolkar sees with horror the brutalities inflicted by
Chinese authorities on her cousin Pema--who had
spontaneously shouted "Free Tibet" in a public square
and was arrested, imprisoned, and beaten--she thinks
better of her actions, realizing that she may be gaining an
affluent livelihood but is losing her soul.</P>
<P>   The movie is not without humor, particularly when
centering on the grandmother who cannot stand to look at
Dolkar's Chinese boy friend, who spits secretly into his tea,
and who seems to challenge the authorities to do
something about her high-spirited defiance of the
occupation.  American travelers who have ever been invited
into foreign homes can readily identify with a scene showing 
the grandma making Tibetan tea for a Western guest, Amy
(Taije Silverman), who speaks fluent Tibetan and must
utilize her diplomatic powers to stomach a brew made with
a huge blob of churned butter and an abundant share of salt.  
Amy learns first-hand about the plight of Tibetans through the
hardships endured by Dolkar's family and is entrusted with
carrying the story of the Tibetan people's oppression to the
outside world.</P>
<P>   This endearing tale features both professional and
non-professional performers all acting up a storm.
Some refuse to put their names in the credits for fear of
reprisals against their families.  The movie has justifiably won
accolades at festivals in Santa Barbara, Washington D.C.,
Telluride and Florida.  Not only does this break ground by
being the first movie made in the Tibetan language:
"Windhorse" had to be filmed secretly while the crew were
in Tibet, using various signals to take the place of formal
Hollywood-style cues, while a smaller segment of the movie
was shot in independent Nepal.  The viewer comes away
from a heartfelt narrative which is bereft of crude propaganda
and which incidentally takes in some distinguished
travelogue-type photography of the Lhasa market place and
the glories of the Himalayan Mountains--where a hardy
group of people struggle to live out their lives, honor the
spirits, and resist Chinese rule as well as they can.</P>
