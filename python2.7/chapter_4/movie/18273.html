INVISIBLE MAN, THE (director:James Whale; cast: Claude Rains (Dr. Jack
Griffin), Gloria Stuart (Flora Cranley), Una O'Connor (Jenny Hall), E.E.
Clive (Jaffers), William Harrigan (Doctor Kemp), Henry Travers (Doctor
Cranley), Forrester Harvey (Bill Hall), Holmes Herbert (Chief of
Police), 1933)</P>
<P>One of the all time fun pictures, with enough ingredients in it to
please a wide variety of film fans. James Whale, the director of
FRANKENSTEIN (31), saying this one is his favorite film. This was
English actor Claude Rains' American movie debut and vehicle to future
stardom, even though he is visible for probably less than 30 seconds of
the film, and that comes only at the film's climax, who only got the
role because Boris Karloff turned it down, afraid that the role wouldn't
work for him because he wouldn't be seen: but Rains' distinctive voice
was all that was needed to bring credibility to the part he will always
be remembered for. A film so perfectly and magically done, that is based
on the H.G. Wells novel, that is faithful to the book while adding its
own flavor of campiness to the story, such as a wonderfully bizarre Una
O'Connor, screaming her head off, as "The Lion's Head" inn's wife of the
owner and hostess to the invisible man.</P>
<P>A special film such as this one, brings unmitigated joy to those of the
20th century who like to sit in the dark and watch a world of illusions
come across a screen, an activity that could have hardly been envisioned
a couple of thousand years ago, and is looked upon, even today, with a
strange reserve by those who don't take their movies that seriously, not
understanding just how rewarding it is for those who find certain films
so important to them, that it becomes an integral part of their life and
they can see the same film over and over again and still derive great
satisfaction in what they are seeing. As for me, I could have seen this
film as many as twenty times already, starting when I was 12-years-old
and first saw it on a TV program called  "The Million Dollar Movie," and
I still get a kick out of it and see something delightfully new in it
with each viewing. It is especially fun to watch it with youngsters who
have never seen it before and are generally unfamiliar with watching a
movie in b/w, just to watch the reaction you get from these youngsters,
is enough of a charge, as they are perhaps surprised at the fun they are
having in watching such a creaky story and its outdated Hollywood
version of an old established English country village. It is a film like
this one, that can lure you into becoming a bona fide film buff.</P>
<P>In the snow a mysterious stranger (Rains) enters the village inn and
seeks a room. He is dressed so you can't see one feature of him, as he
is wrapped in facial bandages and wearing a hat and an overcoat, rubber
gloves and sun goggles. The patrons at the bar think he is an escaped
convict. The owner of the inn (Forrester), is upset that he hasn't paid
his bill and is rude to his wife (Una), who wants her husband to get rid
of the strange guest, who has turned his room into a science lab and is
scaring away the other customers. The stranger, who is the scientist
Jack Griffin, just wants to be left alone. He ran to this nearby
village, when he realized the experiment that he was working on for the
last 5 years, went wrong and he had become invisible, after using a drug
called monocaine, which is a flour grown in India that has the effect of
a bleaching power, but has powerful side effects when ingested, such as
megalomania and permanent invisibility. It was his hope that he could
buy some time in this village inn to find a formula for becoming visible
again.</P>
<P>The gifted director James Whale knew what to do with this story, as his
serious sounding but humorous caveat throughout the film is: There are
certain things on earth man must not meddle in.</P>
<P>When the police are called in to remove the inn's guest who wouldn't
budge, there is a mixture of suspense and tongue-in-cheek humor in the
air, as Griffin unwraps his bandages and to the utter amazement of the
policeman and the other bar patrons, becomes invisible, running around
the room undetected by them, tweaking them, mocking them, and providing
one of the all time great scenes in film history. He goes through the
village, playing childish pranks, stealing hats off the men and riding a
bike invisibly through the streets. It is only the police chief who is
cynical about this, refusing to believe what the people are reporting to
him.</P>
<P>Griffin feels he needs a visible partner to help him with this maddening
plan he has, to rule the world by initiating a reign of terror, so he
visits his scientific colleague, Dr. Kemp (Harrigan), who is his hated
rival and a man of low character, who wishes to steal Griffin's wife
away from him upon learning of his disappearance a week ago, Flora
(Gloria), whose father (Travers) is the scientist that both of them work
under. Dr. Kemp is scared out-of-his wits, and the scene is filled with
pathos, melodrama, and ironical wit, as Griffin dresses in his unwilling
guest's robe and pajama's and usual bandage disguise, and explains to
him that his invisibilty is not perfect, after eating his food it could
be seen for an hour afterwards, until it is fully digested, that in the
cold air you could see his breath, in the rain he would look like a
bubble, that he has trouble walking down stairs as an invisible man,
because he hasn't quite gotten used to the fact that he is invisible and
therefore is very cautious of the downward steps he takes. But he tells
Kemp not to fret for him, these are minor problems that will be worked
out in due time, and besides, on a clear day conditions are perfect for
him.</P>
<P>He makes Kemp come with him back to the Lion's Head, where he left his
invaluable notes. Once there he comes across a meeting being held to
determine if the invisible man isn't a hoax, as the police chief
insists, discounting all the claims the locals are making. This angers
"The Invisible Man," so he slays the chief, and is now the subject of an
intense manhunt.</P>
<P>But how do you capture an invisible man? Whale has a ball with this
police problem.</P>
<P>When the invisible man discovers police all around Kemp's house, he
realizes Kemp tried to double-cross him and promises to kill Kemp at
exactly 10 p.m. tomorrow. This bizarre threat adds to the mystique of
"The Invisible One," as the police believe they have set a fool proof
trap for their man, using Kemp as bait.</P>
<P>The film comes to its splendid climax in the dreaded snow, with John
Fulton's ultra-modern, for its day, special effects, adding enormous
visual support to the sci-fi story, having the invisible man's
footprints remarkably appear in the snow.</P>
