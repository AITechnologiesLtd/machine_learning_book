 The phrase "going postal" has come to mean freaking out, or engaging in
fits of bizarre behavior. It's a term that's an unfair generalization about
American postal workers but perfectly applicable to Roy (Robert Skjaerstad),
the anti-hero of writer-director Pal Sletaune's "Junk Mail," a clever little
comedy that heads off in one direction, only to confound our expectations.
 Roy is exactly the kind of mail carrier no one would want to entrust their
letters to. He sees nothing wrong with steaming open potentially interesting
envelopes and rifling through the contents, or wandering into unlocked
apartments and checking out the furnishings. In addition to being lazy,
sloppy and quietly creepy, Roy is also a voyeur who spends his spare time
stalking Line (Andrine Saether), a hearing-impaired woman who works at the
neighborhood dry cleaners.
 But just when Roy looks thoroughly repulsive, it turns out there's more to
the picture than meets the eye. When he sneaks into Line's apartment to take
a mid-day nap while she's at work, Roy learns Line is not quite what he
thinks she is. She's got some unsavory secrets of her own.
 "Junk Mail" comes from Norway, the country famous for giving us the heavy,
haunting movies of Ingmar Bergman, but Sleutane's film is much closer to the
quirky, underrated comedies Alfred Hitchcock made, such as "The Trouble With
Harry" and "The Family Plot." All of the characters are eccentrics, from Roy
to Georg (Per Egil Aske), the closest thing to a villain in the story, a
derelict who's so nasty he almost throttles an old woman who makes the
mistake of weeping in his presence. No one is particularly likable, but
everyone is intriguingly quirky and unpredictable.
 The humor is often broadly played, including a sequence which proves once
and for all that karaoke lounges are scary places, no matter what country
they're in. What sets "Junk Mail" apart from most American comedies is how
much of it takes place in silence, as Roy finds himself in slapstick
situations reminiscent of Rowan Atkinson's "Mr. Bean." At one point, Roy is
mugged by street thugs trying to steal his mailbag; Roy would gladly give it
up, but he gets tangled up in the strap and can't hand it over.
 For his supposed bravery, Roy is honored by his employers and hailed as a
hero. Such twisted circumstances are common in "Junk Mail," which breezes
along for 83 minutes and quickly wraps up before Sleutane runs out of
twists.
