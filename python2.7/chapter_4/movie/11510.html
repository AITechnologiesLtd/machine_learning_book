<PRE>                           THE MATCHMAKER 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon

<P>This isn't the best romantic comedy of the year, but it does carry a
quaint Irish charm that will win the hearts of some. I never thought
there was a shortage of single women in Ireland until I watched THE
MATCHMAKER. Single women, this movie is for you. If anyone is suffering
from the dread lonely-hearts syndrome, then I'll recommend a good Irish
dose of matchmaking. Empty your bank account, throw caution to the wind
and buy a ticket to Ireland during matchmaking season. I will guarantee
that even if you can't find yourself a potential mate for a date, at
least you will be treated like a Queen for your entire stay. Imagine men
with good character drooling over you, lining up to ask for your hand to
dance and singing their hearts out for your affection. If this is your
fantasy, then this movie hits all the right notes.</P>
<P>Janeane Garofalo is by all means a charming young actress who came to
our attention as the bubbly, witty Abbey, the gal with the personality,
not the body in THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS. Whilst she was
outstanding in that particular role, her character Marcy in this movie
isn't much of an improvement, but a mere improvisation of what we know
she is capable off. The premise of the movie surrounds Marcy travelling
to Ireland to discover the Irish origins of a Senator McGlory (Jay O.
Sanders), who is eyeing re-election. She arrives during the matchmaking
festival and becomes the unwitting object of marriage for every single
male in the Irish town of Ballinagra. With a bit of Irish luck, a bit of
Irish ale and two Matchmakers working over time on the side - does Marcy
find Mr Right in the end?</P>
<P>This lightweight comedy is easy going and should be enjoyed like a
leisurely stroll on a sunny afternoon. It's weightless content and
innocent fun is great daydream material, carrying with it all the
trivialities of life at its charming best.</P>
