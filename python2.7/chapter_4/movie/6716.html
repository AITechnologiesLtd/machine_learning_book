<PRE>                                     EVITA
                       A film review by Eric Robinette
                        Copyright 1997 Eric Robinette</PRE>
<PRE>A-</PRE>
<P>Starring: Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce
Written and directed by Alan Parker; original treatment by Oliver Stone;
based on the musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice</P>
<PRE>"Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know that every word
Is True"</PRE>
<P>And all I had to do was look at this visually stunning, engrossing
rendition of "Evita" to know that it lived up to its advance hype. In
fact, about the only problem with the movie is that its a little too aware
it lives up to its advance hype.</P>
<P>Many people had reason to doubt that it would work, not least of which was
that Hollywood had not made a suuccessful musical picture in years, much
less one where almost the entire film is sung. What these naysayers failed
to take into account were two names: Alan Parker, and yes, Madonna.</P>
<P>Parker has been publicly quoted as saying he wants to make a movie in
every genre before he days. If Iwere him, I would stick to musicals,
because it is in them that he most proves that he is a master of visual
storytelling. In "Pink Floyd: The Wall" he took a ponderous script and
breathed life into it with scores of memorable images. In "The
Commitments," he took a thin story and strengthened it by letting the old
soul songs tell paert of the story.</P>
<P>Now, with "Evita", Parker has pulled out all the stops and let the songs
completely take over, and it greatly helps that he has some great
performances to work from, not the least of which is Madonna's.  I, for
one, had no doubt she would be able to pull this off.  As derided as her
acting ability has been, even her detractors may admit she delivers the
goods in a musical forum, and she certainly does here. Not only is her
vocal range improved, but so is her emotional range. She effectively
expresses both theconniving manipulation and emotional vulnerability of
Eva Peron, which helps keep the character appropriately enigmatic.  </P>
<P>For all Madonna's success, though, the most vital performance in the film
is the one given by Antonio Banderas, who appears as Che', the film's
sardonic, omniscent narrator.  What surprised me was not Banderas' vocal
ability (I remember "The Mambo Kings"), but the confidence and ease with
with which he delivers Tim Rice's cynical  lyrics.  He effectively cuts
the proceedings down to size when they threaten to become overbearing. </P>
<P>Unfortunatley that overstuffing is the picture's biggest detriment,
especially in Webber's score. While his melodies are more often than not
affecting, too often they're undermined by dated arrangements featuring
synthesizers and guitars that sound like they're stuck in 1979.  </P>
<P>Unfortunately, Jonathan Pryce's performance as Juan Peron is stifled, too.
 While he provides a solid center as Juan Peron ,he tends to be
overshadowed by all the showy proceedings surrounding him.</P>
<P>Even Parker's normally assured direction gets caught up in the pomp and
circumstance. Early on,Parker's staging  is too self-conscious,  too aware
that its  creating a big spectacle..  It's only after Banderas gets going
that Parker relaxes and lets the material speak for itself.</P>
<P>In the end, after Evita has "entetered mortality," Che contemplates her
memory, fully aware that Eva was not all she seemed, but admiring all the
same her gift for putting on a show. I found myself agreeing with him
about "Evita," the movie.</P>
