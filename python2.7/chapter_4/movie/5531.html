<P>     First-time writer/director/producer Todd Solondz won Best Picture
at the Sundance Film Festival with this cute, cutting, and very black
comedy about a seventh-grade girl desperately trying to survive in
Junior High Hell.  Newcomer Heather Matarazzo touches the heart as the
tragic Dawn Weiner, huh huh huh, the bespectacled school outcast who is
repeatedly dumped upon by her teachers, friends, and family.  Though
nowhere near as funny as the rave reviews have suggested-- any episode
of "The Simpsons" crackles with more knowing wit-- WELCOME TO THE
DOLLHOUSE still succeeds as both a character comedy and a social satire.
As in Larry Clark's KIDS, the story situations-- and the accompanying
language-- are also brutally frank.  Pay attention to the psychology
behind a young man's threat of sexual violence and Dawn's response to
same.  I'm tempted to label this movie as "anti-Disney" or, if you
prefer, the antithesis of mainstream family fare.  However, as Mickey
owns Mirimax, the corporate giant could well be the next home for Mr.
Solondz and his remarkable talents.</P>
