<PRE>                                   SELENA
                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Jennifer Lopez gives a star making performance in the biopic 'Selena'.  This
energizing look at the life of a blossoming music superstar whose life ended
in tragic fashion in 1995 at the hands of her fan club manager at a hotel in
Corpus Christi, Texas is an in-depth, creative and fascinating look at a life
based not only on talent and decication to one's craft but also to the bonds
of family life which is so splendidly played out by the entire cast.  </P>
<P>In 1987, 'La Bamba' starring Lou Diamond Phillips had a similar look as it
too was the story of a Mexican-American music legend whose life ended too
soon in a plane crash on February 3, 1959 that also took the lives of Buddy
Holly and The Big Bopper.  As well as documenting the final three years of
Valens' life, that film characterized the rivalry between Valens and his
older brother while 'Selena' chooses to focus on her family struggling and
working hard as children from the time Selena is nine until her death at age
twenty three.  </P>
<P>Led by the belief of their father (Edward James Olmos) that they can make it
big in show business, the family's other children aside from Selena learn to
play musical instruments and are by Selena's side as she climbs the ladder of
success.  Lopez looks astonishingly similar to the real life Selena and the
movie is an indication that her career can go far because of her dedication
to this role.</P>
<P>Director/writer Gregory Nava ('El Norte') brings a hard edged and straight
laced look to this film and makes Edward James Olmos as Selena's father the
pillar of strength as his towering performance as the family's bonding elder
is the best one in the film.</P>
<P>For movie lovers interested in knowing something about the life of this
talented superstar, 'Selena' takes the time to also be a sweet, tender and
caring film about family, success, disappointment and tragic circumstance
juggled for a perfect balance.</P>
