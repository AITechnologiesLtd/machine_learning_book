<PRE>                                 CITY HALL
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: As a mayor's assistant investigates a
          crime with political implications, we get an inside
          look at the workings of a political machine in New
          York City.  The mystery itself may be the weakest
          link in the film, with the setting and style being
          the real show.  CITY HALL has an adult, intelligent
          script that is both current and harkens back to
          1950s expose'  films.  Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     CITY HALL brings to mind hard-edged 1950s urban expose's like ON
THE WATERFRONT and THE EDGE OF THE CITY.  And Jerry Goldsmith has
underscored the similarities by giving the film a big, brash, jazzy
score in the style of Leonard Bernstein.  That score may be the best
thing about the CITY HALL and sets the tone for everything that is to
come.  At heart CITY HALL is a mystery, but the mystery is not what
makes the film work.  It is the glue that holds the film together, but
this is really a picture of modern politics in New York City or any
multi-ethnic metropolis.  Certainly the mystery keeps the story moving
forward--sometimes not as fast as would be wished, but it does keep it
moving.  But the active ingredient is the setting of the story, giving
us an inside look at a political machine, how it maintains power, how
it relates to a multitude of different ethnic groups, and how politics
influences the decisions made.  And this is a film that is not dumbed
down for the audience.  The dialogue may at times be a little hard to
follow, but it has a ring of realism and keeps the audience on its
toes.</P>
<P>     New York City Mayor John Pappas (played by Al Pacino) has his
hands full with the fallout from a street shoot-out.  A policeman and
the nephew of a notorious crime lord killed each other and took with
them an innocent six-year-old black boy.  The Mayor sends his
assistant, Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack) to keep a lid on things and also
to investigate just what happened and why.  Young-looking but
perceptive, Calhoun traces the causes of the incident to organized
crime, to a local political boss, and to a mysterious judge.  The
investigation goes deep and, not surprisingly, turns up more than what
the mayor's office wants found.</P>
<P>     It is not a good sign when there are four names on the screenplay,
but it may not be so bad if they are four good writers.  In this case
included are Nicholas Pileggi of GOODFELLAS and CASINO.  We also have
among the four dark stylist Paul Schrader.  The cast is similarly
power-house, but perhaps not such a good investment.  An over-rated Al
Pacino gets the top billing that John Cusack deserved and plays the
same feisty character he always plays, overpowering too many lines.
His delivery damages the effect of the film's centerpiece, a sermon
from the mayor on the death of a young boy.  Cusack still seems a
little young for his role, but it may be just that people are getting
into politics earlier.  Bridget Fonda brings her quirky smile to an
under-written role that seems like an afterthought.  To no surprise the
most memorable and natural acting is from Danny Aiello as a cagey and
adept neighborhood councilman who positions himself as everybody's
friend.</P>
<P>     Harold Becker, director of police films like THE ONION FIELD, THE
BLACK MARBLE, and SEA OF LOVE, gives the CITY HALL a nice texture and
feel of immediacy.  Rate this one a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
