<P>Boiler Room, the first hardcore stock exchange film since 1988's Wall
Street, is one of the most spellbinding thrillers in recent years. Two hours
haven't moved so quickly since America was transfixed on a white Ford
Bronco, the Los Angeles Freeway and a national hero with a gun to his head.
(Speaking of which, why hasn't anyone bought the movie rights? Allison
Janney would be the perfect Marcia Clark!)</P>
<P>Seth (Giovanni Ribisi) has dropped out of college and started a casino in
his New York apartment complete with specialized house chips, porno
magazines and foul language. He no longer needs a student loan check to make
rent; portraits of Benjamin Franklin accumulate via this underground
business. Seth's father (Ron Rifkin who is a dead ringer for Ed Harris 10
years down the road), a respected Judge, isn't totally blind to his son's
doings and ultimately confronts him, sending an already rocky father-son
relationship into pure turmoil.</P>
<P>Seth decides that the New York Stock Exchange, in essence the world's
largest "legal" casino, is the place for him and takes a job at J. T.
Marlin, a brokerage just outside of town- trying to impress  his father. The
firm is full of 20-something millionaires, over-stuffed rolodexes, expensive
suits, fine Italian-leather chairs and sheer decadence. The money is so easy
to make because the stocks being pitched don't exist. Yes, J. T. Marlin is a
stock chop-shop, and like all fascinating scams, the FBI has its eyes
fixated on this one and, more importantly, our protagonist.</P>
<P>The workaholic society portrayed is not unlike many modern-day war room
businesses; Steve Jobs' and Bill Gates' empires closely resemble J. T.
Marlin in their dedication to working more hours than exist in a normal day.
In the beginning of the film, when you suspect little more than hard work
and dedication has led to the abundance of wealth, you want to somehow enter
the silver screen and become part of the culture. After all, Marlin's
workers are guaranteed their first million within three years, the secretary
makes $80,000 and last month's phone bill was a tad under the nonchalant
$400,000 mark. But as things progress and you learn more and more about the
poor folks who lose their money in the massive scam, a middle-class man
named Harry Reynard (Taylor Nichols) in particular, you become more and more
comfy in your seat and appreciate the distance between yourself and the
screen.</P>
<P>The initially sexy appeal of J. T. Marlin is helped by Jim Young (Ben
Affleck)'s pitch to new recruits. The so-called "group interview" is little
more than his ruthless sales tactics at their best with the aid of several
f-words and the re-assuring tagline "We don't hire brokers here. We train
new ones." But future mottos prove less appealing, like a "don't pitch the
bitch" anti-woman philosophy. Ultimately, when all rosy images are brushed
away and Seth reflects on his casino, the truth is more evident than ever,
"the illegal business I was running was the most legitimate thing I had
going."</P>
