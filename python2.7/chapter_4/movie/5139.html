<PRE>                                LITTLE MURDERS
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Cable channels like Bravo earn their keep by offering cinematic
gems which have been buried under pounds of blockbusters and sequels--for
instance, LITTLE MURDERS, the 1971 film adaptation of Jules Feiffer's
off-Broadway play.  Until it popped up on Bravo's schedule, I had never
heard of LITTLE MURDERS, which is strange because the movie definitely
deserves attention.</P>
<P>        Directed by Alan Arkin, LITTLE MURDERS is an utterly unforgettable
and provocative pitch-black satire.  The movie is set within the violent
confines of New York City, and it presents a grim world of neurosis and
paranoia.</P>
<P>        LITTLE MURDERS chronicles an unusual romance between the
unlikeliest couple.  Marcia Rodd is a high strung, head-strong interior
decorator; Elliott Gould is an apathetic, socially-withdrawn photographer
(who specializes in shooting dung).  Gould is a social misfit of the
highest order--painfully passive and shy.  The two meet when Rodd rescues
Gould from some thugs who are beating him to a pulp outside her apartment
window.  Gould is too indifferent to fight off his assailants so Rodd jumps
in and knocks them away with her purse.  It's not quite love at first
sight, but it IS the beginning of a turbulent relationship.</P>
<P>        Rodd sees Gould as someone whom she can mold into her ideal mate.
She starts by forcing him to have fun: they golf, play tennis, go bowling,
and ride horses.  Love is in the air.  Well, sort of...  Rodd falls in love
with Gould, and Gould ... well, Gould doesn't know what love is, but he
finds Rodd "comfortable."  And before you know it, she has brought him home
to meet her parents, despite his protestations that he doesn't like
families.</P>
<P>        The dinner with Rodd's family is hysterical beyond belief--the
movie's piece de resistance.  Rodd's mother, father, and brother make for
one of the strangest families ever captured on film.  Vincent Gardenia is
priceless as Rodd's conservative father.  Her dense mother, played by
Elizabeth Wilson, is a walking cliche who is constantly spewing platitudes,
like "It's always darkest before the dawn" and "How far better it is to
strike a match than curse the darkness."  Jon Korkes is weird enough to
give you the creeps as Rodd's off-the-wall brother.  I couldn't figure out
if he was supposed to be retarded or just incredibly immature: he looks 25,
but he has the mentality of Bart Simpson.</P>
<P>        LITTLE MURDERS is bursting at the seams with the grotesquely
absurd.  Every character is weirder than the one before.  Donald
Sutherland, for example, has a small but juicy role as the radical preacher
who marries Gould and Rodd in a decidedly unorthodox ceremony.  Sutherland,
sporting a hippy-look with long hair and beard, comes across as a demented,
modern-day Jesus-figure--one who gleefully denounces marriage and mocks
love.  The actors perform their roles with obvious relish and gusto,
especially director Alan Arkin, who briefly appears on the scene as a mad
detective.</P>
<P>        It's tempting to praise each performance in LITTLE MURDERS as a
tour de force, but it's really more accurate to say that the entire movie
is a tour de force--of writing, directing, AND acting.  The laughs pile up
on top of one another, but just when you least expect it, LITTLE MURDERS
does an about face and turns serious, deadly serious, with some shocking
plot twists.  As a result, the film is both brutally funny and brutally
disturbing.</P>
