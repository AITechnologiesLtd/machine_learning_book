<PRE>                            STREET FIGHTER
                       A film review by Rob Furr
                        Copyright 1994 Rob Furr</PRE>
<P>     Mark Twain's (so, okay, Samuel Clemens') wife Livy was, as it
happens, not terribly thrilled with her husband's tendency to swear.
In one specific instance, the anecdote goes, Twain was alone in a room,
and, if memory serves, injured himself.  This served as the inspiration
for a round of cursing of biblical proportions; he unburdened himself
of a month's worth of profanity in seconds.  After he wound down, he
turned around and saw Livy standing in the door to the room.  She stood
there and, very carefully, repeated every word that Twain had uttered.
Twain reportedly replied to this unemotional rendition of his poetic
blasphemies with the sentence, "My dear, you may have the words, but
you don't have the music."</P>
<P>     STREET FIGHTER, the most recent of the new trend in
martial-arts-for-the-kiddies movies, has the words ... has an awful lot
of words, as a matter of fact ... but it simply does not have the
music.</P>
<P>     It has a respectable plot; power-mad dictator (Raul Julia, in his
last role, doing a decent, but not, unfortunately, great, job as
General Bison) is trying to take over first, a small Asian country, and
second, the world, and everybody and his dog is either trying to help
him to do it or stop him from doing it.  Certain details are laughable
(e.g., Bison has sixty-some hostages, for which he demands twenty
billion dollars in ransom, and the other nations of the world are
willing to *pay* that much.  "Yeah," I said while watching, "Right.")</P>
<P>     It has respectable actors ... amazingly enough, Van Damme, the
biggest-name star (aside from Julia) in the film, has one of the
smaller roles.  The rest of the cast consists of second-rank actors who
you *know* you've seen before, but can't remember from where, and, for
the most part, they do a more than adequate job.  Certain of them stand
out ... the characters of Honda, Dee Jay, and Dhal Sim are above
average in this regard.</P>
<P>     It has decent production values; not great, but decent.  The
whiz-bang-on-the-cheap special effects that we've come to expect from
this sort of film are, for the most part, missing, and the money saved
from not trying to be the next Jurassic Park is applied rationally.
Certain effects are rather rotten, to tell the truth.  It took me more
than half the movie to figure out that Bison's floating console was
actually supposed to be floating (I'd assumed that, up to then, it was
supposed to be on a crane or something,) for instance.  However, the
overall look of the movie is far superior to the last
video-game-inspired movie (DOUBLE DRAGON.  Of course, "America's
Funniest Home Videos" usually looks better than DOUBLE DRAGON did.  On
the other hand, DOUBLE DRAGON was funnier than "AFHV" usually is, and
had a better chase scene, so it averages out.)</P>
<P>     It has, in short, pretty much all it needs.  There are two
detail-related problems with the movie, but it strives and almost
overcomes them.  The most significant problem with the film is that
every STREET FIGHTER II character, whether from the original version,
Special Championship version, Turbo, Super, or, for all I know, Tiger
hand-held, gets a 'speaking' part.  Some are larger than others; Vega
doesn't actually speak, for instance ... but they're all in there.
That fact tends to limit the amount of characterization and plot
involvement available to any one character, which makes the entire
movie oddly uninvolving.  There's no central viewpoint character or set
of characters that we can follow through the movie, and the resolution
of any one character's story is less meaningful; the viewer only
invested five minutes in Blanka's story, for instance, and four of
those were spent watching him in a chair making faces at the camera -
which makes it sort of hard to *care* what happens to him.  The second
problem is less major; it might even be a minor problem for anyone
who's not as, er, anal, as I am.  The military details are *laughable*,
and, unfortunately, unintentionally so.  A colonel is in charge of a
company that's apparently effective enough to have complete control of
a major seaport?  A stealthed boat can't be seen on a TV screen?  And
so on and so forth; minor to others, annoying to me.</P>
<P>     The key, major problem with STREET FIGHTER is that, even though
it's competently made, even though the plot holds together reasonably
well, even though it has decent performances, passable effects, snappy
lines, hilarious scenes (listen carefully to the soundtrack when Honda
and Zangreif are going at it,) it just never comes together into a
seamless whole.  Individual elements range from passable to great, but
the collection of them  looks more like Frankenstein's monster than
Cindy Crawford.  Possibly, if it had thrown most of the cast out, it
could have spent the time made available on the cinematic equivalent of
plastic surgery, but as it is, the assemblage may work, it may even
entertain, but it's not what it could have been.</P>
<P>     STREET FIGHTER is, at times, trying to be a martial-arts movie,
and it succeeds, for the most part.  It's not up to, say, ENTER THE
DRAGON's standards, but then, what is?  At other times, it's trying to
be a believable thriller, and at other times than that, it wants to be
the third act of a James Bond movie.</P>
<PRE>     In short, it has the words, but it doesn't have the music.</PRE>
<P>     On the Furr Scale, it's a 2.5-star three-star movie. (The Furr
Scale (I'm *so* modest) rates movies on ambition as well as quality;
clearly, ANIMAL HOUSE should not be judged on the same basis as THE
LAST EMPEROR ... thus, ANIMAL HOUSE was, IMHO, a *great* B movie; in
other words, a four-star two-star movie.  THE LAST EMPEROR, on the
other hand, was an average epic. (a two-star four-star movie.) Both
ROBOCOP and TREMORS could be rated with three stars, but ROBOCOP was
*trying* to be a three-star (or A) movie, while TREMORS was aiming
squarely at the B movie (two-star) level, thus ROBOCOP is a three-star,
three-star movie, and TREMORS was three-star two-star movie.)</P>
<P>     Loosely translated, a 2.5-star three-star movie is "Go see it;
you're not likely to do better this holiday season."  In an otherwise
lackluster session of movies, STREET FIGHTER by sheer virtue of not
being boring, is therefore recommended.  Just park your brain at the
door, and try to read more into it than is actually there.</P>
