<PRE>                               CARNOSAUR
                       A film review by Norm Cook
                        Copyright 1993 Norm Cook</PRE>
<PRE>(Hollywood, CA  9/19/93)
Released by New Horizons Pictures</PRE>
<P>     Written and directed by Adam Simon; starring Diane Ladd, Raphael
Sbarge, and Jennifer Runyon; executive producer Roger Corman.  Rated R
for graphic violence.</P>
<P>     Imagine a cross between ALIEN, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, and
any rubber monster movie ever made, and you have some idea of what
CARNOSAUR is like.  This is a typical low-budget thriller that we are
used to seeing from Roger Corman.  However, for my money this is in
many ways more successful than JURASSIC PARK.  It is more terrifying,
more energetic, and has fewer internal inconsistencies than its
big-budget predecessor.  On the other hand, its premise is rather silly
and the way in which the military "solves" the problem is even more
silly.</P>
<P>     Diane Ladd plays Dr. Tiptree, a bioengineer who has gotten tired
of working on weapons for the military-industrial complex and has set
up a secret research project in the Nevada desert (so why does the
sheriff's patrol car have a California license plate?).  It is soon
apparent that her secret project is to artificially recreate
Tyrannosaurus rex using methods that I'll generously call implausible,
but certainly not any more so than what was used in JURASSIC PARK.  Her
reasons for this project do not become clear until near the end of the
film, but they make sense in a demented sort of way.  Of course, one of
her T. rexes escapes and starts wreaking havoc on the surrounding
population.  Doc, played by Raphael Sbarge, is an alcoholic living in a
trailer in a nearby quarry.  It is never fully explained, but it seems
from certain comments that he had perhaps been involved in the deaths
of some people as an intern.  He becomes involved with a young woman
named Thrush, played by Jennifer Runyon, who is an environmental
activist protesting the destruction of the "dinosaur highway" fossil
remains by the heavy equipment at the quarry.</P>
<P>     Ladd's performance as the "mad scientist" is quite good.  It
becomes gradually more and more obvious as the film progresses just how
psychotic she is.  I thought it somewhat ironic that Ladd is cast as a
scientist in the second dinosaurs-run-amok movie this summer because
Ladd is Laura Dern's mother.  (Dern, of course, played a scientist in
JURASSIC PARK.)</P>
<P>     Sbarge and Runyon, along with the other supporting cast, give
adequate performances.  Doc is the only one who has the training to
recognize what's going on, but because of his reputation no one listens
to him.  He does manage to miraculously transform himself into action
when push comes to shove.</P>
<P>     The special effects are somewhat cheesy, especially compared to
JURASSIC PARK.  The T. rexes are animated using stop-motion techniques
and are not at all convincing.  However, there is a definite intensity
to them, particularly in some of the close-ups where you can see the
blood dripping out of their jaws after a kill.  There are also plenty
of close-ups of dismembered and eviscerated people, but nothing that
looks particularly real enough to be bothersome.</P>
<P>     I enjoyed Simon's juxtaposition of the carnosaur's frenzy with
scenes of humans in the act of or talking about eating.  It helps
define the instinctive motivation of the monster while providing some
black humor.  Unfortunately, Simon interrupted the action in several
places to explain what was happening.  (You know the situation: during
the height of battle the villain takes time out to explain all his evil
plans to the hero, giving the hero time to recuperate and to formulate
his counter attack.)  The ending of the film is deliciously paranoid
and leaves plenty of room for sequels (just what we need ;) ).</P>
<P>     CARNOSAUR is by no means a great film, but in any other year it
probably would be at least a moderate box office success.  It should
find an audience on videotape.</P>
