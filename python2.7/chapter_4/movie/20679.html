<P>"Kind of impatient for a big-time head shrinker, aren't you. How about
you let me explain it my way, ok? Thanks, that'd be great."</P>
<P>Starring Loren Dean, Hope Davis, Jason Lee, Alfre Woodard, Martin Short,
David Paymer, Ted Danson. Rated R.</P>
<P>The great thing about Robert Altman's Cookie's Fortune is that aside
from being entertainingly quirky, it was warmhearted, sunny and subtly
emotional. What mires down the similarly eccentric Lawrence Kasdan
comedy Mumford is that it isn't any of those things. It remains
emotionally distant and oddly impersonal; its protagonist's true
feelings a mystery to the audience. We laugh, we're entertained, but we
can't get involved. We're simply denied access.</P>
<P>Mumford is about Dr. Mumford from the town of Mumford. Dr. Mumford
(Loren Dean) is a psychologist who has only been in town a couple weeks
and he already has more patients then the other two area head doctors
combined. So talented is he that he is approached by the town's most
affluent citizen, Skip Skipperton. You see, Skip is a computer whiz and
owner of "Panda Modem", a company which employs most everyone who lives
in Mumford. Skip is lonely and wants the doctor's help, but wants it
discreetly. He is afraid that his company's stock may tumble if people
find out he is visiting a psychologist. He wants Dr. Mumford to treat
him without anyone finding out.</P>
<P>If you have not been exposed to this movie's advertising campaign and do
not want to know its "secret" which is revealed in all the trailers,
read no further.</P>
<P>Dr. Mumford gets to like Skip Skipperton, who reveals all of his secrets
to him. So he tells Skip a secret of his own. He is not, "nor has [he]
ever been" a psychologist. How he has managed to keep his lack of
credentials a secret baffles Skip, who insists that while Doc Mumford
may not be a psychologist, he's good at it. His other patients may or
may not agree. Seeing as he treats nearly everyone in the town, the rest
of his clientele, whom we get to know fairly intimately is an eccentric
group indeed. The head cases include: Nessa, a angst-ridden teenager
pissed off about everything that it is possible to get pissed off about
and then some; Henry, a troubled pharmacist obsessed with his film-noir
style sexual fantasies which he doesn't deem himself worthy of starring
in; and finally Sophie, a woman allegedly afflicted with Chronic Fatigue
Disorder, and a woman Dr. Mumford winds up falling in love with.</P>
<P>None of these people have any idea that their trusted psychologist is a
fake (why he is pretending to be a P.h.D. I will not reveal), and they
go on confiding in him. He is good at what he does: he's a terrific
listener and a perceptive person. But nevertheless he is not a doctor,
and it isn't long before he is hounded by the certification board.</P>
<P>We are allowed to get to know Dr. Mumford's patients almost
uncomfortably well. They are surprisingly interesting people: complex
and often touchingly troubled. That's all well and good, but what about
our main character? Don't we need to get to know him? Writer-director
Lawrence Kasdan (The Big Chill) keeps Dr. Mumford strangely isolated
from the audience. We never have the privilege of being involved in his
feelings, his thoughts, his motives. When the love story subplot rolls
around, we have a hard time accepting it because we don't know what's
driving Mumford. We scarcely get any clues about the man's nature. The
situation is hardly helped by Loren Dean's performance; he underplays
his role to the point where he looks like he is reciting his lines off a
teleprompter.</P>
<P>There's something else plaguing Mumford; a flaw that bugged me only in
retrospect: it is a naggingly unprogressive movie. Common sense dictates
that a storyline should, in some way, progress from point A to point B.
Wierder films may have it backwards or may be jumping all over the
place, but its protagonists change, as do the people around them.
Mumford starts at point A and never really goes anywhere. As I walked
out of the theater, I thought about what I saw and realized that the
only elements that changed were the Doc's patients. But was the film
about them? Our primary focus, Dr. Mumford remains stoic and closed off;
worse, we are led to believe that the events of the movie have had no
effect on the man.</P>
<P>I was never bored watching Mumford; it was just quirky enough and just
amusing enough to hold my attention for 96 minutes. But I was never
engaged in the film's story nor did I care about its main character.
I've seen far worse dramedies than this one, but for the accomplished
Kasdan, it isn't particularly impressive. Oh, and by the way, if you met
a man who spends all his free time making robot sextoys, what would you
do?
