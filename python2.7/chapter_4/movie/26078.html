<PRE>THE CREW</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Michael Dinner
Written by: Barry Fanaro</PRE>
<P>Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard Dreyfuss), Joey "Bats" Pistella (Burt Reynolds), 
Mike the Brick (Dan Hedaya), and Tony "The Mouth" Donato (Seymour Cassel) 
are a bunch of wise guys. You know the type, these guys used to break things 
for gangsters back in the forties because they were too stupid to run their 
own gang. The problem is, now it's the nineties and they're still wise guys; 
they're just too old and feeble to break things. The group lives in the Raj 
Mahal Hotel in Florida, the last place the old folks have. The landlord has 
decided to raise the rent so the old people will leave and he can bring in 
the new, young clientele. So the wiseguys decide to take a corpse from the 
morgue (where The Brick works), shoot it, and place it in the hotel so the 
young people will stay away and the rents will drop. The problem is, being 
the numb skulls these guys are, they shoot the body of a Cuban drug lord's 
(Miguel Sandoval) father. The drug lord thinks his father was still alive 
when the wise guys shot him, so he starts trying to track them down. Thrown 
into the mix are a stripper, named Ferris (Jennifer Tilly), who wants her 
step-mother (Lainie Kazan) killed; Detective Olivia Neal (Carrie-Anne Moss), 
a cop who is slowly figuring the whole thing out; and Bartellemeo's search 
for his long-lost daughter, whose name just happens to be Olivia.</P>
<P>Mobster comedies seem to be quite popular in Hollywood these days. They've 
thrown us dreck like "Mickey Blue Eyes" as well as the occasional hilarious 
movie like "Analyze This". Then we get movies like Michael Dinner's (tv's 
"Chicago Hope") "The Crew". This is your typical August comedy; not all that 
funny, but not incredibly bad either (the really bad movies get saved for 
January and February). "The Crew" follows that trend of the past few years 
where two similar movies are released within a few weeks of each other 
("Armageddon" and "Deep Impact" in '98, "Sixth Sense" and "Stir of Echoes" 
in '99). I'm not sure just why 2000 was chosen as the year of old guy movies 
("Space Cowboys" anyone?), but who am I to argue with Hollywood. So, you're 
no doubt wondering if "The Crew" will make you laugh. Well, you'll no doubt 
chuckle quite a few times, but there isn't a single good belly laugh. The 
biggest problem with "The Crew", as compared to "Space Cowboys", is that the 
cast doesn't appear to be having all that much fun. In "Space Cowboys", the 
actors appeared giddy with excitement over what they were doing. In "The 
Crew" you'll want to check the cast members' pulses from time to time.</P>
<P>Richard Dreyfuss is used as the glue to hold our aging cast together, but 
Dreyfuss can't quite pull this task off. How can that be, you ask? Well, of 
all the cast members, Dreyfuss appears the most bored out of his mind at 
being in this movie (though it's still better than his last so-called 
comedy, "Krippendorf's Tribe"). Burt Reynolds delivers his usual display of 
ineptness at playing a comic role (or a dramatic role, or an action role, 
etc.), though he does get one great scene. Working in a Burger King, he gets 
one of those irritating customers who asks for a thousand and one special 
instructions on a hamburger. He leans forward and hisses: "I know what the 
commercials say, but special orders DO upset us." Dan Hedaya ("Clueless", 
"The Hurricane") can't help but be great in everything he appears in (even 
his brief appearance in "Alien: Resurrection" was good), and he's one of the 
only good things about "The Crew". While his cohorts sleepwalk their way 
through the film, Hedaya is having a grand-ol time playing the brainless 
Brick. Seymour Cassell, who was wonderful as Max Fischer's father in 
"Rushmore", isn't even given dialogue in "The Crew", so it's hard to blame 
the man for looking bored. Carrie-Anne Moss ("The Matrix") gives an adequate 
performance, but it's nothing special. Finally we have Miguel Sandoval ("Get 
Shorty") as the Latin druglord who knows he's a cliche (too bad Barry Fanaro 
didn't realize his movie was as well). Sandoval gets all the funniest 
moments (a scene where two bodies hang from the ceiling behind him while he 
gives a speech to his troops) and lines, and he delivers then with comic 
timing bordering on perfection. Too bad he's not on screen very often.</P>
<P>I complain and complain that the actors weren't having any fun with their 
script, but I truly can't blame them. Every old, cliched joke in the book is 
used in "The Crew". Granted, old and cliched jokes can be funny, but not 
when they're used repeatedly. Fanaro uses every joke till it's been ground 
into the dirt and then finally starts on a new one. The constant jokes about 
the characters having to go to the bathroom all the time get really old, 
really fast. I suppose the question you really have to ask yourself before 
going into "The Crew" is: how much do I like jokes about old people acting 
like old people? If those sorts of jokes are hysterical to you (for whatever 
bizarre reason), you'll have a great time. That's because there's no other 
kind of joke in "The Crew". We get traces of jokes about the Latin 
druglords, and one or two involving Carrie-Anne Moss and her ex-boyfriend 
(played by the incredibly irritating Jeremy Piven), but everything else is 
us laughing at people for being old. The elderly in my audience seemed to 
find many of these jokes hysterical. Most of the younger people just stared 
blankly at the screen.</P>
<P>A lot of the film's problems come from the fact that the jokes are all 
shoved in your face. I've always felt that a great comic film will feature 
jokes which occur in the background, or very quickly, so that only the 
careful watcher will notice them (The Dude filling out a check for a few 
cents in "The Big Lebowski" is a great example). In "The Crew", Michael 
Dinner leaves every joke lingering on screen in plain view till you just 
want to stand up and start shouting that you get it already (or maybe that's 
just me)! The other extreme is long, drawn out segments with no laughs. 
Under normal circumstances these types of scenes are present in a comedy to 
further the plot. In "The Crew" these scenes seem present because Barry 
Fanaro couldn't think of anything else to do. Let's face it, the film's plot 
isn't going to sustain much of a running time (which is probably why the 
movie only runs 88 minutes), but if Fanaro was going to throw filler into 
the mix, he could at least have made it funny filler. As for the soundtrack, 
well, it's not much to write home about. In fact, I honestly can't remember 
very much of it. I'd recommend "The Crew" to people who think old guys 
lusting after young women (a fairly major part of this movie) is funny and 
give it a slightly generous three out of five stars.</P>
