<P>Harrison Ford's track record with romantic comedies has left him a bit
high and dry with fans who saw more in his original, action-adventure
roots (e.g. STAR WARS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK). This new conglomeration
of quasi-adventure and romantic comedy, SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS, has Ford
living up to everyone's expectations, and unfortunately, those weren't
high. Although marketed early on as an Indiana Jones-type vehicle in
order to nail the males, and as a smart, snappy romance to nail the
women, it doesn't manage to do anything solid with either of the two
genres. Instead, it comes out a bit limp, which is disappointing
considering the promise and talent involved. </P>
<P>Director Ivan Reitman (Fathers' Day) heads up three noteworthy stars in
this film about finding love where it's least expected. Frank Martin
(David Schwimmer, of TV's FRIENDS), an extra-sweet and extra-sensitive
guy, takes his girlfriend and soon-to-be-fianceé Robin Monroe (Anne
Heche, WAG THE DOG) on a trip for six days and seven nights at a remote
island paradise in the south seas. However, Robin, a magazine editor, is
called to Tahiti for a photo shoot, the only ride available is with
Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford, AIR FORCE ONE), a grumpy, isolated, aging
pilot of a dilapidated cargo plane. While on the way, the plane is
struck by lightning and forced to land on a largely unknown island, and
the two are forced to brave the tropical wilds and nearby pirates before
reconstructing their damaged plane in a part-MACGYVER, part-A-TEAM
sequence so they can hopefully return home.</P>
<P>Ford, who's by far the most solid of the three principals, is again left
high and dry. His performance in this movie shows that he's looking for
something more from the script, and from the way he moves on camera it's
painfully obvious that he's rather confined. His character - a
pissed-off, tequila-drinking loner - should be a great source of snappy
one-liners; unfortunately, he's more of a wimp than not. Heche, on the
other hand, is full of talk, perhaps almost too much. Her character is
too dynamic, swinging from the loudmouthing New Yorker to the subdued
romantic, and she never provides much chemistry for the relationship
with Ford. In fact, the only palpable feeling of drama comes near the
end, when Robin visits Quinn in the hospital. Schwimmer is adaquate,
although his screen time is nil and he can't make much of it. </P>
<P>All told, the promise that SIX DAYS shows in the previews is not
delivered upon. The romance here should revolve around a dark comedic
tone, much as it did in the much-funnier GROSSE POINTE BLANK of last
year. It takes quite a bit for a comedy to actually work in situations
such as this, and it's obvious from the first moments of the film that
it's not going to work here. Ford, although he has expressed sentiments
not to, should stick to action-adventure films, and Heche, whose
performance in her last several films has been moderate at best, may
need to work more on big screen performances. This summer, there are
better movies to see.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS": 2.0 stars - a fair movie.</P>
