<P>When I first heard of the pairing of mega-stars Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, 
I thought wow...that really is a terrible decision. Then the trailer came on, 
and I was shocked, the film actually looked good! So now that I've watched it 
what can I say? Great entertainment, memorable characters, very funny, main 
flaw: 20 minutes overlong.</P>
<P>Jerry Walbach (Brad Pitt) has a problem, he is told to go to Mexico to get a 
prized antique gun known as The Mexican if he wants to live, for a dirty 
crimelord he once worked for. His beautiful if sometimes bitchy girlfriend 
Samantha Barzel (Julia Roberts) has just broken up with him, and is on her 
way to Vegas. Jerry however doesn't have it we good, in Mexico he finds the 
kid who has The Mexican gun, but once the kid is shot accidentally in the 
head Jerry is a target, with many many people knowing what he has. Meanwhile 
in Las Vegas Samantha isn't having the best time as well, she's slightly 
depressed and after she relieves herself in the bathroom she is greeted by a 
bad guy who is then greeted by another man. After this man shoots him several 
times, he takes Samantha and drives off with her in her car.</P>
<P>Leroy (James Gandolfini off "The Sopranos" fame) is the kidnapper, and has 
taken Samantha due to her relationship (she once) had with her (ex) boyfriend 
Jerry. He wants to know where Jerry is, and where that gun is as well. Back 
in Mexico, Jerry's car is stolen as well as the gun that was inside the glove 
box, not having the best of luck he calls up his friend (J.K. Simmons) to 
come down and give him a hand. As Jerry and Samantha are both having their 
problems, we get to see how they resolve them, and in the end who really gets 
The Mexican.</P>
<P>Gore Verbinski director of the the 1997 hit "Mouse Hunt" which was a somewhat 
clever and funny film, he has a lot of talent running around this film. Brad 
Pitt (whose best performance to me is still 1999's "Fight Club) is set in 
goofy mode, and is very funny and engaging. Along with him is the always 
great Julia Roberts who looks different with her short, shagged hair make a 
great pair. The best pairing in the film however is Julia and Tony Soprano 
himself James Gandolfini. Even as a bad guy, Leroy is a sweet and funny 
character. What seems as a movie that is supposed to be a pairing of Julia 
and James, the movie takes a quick 180 and throughout an hour and a half, 
they aren't even on screen together!</P>
<P>The cleverly written script by J.H. Wyman is foul-mouthed, fast and furious. 
What surprised me was the comedy in the film, I knew it'd be funny but where 
were times when I was laughing pretty hard! I had just one major problem with 
"The Mexican" and that is the overlong 2 hour 3 minute running time, about 
110 minutes into the film, I got squirmy in my chair. </P>
<P>So far in 2001, its been a good year and "The Mexican" I can add to that. 
It's a fun, rollicking, clever ride that is great from start to finish. For 
all those fans of Julia and Brad I definitely recommend this, and hope they 
do more movies together.</P>
