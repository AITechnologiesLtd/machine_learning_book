<PRE>                      BEAUMARCHAIS: THE SCOUNDREL
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     It was a crazy time in France, what with the French revolution
right around the corner.  King Louis XV would soon die, and his son
would become King Louis XVI.  Such is the setting for BEAUMARCHAIS: THE
SCOUNDREL about the controversial playwright, spy and playboy
Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais.</P>
<P>     Beaumarchais was the author of the plays, "The Barber of Seville"
and "The Marriage of Figaro."  Today people think of them as quaint and
harmless operas, but, back in 1773 when the movie takes place, they
were so scandalous that Beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than
once.</P>
<P>     The movie BEAUMARCHAIS: THE SCOUNDREL takes a light-hearted
approach to its subject, resulting in an inviting motion picture.  One
of France's most expensive productions ever, the movie was a huge hit
when it opened there last year.  Now in theatrical release in the
United States, it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with
a romping good story.</P>
<P>     The secret of the film's success, other than the lavishness of
Sylvie De Segonzac's costumes, has to be the performance by Fabrice
Luchini as Beaumarchais.  With his glistening eyes and his infectious
smile, he mesmerizes the camera and the audience.  His wry little lips
seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning.  In a
land where court intrigue determines one's destiny, constant scheming
was a way of life for the aristocracy.</P>
<P>     As our story starts, we learn that Beaumarchais has bought himself
a judgeship.  Into his court comes a member of the nobility demanding
an immediate sword fight.  Beaumarchais, who has been having an affair
with the man's wife, makes him wait until the current case on the
docket is decided.  That over with, the fight is on.</P>
<P>     With Luchini's charisma, it is hard to root for anyone other than
him.   Audiences may remember him from the marvelous COLONEL CHABERT,
in which he played the attorney.  Although he does not have half of the
good looks of his assistant Gudin, played by Manuel Blanc, he dazzles
the women and the viewers with his grace and style.</P>
<P>     Michael Epp's warm and intimate cinematography provides a nice
accompaniment to Jean-Marc Kerdelhue's lush but realistic looking sets.
Jean-Claude Petit's music, especially the hauntingly lovely flute
solos, make for an enchanting time at the movies.</P>
<P>     Director Jean-Claude Brisville, who wrote the script along with
Edouard Molinaro, fleshed out a play by Sacha Guitry which, according
to the press notes, was just a series of historic vignettes.  The
disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the
movie, but the actors smooth it over with their good-hearted style.
Typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in which a
rotund Benjamin Franklin appears in a large pot of hot water, taking
his bath.</P>
<P>     One episode has Beaumarchais working with a renegade spy who may
or may not be a man.  Another has Beaumarchais using his personal
fortune to aid the American revolution.  All of this may sound like a
dull historical drama, but it is anything but.  The story plays more
like theater of the absurd than a movie based on historical facts.</P>
<P>     The radiantly lovely Sandrine Kiberlain plays Marie-Therese, the
real love of Beaumarchais's life.  But he is so likable that members of
the audience may want to compete with her for him.  Still, with his
beguiling smile, one can never quite be sure if you should trust him.
The movie, on the other hand, can be trusted to deliver a high old
time.</P>
<P>     BEAUMARCHAIS: THE SCOUNDREL runs 1:41.  It is in French with
English subtitles.  The film is not rated but would be an R for some
nudity and sex, and should be fine for most teenagers.</P>
