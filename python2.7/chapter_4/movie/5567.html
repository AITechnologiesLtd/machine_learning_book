<PRE>                        THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a wonderful film for anyone
          who does not know the Victor Hugo novel and yet a
          brazenly horrendous adaptation for anyone who does
          know the story.  Disney's animators have lavished
          their greatest technical virtuosity on a script
          that is painfully inaccurate to its source.  With
          such extremes of good and bad I have to give the
          film a mediocre rating, but in fairness there is a
          lot to admire here as well as much to revile.
          Rating: low +1(-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     By any objective standards, point for point, this is the best
animated film that has come from Disney Studios.  It has the best
animation, the most complex story, and even the most interesting
characters of any Disney Studios animated film.  The reason that this
film is getting flak--and I am not saying that it is not fully
deserved--is that the violence that the Disney people invariably do to
the story is this time being done to a different type of story.  It is
a story with which many people have both a passing acquaintance and,
even more important, a certain respect.  This is an adaptation of the
often-filmed 1831 novel NOTRE DAME DE PARIS by Victor Hugo.  But this
time when the Disney people turn the characters inside-out, totally
distorting them, and there is a sizable proportion of the audience who
know what is going on.</P>
<P>     There is a canonical version of the story of Aladdin--the one
translated by Sir Richard Burton from the Arabic--but few people
actually know the details of the plot.  So if the Disney film moves the
setting from China to Arabia and bases the story more on "The Thief of
Bagdad" than on the original Burton version, few people notice or care.
But just about every review I have written of a Disney animated film
contains the complaint someplace that the story is not accurate to the
original story on which it is based.  This time around the Disney
people have chosen a classic that is cynical, misanthropic, and
extremely angry (not unlike the emotions I felt when I first heard that
Disney would be doing HUNCHBACK.)  But having resigned myself to seeing
a novel I really like being desecrated on the screen, the film that
Disney Studios have made is about as well-made as that studio has ever
done.  And it is not as if the classic Charles Laughton version was
tremendously accurate to the novel either.  It distorted the Hugo badly
also, though nowhere nearly as badly as the new animated film.</P>
<P>     This version is something of a saddlepoint, being on one hand the
worst adaptation of the five well-known English language versions of
novel.  (I have not seen the two French versions nor the 1917 version
THE DARLING OF PARIS with Theda Bara--and I am not sure I want to.)
And yet, in my opinion at least, this is the best Disney animated film
to date, beating out even BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. This is the darkest-
themed of any of the Disney films and has some of the most complex
characters, for what that is worth.  There is little wrong with this
film that could not have been fixed by re-titling it BELL-RINGER OF
NOTRE DAME, changing all the character names, and saying that this was
"suggested by" NOTRE DAME DE PARIS.</P>
<P>     Though never stated in the film, the year is 1482, during the
reign of Louis XI.  In this version Quasimodo is cutely deformed in
much the same way a troll doll is.  He lives in seclusion (though not
in deafness) because he is forbidden to leave Notre Dame by his harsh
guardian, Judge Frollo, and because he is shy, being stigmatized by his
deformity.  In this version, the people of Paris are unknowingly cruel
to him when they first see him close up, but are basically good at
heart.  The cathedral is run by people who are also good, and the chief
evil in Paris is Judge Frollo.  Quasimodo's only friends have been
three gargoyles who come to life just for him, not unlike the tiger toy
in "Calvin and Hobbes."  But risking rejection, Quasimodo makes friends
with the rambunctious and buxom gypsy woman Esmeralda and the dashing
and noble Phoebus, Captain of the Guards and a man with a strong sense
of morality and chivalry.  Even in just this much plot the story has
been horribly and painfully twisted.</P>
<P>     The screenplay--by five people, always a bad sign--invariably
finds the most vulnerable places to undermine Hugo's story and to
distort nearly everything about it.  It is almost impressive how they
take such liberties as they do and still leave the story at least
recognizable with so much of the screen story just the reverse of the
Hugo novel.  For example, Esmeralda has one quick moment of shock when
she realizes that the ugliness of "Quasi" is not just a mask, and from
that point on she has nothing but admiration from him.  "You are a
surprise from every angle," she sings.  It took a great deal of sugar-
coating to make the story innocuous enough that it could be a Disney
film.  And still it is the darkest and most powerful of Disney's
animated features, which is perhaps not saying very much.</P>
<P>     As bad as the distortion of the novel is, the writers have some
powerful scenes.  Where Frollo describes the Gypsies as being vermin,
like ants crawling under a stone, the scene has the power of some of
the anti- Jewish propaganda films of Nazi Germany.  There is a terrific
scene of the sexually-frustrated Frollo seeing images of Esmeralda in a
fire that very nicely gets across to even fairly young children the
thorny concept that Frollo's hatred of Esmeralda springs from his own
desire for her.  And the script also borrows from other film versions.
There is a scene where Esmeralda prays in the Cathedral for nothing for
herself, but for God to help her people.  This scene was invented for
the 1939 film version, but is the basis for a musical number in this
film.</P>
<P>     Being fair, Disney's HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME is also a technical
marvel.  The Disney animators are no longer trying to make a computer
animated film look like it was entirely hand-drawn.  Instead they are
mixing in images of such technical perfection they could only have been
created by computer.  Gone is the feeling of just six or seven planes
of flat images.  The images now create a heightened sense of depth that
is far too perfect to be done by hand.  This film has jaw-dropping
scenes that could never be filmed in live-action on animated without a
computer.  When Quasimodo swings down over the heads of the crowd to
rescue Esmeralda and the viewer goes with him arching down, it is one
of the most spectacular animated sequences in any feature film.  Still
that scene is flawed, perhaps intentionally.  It does have the problem
that everybody in the crown seems to be the same height to give the
feel of a plane of heads.  But it is a terrific image, nevertheless.
There are some other problems with the animation.  Once again a
different team animates each major character.  But the styles of
animation do not quite match.  While Phoebus has a natural, rotoscoped
look about him, Quasimodo has a flatter look and feel.  When the two
walk together they do not look right.  It almost looks like a human
walking with a Toon.  Nor is the artwork particularly original.  In
face Frollo looks far too much like the witch from SLEEPING BEAUTY
turned into a man.  And Esmeralda looks ... well, like Disney animators
have lost their innocence and are now into drawing heroines with big
breasts.</P>
<P>     There is a lot of film here for a short 86 minutes, a lot that is
terrific and a lot that is terrible.  On balance I give THE HUNCHBACK
OF NOTRE DAME a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.  I wish Disney had stuck
to a lesser-known and lesser-loved book.</P>
