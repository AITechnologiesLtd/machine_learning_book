The Fury (1978)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 71</PRE>
<P>Trivia time!  Brian DePalma has directed two 1970s films starring
Amy Irving.  One of them marks the screen debut of Darryl Hannah.
Bzzzzzt!  We're talking about "The Fury", a mystery drama that 
turns into a horror film.</P>
<P>Kirk Douglas and his teenage son Robin are vacationing at a
Middle Eastern beach.  Douglas is to send Robin to special 
institute in the states to better develop/understand Robin's 
unusual ESP ability.  Long-time friend and co-worker Childress 
is also there.  Suddenly, snipers fire at Douglas, but somehow 
are unable to shoot him.  He ends up in the hiding by rocks along 
the beach, but takes a rifle from a dead sniper and manages to 
shoot Childress, whom he realizes is behind the attack.  Childress,
who works for a secret government agency, has kidnapped Robin 
to use his special powers for espionage purposes. </P>
<P>Douglas now is on a quest to find and liberate Robin.  He is
wanted by the Feds, who have many men on his tail.  Douglas
hires the psychic Raymond Dunworthy, to find a better psychic 
who can find Robin.  Dunworthy comes up with Irving, a teenager 
also with strong ESP powers.  But Dunworthy is being monitored
by the Feds and leads them to Douglas, who makes a narrow
escape that involves jumping half-naked from a hotel room,
tying up innocent bystanders, stealing a new car occupied by
two cops, and later driving that car off into a lake, much
to the cops chagrin.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Irving's abilities are attracting the interest
of her teachers.  She can make a toy train move by telekinesis,
and makes classmates bleed when they make the mistake of
touching her.  She is sent to the same special institute 
Robin was sent to. At first, life is peaceful there, and
she bonds with instructor Hestor (Carrie Snodgrass) who
is also Douglas' girlfriend.  The institute is headed
by Charles Durning, who recognizes Irving's power and
tries to protect her from Childress, who has spies at
the institute and is looking for more psychics to add to
his collection, that already includes Robin.</P>
<P>Irving begins having visions of Robin.  Sometimes these coincide
with her being touched.  After Irving causes a hemmorage in one
of the staff, Childress gets wind of this and begins drugging
Irving, in preparation of removing her from the institute to
work with Robin.  Douglas and Snodgrass decide that Irving must
escape from the institute before it is too late, with Douglas
wanting to use her to locate his son.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Robin is under great stress at his government gig.
He is isolated and treated as a guinea pig.  His only contact
is with an attractive but manipulative agent whom he does not
trust.  He is being drugged and is emotionally unstable, 
becoming paranoid and psychotic.</P>
<P>Irving escapes from the institute, but it isn't easy,
with Douglas killing two security guards and Snodgrass also
killed.  Irving and Douglas go to rescue Robin.  They
break into the government compound.  Robin senses her
presence, and afraid of being replaced, goes into a
rage, torturing and killing his agent girlfriend using his
powers.  The film has definitely slipped into the horror
genre, as blood splatters the walls.</P>
<P>Irving and Douglas are caught by Childress.  Childress
sends Douglas to go after Robin, who is killing everyone
who enters his room.  Douglas enters the blood soaked
room.  He finds Robin suspended in mid-air with a crazed
look on his face.  Robin attacks Douglas.  They fall out
of the window and land on the roof.  Douglas hangs on
the gutter for dear life, with the other arm supporting
Robin, who is suspended high above the cement street.
We think they will make it, but Robin claws Douglas
and both fall to their deaths.</P>
<P>Now Childress only has Irving to use as a psychic.  He
visits her the next morning in her new bedroom, and
tells her that life must go on, that she is special
and important, etc.  She responds by using her powers
to make his head explode.  This explosion is graphically 
shown several times from different angles.</P>
<P>"The Fury" is a surprisingly good film.  Douglas' struggle
to find and save his son, and Irving's and Robin's struggle
to cope with their abilities, are successfully developed themes.</P>
