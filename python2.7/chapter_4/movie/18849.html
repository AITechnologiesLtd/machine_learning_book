<P>They often call it the city that never sleeps, and now they have a
reason. In "The Out-of-Towners," a remake of the 1970 Neil Simon
original, Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn play the titular travelers who
kvetch, flail and mug their way through a seemingly simple stay in the
Big Apple that turns into a zany obstacle course. Since New York City of
the '90s is friendlier than ever, this ultimate in tourist incompetence
- not assorted miscreants, perverts and serial killers - tidily updates
every native's worst nightmare. But as every farce enthusiast's
dream-come-true, the film falls short. Way short.</P>
<P>So, why the near-endorsement? Because Martin and Hawn, gifted comedians
who click both here and in 1992's much better "Housesitter," are capable
of turning even the lamest shtick into worthy shenanigans. When their
demure Ohio empty-nesters - hungry, strapped for cash and stranded in
metropolis for 24 hours - crash a sexaholics meeting for the free
pastry, an unoriginal scene racks up a solid laugh quotient. And the
movie has a wicked weapon in its casting of John Cleese as a
shades-of-Basil Fawlty hotel manager. A sequence that finds him
promenading in a frock and stiletto heels to "Bad Girls" might alone be
worth the admission price.</P>
<P>Martin and Hawn's non-stop outrageous fortune isn't totally without its
moments, just uneven enough to make for strictly scattered success.
Mischief like dangling from building balconies, an auto collision at
Fulton Fish Market, drug-induced traipsing around Central Park and a
spontaneous bout of passion on Tavern on the Green are too obvious to
score as intended set-pieces. "The Out-of-Towners" mines far funnier
territory when it preys on reliable crises involving rental cars,
baggage claim, road maps and monetary shortages. Some even ring true.</P>
<P>A dose of gloppy human emotion accompanies these occasionally
diminishing returns, creating a very different tone than the darkly
humorous bad luck that befell leads Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis in
Simon's "Out-of-Towners." There, Lemmon's impetus for seeing the Empire
State was a job interview he didn't necessarily need. Here, Martin has a
similar career opportunity awaiting, only this poor schmoe - recently
laid-off and keeping secrets from the wife - _must_ nail it. This
subplot paves the way for the moment-of-truth as his cover is blown,
followed by a loud argument, then a warm reconciliation scene, all
unnecessary. You get the idea.</P>
<P>Thanks to these climactic sentimental sidetracks, the film ends on an
overt weak note it had otherwise avoided, what with the delight
sustained by Martin's dilapidating sense of control, Hawn's absurd
antics, Cleese's impressive leg hikes and the sporadic hits in the
hit-or-miss gag ratio. "The Out-of-Towners" ultimately lets its assets
down even further with a whimpering finale, and as a result, some
viewers are likely to develop a reaction parallel to its much-maligned
setting: Nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.<HR></P>

"Here it is at last, the first 150-minute trailer. ‘Armageddon' is cut
together like its own highlights. Take almost any 30 seconds at random,
and you'd have a TV ad. The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears,
the brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained. No
matter what they're charging to get in, it's worth more to get out."
-Roger Ebert on "Armageddon"</P>
