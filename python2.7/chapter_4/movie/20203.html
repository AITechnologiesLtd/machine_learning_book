<PRE>The Review</PRE>
<P>    Bowfinger, the new comedy written by and starring Steve Martin and
directed by Frank Oz takes on several Hollywood institutions, and has
a whole lot of fun along the way. An incredibly clever concept coupled
with the best acting the leads have done in years make this one of the
smartest comedies of 1999; this is saying quite a bit in the year of
Election, Drop Dead Gorgeous, American Pie and South Park: Bigger,
Longer & Uncut. The cast has a lot of fun and their energy is
transplanted on to us, the audience.</P>
<P>    Steve Martin is Bobby Bowfinger, a broke jobless producer who
wants desperately to one day make it big. His accountant and part time
receptionist Afrim hands him a screenplay for an alien action film
titled Chubby Rain (chubby because the aliens hide in the rain
drops). He loves it, assembles his team of usual two-bit actors and
hatches a plan to lure in bigtime director Jerry Renfro (Robert Downey
Jr.), which promptly fails. Once action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy)
also turns him down, he comes up wit the plan on which Bowfinger
hinges; shoot Kit Ramsey in the film without him knowing it.</P>
<P>    There is a parallel that can likely be made between Bobby
Bowfinger's excitement at coming up with his brilliant if implausible
idea, and Steve Martin's deciding to write the story. You can almost
see the glint that must surely have shone in Mr. Martin's eye when the
concept struck him. What if someone covertly filmed a big star, threw
actors at him to film spontaneous scenes and made a movie without the
actor ever knowing he or she was in it? The same glint strikes
Bowfinger as his assistant stalks Ramsey, tracking his every
move. This is Steve Martin's ode to Hollywood and all of its flaws,
hitting star power, Scientology (with a corporation called MindHead
run by Terrence Stamp) and even his former flame Anne Heche and her
coming out with Ellen DeGeneres.</P>
<P>    The humour moves between slapstick physical gags and biting
satire, mostly working. Innumerable scenes caused the audience to
laugh uproariously at my screening, often blocking out parts of the
dialogue. Scenes involving Bowfinger's dog Betsy, a busy highway,
cheap special effects gags and a movie star who is absolutely clueless
from start to finish combine to make a damn funny movie. Eddie Murphy
is the perfect choice to play Kit Ramsey (though originally the part
was written for a white star, it was largely revamped for Murphy, with
great results). Much as Julia Roberts had no problem acting the part
of a spoiled Hollywood star in Notting Hill, Murphy slips into
Ramsey's flamboyant world with ease.  It is his best role in years,
and continues his tradition of playing multiple characters as he also
plays Kit's brother Jiff. Jiff is the most un-Eddie Murphy-ish
character he has ever played, and Murphy gets almost too silly with
it. Heather Graham is funnier than in Austin Powers 2, her previous
comedic effort, yet still seems wooden at times. Christine Baranski is
more relaxed as Carol, Bowfinger's regular actress and Jamie Kennedy
is solid as Bowfinger's assistant.</P>
<P>    To appreciate this film, you have to lose yourself in the
possibilities of the concept. Forget for the duration that it is
highly implausible that such a scam could ever be pulled off. Forget
the fact that you've seen Eddie Murphy play multiple characters
before, and forget the fact that some of the physical humour that
Frank Oz stages doesn't quite work. Just lose yourself in the fun, in
the glee with which Bowfinger stalks Kit Ramsey and films him in a
lame sci-fi alien movie. Think about how silly Scientology seems when
it is parodied by MindHead, about the hilarious way in which Bowfinger
hires a film crew, and about how well-trained Betsy the dog is. This
is a highly intelligent comedy and a bit of a comeback for both Steve
Martin and Eddie Murphy. You'll feel good and giddy after seeing
Bowfinger. Trust me.</P>
