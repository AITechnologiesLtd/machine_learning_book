<PRE>My Left Foot (1989)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 73</PRE>
<P>"My Left Foot" is based on a true story, the life
of Christy Brown.  Born with cerebral palsy in a
lower middle class Irish family, Brown overcomes
severe physical handicaps and local prejudice
to become a noted painter.</P>
<P>"My Left Foot" is the only limb that works for
Brown.  The other leg and both arms are useless.
His face is eternally caught in an extreme
grimace, and he can only speak with difficulty.
He writes, paints, and moves about using only
his left foot.</P>
<P>"My Left Foot" isn't completely a story of triumph
over handicaps.  There are many painful scenes
of setbacks for Brown, at first when he is
unable to communicate, and later when he is
unable to find the romantic love he craves.
He can be verbally abusive, and sometimes he
drinks too much.  He is not above self-pity
either.  These unhappy scenes probably didn't
help at the box office, but they validate the film.</P>
<P>Daniel Day Lewis plays Christy Brown, and
deservedly won a Best Actor Oscar for his
performance.  Lewis is possibly the best
actor of our generation, and the quality and
variety of his film roles is impressive.
He was a fop in "A Room With a View", a
philanderer in "The Unbearable Lightness of
Being", and an impassioned prisoner in
"In the Name of the Father", all of them
outstanding films.</P>
<P>In supporting roles, Brenda Fricker is excellent
as Brown's mother.  She won an Academy Award
for Best Supporting Actress.  Ray McAnally
is Brown's father, an unemployed bricklayer
who struggles with his role as head of the
household.  Fiona Shaw plays a sunny social
worker and arts patron who helps Christy
face the world.</P>
<P>While "My Left Foot" is a very good film,
it is not without flaws.  There is a bar-room
fight scene played for laughs, which is perhaps
requisite to films based in Ireland, but
doesn't work in this case.  Also, the happy
ending seems artificial, even if it is a
true story.</P>
