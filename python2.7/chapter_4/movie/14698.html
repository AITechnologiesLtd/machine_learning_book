<PRE>REVIEW: Hope Floats
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</PRE>
<P>Cast: Sandra Bullock, Harry Connick Jr., Gena Rowlands, Mae Whitman,
Michael Pare, Cameron Finley
Director: Forest Whitaker
Screenplay: Steven Rogers
Australian distributor: Twentieth Century Fox
Australian theatrical release date: October 8, 1998</P>
<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
1 and a half stars</PRE>
<P>I'll admit my prejudice against modern dramas the day that Sandra
Bullock chooses a decent role.  I'll tell you about hundreds of these
awful films that have come and gone, the minute I block them out of my
memory.  And I'll write a write a better screenplay than that of Hope
Floats the second someone puts pen and paper in my hands.</P>
<P>As if A Thousand Acres and How Stella Got Her Groove Back weren't bad
enough, here is yet another film which tries to please everyone, and
ultimately pleases very few.  The screenplay by Steven Rogers is
harmless and innocent - and has good intentions - but is far too
harmless, and far too innocent.  At its worst, it is so afraid to insult
anyone that it ended up insulting me for sitting through it.</P>
<P>On a national TV talk show, Birdee Pruitt (Sandra Bullock) is humiliated
when her best friend reveals that she is having an affair with Birdee's
husband.  Birdee runs away from her problems with her young daughter
Bernice (Mae Whitman), and starts over in the town where she grew up,
located somewhere in Texas.  There she lands a job at the local photo
development shop, and awkwardly reunites with an old flame (Harry
Connick Jr.).</P>
<P>Sandra Bullock's last three films are proof that she is terrible at
choosing her roles - In Love and War, Two if by Sea and Speed 2: Cruise
Control were all box office flops.  Now with Hope Floats added to the
list of disasters, this promising young actress is definitely having a
hard time lifting her feet off the ground.  As for Harry Connick Jr.,
well, he looks a little out of place in a sissy film, as he has
previously left a vivid mark from Independence Day and Copycat.</P>
<P>At the risk of labeling Hope Floats as simply a "chick flick," lets just
say that only a small crowd would like it.  Whatever opportunity the
film has to jump into an engaging moment is avoided - sometimes
narrowly - but avoided none the less.  Give me pen and paper any day.</P>
