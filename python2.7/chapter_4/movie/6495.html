<P>     This is crap, but, honestly, what older American audience is going
to be able to resist seeing Jack Lemmon and James Garner as bicker- ing
ex-Presidents?  Especially when their supporting players in- clude Dan
Aykroyd as the current Commander in Chief, Lauren Bacall as a former
First Lady, and John Heard as the Dan Quayle-ish Vice President.  Yup,
you're talkin' pre-sold property here and, for Warner Brothers, the
perfect fit into their now-ritual GRUMPY OLD MEN holiday slot.  For the
non-discriminating viewer, MY FELLOW AMERICANS is fine.  The raw star
power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political-
thriller road-comedy.  (They did in mine, heaven help us.)</P>
<P>    For the rest of us, the movie is immediately tiresome.  The tone is
terrible and the banter is worse.  Forget wit-- Lemmon and Garner merely
exchange profanities through most of the movie.  (Has anyone counted the
number of First Penis references?) Sure, some of the bits are absurdly
funny, including a men's room Macarena joke, the appearance of an Elvis
impersonator on a trainload of Tarheels, and an All Dorothy Marching
Band performing "Over the Rainbow" at a gay men's march.  The get there
from here, though, you have to submit to one of the most offensively
overbearing musical scores of all time.  Judas Priest, is there a single
moment of silence in this film?  Even the dialogue gets drowned out.
What a waste.</P>
