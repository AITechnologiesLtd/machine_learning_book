<P>In yet another case of `Sundance Blues' – hype-heavy films bought for
big bucks at the famous January festival that fall flat upon theatrical
release – Frank Whaley's Joe the King is a stale coming-of-age story
that plays like a ‘70s Outsiders, only with rumbles replaced by roller
rinks.  Actor-turned-writer/director Whaley, probably best known as
Kevin Spacey's whipping boy in Swimming with Sharks, elicits good
performances from his actors, but his weak script is too much to
overcome.</P>
<P>The film opens in a blue-collar Upstate New York town with chain-smoking
nine-year-old Joe Henry (Peter Tambakis) reluctantly participating in
his school's `Career Day,' where students tell their classmates both
what job that they hope to have and what their parents' line of work
is.  Joe wants to be a crooner, just like the guys from his mom's record
collection.  He also tries to make up exciting jobs for his parents, but
the class reminds him that Joe's pop (Val Kilmer, At First Sight) is the
school's janitor, while his mother (Karen Young, Daylight) works in the
rug mill.</P>
<P>To make matters worse, when the girl in front of him says something
mean, Joe retaliates the only way he knows how – using the same violent
anger repeatedly taught to him by his drunk, abusive father.  Joe is
dragged to the front of the class by his teacher (Camryn Manheim, The
Practice), who rips his pants down and spanks him as his classmates
cackle.</P>
<P>Flash to five years later, where a teenaged Joe (Noah Fleiss, Josh and
S.A.M.) is malnourished and wears a dingy white tank-top, jeans and
Chuck Taylor sneakers.  Every adult that Joe comes in contact with is
owed money from Joe's now unemployed dad.  Joe is illegally working as a
dishwasher at a local restaurant, where he receives the majority of his
daily nutrients by eating discarded food from the plates he is about to
wash.  His school life is a mess, too, accumulating a whopping
fifty-four tardies in the academic year; and, predictably, he begins to
dabble in petty theft by shoplifting Ho-Hos.</P>
<P>As his relationship with his brother Mike (Max Ligosh, Hackers) becomes
stalled (he failed to back Mike up in a fight against the school
harelip), Joe's criminal offenses grow bigger and more daring.  Kilmer
even grunts a line at the end that pretty much sums up the film in one
line - `Stevie Wonder coulda seen that comin'.'  So could everybody in
the audience.</P>
<P>In Whaley's defense, the film does look pretty decent and, like most
actor-turned-directors, he extracts strong performances, especially from
the kids in the film.  Kilmer, who must gained about sixty pounds for
his role, finds himself in a role with slightly more screen time than
when he played Elvis in True Romance.  I think it was probably one of
those you-don't-have-a-chance-of-making-your-stupid-movie-unless-you-
get-a-big-star-in-it deals, so Whaley called in a favor from his
co-star from The Doors.  Ethan Hawke, Whaley's A Midnight Clear co-star,
also appears in the film as a guidance counselor.</P>
<P>Incredibly, Whaley's script shared the Waldo Screenwriting Award at this
year's Sundance Film Festival.  I think he shared it with Runaway
Bride.  If it's supposed to be autobiographical, or semi-autographical,
I guess you can't fault the guy for not wanting to alter what is
essentially the story of his youth.  But, at the same time, it doesn't
make the movie any more interesting.</P>
<P>1:33 - R for language and abusive situations concerning a child</P>
