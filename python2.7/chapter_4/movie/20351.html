<PRE>Throne of Blood (1957)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 91</PRE>
<P>"The Seven Samurai" is generally considered
to be Kurosawa's best work.  But my favorite
film from the Japanese director is his
inspiration from Shakespeare's "Macbeth",
"Throne of Blood".  Adapted to feudal Japan,
it is the story of the rise and fall of a
samurai due to murderous ambition.</P>
<P>Washizu (Toshiro Mifune) and Miki (Minoru Chiaki)
help the warlord Tsuzuki (Takamaru Sasaki)
put down a rebellion.  They are granted an
audience with the warlord, but while travelling
to the warlord's Cobweb castle, they encounter
an evil spirit (Chieko Naniwa) in the forest.
The spirit tells their future: Washizu will
soon become the ruler of Cobweb castle, with
Miki's son succeeding him.</P>
<P>The spirit's predictions are destined to become
true.  Washizu is prodded by his scheming wife
Asaji (Isuzu Yamada) to kill Tsuzuki and take
his place.  Washizu's success begins to unravel,
however, due to suspicions and betrayals.
He just doesn't know when to stop.</P>
<P>Mifune was perfectly cast as Washizu.  In
"Rashomon" and "Seven Samurai", his character
was half lunatic.  Here, the wild eyes and
aggressiveness remain, but his character is
more rational, and from a higher social class.
However, the most interesting character is
Asaji.  Her face is an expressionless white
mask, which combined with her murderous,
manipulating comments creates a chilling effect.
"Throne of Blood" has been criticized for its
slow parts, such as the Tsuzuki funeral procession,
but even that sequence has suspense since
the actions of Miki are unknown.</P>
<P>Kurosawa was co-producer, editor and co-writer,
as well as director.  He would again borrow from
Shakespeare for 1985's Ran, which was based on
"King Lear".  Like "Throne of Blood", "Ran" also
took place in feudal Japan and blamed a wife
for the destruction of an empire.</P>
