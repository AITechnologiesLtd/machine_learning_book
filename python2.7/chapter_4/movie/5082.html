<PRE>                                COLD FEVER
                             (A KOELDUM KLAKA)
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A young Japanese travels across
          Iceland to visit the site where his parents died
          seven years earlier in this US-Icelandic-German-
          Danish co-production.  Masatoshi Nagase stars as
          the bewildered traveler who must figure out the
          rules of this strange land, often just to stay
          alive.  This is a modest, unassuming little story
          co-written by the film's producer, Jim Stark and
          the film's director Fridrik Thor Fridriksson.  It
          does for Iceland what Bill Forsyth films do for
          Scotland, present an affectionate if not entirely
          credible look at an eccentric but likable people.
          Rating: Low +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Atsushi Hirata is a stranger in a strange land.  He wanted to
spend his holiday in Hawaii, but his grandfather talked him into an
unusual family responsibility.  He has to trek across Iceland in the
dead of winter to the remote spot where his parents died seven years
before.  There he must perform a traditional Japanese memorial
ceremony.  Any journey through unfamiliar territory can be a mixture of
comedy and horrors and in the frozen Iceland of December the right (or
wrong) error could prove fatal.  (One ominous road sign asks in several
languages "Does anyone know you are going this way?")  In Jim Stark's
and Fridrik Thor Fridriksson's screenplay characters time and again
find they must put themselves in each other's hands or volunteer help
to others.  Sometimes it proves to be a wise thing to do; sometimes it
is a mistake.</P>
<P>     The most active character in the story is the landscape of
Iceland, a colorless combination of fog, ice, snow, and black rock.
Sometimes it looks dead only to come to life unpredictably spouting
volcanic geysers of hot water into the air.  In this mostly frozen
world Atsushi is a fish out of water, trying to understand the strange
Icelandic people and the rules they live by.  Notable among the people
he meets are a woman who claims to collect funerals (or rather pictures
and recordings of them), a bar of Icelanders who consider themselves
cowboys, and an incredibly rude and vulgar American couple.  Sometimes
Atsushi finds that going with the flow of the people around him is
dangerous, but sometimes fighting the tide is worse.</P>
<P>     Atsushi Hirata is played by Masatoshi Nagase, who seems to be
specializing in the role of Japanese tourist abroad.  He played a
similar character in Jim Jarmusch's MYSTERY TRAIN.  His character does
not convey a lot of emotion that is obvious to a Western audience.  And
much of his character's appeal is in the empathy of what he must be
feeling rather than his expressiveness.  Fisher Stevens and Lili Taylor
play the American couple whom Atsushi finds much more trouble helping
than it seems worth.  Much more appealing is the morbid but pleasant
fan of funerals, Laura, played by Laura Hughes.</P>
<P>     Not all that is in the script is original or even in good taste.
To create artificially some visual excitement on the first scene of the
frozen landscape of Iceland, Fridriksson borrows a touch from THE ROAD
WARRIOR.  There seem to be some scenes poking fun at the lack of appeal
of Icelandic cuisine that seem a little over the top.  The moral of the
story and what Atsushi has learned from his experience is a line simply
spoken at the end of the film and seems a bit pat and uninspiring.
Except perhaps for its setting this film is not going to win any awards
for originality or profundity or even for being highly articulate of
its theme.  But it is as amiable a film as many playing at local
theaters and from time to time even manages a few surprises.</P>
<P>     COLD FEVER is a likable if somewhat unoriginal road picture, even
it may not have much to say other than to accept Icelanders however
weird their customs are.  One wonders if the beautiful but forbidding
vistas of Icelandic landscapes, looking like views of another world,
will help or hurt Iceland's tourist business.  The film itself rates a
low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
