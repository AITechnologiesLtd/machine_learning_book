RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        The Sonny and Cher vehicle "Good Times" notwithstanding, William
Friedkin's directorial career started strong, with such distinguished
movies as "The French Connection," "The Exorcist," and "Sorcerer" (although
many critics hated that one) highlighting his résumé.  Then began the big
decline: "Cruising" and "Deal of the Century," followed by a brief return
to form with "To Live and Die in L.A.," and then a spate of films no-one
ever heard of--"Stalking Danger," "Rampage," and "Python Wolf."  The '90s
weren't good to him either: "The Guardian" (a "'Hand That Rocks the Cradle"
rip-off), "Blue Chips" (A "Hoosiers" rip-off), and "Jade" (a "'Last
Seduction" rip-off).</P>
<P>        Genre-wise, Friedkin has been all over the map, but for his latest
effort he's settled on the post-Vietnam military courtroom drama "Rules of
Engagement," and one can only hope this fine accomplishment is the
beginning of an upward trend.</P>
<P>        The film is a cross between "Platoon," "Three Kings," and "A Few
Good Men" (call it "A King, His Platoon, and a Few Really Bad Men").  It
follows the checkered career of Colonel Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson),
a decorated military officer who, after his successful part in the Vietnam
war, is given command of a special operations force off the coast of Yemen.</P>
<P>        Dispatched to provide evacuation assistance to the U.S. Embassy
under siege by hostile anti-American demonstrators, Childers finds himself
in the middle of a volatile situation in which three of his men are killed.
With pressure mounting, Childers orders his marines to open fire into the
crowd and after the dust has settled, 83 Yemeni men, women, and children
lie dead.  Charged with murder and facing a military court martial for his
role in the botched withdrawal, Childers calls upon his old friend retired
Colonel Hays Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) to defend him.</P>
<P>        Childers saved Hodges' life during a Vietnam ambush so Hodges, a
self-confessed "weak lawyer," owes him.  "I'm a good enough lawyer to know
you need a better lawyer than me" Hodges tells Childers.  Nevertheless he
takes the case.</P>
<P>        There's a nice, easy-going chemistry between Jackson and Jones that
keeps this film engaging.  In addition, Childers' moral dilemma of shooting
into an unarmed crowd when his men are dying all around him is given an
interesting treatment by screenwriter Steven Gaghan.  For the first half of
its running time, "Rules of Engagement" paints this situation jet black,
and then turns full circle and paints it entirely white, leaving the
pivotal "guilty or not guilty" outcome a true nailbiter.</P>
<P>        As loud and violent in the courtroom as in its combat sequences
(the latter try to out-muscle "'Private Ryan" but don't quite make the
grade), "Rules of Engagement" is a tense and gripping thriller buoyed along
by uniformly fine performances.  Complementing the splendid Jackson and
equally impressive Jones are Guy Pearce ("L.A. Confidential") as
prosecuting attorney Major Mark Biggs (he's tough as nails), Ben Kingsley
as the impotent U.S. Ambassador to Yemen, Bruce Greenwood as National
Security Advisor Bill Sokol (Greenwood plays Sokol with an oiliness of
Exxon Valdez proportions), and Blair Underwood as one of Childers' captains
who's called as a witness.  The only disappointment is Anne Archer, who's
once again subjected to playing The Wife (this time Ben Kingsley's) without
much more than that job description to work with.</P>
<P>        This fine cast and credible story is pulled together by the sure
hand of director Friedkin who, with this film, has given his sagging career
a much-needed shot in the arm.  For all of its familiar military scenarios,
"Rules of Engagement" is a much better film than anybody might have
expected.</P>
