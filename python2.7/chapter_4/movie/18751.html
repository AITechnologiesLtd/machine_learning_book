<P>SHANGHAI TRIAD, may not be the best film that Zhang Yimou has ever done, but
one thing is for sure.  He has matured his shooting style into a more
westernized concept.</P>
<P>Like most eastern films, the cinematography is usually still, that is, not
moving very much, and the actors do most of their movement within the
confines of the camera's angles, until the next shot sequence. SHANGHAI
TRIAD, shows that Zhang Yimou is becoming quite westernized in his style,
and is learning to make much smoother films in the process. Before, the
style was a bit on the mesmerizing side, sort of like watching their Chinese
master singers, who take twenty minutes to reach the center of the stage and
one can not even shake our eyes from them.  This attitude, has changed much
since RAISE THE RED LANTERN, several years back, when the camera rarely
moves, much like the characters inside the story never really do.</P>
<P>This film, if anything, is a statement, that places like Shanghai, are much
more westernized than the rest of the country.  And the story, is similar to
one that we might find in New York, or Chicago in the thirties. Basically,
Shanghai, is run by a trio of Mafia lords.  And while they appear to be
friends on the outside and in front of others, they all seem to be doing
something behind each other's back, to hurt each other as much as possible.
And caught in the middle are those smaller people that apparently do not
obey the rules of their individual boss.</P>
<P>Amidst all this is a singer, who has become the mistress of one of these
lords.  She is given a young man to be her servant, and while he is young
and learning, he is, unlike many others, a bit more curious, and
inquisitive.  He is the new member of a family that has long taken care of
this particular lord.  And, as expected, the mistress is having an affair
with someone whose connections to the inside of this particular boss seem to
be rather dubious.</P>
<P>As it happens, on a fateful day, the young man's father is killed in an
assault, and the clan is forced to flee to an island, to protect itself and
gather enough strength and direction to figure out what to do.  In the
process we find that the mistress is losing it, and that there are outsiders
that are trying to do away with this particular lord.</P>
<P>And in a bitter end, the lord wins the war, after many battles are lost.
And he has to dispose of many people along the way to protect both himself
and those around him.</P>
<P>Story wise, this is, as is usual in most of Yimou's films, a very sad film,
in that there is very little that the smaller, less powerful people can do
under the hands of the bosses who take the law into their own hands.... and
there is no government strong  enough to work with it, or to undo the feudal
system that runs much of the country.</P>
<P>The singer eventually meets her death, just like her lover.  Their
indiscretions revealed as a sign that these people were much better aware of
what was going on that was originally apparent.  The film even suggests that
the affair with the mistress was set up to catch one of these men unawares,
and catch him in his role as a traitor
to this family.</P>
<P>The film ends on a sad note, and although there is hope for one little girl,
and one eager boy, the system has won yet again.  The victims are the people
of the country that do not mean anything.  The beauty of the film, is the
subtlety with which Zhang Yimou sets up his film. We do not really know what
is going to happen until the
end, although we can suspect that something is up.  And the acting is sneaky
enough that it adds to the difficulty at figuring it all out. And perhaps,
this may be one of the reasons why Zhang does this.  By keeping the film
insidious, that is, in the hands of a system that was deplored by the
government, and done away with ( one hopes ), Zhang can do much work and
place the Chinese mainland on the cultural film market.  One wonders how
long he can survive doing it, since he is always under attack and pressure
by over eager government authorities who are constantly worried that his
work is subversive.  Well, were he allowed to leave China, chances are that
he would make a film and decry the injustices of the government, in stopping
the film community for petty ego ideals.</P>
<P>TO LIVE, still Zhang's most important film, although not his best, is the
perfect example of a film that the government does not wish to see or show
at all.  But as is the case, when something is made to be subversive,
everyone wants to see it.  Peking may not like it, but everyone in Shanghai
has seen it, though it is illegal to show
it and sell it.  China's government, like the bosses in this film will
eventually get theirs one gets the feeling.  When their cause wonders into
the needless realm where people are getting abused and used, it will fail
sooner or later.  Had the bosses, not been so corrupt, and fighting so damn
much amidst themselves, communism
might not have succeeded so well as it did. Everyone feared the gangs, and
the feudal lords. The new revolution provided a respite from that
viciousness.  But what the new people didn't know, as TO LIVE shows, is that
the bosses were about to get all centralized under one iron fist.</P>
<P>And films like SHANGHAI TRIAD, are a sign that the hold these powers have is
really tenuous, and will soon crack.</P>
<P>There are some wonderful touches in this film. The color filtering of the
camera for effects, is magnificently well thought out, and adds a certain
lyrical style to the film that Zhang has not displayed  before much.  And as
mentioned before, adding the moving camera to this mixt, makes the film even
more interesting.  Like the film noir style, which this resembles in color,
the camera moving in oddly lit spaces, creates a feeling of tension and
wonder..... and surprises always lurk in the corners.</P>
<P>Much can be attributed to the story in the film, which is, essentially told
from the boy's point of view.  He is the story.  And he sees it all, and
tells us what he sees.  Thus the camera, thematically, moves, just like we
see the boy move... a special touch, that adds so much style to this very
nice, and special film.  Replace the bosses with
the rulers in Peking and you still got the same story.......</P>
<P>Excellent film. Beautifully filmed, by a director that you can tell, knows
how to handle a camera.</P>
