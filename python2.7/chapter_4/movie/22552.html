<P>   We all know by now--from the movies if from nowhere else-
-that priests, ministers and rabbis can be as human as the
rest of us. We're not that surprised to find highly religious
people interested in sports.  In the intriguing documentary by
Aviva Kempner released this year, "The Life and Times of
Hank Greenberg," we learn that the great baseball player's
rabbi encouraged him to play an important game on the
Jewish New Year, the second-holiest day on the Jewish
calendar.  The cantor even interrupted his singing at the 
synagogue to inquire how Greenberg was doing.  The rabbi
and the cantor were modern adults living in the New York
City of the 1930s and 1940s.  Would you expect Buddhist
monks, the fellas who live in secluded areas in the Himalayan
mountains, to be human as well?  </P>
<P>   Here's a movie that insists they are.   In Khyentse Norbu's
film "The 
Cup," the sports-addicted monastics in question, though, are
Buddhist 
monks from Tibet who, having fled from the hated Chinese
regime in that
province, took up residence in a monastery in Northern India,
praying for 
the day they can return to a Tibet free from Chinese rule. 
"The Cup" is a 
slight film, hardly the sort of work that you'd expect to be
nominated by its 
country of origin for Oscar consideration, but this is exactly
what has
happened as the 38-year-old Bhutanese director, who is
himself a high ranking lama in the Buddhist faith, convinced
his little nation to enter the competition for the very first time. 
The movie premiered last May at the Cannes Film Festival
and will officially open in the U.S. in January 2000 after a
screening at the Sundance festival in Utah.</P>
<P>   With Khyentse Norbu at the helm, "The Cup," which is
based on a true story, is at base a one-joke comedy which
becomes repetitive even at its modest 93 minutes.  If this
were a Hollywood production it would be considered naive
indeed, barely fit for pre-prime time TV.  Consider, though,
that it involves non-professional actors--actual monks residing
in Northern India who were handed their lines on a day-by-
day basis and used their discipline and powers of
concentration to pull off a believable story.  The devotees of
Buddhism had to get out of bed at 4 each morning to conduct
their prayers so that they could be ready for Norbu's camera
during the remainder of the day.</P>
<P>   The opening scenes exist largely to acquaint a western
audience with the daily routine of the monastery as the
Buddhists, dressed in ocher robes, sit in the main hall to
chant their litany in the Tibetan language.  The story gets
under way as Geko (Orgyen Tobgyal) and his boss, the
abbot, or Khempo (Lama Chonjor), welcome two new young
people sent out of Tibet by their mother to get a Buddhist
education.  We note that some of the regularly-ordained
younger members, particularly the volatile Orgyen (Jamyang
Lodro) and his best friend Lodo (Neten Chokling), horse
around during the prayers, passing notes, making paper
planes, and in one case waking up an older monk who
customarily sleeps through the prayer services.  Norbu's
camera generally makes the point that the monastery is a
microcosm of any civilian society, with one of its members,
the aging Godu Lama, acting in what Geko describes as a
loony manner and smelling terrible.  "He stinks," is the way
the second-in-command discusses the fellow with his
superior.</P>
<P>   The big question, hardly one that has the audience holding
its breath, is: will the abbot allow the monastery to rent a TV
and satellite dish so that sports enthusiasts in the cloistered
halls can watch the championship World Cup soccer game
between Brazil and France?  Obviously the film's
transcendent point is: can a traditional society make room for
the modern world?  </P>
<P>   The second half is the more involving one as the adherents
prove that the Buddhist ideal of giving up all attachment is
one that they are far from ready to effect.  As the happy
troupe drive down the road to the local Indian with the dish-
rental business, they must figure out a way to come up with
the 350 rupees needed to haul the monastery's first TV up
the hill.  "The Cup" is a far cry from Martin Scorsese's
"Kundum," which portrayed the saga of a two-year-old boy
who finds out that he is the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai
Lama.  Though Scorsese's 1997 film also uses
nonprofessional actors who are as remarkable as Norbu's,
"Kundun"'s monks are up in the clouds while Norbu's are as
earthy as their present digs at the foot of the Himalayas. 
Jamyang Lodro is especially convincing as the vibrant 14-
year-old who brings his housing unit another step toward our
just-past century.</P>
