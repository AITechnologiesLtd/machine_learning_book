<PRE>Austin Powers:The Spy Who Shagged Me</PRE>
<P>Here we have the superior sequel to Austin Powers: International Man of
Mystery. This time Austin's nemesis, Dr. Evil, has traveled back in time to
steal our hero's mojo. Of course, Austin has no choice but to revisit his
swinging past in an attempt to regain said mojo and prevent Dr. Evil from
conquering the world. At its best, this movie is far funnier than the law
allows. Unfortunately, there are several slow spots with nary a chuckle.
Most of these unfunny moments involve Austin's romancing of Felicity
Shagwell. The romance does provide many a funny moment, but the film dwells
on it in too much detail. Besides, the funniest scenes are those involving
Dr. Evil, not Austin Powers. It just goes to show you -- Evil will win,
because Good is dumb! Anyway, this movie would be worth seeing just for the
hilarious credits, both beginning and ending, and it offers far more. I have
to give a final word of praise to two of the supporting actors. Seth Green
is brilliant as Dr. Evil's not evil enough son and  Rob Lowe does a
fantastic Robert Wagner impression.</P>
<PRE>Rating: Very Good</PRE>
<P>Ratings go like this: Abominable, Bad, Fair, Good, Very Good, Great, and
Perfect. As you might guess, most movies are Fair to Good. Very few movies
are either Abominable or Perfect.
