<PRE>SHAFT</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Directed by: John Singleton
Written by: Ernest Tidyman (novel), John Singleton, Richard Price, Shane 
Salerno</P>
<P>John Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson) is back after a 19 year hiatus. This time his 
enemy is a racist young punk named Walter Williams (Christian Bale), who 
killed a young black man and skipped off to Europe on bail. Now, two years 
later, Walter has turned up again and Shaft hasn't forgotten him. Walter's 
father, a rich real-estate agent, has seen to it that no one can pin 
anything on his son by scaring the only witness out of her mind and causing 
her to run. The witness is a waitress named Diane (Toni Collette), who saw 
the whole thing happen. Now Shaft has to track her down before the case goes 
to trial again. Assisting him are a narcotics officer named Carmen (Vanessa 
Williams), an unusual friend named Rasaan (Busta Rhymes) and his uncle, John 
Shaft (Richard Roundtree). Unfortunately for Shaft, Walter has a little help 
too, which comes from the local drug lord, Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey 
Wright). Now the two groups are in a race against time to find Diane, 
Shaft's group so she can testify, and Walter's group to try and silence her 
for good.</P>
<P>Okay, before everyone stones me for my low rating of this movie, let me say 
that I really enjoyed 1971's "Shaft". That version had an interesting plot, 
adept direction, and Shaft was a regular guy who we could relate to in some 
way. This version has none of these qualities. Singleton, who showed at 
least a trace of promise back in 1997 when he directed "Rosewood", seems to 
have lost his directing abilities. The plot, in this version, consists of 
nothing more than watching Shaft beat people up while delivering 
entertaining dialogue (my favorite line was: "Don't make me chase you more 
than fifty yards!"). Shaft was a normal guy back in 1997, but now he's been 
turned into some kind of super hero. I don't think I saw him so much as run 
out of breath throughout the film, much less face an opponent who could 
match up to him in a fight. I also found it puzzling and a little annoying 
that there was no womanizing on the part of Shaft in this version. I know, 
that sounds odd, but think about it - Richard Roundtree's Shaft was a cool, 
suave woman magnet. I don't even remember seeing Jackson's Shaft kiss a 
girl. It felt a little odd watching "Shaft" with all the sex sapped out of 
it.</P>
<P>It's not easy for an actor to carry an entire movie on his shoulders. Denzel 
Washington did it with "The Hurricane" and Angelina Jolie almost pulled it 
off in "Girl: Interrupted". Samuel L. Jackson is asked to do just this in 
"Shaft", but the script is too much of a dud for even this great actor to 
manage it. Don't get me wrong, it's a blast watching Samuel L. Jackson as 
the ultimate bad a**, but it's not enough to keep a movie going for long. 
The rest of the cast (with the exception of Christian Bale) does nothing to 
help Jackson carry the load, but I don't think they'd have been much help 
anyway. Richard Roundtree has little more than a cameo appearance, which is 
too bad since the audience went nuts the moment he showed up on screen. 
Vanessa Williams ("Soul Food") may not be the world's greatest actress, but 
she certainly deserved more screen time than she got here. Then there's poor 
Dan Hedaya ("Dick"), who shows up as a fellow officer, and looks woefully 
out of place throughout the film. Last we have Christian Bale, who was 
brilliant in "American Psycho", yet adds nothing to this film. Don't get me 
wrong, he turns in a great performance, but he plays a pathetic excuse for a 
villain. He's whiny and insecure and clearly no match for Shaft. The film's 
real villain is Peoples (or the script writers, depending on how you want to 
look at it), but he's not much more threatening than Walter.</P>
<P>I think one of the most irritating things about this new "Shaft" is that it 
plays more like a video game than a movie. The fight scenes go as follows: 
Shaft opens a door, guy jumps out, Shaft shoots him; Shaft turns a corner, 
guys jump out, Shaft shoots them. This got old and tedious after about ten 
minutes. In fact, that's the biggest problem with this movie; the entire 
thing felt old and tedious. Everything, from all the stereo-typical 
characters to the out of place soundtrack (except for the great Isaac Hayes 
score of course), felt old and dated, despite Singleton's attempts to change 
Shaft for the new millenium. Then there's the film's ending, which I'm 
obviously not going to go into in great detail, but after the movie ended I 
sat and pondered whether it was anti-climactic or realistic. I decided that 
since I had to think about it that made it anti-climactic, but you may 
disagree. So overall, what do I think of the new "Shaft" movie? I think the 
man should have stayed in the '70s. "Shaft" runs only 99 minutes, but it 
feels quite a bit longer. I'd recommend it only to people who worship the 
ground Samuel L. Jackson walks on (not that I can blame them for that) and 
give it two and a half out of five stars.</P>
