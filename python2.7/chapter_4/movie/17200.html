<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 stars</P>
<P>Fans of Robert De Niro are not often given the chance to watch him act
silly, so I guess all the hip-hoola surrounding the release of Analyze
This is justified.  What doesn't seem so justified is the common
appraisal of the film's script. The only really clever idea that the
three screenwriter's have developed is a funny concept: a Mafia bigwig
looses his nerve, and seeks help from an untainted shrink. You can
probably guess the type of jokes that will fill the following 90
minutes, as De Niro and co-player Billy Crystal share opportunities to
mouth off.  The comedy between these two - and, I guess, the film's
overall success - relies heavily on dialogue.  It then comes as good
news that the dialogue is punchy and fun; the kind of which would take
writers hours to get the timing just right.</P>
<P>It must be said, then, that Analyze This finds a constant comedic beat,
the kind that the recent Waking Ned Devine severely lacked.  But in this
case, solidarity is both good and bad.  If you appreciate a couple of
the film's early jokes, you'll probably appreciate most of its later
ones.  Unfortunately, Analyze This takes precious few risks, so nothing
in it feels particularly involving.  However much like Rush Hour, the
chemistry between its two protagonists generates enough laughs and
memorable moments to make a pleasing film experience.</P>
<P>Paul Vitti (De Niro) is a powerful New York gangster, and is under
constant threat of assassination and prosecution.  His tough guy image
is jeopardized when Vitti loses his edge.  He becomes the victim of
anxiety attacks (in one amusing scene, he attempts to persuade a doctor
that he has had a heart attack), and even finds television ads as enough
of a reason to break down and cry.  Vitti realizes that he must cure
himself before his reputation shatters, so he seeks the help of
psychiatrist Ben Sobol (Crystal).  Sobol has a young son and a fiancée
(Lisa Kudrow) that he is about to marry, so naturally helping Vetti is
not one of his primary concerns.</P>
<P>Robert De Niro is fun to watch as the extravagant Vetti, although his
performance is not to be mistaken as an excellent one.  De Niro's part
is simplistic and two-dimensional (sort of like a cameo that lasts for
an entire film) but constantly entertaining.  Billy Crystal is the real
highlight here.  Crystal never lets his talent or experience overshadow
his charm, and in Analyze This he has all the energy of an actor trying
to make it big, and all the passion of man who's worked twenty rewarding
years.</P>
<P>The biting chemistry between De Niro and Crystal is, at its best, shrewd
and entertaining.  Like other "concept" films (such as Groundhog Day and
The Birdcage), the concept behind Analyze This is exaggerated and
developed into a full length film.  For those who have had enough of
sight comedies and satires, Analyze This might just bridge the gap
between intelligent and funny films, whilst making a new gap of its own:
a smart movie that doesn't take enough risks.</P>
