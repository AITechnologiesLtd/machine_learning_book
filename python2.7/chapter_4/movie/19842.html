<PRE>LAKE PLACID
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Yes, it's true.  The right cast can save what would otherwise be an
awful movie.  Steve Miner's LAKE PLACID is living proof.</P>
<P>Think about it.  A horror movie about a killer crocodile who
mysteriously shows up in a lake in Maine and starts noshing on the
locals.  Does that or does that not sound like an instant candidate for
your list of the worst movies of the year?  Well, it isn't.</P>
<P>A horror movie that's proud to be a parody, LAKE PLACID doesn't have a
pretentious bone in its body.  The talented cast never makes the mistake
of taking the movie seriously, and David E. Kelley's biting script is
filled with deliciously sarcastic humor.  LAKE PLACID is the type of
movie that the supercilious THE HAUNTING should have been.</P>
<P>When we first see the lake in Maine that would have been called Lake
Placid (that name was already taken), Sheriff Hank Keogh (Brendan
Gleeson) is busy listening to music in his boat as a scuba diver works
below.  Something attacks the diver, but he can't get the sheriff's
attention.  By the time the sheriff pulls him in, he finds that
something has completely eaten off the bottom half of the diver.</P>
<P>Since there is a crocodile tooth left in the deceased, someone calls the
big museum in New York.  Of course, they send a paleontologist, Kelly
Scott, to investigate.  Crocodiles are closely related to the dinosaurs,
you see.</P>
<P>(We just got back from Australia, where we stayed at a cabin near a
lagoon where until recently a large crocodile lived, so the movie had a
certain resonance.  We also learned some crocodile facts, like the way
they never kill large game by eating them.  Instead, they always drag
the victim into the water and drown it first.  Also, they can't run very
far on land, but they can out swim any human in the water.  The movie
ignores all of these facts, but in such a broad comedy it is trivially
easy to suspend disbelief.)</P>
<P>As the big city woman Kelly Scott, Bridget Fonda is great as a woman who
thinks camping out means the Ramada Inn.  She's always worried about the
availability of toilets and the cleanliness of the glasses.  She also
can put people in their place faster than the crocodile can snap its
jaws shut.  "Could you be a little more condescending," she tells the
head of the small investigative mission, Game Warden Jack Wells (Bill
Pullman), when he thinks it's too dangerous for her.  "I don't deal well
with subtlety."</P>
<P>The other delightful highlights of the cast include a rich
crocodile-worshiping mythology professor Hector Cyr (Oliver Platt) and a
foul-mouthed farmer, Mrs. Bickerman (Betty White), who raises cows for
reptilian food.</P>
<P>When they come across a maggot-infested human toe, Hector picks it up.
"Is this the man who was killed?" he asks the sheriff, who despises
Hector.  "Seemed taller," the sheriff replies in his typically laconic
fashion.</P>
<P>Although the movie has a lot of dead spots, there are several large
laughs in it.  My personal favorite occurs when the crocodile attacks
the helicopter.  Perhaps the wisest part of the movie is that it has the
good sense to be very short.</P>
<P>LAKE PLACID runs 1:22.  It is rated R for violent creature attacks and
related gore and for language and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
