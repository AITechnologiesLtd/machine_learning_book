<PRE>                                  HOMICIDE
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     HOMICIDE is a film directed and written by David Mamet, produced by
Michael Hausman and Edward Pressman.  The film stars Joe Mantegna,
William H. Macy, and Natalija Nogulich.  Rated R for language and
violence.</P>
<P>     HOMICIDE is David Mamet's third film (HOUSE OF CARDS, THINGS
CHANGE) and has many fine qualities to recommend it.  However, it does
suffer in several areas, too, and can only be considered a qualified
success, at best.</P>
<P>     Joe Mantegna plays a Jewish cop, Bobby Gold, in New York City.
Mantegna has earned directors' and audiences' respect in a long string
of solid performances, including Woody Allen's ALICE, Francis Ford
Coppola's THE GODFATHER III, and (reportedly) Barry Levinson's BUGSY
(which will be opening soon in the Seattle area).  And Mantegna has a
history of working with playwright Mamet going back to their days in
Chicago's Organic Theater Company, as well as parts in Mamet's earlier
films.  Despite that, or perhaps because of it, Mantegna fails to give
us a convincing performance.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the lead character and the script itself are too heavily
invested with irony and the sense of the cosmic joke to not weigh us the
audience down with confusion and ambiguous reactions to Bobby Gold's
identity crisis.  More likely, neither the actor or the writer is able
to convince us that this detective, who has lived in New York's ethnic
olla for forty years, would suddenly suffer the conflicts of interest
and identity his is supposed to undergo.  He has to choose between his
partner (William H. Macy) and the beautiful woman (Natalija Nogulich,
who reminds me of Anglica Huston, between the fraternity of cops and
"being a Jew" as it appears to be defined within this context.  In one
night, we have a vast, desperate attempt to right the wrongs of a
lifetime.  But we have no idea where the energy for all this angst is
coming from.</P>
<P>     Beyond the motivational hole, we still have a wonderfully
atmospheric cop drama, shot by Roger Deakins, who was also the cameraman
for BARTON FINK.  Character parts are filled mostly by New York stage
actors and are suitably unfamiliar and eccentric.  The dialog is
hard-boiled cynicism, although one scene between Mantegna and Macy
sounds way too much like DRAGNET.  The film opens with great suspense
and violence and surprises; the subplot started there carries the film
forward with emotional and professional conflicts, as well as providing
chases and more violence.  Mamet shows great skill in this genre.</P>
<P>     I can recommend HOMICIDE, but matinee prices might make the
problems more palatable.</P>
