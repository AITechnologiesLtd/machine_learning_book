"Bridget Jones's Diary"</PRE>
<P>Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is 32 years old, 138 pounds, smokes like a
chimney, drinks too much and, worst of all, is still single. But, after
coping with a particularly nasty hangover following her company Christmas
party, she promises to turn over a new leaf in "Bridget Jones's Diary."</P>
<P>Book adaptations, especially one as narration heavy as Helen Fielding's
tome about a single woman in London, are a tough bet to put up on the big
screen successfully. It's nice to see the case where a good, entertaining
book is translated into a good, entertaining movie and director Sharon
McGuire and company give us exactly that in "Bridget Jones's Diary."</P>
<P>The story spans a year in the life of Bridget Jones, a researcher in a
publishing house who is constantly reminded by her family and friends that
she isn't getting any younger and it's time she found a man and settled
down. But this is not quite as easy as it sounds as the pool of eligible
single men dwindles with every passing year. When her boss, Daniel Cleaver
(Hugh Grant), begins to flirt with her via e-mail, she responds in kind and
a whirlwind romance ensues.</P>
<P>In the meantime, her mother (Gemma Jones) tries to set her up with a
barrister, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), at Christmas, but he thinks that
Bridget is an unintelligent young woman who smokes and drinks too much. It
doesn't help things when Bridget's mom reminds them that, as a little girl,
Bridget used to run around Mark's yard stark naked. As time passes, Miss
Jones realizes that Daniel is a two-faced liar and Mark is the one she
should be with for the rest of her life. But, will it happen?</P>
<P>You don't have to be a fan of the book to enjoy the movie, but that
familiarity does add an interesting dimension. One always has a critical
eye when it comes to a movie adapted from a book you enjoyed. "Bridget
Jones's Diary" also had some negative publicity over the fact that
Texas-born Zellweger was cast to play the quintessentially British Bridget.
In both cases, adaptation and actor, there is nothing to fear. The
screenplay, by veteran scribes Richard Curtis, Andrew Davies and the author
herself, captures the tone of the book perfectly and brings a sweet
romantic comedy to the screen. The humor is funny throughout and sometimes
bawdy, but there is virtually no nudity and the sex is almost chaste.</P>
<P>Renee Zellweger does a fabulous job as the weight and bad habit conscious
Bridget who decides that she will change herself and her life and begins
the title diary. Exercise and clean living are the keys to her change and
she makes a valiant stab at following through, but romance screws up her
plans when she falls for her slimy boss. Zellweger is perfect with her
understated London accent and put on weight to flesh out, so to speak, her
character. Within minutes of the start of the film, you see her as Bridget.
And Zellweger is willing to put, quite literally, her butt on the line, to
give a top comedy perf.</P>
<P>Supporting the inspired comic performance by the star are first class
showings by Grant, Firth and the rest of the cast. Hugh Grant does a turn
from his usual awe-shucks, bumbling nice guy and plays Daniel as a conniver
that will say and do anything to get his way. It's a good louse-of-a-guy
role and Grant does it justice. Colin Firth is also fine as the
stiff-as-a-board Mark who is initially turned off by the outspoken, brazen
Bridget. As he gets to know her, you watch his formality soften and he
falls, full smit, for the pretty Miss Jones.</P>
<P>Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones provide dimension as Bridget's dad and mom
who are in the midst of their own marital crisis when mom leaves dad to
pursue a career as a shill for a sleazy salesman on a shopping channel.
Their side story helps to flesh out the life of Bridget into something that
feels genuine, even in its absurdity. Embeth Davidtz, Shirley Henderson,
Sally Phillips and James Callis, as Bridget's supportive and sometime
critical friends, fit the bill.</P>
<P>Production credits are first rate with crisp, clear lensing by Stuart
Dryburgh complementing Bridget's costuming, by Rachael Fleming, and
production design, by Gemma Jackson.</P>
<P>"Bridget Jones's Diary" is the best date flick to come down the pike in an
awfully long time and may well bring in a new generation of fans to Miss
Jones and her diary. I give it a B+.</P>
