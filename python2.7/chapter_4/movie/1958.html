<PRE>                      DOPPELGANGER: THE EVIL WITHIN
                      A film review by Ken Johnson
                       Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>1:45, R, Suspense/Horror, 1992
Director: Avi Nesher
Cast: Drew Barrymore, George Newbern, Dennis Christopher, Leslie Hope,
      Stanley DeSantis, Dan Shor, George Maharis, Peter Dobson,
      Sally Kellerman</P>
<P>     Drew Barrymore, a young girl, is being bothered by her
doppelganger, that is killing off her family in New York.  She moves to
Los Angeles and moves into an apartment with George Newbern.  He finds
out about Barrymore's problem with her doppelganger and tries to help
her with it.</P>
<P>     DOPPELGANGER: THE EVIL WITHIN was just released to CBS/FOX home
video.  DOPPELGANGER is a reasonably good B-grade horror film and is
worth a rental if you enjoy the genre.  If you don't tend to enjoy
B-horror movies, then I would recommend that you skip this one.  On a
scale of zero to five, I give DOPPELGANGER a four.  DOPPELGANGER is
rated R for explicit language, graphic violence, and female nudity.</P>
<P>     DOPPELGANGER is reasonably well written.  The story line is
interesting and the film moves smoothly along.  The characters are
interesting and develop well.  The story line isn't overly
predictable.  Unfortunately, the ending to the film is a big let down.
It doesn't hook in well to the rest of the film and seems to be a big
cop-out.</P>
<P>     The acting in the film is reasonably good.  Drew Barrymore
(MOTORAMA, BEYOND CONTROL: THE AMY FISHER STORY) is great.  George
Newbern also does a very good job.  Dennis Christopher (JAKE SPEED,
STEPHEN KING'S IT) also does a good job.  Sally Kellerman (MEATBALLS 3,
THREE FOR THE ROAD) is definitely the low point of the film.  I wish
that someone else had been cast in her role.</P>
