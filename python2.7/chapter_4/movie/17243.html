NEXT STOP, WONDERLAND (director: Brad Anderson; cast: Hope Davis (Erin
Castleton), Alan Gelfant (Alan Monteiro), Hollan Taylor (Piper
Castleton), Robert Klein (Arty Lesser), Cara Buono (Julie), Jose Zuniga
(Andre De Silva) and Phil Hoffman (Sean), Victor Argo (loanshark) (1998)</P>
<P>Wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of
bricks falling on you. You can see its plot developing from a mile
away.You are lured into its benign story of a single 29-year-old girl
looking for a soul mate in Boston, as that city is depicted as a
mini-wonderland for singles. This is a star oriented film, and the star
who carries the film is Erin (Hope Davis). That this is a dating film,
about singles who for reasons of fate or luck, or whatnot, have not had
a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into
fulfilling their careers, is nothing new, this type of film has been
done often and better many times in contemporary films. The
fictionalized documentary UNMADE BEDS did it more provocatively and with
more of a sense of urgency than this film.The main quirk in the plot
here, is that Hope's pushy mother (Hollan) visits her in Boston, sees
her daughter's live-in relationship with a radical protester (Hoffman)
breakup and decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper for her
Harvard medical school drop-out daughter, who works as a nurse. This is
done without her knowledge. It is cornball sitcom stuff, but, at least,
it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director.</P>
<P>It is easy to like Erin, she is bright, caring, and attractively blonde.
It is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact
with, the financially strapped, ruggedly handsome, intelligent
35-year-old Alan (Alan), who no longer wants to work with his father as
a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending
college to be a marine biologist. Of course, he comes across as being so
good (though, he does kill some fish in the aquarium), that it is hard
to believe he's for real, or just some cardboard shining knight put into
the story to give it an ideal to shoot for. The contrived story revolves
around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as, the
subway, at a restaurant, or on the phone.</P>
<P>Alan's brother answers Erin's ad with a few of his pals, as they each
try to respond to her ad in a phony way, making a bet that the first who
gets to tongue kiss her, that the others witness, will win the bet. This
sub-plot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told.</P>
<P>That we have to see Erin go through several dates to prove the point how
ego sick these guys are, each one more annoying than the other,
culminating in the most obnoxious one of all, that Brazilian lover
(Jose), who is about as charming as a snake-oil salesman, who is
actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in Brazil, was
not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of
her character that was the heart of the story.</P>
<P>Anyway, as expected, all's well that ends well, for this watchable piece
of fluff, that comes over on screen better than it does when relating
its story-line. The dialogue was actually not bad, those dating Erin or
trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they
would actually say in their situation. And, oh, by the way, Wonderland
refers to the stop on the Boston metro, it is where greyhound racing
takes place.</P>
