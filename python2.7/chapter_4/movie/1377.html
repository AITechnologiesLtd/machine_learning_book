<PRE>                             DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST
                       A film review by Sarah M. Elkins
                        Copyright 1992 Sarah M. Elkins</PRE>
<P>DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST:        Produced in a 10-year labor of love by Julie Dash.
Highest recommendation.  Please go see it.  If you can't catch it on the
big screen, I noticed in the credits that American Playhouse helped
sponsor it, so it might pop up on public television sometime.</P>
<P>Plot/kick-off:        A black family which has been living pretty much in isolation
since the Civil War on Ibo Landing, an island off the coast of South
Carolina (near Kiawah and Edisto, for those who know the area) gathers
in 1902 for a last meal before leaving for the mainland.  Conflicts
between family members will be recognized by anyone who's felt the pain
of wanting to belong to something that's pulling itself apart.</P>
<P>Characters/acting:  Nana, the family matriarch, a "salt-water African"
(or a first-generation child?) who practices the old religion and wants
to stay on the island.  Her children, including the very Christian
Viola, who wants her to come to keep the family together, and Yellow
Mary, the richest of the family, outcast for being raped and becoming a
prostitute.  Nana's grandchildren, including Iona, who wants to stay
with St.  Julien Lastchild, the surviving Cherokee of the island
swamplands, and Eula, pregnant by either her husband or a white rapist.
There are other important characters whose names I didn't catch,
including a citified photographer, commissioned to capture on film the
family's last hours on the island.  I covet his photographs.</P>
<P>Cinematography/FX: Possibly the most uniquely beautiful movie I have
ever seen; certainly in my top 5.  From the gnarled trees with Spanish
moss to the water laying off the beach and shining in the tidal pools,
from the girls in their white cotton dresses running and dancing, to the
close-ups of conversations between Nana and her grandson-in-law in the
graveyard, and between Eula, Yellow Mary and Yellow Mary's friend:  the
deceptively simple episodes are layered together to make a rich, complex
masterpiece.</P>
<P>Score/Sound:  Not much sound, other than the voices in conversation and
sometimes in song; the background noise is formed by the water lapping
on the beach and the ever-present wind</P>
<P>Violence:  None, except the grandson-in-law's taking a board and
smashing up some of his grandmothers' religious symbols, in rage that
neither they nor he were able to protect his wife Eula from rape.</P>
<P>Language:  No profanities that I recall, but people who haven't heard
Gullah (the patois of English with Yoruba/Ibo intonation and grammar
spoken by blacks on islands off the Carolina mainland) before may take a
few moments getting adjusted to it before they can really follow what's
going on (subtitles in the beginning of the movie help), and there were
a few moments of speech which even I couldn't follow near the end, and I
heard Gullah off and on growing up and in college.</P>
<PRE>Skin/situations: a kiss</PRE>
<P>Analysis:  One of the best movies I have seen in years.  Maybe the best;
it will take me a while to absorb it, not that it can all be taken in at
one sitting.  Dash is a genius.  This is not some mundane
feel-good-and-forget-it flick, but there are moments which are --  I
can't express it in words without trivializing it -- uplifting,
cleansing, empowering.  It's like a series of poems, pictures and short
stories, interwoven in an outcircling spiral dance, with all parts
touching somehow.</P>
