<P>Before you jump on me too harshly for 'liking' this movie let me just
explain a few things. I have seen them all. Every major (and almost
every minor) schlock horror movie you can think of. I have seen; all of
the Kruegers, all of the Jasons, every holiday killer out there, every
scary fable come to life (I am especially waiting for a sequel to
RUMPLESTILTSKIN). I love cheese. The cheesier the better.  Cheesy,
pulpy, schlocky, and, most of all, bloody horror movies are extremely
entertaining to me. Mostly because I can make fun of the characters,
their stupidity, the unlikliness of their situations, the poor judgement
of the victims, the insane way the killer wastes the stupid students,
and, above all, the unwillingness of the killer to expire at the end.
Its FUN! I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER falls right in the middle of
this genre. This movie fits under the sub heading of 'Killer with a
grudge takes out everyone who had anything to do with original incident'
(PROM NIGHT, TERROR TRAIN, MY BLOODY VALENTINE). I give extra marks to
this film for finding a holiday that hadn't previously been chosen (to
the best of my knowledge) - The Fourth of July. Do I really need to tell
you what this movie is about? I don't think so. It is formula to the
end. But is also a lot of fun. It takes place in a small fishing village
fraught with plenty of sharp hooks and gutting instruments. Need I say
more? I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER isn't innovative like SCREAM but
it is fun for anyone who misses the days of the summer camp killers. 2 ½
spots (out of 4)</P>
<P>Favorite Line: Helens boyfriend: "You know I'm terrified of your
superior I.Q."</P>
