<P>For the first reel of Girls Town, you just can't get over Lili Taylor. 
Is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing 
a high school student? Harder still, can you avoid astonishment at how 
perfect she is in the part? With the sure, showy expertise of a De Niro, 
Taylor imbues unwed mother Patti with all the faux fuck-you confidence 
she can muster. It's a deeply felt, dead-on performance, and by the 
halfway point you've forgiven Taylor her own maturity. For all its 
verite pretenses, Girls Town is less about a bunch of high-schoolers 
than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer-performers 
examining their own feelings about rape, relationships, and American 
womanhood.</P>
<P>The movie's opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of 
four smart/sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation: 
Patti, Angela (Bruklin Harris), Emma (Anna Grace), and Nikki (Aunjanue 
Ellis). But about 10 minutes into the film, we get word that Nikki has 
swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life. The remaining girls 
manage to smug Nikki's diary out of her grieving mother's home, and page 
through it at Patti's place, investigating the root of Nikki's despair. 
What they find is cruel and galvanizing -- Nikki had been raped by an 
editor at a newspaper where she interned, and was privately questioning 
the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen.</P>
<P>Shell-shocked by the truth of the matter, the three girls begin to talk 
among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives. Emma 
says she was raped last year on a date with a football player. Patti's 
barely sympathetic, wondering what the hell Emma thought she was doing 
with her shirt off in a jock's car. And anyway, Patti's had her own 
share of guys who wouldn't take no for an answer. Pained, acrimonious 
debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry -- angry about the 
impossibility of saying no, and angry with themselves for being weak, 
for being naive, for putting up with it. "Why do we put up with it?" 
Emma finally asks, once the argument has reached a fever pitch. "We try 
to talk about it, and look what happens. We fight for 20 minutes."</P>
<P>There's the admirable crux of this picture. Girls Town is a political 
film, in that it calls for action. But it's incomplete-it's never quite 
sure how to justify that action, or what form it should take. The trio 
become crusaders for their right to dignity, and it's surely one of this 
year's most stirring movie moments when Emma lobs a concrete block 
through the passenger-side window of that damn jock's car (doing the 
right thing?). They hang out in the bathroom, chatting incessantly and 
scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall. 
"Subvert the patriarchy," Emma writes, and then starts a hall of shame 
list underneath that other students begin to contribute to. The girls 
silence their hecklers, take revenge on the deadbeat father of Patti's 
child, and eventually come face-to-face with Nikki's tormentor. Still, 
the movie has a desperately unfinished quality, and none of these 
subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying. (You keep waiting for 
someone to call the cops on these brazen girls, but nobody thinks of 
it.) Perhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at 
hand, the film borrows its epigraphs from Audre Lorde and Queen Latifah 
("Who you callin' a bitch?"). The points are well taken, but they should 
have been unnecessary.</P>
<P>Long on characterization but a little short on story, Girls Town is less 
than it could have been, and too self-congratulatory for my own taste. 
Director Jim McKay is best known as a consort of R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe 
(he directed the nearly unwatchable Tourfilm for that band), and Girls 
Town is his first foray into feature filmmaking. The movie was created 
and scripted by committee, but McKay and his lead performers had to 
shoot on a shoestring when, predictably, the group couldn't secure 
funding. </P>
<P>Then again, Girls Town on a budget would hardly be the same film. The 
movie's slapdash quality is key to its significance. Truth be told, all 
three of the leads look too wise for high school, but that's OK -- 
there's a once-removed quality to their fine, spontaneous performances, 
as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were, 
the girls they wish they had been, or some combination. For all its 
flaws, this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and 
heart in the same noble place. </P>
