<PRE>                RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES: THE SEQUEL
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>This review is part two of a series which, in order, includes
ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES, RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES:
THE SEQUEL, and KILLER TOMATOES STRIKE BACK!.</P>
<P>98 min., PG, Comedy, 1988
Director: John De Bello
Cast: Anthony Starke, George Clooney, Karen Mistal, Steve Lundquist,
      Charlie Jones, John Astin, "Rock" Peace, Frank Davis,
      Ian Hutton, John De Bello</P>
<P>     The tomato war is over and now tomatoes are illegal in the United
States.  Many young people smuggle tomatoes into the States because they
don't know the dangerous side to tomatoes.  Anthony Starke is a pizza
delivery boy, who creates and delivers pizzas that contain no tomatoes.
Evil doctor Gangrene, John Astin, is trying to make human soldiers from
tomatoes that will rule the world.  Beautiful Karen Mistal and Fuzzy
Tomato, a mutant tomato that has hair, escape from Austin's laboratory
and they go to Starke for help.  Starke and George Clooney, his friend,
have to stop Astin and his evil scheme.</P>
<P>     RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES: THE SEQUEL is the sequel (surprise!
surprise!) to the horrible film ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES.  It is
followed by the pitiful film KILLER TOMATOES STRIKE BACK!  Actually
RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES is not really a true sequel to ATTACK OF
THE KILLER TOMATOES!, but instead makes fun of ATTACK and B movies in
general.  On a scale of zero to five, I give RETURN OF THE KILLER
TOMATOES a four.  RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES is rated PG for adult
situations and brief female nudity.</P>
<P>     The acting in this film is much better than in the first one.  John
Astin, of the television show "The Addams Family" (not the movie), gives
a great performance as the evil doctor.  As well as being sinister,
Astin makes his character amusing.  Karen Mistal, CANNIBAL WOMEN IN THE
AVOCADO JUNGLE OF DEATH (despite its title, a very good film), is
beautiful and a great actress.  She does a great job in her role,
though some people may say an actor or actress in a B movie can't do a
great job.  FT (Fuzzy Tomato), no matter how unrealistic, is, just
possibly, the best part of this film.  The worst actor in the film is
"Rock" Peace.  His performance makes me wonder how he ever got a role
in this series.</P>
<P>     The film does a great job of making fun of B movies.  Some of the
best parts were about running out of money and commercial placement.
The film also does a great job of making fun of ATTACK OF THE KILLER
TOMATOES, but those jokes will probably only be caught by people who
have seen the original film.  I highly recommend this film to any B
movie fan or movie buff (whether you liked ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES
or not).</P>
<P>     One last note, sadly one of the few funny gags from ATTACK OF THE
KILLER TOMATOES, the carrot joke, is re-used at the end of this film,
making it no longer funny.  I wish John De Bello had left it out of
this one.</P>
