<P>Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton, Virginie Ledoyen, Guillaume
Canet. Directed by Danny Boyle. Rated R.</P>
<P>After a weirdly long two-year hiatus, the Titanic heartthrob is finally
back on screen but with a whimper rather than a bang. He has chosen The
Beach, an unusual film with a woefully confused script, one that
obviously wants to say something but is not sure what. Leonardo
Dicaprio's intense presence brings a visceral quality to the
proceedings but doesn't make the movie any less pretentious.</P>
<P>Someone should explain to Danny Boyle (Trainspotting) why most
directors take a few minutes at the beginning of the movie to let us
get accustomed to the characters, because Boyle forgets. He jumps
abruptly out of the starting gate with a voiceover from our
protagonist, a young tourist named Richard (DiCaprio). Richard is in
Bangkok -- why he is there and where he is from, we are not told. He is
exploring, experimenting with the city's vibrant culture (this, of
course, involves drinking some tasty-looking snake blood), looking for
something bigger than himself. Sitting in his ratty hotel room one
night, he encounters a crazy guy named, not surprisingly, Daffy (Robert
Carlyle) who tells him about an island paradise, an idyllic world of
white sands, clear waters and all the pot you can smoke.</P>
<P>Daffy also gives Richard a map, detailing how to get to the island. He
recruits a French couple next door, Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and
Etienne (Guillaume Canet) and they are off in search of paradise. After
no small amount of effort, they finally reach their destination only to
be shot at by some mysterious marijuana farmers. They run off to the
other side of the island where they find what they were looking for --
a society of settlers living off the land. They rarely get off the
island and when they do, they are bound by a code of secrecy: the
farmers on the other side agreed to let them stay under the condition
that no other people come. The settlers, led by a mildly obsessed lady
named Cindy (Tilda Swinton) accept Richard, Francoise and the foxy
Etienne into their circle, but Richard realizes that he gave a copy of
the map to a bunch of pot-smoking idiots back on the mainland, possibly
endangering the future of this paradise.</P>
<P>There are, of course, chase scenes, shark attacks and other such
diversions. These are handled quite well by both Boyle and Dicaprio.
Boyle keeps the suspense up and Dicaprio is starting to show a real
screen presence, even if he still isn't the most expensive of actors.
Indeed the visceral level of The Beach has no problems at all, helped
out in a big way by the gorgeous scenery. Filmed in Thailand, the movie
is covered when it comes to sand and water. What it could have used to
supplement the pretty pictures is a clear sense of where it was headed
and what it was trying to say because the version that makes it onto
the screen is hopelessly lost within itself.</P>
<P>About halfway through, the storyline curves sharply. The protagonist
seems to become a modern-day Tarzan, going halfway insane and the movie
becomes annoyingly self-conscious. Its final message -- that there is
no such thing as paradise but the fun moments you have will last
forever -- is outrageous. What fun times? Almost being eaten alive?
Getting shot at? Having to leave a shark-bitten friend in the woods to
die? I have a feeling Boyle is trying to kill too many birds with one
stone here and as a result confuses himself -- and us -- completely.</P>
<P>Still, a lot of people are apt to walk away happy from this. Leo fans
will be delighted, as will fans of suspense genre films. But The Beach
overreaches its aim and when all is said and done, it falls flat on its
face thematically, if not viscerally.</P>
