<PRE>     I LOVED THIS FILM!</PRE>
<P>     FEAR OF A BLACK HAT presents a moral dilemma, in that it clearly
"steals" from SPINAL TAP.  But like an alchemist, black baby boomer
Rusty Cundieff has improved the content, and what he delivers is "solid
gold."  Members of the younger and more moral generation, beware.</P>
<P>     CONCEPT: "Nina Blackburn" follows a Rap group, "NWH" (Niggas with
Hats) across the country on their "Itchy Dick" tour to make a
documentary about this "art form".  The performers give deadpan
explanations for why songs like "Kill Whitey" aren't racist or
potentially an invitation to violence.  ("You see, man, we just meant
this *one* whitey, not all o' 'em.")  The actors are convincing in
taking themselves and the songs totally seriously, which creates high
camp comedy.  Though ludicrous explanations for why the "butt" is like
society cross the line on good taste, only the comfort level of
mainstreamers who avoid rap music like the plague would be violated.
(P.S.  If you were upset by my review of MAN BITES DOG, definitely do
*not* see this film!)</P>
<P>     Up-to-the-minute issues are exploited (e.g., the rappers being
interviewed with riot-ruined Central L.A. in the background, an
interview on MTV where the lead female backup singer is accused of
lipsynching in a CC Company "Everybody Dance" send-up.)  You'll savor
the video's images of her struggling with her out of control scarf,
sandwiched between bobbing fluorescent tubes.</P>
<P>     The entirely original soundtrack is sheer genius, and if you didn't
pay close attention to the lyrics, it could pass for the real article.
We can only hope that the soundtrack will soon be released, a la SPINAL
TAP.</P>
<P>     Though this film owes more than the national debt to SPINAL TAP, it
benefits from our intervening 10 years worth of exposure to MTV.  The
director/writer *knows* his target, and a half dozen take-offs on MTV
videos interspersed throughout the film will have you rolling in the
aisles.  Many a scene is a virtual xerox of SPINAL TAP, (for instance
when NWH is stalled from an entrance by an uninformed security guard,
props don't show up and they're expected to perform with*out* hats, one
member showing off his collection of assalt weapons instead of
amplifiers.)  Some of the steals are brilliant improvements, for
instance: instead of showing the audience the "Sniff the Glove" album
cover, as in SPINAL TAP, this film lets you deliciously create your own
depraved image of an unshown album cover that features 15 white cops in
highly submissive positions.</P>
<P>     The film is spray painted with non-stop profanities, and racy
images, hence almost anything quoted from the film will suffer being
taken out of context.</P>
<P>     One of the stronger moments in the film is when NWH appears in a
grammar school class room, with their hated rival rap group, as part of
the "Rappers Against Violence" program.  You can imagine the result.
One false move and this scene would have fizzled.  It didn't.</P>
<P>     Rusty Cundieff as writer/director/lead actor is clearly having the
time of his life making this film.  And the audience won't feel left
out.  Cundieff walks a fine line in that he runs the risk of magnifying
overplayed racial stereotypes.  However, with black actors and director,
fully in control of the film's content, slyly winking at the audience
through the ridiculous lyrics, the effect at Sundance was blacks and
whites laughing out of control, together.</P>
<P>     I don't know if a distributor has picked up this film or not, but
it'll probably at least make midnight shows in rep houses.  Judging by
the audience reaction at Sundance, it stood a fair chance to win
competition as the audience favorite.</P>
