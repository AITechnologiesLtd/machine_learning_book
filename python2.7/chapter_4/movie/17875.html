<P>     Scratch the thesis set forth in the review of Never Been Kissed.
Hollywood, as the year goes on, becomes progressively worse.  Why?  Because
you don't expect it to be bad.  Through some constant naiveté that the movie
buff displays of believing that movies will somehow ever improve, they
forget that the movies are destined to fail.  In January, when we all expect
bad movies, they are not as much of a disappointment.  In February, as
things start to improve, they are mildly surprising.  In November and
December, they're downright shocking.  In April I was greeted by the
terrible movie Forces of Nature, after seeing a streak of fairly good
movies.</P>
<P>     Forces of Nature follows Ben Holmes (Ben Affleck) in his undying quest
to marry his undying love, Bridget (Maura Tierney).  Note the key word here
is undying.  No matter how much you want someone to croak, no one does.</P>
<P>     Ben, your basic neurotic blurb writer whose afraid of flying, goes down
to wed his bride in good old Savannah, George on a flight out of La Guardia
that doesn't make it off the ground due to birds flying in the engine.  This
is only the start of his troubles.  He saves the life and befriends the wild
and tediously uninteresting Sarah Lewis (Sandra Bullock), who manages to get
him a ride with pot smoking Vic, and basically manages to screw up every
single chance he would ever have of getting married.</P>
<P>     Ben, Sarah, and Bridget are your basic stock characters, pulled out of
the closet of Dreamworks' dying creative ability.  Ben you would find in the
dictionary under neurotic, stupid, and sappy.   Sarah you would find under
psychotic, can't hold a job, and new-age.   Of course, as always in the
cinema, opposites get over their initial revulsion to one another and
attract, ending up being a match made somewhere in hell.</P>
<P>     Of the many virtues that screenwriter Marc Lawrence declined to give
this film, comedy and drama reign supreme.   Although you can see that the
film is trying to be funny, is trying to touch your heart, it ends up about
as touching and funny as your standard action film.  If the guy really
wanted to turn out something enjoyable, he should have handed Uzi's to the
two main characters midway through the movie and had them shoot their way to
Savannah past drug dealers on their tail.  It would have at least been an
unexpected plot twist.</P>
<P>     The only thing the film actually succeeds in doing is being
predictable, which any old idiot with a pen can do.  I talked to a theatre
employee afterwards who had a much better ending to the movie than the one
put in front of me.  In its effort to make a twist, the film ends up taking
a turn for the worse (if such a thing is possible) at the ending.  For that,
I suppose you can say that it will come as a surprise to the majority of
moviegoers... but not to this one.</P>
<P>     I would like to claim that without the stupid and supposedly surprise
ending the film would be half-decent, but it wouldn't.  Who are we kidding,
anyway?  Forces of Nature not only was the terrible film of the day, it was
the terrible film of the year.  It was almost as bad as The Mod Squad, which
set a new low for the already low genre of action movies.  Forces of Nature,
too, bottoms out its genre.  Even The Wedding Singer, my previous pick for
worst romantic comedy ever, made me laugh at one point.  In Forces of Nature
the only time my mouth opened was to say, "I've been there" when the two
main characters arrive at a place called "South of the Border" which is
about an hour south of my old home.  Yeah, they don't get much worse than
Forces of Nature.</P>
<P>     But, hey, look on the bright side: if you're a masochist, it's just
what the doctor ordered.</P>
