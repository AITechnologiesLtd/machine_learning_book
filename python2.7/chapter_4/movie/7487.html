<PRE>                                MICKI AND MAUDE
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Micki and Maude (1984) * out of ***** - Cast: Dudley Moore, Amy Irving, Amy
Reinking, Richard Mulligan, George Gaynes, Wallace Shawn. Directed by: Blake
Edwards. Running Time: 118 minutes.</P>
<P>Absolutely appalling "comedy" about everyone's favorite comedic subject:
bigamy. Moore is married to Reinking, a career woman who's too busy to have
a family at the moment. Moore, who just adores children, immediately has an
affair with Irving. When Irving becomes pregnant, Moore does the proper
thing and marries her... but doesn't bother to divorce his first wife! The
kick is, now she is also pregnant! Let the comedy begin!</P>
<P>This is basically every episode of "Three's Company", as it follows the
guidelines for "farce" right by the book (Moore having to be in two places
at once, etc.). For example, both women go into labor at the same time! What
fun!</P>
<P>People have described "Micki and Maude" as sweet and good-natured. Some
people have a strange idea of entertainment. Just watch the final scene of
the film and think about it for a moment, then decide how "sweet" it really
is. Director Edwards again proves to me that without Peter Sellers, he's
nothing. [PG-13]</P>
