<P>   That there's nothing new under the sun certainly applies to
"The Man in the Iron Mask," given a picturesque treatment by
Randall Wallace in his directorial debut.  More often than not,
a theme in a given movie will bear a biblical prototype.  The
key event in "The Man in the Iron Mask" could have come
right out of Samuel, Chapter 11, describing a sleepless night
of King David who, strolling on the roof of his palace, looked
out over the city and noticed a woman of unusual beauty
taking her evening bath.  Told she was Bathsheba, the wife of
Uriah, David sent for her, slept with her, and got her pregnant. 
David wrote a letter with instructions to put Uriah at the front
of the hottest part of the battle with the Ammonites and then
to pull back and leave him to die.  Uriah was killed along with
other Israeli soldiers.  Those with political power get the
women, though, of course, they never know whether the
affection which the females bestow on them is for the crown
or for themselves.  </P>
<P>   In this adaptation of the story by Alexander Dumas, when
King Louis XIV (Leonardo DiCaprio) of France, like his
counterpart in ancient Israel, sets eyes upon the fair Christine
(Judith Godreche), seduces her and sends her boy friend
Raoul to die.  What makes that the determining event in the
tale is that this malicious act leads to a demand for
vengeance by Raoul's father, Athos (John Malkovich), and
generates a final split between D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne),
who has remained a Musketeer pledged to the service of the
king, and his now-retired colleagues Athos, Aramis (Jeremy
Irons) and Porthos (Gerard Depardieu).</P>
<P>   "The Man in the Iron Mask" is a narrative of lust, romance,
battle and intrigue pitting the loyalty of the leader of the king's
guards, D'Artagnan, against the justifiable hate of his former
comrades-in-arms.  Believing his oath to be sacrosanct,
D'Artagnan refuses to break ranks with the man who
succeeded good king Louis XIII, despite his lord's contempt
for the starving populace and scorn for the most intimate
relationships of his loyal subjects.  Once Raoul has been sent
to his death at the front in a war with the Dutch, director
Wallace focuses on the mysterious man in the iron mask, a
hapless victim of the king's justice who has been sentenced to
spend his life in the Bastille, head affixed with a metal cover
sealed in with a locked, overlaid encasement.  We learn the
identity of the eponymous victim in due course but for those
who have never read the classic comic, far be it from any
critic to reveal the secret.</P>
<P>   Though this version of Dumas's adventurous melodrama is
played straight, there is no absence of humor, both desired
and unintended, with Depardieu supplying the occasional
comic relief.  The most ludicrous of the former musketeers,
Porthos (Depardieu), suffers the fate of many senior citizens
and those approaching the age: he feels useless, unable
even to "straighten his sword" when in the hay with three
women, and intent on suicide.  Aramis, a priest who is looked
upon by his comrades as overly pious, has designs on the
throne that go beyond his priestly duties while Athos is hell
bent on overthrowing the monarch and replacing him with a
kinder and gentler man.</P>
<P>   Like others of the genre, this swashbuckler is awash with
dazzling costumes whose display reaches a climax in a
masquerade ball, which features each member of the court
dressed in evening best with one arm on his partner, the
other supporting a mask.  Costume designer James Acheson,
working with an ample budget, pulls out the stops with an
array of extravagent threads particularly those who flatter the
king's trim body, while production designer Anthony Pratt,
filming exclusively in France, sets most of the action in a
studio on the outskirts of Paris.  But costumes and design
hardly make a movie: this "Man in the Iron Mask" is
disappointingly short on swordplay, the sort of action exploited
so remarkably by actors of past decades like Errol Flynn and
Tyrone Power.  Featuring dialogue which is at worst wooden
and at best somewhat short of inspiring, "The Man in the Iron
Mask" is unlikely to excite the teens who will turn out in force
to see their hearthrob, Leonardo DiCaprio but will find him to
be more effete than regal in the role of the Sun King.  Gabriel
Byrne and John Malkovich are fine as former associates in
the King's Royal Guard who are now at odds with each other,
but the Dumas classic is given routine treatment by its all-star
cast.</P>
<P>   A swashbuckling tale like "The Man in the Iron Mas" was an
obvious choice for a Hollywood movie and, in fact, has been
tried several times before in the guise of "The Three
Musketeers."  Rowland V. Lee directed a dull version in 1935,
Allan Dwan used Don Ameche as D'Artagnan in 1939,
George Sidney highlighted Lana Turner and Gene Kelly in
1948, Richard Lesler helmed a tongue-in-cheek version in
1974 starring Richard Chamberlain, and Stephen Herek used
Charlie in his 1993 escapade with lots of action
and bright Austrian settings.  "The Man in the Iron Mask"
could have been better with a more authentic setting, using
French actors, the French language, and far more action. 
Though director Wallace moves along at breakneck speed,
not hesitating to distract the performers every few minutes
with a new episode, the movie has the feel of a labored
historical drama when it should seeth with cries of revenge
and death to the tyrant. Rated PG-13.  Running time: 130
minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
