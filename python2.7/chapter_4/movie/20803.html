<P>Watching Sam Mendes's "American Beauty" is like taking a roller coaster tour
through suburbia - gleeful yet observant that something awry may be happening
in each house of each neighborhood. "American Beauty" is the latest 90's view
of dysfunctional families of America, a fascinating, complex, irritating,
grandiose and finally (and purposely) uneven satire. </P>
<P>Kevin Spacey stars as the hapless, droll Lester Burnham, a magazine writer for
a bland organization run by bland businessmen who seemed to have emerged from
the offices of the film "In The Company of Men." He is unhappily married to his
frantic wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), a real-estate agent whose sales have
depleted due to the new local hotshot honcho in town (Peter Gallagher). They
both have a smug, obnoxious daughter, Jane (Thora Birch) whose sole intent in
life is to have augmented breasts. </P>
<P>Their new neighbors are not any less strange or threatening to suburbia. There
is the intensely coiled former Marine (Chris Cooper) and his catatonic wife
(Allison Janney, in an atypical role), and their son, Ricky (Wes Bentley), a
video camera freak with a steely gaze in his eyes - he has the ability to see
the beauty in things. </P>
<P>There is a dichotomy in the breakdown of these two families. As far as the
Burnhams are concerned, Lester and Carolyn (their sexually frustration always
in check) listen to dinner music while eating, and Jane (who hates her parents)
brings her best friend, a seemingly teenage blonde nymphette named Angela (Mena
Suvari), for sleepovers. Angela admits that Jane's father is cute, and claims
she wants to have sex with him.  </P>
<P>Ricky's family has deep seated hatred towards Jews and homosexuals. His Marine
father does not want his son Ricky to resort to drugs use anymore, and
regularly beats him if he touches his belongings. Ricky draws more attention to
his video camera and films Jane and the rest of her family through his bedroom
window - it is his means of escape. And his mother never says a word and seems
to live a life of sadness reflected in her endless stares. </P>
<P>By comparison, the Burnhams are living a life with more zest. Lester is drawn
to his daughter's sexy friend and has a regressive awakening. He quits his job,
starts lifting weights and jogging, and frequently postures and rants about his
newfangled freedom. Lester also starts smoking pot, listens to his collection
of 70's songs, and tells his family what he really thinks about his life and
his marriage. In other words, he is driving them further apart than they were
already.</P>
<P>There are many more revelations in the richly designed tapestry of writer Alan
Ball's screenplay, and it is unfair to say more because nothing in this film
can be predicted. I have been saying for a long time that Hollywood films
should take the initiative of relying on character-based narrative to unveil a
slice of Americana. Most recent Hollywood films rely on plot to drive the
characters forward in motion (see "Pushing Tin")  whereas Ball instead lets
these characters live and breathe by their passions and hungers - they are not
dictated by cumbersome plot points. Essentially, these people are not at all
what they seem to be, and slowly other attributes start to evolve in their
personalities. </P>
<P>Lester undergoes the most thrilling transformation from a jerky, ironic
three-piece suit bureaucrat to a t-shirt wearing, posturing, reborn, virile man
with lots of attitude to spare, more so than his cheerleading daughter. He is
the anchor of the film, and basically underscores all the tension within his
family and his next-door neighbors with his rampant, rebellious slant on life. </P>
<P>"American Beauty" scores heavily with Spacey's beautifully modulated, magnetic
performance - it is clearly his best work by far. Annette Bening finally has
her zestiest, most radiant role since "The Grifters" - here she accomplishes
the rare feat of being sympathetic while simultaneously being pathetic and
annoying. Thora Birch also does solid work as the cranky Jane (she certainly
grew up since her work in those Harrison Ford/Tom Clancy movies). </P>
<P>One performance that deserves some recognition is the underrated Chris Cooper
as the violently abusive Marine. Cooper also played a dad earlier this year in
the gentle "October Sky" and has had decent parts in some John Sayles films.
Here he demonstrates an intensity that is nearly unwatchable, and his
rain-drenched scene with Spacey will make you squirm. </P>
<P>More kudos are deserving of Mena Suvari as the blonde cheerleader friend of
Jane's - her role says more about the plight of teenage girls in high school
than most teen movies of late. She could give Rachel Leigh Cook a run for her
money.</P>
<P>As much as I like newcomer Wes Bentley, his enigmatic Ricky left me
unsatisfied, partly because we know so little about him. One critic described
him as evil (which he is not) but there is a disarming, almost Norman Bates
aura about this kid that is creepily inconclusive. Ditto Ricky's mother who is
left in the sidelines, though I imagine we can draw our own conclusions as to
why she is virtually catatonic.</P>
<P>"American Beauty" is not perfect or as harrowingly honest as last year's
undeniably great "Happiness," but it is entertainingly wicked, insightful and
satirical in its unfolding of this slice of suburban life. Once it is over, you
will get an urge to drive through the suburbs of any town in America and try to
take a  peek at what is happening in those family homes.  </P>
