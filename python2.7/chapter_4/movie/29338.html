<PRE>A MATTER OF TASTE
A film review by Julia Levin
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>A string of movies emerging from France, including With A Friend Like
Harry, The School of Flesh, and The Taste of Others, represent the "new"
type of French films that American distributors are looking for. 
Partially dark comedies, partially thrillers, they get packaged as
contemporary French noir.  They are also notorious for taking no risks
and being barely skin deep with plot and character.</P>
<P>In A Matter of Taste, Frédéric Delamont (Bernard Giraudeau), an
industrial tycoon apparently at a peak of his success, is obsessed with
two things: food and himself.  At a fancy restaurant, he meets a
temporary waiter named Nicolas, an irreverent young man with the hands
of a pianist and a charming, arrogant smile.  To feed his
self-indulgence, Frédéric hires Nicolas as a personal food taster.  As
we soon discover, he is plotting to get the waiter obsessed with the
same culinary tastes Frédéric has, and, more importantly, to essentially
make Nicolas a living replica of himself.  Nicolas, played by
Jean-Pierre Lorit, best known for his role as a young law student in
Krzysztof Kieslowski's incredible Red, gives his character a touch of
unruly enigma, but that is as far as he can go with the role.</P>
<P>Nicolas finds his new boss an exotic fellow: The businessman is obsessed
with food and is phobic about everything he can't control.  He leads an
empty life, spending most of his time eating lush, exquisitely prepared
culinary masterpieces and lamenting about his childhood -- perhaps real,
but mostly likely invented -- but boring either way.</P>
<P>A Matter of Taste is about obsession and the many different forms it can
take.  However, in this film, the obsessed are far less interesting than
their obsessions.  One of the problems is that the magic chemistry that
is supposed to draw the two men together and change them is painfully
absent.  Frederic and Nicolas don't have much to say to one another, and
aside from their spare, monosyllabic dialogue, the film is full of
homoerotic undertones and creepy suggestions that keep you only mildly
interested in whether something will ever happen between the two.</P>
<P>The doppelganger motif doesn't work here --simply put, the story never
creates the necessary level of suspense or substance.  In addition, they
are ill-chosen players for the thriller genre: Frédéric exhibits no more
energy than the dead fish he is allergic to, and, as the story
progresses, Nicolas's growing dependency syndrome becomes irksome (aside
from being laughably predictable).</P>
<P>It's impossible to call this film seductive or dangerous, or even
sensuous, with the exception of the food tasting scenes.  The thematic
components of the film -- the manipulator vs. the manipulated, rich vs.
poor, victim vs. victimizer -- never develop into anything even remotely
sociologically coherent.  From the beginning, we know what has happened
and who has done it, we are just not sure why.  Is there a symbolic
relationship that unites these two men?  Platonic love?  Sex?  Money? 
Unfortunately, the answer doesn't matter when the characters are as
vacuous as problems they represent.</P>
