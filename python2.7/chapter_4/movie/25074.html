<P>Review by Lars Lindahl (<A HREF="mailto:larsattacks@mail.com">larsattacks@mail.com</A>)</P>
<P>"The Minus Man" (1999) ** (out of four)</P>
<P>Written and Directed by Hampton Fancher</P>
<P>Starring Owen Wilson, Janeane Garofalo, Mercedes
Ruehl, Brian Cox, Dwight Yoakam, Dennis Haysbert, Eric
Mabius, Larry Miller, Brent Briscoe, and Sheryl Crow.</P>
<P>I remember first seeing the preview to this low budget
serial killer indie with a sold out crowd in front 
of The Blair Witch Project. The trailer was strikingly
original compared to most plot-revealing
advertisements today. There were no clips from the
film, just a young couple intimately discussing what
they had just seen at the theater. In fact, their
discussion was so intimate that the young lady
involved forgot about her life guarding
responsibilities at a local pool.  Arriving late to
her job, she finds two huge cadavers floating in the
pool. The laughter, following this bizarre moment,
roared throughout the theater. After this disturbing
event, words flew across the screen, accompanied by a
Danny Elfman-esque score, first declaring that you
will talk about this movie for a long, long time, then
listing a cast of familiar names including Janeane
Garafolo, Merecedes Ruehl, and rock star Sheryl Crow.
>From this experience, I told myself I had to see this
movie and I'm sure everyone else around me did the
same but for one reason or another no one did,
including myself.</P>
<P>I finally got a chance to catch this one on video a
couple of days ago and, sadly, it was not worth the 
wait. I think I understand why there wasn't a scene
from the movie in the preview – there is not one 
interesting or stand out moment in the whole film, not
one surprising turn in the plot, not one particularly
noteworthy acting performance, not one musically
charged instant. Not one of anything really, except a
lot of torturously slow paced dialogue.  From
beginning to end, everything remains consistently
low-key.Writer/director Hampton Fancher tells an
original story but he does nothing else. My only
reaction when The Minus Man ended was `So? Is that
it?' Fancher spends so many pointless scenes doing
nothing that, as time goes by, the movie begins to
drag and drag. The movie is way longer than it has to
be and still there is little to get out of it once it
is over. For a film that guarantees to be a
conversation starter, the only thing my viewing
partner and I had to talk about were the numerous plot
holes left annoyingly (and ntentionally?) unfilled.</P>
<P>The film starts with a questionable casting choice.
Thankfully Sheryl Crow is only in Minus Man for a 
couple of minutes because her acting skills are very
limited. She plays an innocent victim to a serial
killer by the name of Vann Siegert. Played
ndifferently by Owen Wilson, Vann is the last man
you'd expect to be a murderer. He has deceivingly
sunny blonde hair, he's sober, and he's a text book
example of a polite do-gooder. So when he rents out a
room in the house of the emotionally troubled husband
and wife Jane and Doug (Mercedes Ruehl and Brian Cox),
he is quickly taken in as the child the aging couple
wished they had. Vann immediately after arriving at
this ghost town ironically takes on the stereotypical
job of a post office worker, meets a girl (the
unpredictably banal Janeane Garofalo), and whenever he
feels like it, poisons a resident of the town.</P>
<P>Very similar to American Psycho, except without all of
the gory murder scenes, The Minus Man is full of
superfluous voiceovers by Vann. Sometimes interesting
but mostly irrelevant, these glimpses at a serial
killer's mind never tell us why he does what he does.
Fancher occasionally hints that mentally unstable Vann
feels a certain amount of power when he kills, but
unfortunately nothing is for sure.</P>
<P>Some of the scenes in which the viewer enters the
chaotic imagination of Vann are wonderfully eerie. 
Our narrator has dreams about two police detectives
(Dennis Haysbert and Dwight Yoakam) interrogating him
with cruel language and violence. But, like most of
the movie, nothing ultimately comes out of this part
of the story.</P>
<P>The Minus Man is not as depressing or disturbing as
claims it is. I wanted to like this movie and its 
actors but no matter how hard I tried, I could not.
Kudos to Artisan Entertainment. This is an example of
clever advertising attracting me to something I should
have avoided.</P>
