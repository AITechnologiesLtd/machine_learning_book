<PRE>                             UNHOOK THE STARS
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     "Right here in this life, you get reincarnated," says Mildred.
"You change."  Mildred is a middle-aged widow and mom whose children
are grown.  Although she is not yet a grandmother, she looks like one,
albeit an extremely attractive one.</P>
<P>     Mildred is played with earnest realism by Gena Rowlands.  Rowlands
rejects the typical sentimental characterization for roles of this type
and instead imbues Mildred with a documentary style
straightforwardness.  Mildred plays the sort of tireless and loving
mother that everybody wants.</P>
<P>     Mildred is the center of director Nick Cassavetes's film UNHOOK
THE STARS.  Nick is the son of director John Cassavetes and actress
Gina Rowlands.  As much as I admired UNHOOK THE STARS, I kept thinking
the film was John Cassavetes-lite.  This is not meant as an insult.
John's actors played characters with their emotions on the edge whereas
Nick's characters have theirs more in check.  Both, however, have
characters that are so real you will swear they are not acting.</P>
<P>     As the show opens, the last of Mildred's two kids is about to
leave home.  Mildred has been throwing the morning paper route for Ann
Mary Margaret (Moira Kelly from CHANGING HABITS) because Annie has
trouble getting up.  When Annie tells her mom that she is an adult now,
Mildred doesn't buy it.  "You're not an adult," she says.  "An adult is
someone who works and takes care of themselves."  Soon after this,
Annie packs her bag and is almost never seen in the film again.</P>
<P>     Across the street from Mildred is a young family she has never
met.  Marisa Tomei (MY COUSIN VINNY, UNTAMED HEART and ONLY YOU) plays
the high-strung and irresponsible young mother named Monica.  Tomei's
performance is out of character for her, but excellent.  The audience
gets angry with Monica while being charmed by her at the same time.</P>
<P>     Monica's son J.J. (Jake Lloyd from JINGLE ALL THE WAY) is about to
turn seven.  He is a serious kid who almost never speaks.  Less
believable is his behavior, which is perfect.  Given his hard drinking
mother and his equally irresponsible father, Frankie (David Thornton),
I have trouble believing they could turn out such an angel.</P>
<P>     One day Monica shows up at Mildred's doorstep to introduce
herself.  She then announces that she has to go to work, and since she
has no one to take care of J.J., could Mildred keep him all day.
Rather than viewing this as an imposition, Mildred looks upon this as a
great opportunity.  When Monica asks her to do this on a regular basis,
Mildred agrees to do it for free.  Mildred likes having someone to take
care of again.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the most touching scenes of the show are the ones of
Mildred teaching J.J. by reading to him from the encyclopedia. She
starts with the letter A and goes on from there.  She recasts every
entry in terms that J.J. can comprehend.  One of the few failings of
the script by Helen Caldwell and Nick Cassavetes is that they do not
have a proper grasp of what is possible for a seven-year-old boy.  I
have one, and I know.  Mildred's lessons are too often couched in
language for a ten-year-old.  Similarly, there is no way that anyone
would let a seven-year-old leave by himself in the morning to go throw
a paper route as Mildred and Monica let J.J. do.  A ten-year-old could
do this perhaps, but not a seven.  Still these are the only two such
problems with the story.</P>
<P>     At Thanksgiving, Mildred's son Ethan (David Sherrill) comes home
with his new wife.  Mildred's explanation of the holiday to J.J. is
dead-on.  She says, "That's what Thanksgiving is all about -- meeting
friends and eating a lot."  Ethan's wife looks like a cross between a
Radcliffe graduate and a fashion model.  The stares between her and her
polar opposite, Monica, are hilarious.  Monica is always foul mouthed,
which Mildred ignores.  As they are enjoying Thanksgiving, Monica
cusses out her would-be date on the telephone.  Ethan's wife is
scandalized.</P>
<P>     One of the best subplots starts when Monica gets a baby sitter for
J.J. so that she and Mildred can go to a bar together.  There they meet
Big Tommy (Gerard Depardieu) and a couple of other friends of Monica's.
For the first time Mildred is able to indulge herself.  She is used to
devoting all of her energies to caring for others.  At the bar, she is
able to spend time in adult conversations for her own benefit.
Although she dresses nicely and takes good care of herself physically,
she has long since given up on a love life.  She shocks herself by
becoming attracted to Big Tommy.  From the time they leave the bar, the
scene is a beautiful blend of subtle and touching humor.  As throughout
the film, it all rings true.</P>
<P>     A picture with few surprises manages to have some towards the end.
Even so, it is more a character study and a (second) coming of age film
than one with a strong narrative drive.  Mildred has awakened and likes
what she sees.  Her second life may have even more promise than her
first.</P>
<P>     UNHOOK THE STARS runs 1:43.  It is rated R for strong language.
The film would be fine for any teenager.  I recommend it to you and
give it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
