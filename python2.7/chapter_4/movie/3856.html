<PRE>                                   CRUMB
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     When the HOOP DREAMS scandal was going on earlier this year, there
was a second documentary commonly mentioned as having been likewise
robbed alongside the basketball film.  That movie was CRUMB, the
equally ambitious and deserving portrait of the infamous
artist/cartoonist Robert Crumb.</P>
<P>     Crumb was the creator of such works as the drawing, "Keep on
Truckin'," which became an icon adorning every truck mud flap in the
1960's, the cover art for Big Brother and the Holding Company's album
"Cheap Thrills," and the character Fritz the Cat, which had the dubious
distinction of starring in the first X-rated feature animated film.</P>
<P>     One of the first things we find out about the artist:  he
basically hates all of these works, for one reason or another.  In
fact, there's not a lot that Crumb likes at all about his career to
date.  He basically shuns the underground comic movement that he
started.  He refuses almost all commercial propositions.  He despises
modern society and, seemingly, humanity as well.</P>
<P>     This new film by Terry Zwigoff is an eye-popping shocker, delving
unflinchingly into questions of Crumb's hatred of females, questions of
racism, his traumatic childhood, and his extremely twisted family.
Crumb makes no apologies.  Like most documentaries, there's no cohesive
plotline here, only slow and inexorable revelations about the artist's
life, filmed over a six-year period.  Despite the meandering story
line, the film is quite engrossing, not so much due to the extensive
parade of Crumb's work that is displayed, but more to the cast of
characters inhabiting this strange, strange world.</P>
<P>     Crumb's family are the most enthralling of these characters,
especially his two brothers.  Their stories of growing up as outcasts,
their abusive father, their amphetamine-abusing mother, and the birth
of their respective "careers" in art are nothing short of fantastic.
The film starts to drag during some of the comic book readings and
during interviews with other characters who aren't quite as
enthralling, but overall the film is extremely worthwhile.</P>
<P>     The ultimate impression that stays with me is not just that Robert
Crumb is an extremely odd fellow, but more that he's a real person that
I doubt anyone will ever truly understand.</P>
