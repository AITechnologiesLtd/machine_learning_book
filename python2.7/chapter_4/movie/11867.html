<PRE>Mr. Nice Guy (1998)
* * *
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Jackie Chan teams up with his old buddy Sammo Hung to give us
another zero-calorie fight-fest. Gloriously foolish fun.</P>
<P>My wife had this to say about MR. NICE GUY: "As entertainment, it's great.
As a movie, it sucks." I was forced to agree: the plot was an afterthought,
the acting was hopeless, the script a throwaway. But it showcased Jackie
Chan's raucous physical comedy -- "martial arts" is the wrong word for it --
and was therefore more than worth it. It isn't the all-out roar of joy that
RUMBLE IN THE BRONX and especially SUPERCOP were, but it's still great fun.
Most movies that feature martial-arts action are about the giving and
receiving of violent pain. Jackie has a slightly goofier agenda, and is all
the better for it -- even if he's in a paper-thin story.</P>
<P>The plot (what a word!): Jackie is a TV chef living in Australia who
specializes in on-screen acrobatics with his food. One day he collides with
a journalist who's just filmed a drug deal that ended in violence, and
there's a mix-up of tapes. This of course puts him right in the path of an
endless stream of punks, henchmen, cigar-smoking baddies, and cops. That's
about it-- but ther are a host of tiny little departures, like his
girlfriend (Miki Lee) and his female assistant, who have a howlingly funny
scene that, due to language barriers, cannot be repeated here. Some things
you gotta see to believe.</P>
<P>Jackie's stuntwork needs a new vocabulary to describe it: it's like play, or
maybe a kind of dance. One scene has Jackie getting into a fight in
traffic -- on top of a flood of Pepsi cans. Another scene involves an
unfinished building and a whole maze of doors opening into empty rooms and
corridors. Hung (who directed) plays it like an homage to the Road Runner
and Wile E. Coyote cartoons. (Hung also films things a little more loosely
and fluidly than Staney Tong did: we get a lot of Steadicam work, lots of
things going on in different sectors of the screen.) Another, even more
mind-boggling scene, involves Jackie being forced to fight with henchmen
holding his limbs back with bungee cords. (Yes, he manages to get the upper
hand with that one as well. Don't ask how.)</P>
<P>The final scene gives us the Grand Guignol (sans blood) ending that a movie
like this deserves. Here's a hint: in the first five minutes, we see a giant
earth-moving vehicle used to bury someone. Seeing a thing like that in a
movie like this is (to quote Roger Ebert) like Camille coughing in the first
reel and not dying in the last: it *has* to make an encore. I was right.
Only this time, Jackie was driving.</P>
