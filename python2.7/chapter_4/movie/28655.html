<P>   People who are against affirmative action and quotas--generally,
but not exclusively, those of a conservative bent-- like to say that
so many people are considered minorities that those who are
covered by this legal umbrella make up 80% of the population.  I
suppose their case can be strengthened when liberals say that
blonde women are an oppressed group also, i.e. that so many
employers and others in authority consider flaxen-haired women
to be bimbos that they will refuse to hire them or admit them to
the better schools.  Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) opens
Robert Luketic's movie, "Legally Blonde," as a perfect fit for this
stereotype.  Her hair is canary-yellow, she dresses in bright, pastel
colors (mimicked by the pink pigments in the opening credits),
she attends a secondary school majoring in fashion rather than
one that affords rigorous academic preparation.  Her parents, who
think little of law as a profession, discourage her from thoughts of
pursuing that field, but then again Elle suggests the possibilities
of her attending embarking on legal training only because her
steady boy friend Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis) breaks
up with her because he considers her too frivolous: he intends to
become a U.S. senator by age 30 and needs a sharp, intelligent
woman on his arm to improve his quest for political fame.</P>
<P>   Robert Luketic, who directs "Legally Blonde" from a script by
Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, is firmly within "Clueless"
territory, with the wonderful Reese Witherspoon in the role taken
by Alicia Silverstone in Amy Heckerling's 1995 comedy about 
Beverly Hills high school teens of the 1990's.   Just as
Silverstone's character is named Cher after the celebrated
actress, Witherspoon has been christened Elle after the women's
fashion magazine, while the film emulates "Clueless" in being
satirical, charming, and never mean.   This in itself is a triumph in
a movie opening a week or so after the abominably vulgar and
unfunny "Scary Movie 2," and if Luketic's picture brings in the kind
of box office that it anticipates, Witherspoon in the role of a
budding lawyer would supply evidence that a light comedy these
days need not be patently offensive to succeed.</P>
<P>    Though "Legally Blonde" is nothing if not predictable, the film
sustains a lighter-than-air mood, filled with both amiable sitcomish
jokes and an altogether screwball ambiance.  Opening inside the
Delta Nu sorority house where Elle is eagerly anticipating a
proposal from the rich boy friend she loves, the picture quickly
presents a female scorned, as the usually spirited blonde drips
mascara after being jilted by her beau.  Determined to become
"good enough" for the man who considers her just plain not
smart, she succeeds in cracking the Law Aps, gets into Harvard,
and after standing out from the crowd, a pretty-in-pink student
amid a chorus of earnest and competitive scholars, she becomes
reflective for the first time in her life as she turns from cracking up
her classmates to cracking the law books with earnest.  Selected
as an intern to her professor (Victor Garber)--for the wrong
reasons as we soon find out--Elle winds up defending a woman
accused of murdering her wealthy husband by using the very
knowledge she had acquired back in her days at the fashion
institute.</P>
<P>   "Legally Blonde" would not have succeeded as it does without
Reese Witherspoon in the lead, in virtually every scene, standing
in as a role model who effectively uses her less-than-accredited
training to turn the tables on her more conventional colleagues
and on one randy instructor.  Harvard Law School obtains a
product placement that it scarcely needs given the ratio of
applications to acceptances, while the film's production team
garners laurels partly for its exhibition of feminist empowerment,
partly for cleansing the bad taste that preceded its opening in the
form of Keenen Ivory Wayans' exploration of a new low in
adolescent cinema.</P>
