<PRE>IN SHORT: Think statues.</PRE>
<P>What do you get when you team a first time screen director (a couple of
Broadway hits under his belt) and a first time big screen writer (a
couple of TV sitcoms)? Usually Cranky gets a massive headache. But
sometimes . . .</P>
<P>I've said it a couple of times before on these pages or in the
occasional radio or TV appearance: Great Films always begin as great
movies. Great Movies must make you laugh or cry; touch you or move you
emotionally; offer characters and/or situations that make some
connection to something deep inside. If a movie accomplishes one or two
of those things, it's probably worth the ticket price. If it does more,
we critics shout to the moon hoping that you readers will pay attention.</P>
<P>American Beauty is the second movie to tackle mid-life crises as the
center of its story. Unlike Election, there is no confusing this flick
with something aimed at, and starring teens, though there is a
substantial subplot dealing with those kidlets. Thus, you can approach
this flick from two angles, which is a mark of expert writing. I'm going
to start with the old folks, 'cuz that's what I am.</P>
<P>American Beauty is the story of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), who faces
imminent unemployment after 14 years writing for an advertising industry
trade mag. Living in a contented yet loveless marriage to his real
estate tycoon (at least, in her mind) wife Carolyn (Annette Bening),
Lester is facing mighty hard times. Communication problems plague his
once vital relationship with his now distant teenage daughter Jane
(Thora Birch). Lester wonders about, in a narrative track that
accompanies the flick, where it all started to go bad. Then, a glimpse
of Jane's friend, and almost superstar model slut pal Angela Hayes (Mena
Suvari) in her cheerleader outfit, gives Les the spark he needs. Out
come the weights and the sweatsuit, 'cuz the old man wants to get buff
for the American beauty he fantasizes about.</P>
<P>Yeah, the idea of a 42 year old man fantasizing about a 17 year old girl
is pretty disgusting. Cranky saw it happen to at least one father of one
of his friends and the result was the same: an instant reversion to
teenhood. Spacey's Lester is almost giddy with anticipation and his
complete reversal of character is missing only the zits. Angela, it
should be pointed out, does not discourage the attention and there's a
helluva lot more to this particular plot thread that you'll have to find
out for yourself. Carolyn, on the other hand, is ready to kiss up to the
competition. He's Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher), the self-proclaimed
"King of Real Estate" and there's a helluva lot more etc etc etc.</P>
<P>The question of "why aren't things the way they used to be" lingers in
the neighborhood as well. The neighbors to the left are Jim (Scott
Bakula) and his partner Jim (Sam Robards). The neighbors to the right
are retired Marine Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper), his almost catatonic
mom (Allison Janney) and their teenage son, Ricky (Wes Bentley), who has
been stalking Jane and videotaping her every move. This brings
alternative lifestyles, homophobia, Semper Fi stereotypes and some pot
humor into the story.</P>
<P>For the teens out there, the stories of Jane, Angela and Ricky should
provide plenty of diversion. Like most teens, their parents are
embarrassments. Jane wishes her dad were dead. Ricky volunteers to do
the job. But American Beauty ain't no murder mystery. It's a black
comedy whose humor is razor sharp, whose story is so well written that,
even up to the very end, you will sit in your seat working the
permutations on how the inevitable will happen. That's not spilling any
secret -- Spacey's narrative informs you within 15 seconds of the start
of American Beauty that his character will be dead by the end of it.
Whether the cause is natural or unnatural, Cranky won't say.</P>
<P>Writer Alan Ball has done a great job and given the actors all they need
to create great, and living, characters. Sam Mendes, best known for his
direction of the current Broadway version of Cabaret leads you on a
journey from fun to reality that is seamless and sobering.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to American Beauty, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$7.75</PRE>
<P>Highly recommended. Oscar list level. Cranky didn't expect to have to
start thinking about those damned end of year lists for at least another
month but . . .</P>
