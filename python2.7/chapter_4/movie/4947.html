<P>     Though you think we'd be tired of the drag gags after TO WONG FOO,
WIGSTOCK, and PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT, this respectable remake of
LA CAGE AUX FOLLES (1978) successfully reminds us that there are few
sights funnier than that of a man dressed as a woman.  Here, the "woman"
is Albert (Nathan Lane), a star drag queen in South Beach, FL, and the
shrill half of a happy gay couple.  Her longtime companion is Armand
(Robin Williams), the straighter man in the relationship and the owner
of the all-ages club where Albert performs.  Together, they must
scramble to reinvent themselves for the impending arrival of Armand's
son's fiance's right-wing parents (Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest).</P>
<P>     Despite the inclusion of several awkward, though timely, political
statements-- Hackman's character is both a Republican Senator (!) and
the founder of the Coalition for Moral Order (!!)-- THE BIRDCAGE is a
surprisingly wholesome comedy that preaches nothing more than the
virtues of acceptance.  The super-swishy caricatures are probably passe,
sure, but director Mike Nichols and writer Elaine May bring a sincerity
to the characters that overrides any outdating.  Of course, by the end,
any and all messages are moot as the ensemble gets down to brass tacks.</P>
<P>     THE BIRDCAGE is first and foremost a farce, which means that every-
thing-- plot, character, etc.-- is secondary to set-up.  The entire
movie is spent in preparation for what befalls Armand and Albert when
the In-Laws-to-be arrive.  (Though the biggest laughs come at the end,
there are many funny bits peppered throughout.  Such as a hilarious
sequence of Williams trying to teach Lane how to "act like a guy.")
Though not without problems-- the poor definition of Hackman's character
is a big one-- THE BIRDCAGE delivers a minor message and some major
laughs, and, in a movie season as dry as this one, that's hardly a drag.</P>
<PRE>     Grade: B</PRE>
