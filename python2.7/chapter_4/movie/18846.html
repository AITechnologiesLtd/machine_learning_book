<PRE>FORCES OF NATURE
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR></PRE>
<P>Rating: **1/2 (out of ****)
DreamWorks SKG / 1:42 / 1999 / PG-13 (language, thematic material)

Danner; Ronny Cox; Meredith Scott Lynn; David Strickland
Director: Bronwen Hughes
Screenplay: Marc Lawrence; Ian Bryce; Donna Roth<HR></P>
<P>Sandra Bullock's girl-next-door sunniness is appealing in the same way
that Ben Affleck's swarthy-but-affable ease is appealing, so it's
reasonable to presume that a movie featuring their respective appeals
will be, um, appealing as well. "Forces of Nature," one such romantic
comedy, lives up to that precursor despite saddling these actors with
roles that might seem to contradict their proven likability: She's a
wild child with hefty emotional baggage while he's a harried,
straightforward bundle of nerves. The casting goes completely against
type, but Bullock and Affleck's stars shine brightly even when the film
gets dangerously dim - which is also, unfortunately, how it ends up.</P>
<P>The story is basically composed of a string of natural and man-made
disasters that lead this nice-looking but evidently mismatched pair to
profess their mutual affection for each other. So far, so fun, as this
much of Forces delivers largely entertaining fluff. What happens in the
dire aftermath, however, is best described as forced. It's not fair for
a movie to be amusing within the confines of several standard cinematic
conventions - the Meet Cute, the Opposites Attract and the Road Movie
among them - and then bungle the moment of truth and subsequent climax
and finale. They suck the mirth right out of the air and might leave a
bad taste in your mouth.</P>
<P>Thank goodness for Bullock and Affleck, then, who click even in the most
contrived of circumstances. They first share screen time on a New
York-to-Georgia flight that, due to a nasty accident involving a seagull
and a wing engine, never gets off the ground. Affleck's Ben (no stretch
there) already has the jitters because he's en route to his opulent
wedding in Savannah, and said mishap doesn't exactly set his mind at
ease - especially after grandpa keeled over at the bachelor party only
to confide on his hospital bed that marriage is nothing but constricting
chaos.</P>
<P>Despite these two seemingly isolated incidents of ill will, Ben hooks up
with Bullock's fellow passenger and free spirit Sarah (what, they didn't
want to call her Sandra?) for alternate travel strategies - she's headed
his way, so he figures he'll share the joys of outrageous fortune. But
one bit of bad luck turns into another, and soon, Ben and Sarah have
gotten arrested, robbed and quite wet from the torrential downpour of
rain and hail that follows them almost about everywhere - shot as
beautiful visual compositions by "Out of Sight" cinematographer Elliot
Davis - and these are merely a few of the crises they endure while
trying to go south.</P>
<P>Such lively misadventures, which comprise a bulk of "Forces of Nature,"
take a cue from "Planes, Trains & Automobiles" in their growing
absurdity and vehicular setting - aside from the aforementioned airliner
tragedy, Ben and Sarah inadvertently run into railroad trouble and hitch
a ride from a friendly hophead, though not in that order. Meanwhile,
"Forces of Nature" cuts back and forth between their plight and Ben's
bride, waiting by the phone and expecting the worst. This fairly
thankless part is filled by Maura Tierney, who was also given the
thankless part of Jim Carrey's wife in "Liar Liar," and she's further
hampered by an equally thankless subplot in which a successful ex tempts
her.</P>
<P>Of course, that flummox would be forgivable had Affleck and Tierney's
guaranteed nuptial-day reunion and its aftermath rang true, but for
once, an unpredictable, anti-Hollywood send-off flops. A powerful
hurricane hits the area just in time for this conclusion, and tosses the
colorful decor about in its mighty winds like rainbow confetti. It's a
pretty sight, but it makes one wonder if anybody in front of the camera
pays attention to the Weather Channel, or if anybody behind it couldn't
think of a better way to cap off an otherwise enjoyable movie.<HR></P>

"Remember that old college boy joke about how, after sex, the ideal
women turns into a pizza and a six-pack? In this movie, the ideal man
turns into a vibrator and Ted Koppel." -Roger Ebert on "Let's Talk About
