                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        This movie ain't stale for a second, it's completely... oh, 
what's the word... fresh. That also happens to be the nickname of the 
main character, a 12-year-old drug dealer who is the most intelligent 
and resourceful juvenile delinquent I've ever seen. He manages to keep 
his occupation a secret from his family, which consists of at least ten 
brothers and sisters, the aunt who looks after them all, the drunk 
father who uses chess as a metaphor for life and the older sister who is 
hooked on the very item Fresh sells and is also hooked up with Fresh's 
boss, Esteban.</P>
<P>        Tragedy strikes early on in the film, as a school girl Fresh has 
a crush on is caught in the line of fire (wasn't that a Clint Eastwood 
movie?) from a fellow drug runner's gun. Everyone else flees the 
scene, but Fresh stays until the police arrive, insisting of course that he 
saw nothing. The same thing happens later on in the film as Fresh's 
loudmouth friend-turned-drug runner is mowed down. The police 
realize it may not be a coincidence that this kid was found at the scene 
of two murders in two days. You or I may never make that connection, 
but then we never took months of courses in advanced detective 
techniques taught at the police academy (and watching those movies 
doesn't count either).</P>
<P>        FRESH isn't a fast-moving action film or a murder mystery. 
It's more of a case study into the life of an incredible young man who 
rises above the scum he associates with and the work he does. He also 
has the enviable ability to convincingly lie through his teeth to get 
what he wants. Enviable to me, of course, because lying has never 
been something I could even begin to try without bursting into 
maniacal laughter, even the most minor lies. That's why I was never 
called upon as a character witness for the Clarence Thomas 
confirmation hearings. I could never say "Even a fool knows pubic 
hair is part of the delicious Classic Coke formula" with a straight face. 
But this kid could. He lies to the cops twice, convincing them he's just 
a stupid kid. And those scenes don't even compare to the movie's end, 
in which Fresh commits several convincing doublecrosses on his boss 
and associates.</P>
<P>        As far as inner-city drug dramas go, this one ranks with the 
best of them, taking the high road to make its characters human, 
giving them a reason to commit the human atrocities they do (unlike, 
say, Clarence Thomas). It's also not as violent as the usual crop of 
drug dramas. The seemingly gratuitous violence toward the end is 
essential to the story. And FRESH contains some stunning 
performances from people you've never heard of, the only recognizable 
actor being Samuel L. Jackson (PULP FICTION), in the part of Fresh's 
chess-playing father, the man who gets medieval with the bishops, 
queens and pawns.</P>
