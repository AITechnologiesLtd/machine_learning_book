<PRE>                                  SERIAL MOM
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1994 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     SERIAL MOM is a film directed and written by John Waters.  The
cast includes Kathleen Turner, Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Traci Lords,
Suzanne Somers, Patricia Hearst, and Mink Stole.  Rated R for violence.
(Also rough language.)</P>
<P>     SERIAL MOM is both a return and a departure for John Waters, the
insightful auteur of bad taste, whose string of midnight classics began
with MULTIPLE MANIACS, reached a climax of a sort in PINK FLAMINGOES,
and continued with FEMALE TROUBLES and DESPERATE LIVING.  Starting with
the 1981 film POLYESTER, famous for its scratch 'n' sniff Odorama cards
if nothing else, Waters moved out of the midnight ghetto; he has since
followed with the musicals HAIRSPRAY and CRY-BABY.  These latter-day
Waters films have their charms, but they lack the over-the-top
grossness and vision of the midnight days.  So to that extent SERIAL
MOM represents something of a return to offensiveness and
truth-telling.  On the other hand, Waters has never had the services of
such a well-known actress as he had in the person of Kathleen Turner.</P>
<P>     Turner has found her metier in SERIAL MOM.  I have the feeling
that lately she has been struggling to find a niche for herself as a
middle-aged woman in an industry that often thinks women are over the
hill and unemployable after 30.  Turner tried the hard-boiled detective
in V. I. WARSHAWSKY and the spy with a child care problem in UNDERCOVER
BLUES, but basically she hasn't had a hit since 1989's WAR OF THE
ROSES.  Of course, we always knew she was a talented comedienne;
ROMANCING THE STONE established that.  And as the title character in
SERIAL MOM she is perfect, unfailingly funny, and as deadly a wielder
of black comedy as she is of pokers and legs of lamb.  She is the last
word in the out of control, self-controlled control freak who insists
that everyone play by her rules.  She never loses her cool or her
confidence.  She knows with an unshakeable surety that one does not
wear white shoes after Labor Day and that the seat belt law must be
obeyed.  She lives in the perfect world of the upper middle class
suburb; she oversees the perfect family.  Nothing must be tolerated to
threaten that perfection.  She makes no effort to cover her crimes and
she gets away with them.  After all, she is right.  Anyone who refuses
to rewind her rental tapes deserves to die; anyone ought to be able to
see that.  Turner never breaks character, never once retreats from the
smug savagery and the complacent campiness of her role.  In the hands
of a lesser actor, the part could have been career suicide.  For
Kathleen Turner, it is likely to be a career revivifier.</P>
<P>     As for Waters, nobody does it better, and it is a genuine pleasure
to have him back behind the camera producing a mainstream version of
his 70s masterpieces.  Waters is a film maker of extraordinary vision
and clarity.  He *sees* America in a way very few do; he makes us laugh
at its viciousness, it violence, its hypocrisy; what else can we do?
And he translates his black vision into films no one else could make,
despite his many imitators who content to go for the gag but not the
content.</P>
<P>     And he continues to give us the pleasure of his company of unique
actors.  We cannot have Divine any longer, but there are still Ricki
Lake, Traci Lords, Mink Stole, and a further collection of wonderful
faces and bodies that have nothing to do with Hollywood.  In this
regard (and others), Waters is America's equivalent of that other
great, gay film maker and visionary Pedro Almodovar, and for me that is
high praise indeed.</P>
<P>     I recommend SERIAL MOM most highly.  Pay what you must; it will be
worth it.</P>
