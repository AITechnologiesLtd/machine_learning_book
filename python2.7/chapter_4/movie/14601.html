<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>When I was sixteen, I was driving a bunch of my friends around town,
and it was way past my curfew.  We were having a great time until I got
pulled over by someone tailing me closely with his brights on. 
Stupidly, I stopped, and I saw someone get out of the car behind me. 
Suddenly, there was a large gentleman standing next to my open window. 
He asked, "You guys like skinheads?" and proceeded to punch me in the
face, breaking my nose.  He started pulling my friends out of the car,
and I thought we were going to die.  It is perhaps the most frightening
thing I've ever endured.</P>
<P>And yet, this situation is much funnier than A Night at the Roxbury,
which is a pathetic and limp excuse for a comedy.  I'd rather get
punched in the face by skinheads than ever sit through this film again,
because, on top of being boring (there is *one* joke in this movie),
it's really quite a pitiful experience.  "Saturday Night Live" has never
been a must-see show for me (I was born long after the original
"classic" episodes with the original "funny" cast), but now I submit
that an SNL skit is a worse choice for a film than a video game (both
groups have their anomalies, which include Wayne's World and Mortal
Kombat).  A Night at the Roxbury is creatively defunct and lacking in
the most crucial arena:  comedy.</P>
<P>I did chuckle in the beginning, however, as director John Fortenberry
introduces us to Steve and Doug Butabi (Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell). 
It's funny for a few seconds that they swing their heads in unison to
music emanating from nowhere.  It's sorta funny to watch them walk down
the street and deliver crude pick-up lines to women who hate them.  It's
mildly amusing to see that they still live at home (in the same room),
and work retail in their father's silk plant shop.  But, you see, an SNL
skit is usually about five minutes -- and that's normally four minutes
too long.  This film is apparently runs 87 minutes, and that means that
86 of those minutes are spent either 1) looking at the Butabi brothers
swing their heads again, 2) listening to Dan Hedaya and Chazz Palminteri
deliver awful lines, or 3) watching a pointless and insipid plot grind
its gears and expire into a pathetic lump of screenwriting cliches.</P>
<P>The plot, should you give a flying rat's ass (I only use that line
because it's put to such good use in the film), centers around our
beloved brothers trying to get into the biggest club in town.  You
guessed it -- it's the Roxbury!  You see, Richard Grieco gets them in
(yes, Richard Grieco is in this movie, drowning in makeup and looking
ultrasupercool).  It turns out that the club's owner (played by an
unbilled Palminteri) really likes the brothers, and wants to use their
ideas with his next club.  In addition, we have a subplot in which the a
social climbing bimbo (Molly Shannon) wants to marry Steve, and so the
brothers have a fight which leads to Doug moving into the guest house of
their father's estate.  </P>
<P>Like I said, the film is funny for about one minute.  After that, you
start to realize the original reason for this concept being a skit:  it
doesn't have depth, or characters, or anything that would make you want
to sit in a theater for 87 minutes.  A Night at the Roxbury serves best
as a reminder that "Saturday Night Live" and its producer, Lorne
Michaels (who is responsible for this film and many others) should stop
wasting their money and ours.  </P>
<P>I don't know how talented Kattan and Ferrell are, but neither is
particularly loathsome here.  I didn't hate watching them, but, as I
said, it just gets boring.  The two men also co-wrote the film, and I
don't entirely blame them -- to stretch this concept from five to 87
minutes must have seemed like an impossible task.  Apparently, it was. 
I doubt they had much choice in the matter, and the fact that they at
least wrung one minute of laughter out of the refuse pile is . . . well,
it's pretty sad.</P>
<P>The rest of the acting is either unfunny or just plain bad.  In
addition to Grieco (does anyone even remember "21 Jump Street?"), we
have a cameo from Loni Anderson, who has no lines.  Then there's Hedaya,
who always acts the same; here, his sameness is intensely annoying. 
Palminteri is one of those actors I just don't like, so his "Did you
grab my ass?" running joke is about as funny as the book of Revelation. 
Molly Shannon seems to have some spunk, but she mostly just comes across
as a nuisance.  Mixed in with all these performances is this God-awful
story, which even takes itself seriously in one scene towards the end
(when the Butabis make up).  </P>
<P>There were a few other people at my screening of A Night at the
Roxbury, and most of them laughed about as frequently as I did (however,
the Token Laugher sat right behind me, which was kind of irritating). 
There are really funny movies out there -- funny movies with depth and
insight.  There are also funny films that don't aspire to anything, but
keep the jokes coming so constantly that you don't really care.  A Night
at the Roxbury attempts no depth, and just isn't funny beyond its
premise.  If anyone ever tells me that they're planning on seeing this
film, I'll suggest that they save themselves the trouble by finding some
skinheads instead.  And I won't be kidding.</P>
