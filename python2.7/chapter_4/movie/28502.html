<PRE>BABY BOY
A film review by Annette Cardwell
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Ten years after releasing the groundbreaking Boyz N the Hood,
writer-director John Singleton revisits his "young black man in the
ghetto struggling against a violent end" cautionary tale, but with more
humor and realism, in his newest film Baby Boy, showing that maybe baby
boy Singleton's done some growing up himself.</P>
<P>In the same South Central Los Angeles neighborhood, real life is about
to crash down on 20-year-old Jody (model/singer/VJ Tyrese Gibson). He
has two children by two different "baby mamas" -- level-headed Yvette
(Taraji Henson) and too-young Peanut (Tamara LaSeon Bass) -- he's
unemployed, and he's still living with his own mama Juanita (A.J.
Johnson).  He's also clashing with his mom's new man, an aging "O.G."
named Melvin (Ving Rhames) who's looking to move in; and, he's got to
keep his volatile roughneck friend Sweetpea (Cuba Jr.'s brother Omar
Gooding) out of trouble, without getting dragged down into more trouble
himself.  And to top things off, he's seeing competition from Yvette's
ex-con ex-boyfriend (the inimitable Snoop Dogg).</P>
<P>While this all-too-familiar story of inner city woe has been done to
death over the last decade, Singleton manages to keep it fresh and
unpredictable by steering the plot in unconventional directions
throughout the movie. He puts unusual yet plausible twists on such
overplayed topics as drive-by shootings and domestic abuse, and still
manages to deliver some powerful messages in the mix.  And unlike the
caricaturized roles in Boyz, he's created very complex characters that
are more believably flawed.  Instead of Laurence Fishburne's ultra-Zen
and all-knowing father, we get Ving Rhames' reformed killer who wants to
teach Jody how to be a man, but has very little patience for his
hardheaded immaturity.  Thankfully, Singleton seems to have gotten a
better sense of humor these last few years (maybe Shaft loosened him
up?) and peppers the movie with a number of hilarious scenes, including
one where Jody walks in on a totally naked Melvin cooking eggs for
breakfast.</P>
<P>It also seems that Singleton has great luck with putting non-actors to
work in his movies.  Just as Ice Cube showed his acting chops as Dough
Boy in Boyz, Snoop really produces with a menacing role, and film
newcomer Tyrese turns out a dramatic and varied starring performance. 
Singleton's women are even more stunning, especially Johnson as the
tough and torn Juanita and Henson, who handles Yvette's roller coaster
emotions with skill.</P>
<P>By refusing to be as dogmatic or overly simplistic as he's been with his
other films, Singleton may have redeemed himself and his talent with
Baby Boy.  Perhaps now we can erase those bad memories of Higher
Learning.</P>
