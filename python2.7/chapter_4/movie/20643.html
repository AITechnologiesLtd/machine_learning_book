Grade: A-</P>
<P>When I saw the trailer for "The Sixth Sense," I didn't expect much from it.  My
snap judgment was that it was a watered-down version of "The Shining" or
possibly a late-entry in the glut of angel-related movies/TV shows of a couple
years ago.  But all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot.  It turned out to
be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis plays child psychologist Malcolm Crowe.  At the beginning of the
movie, he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work, but he is
soon confronted by Vincent, a patient Malcolm failed years earlier (Donnie
Wahlberg-former New Kid-in an impressive cameo).  A year passes, and Malcolm is
treating another child with the same symptoms Vincent displayed.  Cole Sear
(Haley Joel Osment) is a withdrawn kid who is called "Freak" by the other boys
in the neighborhood.  Weird things seem to happen around Cole-his mother
(Olivia Williams) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every
cabinet and drawer open even though Cole hasn't moved-and Cole seems to know
things that a kid his age shouldn't-for example, that there was once a gallows
in his school.  He steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a
pup tent in his bedroom.</P>
<P>The trailer gave away the movie's first major plot twist.  If it hadn't, the
first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn't know
what's wrong with Cole.  If you're lucky enough to have not seen the trailer,
stop reading this review right now and go see "The Sixth Sense."</P>
<P>Anyway, since the trailer gave it away, I figure it's fair game to discuss
here.  Once Malcolm gains Cole's trust, Cole reveals his secret:  he sees
ghosts everywhere.  Dead people wander around not knowing that they're dead,
invisible to everyone except Cole.  Malcolm gradually begins to realize that
Cole is telling the truth.</P>
<P>The box office success of "The Sixth Sense" has generated a lot of press about
how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why
that's so.  I hate to burst anybody's bubble, but "The Sixth Sense" isn't
really a horror film.  At its core, "The Sixth Sense" is a touching story of
how a troubled kid and an emotionally-scarred adult help each other to move
past their problems.  Some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy,
though.  One that really got to me:  the ghost of a boy says to Cole, "I'll
show you where my dad keeps his gun"; when the ghost turns, we see the bullet
wound in the back of his head.</P>
<P>Osment gives the best performance I've ever seen from a child actor.  It's hard
enough to find a grown-up in Hollywood who can give a subtle, realistic
portrayal!  Although Willis gets top billing, Cole is really the protagonist of
the story, and Osment truly brings the complex kid to life.  If only Willis'
work were as impressive.  Accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than
dialogue, Willis is stiff and awkward as Malcolm, his most challenging role to
date.  (This is a bad omen for his next movie, "The Story of Us," which
chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage).</P>
<P>Writer/Director M. Night Shyamalan has a light, poetic touch that goes to the
heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite.  He's also a skillful
storyteller, as the movie's ending demonstrates.  Only when the final secret is
revealed do you realize that Shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the
movie.  Look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats Cole.</P>
<P>Bottom line:  Osment should get an Oscar nomination, and you should go see this
movie.</P>
