<PRE>                              BRASSED OFF
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This film is by turns a comedy, a
          serious drama, and an anti-Tory political tract.
          But Mark Herman who wrote and directed certainly
          knows how to create characters in whom the audience
          can place an emotional investment.  This film about
          a century-old brass band in a dying Yorkshire
          mining town is predictable but has a lot of
          affecting human drama.  Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4) 7
          (0 to 10)
          New York Critics: 5 positive, 4 negative, 4 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Since the 1950s the British have certainly known how to make
modest but affecting films in ways that American filmmakers rarely
attempt.  Some simple comedies from the post-war era gave us eloquent
and loving pictures of British village life still memorable today.
That tradition is strong in BRASSED OFF, but mostly in the first half
of the film.  Director/writer Mark Herman hooks the audience with a
light comic view of the mining village of Grimely, but increasingly the
replaces the comedy with serious drama.  We see the village having its
most difficult times with the pit closings of the Margaret Thatcher
administration.  Finally, with the viewer hooked and caring about the
characters, the film gets in its angry speech about the policy of pit
closings of Thatcher's Tory party.  Not that it is a total surprise
with the opening of the film making some angry remarks about closing
mines to replace with nuclear power plants.</P>
<P>     The heart of the Yorkshire town of Grimely is its colliery.
('Ere.  of Grimely--well, most of it anyway--is the Grimely Colliery
Brass Band.  The band has been around for a hundred years.  But these
are hard times for Grimely.  The company looks like it might close the
colliery and if there really is a pit closing, the whole town might
just as well dry up and blow away.  Already there are those in the band
who are so depressed about what is happening to the town that they are
ready to quit the band.  Band leader Danny (Pete Postlethwaite, the
currently best thing about THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK) cannot
believe that people in the town will let the band die, even if the mine
goes under.  Just as the band is starting to founder, new life is
breathed into it by a new member.  Gloria (the radiant Tara
Fitzgerald), granddaughter of a former great band member, returns to
the town of her birth with her grandfather's flugelhorn.  The first
woman ever in the Grimely Colliery Brass Band plays the flugelhorn as
well as her grandfather did.  Suddenly the band starts looking and
sounding better to the band members.  While the future of the town is
souring, the men are distracted for a few hours a week by music and a
little flirting.  And of course some of the wives are jealous.  But
things grow grimmer in Grimely as the company offers a job buyout.
While some band members are sacrificing food for music, most of the
town is looking at whether they want to mortgage the future of the town
in the buyout or hope the mines are not closed.  Mark Herman has a feel
for the humanity of the people, no doubt based on his youth in
Yorkshire.</P>
<P>     Pete Postlethwaite is one of the British actors who does a great
job and nobody seems to make much of a fuss about.  He had major roles
in films such as IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, or bit parts in films such
as THE USUAL SUSPECTS.  His bicycle-riding band leader in denial about
how serious the town's problems are is entirely different from roles he
has done before.  Tara Fitzgerald is a decent actress, and though I
have not seen her in any really demanding roles, she is certainly a joy
to watch.  Ewan McGregor, like Postlethwaite, is also in two current
films, this and THE PILLOW BOOK.  And with his Scottish name it goes
without saying that he was in TRAINSPOTTING.  Veteran character actor
Jim Carter (THE ADVOCATE, BLACK BEAUTY, and RICHARD III), looking like
a heavy-set Leonard Rossiter, usually can be counted on for a bit a
color.</P>
<P>     Americans will be at a slight disadvantage in seeing BRASSED OFF.
They will be informed at the outset what a colliery is, but the
Yorkshire accent takes a little getting used to.  What very likely were
some funny lines will go past viewers not quick enough to pick up what
is said.  Curiously the anti-Tory sentiments may hit home from
similarities in policy between the Conservative Tories and the
Republican Party.  But the political arguments will lose a little
impact since coal-mining is shown to be a dangerous profession which
shortens lives.  The viewer may decide that it is just as well that the
next generation is saved from going into the pits and instead is forced
to find other work.</P>
<P>     Not surprisingly, the score by Trevor Jones is big and brassy with
some nice brass renditions of popular light classical themes.  The
score is played by the Grimethorpe Colliery Band who also supplied
extras for the story's band.  No doubt Grimely is based in no small
part on Grimethorpe.  This is a film that has more than a few moving
moments and it worth looking for.  There is more to this film than the
trailers would lead one to think.  I rate it a low +2 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
