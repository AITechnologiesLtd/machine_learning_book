<PRE>THE MASK OF ZORRO
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     The young Zorro, played by a perfectly cast Antonio Banderas,
improves on the old game of strip poker.  He and his fetchingly
beautiful costar, Catherine Zeta-Jones as Elena, engage in strip
swordplay in a scene late in the new Zorro movie.  As Zorro wins the
match, Elena grabs a hat to cover herself just fast enough so that the
film can keep its PG-13 rating.  If the audience has by then grown
tired of this overly long and confusing production, this sensuous sword
fight will easily rejuvenate their interest in the movie.</P>
<P>     THE MASK OF ZORRO by GOLDENEYE's director Martin Campbell features
lavish sets and golden cinematography in addition to swashbuckling
action and an uncountable number of explosions.  The script by John
Eskow and GODZILLA's Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott is the film's low
point.  So confusing that you may never get straight who is fighting
whom and why, the movie is sorely in need of a narrator.  They open the
movie with a huge block of text which helps some if the audience can
remember it all.</P>
<P>     The good news is that swordmaster Bob Anderson choreographed the
sword fights beautifully.  As the press kit notes, he has spent over 50
years in the motion picture industry doing this - his first pupil being
the great Erroll Flynn.  You'll recognize Anderson's techniques and
style.</P>
<P>     As the movie opens, Zorro, played by the unlikely action hero
Anthony Hopkins, is fighting a hundred men in the town square.  The
peasants, who view him as their only savior, cheer his every movement.
With the athletic agility of the Power Rangers, he jumps and leaps to
evade capture.</P>
<P>     After he disappears, we learn that in real life he is the wealthy
Don Diego de la Vega, who lives in a gadget-laden mansion a la
Batman's.  When Governor Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson) and his men
burst in, Zorro's wife is killed and the governor takes Zorro's infant
daughter Elena to be raised as his own.  Zorro is thrown into prison,
supposedly forever.</P>
<P>     The movie then jumps twenty years into the future with a vastly
changed political situation in California, where the story is set.  It
is best to enjoy the fight sequences and ignore the bewildering
explanations of who is on what side and why.  Stick to the basic rule
that Zorro and the peasants are good and that anyone with money is bad,
and you'll be able to follow enough of the storyline to get you by.</P>
<P>     The old Zorro (Hopkins) escapes from prison in order to kill his
old tormentor, the governor, but he ends up training a new Zorro
(Banderas) instead.  Zorro the elder does not bother to teach Zorro the
younger about guns.  The other side can use them, but Zorros stick to
steel.</P>
<P>     Banderas with true comedic flair uses great bravado and lots of
luck but less than the requisite skill in his first attempts at
challenging dozens of men.  But like James Bond, the character Zorro
most resembles, he eventually becomes even more adept at fighting
crowds of men than his teacher.</P>
<P>     Most of the story is a rehash of numerous others.  Young Zorro,
for example, gets to impersonate a priest in the confessional.  Elena
confesses her impure thoughts about Zorro to the "priest," and, of
course, he wants details.  There is even a sexy dance scene concocted
especially for Banderas to demonstrate his dancing talents.  He is
showing Elena the latest dance craze from Madrid, you see.</P>
<P>     If you love swashbucklers or if you're a Banderas fan, you'll
probably want to put the movie in your must-see category.  Others can
use their own judgement.</P>
<P>     THE MASK OF ZORRO runs way too long at 2:16.  It is rated PG-13
for some intense action and violence and would be fine for kids around
9 or 10 and up.</P>
<P>     My son Jeffrey, age 9, said the movie was "really good" and gave
it ***.  He liked all of the swordplay, but was frightened by such
scenes as the realistic pickled head and hand in a jar.</P>
