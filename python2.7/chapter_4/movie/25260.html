<P>     Pulp-noir is tough to pull off in this era of self-referential
hipness. Strangely enough, pulp-noir satire may be even tougher to pull
off, since the entire genre itself fairly reeks of self-parody every time
a hard-boiled guy, a hard-boiled situation and hard-boiled voice-over
dialogue combine on screen. Now take that pulp-noir satire and base it on
a real pulp novel, and you've got the potential for a smug disaster. THE
WOMAN CHASER shouldn't work. It _couldn't_ work.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Robinson Devor had the recipe for yet another inert
genre parody in his hands, but somehow he turned it into something so
wonderfully warped it's almost impossible to resist. Based on the novel of
the same name by Charles Willeford, THE WOMAN CHASER stars Patrick
Warburton (erstwhile "Seinfeld" David Puddy) as Richard Hudson, a used car
dealer recently returned to his hometown of Los Angeles circa 1960. 
Richard unexpectedly finds himself experiencing an existential crisis,
overwhelmed by the need to abandon sales and create something of lasting
value. He therefore sets out to write and direct his own film, a gritty
drama about an alienated trucker. With the help of his stepfather Leo
(Paul Malevitz), a washed-up former filmmaker, Richard gives the sales 
pitch of his life and finds his project picked up by Mammoth Studios. But
he could be in for hard lessons about "The Biz."</P>
<P>     If the above summary sets you to puzzling over the film's title, fear
not. In the 1950s and 1960s, Willeford wrote within a genre where
publishers couldn't care less what was inside the cover, so long as a
broad in a tight sweater and a provocative title were on the cover. The
author took advantage of that freedom to write unconventional stories like
the one that inspired the 1990 Alec Baldwin vehicle MIAMI BLUES, as well
as THE WOMAN CHASER (originally titled THE DIRECTOR). Robinson Devor uses
Willeford's own off-beat sensibility as a launching pad, then turns THE
WOMAN CHASER into such a twisted combination of subversion and homage that
you can only ride along where it takes you. Devor nails the genre
atmosphere, helped greatly by Kramer Morgenthau's marvelous 
black-and-white a la KISS ME DEADLY cinematography and Warburton's
note-perfect narration. Parody only seems to work when it's inspired by
genuine affection, and Devor clearly loves film noir, mannered conventions
and all.</P>
<P>     He also figures out that his story is a way to give a fresh twist to
the trite independent film premise of making an independent film. From
Richard's intense pitch of his film's concept, to his unconventional
methods of eliciting performances, to his obsession with the perfect
edited length of his film, THE WOMAN CHASER finds a kick for every
predictable situation. Devor even scripts the most trenchant line I've
ever heard on the phenomenon of people assuming they can write a film
(Richard, during his quest for an artistic outlet: "Sculpture and
architecture require years of training and practice ... but a _screenplay_
..."). Taking the concept out of the present day film-making world gives
it the perfect touch of the surreal, without even the faintest hint of the
superior outsider attitude that too often hinders movies about making
movies.</P>
<P>     Not all the quirkiness in THE WOMAN CHASER works, of course. There
are ebbs in Devor's pacing, and a narrative that doesn't always hang
together except as a showcase for Warburton's tremendously entertaining
performance. Yet even then there's entertainment value in virtually every
aborted narrative thread. And you've got to love a film that launches the
bearish Warburton on a bare-chested ballet, or lands him in bed with a
50-something Salvation Army volunteer. It's too easy to praise a film
simply for being different, but THE WOMAN CHASER is different in all the
right ways. It's energetic and imaginative where other parodies are too
often limp and witless. It skewers the ego of film-makers, but never loses
its love for film-making. It even pokes fun at film noir without resorting
to predictable gags. THE WOMAN CHASER is a surprise in every positive
sense of the word, because really, it shouldn't work.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 changes of direction:  8.</PRE>
