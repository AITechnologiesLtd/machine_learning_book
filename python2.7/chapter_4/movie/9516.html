<PRE>THE GAME (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: David Fincher
Writers: John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris (with a re-write by Andrew
Kevin Walker)
Starring: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger, James Rebhorn,
Armin Mueller-Stahl</P>
<P>There's a scene late in "The Game" where the protagonist suffers what is
probably the most kafkaesque, surreal, and literally breath-taking
sight.  I'm not going to go out and say what it is, because, well, I
want you to see this movie, but when I saw it, even I felt as alienated
and paranoid as the protagonist.  This is the skill that David Fincher
has: to pull us into the movie so much, that we're as scared and
thrilled as the protagonist.  So basically, this is the most thrilling
thriller in a long while.  Well, since "Se7en."</P>
<P>Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas) is a millionaire entropeneur-type
who owns a big company, a giant mansion his dad gave to him, and a new
ex-wife.  It's his 48th birthday, and he's more miserable than usual
since that was the birthday when his father killed himself by throwing
himself off the very roof under which he lives.  He's a control freak,
but more of a calmed-down one, instead of a frantic Steve Buscemi-ite,
who calmly yet with a sense of fatigue, works in his giant yet
claustrophobic office, and even has to be told by his secretary that
"Rachel on line 2" is his ex-wife.</P>
<P>That day, he also gets a visit from his black sheep brother (Sean Penn,
originally Jodie Foster, whom I can't picture at all in this) who gives
him his birthday present: "The Game."  It's something from a company
called "CRS" (forget the breakdown of this ackronym) that is meant to
relax rich people or something.  Nicholas is reluctant but eventually
goes to their offices, has a little chat with one of their heads (James
Rebhorn, finally getting a farily meaty role after all these years), and
is launched into an hour of bizarre exercises.</P>
<P>We, like him, have no clue what this game is about or the purpose or
anything about it.  They say it will come to him, and it eventually
does.  Weird things begin happening to him - i.e. he finds a clown
draped across the front of his house, dressed like his dad; his
television starts talking to him; and he gets a note telling him he must
follow some waitress he accidentally got fired from an elite restaurant
(Deborah Kara Unger, from "Crash").</P>
<P>The events start out like little pranks, but they soon become eery and
dangerous.  More and more bizarre things begin happening to him, and he
soon becomes incredibly paranoid, as do we.  We go through everything he
does, mainly because we get to know the character so well that he soon
becomes like one of those Hitchcock everybodies: a flawed human being
who plumets into a world of intrigue and surrealism.  Soon, Nicholas is
fighting an unknown assailant, trying to find the purpose of the game,
and trying to get out of it before anything worse happens.</P>
<P>By the time the film's over, we're as ragged as Nicholas.  We're with
him, praying for an explanation for what he and we have been through. 
And the ending would be a huge let-down if it weren't for the great
direction, which finishes up masterfully.</P>
<P>David Fincher is quickly becoming one of the better directors around. 
With his underrated "Se7en" behind him (not to mention the very
underrated "Alien 3"), he has proven that he can combine great style
with substance.  While "Alien 3" was just pure atmospheric fun, "Se7en"
had a satirical message, and "The Game" manages to try and fill in the
gaps of what's missing in the life of the modern-day Ebenezer Scrooge.</P>
<P>He's also obviously very influenced by Hitchcock.  As I said, the
Nicholas character is a pure Hitchcock character, but that's not where
it ends.  We also get a kind of bleak and gritty version of one of his
movies, some straight-out homages, and the strong sense of message
Hitchcock was so flawless at attaining.  I mean, all that's missing is a
walk-on by Mr. Fincher.  We even get scenes that are near duplicates of
some of his work, as well as some of the themes.  There are two scenes
straight out of "North by Northwest," there's a touch of "Vertigo at the
end," and there's probably even more if I went back and disected more
carefully.</P>
<P>But not only is this a kind of tip-of-the-hat to Hitchcock, but it's got
Kafka written all over it.  Nicholas is alienated, and is absolutely
alone at more than one point in the film.  And as the film goes on, he
gets more and more paranoid.  This kind of twisted horror view of the
world is exactly what Kafka wrote about, and this film is basically
modern-day Kafka.</P>
<P>As far as acting goes, Michael Douglas gives the best performance he has
in years, presenting a very flawed yet very likable man.  He's easy to
sympathize with, and you can just see him getting more and more crazy as
the film goes on.  He's in almost all of the scenes (okay, so he's in
all of them), and most of the actors are pretty much cameos or short
walk-ons.  </P>
<P>Sean Penn, in fact, is almost a cameo.  He has about three scenes in the
film, but he uses them nicely.  He's very slimey (he's the black sheep
brother, remember?) and at one point is incredibly nervous.  He does a
much better job than Jodie would have (even though Jodie probably could
have pulled it off, since she's one of the best actresses in the world).</P>
<P>Also, Deborah Kara Unger (who I had yet to see act) is amazing in this,
and should be picked up for more cool movies in the future.  She has a
very naturalistic style to her acting, making the lines seem more
down-to-earth than they would be coming from the mouth of another
actor.  James Rebhorn (who was in such films as "Scent of a Woman" and
"My Cousin Vinnie") is also very brief, but is excellent with what
screen time he has.  And Armin Mueller-Stahl is good in a very, very
brief role.</P>
<P>The writing is ingenius.  Yes, there are very agape plot holes, but they
never seem too incredible at the time, but that's really due to the
direction.  But we get a leisurely written film, starting off slowly and
letting us know the protagonist before everything hits the fan.  The
dialogue is witty and interesting, with some very funny lines that come
naturally instead of force-fed.</P>
<P>And, of course, the direction is amazing.  David Fincher combines
engrossing visuals with depth; atmostphere with purpose.  He brings
things to such high tension that there were whole scenes where I
literally held my breath until the big shock came.  As I said, he is
becoming one of the best directors around.</P>
<P>"The Game" is probably going to be written off as just a "very good
thriller."  But really, folks, thrillers this good do not come around
every month or so.  They're about as rare as a visit from the Comet
Kahoutek.  So appreciate this film, because we won't see a better
thriller until the next David Fincher film.</P>
