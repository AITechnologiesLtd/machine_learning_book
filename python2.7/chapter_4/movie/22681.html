<PRE>The Teaser:</PRE>
<P>Well, I might as well admit it from the start: I haven't seen Kubrick's
version
of Lolita, so you can take that into account when you read the following. I
am, however, in the process of reading the book as I write this, so I've
decided that I have a more or less adequate frame of reference to review
 this flick fairly. So, without much further ado:</P>
<PRE>The Synopsis:</PRE>
<P>The plot revolves around a Mr. Humbert Humbert. As the film opens, we
are treated to a wailing, 40's-style car, trying to drive in a straight line
down
a country road, but failing miserably to do so. In it, Humbert (Jeremy
Irons)
is in a dazed and confused state of mind, a gun lying on the seat beside
him,
and blood on his clothes. I find myself thinking: "Hey!"</P>
<P>Cue overvoiced monologue. Humbert tells the audience about his first love,
Annabelle, whom he met when he was living with his parents at a hotel
somewhere
in southern Europe (sorry, didn't quite catch the country). At this point he
is fourteen.
Humbert states that: "Whatever happens to a boy on the summer of his
fourteenth year,
can shape him for the rest of his life." The film quickly shows us that
Humbert and Annabelle
has an (at the very least) semi-sexual relationship. And then it kills her
off stating: Typhus.</P>
<P>Humbert, devastated at the loss of his first love, still lives on, and the
movie next joins
him some three decades later as he arrives in America, where he is to live
with a friend,
eventually taking a position as a teacher at a local college. However, his
friend's house is
no more, so instead he goes to live at a friend of his friend, the widow
Charlotte Haze
(Melanie Griffith). Upon arriving at the house, Charlotte puts some rather
un-subtle moves on
Humbert, who dismisses them with British properness. He isn't really
thrilled about the place,
and thinks about excusing himself and finding a hotel instead, but then he
eyes Charlotte's
daughter, Dolores (called Lolita, and played by Dominique Swain), and is
instantly attracted
to her, even though she is only a twelve-year old. He promptly decides to
stay.</P>
<P>During the next month or so, the sexual tension rises between the bubble-gum
blowing Lolita
and Humbert, while Charlotte and Lolita have a host of fights. Humbert
manages to get in a
few sexual advances at Lolita when Charlotte's not looking, and she doesn't
reject him openly.
Humbert's fairy tale ends, though, as Charlotte decides to send Lolita to a
summer camp.
Humbert, not wanting to be suspected, grudgingly keeps silent. Lolita
accuses him of being a traitor,
and he starts feeling sorry.</P>
<P>The day Lo's going to summer camp, Humbert wakes up late, and rushes to the
window.
Lolita is just about to get into the car, when she looks up at the house and
sees Humbert.
She dashes from the car, to the great irritation of Charlotte, and runs up
to Humbert's room,
where she gives him one passionate kiss, then runs down again. Humbert,
astonished, sees the
car drive away. He walks into Lo's room and throws himself into her left
clothes, hoping to catch
an essence of her.</P>
<P>The maid arrives at that point and hands him a letter, which he opens and
reads. It is from
Charlotte, who basically says that if he still is there when she comes home
from driving Lo
to the summer camp, then she takes it as a declaration of love. They are
soon married.</P>
<P>It is not a happy marriage, though. Humbert doesn't want to have sex with
Charlotte, and,
as such, gives her sleeping pills in order to get her off his back, but they
soon prove to not
be enough. He then goes to a doctor and casually asks about what might put a
cow in a
coma. The doctor sympathizes with Humbert, and gives him a new sort of
sleeping pills;
the sort the doctor himself uses on HIS wife.</P>
<P>Humbert returns home, but finds that Charlotte has discovered some entries
from his diary,
which describes her in a very bad tone, and contains some very loving
comments about Lolita.
She yells at him, telling him that he'll never see Lolita again, and that
she'll leave him. He
stammers through a weak explanation about it being an outline for a novel
("I used you and
Lo's names for easy reference!") and says that he'll fix them a drink. He
mixes two drinks, all the
while talking to her from the kitchen, but as he is about to go into the
living room again, a phone rings.
He answers it, and then says to Charlotte: "Honey, there's a man here
claiming you're dead."</P>
<P>He runs to the living room, where Charlotte is nowhere to be seen, then
dashes to the street.
Charlotte has been run over by a car, while going to the mailbox to mail
some letters. Humbert is
shocked, yet he quickly recovers, and decides to go to fetch Lolita, after
burning the letters.</P>
<P>Humbert arrives in the girl summer camp and is rather alarmed when a boy
named Charly is sent
to get Lolita. Lolita is cheerful, though, and the two embark on a trip to a
nearby hotel, Humbert
telling Lo that her mother is sick and in the hospital. Lolita shrugs it
away and moves on to tell
Humbert that she's been unfaithful to him, "not that it matters". Humbert
asks her why it shouldn't matter.
She replies that he doesn't care for her anymore; explaining it with him not
having kissed her yet.
They pull over and they start making out, but are interrupted by a passing
police officer, but
 although they are forced to break off their kissing, the officer doesn't
take any special notice.</P>
<P>The two arrive at the hotel, but a priest convention is taking up a lot of
hotel space, so Humbert and
Lo have to share a room with one bed. Lolita wants to tell Humbert about
something Charly, the only
boy at the summer camp, taught her, but Humbert refuses. Humbert allows for
her to get undressed
and go to bed without him looking on, and he takes a stroll through the
lobby. He is, however, uncomfortable
around the priests, and slips outside. Once outside, a mysterious man
adresses him, claiming to be
"with no-one." The man hints that he knows about Humberts intensions towards
Lolita, but disappears before
Humbert can confront him. Humbert retreats to the bedroom again, where he
lies down beside the now
sleeping Lolita.</P>
<P>The next morning, Humbert wakes up, finding Lolita besides him. She is giddy
and wants to tell him
about what Charly taught her. She whispers it in his ear, and he grins,
saying that he had never done
that. Lolita dares him, then notes: "One's got to show you everything." She
then rolls on top of him,
and they laugh at each other.</P>
<P>Cut to later. They are checking out of the hotel, and driving on. Stopping
at a gas station, Lolita wants
to call her mom at the hospital, but Humbert tells her she's dead. Cut to a
cheap motel that night. Lolita
is sobbing in one room; Humbert staring into the ceiling in another. Lolita
eventually comes running in to
be comforted by Humbert.</P>
<P>Now begins a long journey that ends with Humbert arriving at the city where
he is to teach. Upon arrival,
he applies for a teaching job in prep-school instead, and he gets it. Lolita
begins attending that school, too.
All is well at first, but Lolita begins a rebellion against Humbert, who
doesn't want her to fraternize too much
with her friends at school. Nevertheless, Humbert allows her to be in a
school-play, written by an author
named Quilty (Frank Langella) who bears a striking resemblance to the
mystical man that confronted Humbert
at the hotel.</P>
<P>Eventually Lo and Humbert get into a fight, which ends with Lolita running
out and away. Humbert begins a
search for her, and locates her in an icebar the same evening. There, she
has decided that they ought to go
on another journey. Humbert willingly agrees, and as a voiceover confirms
that he is signing his own death
sentence by agreeing, the journey begins.</P>
<P>Humbert notices that they are being followed, but Lolita thinks nothing of
it. At some point during the journey,
Lolita falls ill, and Humbert takes her to a hospital. Although he wants to
stay, the doctor sends him home,
and when he arrives the next day, Lolita is gone. He goes into a hysterical
frenzy, but manages to control himself
once the police arrive.</P>
<P>Embarking on a search for Lolita, Humbert travels around, but is unable to
find her anywhere, and thus,
returns to his teaching position. Once there, he gets a letter from Lolita.
She writes that she is now married
and pregnant, but that they are missing money. Humbert, obsessed with taking
revenge on his rival goes to
Lolita personally, but discovers that it is not the man she has married that
she betrayed him for. Lolita tells him
that the man she really loved was Quilty, though she left him because he
wanted her to be in an "art movie.
Two boys, two men, and two girls." Humbert gives her the money she needs,
begging her to come and live
with him. Lolita refuses, stating that her husband needs her. Accepting
that, Humbert takes off to
find and murder Quilty.</P>
<P>He eventually tracks Quilty to a big mansion, where he corners him and,
after a bit of cat-and-mouse
playing, shoots him several times. Quilty remains all the time blissfully
unaware that he is about to die,
as he is clearly either influenced by drugs or simply a madman. Humbert
takes off again, and we're back
where we started. He drives to a hill, cops hot on his tail, and looks out
over a small city. He delivers one
final voice-over as we cut to the credits.</P>
<PRE>The Rambling:</PRE>
<P>First, let me apologize for the rushedness of the last part of my synopsis.
I didn't want to go into as much
detail after Humbert got what he wanted, but on the other hand, I needed to
mention the rest of the plot
after so much detail on the other half.</P>
<P>I found the movie to be quite good. In fact, rather good. In fact, very
good. While there were quite
a few details the movie failed to mention, which has mention in the book, I
don't think it failed a lot there.
It would be hard to cramp all the details in a feature film.</P>
<P>The movie is built up in a way that lays most weight on two characters,
Humbert and Lolita, so the
whole picture more or less falls flat if they fall flat. Fortunately, they
don't. Even though I haven't seen
Jeremy Irons in a lot of other films, I was looking forward to seeing him,
because he's always delivered
sterling performances, but here is an exception. His performance here is not
sterling; it's stellar. He perfectly
conveys Humbert's strangely fascinating obsession with 'nymphettes' (as
Humbert calls them), and I truly
sympathize with him when it all falls through. The voice-overs especially
are extremely well read, and the
final scene, where he confronts his anti-thesis (more on that later) Quilty,
is fantastic.</P>
<P>Dominique Swain came from nowhere as far as I know, but she is perfectly
cast as Lolita, playing her
with just the right mixture of innocence and insidiousness. Plus, she looks
the part. I'll admit that I, while I
mostly confine myself to worshiping Natalie Portman when it comes to young
actresses, was really swayed
over by her performance. There is spectacular talent in the young woman, and
I can only hope that it will be
used in the future.</P>
<P>The rest of the cast delivered for the most part decent performances, but
Melanie Griffith stood out as a rather
nice performance, giving an almost likeable personality to the irritating
housewife she was given.
Frank Langella was okay in his scenes, too, but I had a feeling of routine
acting from his part. Of course,
it might have been him being outshone by Jeremy Irons, so I'm willing to
guess that he did the best he could
with his rather limited material.</P>
<P>The directing was good, although I never really got the surrealistic
nightmare-like scene, which is exactly
why I haven't mentioned it in my synopsis.</P>
<P>Now to the anti-thesis thing. The reason I can sympatize with Humbert, is
that he has a genuinely likeable
personality. He is gentle and compassionate, and actually has very few flaws
(although they are pretty big).
It is that way I like to think of myself too, so that's more or less the
reason I like the guy. Quilty, however,
is not like that. He is the mass-producing artist to Humbert's compassionate
painter. While Humbert might
use a few years on a single painting, Quilty might spare not more than a few
days on each. With painting being
a metaphor for 'nymphette', of course. Quilty is a pedophile; Humbert's a
childlover. The difference may
not be obvious, so let me clarify: Quilty wants sex with children for a
kick - Humbert sees children romantically,
and truly loves them. And, just as a normal man would love a grown-up woman,
he loves a child, taking
all parts of the relationship with it. Including the sex.</P>
<P>In fact, the whole story is, in my eyes, not about sex with children or
anything like that; it is about a man's
obsession with a woman (alright, girl) and how he is taken to the extremes
of his emotions. I think the story
is more of a love story than a lust story. It is the romantical Humbert
Humbert in one corner, and everyone
else in the other. Even Lolita, the girl he loves, goes against him. It is a
tradegy of Shakespearean proportions
in my humble opinion. I suppose I'll take more than a little pounding for
that remark.</P>
<PRE>The Music:</PRE>
<P>Ennio Morricone is mostly known for his western soundtracks, but here he
does a good job too. The music
lies in the background, as well it should do in a movie like this, and helps
set the mood right. Every once in a
while, and old song from the era pops up as Lolita hears it, and they are
quite well chosen. The soundtrack
in itself is not exactly spectacular, but it is okay. Buy it if you really
like 40's music or if you're a fan of
Ennio Morricone, else, hear it first.</P>
<PRE>The Summing-Up:</PRE>
<P>I started my rambling with saying that I thought the movie to be very good.
As I've thought a little bit
about it, I've redicided: I think it is excellent. I understand that it
didn't reach theaters in the US, to which
I can only say I am sorry. I would have loved to see this movie on the big
screen, but even here in Denmark,
it only got into certain theaters, and not any in my vicinity. I recommend
this to anyone who loves a good story
about obsessiveness, as well as to people who enjoy great acting (and who
doesn't?).</P>
<PRE>Rating: 9.5/10</PRE>
<P>Best line: "Please concentrate, Mr. Quilty. You are about to die!"
