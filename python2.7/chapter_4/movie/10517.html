<P>The Sweet Hereafter  ****
R, 1997
Directed and written by Atom Egoyan. Based on a novel by Russell Banks.
Starring Ian Holm, Caerthan Banks, Sarah Polley.</P>
<P>Whoever saw to it that the story of "The Sweet Hereafter," in which a lawyer
wants to sue for negligence when over a dozen children are killed in a bus
accident in a small town in British Columbia, fell into the hands of
independent Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan has done a service to modern
cinema. I can imagine, quite clearly, how a Hollywood studio would have
handled this: first off, we would have seen a slow-motion shot of the bus
skidding off the road. Then the lawyer would arrive and discover that a Greedy
Corporation is to blame for not following safety standards. Then their morally
despicable executives would try, unsucessfully, to quell the lawsuit. Finally,
there would be a resounding courtroom victory with a swell of classical music
in the background.</P>
<P>None of that happens in "The Sweet Hereafter." Egoyan is less concerned with
the accident itself than he is with the townspeople, the lawyer Mitchell
Stephens (Ian Holm), and how they are affected in its aftermath. The story is
not told in linear order, and in fact it is not completely clear until the end
how it all fits together. But this is not simply artsiness for the sake of
artsiness; Egoyan uses this framework to show us more clearly how the
characters are changed by the accident. At the same time, the non-linear
structure works in exactly the opposite way in the examination of Holm's
character; no matter what day or even what year it is, he is always trying to
relate to his estranged drug-addict daughter who sporadically contacts him by
telephone. He is the one character who seems to be a constant, who is always
occupied by the same struggle, whether the film is in flashback, present-day,
or flash-forward.</P>
<P>When Stephens arrives, he is understandably met with skepticism from some of
the residents who think he is exploiting the situation. He certainly knows the
tricks of his trade very well; one of his top priorities is to make sure that
none of his clients or witnesses are in any way disreputable, so as to be sure
that their testimony will be taken seriously. Even when he delivers an
impassioned speech explaining that he seeks to punish whatever person or
corporate entity was responsible for the accident (presumably through
negligence), we still wonder if he is manipulating the grieving parents. It is
not until the situation with his daughter becomes clear that we see otherwise:
having failed to protect or rescue his own child from the dangers of society,
he seeks to protect others and, as he says himself, to give voice to the anger
over tragedies such as the bus accident.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, not everyone in town is quite on the same page, and no one is
perfect either. The couple who first contacted him are emotionally distant
from each other, and the wife (Alberta Watson) has been conducting an affair
with local widower Billy Ansel (Bruce Greenwood). Billy himself sees Stephens
as a threat to the community who is undermining the support that residents had
always provided for each other. One couple seems to share Stephens's desire to
punish those who may have been negligent, but another couple seems to be in it
for the money. The latter couple's daughter Nicole (Sarah Polley), who
survived the accident, begins to wonder if she is being used and starts to
resist, but in a very questionable way. And then there is Stephens himself,
who doesn't really seem to know where to direct the anger of which he speaks.
Never once is he able to explain exactly *who* was negligent in this case - he
is simply determined to sue *somebody*.</P>
<P>"The Sweet Hereafter" is not about who is "right" or "wrong" in this
situation, as most of those involved appear, at the very least, to be acting
out of good intentions. Rather, the film examines the fragility of human
relationships and how a group of people, all trying to do the right thing in
one way or another, end up at odds with each other. There is a certain
stillness and tranquility which Egoyan evokes through his exterior shots of
the rural, snow-bound town, but this sense of peace and acceptance lingers
throughout the film, even after Stephens's shaky alliance starts to crack and
members of the community start to divide against each other. It is as if the
failure of the characters to achieve reconciliation following the accident is
simply an inevitabilty.do the right thing in one way or another, end up at
odds with each other.</P>
<P>This may make the film sound unrelentingly grim, yet the tone of "The Sweet
Hereafter" is not one of nihilistic resignation, but merely one of regret that
only imperfect closure seems to be possible. Some character-centered films
focus on an obviously flawed protagonist and how the person eventually manages
to overcome a clearly negative aspect of his or her life or personality. For
the lead characters in "The Sweet Hereafter" - most notably Stephens, Nicole,
and Billy - the road is not quite so perilous, but none of them quite reach
the end either.</P>
