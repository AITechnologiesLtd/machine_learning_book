<P>Nancy Savoca's "Dogfight" is a virtually unknown gem, and is one of the 
sweetest, most touching romances of the decade. It was barely released 
in 1991 by Warner Brothers, who must not have had much faith in such a 
truthful motion picture, and it shows (since then, they have widely 
released such gems as 1997's "Batman and Robin," and this year alone, 
have come out with the likes of "Major League III," and "The Avengers"). 
"Dogfight," however, is an important film that deserves to be seen, and 
includes two of the best performances of the 90's.</P>
<P>Set in 1963, primarily during one fateful night, four young Marines stop 
in a small town for their last night stateside, not knowing the horrors 
that await them in Vietnam. Together, they decide to participate in the 
game, "Dogfight," which requires each of them to find the ugliest woman 
they can find, take her to a party, and then have them judged on the the 
most unattractive one. The film focuses mostly on Birdlace (River 
Phoenix, in one of his last movies), who, while looking for a victim, 
stumbles into a coffee shop and meets Rose (Lili Taylor), an introverted 
young woman who hides behind frumpy clothes and her love of folk music. 
They start to talk, and Birdlace asks her to come to the party, and she 
agrees to it, not believing that someone would actually be interested in 
her. Birdlace realizes Rose isn't actually "ugly," but it's the best he 
can do. </P>
<P>That is only the beginning of "Dogfight," a quiet, flawlessly 
made film, in which not much more should be said, except to say that 
Birdlace begins to actually like Rose, and it develops into much more of 
a complex story than it originally seems.</P>
<P>Although the basic plotline may sound cruel and mean-spirited, and it 
is, at the center of the story is a wonderful, sweet, poignantly 
written, love story. To get a feel for the type of picture it is, the 
movie is similar in structure to 1995's "Before Sunrise," which was 
about two twentysomethings who meet on a train and decide to spend the 
day together in Venice before going their separate ways. The 
differences, however, is that this film is set during the Vietnam War 
and there are much more serious overtones. </P>
<P>If there is one element of "Dogfight" that I could single out as being 
brilliant in every sense of the word, it is Lili Taylor, who, in one 
role after the other, gives a three-dimensional, flesh-and-blood 
performance, and this is her best role to date. Her character is so 
likable that when bad things happen to her, it is heartbreaking and 
feels unfair. One of the best scenes occurs early on, after she has been 
humiliated at the Dogfight, and goes home, turns on her folk record in 
her bedroom, and simply sits down to listen to it. Sure, she has just 
been embarrassed, but at least she has her music. Most movies wouldn't 
have the integrity to include such a small, delicate scene, but it is an 
important moment.</P>
<P>The last ten minutes of "Dogfight" are what makes the movie really 
special, however, particularly the startlingly powerful last scene, in 
which nothing is said or explained, but then, nothing needs to be. </P>
