<PRE>               A film review by Vince Waldron</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1997 Vince Waldron</PRE>
<P>One of the real joys of this past season, and definite must-see.  A wholly
original film that's packed with great performances and privileged
moments.  Though nominally the tale of two brothers struggling to save the
failing restaurant on which they've pegged their hopes and dreams, that
synopsis doesn't begin to do justice to the film's poetry, nor does it
prepare you for the surprising generosity of the film's exquisite pace. 
Alternately riveting and almost maddeningly langorous, this is a film of
paradoxes: a film of nuanced subtlety whose comedy is at times painted in
broad strokes indeed.  Making this film must have been an act of faith on
the part of all involved, since it's difficult to imagine how any of the
film's grace notes could possibly have been spelled out in the script, as
good as it may have been.  An elegant tale, deftly told.
