"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>It's one thing for an actor or an actress to pump out several films over
a short period of time, but it's something else entirely when a director
tries to tackle a similar task.  And to have the films rank among the
best of that period is a true testament to the director's talent.</P>
<P>In just over two years (twenty-five months, to be exact), director
Steven Soderbergh has released Out of Sight, The Limey and his latest
film, Erin Brockovich - a true story about a single mom that led the
fight against a utility company which ultimately culminated in the
largest settlement in a direct class-action lawsuit in U.S. history.
Fans of Soderbergh, whose first film (Cannes winner sex, lies &
videotape) is widely recognized as launching the renaissance of American
independent film, may be surprised to see the director filming what
appears to be a glossy Hollywood courtroom drama with a predictably
linear story and a larger-than-life female star (Julia Roberts).</P>
<P>Although he's treading in all-too-familiar territory that isn't at all
familiar to him, Soderbergh has crafted yet another winner with
Brockovich, directing Roberts to her best performance yet.  In fact,
she's so good that it's a surprise that Universal didn't hold
Brockovich's release until the end of the year – a season typically
reserved for films competing for major year-end awards.  Perhaps the
studio couldn't help releasing the film on St. Patrick's Day, so that
some crafty critic could whimsically declare `Go See Erin
go-Brock-ovich.'</P>
<P>Roberts (Runaway Bride) stars as the titular Brockovich, a single L.A.
mom with three kids, a roach-infested house, big hair, high heels, short
skirts and low-cut tops.  She has a beat-up Hyundai, empty cupboards,
two deadbeat ex-husbands, no money, no job, no education and a wicked
case of sass-mouth.  The only thing this former Miss Wichita has going
for her are her good looks and killer rack, but even they can't help
Erin secure a settlement when she's broadsided by a doctor that runs a
red light and creams her vehicle.  With no insurance, Erin finds herself
$17,000 in debt.</P>
<P>Desperate to find work, Erin turns to the attorney that handled her auto
accident.  She guilts Ed Masry (Albert Finney, Simpatico) into hiring
her as a file clerk at his tiny, private law firm where, almost by
chance, Erin stumbles onto a real estate file containing some ominous
medical data concerning a giant utility company.  Despite not knowing a
lick about the law, Erin does some digging and finds out that Pacific
Gas & Electric knowingly poisoned the water of a Mojave Desert burg
called Hinkley.  Through hard work, perseverance and a bunch of dumb
luck, she's able to piece together a case against PG&E, signing up over
six hundred plaintiffs in the process.  The result is a battle between
the $28 billion company and Roberts' $20 million smile (and who would
you put your money on?).</P>
<P>As Erin's life becomes consumed by the Hinkley case, she begins to
neglect her own family, leaning heavily on her new biker boyfriend
George (a nearly unrecognizable Aaron Eckhart, Any Given Sunday).  But
she believes that the sacrifice is worth missing big chunks of her
children's lives.  For the first time, Erin feels like she is making a
difference, befriending many of the Hinkley plaintiffs, including
struggling mothers Marg Helgenberger (Species 2), Cherry Jones (Cradle
Will Rock) and Mimi Kennedy (Dharma & Greg).</P>
<P>Soderbergh doesn't bog the film down with courtroom scenes, which makes
the two-plus-hour film seem to fly by.  The director used his brilliant
cohorts - Sight editor Anne V. Coates and Limey cinematographer Edward
Lachman - to film the Susannah Grant (Ever After) script, which,
although extremely conventional, is well-written, fresh and often very
funny.  Some interesting casting – the real Brockovich plays a diner
waitress in an early scene (her name tag says `Julia'), producer Michael
Shamberg plays a PG&E lawyer, and Judge Leroy A. Simmons, the judge that
handed down the 1993 decision that allowed the real-life suit to
proceed, plays himself.</P>
