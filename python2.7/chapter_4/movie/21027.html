<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Poor Veronica.  She's in love with the wealthy Senator, Marco Venier.
But because of that pesky caste system, it is impossible for them to
marry.  So Veronica does the next logical thing.  She becomes a
courtesan.</P>
<P>Such is the allegedly true story behind Dangerous Beauty, a beautiful
yet unintentionally hilarious look at high-class whores in 1583 Venice.
Catherine McCormack (Braveheart) is Veronica, the milky-breasted hottie
with hair of spun copper who falls for her unobtainable hunk, the
bug/lazy-eyed nobleman played by Rufus Sewell (Dark City).  Luckily,
they live in a time when mistresses are pretty much acceptable.</P>
<P>Veronica's Mom (Jacqueline Bisset), a former courtesan (as was her
Mother), shows her future-slut-of-a-daughter the hooking ropes.  She
starts slowly, teaching Veronica how to properly eat and drink like a
seductive concubine and then quickly builds up to the proper technique
for `man-handling' the johns.</P>
<P>Showing little remorse or inhibition in her new profession, Veronica
eagerly pleases her first lay and quickly becomes the most popular
trollop in all of Venice.  She also possesses a unique flare for poetry,
which strangely makes the guys want her even more.  Early on, the city
is sent in to a tizzy by a very public and very silly sword and pen
fight between Veronica and Maffio Venier (Oliver Platt, A Time to Kill),
a friend of Marco.</P>
<P>When the Venetian warmongers turn to France for help in the impending
war over Cypress, the visiting horndog King Henry takes immediate notice
of Veronica and makes it clear that if she pleases him, he will lend his
ships for battle.  Now this King Henry is twice the man of both faggy
Prince Edward from Braveheart and the upcoming limp-wristed King Louis
in The Man in the Iron Mask.  Our Veronica shags him so well that he
commits most of his fleet.</P>
<P>So far, so good, but the story takes an idiotic twist involving the
plague and the religious right.  See, the church blames the plague on
the courtesans and, even though she curled the toes of the King of
France for her fair city, Veronica is deemed deserving of death for
being a dirty stinking harlot.  There is a big dumb Holy Inquisition
scene that borders on being wildly ridiculous.</P>
<P>I expected a more depressing ending from director Marshall Herskovitz
and producer Edward Zwick, the gloomy minds behind the quality
television tear-jerkers thirtysomething, My So Called Life and
relativity and, more dramatically, Legends of the Fall.  Herskovitz and
cinematographer Bojan Bazelli (Kalifornia) craft pictures of an
astonishingly dazzling quality.  The soft warm lighting brings to mind
the works of Emmanuel Lubezki (Like Water for Chocolate), Darius Khondji
(Stealing Beauty) and maybe even the Vaseline-coated photography of
Gerald Perry Finnerman (Moonlighting).</P>
<P>McCormack is thoroughly mesmerizing as Veronica, blending the
tantalizing qualities of both the Virgin Mother and Mary Magdalene
simultaneously.  She also resembles former Sports Illustrated swimsuit
model Paulina Porizkova.  Her beauty was obviously played down in
Braveheart as her acting skills were in Loaded.  Sewell is merely
adequate in his role, although the sex scene between the two is one of
the hottest screen spectacles since Broken English.</P>
<P>Dangerous Beauty could have been a much better movie if it didn't take
the ugly turn towards Demi Moore's The Scarlet Letter.  But, I guess
when you're filming a true story, you don't have too many options to
liven things up.  And, in this case, that's just too bad.</P>
