INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE
 OF DOOM
Review By David Wilcock (C)1998</PRE>
<P>Running Time: 118 minutes (1 hour 58 minutes)
 Starring Harrison Ford, Kate Capshaw and Ke Huy Quan
 Directed By Steven Spielberg
 OSCAR(R) Nominations: Best Music, Visual Effects (Won)</P>
<P>Steven Spielbergs headache inducing, if not pariculary exciting,
second Indiana Jones adventure. A prequel to Raiders of the
Lost Ark (1981), this film sees intrepid archaeologist/adventurer
Indiana Jones (Ford) plunged into a dark world of child slaves,
thugees and dark rituals. It's up to Jones, and his child friend Short
Round (Quan) and singer Willie Scott (Capshaw), to save the
kids, and stop the thugees from finding two diamonds that could
give them a lot of power.</P>
<P>Temple of Doom starts well enough with a well directed
performance of 'Anything Goes', performed by Willie. We then
have one of the greatest opening sequences ever when Jones
bargains with two Chinese over a diamond. Naturally, the
bargaining goes wrong, and the sequence turns into a slapstick
routine with Jones trying to find the diamond which is being kicked
all around a restaurant. It's a very well directed scene, and features
even more chaos than Speilbergs own 1941 (1979) jitterbug
scene. After this, there's an exciting plane crash. But after the plane
crash, the film starts to go downhill when Indy is set on his quest.</P>
<P>The main problem with the film is that it tries to out do Raiders of
the Lost Ark on every level. The film features more 'gross out'
gags, more stunts, more explosions and more gory deaths, but
strangely it all seems 'dead.' It all seems to be in there just for the
hell of it. Unlike Raiders, where all the big chases and stunts were
exciting, Temple of Doom piles on so many deaths, explosions
etc. it just cancels itself out. The film is trying so hard to make the
audience excited, it just falls flat on it's face.</P>
<P>Also, the heroine in this picture is pathetic. She just shouts and
screams, and points out the obvious. She seems to just ask 'What
is it?' questions, so Indy can explain to her, but mainly to the
audience, what is going on in the film. From the start, Capshaw is
terrible, just shouting and screaming and being really annoying. If I
were Indy, I would of tried to dump her as quickly as possible.
Had the screenwriters wrote her part better, her whining and
screaming could of been funny. However, like everything else in
this film, she is hugely exgrarated, and almost seems pointless in
this film. The child sidekick, though, is nowhere near as annoying,
and is good fun. He has some good lines, and even gets the chance
to kick some thugee butt. Ford, as usual, is fun, although he was
better in Raiders, and even Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade (1989).</P>
<P>Spielberg's direction, however, is too frantic. The film belts along,
and never lets the audience catch up. He never gives the audience
a chance to enjoy a stunt, because the picture moves along too fast
to let the audience enjoy it. It's a shame, because there are some
good stunt scenes in there, including a amazing mine cart
sequence.  It's just on the first viewing, the audience will never
catch up on them. Also, the script is weak. It's mainly just
references to the first film (even though this is a prequel) and the
dialogue between Indy and Willie is dud. The script only really
works with scenes between Indy and Shorty, but they work more
on the strength of the actors than the script. Also, the film is a bit
too violent for young kids, the target audience. If your child can
stand watching hearts ripped out and men crushed by rock
crushers, they may enjoy this film.</P>
<P>It's not all that bad, though. Some of the action scenes are good,
and the film has a great sense of humor. Some of the scenes made
me laugh out loud. But, overall, it just isn't much fun. It's too dark,
too eager to excite us, and Indy has hardly any character in this
film. Temple of Doom, then, is disappointing, and the weakest of
the Indiana Jones trilogy.</P>
