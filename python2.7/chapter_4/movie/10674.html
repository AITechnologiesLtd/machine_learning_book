<PRE>A review by Michael Babitsky</PRE>
<P>        Replacement Killers marks the American debut of Chow-Yun Fat. For 
those not familiar with his work, he has been in the business (TV and 
Film) for a long time. Most famous in America for his work with John Woo: 
The Killer, A Better Tomorrow 1 and 2, and Hard Boiled, Chow's repertoire 
is not in any way restricted to action films. He has been in many 
comedies and dramas as well: Hong Kong 1941, God of Gamblers, and All 
About Ah-Long (for which he won a Best Actor award) are some of his best 
work in those areas.  
        Chow, in my opinion, is one of the greatest actors who ever lived 
and the fact that Chinese is not my native tongue probably adds more to 
that title.  He was made for the camera.
        Now, it's true that Chow is amazing in gun-toting action roles, 
mainly because of his incomparable coolness and charisma.  It's a fact 
that no one looks better than Chow with a gun in each hand, therefore it 
was inevitable that Chow's first dive into American cinema would be an 
action film.
        Replacement Killers is not, in any way, a bad movie. The best way 
to describe it would be painfully mediocre.  
        The movie starts off well.  A man is being chased through the 
streets, and is captured and killed by a cop.  It turns out that he was 
the child of a very powerful man (Kenneth Tsang).  That powerful man 
wants revenge, the cop must be killed.  Enter John Li (Chow Yun-Fat).  
John is told that he must kill the cop's son and this will be his last 
job.  Well, John can't kill him because he has a heart of gold.  So, 
instead of killing the boy, he basically ruins the rest of his life 
putting himself and his family in danger.
        John needs a fake passport to China, and is sent to Meg Coburn 
(Mira Sorvino), bad guys come to kill her and John, and they fail.  The 
rest is pretty predictable.
        Chow's English is great.  He has two 'speeches' in the movie and 
they are both well-delivered. However, when he speaks in short sentences 
he sounds stiff.
        Well, action movies such as this are not often hailed for their 
intriguing character development.  What usually separates the good from 
the ugly in this genre is style.  Fuqua (whose only credit is directing 
Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise music video) handles the direction nicely.  
The action scenes, for the most part, look good, but never really become 
tense or exciting.  The main characters are 2-dimensional and the bad 
guys, even more-so.  There are quite a few memorable scenes, though. A 
short gun fight in a movie theater was nice.  Chow with a gun in both 
hands shooting down a car going in reverse was definitely cool.  There is 
also an interesting use of colors, neon greens, reds…, etc.
        There are quite a few HK movie influences here, and when Fuqua 
gets creative, the result is excellent; but, there is not enough 
originality in this movie.  The atmosphere is cold and humorless, and any
emotion seems out of place.  Chow has an incredible smile, but this film 
never lets him use it.  </P>
<P>The print I saw had no music, and a good score could definitely help the 
movie out.</P>
