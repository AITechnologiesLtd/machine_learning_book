<PRE>                           BLAST FROM THE PAST
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     A great score never hurt anybody, and with its hoppin' swing tunes,
BLAST FROM THE PAST gets quite a boost from a jumping swing soundtrack!</P>
<P>     Oh... wait a sec... the movie, right?  Well, what are you
expecting?  Maybe: "BLAST FROM THE PAST is a thoughtful analysis of Cold
War posturing and American paranoia in the 1960's?"  I don't think so. 
Let's try: "BLAST FROM THE PAST is a feel-good romp about a fish out of
water who tries to make sense out of a world gone wacky!"</P>
<P>     That'll do just fine.  Adam (Fraser) is the fish.  The world is
late 1990's Los Angeles.  The uber-hokey plot builds upon a jet
crash-landing in the unborn Adam's backyard on the eve of the Bay of
Pigs, sending the folks (Walken and Spacek) down into the enormous
fallout shelter below.  Convinced it's Armageddon, they hole up for 35
years, and Adam is born -- and raised -- with only his 1960's-mentality
folks to guide him.</P>
<P>     Then it's time to hit the surface.  Naturally, wacky hijinx ensue,
including a panicky bus ride, a gay baseball game, a hip dance number, a
cult formation, numerous car accidents, and many many many wry
observations likening modern life to a post-Apocalyptic wasteland.  But
not so Apocalyptic that a boy can't find himself a girl (Silverstone)!</P>
<P>     Okay, it's funny.  I even laughed out loud.  More than once.  Dave
Foley (of course) steals the show as Silverstone's hysterical
confidant.  Walken as the paranoid, anti-Commie father is also a treat
to watch.  Fraser isn't bad... very over the top, but not bad.  Of
course, Silverstone has the acting ability of a can of beets, but hey,
nothing's perfect.</P>
<PRE>     Perfect date movie for 1999.  But I'm not sure this one will keep
for 35 years.</PRE>
