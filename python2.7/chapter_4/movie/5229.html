<PRE>                                 MALLRATS
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        MALLRATS is the follow-up to Kevin Smith's acclaimed 
unrated extravaganza CLERKS and it left me with two prevailing 
impressions -- this guy's a genius but he's also a sellout. The beauty 
of his debut film was that it didn't adhere to all the conventions of 
popular cinema. MALLRATS, on the other hand, is driven by formulaic 
Hollywood romance rules, even down to the cheesy keyboard music 
featured in the background during serious dialogue. As far as that 
aspect of the plot goes, we've been there, done that plenty of times 
and know exactly what's going to happen ahead of time, but 
MALLRATS at least partially redeems itself by integrating the 
worn twentysomething romance theme with Smith's truly unique 
humor and Tarantinoesque dialogue.</P>
<P>        MALLRATS is centered around that pillar of modern 
American society, the shopping mall, where Generation X'ers with 
nothing better to do go to hang out. That's how you know it's a 
movie, because in real life, mall demographics are at least 75% junior 
high kids sneaking cigarettes and kicking off every sentence with the 
phrase "Oh... my... God!" Here we have slackers like T.S. (Jeremy 
London) and Brody (Jason Lee) wandering around the mall after 
being dumped by their girlfriends, who both conveniently turn up at 
the mall. T.S.' ex, Brandi, was in love with him but was pressured into 
the breakup by her game show host father. Brody's ex, Renee 
(Shannen Doherty), broke up with him because all he ever did 
was read comics and play Sega games.</P>
<P>        The plot revolves around the taping of Brandi's dad's game 
show at the mall (another interesting coincidence) and the sabotage 
thereof by CLERKS holdovers Jay and Silent Bob. Renee, meanwhile, 
is being wooed by a mall manager who finds women on the rebound 
and "screws them in an uncomfortable place." ("The backseat of a 
Volkswagon?") As with any wacky comedy, though, the plot is 
secondary to a series of wacky situations, including an assault on the 
Easter bunny, an appearance by Marvel Comics artist Stan Lee, and a 
topless fortune teller, along with those Tarantino-inspired dialogues 
about everything from how Superman could impregnate Lois Lane to 
Brody's "smelly palm" trick. These sequences are original and funny 
and make the movie worth watching, even if the reliance on a 
conventional formula to tie it all together ultimately brings the 
viewing experience down. MALLRATS is an unusual marriage 
between creativity and cliche.</P>
