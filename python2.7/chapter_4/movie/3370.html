<PRE>                             CIRCLE OF FRIENDS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Chris O'Donnell, the male lead in the film, is handsome, young
(24), and at the top of my list for a long and fruitful career as an
actor.  Remember him in SCENT OF A WOMAN where he played opposite Al
Pacino, winning a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor and
the Chicago Film Critics award for The Most Promising  Actor of the
Year?   His charisma hits you instantly.  In CIRCLE OF FRIENDS he plays
Jack Foley, the star of the rugby team at the college he attends in
Dublin.  (O'Donnell, by the way, is the only American in the film.)</P>
<P>     There are friends and there are friends and not always do they do
the expected.  In 1957, Benny (Minnie Driver) and her friend Eve
(Geraldine O'Rawe) leave their small town of Knockglen to attend
college in Dublin where they run into another friend, Nan (Saffron
Burrows).   While Nan is a blonde beauty and Eve is a beautiful
brunette, Bennie is the "plain Jane."  It ia interesting to note that
Driver, who plays Benny is a beautiful TV star in the UK who had to put
on thirty pounds to give her a somewhat dowdy look.</P>
<P>     The story, written by best-selling author Maeve Binchy, is of the
goals, the hopes and dreams of the three small-town women who are now
on their own and of Jack who sees in Benny the goodness and inner charm
that more superficial men had failed to notice.</P>
<P>     Conflict and deceit intrude among the friends in the circle;
nothing in real life goes smoothly forever.  Director Pat O'Connor
superbly brings all of that to life in this very lovely film.</P>
