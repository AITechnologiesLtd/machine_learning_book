<PRE>                            THE USUAL SUSPECTS
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1995 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>     THE USUAL SUSPECTS is confusing, implausible, and very successful.
If that's convoluted, so is the movie.  It shows that a cast with
self-confidence and style can take a plot full of holes and wrap it in
panache.  It doesn't matter a whit that nothing in the movie makes
sense.  Just watching the chaos unfold in the hands of these actors is
reward enough.</P>
<P>     The film opens with a rare moment of clarity as five very literate
felons appear in a police lineup.  Tossed into a communal jail cell,
McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Hockney (Kevin
Pollak), Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey)
wonder why the cream of their criminal crop would be rounded up and
impounded together, but proceed anyway to plan an operation so
undefined that is impossible to describe, much less understand.</P>
<P>     There is a lot of dying in this movie, but it's fairly impersonal
because the trigger man usually lurks in the shadows, of which there
are many.  Twenty-seven bodies are laid out on a pier in the opening
scene, and the movie works its way backward from there, trying to
figure out who they are and how they got there.  What we do know is
that the dazzling finale is the illogical outcome of the jail cell
plotting session.</P>
<P>     Over the whole intricate web hangs the spectre of Keyser Soze, an
infamous villain who assumed mythical qualities in the criminal world
after committing some unimaginable symbolic gesture.  The unseen Soze
sends Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), a chillingly cruel emissary, to
our quintet of bandits.  It is Kobayashi who inspires terror the
old-fashioned way:  with cold eyes and words far more powerful than
guns.  Postlethwaite freezes us in our seats with his performance.</P>
<P>     Chazz Palminteri puts his personal stamp on a good cop determined
to untangle the yarn, and the gifted Suzy Amis is on hand as the lawyer
who inspires in Keaton dreams of going straight, but hers is virtually
a non-speaking part.  This is a movie about bad guys doing bad things
with eccentricity and style.  How long has it been since you sat
frozen, watching a hatch lever turning in the belly of a ship, knowing
that the devil himself is on the other side?</P>
<P>     Director Bryan Singer has created the feel of a sophisticated 30s
mystery; Christopher McQuarrie delivers the dialogue in a great mix of
standard four-letter stuff and cerebral criminal thinking; each actor
in this first-rate cast makes his character memorable.  It's a hat
trick.</P>
<P>     From beginning to end, the story is overwhelmed by style.  This
is a time to forget the plot for once and concentrate on enjoying an
actors' field day with a good script.  Newton Thomas Sigel's
photography is wildly sophisticated and works with John Ottman's
ominous score as a real suspense builder.  You may well find delicious
pleasure in being thoroughly caught up in a movie you don't
understand.  Remember, nothing's perfect.</P>
