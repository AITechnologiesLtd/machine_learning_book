<P>  "American Beauty" (1999) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Kevin Spacey,
Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper and
Peter Gallagher. Directed by Sam Mendes</P>
<P> Lester Burnham is going through a midlife crisis. Correction. Lester
Burnham is a walking, breathing midlife crisis, a tragedy in waiting.</P>
<P> He hates his job, is distant from his wife and daughter, has no interests,
no friends, no passion. The highlight of his day is masturbating during his
morning shower.</P>
<P>  Lester is invisible. He gets no enjoyment out of life nor does he give any.</P>
<P> That all changes though when Lester sees Angela (Mena Suvari), his high
school daughter's best friend. Quicker than you can say Lolita, Lester has
found a purpose in life.</P>
<P> He decides to buff up, take stock in himself, become a new man, all to
impress a teeny-bopper.</P>
<P> Thus is the crux of "American Beauty," a disturbing, sad and funny look at
a dysfunctional family trying to fool itself into believing its a living a
normal American middle-class existence.</P>
<P> "American Beauty" is an actor's movie. Forget the plot and subplots, as
interesting as they are. What sticks here are the performances. Kevin
Spacey and Annette Bening are mesmerizing and daring as Lester and Carolyn
Burnham.</P>
<P> He's a burnt-out copy editor for a magazine, she's a gung-ho wannabe real
estate agent. They have as much in common as Jesse Helms and Chastity Bono.</P>
<P> They don't communicate, they bark, snarl and snap.</P>
<P> Spacey starts out shuffling around like a schlep. He doesn't walk, but
drags himself painfully through his daily existence. As his focus narrows
and his mind becomes more set on his courseof action, he becomes more
confident in tone and stride.</P>
<P> It is fascinating to watch this transformation. It is Academy
Award-caliber acting. It is imaginative and smart because through it all,
Spacey keeps in character. He makes it so casual, so matter-of-fact, that
you don't question his re-emergence into the land of the living.</P>
<P> Bening's Carolyn is a woman who refuses to be dragged down into the muck
of dispair that is sucking away her husband's soul.</P>
<P> She fights to remain the optimist, scrubbing and cleaning the property she
is trying to sell, then slapping herself out of discouragement after an
open house from hell.</P>
<P> Caught in the middle of it all is the Burnham's daughter, Jane (Thora
Birch), who can neither understand nor cope with either parent.</P>
<P> Birch also gives a compelling performance as a confused adolescent who
cannot grasp the vacuum between her parents. Like most teen-agers, she is
self-absorbed with her own wants and needs, repelling any attempts at
communication from either parent.</P>
<P> Doom hangs over the Burnham household like a smog over Los Angeles.</P>
<P> Yet for all its tragic undertones, "American Beauty" actually has you
laughing. But sometimes it's that embarrassed laughter, the one that comes
out when you see someone take a fall or walk around with his fly unzipped.</P>
<P> "American Beauty" is not a perfect film. Writer Alan Ball has created a
couple of quirky characters too many, especially Chris Cooper's Marine Col.
Fitts, a send-up stereotype that could have come from Kubrick's "Full Metal
Jacket." His character doesn't seem to fit and when he is on screen,
American Beauty goes a bit a-kilter.</P>
<P> Fitts' son, Ricky (Wes Bentley), first appears as a creepy peeping Tom,
secretly recording life in Burnham household, with special emphasis on Jane.</P>
<P> But Ricky, despite dealing drugs, turns out to be - normal is not the word
- but moral and decent.</P>
<P> Director Sam Mendes has done a masterful job with his cast. He has taken
extraordinary situations and what could have been over-the-top
characterizations and molded them into people you may not understand, but
could at least symphathize with.</P>
<P> "American Beauty" is an original, a tour-de-force exhibition of acting
missing from the movie screen so far this year.</P>
<P> When Academy Award nomination time rolls around, "American Beauty" is a
movie that will not - should not and cannot - be ignored.</P>
