<P>     I didn't expect GHOST IN THE MACHINE to be this bad.  Going in, I
was aware that it wasn't likely to make the Top 10 list, but I was
curious about how this hi-tech horror concept was going to be
implemented.  Never in my darkest nightmares did I imagine what was
waiting in ambush in that darkened theater.</P>
<P>     Karl Hoffman (Ted Marcoux), a.k.a. the "Address Book Killer," is
on the loose, slaughtering people in their homes, then driving
recklessly on rain-slicked roads.  One night after spending some time
butchering a few helpless victims, he decides to pass a car on a
two-lane highway.  Crossing over the double-yellow line, he veers into
the path of an oncoming eighteen-wheeler, and it's good-bye Mr. Serial
Killer.  Actually, he's not dead, and what's left of him arrives at the
hospital in the middle of a particularly violent electrical storm.  He
happens to be in the MRI chamber when lightning strikes a transformer.
Sparks are everywhere and, somehow, Karl ends up transformed into a
computer virus.  There, deep within his electronic domain, he plots
death and mayhem--beginning with a woman named Terry Munroe (Karen
Allen) and her thirteen-year old son Josh (Wil Horneff).  The only man
is his way is the valiant hacker hero Bram Walker (that's Walker, not
Stoker, played by Chris Mulkey).</P>
<P>     First of all, this is not an April Fools review.  I didn't make up
the above plot, although I admit it sounds far too stupid--even by
Hollywood's standards--to have made it to the screen.  Considering the
low (nonexistent?) quality of the final product, it's odd that Rachel
Talalay allowed her name to be attached to GHOST IN THE MACHINE.  Maybe
it's really an alias, although why she couldn't just use Alan Smithee,
like every other dissatisfied director, is beyond my understanding.  It
couldn't be that she's pleased with this movie, could it???  The mind
boggles at the possibility.</P>
<P>     Every year has its worst movie.  1992 had SPLIT SECOND.  Now 1993
has GHOST IN THE MACHINE.  Actually, they're a lot alike, at least
superficially.  Both are distinguished by utterly inane premises (SPLIT
SECOND offered Satan as a serial killer).  Both feature moronic
scripts, inept direction, and bland "performances."  If she ever wants
another job, Karen Allen will probably have to spend a lot of time
convincing people that it was really her evil twin sister in GHOST IN
THE MACHINE.</P>
<P>     Then there's the issue of technological accuracy.  The computer
virus/serial killer manages to migrate from PCs to microwave ovens via
power cables.  It does this sort of thing repeatedly, getting into
video cameras, hot air dryers in a men's room, a car radio, and a
dishwasher.  Unless there's been some amazing leap of data transfer
technology that I'm not aware of, viruses cannot be transmitted through
power lines.  Of course, since we're dealing with homicidal bit streams
here, the rules could have changed.</P>
<P>     Scientific considerations aside, GHOST IN THE MACHINE has problems
with issues of basic credibility.  For example, if fifteen police cars
arrived outside a quiet house in the middle of the night, and the
officers opened fire without provocation, isn't it reasonable to assume
that this might lead to some sort of incident, especially if an
innocent woman ends up in the hospital?  The last thing one would
expect is for the entire incident to be ignored, but that's exactly
what happens.  I guess when you're busy chasing a digital mass
murderer, you have more important things to worry about.</P>
<P>     At least there are some decent special effects to distract the
viewer's attention from the story, right?  Wrong.  The visual effects
aren't much better than those found in any typical video game system.
They're repetitive and unimaginative.</P>
<P>     Of course, someone could make the argument that GHOST IN THE
MACHINE is actually a cautionary tale warning of the dangers of giving
computers too much control.  The more humanity relies upon them, the
greater the danger of unleashing something that we neither understand
nor can control.  The producers would probably applaud this
interpretation.  Personally, I don't buy it.  As far as I'm concerned,
this is just a very, very, very bad motion picture.</P>
<P>     As the saying goes, if it walks like a turkey, looks like a
turkey, and gobbles like a turkey, then it must be a ....</P>
<P>     Wait a moment ...  Something's wrong.  I'm having trouble keying in
the rest of this review ...  How come this word processor isn't
functioning properly ...?  Why is the modem lit up like that?  What in
the ...  It's not as if my computer is hooked up with ...  This can't be
