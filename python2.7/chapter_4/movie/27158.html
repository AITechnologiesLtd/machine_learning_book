<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>I have mixed feelings about the new big-screen version of Dr Seuss' "How 
The Grinch Stole Christmas". Don't get me wrong -- it's a very funny, very 
entertaining movie, and kids and adults alike should enjoy it. No, my 
problem (such as it is) is that, if I had to associated one name with the 
film, it would not be Dr Seuss'. Undeniably, that name would be Jim 
Carrey's.</P>
<P>More so than any of his previous pictures, Carrey owns "The Grinch". All 
its wit, drama, energy is derived from him. When Carrey isn't on-screen, 
the movie loses much of its appeal; it feels like a symphony missing its 
brass and string sections, both at once. And this is a problem only 
inasmuch as it makes a liar out of the film's advertising: this is not Dr 
Seuss' "How The Grinch Stole Christmas", but rather the same story 
filtered through Carrey's singular sense of humour.</P>
<P>Carrey, of course, plays the Grinch -- a green, hairy creature who lives 
atop fang-like Mount Crumpit, in a home littered with the garbage of the 
Whos. The Whos live in Whoville, at the base of the mountain, and they are 
as unlike the Grinch as it is possible to be. Where the Grinch is mean and 
scornful, the Whos are happy and carefree. And no time is more full of 
jollity in Whoville than Christmastime. Christmas is part of every apsect 
of the Whos' lives. They decorate for it, sing songs about it, and most
importantly, they shop for it. Every Who loves Christmas.</P>
<P>Every Who, that is, except little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), who has 
begun to question just why all the presents and ornaments and parades are 
supposed to make her happy. When none of the other Whos understand her 
concerns, Cindy Lou seeks out the one person she thinks might feel the 
same way: the Grinch. But in doing so, Cindy Lou reawakens old memories in 
the Grinch, of childhood rejection by town beauty Martha May Whovier 
(Christine Baranski) and humiliation by Mayor May Who (Jeffrey Tambor). 
This inspires the Grinch's infamous plot to steal Christmas from Whoville.</P>
<P>If there's one element of the story that director Ron Howard managed to 
keep true to Dr Seuss' vision, it is its actual appearance. Dr Seuss books 
are famous for their slightly off-kilter visual style, and Howard and 
production designer Michael Corenblith have not departed too much from 
"The Grinch"'s Seussian origins. The Whos look like regular humans, just a 
little warped (they have strange hairstyles, big noses, and rosy cheeks). 
Whoville is not dissimilar from a regular town -- if that town's chief 
architect had been Rube Goldberg. Everything is a riot of colour and 
activity and Christmas.</P>
<P>Also well conceived is Carrey's Grinch costume. Not only does this hew 
very closely to the Dr Seuss original, it also permits Carrey an almost 
full range of movement and facial expressions. And, given the animation 
the actor puts into his role, this is of key importance. Had the decision 
been made simply to slap Carrey in a mask, for example, "The Grinch" would 
not be nearly so successful.</P>
<P>The Grinch may be for Jim Carrey what the Genie in "Aladdin" was for Robin 
Williams: the ultimate expression of the actor's comic strengths. Carrey 
has it all here -- a character who is at once caustic and sympathetic, who 
is unbridled in what antics he can indulge himself in. Carrey's humour 
ranges from the obvious to the sublime (when a Whoville taxi won't stop to 
pick him up, he facetiously wails, "It's because I'm GREEN, isn't it?"). 
Only occasionally does he resort to sophomoric gross-out comedy. There
are hints of several past Carrey characters in the Grinch -- definite 
helpings of Ace Ventura, for example, and the Hank persona from "Me, 
Myself & Irene" -- leading one to believe that this is the role Carrey's 
comedic career has been building up to.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, though, none of the other performers can hope to match up. 
Tambor in particular tries gamely, but his Mayor lacks much depth. As for 
Momsen, she does passably well in the film's second-most important role, 
but fails to make as strong an impression as she should. Cindy Lou is made 
out to be intelligent and individualistic, but Howard seems far too 
interested in just playing up her cuteness. Anthony Hopkins, meanwhile, 
makes a good successor to Boris Karloff as the Narrator. His precise, 
sonorous tones sweep the audience instantly into the tale.</P>
<P>The Dr Seuss book has, of course, been greatly expanded in order to turn 
it into a feature-length film. Amongst the more notable additions made by 
screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S Seaman are a series of flashbacks 
to the Grinch's own youth, providing motivation for the character's nasty 
ways. Intriguingly, this somewhat subverts the original Seuss story, 
moving it away from its obvious Dickensian roots. Instead of simply 
telling the tale of a mean man who discovers joy in the spirit of 
Christmas, "The Grinch" is now more about accepting people's differences 
(although the original moral has not been totally dismissed, either). 
Combined with its staunchly anti-commercial streak, the film feels both 
more relevant and more substantial as a result.</P>
<P>Although some have suggested that "The Grinch" is too dark and 
mean-spirited for children, I don't believe this is really the case. 
Parents of very sensitive children may find the film inappropriate, but in 
general, it is suitable for the entire family, with plenty to offer young 
and old. Those who are approaching the movie expecting it to simply be the 
book (or 1960s TV version) writ large may be caught off-guard by the 
pervasiveness of Carrey's influence. But Carrey fans, and Seuss 
afficiandos prepared to accept a mild departure from the source material,
should find "The Grinch" to be a hugely entertaining Christmas movie.</P>
<P>So go see "The Grinch", and just you wait and see:
Yes, even your heart might grow a size, or two, or three.</P>
