<PRE>THE MATRIX</PRE>
<PRE>A review by Jerry Saravia</PRE>
<P>Has there been a halfway decent science-fiction picture beyond the 
spectacular "Dark City" in the last ten years? The mind boggles. In one 
word: no. And the senseless, monotonous "The Matrix" will hardly qualify 
as anything but pure visual candy, yet the candy will rot rather than 
cleanse your cinematic spirits.</P>
<P>In an unsuccessful attempt to make us forget "Johnny Mnemonic," 
Keanu Reeves plays yet another emotionless, stone-faced cyber hacker 
nerd named Neo who sells illegal jack devices for virtual reality games. 
It turns out that Neo is living in a world that is a virtual reality 
game itself, an artificially created environment designed by aliens in 
Reservoir Dogs suits, otherwise known as The Matrix. The Matrix designed 
this world to learn about...human nature? What makes us tick? Who knows, 
yet a group of leather-jacketed freedom fighters with superhuman 
computer powers (and sunglasses) intend to fight the aliens and prevent 
more humans from being...programmed? They are Morpheus (Laurence 
Fishburne) and the attractive, interesting Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), 
along with the aptly named Cypher (bald-headed Joe Pantoliano). Later, 
it appears that Neo is in fact the Matrix...or so we would think. Yes, 
in typical sci-fi glory, the Matrix will restore the world to what it 
was before becoming a live-action computer game. </P>
<P>I admire directors like David Lynch who take us into Byzantine 
labyrinths - endless mazes with circular loops that ask us to make our 
own interpretations. But "The Matrix" is not that film. The movie simply 
has an idea - the Matrix - but no story or fleshed-out characters worth 
caring about. The idea simply sits there while we watch fantastic 
special-effects fill every inch of the screen. There are some beautiful 
slow-motion shots of guns firing and bullet casings grazing every inch 
of concrete on building rooftops - a keen reminder of John Woo's wild 
comic-book pyrotechnics. I also enjoyed watching the flips in the air 
and the frozen movements suddenly turning back into motion. If "The 
Matrix" were simply a financial ploy for an incredible, imaginative sci-
fi picture, I would have said that I loved it. But the movie is an 
exercise in pyrotechnics, nothing more.</P>
<P>Instead of some intelligent dialogue and imaginative story 
structure dealing with the mysteries of virtual reality and real life, 
the movie opts for straightforward action, predictable, formulaic 
thriller elements, and bland characters. Keanu Reeves can't even smile 
or wink, much less emote any expression (What happened to this actor?). 
Fishburne, one of the most distinctive actors on the silver screen, 
mostly stands around and utters epiphanies about the state of the world. 
The one actor who stands out is Carrie-Anne Moss, who turns from a full-
fledged kung-fu expert to a simple girlfriend for the seemingly 
indifferent Neo. What a sham!</P>
<P>"The Matrix" simply recycles elements from "Dark City," "Strange 
Days," and every other tired sci-fi thriller in the last year or so 
without investing any interest outside tentacled spider robots and kung-
fu fights. If this is the state of the genre now, what can we expect in 
a decade? </P>
