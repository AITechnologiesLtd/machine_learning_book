<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>The Opposite of Sex features a lot of loveless intercourse between
various people of various sexes.  It also features an array of crimes
and acts of violence, including murder, robbery, breaking and entering,
and battery.  I've seen most of this material before in many different
films, but it all feels fresh and original in this particular movie. 
That might be because writer/director Doug Roos has taken such an
intensely cynical angle on his material that even the narrator herself
knows how cliched all of this stuff could be.</P>
<P>Of course, it helps that Christina Ricci is the narrator.  Ricci is a
talented young actress, and there's not a woman out there whose voice
oozes more cynicism than hers.  In fact, she's so sarcastic so much of
the time that I wonder if she's capable of sincerity.  I don't think she
has yet had to play a role that forced her to show a normal set of
emotions, and The Opposite of Sex is no exception:  here, she plays
sixteen year-old DeDee, a girl who goes to destroy the life of her
half-brother just to score a few bucks, and maybe pick up a boyfriend
along the way.</P>
<P>The half-brother, Bill (Martin Donovan), is a gay high school English
teacher;  with him lives his boyfriend, the dumb-but-pretty Matt (Ivan
Sergei).  When DeDee comes to visit, she immediately destroys the
household -- she convinces Matt that he's not gay, and from that point
they regularly engage in sex.  She then informs Matt that she's
pregnant, and convinces him to run off with her and leave Bill.  Then,
Bill goes searching for them, and finds . . . wow, what a complicated
story this is.  I didn't think much about it as I was watching the film,
but Roos has written a series of events that best be described as
unpredictable.  </P>
<P>It's always entertaining to watch these events unfold, and the
entertainment value of the film is helped along nicely by DeDee's
mean-spirited narration.  She plays jokes on us, and points out the
obvious, and makes fun of us just when we're suppose to care about
what's happening.  The film is uproariously funny; perhaps the funniest
sequence is a series of shots in which we see Bill looking very
depressed after he finds that Matt has left him.  DeDee's voice soon
comes in, and then she tells us that it's silly for us to feel the way
we do, and that the scenes we're seeing are nothing but manipulation of
the audience.</P>
<P>I kind of felt that Roos did this just to cover up the fairly routine
story, but I resolved my worries knowing that it really doesn't matter. 
The story is interesting enough, and that he adds this kind of rare
humor and wit to the material is truly refreshing.  He even nears the
boundaries of film in a scene or two -- there's a scene towards the end
that turns out to be a joke, and while I'm not sure that this is within
the Rules of Cinema, I sure enjoyed watching it.  </P>
<P>But wit can only go so far without a little bit of emotional resonance,
and Roos easily manages that by giving us an assortment of interesting
and colorful characters.  Ricci is, as I said, terrific, and, as her
character points out, DeDee kind of grows on us by the end, even if she
is an acidic bitch.  Donovan is superb -- he layers his character with
verbal and physical subtleties, and is ultimately very convincing in the
role.  Sergei is adequate as the profoundly dumb boyfriend, while Johnny
Galecki has fun going over-the-top as Matt's secret boyfriend.  Most
interesting is Lisa Kudrow, who plays Lucia, a stiff friend of Bill's. 
Lucia is adamantly opposed to sex, but that's mostly because she's never
had it.  Kudrow is fascinating here, and paints a colorful portrait of
the most interesting character in the film.</P>
<P>But what is this film about?  Well, I think Roos has some interesting
things to say about the human need for sex.  I'm not going to pretend
that my hypotheses are even close to what he was thinking, but The
Opposite of Sex had me fascinated all through its running time, and then
beyond that.  It's rousing to watch a film that is both hilarious and
provocative at the same time; sadly, a good sense of humor and a good
sense of intelligence rarely go together in today's comedies.  So, my
final words to you are simple:  see The Opposite of Sex if you want a
little substance to back up the laughs.</P>
