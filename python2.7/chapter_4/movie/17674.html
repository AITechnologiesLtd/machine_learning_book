<PRE>Review:</PRE>
<P>This is a truly excellent film.  Everyone in the movie has a very good
showing, but for me Al Pacino's is most notable -- I tend to dislike his
characteristic repugnantly overblown performances, though they seem to
please most people.  That's why his role in this movie is so refreshing.
I read once that the director was "able to coax a subdued performance"
from him, and that is exactly what happened -- he is utterly believable
(not to mention touching) in this role as an aging gangster who has been
overlooked and underappreciated by his superiors.</P>
<P>Actually, "subdued" is a good word for the whole movie.  It's more of a
character study than anything else -- Donnie/Joe (Depp)'s relationships
with Lefty (Pacino) and Maggie (Heche), his wife, are the focus of the
film.  Though, as can be expected with a movie of this genre, there are
a few brief explosions of violence, they are perhaps less frequent and
appalling than those of "Casino" or "Goodfellas", two movies that I feel
are bettered by this film.</P>
<P>The basics of the plot are simple: Joe Pistone is an FBI agent posing as
a jeweller named Donnie Brasco.  He meets a mobster named Lefty Ruggiero,
who vouches for him and gains Donnie enterance to his crime family.
Through the course of the film, they form a strong relationship that
eventually threatens Joe's marriage as well as both of their lives.  Also
definitely worth noting: It's a true story, based on the book by Joe
Pistone.  I don't want to give away too much about the story -- I haven't
revealed anything that isn't printed on the back of the DVD.</P>
<P>I really think this movie is best experienced with little or no background.
I didn't know anything at all about it before I saw it, and I went in with
pretty low expectations (mostly        because I was afraid we were going to get
a Heat ("WhaddayaGOT?!") performance out of Pacino).  I had thought Depp's
performance might salvage the film, but really everyone in it is superb.</P>
<P>It's an excellent movie, and it really looks good, too.</P>
