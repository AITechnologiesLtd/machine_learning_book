<P>"Entrapment" boasts a top notch cast, an effective score, wonderful 
photography and a great deal of style. The caper film also has a plotline 
that stretches plausibility further and further until the final act, 
where it snaps entirely, leaving any link to reality fluttering in the 
breeze. Whether you exit the theater annoyed or amused will likely depend 
on your appreciation of Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Me, I like 
the charismatic duo enough to forgive the film's major failings in the 
logic department.</P>
<P>Reminiscent of the glossy romantic thrillers from the '60s, "Entrapment" 
centers around a heist of monumental proportion, one that can only be 
carried out on December 31, 1999. The story begins in New York, when a 
thief with no apparent fear of heights steals a Rembrandt by using high 
tech equipment to enter an upper floor of a high-rise from the outside. 
After insurance investigator Gin Baker (Zeta-Jones) convinces her boss, 
Hector Cruz (Will Patton) that legendary bandit Robert "Mac" MacDougal 
(Connery) is the man behind the crime, she sets off for London to find 
him.</P>
<P>Mac quickly turns the tables on the young woman, and the pair move to his 
castle in Scotland to sort matters out. Soon enough, they begin plotting 
the theft of an extremely rare Chinese mask from an English museum, but 
Gin has an even bigger job in mind. If Mac agrees, they will make a New 
Years Eve trip to Kuala Lumpur in the Far East, where they can take 
advantage of Y2K computer changeovers to funnel $8 billion from a bank 
headquarters in the Petronas Twin Towers, the tallest buildings in the 
world. What finer way to celebrate the Millennium than by pulling off the 
biggest robbery in history?</P>
<P>But is it a set-up and, if so, who is setting up whom? Questions of 
allegiance are pivotal to the convoluted plot of "Entrapment," along with 
outlandish schemes, outrageous coincidences and loads of technobabble. By 
the time the film reaches its fractured conclusion, primary characters 
pull off stunts that could only be accomplished by wizardry. The story is 
utterly preposterous, but this is an old-fashioned "star vehicle" where 
plots are incidental. What matters in a film like this is attitude and 
sex appeal, which "Entrapment" has in spades. Exotic locations, potent 
music and jazzy cinematography combine to make an engaging package, 
although, of course, the main attraction is the pairing of two movie 
stars; one a veteran aging like fine wine and the other a delicious 
offering of a more recent vintage.  </P>
<P>Catherine Zeta-Jones made a big impact in last year's "The Mask of Zorro" 
and she continues to dazzle here. Her eyes, focused and assured, burn 
with a fierce intelligence that makes her other physical assets all the 
more captivating. She is a strikingly beautiful woman who seems quite 
comfortable strutting her stuff. The camera caresses her form, 
particularly in a training sequence where she glides her magnificent 
fanny ever so smoothly under a faux laser beam. The shot doesn't feel the 
least bit sexist because Zeta-Jones is totally in command of the 
situation. Instead of being turned into an object, she comes off as 
choreographer of her own erotic ballet.</P>
<P>And then there's Sean Connery, one of the coolest men who ever lived. At 
nearly 70, the years of been kind to this cinematic treasure. Each new 
wrinkle adds more character to that great face, while his demeanor 
remains as assured as ever, with an added gruff edge underscoring the 
sense of danger so crucial to his appeal. Working with this alluring 
woman 40 years his junior, Connery's character strives to maintain a 
professional distance, while both romantic and paternal feelings do 
battle with his judgment. The script hands him cheesy lines like "Never 
trust a naked woman," but Connery handles them with aplomb. </P>
<P>Meanwhile, several other very good actors are given virtually nothing to 
do. Ving Rhames, one of the best talents in the business, makes do with a 
throwaway role that squanders his skills, Will Patton pops up to sputter 
occasionally, and Maury Chaykin spends his screen time plopped in the 
Buddha position, spewing threats in a fey voice while displaying his big 
belly and sagging breasts. Why? I have no idea.  </P>
<P>After three increasingly silly, but well-staged, action set pieces, the 
film builds to a climax at a train station where lead characters 
magically appear and disappear while law enforcement agents behave like 
Barney Fife after too many cups of hard cider. Somehow, the rampant 
stupidity in "Entrapment" actually enhances the film's goofball appeal. 
Add the charms of Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones and you've got 
112 snappy minutes of big, dumb Hollywood fun.</P>
