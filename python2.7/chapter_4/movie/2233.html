<P>     Bob Jones (Michael Keaton) is dying.  His kidney cancer has spread
to his lungs and the doctors are telling him that the best he can do is
enjoy the few months remaining to him.  With his wife Gail (Nicole
Kidman) four months pregnant, Bob's chances of living long enough to
see the birth of his only child are slim-to-none.  In a last-ditch
effort to find some shred of hope to cling to, Gail persuades her
husband to see a Chinese healer, Mr. Ho (Haing S. Ngor), whose
advice--to let go of all the pain and anger within--leads Bob to
explore his own past even as he makes video tapes of his last days for
his offspring.</P>
<P>     The commercials for MY LIFE make a big deal out of this as being
"from the creators of GHOST," and for good reason.  Much of the same
heartwrenching, occasionally cloying, sentiment is present here.  Those
who hate tear-jerkers should resolutely avoid this film; MY LIFE will
leave that crowd retching in the aisles.</P>
<P>     Actually, when the film tunes down the manipulation, it has some
genuinely moving and emotionally honest moments.  Ironically, the most
"real" scenes are those of Bob videotaping himself.  His confessions,
reflections, and comments seem far more genuine than any of the
numerous melodramatic scenes that have Bob actively confronting the
realities of life and death.  MY LIFE lays it on thick in the drawn-out
final fifteen minutes, and this hamstrings the project somewhat (you
could hear a lot of nose-blowing in the darkened confines of the
theater).  Not that this is a surprise; fifteen minutes into the movie,
it's pretty obvious how it's going to end.</P>
<P>     Overall, the scenes that work outnumber those that fail, and
that's reason enough for a die-hard cynic like myself to admit
grudgingly to having liked MY LIFE.  There's enough intelligent stuff
contained herein to keep most viewers from dwelling on the maudlin
shortcomings.  This is no UNTAMED HEART, with an impossible-to-accept
premise and cringingly bad overacting; MY LIFE may have obvious
intentions, but at least it's skillful in presenting them.</P>
<P>     Michael Keaton does a fine job as Bob Jones, and it may be the
quality of his performance that makes much of MY LIFE work.  Certainly,
even his most ridiculous scenes (such as where he storms into his
doctor's office and informs him:  "You can't take away my hope!  It's
all I have left!") aren't too painful to sit through.  Nicole Kidman's
success is more sporadic.  Coupled with finely-acted moments when it's
possible to feel Gail's grief, there are times when Ms. Kidman doesn't
bring enough substance to her character.  This may be as much (or more)
the fault of the writing as that of the actress, though, since it's
hard to be consistently sincere uttering the occasional dumb line.</P>
<P>     Haing S. Ngor is so good that the scenes featuring Chinese
mysticism seem less foolish than they might otherwise.  This is
important, since much of MY LIFE's skeleton is formed from these
sessions and what comes out of them.</P>
<P>     It's difficult to predict how tear-jerkers will perform at the box
office since this, more than any other class of motion picture, brings
out the public's fickle nature.  MY LIFE isn't a Russian tragedy, so
there's exhilaration amidst the heartbreak, and the gallows humor
manages to avoid being tasteless.  Those who go to this film expecting
to like it probably will, and those who don't, won't.  Few will be
apathetic, however.</P>
<P>     MY LIFE is good schmaltz--decent entertainment that has no qualms
about mucking around with the audience's emotions (thus making it a
prime "date movie").  In addition to being far too blatant about its
motives and having a plot that offers almost no surprises, the movie
suffers from an unfortunate case of "cuteness".  Stone-hearted
movie-goers beware--many of you will loathe this film, and those that
don't will probably have a hard time justifying how you could actually
like it.</P>
