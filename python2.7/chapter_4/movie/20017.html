<PRE>THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999)
A Film Review by Ivana Redwine
Copyright 1999 Ivana Redwine</PRE>
<P>After being a little bit seduced by the advance buzz for the
low-budget Sundance indie "The Blair Witch Project," I entered the
theater expecting to see one of the scariest movies ever made.
And I did experience moments of sheer terror--especially toward
the film's end--but overall it isn't all that scary, although
it is extremely unsettling. To my mind, this movie doesn't fit
neatly into the horror genre category--it's more of a
psychological thriller. What affected me even more intensely
than the undercurrent of horror in the film was the tension that
continued to build slowly throughout, culminating when the
pressures of being hopelessly lost in the woods (and possibly
hunted) cause the sanity of the characters to slowly start to
snap. In some ways, I found "The Blair Witch Project" reminiscent
of the 1972 adventure/thriller "Deliverance," although that film
is stylistically quite different.</P>
<P>Employing a cinema verite style, "The Blair Witch Project" tells
the tale of a three-person student film crew that went out to
the woods near Burkittsville (formerly Blair), Maryland, in
1994 to make a documentary about the legend of a local witch.
The film opens with stark letters on a black background,
stating that their footage was found a year after their
disappearance and comprises what we are about to see.</P>
<P>At the beginning, the students laugh and joke in an easy,
relaxed manner. But as things go fatally wrong during the
creation of their documentary, their mental and physical
condition progressively erodes, causing them to become brittle
and start to turn on each other. The gradual deterioration of
the film crew's state of mind is heartbreaking. Particularly
devastating is the degeneration of the documentary's plucky
director. Finally realizing that they will probably not get
out alive, she films an apology to her own parents and those
of the crew in the movie's most memorable scene.</P>
<P>Adding to the realistic nature of "The Blair Witch Project,"
Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick, who co-wrote and co-
directed the film, make extensive use of improvisation in
collaboration with their actors, resulting in scenes that
seem natural and uncontrived. The first names of the
characters are the same as those of the actors who portray
them. Heather (Heather Donahue) is the documentary's director;
Michael (Michael Williams) the sound man, and Joshua (Joshua
Leonard) the cameraman. The acting is so convincing that at
times I had to remind myself that this was fiction rather
than fact and that these were actors rather than the
characters they portrayed. I found this reminiscent of the
films of John Cassavetes--one of the pioneers of independent
filmmaking--who also made extensive use of improvisation.</P>
<P>>From its uncomplicated premise to its stark visual style, much
of the film's impact stems from its simplicity, and this is
particularly true of the film's stunning cinematography. While
emulating the look and feel of a student documentary
production, it also manages to slyly conceal a slow-release
emotional wallop cleverly hidden in its seemingly naive
delivery. The vertiginous, jerky hand-held camera work, along
with the constant intermixing of film stock--much of it grainy
and often shot from disorienting, oblique angles--create a
dizzying visual edge. This cleverly complements the mood of
uncertainty, bewilderment, dread, and ever-encroaching doom
that permeates the movie.</P>
<P>In "The Blair Witch Project," imagination is the ultimate
special effect. One of the most daring aspects of the camera
work is that it sometimes drops down to velvet black; there
is nothing to be seen, except for what exists in the
audience's imagination. These moments of absolute darkness are
extremely disturbing because your mind wraps itself around the
ambiguity, conjuring the rest out of whatever happens to lurk
in your subconscious.</P>
<P>I think "The Blair Witch Project" is well worth seeing, although
it probably won't meet most people's expectations of what a
horror film should be. Despite a meager budget, Sanchez and
Myrick have created a remarkably original, vividly realistic
movie that reaches down deep into the personal and
psychological aspects of fear. It's a film that shows what
can happen when talented independent filmmakers follow their
creative vision without compromise.</P>
