<P>The pitch: "It'll be like _The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas_ meets 
_The_Muppets_Take_Manhattan_!"</P>
<P>        When Tim Burton's _The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas_ was released, 
critics raved and gushed, loving the wonderful music by Danny Elfman, the 
ingenious story by Tim Burton, and the intriguing, dark, visually 
stunning stop-motion of Henry Selick. It was compared with _The_Cabinet_ 
_of_Dr._Caligari_, _The_Wizard_of_Oz_, and other fantastic classics of the 
screen. Recent re-viewings certainly show that the film is holding up 
under this pressure, and is one of those films that so captures a wide 
audience's imagination that it is an "instant classic." (Disney writes 
this under the titles of all its animated features; it has not quite been 
true since _Aladdin_.)
        The point of this introduction is to dispel any notion among 
those who are interested in seeing _James_and_the_Giant_Peach_ that it is 
another wonderful concoction in which Elfman, Burton, and Selick put 
their heads together to create a modern classic. This is not to 
denigrate the film at all. But if anyone is expecting a film remotely 
similar to some idea of _Tim_Burton's_The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas_Part_ 
_II:_The_Revenge_, there is a large disappointment waiting at the theater.
        Some have referred to the film congratulating Burton on his dark, 
startling imagery, commenting on his trademark techniques and story 
features, and his unique vision. But with _James_, as with the horrendous 
summer disaster _Batman_Forever_, any credit or blame that is assignable to 
Burton is as a producer, not a director or creative consultant. The 
vision, the story, the style--all belong to Henry Selick, and he is due 
all the credit for the success of _James_.
        As you can probably tell from the title, if you have not already 
read the ubiquitous Roald Dahl book upon which this film is based, it is 
the story of a young boy, James Henry Trotter (Paul Terry), and his 
adventures with a giant peach. If you don't want more of a basic plot 
set-up than that, you should probably skip the next paragraph.
        James is trapped in a horrible life with his aunts Spiker (Joanna 
Lumley of the BBC's fabulous _Absolutely_Fabulous_ and former Bond girl) 
and Sponge (Miriam Margolyes) when he is approached by "The Old Man" 
(Pete Postlethwaite), who offers him a sack of magic squirmy things 
which, he promises, will change everything. James drops the sack, 
however, and the squirmy things work their magic on a bunch of garden 
bugs and a peach tree, which produces a giant-sized peach. Magically, 
James is transformed into a stop-motion character and enters the peach to 
find the giant-sized bugs, who become his fast friends by the time the 
peach rolls down the hill and their journey begins.
        Okay, no more spoilers, you can read on now. Excellent 
performances are given by nearly everyone in the film, though the 
live-action parts are the weakest and much of that is due to Lumley and 
Margolyes as the evil aunts. Paul Terry is a good actor, though, and he 
rescues the end of the movie with sheer enthusiasm. During the 
stop-motion middle of the film, the voices of the characters are provided 
by Susan Sarandon as Miss Spider, Simon Callow as Old Green Grasshopper, 
_Frasier_'s Glynis Johns as the Ladybug, David Thewlis as Earthworm, 
Richard Dreyfuss as Caterpillar and Margolyes as Glowworm. Sarandon, 
especially, adds a mystery and menace remarkable for a completely vocal 
performance. Dreyfuss is largely wasted. His awkward, loud Brooklyn 
accent could have been done better by any number of actors and come off 
as less annoying.
        There is the sense, as well, that this is a very abridged, 
musicalized version of Dahl's book, and this is true. It means that much 
of the delightful conversation from the book is cut, minimizing the 
characterization of the bugs and so a lot of the emotional impact. It's 
not a fatal flaw, but it is a flaw. Also, there is a storytelling 
incompleteness: there should probably have been one more big stop-motion 
adventure episode to "round out" the structure. If you have not read the 
book, you should probably see the film first and then appreciate how much 
richer the book is. If you have read the book, do not hold the movie to 
the book's strictures.
        But what really stuns about _James_ are the visuals. The landscape 
is totally believable during the stop-motion segments (the live-action 
sets are less so). Combining computer animation, blue-screen effects, 
stop-motion, and live-action, _James_ is sometimes blindingly 
good-looking. Where it falls down is in trying to make the live-action 
setting recall the stop-motion setting. Selick solves this problem by 
ignoring it, to the detriment of the film.
        _James_ ultimately is a success, but for reasons much different 
than those which made _Nightmare_ a success. While it is true that _James_ 
is much darker than the usual children's movie, it is nowhere near the 
dark vision of _Nightmare_. This film also succeeds largely in spite of 
its music, while _Nightmare_ was decidedly a musical. In the end, the two 
films are so dissimilar that too much comparison is pointless. This film 
is Selick's vision while _Nightmare_ was clearly Burton's.
        A couple of things to look for: one character from _The_Nightmare_ 
_Before_Christmas_ does briefly return, but it is not nearly as cheesy as 
that little sentence makes it sound. And stay after the credits: it's 
not hard since Randy Newman's catchiest tune of the movie, "Good News," 
is playing, and there is a short live-action bit at the end of the movie 
which, though not brilliant, is worth staying for since the ticket has 
already been bought.</P>
