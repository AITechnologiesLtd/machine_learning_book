<P>In the shadow of "The X-Men", this film promises the good old
fashioned action with a more believable action hero.When it comes to a
character who can hold the audience's attention by the sheer power of
his presence, Shaft's your man. What's most important is that "Shaft"
doesn't resort to imaginative special effects in order to create a
super hero, but the true human elements that are necessary for such a
task. For those of you who hasn't seen the original (and in my opinion
a rather overrated) version that aired in 1971, here is the story:</P>
<P>Shaft is the NYPD detective in charge of the investigation of a race
killing. One night outside of an upscale nightclub, a pampered yuppie
named Walter Wade (Christian Bale) bludgeons a black man to
death. There is one witness, a waitress named Diane (Toni Collette),
and Wade warns her to keep her mouth shut... or else. Shaft makes the
arrest, but the well-connected Wade is back on the streets in short
order. It doesn't take long for him to jump bail and leave the
country. Two years later, when he tries to sneak back in, Shaft is
waiting. Meanwhile, the detective has been harassing a local drug
dealer, Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright). Wade and Peoples meet in
prison and thus begins an uneasy alliance to bring down Shaft.</P>
<P>What is true is that the theme from the original movie, which
concerned racism and injustice in America, is virtually lost here,
remaining nothing more than a good excuse to make a fun action
film. Of course director John Singleton has included the obligatory
elements of black exploitation (big cars, drugs, cigars, guns, sleazy
nightclubs, gold chains, racism, babes, black leather coats, expensive
booze, crooked white cops), but the problem is that all that is
nothing more than props -- elements of the set decoration. Most
importantly, however, "Shaft" delivers on it's promise of action, and
plenty of it, and with the added benefit of having story enough to
support it. Though the action sequences are not even nearly as great
as in Mission: Impossible 2, they do provide a certain tension and
suspense, though often descending to the kind of brainless, tiring
action such as in "Gone in 60 Seconds". What is truly amazing is
surprisingly the performances, especially by the three leads: Samuel
Jackson, Christian Bale and Tony Colette. Unlike Wesley Snipes'
ultra-cool vampire slayer in "Blade", Jackson has the physical as well
as mental capabilities of being an action hero. Basically carrying the
film on his shoulders, he presents enough of power, wit and strength
to knock out both James Bond and Ethan Hunt out of their
pedestals. However, the supporting cast is not far behind. Christian
Bale puts on a spectacular performance, though his screen time is
scarcely limited. Still not quite finished with Patrick Bateman from
"American Psycho", he breathes life into a rather stereotypical and
one-dimentional role. The third and probably one of the most amusing
performances of the season, comes from Wright, who speaks with a
Dominican accent so lushly indulgent it makes Al Pacino's Cuban
cottonmouth in ''Scarface'' sound like a George Plimpton
impersonation. What happens is that Wright takes a cliché -- the
hotheaded Latin street prince -- and pushes it into operatic satire.</P>
<P>Shaft pushes our buttons at least as well as some of the Dirty Harry
movies, which means it's something that has been next to unheard-of
this year: reasonably rousing screen entertainment, but doesn't always
succeed. Whatever the reason, the film is badly-focused and comes to a
rather dissatisfying conclusion. Succeeding basically everywhere else,
Singleton fails where others have not, by violating one of the key
tenets of this sort of motion picture - that the hero should always
confront (and subsequently defeat) the villain. This results in that
"Shaft" fails to provide the violent catharsis that everyone in the
audience is awaiting.</P>
<P>Though Entertainment Weekly called ''Shaft'' a "spicy fast food", I
think that it is simply a series of slickly filmed action sequences
dangling off a thin plot and held together by the force of Jackson's
charisma.</P>
