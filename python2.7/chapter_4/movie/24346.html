<PRE>Fight Club (1999)
* *
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 2000 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>Few movies in 1999 polarized audiences like "Fight Club", which showed Gen-X
men beating on each other as a way of attempting to reclaim their
masculinity, or something.  Three camps seem to have sprung up around the
film: hose who love it, those who hate it, and those who find the other two
camps wasting their time with a red herring.  I'm in the third camp.</P>
<P>"Fight Club", at the very least, opens brilliantly, with an unnamed narrator
(Edward Norton) going stir crazy in a homogenized job.  The film gets a lot
of good mileage out of Norton's disgust with his brand-name existence; I was
reminded of Willy Loman ranting, "How can they whip cheese?".  In this film,
Norton paces through his apartment, obssing over housewares catalogues,
while his Ikea-bought furniture all handily display closed-captioned
pricetags and manufacturer's descriptions.</P>
<P>Norton is an insomniac, and winds up going to terminal-disease support
groups as a coping mechanism.  For what, we may ask?  For the fact that his
life is terminally pallid?  How bad can his life be when there are people
dying of brain cancer?  That's the way he thinks about it, anyway, and for a
while it works, until he meets another faker, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham
Carter).  Marla and the Norton character wind up involved in a tempestuous
relationship, which in this movie is a little like saying the Eiffel Tower
is tall and pointy.</P>
<P>Things get complicated further by the presence of the handsome and engimatic
soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), whom Norton meets on one of his
unending business trips.  Durden seems to have a knack for telling people
what they've always wanted to hear but could never find anyone else to say.
This is exactly what Norton thinks he needs, and when he comes back one day
to find his apartment blown up, he shacks up with Durden in a house that
could only remain standing in the movies and starts plowing through his back
copies of "Reader's Digest".</P>
<P>So far the film has been funny and knowing, and made with great skill.  Then
it takes a left turn that sends everything barrelling over the cliff.
Durden, as it turns out, is the mastermind of an underground boxing circle
known as Fight Club, where the male disenfranchised can come and feel like
gods while beating the tar out of each other.  The logic of this will be
lost on anyone who has actually been in a fistfight, of course, but the
movie is not about logic.  "Fight Club" has the peculiar, subterranean
arrogance of a precocious writer's first draft, where screwy little details
are defended to death over massive plot holes.</P>
<P>Before long Fight Club is running completely out of control, and Durden and
Norton are at each other's throats when they're not raiding liposuction
clinics for human fat.  The parallels with the Nazis are of course not going
to be lost on a knowing audience, but by the time we get to such things,
they no longer matter.</P>
<P>I suspect "Fight Club" worked better on paper, because what's on film veers
between the nauseating and the ridiculous.  It's one thing to write about
how great it felt to smash your fists into the concrete over and over again,
and quite another to actually SEE it.  Film has a way of literalizing
everything, even things that are designed to be fanciful, and perhaps this
story (from a novel by Chuck Palahniuk) just didn't survive the translation
intact.</P>
<P>People will say (and have said) that the film is actually "about the nature
of violence", but that is approximately as honest as saying that "ID4" was
"about" the value of raising funding for SETI.  The movie isn't genuinely
smart enough to be ABOUT that stuff -- it uses Tyler Durden and his
nihilistic burpings as an excuse to show things that are by turns shocking,
funny, outrageous, repellent, stupid, and then finally just tiresome.  By
the time we get to the "about" part, the movie's already betrayed itself,
and smirks at us with its trick third act that doesn't even really explain
anything.  What's worse, a movie that deals ineptly with a good subject, or
one which uses flashy plot mechanisms to tapdance around really dealing with
it at all?</P>
<P>The problem isn't with David ("Seven") Fincher's extraordinary direction or
the above-average performances by the cast.  Let's face it, there are good
people at work here: Norton's splendid; Pitt is funny when not being jerked
around by the plot; Carter is unexpectedly brassy and scene-stealing.  Her
weirdo monologues could have been torn out and used as the centerpiece for
another, better movie all by themselves.</P>
<P>I wanted to like "Fight Club", or at least appreciate its sardonic flashes
of wit, but I could not.  It's a cold, crass joke at the expense of its
audience; a two-and-a-half-hour red herring that winds up being nothing at
all by pretending to be about a lot of things it doesn't really understand.</P>
