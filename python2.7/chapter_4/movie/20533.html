<P>Sharp, witty and charming, God Said Ha! is a pleasure to watch. The film 
strikes a particularly refreshing cord with its down-to-earth, realistic 
subject matter: A woman who finds herself in the prime of her life, then 
encounters a change so awful, so upsetting, and so unfair; that she discovers 
humor beneath all the misery that surrounds her.  </P>
<P>Julia Sweeney is 30-something years old, recently divorced, and ready to 
leave New York City. She saves up some cash, buys herself the ultimate 
bachelor-pad outside of Los Angeles, and prepares for the first day of the 
rest of her life. Just when she thinks that nothing could get in her way, 
everything does.</P>
<P>Julia's brother becomes ill with cancer and soon requires constant attention. 
Not only does he move in with her, but both her parents do as well. She finds 
herself sneaking around like a teenager, returning to the ways of her 
childhood. (Like having to say "Noodles with the red topping" since "Pasta 
with marinara sauce" is too formal.)</P>
<P>The film is based on a play written by Sweeney, which had a successful run on 
the west coast. She is the only person on stage, except for a brief 
appearance by Quentin Tarantino at the end. There is no real set other than a 
few scattered pieces of furniture. </P>
<P>It would be a misconception to assume that since Sweeney is a Saturday Night 
Live alumni, and did appear in two rather unfortunate SNL films (It's Pat and 
Stuart Saves his Family), that this movie is of a like  nature. She seems to 
have fully shed all the mediocre aspects of Lorne Michael's films, and found 
her own style. Not only do all the jokes work well, but the cheesy and often 
embarrassing aspects of  the aforementioned titles are absent. </P>
<P>God Said Ha! is a wonderful movie. Whether it be the jokes about disappearing 
ovaries, or the touching stories of a terminally ill man; this film is well 
worth a look.          </P>
