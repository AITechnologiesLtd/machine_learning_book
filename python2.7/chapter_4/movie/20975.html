<P>When we think stadium rock the kneejerk association is the decadent
hairbands of the 80's. But there was a time when it was more pure. Or, less
pure, but in a more original way. The time is 1978. The band is KISS. The
place is director Adam Rifkin's Detroit Rock City, temporary mecca for
MyStery, a KISS-tribute band made up of Jam (Sam Huntington), Hawk (Edward
Furlong), Trip (James DeBello), and Lex (Giuseppe Andrews), skipping school
and driving in from Cleveland on borrowed wheels and stolen time. Just four
guys on what for them is a pilgrimage, with all the necessary pitfalls,
pratfalls, obstacles, etc to make it interesting. To make it seem like they
won't make it, that this will be 'that' kind of coming-of-age movie.
Refreshingly, it's not that kind of movie.
Instead, it's the kind of movie with a soundtrack, maybe the best since
Robert Alt's Dazed and Confused. And yes, Detroit Rock City toys with some
of the same torch-passing type of generational material as Dazed and
Confused, but in a significantly less introspective manner than Alt. Which
gives it the freedom to go overboard, to have an overweight Elvis security
guard chase this KISS-tribute band into the future, a little retrospective
allegory we can all appreciate via dramatic irony: we know how the music
wars went. We know that KISS is in facepaint again and nobody has Saturday
Night Fever anymore.
All the same though, Detroit Rock City isn't just a movie for the faithful.
Instead of writing it for the heavy metal equivalent of the snickering
in-group Star Trek: Insurrection appealed to--and thus relying solely on the
nostalgic appeal of a mythic KISS concert to propel things--writer Carl V.
Dupre chose instead to make the concert's importance proportional with the
obstacles MyStery has to deal with to get to that concert. And, as they're
big issues, especially for Jam, having to deal with his MATMOK (Mothers
Against The Music Of Kiss) mother, the concert is important, even pivotal.
In case this isn't enough, though, Dupre also has a back-up structure: this
is Jam's last night of freedom before two years of boarding school. Which is
to say tonight they're going to let it all hang out, even dancing at a male
strip club for ticket money.
Which is where Shannon Tweed has her big cameo, playing Sylvia again from
Hot Dog, coolly oblivious to the 15 years between then and now, but still in
full possession of the camera. And then of course there's Paul and Gene and
Ace and Peter, playing themselves on stage, still breathing fire and
spitting blood. There's even a strange little shot of the audience from the
POV of Gene Simmons' throat, down along his legendary cow-tongue, which is
perhaps the one moment when the Detroit Rock City goes a little far. As for
the rest of it, though, just be satisfied that it's not Phantom in the Park.
It's 1999 now. Suddenly the devil's music is in DTS.
