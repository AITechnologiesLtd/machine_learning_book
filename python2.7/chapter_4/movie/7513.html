<PRE>                               THE SHINING
                       A film review by Dan Chodos
                        Copyright 1997 Dan Chodos</PRE>
<P>Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's Shining works on some
levels, and fails on others. A family is left to take care of a
Colorado hotel for the winter. They will be completely isolated, having
only each other and the knowledge that some years ago, another
caretaker killed his family due to 'cabin fever'. Yup, you guessed it,
Jack comes down with a case of Cabin Fever and tries to murder his
family. Luckily, his isolated son has something called the 'Shining', a
sort of ESP where he can communicate and see into the future. The
premise is great, but with in a space of 10 minutes Jack completely
flips out, and we never uncover the mystery as to why. Soon afterwards
the premise is nearly a means for Jack Nicholson to go from scene to
scene shouting out catchy (and sometimes funny) phrases in a murderous
rage. The setup is never developed masking the last hour as a handful
of brilliantly directed and acted scenes that together don't add up to
much. Nicholson and Kubrick make the film scary enough to keep our
interest for the moment, but when its over you can't help feeling a
little dissapointed.  Where did the ghosts come from?  Sure we can
speculate, but what fun is that Jack?</P>
