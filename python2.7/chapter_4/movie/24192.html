<P>Due to the economic crisis in Thailand, Tum, a 25 year old secretary, is
dismissed from her work. Without money, she thought of suicide, but the newt
day she found a box containing a lot of money on her doorstep. As it turned
out, the money was used in a match making for the nights boxing match, and
due to a mix up, the money was landed on her doorstep. Soon, everybody,
including crooks, cops and neighbours alike, are at her house trying to get
back the money, and everybody are literally falling dead in Tums house
6ixtynin9 is one hell of a commercial film. From the opening sequence to the
very conventional ending, the film plays out like a Hollywood blockbuster.
6ixtynin9 is also very similar to a British film known as Thursday, where
the main character in that film life is thrown into turmoil when his old
friend gave him a suitcase of money. Like the protagonist in Thursday, Tum
was thrown in a strange chain of events that will react like a nuclear
reaction, with her as a catalyst.
This film also pokes fun at modern problems of Thailand. From match making
to the economic crisis which affected the society today. But do not watch
this if you are looking to identify the problems in this show; watch it only
if you want to be entertained.</P>
<P>6ixtynin9 was shown on 01th April 2000 at the 13th Singapore International
Film Festival.</P>
<PRE>Rated: ***1/2 /5</PRE>

****-Prepared to be blown away
*****-A Classic piece.</PRE>
