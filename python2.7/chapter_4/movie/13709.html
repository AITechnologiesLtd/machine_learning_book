<PRE>_Ever_After_ (PG-13) ***
_Halloween:_H20--20_Years_Later_ (R) ***</PRE>
<P>Say what you will about its banality or the inherent ridiculousness of its
messengers, but the Spice Girls' mantra of "Girl Power" seems to have made
a profound effect in Hollywood.  For proof, look no further than two wildly
different films opening within less than a week between them: _Ever_After_
and _Halloween:_H20--20_Years_Later_, which put effective feminist spins on
the normally weak icons of Cinderella and the slasher film scream queen,
respectively.</P>
<P>Drew Barrymore's Danielle, the heroine of _Ever_After_, has more than a
little in common with the Cinderella of fairy tale lore.  After the death
of her father (Jeroen Krabbé), Danielle (nicknamed "Cinderella") is treated
as a lowly servant girl by her wicked stepmother Rodmilla (Anjelica Huston,
wonderfully bitchy).  There are two stepsisters, Marguerite (Megan Dodds)
and Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey, Kate Winslet's best friend/lover/partner
in crime in _Heavenly_Creatures_); there is a prince, by the name of Henry
(Dougray Scott); and there is a lavish ball and even a slipper left behind.</P>
<P>But it is there that the similiarities end and something quite radical
begins.  For one thing, there is no magic at all in _Ever_After_--no
pumpkin carriage, rat horses, not even a fairy godmother, though Danielle
has a helper in no less than Leonardo daVinci (Patrick Godfrey).  The
absence of the fantastic has an empowering and liberating effect on the
heroine, who in other Cinderella tales is rather passive and weak.
Danielle is far from that, strong in will and body (in one scene, she
literally _carries_ the prince) and in total command of her destiny.  The
prince is nice and strong himself, but she can rescue herself, thank you
very much (Danielle could very well be nicknamed "Cinder Spice").  Female
empowerment also manifests itself in _Ever_After_'s sense of sisterhood, a
quality that is missing from other versions of the story.  Only Marguerite
qualifies as a wicked stepsister; the zaftig Jacqueline is every bit
Rodmilla's victim as well, and she is constantly belittled by her mother
because of her size.  As such, Danielle and Jacqueline recognize themselves
as kindred spirits.</P>
<P>This revisionism performed by director Andy Tennant and screenwriters
Susannah Grant and Rick Parks is not without a few missteps.  There is an
awkward, completely superfluous framing story, where a mysterious older
woman (Jeanne Moreau) tells the story to the Grimm Brothers; and a subplot
involving a sleazy nobleman (Richard O'Brien) with a jones for Danielle is
poorly developed.  But the freshness of the entire affair and the
exuberance of its execution, bolstered by sweet chemistry between Barrymore
and Scott, goes a long way in charming the viewer.</P>
<P>Perhaps the most indelible image of John Carpenter's seminal 1978 chiller
_Halloween_ was that of 17-year-old babysitter Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee
Curtis) cowering in the corner of a crudely locked closet while "the
Bogeyman," a.k.a. Michael Myers, stabbed his ways through the doors.  Flash
forward twenty years, and to the clunkily titled
_Halloween:_H20--20_Years_Later_ (why not just
_Halloween:_20_Years_Later_?).  The most memorable sight?  The same but
older Laurie, brandishing an ax, openly inviting--or, rather, _daring_--her
unseen tormentor to show his white-masked face with the piercing wail of
"MICHAEL!"  Yes, cinema's most famous scream queen is back, louder than
ever, but now infused with a strong dose of Girl--make that _Grrrl_--Power.</P>
<P>This entertaining seventh installment of the series glazes over the events
of installments 4-6 (the third film was completely unrelated) and takes a
sharp focus on the first two, namely the character and history of Laurie.
Since last seen learning that Michael is her brother in _Halloween_II_ and
witnessing his apparent demise (apparently she didn't hear of his exploits
depicted in 4-6), Laurie faked her death and moved from Illinois to
California as Keri Tate.  Now a divorced single mom of 17-year-old John
(Josh Hartnett), Laurie/Keri is the head mistress of a posh private school.
 But she is still haunted by the memory of her murderous brother, who, of
course, locates his long-lost sister and decides to pay her a visit on
Halloween night, 1998--twenty years to the night he first terrorized her.</P>
<P>The basic story and script of _H20_, credited to Robert Zappia and Matt
Greenberg (working from a treatment by _Scream_ wunderkind Kevin
Williamson), doesn't hold up to much scrutiny.  Michael bumps off a couple
of the libidinous teens at the school as well as a handful of others who
get in the way.  Laurie finds out he's back and is forced to face her
demons (or, rather, demon).  That's it.  But, then again, the basic story
of Carpenter's original didn't exactly hold up under close examination,
either.  What's important is the effectiveness of the shock and scare
scenes, and while director Steve Miner doesn't take the high road that
Carpenter took in _Halloween_ (that is, keep blood and gore to a surprising
minimum), he pulls off more than a few nailbiters, most notably the
extended climactic chases between Laurie and Michael.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of the thrilling final act, and the film as a whole,
owes a huge debt to Curtis and the character of Laurie.  Though her
stress-related alcoholism and pill-popping are never satisfactorily
resolved, Laurie undergoes a nice character arc in reference to her
previous two films.  It is highly believable that she would no longer be
scared of Michael so much as angry and, thus, out for blood herself; it
would have been less convincing if, after all this time, she was still the
girl who cowered in the closet.  Although the _Scream_ films' Sydney
Prescott is a rather proactive horror heroine, the new Laurie is a step
beyond that.  The seemingly indestructable Michael may want to kill her,
but that is nothing compared to her desire to kill _him_ and free herself
from the past, making for an intriguing pas de deux where the two often
trade the roles of stalker and stalkee.</P>
<P>_Halloween:_H20_'s Laurie Strode may not be given the fairy tale fate met
by Danielle in _Ever_After_, which is just the first in an endless list of
differences.  But one, strong trait unifies them: they use their wits and
will to escape and triumph over their victimizers and take control of their
lives.  Whatever the time, whatever the place, female empowerment makes the
same sound--a blistering roar.</P>
