<P>PLOT:
Something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted house and playing 
out parodies of other horror and non-horror movies. Oh yeah, there's 
also something about a ghost possessing the mansion and shit, but trust 
me, you won't care much about the "plot" in this film...</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Parody movies either work or they don't and this one just doesn't work! 
The laughs aren't as pronounced this time around, the energy level, the 
gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions 
here. It's like they were all in a hurry to finish the film or something 
(wink, wink). And the scariest part of it all? Check out the number of 
screenwriters it took to pen this puppy: seven! I say again, it took 
seven people to write 82-minutes worth of fart jokes, half-assed stunts 
and spoofs of films other than horror. Now I'm not exactly sure if each 
of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed "funny 
sketch" ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves, but the 
end result is a film that basically plays out like an extended skit on 
"Saturday Night Live". There are a couple of funny one-liners, but 
mostly just rehashed one-joke scenes, a lot of dead silence and lame 
gags. Add to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster and you 
gotta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here (the film's 
website isn't even up yet!!! What the f***?!?). I do however have to 
give it up to James Woods, the man who opens up this movie with the 
funniest parody of them all (the EXORCIST take-off-- miss this and 
you've missed any reason to see the flick). I especially liked his 
one-liner as he walked in to see the possessed woman's head turning. 
Very funny!</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the film plummets straight down after that, with dumb 
parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as 
SAVE THE LAST DANCE and DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR, and other action movies 
like CHARLIE'S ANGELS and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2. Now help me figure this 
one out, will you? Isn't this supposed to be a parody film of HORROR 
MOVIES?!? (or maybe that's just the title of the film F-ing with my 
head). Well, I'm sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this 
film is its lame-ass script! The Wayans brothers should have known 
better than to look towards the Weinstein brothers (money) instead of 
the Zucker brothers (comedy) for this sequel. Unfortunately for us, all 
we're left with here is a skeleton of a film which might've been funny, 
had it been worked over a few more times, tightened up here and there, 
and been injected with more solid laughs. But as things stand now, there 
is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the 
success of last year's film has led everyone down this path, so screw 
them for not trying as hard (critically speaking, of course). You should 
all be ashamed of yourselves for not putting enough "real" effort into 
this chop-job and for not providing your fans with the ultimate of your 
talents. Pooh on you! (That's telling 'em, JoBlo! Sheesh)</P>
<P>BTW, I'm allotting one point alone to actress Kathleen Robertson, whose 
massive breasts and skanky g-string had me chompin' at the bit. You go, 
girl! Everyone else...stay!</P>
