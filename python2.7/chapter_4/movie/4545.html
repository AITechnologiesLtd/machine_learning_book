<PRE>                           KICKING AND SCREAMING
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>

Photography, Steven Bernstein. Editing, J. Kathleen Gibson. Production

Stoltz, Jason Wiles, Parker Posey, Cara Buono, Elliott Gould, et al.96 
min.  Rated R (language, sex). </P>
<P>I can't decide whether "Kicking and Screaming" is the child of movies 
like  "Slacker," "Metropolitan," "Barcelona," "Clerks" and the like, or 
just a relative. The common ground and style are there.</P>
<P>The film is mainly about four preppyish men who have just graduated from 
college (school's name and location unspecified) and somehow still hang 
around. Since the cast also includes and involves a number of current 
students, it is sometimes confusing to tell who's still taking courses 
and who is not.</P>
<P>The quartet spend a great deal of time in conversations and 
bull-sessions. There are even scenes of a course in what I take is 
Creative Writing, an awful class treated with good irony. </P>
<P>The film's start is auspicious. Then you wait and wait for interesting 
things to happen or to be said. They do not, unless you think that 
endless talk that tries to probe into hearts and minds is fascinating 
--dialogue that focuses on media trivia, pretentious and undigested 
cultural references, sex or  post-sophomoric sophomorisms,what one 
character later denounces as "Liberal Arts bull...t."   </P>
<P>The quartet , now  with diploma in hand, are still at the chrysalis 
stage, at some distance from the change to butterfly. They are still 
dazed and confused, to borrow the title of  Richard ("Slacker") 
Linklater's film on 1970s high-schoolers. Some of the graduates pose as 
sophisticates but know that they are not  yet ready for life outside the 
academic cocoon.</P>
<P>The movie tries to be of the mid-1990s, from references to Prague (where 
one man's girl has gone) to chat about nose rings, but with minor 
changes it could be any time since 1980. It is divided into chapters 
whose headings are "Graduation," " Four Months After Graduation," "Fall 
Semester," "Midterms,"  "One Month Before Christmas Vacation" and "Three 
Weeks Later." </P>
<P>Unlike the steady or occasional lightheartedness of its  filmic 
relatives, this movie's tone feels rather downbeat. The mood is often 
underlined by a kind of morose under-lighting. The man-woman episodes 
are not exactly uplifting either.</P>
<P>A character who is  22 ("Wow! Old Man River!" exclaims a female 
undergraduate) and looks older, is gauchely paired off with a girl who 
is about to become 17, looks younger and, to put it politely, is not 
exactly refined.  When another student, bare-breasted, chain-smoking and 
gum-chewing, tells her new bedmate that she did it because "it seems 
like the college thing to do" this is more depressing than droll. </P>
<P>There are some clever or sharp moments and bits and pieces that find "le 
mot juste" or the right situations. On the whole though, I wonder 
whether the film is a phony assemblage itself or the true depiction of  
phony characters. Assuming it is the latter, those people and their talk 
are not especially stimulating, just as their affairs are without  true 
sentiment --not to mention passion,-- just as replicating life is not  
in itself necessarily interesting. If this is a portrait of the age, it 
is a cheerless one. </P>
<P>Credit however Noah Baumbach, the 25-year old writer-director, with a 
debut that, while low on originality and excitement, is promising and 
rather skillful. A huge number of  first films come  from personal 
experience, a common rite of passage in movies. Here, the director may 
be too close to subject, too involved in it, therefore hampered in the 
process of  selecting,  separating chaff from wheat, maintaining 
clarity, giving shape and tempo to his creation.  </P>
<P>At least one famous director has said that you make only one film in 
your life. This means, more or less, that an "auteur"'s 
psychological-social-intellectual nature results in dominant themes and 
treatments. Some of the best filmmakers have done this, but with 
variety, variations and quality. I suspect that Noah Baumbach, with more 
maturity and distancing will --unless he sells out to commercialism -- 
eventually come up with a more complex picture. </P>
