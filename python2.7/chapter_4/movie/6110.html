<PRE>                               THAT THING YOU DO!
                       A film review by Jeffrey R. Moore
                        Copyright 1996 Jeffrey R. Moore</PRE>
<P>"That Thing You Do!," the new movie written and directed by Tom
Hanks, is the kind of movie that you would love if you rented it, and
merely like if you went to the theater to watch it.  It has great
characters, a fun story line, fine acting, and even a guest
appearance by Hanks himself.  And yet it feels as though something's
missing, something is just not there that should be.</P>
<P>The story revolves around a band who is struggling to make it out of
Erie, Pennsylvania.  The drummer accidentally hurts his arm right
before a show, so the other members of the band ask a mutual friend
issing, something is just not there that should be.</P>

<P>The story revolves around a band who is struggling to make it out of
Erie, Pennsylvania.  They have come up with a "groovy" name (The
"One-ders," which everyone eventually mispronounces as the Oneeders,)
and a love song appropriately titled "That Thing You Do."  However,

Erie, Pennsylvania.  They have come up with a "groovy" name (The
"One-ders," which everyone eventually mispronounces as the Oneeders,)
and a love song appropriately titled "That Thing You Do."  As the
band prepares to play an evening show at a diner, the drummer
accidentally hurts himself and another friend has to stand in.
During rehearsals, he seems bored and distracted, so at the actual
performance he decides to jazz up the beat to the tune, catching his
band mates off guard.  They struggle at first, but then the crowd
starts responding, and pretty soon the song is ending to thunderous
applause and calls for an encore.  Thus begins the "One-ders" ascent
to stardom, with Tom Hanks eventually entering the picture as their
guard.  They struggle at first, but then the crowd

<P>Of course, as the movie progresses, and even the audience watching
the film becomes tired of the once catcy, quickly annoying title
tune, the eventual downfall of the group become evident.  The sudden

<P>The band's rise to stardom is fun to watch, from their first
appearance on a local radio station to a televised concert featuring
their song.  The actors all appear to be having fun, and Liv Tyler
gives an incredibly restrained and honest performance as the
girlfriend of the lead singer.  Everything about the movie was fine
from the beginning until the bittersweet, somewhat predictable
ending.  However, I would still have to recommend it with some
reserve.  You'd have to be a big fan of the 50's/60's rock era to
enjoy all the "concert with wild fans" scenes.  Plus, you'd have to
be able to endure multiple playings of the title song.  (Warning, it
IS catchy at first, but after 8 or 9 times it starts to get
annoying).  All in all, on video you could easily fast forward any of
those scenes and get back to what makes the movie good:  acting, not
ndure multiple playings of the title song.  (Warning, it

to live through such an exciting time when rock and roll really was
new and revolutionary, or for anyone who wants to experience that
feeling, then this movie will deliver the goods.  For anyone who gets
tired of hearing "That Thing You DO!" on your local radio stations,
you might want to wait a while...</P>
