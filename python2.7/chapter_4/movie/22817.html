<P>In 1997, I spoke with "Down To You" star Freddie Prinze Jr. about his
sly, perfectly measured supporting performance in "The House of Yes,"
a delicious little black comedy about seduction, madness, incest and
the Kennedy assassination. The talented actor was exceedingly polite
and well spoken as he enthusiastically discussed acting
techniques. After interviewing too many preening, pretentious,
self-absorbed Hollywood heartthrobs, Prinze's down-to-earth, working
class nature was very refreshing.</P>
<P>The only thing wrong was his hair. Styled in a fashion popular with
young showbiz studs, his coal black hair was close-cropped on the
sides and back, with the top left thick, messed-up and heavily
moussed. The desired effect of the hairdo, I think, is to look as if
you had just crawled out of bed and, should the right person come
along, would be ready to crawl right back in again. Of course, the
mousse ruins any appearance of spontaneity and the 'do packs about as
much oomph as a lacquered explosion. On a guy as genuine as Prinze,
such a trendy, artificial hairstyle simply didn't fit.</P>
<P>Drivel like "Down To You" doesn't fit Prinze either. Aimed at
starry-eyed young girls, the cookie-cutter romantic comedy is trite,
tedious and even blander than its title. To try and jazz things up,
the filmmakers throw in wacky parents, colorful sidekicks, flashbacks
within flashbacks and unusual scene dissolves, but there's no
disguising the dullness of the main storyline. You can arrange Pop
Tarts artfully on a platter, dust them with powdered sugar and
artfully drizzle stings of chocolate and raspberry sauce over
everything, but, in the end, it's still just a plate of Pop Tarts.</P>
<P>Prinze isn't alone here in the squandering of talent. Julia Stiles,
the tempestuous lead in "10 Things I Hate About You," also adds some
flotsam to her resume. And poor Shawn Hatosy, so winning as the
central character in last year's "Outside Providence," is reduced to
playing a perpetually horny goofball. As for Zak Orth (the loudmouth
boorish student from "In and Out"), his role here as a loudmouth
boorish porn star with delusions of becoming Orson Welles may actually
be a step up.</P>
<P>Prinze (and, although they have made fewer poor decisions, Stiles and
Hatosy as well) would do well to use Matt Damon as a role model. Damon
could easily have traded on his All-American good looks, playing
terminally pleasant pretty boys in one film after another, but
instead, he has carefully selected roles that challenge his skills, as
well as the sensibilities of his fan base. While the lure of an easy
paycheck is undoubtedly tempting, Prinze has gone from nervy ("The
House of Yes") to tolerable ("I Know What You Did Last Summer" and
"She's All That") to for-the-love-of-God-what-were-you thinking ("Wing
Commander," "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer" and, now, "Down To
You"). An "aw shucks" demeanor and crooked grin will only carry a
performer so far. If Prinze doesn't start taking some chances soon, he
is in danger of being hopelessly typecast as an innocuous male
ingenue. As he ages and his looks fade, where will that leave him?
Trying to snag a gig on a syndicated TV action series? Prinze deserves
better than that.</P>
<P>You'll notice I've said virtually nothing about the plot. That's
because there is virtually nothing to say. Boy meets girl, boy loses
girl, yadda yadda yadda. The lead characters frequently address the
camera directly; a stylistic gimmick that has been done to death over
the last couple of years. The bulk of the story is told in flashbacks,
further dashing any hint of immediacy. Henry Winkler and Lucie Arnaz
offer a bit of distraction as the quirky, loving parents: he's the
flashy host of a TV cooking show and she's a disc jockey who actually
likes what she plays. Although the movie is only 90 minutes long, it
feels like three hours. Thank goodness for the soundtrack, which
offers a nice selection of melodic ditties.</P>
<P>If you're a young lady who hasn't seen very many films, you may find
"Down To You" dreamy, occasionally naughty and wonderfully
romantic. If you're not, you probably were so bored by the trailers
that you never even considered seeing this movie. Good for
you. Watching talented young actors slowly committing career suicide
is not a pretty sight.</P>
