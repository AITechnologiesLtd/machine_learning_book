<PRE>                                 FRENCH KISS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<PRE>     Now this is the way a romantic comedy should be made.</PRE>
<P>     Redeeming the genre from last week's dismal WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING,
Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline manage to deliver hilarious and surprisingly
touching performances in FRENCH KISS.  Ryan plays Kate, a seriously
neurotic woman who takes the phrase "obsessive-compulsive" to new lows. 
Charlie (Timothy Hutton) is Kate's fiancee, an up-and-coming doctor who,
when Kate is too afraid to board the airplane, takes a week-long business
trip to Paris alone.</P>
<P>     And there the games begin.  Charlie unexpectedly falls for a French
"goddess" and calls off his relationship with Kate.  Stunned, our heroine
becomes understandably obsessed with getting Charlie back, and the games
begin.  On her white-knuckled flight across the Atlantic, she encounters
Luc (Kevin Kline), a smarmy French con-man trying to go straight.  The two
couldn't be less alike, but an unlikely romance begins to sprout.</P>
<P>     FRENCH KISS actually manages to make a decent statement about love
and happiness, bringing to light the truth of the old adage, "There is no
substitute for experience."  The film is also believable despite its
outlandish main characters, whom Ryan and Kline portray with wonderful
emotion and with an amazing flair for comic timing.  Kline's antics are
simply hilarious to the point of absurdity.</P>
<P>     The film's ending is pretty obvious, but how they get there is full
of surprises, and it also made me remember:  love really can come from the
unlikeliest of places.</P>
