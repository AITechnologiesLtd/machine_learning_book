JAPANESE SCREWBALL</PRE>
<PRE>WELCOME BACK, MR. McDONALD</PRE>
<PRE>Written and Directed by Koki Mitani</PRE>
<P>With Masahiko Nishimura, Toshiaki Karasawa</P>
<PRE>The Screen      NR     Subtitles     103 min</PRE>
<P>     Welcome Back Mr. McDonald is flat-out hilarious.  On the surface 
it's a screwball comedy about a live Tokyo radio drama that comes 
unraveled.  On the next level it's about making movies, about show 
business, about the unlimited potential for disaster in a collaborative 
medium which gives sanctuary to Godzilla-sized egos.  And moving along 
to another level, it's about contemporary Japanese society with its 
pressures to Westernize and its pressures to maintain tradition.  You 
can worry about all those levels on your own time, but first, you'll 
just have to sit there and laugh.</P>
<P>     A young housewife (Kyoka Suzuki) has won a contest (she was the 
lone entrant) with her script for an original radio play, a soapy 
romance called "The Woman of Destiny".  The dress rehearsal goes 
smoothly, but shortly before airtime the lead actress (Keiko Toda) 
declares herself uncomfortable with her character's name and demands 
that it be changed.  It seems a fairly harmless bit of temperament.  But 
it's the first stone that starts the avalanche.  I won't even tell you 
what name she settles on, or try to walk you through the frenetic plot 
developments that careen with the speed and unpredictability of 
electrons zipping off the walls of an atom.  But once the harried 
producer (Masahiko Nishimura) has opened the door by agreeing to the 
name change, there's no kicking it shut again.  Each change requires 
another, in geometric progression, until chaos reigns during the live 
broadcast.</P>
<P>     This is one of the most delicious showbiz send-ups since Soapdish 
and Broadcast News.  It may not have the character development of those 
classics, but it's got the freshness and the madcap pace, and it shines 
with both derision and affection for the medium it lampoons.  It's a 
first film by writer-director Koki Mitani, who was the founder of an 
alternative theater company called The Tokyo Sunshine Boys.  He adapted 
his own stage farce to the screen, and although the action is largely 
confined to the innards of a radio studio, it never feels constricted. </P>
<P>     Screwball comedy has pretty much gone the way of the running board 
and the vinyl record.  The modern substitute is gross-out humor, a form 
that puts a low premium on wit and a high value on bodily sounds and 
fluids.  Welcome Back, Mr. McDonald harkens back to a comedy style that 
provoked a wonderfully satisfying laughter.  Welcome back, indeed.</P>
