<PRE>                             DON JUAN DEMARCO
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Jeremy Leven's message is that a
          groovy madness is better than a hard realism.
          Miguel de Cervantes did it much better and Leven's
          Don Juan fantasy is too much a burlesque to work.
          Brando's performance shows not his expected
          strengths but his perennial weaknesses as an actor.
          Rating: low 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It is an old theme to juxtapose the cruel, real world with the
seductive fantasy of a madman.  Certainly that is the power of
Cervantes's DON QUIXOTE.  And there is some attempt in DON JUAN DEMARCO
to capture some of the power of DON QUIXOTE or perhaps even the
strengths of Anthony Harvey's THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS.  But for such a
story to work, the fantasy under-story has to be compelling.  The Don
Juan story of DON JUAN DEMARCO is less a compelling fantasy that
captures the viewer and more a satiric burlesque.  Lord Byron's near-
epic poem version of the adventures of the amorous nobleman was itself
intended to be a light social satire, perhaps no more compelling than
CANDIDE.  Jeremy Leven's screenplay takes three incidents from what was
apparently the Byron version of the story.  (He does that loosely,
incidentally; Leven changes some of the character names and the island
incident should have preceded the harem captivity.  Also in the Byron,
Juan's father died when Juan was a very young boy.  Still, of the many
versions of the Don Juan story, Leven seems to be basing his on the
Byron.)  But the story works only if Leven can make the reader
wistfully wish the fantasy were true.  There would be nothing
compelling about a patient straddling the real world and, say, that of
PEEWEE'S BIG ADVENTURE.  Rather than having DeMarco's fantasies give
resonance to his madness and make us want to believe them, they leave
us with nothing we really feel like believing in either the sane or the
mad world.  It is one of several miscalculations novelist Jeremy Leven
made in directing DON JUAN DEMARCO based on his own screenplay.</P>
<P>     The story begins with Don Juan DeMarco (Johnny Depp) dressed in
the clothing of a Spanish nobleman, but we quickly discover he is in a
modern American city.  He seduces one last woman and then goes to
commit suicide for the love of the one woman he could not win.
Psychiatrist Jack Mickler (Marlon Brando) talks him out of the suicide
by playing along with the imaginings.  When Don Juan is admitted to an
asylum for ten day's observation, Mickler arranges to do the observing.
There the doctor finds himself drawn into Don Juan's charming fantasies
and finds that the young man's pleasant delusions transform his own
life and his relation with his wife (Faye Dunaway).</P>
<P>     Johnny Depp does a fairly good job as the seductive Spaniard,
adding one more likable misfit to what is becoming a long list of such
roles.  Heresy Alert!  Marlon Brando does as well as he is physically
able to do with the role but it has been a long time since he has
turned in a really good performance--in fact, forty-one years!  Since
THE WILD ONE, he has relied on his physical presence and his natural
speech patterns, not unlike John Wayne.  Today he is rotund, he lisps,
and he is surprisingly in need of elocution lessons.  Dunaway puts just
a bit more edge in her role, but has no chemistry with Brando.  It is
unclear what it would mean to have chemistry with Brando in his current
state.  Bob Dishy is unusually restrained as the chief doctor of the
hospital.</P>
<P>     A gentle fantasy along the same lines could have been a very
welcome film, but DON JUAN DEMARCO fails in the execution.  I give it a
low 0  on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
