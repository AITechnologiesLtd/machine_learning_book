<P>     THE OPPOSITE OF SEX may actually be too limiting a title for
screenwriter Don Roos' tart-tongued directorial debut.  After winding its
way through relationship comedy, road picture grit and a dozen genre stops 
in between, it turns out to be the opposite of nearly everything it first
appears to be, including:</P>
<P>     1) The opposite of sincerely-narrated coming-of-age drama.  Long-time
readers know of my disdain for voice-over narration as a substitute for
effective film storytelling.  THE OPPOSITE OF SEX opens with a warning
from Dedee Truitt (Christina Ricci), the 16-year-old vixen at the center
of the story:  "If you're one of those people who don't like movies where
some person you can't see talks the whole time and covers up the holes in
the plot...then you're out of luck."  Like most of Dedee's comments, that
one isn't particularly trustworthy.  The narration provides crucial and
often hilarious peeks into the troubled character, who runs away from home
to stay with her gay half-brother Bill (Martin Donovan), then proceeds to
seduce his lover Matt (Ivan Sergei), steal $10,000 of his money and hit
the road again with Matt in tow.  Roos turns Dedee's bitchy,
politically-incorrect narration into an effective tool for understanding
characters and subverting expectations, enough to make me soften my
absolutist anti-narration stance.  That's not to say that the film is all
about caustic indifference.  In fact, it's...</P>
<P>     2) The opposite of cynical.  Roos has little interest in wallowing in
indie-pic nihilism.  Despite the multitude of quirky touches, THE OPPOSITE
OF SEX is a surprisingly human story of people for whom sex is either
frightening, or manipulative, or a substitute for something more
substantial.  Ricci plays deftly both with and against Dedee's bile-filled
dialogue, giving her a sympathetic edge as she journeys towards some
measure of maturity.  Even better is Lisa Kudrow, cast brilliantly against
type as Lucia, the deeply-repressed sister of Bill's deceased lover.
Playing a character so profoundly disappointed by life that everything and
everyone similarly disappoints her, she moves and speaks like a
perpetually constricted sphincter muscle.  It's a brutally funny and quite
touching performance, one of the year's best.  It also makes it clear that
THE OPPOSITE OF SEX is...</P>
<P>     3) The opposite of a "guy movie."  Photos of a scantily-clad Ricci on
the promotional posters notwithstanding, THE OPPOSITE OF SEX is only
moderately successful at getting inside the male head.  For some reason,
Roos (SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, BOYS ON THE SIDE) has generally written much
more compelling female characters than male characters through his career.
That's true again here, where Ricci and Kudrow steal the show from their
male co-stars in less-developed roles.  Erstwhile "Roseanne" co-star
Johnny Galecki, as a body-pierced, mincing youth infatuated with Matt, is
less a character than gay comic relief; William Scott Lee offers yet
another Christian character who's ignorant and violent.  Even Lyle Lovett,
as the gentle sheriff with a crush on Lucia, is given too little shading
for the important role he ultimately plays.  Only Martin Donovan, always
adept at fleshing out minimalist characterizations with piercing glances,
emerges fully-formed.  Roos covers up several weaknesses with his sharp
dialogue, but he can't hide the sketchy male roles, nor the fact that THE
OPPOSITE OF SEX is...</P>
<P>    4) The opposite of flashy independent film-making.  Every once in a
while, Roos gets overtly cinematic on us -- a slow pan after a gunshot is
heard, a sentimental montage of Bill after Matt leaves.  Otherwise, THE
OPPOSITE OF SEX might as well be a stage play, a collection of static
medium compositions of characters in conversation.  Fortunately, those
conversations are full of quotable lines and keen insights into the way we
use and abuse sex, and vice-versa.  Don't expect dumb comedy, gratuitous
titillation or cheap sentimentality from THE OPPOSITE OF SEX.  You're
going to get the opposite of all that.</P>
