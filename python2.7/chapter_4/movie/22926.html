<P>FELICIA'S JOURNEY (M).  
(Icon/Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: Atom Egoyan
Stars: Bob Hoskins, Elaine Cassidy, Peter McDonald, Arsinee Khanjian, 
Gerard McSorley, Brid Brennan, Peter Turner, Calire Benedict
Running time: 116 minutes.</P>
<P>Atom Egoyan leaves behind his native Canada to tackle this
chilling, suspenseful psychological thriller about obsession and a
uniquely fascinating and charismatic serial killer.  Felicia's Journey
is set against the background of the bleak urban wasteland of
Britain's post industrial north, and Egoyan and regular
cinematographer Paul Sargossy capture some haunting images and superb
contrasts that beautifully underscore the themes of the grim
narrative.</P>
<P>Felicia (Elaine Cassidy), a naive and shy young Irish lass who
has a brief fling with Johnny (Peter McDonald), a local boy, who heads
south to seek employment in Birmingham.  That's the last she hears of
him, and any efforts to forward letters to him are thwarted by
Johnny's stonily resolute mother.  When she learns that she is
pregnant, Felicia sets off to find Johnny and determine their future
together.</P>
<P>Her search is a futile one, until she meets Hilditch (Bob
Hoskins), a lonely, middle aged catering supervisor at a large
foundry.  The son of a famous former television cook, with whom he
still seems obsessed, Hilditch lives alone in a big empty house that
resonates with anachronistic touches from the '50's.  He initially
offers Felicia some sympathetic advice, and agrees to help her in her
search.  But Hilditch has another reason for helping this lonely, lost
and frightened young woman, which is teasingly made clear through a
series of flashbacks and video recordings.</P>
<P>Egoyan draws some unnerving parallels between these two
lonely, tainted people, who are, in many ways, outcasts from the
regular world.</P>
<P>Hoskins plays Hilditch with remarkable understatement and
poise, giving him a sympathetic edge and atmosphere of compassion that
belies his monstrous nature.  Not since Norman Bates has the screen
produced a cinematic psycho who has been so traumatised by his
overbearing and suffocating mother as Hilditch.  Cassidy's strong
performance imbues the confused Felicia with a touching naivete and
a vulnerability, yet also gives her a hidden strength that slowly
emerges as the full impact of her betrayal sinks in.</P>
<P>Felicia's Journey is based on a novel by William Trevor, and
it seems to resonate with many of those themes common to Egoyan's past
films (The Sweet Hereafter, Exotica, etc).  Egoyan shapes the
narrative with his usual distinctive style, creating an unnerving and
disturbing atmosphere.  Felicia's Journey is far more chilling in what
it suggests than in what it shows.  The restraint with which Egoyan
directs serves as an example for many other contemporary directors,
who equate horror with explicit depictions of blood and gore,
dismembered bodies and lots of graphic, gory effects.  He teasingly
merges the past with the present to inform audiences about the
characters and their motivations.</P>
