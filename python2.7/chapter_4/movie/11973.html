<P>        I think of I Know What You Did Last Summer as the movie that
Scream and Scream 2 could
have been. Mind you, though, I mean this in the worst possible way. I
Know What You Did Last Summer
is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the Scream's. As a
result, it's even worse than some of your
better campy horror pictures (see Nightmare on Elm Street) because it
thinks it's about thirty times
smarter than it is.</P>
<P>        Based on a teen book of the same name and, disappointingly,
adapted by Scream scribe Kevin
Williamson, I Know What You Did Last Summer begins with appropriately
angsty modern rock music
combined with some startling cinematography of a cliff along the ocean
and an angsty sort sitting at the
top. The appropriate mood being set (this is angst-horror for the 90's),
we cut over to the July 4th parade
in a small North Carolina town. From there, we see the blond, female
protagonist, Helen Shivers
(woodenly played by Sarah Michelle Geller), getting crowned Croaker
Queen as the blond male "hero,"
Barry Cox (woodenly played by Ryan Phillipe), and matched brunette pair
of protagonists, Julie James and
Ray Bronson (woodenly played by Party of Five's Jennifer Love Hewitt and
Freddie Prinze Jr.,
respectively) cheer her on.</P>
<P>        After getting drunk at a party, going to a beach to wittily
discuss urban legend and indulge in
some foreshadowing, and having some meaningful sex (if you believe what
the characters say), the four
run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night. His face is
mangled so they can't tell who it is,
and they come to the decision to dump him in the ocean so as to not ruin
any of their future chances for
success in the world.</P>
<P>        Cut to one year later. The lives of our protagonists have gone
from annoying to bad. Main
brunette female, the bright one of the bunch, has been plagued with
guilt and almost failed out of college.
Blond female has forfeited her dreams of starring on Guiding Light, and
now works at the family store in
town. Brunette male is a fisherman, living off the land. Blond male has
become a complete jerk and
quarterback on some college football team. Then, predictably, their past
comes back to haunt them.</P>
<P>        It all begins with an irrational murder, followed by some
taunting of protagonists by the
mysterious killer, bad acting by a good actress (Anne Heche), an
improbable plot, bad acting by the main
bad actors, some more killing, concluding in a climactic scene, mostly
climactic in the relief at the end of
the movie. All the while, the actors and actresses spout off bad lines,
and main brunette male does his best
Keanu Reeves imitation.</P>
<P>        Not that the movie was without pleasure. Count the illogical
plot twists and bad lines for some
fun. Mostly, though, note the costumes of main females and how trendily
unattractive they make the
otherwise eye-catching pair look.</P>
