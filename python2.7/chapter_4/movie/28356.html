<P>   For animated stories that can absorb the attention of both
adults and kids and provide substantial lessons as well, you
can't go wrong with "Shrek" (which pokes fun at the concept
that surface beauty is everything), "Chicken Run" (a shrewd
tale which among other things conveys a note about animal
rights), and "The Iron Giant" (which parodies 1950s paranoia). 
For sheer spectacle, however, without Disney trademarks like
Broadway songs and snugly animals and without any real
Aesopian dimensions, look to "Atlantis."  "Atlantis" provided
me with my first experience with digital projection, the wave of
the future, and darned if the colors aren't brighter, sharper
and, well, more colorful than film stock could afford. For the
kids there's non-stop action and loud noises which make this
film a must for the big big screen.</P>
<P>   Directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise ("Beauty and the
Beast," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame"), "Atlantis" takes us
back to 1914 when a bright-eyed, idealistic young man, the
grandson of a great explorer who found a map of Atlantis,
succeeds in raising foundation money to search for the lost
continent.  After a dazzling prologue featuring the big bang
which caused this fabled land to be lost near the coast of
Iceland, we watch Milo Thatch (voice of Michael J. Fox)
emerge behind his oversized glasses to join a group
in search of the buried land.  They include a cook who is
awfully fond of bacon grease, Cookie (Jim Varney); an expert
with explosives who, as one character remarks, looks as
though he had just come out of a Turkish prison, Vinny (Don
Novello); a robust physician adept at chiropractic
manipulations of the neck, Sweet (Phil Morris); a mole (Corey
Burton) who is considered like a pet but is adept at digging;
and good-looking but cynical Helga (Claudia Christian)
together with the commander of the group, Rourke (James
Garner).  </P>
<P>   Zipping along in a submarine-like object that could have
come out of Jules Verne's most celebrated sci-fi novel, they
engage soon enough in battles; first with the largest lobster
ever discovered east of Maine, ultimately with a couple of
members of their own team who break off into a minor civil
war with the crew.  When they do discover their objective,
which could be a Shangri-La if the civilization were not
doomed to die out, they meet King Nedakh (Leonard Nimroy)
and his heir-apparent, the lovely Princess Kida (Cree
Summer).  Kida is sharp-looking and playful, giving the
impression that "Atlantis" is not going to fall into the Shrekian
idea that beauty is unimportant in heroines.</P>
<P>   Less talk, more action, appears the credo of Disney's latest,
spectacular animated feature, while James Newton Howard's
music, which at some times appears ready to compete with
the score of "Pearl Harbor," inflects the drama of this heroic
adventure.  "Atlantis" features subtitles whenever the local
dialect is spoken (a language known to the adventurers as
gibberish), a concept which could help habituate the small fry
to the idea that English is not spoken everywhere and that
there just may be a few foreign films in their future that could
match "Armageddon" in quality.</P>
<P>Rated PG.  Running time: 93 minutes.  (C)2001,
