<P>     THE OUTPOST is what might result if Kafka wrote about the waning 
years of Socialism in Eastern Europe.  The film, which reflects what 
happens when people unquestioningly accept the dictates of their rulers, 
is obscure, bizarre, and ultimately dissatisfying.  THE OUTPOST 
functions as an extended allegory that could easily have been shortened 
to about half of its final running length.  Some viewers may appreciate 
this opaque, grim depiction of the consequences of totalitarianism, but 
I'm not among them.  </P>
<P>     THE OUTPOST has a minimalist story that takes place in an unnamed 
Eastern European country during the 1980s.  A woman, Gizella Weiss (Mari 
Nagy), has shown enough initiative and inventiveness to earn a promotion 
to "a new sector".  Led by one increasingly less communicative guide 
after another, Gizella travels by train, bus, railroad cart, horse-drawn 
wagon, and on foot to reach the outpost.  When she arrives, more than 
two-thirds of the way through the movie, she discovers that the place is 
a run-down shack inhabited by weasels and an unfriendly man who eats one 
meal a day and refuses to light fires.  When her reluctant companion 
finally confides to her the reason why she's there, his words are 
cryptic:  "You were sent here to think about why you were sent here."</P>
<P>     THE OUTPOST is a very strange film, using stark lighting, bland 
characters (even Gizella is strictly one-dimensional), and repeated 
dialogue (men at various stopping points say virtually the same things 
to Gizella) to drive home its message.  The problem is, eighty-five 
minutes is a long time to sit through such a stagnant movie.  There 
characters are so distant and their actions so meaningless that it 
doesn't take long for THE OUTPOST's pervasive apathy to reach the 
audience.  We just don't care.  Newcomer Mari Nagy is very good as 
Gizella, and Peter Gothar's fifth feature certainly gets the point 
across, but THE OUTPOST could have benefited from more substance and a 
few genuine characters amidst all the self-conscious weirdness.</P>
