<P>     ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION makes more missteps than I
care to count.  Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow are, indeed, a winning pair
as the Venice Beach space cases, pretending to be successful, self-
employed inventors at their ten-year reunion.  (Their claimed claim to
fame:  Post-It notes.) Alas, the movie, a cross between CLUELESS and
DUMB AND DUMBER, lets them down at almost every turn.  Flashbacks dispel
the momentum of the first thirty minutes, while an extended dream
sequence serves little purpose in hour two.  At least the movie is
watchable up to that point.  The finale-- where things get serious and
the reunited characters begin confessing to this, that, and the other--
sent me straight for the door.  Trust me, the final reel is best viewed
from underneath the Exit sign.  (Rated "PG"/95 min.)</P>
