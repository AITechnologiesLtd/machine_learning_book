<PRE>                                 BREAKDOWN
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     It's Rednecks 1, Yuppies 0!  At least it is for most of BREAKDOWN,
a film that pits hapless Massachusettsans against wily Arizonans in a
battle of automotive might on America's highways.  If you've seen THE
VANISHING (either one), you've essentially seen BREAKDOWN.  In this
incarnation, Kurt Russell finds his wife (my nemesis Kathleen Quinlan)
abducted by the brilliantly evil J.T. Walsh and gang, and a cruel
conspiracy is revealed that is designed to separate the happy couple
from the fortunes that -- it turns out -- they don't really have.  The
film has a few interesting twists (that I won't spoil), but the movie's
main flaws are its over-reliance on wild coincidences to advance the
plot and a pace that is overwhelmingly slow until the very end.  With
that said, BREAKDOWN gets a big so-so... but if I were driving, I
would've just left Quinlan at the truck stop.</P>
