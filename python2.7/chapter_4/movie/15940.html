 As a sort of litmus test to see whether or not "Jack Frost" is the movie
for you, consider your response to this bit of information: It includes
Hanson performing covers of the Spencer Davis Group's "Gimme Some Lovin'"
and the Rascals' "Good Lovin'," as well as a Spice Girls' rendition of
"Sleigh Ride."
 Still intrigued? Then consider the title character in "Frost" is a would-be
musician and that he's played by Michael Keaton, who sings as if he was the
honors graduate of the Bruce Willis School of Blues. His rocked-up version
of "Frosty the Snowman" isn't easily intelligible, although, like the
Kingsmen's "Louie Louie," it sounds vaguely dirty.
 The rest of "Jack Frost," however, is almost as pure as snow. Jack dies in
a car crash, leaving behind lonely widow Gabby (Kelly Preston) and young son
Charlie (Joseph Cross). But before any tears can be shed, Jack's back,
reincarnated as a snowman and brought to life by a magic harmonica. There's
frollicking a-plenty before the movie gets around to delivering an unsubtle
sermon about how ambitious parents should forsake their own dreams of glory
and pay more attention to their offspring, a message kids in the audience
are sure to validate.
  Though as tacky-looking as a plastic tree bedecked in ornaments from the
dollar store, "Jack Frost" probably has enough action and pre-pubescent
humor (the snowman checks himself out to see if he's anatomically correct)
to please grade-schoolers, and, though it deals with death and grief, it
does so in the glossiest, most cheerful way possible, a far cry from the
moodiness of "Babe: Pig in the City." You also have to have a certain
appreciation for any family flick that can somehow reel in Dweezil Zappa and
Henry Rollins.
 The performances are better than the silly material deserves. Keaton is his
usual casual self, Cross avoids becoming too cloying and "The Full Monty"'s
Mark Addy provides a bit of extra warmth as an understanding friend of the
family.
