<PRE>"The Legend of Drunken Master" – Chan Is the Life of
the Party
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>There's a great show that has arrived in the DC area,
and I can hardly wait to see it.  That production is
called "Dralion", performed by the world-famous Cirque
Du Soleil troupe.  Its theme is Chinese acrobatics and
it promises to be a spectacular show.  Most
performances have sold-out, although I was lucky
enough to have already purchased my ticket, which cost
me in excess of $60.  But if you can't buy any tickets
or can't justify its price, a great alternative for
only a fraction of the cost is this wild martial-arts
flick, featuring Jackie Chan, who is at his very best.</P>
<P>In this film, a movie originally released in Hong Kong
back in 1994, Chan plays Wong Fei-hong, a prankish son
of a respected herb doctor circa the 1920s.  The story
begins at a train station where Wong Fei-hong wants to
carry some medicine onto a train without paying the
tariff.  To sneak it aboard, he hides it in a
diplomat's suitcase.  Once the trip commences, he'll
just simply recover the medicine and be on his way. 
However, upon retrieval, he takes the wrong bag, and
subsequently becomes entangled in a plot that involves
an ambassador and an antiquities smuggling operation.</P>
<P>As with most of Chan's Hong Kong made films
re-released for the American audience, you'll find the
usual peculiarities.  These include awkward dubbing,
zany plots, screwy slapstick, and absurd
characterizations (a Counter Intelligence Officer that
appears early on seems to have an important role, but
disappears 20 minutes into the film; meanwhile, other
characters seemingly appear out of nowhere).  And the
story is usually just an excuse to see Chan in action.</P>
<P>However, this is a performance that will not
disappoint.  In fact, of the 70+ martial arts films
that Chan has made, most aficionados have ranked this
film as one his three best.  Indeed, Chan is in top
form and these fighting sequences have to be seen in
order to be believed.  The first sequence is
incredible.  Chan, with a short sword, goes against a
spear-wielding Manchu officer.  They fight in such
close quarters that just to maneuver those weapons at
the speed in which they fight is an incredible feat in
itself.  You may notice that in many fighting
sequences from other movies, the film speed increases
to try to make the fighters appear more awesome. 
Here, Chan and his opponent are moving so quickly that
you wished that the film speed could have actually
slowed down!</P>
<P>What makes Chan a true exhibitionist is his Drunken
Boxing style (an actual kung fu style).  By ingesting
large amounts of liquor, it loosens up the body while
allowing it to withstand higher thresholds of pain. 
Let him increase his blood alcohol level, and it's
like Popeye taking his spinach.  Here, he staggers, he
sways, and he kicks butt, mesmerizing the audience
with his acrobatic abilities while in the character of
a drunk.  There are a bevy of incredibly choreographed
fight sequences, culminating towards a terrific
showdown pitting him against an enemy who uses his
lightning quick legs to fight in ways that I had never
seen.  This stuff is truly amazing.  What a fun
matinee this is!</P>
