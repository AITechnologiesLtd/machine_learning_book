<P>  1998 was such a dismal year for animated features (I gave negative 
  reviews to "Antz," "The Rugrats Movie," and "A Bug's Life") that I was 
  beginning to think I had somehow outgrown them, even though I knew that 
  wasn't true since I still loved the majority of animated pictures in the 
  past. So, it's funny how the last film in that genre for the year turned 
  out to be Dreamworks' first foray into basic animation, "The Prince of 
  Egypt," which is an awe-inspiring, amazing achievement that not only is 
  refreshingly more serious and realistic than the usual dull recent 
  Disney movies, but enraptured me in its spell from the first powerful 
  sequence to the last.</P>
<P>  Based on the biblical story of Moses, Dreamworks, no doubt, had a 
  difficult film on their hands to make, particularly since it was to be 
  an animated film and the subject matter is uplifting, yet very dark. 
  Thankfully, Dreamworks seems to be far more mature than Disney, for if 
  they had made it, they would have added a bunch of cute animals that 
  would substitute for comic relief. In its visually beautiful opening 
  scene, baby Moses is set in a basket and pushed out to sea by his 
  mother, in order to save him from murderous Egyptian soldiers who have 
  taken over their village. Soon, Moses washes up from the sea and is 
  given a home at the palace of the Pharaoh Seti (Patrick Stewart), where 
  he grows up thinking that the Pharaoh is his real father and Pharaoh's 
  son, Rameses (Ralph Fiennes), is his brother. When Moses (voiced well by 
  Val Kilmer) accidentally runs into two slaves, who happen to be his 
  brother, Aaron (Jeff Goldblum), and sister, Miriam, (Sandra Bullock), 
  they try to convince him of his true family. He, at first, doesn't 
  believe them, and then when the truth is reinforced by Pharaoh, Moses 
  becomes outraged that he has been lied to all his life, and realizes 
  that the slaves working at the palace are being severely mistreated. 
  Seekng solace across the desert in a Midianite village, Moses falls in 
  love with the shepardess, Tzipporah (Michelle Pfeiffer), and when he 
  finally comes into contact with the burning bush, which gives him the 
  power to set the slaves free in Egypt, he returns to his home of royalty 
  and sets forth a series of dangerous plagues, which include a 
  destructive swarm of locusts and turning the sea into blood.</P>
<P>  As you have probably guessed, "The Prince of Egypt," is most likely too 
  intense and "adult" for younger children, but it is a magnificent marvel 
  for older children and grown-ups, and it also serves as being 
  educational without becoming relentlessly preachy and religious. Not 
  only that, but the film was so stunning to look at and so sound in its 
  story department that it was actually highly entertaining and exciting, 
  as well.</P>
<P>  With "The Prince of Egypt," animation has certainly gone to a new 
  ultimate level. In recent years, the Disney films had grown to feel 
  unspectacular because the animation simply didn't seem to be showing me 
  things I hadn't already seen. "The Prince of Egypt" contains, by far, 
  the best animation I have ever seen, with a resplendent or astonishing 
  image coming ever minute. The sequences that stand out most in my mind 
  include when hieroglyphics come to life; the plague arrives that kills 
  all of the first-born children; the amazing swarm of locusts; the 
  edge-of-your-seat chariot race; the solemn march of the slaves after 
  they have been freed; and, ultimately, the parting of the red sea. </P>
<P>  For once, the musical numbers in "The Prince of Egypt" are actually 
  memorable and often quite beautiful, particularly the opening musical 
  number, and "When You Believe," which is a lovely and touching ballad. 
  Although the music is not necessary, the songs were, overall, satisfying 
  enough that I have no objections to the decision of making the film a 
  musical.</P>
<P>  "The Prince of Egypt," finally broke the recent string of disappointing 
  animated features, so much so that this is actually one of the very best 
  films of the year. It showed me images that I had never seen before in 
  the world of animation, and I was constantly in a state of shock and 
  wonder over the astounding technological advancements. Gratefully, the 
  film proves that an animated film can be made that deals with a serious 
  subject without condescending to the so-called "cute and cuddly" laws of 
  children's fare. "The Prince of Egypt" is a towering achievement that 
  puts to shame the majority of recent Disney films, and is an ideal film 
  to see during the holiday season. </P>
