<P>If you've ever worked in a large office, for a law firm, or even as a temp,
you'll definitely want to check out Haiku Tunnel, a new film based on Josh
Kornbluth's popular one-man play.  It's better than Office Space when it
comes to milking the cruel banality of office work for comedy, but I'm not
sure that people unfamiliar with the concept of cubicles and printer jams
will really get it.  Those folks ought to try, though, because it's a very
funny film.</P>
<P>Kornbluth, who looks like a balding cross between Horatio Sanz and Jack
Black, stars as himself, a native New Yorker living in the "proletarian"
area of San Francisco.  He's employed by a temp agency called Uniforce and
prides himself on his ability to arrive at work on time and get the job done
quickly.  Josh loves being a temp, as he seems to have a commitment problem,
having just dumped a beautiful girlfriend for being too perfect.</P>
<P>Tunnel takes place over just one week, which begins with Josh being assigned
to a law firm called Schuyler & Mitchell (or S&M) to provide secretarial
work for an attorney who may actually be the Prince of Darkness (Warren
Keith), though he's nowhere as scary as Kevin Spacey in Swimming With
Sharks.  Shunned by his co-workers because he's just a temp, Josh is given a
cassette containing the dictation for 17 very important letters that must be
sent immediately.  But he's constantly sidetracked by a myriad of things,
including a very funny office orientation (conducted by Harry Shearer),
several attempts to write a novel and an enticing offer to become "perm."</P>
<P>Because S&M agrees to cover the cost of his psychiatric visits, Josh
eventually caves in and gives up his beloved status as a temporary employee,
which earns the attention of the peculiar co-workers who had previously
ignored him.  Mindy (Amy Resnick), Clifford (Brian Thorstenson) and DaVonne
(June Lomena) will each remind you of at least one wacko you've been forced
to work with at some point in your employment endeavors.</P>
<P>Though it's oddly structured (there are flashbacks within flashbacks) and
things seem to fall apart in the third act, Tunnel is still a cute, charming
little film that will delight a demographic that desperately needs more
humor in their lives.  It's obvious Kornbluth has extensive experience in
temporary office jobs, but according to the press notes, so does most of the
film's other acting talent (some still temped during filming).  Plus, how
can you possibly dislike a film that plays The Pixies' "Debaser" over the
opening credits?</P>
<P>1:30 - R for language and some sexuality</P>
