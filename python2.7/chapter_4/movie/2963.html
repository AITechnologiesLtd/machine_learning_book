<PRE>                                  EXIT TO EDEN
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Director: Garry Marshall
Starring: Dana Delaney, Paul Mercurio, Rosie O'Donnell, Dan Aykroyd
Based on the novel by Anne Rice</P>
<P>     Garry Marshall, who made a Cinderella story out of street
prostitution (PRETTY WOMAN), was the obvious choice to convert Anne
Rice's lurid S&M novel into a routine Hollywood comedy.  His result
with this material is not as good.  Watching EXIT TO EDEN reminded me
of switching between two movies, one a near remake of the Aykroyd
comedy DRAGNET and the other an edited "erotic" film on USA Network's
Up All Night.  I had the feeling that when I switched from one film to
the other I missed whatever good parts there might be.  Both as a
comedy and as an erotic film, EXIT TO EDEN is a failure.</P>
<P>     Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd play cops sent to a selective
sexual fantasy resort.  Aykroyd is, of course, a straight-laced prude.
O'Donnell is at first portrayed as streetwise.  Disappointingly, once
on the island she is also a straight-laced prude.  All of their funny
scenes are in the advertisements.  This, mathematically speaking,
leaves over an hour and a half of failed jokes and missed
opportunities.  Early in the film police partners O'Donnell and Aykroyd
make a good comedy team.  For reasons that are never clear, Aykroyd and
O'Donnell are split up on the island.  This leaves them both flailing
around looking for laughs in all the wrong places.  Or in Aykroyd's
case, just mostly looking lost.</P>
<P>     The S&M erotic plotline involves Dana Delaney and BALLROOM
DANCING's Paul Mercurio.  The concept of S&M has been heavily sanitized
for the film.  The slaves perform chores around the island, and if they
are lucky, get ordered to kiss Delaney's foot.  The limp whipping that
a few receive wouldn't make a cat hiss.  There are a few campy moments
of Dana Delaney being carried around by her slaves, but not enough to
make this a camp classic.  The few nude scenes of Mercurio and Delaney,
considering the subject matter, come off as very tame.  Most of the
time Delaney is depicted giving lessons to middle aged house wives on
how to spice up their sex lives.  These lessons are played for comedy,
but wind up, like the whole film, being neither funny nor erotic.  One
lesson has Delaney lead the housewives in how to talk dirty.  An older
woman says, "Put your thing in my thing."  Unfortunately, that is one of
the funnier jokes in the film.</P>
<P>     The most annoying thing about the film is that O'Donnell and
Aykroyd are sent to the island to recover a small object.  All they
have to do is ask for it.  They never do.  I suppose if they simply
asked for it, then the film would have been over in five minutes.  In
retrospect that would have been better for everyone involved.</P>
<P>     Several years ago Gerard Depardieu had much better luck in Barbet
Shroeder's S&M comedy MAITRESSE.  People interested in the subject
matter would do better to seek out that on video.  The STORY OF O was
also filmed by the people that brought you EMMANUELLE, and is at least
better than EXIT TO EDEN, but not much.</P>
