<PRE>Huozhe (1994)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 86</PRE>
<P>Better known by its English translation "To Live",
"Huozhe" tells the story of a small Chinese family,
from the 1940s through the 1960s.  The great political
turmoil of that country, from the Civil War to the
resulting Communist dictatorship, the economic
hardships and political purges, are themes examined
from the family's point of view.</P>
<P>The story begins with Fugui (You Ge) gambling away
the family home of his elderly father.  Fugui and
young pregnant wife Jiazhen (Li Gong) are left
destitute.  Fugui scrapes a living as a puppeteer,
then is forced to serve in both the Nationalist
and the Communist armies.  Fugui is reunited with
his family, which struggles to survive the dynamic
and dangerous political winds.  There are family
triumphs and tragedies.</P>
<P>Fugui has a major character transformation once
he becomes homeless.  Before, he was proud, curt
and self-destructive.  After, he is humble, hard-working,
and determined to make things best for his family.
This transformation would not be credible in most
films, but is done so skillfully in "To Live" that
it seems natural.</P>
<P>The novel and screenplay were both co-written by
Yu Hua and Wei Lu.  They succeed in getting across,
without ever becoming pedantic, the problems
that come with Communist dictatorships:
everyone is equally poor, brainwashed with political
slogans that eventually are seen through, with
harsh penalties for acts arbitrarily interpreted as
capitalistic or "counter-revolutionary".  Too much
success can be dangerous.</P>
<P>I liked the character of Fugui's rebellious son
Youqing (Deng Fei).  Being a child, Fei is not the
best actor.  A scene where he engages in a streetfight
isn't convincing.  But his impish personality and
actions keep Fugui and Jiazhen, as well as the
audience, guessing as to what will happen next.</P>
