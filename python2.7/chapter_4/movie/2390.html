<PRE>                         ACE VENTURA, PET DETECTIVE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Jim Carrey, Courteney Cox, Sean Young, Udo Kier, Dan Marino.
Screenplay:  Jack Bernstein, Tom Shadyac & Jim Carrey.
Director:  Tom Shadyac.</P>
<P>     As many individual elements as I might analyze with any given
film, my gut reaction almost always comes down to one crucial issue:
did the film do what it was trying to do?  If it was a thriller, did it
keep me in suspense?  If it was a romance, did I respond emotionally?
And if it was a comedy, did I laugh?  Of all the film types, comedy is
perhaps the most difficult to analyze; either it works, or it doesn't.
Which brings me to this confession: I laughed at ACE VENTURA: PET
DETECTIVE.  God help me, I laughed quite a bit.  Comedian Jim Carrey's
unique persona won me over in spite of a great deal of stupidity and
some sluggish pacing.</P>
<P>     Jim Carrey is Ace Ventura, a private eye who specializes in
finding lost pets.  As the only one there is at what he does, it is Ace
who gets the call for the biggest case of his career:  finding the
Miami Dolphins' kidnapped mascot, Snowflake.  With the help of Dolphins
publicist Melissa Robinson (Courteney Cox), Ace begins investigating
suspects like wealthy marine life collector Ron Camp (Udo Kier),
eventually turning his focus towards someone connected to the Dolphins
organization.  In his way stands the Miami police, headed by combative
Lt. Lois Einhorn (Sean Young), as Ace tries to crack the case before
the Super Bowl.</P>
<P>     Vanity projects are a dime a dozen these days, but they all apply
a very similar logic, namely that if you let the star do what he or
she does best, and if that star's audience is large enough, you'll have
a success.  I'm not sure whether the latter condition is true of
Carrey, but it is true that he's allowed to do what he does best.  It
has been a long time since I've seen a physical comedian who looks as
comfortable on screen as Carrey.  His elastic features recall early
Jerry Lewis, while his spindly frame and geeky self- confidence show
traces of Pee-Wee Herman.  When the comedy is purely physical, the
laughs are really big.  The opening sequence features Ace disguised as
a parcel deliveryman gleefully shattering the contents of his package
to simulate a shipping mishap.  My favorite bit involved Ace sneaking
out of a bathroom window to snoop around Camp's mansion, taking an
elaborate and artificially treacherous route towards a door he could
have walked to in seconds.  ACE VENTURA boasts some of the most amusing
slapstick in recent years this side of the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker
films.</P>
<P>     It's considerably more erratic in its success when it comes to
verbal gags.  No scatological subject goes unexamined in ACE VENTURA;
Carrey even utilizes his own posterior as a ventriloquist's dummy.  In
fact, ACE VENTURA is almost self-congratulatory in its political
incorrectness, using homophobia and sexism as punch lines.  The film
drags between visual set pieces, rescued only by Carrey's goofy
delivery.  Part of the problem is that screenwriters Carrey, Tom
Shadyac and Jack Bernstein frequently seem unclear as to when enough is
enough.  Ace's trademark mocking cackle, borrowed from Carrey's Fire
Marshall Bill character from "In Living Color," is funny once but not
three times.  A more telling example involves the theme song from THE
CRYING GAME, used perfectly once but then used again so that it just
seems derivative.  Finally, one piece of advice for filmmakers:  if you
must use Dan Marino for a cameo, please don't give him too many lines.
An Isotoner glove commercial is about all I can take.</P>
<P>     There would seem to be little point to commenting on the
supporting players in ACE VENTURA, since for all practical purposes
they serve as scenery with SAG cards.  However, I would be remiss in
not mentioning Sean Young, who appears to have resigned herself to
doing parodies of her reputation as a real-life psycho.  She has a fun,
over-the-top part much like her role in FATAL INSTINCT, but wisely she
avoids trying to steal scenes from Carrey.  It just wouldn't work.  In
ACE VENTURA, Jim Carrey establishes himself as a first-rate screen
clown, one I hope to see again.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 missing pets:  6.</PRE>
