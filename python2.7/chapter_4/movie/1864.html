<P>     Claire Jabrowski (Trisha Todd) is a California author who has
reached recognition based on titles like LIFE CAN RUIN YOUR HAIR.  To
write her next book, she has decided to spend some time at an
all-female Pacific Coast writers' retreat.  She arrives there to meet
her roommate, Dr. Noel Benedict (Karen Trumbo), the author of the
infamous THE NAKED TRUTH and an avowed lesbian.  Noel and Claire are as
different from each other as two women can be, and that's the cause of
inevitable friction.  Where Noel is neat, orderly, non-smoking, and
averse to casual relationships, Claire is the exact opposite.  Yet as
the story progresses, the two find themselves inexplicably drawn to
each other.</P>
<P>     In the past few years, a number of films portraying the gay
community and culture in a positive light have come out (the most
controversial of which has to be Gregg Araki's THE LIVING END).  Most
of these, however, have explored male relationships.  CLAIRE OF THE
MOON is one of the few movies to cross over and present the issues from
the female perspective.</P>
<P>     The film has its interesting points, but almost all are realized
on an intellectual and not an emotional level.  There's a great deal of
academic discussion on the differences between heterosexual and
homosexual relationships, the nature of intimacy, and why there is so
much difficulty communicating in modern society.  While the viewer may
not always agree with the conclusions of the characters, it's
impossible to deny that the reasoning is well thought-out and the
topics are certainly worth investigation.</P>
<P>     There's another interesting feature about CLAIRE OF THE MOON that
may make some male viewers squirm a little.  Men are not treated
particularly well in this film, and writer/director Nicole Conn makes
no apologies for this.  They are portrayed as little more than sex
objects--bodies to satiate Claire's hunger.  Turnabout, after all, is
fair play.  How many times have women fit this role in male-oriented
movies?</P>
<P>     CLAIRE OF THE MOON ultimately fails because it does a poor job of
entertaining.  While the film undoubtedly attempts to pique the
intellect, it is, above all else, a love story and, as such, should
rouse the emotions as well.  For a number of reasons, it proves
entirely unable to do so.</P>
<P>     First and foremost is the amateurish quality of the screenplay.
The basic story is old, formula-riddled, and predictable (the only
difference being that the lovers are two women rather than a man and a
women).  On top of that, the dialogue is unbelievably stilted.  People
talk like they're reading from an intellectual treatise.  I know a lot
of people with excellent vocabularies and they don't talk anything like
the characters in CLAIRE OF THE MOON.</P>
<P>     The acting isn't going to win any awards either.  At their best
moments, the principles are merely adequate.  Their characters lack
depth, more often acting as mouthpieces for a philosophy than as the
unique people they're supposed to be.  Worse still are the five or six
supporting performers who consistently go annoyingly over-the-top.  One
character in particular (Caren Graham's Tara O'Hara) is so awful--a
walking cliche with a terrible Southern accent--that the film is
painful to watch when she's on-screen.</P>
<P>     Finally, the Nicole Conn's direction isn't much better than her
writing.  She has a lot of mellow scenery shots with Claire in
reflective poses that look like they belong on the cover of romance
novels.  Accompanied by a "dreamy" score, these moments are almost
comically absurd.  Then there are the two fantasy sequences, which look
and sound like poorly-conceived music videos.</P>
<P>     There can't be many copies of this film, because the one that I
saw (on the second day of release) was not in good condition, an
indication that the print has been shipped from city-to-city.  Other
copies across the country (however many there are) aren't likely to be
in better condition.  This is a minor quibble, but it is noticeable,
especially at the beginning.</P>
<P>     While it's possible to applaud the motives of CLAIRE OF THE MOON,
as well as its message, the project is simply not a strong enough movie
to recommend.  This is a good example of a small, independent film that
boasts neither high production values nor good acting.  It is a
single-issue picture that's too flawed to be given the serious
attention the subject warrants.</P>
