<P>There's no easier way to say it than "Bless the Child" is a very bad movie. 
The film, directed by Chuck Russell (1987's "A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: 
Dream Warriors"), joins an increasing number of recent religious-themed 
horror pictures that include 1999's "Stigmata" and "End of Day," and while 
neither of those were cause for any sort of praise, at least they knew what 
genre they were in and how to keep the pacing actually moving. No such luck 
with "Bless the Child," which gets off to a shaky start with a heartrendingly 
earnest scene between two sisters (one of which is a drug addict), and then 
goes downhill from there as the proceedings become buried deeper and deeper 
in inane and preposterous plotting.</P>
<P>Maggie O'Connor (Kim Basinger) is a lonely, divorced nurse living alone in a 
New York apartment building when, a few days before Christmas, finds her 
younger sister Jenna (Angela Bettis), whom she hasn't seen in a long time, at 
her doorstep with a newborn baby. Strung out on drugs, Jenna runs away before 
Maggie can try to get her help, and is left to raise the child as a surrogate 
mother and an aunt. </P>
<P>Switching forward in time, six-year-old Cody (Holliston Coleman) has been 
diagnosed with Borderline Autism, but Maggie is beginning to suspect she may 
not have that at all, but some genuinely unique gift. In the school yard one 
day, Cody seemingly mends a seriously hurt bird, which eventually flies away 
from her hands. And she always seems to be talking to unseen entities, a 'la 
"The Sixth Sense." </P>
<P>Enter Eric Stark (Rufus Sewell), head of the New Dawn Foundation, a recovered 
drug abuser who has put all of his excess strength into helping others who 
have lost their way in life. Despite being a well-publicized figure, FBI 
agent John Travis (Jimmy Smits) has not yet been able to piece together the 
complex puzzle that links Eric directly with a series of gruesome child 
murders that have been committed recently in the city. And as Black Easter 
(Easter Eve), which is the day Satan is to be reawakened, slowly rolls 
around, it is up to Eric, who has now hooked up with Jenna, to find Cody and 
brainwash her into believing in the forces of evil. </P>
<P>Why, might you ask, do they really need Cody? Hell if I know. It's fairly 
safe to say that screenwriters Thomas Richman, Clifford Green, and Ellen 
Green are the only ones who could ever possibly make sense of this silly 
hogwash. "Bless the Child" is an admittedly difficult film to summarize 
because it is so marred in ludicrousness and overplotting that, to attempt 
making any sort of explanation just leads to more diw-witted twists that need 
to be clarified. </P>
<P>Academy Award winner Kim Basinger (1997's "L.A. Confidential") is an actress 
who has been widely criticized in the past for her questionable talents, but 
even before her Oscar win in 1998, I have always liked her. Basinger brings a 
genuine honesty to her film roles that not many actors can fully attest to, 
and can do comedy just as well as drama. Basinger must have known the trouble 
she had gotten herself into with this picture, then, since she is too often 
overly sincere in her line readings, or looks to have just awoken from a deep 
slumber. Either way, Basinger has turned in one of her most mediocre 
performances to date, in, undoubtedly, one of her weakest films.</P>
<P>Almost everyone plays second fiddle to Basinger's Maggie, and not many 
supporting players manage to stand out from the crowd. Young Holliston 
Coleman, however, is a real find, and dodges all dangers of becoming an 
unctuous child actor. Rufus Sewell (1998's "Dark City") is appropriately 
threatening and makes for a nasty villain, but he is too promising of an 
actor to be wasting his time wading through such inconsequential material. 
The same goes for Angela Bettis (1999's "Girl, Interrupted"), as Jenna, and 
Christina Ricci (1999's "Sleepy Hollow"), who does a professional job with 
her five minutes of screen time, and then gets out while the going is still 
good. Ricci is a fine actress, one of the more promising of her generation, 
so why she chose to appear as a drug addict whose only purpose is to explain 
the plot to us through frivolous dialogue remains a mystery--unless her 
no-doubt meaty paycheck played a role in getting her cast. Meanwhile, Jimmy 
Smits is a crushing bore without anything of interest to do or say.</P>
<P>"Bless the Child" is an amazing feat for a big-budget Hollywood 
horror-thriller. The movie is overblown and highly unsatisfying, completely 
dull and visually dreary throughout, without any provocative characters, plot 
developments, or visual effects (which, by the way, look cheesy), and only 
one suspenseful sequence (set atop a bridge). Director Chuck Russell may have 
done occasionally respectable work in the past, but his luck has finally run 
out here. Russell proves to have no sense of how to film a scene and make it 
work, and drags everything out to the point of genuine nausea. </P>
<P>Rule #1 in the annals of Horror Movie Filmmaking 101 is, "Don't make a boring 
horror movie." Rule #2 is, "Don't make an unscary horror movie." Rule #3 is, 
"The storyline must be brought to life in a way that will make the viewer 
believe in what is occurring." Rule #4 is, "Some visual filmmaking flair must 
be present." And Rule #5 is, "If you realize you've failed on Rules #1-4, for 
the love of God, do not unleash the now-so-called 'horror' movie upon the 
unsuspecting public!" "Bless the Child" falls into the trap of Rules #1-4, 
but as proven by the release of the film, as well as this review, director 
Russell didn't have the good sense to pay attention to the most vital rule of 
all. I think we all know which one that is.</P>
