                        A film review by Jeremiah Kipp

<P>It's a typical day in the life of rambling junkie F*ckhead, whom we'll
call FH for the purposes of this review. He just broke up with his
on-again, off-again heroin buddy and girlfriend, Michelle, stole a car,
drove to the local bar and is getting wasted with his buddy, Wayne, a
burned out husk of a human being and card carrying member of the Undead
Drunks Club.</P>
<P>After several shots of rotgut to wash down the uppers, downers and
endless fuel of smack, bleary eyed Wayne asks FH if he wants to make a
couple bucks to pay for the drinks they're gonna have later (we realize
it's only mid-afternoon by this point.) They meander off to a nearby
house and proceed to rip the copper wiring out of the walls. `Yep,'
Wayne chuckles. `This ought to be worth forty bucks – enough to get
drunk tonight. Heh heh.'</P>
<P>This is only ten minutes of Alison Maclean's whimsical junkie movie,
Jesus' Son, which drifts from one anecdote to the next. Our unreliable,
rambling narrator, FH (brilliantly acted by Billy Crudup), regards
everything he sees with a bemused detachment, whether it be munching on
his cornflakes while Michelle (Samantha Morton) shoots up after sex, or
taking a part time job as a hospital orderly in the emergency room among
fellow pill popping losers who raid the cabinets, desperate for a cheap
score.</P>
<P>We're given a series of episodes in FH's life in the mid-‘70s, and
unlike most films which dwell in this sort of seedy world, it never
judges the lives of its main characters. In fact, FH invites us to laugh
at their pathetic little lives holed up in cheap hotel rooms, passing
the time with sex and drugs, or telling long stories about their failed
love lives and immediate goals of getting wasted.</P>
<P>The characters are lovable without being `quirky', meaning they ring
true. FH encounters several personalities throughout, and each actor is
given the opportunity to shine in honest, lived in performances. Wayne,
the guy who rips the copper wiring out of the walls of what may or may
not be his house, is played by a surprisingly restrained Denis Leary,
for whom most of the fire has gone out. Underneath a sad sack moustache,
Leary gives his most haunted performance.</P>
<P>Just as good is Jack Black, fresh from his acclaim in High Fidelity, as
Georgie, who drives around with FH popping pills as they seek a place to
camp out in the open air one night. He's given the most surprising scene
in the movie after they run over a rabbit on the road, and he whips out
his knife saying that they will feast tonight. This unseemly behavior
transforms into something profound and miraculous in one of the film's
first of many small epiphanies.</P>
<P>While the film doesn't follow the traditional rules of storytelling
(feeling more like a series of faded super-8 films strung together on a
string), the offbeat themes and sketches offer glimpses into a world.
Maclean is attentive to the look of their ragtag, colorful clothes
(including striped yellow underwear or natty brown leather coats two
sizes too big), the gray and empty rooms with filthy beds and noisy
springs – maybe a TV playing in the background if they haven't sold it
yet, and the dreamy cinematography of Adam Kimmel which purposefully
allows certain images to blur or shift in and out of focus like
memories.</P>
<P>The screenplay (and assured editing) move backward and forward in time
as FH tries to sift through his thoughts about Michelle, often going on
long tangents as he stumbles to keep on track. Thankfully, he manages to
take exciting detours with Leary, Black, Holly Hunter and a hospital
encounter with Dennis Hopper, of course, playing a cheerfully grumpy
addict who offers a descriptive and strange tale of a former wife who
shot him in the face years ago.</P>
<P>Billy Crudup takes center stage in the film playing a passive character
with graceful strokes. He's always present in his scenes with the other
actors, listening, eyes roving around nervously and breaking out into
his infectious grin. Maclean found the perfect actor to embody this
lovably clumsy sod who's got one foot on the highway and another in a
puddle. While it ultimately doesn't amount to more than an amusing
shaggy dog story, Jesus' Son is simply two hours in the life of a
F*ckhead, with an eye for details and nuance that reveals the underlying
humor underneath the lives of the sad, the tattered, the broken and the
pathetic.</P>
