<PRE>                                 BLUE SKY
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     The plus side of BLUE SKY is that both principals have roles in
with which they have not been previously associated.  Hank Marshall
(Tommy Lee Jones) is a military scientist who loves his work as a
nuclear engineer.  He also is a kind, tolerant family man whose wife,
Carly, (Jessica Lange) is the sexiest woman on the military base.
Jones as a reserved husband dedicated to both his work and his family,
is a switch from the intense obsessive character he was in The
Fugitive.</P>
<P>     The beautiful Jessica Lange who, in THE MUSIC BOX, was the
attorney who defended her father accused of being a Nazi criminal, is
here a most delightful, uninhibited wife who likes to dress like
Marilyn Monroe and have her hair done like Elizabeth Taylor, does a
sexy dance with Colonel Vince Johnson (Powers Boothe) that makes the
famous dance scene in THE SCENT OF A WOMAN seem like kid stuff.   One
moment she is Bardot, another she is Hayworth.</P>
<P>     So why is the movie not as good as it could have been?  Mostly
because it has a sub-plot about a cover up by the military when they
allow a nuclear explosion to send radiation to people from nearby
locations.   The two stories, the Marshall family and the nuclear cover
up do not blend well together.   The film should have concentrated on
Lange and Jones or the nuclear underground testing (leaving the sky
blue ... as in the film's title) or it should have had more about
nuclear testing. Instead, both are short-changed.</P>
<P>     Fine acting by Jones, Lange and Boothe ... and do not forget the
dance.   Others in the cast are Carrie Snodgrass, Amy Locane, and Chris
O'Donnell.</P>
