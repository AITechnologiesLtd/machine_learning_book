<P>I didn't much care for the original BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. On the whole, I
thought it was boring. To me, it felt like a bunch of kids running around in
their wooded backyard scaring one another with a video camera. I was
frightened by only one scene: the final shot. I did however truly admire
what the film did in respect to movie innovation. It was able to blur the
line between fact and fiction for a lot of people, it managed to
successfully wrangle the power of the Internet and use it to complement the
film and it showed Hollywood that you don't need to spend $25 million on a
star's salary alone...in order to make a successful film. With all that in
mind, I was looking forward to seeing what the second installment had to
offer.</P>
<P>Pre-hype wise, I was once again, extremely impressed with Artisan
Entertainment's ability to harness the up-to-date technologies of the
Internet and put together an extremely cool event called the Blair Witch Web
Fest. The webcast was made to take place over three days, with plenty of
relevant horror guests including the stars and director of the film,
musicians, witches, horror alumni and plenty of chats, goodies and games to
keep everyone entertained. Those who were not able to attend in person,
could simply logon and participate in the chats and "become" a greater part
of the cinematic process. Artisan Entertainment seems to be generations
ahead of the rest of the generic cookie-cutter studio official websites, and
should rightfully be applauded for their avant-garde efforts.</P>
<P>Oh yeah...harumph...now that we've gotten that out of the way...how was the
film, you say? Let's see...</P>
<P>PLOT:
Four fans of the original "Blair Witch Project" movie hop on a tour to visit
the actual locations where the first film apparently took place. Led by a
local psychologically disturbed individual, the fun-loving teens drink and
party all night, only to wake up and find themselves unable to remember a
big chunk of their evening past, and caught in the middle of a ritualistic
murder investigation. Are they all cold-blooded killers? Is one of them a
witch and spooking the others? Are they all innocent but nuts? Does Roger
Ebert actually make an appearance in this film? All very scary thoughts...</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
If you're looking for thrills, chills and plenty of scares...this film is
not for you. This movie is a decent psychological mystery filled with
paranoia and delusions, which messes with your head and demands that you
keep thinking about it, even after you've left the theatre. Not necessarily
an audience-friendly film, but then again, neither was the original. My
initial reaction to this film was lukewarm. It wasn't until further
contemplation that the film struck a chord with me and eventually
ingratiated itself the tag of a "good" movie. But if the boogie-man a la
SCREAM is what you're looking for, you will not find it here. If you're
looking for something similar to the first film, you will not get that here
either. This film is original in its own right, with all of the characters
making reference and working off the events which "apparently" took place in
the first film. They speak about the characters, they follow in their
footsteps, and they too, eventually get caught up in something that's
apparently beyond their simple teen grasps. But is all of this entertaining,
thrilling or even interesting? To some, yes...to others, no.</P>
<P>I enjoyed parts of this film, and didn't care much for others. I liked the
way that the whole movie was shot. Nice style. Good directing. Perhaps too
many flashbacks for its own good, but enough spooky moments to make you
question the events taking place and get into the mystery of it all. But at
some point, a lot of the film's events felt redundant, like they were going
around in circles. Everyone confused, everyone pointing fingers, who did
what to whom? But it isn't until you figure out the truth in the end, that
all of that disorder begins to make a little sense. I won't say any more
because I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone, but suffice it to say that
"seeing is not always believing". Unfortunately for the audience, the film
doesn't really offer up too many clues during the actual picture or graft
out any real solutions, but for those who enjoy the head trips, watch your
step on the way in and enjoy.</P>
<P>I think that the core Blair Witch audience might appreciate this movie, or
those who don't mind sitting through the same film over and over again, just
to uncover its secrets. For most, the film will provide no obvious scares
(cheap or otherwise) or miraculous strokes of terror. But this film is not
about that. It's all about undertones and your interpretation of the events
taking place. Perception, interpretation, reality...all play different roles
in this movie. It's up to you to figure out who is playing who. Not exactly
what John Q. Public generally looks for in a movie, eh? But even beyond all
that, this film managed to keep me interested for most of its way, provided
for a couple of spooky scenes, and did finally manage to re-insert T&A back
into horror films, so even your average moviegoer has to give it at least
that much! The actors were so-so, with decent performances here and there,
over-acting there and here, and the soundtrack, appropriately heavy, creepy
and hip (gotta sell those soundtracks!).</P>
<P>So if you like head-games, enjoy all that supernatural witch mumbo-jumbo and
appreciate films which blur the line between the reality of your mind and
the actual events (think OJ, people!), then you might just really enjoy this
one. A LOST HIGHWAY for the teens. Not a classic, not a bad movie, not a
great movie...but definitely something interesting. PS: Incidentally, don't
ask me what "Book of Shadows" means because that's another thing that the
film doesn't hand you on a platter. You gotta work for this one, people.</P>
<P>NOTE: My appreciation of this film was lifted after I read a bit more about
it after my viewing. Now if you are confused about the film, its characters
or what really happened, and want to achieve a deeper understanding of the
material, I suggest you read some of what the director of this film had to
say here <<A HREF="http://joblo.com/blairwitch2-extra.htm>,">http://joblo.com/blairwitch2-extra.htm>,</A> but please note that it
does contain possible ** SPOILERS **. I would suggest that you read it only
after having seen the film.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Original drafts for this movie included one which had news crews tracking
the original kids and another featuring Heather Donahue's relatives
searching for her remains. But when first-time fiction director Joe
Berlinger got the directing nod (his previous work included three critically
acclaimed documentaries), he scrapped all that aside in favor of a more
radical approach. "I wanted to make a sequel to the phenomenon, not to the
movie."
Berlinger admits that his original cut of the film left the studio asking
him to "deliver scares earlier". Re-shoots took place up to a month before
release, and the director admitted that he was "not entirely happy with how
it was integrated into the movie". Berlinger went on to say, "If we weren't
up against a release date I would have tried to figure out a [better] way.
But all those posters say "October 27", not "Coming this fall".
(Entertainment Weekly, #564, pgs 30-32)
Writer/director Joe Berlinger has also given himself a cameo in this film.
He plays the "Burkittsville Tourist #1" early on in the film.
The creators of the original BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sanchez, did not write, direct or produce this film, but did receive credit
as "executive producers". They are however, slated to collaborate on the
third installment of the "Blair Witch" series (currently envisioned as a
prequel).
The original BLAIR WITCH movie cost $30,000 to produce, cost Artisan
Entertainment $1 million to purchase and grossed $141 million domestically
and more than $109 million overseas. This film cost $15 million.
Several famous TV personalities are shown early on in this film, mentioning
the original BLAIR WITCH PROJECT on their respective programs, including Jay
Leno, Conan O'Brien and film critic Roger Ebert.</P>
