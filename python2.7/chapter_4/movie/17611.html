<P>   Suddenly Shakespeare rocks.  After generations of
suffering students have been forced to pore over the texts of
a language that looks to American teens about a
comprehensible as Tagalog would appear to a Malaysian,
Hollywood has found a way to excite a large demographic
group to the glories of the Bard.  This year alone will see six
adaptations from the great Renaissance writer, including a
version of Othello that takes place on a modern basketball
court.</P>
<P>   "The Taming of the Shrew" is an excellent choice of a 16th
century work to modernize since even in its own day it was
one of Shakespeare's most popular.  Filled with brilliant
language and witty wordplay, "Shrew" has a well-crafted,
easy-to-follow plot displaying the writer in one of his most
antic moods.  As his readers know, "taming" is not the best
word to describe what happens to Shakespeare's title
character, Katharina: "educating" would be the appropriate
term.  Kate is the spirited elder daughter of Baptista, a well-
to-do gentleman of Padua, who storms at her father and her
mild young sister Bianca, and rages against marriage--until
she finds that submission to her husband leads to more
happiness than she had dreamed possible.  The rationale for
"taming" her was a Renaissance belief in balance: life is best
when a woman follows the lead of a man.  When Kate acts
the shrew, she throws the universe out of balance.  A strong
man--Petruchio--was needed to bring the cosmos back to
order.</P>
<P>   This is not to imply that today's America is altogether
different.  Many men and a considerable number of women,
ignoring claims that the female gender is oppressed, actually
look forward to the day that the ideas of Betty Friedan are
reversed and, indeed, current post-feminism has gone a ways
toward bringing the pendulum back to the center.  This brings
us to "10 Things I Hate About You," a title so awkward that I
asked the nice young woman at the box office simply for a
pair of tickets to "10 Things"--to which she responded, "10
Things I Hate About You?"  Duh.</P>
<P>   Despite what you may have heard from critics who either
dismissed the movie as "an insult to teenagers everywhere"
at one extreme and "a film with some jokes that work and
some that don't" as a mainstream version of criticism, "10
Things" is one of the best high-school comedies in years--far
exceeding the so-called wit of "Jawbreaker" and more
involving, even more credible than the campy "I Know What
You Did Last Summer" and its sequel.  Padua High School,
which serves as the story's location (actually filmed in Seattle
and Tacoma) houses richniks who are more plausible than
the spoiled brats of "Clueless."  What's more its central
characters, Heath Ledger in the role of the tamer, Patrick
Verona, and Julia Stiles as the eponymous shrew, Kat, are
easy to look at.  Joseph-Gordon Levitt as the lovesick
Cameron James and Larisa Oleynik as Bianca Stratford as
the shrew's young, nicer sister Bianca, are drop-dead cuties.</P>
<P>   There's nothing terribly original about the plot (we've
already established that Shakespeare dealt with the theme
and he was known to plagiarize from ancient myths and
fables himself).  "10 Things" centers on the worn idea of a
young man's asking a coed to the annual prom only because
of either a bet or an offer of money.  Obviously the boy gets
to like the girl anyway, but when the girl finds out the financial
details, she's turned off.  </P>
<P>   In this case Kat is a stuck-up 18-year-old with a misguided
view of feminism.  She refuses the advances of all boys.  She
is determined to live her life by her own rules, not by those of
her father or of any other man.  Her father, a gynecologist
(played by Larry Miller), knows from pregnancy and refuses
to allow Kat's sister to date, or, at any rate, he permits her to
date only when Kat goes out with a man (which he assumes
will be never).  Younger sister Bianca wants to go out with
the school's conceited heartthrob, Joey, though she is shyly
pursued by Cameron.  Bianca must convince her older sister
to go to the prom and places her confidence in the
handsome, self-assured Patrick.</P>
<P>   A tired formula like this one need not bog a movie down. 
What brings "10 Things" to life is a series of comic scenes,
including a satiric portrait of the school guidance counselor
(Allison Janney) who writes sizzling novels with her laptop
computer on school time and the young English teacher,
(Daryl "Chill" Mitchell) who raps the lyrics of Shakespeare.</P>
<P>   Any young woman with sense in the movie audience would
drool over Heath Ledger, a princely dude with a provocative
Australian accent and root for him to win the affection of
haughty Katarina.  A climactic scene of Patrick's singing with
the accompaniment of the school band "I love you baby" to
the woman of his dreams who is out on the football field
works splendidly.  Larry Miller is terrifically amusing as the
understanding but overprotective father while David
Krumholtz serves well as Michael, who is Cameron's guide--
and our own--to the culture of this affluent school.  "10
Things I Hate About You" easily transcends its hackneyed
plot through vivacious acting, crackling dialogue, and
sympathetic characters.</P>
