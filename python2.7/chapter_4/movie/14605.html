<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>I've never been big on animation, and I'm not sure why.  I've seen some
good animated films (many of which are Japanese, and have interesting
stories in addition to great animation), but I find that my response to
most animated films is the same -- it's interesting at first, and then
my attention begins to dwindle.  I figured that this would not be the
case with Antz, because it has super-ultra-high-tech computer animation,
and also because it has a great assortment of celebrity voices and a
witty script.  In addition, the film clocks in under 90 minutes, and so
it hardly has time to get boring.  </P>
<P>But, for all of its wit and skill, Antz really just reminds me of how
self-centered the human race is:  this is not a story about ants, but a
story about a bunch of miniature humans reacting to an ant-like
existence.  I have an entomologist friend who said the film's science is
well in-place, but that doesn't make me feel better about the fact that
we're not watching ants.  I know, I know, I could go on and on about the
fact that ants don't speak English (puhleez), and that they don't walk
upright on four of their six legs, and so forth.  I'm not so interested
in these little details as I am in the big picture -- I think the film
is a clever cop-out.  It would have been really interesting if the ants
had been more realistically expressed.</P>
<P>Well, I realize I'm subjecting myself to the possibility of getting
labeled as a "lame" critic, because I doubt that anyone out there will
have a similar opinion of Antz.  Don't get me wrong -- it's an enjoyable
film, and often very funny.  Woody Allen voices the main character, a
worker ant named Z.  Z is Woody Allen -- he looks and acts the same way
Allen acts in all of his films.  Z is upset that he's insignificant in
the scheme of his colony, but one day meaning is injected into his life
when he meets Princess Bala (Sharon Stone).  She's engaged to General
Mandible (Gene Hackman), and this greatly upsets Z.  </P>
<P>However, his friend Weaver (Sylvester Stallone) tells him that he can
meet her if he pretends to be in the army.  So, Z takes Weaver's place,
and accidentally ends up in a war with a bunch of termites.  By a stroke
of luck, he's the only survivor, and returns to the colony a hero. 
Soon, however, Mandible realizes that Z is a fake, and Z impulsively
kidnaps the Princess and they head outside, in search of Insectopia,
where ants can live without the constraints of colony life always
keeping them oppressed.  Soon, Z becomes a symbol for liberation in the
ant colony.</P>
<P>If that sounds like a lot of plot for an 80-minute film, you're not
mistaken.  That's one of the nice things about Antz, though -- it never
dwells on anything long enough to deteriorate into mindless boredom or
kiddy-pleasing madness.  In fact, the film is aimed equally at kids and
adults, so parents taking their children to this film won't be left in
the dust (actually, there are a few jokes that will whiz right past the
kids' ears).  On this level, however, there are issues that bother me
about Antz.  First of all, the language is not G-material (several of
the "lesser" expletives, including "bitch" and "crap," pop up
frequently).  In addition, the violence is rather extreme:  the battle
with the termites is disturbingly similar to scenes in Starship
Troopers.  </P>
<P>But I can't deny the film's wry charm, thanks to the array of familiar
voices and a clever script by Todd Alcott and Chris & Paul Weitz.  There
are some terrific cameos, such as a wonderful scene with a couple of
European wasps (voiced by Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin).  The film gets
off to a slow start, but everything that happens outside the colony is
very well-done, both in script and in animation.  In the main roles,
Allen is likable as Z, while Stone has fun giving her Princess a little
bit of sass.  Hackman is perfect for the domineering and evil general,
while Christopher Walken is on-hand as the General's right-hand man.  </P>
<P>I'm quite aware that most readers are likely to dub me as a very silly
guy after reading this review, perhaps as the "impossible" critic who
wouldn't have liked the film regardless of the circumstances.  After
all, I liked the film pretty well, and I'm not denying that it's
well-made and overall a worthwhile investment for pocket change.  But it
left me feeling dissatisfied.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I
was hoping for something that kind of broke away from the expected
little-humans-pretending-to-be-animals cliche.  If this concept doesn't
bother you the way it bothers me, add a full star to my rating and
kindly resist the urge to send me flaming hate mail.</P>
