<P>         Before you spend countless hours at the word processor turning
that great high-concept idea for a movie into a full-length screenplay,
realize that somewhere in Hollywood some other writer has probably had
exactly the same flash of brilliance you did.</P>
<P> Don't believe it? Look at the past few years. In 1998, we had
two epics in which Earth was about to be obliterated by giant rocks from
outer space: a comet in "Deep Impact," an asteroid in "Armageddon." In
1997, two thrillers revolved around murders in the Capitol, "Absolute
Power" and "Murder at 1600." In 1996, there were two extravaganzas about
evil aliens terrorizing the planet ("Independence Day" and "Mars
Attacks!").</P>
<P> And let's not even try to count how many "body-switcher"
comedies there were in the late 1980s.</P>
<P> With "Stir of Echoes" and "The Sixth Sense" currently slugging
it out for space at the cineplex, it would seem little boys talking to
ghosts is the latest trendy topic. But before you dismiss
writer-director David Koepp's "Stir" as a rip-off, take into account
that it was filming at the same time as "Sense" and that it's based on a
novel by Richard Matheson that predates even Stephen King's "The
Shining," which is for many people the last word in psychic-kid
literature.</P>
<P> But now that millions have seen "Sense" (in some cases, more
than once), "Stir" can't help but look like a rehash. Although the
stories eventually take different courses, the initial similarities
between the two pictures are striking and, unfortunately, mostly
unflattering to Koepp's film. "Stir" does, however, have some terrific
performances that elevate it several notches above the run-of-the-mill
spook show, particularly from Kevin Bacon, who proves you need not go
over the top to play a man on the brink of madness.</P>
<P> Bacon plays Tom, a blue-collar Chicagoan with a tough but
faithful wife named Maggie (Kathryn Erbe, an actress who always seems to
find intriguing angles in her characters) and a wide-eyed 5-year-old son
named Jake (Zachary David Cope) who spends a considerable amount of time
in what seem to be one-way conversations with unseen friends. Tom also
has a sister-in-law, Lisa (Illena Douglas), who fancies herself an
amateur hypnotherapist.</P>
<P> At a beer-fueled bash one night, Lisa hypnotizes the skeptical
Tom and is surprised by how receptive he is to her suggestions. Soon
after coming out of the trance, Tom begins having gruesome
hallucinations about missing teeth and missing teens, sleeping 12 hours
a day and guzzling orange juice as if he were at an all-night rave
party. Only Jake seems to have a clue what's going on when Daddy
suddenly decides to dig up the backyard.</P>
<P> Like "Sense," "Stir" works up a convincingly chilly atmosphere
and has a few jolting moments. To his credit, Koepp doesn't rely too
heavily on bursts of loud music or people jumping out of the shadows to
generate cheap shocks. Bacon is outstanding, and Douglas and Erbe do
wonders with their somewhat sketchy roles.</P>
<P> But there are enough odd loose ends in "Stir" to indicate Koepp
(whose screenplays include "Death Becomes Her" and "Jurassic Park,"
among others) was so preoccupied with his directorial chores he didn't
pay enough attention to his material. Subplots about Maggie's pregnancy
and a vaguely creepy cult are introduced with great fanfare and then
abruptly discarded. Even Jake's gift, which seems to be the key to the
whole story, turns out to play only a minor role in the overall scheme
of things.</P>
<P> Ultimately, where "Stir" suffers most in comparison with
"Sense" is in its last reel. "Sense" has a climax that ambushes you and
leaves you dazed. On the other hand, the ending of "Stir" is telegraphed
so far in advance, you won't need a psychic to determine what's in Tom
and Maggie's future. James Sanford</P>
