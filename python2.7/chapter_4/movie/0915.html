<PRE>                                 ONCE AROUND
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Boston Italian family has its problems
     when their daughter brings home as a lover a flashy, boorish
     salesman.  Salesman overpowers the family and tests the
     strength of relationships.  Comedy-drama has more to it than
     it may at first seem.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     The Bellas are a closely-knit Italian family living near Boston.  They
have little oddities but they accept each other and as a family they work.
Then Renata (played by Holly Hunter) breaks up with her boyfriend and
decides she wants to sell condos for a living.  She goes to a sales class in
St. Martin and brings back a lover.  Sam (played by Richard Dreyfus) is an
over-ripe salesman with a phenomenal sales record and some odd Lithuanian
ways.  Sam is welcomed into the family with a big smile that wilts when he
is not looking.  He simply does not fit it.  He upstages family members with
extravangances and he overpowers family events with the subtlety of sales
pep rallies.  As time passes the pressures increase until the family is
seriously in danger of splitting up.  Is Sam a genuinely destructive force
or is the real problem in the family's unwillingness to accept a newcomer
who is do different from themselves?</P>
<P>     ONCE AROUND is directed by Lasse Hallstrom, the Swede who directed MY
LIFE AS A DOG.  Like Louis Malle, Hallstrom has insights into American life
that an American director might miss.  By the same token, however, he misses
details such as the inappropriateness of Hunter's accent.  She is the main
character and she could have really used an accent coach.  Dreyfus is,
however, well-cast, if not too much differently from his role in TIN MEN and
even THE APPRENTICESHIP OF DUDDY KRAVITZ.  The casting of  Laura San Giacomo
and Gena Rowlands as Renata's sister and mother are both fine.  Especially
good is Danny Aiello as Renata's father Joe.  Much of the friction that
makes the story is between the Dreyfus character and the Aiello character.
Joe Bella goes through a lot of changes in the course of the film and Aiello
is a joy to watch.  Also notable is co-producer Griffin Dunne as Renata's
boyfriend.</P>
<P>     Hallstrom has a good eye for the small dramatic incidents of life and
also the daily ironies.  While the film is largely about Sam's
idiosyncrasies, it takes at least one meaning of its title, ONCE AROUND,
from a strange custom of Joe Bella: on important family occasions he
traditionally drives around a traffic rotary.  But for a little heavy-handed
melodrama toward the end, this is a nice comedy-drama worth seeing.  I give
it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
