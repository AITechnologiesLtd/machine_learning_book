<P>Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures (2001) 142m</P>
<P>It was a shame that we had to wait for one of the cinema's greatest 
directors to die before we got this overview of his career, especially since 
this documentary reveals that Kubrick had intended to give some interviews 
to 'set the record straight' after completion of his last film, EYES WIDE 
SHUT.  Nevertheless, there should be enough in its two and a half hours to 
satisfy most movie buffs.  As it's directed by Kubrick's brother-in-law Jan 
Harlan, and features interviews with his sister, daughters and widow 
Christiane, it's reasonable to expect a personal account of Kubrick 'the 
man'.  Instead, the film sticks to its title and presents a chronology of 
his movies, revealing incidental information about Kubrick along the way.  
It adds up to a great homage - as well as a generous selection of clips 
(including his debut documentary DAY OF THE FIGHT), we are treated to rare 
home movies, behind-the-scenes footage and a huge cast list of famous faces 
talking about their association with the director.  The expected film-makers 
make appearances - Spielberg, Mazursky (who starred in FEAR AND DESIRE), and 
Scorsese (reiterating views about BARRY LYNDON from his presentation A 
PERSONAL JOURNEY THROUGH AMERICAN MOVIES) - alongside a few odd choices like 
Woody Allen and Alex Cox.  There's also a surprising contribution from 
composer Gyorgy Ligeti.  Sadly, many of the star players of Kubrick's 
earlier films are no longer with us, leaving Peter Ustinov (SPARTACUS) as 
the sole representative of the old guard.  It's hard not to be satisfied 
with the lineup that A LIFE IN PICTURES presents but it would have been 
interesting to have heard the impressions of  Sue Lyon and Danny Lloyd, the 
only two actors to work with Kubrick as youngsters.</P>
<P>As the chronology progresses the amount of screen time spent on the films 
increases - in effect because Kubrick's work is becoming more ambitious and 
there are more interview subjects at hand.  There is even time spent on 
films that Kubrick didn't get to make: NAPOLEON was pulled from production 
after the poor box-office showings of a rival film on the same subject, 
ARYAN PAPERS was pre-empted and defused a little by SCHINDLER'S LIST, and 
A.I. was eventually handed over to Spielberg after years of development.  
It's as near-complete a filmography (and non-filmography) as you could hope 
for, although Kubrick's ill-fated association with Marlon Brando's western 
ONE-EYED JACKS is noticeably absent.   It's interesting to see not only the 
processes and rationale involved in making each film, but also the public 
and critical reaction afterwards.  As the documentary points out, Kubrick 
became his own worst enemy by having to follow up each successive film with 
something even better.  By the time of BARRY LYNDON and THE SHINING, 
expectations were crushing the productions well before their premieres.  It 
was impossible for Kubrick to be innovative for every new film (which may 
explain the increasing gaps between each new project) but A LIFE IN PICTURES 
also reminds us that his work nevertheless remained unique, copying from no 
other cinema product before it; even a practise as basic as the use of 
established music can be traced back to his incorporation of Vera Lynn in DR 
STRANGELOVE and Strauss in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.</P>
<P>A LIFE IN PICTURES opens with a barrage of newspaper clippings that label 
Kubrick as obsessive and reclusive.  By the film's end there would seem 
little evidence that would suggest otherwise, although Harlan manages to 
create a connection to the warmer side of Kubrick's personality by keeping 
the documentary's tone engaging (the film clips also provide much of its 
humor).  Many anecdotes from Kubrick's family and friends are funny because 
of the popular image of the director as a perfectionist or control freak 
(e.g. one of his daughters produces a set of instructions about the family 
pets that is meticulous to say the least).  The home movies of Kubrick 
goofing around for the camera as a child (in 1940!)are priceless - it comes 
full circle when we see him filming his own children.  Fittingly, it's 
Christiane, who he fell in love with while directing her in PATHS OF GLORY, 
that gets the film's great final line.  A LIFE IN PICTURES is more than a 
homage; it's also a gift.</P>
