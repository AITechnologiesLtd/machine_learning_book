<PRE>                            THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT 1994</PRE>
<P>     Here is a new topic for a talk show: why good filmmakers make the
wrong movies.  Alan Parker, a very talented director who is responsible
for such films as BUGSY MALONE, ANGEL HEART and THE COMMITMENTS, should
be the headlining guest so we can ask what possessed him to make THE
ROAD TO WELLVILLE.</P>
<P>     I'm sure it looked good on paper.  Based on T. C. Boyle's novel and
adapted by Parker, THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE takes place at the Battle
Creek Sanitarium where Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, inventor of the corn
flake and peanut butter, has developed innumerable, bizarre and mostly
quack methods to improve one's health.  As played by Anthony Hopkins,
Kellogg looks like a buck-toothed Teddy Roosevelt and to say he has an
anal fixation would be a gross understatement. A sample piece of
Kellogg's dialogue. "My own stools, Sir, are gigantic, and have no more
odor than a hot biscuit."  How you feel about that line will probably
give you an idea of whether or not you will like THE ROAD TO
WELLVILLE.  Hopkins is good in his role as Kellogg, but despite the
outrageousness of the part, this will not be one of his most memorable
characters.</P>
<P>     Bridget Fonda and Matthew Broderick also turn in decent but
forgettable performances as Eleanor and Will Lightbody, a couple who go
to the "San" to help save their marriage.  Will, who has a bad stomach,
is the film's guinea pig as he goes from one awful treatment to the
next.  Yogurt enemas, bath's with electric current running through
them, and intestinal surgery are just a few of the treats Kellogg has
in store to cure poor Will.</P>
<P>     John Cusack plays Charles Ossining, a young entrepreneur who has
taken his aunt's money to start his own corn flake company.  Problems
arise, however, when his business partner, Goodloe Bender (Michael
Lerner) turns out to be a con-man.  This subplot is completely
unnecessary to the film and slows it down.</P>
<P>     To round out the cast, Dana Carvey plays the mischievous George
Kellogg, one of Dr. Kellogg's forty-two children.  Some of the
film's best moments are the flashbacks of young George and his father.
For no apparent reason, George continually defies his father, driving
the household crazy.  Finally, Dr. Kellogg begs George to stop, which
he does, by dropping his coat on the floor.</P>
<P>     If it were not for these types of moments, THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE
would have been mostly intolerable.  The other saving grace is the
captivating time period.  Production designer Brian Morris and costumer
Penny Rose re-create turn of the century America with enough detail to
make us feel we are there.  We don't have time machines but this will
do for now.  The lighting by Peter Biziou and Gerry Hambling's editing
are top-notch, making this a film of the highest production value.
Parker's direction is as sharp as ever, however, his screenplay drags
and fails to pay off in a gratifying manner.</P>
<P>     The final redeeming attribute is the cinematic documentation of
the erroneous philosophies for good health in the early part of this
century.  When these absurd treatments are performed before our eyes,
we cringe with the thought of how the people of the time could have
been so foolish.  Then again, just recently, there was a book published
that dealt with the benefits of drinking one's urine.  Perhaps in the
next century, someone will make a movie showing how ludicrous many of
our current techniques for better health actually are.  I hope it is
better than this film.</P>
