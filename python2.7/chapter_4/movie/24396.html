<P>   Some spokespersons for the feminist movement have
promised that women could have it all.  They could be
hard-hitting top executives with corner suites on the upper
floors of Manhattan skyscrapers and come home to loving
husbands, kids, dogs and picket fences.  Alas, in most cases,
this was not to be.  Women with MBAs who donned business
suits felt guilty leaving their kids with nannies, and those who
stayed home to take care of their loved ones felt they could
have done a lot more with their lives.  With a script by Ronald
written a decade ago with that dilemma in mind, "Passion of
Mind" gives the predicament a visual, metaphoric
presentation, contrasting the life of a low-key book reviewer
draped in casual threads living with her two daughters in the
south of France with that of a high-power literary agent going
about her fast-moving Manhattan business in smashing
designer clothes.  The kicker is that the two women are
actually one and the same: yet another case of split
personality disorder--investigated in a sluggish, cerebral story
that never springs to life but which promises a payoff that the
more prescient moviegoers could probably predict.  </P>
<P>   The premise designed to serve as a hook for the audience
is the nature of dreams.  As you read these words, how do
you know you that you're not dreaming?  You pinch yourself? 
This does not always work.  Here is my solution: say to
yourself, "Is this a dream?"  Your mere ability to consider that
concept will indicate to you that this is reality.  Dreams may
seem real enough when they are in progress, but that is only
because you have not been able to ask yourself this simple
question.  </P>
<P>   For Marty/Marie (Demi Moore), though, that technique does
not work.  When she falls asleep in France, she has visions
of a separate life in New York, where she looks about the
same and acts pretty much like her double in Provence, and
even runs into the same problems in her romantic life.  When
she beds down in New York, she is soon back in France. 
And so it goes, day after day, night after night.  In a sense
she is not the hapless situation that director Alain Berliner
might presume it to be. After all, how else can you enjoy the
delights of both worlds even faster than you could travel from
one to the other on the Concorde?  Folks in the audience
might be tempted to say, "Live with the problem.  Lighten up
and enjoy yourself--in both worlds.  And don't worry too much
about which is real."  </P>
<P>  In New York, Marty, the literary agent, is gradually falling for
her accountant, the shy, even nerdy Aaron (William Fichtner),
whose idea of romantic pursuit is to make dates to meet in
Central Park on Sunday mornings.  In Provence, the man
who captures Marie's interest is William (Stellan Skarsgard),
who takes an unusual interest in Marie's kids, so much so
that you wonder whether he is feigning this attention to win
his lady over.  Marie's psychotherapist in France, Dr. Langer
(Joss Ackland), is of little help, but her friend, Jessie (Sinead
Cusack), advises her to give in to her longing for love. 
Meanwhile her New York therapist, Dr. Peters (Peter
Riegert), strongly cautions Marty to keep her double life a
secret from Aaron, lest Aaron bolt from a person with an all-
consuming psychosis.</P>
<P>   As a romance, the story displays nothing of the passion
we'd expect from a woman who has been without a man for
years. (Her husband in France had died two years earlier
while in New York she seems to avoid dating altogether.) 
The thirty-seven year old Demi Moore just doesn't fit together
with the older Stellan Skarsgard, who comes across as
avuncular rather than appetitive.  And no woman with any
taste could fall for a guy like William Fichtner who sports an
unusually scruffy beard, the hair pouring down to his neck
without symmetry.  For every woman needing a psychiatrist
to resolve her duplicate life there's another who'd be sensible
enough to enjoy doubling her pleasure--just like the twins in
the old Doublemint gum commercials.  Whether dreaming of
New York of fantasizing Provence, Moore sleepwalks through
this lethargic role in a film whose value lies principally in
Eduardo Serra's picture-postcard shots of the Gold Triangle
area of Gordes, Bonnieux and Lacoste in the Luberon valley
of Provence.</P>
