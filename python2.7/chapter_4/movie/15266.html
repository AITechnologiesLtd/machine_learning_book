<P>THE WATERBOY
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: **1/2 (out of ****)
Hollywood / 1:26 / 1998 / PG-13 (language, crude humor, a bare backside)
Cast: Adam Sandler; Kathy Bates; Henry Winkler; Fairuza Balk; Jerry 
Reed; Larry Gilliard, Jr.; Blake Clark; Peter Dante; Clint Howard; Allen 
Covert; Rob Schneider 
Director: Frank Coraci 
Screenplay: Tim Herlihy; Adam Sandler<HR>After his drippingly earnest turn in last spring's romantic comedy "The 
Wedding Singer," "The Waterboy" finds Adam Sandler up to old tricks 
again, and the surprise is how close this sports send-up comes to 
scoring a touchdown. The ex-"Saturday Night Live" favorite here handles 
an accent not unlike his Cajun Man character and plays pigskin with the 
same bravado he used on the golf course in "Happy Gilmore." He's got a 
love interest, but, just to reaffirm how far this movie is from gloppy 
"Wedding" territory, she can bite the head off a baby gator with just a 
swift jerk of the jowl. </P>
<P>So if these raucous antics will remind audiences of vintage Sandler, 
it's a pity that the star himself doesn't make it to the endzone. The 
crude comic is at his best when he's rough and abrasive, qualities that 
made his turn in "Gilmore" a vulgar delight; his "Waterboy" role, a 
bayou man-child named Bobby Boucher and pronounced Bobby Boo_shay_, is 
naive, soft-spoken and genuinely sweet. What's worse, the movie can't 
seem to make up its mind whether he should be laughed at or felt sorry 
for. Bobby's not the kind of character you'd care to kick while he's 
down. </P>
<P>Thank goodness for some genuinely funny supporting actors, or "The 
Waterboy" would have drowned fast. Kathy Bates, a farce MVP based on her 
stellar work here, is a delight as Bobby's no-nonsense mama, whether 
she's whipping up an extravagant snake dinner (complete with an apple in 
its mouth) or constantly referring to all influences in the world 
outside their swamp-shack home as "the debil" - even Dick Clark. Henry 
Winkler also racks up a hefty laugh quotient as the coach of the Mud 
Dogs, a low-rent college football team on a seemingly non-stop losing 
streak. </P>
<P>Coach recruits Bobby as the Dogs' "water distribution engineer" after 
he's fired from doing the same job for the University of Louisiana's 
oft-winning Cougars. It is then when Bobby reveals a bang-up talent for 
tackling; imagining his opponents are the assorted hecklers and jerks 
who have taunted him all his life is all he needs to flaunt his on-field 
prowess. The plot mechanics are painfully obvious from there, but 
Sandler and Tim Herlihy's screenplay sometimes coats them with a 
deliciously naughty sheen. What they insert into the climactic, 
slow-motion victory montage is a base keeper. It has to do with pierced 
nipples. </P>
<P>The one-joke "Waterboy" almost falters under the same sloppy sentiment 
that crippled "The Wedding Singer," but the amusing combination of 
throwaway lines and outlandish sight gags may prove that Sandler's more 
clever than his creative detractors might claim. That "Happy Gilmore" 
and this diversion are career highs in a career that also lays claim to 
the dreadful "Billy Madison" and "Airheads" might not be saying much, 
but maybe it's not without payoff to hope that Sandler ventures back to 
the recreational arena for his next funny flick. Badminton, anyone?<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"The best possible argument for including [a shot of Bruce] Willis' 
genitals would have been that the movie, after all, contains everything 
else." -Roger Ebert on "Color of Night"</P>
