<PRE>Scream 2 (1997) </PRE>
<P>tag line: "Someone (could it be the producers?) has taken their love for
Sequels too far" </P>
<P>The much over-hyped Scream 2--directed by horror-veteran Wes Cavern (first
known for his Halloween films) and written by the industry's latest hip
screenwriter Kevin Smith---exemplifies the latest tastelessness and greed
of Hollywood franchise movie-making in unrelenting pursuit of the ole
mighty dollar by hitting its Gen-X viewers over the head with its bag of
tired plot twists and hollow characters. For a couple of film makers known
for having a track record for "getting it" in terms of knowing what the
audience expects, Scream 2 shows that Cavern and Smith do NOT definitely
"get it" this time around. </P>
<P>This "must see sequel" begins with the sneak preview of "Stab" with Maureen
McCormick (Jada Pinkett of Facts of Life) and Phil Stevens (Cuba Gooding
Jr.of Jerry Maguire) bitching about how long the damn line is. At one
point, smart-mouth Jada does well to sum up the mood of most of the
viewers, "I don't wanna see some dumbass white movie about some dumbass
white girl being chased by some dumbass killer." For me personally, I don't
wanna see a dumbass movie of any dumbass nationality period! </P>
<P>They finally get inside the theater where we constantly cut to scenes of
"Stab" which is just a poor excuse to use clips from the original movie
Scream. This is just a lame gimmick for the studios to save a buck, last
seen in Back to the Future Part 2 where they used numerous footage from the
original movie. </P>
<P>However, one difference is that they unsuccessfully attempted to disguise
this trick through today's technological advancement in visual effects.
What they do is they CGI the new faces over the original actors face. For
instance, Tori Spelling (of Melrose Place) is morphed over Neve Campbell
(of Party of Five) in the role of Sidney for the movie "Stab." Last time I
checked CGI is pretty expensive...what was Miramax thinking? Did they watch
too many Robert Zemeckis flicks?...this explains the the Back to the Future
Part 2 influence. </P>
<P>The smarter thing to do would've been the old fashion method...hire NEW
ACTORS to play the roles! But again why would Tori Spelling be stupid
enough to accept a part in this sequel when she was the main butt of jokes
in the original. Tori would be the last to wanna play some dumbass white
girl in this movie. No wonder they had to CGI Tori for this film. </P>
<P>Not only does this CGI scheme backfire the studio's plan to save money, but
it also just plain insults the audience's intelligence...what idiot would
not notice the horrible cheesy CGI effects?! Everyone knows Tori does not
look that grotesque on the big screen. Last time I've check, Tori was a
blond bombshell, not some sagging bleached brunnette. </P>
<P>Anyways back to the story...if there is one. Returning in the sequel are
the survivors of the first original horrid horror film: hapless idiot
Sidney (Neve Campbell), superbitch reporter Gale (Courtney Love),
video-geek Randy (Jamie Kennedy), OJ wannabe Cotton (Liev Taylor) and
asinine security guard Dewey (David Arquette). </P>
<P>Also joining them are a crop new stabbing victims up for Ghostface's
picking. They are Sarah Jessica Gellar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Jerry
O'Connel (Stand By Me, Star Trek), Elise Neal (A Different World), and
Laurie Metcalf (Roseanne). These characters are never really developed and
just are brainless cattle that add to the sequels higher bodycount. </P>
<P>And for the plot? Well, being too stupid to take a relaxing trip to Europe,
Sidney and the rest of them decide to go to college where there's nothing
more like calculus homework to soothe one from the emotional trauma of
being almost butchered the previous year. </P>
<P>As soon as the copy cat killer makes its presence known on campus, the
movie shoves its copy cat script of the original up the audience's naive
ass. Instead of a bunch of superficial high schoolers, the movie sets its
havoc amongst superficial sorority gals and fraternity brats whose lives
are already complicated enough with big problems such as finding kegs,
eating pizza, and getting laid. (Lots of change between high school and
college hey?) These characters get so much of the audience's sympathy that
when one is killed by Spookface, yawns from the audience fill the theater
with a great sense of loss (...of attention that is). </P>
<P>Moreover, the sequel constantly backfires on itself by the way it continues
to unintentionally remind the audience of how awful the movie is. In
particular, at one point we watch a scene with a bunch of uptight film
students discussing how awful sequels are compared to its predecessor. Was
the writer and director too oblivious to see this inside joke that we the
audience chuckled at? Why in the hell would you keep reminding an audience
that's watching a sequel that sequels suck? That's like Taco Bell telling
its customers to their face that the burritos they're eating will give them
diarrhea. </P>
<P>To avoid being castrated by the latest Scream fanatic, I won't reveal
details of who gets killed and what happens. You'll just have to waste the
7 bucks yourself to find out. </P>
<P>One thing I can tell is that you don't have to be a psychic to figure that
there's gonna be a part 3 sometime in the near future. </P>
<P>An Idea for Kevin Smith: In "Scream 3," the killers behind the masks are a
fat, four-eyes movie critic and his boney-ass bald partner, trying to
discredit horror movies so they won't have to sit through anymore and then
get their heads shot by Sidney so regular folks don't have to listen their
bitchy and moaning critiques anymore either. </P>
<P>I hope one day Kevin goes back to making witty twenty-something films
instead of writing worthless horror trash. </P>
