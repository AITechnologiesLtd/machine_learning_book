<PRE>Why let death keep you down?
The Mummy</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A "B" movie wrapped in a winding cloth of "A" special effects. Universal
unleashes a film that feels like a ride at its studios in L.A. -- classic
Hollywood hoopla! Hundreds of screaming soldiers on horses, crashing
biplanes, scary monsters, and a wide-eyed Bob Hope kind of light-heartedness
"The Mummy" is not heavy drama ... it's scary-lite.</P>
<P>In ancient Egypt a man is naughty with the Pharaoh's mistress. She kills
herself and they mummify him alive. (You'd think that'd to teach 'em.)
However, much later (1923) an American adventurer (Indiana Jones without the
edgemacation) hooks up with a Hieroglyphics reading librarian and her
brother. Together they sort of accidentally awaken the mummy, whose "soul
mission" is to wreak havoc with its "human race ending" evil.</P>
<P>The crude toughened cowboy whose only knowledge is his experience couples
(in tasty contrast) with the clumsy, but proper librarian whose only
knowledge is theory. Though the film sets itself up rather nicely from a
scripting point of view; once the mummy kidnaps the girl, it isn't too much
more than a special effects vehicle.</P>
<P>What the movie did excellently: Pharaoh's Mistress' costume -- a great intro
to the film. Music - as powerful as were the special effects awesome.
Chuckles -- I laughed out loud more than a few times. And of course, KILLER
SPECIAL EFFECTS. The first appearance of the mummy is genuinely awe
inspiring.</P>
<P>What kept the movie from truly being great: Camels out run horses. A row of
soldiers stands in the line of fire, just to fall dramatically when shot. An
overkill climax that subtracts from the drama. Overuse of a great bugs
visual. And all though Brendan Fraser's first scream at the mummy is
pricelessly hilarious, all others thereafter fall short. But, the hardest
hit to this "big picture" was a cartoon-like plane crash that spanked a
disappointingly out-of-place end to a fantastic special effects sequence.</P>
<P>Though plagued a bit with bugs, "The Mummy" is still a whole heck of a lot
of fun.</P>
<P>Starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz.
Screenplay and direction by Stephen Sommers.
Produced by James Jacks and Sean Daneil at Univeral/Alphaville.
Rated PG-13.</P>
