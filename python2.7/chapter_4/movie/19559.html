<P>"Can a woman trust you?"
"As long as her interests don't run too contrary to my own."</P>
<P>Starring Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo, Denis Leary. Rated R.</P>
<P>The Thomas Crown Affair is a film so well-made technically that it lures
you into thinking that it's actually good cinematically. It's not. But
the movie moves so smoothly that we almost don't notice the fact that it
expects us to believe things that are impossible -- not just implausible
-- impossible. Ridiculous performances and the masqueraded shallowness
of the center relationship might also fly by the less discriminating
viewer. It's like a lemon automobile with a shiny coat of paint.</P>
<P>Besides making the classic actioner Die Hard, director John McTiernan is
also responsible for Last Action Hero, one of the biggest flops in
history. This is his second movie since that humiliating occasion and
even if it isn't very good, he certainly redeems himself as a director
(working on an assumption that he ever needed redemption, which quite
arguable).</P>
<P>In a James Bond-ish performance (surprised?), Pierce Brosnan plays
Thomas Crown, a limitlessly wealthy "finance geek", as one of the
characters naively puts it, to whom there is more than meets the eye.
He's thrill-seeker extraordinaire and a world-class thief; a man to whom
the process of stealing a difficult-to-snatch object is worth infinitely
more than actually possessing it. When he illicitly gets ahold of a
Monet original worth $100 million he gets more than he bargained for:
Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), a clever insurance agent responsible for
retrieving the painting if she can.</P>
<P>Crown loves a good challenge so he indirectly admits to her that it was
he who took the beloved Monet and gets her to date him (why? how?). They
sleep together (hello?) and fall in love (why? how? when?) and that puts
dear Catherine into a dilemma: does she run away with Crown or does she
turn him in?</P>
<P>Aside from the numerous logical contradictions, especially associated
with the admittedly clever climax, the first major flaw that struck me
was the supported notion that Thomas Crown can correctly guess what
everyone around him is going to do. McTiernan's intention seems to be to
define him as an enigma: but this is a full-fledged romance and such
definition is wholly inappropriate. As such, Crown rarely feels human to
us and thus doesn't seem capable of falling in love. If the filmmakers
wanted the romance to work they should have made Thomas Crown a real
person.</P>
<P>Rene Russo's laughable performance doesn't help the situation any.
Constantly leering, comically self-confident, her character suffers from
a similar ailment as Brosnan's except in her case it's the performer's
fault. She's more of a femme fatale than a human being; a superhero
rather than a woman (Inspector Gadget could have used her presence).
Rene Russo is another factor that keeps the romance from ever going
anywhere. It has a fancy coating but it remains shallow and impersonal;
we see two people falling in love but get no insight into their
relationship.</P>
<P>Despite all of the above, The Thomas Crown Affair remains a moderately
entertaining, engaging movie. It's very well-directed and wonderfully
filmed. It also benefits from what is probably the year's best score:
intricate and beautiful, it not only adds excitement to scenes that very
much need it but it also pulls off the feat of flawlessly and
unintrusively supplementing the action even in scenes where suspense,
which a film's score is predominantly and sometimes exclusively used to
emphasize, takes the back seat to another prevalent emotion.</P>
<P>I can't recommend The Thomas Crown Affair, but I can't say I strongly
disliked it either. It's a film by someone who knows how to make films
and does it well. Unfortunately it's deeply flawed (although the flaws
don't come to you until after the movie) and I can't, with a clear
conscience suggest that you see it over some of the far better movies
this summer. But if your debating whether to see, say, Inspector Gadget
or The Thomas Crown Affair, leap for those Thomas tickets or be sorry.
