<PRE>                               JUDGE DREDD
                       A film review by Ed Powell
                        Copyright 1995 Ed Powell</PRE>
<PRE>OVERVIEW
--------</PRE>
<P>     During the Third Millennium (2000-2999 A.D.), the world has
undergone some bad times, and is now a desert wasteland.  In order to
survive, the American people have gathered into four or five gigantic
cities, or megacities.  To keep order in the megacities, the government
is now a police state, and the police are judge, jury, and
executioner.  They are ... the Judges.
     (In other words, a generic action/sci-fi movie.)</P>
<P>     Judge Joseph Dredd, a genetically-engineered man that is the
perfect Judge.  He gets wrongly accused of murdering a TV journalist,
and somehow manages to find and kill the person who actually did it,
causing death and destruction in his wake that no one really seems to
mind.</P>
<P>     (In other words, a generic action/sci-fi movie.)</P>
<P>     Sylvester Stallone plays Judge Dredd.</P>
<P>     (In other words, a generic action/sci-fi movie.)</P>
<PRE>COMPONENT BREAKDOWN
-------------------</PRE>
<P>* Story and plot
        Have a mentioned that this is a generic action/sci-fi movie?</P>
<P>     Actually, there was a plot, and it wasn't too bad.  The story was
above average too.  Not Oscar material, but not too bad.  Whatever it
was, it was better than BATMAN FOREVER.</P>
<PRE>* Writing</PRE>
<P>     The script seems as if it was directly converted from the comic
book format.  The dialogue was stilted at times, but was overall above
average.</P>
<PRE>* Acting</PRE>
<P>     I thought the best actor in the film was Rob Schnider.  In this
film, he had a bigger role than he had in DEMOLITION MAN (which,
oddly enough, also starred Sly Stallone), and he made the film
hilarious when people weren't being shot, blown-up, or insulted.</P>
<P>     Sly conveys the emotionless Judge Dredd well enough (although I
have not read any of the comic books).   The rest of the acting was
average.</P>
<PRE>* Design</PRE>
<P>     The film employed an incredible amount of matte shots and models,
which were of high quality, and conveyed the sense of a dark future
well.  The building models I can best describe as a futuristic,
multi-layer "Batman" style.</P>
<P>     The weaponry, vehicles (especially the taxis), and other props
were quite stylish, and worked well with the film.</P>
<PRE>* Effects</PRE>
<P>     Really nothing special.  Some good computer animation.  A few neat
visual effects.  Buildings blew up real good.  Average.</P>
<PRE>* Direction</PRE>
<P>     Again, average ... nothing special.  Won't win any major (or minor)
awards, but it was adequate.</P>
<PRE>* Family value</PRE>
<P>     *This* is the film's shortcoming.  This is definitely *not* family
material, definitely not for kids.  Rare is the scene where someone
isn't being shot, blown-up, or insulted.  As much as I hate to say it,
take your kids to see POCAHONTAS or something.  And as always, thank
you for not poking my hontas.  :-)</P>
<PRE>OVERALL
-------</PRE>
<P>     If you like fast-paced, blood and gore sci-fi/action flicks, go
for it.  I was entertained for its 105 minute run-time.  This is the
average action flick--entertaining, funny, but not Oscar material.</P>
<P>Produced by Edward R. Pressman, directed by Danny Cannon.
A Hollywood Pictures release.</P>
