<P>I was suspicious about this film's rave reviews before going to see because
it centered mostly around a writer going through a rough period of his life,
and imagined that most critics' love for the film stemmed from their
inevitable ability to relate with the protagonist, rather than the film's
actual merits as a good ol' fashioned dose of entertainment for Joe Q.
Public. Well, I'm happy to report that my suspicions were mostly unfounded
and that, as a writer, I was able to relate stronger to the main character,
but more importantly, as a movie watcher, the film was wholly entertaining
and consistently gratifying.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A teacher whose career as a writer peaked with one successful novel suddenly
falls upon a couple of extremely unlucky days. First, his wife leaves him.
Then, his mistress tells him that she's pregnant. And to top all that off,
his eccentric editor comes to town looking for his latest novel, a book
which he seems to have been working on forever. All the while, the man also
has to deal with a brooding, young student of his who's loaded with
potential but very difficult to get a handle on.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Inspirational. It's been quite some time that a movie was actually able to
make me feel refreshed after a viewing, or simply nudge me into revisiting
my own life under a different source of light, but this movie did just that.
A great film featuring some notable performances all around, an excellent
script which manages to simultaneously entertain and motivate those who fear
that their best days are far behind them and enough interesting characters,
plot twists and surprisingly, laughs, to gently embrace any willing audience
member. I'll be honest and tell you that I was barely intrigued by this
film's trailer, and basically just expected to be bored with the life and
times of a hack writer currently undergoing a mid-life crisis, but boy, was
I ever wrong! This movie didn't bore me for one second, in fact, it only
took a few minutes for it to wrap me entirely within its cozy shell of
wintertime and real-life characters. Their problems seemed genuine, their
reactions all engaging, their emotions running deep and leading to more
questions, a wonderful film to decipher and enjoy.</P>
<P>But besides its inspirational undertow, which drew fuel from the sparkplug
talent of a younger writer opening the eyes of an older, worn man, it was
this film's natural sense of irony and consistent humor that made me love it
so much more. Excellent performances from Michael Douglas and Tobey Maguire
also helped elevate this movie to its superior level, as well as the solid
supporting cast led by the always strange Robert Downey Jr. (whose career
seems to have taken off ever since he went to jail), Katie Holmes and
Frances McDormand. Easily one of Michael's least stock and sincerely layered
performances in years. Of course, it goes without saying (but I'll say it
anyway) that the director of the film is also to be given a lot of credit
for having the capacity to bring this interesting small tale to the big
screen, elevating the level of his cast's talent and giving the film an
absorbing feel and satisfying finale. Please don't go see this movie
expecting to be bombarded by inspiration, because this film is more likely
to invigorate if you enjoy watching good movies about intriguing, real
people with various vices, simply trying to live through their difficult
moments with a general sense of aloofness and determination.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This film includes the last role that Robert Downey Jr. played before
returning to jail on drug charges. Robert claims that it was his father who
introduced him to the arena of drugs, when he offered him a marijuana joint
at the age of 8. Good parenting, ol' chap!
Tobey Maguire's first big-screen role was in 1993's drama THIS BOY'S LIFE
starring his present-day buddy Leonardo DiCaprio. Tobey began acting only
after his mother offered him $100 in high school for him to take drama
instead of home ec. The rest as they say...is history. Tobey has acted with
Katie Holmes before in the 1997 drama ICE STORM (6/10).
Did you all know that director Curtis Hanson, who now commands respect after
his Oscar-nominated and critically acclaimed film L.A. CONFIDENTIAL used to
direct shlocky thrillers? His reign before L.A. CONFIDENTIAL included THE
RIVER WILD, THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, BAD INFLUENCE and THE BEDROOM
WINDOW.
Actress Frances McDormand is married to writer/director Joel Coen, of "Coen
Brothers" fame.
This movie is based on a book of the same name by Michael Chabon. The novel
was transformed to script by Steve Kloves, a director in his own right.
Steve has directed movies on his own, including the Michelle
Pfeiffer-starring THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS back in 1989, and 1993's FLESH AND
BONE starring Meg Ryan.</P>
