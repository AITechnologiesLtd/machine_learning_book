<PRE>                    AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY
                       A film review by Eric C. Robinette
                        Copyright 1997 Eric C. Robinette</PRE>
<PRE>B</PRE>
<P>Starring Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York, Robert Wagner, and
Mimi Rogers.</P>
<PRE>Written by Myers
Directed by Jay Roach.</PRE>
<P>And the award for Resurrection of the Year goes to Mike Myers, who proves
he can still be funny even with a bad wig and teeth that make him look
like Martin Short.</P>
<P>When I first saw the ads for the movie, I thought Myers was going to be
stuck in former SNL cast member movie oblivion. Thankfully, Austin Powers
turned out to be a pleasant surprise because it works as both a
joke-a-minute satire, and a fish-out-of-water story.</P>
<P>Luckily, writer-star Myers still knows how to wear comic stupidity
proudly, and he wisely uses the "throw everything at the wall and see what
sticks" method in this story of a woman-crazl British sws of the 60n't go
ove ftoo well in this day and age.</P>
<P>It's all fairly thin stuff, but Myers clearly loves the mid-60s spy films
he's spoofing, which makes the comedy go a long way. It also helps that I
also love those films and got most of the jokes. Some of those films were
so grandiose and bloated, they beg to be comedy targets, and most of the
time, Myers, who also wrote, hits the bulls-eye.  His characterization of
Dr. Evil as a nervous nebbish who subscribes religiously to the Fallacy of
the Talking Killer and other villainous clichis is especially funny. The
standard gadgetry scene is targeted when a tube of toothpaste, a
toothbrush, and dental floss turn out to be...</P>
<P>Plastic explosive, wire, and a detonator? No-- a tube of toothpaste, a
toothbrush, and dental floss.</P>
<P>The biggest surprise for me was how well the fish-out-of water jokes
worked. Besides offering great sight gags, such as Powers trying to play a
CD on a turntable, the device gives the gags something to hang on, and
even gives the character some gravity. So help me, the relationship
between him and Elizabeth Hurley actually had a little feeling to it.
Hurley herself also proves to play a good straight-woman to Power's
antics, making an effective comic foil.</P>
<P>What helps most of all, though, is the sheer number of the jokes. Because
Myers cracks so many, even the lamer gags, such as the strategic placing
of phallic and globular objects in the "nude scene," are funny because of
his willingness to try anything for a laugh. </P>
<P>It brings to mind the image of Myers as Dr. Evil, with me laying on a
table, with a laughing gas cannon aimed at my head.</P>
<P>"Do you expect me to rave about yo objects in the  nufeancly.</P>
<P>"No, Mr. Robinette of his willingness to try anything for a laugh. </P>
<P>It brings to mind the image of Myers as Dr. Evil, with me laying on a
table, with a laughing gas cannon aimed at my head.</P>
<P>"Do you expect me to rave about your movie?" I ask defiantly.</P>
<P>"No, Mr. Robinette, I expect you to laugh," he responds.</P>
<PRE>What can I say? It worked. </PRE>
