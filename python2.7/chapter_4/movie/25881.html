<P>   Dogs are funny.  They're funny ha ha and funny peculiar.  
Who can resist grinning while watching a Shar-Pei stroll down
a city street, sticking out its tongue when passing the office of
a plastic surgeon?  Who can keep a straight face while taking
in the sight of a terrier digging and digging for nothing in
particular, or the look on the face of a bull terrier who bears a
striking resemblance to its human daddy, or the arrogant
perambulations of an Afghan Hound?</P>
<P>   Funny as canines are, though, people are more bizarre in
every way.  People, too, are funny ha ha and funny peculiar,
and Christopher Guest's movie "Best in Show" is ultimately
not about the parades of pooches that pass across the
picture screen but about the people who are proudly
possessed by the four-legged beasts.  The humans are the
ones who go for the cups, for the blue ribbons.  Each wants
to be the champion, the best-in-show, and like many a
neurotic parent, the handlers and owners live vicariously
through their four-legged friends.</P>
<P>   "Best in Show" centers on the Mayflower Dog show, held in
Philadelphia and modeled after the world-famous
Westminster Dog Show held in February of each year in New
York's Madison Square Garden.  Filmed entirely in Vancouver
with a realistic mock dog-show setup, "Best in Show" proves
that Christopher Guest can get absolutely hilarious
performances from his actors by holding them on the loosest
of leashes and allowing them to improvise their way through
this top-notch comedy.  There's no secret to Guest's
expertise at directing: just choose some of the same
performers you embraced for your previous mockumentary,
the 1997 feature "Waiting for Guffman (about the mounting of
a musical show celebrating the 150th anniversary of Blaine,
Missouri), tell them how to get from point A to point B, and let
them decide how to get there--as though you were giving a
brace of bloodhounds a sniff of a bad guy's clothing and
allowing the lovable creatures to track the felon down.</P>
<P>   While those familiar with dog shows know that the handlers
and owners are for the most part stable people (they come
inevitably from the suburbs), Guest obviously has no need to
show these solid, all-American types, instead taking
endearing aim at the eccentric minority who give the
competition its Purina gourmet flavor.  Yuppie lawyers Meg
(Parker Posey) and her husband Hamilton Swan (Michael
Hitchcock) would be most recognizable to big city dwellers in
the movie audience while conservative menswear salesman
Gerry Fleck (Eugene Levy) and his bubbly wife Cookie
(Catherine O'Hara) represent your typical suburbanites. 
Other idiosyncratic show people include a happy gay couple,
the flamboyant handler Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins)
and his partner, hair salon owner Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael
McKean); and Sherri Ann Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge) as the
zoftig young wife of a senile industrialist (Patrick Cranshaw),
who has hired fellow lesbian Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch)
to show their Standard Poodle.  Others in the side-splitting
ensemble are the straight-laced Kennel Club president Dr.
Theodore W. Millbank III (Bob Balaban), Graham Chissolm
(Don Lake) as the show's chairman, Trevor Beckwith (Jim
Piddock) as the classy co-announcer of the event, and Buck
Laughlin (Fred Willard), whose manic role as the show's
announcer proves  the comedic highlight of the film.</P>
<P>   Anyone in the movie audience who listens to stand-up
comic Fred Willard discuss the events would learn virtually
nothing at all about dog shows but a lot about how many
pounds he can press as a middle-aged man (315) compared
to what he could do in his more potent days (500) plus some
side commentary about his visits to a proctologist.  Obviously
more attuned to what goes on in sporting events involving
only two-legged jocks, he metaphorically describes the
panorama at the Mayflower in terms of baseball and football,
reminding us that when the final competition takes place--
seven dogs lined up with only one to get the cup--we're in
"the bottom of the ninth with the final batter at the plate."  </P>
<P>   While Willard--and not the winning dog--steals the show,
Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara turn out the most riotous
performances of the dog owners.  They, more than any other
couple, play their roles absolutely straight with the
bespectacled Levy (superb as the stiff-laced father in
"American Pie" who wants to explain the birds and the bees
to his hormone-crazed son) being driven nuts by the fellows
he meets who all seem to have dated his vivacious wife. To
add to his misery, his character, Gerry Fleck, cannot dance
because he has two left feet.  Literally.   Parker Posey
impersonates her usual high-strung character, the sort of
urban neurotic that Jane Fonda played in "California Suite,"
bickering constantly with her similarly disturbed husband who
tries to check into the hotel with no balance on his credit
card, having lost the dog's favorite toy to boot.  Their
psychoanalyst back home is the only person who could in
any way be regarded as their friend: he is paid to listen to
how their sex lives are ruined because their similarly neurotic
Weimaraner, Beatrice, glowers at them while they engage in
positions recommended by the Kama Sutra.</P>
<P>   The only suspense in the story rests with the question: who
will take top honors at the Mayflower show?  My own pick
differed from that of the judge, but who needs suspense
when you're rocking with laughter at the film with the most
inventive improvisational dialogue of the year?</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 90 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
