                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>***1/2 (out of 4 = very good)
1995, R, 191 minutes [3 hours, 11 minutes]
[drama]
starring: Anthony Hopkins (Richard Nixon), Joan Allen (Pat Nixon), Paul
Sorvino (Henry Kissinger), James Woods (Bob Holland), David Hyde-Pierce (John
Dean), produced by Clayton Townsend, Oliver Stone, Andrew G. Vajna, written
by Oliver Stone, Stephen J. Rivele, Christopher Wilkinson, directed by Oliver
Stone.</P>
<P>"Nixon" is another epic film by Oliver Stone with a bit of a split
personality. At times it's a  touching drama of a man who had the world in
his hand and still wasn't happy. And at other times it's a commercial film of
espionage, diplomacy, and politics. The final outcome is quite moving at
times, but is held back due to strange storytelling.        </P>
<P>First of all, special mention must be made to Anthony Hopkins who delivers
an outstanding performance as Richard Nixon. He is able to take a complicated
story and simplify it down to one man's struggle for his own happiness. </P>
<P>Nixon came from a blue collar family in California, and there are many
flashbacks to his childhood to give some idea of what made Nixon who he is.
Although his family suffered from tuberculosis, his parents were hard
working, God-fearing people who established tough morals for him. Nothing he
did seemed to impress them that much, and after his father died he didn't
seem to realize that all the work in the world cannot bring someone back. In
his adult life, especially as president, he seems to be suffering from a
terrible case of Oedipus Complex and doesn't realize it.</P>
<P>We'd probably like to think politicians are just like regular people but
we'd be wrong. Stone is usually able to present moods and themes in a clear
manner, but it doesn't work as well here. When Nixon and his associates
debate what to do over possible communists, it seems more like a commercial
adventure movie of sorts, involving lots of conspiracies and strategies (a la
"Clear And Present Danger").</P>
<P>The first two acts seemed interesting as they were pretty much told in a
straightforward manner. However, the third act turns on a dime and becomes
complicated and confusing as it dives into the Watergate scandal. I didn't
know much the before seeing this, and by the end of this film I was just as
confused about it. Still, the steps taken are entertaining and of high
quality. The only problem is its difficult to tell whether the theme is Nixon
as a person, or Nixon's personality as it effected the presidency. </P>
<P>Maybe there's just a little too much Nixon to "Nixon," by the end I was all
Nixoned-out. It's like two films in one: first of his political career and
downfall, and a detailed investigation into the Watergate scandal. Perhaps
its' a little too epic, but who said being the president was easy?</P>
