<PRE>                        HER MAJESTY, MRS. BROWN
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     As in THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, the people in HER MAJESTY, MRS. BROWN
live their lives in straightjackets.  Even the richest and most
powerful among them, Queen Victoria, has rules under which she must
operate that were preordained for her from the moment of her birth.</P>
<P>     So it is too and even more so with those on the queen's household
staff.  Each has a carefully labeled position with strictly understood
rules and regulations.  That most of them are unwritten makes them no
less binding.</P>
<P>     Into this carefully regimented life comes one Mr. Brown.  Based on
historical fact about a relationship -- no, not that kind despite
rumors at the time -- between the queen and one of her servants, the
film has all of the honesty and fine acting one comes to expect from a
British costume drama.  But MRS. BROWN is so much more.  These people
are not mere puppets in some lavish production, rather their emotions
are heartfelt and vivid.  The two leads, Judi Dench as Queen Victoria
and Billy Connolly as John Brown are both candidates for Oscar
nominations, as is the film's director, John Madden.</P>
<P>     The story is set in the long years of Victoria's mourning for her
beloved, dead Prince Albert.  Judi Dench gives a brilliantly
understated performance as the queen.  Her sunken eyes remain downcast,
and she is obsessively serious about everything in life.  During this
period, mealtimes with her large family include little conversation
since one does not speak to the queen unless spoken to, and the queen
is not in the mood to talk.  One lunch finds the only dialog being an
admonition of the queen's to one of the princesses.  "You're not eating
enough," the queen instructs her.  "One must not let vanity overrule
appetite."</P>
<P>     Into this rigid structure comes a man unwilling to live under its
rubrics. The queen has summoned Mr. Brown, "a most dedicated outdoor
servant of Prince Albert at Balmoral," to serve her.  Mr. Brown arrives
and shocks everyone by being so concerned for the queen as a person
that he gives her his unsolicited advice.  The other members of the
staff have unfailing loyalty to the monarchy and would probably let the
queen kill herself rather than commit some faux pas like speaking up at
a non-sanctioned moment.</P>
<P>     Mr. Brown's radical ideas extend to much more than the queen.  He
seizes the head butler's chair in the servant's dining room.  This
causes so much commotion that it looks like the weaker servants may
faint.  Billy Connolly gives a strong performance as the freest man in
the story, but one willing to risk anything to serve the woman who is
his queen.  Others are bound by the structure of their lives, but not
Mr. Brown.  He even tells off the Prince of Wales, played by David
Westhead in the weakest performance in the film.  The prince demands to
see his mother at a time when Mr. Brown has already told him she should
not be disturbed, so he barks at the prince, "Are you deaf as well as
stupid?"</P>
<P>     Taking Mr. Brown's advice, the queen changes her habits.  She
freezes the household, telling them, "Cold is good."  In the movie's
most surprising scene, she goes swimming in the lake.  Not exactly
skinny dipping, she is wheeled in a bathing carriage to the water's
edge.  When she emerges, she is covered from head to foot for her swim.
She even wears a hat.  Only her face, neck, and hands are left
uncovered.</P>
<P>     There are many such wonderful vignettes in the film.  In another,
Mr. Brown and the queen go alone to have dinner with a local working
class Highland family.  The woman of the household curtseys so often
that her whole body seems to be in spasms.</P>
<P>     As you might guess, their relationship as well as the queen's
unwillingness to resume her royal duties caused quite a scandal
throughout the land, but she refused to give him up.  "Sometimes I
think Brown is all I have left of Albert," she reasons.</P>
<P>     Although the two leads carry the picture, Antony Sher is terrific
as a wild eyed and devious Prime Minister Disraeli.  He has a constant
smile as a consummate politician who figures he can turn any momentary
setback to his advantage.</P>
<P>     It is easy to grow to love Richard Greatrex's filming of the lush
Scottish Highlands, but rather suddenly, the picture begins to wind
down.  How the story resolves itself is a bit unusual and not near as
tidily wrapped up as we have come to expect from our films.  More like
real life.</P>
<P>     HER MAJESTY, MRS. BROWN runs a fast 1:43.  It is rated PG for a
little violence, mild profanity, and brief male nudity.  The film would
be acceptable for all ages, but kids would have to be at least nine to
get anything out of the picture.  I strongly recommend the film to you
and give it *** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
