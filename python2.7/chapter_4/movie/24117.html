<P> Featuring the voice talents of Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Armand
Assante, Rosie Perez, Edward James Olmos, Frank Welker. Directed by
Bibo Bergeron and Will Finn. Rated PG.</P>
<P>I'll get straight to the question that was on many people's minds
regarding The Road to El Dorado: is Dreamworks' attempt at traditional
animation on par with the movies the Mouse House is releasing annually?
Well, for what it's worth, I liked it a little bit better than Tarzan.
It's certainly nowhere near as satisfying as some of Disney's previous
efforts. Still, this amiable little cartoon is an enjoyable diversion
even if it isn't (and it isn't) the animated masterpiece that
Dreamworks' CGI Antz was.</P>
<P>Essentially a cartoon version of Ridyard Kipling's "The Man Who Would
Be King," which was itself made into a movie starring Sean Connery in
1975, The Road to Eldorado tracks the adventures of Miguel (Kenneth
Branagh) and Tulio (Kevin Kline), two resourceful crooks looking for
adventure. They spend their days scamming passers-by out of their money
by playing craps with loaded dice and each feigning innocence when
discovered. In one of these craps games, they win a treasure map. With
nothing to lose and apparently a lot to gain, they stowaway on a boat
heading in the general direction of the destination indicated on the
map. Unfortunately, the ship happens to belong to one of Spain's most
militant explorers who finds the two crooks and throws them in the
dungeon.</P>
<P>With the help of one very groovy horse, Miguel and Tulio escape and
wind up in the New World -- exactly where they were heading in the
first place. Following the map, they discover El Dorado, a.k.a. the
City of Gold, whose residents along with the benevolent chief (Edward
James Olmos) and the malevolent High Priest (Armand Assante) are
convinced that Miguel and Tulio are gods. The con men play that for all
it's worth, of course, hoping to sail away in a brand new boat and with
a hefty load of gold to boot. But they can't do it without the
involvement of a scheming young woman (Rosie Perez) who discovers
Miguel and Tulio's plan and blackmails them to let her in on it.</P>
<P>The Road to El Dorado is thoroughly watchable and thoroughly harmless.
Much like Tarzan, the songs here are mostly kept in the background
(with one noticeable exception), keeping the film from being a full-
fledged musical. This is probably a wise choice: perhaps the biggest
criticism of the last few Disney 'toons was of the showtunes that
relentlessly permeated the action. When done well, they can get stuck
in your head (like every song in The Lion King) but when the
songwriters whiff it, they are at best forgettable and at worst
irritating. El Dorado sort of skirts the issue by making the songs
background music.</P>
<P>Kevin Kline is a wonderful voice talent with unbeatable deadpan
delivery. As Tulio, he more than makes up for the fact that Branagh as
Miguel is more than a little dull. Branagh simply fails to do anything
distinctive with his character. Kids need specific little quirks or
catchphrases to remember characters by and the movie, along with the
actor, fails to provide them for one of its protagonists.</P>
<P>Other than that, the film is well-intentioned and it mostly succeeds.
The adventures are fun, Rosie Perez is funny, the villain is
sufficiently menacing to make the young 'uns hate him and cheesy enough
to make adults chuckle. My one question: why did Dreamworks insert
skinny-dipping scenes and profanity to make the film PG instead of G?
It doesn't make any sense and if anything, it probably hurt the movie's
box-office.</P>
<P>The Road to El Dorado is hardly the Road Less Traveled, but it's decent
while it lasts. Not everything has to be for the ages.</P>
