<P>Clever Storytelling Behind "Sliding Doors"</P>
<P>Did you ever wonder what might have been if you had just made it through
the intersection before the light turned red?  Made it on to a bus just
before it left?  Made it on to the train just before the sliding doors
closed behind you?  How might your destiny change in a moment's time?</P>
<P>For Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow), her future will take on two completely
different paths determined entirely in a split second.  And the audience
gets to see them both.  If she catches the awaiting train, she will go
home to her boyfriend, Gerry (John Lynch) who is a meek bloke and an
uninspired novelist.  She will also catch him in bed with his old
girlfriend, Lydia (Jeanne Triplehorne).  If she misses the train, she'll
wind up hailing a taxi, becoming the victim of a mugging, and returning
home too late to discover Gerry's infidelity.  In essence, what we will
see are two parallel stories, and so the question you have to ask is
whether both of them are interesting.</P>
<P>In Scenario 1 (she catches Gerry and Lydia in bed), Helen will meet up
with charming James (John Hannah), with whom she will eventually fall in
love.  They are a likable couple and their developing bond is engaging.
He inspires her to start her own company and take control of her own
life rather than sacrificing it all for Gerry.  Scenario 2 (she comes
home too late) is a little more convoluted as Gerry goes to great
lengths to hide Lydia's presence despite Helen's growing suspicions.
Comparing the two timelines, the love story is by far more enjoyable and
cute because you could sense the chemistry between Helen and James.
Their story was engaging.  But in the other scenario, I couldn't quite
understand Gerry's fatal attraction to Lydia.  His constant efforts to
hide Lydia's existence from Helen seemed more like comedic foolishness.
For example, when Helen arrives home just after Lydia leaves, a
surprised Gerry leaps onto a pillow to remove Lydia's earring which was
left behind.  Then, he darts over to the dresser to hide one of the
brandy glasses that the two were using.  All the while, he is nervously
trying to deflect any suspicions.  Helen is far too smart for this kind
of defense.</P>
<P>"Sliding Doors" is a cleverly constructed story that is far more
complicated and impressive in structure than in content.  The movie is
edited well, making a smooth transition between the two timelines.   It
is easy to tell which scenario we are watching and despite the constant
switching, we do not lose focus as to what's going on.  Hannah is
charming and Paltrow delivers a very competent performance and carries
the weight of this movie on her shoulders with confidence.  If only the
material was worthy of her efforts...</P>
