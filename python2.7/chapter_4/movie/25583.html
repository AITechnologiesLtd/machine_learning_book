<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Cheryl Draper (Barbara Stanwyck) can't fall asleep and is disturbed by
the wind, when she goes to close her window she sees in the apartment
across the courtyard Albert Richter (George Sanders) choking a woman to
death. She phones the police, but when Lieutenant Larry Mathews (Gary
Merrill) and his partner Eddie Vincent (White) arrive to question the
historical writer and ex-Nazi accused by Cheryl, there is no body.
Richter removed the body to an empty apartment on the same floor before
the police arrived.</P>
<P>The detectives are satisfied that no murder took place after questioning
him and tell Cheryl that she must have made a mistake, or dreamed what
she saw. But Cheryl feels the police have not investigated thoroughly,
and sticks to her story that she saw a murder.</P>
<P>This well-crafted suspense film will emphasize the familiar noir devices
--- a witness to a murder is not believed, the innocent witness becomes
a victim to the city's indifference, and the authorities side with the
murderer and ignore her pleas as being hysterical.</P>
<P>Richter killed his secret lover because she threatened to interfere with
his upcoming marriage to a wealthy society woman. When he sees that
Cheryl snoops around the empty apartment and finds an earring there
which she turns over to the police, he decides to turn his attention on
her.</P>
<P>Larry, who is a bachelor, studying to become a lawyer, is attracted to
the single witness, who works at Sloane's as an interior designer. But
he tells her there is not one shred of evidence for him to do anything,
and after tracing the earring to Richter's deceased wife, he even clears
the suspect of that suspicion. He talks Cheryl into doing the sensible
thing and forget about it.</P>
<P>But Richter can't forget about the threat he perceives from the witness.
He visits her apartment and fixes her doorlatch so that he can open it,
and then returns when she is not home to type up some letters accusing
him of murder. He will bring them to the captain, Larry's superior, and
the captain will put Cheryl under mental observation, where she spends a
brief time at the mental hospital ward until Larry frees her.</P>
<P>The story becomes too melodramatic for even these fine performers to
bring credibility to it. The climax comes when Cheryl is driven to face
Richter, as she sees him buying up all the newspapers at a stand and
realizes that there is a story in all the papers of a missing woman who
is found dead. When she confronts Richter with the knowledge that she
now knows the name of the victim, he goes into a Nazi spiel and becomes
a stereotypical evil depiction. The film culminates as Richter tries to
kill Cheryl as she runs from him into a construction site and Larry
arrives to fight Richter off and fatally pushes him off the roof of the
building.</P>
<P>The camerawork of John Alton is the star of this vehicle. He sets a dark
mood of the Los Angeles scenario, escalating the dramatics with shadowy
building shots. The twist in the story is, that as upstanding a citizen
as Stanwyck is, the authorities still side with the Nazi Sanders. The
noir theme of alienation is richly furnished, but the film had too many
scenes that stretched too far afield in disbelief for it to have the
necessary flow in it to sustain the tension. Stanwyck was just too
strong a character to be so completely victimized, so the film became
more symbolic than a real flesh and blood story.</P>
