<P>Making a movie out of a video game is a pretty bad idea.  We've seen
numerous critical and box office failures that began as depthless video
games (how can a video game really have depth?) and resulted in
depthless movies.  Making a movie about a video game -- now that's a
different story.  As technology progresses, video games are getting more
advanced and immersive, and the political and ethical questions
concerning our urge to lose ourselves in virtual reality is in full
swing.</P>
<P>Of course, David Cronenberg's new film, eXistenZ, is the fourth movie
in the last two months (and the third in the last two days) to deal with
an aspect of this theme.  The other films -- The Thirteenth Floor, Open
Your Eyes, and The Matrix -- range from bad to wonderful, but they all
tackle the virtual reality craze from a slightly different angle. 
eXistenZ is the first to do it using video games as its theme, and one
could easily make the argument that Cronenberg's movie is the most
pointedly critical of the bunch.  It's also the most blatantly strange,
and the most sexually perverse.  And while I disagree wholeheartedly
with many of Cronenberg's claims, I found myself entranced and delighted
with just about every scene of his movie.</P>
<P>eXistenZ is the name of a computer game created by Allegra Gellar, an
abrasive character played by the fearless and mesmerizing Jennifer Jason
Leigh (she forfeited her role in Eyes Wide Shut to make this film, which
impresses me).  During the trial run of eXistenZ, an assassin attempts
to assassinate her, and she's taken off by Ted Pikul (Jude Law), her
bodyguard-in-training.  While on the run, they meet with several people
who are anti-video games, and who attempt to kill Allegra and destroy
her game.  Fearing that her game is moribund (the pod which houses the
game seems to have consciousness), she decides she needs to play
eXistenZ with someone friendly -- namely Ted, who has no interest in
doing so.  Naturally, they enter the game, and things unpredictably
progress from there.  </P>
<P>eXistenZ is worthy of Cronenberg's name.  Aesthetically, the movie is
just plain strange.  The extended metaphor between sex and the game is
anything but subtle; the pod I mentioned earlier is organic and pulsates
with orgasmic pleasure whenever it's used.  Players jack in to the pod
by using a phallic umbilical cord inserted into a suggestive bio-port in
the spine (you must be fitted with a bio-port in order to play the
games).  And though I found the sexual imagery to be in fairly bad
taste, I had no problem soaking it up with silent satisfaction.  The
movie looks just right, with bland colors and appropriately perfunctory
sets.  Howard Shore's musical score is superb, using deep stringed
instruments the way they're meant to be used.  And I love that the film
is set in the vague future; it gives the story a degree of dreadful
believability.</P>
<P>The film is artistically advanced, and Cronenberg does a splendid job
of creating a world that really feels like a video game.  I have more
than passing knowledge of the history of video games (I was once a
zombie at the mercy of my Nintendo), and so I was right at home in the
world of eXistenZ.  There are details in this game world that could have
only been inserted by someone familiar with the way games work -- the
arbitrary nature of the plots, the one-note characterizations, the way
key figures in the story loop mindlessly when they're not being spoken
to.  When it focuses on these elements, the film is really quite funny. 
I love the scene in the Chinese restaurant, in which our heroes are
forced to compose a bone gun out of mutated amphibian parts, shortly
before shooting the Chinese waiter for plot-progressing reasons.  The
film also features an array of wonderful actors, including Leigh, Law,
Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Christopher Eccleston, and Sarah Polley.</P>
<P>eXistenZ is most compelling and also most frustrating on a thematic
level.  The basic idea is nothing particularly new -- we've all heard
the argument that the closer we get to virtual reality, the further we
get from true reality.  Then there's the question, "What is reality,
anyway?"  Cronenberg isn't interested in these over-explored ideas.  He
just wants to show us what happens when people become incredibly
obsessed with a life that isn't theirs.  But I was mildly disappointed
with the end of the film, for it creates more questions than it answers,
and Cronenberg doesn't drop enough hints throughout the film for us to
figure out what really happens.  And I was annoyed with the insinuation
that video games lead to mindless violence.  A few months ago, when the
media found time to drool over the massacre in Littleton, Colorado, I
found myself enraged at the screenshots of Doom (a popular and violent
video game) and the implication that playing games like this makes you
shoot real people.  </P>
<P>I digress.  Even though the ending isn't quite satisfactory,
Cronenberg's eXistenZ is an artistic success and an
intelligently-constructed argument against virtual reality.  As we
approach the end of the millenium, we're going to be seeing a lot more
movies like this one -- films that inspire paranoia and breed neurosis. 
But this whole "Is it real or not?" genre is starting to grow on me. 
Perhaps we'll be spared the displeasure of more films based on video
games; instead, we'll be subjected to movies about video game
programmers who can't tell if they're in the real world or the virtual
world.  If these movies turn out to be as fun and imaginative as
eXistenZ, I won't have any problem buying in to them.</P>
