<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>        In the spring of 1999, a whale beached itself on the
shores of sunny California.  The whale was dead as a
doornail... there was nothing anyone could do about
that.  The question became this: what do we do with
its body.  The State Troopers were in charge of this,
and they decided that the best thing to do would be to
blow it up.  The event was naturally something that
the media decides to drop by for.  In fact, not only
are the TV crews there, but everyone is there.  So the
State Troopers, they rig this big tub of blubber with
several tons of TNT, and wire it to blow.</P>
<PRE>        They blow up the whale.  Everyone cheers...</PRE>
<PRE>        … and then the fit hits the shan.</PRE>
<P>        Huge pieces of whale fat are flying through the air. 
It's pandemonium.  People are running for their lives.
 The fat is so big, that one piece crushes a nearby
Volkswagen.</P>
<PRE>        This is the kind of material you should expect going
into Magnolia.</PRE>
<P>        Although no whales fly through the air, another
animal (in both the funniest and most bizarre sequence
I have seen all year) does.  You see, in Magnolia,
writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson would like us to
believe that this kind of thing happens all of the
time.</P>
<P>        The film Magnolia can be described as a series of
loosely interlocked narratives that demonstrate how
utterly surreal life is.  In Magnolia, we have 12 main
characters and 9 interlocking stories.  These stories
all play themselves out over a 24-hour period in the
San Fernando Valley.</P>
<P>        For those of you who immediately think Short Cuts
when I mention this, please don't.  There are two
major differences.  The first is that Short Cuts took
place over a weekend.  The second is that Short Cuts
was boring and drawn out.  Magnolia is as quick and
funny and touching as the stories it tells.</P>
<P>        Anderson handles his film with a steady hand that
this promises to be his best film ever… despite its
three hour running time.  It also promises to be his
most bizarre… and this is talking about the guy who
directed Hard Eight and Boogie Nights.</P>
<P>        Magnolia features several completely odd sequences an
moments, the first of which is a football-play-like
description of a suicide-turned-homicide (a man jumps
off a roof, only to be shot in the chest on the way
down.).  The second bizarre sequence is when every
different character of the film sings along to the
same song, despite the fact that the song is not
playing on any radio and the characters are all in
different locations.  The third is the crowning
achievement of the film, a series of moments that I
cannot adequately describe nor convey the greatness
of.  To say one thing about the film though, it is the
oddest thing I have seen all year and it kept me up
until 3:00 AM thinking about it.</P>
<P>        The largest question with the ensemble cast of
Magnolia is this: to whom will the academy awards go
to.  Nearly every actor and actress in the film
deserves an award for his or her work.  Basing my
predictions on the love of the Academy for
over-the-top performance, I predict a nomination for
Tom Cruise, who plays a man who makes his money off of
a program called "Seduce and Destroy."  To imagine the
character, picture Fight Club's Tyler Durden when he's
really horny.  Also, begging for an award is Julianne
Moore, who has already garnered two Golden-Globe
nominations for her works in The End of the Affair and
An Ideal Husband.  Moore plays a woman who has fallen
in love with the rich millionaire who she married for
money… right while the man is on his deathbed.</P>
<P>        The only thing that Magnolia has to its discredit are
the speeches that Anderson placed in the film.  Every
time that one character opens his mouth, be ready for
a five-minute talk, because sooner or later, that's
what you'll get.</P>
<P>        As always, my top five fills up fast come December,
and this film takes Eyes Wide Shut's place as the
second-best film of the year.  It trails right after
American Beauty, by the length of a pin.<HR>James Brundage
