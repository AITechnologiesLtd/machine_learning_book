<P>Deadlines should almost always be important in thrillers, and never in 
comedies. Yet screenwriters insist on letting all kinds of plots depend on 
them; not to provide suspense, because we know Hollywood heroes always get 
wherever they need to be in the nick of time. Nor to show how the characters 
react to the pressure, because it's usually just an excuse for gags. Only, I 
guess, because it's what they were told to do in screenwriting class.</P>
<P>"The Bachelor" is an excellent example, a film with a lot of good ideas that 
never sits still long enough for any of them to work. It should be a romantic 
comedy about a young man learning the value of true love, but wastes a lot of 
time showing him running around trying to beat the clock. He is Jimmie 
Shannon, the manager of a successful pool-table factory, who is in love with 
the perks of being affluent, youthful and unmarried.</P>
<P>But Jimmie (Chris O'Donnell) is getting anxious that he may have to give up 
this lifestyle. Now that almost all of his friends are married, and he's been 
dating the lovely Anne (Renne Zellweger) for three whole years, it occurs to 
him that she expects him to follow suit. He tries to pop the question, but 
obviously his heart's not in it, and Anne becomes so offended that she gets 
on the first train out of town for time alone with her understanding sister.</P>
<P>Then Jimmie discovers that his recently deceased grandfather (Peter Ustinov) 
has bequeathed $100million to him on the condition that he gets married by 
six o'clock on his thirtieth birthday. Wouldn't you know it, this news 
arrives on the day before, so it's a race against time for Jimmie's friends 
and lawyers to find Anne. In case they don't, Jimmie must seek out all his 
other ex-girlfriends to see if any of them are prepared to be his bride.</P>
<P>As he takes this wild journey through his past, which doesn't produce any 
favourable results, Jimmie of course comes to appreciate how much Anne really 
means to him. I wish it could mean something to the audience, but in a huge 
storytelling blunder, the couple's three-year history is spent entirely 
off-screen. Thus, we've only ever seen them when they've been fighting or 
awkward with one another, and we have no idea if we like them enough to want 
them to be united. O'Donnell and Zellweger are both attractive performers -- 
why aren't we allowed to find out whether or not they have any chemistry 
together?</P>
<P>Probably because the filmmakers have no confidence in any of their material, 
and perpetrate disastrous attempts to spice it up. The awkward climax 
features hundreds of people in expensive set-pieces, but isn't at all 
exciting or funny. Special guest stars such as Brooke Shields, Mariah Carey 
and Jennifer Esposito have been brought in to play the ex-girlfriends, but 
their presence is distracting. Even the beginning of the movie, which 
features a narration of potentially witty observations about bachelorhood, is 
ruined by a stupid special-effects accompaniment. Matters are not helped by 
O'Donnell speaking in a deliberately goofy manner to underline the fact this 
is a comedy.</P>
<P>It is Ustinov, though, who gives a really embarrassing performance, as a man 
with unexplained oddities of body language and speech. Hal Holbrook is pretty 
dreadful too, drifting in and out of an Irish accent, and chain-smoking 
cigars with the amateurish trepidation of a kid taking his first drag.</P>
<P>Aside from that, "The Bachelor" is an easy-to-watch film that held my 
attention. The soundtrack is wonderful, the structure is clear, the people 
and places look good. But all the way through I kept thinking that it could 
have been better, and wishing it would stop getting side-tracked by gimmicks. 
I must track down "Seven Chances", the Buster Keaton film it was inspired by. 
It was made in the 1920s, when they knew how to tell a story 
straightforwardly.</P>
