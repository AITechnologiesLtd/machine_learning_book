<PRE>"Somebody STOP me!"
        - Jim Carrey</PRE>
<P>     This thin-but-amusing adaptation of the Dark Horse comic book is
closer in spirit to BEETLEJUICE than BATMAN, though it *really*
resembles the third segment of TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE.  By Joe
Dante.  Pet Detective Jim Carrey stars as a mild-mannered bank clerk
who dons a mystic mask to transform into something wilder and hipper
than Jerry Lewis *ever* imagined.</P>
<P>     The concept is canny enough: a green-faced, yellow zoot-suited
superhero be-bopping around and just generally causing mischief in the
dark, edgy city of Edge City.  Complete with nifty matte painting ala
BATMAN.  Said mask is discovered by a diver, floats to the surface, and
is finally found by repressed-but-still-a-nice-guy bank clerk Stanley
Ipkiss (Carrey).</P>
<P>     (Though, frankly, Jim Carrey is pretty soggy as a milquetoast.
But *we* know he's the hero-to-be and that's all that counts, anyway.)</P>
<P>     The fun comes when Stanley tries on the mask and is transformed
into a living cartoon character, just like the ones he like to watch
after work.  Stanley spins like the Tazmanian Devil and bounces like
Woody Woodpecker, to name a few.  The twist is that Stanley Ipkiss, aka
The Mask, is not a goody two-shoes and he ends up doing some of his
*own* dirty deeds that set both the cops *and* the crooks on his yellow
tail.</P>
<P>     Viewers still recovering from ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE can
relax; THE MASK is not a Jim Carrey vehicle, per se.  The rubber-faced
actor actually exerts *some* self-control over the course of the film
and that's good news because Carrey can be a bit much to take.  (Even
Robin Williams and Jonathan Winters work within boundaries.  For
Carrey, there *are* no rules.)</P>
<P>     Though the comic is clearly captivating, the real star is/are the
(literally) eye-popping special effects that allows Carrey to stretch
and contort into shapes previously only permitted for cartoon
characters.  Too bad that too many of the gags-- such as Carrey turning
into a whistling wolf-- go on too long.  THE MASK needs twice as many
gags in half the time.</P>
<P>     There are two dance routines, though, that are pretty fun,
including Carrey as "Cuban Pete" in a sequence that recalls the "Banana
Boat Song" from BEETLEJUICE.  And don't miss a dog who's a better
scene-stealer than Eddie from TV's "Fraiser."</P>
<P>     Production values are all surprising strong-- notably in the sound
department-- but the story doesn't have either an edge or an
interesting subplot to speak of.  There's noir to run from a bad
"B"-movie menu of supporting characters including a siren (Cameron
Diaz), a gangster, a rasping Mr. Big, and a smart-mouthed cynic cop
(Peter Reigert).</P>
<P>     Most disappointing are too many obvious references to animator
extraordinaire Tex Avery.  Subtly, where is thy sting?</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:    A must-see for Carrey fans; a manageable matinee for
                the rest of us.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B-</PRE>
