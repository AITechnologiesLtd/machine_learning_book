<PRE>                  LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS
                      A film review by Bradley Null

<P>LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS has been described as the British
PULP FICTION, and on the surface, that would seem like an accurate
depiction.  It's got the usual cross-section of characters with witty
tongues involved in varied illegal activities, that get themselves into
very peculiar situations in which no one really survives unscathed. 
Nonetheless, the film seems to be missing something that characterized
its predecessor.  And right now, you're getting the feeling that I'm
about to quickly file LOCK, STOCK as another Tarantino homage/copy-cat
crime, but that's not quite it either.</P>
<P>LOCK, STOCK is in fact, probably the best film since PULP FICTION in
which there are no really good guys.  Like PULP FICTION, LOCK, STOCK
begins with what would seem to be a simple story, that quickly careens
out of control.  In this case, four buddies; Tom, Eddie, Bacon, and
Soap, pool their money together to back can't lose Eddie at an
unbeknownst-to-them rigged game of cards.  Of course they get fleeced,
and end up in heavy debt to the local heavy.  What follows is a madcap
plan to recoup the money by intercepting a heist Eddie has fortuitously
discovered his neighbor is carrying out.  The interrelation of the
problems with the original heist, along with the interception of it by
Eddie's gang, and a couple of other local illegal activities result in a
frantic circle of destruction.</P>
<P>Though the web of illegal activity is obviously reminiscent of PULP
FICTION, where LOCK, STOCK most significantly strays from its de facto
blue print is in theme.  In Tarantino's masterpiece, the theme was
essentially that there was no theme, no morality.  In the gritty
underworld, outcome is random.  While Samuel L. Jackson is divinely
saved and given a second chance to "walk the earth like Kane in Kung
Fu," his partner in the guise of John Travolta is sentenced to death on
a toilet.  In this incarnation, the badder they are, the worse their
fate seems to be, which often is death.</P>
<P>The real question now, is why have I rambled on without making much
comment on the quality of the movie.  The answer of course, is that I
don't have much to say.  LOCK, STOCK is end the end one of those films
that pretty much leaves you when you leave it.  You can talk about the
witty plot, and the funny lines, but in the end, I guess a movie with o
one to really root for (I guess we do root for our four pals a little)
leaves you in the end without too much invested.  So we leave it like we
left PULP FICTION before it, by walking out of the theater and saying,
"Wow, that was pretty cool," and not thinking of it after that.  (Of
course, as with PULP FICTION, some could always take a deeper shine to
it.)</P>
