<P>Director Scott Hicks' visually stunning follow-up to the Oscar-nominated
Shine appears, on its surface, to be a simple murder mystery.  Instead,
Snow Falling on Cedars is an intricate tale of forbidden love, humanity,
integrity and decency.  Based on the best-selling novel by David
Guterson, Cedars is hauntingly beautiful, using long takes and close-ups
that show the story more than telling it.</P>
<P>Set in 1954 San Piedro, a tiny fishing village north of the Puget Sound,
Cedars opens aboard a ship on a particularly foggy evening.  The
fisherman, a meticulous, by-the-book sailor, is found the next morning
washed up in his own fishing net and with multiple stab wounds.  His
accused killer is Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), a young man born in
America but of Japanese descent.  The murder and incarceration of Kazuo
reawakens both the prejudices of the small town's white population, with
Pearl Harbor still fresh in their minds, as well as reminding those of
Japanese ancestry of their imprisonment in internment camps the previous
decade.</P>
<P>Cedars' story concentrates on the aftermath of the death and subsequent
trial, which are some of the finest courtroom scenes ever filmed.  But
the strength of the film is its unusual narrative structure, offering
numerous flashbacks to several different periods in the history of the
town.  Some are directly related to the trial, while the majority of
these flashbacks concentrate on the childhood relationship between
Kazuo's wife Hatsue (Youki Kudoh, Mystery Train) and the son of the
town's newspaper owner, Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke, The Newton Boys).</P>
<P>Playmates as children, Hatsue and Ishmael grew closer and closer as the
years passed.  Knowing that she was forbidden to date white boys, the
two are forced to relegate their burgeoning passion to a hollowed-out
cedar tree in the woods near each of their homes.  But World War II
interrupts their already delicate bond; Hatsue and her family are
dragged off to an internment camp, while Ishmael is sent to fight for
his country.  Without divulging too much of the plot, Ishmael learns
that Hatsue has called off their relationship while he is overseas, and
the resulting scene still gives me chills when I think about it.</P>
<P>In the present day, Ishmael, who has inherited the Island Review from
his deceased father, recognizes the importance of the trial as it
relates to the future of his town.  Together with Kazuo's defense
attorney Nels Gudmundsson (Max von Sydow, What Dreams May Come), Ishmael
sets out to prove Kazuo's innocence, despite both the bigotry of the
majority of his advertisers and subscribers and the bitterness he feels
toward Kazuo for stealing the heart of the girl that he still loves.</P>
<P>It's tough to pick a place to begin praising the hypnotic and
atmospheric Cedars.  The film is jaw-in-your-lap beautiful, from the
silvery-black look to the steely water at the film's beginning, to the
vibrant red strawberry patches that Ishmael and Hatsue played in as
children, to the blinding white blizzard that engulfs the town during
the final stretch of the trial, to the darkness that hangs over the
candlelit courtroom as a result of the blizzard's disruption of the
building's power.  This is definitely Oscar-worthy work from one of last
year's nominees, Robert Richardson (The Horse Whisperer).
Pleasantville's art and production teams help give the film a rich,
realistic look and feel.  Editor Hank Corwin (Natural Born Killers)
pieces together the past and the future magnificently and without
seeming like a Lone Star rip-off (unlike Simpatico).  Of the
behind-the-scenes work, only the score (James Newton Howard, The Sixth
Sense) is slightly annoying.</P>
<P>It's very hard to imagine Ethan Hawke carrying a picture, and he doesn't
here.  It's a great role for him because he has few lines, required
mostly to look good and thoughtful instead.  James Cromwell (The Green
Mile) is typically wonderful as the presiding judge, but von Sydow
steals the show with his closing argument that all but flashes `For Your
Consideration' at the bottom of the screen.  His character seems
bewildered and frail, but he is still obviously a legal menace, capable
of swaying any jury.</P>
<P>Hicks, who adapted Guterson's novel with Ron Bass (Stepmom), should be
praised if not just for assembling the talent necessary to pull the film
off.  His direction is first-rate, repeatedly using long stretches with
no dialogue (especially as the Japanese are taken from their homes to
the internment camps), and his World War II scene is nearly as
devastating as Saving Private Ryan's Normandy invasion.  Hopefully Hicks
and his crew will be remembered when it's time to hand out nominations,
if not awards.</P>
<P>2:06 - PG-13 for disturbing war images, adult situations, strong
language and some sexual content</P>
