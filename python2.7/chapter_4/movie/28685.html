<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A lifeless satire on the foibles of mankind (men can't be trusted and women can
be bought), as seen through the eyes of a soft-hearted prostitute. This is not
one of the filmmaker's better comedies, it seems too preachy in trying to
convince us of how sex and love go together like politics and politicians.
Betrand Blier's ("Going Places"/"Get Out Your Handkerchiefs") means of
accomplishing this, is to try and shock our values by offering us politically
incorrect views on life. It was all ho-hum...who cares, as the characters could
never be seen as real people and the action was dull and ridiculous. At one
point in the film, a character is offered the choice of hearing Barry White or
Vivaldi -- and -- without a hesitation chooses White. I would have chosen
Vivaldi, but Barry White songs are played throughout, thereafter, and in my
opinion were the most lively thing about this film. </P>
<P>The film is set in Lyon, where we are told there is a large unemployment problem
and because of that men seek pleasure from prostitutes more than they do in good
times. In the opening scene Marie (Grinberg), a pert prostitute, sits on a bar
stool outside a hotel and talks a passing matronly housewife Gilberte (Valadié)
into turning a trick and getting paid for what she enjoys doing, anyway. The
belabored point made is, what a joy sex is. Marie is proud that she's found her
true calling in life, to be a prostitute, and sell true love while she gets
handsomely paid and laid for it. </P>
<P>The core of the story is when she returns to her apartment and finds a homeless
bum asleep by the garbage can. She invites him in, falls entranced by his
disheveled look, and has sex with him dog style. Afraid of losing Jeannot
(Lanvin), who turns out to be a stud -- she makes him her pimp and gives him all
the money she makes, the $1,000 a day she earns on her ass. After cleaning him
up, buying him clothes, and giving him a purpose in life, the ungrateful pimp,
who's a nice pimp, nevertheless, takes advantage of her masochistic nature. He
breaks her heart by becoming slick and meeting a busty manicurist Tangerine
(Tedeschi), whom he talks into turning tricks for him eventhough she's not cut
out for that work. When he gets arrested for pimping and serves some jail time
Marie decides to reform and have two kids with a husband, and to lead a
bourgeois existence. She's not arrested because prostitution is legal in France,
but pimping is not. </P>
<P>She moves on this new dream of hers while he's behind bars and picks up a
handsome, unemployed man, Jean-François (Martinez), in a coffee shop and talks
him into going along with her dream of an idyllic marriage. When he still can't
find work after having the kids, she returns to being a prostitute, but the fun
has gone out of it and it seems too businesslike to suit her fancy. </P>
<P>Blier just didn't take this story anywhere, even the elegant charms of the very
ladylike whore, Grinberg, soon loses its appeal. I grew weary trying to follow
Blier's logic, and what he had to say didn't seem to add up; I wasn't laughing
at any of his satires. It turned into sentimental TV sitcom stuff instead of
following through on the theme of all the sexual alienation there is in society,
a theme it quickly jettisoned for no discernible reason by following the pimp
around instead of the whore; especially, since it had nothing else to say that
mattered. </P>
