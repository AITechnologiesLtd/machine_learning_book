A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Niagara Niagara is a road movie that shouldn't be one.  Telling the
story of two loners tossed together by fate, the film survives only on
the basis of one strong performance.</P>
<P>Seth (Henry Thomas) and Marcy (Robin Tunney) are shy outcasts.  They
come from different worlds (Seth is poor, Marcy rich), but neither has
felt love.  The two loners literally run into each other while
shoplifting at the same store, and immediately hit it off.  Before they
know it, the couple begin a road trip to Canada in search of an elusive
black Bobbi head.</P>
<P>Marcy isn't like other girls, however.  She has Tourette's Syndrome. At
first she tries to restrain her tics and unintentional vocal outbursts,
and Seth is too timid to ask her about it.  But eventually, she informs
him about her condition.  It turns out there is a prescription drug
which could help her, but she left her prescription at home.  Rather
than simply contacting her doctor, or getting a new prescription, she
and Seth decide to try every pharmacy the run across during their road
trip.  Surely some nice pharmacist will give her the drugs, no questions
asked.</P>
<P>Robin Tunney delivers a good performance, even if the premise is a bit
forced. She delivers the various tics and idiosyncrasies with natural
ease, making them seem to emerge from the character, rather than the
actor.</P>
<P>Yet, the movie seems trapped by its own conventions.  What might have
been a touching love story is shackled by being forced to conform to its
preconceived "road movie" standards.  The movie is pointlessly filled
with bizarre characters, such as the psycho druggist, or Walter (Michael
Parks), the chicken-obsessed tow-truck driver.  None of these characters
seemto flow with the story.  Rather, they are artificial constructions
which are meant for amusement, but only serve to disappoint.</P>
<P>At any time when the relationship between Seth and Marcy seems to get
interesting, all of a sudden the movie's MacGuffin raises its ugly head
(or Bobbi head as the case may be).  The goal of the pair's quest is
only interesting to the audience to the extent that it motivates the
action and reveals the characters.  In Niagara Niagara, the trip is more
about the trip than Seth and Marcy.</P>
<P>Overall, the only reason to see this film is the performance by  Robin
Tunney.  It definitely fails as a road movie, a crime spree, or even as
much of a romance.</P>
