<P>     It has been my experience that many motion pictures suffer
somewhat in retrospect.  The further one gets from the theater, the
more flaws come to light.  With ROOSTERS, however, the opposite is
true.  The passage of time allows a viewer an opportunity to consider
and digest.  Those who do not enjoy interpreting certain film elements,
and thus drawing their own conclusions, would do better to stay away
from ROOSTERS.</P>
<P>     Most of ROOSTERS takes place on the land of the Morales family
near the Arizona/Mexico border.  Here, Juana Morales (Sonia Braga),
along with her sister-in-law Chata (Maria Conchita Alonso), is awaiting
the return of her husband Gallo (Edward James Olmos), who has been in
prison for the last seven years serving time for murder.  Juana and
Gallo have two children--Hector (Danny Nucci) and Angela (Sarah
Lassez), who view their father's return differently.  Hector is
resentful, while Angie waits patiently and in open awe that HE is
coming home.</P>
<P>     On the surface, this is a film about cock fights.  Gallo went to
prison because he murdered a man over a prize bird, and the first thing
he thinks about after getting out is how to raise a new breed of
flying, jumping killers.  This is a person who cares about one thing,
and one thing only--his roosters.  As we learn during the course of
the film, there is nothing he won't sacrifice for them.</P>
<P>     One of ROOSTERS' great strengths is its development of character
relationships.  Accomplished with subtlety and insight, and just enough
ambiguity to keep us wondering about certain aspects, this is by far
the highlight of Milcha Sanchez-Scotts script.  There are several
instances when incest is hinted at, but nothing is explicitly
revealed.  Each member of the audience must make his or her own
decision about the truth.</P>
<P>     Symbolism abounds, both religious and secular.  The rooster,
representative of machismo, plays a central role of all that transpires
(as one might guess from the films title.  Gallo continually equates
his birds with his manhood, and the willingness to fight and be
bloodied with the maturation process.  His opinion of his son is linked
to the young mans ability to handle to cocks.</P>
<P>     Angela, the daughter to whom Gallo pays no heed, is in a state of
arrested development.  At fifteen years of age, she wants to grow
younger.  Childhood is her refuge, and the encroaching physical changes
of becoming a woman frighten her.  She seeks refuge in religious
artifacts and a mystical world of her own invention, where she
intercedes with saints and converses with angels.</P>
<P>     ROOSTERS deals with the themes of freedom versus captivity, love
versus obsession, and innocence versus reality.  The climax toward
which all of these build is possibly inevitable, and certainly
foreshadowed, yet it is nevertheless the most powerful single moment of
the motion picture.  Little has been resolved as the final credits
roll, and it's up to the viewer to decide exactly what happened, and
what will come next.</P>
<P>     If ROOSTERS has an obvious flaw, it lies in the dialogue, which is
often too flowery or intellectual.  The author is taking poetic license
to get across her higher meaning, but on more than one occasion, a line
is jarringly inappropriate for the speaker or the circumstances in
which it is spoken.</P>
<P>     The principal actors all do fine jobs, but the performance of
newcomer Sarah Lassez is a standout.  When she is on screen, she
transfixes the audience with her blend of innocence and sensuality.
Edward James Olmos, a seasoned veteran, has scene after scene stolen
away from him by his much younger co-star.</P>
<P>     ROOSTERS delves into Latino traditions to uncover universal
themes.  Adapted from a play, with an expectedly slow pace for a story
making that transition, this movie holds the attention of its audience
by its depth of meaning and richness of characters.  ROOSTERS is not
effortless entertainment, but it will reward those willing to absorb
what it has to say, and the manner in which it says it.</P>
