<P>Principal Cast:  
Treat Williams, Fammke Jannsen, Kevin J. O'Conner, Wes Studi</P>
<P>Written and Directed by Stephen Sommers</P>
<P>Let's remember what movies were primarily made for.  Entertainment.  </P>
<P>That remembered, does Deep Rising succeed?</P>
<PRE>Yep.</PRE>
<P>For those of you who don't know the plot, I'll paraphrase something I
read.  Pirates, Sea monster, you figure it out.  Have we seen all of this
before?  Done Better?  Well, yeah, but who cares?  This movie is a fun
ride that resembles a carnival haunted house.  A group of disposable
people run, swim and run some more from tentacles with teeth.  They have
guns that never run out of ammo (Cool!).  Some of the action sequences
are quite innovative actually.  There are even a few laughs in here
(especially that final shot).  The actors aren't taking themselves or
the movie seriously, so why should we?</P>
<P>If you're a Sam Raimi fan, you'll probably have a good time here.  I kept
waiting for the Treat Williams character to say "Groovy."</P>
