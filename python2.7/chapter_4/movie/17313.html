<P>IN DREAMS
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: *1/2 (out of ****)
DreamWorks SKG / 1:40 / 1999 / R (violence, language)
Cast: Annette Bening; Aidan Quinn; Stephen Rea; Robert Downey Jr.; Paul 
Guilfoyle 
Director: Neil Jordan 
Screenplay: Bruce Robinson; Neil Jordan <HR>"In Dreams" might keep you awake at night, but not because of its creepy 
imagery, bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who 
lures young girls to their untimely deaths. No, the source of potential 
sleeplessness here lies within the movie's brutally squandered 
potential, the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by 
tired serial killer genre standards. The big letdown, however, comes 
upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was 
masterminded by Neil Jordan, the man behind "The Crying Game." He's no 
stranger to cinematic weirdness, but this nutty nonsense really pushes 
the envelope. </P>
<P>Things start out strong enough, with cinematographer Darius Khondji's 
stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater 
ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone 
right off the bat. This eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of 
showmanship throughout the entire film - there's even something macabre 
about the way Khondji photographs a rustic, seemingly innocent New 
England autumn - but if there ever was a film that didn't deserve so 
good a polish, it's this one. Don't knock the look, but say what you 
will about the foolish plot, underdeveloped characters and flat 
dialogue. </P>
<P>Annette Bening, another asset "In Dreams" shouldn't be so lucky to 
boast, gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that 
doesn't do much for her in return. She plays Claire Cooper, a 
Massachusetts children's book illustrator who's plagued by terrifying 
nightmares involving kidnaped children. She thinks these visions are a 
warning knell for horrible, soon-to-be-committed crimes, but neither her 
ho-hum husband (Aidan Quinn) nor the ho-hummer police can muster up the 
sense to take her seriously. This being a thriller, we know that she is, 
in fact, on the money, and it's a credit to Bening's acting that she 
delves equally into Claire's madness and compassion. </P>
<P>But as soon as a body turns up and Claire has given the authorities 
reason enough to believe her claims, "In Dreams" trades in its nifty 
supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that 
simply refuse to make sense. Scenes pile up like a car wreck with little 
or no explanation or exposition. Subplots appear and disappear. When 
Claire finally comes face-to-face with our evil murderer (Robert Downey 
Jr.), it turns out his name is Vivian, he's clairvoyant and he's got 
some major issues with mama, a la Norman Bates. "In Dreams" reaches its 
absurdist zenith here, and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and 
laughable twists. </P>
<P>Some questions, then: What's with the garbage disposal retching 
applesauce? Are the drawings on the wall blood or paint? Who cranked up 
the Andrews Sisters on the CD player and caused the swing to move on its 
own? What about the computer? Does Vivian possess the gift of 
telekinesis in addition to his other powers? Why would he continually 
endanger Claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan? Is the woman 
in Australia integral to anything? And the aforementioned flooded city - 
what function does that _really_ serve? Sigh. At least in my own dreams, 
I can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn't go to waste.<HR>© 1999 Jamie Peck

"Like so many horror films, this one is set on a national holiday - the 
Fourth of July. Christmas and Graduation Day are also popular, although 
Thanksgiving now seems reserved for movies about dysfunctional 
families." -Roger Ebert on "I Know What You Did Last Summer"</P>
