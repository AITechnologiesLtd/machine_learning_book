<PRE>                            CRUEL INTENTIONS
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     From a raw material standpoint, you can't get much better than
DANGEROUS LIAISONS.  Wisely, this 90's updating of LIAISONS, CRUEL
INTENTIONS, is quite faithful to the original.  And woe be unto those
who enter INTENTIONS thinking this is a date movie.</P>
<P>     The story so far: Kathryn (Gellar) and Sebastian (Phillippe) are
spoiled, ultra-rich, rival half-siblings living in posh Upper East Side
Manhattan.  How does such a child while away the day?  Well, sexual
conquests of unsuspecting lesser-thans is a damn good start.  On a whim,
Kathryn challenges Sebastian to the ultimate test: deflower puritanical
virgin Annette (Witherspoon) and he can have Kathryn as a prize.</P>
<P>     Numerous side plots detract Sebastian from his goal, most notably
the similar deflowering of the dim Cecile (Blair), and, of course,
Sebastian falling in genuine love with Annette, for the first time in
his life.  Do things go badly?  Well, we're talking about some very,
very mean kids here.  What do you think!?</P>
<P>     Aside from a slightly happified ending, INTENTIONS is an impressive
movie.  Solid dialogue, luscious characters, great comic relief, and an
admittedly classic story give it wings above the standard teen-oriented
dreck on the market.  Placing the story 200 years ahead of its origin
adds surprisingly little, though, besides an automobile, cell phones,
and a reference to e-mail.  Oh, and lest you be depressed by the film,
you can sleep well tonight, comfy in the knowledge that--in real
life--Witherspoon is pregnant with Phillippe's child.  How's that for
irony?</P>
<P>     A final note for people who feel CRUEL INTENTIONS may not reflect
the reality of what modern American teens are really like.  If the
chatty, giggling pre-teens (who had faked being 17 to get into the
theater and were sitting behind me) are any indication of the reality,
we should all be very, *very* afraid.</P>
