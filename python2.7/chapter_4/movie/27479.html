<P>_Save_the_Last_Dance_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>At quick glance, Julia Stiles' filmography is far from impressive.  The
teen comedies _10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_ and _Down_to_You_.  Michael
Almereyda's woefully misguided Y2K-set adaptation of _Hamlet_.  Even the
one step she has seemingly taken in the right direction, David Mamet's
_State_and_Main_, is a decidedly subpar effort from its celebrated
writer-director.</P>
<P>But if one actually saw all of these projects, one thing is abundantly
clear: while the films as a whole do not deliver, Stiles always does. 
She gave _10_Things_ the sharp edge that the rest of the movie sorely
lacked; she radiated warmth and intelligence that was otherwise absent in
_Down_to_You_; and she more than kept up with the top-drawer ensemble
casts in _Hamlet_ and _State_and_Main_.  Stiles' latest starring vehicle,
_Save_the_Last_Dance_, continues this pattern: she rises to the occasion
in an enterprise that is beneath her game efforts.</P>
<P>After the death of her mother, Stiles' Sara Johnson moves to Chicago to
live with her errant father (Terry Kinney), with whom she has
relationship that's tense at best.  Sara has slightly less difficulty
finding comfort at her predominantly African-American high school, for
she is quickly taken under the wing of Chenille (Kerry Washington), an
outgoing single mother.  While Sara and Chenille quickly become best
friends, that soon pales in comparison to Sara's burgeoning relationship
with Chenille's ambitious brother Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas), who helps
reawaken her dream of becoming a dancer--a goal she abandoned after her
mother's untimely passing.</P>
<P>Unlike most teen-targeted films, _Save_the_Last_Dance_ cannot be accused
of not being about anything; in fact, it tries to be about too much.  In
addition to being the story of Sara finding her place and reclaiming her
dream, it's also about the Sara/Derek romance, complete with all the
outside stumbling blocks that come with an interracial union.  It's also
about Derek's criminal past, and whether or not he'll fall back on the
wrong side of the law with best friend Malakai (Fredro Starr).  And last
but certainly not least, it's about a lily white girl learning to put
some soul into her dance moves.  With so many balls in the air, director
Thomas Carter and writers Duane Adler and Cheryl Edwards are bound to
drop some, and indeed they do; their biggest slip comes in the hackneyed,
overblown climax.</P>
<P>What works best in _Save_the_Last_Dance_ is the Sara/Derek pairing, and
that's because Stiles and Thomas are so well-matched.  Not only are they
instantly likable and have a genuine, gentle rapport, they also have the
chops to bring real pathos to overly familiar dramatic situations.  But
with the title _Save_the_Last_Dance_, acting ability is somewhat
secondary to dancing ability, and Stiles and Thomas can definitely hold
their own on a dance floor.</P>
<P>Ultimately, this talented twosome can only do so much with a script that
continually lets them down at about every turn.  With yet another
impressive turn to her credit, Stiles has once again earned her stripes
as someone to watch.  But until someone puts her in a real movie, it'll
be hard to maintain the desire to keep watching.</P>
