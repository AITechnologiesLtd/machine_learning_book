<PRE>AN AMERICAN RHAPSODY
---------------------</PRE>
<P>When Margit (Nastassja Kinski, "The Claim") and Peter (Tony Goldwyn, "The
Sixth Day") flea from 1950s Hungary with their daughter Maria, their infant
is supposed to follow, but grandmother Helen's (Agi Banfalvy) fears make
her keep the baby behind.  Heartbroken, the family continues on to America, 
while baby Suzanne is raised in the Hungarian countryside.  Writer/director 
Eva Gardos tells her own story of a life between two families and countries 
in "An American Rhapsody."</P>
<P>Childless farming couple Jeno (Balazs Galko) and Teri (Zsuzsa Czinkoczi)
give Suzanne (at 6, Kelly Endresz Banlaki) an idyllic peasant folk 
fairytale childhood.  The child is happy and adored and doesn't comprehend
the occasional gifts which arrive from the United States.  Peter and
Margit have worked hard and achieved a middle class home in California
where Maria has become a typical American child.  Margit toils at a 
letter writing campaign to have her daughter returned to her and finally
realizes her dream.  Suzanne is taken from the only parents she knows
(who believe she'll be returned) and sent to America, where her arrival
is a media event.</P>
<P>While Suzanne enjoys a good relationship with her father, she's at war
with her 'new' mother.  The teenage Suzanne (Scarlett Johansson, "Ghost
World") sneaks out of her bedroom window to drive around with her boyfriend,
drink and stay out all night.  Mom installs bars on the windows and a lock
on the door.  Suzanne loads a rifle and shoots up the room.  With the
family in crisis, Peter fulfills an old promise to send Suzanne to
Budapest, against Margit's wishes.  The trip allows Suzanne to become
whole and learn the secret her mother wished to protect her from.</P>
<P>"An American Rhapsody" is a personal story about the meaning of home
and family.  Suzanne's resentment at being left behind and torn from
the people who raised her is met with overwhelming mother love from the
woman who's dreamt of nothing but their reunion.  Elder sister Maria,
ironically, is the alien of the family, somewhat taken for granted and
completely assimilated into the new culture.  She drinks coke and slings
the slang while her babushka wearing sister gets lost in a neighborhood 
of identical tract houses.  While these early scenes are fascinating,
due in large part to the sensational Banlaki, the later teenage years
become wearying in their repetitiveness, with too many scenes of Margit 
standing in Suzanne's bedroom doorway while her daughter sulks.  Gardos 
doesn't get the mother's point of view across well and lets important
characters like sister Maria and Suzanne's boyfriend Paul all but
disappear (in fact, the shooting scene begins with Paul at the window,
but he's promptly forgotten, a jarring problem in such a climatic moment).</P>
<P>Kinski's fine as the overprotective mom, but Johansson fails to make us 
empathize.  Goldwyn is surprisingly good as the even tempered, practical dad.
The camera just loves Banlaki, and the film's at its best when she's
on screen.</P>
<P>Hungarian cinematographer Elemer Ragalyi ("Jacob the Liar")
shoots the early escape in a bluish black and white, letting full color bloom
when the family arrives in the West.  The film has a retro look, as if
it was filmed in the time period the story takes place in, which is
also complemented by the production (Alex Tavoularis, "Apocalypse Now") and 
costume design (Beatrix Aruno Pasztor, "The Wonder Boys").</P>
<P>Reminiscent of the equally uneven "The Man Who Cried,"
"An American Rhapsody" takes a bumpy road on its way home.</P>
