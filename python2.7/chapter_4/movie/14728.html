<PRE>Retrospective: Deliverance (1972)
Review By: Ryan Davis</PRE>
<P>        Sure there are many films that are called classics. But once I saw
this, I knew where a number of newer films got some of their most impressive
scenes. Unfortunately, the newer movies seem to execute them better than
Deliverance.</P>
<P>        Not to say Deliverance isn't a superb film, it is. But I have been
spoiled by Tarantino's rendition of the, ever so famous, squeal like a pig
scene. For the time this scene must have seemed very shocking, but now it just
seems antiquated.</P>
<P>        The story involves four men who decide to go on a weekend long canoe
trip, in southern Georgia. They meet some strange inbreed locals, who along
the way cause some trouble with the group. In what appears to be a life or
death situation one of the locals is killed and the group must dispose of the
body. Now scared, they begin their journey to the end of the river so they
can get home. However, don't expect it to be a leisurely trip.</P>
<P>         The performances of the four men (Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned
Beatty, and Ronny Cox) are very impressive. Burt shows the same acting talent
here, that he displays in the more recent "Boogie Nights". Ned is also
standout as the poor overweight salesmen, who is sodomized by a hillbilly
man.</P>
<P>        John Boorman's direction is rather impressive. Although when compared
to today's, it may seem rather conservative. Vilmos Zsigmond's beautiful
cinematography does stand the true test of time, and is just as brilliant now
as it was then.</P>
<P>        Its hard to believe this movie was shot for a mere two million dollars,
something that could never be done today.  And even if this movie has not aged
as well as some, it certainly is a must see because of its originality and
maybe Ned squealing like a pig.</P>
