<PRE>                        THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<PRE>95 min., G, Comedy, 1992
Director: Brian Henson
Cast: The Muppets, Michael Caine</PRE>
<P>     The Muppets do their version of Charles Dickens's holiday classic,
A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  Michael Caine is Ebenezer Scrooge, who doesn't enjoy
Christmas.  He is mean to everyone, especially his employees, including
Kermit the Frog, as Bob Crachit.  Caine is visited by his dead business
partners (there are two in this version) Statler and Waldorf, as the
Marley's.  Statler and Waldorf send Caine three ghosts to show him the
evil of his ways, in hopes to help him change.</P>
<P>     THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL is a very enjoyable holiday film that I
think both the young and the old will love.  If your area is still
playing this film, I don't think that it will be there for long, so you
should see it soon.  On a scale of zero to five, I give THE MUPPET
CHRISTMAS CAROL a five.</P>
<P>     This film I believe is the fourth Muppet film (the earlier films
that I can remember are THE MUPPET MOVIE, which was just released on
video cassette, THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER, which was also just released on
video cassette, and THE MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN).  The Muppets, despite
the death of their creator Jim Henson, are still doing well, but Kermit
the Frog will never be the same.</P>
<P>     Believe it or not, the Muppets stay very close to the original
story.  They take only a few liberties with the story, like making two
Marley's and making Charles Dickens (excellently played by Gonzo)
narrate the story with his side kick, Rizzo the Rat (also great!)</P>
<P>     Michael Caine takes the back seat in this film, because the Muppets
are the best part of this film.  However Michael Caine does do a great
job.</P>
