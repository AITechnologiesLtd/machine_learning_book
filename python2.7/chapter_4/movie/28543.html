<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A crime thriller exposing the people who pretend they are someone they
are not. Director Claude Chabrol has come up with a diverting thriller,
that is well-crafted and features a magnificent performance by Philippe
Noiret as Christian Legagneur. He's an overbearing, smarmy, popular TV
game-show host, who thinks life is a game and he can treat everyone like
they're puppets because he's controlling the strings. To the public and
those around him he comes off as a generous, caring and kind-hearted
man. But underneath that mask he's a vicious predator and scoundrel, who
is even capable of murder.</P>
<P>Under the ruse of writing a story on the TV celeb, Roland Wolf poses as
a journalist and gets an invite to his subject's country home for three
days of interviews. He immediately starts snooping around and finds
things he's not supposed to. Here he meets all those close to Christian:
Max (Dumeniaud), his mute driver and chef. Max's wife Colette
(Chaumette), who acts as his secretary on the program and at his home
she helps serve the meals. Another couple that serves his needs consists
of: Manu (Roger Dumas), who acts as the wine connoisseur and errand boy,
and his attractive wife Patricia (Lafont), who serves as his masseuse,
tarot reader, and dispenser of herbal remedies for his sickly
goddaughter Catherine (Anne Brochet).</P>
<P>Tension picks up when he finds a tennis racquet that the household help
tells him was Madeleine's. By prying, he finds out that she was an
aspiring actress whom Christian invited to stay over to keep his
goddaughter company. But after being a houseguest for three months, she
suddenly vanished. Christian said she had a tiff with Catherine and
wrote a note saying she was taking off to stay in a remote area.</P>
<P>Roland befriends Catherine and in their confidential talks they learn to
trust each other. She is kept constantly drowsy but Christian refuses to
have her see a doctor, instead Patricia gives her special plant
remedies. Catherine seems upset when Roland tells her that her godfather
is planning to kill her, and that she's being drugged by him. Madeleine
told her the same thing, which caused a rift in their relationship and
her disappearance.</P>
<P>It is learned that Christian became her guardian when she was
5-years-old, and Roland by snooping around has uncovered that he has
fleeced her inheritance by siphoning off money from their joint account
to buy businesses such as -- a car wrecking one and a retirement home,
under only his name.</P>
<P>Things come to head when Catherine sees for herself that she been fooled
by her guardian's false kindness. She's also pleased to learn that
Roland isn't a journalist but Madeline's sister, and is now only
interested in her safety. They have also fallen in love.</P>
<P>He has come here because he expects his sister vanished because of foul
play, and he wants to get the proof. It then becomes a chess game
between Roland and Christian to see who wins.</P>
<P>What was missing in this better-than-average thriller, was a sense of
passion. Everything seemed to be happening in a too matter-of-fact
manner.</P>
