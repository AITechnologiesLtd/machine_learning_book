<P>For those who are unfamiliar with David Gerrold's work, he's a nine-
time Hugo and Nebula nominee whose novella "The Martian Child" won him 
one of each.  His works include the alien invasion series WAR AGAINST 
THE CHTORR, the time-travel novel THE MAN WHO FOLDED HIMSELF, the 
analysis/criticism THE WORLD OF STAR TREK, and a whole bunch more 
fiction and non-.  He'll always be stuck with the label of "the guy 
who wrote 'The Trouble With Tribbles.'"  (Yes, *that* episode of STAR 
TREK.)  He is one of only a handful of writers to have been nominated 
for the Hugo award for prose and screen work.</P>
<P>He was also a friend of the late Robert A. Heinlein.</P>

<PRE>                            STARSHIP TROOPERS
                         review by David Gerrold</PRE>
<P>In 1962, Robert A.  Heinlein, the undeniable "dean of science 
fiction," published the best novel of his career: STARSHIP TROOPERS.  </P>
<P>Many critics regard this novel as the single most influential novel 
ever published in the science fiction field.  Other authors wrote some 
of their best works in response to it -- either in agreement, or as an 
argument against.  There's no question that STARSHIP TROOPERS is not 
only Heinlein's best novel, it's also his most controversial.  In many 
ways it is far superior to his philosophically flawed STRANGER IN A 
STRANGE LAND.  (But that's a different discussion.) </P>
<P>The novel details the adventures of Juan (Johnnie) Rico, a wealthy 
Filipino youth who graduates from high school and joins the Mobile 
Infantry to earn his citizenship.  In this particular Heinlein future, 
citizenship is earned by a term of service to the nation.  Only 
citizens get to vote.  This carries with it the implied assumption 
that only graduates of federal service are qualified to know what's 
good for society, that those who have not served are parasites who 
have made no other valuable contribution to society, and who are 
therefore not entitled to a voice.  </P>
<P>On the surface, the novel is structured like BATTLE CRY, the post-WWII 
recruiting movie, following the adventures of several young men and 
women through their training and through their various battlefields -- 
but first it stops to takes a few pages from ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN 
FRONT.  If you'll remember that novel, it starts with a teacher 
extolling the glories of war and defending the fatherland to a 
classroom of eager German youth.  In Heinlein's classroom however, 
Dubois, the instructor is far more realistic and charismatic.  Instead 
he talks about personal responsibility, morality, and ethics -- the 
obligation one owes one's society for accepting its protection.  The 
class is a required course, part of the necessary preparation for the 
choice presented to every high school graduate -- whether or not to 
earn citizenship through service.  </P>
<P>Juan Rico's parents are shown as shallow non-citizens, who oppose his 
military service; but Juan enters the service over their objections 
because his best friend, Carl, and his girlfriend, Carmen, are also 
signing up.  Carl is going into strategy and tactics, and Carmen wants 
to be a starship pilot.  Unfortunately, Juan's aptitudes show that the 
only thing he's good for is "cannon fodder," the Mobile Infantry.  Uh-
oh.  It is obvious from the text that the Mobile Infantry has already 
been involved in quite a few wars -- and at least two of the veterans 
we meet (Dubois and the enlistment officer) are missing limbs.  But 
Heinlein is making a point here -- ultimately all wars are won by the 
infantry, the guys who go in on the ground.</P>
<P>Heinlein's portrayal of boot camp shows that military training in the 
future will remain essentially the same -- drill the trainees to 
exhaustion, break down their identities, and rebuild them with 
unflinching commitment to the task at hand.  Rico makes a couple of 
mistakes along the way, earns some lashes (flogging is legal in this 
society), learns his lessons, and gets over the hump.  He becomes a 
soldier.  </P>
<P>One of the most interesting parts of the book is Heinlein's projection 
of future military ordnance and equipment.  The Mobile Infantry are 
equipped with "Power Armor" -- nuclear powered suits which greatly 
expands the ability and strength of the individual.  The armor makes 
each and every soldier a one-person tank, able to leap tall buildings 
in a single bound, faster than a speeding locomotive... etc. etc.  
Juan Rico in his power armor has enough ordnance to topple a small 
government.</P>
<P>It's just about this time (of course) that war breaks out with the 
bug-world Klendathu.  The bugs start it by dropping a large rock on 
Buenos Aires, wiping out the entire city and killing Rico's mother who 
is visiting at the time.  (This is the first of several interesting 
oversights in the book.  If the bugs can drop a small asteroid on a 
single city to wipe it out, why not drop a very large asteroid and 
destroy ALL life on the planet?) </P>
<P>So Juan and his fellow soldiers are off to battle.  As with BATTLE 
CRY and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, we see Rico changed by his 
experiences in actual combat.  The death rate is distressingly high.  
This one buys the farm, then that one buys the farm.  Sooner or later, 
everyone buys a farm.  You learn to stop caring so much about the 
characters....  </P>
<P>The bugs are a particularly interesting alien species.  They are 
evolved from hive-dwelling insects.  The soldiers are mindless 
warriors, bred for only one purpose -- kill and keep on killing.  The 
Klendathoids(?) breed different types of workers for different kinds 
of jobs; only the warriors are dangerous.  There are probably queen-
bugs and brain-bugs too, but we don't see them in the book.  </P>
<P>And it is here, in the design of the aliens that Heinlein reveals what 
his book is really about -- what kind of a species are we?  What does 
it mean to be a human being?  He has begun his book with several 
pertinent discussions of personal responsibility; then he demonstrates 
how it works.  Everything that Heinlein portrays here is about taking 
a large bite of responsibility and then growing the jaws to chew it.  
As Rico gnaws his way up the food chain, to squad leader, to corporal, 
to sergeant, and finally to lieutenant, we see that what is really 
happening is the expansion of his domain of responsibility.  </P>
<P>This is contrasted with the bugs, whose individuals are mindless.  
They are bred for a single task only.  They are not adaptable and they 
are not capable of operating outside of the specific domain for which 
they were bred.  A warrior will kill and do nothing else; it cannot 
negotiate,it cannot surrender, it cannot even honor a truce.  A worker 
can only work, it cannot fight.  Etc.  etc.  There is no 
responsibility among the bugs.</P>
<P>(While this makes for a particularly horrifying enemy, it actually 
presents a serious story problem that Heinlein has conveniently 
glossed over by simply not addressing it.  How does an essentially 
mindless species achieve faster-than-light travel?  Heinlein 
postulates brain-bugs, but we never really see any bug technology.  
There is a hint that there is some bug technology, but we don't see it 
in the warriors.  Heinlein also postulates that the bugs have an 
alliance with the "skinnies," a humanoid species who later switch 
their allegiance to our side, but ...again, the question of bug 
technology is still not addressed.</P>
<P>Never mind.  Heinlein isn't world-building here.  He's trying to make 
a different point.)</P>
<P>Heinlein is using the contrast between human and bug to force us to 
focus on the question at hand -- are we mindless bugs?  Or are we 
reasoning beings?  And if we are reasoning beings, then what is our 
responsibility in the matter?  If we are capable of individual 
rational thought, then how can we justify behaving like mindless bugs?  </P>
<P>Regardless of the military setting for the story, Heinlein is asking a 
very pertinent question.  It is the same question he asks in STRANGER 
IN A STRANGE LAND.  In both books, he stacks the deck for the answer 
he prefers.  But that is always the prerogative of the author, and the 
questions that Heinlein has asked have proven to be more important for 
the asking than for the particular answers that Heinlein has offered.  
Thirty-five years later the arguments are still raging.</P>
<P>Now, Paul Verhoeven, director of ROBOCOP and TOTAL RECALL, has adapted 
STARSHIP TROOPERS into a movie...and I feel confident in predicting 
that it will trigger a new round of even more intense arguments.  </P>
<P>There's no question that STARSHIP TROOPERS is one of the most 
intensely anticipated movies of the year, perhaps the decade.  
Millions of Heinlein's readers are waiting for this one.  In one 
respect, they will not be disappointed.  The picture has some of the 
finest action sequences ever seen in a science fiction movie.  The 
battles with the bugs are astonishing.  The movie is undoubtedly going 
to be a big hit -- especially among 13-year old boys.  My son thought 
it was the best movie he'd ever seen.  It's big, it's long, it's loud, 
it's gory.  What more could a boy ask for?  The special effects are 
truly this picture's strength.  </P>
<P>That's the bad news.  There is little good news.</P>
<P>To start with, the scriptwriter should probably be taken out and given 
ten lashes for presumption, and another ten for doing a lousy job.  
The dialogue is uniformly unimaginative, jingoistic, and in some 
places downright stupid.  The story structure is sloppy.  The 
character of Dubois is dropped/combined with Lieutenant Rasczak.  
Juan's family lives in Buenos Aires, so both of his parents are killed 
when the bugs attack; this eliminates the reconciliation scene between 
Rico and his father so important to the book.  A new female character, 
Dizzy, is added.  She joins the M.I. because she's in love with Rico.  
And for someone native to Argentina (in the movie), Johnny Rico has a 
decidedly anglo look.  Hmmm.</P>
<P>Heinlein's greatest strength -- his thought-provoking conversations -- 
have been reduced to jingoistic one-liners.  The picture is punctuated 
with satirical newscasts from the future.  This is a device that 
worked very well in both Robocop and Total Recall; it doesn'twork 
here.  Because so many of the news stories are laugh-out-loud 
caricatures, they send an implied message: Don't take this movie 
seriously.  But then we cut back to the classroom or the training 
ground or the Lieutenant and what we're hearing is something else 
entirely: take this very seriously, it's about your humanity.  </P>
<P>The really bad news is that much of the best of Heinlein's novel has 
been gutted in the script.  The power armor is gone.  Instead, our 
brave young men and women are outfitted as if (the late) Gianni 
Versacci were sending them off to take the beach at Normandy.  The 
technology portrayed is already obsolete in 1997.  This is a humanity 
that has faster-than-light starships, and is still sending the troops 
in armed only with gunpowder and grenades -- and the occasional hand-
held nuke.  Huh?</P>
<P>We saw napalm carpets laid down in Vietnam.  Why not on Klendathu?  
We've seen our soldiers using flame-throwers in the Mekong Delta, why 
not on Klendathu?  We've seen our planes dropping "daisy-cutter" bombs 
(fuel-air explosives, they work like baby nukes), in Vietnam (and in 
the opening sequence of OUTBREAK), why not on Klendathu?  We've seen 
how snipers can use laser-beams for precision targeting, why not our 
infantry on Klendathu?  Our local motorcycle police have their radios 
built in to their helmets, why do our troops on Klendathu have to use 
hand-held flip-open communicators?  Where is the weaponry?  In the 
next three hundred years, will we not see development of beam weapons, 
improved flame-throwers, rail-guns, and other technologies of mayhem?  </P>
<P>Even more disturbing is the portrayal of the military mind-set here, 
from the cowardly general, all the way down to the hard-assed Sergeant 
Zim, the D.I.  There isn't a single one of these folks who isn't a 
caricature of something we've seen in six other movies.  And 
everywhere else, we've seen it better.  This script needed a John 
Milius or even an Oliver Stone -- someone who's seen actual combat.  
There's nothing on the screen to suggest real knowledge of military 
situations or the people who have been trained to deal with them.  The 
troops are not spread out properly, they don't move through the 
terrain properly, and in fact they walk unconcernedly through canyons 
where they KNOW bugs are watching from above.  </P>
<P>The biggest failure is that the picture makes little attempt to 
address the central issue of Heinlein's book -- personal 
responsibility.  Instead, the last act turns into a melodramatic 
mishmash with Juan Rico violating orders to go running off down a bug-
tunnel to rescue his long-lost love Carmen Ibanez (Dizzy having been 
conveniently disposed of earlier).  It's here that we finally get to 
meet a brain bug, with a face that looks something like a hyperactive 
rectum with teeth.  Our retreat back up the tunnel is covered by the 
courageous wounded fellow with theportable nuke -- just like Ripley's 
escape in ALIENS was covered by Vasquez and the Lieutenant triggering 
a grenade as those bugs came down the tunnel too.  </P>
<P>The directing is spectacular during the battle scenes -- and barely 
adequate almost everywhere else.  The cast is also adequate with no 
one bumping into the furniture.  Casper Van Dien is a likable 
(although anglicized) Johnny Rico.  Fortunately, none of these 
attractive young people are too hard on the eyes.  And just to make 
sure we get an eyeful, there's a coed shower scene that is enjoyably 
gratuitous.  Rico's best buddy, Carl, is played by Doogie Howser all 
grown up now -- who shows up at the end of the movie in Gestapo 
trenchcoat and cap, just like Halloween.  Are we supposed to like him 
or not?  Even the director isn't sure.  He careens between cynicism 
and affection, leaving us emotionally adrift, so most of the deaths 
here are meaningless.  </P>
<P>While I'm at it, I don't want to overlook the other cheesy production 
values.  Too many of the sets and props look like painted cardboard, 
hastily-designed and unconvincing.  They flash by too fast for 
examination, nothing registers on the viewer's consciousness with the 
kind of A-ha! experience we had when we first saw the Pan-Am flight 
boots in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  </P>
<P>Oh yes, and let's talk about the space technology.  We see Carmen 
Ibanez piloting a shuttle boat recklessly through a space station that 
is built as a ring around the moon.  We see her backing a starship out 
of its moorings like a teenage driver who has forgotten to release the 
emergency brake, and she damn near but not quite collides with 
everything she gets near.  And they say she's one of the BEST pilots?!  
I'll walk, thanks.</P>
<P>When the starships arrive on site...  ohboy, there's almost too many 
errors here to deal with.  First of all, they're all in formation so 
tightly packed that you couldn't set off a cherry bomb without 
destroying at least six of them.  Didn't anybody learn their lesson at 
Pearl Harbor?  You NEVER put your planes, ships, tanks, whatever so 
close together that they make a terrific target for the enemy.  Even 
during WWII (the big one), our convoys were never this closely 
grouped.  So of course, it's a disaster.  We get to see these 
monstrous starships, bursting into flame -- FLAMES in space?!!  -- 
bumping and colliding into each other like drunken elephants, and 
finally SINKING downward out of frame like the Titanic.  Excuse me?  
It doesn't work that way in space.</P>
<P>There's also an error of serious orbital mechanics.  The starships are 
shown in a stationary position over a single spot on the planet -- 
which makes them a terrific target, but is so wrong it's ridiculous.  
A geosynchronous position is approximately three planetary diameters 
out.  For an Earth-sized planet, that's 24,000 miles above sea level.  
That's impractical for a military mission.  What's wanted and needed 
here is a very low, very fast orbit which lets the mother ship drop 
its landing craft and be in position to pick them up again at two-hour 
intervals; it also makes the mother ship an extremely difficult target 
to hit from the ground.  But again, the filmmakers went for big, loud, 
and inaccurate because they assumed it would look better on the 
screen, and who would notice the difference anyway?</P>
<P>The bugs are interesting -- but other than the six legs, it's hard to 
figure out how the rest of the critter is put together.  And when we 
get to Klendathu, or any other bug planet,we're left with two 
questions: 1) Nothing's growing here.  What do these things eat?  And 
2) How are these critters throwing rocks at the Earth from half a 
galaxy away?  Faster-than-light rocks?  What are these bugs using for 
technology?  (And again, if the bugs can throw a small rock, then why 
can't they throw a large rock and wipe out the Earth altogether?)</P>
<P>The strength of STARSHIP TROOPERS is its digital effects, which are 
employed on an epic scale never seen before.  There is Oscar-winning 
work in this movie (which makes the failures of the script all the 
more depressing.)  As I said above, the battle sequences are 
unmatched.  It's the use of the technology that fails, not the 
technology.  For example, there is no dust on Klendathu.  No matter 
how much you blow up, every shot is clear all the way out to the 
horizon.  You would think with all those house-sized critters stamping 
their way across the landscape, you'd see some dust clouds rising on 
the other side of the hills...?  </P>
<P>Despite all this, I suspect audiences are going to enjoy themselves 
enormously.  There's room for a sequel, and as the second hundred 
million bucks rolls in at the box office, I'm sure the producers will 
begin planning STARSHIP TROOPERS II: THE REVENGE OF THE BUGS.</P>
<P>There's a lot to admire in STARSHIP TROOPERS, the movie.  
Unfortunately, there's not a lot to like.  STARSHIP TROOPERS, the 
book, was written with passion.  STARSHIP TROOPERS the movie has 
sacrificed passion and thoughtfulness for big digital bugs.  </P>
