<PRE>DON'T SAY A WORD
----------------</PRE>
<P>New York psychiatrist Dr. Nathan Conrad (Michael Douglas) is just trying to
get home to his laid-up wife Aggie (Famke Janssen, "Made") and eight year
old daughter Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiak, "The Cider House Rules") on 
Thanksgiving Eve when his friend Jerry Sachs (Oliver Platt, "Lake Placid")
sidelines him with the complex case of catatonic, but newly violent Elisabeth 
Burrows (Brittany Murphy, "Girl, Interrupted").  At home the next morning, 
Nathan finds his daughter kidnapped and himself in a race against time to 
unlock a number from Elisabeth's head in "Don't Say a Word."</P>
<P>After delivering two terrific performances as compromised characters last
year,
Michael Douglas ("Wonder Boys," "Traffic") takes the low road in this messy
children-in-distress potboiler from director Gary Fleder ("Kiss the Girls").</P>
<P>Nathan's presumed psychiatric expertise with teenagers is established by
his telling a panty-stealing preppie that 'we all did that.'  After
five minutes with Elisabeth, an eighteen year-old no one's been able to
properly diagnose in her last ten years of institutionalized life, Nathan
declares her a talented faker.  Elisabeth, creepily played by Murphy in
a first scene which recalls Linda Blair in "The Exorcist," apparently accepts
Nathan's analysis and begins to assist the doctor even though she fears
giving him the information 'they all want.'  So much for this film's tension.</P>
<P>Screenwriter Patrick Smith Kelly ("A Perfect Murder") serves up a bunch of
kidnappers who can set up security cameras and bugging devices anywhere they
want, but don't have the sense to move their kidnap victim out of her
mother's hearing range.  A scary looking kidnapper (Conrad Goode, "Tomcats")
begins to soften towards Jessie in a bit of character development that's
forgotten when it should count.  A police lieutenant (Jennifer Esposito,
"Made") remains on the outskirts of the action until coming into
play at the exact right moment during the film's never-ending climax.
The head of a Bellevue-like NYC hospital is stupid enough to deny knowledge 
of a woman who was not only his girlfriend, but interned under him, to a 
police detective.  </P>
<P>While Famke Janssen does her best with her "Sorry, Wrong Number" sideplot,
Michael Douglas is left to act determined while racing against an arbitrary
deadline.  The promising Brittany Murphy could have made something of her
role if the screenplay hadn't abandoned its intriguing setup as soon as it
introduced it.  Sean Bean ("Ronin") is a stock bad guy,  Oliver Platt
is saddled with a plot-driven character and poor Jennifer Esposito might
as well be in a different movie.  Young Skye McCole Bartusiak is believably
precocious as Jessie.</P>
<P>Cinematography by Amir Mokri ("Coyote Ugly") and production design by Nelson
Coates ("Kiss the Girls") are of higher caliber than the material warrants.
Director Gary Fleder, whose film has been leaking air throughout its entire
run time, lets the whole thing deflate as one climax leads to another which
leads to yet another, each seeming more like stalling for time than anything
else.</P>
<P>The old adage holds true - if you can't say something nice, "Don't Say a 
Word."</P>
