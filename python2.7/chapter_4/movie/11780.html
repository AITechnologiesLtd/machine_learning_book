<P>INSOMNIA (Norsk Filminstitutt, Nordic Screen Production A/S, 
Norsk Film A/S)</P>
<PRE>Certification: 15
Genre: Thriller
Cast: Stellan Skarsgård, Sverre Anker Ousdal, Bjørn Floberg
Directed by Erik Skjoldbjærg</PRE>
<PRE>My personal rating: 4+ out of 6</PRE>
<P>INSOMNIA is the typical psychological thriller where someone
did something very bad, and is haunted by the deed.</P>
<P>A young girl has been murdered, and two homicide detectives, 
Jonas Engström (Skarsgård) and Erik Vik (Ousdal), are sent to
conduct an investigation. Later on, the detectives discover a 
cabin where the suspect might be hiding. A fog covers the area, 
and during the operation one of the detectives shoot and kill 
the other by mistake. The local police believes that the suspect
was responsible, and the remaining detective must do whatever
he can to support that theory. But sinners don't sleep ...</P>
<P>INSOMNIA is Skjoldbjærg's first directing job, and he does it
quite well. The scenes are eerie, the psychological aspect is
always with us, and the pacing of the movie is excellent.
However, we sometimes find it difficult to fully understand
what is going on. This is not a movie where one can ask a lot
of questions; way enough trouble attempting to figure out what
is happening, rather than why.</P>
<P>The actors perform with great panache; there is nothing much to 
discuss there. Skarsgård has recently appeared in GOOD WILL 
HUNTING and AMISTAD. He certainly carries some creepiness and 
depth of character with him whereever he goes.</P>
<P>INSOMNIA is a tense and mildly violent thriller, and it
does well in the genre. I rate it 4+ out of 6.</P>
