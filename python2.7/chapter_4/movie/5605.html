<PRE>                  INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE
                       A film review by Ife Hsu
                        Copyright 1996 Ife Hsu</PRE>
<P>Paramount Release (1991)
Running Time: 2:05hr approx.
Starring: Harrison Ford, Sean Connery, Allyson Doody, River Phoenix.
Director: Steven Spielberg</P>
<P>It is always refreshing to watch [again] summer movies from
previous years and compare them with current movie flicks. This
is especially true given the emphasis placed on special effects
that seem to carry 1996 summer films. </P>
<P>Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade is the third movie in the
adventurous trilogy of Dr. Henry Jones, Jr. [Harrison Ford]. In
this entry, Indiana Jones attempts to rescue his father [Sean
Connery] and battles old nemesis in the journey for the Holy
Grail.  The journey is engaging, entertaining, and filled with
obstacles. </P>
<P>Even at the most dangerous barriers, this movie is light-hearted
and humorous. It contrasts heavily with the previous Indiana
Jones movie - The Temple of Doom, a dark and horrific tale drawn
on black magic and revengeful characters.  Some of the best
sequences in fact revolve around the chemistry of Ford and
Connery who find themselves at odd circumstances that call for a
level of personal interaction they are not accustomed to.  </P>
<P>Yes, this movie also had numerous special effects. But unlike
current movies, they are not designed to overshadow the
characters or undermine the storyline. Special effects are
utilized to enforce visualization, thus demonstrating how
drazzling some of Indiana Jones' stunts really are.  </P>
<P>Characterization is what makes Indiana Jones movies entertaining
and enjoyable.  Even removing the somewhat outdated special
effects, there remains a movie that can still be recommended.  </P>
