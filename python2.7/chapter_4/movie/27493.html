<PRE>THE GIFT
--------</PRE>
<P>Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett, "Elizabeth") is a recently widowed mother of
three boys trying to make ends meet in Brixton, Georgia.  Having inheritted
the gift of second sight from her granny, Annie gives readings to townsfolk
like battered wife Valerie Barksdale (Hillary Swank, "Boys Don't Cry").
When Jessica King, (Katie Holmes, "Wonder Boys") the daughter of the town's
wealthiest man and fiance of school principal Wayne Collins (Greg Kinnear)
has been missing for four days, Annie's asked to help in "The Gift."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>With the talent involved in this project, from director Sam Raimi ("A Simple
Plan") and cowriters Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson (both of "One False 
Move") to the unusual ensemble cast (featuring one Oscar winner - Swank, and 
three nominees - Blanchett, Kinnear and Rosemary Harris), one would expect 
"The Gift" to be one humdinger of a film.  Alas, although Blanchett once again 
gives a flawless performance, "The Gift" is a mediocre thriller.  Think "What 
Lies Beneath" crossed with "To Kill a Mockingbird."</P>
<P>Through Annie, we're introduced to the cast of characters. Buddy (Giovanni
Ribisi, "Boiler Room") is the slow witted auto mechanic who's devoted to Annie, 
but clearly is disturbed by something repressed from his childhood.  Valerie's
Annie's battered client who's abusive, redneck husband Donnie (Keanu Reeves)
threatens not only Annie, but her children, because of her 'interference' in
his marriage.  He's also known as a bit of a ladies' man, which makes Valerie
jealous.  Wayne Collins (Greg Kinnear) is the mild mannered school principal 
engaged to wild child rich girl Jessica (not only does Annie have a nightmarish 
vision upon meeting Jessica, she finds her in a compromising position in the 
country club ladies room on only her second encounter with the woman).  Already
we have more red herrings than we can shake a stick at.</P>
<P>The screenplay makes obvious choices and overplays its Southern Gothic hand
(Ribisi's character may as well have been called Boo Radley).  Character
development is lacking, particularly with Annie's three sons.  We're given
hints that Annie isn't coping well with her husband's death and that her 
behavior is impacting that of her eldest son, but the screenplay allows these 
hints to suffice rather than delving more deeply.  Wayne and Jessica as a 
couple are a head-scratcher.  The film's climax is more than a bit shopworn.</P>
<P>The cast is mostly fine with Blanchett elevating the film above its pulp
trash roots.  Reeves is quite effective as the brutish husband, creating a 
real fear of violence whenever he appears.  Swank follows her tour de force 
Oscar winning performance by playing it safe in a small supporting role.  
Gary Cole ("A Simple Plan") makes a mark as an unethical prosecution attorney.</P>
<P>Technically, the film is rather conventional showing none of the distinctive 
stylishness of Raimi's earlier work.  Kudos, though to visual effects 
supervisors Syd Dutton and Bill Taylor, who create some eerie visions from
Annie's point of view.  Original music by Christopher Young ("The Wonder Boys")
features fiddles to create a sense of place while also underlining the suspense.</P>
<P>As a filmgoing experience, "The Gift" is like getting a Crackerjacks prize in a 
Tiffany box.</P>
