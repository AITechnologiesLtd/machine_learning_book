<P>
The last book I finished is something discussing society's reactions to
apocalypse and millennium.  In particular, a good part of it is about
how evangelical Christianity is shaped by the idea of Christ's imminent
return: there's the various taxa of Biblical literalism, including
Pentacostalism, Seventh Day Adventism, and so on, and this odd division
between the usual fundamentalist Protestantism and the more
"charismatic" kind, which allows for such miracles as speaking in
tongues and physical manifestations of the Holy Ghost such as faith
healing.  (Yes, it's research on apocalyptic cults that I'm into right
now.)</P>
<P>So I took this odd ball framework for thinking about things into the
movie theater to see "The Apostle".  Did it help any?  I'm not sure.</P>
<P>After reading that book, you can see some of the beliefs that motivate
Duvall's character.  The "Great Commission" of evangelical Christianity
is the spreading of the Gospel to the four corners of the world.  That
God's word is heard in every land is one of the conditions for the End
Times, a necessary event for the Apocalypse and Millennium.  And, in
the film, the Apostle's life's work is the spreading of the word, and
the establishment of churches where there were none.  This evangelism
pervades the entire film, from the Duvall character, Sonny, as a child
listening bored to a preacher to the first scene with Duvall attempting
to convert the near comatose victims of a car wreck to the main act of
the film, the building of a church in a small bayou town.  This
evangelism would be expected in any film that dealt honestly with Bible
Belt Christianity.  Note that Duvall is terrific as a preacher,
absolutely believable.  I don't know what his religious background is,
but the character of Sonny the Evangelist comes to life in this film.</P>
<P>I'm not sure what this movie is "about" thematically.  (Arguably, there
are many themes, and I'm being silly trying to pin down one.)  There's
one theme of rebirth and redemption -- Sonny attempts to leave his past
behind -- and I think this is what the TV ads and movie theater
previews focus on.  Sonny has committed past crimes, and has tried to
atone for them by building a new church.  But this doesn't work for
me:  he's already a preacher, he's already built churches, and the
evangelism that forms the core of his life is unchanged.  He's God's
servant, whether settled in Texas, or scratching out a new life in
Louisiana.</P>
<P>There perhaps is the idea of the dichotomy of the awful, messy
day-to-day world, in which Sonny has to worry about church politics,
adultery, and, yes, murder, and the unambiguous spiritual world.  He
tries to escape one into another.  But this doesn't convince me: his
evangelical style is unchanged, and to a large part his spiritual world
dominates his material world.</P>
<P>More credibly is the portrait of a flawed man doing good work.  This
theme may be a return to basics, or at least the basics of
fundamentalist belief: we're all sinners, and we try to do what we can
in this world, in the time allowed to us.  Further, even though we're
sinners, we can do good things.  And so we have Sonny, never quite
escaping the problems of the day-to-day world, say, jealousy at the
sight of Miranda Richardson having lunch with her ex-husband, but also
never quite failing to do good things, in particular the church he
builds in the bayou.</P>
<P>And I think the idea of limited time animates the film.  We all know
Sonny's on the run, and that he expects the law to catch up with him
eventually.  We understand his presence in the church he builds is
provisional and temporary.  And so, we have his eagerness to get things
done, to do good work: he wants to build an orphanage as soon as
possible, even though his co-minister wants to take it one day at a
time.  And, perhaps the connection being entirely in my own mind, I
have to think of the book I'd read, and the description of evangelical
Christianity living in the shadow of the End Times: can I assume that
the film touches on this idea also, that everything is provisional?</P>
<P>Anyway, a couple bang-bang notes: the church is built next to a
graveyard.  This is perhaps unremarkable, but every panning shot of the
church shows these graves.  I'll argue that the small cemetery serves
the same purpose as the skull in still life paintings -- all the
delicious looking fruit (if the artist is any good) is just temporary,
and we're all mortal, and the skull reminds us of this.</P>
<P>I'm used to Billy Bob Thornton having really furrowed brows, but then I
only remember him from "Sling Blade".  I've seen other films with him,
but don't really recall him in them ("One False Move" is not a bad
film, though).</P>
<P>The film should be a reminder that our bicoastal perception of
fundamentalist Christianity is perhaps incomplete.  Living relatively
secular lives, as we do, we tend to see the fundies more as abortion
protesters and gay bashers.  We perhaps forget that, say, the civil
rights movement (and Abolition for that matter) was originally
spearheaded by evangelicals.  We may perhaps also throw in the
liberation theology of Latin American Catholics in the face of military
governments.  The complete picture has good parts and bad parts.</P>
<PRE>Oh, yes, thumbs up on the movie.</PRE>
