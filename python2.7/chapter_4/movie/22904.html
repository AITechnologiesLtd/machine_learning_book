<P>Move over, Supernova: I've already found my choice for second-worst 
flick of 2000. </P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **there's nothing to spoil here**)
Let's see...Eye (Ewan McGregor) is this super secret agent on His 
Majesty's Service (we know this, see, because we see him at the 
beginning of the movie taking pictures of his target with a rifle.  That 
wasn't a typo. A rifle.) who lives a hermetic life behind his computer 
screen, speaking to no one but his not-really-there daughter Lucy (Cara 
Reynolds) and his agency contact Hilary (k.d. lang).  Eye is losing 
touch with reality because his wife and daughter disappeared; he deals 
with it, see, by talking to his not-really-there daughter.  Hookay.</P>
<P>But wait, there's more!  Eye sees a Mysterious Stranger who he later 
learns is a criminal named Joanna Eris (Ashley Judd), and because his 
not-really-there daughter Lucy whispered "Rosebud"...uh, "don't leave 
her, daddy" to him, Eye stalks Joanna, making up in his mind that Joanna 
(who looks way older than him) is actually his daughter.  Hey, it gets 
worse: when Eye watches her kill some unknown guy for some unknown 
reason, he comes to the Brilliant Conclusion that, hey, she's the one 
for me!</P>
<PRE>I'm not exaggerating. </PRE>
<P>The Upshot:
Not-really-there daughter Lucy might as well have whispered "Rosebud" to 
Eye.  It would've made about as much sense as anything else in this 
wanna-be-Deep-but-just-plain-dumb, mess.</P>
<P>I pay "Eye" a compliment when I say "at least it was stylish".  But I'll 
let you in on a little secret: style without substance makes for a 
lonnnng 107 minutes.  I know that Earth Men Are Easy, but let me get 
this straight: boy stalks girl...boy sees girl kill other boy...weird 
boy falls for murderous girl?  Hookay.</P>
<P>It felt like I walked in on the second part of a two-part movie: the 
part I obviously didn't see was the one that explained what the heck 
this movie was about.   Whatever Stephan Elliot was smokin' when he came 
up with this one, I sure as hell don't want any of it. </P>
<P>Almost every single character's story made it seem like the whole damn 
cast and crew were on hallucinogens.  Joanna kills a guy she was about 
to screw for...what?  Hellifi know.  Joanna meets wastoid Gary (Jason 
Priestly), who proceeds to kick her butt for...what?  Hellifi know.  Dr. 
Brault (Genevieve Bujold), caretaker of a girl's detention center, was 
introducted for...what?  Helli...well actually, I know this one: we 
needed something, after all, that would Explain Joanna.  Of course, by 
the time Brault was introduced, it was too late; "Eye" had already 
crossed the stoopidity threshold, and there was no going back.</P>
<P>It's weird; the only part of this movie that actually seemed 
believable--when Joanna fell for rich but blind Alex Leonard (Patrick 
Bergin)--made the movie feel really unbalanced.  You see, believability 
and stoopidity are like oil and water; they just don't mix. </P>
<P>Anyone would want to see this movie for...what?</P>
<PRE>Hellifi know.</PRE>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]
We are represented here by way of a couple of big Black female beggars, 
and a dirty cop.  Not that that really mattered; the story itself, as 
well as all the characters in this flick (save Alex Leonard) were as 
unreal as not-really-there daughter Lucy. </P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line 
I *knew* there was a reason it took me so long to see this movie.</P>
<P>"Eye Of The Beholder" (rating: redlight)
Man, if only I believed in an eye for an Eye...</P>
