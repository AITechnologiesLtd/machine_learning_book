<P>     First, this important preface:  I love WINGS OF DESIRE.  Wim Wenders'
lyrical 1988 film, positing angels roaming through Berlin and one
particular angel fascinated with the human experience, caught me
completely by surprise when I first saw it.  It was less a narrative than
a visual tone poem of division -- between heaven and earth, between
monochrome and color, between East and West Berlin -- which eventually
finds unity.  The experience, terribly un-critic-like though it may sound,
was spiritually moving.  That emotional response contributed significantly
to me distaste for Wenders' own ill-fated attempt at a sequel, FARAWAY, SO
CLOSE!; it similarly led me to dread the impending arrival of the
Americanized re-make CITY OF ANGELS.  Why re-make perfection, especially
to engage in the typical Hollywood reductionism of making it all about the
love story between the curious angel and his human object of desire?</P>
<P>     Perhaps it is because I expected so little that I was so improbably
delighted by CITY OF ANGELS.  ANGELS does indeed move the love story to
the forefront, following an angel named Seth (Nicolas Cage) on his
observational wanderings through contemporary Los Angeles until he meets
and falls in love with troubled surgeon Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan).  Though
the decision to play up that relationship was certainly a practical one --
WINGS OF DESIRE's stream-of-consciousness eavesdropping hardly screams
"commercial" -- it also gives CITY OF ANGELS its unique identity.  Certain
specific elements remain from the original, including the library milieu
and a former angel (Peter Falk in the original, Dennis Franz here) who
acts as the angel's human guide, but screenwriter Dana Stevens and
director Brad Silberling choose to re-imagine the story from a different
perspective rather than re-make it.  The result is sort of a strange
cousin to ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD -- a story based on
existing characters and situations, yet thematically independent and
appealing in its own right.</P>
<P>     Much of that appeal springs from CITY OF ANGELS' commitment to
its tone.  Few mainstream Hollywood movies of recent years have been so
willing to adopt a reflective pace, to paint broad canvases of human
experience and allow us to watch in peace.  Cinematographer John Seale
(THE ENGLISH PATIENT) gives Los Angeles a serene, otherworldly glow, while
composer Gabriel Yared (also of THE ENGLISH PATIENT) lays an underscore of
hypnotic strings.  While never earth-shaking, Silberling's compositions
are rarely predictable and frequently memorable.  It's that rare
big-screen movie that uses the big screen, allowing its intimate story to
unfold in the grandeur of a massive city.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, it's that intimate story which will win over viewers.
Cage and Ryan make a superb romantic pair, each actor reaching for the
longing in their respective characters and connecting that longing to the
other.  Though Cage may not be the most obvious choice for a role based on
preternatural calm, the intensity percolating beneath his benevolent
glances heightens the anticipation of his possible "fall" to humanity.
It's a bit harder to get a handle on what Maggie wants from her
relationship with Seth, and harder still to care a whit about the
obviously superficial relationshp she is in when we first meet her.  Few
quibbles about the characters matter, however, when they share the screen;
the sheer force of their eye contact is often enough to wipe away any
doubts about their feelings.  A story about life-changing emotion is a
hard sell to cynical audiences, but Cage and Ryan sell it.</P>
<P>     For all its meaphysical musings, there's never any question that CITY
OF ANGELS is an old-style Hollywood love story, a multi-hanky weeper light
years removed from the dream-like WINGS OF DESIRE.  It's almost enough to
make you forget that ANGELS is based on WINGS...which, for my money, is
the best thing that possibly could have happened.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 lost angels:  8. </PRE>
