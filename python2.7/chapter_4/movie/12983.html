"Six Days, Seven Nights" - Feels Like an Eternity</PRE>
<P>As I sat during the first 15 minutes of this movie, a movie billed as an
adventure/romance/comedy, I could see the signs that this outing would
not be a trip through paradise.  First we meet the diminutive Anne Heche
portraying Robin, an editor of a woman's magazine called Dazzle.  With
an extremely busy schedule, which is a model of chaos, she barely has
time for her wimpy but romantic boyfriend Frank.  Although he lavishes
her with roses and surprises her with a trip to a pacific island
paradise, he doesn't really exude a manliness that would attract any
kind of woman.  Then again, Frank is played by Friends co-star, David
Schwimmer.  Meanwhile, Anne Heche isn't exactly interested in men, is
she?  Perhaps that's the comedic launching point for this exercise in
miscasting.  </P>
<P>In order to reach their final destination, Robin and Frank need to
charter a plane, which is piloted by Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford).
Quinn is a sometimes-drunk beach bum who seems content on living simple
life, which includes trying to pick up women, hanging out with his
voluptuous co-pilot, and eking out a meager existence through his
charter service.  Adventure finally dribbles into the film when Robin is
ordered to attend a nearby photoshoot.  Needing to leave the island, she
enlists Quinn, and off they fly into a nasty storm, which throws them
off course and forces them to land on some uninhabited island.</P>
<P>Realizing that the plane is heavily damaged and that it is unlikely that
no one will find them, Robin begins to ooze with bitchiness.  "Don't you
have any skills," she yells.  "You know, one of those guys you send out
into the wilderness with a pocket knife and a Q-Tip and they build you a
shopping mall?"  Meanwhile, Quinn tries to think of a way for them to
get off the island.  During the next couple of days, they have to trek
through miles of forest and mountainous terrain, avoid being bitten by
snakes and scorpions, and allude pirates (???) that conveniently show up
to try to heighten the movie's level of suspense.  Maybe Quinn can find
a way to save themselves, but even Harrison Ford can't save this
underdeveloped melange of genres.</P>
<P>Here's an example.  There's a beautiful scene when Heche and Ford
lustily kiss on the beach as the ocean tide gently crashes around them à
la From Here to Eternity.  But what led up to this kiss?   Ford's Quinn
is very likable and resourceful.  This ruggedness attracts Robin, which
gives us what, I suppose, passes as the romantic aspect.  But although
Robin is plucky, her acerbic attitude and her uncanny ability to worsen
the situation (firing off their only flare into a tree, opening an
inflatable life raft while in the plane) makes her more of an annoyance
rather than a believable love interest.  And couldn't someone think of a
better crisis situation rather than modern-day pirates?  </P>
<P>There are the occasional chuckles and there are certain moments where
Heche shines and many moments that show us why Harrison Ford is a true
leading man.  But without the presence of Ford and the likable charm of
Heche, this film would find its way into the video store in less time
than the title of the movie.</P>
