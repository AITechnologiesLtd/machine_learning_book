SHANGHAI NOON</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Tom Dey
Written by: Miles Millar, Alfred Gough</PRE>
<P>It's 1881, and the royal Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) has fled her home
in China's Forbidden City to visit the west. Unfortunately she has
been kidnapped, and the ransom has been set at one hundred thousand
pieces of gold. Three royal guards have been sent to America to
deliver the gold.  Accompanying them is Chon Wang (Jackie Chan), a
guard who is not particularly popular among his people for reasons
never explained to us.  As Wang's group heads toward Carson City to
deliver the gold, their train is robbed by the surfer like Roy
O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) and his gang of rather brain dead thugs. Wang
is seperated from the other guards. He forms an unlikely alliance with
O'Bannon in an attempt to rescue the princess on his own. Accompanying
the two very different men are Wang's new wife, Falling Leaf (Brandon
Merrill), who turns out to be an expert marksman, and a horse who can
follow commands better than any dog. Against them are a group of
renegade lawmen led by the evil, blood-thirsty Marshall Van Cleef
(Xander Berkeley) and a former Chinese warrior (Roger Yuan), who now
runs a labor camp.</P>
<P>As everyone knows, Jackie Chan movies are not held to the same
standard as most other films. Chan's films are present for no other
reason than to entertain with slapstick humor and amazing acts of
physical dexterity.  I'm happy to say that on both counts, "Shanghai
Noon" delivers. Does that mean this is a great film? No, of course
not. A Jackie Chan movie can never be classified as great. "Shanghai
Noon" Is really nothing more than goofy, mindless fluff that audience
members will forget days after viewing.  Does that mean there's
nothing deep and meaningful about this movie? Frankly, yes. The
subject of the treatment of Chinese workers in the old west is touched
upon briefly; but you'll be pleased to hear that the remainder of the
film is devoted entirely to Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson acting like
goofballs, and the two get some great goofball scenes together. Two of
the funniest ones are where they have to escape from a jail cell, and
another where they play a rather bizarre drinking game in a whore
house.</P>
<P>Jackie Chan has been called the Buster Keaton of the '90s. At first I
didn't believe this to be an accurate statement, since many of his
older films ("Rumble in the Bronx" in particular) are a little more
serious.  However, after the release of "Rush Hour" two years ago,
Chan has shown himself to be quite the comedian. While physical comedy
is obviously his forte, Chan is also a master of hysterical facial
expressions. Watch his face in a scene where tomahawks are being
hurled at him. On the other hand, Owen Wilson ("The Haunting") is
great at dialogue driven comedy. He is given some of the movie's best
lines like, "Stop it! We're men, we're not pinatas." Yet despite some
great comical moments, I had a hard time seeing Wilson as anything
more than a surfer stuck in the old west. Chan and Wilson obviously
make up the majority of the film, with the other characters amounting
to little more than props. Lucy Liu ("Play it to the Bone") gives a
strangely subdued performance and hardly appears in the
picture. Xander Berkely ("Gattaca") is strangely amusing, rather than
scary, considering the type of character he is supposed to be playing.</P>
<P>Okay everyone, you're obviously going to see "Shanghai Noon" to watch
Jackie Chan do some amazing acrobatics using all sorts of
scenery. Thankfully there is quite a bit more action here than was
present in "Rush Hour". He also gets some interesting props to work
with: like a horseshoe tied to a rope; a pair of antlers sans moose;
and in a rather amazing scene, a few pine trees.  It's also a lot of
fun watching Chan's old fashion warrior try and use a six shooter for
the first time. The movie's main faults come from some interesting
minor characters being given no screen time. Brandon Merrill's
character is especially interesting, but she appears in the film for
no more than two minutes at a time. Another problem is a gratingly bad
soundtrack, which doesn't fit the movie in any way. The movie ends
with Chan's trademark outtakes which were some of the funniest I've
seen from one of his movies.  Also, watch for an appearance by
"Revenge of the Nerds" star Curtis Armstrong. "Shanghai Noon" runs a
bit too long at 110 minutes, when Chan's movies should always stick to
a 90 minute running time. I'd recommend the film to anyone who enjoyed
"Rush Hour" and give it three and a half out of five stars.</P>
