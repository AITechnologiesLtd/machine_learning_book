<PRE>`Payback' – Sadistic Fun
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>Don't mess with Porter (Mel Gibson) because if you do, he'll take
matters into his own hands in a moment's notice.  Don't cross him
because if you do, you're going to feel his wrath.  Don't steal from
him, because if you do, he will stop at nothing to exact revenge.  It
doesn't matter what his obstacles are in his way and it doesn't matter
how well you try to prepare yourself.  This is a man that is extremely
clever, and when he finds you, he'll give you a smirk and coldly pull
that trigger…even if it's only for a paltry $70,000.</P>
<P>After a flawlessly executed heist, Porter and his partner, Val (Gregg
Henry), make off with a cool $140,000.  Half of it will be given to
Porter, but in this line of work, double-crosses are not uncommon. 
Although Val made off with the entire amount, his gravest error was
that he left Porter alive.   After recovering, Porter wants his share
and he'll do whatever it takes.  It's time for a little payback.  And
that's what this film is about.  There are no twists or turns.  Porter
wants his money, and the situations that he encounters en route to his
money are rather entertaining.</P>
<P>A couple of things makes this movie entertaining.  Foremost is Gibson,
who looks very comfortable as a bad guy who uses a sordid sense of
cruelty to accomplish his goals.  He's not intimidated by anyone nor
does he show any fear.  In fact, he welcomes danger.  He's just plain
crazy, which makes him fun to watch.  Why risk your life for a mere
$70,000 of money that wasn't yours to begin with? To get what he
wants, he has to outmaneuver corrupt policemen, old enemies, and a
host of hit men.  But he's also believably clever.  So despite the
fact that he gets into situations that are more or less suicidal, he
manages a way to save himself and get closer to payback.  The other is
the sense of style that this film projects.  Written by Brian
Helgeland, who co-wrote `L.A. Confidential,' there are some clever
elements where Porter finds ways of tricking the enemy and
unexpectedly turning the tables on others.   Once the movie sets its
tone, you'll also find humor (believe me, you will) in the absurdity
of the violence (smashed fingers, crushed toes, groin stomping, and
lots of other painful scenes).  The violence is warped in the same
manner that sex was warped in `There's Something About Mary.'  One of
the more amusing (or bent) supporting players was Lucy Liu, who played
Val's psuedo-girlfriend and leather-clad dominatrix.  In one scene,
Porter threatens Val with bodily harm.  Before he can strike him, she
begs Porter to stop and then proceeds to beat him up instead.  When
Val tries to hit her back, Porter points the gun at him and says, `Let
her finish her work.'  If you like this film, you'll discover that you
may have a delightfully cruel sense of entertainment.  I did.</P>
