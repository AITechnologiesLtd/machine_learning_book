SEVEN     1995
Reviewed by Pierce Dalton
2 stars (out of 4)</PRE>
<PRE> Seven is more a 2 or 1 on the scale of intensity.</PRE>
<P> But, definitely a 10 on the cheap shock scale.</P>
<P> An overly hyped film by the director of the equally trashy Alien 3, and the
future director of the Michael Douglas thriller The Game, Seven is what a cheap
knock-off of Silence of the Lambs looks like.</P>
<P> If you haven't heard the tale, it's about two cops tracking down a serial
killer who kills by the way of the seven deadly sins: sin, greed, lust, etc.</P>
<P> Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman offer good performances, but, poor Kevin Spacey
is reduced to slasher-flick-madman gimmicks.</P>
<P> Worth a look if you like gruesome make-up effects.</P>
<PRE> Seven is flat-out slush.</PRE>
