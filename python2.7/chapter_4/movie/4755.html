<P>     There's a fundamental flaw in MR. WRONG's premise.  This is a 
romantic comedy parody, but how can you satirize something that's a 
comedy to begin with?  If this motion picture is an example, not only 
can't it be done, but the result is downright ugly.  Every year, there 
are handful of movies that aren't remotely funny, and MR. WRONG has the 
dubious distinction of falling into that category.  Try as it might with 
its sophomoric humor and dumb one-liners, this film never got so much as 
a chuckle out of me.  </P>
<P>     Someone must find Ellen DeGeneres appealing -- after all, she's got 
her own TV show and now has a starring role in a motion picture.  Based 
on her performance in MR. WRONG, however, it's impossible to uncover the 
source of her attraction.  She has no discernible acting ability, no 
screen presence, and she's certainly not funny (at least not in this 
context).  In fact, the best adjective to describe DeGeneres is 
irritating.  And since she's in almost every scene of MR. WRONG, that 
makes for a very long ninety-two minutes.</P>
<P>     The film opens by introducing us to Martha (DeGeneres), a thirty-
one year old who's getting pressure from every side to find a nice guy, 
settle down, and get married.  Alas, most of the men she dates are 
walking testimonials to the single life -- until Whitman (Bill Pullman), 
that is.  She meets him in a bar late one Valentine's Day.  They hit it 
off immediately, spending the night whispering sweet nothings to one 
another in front of a roaring fire.  Martha is in love, and, what's 
more, her parents and sister are thrilled by her new beau.  Slowly, 
however, Whitman begins to show signs of abnormal behavior:  breaking 
his finger as a sign of his undying love, shoplifting to have fun, and 
peeping into Martha's bedroom window while dressed as a clown.  Worse 
still, Whitman's ex-girlfriend (Joan Cusack) wants Martha to suffer a 
very nasty accident, like being eaten alive by ants.  It doesn't take 
long for Martha to realize that, despite his millions of dollars and 
neverending protestations of affection, Whitman isn't the kind of guy a 
woman wants to spend the rest of her life with.</P>
<P>     Not even a series of unusual cameos can save MR. WRONG.  Despite 
being way over the top, the normally-delightful Joan Cusack is simply 
dreary as the only character in the film more obsessed than Whitman.  
Dean Stockwell is on hand as a no-nonsense private eye who turns against 
Martha when offered a fat payoff.  And Joan Plowright gets a paycheck 
slumming as Whit's overattentive mother.</P>
<P>     The idea behind MR. WRONG is to set up a typical romantic comedy 
scenario, then, twisting events in the most bizarre fashion imaginable, 
lampoon the genre for all it's worth.  Even with Mr. Nice Guy, Bill 
Pullman (SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING), playing off his 
own reputation, the movie misfires in a big way.  The choppy script 
substitutes stale, unimaginative material for clever, biting wit.  In 
its failed attempt to launch an acid attack on overly sweet romances, 
MR. WRONG ends up causing heartburn.</P>
