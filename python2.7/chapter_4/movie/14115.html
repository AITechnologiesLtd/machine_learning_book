<PRE>**** out of *****</PRE>
<P>The "meatgrinder" of Omaha Beach has rarely been as vividly portrayed
as it is in Steven Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Horrific war
imagery is not a new cinematic device: it's at least as old as the
floating severed arm (and oblivious owner) in Cornel Wilde's 1967
classic, BEACH RED. What IS new is Spielberg's portrayal of
shell-shocked GI's weeping hysterically, or gleefully blasting
surrendering Germans: as I watched the scenes of carnage unfold, it
seemed to me that we were at last going to gain some new insights into
the physical and moral convulsion known as war.</P>
<P>Spielberg is merciless in his portrayal of what happens to the bodies
(and minds) of men under continuous, withering fire. But once "Captain
Miller" (and the story) move off Omaha Beach, things change...almost
as if Spielberg has had a "change of heart", not toward war, but
toward those who participate in it and prolong it.</P>
<P>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN has been touted as "anti-war" simply because it
DOES confront us with those ghastly images. But a TRUE "anti-war" film
should feature characters that are morally doubles for those images;
but Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and his little Squad would not be out
of place in a John Wayne epic.</P>
<P>Perhaps Spielberg is exploring his own ambivalent feelings about
war. As a citizen of the "enlightened nineties" he cannot help but be
disgusted with the waste and the suffering it epitomizes. But he is
also aware that without men like Captain Miller rushing deliberately
into harm's way at Omaha Beach, "Schindler" and the constuitents of
that famous "List" might well have been reduced to ashfall in a Polish
meadow.</P>
<P>Are the American GI's (and their British and Canadian Counterparts) to
be seen as ordinary, decent men--or just simple-minded, suicidal
pawns? Spielberg, for all his revulsion towards war, simply cannot
bring himself to condemn those who don military uniforms. It almost
seems as if he is trying to atone for the way his generation presented
returning Viet Nam vets with bags of dog excrement: certainly the
quest for the elusive "Ryan", with its objective of "saving" instead
of "slaying", seems almost too perfect a reversal of the premise of
Francis Ford Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW.</P>
<P>Again and again, Spielberg brings us to the brink of
revelation....only to draw back at the last second. He cannot, like
Richard Attenborough in A BRIDGE TO FAR, bring himself to show us the
"Ryan Rescue Mission" as a pointless, bloody debacle. Nor can he, like
Michael Caton-Jones' 1990 version of MEMPHIS BELLE, make Miller and
his brave band mere fodder for the cold-blooded machinations of a
Public Relations Department. Had he done so, we might have had some
subjects for serious debate here, and not simply "discussion points",
and might have found some answers.....</P>
<P>How does a man who dispatched 94 men to their deaths, avoid becoming
himself a dehumanized killing machine? How does the Company Sniper (a
nod to Howard Hawks' SERGEANT YORK?) reconcile Scripture passages with
his murderous specialty? SAVING PRIVATE RYAN gives us no
"answers"...only more questions.</P>
<P>In William Wellman's 1949 classic, BATTLEGROUND, a Chaplain begins his
Christmas Sermon to the battered Bastogne defenders with the words,
"Was this Trip necessary?" One might almost ask, of SAVING PRIVATE
RYAN, "Was this Movie necessary?" The answer in both cases is an
unequivocal "YES!" Yes,--because for all its reluctance to "take
chances", SAVING PRIVATE RYAN comes about 20 years after
Attenborough's epic--and may enocourage a generation to think about
the sacrifices that made its very existence possible, and hopefully to
look at the work of other, earlier directors who risked their souls
(and careers) to explore this brutal and bloody phenomenon that seems
so unthinkable--and yet at times, so very tragically "necessary".</P>
