<P>Jerry Bruckheimer is one of those producers who surprise me from time to 
time.  He can come up with over-the-top stuff like Top Gun, utter garbage 
like Days of Thunder, and then he has those brilliant moments where he 
produces marvelously watchable movies like The Rock and Crimson 
Tide.  Remember the Titans falls into the last category, a marvelously 
watchable and entertaining film out of the Bruckheimer production stalls.</P>
<P>Remember the Titans takes place in 1971.  It is a movie that uses football 
as the backdrop for a story about race relations.  A new football coach 
moves into Alexandria, Va.  This coach, Coach Boone (Denzel Washington), is 
part of an integration program in Alexandria.  As events take it, the 
school board replaces current coach, Coach Yoast (Will Patton) with Boone 
and this does not settle well.</P>
<P>The conflict in the movie is that of race.  The integration of the two 
major races in Alexandria causes much pain and this is shown in the 
microcosm present with the players as they go to training camp with coaches 
Boone and Yoast.  Together, the two coaches must both get their racially 
mixed team working together and also accept each other and work together to 
win.</P>
<P>Remember the Titans made me emotional from the get-go, something most 
movies can't do to me  even the most polished tear-jerker from Steven 
Spielberg can't do this!  The well-written script by Gregory Allen Howard 
and the steady direction by Boaz Yakin (Fresh) put me into tears by the end 
of the film.  This movie is the perfect definition of a feel-good film.</P>
<P>Denzel Washington and Will Patton both give excellent 
performances.  Washington is one of the best actors in Hollywood and he 
lives up to that with his performance in Titans.  Patton who doesn't get 
enough plum roles is given a chance to really perform and he does.  The two 
performances are what nail this movie.  The other players are good also, 
though the script doesn't give us enough time to bond with all the 
players  I got a few of the players confused after a while.  But there are 
two standout performers, they are Wood Harris (as Big Ju) and Ryan Hurst 
(as Bertier).  These two performers are excellent.</P>
<P>Don't Miss Remember the Titans.  It will make you laugh and it'll make you 
cry.  But, in the end, Remember the Titans will make you feel good.  And 
Jerry, please produce more good movies like this.</P>
