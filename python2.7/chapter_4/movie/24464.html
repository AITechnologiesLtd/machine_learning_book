<P>         Once upon a time, there was a movie queen named Kathleen, who
starred in great films like ``Body Heat,'' ``Romancing the Stone,''
``The Accidental Tourist'' and ``War of the Roses.'' She was
beautiful, talented, rich and famous, and seemed destined to live
happily ever after.</P>
<P>  Then one day, the Wicked Witch of the West Coast blew into
town and put an evil spell on Kathleen that ruined her taste in
scripts. ``Everyone will adore you in `V.I. Warshawski,' and playing a
plump frump in `House of Cards' will do wonders for your sex appeal,''
advised the wily witch.  Before Kathleen knew it, she herself was
playing a witch and not very well, either.</P>
<P>  ``Hmmm,'' Kathleen thought, ``whatever happened to that happy
ending?''</P>
<P>  It's nowhere to be found in ``A Simple Wish,'' Kathleen
Turner's latest kamikaze mission. Perhaps she figured playing an
over-the-top villainess would give her career a needed boost, a la
Glenn Close doing Cruella DeVil.</P>
<P>  Sadly, Turner's turn is more reminiscent of Bette Midler
muddling through ``Hocus Pocus.'' ``A Simple Wish'' works overtime to
please, but to no avail. There's one inspired sight gag, but it
scarcely redeems the rest of this debacle.</P>
<P>  Martin Short, seemingly trying out a bad Jim Carrey
impersonation, is Murray, a less-than-gifted fairy godmother who turns
up in New York to assist a little girl.</P>
<P>  The child in question is Anabel (Mara Wilson), a veritable
fountain of faith, whose belief in magic irks her cynical brother
Charlie (Francis Capra, a youngster unencumbered by anything
resembling talent). ``There are no fairy godmothers in Manhattan!''
scoffs Charlie, a line that should bring down the house when ``A
Simple Wish'' plays the East Village.</P>
<P>  Shortly after Murray botches Anabel's wish, evil ex-fairy
Claudia (Turner) and her assistant Boots (Amanda Plummer) sweep into
town to swipe the magic wands from all the current wish-granters. The
ensuing comic clash between inept Murray and smarmy Claudia is almost
as funny as ``Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' and every bit as
magical.</P>
<P>  ``A Simple Wish'' offers a textbook example of all the worst
tendencies of `family entertainment,' including cut-rate
special-effects, a slapdash script, and the lamest one-liners this
side of ``Batman & Robin.''  Turner is neither campy nor creepy, and
the scene in which Short and Plummer bark and snarl at each other must
surely mark an all-time low for both actors.  Adorable Wilson looks on
the verge of embarassment throughout, as well she should.</P>
