<PRE>eXisTenZ
(1999)</PRE>
<P>Directed by David Cronenberg
Starring : Jude Law, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Don McKellar</P>
<P>Running Time approximately 1hr 40mins</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Jack Choo</PRE>
<PRE>Rating : ** out of *****</PRE>
<P>The movie starts with a rather se7en-ish opening sequence, rather cool and
sets the mood for things to come. The story propels the audience into a
neo-reality; somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird
tinges of blue and red. eXisTenZ is actually the name of a new
virtual-reality game. Supposedly, VR games are highly popular as is
considered a legal-drug in this neo-reality. **** (Leigh) is the ultimate
game creator and introduces her ultimate game-experience in the form of
eXisTenZ. Players are required to have bio-ports embedded in their spine,
which plugs to a game-pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience.</P>
<P>During a secretive beta-testing-cum-teaser meeting for this new game, an
assassination attempt on *** life occurs and she runs off with fellow
bodyguard *** (Law). *** is more of a realists than anything else, afraid
that he'll lose reality if he begin to play these games but *** requires his
help to immerse together with her into eXisTenZ to check if the program is
still functioning properly after the assassination attempt. As they soon
discover, they are transported between realities within eXisTenZ  uncovering
more than they initially expected.</P>
<P>eXisTenZ has all the Cronenberg-gore that is expected of him. Even so, this
film is no-where near his cult classics such as Videodrome or Scanners. Not
even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful The Fly. eXisTenz
can probably be looked upon as his 90's version of Videodrome, even so, it
is a poor follow-up. While in most of his famed films, his penchant for gore
always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot. In eXisTenz, the
gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an
act of over-indulgence than anything else.</P>
<P>Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, both commendable actors, looked aloof and
miss-directed throughout the entire film. The scripting and acting barely
pulls the film out of the B-grade category. It was obvious that Cronenberg
worked on a really tight-budget and it seems that he handled that pretty
well in the production design and values created for this film (the opening
sequence, though, probably formed a considerable portion of the budget!)
which is actually quite good.</P>
<P>eXisTenZ is too predictable and cliched in these times. 10 years ago, it
would have been another classic for Cronenberg. Cronenberg fans however,
(those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on
film) should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can
still be offered by you.</P>
