<PRE>Movie Review: A Bug's Life
Review By: Ryan Davis</PRE>
<P>        It's rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies
come out in a single year, but that is what Disney and Pixar Animation;s
latest film represents.  While A Bugs Life isn't nearly as deep as it's
predecessor, Dreamwork's Antz, it is just as funny.</P>
<P>        A Bug's Life centers, appropriately, around the life of an ant, named
Flik. Flik, cutely voiced by Newsradio's David Foley, hates sticking too
tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task.
When one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost, the
leaders of the Colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way.</P>
<P>The offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants
too harvest for them. The leader of the grasshoppers is Hopper, who is
fiendishly voiced by Oscar winner Kevin Spacey.  When the offering is lost
Hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the
amount of food. When the leaders of the ant colony send Flik out on his
mission, they never dream he will be successful, they just hope they can get
him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food.</P>
<P>Flik's mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the
grasshoppers when they return. Instead Flik accidentally hires circus
performing bugs, who he mistakenly assumes are warriors. When he returns with
the `warriors', the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their
heroes.</P>
<P>A Bug's Life has animation that is simply stunning. The sheer
uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative. Together with the
great voice acting, this film is the perfect holiday family film. Its main
weakness is that it couldn't beat Antz to the theaters, making it seem like
stale material.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
