<P>I've never been a big fan of the whole "sword and sorcery" genre.  Not
for any particular reason mind you, it's just never help much appeal
to me.  As a result, I'd never even considered watching a second of
John Boorman's Excalibur.  Now, eighteen years after it's release
comes a DVD of the film... so I decided I'd give it a shot.  I'm
thrilled that I did, as Excalibur is one of the best told stories I've
seen in a long time.</P>
<P>Surely everyone is familiar in some way with the legend of King
Arthur, but I doubt there's a better representation of it on film than
this one.  Excalibur begins as the wizard Merlin (Nicol Williamson)
strikes a deal with Uther (Gabriel Byrne) to help Uther bed the woman
he desires, even though it has caused war amongst the people of the
land.  As a result of this encounter, Arthur is born.  Due to the
bargain previously struck, Merlin takes young Arthur away with him.</P>
<P>Arthur (Nigel Terry) grows to be a man and one day, by complete random
chance, pulls the mighty Excalibur from the stone in which it was
thrust into by Uther years earlier.  This signifies that Arthur is now
king of the land.  Much follows, including the rise and fall of
Camelot, the introduction of the knights of the round table, meeting
Lancelot (Nicholas Clay) and his subsequent affair with Arthur's wife
Guenevere (Cherie Lunghi), and the battles between Merlin and Arthur's
half-sister Morgana (a gorgeously young Helen Mirren).</P>
<P>Excalibur holds up incredibly well considering it's age... more than
likely due to the incredibly compelling story.  Great production
values and use of music (both original score by Trevor Jones and
familiar stock music from Richard Wagner and Carl Orff) compliment
this experience.</P>
<P>Excalibur is available on DVD from Warner Home Video.  It contains the
film in it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1, a commentary
track with director John Boorman, a biography and filmography for
Boorman, and the film's original theatrical trailer.</P>
<P>I'm not sure why, but I wasn't expecting much from the commentary by
John Boorman.  To my surprise though it was very informative.  Boorman
does take his time, and sometimes leaves gaps of silence between bits
of information, but he's still knowledgeable about seemingly every
aspect of this film.  Most directors I hear do commentary about a film
that they made years earlier tend to forget many of the tiny
details... like actor's names for example.  In those cases, directors
usually bring along a director of photography or co-producer to ask
questions to in order to help refresh their memory.  But Boorman's
there all by himself, able to identify things as detailed as every
different filming location, even when they change two or three times
in a single scene (unfortunately, if you've never been in Ireland you
won't know where he's talking about).  Boorman's commentary is also
highly complimentary.  He's very giving with kind words to both cast
and crew.</P>
<P>Some interesting tidbits of info he shares: Helen Mirren and Nicol
Williamson couldn't stand one another based on an event from their
past, and both threatened not to do the film if they had to work with
one another.  Boorman was able to convince them both to do the film,
and since their characters are enemies he was able to use their
natural animosity towards one another for their performances.  Also,
Liam Neeson and Mirren had a relationship for a year or two after they
met on the set.  And Boorman still has the sword Excalibur, Helen
Mirren's breastplate, and the Holy Grail in his home (that's got to be
a surreal experience to walk into your living room and see the Holy
Grail sitting on your mantle).</P>
<P>Excalibur is a great film, and this is a great DVD to own.  The
transfer is great... making it hard to believe that the film is over
18 years old.  If it weren't for the familiar faces in the cast you'd
think this was a recent effort.  If you're a fan of sword and sorcery,
a Boorman fan, or just love great storytelling, get yourself a copy of
this one.  [R]</P>
