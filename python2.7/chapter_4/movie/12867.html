<PRE>BEYOND SILENCE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Director Caroline Link's German film, BEYOND SILENCE (JENSEITS DER
STILLE), was a nominee this year for best foreign language film at the
Academy Awards.  (It lost to the Dutch film CHARACTER).  Just beginning
to open around the United States, BEYOND SILENCE tells the tender story
of a girl, Lara, whose parents are deaf.</P>
<P>     Extremely well cast and acted throughout, the movie stars Tatjana
Trieb as the 8-year-old Lara and Sylvie Testud as Lara at age 18.  The
two attractive actresses look and act remarkably alike, and they both
bear an uncanny resemblance to Emmanuelle Laborit, who plays Lara's
mother.  Howie Seago plays the handsome father.</P>
<P>     Divided into 2 distinct acts, the movie's more consistent first
part has the younger Lara coping with the challenges of learning to
read in a household where she is the only one who can speak.  Her
parents rely on her for everything, including negotiating on their
behalf with telephone callers.  This places significant pressure on her
young shoulders, which she, nevertheless, manages to put to her
advantage.</P>
<P>     "My reading is improving but isn't perfect yet," is how Lara
translates into sign language her teacher's much more dismal report on
her lack of progress, but her parents never seem to catch on to her
chicanery.  Scenes like these hold much promise, but the timidity of
the director cuts most of them short before they are ever allowed to
develop their full potential.</P>
<P>     After Lara learns to play the clarinet, much to her parents'
chagrin, the movie makes a smooth transition to Lara as an older teen.
She is ready to go out into the world and seek a profession, thanks to
the help of her Aunt Clarissa (Sibylle Canonica), a fellow clarinetist.</P>
<P>     The disorganized second act has many magical scenes which, once
again, the director seems reluctant to allow to come to fruition.  And
as she did in the first part, the director telegraphs her punches.  The
movie's one genuine tragedy is so obviously announced and reannouced
that you get tired waiting for it to happen.</P>
<P>     One lucky day, Lara spies a handsome, signing-man named Tom,
played by the charismatic Hansa Czypionka.  They quickly fall in love
with each other, and she tells him of her hopes for the future.  "Hope
is a widespread fantasy," he admonishes her.  Soon thereafter they are
dancing and signing to a pulsating rendition of Gloria Gaynor's "I Will
Survive."  This scene literally bursts with exuberance.</P>
<P>     This pleasant enough film possesses a promising plot and good
acting but remains adverse to risk taking.  The director leaves out any
tension and smoothes out the rough edges so that the resulting picture
only sporadically rises above the ordinary.</P>
<P>     BEYOND SILENCE runs 1:49.  It is in German and in sign language,
both with English subtitles.  The film is not rated but might be PG-13
for a brief scene of sexuality and would be fine for kids ten and up.</P>
