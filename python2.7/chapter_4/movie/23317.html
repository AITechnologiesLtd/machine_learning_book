<PRE>It's not charity work
Boiler Room</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>An excellent narrative lead-in brings us up to speed on our main character's
motivations. Giovanni Ribisi isn't about to slip into the conventional work
week only to trudge the rest of his life for a livable salary. Nope, he's a
sharp New York kid and he's going to find a way to make a million bucks some
other way. Even if it's slightly below legal standards.</P>
<P>Enter Ben Affleck (briefly anyway) who can "sell bubble gum to the lockjaw
patients at Bellevue." Giovanni takes the bait, diving into a stock-selling
brokerage of sorts paying larger than seemingly possible commissions to its
obsessed new recruits. It's a young industry as Ben says, "I'm 26 and I'm a
senior citizen."</P>
<P>The bland looking Giovanni is puppy-dog perfect with his attentive, yet
skeptical, always-thinking plain-faced appearance. A very good actor he.</P>
<P>Giovanni's folks aren't so easy to please. The best scenes of the movie are
between he and his judge-dad, "I'm not your best friend, I'm your father."
Giovanni desperately tries to explain his side, his father interrupts, "What
side? You're wrong!"</P>
<P>Vin Diesel also gives a fine performance as the senior partner who takes
Giovanni under his wings.</P>
<P>Backed by rap music, a pretty good script faulters a bit when it rushes the
progress and consequences of one of Ribisi's clients. Still ... quite
entertaining.</P>
