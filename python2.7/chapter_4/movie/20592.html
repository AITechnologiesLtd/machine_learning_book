<PRE>"For Love of the Game" -- Baseball Story is a Hit; Love Story Strikes
Out
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>Among the many trailers that I've seen over the past few weeks, the one
that had generated the most interest for me was Kevin Costner's latest
release.  The preview is a wonderful, stately presentation of an aging
baseball star that is approaching the most important crossroads of his
life.  It hints that this will be an uplifting, glorious story.  But
like so many other great-looking previews, the film itself fails to
deliver what it promises.  In this case, what bogs this film down like
an overweight player is a distracting love story that sends it into
foul territory.</P>
<P>Billy Chapel (Costner) has had a long and storied career.  He has
pitched with the Detroit Tigers since he first entered the majors more
than 15 years ago.  In that time, he has garnered every major award
there is in baseball.  But now at 40 years of age, his dream may be
coming to an end.  He struggles with some very difficult decisions,
including possibly retiring and deciding what to do about his long
relationship with girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston).  Chapel has always
been a fighter, and his will and independence has made him a better
baseball player than boyfriend.  Jane laments, "you can win or lose all
by yourself.  You don't need me."  Her relationship with Chapel has
been more than frustrating at times.</P>
<P>Chapel is scheduled to pitch the last game of the season against the
powerhouse New York Yankees.  He has quite a lot to think about.  He
struggles to keep his mind focused during this important game.  I found
it interesting how the filmmakers illustrated the mindset of the
pitcher. As he readies his delivery in front of 50,000 screaming fans,
Chapel mentally squelches out all sound from his mind.  Meanwhile, he
visually blurs out everything except his ultimate target, the catcher's
mitt that awaits the pitch.  Chapel shows us that pitching is more than
just throwing hard.  It's about placement and about psyching out the
batter.  The baseball sequences are well thought out and would even be
enjoyable to those who don't know a thing about the sport.  The drama
is heightened effectively by the poetic play-by-play passages spoken by
veteran announcer Vin Scully.  </P>
<P>In between innings, he recounts the last five years of his life since
first meeting Jane.  We see his first encounter on the side of the
highway as he tries to help her with her broken down car.  We see her
upset over the fact that she can only see him when he comes into town
to play the Yankees.  And we see their relationship develop into a
one-sided affair.  Jane is very levelheaded and grudgingly accepts her
second place status to Billy's love with baseball.  But second place
isn't good enough.  </P>
<P>I am marginally recommending this film on the strength of the baseball
story and Costner's affable insouciance.  However, too much time is
wasted on his relationship with Jane.  Costner has great appeal, and I
can see how some kind of love angle must be a part of his films.  But,
the love story seems to happen completely outside the framework of the
film.  Jane has very little to do with his internal conflict nor does
it really impact the path that he ultimately chooses.  This is not
Kelly Preston's fault, who tries to add life to a flatly written
character.  The heart and soul of the story should have revolved around
Chapel's loyalty to his team, his uncertain future, and his passion for
the one thing that has made the last 15 years of his life a
dream-come-true.  Is this movie called "For Love of the Game" or "For
Love of the JANE"?  As with Costner's other baseball-themed films (Bull
Durham, Field of Dreams), "For Love of the Game" ably manages to evoke
the majesty and spirit of America's past time as magically as the '86
Mets.  The love story, however, fizzles.</P>
