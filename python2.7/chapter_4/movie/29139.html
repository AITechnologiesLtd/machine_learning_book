<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A below-average "Bonnie and Clyde" tale, about lovers on-the-run after a murder
in Paris. A young couple is pursued for a murder they never did. This B-film,
directed by Samuel Fuller, is one that failed to work. The setup seemed so
wooden, while the bourgeois villains seemed more like cartoon figures than real
people. Even the hero and the heroine failed to be convincing and looked more
like imitations picked off the reels of other such B-films. </P>
<P>François (Di Cicco) is an unemployed violinist. Isabelle (Jannot) is looking for
work as an art historian. They are both at the unemployment agency-ANPE-and feel
humiliated looking for work and not being offered jobs they feel are
respectable. He's offered a job as a dishwasher by Mr. Crepin (Chabrol), someone
he mocks by calling him Tartuffe. Isabelle sees Ms. Morelle (Salik), one she
calls Mussolini, and is offered a job in a porno theater. The counselors have no
regard for their unemployed clients and treat them like dirt. Tartuffe hits on
his female applicants, while Mussolini combs her mustache instead of listening
to her applicants. </P>
<P>Isabelle can't take it anymore and throws a chair through Mussolini's window, as
the gentle François rescues her from being caught in the ensuing chaos. They
flee together, have some coffee, and become lovers. Not able to get jobs or make
it as street musicians, they decide to become thieves. They will rob the three
counselors they despise  -- Mussolini, Mr. Desterne, and Tartuffe -- and
humiliate them in the same way they have been by them. </P>
<P>When they rob Tartuffe, he accidentally falls off the ledge of a building while
being a voyeur. But Isabelle thinks she killed him by fright. The cops are also
after them, led by Inspector Farbet (Lanoux). Their mentor, Jose (Voutsinas), an
ex-con now running a junk shop and reconstructing old musical instruments, helps
them get a fence (Fuller) for their stolen goods. He will later help the lovers
escape the police. </P>
<P>Warning: spoiler to follow in next paragraph. </P>
<P>The lovers flee to the border, get recognized, and Isabelle is unnecessarily
killed by a custom police officer. François responds by killing two officers,
and is arrested after giving a violin concert. The police now know the couple
was innocent of murder, as a witness came forward verifying the death as
accidental. </P>
<P>This one should only be appreciated by Sam Fuller fans. </P>
