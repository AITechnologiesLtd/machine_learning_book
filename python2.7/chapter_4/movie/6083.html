<PRE>                                ED'S NEXT MOVE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     This year's low-budget success story and darling of the festival
circuit, ED'S NEXT MOVE is one of a handful of recent pictures that is
truly deserving of its praise.</P>
<P>     The Manhattan-based indie traces a few weeks in the life of urban
greenhorn Eddie (Matt Ross), whose titular move is from the wide-open,
cheesy state of Wisconsin to the dog-eat-dog world of New York City. 
Eddie, a genetics researcher and rice breeder, faces the world alone --
a stranger in a strange land.  He lives in a cheap motel while he tries
to find a non-psychotic roommate, can't get a simple hamburger at a
restaurant, and finds his Midwestern sensibilities out of place in the
big city.</P>
<P>     It's here that Eddie meets Lee (Callie Thorne), a brassy hipster
trying to cut it as a musician.  Eddie, in fine romantic comedy style,
becomes smitten with Lee and tries to win her affections.</P>
<P>     The result is a fine comedy from newcomer John Walsh, who directs
his own script.  In fact, just about everyone associated with the film
is a newcomer, which works to the benefit of the picture by keeping
everything fresh.  Ross and Thorne are excellent actors, and because
we've never seen them before, it's easy to suspend disbelief enough to
buy them in their parts.  (Also good is Kevin Carroll as Eddie's
antithesis and roommate Ray.)</P>
<P>     With funny and fresh dialogue, a heap of production values
considering the low budget, and a wide-appeal story that neither
condescends to the audience nor enters the saccharine world of
big-budget romantic comedies, ED'S NEXT MOVE is a winner for just about
anyone's taste.  (This critic laughed his proverbial butt off, that's
for sure.)  Be sure to watch for "the mice scene" -- the only comparable
fall-down laughing sequence equivalent to last year's "banana scene"
from THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN.</P>
<P>     ED'S NEXT MOVE remains one of the better offerings of the year, by
giving us a romantic comedy about people who could feasibly be friends
of ours -- or could even be ourselves.  My only hope is that Walsh can
keep it up with his next picture.</P>
<PRE>     Watch for an interview with writer/director John Walsh, coming
soon!</PRE>
