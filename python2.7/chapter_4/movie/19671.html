<PRE>
 The Deep Blue Sea (1999) 1 star out of 4. Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
Directed by Renny Harlin.</PRE>
<P> I have a confession: Deep down in my darkest soul, I'm a sadist. I enjoy
watching people get killed in gruesome ways in movies. It sort of helps to
let out all the pent-up aggression.</P>
<P> Therefore, for those of you who think along the same lines, "The Deep Blue
Sea" is your kind of movie.</P>
<P> Nothing is as satisfying as seeing human beings transformed by sharks into
sushi.</P>
<P> Too bad, though, that, there's so little of human vs. shark interaction in
the movie. At one hour and 45 minutes, about 90 minutes is filled with
humans interacting with other humans. And that is too bad.</P>
<P> For when the sharks are away, the people are bores. Actually, they are not
even people - merely types: the dedicated scientist who, by breaking
protocols in the name of humanity and research, creates smart sharks that
can outthink the humans; the outsider, loner adventurer who is the only
reach match for the sharks; the black cook who has rediscovered religion;
and the industrialist who only cares about his publicity and the bottom
line.</P>
<P> You really don't give a hoot about any of these people. They are merely
shark bait. And you merely sit and watch, waiting for the next person to be
bit in half by the trio of man-eating denizens at a high-tech research
facility in the middle of the ocean.</P>
<P> Even the computer-generated effects are second rate. When the sharks speed
up or take a nibble on one of the performers, the screen becomes a bit
blurry and the action looks like something off a computer game.</P>
<P> All in all, "The Deep Blue Sea," directed by Renny Harlin, is a grade-C
movie that should be running at the drive-in on a double bill with "Lake
Placid."</P>
<P> Between killer sharks and killer 'gators, it is not nice to mess with
Mother Nature this summer.</P>
<P> Nope, "The Deep Blue Sea" is a big watery bore. You can find more fun and
excitement at a water park than on the screen.</P>
