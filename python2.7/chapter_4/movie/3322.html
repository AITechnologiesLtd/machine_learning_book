<PRE>                                    TO LIVE
                       A film review by David Wong Shee
                        Copyright 1995 David Wong Shee</PRE>
<P>     Zhang Yi-Mou's (RED SORGHUM, RAISE THE RED LANTERN, JU DOU) most
recent film is TO LIVE again featuring Gong Li in a principal role.
The film follows the fortunes, and misfortunes, of family that lives
through the communist revolution of 1949 and the later cultural
revolution.  The depiction of both the family melodrama and of the
tumultuous historical backdrop against which it is set, combine to make
this a film of considerable value.</P>
<P>     "Political correctness" is also a theme of sorts.  The characters
constantly struggle to keep in step with the shifting ideological
requirements of those in power, often under threat of imprisonment or
execution.  Ironically while the characters in TO LIVE succeed in this
Zhang Yi-Mou has not.  As I understand it he has been barred from any
further international collaborations for the next five years because
the treatment of the Chinese Communist Party in this film.  This is in
spite of fact that communist party officials in the film are portrayed
as genuinely sympathetic and well meaning individuals.</P>
<P>     The film implies that to those who lived through China's recent
history it is obvious that many people suffered as a result of
imperfections and inconsistencies in Party policy.  This suffering,
even though it may have been inflicted inadvertently, still demands of
that those who experienced it a need to come to terms with it.  TO LIVE
can be seen to be as an attempt to do this.</P>
<P>     The Party however is obviously still sensitive criticism of this
sort and so have put Zhang Yi-Mou in a five-year "time capsule."  The
positive side is perhaps that they did not punish him more overtly and
did not actively suppress the film from international circulation.</P>
