<PRE>Pleasantville (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>There is no town called "Pleasantville" in my state.  But as my son and 
I left the theater, we saw a scene that could have been Main Street in 
the film Pleasantville.  The uptown area of a midwestern town: banks and 
small businesses, a gas station and United Dairy Farmers on the corner.  
Red bricks pave the street.</P>
<P>Gary Ross's version of Pleasantville has to be taken as a fable.  There 
are too many unexplained motives and twists.  Why would a TV repairman 
(Don Knotts) show up at a house just seconds after the remote is broken?  
Why would he send the children of the house into the black-and-white 
world of a 1958 sitcom?  How do the two survive there without access to 
bathrooms?</P>
<P>Once you have suspended your disbelief, however, Pleasantville is a 
pleasant diversion, one that is filled with delightful effects that 
generate fascinating ideas.</P>
<P>Tobey Maguire plays David, the slightly younger brother of Jennifer 
(Reese Witherspooon).  Quickly we see even David's sister perceives him 
as a dork;  one of her friends comments, "You must have come from, like, 
the cool side of the uterus."  It is when David and Jennifer have a tug 
o' war over a new and mysterious remote that they are thrust back into 
the pasty world of sexless situation comedy, the domain of Ozzie Nelson 
and Donna Reed and Robert Young (though here the teens get more of a 
taste of Rod Serling).  When the repairman refuses to speak with them, 
Bud and Mary Sue - the names of the TV characters they have replaced - 
are forced to inhabit the odd world whose "plots" David has memorized.</P>
<P>I was concerned that Pleasantville would jump on the bandwagon of 
cop-outs that dismisses large parts of the past as inferior and 
incorrect.  But the film is out neither to put down the past nor to 
pique our nostalgia.  What works best is the film's ideas.  First, it's 
one of the best arguments against censorship that has been added to our 
literature in some time.  A book burning scene is not as eerie, perhaps, 
as one in Fahrenheit 451, though its implications are just as chilling.  
More importantly, the film acts as the quintessential advertisement for 
the arts, going so far as to suggest they are indispensable to our 
humanity.  As a teacher, I only hope that younger viewers notice that 
good things happen to the residents when they read or paint.  The 
metaphorical black-and-white pallor vanishes in the person who goes 
after the "color" in life.</P>
<P>In Big and Dave, Gary Ross pursued unlikely storylines.  Here he expands 
upon his themes of magical accidents happening to everyday people.  And 
the tricks Ross employs are wonderful, the tale making use of technology 
not for explosions but for bizarre split-screens of color and meaning.  
A red rose is the first hue seen by Skip (Paul Walker), captain of the 
high school basketball team who has just been deflowered by Mary Sue 
Parker.  Her brother Bud connects the outbreaks of color to her 
transplanted 90's sensibilities.  Herein lies one of the film's 
weaknesses, when Bud constantly nags Mary Sue not to impose her 
behaviors on the innocent past.  It's as if we are watching a Bradbury 
story and the time travelers are threatened with the prospect of 
throwing off the entire future through a misplaced and miniscule action.  
It's Bud, too, who later tells his television dad, George Parker 
(William H. Macy), that change is inevitable and good, that it's harder 
to go back to the way you were before.</P>
<P>Ross is very clever when he re-enacts the fall of Adam and Eve, with a 
girl plucking a red apple from a black-and-white tree and tempting Bud.  
This is not heavy-handed symbolism; it's tongue-in-cheek mind-play, 
suggesting that life is happier when it is not sterile and perfect:  
it's best when there is silliness and sexiness and even danger.  
Timeless and entertaining ideas, these, the stuff of good literature.  </P>
<P>In one of the most charming subplots, Betty Parker finds her color by 
debunking the myths of dutiful wife and mother.  Looking like Pat Nixon 
again, Joan Allen is perfect in the role.  We chuckle when we see she 
must learn about sex from her daughter, who is now a regular at lover's 
lane.  And when Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels) rubs off the make-up she is 
using to cover her flesh tones, Betty realizes the potential of her own 
long-denied emotions.  Daniels also excels as Mr. Johnson, owner of the 
soda shop where Bud works.  Good at looking baffled at Bud's 
explanations, Daniels conveys the slow but complete change his character 
accomplishes.  Viewers will be fond of remembering a scene in which Bud 
brings Mr. Johnson a large art book from the library.  Johnson likes to 
paint Christmas scenes on the inside of his shop window, and here his 
epiphany is clear when he glimpses for the first time the Titians and 
Van Goghs, the sweet strains of Randy Newman's Pleasantville Suite 
rising in the background. </P>
<P>Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon portray the most interesting 
relationship in the film.  As brother and sister, they bicker and ignore 
and defy, but just like the characters in the world they occupy, they 
end happily.  Witherspoon brings to her role a calculated agenda that 
only seems whimsical.  She puts on just the right wiles.  On the other 
hand, Maguire seems almost entirely innocent.  At times puzzled or 
frustrated, Maguire is best at the earnest straight-talking that serves 
as the film's most heavy-handed message, in a speech delivered to his 
real mother.  It's here that the script stumbles -- not Maguire's 
acting.  Both actors are beyond the teenage years they depict, but so 
probably are the rest of the supporting soda shop gang.</P>
<P>In his last role, J. T. Walsh is superb as "Big Bob," the mayor and 
head-honcho of the chamber of commerce and bowling league.  Walsh adds 
good comic timing to the dry edge given to his character, reminiscent of 
Dub Taylor or Martin Balsam, character actors capable of getting laughs 
out of dead-serious dialogue.  His short hair combed straight up in what 
the venerable barber in our town calls a "Princeton," Walsh wheedles and 
pontificates nicely.  The script fails him too, though, when his 
character charges off screen at the end of an otherwise powerful 
"trial."</P>
<P>I know why the producers chose the Beatles' song for the soundtrack, but 
why did they get Fiona Apple to sing it in a sleepy and sluggish voice?  
The other parts of the soundtrack are charming, Newman's generic but 
still moving compositions mixed with vintage pieces, snippets of which 
we hear at crucial spots in the story.</P>
<P>Leaving the theater, the film's ideas strong and immediate in my head, I 
remembered a Saturday afternoon eight years ago.  I had taken my son to 
see the first Ninja Turtles, and when we stepped out onto High Street, 
we saw a crowded and boisterous uptown.  I had forgotten about the Klan 
rally.  These happened in other towns, not ours.  As we stood before the 
old marquee of the Princess Theater, I thought quickly how I could get 
my 5 year-old to the car with safety and a minimal explanation.</P>
<P>It occurred to me that perhaps the most worthy part of Pleasantville is 
its attempt to engage profound ideas.  Sure, a lot is left unexplained, 
but we are also asked to think about the nature of hate and prejudice, 
the unpleasant colors in the human spectrum.</P>
