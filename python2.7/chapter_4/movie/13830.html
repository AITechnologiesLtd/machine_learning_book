<P>Creating a Place in the Present via the Past</P>
<PRE>Review of Out of the Past</PRE>
<P>Seen on 6 August 1998 for $8.50 with Byron at The Screening Room as part
of a double feature with *Dottie Gets Spanked*.</P>
<P>"To create a place in the present, there must be a place in the past." 
It's one of the ways we provide an edification for our own existence. For
centuries, the gay past remained hidden for gay men and lesbians. While
this is no longer the case, *Out of the Past* fulfills it's title by
bringing noteworthy and even prominent figures from the gay past out into
public consumption, giving them their long overdue recognition. </P>
<P>Six figures are portrayed. Michael Wigglesworth, the repressed 17th
Century Puritan minister; the "Boston Marriage" of turn-of-the-Century
writers Sarah Orne Jewett and Annie Adams Fields; 1920s activist Henry
Gerber, Founder of the doomed Society for Human Rights; Bayard Rustin, the
gay black civil rights activist who got lost in the shuffle of history
while Martin Luther King became the prominent activist at his expense; and
Barbara Gittings, an early homophile leader who began her work in the
1950s and is the sole subject still living today. </P>
<P>The stories that unfold are fascinating, and largely unknown even to gay
people. They are astounding; the bravery shown by Gerber and Rustin, the
open love of the "Boston marriage"; the nonviolent persistence of Barbara
Gittings from the 1960s through today.  To even try to tell them here
would do them no justice, so try to see it yourself. There's a lot to be
learned her for all audiences.</P>
<P>Contrasted to the stories of the historical figures is the tale of one
girl's quest for social justice in Utah; Kelli Peterson formed the
Gay-Straight Alliance at East High School in Utah. The school tried to
close down the club, and when told it was illegal to discriminate in this
manner, the school board surreptitiously voted to outlaw *all*
extracurricular clubs. All of them. This led to massive protests by *all*
students, and in the end the Gay-Straight Alliance retained their rights
to meet.</P>
<P>The 97-minute documentary is augmented by archival photos and film reels
(including the Stonewall Riots aftermath), and it won the Audience Award
and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.
Linda Hunt is the narrator and voices for the historical characters were
as follows: Stephhen Spinella as Michael Wigglesworth; Gwyneth Paltrow as
Sarah Orne Jewett; Cherry Jones as Annie Adams Fields; Edward Norton (II)
as Henry Gerber; Leland Gantt as Bayard Rustin. </P>
<P>Sad Footnote: One of the Utah youths shown with Kelli Peterson was Jacob
Lawrence Orosco, who killed himself by hanging shortly after the film was
complete, on 3 September 1997 Utah. See

<P>for obituaries and commentary. That kids are still driven to suicide in
this day and age because of their distress over sexual orientation is both
astounding and frightening. </P>
