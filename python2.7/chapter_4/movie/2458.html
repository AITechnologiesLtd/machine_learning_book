<PRE>                                    THE CHASE
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros

<PRE>"Rule number one is no burning the guy with the gun."
                        - Charlie Sheen acting "tough" to
                          Kristie Swanson</PRE>
<P>     Ah, the Seventies.  The era of truck chases (CONVOY), car races
(THE GUMBALL RALLY), and even truck/car chases (SMOKEY AND THE
BANDIT).  Remember those fast, funny, throwaway movies?  They were
perfect popcorn entertainment in a way-too-serious time.  But after
John Landis filmed the definitive everything-but-the-kitchen-sink
car-chase in THE BLUES BROTHERS, the genre died a quiet death.
Stuntman cum director Hal Needham filmed THE CANNONBALL RUN II in 1984
and that was that.</P>
<P>     Now, ten years too late, comes THE CHASE.  This roadkill of a
picture is truly awful entertainment--especially in comparison of what
came before.  In their heyday, even the *worst* chase films had a few
things going for them.  Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise were usually
close.  And, sometimes, so were Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.  There
were some buxom babes, some decent stunts, and a ton of bad jokes.</P>
<P>     THE CHASE *also* has a ton of bad jokes.  But instead of Burt
Reynolds and his hairpiece, there's Charlie Sheen and his
what-I-am-I-doing-here stare.  He's a man on the lam, wrongly convicted
for a robbery he didn't do.  He's kidnapped a daddy's rich daughter
(Swanson) and her red BMW.</P>
<PRE>     Exhibit A: a babe and a fast car.</PRE>
<P>     Hot on his heels are the cops as comic relief.  But don't look for
ol' Pink Eyes here.  Pop stars have given way to rock stars and Dean
Martin has been replaced by Henry Rollins.  Who sucks.  For added
"enjoyment," a couple Red Hot Chili Peppers wander through as a pair of
"Beavis and Butthead" types trying to capture Charlie.</P>
<PRE>     Heh heh heh.</PRE>
<P>     Writer/director Adam Rifkin doesn't have a clue on how to stage a
car chase.  His MTV-style quick-cuts make the action virtually
impossible to follow.  But does the director compensate with anything
even *resembling* snappy dialogue?</P>
<PRE>     Not.</PRE>
<PRE>     Sample wit: Swanson gets car-sick and heaves a load onto a police
                 car windshield.  A character then observes: "That is a
                 lot of puke."</PRE>
<P>     With no decent dialogue *or* action to speak of, the film's saving
grace are a few good slams on media mentality.  Every so often, Rifkin
cuts to a tabloid-news program promoting something along the lines of
"Kidnapped at 100 MPH."  These are good bits that are boosted by a nifty
cameo that I won't reveal here.</P>
<PRE>     (The secret is: he's a man.)</PRE>
<P>     Most of this race is a drag.  Ray Wise and Claudia Christian are
scene-killers as the pompous parents.  Plot-holes are the size of
pot-holes, from exploding helicopters to disappearing vomit.  Or, my
favorite, a day that turns to night in under eight minutes.</P>
<P>     There's even a thrash-metal soundtrack to help accentuate the
negative.</P>
<P>     THE CHASE may be *someone's* idea of hip wit.  But it bears little
resemblance to those great chases of not-so-long-ago when a road film
was not highway robbery.</P>
<PRE>NOTE:   Believe it or not, there's one gag in THE CHASE that redeems
        the entire experience.  And it's not even in the film!  Stay
        through the closing credits and see a joke that, for my money,
        is the funniest I've seen this season.  Go figure.</PRE>
<PRE>Bottom line: THE CHASE is an awful action-comedy from writer-director
             Alan Rifkin.  Charlie Sheen and Kristy Swanson make a cute
             couple, but there's not a stitch of decent dialogue or
             admirable action to support them.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: D+</PRE>
