<P>In Damien O'Donnell's "East is East", a screen version of Ayub Khan-Din's
stage play, Linda Bassett plays the white English wife of a Pakistani
immigrant (Om Puri) to 1970's Salford. Written by an Asian, it is
essentially a situation comedy dealing with the cultural "no-man's-land" in
which the children of immigrants find themselves, and the strains inside the
family produced when the younger generation begins to feel the pull of the
host culture.</P>
<P>The plot is perfunctory, and I won't take up your time with it here. I was
enticed to see it by a number of inexplicably positive reviews in the London
press. I thought it was cheap, offensive, unimaginative and peopled entirely
by racial and class stereotypes of the most crass kind. It portrays a Muslim
father who is totally indifferent to the happiness or wellbeing of his
children, fanatically devoted to the ritual and trivial aspects of his
religion, spouting obscenities at all around him, taking out his frustration
in violence on both his wife and his children when he is unable to get his
own way, physically ugly and unpleasant in his personal habits.... the list
seems endless. The realism and brutality of the father's violence sits
particularly uneasily in something that does not even aspire to
tragi-comedy. There is hardly a racial stereotype that this cardboard
cut-out central figure does not embody. His family too seem like ciphers
introduced to embody clichés of  "the younger generation" stuck between two
cultures: we have the gay brother, the religious brother, the terrified
younger brother (whom Puri has no hesitation in subjecting to a late
circumcision in order to keep up appearances when he finds that it was
overlooked at the correct time), the rebellious daughter. Only the white
English second wife seems  noble and long-suffering, and even capable of
some degree of common affection. The other Asian family that we meet is
similarly monstrous, the father bullying and overbearing, the wife cold and
critical and obsessively ambitious for her offspring, the two daughters ugly
and seemingly mindless.</P>
<P>The comic elements are hackneyed and heavy-handed, descending to slapstick
more than once, as when a "sculpture" looking like a section cut out of an
inflatable rubber "adult doll" is thrown on to the lap of the surly visiting
mother, or when the children try to hide the bacon and sausages they have
been eating when they hear their father's approach. This stuff is sub-Alf
Garnett ( a British TV sitcom working-class Fascist and racist bigot par
excellence, for those of you who don't watch British TV). In fact a real Alf
(and I know he is not a rarity) would be delighted with the whole ethos of
this film. It could be hired for British Movement coffee evenings. There is
not a shred of understanding of or respect for the Islamic way of life in
this film. What it seems to say is "Everything you've ever heard about the
Pakkies (or whatever derisory word you want to insert) is true". Presumably
it is supposed to be excused by the fact that it was written by an Asian.
This argument doesn't cut very much ice with me. I am not saying that a
writer or a director has any kind of duty to present "PC" depictions of a
particular race or group, but merely to pick up on a dominant racist
carricature and reinforce it uncritically like this seems to me inexcusable,
and frankly lazy. I think it betrays the same degree of internalised racism
as the outcry of one of the brothers in the film: "I don't want to marry a
Pakkie!".</P>
<P>Compare (if this isn't too much of a stretch of the imagination) Puri's
brutal patriarch in "East is East" with Topol's character in "Fiddler on the
Roof". Like Puri, he was a man brought up in traditional religious and
social values to which his children would not adhere, but his reaction was
sadness and apprehension for their future happiness, as he wrestled to
understand the new and unfamiliar world that they were growing up into. But
far more importantly, in Topol's case, we could see the value of the
traditions that he clung to, how they had served the Jewish people and how
they could produce happy and loving families and a context in which a good
life could be lived. Traditional Judaism was treated with respect. That
film/play was three dimensional, its ideas could be looked-at from different
angles. Yet it was only a comedy as well - a musical comedy at that. What a
pity "East is East" couldn't have had a touch more of the big-heartedness of
"Fiddler". What a lost opportunity!</P>
