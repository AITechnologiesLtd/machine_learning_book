<PRE>THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST (1988)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Martin Scorsese
Writer: Paul Schrader (based on the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis)
Starring: Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Barbara Hershey, Verna Bloom,
Harry Dean Stanton, David Bowie, Andre Gregory, Juliette Caton, Victor
Argo, Irvin Kershner, John Lurie, Barry Miller</P>
<P>What happened if Jesus Christ was given a choice in whether or not he
was crucified and died "for our sins?"  What if Jesus wasn't as perfect
as he is said to be, and was instead a human being, almost cursed with
the thought that he was the Messiah, the son of God?  Director Martin
Scorsese's epic motion picture, which retells the traditional story of
Jesus in a whole other manner ponders these questions, and does it in a
way that presents a kind of film that is extrememly rare: a
philospophical motion picture.</P>
<P>Based on the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, the story tells the latter part
of Jesus's life (played by Willem Dafoe, who, well, looks like
Jesus...or the general perception of him), with most of the pretty
important parts (like the Sermon on the Mount, the whole fasting in the
desert with the temptations of Satan, the Last Supper, etc.) being told,
but in a way that shows that Jesus was a human being.  I've never read
the bible personally, but when you're forced to go to church for the
first 18 years of your life, you do hear a lot of stories from the
bible, and one of the big myths is that Jesus was a flawless man.  This
film breaks him down to be a man.</P>
<P>Of course, why wouldn't he be a regular man with a tremendous burden on
his shoulders?  Although being born to a virgin woman (played by Verna
Bloom, who was also Dean Wormer's wife in "Animal House"), he still grew
up a man.  It seems that him being perfect was just a myth in the bible,
a way that the different men who wrote it bent the truth a bit to touch
people (which is touched upon later in the film).  The way that Schrader
(who wrote the script), Scorsese (who directed the film), and Dafoe (who
played Jesus) present it is that he's a man who's almost cursed to die
for everyone's sins, and is saddled with the birthright of being this
perfect human being, when he confesses to a couple confidences that he
can't help but want to have sex with attractive women when he sees them,
just like the rest of us...well, sorta.</P>
<P>The film poses the question "What would happen if Jesus was able to live
like the average human being?"  Luckily, it doesn't arrive at this
question until the two-hour mark.  Before this time, the film shows his
life prior to the crucifixtion where he is told he's allowed to come off
the cross and be a regular schmo by a young female angel (Juliette
Caton).  Why is it lucky they did this?  Because the film would seem
gimicky if they had just jumped to it without backing itself up.</P>
<P>For the first two hours, the film tells his early story, from when he's
making crosses for the romans, to when he's being followed around by
Judas (Harvey Keitel) and eleven other apostles, to his inevitable
crucifixtion.  Not being of great knowledge as to his mid-life (the most
details I know about are his birth and death, since the Christmas and
Easter seasons are so close together on the church calendar), I don't
know how much is true, but this is a work of fiction, since everything
has a new twist to it.</P>
<P>For example, he is constantly confessing his fear of living the way he
does, and shows constant apprehension to die for everyone else, which
brings on the anger of Judas, who calls him a coward throughout the
film.  He also has to suffer the cruelties of others thinking of him as
a madman, as he does sound like one a lot of the time.  And, of course,
he suffers scrutiny for taking into his little clique the prostitute,
Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey, saddled with a near impossible role of
being the woman who is the object of Jesus's affection), since he's
supposed to be this big sign of purity.</P>
<P>The final forty-five minutes of the film chronicle his life after being
let down of the cross, where he marries another woman named Mary
(hinting at an oedipal complex with his mother, also named Mary...or
maybe not...), and settles down to a simple and happy life, with lots of
children.  There is a powerful ironic ending which thankfully stays in
tact with the rest of the film.  Also, instead of being just a cheap
ironic twist, it spurns out a deeper philosophical idea, which makes
this a brilliant work of biblical satire.</P>
<P>The way the film is constructed is interesting, as it seems to bring out
a fascination Scorsese has with his best works: concentrating on a
person or persons who are trapped by a lifestyle or something deeper. 
In "Goodfellas" and "Casino," the mafiosos were trapped by the lifestyle
they had chosen; and in "Raging Bull," Jake LaMotta was trapped in the
world of boxing, the boxing ring being a metaphor for his life.  Jesus
is similarly trapped, but by the fact that God chose him to be his son. 
It's a tragedy of a movie, as Jesus discovers that his place was never
to be a man like everyone else, but to be the ultimate martyr - to stop
death, and save everyone's soul.</P>
<P>The direction is very bizarre, and creates a film that is extremely
surreal.  The opening is dizzying, probably to get the sense of the
confusion Jesus is suffering at the particular point in his life.  And
there's lots of scenes of nudity, blood, and assorted gore, including a
freaky deaky scene where Jesus approaches his desciples after fasting in
the desert, and he pulls out his heart and holds it in front of them. 
The surrealism helps the film, though, and also creates a hypnotic feel
to it, which holds the audience's attention the full way through.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, as brilliant and philosophical as it is, the film is one
of the most controversial pieces of art of all time.  Like Monty
Python's "Life of Brian" (which was a comedy that dealt with a man
mistaken for Christ, but not once picking on Christ himself), the film
spurned a lot of picketing, featuring people who had mostly not even
seen the movie.  It's a shame that people are so narrow-minded and don't
take a chance of expanding their thinking to something higher and more
profound.  Sure, there's a scene where Jesus does have sex with Mary
Magdalene.  But it's not pornographic, and never flashy - it's just
poignant.  People need to realize that just because a piece of art
expounds on the "holy scriptures," it doesn't necessarily mean it's
"blasphemy."  The passages in the bible were meant to be thought about
in such a manner.  At least that's my opinion; I could be wrong.</P>
<P>The acting is not amazing, but does feature a wonderful performance from
Willem Dafoe, who creates a sympathetic and pithy Jesus.  This man is no
Brian Deacon - he shows Jesus in a completely different way, and he
pulls it off amazingly.  Harvey Keitel is a great Judas (sorry, folks,
there is no hanging scene), and there are two great cameos from
character actor Harry Dean Stanton as Saul/Paul (see the movie to
understand this), and David Bowie as none other than Pontious Pilate (he
rocks in his one scene).</P>
<P>Scorsese received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his directing,
which is luckily never heavy-handed or preachy.  Every scene is a
mini-masterpiece (save a corny scene where Jesus raises Lazarus from the
dead), as he paints each scene with the appropriate feel.  He shows he
is once again one of the best directors, if not the best, working today.</P>
<P>"The Last Temptation of Christ" is one of those hard-to-find films which
is overly-bashed for moronic reasons.  I'm not even a Christian
(agnostic, if you must know), but I found the film to be a poignant, and
brilliant way to look at the gospels of Jesus.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
