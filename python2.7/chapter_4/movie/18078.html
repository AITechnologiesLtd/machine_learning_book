<P>Roger Ebert describes Entrapment as a "star vehicle," and he enjoyed it
on those terms.  I'm not letting it off that easily.  Here is a film
that not only ignores logic, characterization, and coherence, but spits
in the face of every known rule of physics.  It's also such a
superficial movie that the most notable element of the last scene is
that the characters' costumes are perfectly matched with the sets. 
Style over substance?  Definitely.  Should we care?  I sure did.  It's
not a loathsome film; on the contrary, it stars two people who are easy
on the eyes and light up the screen.  In fact, there are only two
reasons to see Entrapment:  1) the presence of Sean Connery and
Catherine Zeta-Jones, and 2) director Jon Amiel, who does what he can
with a script overdosed on cliches.</P>
<P>Even these three talents can't make sense of this inane screenplay,
which is credited to Ronald Bass and William Broyles; it's one of those
scripts that's far more interested in shocking us with ludicrous plot
twists than it is in actually telling a story about thieves.  The
framework for the film is pretty simple:  Gin Baker (Zeta-Jones) works
for an insurance company; she's assigned by her boss (Will Patton) to
make a deal with and ultimately betray Robert MacDugal (Connery), a
rich, big-time thief.  The usual assortment of plot devices can be
expected, including several double-crosses, a sordid love affair, a
sidekick subplot (starring Ving Rhames), and a lot of characters staring
pensively at the action-packed sight of a surveillance camera.</P>
<P>Entrapment fires cliches at its audience with mechanical rapidity; it's
likely that anyone keeping track will lose count well before the film is
over.  For instance, if Mac is such a sly, brilliant thief, why is it
that Gin is able to instantly pull up a file containing every crime he's
committed since his foray into the world of robbery?  Well, that's
probably because the screenplay wouldn't work very well if Gin doesn't
know what Mac looks like.  Another cliche is the Vanishing Character
Act.  The last scene (the one I mentioned above) has about four
Vanishing Character Acts, where characters vanish into thin air and then
appear seconds later in places they could not possibly have gotten in
such a short amount of time.  My personal favorite is the obligatory sex
with Sean Connery cliche.  Entrapment doesn't actually feature a heated
sex scene, but it's implied.  </P>
<P>Jon Amiel (Copycat) is a skilled director, and the heist scene in which
Gin and Mac steal the Chinese mask is sharply crafted, especially after
seeing the way they train for it.  Connery and Zeta-Jones don't do much
acting, but they have presence, so much that I was almost interested in
the love affair angle.  The supporting cast is nice, though Patton and
Rhames are both shamelessly wasted.  Entrapment is a pretty lousy movie
when all is considered, but it has its pluses.  It just would have been
nice if someone -- anyone -- had at least made an effort to tone down
the cliches and make sense of the story.  Stars can carry a movie only
so far before a little bit of coherence in the plot is necessary.</P>
