A Movie Review by David Sunga </PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Tony Scott</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: David Marconi</PRE>
<P>Starring: Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Lisa Bonet </P>
<P>Ingredients: National Security Agency, innocent guy, video tape that
everyone wants </P>
<P>Synopsis: 
In this thriller, Robert Dean (Will Smith) is an upscale lawyer and
family man who possesses a video tape containing incriminating film
footage of a mobster. The mobster threatens Dean with trouble if Dean
doesn't hand over the tape. When a desperate acquaintance bumps into
Dean, Dean unknowingly falls into accidental possession of a second,
unrelated tape wanted by an even more shadowy figure: a sinister
politician in charge of the NSA, a secretive American spy agency. In no
time, Dean finds himself on the run, chased by corrupt G-men, with his
posh former life turned completely upside down. Can Dean and his techno
ally Brill (Gene Hackman) finally figure out what's going on?</P>
<P>Opinion: 
Is there really an American intelligence organization called the
National Security Agency in charge of satellite imagery and electronic
surveillance? Actually yes. With offices worldwide, and an estimated 3
billion dollar budget, the NSA is one of the largest employers in the
state of Maryland and may be the world's primary employer of
mathematicians (read "computer codemakers and codebreakers"). The NSA
and the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) together control most of the
satellite and telecommunications defense reconnaissance taking place
anywhere in the world. </P>
<P>ENEMY OF THE STATE asks an intriguing question: "What if the powerful
NSA targeted an ordinary civilian instead of terrorists?" Interesting
proposition, and it's what makes the movie so fun. Dean's life is
totally invaded by bugs, cameras, networked videocam, and satellite
intelligence. His credit records and bank records are tampered with. His
phones and those of his friends, family, and acquaintances are tapped.
Insidiously, the NSA even plants tracking devices on Dean's clothing and
shoes. ENEMY OF THE STATE excels at portraying this devilishly clever
surveillance. And thanks to TOP GUN director Tony Scott there is plenty
of fast paced action as well: running around, car chases, helicopters,
explosions, et cetera. The only really predictable part is the fate of
Dean's girlfriend Rachel (Lisa Bonet). ENEMY OF THE STATE is a decent
thriller with an interesting proposition and a catchy ending.  </P>
