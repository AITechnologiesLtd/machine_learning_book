                                [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1991 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<PRE>140 min, R, Action, 1991
Director: James Cameron
Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick,
      Edward Furlong</PRE>
<PRE>     WARNING - spoilers for THE TERMINATOR</PRE>
<P>     In THE TERMINATOR there is a very bleak version of the future.  The
nuclear war has already happened (in the year 1997), and some survived.
Those who have survived face even a tougher battle.  Machines now have
artificial intelligence and can run themselves.  They see the errors in
the ways of humans, so have set out to cease their existence.  The
humans, though, have a leader, a man named John.  The machines, afraid
that John will lead the humans to victory, had sent Arnold
Schwarzenegger, a Terminator T800 robot, back in time to 1984.  His job
is to kill off Hamilton who is going to give birth to John.  The humans
learning of the machines move send back in time a human to stop the T800
(who was played by Michael Biehn).  The T800 failed it's mission.</P>
<P>     In TERMINATOR 2 the machines are now desperate to kill off John
(who is played in TERMINATOR 2 by Furlong).  They send back a Terminator
version T1000 (played by Patrick) to kill off Furlong, now ten.  The
humans in an effort to stop the T1000, send back the T800 model of the
Terminator robots (played again by Schwarzenegger).</P>
<P>     On a 0 to 5 scale I give this film a 5.  The special effects in the
film, done by Industrial Light & Magic I have heard, were exceptional
(they should be for the $88 million budget the film had).  The film is
nowhere near as brutal as Arnold's tend to be, but don't be worried
though because there is still a considerable amount of violence in it.
I suggest seeing the film while it is still in the theaters for it will
lose some of its impact on a small television screen; it is well worth
the $7 for the ticket.  For more on the film for those of you who have
already seen the film you can see the next page.</P>
<P>     TERMINATOR 2 is rated R for explicit language and graphic violence.</P>
<P>     WARNING - the following may contain spoilers that may hinder your
enjoyment of watching TERMINATOR 2 and/or may spoil the end.</P>
<P>      The plot on the whole was quite well done although in a couple
spots it was obvious what was going to happen.  Like at the metal works
at the film's finale it was quite obvious where Robert Patrick was going
to end up.  The other place that comes to mind that was a bit obvious
was the inevitable end of the poor guy who, unintentionally, made the
robots who will fight the humans for the earth.</P>
<P>      Linda Hamilton plays the psycho role of John's mother to the
extreme.  I feel that she has seen too many films with Jack Nicholson
in them.  If she is really as crazy as shown in the film maybe she
should be in a mental institution.  The T1000 robot, made of a liquid
metal, could have better used its ability in some of the fight/chase
scenes.  But if it did Arnie might not have lasted through the film.  My
only other compliant is the boy, John, is supposed to be ten years old.
From his behavior I would have put his age at around sixteen.  Other
than those few problems, which don't distract from the viewing pleasure,
the film is one of the best I have seen in a long time!</P>
