<P>There have been a lot of small British movies opening in cinemas over the 
past two years, thanks to industry aid from National Lottery funding. Most of 
them have been made by bad filmmakers with insufficient budgets. And they've 
been comedies -- which is the hardest genre to get right, and the most 
embarrassing to fail at.</P>
<P>It was therefore with a sense of dread that I entered "Saving Grace", yet 
another quirky little Britcom. While it has not been paid for by the Lottery, 
its financier is Sky Pictures, the television company that ran an ad campaign 
not long ago to boast about getting exclusive rights to "What Rats Won't Do" 
and "Gargantua". Things did not look promising.</P>
<P>You can feel the "but" coming on, can't you? Well, as I said, things did not 
look promising... but "Saving Grace" is actually a sweet, good-natured little 
comedy with strong performances and humour that emerges naturally from a 
story taken seriously. Funny, how things turn out.</P>
<P>As the film opens, we see Grace Trevethan (Brenda Blethyn) in her Cornish 
mansion, preparing for the funeral of her husband. Soon she discovers that 
the late gent has left her with a killer mortgage and other assorted debts 
that total almost half a million pounds. As she has never worked, lives in a 
tiny village and is a middle-aged female, her options on how to raise the 
money are limited to say the least. What can she do?</P>
<P>The one thing Grace does have a knack for is gardening, and when times get so 
desperate that the bank is on the phone non-stop and debt collectors and 
surveyors are constantly knocking on the door, she decides to make a risky 
proposition to her doobie-smoking groundskeeper Matthew (Craig Ferguson): How 
about the two of them use hydroponics to rapidly grow a huge crop of 
marijuana, then sell it in London, and put an end to their money problems?</P>
<P>Word spreads about the plan; nobody has conversations about it, but everyone 
in town comes to know what Grace and Craig are up to, and when their 
greenhouse lights go on full blast every night, the men in the pub all put 
their sunglasses on and let out a supportive cheer. There's a cute 
conspiratorial attitude in the air -- my colleague Harvey Karten, in 
reviewing "Saving Grace", made an interesting and appropriate comparison to 
last year's "Waking Ned".</P>
<P>In a way, "Saving Grace" is better than that movie, because its characters 
aren't so artificially 'colourful'; they're ordinary people, reacting in 
amusing ways to a mischievous situation. Any moments with the potential to be 
dreadful gags are turned into wonderful comic set-pieces by the director, 
Nigel Cole, who makes sure everything serves the story, and knows that even 
the silliest humour must seem genuine to get laughs. One scene late on in his 
movie -- in which two old ladies mistake Grace's plants for tea, drink it, 
and then get the giggles and munchies at work -- is hash humour every bit as 
funny as anything Cheech and Chong ever gave us. Far out, madam.</P>
