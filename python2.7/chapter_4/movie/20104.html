<P>"I see dead people. Walking around like regular people."</P>
<P>Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia
Williams. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>*Please note: I have found it exceedingly difficult to discuss this
movie without going into plot details. While I have tried to be as vague
as possible, if you plan to see this movie and want to stay completely
clueless about its twists and turns, hold off reading what follows until
you are a Sixth Sense virgin no more.</P>
<P>The ghost story is alive and well in Hollywood, it seems, with at least
three high-profile films that fit the bill being released this year. In
the infamous month of August, a notorious dumping ground for studios who
want wash their hands of films with little potential, Spyglass
Entertainment brings us The Sixth Sense, a somber, deceptively tricky
supernatural thriller that, unlike guilty pleasure films like The Mummy,
is a keeper for all the right reasons.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis is given his first role in a looooong time that requires
him to actually -- gasp! -- act. He plays Malcolm Crowe, a child
psychologist who becomes insecure after his failure with a patient and a
subsequent incident with him. His latest patient is a child named Cole
Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a deeply troubled kid who is convinced he is a
freak because of his peers' ceaseless tauntings. But there is more to
him than meets the eye. Cole claims that he sees dead people who walk
around like regular people. Their invariably gory fatal wounds are still
intact. They want the boy to perform tasks that they themselves cannot.</P>
<P>Malcolm, the M.D. that he is, at first does not believe Cole and The
Sixth Sense risks turning into another "Nobody believes me" story.
Fortunately it makes a hairpin turn off that perilous path as the good
doctor finds proof (dubious as it may be) of the phenomenon. Cole pleads
with Malcolm to "please make them go away." How he is to accomplish that
is a far more difficult matter.</P>
<P>The Sixth Sense is a triumph of calm, confident storytelling rather than
the feverishly kinetic plotting and filming we've come to expect from
Bruce Willis films. This movie is not slow, it's steady and constant.
It's a hypnotically engaging horror mystery; scary, intriguing and
mesmerizing. Here's a movie that is far more frightening yet far less
lauded than The Blair Witch Project, a film that simply isn't nearly as
horrifying as so many claim. The Sixth Sense on the other hand has more
merit as a horror movie than many have given it.</P>
<P>I've despised Bruce Willis for his choice of projects (as opposed to
lack of talent) but here he proves that he can handle a serious role.
His is a nice, quiet, skilled performance, with barely a hint of his
infamous trademark smirk. But, at the risk of repeating other critics,
the real star of The Sixth Sense is little Haley Joel Osment, a
frighteningly talented young actor who is more then up to his
unconventionally challenging role. He not only holds his own in talky,
complex sequences with Willis, but he outshines his older, more
experienced co-star every chance he gets. The movie itself isn't an
award contender but Osment's performance should not -- and I expect that
it will not -- be forgotten come Oscar time.</P>
<P>My biggest problem with The Sixth Sense is the film's ending. It is a
lot of things: shocking, creative, "cool" and a terrific way for
director/screenwriter M. Night Shyamalan to show off his plotting
prowess. What it's not, sadly, is a satisfactory denoument to all that
preceded it. It represents a gear shift rather than a resolution. A more
traditional conclusion may not have been as blindsiding or as showy but
it would have worked better with respect to the storyline. Still, the
ending that we are given will inspire many to go for a second viewing,
or at least to rewind scenes in their had to search for the suddenly
obvious clues to what was destined to happen.</P>
<P>The Sixth Sense is a psychological thriller for the patient, discerning
viewer. It makes no attempt to appeal to those with short attention
spans nor does it aim for the lowest common denominator. It's an
intelligent, complex film (although mostly in retrospect) that flaunts
strong performances, impressive direction and a denoument that will make
your jaw drop, even if it does not resolve as much of the conflict as it
should have. Here is a summer movie that isn't a "summer movie" at all.
