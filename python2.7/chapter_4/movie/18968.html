<P>Disney, who is still the king of animation and always will be, has been in a
slump lately, with its last two animated films not doing well at the box
office, Hercules and Mulan.  Disney used to deliver classic films such as The
Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, but hasn't come out with anything even
close to the quality of those films recently, but Tarzan gives it a good shot.</P>
<P>Tony Goldwyn is the voice of Tarzan in this adaption of the famous legend.  The
film starts off from Tarzan's beginning, when he is just an infant.  In the
jungle, his parents are killed by a cheetah, but Tarzan is left unharmed, but
alone.  When Kala, voiced by Glenn Close, a gorilla who roams among the jungle
nearby where Tarzan's parents were killed, finds Tarzan, she takes him to live
with her family.  Kerchak, voiced by Lance Henrikson, who is the leader of the
ape family, doesn't want an outsider to be a part of their family, but gives in
to Kala, who will raise Tarzan alone.  While Tarzan grows up, he learns the
ways of the gorilla, taking on their language, walking style, and their
behavior.  Still after many years, Kerchak avoids Tarzan.</P>
<P>Now grown up, Tarzan has the full agility and speed that a gorilla does.  One
day while roaming the vast jungles, Tarzan discovers Porter, voiced by Nigel
Hawthorne, his daughter Jane, voiced by Minnie Driver, and friend Clayton,
voiced by Brian Blessed.  The three have set up a camp, as they plan to search
for gorillas, and Tarzan has no idea what they are, considering he doesn't even
know other humans exist.  He immediately bonds with Jane, as they become
wonderful friends as time goes on.  Jane teaches Tarzan the ways of human, the
English language, and how to walk and behave like a human.  Of course Tarzan's
entire family is upset that he has found new friends, especially his life long
friend Terk, voiced by Rosie O'Donnell.  </P>
<P>Tarzan is a new step in animated features, creating vast jungles and roaring
waterfalls that seem real.  Sequences in which Tarzan is swinging on vines
rapidly are particularly well done, creating a real environment.  Even though
the environment looks tremendously real, the gorillas do not.  This is most
likely to make them kid friendly, but if Disney has the power to make things
look real, they should include the creatures.</P>
<P>One key feature of Tarzan is that the characters don't break out into a song
every thirty seconds, but the songs are in the background while the action on
screen is taking place.  This transition was a smart move, considering most
songs in Disney films are lengthy and not well-written.  Phil Collins, who
wrote and performed all of the music for Tarzan, does a nice job.  The lyrics
and beat to the songs fit the movie perfectly, but the songs seemed too much
alike.</P>
<P>Tarzan is missing the magic that other Disney movies, such as Aladdin and The
Lion King, have had.  Aladdin and The Lion King had moving, epic stories, that
appeal to adults and children, but Tarzan seems to be an attempt for Disney to
get back in the game, and not an effort to touch the hearts of children and
adults.  Although Tarzan is good, it doesn't seem like a Disney film, lacking
humor and character development.  The Lion King was moving, as you cared about
the characters, because they were developed carefully, but in Tarzan, the
characters don't change much, and Tarzan seems to just swing around in the
trees, rather than letting the viewer get to know him better.  The only
characters who seem like they belong in this film are Jane and her father
Porter, who have light and friendly personalities that fit a Disney film.</P>
<P>After viewing Tarzan, there is no impact on me at all, there are no memorable
moments that I am still thinking about, and I hardly remember any scenes from
the movie.  Tarzan looks great, but the quality doesn't live up to the
animation.  The voices are good though, as Rosie O'Donnell, Tony Goldwyn, and
Minnie Driver give the best voice tracks among the large cast.  Tarzan isn't
for children under 7, due to the darkness and some violent sequences which
don't belong in a children's film.  If directors Kevin Lima and Chris Buck
would have made this film more kid friendly, then Tarzan would be up there with
Disney's best recent animated feature, The Lion King.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- Disney gives a good try to get back in the big time, but
doesn't succeed.</P>
