<PRE>                                FRENCH TWIST
                               (GAZON MAUDIT)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     FRENCH TWIST (GAZON MAUDIT) is a farcical romantic comedy with a
strong sexual content.  It is a French film that was a smash hit when
it was released there.  The failing of the picture is that there are
three likable characters and actors in search of a decent script, and
director too for that matter.</P>
<P>     Laurent (Alain Chabat) is a strikingly handsome playboy in his
late twenties.  He is married to a gorgeous wife Loli, (Victoria
Abril), also in her late twenties.  They have two darling children,
aged 1 and 4.  The kids are adorable and sweet as can be, and their
parents either ignore them or get irritated at them, but then again,
this is a film about a couple who doesn't pay enough attention to their
kids to deserve them.</P>
<P>     Laurent chases every young skirt that goes by, but his naive wife
thinks he has only cheated just once, and she forgave him.  Into their
life comes a lesbian named Marijo and played by Josiane Balasko, who is
also the director and cowriter.  Marijo's van breaks down, and she
comes in and fixes Loli's plumbing and then stays for dinner.  Forty
year old Marijo has the looks of a fullback and is so harsh at first
that it seems she is trying to turn off the audience.  Thankfully, her
harshness soon wears off, and she becomes as compelling a character as
the other two.</P>
<P>     Loli gets disgusted with Laurent's spending evenings out and
ignoring her when he returns claiming he is too tired - the male
equivalent of having a headache.  Eventually Loli finds out about his
massive philandering and decides that Marijo's advances, which she has
been rejecting, now look quite enticing so they start having an affair.
When Laurent finds out, he does the macho thing and punches Marijo in
the nose.  He and his obnoxious male buddy sit around during this part
of the show and mouth homophobic cliches.  Soon, however, Loli, Lauren,
and Marijo form a menage a trois.  They live under the same roof, and
Loli shares time with the other two under a precisely agreed upon
timetable. Now arriving at track two, ...</P>
<P>     As well constructed and well acted as the characters are, the
script by Patrick Aubree and Josiane Balasko, based on a story by
Telshe Boorman, is a mess.  The minor character need development, there
is no discernible plot, and there are many needless scenes.  Among the
worse is a pointless one of Lauren going to a red light district and
finding a prostitute that is over sixty.  The director is of no help in
sorting out the plot for the actors, and they seem aimless most of the
time.</P>
<P>     FRENCH TWIST runs 1:45 and would be better if was trimmer.  The
movie is in French with English subtitles.  The film is correctly rated
R for a little violence, lots of quite natural nudity, some sex,
several scenes of dope smoking, and filthy language in every other
sentence.  Large numbers of bad words are usually a giveaway that the
writer is out of ideas.  FRENCH TWIST is a movie that grows on you.
Unfortunately, it did not grow on me quite enough for me to recommend
it.  I did like the three main actors, and I hope to see all of them
again but with a better script so I am giving the film **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
