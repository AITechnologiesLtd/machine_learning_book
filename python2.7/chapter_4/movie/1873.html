                       A film review by James Berardinelli
                        Copyright 1993 James Berardinelli</PRE>

Released by New Line Cinema</P>
<P>     Ed Lover and Doctor Dre (playing themselves) are the two worst
barbers in Harlem.  In fact, they're so bad that the customers clamor
not to be next so they can avoid having those two go to work on their
hair.  Losing business because of Lover and Dre, Nick (Jim Moody), the
owner of the shop, threatens to fire the pair if they don't look for
new jobs.  In particular, he wants them to take the NYPD exam.  They
relent and, inexplicably, score high enough on the test to be admitted
to the academy.  An unspecified amount of time later, they hit the
streets as the two newest members of New York City's finest.</P>
<P>     This is a film lacking focus, direction, and a sense of
coherence.  It was obviously designed as a "star vehicle" for Doctor
Dre and Ed Lover (the hosts of MTV's YO!  MTV RAPS) without a concern
for content.  It's a low-budget, cobbled-together production that
tries too hard to put out a message while not trying hard enough to be
funny.</P>
<P>     The comedy, which comes in sporadic bursts throughout the film, is
often funny but rarely original.  There are a lot of incisive
one-liners (some of which may fall flat if not seen with a lively
audience) and a couple of sight gags.  There are also two or three
running jokes that start out fresh but become repetitive by the film's
end (it's a case of going to the well once too often).  There are
laughs peppered throughout WHO'S THE MAN--just not nearly enough of
them.</P>
<P>     The primary reason for the movie's failure lies in its plot.
Scatter-brained romps like this generally play best when they try for
as lean and silly a script as possible.  Unfortunately, while WHO'S THE
MAN's story is idiotic, it also tries to present an anti-gentrification
message (a rich white developer is buying up whole blocks in Harlem,
promising to "improve" that part of the city).  The production team's
attempts to give this film deeper meaning than the average no-brainer
comedy fall flat.  As a result, sections of the movie become
exceedingly dull and WHO'S THE MAN ends up seeming twice as long as it
needs to be.</P>
<P>     I didn't find the soundtrack to be particularly memorable, but
those who enjoy rap music will likely delight in it.  In fact, that's
one of WHO'S THE MAN's selling points (any movie that emphasizes its
soundtrack over its performers is immediately suspect).  There are a
lot of songs--they take up nearly two minutes of the end credits to
scroll across the screen (this may be a record; I'm not sure).</P>
<P>     WHO'S THE MAN reminds me somewhat of last year's MO' MONEY.  In
both cases, the comic talent behind-the-scenes never effectively
translates onto the screen (maybe the production team thought that
simple comedy wasn't enough for a motion picture).  If Dre and Lover
intend to do another film, they might look to rappers Kid 'N Play for
some inspiration.  Those two do the same kind of movies as WHO'S THE
MAN, only with much greater success.  Maybe next time, Dre and Lover
will be able to produce a film that's consistent at something rather
than all over the place.</P>
