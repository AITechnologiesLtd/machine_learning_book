<P>Plot: John Steed, an agent for The Ministry, is assigned to keep an eye 
on Emma Peel, a lithe and beautiful  meteorologist, suspected of 
breaking into The Prospero Program - something she denies. Together the 
two form a partnership to take on the crazed Sir August de Wynter, a 
Scotsman who has harnessed the Prospero Program and is creating weather 
havoc to force the nations of the world to each give him ten percent of 
their GNP.</P>
<P>‘The Avengers' tv series (1962-9) was the height of 1960s chic. It 
jumped on the vogue for spy films started by the James Bond series but 
gave it its own surreally droll British manneredness - its two agents 
engaged in deliberately unreal adventures where they seemed more 
concerned about the champagne getting above room temperature than they 
were about imminent danger. The series began less flamboyantly in 1961 
as a routine black-and-white policier called ‘Police Surgeon' where 
Patrick MacNee's Steed was only the sidekick to Ian Hendry's title 
doctor. But in 1962 MacNee was promoted to the star of the show, the 
series renamed ‘The Avengers' and the rest is history. The first few 
seasons which paired MacNee with Honor Blackman (and for about six 
episodes at the very beginning nightclub singer Venus Smith played by 
Julie Stevens) were still standard police stories. It wasn't until the 
arrival of Diana Rigg in 1965 that the series became what it is known 
for today with the police stories supplanted by a surreal, cartoon 
universe of mad scientists and British imperturbability and Rigg 
outfitted in leather bodysuits and mini- skirts, a combination that 
turned the show into a cult phenomenon. The series was killed off in 
1969 with Rigg's departure and her disastrous replacement by Linda 
Thorson who substituted Rigg's sly flirtatiousness for a vacant 
airheadedness. The series was briefly revived as the underrated ‘The New 
Avengers' in 1976-7 with a leggy Joanna Lumley making for a lithe and 
sexy agent that rivalled Diana Rigg for on-screen class.</P>
<P>‘The Avengers' is now the latest to be revamped in the current fad for 
big screen revivals of 1960s tv series,  following the likes of 
‘Mission: Impossible', ‘The Saint', ‘Lost in Space', ‘The Beverly 
Hillbillies', the ‘Addams Family' movies and the upcoming revivals of 
‘The Mod Squad', ‘Bewitched', ‘My Favourite Martian' and ‘Gilligan's 
Island'. One could sense long in advance that the project was going to 
be a disaster in the happening. First their was the initial planned 
castings of Mel Gibson as Steed and Nicole Kidman as Mrs Peel. (Is there 
really an actor whose persona is less suited to the part of the 
perfectly mannered gentleman Steed than Gibson ? I was kind of holding 
out for Charles Dance and Emma Thompson in the parts). And then their 
was the assignment of Jeremiah Chechik to the director's chair. Chechik 
made his debut with ‘National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' in 1989 and 
has yet to make a good film. Chechik's ‘Tall Tale' (1994) was a film 
about Western legends like Pecos Bill and John Bunyan but fell flat 
because it seemed scared of and ended up trying to be everything else 
except a tall tale, while his next, 1996's ‘Diabolique' disastrously 
tried to remake the classic 1955 French thriller ‘Les Diaboliques' with 
an upbeat ending. Even ‘The Avengers' distributors could see the film 
was going to be a disaster before it opened and conducted the almost 
unprecedented desperation measure of refusing critics any preview 
screenings on the grounds that "they didn't want the film unfairly 
compared to the original series". (I do hate to puncture the reality 
these guys seem to live in but you are selling a remake - you can't 
revive a tv series and then not expect critics let alone an audience to 
compare it to the original). And needless to say the film has been 
pilloried by critics and audiences alike and is already  being 
considered the biggest disaster of the year.</P>
<P>Certainly it is technically a well made film. The photography is lush 
and sumptuous and there is some fine model effects work and dazzling 
sets. And the film has certainly done its homework when it comes to 
studying the series and copying everything from Mrs Peel's costumes to 
outfitting Steed with his vintage Bentley and steel-capped bowler hat 
and Mrs Peel with her MGB. It even gets full marks for quoting the 
series' explanation of what happened to Mr Peel.</P>
<P>But for all that it is really a rather sad film. All the droll British 
understatement comes far too posed. The jokes about Steed's impeccable 
coiffure, tea drinking, macaroons and brollies, the unflappable cool in 
the midst of danger - are all set up as obvious gags. But the effect is 
less one of droll wit than it is of affected retro-chic - it is like a 
funny incident that loses its spontaneity in the retelling.</P>
<P>The casting has tried hard but ends up a disaster. Ralph Fiennes tries 
to do a droll Steed but comes out more like a bland, colourless Oxbridge 
fop, while Uma Thurman's Mrs Peel is wooden and vapid, lacking in any of 
Diana Rigg's teasing flirtatiousness. Sean Connery delivers one of the 
worst performances he has ever given, reduced to slavering and lusting 
over Uma.</P>
<P>And the plot verges on the completely disjointed. It seems to have been 
constructed out of sequences that somebody thought was cool - Mrs Peel 
trapped in an M.C. Escher-modelled house (clearly an echo of the episode 
‘The House That Jack Built'), an attack by robot insects, a really daft 
scene where a group of conspirators meet dressed as teddybears - but 
these are like incidents that just seem to happen without any connecting 
sensibility. A clone of Mrs Peel runs about for half the film without 
even any explanation as to what she's doing there. Even the initial 
assignment Steed is given has a thorough vagueness to it - he is merely 
assigned to keep an eye on Mrs Peel and this somehow instantly becomes 
an investigation into Connery's super-villain. It is sad that the film, 
for all the technical care that has been clearly lavished on it, can 
miss the mark so widely when it comes to the fundamentals and above all 
capturing the panache that made the series so memorable in the first 
place.</P>
