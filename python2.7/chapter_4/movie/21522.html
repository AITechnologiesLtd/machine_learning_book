<PRE>Coughing up the Truth
The Insider</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Based on the May 1996 Vanity Fair article "The Man Who Knew Too Much" by
Marie Brenner, "The Insider" follows the trials and tribulations of a former
big tobacco executive who coughs up sobering truths concerning cigarette
addiction. Mann's script remains boldly true to the article, right down to
naming names (CBS, Wallace, B&W, etc.); Mississippi Attorney General Michael
Moore even plays himself, "I saw it as a chance to have some fun and be a
part of history again." (Quote from production notes.)</P>
<P>Russell Crowe, almost completely unrecognizable from his long-haired,
hockey-playing, mountain man look in "Mystery, Alaska," works out the
nervous cricks in his neck as the middle-aged, whistle-blowing, former VP of
B&M (Kools, Viceroy). Managing the difficult role of an intelligent,
imperfectly sincere, tough, slowly crumbling pillar, Crowe displays
appropriately tamed flare and rugged modesty.</P>
<P>Pacino plays Lowell Bergman, producer of "60 minutes" and Wallace's right
hand guy. It's Lowell that erects the soap box/guillotine for Dr. Wigand's
big bean spillage. Willing to loose it all (family, reputation, even
freedom), Dr. Wigand refuses to be squelched by Tobacco's less than subtle
intimidation tactics (including but not limited to death threats). In fact,
the movie plays a bit like a horror flick at times ... Is the house safe for
the family? Will one of the kids be snatched away? Will an un-snuffed cigar
butt start the place on fire? Wigand weighs the risks: personal welfare vs.
right vs. stubborn horse pride, "I can't seem to find the criteria to
decide."</P>
<P>Eventually, Lowell's proximity and passion to this truth-teller leaves him
feeling the stinging singes of hot coals as well. Pacino's performance, as
in other films, is flawless. He's strong, passionate and completely driven.</P>
<P>Interestingly enough, I don't recall a single lit cigarette or pipe in the
entire picture, not even from a passer-by; perhaps making the film's only
flaw (if you wish to call it that) a wisping tendency toward the preachy.
Nonetheless, "The Insider" delivers good entertaining drama. After it's two
hour and thirty-seven minute duration, you'll still be left wanting more.</P>
