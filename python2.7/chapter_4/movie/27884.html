THE ANARCHISTS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Set in 1924 Shanghai during the turmoil caused by the political 
occupation by the Japanese of Shanghai and Korea, THE ANARCHISTS tells a 
gripping saga of a fight against repression.  With an epic look and 
feel, the picture is reminiscent of THE GODFATHER, although there are 
John Woo (MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II) style action touches as well.  
Directed powerfully by Yu Young-Sik, the story is very loosely based on 
a true story related to him by his grandfather.</P>
<P>Rejecting socialism as just another form of totalitarianism, the 
anarchists band together as political terrorists fighting against the 
Japanese.  Bound not by blood but by a common political bond, they fight 
with little lasting effect against much, much stronger forces.</P>
<P>With strong, melancholic music, lush cinematography, beautiful costumes, 
handsome period sets and good acting all around, the movie is stunning 
as well as touching.  Only the script, which meanders when it should 
stay focused, is a significant downfall.  The movie would be 
substantially helped if it were to begin with a brief history lesson.  
After our screening, the director and the host filled in some of the 
complicated politics of that era, which helped provide some context for 
what we had seen.  Without such explanations, Western audiences are 
likely to leave the theater quite impressed but a bit confused.</P>
<P>THE ANARCHISTS runs 1:40.  The film is in Korean with English subtitles.  
It is not rated but would be an R for violence and brief nudity.  It 
would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
