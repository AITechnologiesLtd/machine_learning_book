<PRE>JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK     * * ½</PRE>
<PRE>2001 – USA 
Director: Kevin Smith
Starring: Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Shannon Elizabeth, Ben Affleck, Will
Ferrell</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>There's an unwritten screenwriting rule that you should never write about your
own life because people aren't interested. Luckily, Cameron Crowe completely
ignored this idea. Unfortunately, Kevin Smith did not. `Jay and Silent Bob
Strike Back' is the world's biggest in-joke, a culmination to Smith's last four
pictures, `Clerks', `Mallrats', `Chasing Amy', and `Dogma'. It is a satire that
constantly winks at the audience, but leaves it's funniest moments to subtlety
The film doesn't work on an intelligent level unless you've seen the above four
films, and know all about Kevin Smith's battles (bumping heads with `Magnolia'
director Paul Thomas Anderson, ABC airing his TV show only for legal reasons) as
an independent filmmaker. It's a pretty big assumption that we want to get
involved with his ego, but Smith takes us there anyway. It makes for sheer
brilliance hiding under a whole lot of mediocrity. </P>
<P>The plot, so to speak, follows Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob's (Smith) road
trip from Jersey to Hollywood. They're trying to stop Hollywood from making a
movie for which they are obviously the source material. (If that isn't irony,
what is?) Along the way, they get involved with some very attractive `animal
activists' who aren't who they appear to be, Jay falls in love, and joints are
passed. </P>
<P>A wide variety of celebrities make cameo appearances in the film, mostly
spoofing themselves. Carrie Fisher, George Carlin, Jason Biggs, Shannon Doherty,
Chris Rock, Matt Damon, and  James Van Der Beek are just a few of the many
surprises. Ben Affleck (looking quite dazed), Shannon Elizabeth, and Will
Ferrell are all effective in small roles. </P>
<P>One must really wonder what type of audience Smith was trying to reach with this
film. There's no future for this production as a film, since the references are
far too current to last more than a year or two, and the stupid humor wasn't
appealing because the film has a bitter core. The film is largely a cleverly
disguised tirade about the studio system. It hits many things on the mark, but
there isn't the same endearing quality that `Dude, Where's My Car?' or `American
Pie' have. We simply don't care about the characters.</P>
<P>Sadly, the film aims its crosshairs on places other than Hollywood. A large
majority of the humor is homophobic, and would be quite degrading and offensive
to anyone with an open mind, Smith's usual crowd. Whether the jokes are meant to
be taken seriously (as religious groups joke the jokes in `Dogma'), is in
question, but there's just too much negative material to ignore. Then there's
the humor that's just plain stupid, overdone, and unfunny.</P>
<P>But for all the bad jokes, there are some great ones. I laughed uncontrollably
around ten times, mostly at places where the rest of the audience didn't. </P>
<P>When Silent Bob finally talks in the second half of the movie, the audience at
my screening cheered. It was a Marcel Marceau in `Silent Movie' for the
generation of 2001. </P>
<P>Smith can do better. Don't see the movie if you don't know all about him, or
don't see many movies. You'll just be presented with some rather vulgar humor,
and there are better movies for that. For those more film-inclined, it's an
exclusive party, but a lame one at that. </P>
