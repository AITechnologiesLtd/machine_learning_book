<P>THE EMPEROR AND THE ASSASSIN: A film review by Athan Bezaitis
Copyright Filmcritic.com 2000</P>
<P>THE EMPEROR AND THE ASSASSIN sets a new standard for quality of
production.  The story, costumes, sets, music, and performances all have
such a powerful authenticity that after watching it, I felt like I had
just lived through a two-thousand year old episode of Chinese history.
Director Chen Kaige's (YELLOW EARTH, TEMPTRESS MOON) film lives up to
its billing and is a worthwhile success (not to mention the most
expensive Asian film ever produced).</P>
<P>Set in third century BC, THE EMPEROR AND THE ASSASSIN is the story of
Ying Zheng (Li Xuejian), leader of the Kingdom of Qin, whose goal is to
conquer the six other kingdoms of China and merge them into one unified
land.  To accomplish this objective, he embarks upon a horrific reign of
terror and brutality against all who stand between him and his destiny.</P>
<P>In an attempt to aid Zheng's conquering of China, Lady Zhao, (Gong Li)
his lover since childhood, devises an intricate fake assassination plot
against him, which, when "uncovered," will provide him with a legitimate
excuse to invade the neighboring kingdom of Yan, his greatest obstacle
to unification.  When Zheng betrays her trust and invades her homeland
of Zhao killing thousands including innocent children, she turns against
him.  As part of the original scheme to be in exile in the kingdom of
Yan, she encounters Jing Ke (Zhang Fengyi), a great warrior and former
assassin.  They fall madly in love and she attempts to convince him,
along with The Prince of Yan, to kill the King of Qin before he becomes
Emperor and continues his tyranny.</P>
<P>The story is a bit confusing because so much is lost in the translation
from Mandarin, but pay close attention, and you'll be able to follow
along.  What I found most enjoyable about the film was its character
portrayals within the context of a historical deconstruction.  From the
assassin, Jing Ke, to the power-hungry Ying Zheng, the emotions and
reactions are surprisingly humanistic, and I could easily relate, even
though the plot takes place two thousand years ago, and is part of a
civilization totally different than our own.  For example, Jing Ke is an
assassin who is able to recognize the wrong in killing through the power
of love and rises against King Zheng.  Also, Lady Zhao is a woman who,
in her naiveté, believed that a benevolent leadership under a united
emperor would stop the bloodshed that the people of China had faced for
hundreds of years.  These endearing characters, most of which are
fictional, blend in perfectly with the historical setting and add the
much-needed element of passion into the dramatic mix of the story.</P>
<P>THE EMPEROR AND THE ASSASSIN is not to be missed.  It breaks from the
typical American mold with its slow developing plot and strenuous length
(over two and a half hours), but captures the quality of the finest
homegrown products reminiscent of BRAVEHEART or DANCES WITH WOLVES.
Indulge yourself in an in this epic rendition of a tumultuous episode of
ancient Chinese history.</P>
