<PRE>THE BALLAD OF NARAYAMA (1982)</PRE>
<P>"Old Orin was a lucky woman.  Snow fell when she went to Narayama."</P>
<PRE>3.5 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Starring Ken Ogata, Sumiko Sakamoto, Tonpei Hidari, Seiji Kurasaki
Directed & Written by Shohei Imamura
Cinematography by Masao Tochizawa</P>
<P>Life is hard for the people on the mountain.  Their late 19th century 
village is far from civilization, in northern Japan, and they struggle 
to subsist on the meagre fruits of the earth.   Marriages are not 
decided by anything as frivolous as love, but rather by the need to 
survive, to perpetuate the species.  Dead babies are dumped 
unceremoniously in a neighbour's rice field; living babies, especially 
girls, may be sold. Justice is swift and merciless; whole families may 
be brutally punished for a crime committed by one member.</P>
<P>People who live in a place like this need something to give them 
hope, something to provide structure and meaning for their hardships.  
For the people in this village, that something is Narayama.  It is not 
clear, until near the movie's end, what exactly Narayama is, but we 
know it holds deep significance.  A younger woman, seriously ill, 
laments that she may die without visiting Narayama.  An older woman, 
nearing the age of 70, the age when people make the trip to Narayama, 
speaks of her impending journey with eagerness; she is so determined 
to go that she breaks off her front teeth, smashing them with a stone, 
to prove her health is failing and it is time for her to depart.</P>
<P>Ken Ogata (THE PILLOW BOOK, MISHIMA) has top billing in the film, but 
the centre of the story is his mother, Orin (Sumiko Sakamoto), the old 
woman readying herself to go to Narayama.  Ogata plays her elder son, 
Tatsuhei, who is deeply concerned with his family's honour and his 
duties towards them--so much so that he does not much seem to enjoy 
life.  The younger son (Tonpei Hidari) is a simple lad, with a rather 
poor sense of hygiene--so much so that no woman in the village will 
sleep with him, and he takes his pleasure from a neighbour's dog.  
Tatsuhei's son, Kesa (Seiji Kurasaki), has not yet learned the 
difficult truths that age will bring; he cavorts with young women of 
the village, impregnating one girl, with no heed for the consequences.  
A baby is not a happy addition to the home: it is an extra mouth to 
feed.</P>
<P> The first two-thirds of the movie observe Orin's life, and that of 
her family and their neighbours, during the months preceding her 
departure.  We see her arrange for a woman to have sex with her 
younger son, making sure he has lost his virginity before she leaves; 
we see her subtly enforce the village's strong-arm justice, when she 
sends Kesa's pregnant girlfriend off to her family one night, knowing 
that they are to be punished for a crime her father committed.  The 
punishment is shown in objective, horrifying detail, and is one of the 
film's most powerful moments.  Imamura sometimes seems to view these 
people's lives as a long, miserable journey toward death, especially 
in moments of raw brutality like this dispensation of justice.  There 
is beauty in the film, but it has little to do with the people.  
Scenes of animals copulating, hunting, preying on one another, are 
intercut with the villager's activities, and these are stirring 
images, as are various longshots of wilderness vistas, but they seem 
to show human life as at best an irrelevancy, at worst an 
embarrassment, in this primal world.</P>
<P>But the first part of the movie, somewhat confused and overlong, is 
merely preparation for the bravura finale, when we finally learn why 
the villagers regard Narayama with such reverence.  Its location is a 
secret, conferred to Tatsuhei and Orin in a special ceremony, and the 
directions include going around a pond three times, passing through 
the Seven Valleys, that sort of thing.  Tatsuhei and Orin undertake 
this near-mythic journey, and the film becomes a remarkable meditation 
on human mortality, a meditation achieved through powerful, simple 
images.</P>
<P>There are bold, visionary moments (which I will not reveal) in these 
closing scenes, but there are also quiet, intimate moments, equally 
significant.  Tatsuhei comes upon an old, crude bridge, made of three 
planks; two of them are rotten and fall away at his touch, yet he is 
prepared to crawl across the one remaining plank, exhausted, feet raw 
and bleeding, Orin on his back, so that his mother can reach her goal.  
She says nothing, but taps him on the shoulder and motions for him to 
find another route.  This moment, and what it says about their 
unspoken love for each other, is powerful.  Later, they come upon 
other travellers headed for Narayama, a son carrying his father; the 
son treats the father in a peremptory, brusque manner, and then 
commits an act of shocking cruelty.  There is no love, no respect, and 
the difference between this pair and Orin and Tatsuhei is, we sense, 
the difference between a life without meaning and a life with some 
meaning.  It is nuances like this that earn a filmmaker adjectives 
like "great."</P>
<P>Shohei Imamura has been making films for 40 years now, and is indeed 
considered by some to be one of the world's great directors; as with 
many other great foreign directors currently at work, his films are 
difficult to find in North America, even though he is one of only 
three directors (the others being Francis Ford Coppola and Emil 
Kusturica) to have won two Palmes d'Or, one for this film and the 
other for 1997's THE EEL.</P>
<P>He is a difficult filmmaker, whose works offer no easy pleasures.  
His vision of the world is bleak and dark and pessimistic.  He doesn't 
give his characters any lucky breaks, but, then, life hasn't given 
them any lucky breaks either.  It is easy to dismiss him as a cold 
nihilist.  But Imamura has taken it upon himself, throughout his long 
career, to explore the lives of the disenfranchised, to give them a 
voice, and there is more compassion in this choice than in a dozen 
exercises in cheap sentimentality.   He considers the lives of people 
most filmmakers don't want to consider: the prostitute in THE INSECT 
WOMAN, the serial killer in VENGEANCE IS MINE, the radiation victims 
in BLACK RAIN, and a 70-year-old woman, nearing death in a remote 
mountain village.  While he offers his characters few comforts, this 
makes the rewards they do earn all the more meaningful.  Because we 
have seen a measure of the pain she has suffered, the peace earned by 
Orin at the end of THE BALLAD OF NARAYAMA is truly profound, and so is 
the film.</P>
