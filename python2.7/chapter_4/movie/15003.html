<PRE>_The_Cruise_ (PG-13) ***
_Unmade_Beds_ ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>After the first five minutes of _The_Cruise_, I wanted to shoot the
documentary's subject, wildly eccentric New York tour bus guide Timothy
"Speed" Levitch.  Ceaselessly babbling in a nasal voice just a tad more
listenable than Fran Drescher's, he got on my nerves instantaneously.  But
as Bennett Miller's beautifully photographed black-and-white film
progressed, I became fascinated by him.  Though ostensibly about his love
affair with every last aspect of the city, _The_Cruise_ gradually reveals
itself to be a most unique character study, where the subject reveals
himself not through the personal information he imparts (there are vague
allusions to a bad relationship with his parents and failed attempts at a
writing career), but all else he talks about--and talk he does, in florid
verbiage that reveals less about objects than his poetic nature.</P>
<P>A little more straightforward on the surface is the dark and depressing
_Unmade_Beds_, which follows four New Yorkers on their never-ending (and
never-successful) quests for true love and happiness.  Our subjects: Aimee
Copp, a goodhearted 28-year-old with a weight problem (she weighs 225
pounds) who longs to be married before the big 3-0; Mikey Russo, a
54-year-old struggling screenwriter who is proud of his womanizing past;
40-year-old, 5'4" Michael DeStephano, a bitter but likable guy who more
than reminds of _Seinfeld_'s George Costanza; and, most memorably, Brenda
Monte, a brash, buxom 40-something divorcee who is less interested in love
than a man with deep enough pockets to support her and her 16-year-old
daughter.</P>
<P>But, as I said, _Unmade_Beds_ is only straightforward on the surface.
While these are real people followed over a period of nine months, as the
opening disclaimer says, it is not stated that the happenings onscreen are
fictionalized.  Writer-director Nicholas Barker based his script on
extensive interviews with his cast, using their real-life happenings as a
jumping-off point for those in his script.  While these people's true
personalities and pain are clearly revealed throughout, sometimes
discomfitingly so (Aimee's pain is most acutely felt), it is that unique
veneer of fiction that makes the film fall short.  Instead of enhancing the
real truths that Barker is after, the fiction, appropriately enough,
diminishes any truth he finds; this is especially the case with a late
"plot twist" involving Brenda's fortunes.  While _Unmade_Beds_ is
engrossing, engaging viewing, I cannot shake the feeling that it would have
been moreso had I seen the whole truth.</P>
