<P>    Stop reading this review right now.  Quickly shut down your 
computer, and leave to go see L.A. Confidential.  Then see it again.  
Are you back?  Good.  Now we can talk
    What I have just done is send you on one of the best film-rides in 
the last 25 years.  Welcome to Curtis Hanson's "L.A. Confidential", a 
tribute to the great film noirs like Roman Polanski's "Chinatown".  If 
possible, LAC might be even grittier than Chinatown.  Hanson sets up a
brutally honest, savagely entertaining ride through a convoluted plot 
that is so confusing it makes perfect sense, with a cast so fabulous 
they deserve to sweep the Oscars. 
    "L.A Confidential" is not the best movie of the year.  It's the best 
5 movies of the year.  The plot revolves around two cops, Bud White and 
Ed Exley (the absoulutely amazing Wonders from Down Under: Russell Crowe 
and Guy Pearce).  White is a brutal tough-guy, a man who basically 
punches who is bosses tell him to punch, a loyal, fiercely honest cop 
with a hatred for wife-beaters.  Exley is the son of a heroic detective, 
he is a brilliant, ambitious cop with a flair.  The story essentially 
begins when a bunch of Mexicans are brought into the station.  The 
police take their racism into their jobs by brutally beating the 
suspects, in an incident found on the front-page of the paper.  White 
and another police officer, Jack Vincennes (the incredible Spacey) are 
implicated in the beatings, but no police officer is willing to give 
corroborative testimony....but Exley.  This results in Exley being 
promoted, and he also being the butt of everyone else's hatred.
    There's one storyline.  Here's another.  Gossip king Sid Hudgeons 
(Danny DeVito) pays Vincennes and gives him tips on how to arrest major 
stars committing crimes.  In exchange, Vincennes makes big arrests on 
the front page of Hush-Hush, Hudgeons' magazine.  Vincennes is also the 
technical advisor on Badge of Honor, a Dragnet-like show.  Vincennes 
therefore has to constantly worry about his image, as he is a rising 
star, a national celebrity in the making.  Spacey plays this role to 
absolute perfection, his glamorous smile and flamboyance are flawless.
    That's two.  I told you L.A. Confidential had 5.  Here's the major 
one, numero 3.  A prominent businessman is having plastic surgery done 
to girls to make them look like movie stars.  It turns out this 
businessman is a high-class pimp, with these girls as his celebrity 
prostitutes.  All of these plots link to a murder at the Nite Owl Coffee 
Shop, where White's partner is killed.  There are dozens of other plots, 
all connecting into one hell of a convoluted mess, which shouldn't work. 
    Not only does this movie work, it is a mindbending spell of a film.  
The line between good and evil is blurred beyond repair.  Hanson places 
his story in a dirty, wild atmosphere of pure crime.  James Cromwell, as 
both White's and Exley's boss, is simply astounding as Captain Dudley 
Smith.  Kim Basinger makes the role of her career as prostitute Lynn 
Bracken, a Veronica Lake lookalike.  The Wonders from Down Under are 
simply that: wonders.  Crowe and Pearce are simply amazing.  Spacey is 
his usually brilliant self.  His sheer confidence carries his role.  
Every plot-line comes together in this gritty, vividly entertaning film. 
 Everyone is pitch-perfect, the casting is stunning, and the direction 
is flawless.  Hanson and Brian Helgeland's script is stunningly 
captivating, with its intricate plotlines all combining to form one hell 
of a movie.  I can't think of any flaws.  L.A. Confidential may suffer 
solely from its excessive brutality and sex, but in a way, its 
absolutely needed.  LAC shows us a dirty time, in a dirty world, with 
crap infiltrating every life.  It's gorgeously done to perfection.  
Hollywood hasn't been this good in a long time.  This is the best film 
of the year. </P>
