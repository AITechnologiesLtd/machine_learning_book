                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>

<P>     WHORE depicts a day in the life of a prostitute.  It follows one
prostitute, played by Theresa Russell, from morning till night.  Along
the way Russell talks about her life and those she loves.</P>
<P>     WHORE is a gritty, depressing, graphic, yet powerful and emotional
film.  WHORE is *not* an erotic or porno film.  It doesn't try to
titillate you in any way.  It contains minimal nudity, and the sex
scenes are less than erotic.  Instead it shows what a prostitute goes
through.  The film does not try to please you, but on the other hand, it
doesn't purposely offend you.  Many people probably will be offended
because of the straightforwardness of this film, but it isn't for
everybody.  People who are out looking for cheap thrills will be sorely
disappointed with this film.  If you are in the mood for a good drama,
and you are watching with an open mind, you will probably love this
film.  WHORE is available in two versions, an NC-17 rated version and an
unrated version.  The unrated version runs for 5 more minutes than the
NC-17 one.  One a scale of zero to five, I give WHORE a five.  WHORE is
rated NC-17 for explicit language, adult situations, and female nudity.</P>
<P>     Part of the reason this film ends up so good is because of its
excellent cast.  Theresa Russell gives a very powerful and emotional
performance.  This may be her best film yet.  She brought me right into
her character and made me feel for her.  Benjamin Mouton gives an
equally powerful performance as Russell's slimeball pimp.  He makes his
character repellent, yet shows that he is a human too.  Antonio Fargas
plays a weird guy who Russell meets on the street.  His is an impressive
performance.  The rest of the cast of this film, who all have bit parts,
do a great job.  Especially Jack Nance as the school teacher, Ginger
Lynn Allen as the hurt prostitute, Tom Villard as the hippie, the person
who played the no-condom man, and Russell's book friend.</P>
<P>     I really enjoyed the opening song "Doing the Bang" by Fascinating
Force.  I feel that it accurately shows the way many people feel about
prostitutes.  I feel this song was much more appropriate than some rock
song that has nothing to do with the movie.  I don't remember the rest
of the music from the movie.  At least it wasn't distracting.</P>
<P>     Ken Russell's (no relation to Theresa) directing is excellent and
the writing is superb.  The story is very gripping and interesting.
Theresa Russell's flashbacks are well weaved into the film so they don't
appear awkward.  The actors don't send up with any moronic dialog, which
sometimes happens in films.</P>
<P>     WHORE does not condone, or put down, prostitution.  It shows it for
what it is, and nothing more; mostly from the prostitute's point of
view, some as seen by the pimp, and a very little as seen by the
customer.  WHORE could probably have gotten away with an R rating,
except that the subject matter requires a certain amount of maturity.
This is not appropriate for young teens.</P>
