BASIC INSTINCT
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>There are many ways in which a movie could be influential.
Some are influential because they are truly landmarks of
movie history; others simply make big money and inspire
multitude of cheap imitations that could be seen as subgenre
by themselves. In 1990s such subgenre was made of "erotic
thrillers" - films that tried to compensate forgettable
plots with one or two scenes of sex, as explicit as puritan
American censors would allow. After many of those films
failed as big Hollywood projects, genre of erotic thriller
found its purpose in the domain of straight-to-video,
satisfying the needs of the audience too shy to seek porn
titles in video stores. This subgenre, one of the most
despised by mainstream critics in 1990s, owes its existence
to one of the most overhyped films in the history. This film
is BASIC INSTINCT, 1992 thriller by Paul Verhoeven, which
also happens to be one of favourite guilty pleasures for the
author of this review.</P>
<P>Plot of the film begins when retired rock star has torrid
sex with mysterious blonde only to get stabbed to death with
an ice pick in the heat of passion. His murder is being
investigated by Nick Curran (played by Michael Douglas), San
Francisco police detective with long and painful personal
record of alcoholism, cocaine abuse and frequent shooting
incidents that had tragic consequences. His attempts to lead
healthy life under the guidance of police counsellor and his
occasional girlfriend Doctor Elizabeth Garner (played by
Jeanne Tripplehorn) begin to crumble when he encounters the
murder suspect in the form of deceased rocker's girlfriend.
Catherine Trammel (played by Sharon Stone) is not just
stunningly attractive woman and rich heiress; her degree in
psychology enables her to play with people's minds. There
isn't any evidence pointing to her guilt, but her biography
indicates that people around here have a tendency to suffer
violent deaths; most disturbing about it is the fact that
such incidents, including the latest murder, had been
vividly described in Catherine Trammel's novels. Curran is
convinced of her guilt and wants to find the conclusive
evidence, but his determination is followed with Trammel's
willingness to engage into perverse mind games, in which she
would use her seductive abilities as well as Curran's own
animal impulses.</P>
<P>Two things turned BASIC INSTINCT into one of the most
overhyped films of 1992. First one was the record amount of
money paid for the screenplay by Joe Eszterhas (of later
SHOWGIRLS infamy). The other one was the unprecedented wave
of street protest by American gay activists over alleged
negative portrayal of lesbian and bisexual characters in the
film (those demonstrations, staged at the zenith of
Political Correctness, later had major impact on Hollywood;
few producers would ever dare to have a less than saintly
gay characters in their movies). For the author of this
review, both the film's producers and demonstrators were
wrong. First of all, Eszterhas' script, although not as bad
as his later reputation would indicate, was hardly worthy of
those 3 millions US$. The plot, which was supposed to be
whodunit style murder mystery is full of red herrings, major
plot holes and elements and situations that sometimes really
insult viewers' intelligence. And, before the script
culminates in corny and weak ending, it is being spiced with
all police movie cliches plus some added bonus in form of
sex, drugs, police corruption and all possible ingredients
of decadent lifestyle.</P>
<P>Allegedly unfavourable (at least for 1990s PC standards)
portrayal of homosexual characters actually corresponds with
the way Eszterhas treated everyone else in this movie.
Hardly any character is likeable - they are all either
incredibly stupid, bigoted, flawed or simply lack any values
associated with decent human beings. The only exception -
character we actually care for - is Curran's partner Gus,
but that has more to do with the way George Dzundza played
this character than with corny lines and stereotypical
character written by Eszterhas.</P>
<P>Having all that in mind, BASIC INSTINCT could be viewed as a
triumph of style over substance. Verhoeven had really
tremendous task in hiding such terrible flaws of the script
and turning this film into truly enjoyable piece of trash
cinema. He succeeded in this by staging some elaborate
scenes that would later become memorable. The best example
is, of course, famous interrogation scene which is excellent
combination of superb editing, costume design by Ellen
Mirojnick, suggestive photography by Jan de Bont, and, of
course, Sharon Stone's acting. After being exposed to such
brilliant piece of manipulative filmmaking who would bother
to think about story that doesn't make sense? Just in case,
Verhoeven uses all tricks in the books, by providing some
good action and gore and indulging himself in Hitchcockian
references - those associated with VERTIGO are most obvious,
thanks to San Francisco scenery. But the biggest attention
is given to the oldest and most effective ingredient of
successful trash - sex. Apart from usual quantities of
nudity, both male and female, this film provides scenes of
very graphic sex, as close to softcore porn as possible in
the puritanical atmosphere of Hollywood. Those scenes,
source of great hype at the time, might look rather mild or
even boring after so many years; but Verhoeven, compared
with his imitators (including himself in dreadful and
downright anti-erotic SHOWGIRLS) looks like a real
grandmaster of Hollywood style smut.</P>
<P>The biggest contribution to the BASIC INSTINCT was
definitely given by her female lead Sharon Stone. That
actress here played the role of a lifetime, creating one of
the most memorable characters in the history of cinema.
Catherine Trammel might be too much of a character in the
script to be believable - beautiful woman, intelligent
manipulator and psychopathic villain. Yet, Sharon Stone
manages to bring her to life; she doesn't just look
stunningly beautiful - she simply oozes sexuality, combined
with the great confidence of superior mind and the seductive
appeal of utter evil. Men (and some women) are powerless
against such unstoppable sex machine; for many of them being
ice-picked to death might even seem like a acceptable price
for brief moments of ecstasy in her bed. This great role of
Sharon Stone (that would actually begin to haunt her in the
rest of her career) shadowed everyone else. For Michael
Douglas it wasn't such a problem, since he only reprised the
role of oversexed male pig from FATAL ATRACTION. But Jeanne
Tripplehorn was not so convincing as her rival and later had
to work much harder in order to establish herself as a real
actress. Actually, in the long run, BASIC INSTINCT had hurt
careers of almost everyone involved, despite being
commercial success. The only exception, perhaps, is Jerry
Goldsmith; his great, atmospheric musical score was often
praised as the best element of the film; even those who
don't like BASIC INSTINCT are often saying that Goldsmith's
score improved the general impression.</P>
<P>All in all, BASIC INSTINCT is a film that should be viewed
as nothing more than a good example of Hollywood
craftsmanship. It is enjoyable little flick that didn't
deserve its popularity, as well as its infamy.</P>
