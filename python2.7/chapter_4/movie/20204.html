<P>A group of wannabe superheroes have to save Champion City's one true
hero, Captain Amazing, from the clutches of the evil Casanova
Frankenstein.</P>
<PRE>The Review</PRE>
<P>    Superheroes have had an easy ride in motion pictures. While other
popular film topics such as the Mafia (Analyze This) and the military
(Hot Shots) have been spoofed to death, relatively few parodies have
been made about superheroes; Meteor Man immediately comes to mind.
The Superman series, while light, always kept Supe himself
serious. Within this year of parodies and dark, biting comedies, you
would think that the time for Mystery Men had come. Unfortunately it
has such a large cast that there isn't enough screen time available
for any of them to shine, making this an uneven film with lots of
unused potential.</P>
<P>    Mr. Furious (Stiller) leads his comrades The Shoveller (Macy) and
The Blue Raja (Azaria) in a constant fight against crime. The problem
is that they have no real superpowers. Mr. Furious just gets mad, The
Shoveller swings a shovel and The Blue Raja, most pathetically of all,
throws forks. They are unnoticed and unneeded in Champion City, where
Captain Amazing (Kinnear) routinely keeps the streets clean of
crime. It's only when the Capt. gets kidnapped by the evil Casanova
Frankenstein (Rush) that they become the city's saviours. To save him,
they enlist the help of The Bowler (Garofalo), who throws a magical
bowling ball which has her father's skull embedded in it, The Spleen
(Reubens), a disgusting man whose projectile flatulence is his weapon,
The Sphinx (Studi), who can occasionally break guns with his mind but
mostly stands around saying lame affirmations ("You must control your
rage, before your rage controls you."), and finally Invisible Boy
(Mitchell) who is only invisible when no one is looking.  With the
added bonus of some strange non lethal weapons by inventor Dr.  Heller
(Waits), they battle Casanova Frankenstein and his henchmen, and in
the end become a team.</P>
<P>    Mystery Men tries to do to Superman what Austin Powers does to
James Bond. The film looks at the silliness that traditionally
accompanies superhero stories and lampoons it. A discussion about
whether Captain Amazing is really a billionaire named Lance hinges on
the fact that Lance wears glasses while Captain Amazing doesn't. When
Mr. Furious mentions that Lance simply takes them off, The Shoveller
counters "but then he wouldn't be able to see!" Dr. Heller's gadgets
could easily be lamer replicas of the plethora of things on Batman's
utility belt. With a combination of Stiller, Garofalo and Reubens, you
can expect a lot of laughs. Each provides many chuckles, but the more
straight-laced cast members tend to hinder them a bit. A lot of the
humour is too intellectual, not really making you laugh, but making
you nod thinking "that's quite clever". A good example would be when
The Blue Raja explains the meaning of his name to someone; he goes on
about how the British government ran India way back when, with a
government called the Raj, and since he has a British accent, and was
born in India, voila, he is The Blue Raja. The film contains too much
of this style of humour; when Mr.  Furious says "I'm gonna go Pompeii
on your butt" a large portion of the audience really doesn't get it.
It's a bit like a Dennis Miller comedy monologue, you've got to think
to appreciate it.</P>
<P>    The large cast hinders things a bit, with some of the wannabe
superheroes (Invisible Boy) getting no good material at all. Tom Waits
is given nothing funny to do as Dr.  Heller. He just sits around
saying things like "my god, that's a positronic modulating
psychoblaster!"  Claire Forlani is thrown in as a pathetically
unneeded love interest for Mr. Furious. I would have liked to see more
screen time go to Casanova Frankenstein. Geoffrey Rush is hilarious as
the film's disco dancing/ German accented baddie.  He naturally plans
to destroy the entire city with a dastardly deed, in this case some
kind of giant laser weapon. He truly captures the film's irreverent
tone and provides some of the best laughs, its only too bad that his
accent is at times indecipherable. To writer Neil Cuthbert's credit,
there is one hilarious and unexpected plot twist in the film, and a
couple scenes that are magical.  When the superheroes encounter
Casanova in his limo and proceed to enjoy a brief, minor victory, the
laughs were so constant that my stomach hurt.</P>
<P>    This is a good way to kill a couple bucks on cheap night, but many
people who pay full price will consider their money wasted. I have a
feeling that Mystery Men will become a hit on video, becoming funnier
with each repeated viewing. Hopefully there will be a sequel, as the
potential of this cast and concept is huge.</P>
