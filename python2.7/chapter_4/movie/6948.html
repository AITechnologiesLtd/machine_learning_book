<PRE>                               FOOLS RUSH IN
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>This could have been just another lightweight bit of
romantic fluff.  Instead, the story has much more going for
it than most films of that genre and, aided by some fine
acting, turns this into a very entertaining romantic comedy.</P>
<P>Alex (Matthew Perry) is a nice-looking young executive type.
He meets up with Isabel (Salma Hayek) a stunningly beautiful
yet wholesome-looking Hispanic woman from Mexico and, after
a one night stand, Alex awakes to find Isabel has left him
without a word or forwarding address.    That is where their
relationship would have ended except that three months
later, Isabel shows up at Alex's place to inform him that he
is the father of the baby she has been carrying.</P>
<P>Isabel is a great believer in Fate.  Alex is a believer in
"doing the right thing."    Based on these two beliefs,
despite their backgrounds being very far apart (Alex is a
WASP and Isabel is a Catholic of Mexican heritage), there is
no question but that they must get married.    There are the
de rigueur meetings of each other's parents and family.  The
WASPs are unhappy (John Bennett Perry . . . Matthew's
real-life father and Jill Clayburgh as the mother).  On the
Hispanic side, there is Isabel's  very protective  father
(Tomas Milian) who still is angry that the U.S. confiscated
Mexican territory, and the mother (Anne Betancourt)  AND
Isabel's five brothers who are suspicious of Alex's
intentions. Also there is the unhappy policeman Chuy (Carlos
Gomez) who was once Isabel's fiance.</P>
<P>As in all romantic comedies, there is the boy meets girl,
boy loses girl, boy gets girl back for the inevitable happy
ending.   Here it is done with humor and charm and leaves
you with a nice feeling, wishing the adorable screen's
couple will live happily ever after.</P>
<PRE>Deftly directed by Andy Tennant.</PRE>
