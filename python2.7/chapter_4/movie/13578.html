<PRE>                            THE BIG HIT 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                     3 :-( :-( :-( for the big miss</PRE>
<P>Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Lou Diamond Phillips, Christina Applegate, Avery
Brooks, Lela Rochon, Bokeem Woodbine, China Chow, Lainie Kazan, Elliot
Gould
Director: Che-Kirk Wong
Producers: Warren Zide, Wesley Snipes
Screenplay: Ben Ramsey</P>
<P>Someone should have warned the producers of this movie, not to cast two
ex-Calvin Klein models and a Federation Starfleet Captain in the same
movie, under the direction of a Hong Kong action flick director. The end
result is a pretty big mess filled with smart mouthed, pretty boys
playing with guns, with little idea of where to put their heads and when
to put on their pants.</P>
<P>I'm referring to the dressing scene where Lou Diamond Phillips, Mark
Wahlberg and Antonio Sabato Jr., bare butts and skin for the world to
see. As if Mark Wahlberg's ending fiasco in BOOGIE NIGHTS, wasn't enough
to define what is not considered the norm for that particular male
appendage! One can feel male egos soar and testosterone drip as each
tries to show off how great they look and how firm their muscles are. If
there were to be a winner - Sabato Jr is undoubtedly the better model in
Kleins.</P>
<P>So where did this go wrong, except for the fact that they hired models
instead of actors? Well, Mark Wahlberg has started an annoying trend of
playing idiosyncratic ‘love-me, I'm so cute' roles (not as annoying as
David Schwimmer). I have to admit that the opening action scenes are
well choreographed and amongst the best this year. However, the rest of
the movie is tediously weighed down by a spineless Wahlberg, a slutty
(unintentional) Applegate, an overactive Diamond Phillips, a ‘pin me up'
Sabato Jr and a kidnapped Japanese girl.</P>
<P>The BIG HIT is a big mess and deserves a big miss.</P>
