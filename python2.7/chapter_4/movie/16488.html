The Avengers (1998) 1/2 star out of 4. Starring Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman
and Sean Connery.</PRE>
<P>While The Avengers television series was cheeky, stylish and sexy, its
big-screen descendant is listless, plodding and as steamy as a
brother-sister prom date.</P>
<P> After seeing this turkey, it's understandable why the studio decided to
keep it under wraps until the last possible moment.</P>
<P> It's a total misfire. The script is weak, the continuity choppy (probably
from slicing the film from its original two-hour length to about 95
minutes), and the actors seem to lack any concept of how to approach their
characters.</P>
<P> Ralph Fiennes hasn't a clue to the character of secret agent John Steed.
While he can act the veddy, veddy English gentleman, he lacks that slight
twinkle in the eye, that subtle wink that Patrick Macnee brought to the
role, letting us know that he, too, was in on the joke.</P>
<P> Uma Thurman works too hard at trying to be sexy, a feat that came almost
nonchalantly to Diana Rigg, the TV show's Mrs. Emma Peel. Unfortunately,
Thurman emits as much heat as a winter solstice.</P>
<P> The movie's biggest crime, however, is the utter waste of Sean Connery as
deranged villain Sir August De Wynter. It takes an awful script and shoddy
dialogue to make Connery look bad on screen. Can you even remember the last
time Connery was so cinematically embarrassed?</P>
<P> Basically, The Avengers stinks because director Jeremiah Checnik and
screenwriter Don Macpherson missed the point of the TV series. And because
of that, we all have to suffer.</P>
