<PRE>                                     JFK
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  This is Oliver Stone's biography and
     defense of New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison attempting to
     discredit the official explanation of the Kennedy
     assassination.  While not always convincing in it ambitious
     conclusions, it will cause people to question the Warren
     Report.  Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4)  (Minor spoilers in
     review)</P>
<P>     It is difficult to evaluate a propaganda film--that is, a film intended
to convince the viewer of a particular political point of view.  How
strongly do you weight your agreement with the political message?  How
strongly do you weigh whether the filmmaker played fairly and honestly?  How
strongly do you consider whether the film was convincing or not?  How
important are traditional values such as plot and technique?  Is Leni
Riefenstahl's TRIUMPH OF THE WILL a good film because of the beautiful
filmic technique or a bad film because it deified Adolf Hitler?  How good
were Einsenstein's BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN and ALEXANDER NEVSKY?  How good was Z
or MATEWAN or ROGER AND ME?  What about MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON or ALL
THE PRESIDENT'S MEN?  I take the amoral--hopefully not immoral--view that
what is important are traditional film values plus whether the film makes a
good argument.  I divorce myself from my own political viewpoint.  Nor will
I strongly consider if the filmmaker is being fair unless it hurts the
argument being made.  I would claim TRIUMPH OF THE WILL is much better
propaganda than television's M.A.S.H. in spite of the fact I agree much more
with M.A.S.H.'s politics.</P>
<P>     That stated, I can now begin to discuss Oliver Stone's JFK.  Is it a
good film from the traditional viewpoint?  It does hold the viewer's
attention and it does have some good performances, and some wooden ones
also.  Overall it is an enjoyable film.  Is it convincing?  That depends on
what you think it is trying to convince you of.  If it is trying to convince
the viewer that the Warren Commission's official explanation of what
happened is wrong, it succeeds beautifully.  It is difficult to believe that
earl Warren himself could see this film and not question his own
commission's findings.  On the other hand, the film darkly implies that this
might have been a huge governmental conspiracy--essentially a coup d'etat--
with the express goal of precipitating a war in Vietnam.  For this
conclusion the evidence is sketchy at best.  Jim Garrison and Oliver Stone
essentially show tens of thousands of people who had a motive to murder
Kennedy and a few people who might have been involved with pulling the
triggers.  There is not much connection in between.  That is where the film
falls down.</P>
<P>     JFK is structured as Kevin Costner, in the role of Jim Garrison,
presenting the Warren Commission's findings and knocking holes in them.
This is followed by a speech on the implications to American democracy of
the government's cover-up and these pieces are preceded by a docudrama
prologue that tells how Garrison got involved and what he discovered in his
investigations.  Of course, we see this prologue first, but the real heart
of the film is the rebuttal.</P>
<P>     The prologue does not really have much of a plot any more than ALL THE
PRESIDENT'S MEN did.  Instead, we just follow step by step the
investigation.  Other than the obvious dramatic impact of the puzzle getting
solved, there is a minor melodramatic sub-plot of Garrison alienating his
family and his staff over his monomaniacal approach.  This sub-plot is
superficially added and resolved just as superficially.  The detail of the
investigation is well told, though its impact depends a great deal on the
viewer's interest in revelations about the assassination.  Stone makes a
safe bet that most of the public, and certainly most who would come to see
the film, have a great deal of interest in the Kennedy assassination.  The
chase after information is at least as interesting as the similar chase in
ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.</P>
<P>     Kevin Costner brings a good deal of his Elliot Ness portrayal to his
Jim Garrison.  Sissy Spacek plays Mrs. Garrison exactly the way she played
the Southern housewife in THE LONG WALK HOME.  Joe Pesci is good playing one
more and different breed of low-life.  Edward Asner is notable as a gruff,
bullet-shaped, bigoted conspirator.  There are quite a few notables in the
cast, perhaps to make a political point.  Jim Garrison himself is along as
Earl Warren.</P>
<P>     As with many docudramas, JFK may not play exactly fair.  It mixes
together newsreel footage, fake newsreel footage, dramatization of events
that happened, dramatization of events that may have happened, dramatization
of events that did not happen but that improve the story, even mental images
and supposed memories.  This is, of course, a questionable strategy, but
with a little thought the viewer knows what is being shown.  It does shed
some question on some of the assertions made.</P>
<P>     This is a film that will change some minds and provoke argument.  73%
of Americans believe there was a conspiracy and that percentage is likely to
go up with this film.  I give it a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
