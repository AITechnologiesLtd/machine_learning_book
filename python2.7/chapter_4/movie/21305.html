<PRE>THE INSIDER
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In a picture that deserves to be remembered at Oscar time, THE INSIDER
tells a mesmerizing, true story that's in equal measure drama, thriller
and mystery.  Directed by Michael Mann (THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS) and
starring Russell Crowe (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL) and Al Pacino, all three of
whom should be nominated by the Academy, the film has your eyes glued to
the screen as it examines some universal truths about integrity and
risk.</P>
<P>With never a dull moment, the story still manages to take the time to
consider the entirety of people's lives and families and delve into the
minutia of a journalistic investigation.  The movie will and should be
compared favorably to the classic journalistic investigation story, ALL
THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.</P>
<P>Brilliantly scripted by Eric Roth, based on a magazine article by Marie
Brenner titled "The Man Who Knew Too Much," and containing a sterling
supporting cast, the movie has only one possible flaw -- it's longer
than normal at over two and a half hours.  Its length, however, turns
out to be both necessary and beneficial.  Any scene that looks like
cinematic fat will prove later to be a key to setting up other parts of
the story.  In most movies the characters have either a work life or a
home life, but not both.  This film takes the time to show both, and
their interactions prove essential to understanding the motivation of
the protagonists.</P>
<P>The story concerns one Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe), the former head of
research at Brown and Williamson Tobacco.  A proud man of high
integrity, Dr. Wigand has been fired by the company, who is scared that
he will break his confidentiality agreement and reveal certain hidden
truths about the company.</P>
<P>Michael Gambon does a deliciously sinister turn as Thomas Sandefur, the
CEO of Brown and Williamson and Dr. Wigand's direct boss.  Sandefur, who
testified with 6 other Big Tobacco executives before Congress that
tobacco is not addictive, takes an ostrich approach to facts that aren't
to his liking.  "You declare as a badge of honor that you don't even
know what makes water boil," Dr. Wigand ridicules him.</P>
<P>The whole situation is extremely complex as real life situations tend to
be.  Dr. Wigand does not want to do anything to jeopardize his severance
package and the medical insurance that the company has promised.  He has
2 beautiful young girls (Hallie Kate Eisenberg and Renee Olstead), whom
he adores, but one has asthma, which requires expensive medical care.
His trophy wife (Linda Hart) becomes chilly toward him as soon as his
income dries up and his troubles begin.</P>
<P>Meanwhile "60 Minutes" producer Lowell Bergman (Pacino) wants to get the
doctor on the show and have him interviewed by veteran journalist Mike
Wallace (Christopher Plummer).  Pacino is perfectly cast as the
hard-charging reporter who'll do anything so long as it doesn't
jeopardize his source.  Bergman is as tough and honest as they come.</P>
<P>Nearing retirement, Wallace comes across as possessing good intentions
but fatal flaws as he worries too often about "other considerations."
Chief among these considerations is that the tobacco companies, who
possess the most sophisticated and powerful attorneys on the face of the
earth, will bring down his entire company, CBS.  "History only remembers
what you did last," he laments.</P>
<P>As a slimy lawyer with possible conflicts of interests, Gina Gershon
plays CBS's lawyer, Helen Caperelli, who advises "60 Minutes" not to run
the Wigand segment lest the company end up losing a multi-billion dollar
law suit and being owned by Brown and Williamson.</P>
<P>While all of this fascinating corporate intrigue is going on, Dr.
Wigand's life is falling apart.  He's getting anonymous death threats,
he's being followed, and his life is crumbling all around him.  Crowe
with his physical mannerisms makes palpable the tenseness of the
situation.  Constantly adjusting his glasses, fiddling with his tie and
twitching his head, Dr. Wigand is a lonely man who is breaking under the
strain.</P>
<P>The suitably ominous but never overpowering music by Pieter Bourke and
Lisa Gerrard add immensely to the production.  Dante Spinotti's moody,
shadowy cinematography lends an ominous feeling of impending doom.</P>
<P>"I'm running out of heroes, man," Bergman tells Dr. Wigand.  "Guys like
you are in short supply."  The movie makes it obvious why.  Dr. Wigand
realizes, correctly, that to agree to be interviewed he has to be
willing to risk everything, literally everything, in his life.  If you
have a loving family and expensive possessions, would you be willing to
chance losing them all forever, just because your integrity demanded it?
For most of us it's not a tough call.  In reality, most of us would
pass.  It is for just that reason that this film, with its superlative
acting, becomes so engrossing.</P>
<P>THE INSIDER runs 2:37.  It is rated R for language and mature themes and
would be fine for teenagers.</P>
