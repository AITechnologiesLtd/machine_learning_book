<P>Synopsis:
As a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces, a
female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case.  If she
can survive the demanding S.E.A.L. training, she will open the way for
other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps.  Throw in a lot
of political machinations, sabotage, brutality, water and sand and you
have an entertaining movie.</P>
<P>Review:
The title of this movie turned me off at first.  I mean 'GI Jane?'????? 
The other titles which were considered were more promising - In Pursuit
of Honor or A Matter of Honor would have been acceptable although Navy
Cross or Undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as I'm concerned.</P>
<P>I went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those
people who thinks that Demi Moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor.  To
my surprise I really enjoyed the movie.  Moore as Lieutenant Jordan
O'Neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty
woman in A Few Good Men. </P>
<P>The storyline is simple.  Anne Bancroft playing Senator Lillian Dehaven
is a ruthless, machiavellian politician with an agenda to push.  Using
feminism to achieve political mileage, she forces the military powers
that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive
Navy S.E.A.L. training.  Jordan is selected due to the fact that she has
it all - looks, brains and strength.</P>
<P>The training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch. 
Nonetheless, it's one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out
and encourage the hapless hero/heroine along in his/her endeavours. 
Sure, there are the stereotypical elements - inhuman treatment, sexual
innuendo, resentful peers, pained boyfriend and sexist commanding
officer.  Stepping away from the stereotypes though, Viggo Mortensen as
Master Chief John Urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than
a brutal screamer.  His character exercises a little more intellectual
rigour than you would normally expect from such a character.</P>
<P>Jordan's boyfriend Royce is also in the military.  Although they both
started at the same time, due to the fact that he has seen active
service, he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she
has.  Royce (what is his surname? Do we care?) almost resents Jordan's
attempts to advance herself, although he quickly settles down to being
doe-eyed and supportive.  His character seems to have been thrown in so
that we know that you don't have to be a lesbian to want to be in the
military.</P>
<P>In parts, this is a very silly movie, with gratuitous lines and scenes
thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that
it's hard not to cringe.  I still liked it though.  Weaknesses in the
script aside, this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood.
As we watch Jordan's battle, it's increasingly clear that it is a
personal battle.  This is an individual's fight for self-advancement. 
We don't have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings, we
don't have to feel uncomfortable because we're having ideology thrust
down our throats.  It's enough that we can sit back and hope that this
one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and
determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women
should go into combat or not.</P>
