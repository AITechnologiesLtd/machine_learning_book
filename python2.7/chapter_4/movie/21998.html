<P>Hollywood never fails to astound me. Every time I think those coked-up
little buggers have hit rock bottom; they come up with a new
excavating tool. I was truly convinced that "Wild Wild West" marked
1999 studio filmmaking at its most hapless, but then along comes "End
of Days" to prove me wrong. This big budget, brain dead apocalyptic
thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music, grisly
violence, explosions galore and lots of cheesy special effects. The
result? Nothing but groans and yawns. Even the Devil himself is unable
to produce a decent scare in this festival of the inept. At the very
least, "End of Days" should have done us the courtesy of being
bad-enough-to-be-good, but it can't even manage that. It's just lousy.</P>
<P>Arnold Schwarzenegger, still recovering from heart problems and
"Batman & Robin," plays an ex-cop turned security agent or bodyguard
or something. Along with his obligatory comic relief partner (Kevin
Pollak, impersonating Matthew Perry's Chandler character from
"Friends"), he gets involved in some major league supernatural
hoodoo. It seems that Satan (Gabriel Byrne) gets a shot at world
domination only once every thousand years (and here I thought he'd
pulled it off with the Republican landslide of '94). If he has sex
with 20-year old Christine York (Robin Tunney), "the Chosen One,"
their child will be the Antichrist, or at least a brat.</P>
<P>Ah, but this deal has more catches than a New Year's Eve pass from a
Halfway House. The unholy union must take place on December 31, 1999
(you see, 999 is just 666 turned upside down), but only between 11
p.m. and Midnight (no wonder this guy is so cranky). And if the Chosen
One is given refuge in a church, the devil won't know where she is,
because he can't see into the sanctuary. You know, it's kind of like
Superman's X-ray vision and lead walls, only evil.</P>
<P>A group of guerrilla Catholic priests decide the best way to stop the
situation is by killing the girl. Arnold chooses to save the girl and
kick the hell out of Satan, if you'll pardon the expression. And Kevin
meets up with an exploding van and has to make some decisions of his
own. Oh, the anguish! Oh, the humanity! Oh, the writing!</P>
<P>Andrew W. Marlowe's screenplay ladles implausibility upon
implausibility, from the preposterous otherworldly histrionics to his
handling of Jericho Cane, Schwarzenegger's character. Cane starts the
film a la Mel Gibson in the first "Lethal Weapon," preparing to put a
gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the murder of his
wife and daughter. Twenty minutes later, he's racing through the
bowels of New York City, deciphering clues that Sherlock Holmes and
Kreskin would find baffling.</P>
<P>When Cane meets up with Christine York, he instantly switches to
Terminator father figure mode, with the young woman serving as
surrogate daughter. In case anyone misses the connection, the camera
comes in for a close up of Christine's music box, which just happens
to be identical to one owned by Cane's daughter. Subtle, Marlowe,
subtle.</P>
<P>Speaking of cameras, director Peter Hyams is just the man to take
Marlowe's script and make it even more self-important, murky and
annoying. Hyams' direction shows all the subtlety of a Gwar video,
with Cane running a gauntlet of ridiculous action set pieces,
punctuated with loads of big explosions. Eager to satisfy Arnold's
core audience, he even throws in a few pairs of breasts as well. What
a guy.</P>
<P>Had the film delivered some decent scares, or even maintained a
consistently ominous tone, the bombastic clichés might have been
tolerable, but "End of Days" is simply a flaccid special effects
show. The cast is just as ineffective. In his early scenes, Gabriel
Byrne attempts to invest Beelzebub with some panache, but he all too
soon turns into just another standard issue monster. Kevin Pollak
comes and goes quickly, Robin Tunney comes off like a bargain basement
Winona Ryder and as for Arnold, well … he's a better actor than
Casper Van Dien. That should count for something.</P>
<P>Way back in the aftermath "The Exorcist" and "The Omen," supernatural
swill like "End of Days" might have passed muster as a B-movie. But
that was then and this is now. "The X-Files" and "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer" deliver real scares on a weekly basis and, if we want to see
the Devil, all we have to do is flip on "The 700 Club" and take a
gander at Pat Robertson's grinning maw. After enduring "End of Days,"
all I can say is "Get thee behind me, Satan. And while you're at it,
get thee a better agent as well."</P>
