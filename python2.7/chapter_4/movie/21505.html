<P>You know John Malkovich. He's the darkly compelling actor with
awkward features who graced the screen in films such as `Dangerous
Liaisons', `Of Mice And Men' and `In The Line Of Fire'.
Few would deny that he is one of America's most underappreciated
actors, yet even fewer would think him a good subject for a fictional
feature film. However, with the weird and wildly original `Being
John Malkovich', director Spike (`You Mean The Little Cubes You
Put In Hot Water To Make Soup?') Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman
have proven to be part of that minority.</P>
<P>The word quirky doesn't even begin to describe the eccentricity
that is `Being John Malkovich'.  John Cusack plays Craig
Schwartz, an unemployed puppeteer who, after being urged by his homely
wife, Lottie (Cameron Diaz), gets a job as a filing clerk at a company
called LesterCorp.</P>
<P>You see, LesterCorp. is on the 7 1/2 floor of an office building in
New York City, which means that you can't stand up in your office,
and that it takes some precise planning to get there by elevator. On
the 7 1/2 floor, he meets Maxine (Catherine Keener), a beautiful woman
who isn't interested in him.  On the 7 1/2 floor, he meets Lester
(Orson Bean), his boss who claims to be over 100 years old.  And on
the 7 1/2 floor, he finds a portal that allows you to spend 15 minutes
in John Malkovich's brain before ejecting you into a ditch on the
New Jersey Turnpike. No joke.</P>
<P>`Being John Malkovich' may sound weird so far, but believe me,
things do get weirder. The `love triangle' involving Craig,
Lottie, Maxine and John Malkovich is perhaps the oddest relationship
ever put to film. And yes, Cameron Diaz does get locked up in a cage
with a monkey and scream `you're ruining my actualization as a
man!'</P>
<P>John Malkovich is a wonder. As himself, he gives one of his edgiest
performances to date, and certainly his most accurate. In the film, we
see a self deprecating Malkovich reading the Wall Street Journal,
notifying a cab driver that he never played an art thief, and trying
to seduce an obsessed fan.</P>
<P>Director Spike Jonze, who directed the video for Weezer's `Buddy
Holly' as well as starring in `Three Kings', has come out of
nowhere to help create the year's most original comedy. With a taut
and clever script by Charlie Kaufman, and a uniformly excellent
ensemble cast, `Being John Malkovich' stands out as a distinct
work of modern art.</P>
<P>It's hard to write a coherent review about a film this
dazzling. `Being John Malkovich' is a mind boggling head trip
that proves that independent spirit still exists in the world of
mainstream filmmaking. Without giving away anything more about it, let
me say that this film is truly one to seek out. A dark comedy classic.</P>
