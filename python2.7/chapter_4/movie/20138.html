<P>IN DREAMS (M).  
(Paramount/Dreamworks)
Director: Neil Jordan
Stars: Annette bening, Robert Downey jr, Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea, Paul 
Guilfoyle, Margo Martindale, Dennis Boutsikaris.</P>
<P>The best films from director Neil Jordan are those set in his
native Ireland (The Crying Game, Michael Collins, etc), while his big
budget Hollywood entertainments (We're No Angels, etc) are bland and
disappointing.  His latest film In Dreams falls into this latter
category.  Co-written by Bruce Robinson (the cult classic Withnail And
I, The Killing Fields, etc) this bleak psychological thriller is
adapted from the book by Bari Wood (who wrote the novel upon which
David Cronenberg's creepy Dead Ringers was based).</P>
<P>The tormented heroine of the piece is Claire Cooper (Annette
Bening), who writes and illustrates fairy tale books for a living.
She is having terrible dreams and nightmares, most of them featuring a
young boy in a room filling with water.  It seems she has established
a psychic connection with serial nutcase psychopath Vivian (Robert
Downey jr), and witnesses some particularly gruesome murders.  The
only trouble is that no-one, including the local cops and her
frequently absent airline pilot husband (Aidan Quinn, in a thankless
role), will believe her.</P>
<P>When her own daughter becomes the killer's latest victim,
Claire has a nervous breakdown and is institutionalised.  It becomes
apparent to Claire that the killer is deliberately passing messages to
her, and she feels compelled to escape from prison and track him down
to end her traumatic experience.  But her dreams increasingly become
blurred with reality.</P>
<P>Jordan deftly establishes an unsettling atmosphere that is
reminiscent of far better thrillers (Don't Look Now, etc), but In
Dreams is ultimately disappointing.  This sort of thing has been done
before (e.g.; The Eyes Of Laura Mars, etc), but unfortunately the
potentially fascinating scenario is never quite convincing.</P>
<P>Jordan borrows much of the film's dark and forbidding
structure from the very fairy tales that Claire illustrates.  Jordan
also imbues the film with plenty of surreal imagery and rich
symbolism, particularly focusing on the colour red and apples, but it
all becomes too messy and obscure.  However, ace cinematographer
Darius Khondji (Seven, etc) creates some memorable and evocative
images.</P>
<P>Bening's performance has a nicely hysterical and over wrought
edge that suits the grim mood of the material.  There is a nicely
ironic touch to the casting of Downey, especially given his recent
legal troubles and his confessions to the tabloids, but he gives a
performance that is enigmatic rather than malevolent and genuinely
unnerving.  Regular Jordan collaborator Stephen Rea is wasted in a
stereotypical role as the haunted looking and sympathetic psychiatrist
who tries to puzzle out the true meaning of Claire's strange dreams.</P>
<P>In Dreams leaves a nasty aftertaste in the mouth, and will
have audiences feeling vaguely unsatisfied.</P>
