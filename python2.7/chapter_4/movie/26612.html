<P>There comes a time in every Chick's life when she has an epiphany so
mind-blowing, it forever alters her life, causing her to grow up far
quicker than she expected to, and making well-done hamburger patties out
of her Sacred Cows.</P>
<P>My time came Sunday, with the realization that Bruce Lee isn't the
greatest martial artist the movie world has ever seen.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
THE LEGEND OF DRUNKEN MASTER humorously tells the story of Chinese folk
legend Wong Fei-Hung (Jackie Chan), young master of the "Drunken Boxing"
kung fu style of martial arts.</P>
<P>In this almost plot-overloaded movie, Wong Fei-Hung and his hapless
brother Cho (Lau Ka Leung), travel by train with their father, Dr. Wong
Kei-Ying (Ti Lung), bringing medical supplies back to their home.  Part
of their supplies - some medicinal ginseng - gets mixed up in the
baggage of the Ambassador (Ken Lo), leading to a struggle between
Fei-Hung and a mysterious old man, Tsan (Felix Wong) over the package.
The struggle gets especially interesting when Fei-Hung tries to impress
Tsan with his Drunken Boxing style of kung fu (which he doesn't do
nearly as well when he's *not* drunk).</P>
<P>Wong also has comical misunderstandings with his father, who doesn't
want Fei-Hung to either fight *or* drink - both of which, of course,
Fei-Hung does in abundance; with his mother, Madame Wong (Anita "Lucy
Ricardo, reincarnated" Mui); and with friendly rival Ching Ho Sang (Chin
Kar Lok), who spars with Fei-Hung for the attention of the lovely Fong
(Wing-Fong Ho).  Fei-Hung and his Folks face epic battles with the
Ambassador (who has the fastest kicks I've ever seen), his minion Henry
(Ho Sung Pak), and a rather hot bed of coals.</P>
<P>Sober, Fei-Hung is good; but to do Drunken Boxing the way it needs to be
done, he has to get good and toasted, which he does on more than one
occasion.  And what commences are some of the outright funniest skits
and amazing martial arts scenes I've ever seen in one movie.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Ok, so maybe I exaggerated a wee bit; maybe Chan didn't exactly Rock My
World, but he did shake the foundations a bit.  It really was quite
eye-opening to see just how Bad the man is - and in a relatively
unpolished, six-year-old movie, no less!</P>
<P>To some, the plot of a martial arts movie is like the plot of a porn
flick: most people don't bother paying attention to the words; they just
want to get to the Action [the same has been said about Black "booty
call" comedies, so don't Trip over the analogy].  Which goes to show you
how warped we westerners can be sometimes - because the plot was
well-developed in "Legend".  Still, I won't lie; I got lost in the
backstory with the English Overlord (I think that's what he was supposed
to be), to the point where I totally dismissed him whenever he came
on-screen.  I imagine part of my confusion comes from the fact that I
haven't seen the film "Legend" is a sequel to - 1978's DRUNKEN MASTER -
and thus don't fully know who's who within Fei-Hung's circle of friends
and enemies.  I'm fairly sure that I got some of the names mixed up in
"The Story" above, unfortunately.</P>
<P>But the point remains: this movie was a lot more than the "chop socky"
so often dismissed when we see a "Karate Flick".  Sure, the kung fu was
there at base, and rightly so (I'd pay to see those scenes by
themselves, especially the final battle; it was that good).  But the
humor was *strong* - especially with Anita Mui; I swear I cracked a rib
on her account! - and I even found myself crying with sadness when
Fei-Hung got chewed out by his father.  Add some interesting cultural
references on top of that, and you have yourself a well-rounded movie.
Granted, it's no CITIZEN KANE; but could Kane drink like a fish and then
kick serious butt?   Thought not!</P>
<P>It's funny: I was just telling some friends about how much I enjoyed the
DVD release of SHANGHAI NOON, a Jackie Chan east-meets-west flick I
reviewed earlier this year.  Besides the great DVD features available in
this cut, Chan's trademark outtakes and behind-the-scenes bits show the
true measure of his technical and cinematic skills.  But who knew it
would take a six-year-old flick like "Legends" to finally make me bow to
the master?</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
I have never, ever, laughed harder, or damn near cried my eyes out, at
"just a karate flick", the way I did during "Legend".  Bruce Lee was
baaad, no doubt; but Jackie Chan is The Man.  Chan has stood the test of
time, and *still* comes out swinging.  Sit down, Steven Segal; take a
hike, Jean Claude Van Damme.  Check out this older Jackie Chan flick,
and see what Legends truly are made of.</P>
<P>THE LEGEND OF DRUNKEN MASTER (rating: greenlight):
I still love me some Bruce Lee, and I always will.  But the king is
dead: long live King Jackie.</P>
