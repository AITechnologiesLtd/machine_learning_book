A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Barbet Schroeder</PRE>
<P>Written by: Henry Bean, Neal Jimenez, David Klass</P>
<P>Ingredients:
cop who needs the bone marrow of a ruthless criminal for his leukemia
victim son, vicious violent bad guy who'll do anything to escape</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Frank (Andy Garcia) is a widowed cop whose 9-year-old son (Joseph Cross)
is dying of leukemia. Frank is so desperate to save his son that in the
opening scene of the movie, he breaks into a government computer and
searches for possible bone marrow donors. Unfortunately, he finds only
one match: an incarcerated killer and dangerous genius named McCabe
(Michael Keaton), who is desperate to escape from jail. As the bone
marrow transfusion operation is about to begin, McCabe suddenly and
ingeniously escapes. Because Frank must keep McCabe alive in order to
have the transfusion to save his son, Frank finds himself at odds with
the police, who have orders to shoot to kill. Eventually, both Frank and
McCabe are fugitives from the law, but while evading capture Frank must
somehow capture McCabe and bring him in alive in order to proceed with
the life-saving operation.</P>
<P>Opinion:
I like the premise of this movie, the idea that a desperate cop can be
just as immoral as a desperate criminal. The acting is good. Andy Garcia
fleshes out the cop character nicely, while Michael Keaton does a
particularly good job as Peter McCabe, a criminal character who is
almost as dangerous and intelligent as the character Dr. Hannibal Lecter
of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. </P>
<P>On the other hand, the movie seems contrived and predictable. Once
McCabe escapes from surgery, he doesn't do what any normal red-blooded
American criminal would do - - that is, get the heck out of there.
Inexplicably, he hangs around the hospital to harass the cop, the kid,
the kid's doctor for almost the whole length of the movie. </P>
<P>In addition, good guys seem to bump into each other and pass along
information a little too conveniently. In one scene, as Frank is hiding
next to an elevator, Dr. Samantha Hawkins conveniently runs into him - -
and from nowhere, she produces Frank's lost gun and hands it to Frank as
if it were the most natural event in the world. Another time, when Doc
and Frank need to pass information to each other, by pure coincidence
she happens to be standing next to a window which just happens to be
right next to Frank who is standing outside on catwalk! This all just
seems a little too contrived to me. </P>
<P>Since DESPERATE MEASURES is essentially a 'chase' movie, it also
contains many gun battles, scenes of running, speeding cars, and
explosions. Unfortunately, all of the action and running around takes
place inside the hospital, until McCabe pops out for an obligatory car
chase ending. </P>
<PRE>Trivia:
