<PRE>`The Talented Mr. Ripley' Shows Promise but Ultimately
Disappoints
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>If you've seen or heard some of the nominations from
various film critic societies around the country, then
you probably know that this movie has been mentioned
for a couple of reasons.  Many applaud the gorgeous
cinematography and the strong performances of the
cast.  Even within my esteemed group of online film
critics (The Online Film Critics Society), there is
general agreement that `Mr. Ripley' should be
remembered when Oscar nominations are announced.  Yet,
while the buzz surrounding this film is generally
good, I'm actually puzzled as to why this film is
getting so much praise.  My feelings for this film are
decidedly mixed, although it's one of the best-looking
average movies I've seen this year.</P>
<P>Mr. Ripley of the title is Thomas Ripley (Damon), a
person who seems to be skilled in many areas although
he works as a bathroom attendant.  For example, he can
speak in other people's voices with alarming accuracy.
 And, he's a pretty good pianist.  After a particular
recital, a man approaches him.  The man sees that
Ripley is wearing a Princeton-emblazoned jacket.  He
asks if he graduated from Princeton and if he knows
his son, Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), since they are
the same age.  Of course he is just a lowly attendant
and the jacket is borrowed, but to hide his true
identity, he says yes.   The man, who is a shipping
magnate, hires Ripley to travel to Italy where Dickie
currently lives.  His task is to convince him to come
home.</P>
<P>Dickie is quite a character.  He has tons of charisma,
which is in part to his good looks, his elite taste,
and his wealth as the son of a shipping magnate. 
Dickie's world is tremendously lavish.  He has a
terrific, hilltop bungalow.  He spends his afternoons
on his sailboat.  And he frequents the best clubs in
town.  Ripley arrives and manages to successfully
blend into Dickie's life and meet some of Dickie's
friends.  These include fiancée Marge (Gwyneth
Paltrow) and, a well-connected partygoer (Phillip
Seymour Hoffman).  Up this point, which is about 45
minutes into the movie, I am really enjoying how
Dickie's and Ripley's friendship are evolving.  But
all of a sudden, Dickie and Ripley don't see
eye-to-eye anymore.  Dickie becomes bored with Ripley.
 And Ripley doesn't want to give up this newly
acquired lifestyle.  At about this point, the film
moves away from being a glossy drama, and becomes
decidedly dark and inexplicably bloody.  It was as if
the film started out in one direction, and then made a
sharp right turn.  </P>
<P>Any praise for this film should be directed at Damon's
nice performance and the terrific cinematography.  The
film takes place in wonderful locations throughout
Italy.  The camera skillfully catches the romance and
beauty of beach towns, the awesome architecture of
Rome, and the quaintness of other small villages.  It
was certainly enough to make me want to visit Italy
sometime in the future.  Every scene is handsomely
shot while the sets are opulent, and certainly would
make many of us envy the Dickie Greenleaf lifestyle. 
But despite all that it strives to be, the beauty of
the film was only skin deep.  </P>
<P>As I left the theatre, I was reminded of a recent film
called `A Perfect Murder.'  Ironically, it also
starred Gwyneth Paltrow as a distressed woman who
suspects that foul play is in the air.  That
production was undeniably glossy, and the performances
were solid.  But, it felt oddly empty.  `Mr. Ripley'
is slightly glossier and has slightly better
all-around performances.  Yet, it still felt oddly
unsatisfying.  I think that the problem is that once
the film abruptly changes direction, the audience's
expectations have been ruined.  And that's too bad,
because the outset of the film oozed with potential.</P>
