ROAD TRIP</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Todd Phillips
Written by: Todd Phillips, Scot Armstrong</PRE>
<P>Barry (Tom Green) has been a student at Ithica University for eight
years.  Today, he is leading a tour group around the campus and
displaying his lack of any knowledge about his school. In order to
keep his audience entertained he must tell a story about the bizarre
events surrounding a road trip taken by his best friend, Josh Porter
(Breckin Meyer). Josh has been dating Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) since
he was about ten years old, and they have maintained their
relationship even though they go to different colleges.  However, when
he suspects Tiffany is cheating on him, he decides to pursue Beth (Amy
Smart), a girl he has had his eye on for some time. Beth is a willing
participant, and the two create a home video of their first time
together. Unfortunately, Josh finds that Tiffany has not been cheating
on him, and his friend Rubin (Paulo Costanzo) has accidentaly mailed
the tape to Tiffany. Josh, Rubin, and two other friends, E.L. (Seann
William Scott) and Kyle (DJ Qualls), now must get to Tiffany's college
before the tape reaches her, and she finds out about Josh's
infidelity.</P>
<P>At long last, a film in the tradition of 1978's "Animal House" has
reached theaters. "Road Trip" is the kind of raunchy, hysterical, at
times disgusting comedy that "American Pie" wanted to be. A warning to
everyone: if you don't like your humor as obscene and revolting as is
humanly possible, stay away from this movie. Some of the film's more
abhorent parts include a scene where Kyle eats a piece of French toast
that has been through a journey no food should go through. This is the
kind of humor which will make you either cringe away from the screen
in disgust, or cringe from the scene while laughing hysterically. In
fact, you will probably react to the entire movie in one of these two
ways.  Most of you have, no doubt, seen the film's previews in which
Tom Green (The Tom Green Show) sticks a live rat in his mouth to
encourage a snake to eat its dinner. This scene would already be quite
funny; but Green is such an insane looking actor that he makes you
believe he might actually eat that rat on camera. Again, if you don't
find the thought of that scene at all amusing, stay away from this
movie.</P>
<P>The acting in a movie like "Road Trip" isn't particularly important
since the actors are only present to have disgusting things happen to
them. I was pleasantly surprised to find that most of the film's cast
members possess some wonderful comic timing. Tom Green isn't actually
given a very significant role in the film, as he is only present in
short scenes.  Breckin Meyer ("Go") does a great job as the one fairly
normal guy in the film.  Amy Smart ("Varsity Blues") gives a
wonderfully frantic performance, spending most of the film traveling
from college to college, trying to track down Josh and figure out why
he suddenly left her. The two best performances come from Seann
William Scott ("American Pie") and newcomer DJ Qualls. Scott gives a
wonderful, over-the-top performance, playing the most psychotic member
of the road trip party. His best scene involves him aquiring the group
some new transportation from a blind woman. DJ Qualls is a rather
unique looking actor. He looks to be over six feet tall, and appears
to weigh less than one hundred pounds. The entire movie is almost
worthwhile just for a hilariously revolting scene in which he is with
a girl for the first time.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, "Road Trip" certainly isn't without its
weaknesses. While it may be hilarious for the majority of its running
time, it starts to lag a bit by the end. Things also get a bit too
serious and sentimental towards the end. Points like college kids
trying to live up to their parents expectations, and the difficulties
of college students finding their ways in life are suddenly brought up
in a movie where such messages don't really fit in. Thankfully, Todd
Phillips (who also produced the Norm MacDonald vehicle, "Screwed")
pulls things back together for the last ten minutes, and the movie
ends on a suitably funny and irreverent note. Watch for amusing cameos
by Fred Ward ("Tremors") as Kyle's father and Andy Dick (television's
"News Radio") as a motel clerk, who needs some serious lessons in
customer relations. I'd recommend "Road Trip" to anyone who loved and
misses movies like "Animal House", and to fans of Tom Green. Despite a
relatively small part, he provides some of the film's funniest
moments. The movie runs 91 minutes, and I give it a well earned four
out of five stars.</P>
