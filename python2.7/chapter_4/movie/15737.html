<PRE>THE EMERALD FOREST
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>Many predict that the biggest political issues of next
century would be in the domain of ecology. Some of those
trends can be observed even today, with the environmentalist
movements gaining strength all over the globe, and even
coming to power in countries like Germany. However, in
1980s, care for the environment and long term interests of
humanity didn't look that attractive or important during the
reign of neo-conservative ideology, new Cold War and extreme
materialism. In the beginning of 1990s things changed -
environmentalism became fashionable in the era of emerging
"political correctness" so Hollywood tried to cash in. The
results were mixed, somewhere between disasters
(WATERWORLD), solid but overhyped epics (DANCES WITH WOLVES)
and interesting failures (THE MEDICINE MAN). Unfortunately,
that trend came too late for a movie that could have put all
of them to shame - THE EMERALD FOREST, ecological adventure
by John Boorman, made in 1985.</P>
<P>The plot of the movie is allegedly inspired by a true story.
Bill Markham (Powers Boothe) is an American engineer working
on the great dam project in the middle of Amazon jungle. One
day he brings his family to the building site, but that
little trip ends with his little son Tommy wandering in the
forest. There he gets abducted by Indian tribe known as
"Invisible People". For the next ten years, Bill spends
every spare moment to search for his son in the Amazon.
Unfortunately, the "Invisible People" are one of those
tribes that haven't got any contact with the outside world.
But that doesn't bother Tommy (Charly Boorman), who was
adopted by tribal chief Wanadi (Rui Polonah) and became
member of the tribe himself. When Bill finally meets him,
Tommy had already forgotten his parents and "civilised" way
of life. He seems happy with his life so he decides not to
listen to father's pleas for the return to civilisation.
Father and son part again, but not for the last time.
Village of the "Invisible People" gets attacked by the rival
tribe of "Fierce People" who take away all the women,
including Tommy's wife Kachiri (Dira Paes) and sell them to
the sleazy brothel owners at the outskirts of jungle. Unable
to fight guns with bows and spears, Tommy must seek his
father's help, which brings him to dangerous journey to the
heart of civilisation.</P>
<P>Unlike most ecological movies, that either try to shove the
environmentalist agenda to the viewers' throats or, even
worse, use ecology as cheap excuse for lame action/thriller
plots, THE EMERALD FOREST was very subtle. That shouldn't
surprise anyone, because the movie author, John Boorman,
liked nature, its beauty and dangers, long before the
environmental trends became fashionable. So, the tone of the
movie isn't preachy - the script by Rosco Pallemberg was set
in a virgin Amazon jungle threatened by an encroaching
civilisation, but Boorman was less interested in conflict
between nature and progress than in splendid opportunity to
make very personal film - classical adventure that is almost
impossible to imagine in Hollywood these days. Boorman
obviously liked what he was doing, because he chose his
teenage son Charley to play Tommy; that choice was good,
because that boy was perfect as lead character who
symbolises the innocence of the Amazon and the natural state
of man. His green eyes and innocent beauty corresponds with
the the innocent beauty of the rain forests. The nominal
lead, Powers Boothe, is shadowed by him, same as Meg Foster
as his mother, cast more because of her green eyes than
acting ability. Perhaps because of Boothe, the conflict
between the father and son wasn't as powerful and
interesting as it should have been.</P>
<P>The opportunity to have some father/son drama with cultural
clash themes, wasn't used in the first part, but some of the
script problems are more visible in the second. Boorman was
forced to admit that the Amazon jungle isn't that
all-friendly and blissful place, although Tommy and
"Invisible People" might see it that way. So, someone had to
represent the bad side of the Amazon, and that role was
filled by the tribe of "Fierce People" - whose villainy
might remind people of the native characters seen in the
classic Tarzan films (they are even painted black only to
illustrate their allignment). The "two tribe" concept wasn't
that simplistic, though; it is implied that the civilisation
stripped away the forest that used to be the hunting ground
for the "Fierce People", thus forcing them to go to war with
other people. However, the evil of the "Fierce People" is
underlined with the way they accept civilisation - unlike
noble and purist "Invisible People" who see white men as
"Termite People" (who eat away their world) and whose vision
of "Termite People" world is frightening (as witnessed by
Tommy in his short trip to Bill's city), they are ready to
accept the civilisation - first guns, than liquor -
corrupting and degrading themselves in the process.</P>
<P>Boorman brings film to the climax with the showdown in the
brothel, thus providing the audience with the standard
action scenes. But, instead of ending film immediately after
that, with the bitter-sweet note (Bill warns that the
civilisation would win in the end), Boorman provides the
audience with implausible fairy tale finale - Indian prayers
bring the flood that would take away the dam as the symbol
of the civilisation. But that scene is made even more
implausible with the addition of Bill who tries to blow up
his life's work in the process. The ending - Tommy, Kachiri
and his friends living happily ever after in a natural
paradise - is bad contrast with the end credits, that warn
the audience about sad reality of the Amazon - destruction
of the rain forests and silent genocide of the Indians.</P>
<P>However, despite all those flaws, THE EMERALD FOREST is not
beautiful and entertaining, but also a thought-provoking
film - one of those who were right on the spot with many
burning issues of today's world.</P>
