<PRE>BOUNCE
A film review by James Brundage

<P>Great.  Here I am, writing a review of yet another cheesy, clichéd, Ben
Affleck romantic comedy in which I will probably be flamed by Affleck
fans, Paltrow fans, romantics, teens, and widows.  Yeah… widows.  Why? 
Because Bounce is the latest in a string of contrived romantic comedies
to feature a man falling for a widow whom he helped to make a widow.</P>
<P>Yeah… it's our old friends Bob and Harvey Weinstein, and this time
they're capitalizing on plane crashes, public relations companies,
alcoholics, and stalkers all in the same wicked stroke.  Here we have
Buddy Amaral (Affleck), just a good-old sweet talking ad rep who happens
to give a free first class plane ticket to a guy named Greg (Tony
Goldwyn) in order to sleep with Mimi (Natasha Henstridge… really, who
wouldn't go for that)?  Of course, the plane crashes, and, wouldn't you
know it, he happens to rep the airlines.  So he does what any person
would: He drinks.</P>
<P>Cut to a year later, and Buddy's out of rehab and decides to take Step 8
(Contact those you have wronged and make amends) a little too seriously,
and he begins following the widowed Abby (Gwyneth Paltrow), the former
wife of Greg.  Finding out that she's a realtor, he fixes it so he rips
his own business off to the tune of $100,000, making herself a double
commission to boot.  Grateful as she is, she buys a couple of Dodgers
tickets and the two head down the eventless path towards true bliss.</P>
<P>If this plot thrills you, or makes you coo, "Ah, how sweet," then please
go see Bounce.  Now.  I'm sure you'll enjoy the paint-by-numbers
romance.  But let's face it, this is not exactly a great flick.  In
fact, it's downright terrible.  In fact, the idea of being romanced by
an alcoholic stalker named Buddy is a little more Silence of the Lambs
than Sliding Doors.  Writer-director Don Roos's last project, The
Opposite of Sex, was one of the most honest films about homosexual
stereotypes in recent years.  And I'll give him the benefit of the doubt
that he was trying to address issues of honesty and grieving, but this
time he crashes and burns like the plush 747 O'Hare red-eye that makes a
fiery farewell.</P>
<P>The performances are weak, the script couldn't hold up a toddler, and
the emotional value is slightly above that of a couple of Valium. 
Sorry, Gwen and Ben, but even that oh-so-cute non-romance we read about
at checkout lines daily can't salvage this wreck.</P>
