Susan Granger's review of "LOSER" (Columbia Pictures)</PRE>
<P> Give credit for honesty in advertising: the title becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy, as writer- director Amy Heckerling lifts
elements from the brilliant Billy Wilder film, "The Apartment" and
transfers them to college students in New York City.  Jason Biggs
("American Pie") plays an earnest, shy scholarship student from a
small upstate town. In his plaid hunter's cap with his kind,
good-natured personality, he doesn't fit in with the big-city
pseudo-sophisticates, particularly his odious, rich roommates (Thomas
Sadoski, Zak Orth, Jimmi Simpson) - but he's not a really a
loser. Escaping from dorm life, he finds refuge in a downtown
veterinary clinic, where he falls for another penniless student, Mena
Suvari (the rose-petal fantasy of "American Beauty"), whom he rescues
from an overdose of a date-rape drug. She works as a waitress in a
strip club and is having an affair with their cynical English lit
professor, Greg Kinnear ("As Good As It Gets"), who's more into
manipulation than marriage. Do the hero and heroine finally fall in
love? You guess. Perhaps the most idiotic moment occurs when Kinnear
says: "I'm sure if she were alive, Betty Friedan would applaud your
epiphany." It's a line that may stun the very-much-alive feminist,
Ms. Friedan. Misspelling "financial aid" as "aide" is another
blooper. The message is supposed to be: trust yourself, take a chance
and turn your back on people who take advantage of you - but the
cinematic sizzle just isn't there. There are cameos from Steven
Wright, David Spade, Andy Dick, Andrea Martin and Everclear, plus a
trendy soundtrack filled with '90s hits. On the Granger Movie Gauge of
1 to 10, "Loser" is a tepid, lackluster 4. If you want to see good Amy
Heckerling teenage romantic comedies, rent "Clueless" and "Fast Times
at Ridgemont High."</P>
