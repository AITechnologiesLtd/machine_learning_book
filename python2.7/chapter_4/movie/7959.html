<P>     A CHEF IN LOVE, Georgia's entry into the 1997 Academy Awards 
sweepstakes, is a frustrating motion picture.  Frustrating, because this 
poorly-focused movie is guilty, first and foremost, of not taking 
advantage of its chief assets.  Films about food and culinary wizards 
are almost always evocative creations that tease the senses, even if 
they're imperfectly prepared.  A CHEF IN LOVE barely tickles the palate, 
and certainly won't drive scores of movie-goers in search of a quality 
meal the way BABETTE'S FEAST did.</P>
<P>     The film is structured in an irritatingly non-chronological 
fashion.  Instead of presenting the narrative in a straightforward 
manner, director Nana Dzhordzadze and screenwriter Irakli Kvirikadze 
have decided to skip around in time, flashing back and forward to events 
during the 1920s, while presenting the entire story from the perspective 
of a man reading the Chef's memoirs from 70 years in the future.  
Although this approach isn't as chaotic as it sounds, it dilutes 
character development and leaves us floundering in our attempts to get a 
solid grip on the emotional core of the romance that lies at A CHEF IN 
LOVE's center.  For films like PULP FICTION and BEFORE THE RAIN, the 
non-chronological structure was effective, because it amplified the 
plot.  In A CHEF IN LOVE, there doesn't appear to be a compelling reason 
for it, and the jumps and cuts serve primarily to distract us from the 
story Dzhordzadze is trying to tell.</P>
<P>     That tale is about an aging French chef, Pascal Ichac (Pierre 
Richard), who, shortly after the first World War, travels from his 
native country to the Caucasus mountains "in search of new tastes."  
While there, he meets and falls in love with the flame-haired, fiery 
Princess Cecilia Abachidze (Nino Kirtadze).  He will not marry her, 
however, claiming that he's too old.  The two spend time together, but 
their happiness is destined not to last.  Communist revolutionaries 
topple the government, and Pascal, a friend of the deposed President, is 
placed under house arrest.  Cecilia, despite her royal title, emerges 
virtually unscathed because one of the heroes of the revolution, Zigmund 
Gogladze (Timur Kamkhadze), wants her for his wife.  </P>
<P>     A CHEF IN LOVE purports to be about the enduring power of love 
(even a revolution and all sorts of nasty characters can't kill what 
Pascal and Cecilia share), but the film's exploration of the subject 
matter isn't compelling.  Although Dzhordzadze tries to trick us into 
believing that Pascal and Cecilia's romance is a great cinematic love 
affair, it comes across as incomplete and poorly-sketched.  A brief 
scene details their initial meeting, but, after that, every exchange 
between them happens long after a relationship is established.  A CHEF 
IN LOVE cheats us of the opportunity to fall in love with these 
characters as they fall in love with each other.  As a result, we're 
expected to accept them as passionate lovers simply because the 
screenplay tells us that they are.  That's a cheat, and it's one of the 
reasons why A CHEF IN LOVE falters.</P>
<P>     The modern-day scenes in A CHEF IN LOVE are pointless.  Jean-Yves 
Gautier plays Cecilia's middle-aged son, Anton, and Micheline Presle is 
Pascal's elderly niece, Marcelle.  Together, they page through the 
handwritten notes and diary entries of the late chef, attempting to make 
sense of his life.  One revelation late in the film seemingly justifies 
the presence of these characters, but it's not all that effective 
because we don't spend enough time with Anton and Marcelle to know them 
as more than plot devices.</P>
<P>     The lead actors, Pierre Richard and Nino Kirtadze, are wonderful, 
and it's thanks to their efforts that we develop a genuine liking and 
sympathy for Pascal and Cecilia.  Richard is especially noteworthy, 
giving a performance that is both bigger than and full of life.  His 
Pascal is the ultimate hedonist, who loves eating, drinking, making 
music, and making love.  Despite being more subdued, Kirtadze's 
portrayal is no less stirring.  Even as circumstances force Cecilia into 
Zigmund's arms, we sense that she will always love Pascal, and only 
Pascal, and that lends an element of effective tragedy to an otherwise-
erratic story.  Unfortunately, few of the supporting actors do much with 
their roles.  In particular, Timur Kamkhadze is disappointing because he 
is unable to develop Zigmund into more than an almost-cartoonish 
villain.</P>
<P>     A CHEF IN LOVE is being marketed as a worthy successor to the likes 
of BABETTE'S FEAST and BIG NIGHT.  However, it isn't in the same 
category as either, and not just because it doesn't truly tantalize our 
senses of taste and smell.  When it comes to plot and character, both of 
those films possessed a richness that A CHEF IN LOVE fails to attain.  
With its melodramatic flourishes and confused, anecdotal approach, this 
movie is frequently overdone or underdone, but rarely cooked to 
perfection.</P>
