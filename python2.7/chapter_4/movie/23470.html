<P>I'm gonna be honest here and tell you that I just wasn't a big fan of Jim
Jarmush films before I saw this movie. Okay, so I had only seen two of them,
MYSTERY TRAIN, which I barely remembered liking or not, and DEAD MAN, which
is pretty much the movie that I use as a benchmark to compare all other
movies that are crap on a stick. I truly, truly hated that movie. Besides
being boring, pointless and slow, it oozed of pretentious symbolism which I
personally found to be uninvolving, uninteresting and just plain
unentertaining.</P>
<P>So as you could imagine, I was carrying plenty of baggage when I entered the
theatre, but surprised was I to find myself truly, truly diggin' this son of
a bitch flick! Original, witty, engaging (okay, so he still hasn't learned
to move things along quickly, but somehow, the slowness worked in this
movie) and just plain cool.</P>
<P>PLOT:
The life of a loner, black, samurai hitman for the Italian mafia is uprooted
when the mobsters decide that they don't exactly want him around any longer.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A quirky, unique fable featuring the most original character to hit the
screen in years, a kickass, groovy atmospheric hip-hop soundtrack, funny,
absorbing characters, all spread underneath a comforting layer of deep
philosophical Samurai gospel. Sound interesting to you? Well, like I said
earlier, initially this film didn't appeal to me either, but having seen it,
I feel like going out and buying myself a goddamn Ghost Dog T-Shirt! That
guy rules! And if you think Vin Diesel rocked in PITCH BLACK (7/10), wait
until you see this mutha! He's a mix between Travis Bickle and Jean Reno's
character from THE PROFESSIONAL, all spliced beneath an entertaining layer
of Zen-like philosophies. He's also a wee bit mysterious. Of course, this
film isn't for everyone. I could see how this wouldn't really "play" in the
big houses, with its deliberately slow pace, unusual tactics (one dude
speaks French the whole movie with subtitles) and overbearing soundtrack,
but it's like I said...it all seemed to work for me!</P>
<P>Maybe it's because I am really sick of all the same formula granola that
I've been served for the first couple of months of this movie season, or
maybe I just really haven't seen a character this cool in a long, long time,
but no matter what the reason, this film just grew on me despite having its
slow moments and symbolic undertones. Did I really understand all the
flashcards spouting samurai parables between every other scene? No way, in
fact, I didn't get most of them, but strangely felt compelled to listen
closely and ponder over every one. Am I losing it? Perhaps. Some might say
that I am "growing", since I actually liked a "Jim Jarmush" film (mind you,
it's a watered down Jarmush). All's I know is that this movie had a
compelling little tale to tell, one bad mutha as its lead, Forest Whitaker
and his lazy eye performing admirably, and surprisingly, plenty of humor to
pepper along the way. I especially loved all of the third rate mobsters,
obviously spent and past their prime, but still acting very much their role.
And let's not forget the bloodshed, kids. Okay, so it's not a Schwarzenegger
body count, but considering that our Mr. Ghost Dog is, in fact, a
hitman...plenty of murders do take place. All of which are handled with
great style and technique. Of course, the man is extremely serious about his
job (when he's not talking to pigeons that is), likes to live his life
according to the ancient teachings of the Japanese samurai and even swishes
his gun into his holster, just as a seasoned samurai would his sword.</P>
<P>All in all, a refreshing new gangster film featuring a standout performance
by Whitaker, many funny moments, the original stylings of Jimmy Jarmush and
an extra cool soundtrack. A soundtrack that will be making an appearance in
my collection any day now.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
The flashback sequences featuring the young Ghost Dog getting his butt
whupped feature none other than Damon Whitaker as said youngens. Of course
he looks a lot like Forest...cause he's his little brother.
The soundtrack for this movie was composed by RZA, of Wu-Tang Clan fame.
Real name is Robert Diggs, and he also makes a cameo appearance in this film
as the camouflage Samurai.</P>
