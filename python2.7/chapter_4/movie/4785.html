<PRE>                          RUMBLE IN THE BRONX
                       A film review by Yamamoto
                        Copyright 1996 Yamamoto</PRE>
<P>There I was, about to save this damsel in distress and this wicked
witch shows up and ruined everything.  Actually, there was this cute
woman lost and wanted directions.  I was about to give her her the
correct directions and this woman comes up and start mouthing off
as if she knew it all and gave the woman the wrong information.  Of
course being the conscientious guy that I am, I told the woman that
she just gave wrong directions and gave the woman the correct 
information.  And they all lived happily ever after.</P>
<P>Speaking of stupid things people do, RUMBLE IN THE BRONX came out
and I had to go check it out.  It's not really an action film but
a comedy packed with actions.  Yes, it dubbed.  Yes it does first
come across like one of those late night kung fu movies.  No, it's
a lot funnier than you think.  And no, you won't have to worry about
a plot 'cause it ain't there.  No, it's more entertaining than you
expect.</P>
<P>No nakkid boobs.  4 doz bullets.  5 dead bodies.  32 on the vomit
meter.  2 moon shots.  What we got here are:  airplane-fu, baggage-
fu, Manhattan-fu, grafitti-fu, one way mirror-fu, attack of killer
zit-fu, shop lifting-fu, ultimate jacket-fu, dream car-fu, attack
of killer bikers-fu, wedding of the century-fu, more bikers from
hell-fu, diamond-fu, attack of killer bottles-fu, forgive and for-
get-fu, FBI-fu, whole lotta kung-fu and insatiable action-fu.  Drive
in academy nomination for Jackie Chan for saying stuff like "we 
should be drinking together" and to Anita Mui for saying stuff like
"I should never have trusted you" and to Francois Choi for saying
stuff like "you'll get use to it" and to Kris Lord for saying stuff
like "I don't bargain."  Two and a half stars.  Shaggy Bob says 
wicked!</P>
<P>Alien Alert!  Why are so many people protesting the 3rd execution
in this state this decade?  It cost what, $50k per year per inmate
to keep 'em inside while a bullet cost what $0.10?  You figure the
math.  Do you realize what you can do with that kind of money?  May
be if we save enough money, and put them in education, we won't need
such extensive justice system.  Ok, I can always dream can't I?</P>
