<P>         Back in the heyday of drive-ins, "Disturbing Behavior" would
have made a great second feature behind something like "Massacre at
Central High" or "Rock N Roll High School." Or even "The Stepford
Wives," which this often droll little chiller frequently recalls. Put
together by some of the production team responsible for "The X Files,"
"Behavior" frequently captures the same weird/wacky atmosphere found in
some of that series' more lighthearted episodes.</P>
<P> Scott Rosenberg's screenplay mixes together equal parts of
"Stepford" and the 1987 cult classic "The Lost Boys" into a surprisingly
amusing little chiller full of quirky dialogue and slightly warped
stereotypes, such as its hero Steve (James Marsden), a troubled teen
whose well-meaning parents transplant the family to Cradle Bay, a hamlet
that initially seems to live up to its snoozy-sounding name.</P>
<P> But before long, Cradle Bay begins to look as if it has
something in common with Twin Peaks. Steve is introduced to the members
of the Blue Ribbon Club, a bunch of squeaky-clean jocks and preps whose
brilliant sugar-frosted smiles can't quite camouflage the odd twinkle in
their eyes. Uneasy with the in-crowd, Steve hooks up with stoner Gavin
(Nick Stahl) and his friend Rachel (Katie Holmes, in a marked about-face
from her docile "Dawson's Creek" character), a slacker dream-girl in
black leather and charcoal eyeliner. While Gavin and Rachel try to
hustle beers in a supermarket parking lot, the Blue Ribbon set is
holding court at the local yogurt shop and grooving to Olivia
Newton-John's "Have You Never Been Mellow." Indeed, the Ribbons are a
mellow bunch -- until those pesky adolescent hormones begin to bubble
and cause them to get physical in a way Olivia never would have
imagined.</P>
<P> Though the storyline is a bit herky-jerky (perhaps the result
of extensive last-minute editing; the DVD version offers numerous
excised scenes and an alternate ending), director David Nutter's film is
carried along by its agreeably twisted sense of humor. For example, when
a troubled kid is sentenced to be lobotomized and a nurse voices her
objections to the procedure, a doctor steps forward to assure her it's
the only sure-fire way "to cut the bruises of the banana," and when one
of the Ribbons goes berserk in public, Rachel writes it off as "toxic
jock syndrome." The movie is underscored by a well-chosen soundtrack of
gloomy alt-rock anthems, including Harvey Danger's "Flagpole Sitta"
("paranoia, paranoia, everybody's comin' to me") and the Flys' splendid
"Got You Where I Want You." Rosenberg even caps the story with a sly and
all-too-appropriate nod to Pink Floyd's "The Wall."</P>
<PRE> What a laugh.</PRE>
<PRE> What a scream.
