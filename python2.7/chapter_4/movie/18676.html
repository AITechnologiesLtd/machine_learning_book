<PRE>THE THIRD MAN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ****</PRE>
<P>So what kind of a man was Harry Lime?  What were the circumstances
surrounding his death?  And who was the mysterious third man, rumored to
have helped carry Harry's dead body to the curb after the truck ran him
over?</P>
<P>Director Carol Reed's classic THE THIRD MAN has just been restored and
is in the process of being re-released theatrically.  Now, with the
restoration of the 11 minutes of footage trimmed from the American
release by producer David O. Selznick, we can see the film as
Continental audiences first saw it.  (There were no missing scenes to be
restored since Selznick's cuts were to shorten the running lengths of
scenes and to cut down the use of German, which isn't subtitled.)</P>
<P>Not having seen the movie in what seems like a zillion years, but which
must be less than 50 since the film originally came out in 1949, I was
able to look at it again with few preconceived notions.</P>
<P>Set in a post-World-War-II Vienna, the picture does a masterful job of
recreating an era of complex politics and a city picking itself up from
the ashes.  City blocks are full of architectural masterpieces
juxtaposed with buildings in complete rubble.</P>
<P>In the story by Graham Greene and Alexander Korda, the ambiguous
characters perfectly match Robert Krasker's heavily shadowed
black-and-white cinematography.  The characters' exact intentions and
motivations are up for discussion.</P>
<P>One day, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), a writer of Westerns of dubious
quality, shows up in Vienna's central train station.  He's there to meet
his friend Harry Lime, who has offered him a job.  Learning that Harry
is dead, Holly sets out to investigate.</P>
<P>The military police, lead by Major Calloway (Trevor Howard), are looking
into Harry's dealings but don't care how he died.  They are happy to see
such a notorious crook dead.  In an horrific scam, Harry has been
stealing and then watering down the city's limited supply of penicillin,
which has caused pain and death for hundreds of children.</P>
<P>Alida Valli plays Harry's loyal girlfriend, Anna Schmidt.  And, of
course, Orson Welles has the part of Harry Lime, a man who doesn't even
appear until the second half of the movie.</P>
<P>Seeing the movie again after all these years, I was struck by several
things.  Although Harry Lime is the central character, Wells has a
remarkably small part.  His first appearance in the movie has a power
and a charm that makes it one of the most endearing scenes in cinematic
history.  Long after you've forgotten everything else, you'll remember
the image of the man hiding in the shadows, whose beaming face is
briefly lit by the light from nearby.</P>
<P>With its dominant Austrian zither music, the film serves notice that it
doesn't intend to fit neatly into any genre.  The music is whimsical,
mysterious and sometimes even a little sad.  Every time you start to
ponder a situation seriously, the music comes up to suggest that things
may not be quite what they seem.  And it warns us not to take things too
seriously.</P>
<P>The writers seem to be just off camera, laughing with little in-jokes
that they alone understand.  The scene in the Ferris wheel, in which
Harry draws a heart on the glass, is one such moment.  How is it to be
taken?  The writers seem to enjoy toying with us.</P>
<P>The overwhelming emotion on seeing it again is to realize how the
picture works best on a visual and a musical level.  One could imagine
doing away with all of the dialog and relying on the pictures and the
music alone.  Actually, the only truly memorable line is Harry's
reflection to Holly.  "In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had
warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo,
Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance," Harry points out with his
signature devilish grin.  "In Switzerland they had brotherly love.  They
had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce?   The
cuckoo clock."</P>
<P>Space operas aside, one wonders which films of today will still be
popular 50 years from now.  THE THIRD MAN and CITIZEN KANE will still be
considered classics 50 years hence, but which ones of today will rise up
to join them?  This simple question is harder than it might appear since
it involves not only artistic merit but also changing opinions.  While
waiting for the mid-twenty-first century's official classics list, go
enjoy some of the sure winners now, like THE THIRD MAN, especially if
you're lucky enough to have it playing theatrically in your area.</P>
<P>THE THIRD MAN runs 1:44.  It is rated PG for mature themes and would be
fine for any kid old enough to be interested, which probably means
around 12 and up.</P>
