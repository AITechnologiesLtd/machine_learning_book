<P>Susan Granger's review of "54" (Miramax Films)</P>
<P> This is the second movie about decadence of the late '70s era
and, like Whit Stillman's "The Last Days of Disco," it never achieves
what it sets out to accomplish. Written and directed by Mark
Christopher, it's the story of a working-class kid (Ryan Phillippe)
who escapes from the dingy reality of New Jersey by using his angelic
looks, lithe body, and ingratiating personality to infiltrate the
netherworld of Manhattan's night club scene. He's befriended by a
groggy, drug-addled homosexual, Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), one of the
owners of Studio 54, who hires him to be one of the bare-chested
busboys, joining the other narcissistic wannabees at the nightly
bacchanal. There's the coat-check girl (Salma Hayek) who wants to be a
diva; her drug-peddling husband (Breckin Meyer), who wants to be a
bartender; and the soap-opera actress (Neve Campbell) who wants to
social-climb. Everyone wants to be rich and famous. No one wants to
admit the truth. There's a sad, revealing exchange when Rubell bawls
out one of his doormen for allowing some "yids" through the velvet
rope and into the club. "But they were your family, Steve," the
unfortunate employee explains. Where the film falls short, however, is
in evoking the spectacle, the glamorous glitter, and the deafening
musical excitement that epitomized the legendary Studio 54. It was
filmed on a tiny sound stage in Toronto, and it shows. The characters,
particularly the women, are woefully underwritten, and, since Ian
Schrager, Rubell's real-life partner and a pivotal force at the club,
refused to participate in this venture, there's an obvious gap in the
quasi-historical narrative. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"54" is a sleazy, seedy 6, capturing only the deceptive energy of that
hallucinogenic, cocaine-snorting era.</P>
