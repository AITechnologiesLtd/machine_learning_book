<P>You've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi, but never
with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over
`Keeping the Faith'. It's a fluffy comedy, thoroughly glazed with a
sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer, regarding two moral topics
-- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to
collide head-on.</P>
<P>As youngsters, Brian Finn, Jacob Schramm and Anna Reilly were an
inseparable trio. While their friendship progressed, Anna always had the
compassion to shower them both with the same love and support, so
neither would feel excluded. But tragedy soon struck, as Anna was forced
to move away. Now adults, Brian (Edward Norton) and Jacob (Ben Stiller)
hold similar but contrastive jobs. The likable and kind-hearted Father
Brian is a Catholic Priest, while the spry and outgoing Jacob acts as a
Jewish Rabbi. On the basketball court, they refer to themselves as `The
God Squad'. In the relationship field, Brian abides by his Catholic
principle of celibacy, but Jacob has reached the point where finding a
Jewish bride is practically mandatory. Everything changes when Anna
(Jenna Elfman) returns to New York to visit her childhood chums. Now a
workaholic, she devotes endless hours per week to her business, but does
find spare time to reminisce with Brian and Jacob - both ecstatic about
seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again. With these oddball
ingredients tossed into one cocktail, there's bound to be some awkward
romance between our three central characters. Predicting the outcome is
not entirely difficult, but `Keeping the Faith' is open, entertaining
and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from Point A to Point B.</P>
<P>Edward Norton has emerged as one of the finest, most flexibly versatile
actors in Hollywood - a success story sparked by his critically lauded
debut in the 1996 thriller `Primal Fear'. After shockingly bitter roles
in `American History X' and, most recently, David Fincher's vicious
`Fight Club', a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar
choice. Not in the least. Norton slips into the director's chair for the
first time with `Keeping the Faith', and here his incisive, resourceful
approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive
screenplay by Stuart Blumberg. Weighing every aspect, it is unanimously
an impressive directorial debut. In addition, Norton pushes all the
right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart Brian, generating a
thoroughly likable screen presence. Stiller (the zipper guy from
`There's Something About Mary') is firm and funny, boasting a
fully-ripened comic maturity. Elfman's perky repetition can grow
tiresome (such is occasionally the case on TV's `Dharma and Greg'), but
she seems perfectly rambunctious here. The remaining cast members offer
fine support, from Anne Bancroft as Jacob's animated Jewish mom to Milos
Forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice.</P>
<P>`Keeping the Faith' is the perfect date flick... though perfection is
not a word to associate with the film in general. There is turbulence
during the process of lift-off, as numerous failed attempts at
establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead. Once the
film does settle in, it is often funny and always cheerful. Stiller,
Norton and Elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities.
We enjoy their interaction, understand their various dilemmas and feel
humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true. This is excluding
the ending, which is acceptable and all, but seems to lack the charm and
spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements. Nonetheless, a
narrowly mishandled finale certainly won't wipe the smile off your face,
nor anyone else's in the audience. `Keeping the Faith' is a highly
enjoyable romantic comedy, although one that is more observant while
surveying the questions of love rather than religion. Aww, what the
hell. The quality is not quite heaven-sent, but this little charmer
could revive our `Faith' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre.</P>
