<PRE>                                SUBURBIA
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>Director Linklater has at least two excellent films to his
credit, DAZED AND CONFUSED and the even better SLACKER.
However, subUrbia seems to be a variation on a theme and
this third time it tells us nothing new.   Using the same
cutesy upper and lower cases  in the title as in  Eric
Bogosian's play does nothing for the movie.</P>
<P>There are seven 20-year-olds  who have not a clue as to what
they should do with their lives or where they are heading.
This can lead to trouble and not surprisingly, it does. They
have nothing better to do than hang out each night in front
of a convenience store much to the annoyance of its owner, a
Pakistani, who feels their presence is driving away
potential customers.   Racism crops up when one of them has
had too much to drink.  One thing leads to another and none
of it is good as violence erupts.</P>
<P>The Pakistani husband is played by Ajay Naidu and his wife
is Samia Shoaib. The rest of the cast consists of Giovanni
Ribisi, Amie Carey, Jayce Bartok, Parker Posey, Nicky Katt,
Steve Zahn and Dina Spybey..</P>
<PRE>Directed by Richard Linklater.</PRE>
