<P>   My gosh.  There's so much tension in the eyes of the fellas
in one of the German navy's unterwasserschiffen, so much
sweat pouring down foreheads for most of this movie's 118
minutes, that you'd think that these sailors all live in a yellow
submarine.  The only yellow here is this lemon of a war
movie--in most ways a second-rate "Das Boot"--but U-571
sure is an unusual vessel.  The U-571 that Lt. Andrew Tyler
(Matthew McConaughey), Captain Dahlgren (Bill Paxton),
Chief Klough (Harvey Keitel), Lt. Pete Emmett (Jon Bon Jovi),
and Lt. Hirsch (Jake Weber) have boarded is not an
American craft but one built in Germany to house several
Nazi sailors with a modicum of comfort.  What makes this U-
571 distinctive, however, is only partly that Americans and
not Germans are running it.  The boat houses the Enigma, a
decoding device that looks like one of those stenotype
gadgets which courtroom reporters use, but instead of
chronicling events at a trial, this baby is doing so much
damage to the Allied forces that the wrong guys are winning
the war. At least that's the impression we get from the
stalwart officers and their men who have captured a Nazi
sub, gunning down the fellas who fight for the Fuhrer, and
taking its captain prisoner.</P>
<P>   Not too long into the movie, any discerning observer soon
realizes that this is not going to be "Das Boot Zwei."  The
1981 movie a.k.a. "The Boat," directed by Wolfgang Petersen
and based on the novel by Lothar G. Buchheim is above all a
human story.  Politics takes a back seat to a drama in which
the German characters are so well developed that an
American audience cannot help sympathizing with the enemy. 
The captain of Das Boot does not even like Hitler, and has no
problem expressing his disdain for the little German dictator
who started the great big war.  He and his men just want to
survive, so they spend their time talking about their lives back
home rather than about Mein Kampf while they sing "It's a
Long Way to Tipperary," because that has a bouncier tune
than "The Horst Wessel Lied."</P>
<P>   By contrast, while the claustrophobia of submarine life
comes across in Jonathan Mostow's movie, the battle scenes
are repetitious (how much tension can be generated by depth
charges fifteen minutes into the movie, twenty-five, thirty, and
so on) but what is most disappointing is that these men have
no stories to tell.  No, that's not entirely true.  One ensign,
informed that the 48-hour liberty is cancelled, whines "I didn't
even have time to consummate my marriage," though he
does not seem all that upset.  On board, another enlisted
man tells of a foolproof way he gets women to "come
across."  He talks to them about pressure introduced when a
submarine dives below 150 meters.  This may not be much of
a "line," but we all know that this Casanova is interested only
in foreshadowing what his boat is going to do.</P>
<P>   The only theme resembling a human story in "U-571"
centers on Lt. Andrew Tyler, who complains to Capt.
Dahlgren that he was not given command of a boat. 
Dahlgren is sympathetic to the hard-working lieutenant but
thinks the young man is not ready to assume such a
responsibility.  In Dahlgren's view, Tyler is too wishy-washy,
that the lieutenant feels so close to his men that he may not
be willing to give them an order that could result in any loss
of life.  Predictably enough, Tyler gets his chance to prove
his superior officer wrong when Dahlgren is killed in action
and Tyler assumes command of the sub.</P>
<P>   "U-571" is a World War II action drama about a U.S. Navy
submarine captain on a mission to steal a decoding device
from the German sub that houses it, a device that enables
the Nazis to communicate positions of Allied shipping on the
Atlantic.  The contraption must be snatched in a such a way
that the Germans are unable to transmit information to their
own side lest Germany simply change the code.  The most
absorbing part of the film occurs when the Captain Dahlgren,
shipping out on a fleabag of a sub disguised as a Nazi
vessel, sends a party of impersonators out on a raft to board
the opposing U-571, taking command after a furious
exchange of gunfire only to see his own craft go under. 
Unfamiliar with the German labels (only one man aboard can
read the language), the Yanks do the best that they can,
holding their breath as a German plane hovers over them
undecided about whether to strafe the Americans or to accept
them as Germans.  </P>
<P>   After the usual events--a German prisoner breaks free of
his chains and threatens the entire project, for example--the
new captain is tested.  As a German destroyer approaches
the U-571, he orders to sub to descend to a position so close
to the ocean floor that the pressure could crack it like an egg. 
He sends a man into a flooded compartment to fix a couple
of leaks which, if left unrepaired, would make the U-517
unable to discharge its torpedo against the hovering enemy
destroyer.  As the German depth charges go off, getting
closer and closer as the Americans perspire even more
freely, the submarine shakes and rocks, director Mostow 
capturing the reaction by jiggling the camera.</P>
<P>   "U-571" takes its place in a repertory of submarine dramas
including Tony Scott's "Crimson Tide," involving a power play
aboard a Navy nuclear submarine; Dick Powell's "The Enemy
Below," which even in 1957 had superior special effects; and
Robert Wise's "Run Silent Run Deep," pitting Clark Gable
against Burt Lancaster as a battle of wills between officers. 
The conflict between McConaughey's character, Andrew
Tyler, and those men who distrust his competence, is a
mirror image of its forerunners. Petersen's "Das Boot" stands
as the only drama supplying an inspiring combination of
human interest and dramatic and varied fighting scenes,
including one attack by the boat against a British caravan
heading through the straits of Gibraltar.  The acting in the
current film, however, is merely competent, the dialogue
humdrum, the direction without sufficient challenge.  Since
the radio on the pursuing German destroyer had been
demolished by a lucky shot and the Americans are unable to
use their own signal for fear of giving away their position, we
do get the feel of the vastness of the water as the submarine
and the destroyer play out their cat-and-mouse game as
though they housed the only human beings on the planet.</P>
<P>   For those who object to the falsification of history, note that
the true story is that in 1941 the British Navy's HMS Bulldog
snatched the Enigma from a German U-boat, while a Station
X in the English countryside performed the decoding.  This
truer version is described by Robert Harris in his novel,
"Enigma."</P>
