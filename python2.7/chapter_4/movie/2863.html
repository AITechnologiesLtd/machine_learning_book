<PRE>                            NATURAL BORN KILLERS
                       A film review by Phineas Narco
                        Copyright 1994 Phineas Narco</PRE>
<P>     SCTV, the TV spoof comedy show out of Canada that ran for several
years in syndication, once tried to do a parody of Laverne & Shirley
and found that they just couldn't do it.  The show was already a parody
of itself.  This might be the case with Oliver Stone's new film NATURAL
BORN KILLERS, a movie that's sure to be the most controversial, and one
of the most lucrative, of the year.  It is also the most visually
inventive mainstream film to be released since Alan Parker's PINK
FLOYD-THE WALL.  Moreover, I think this movie will really polarize its
audience into those who think it's brilliant and those who think it's
garbage.</P>
<P>     In case you've been under a rock for the past month, NBK has been
hyped like crazy on television for over a month before its release.  It
concerns the adventures of Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and
Juliette Lewis), two lovestruck free-spirited serial killers who go on
a three week rampage across America killing over 50 people before they
are brought to justice.  As bad as that sounds, Mickey and Mallory are
the only two likable characters in the picture!  They are surrounded
by scumbags ... Tom Sizemore as a sadistic cop hot on their tail, Robert
Downey Jr., an Australian Geraldo Rivera who would sell his soul for
ratings, Tommy Lee Jones as a sleazy prison warden, Rodney Dangerfield
as Mallory's perverted foul-mouthed father, all foils for the pure
love, and love of killing, that the death-dealing duo share.</P>
<PRE>     The movie has moments of brilliance:</PRE>
<P>     -LOVE THAT MALLORY:  Done in the style of a tv sitcom, a picture
of Mallory's horribly abusive home life complete with laughtrack and
arbitrarily bleeped profanities.  What's chilling about this is how much
*like* a sitcom it is ... the laugh cues are right on and we react to them
in the same way as we would a scene on CHEERS ... until we realize
something truly vile and sick is going on underneath the laughs.  This
is arguably the most effective sequence in the picture.</P>
<P>     -Perfectly timed "subliminals" ... someone says something to Mickey
that we know pisses him off and there's a short "cut" of a few frames
of a bleeding head screaming.  A brief peek of the rage within.</P>
<P>     -A cop murder captured live on television ... then a cut to the
Coca-Cola commercial with the smiling computer animated polar bears.
Talk about trivialization!</P>
<P>     Lewis and Harrelson do fine jobs considering the amount of special
effects they have to contend with.  There might be some Oscar
nominations in the offing here unless the Academy gets cold feet from
this controversial picture.</P>
<P>     One weak point of the film is that there really isn't any
exposition about how the public comes to love these two ... perhaps
they've been watching TV versions that give the killers the same
preferential treatment as this movie?</P>
<PRE>     Hmmmm.</PRE>
<P>     Just about everyone they kill does something (at least in the mind
of a killer, or a moviegoer) to deserve it.  A cowboy dances vulgarly,
unwelcome with Mallory, a redneck trucker ogles her and talks to Mickey
vulgarly about what he'd like to do to her, a horny gas station
attendant tries to rape her, a waitress snaps rudely at her ... they're
all blown away ... and inside, more and more, we're cheering the killers
on.</P>
<PRE>     Hmmmm.</PRE>
<P>     By the end of the movie, during the prison break, we're cheering
for the prisoners and escapees as they smash and kill their captors ...
rather like the gawkers on the overpass in LA cheering OJ Simpson 50
yard dash into the end zone.</P>
<PRE>     Hmmmm.</PRE>
<P>     Much has been made about the fact that throughout the movie Stone
uses just about every special cinematic 'gimmick' in the book:  8mm,
lens filters, grainy black and white, jump cuts and flashbacks galore,
animation, morphing, pixelvision, front projection, rear projection,
video, subliminals, laughtracks, reverse-reverb, slow motion, super
slow-mo, claymation(?), time-lapse, double exposure ... to name only
the ones I recognized!  the film is a literal textbook of special film
technique and certainly it is the most prominent, even overwhelming,
aspect of the movie.  The average length of a shot would be interesting
to figure out.  I suspect it's probably under a second, maybe two at
the most.  Perhaps when this comes out on video Criterion Collection
will issue it on laserdisc in CAV format so that videophiles can check
it out literally frame by frame.  There is enough STUFF in this film
for ten films and to be frank it is frequently distracting.  While
watching this movie I found that I was so captivated by the astonishing
visuals I wasn't paying any attention to the characters, dialogue or
the plot.</P>
<P>     All this begs the question:  Why did Oliver Stone make his film
like this?  I have always been impressed by at least the *visuals* of
his movies even if I don't always agree with the ideas behind them.
JFK for example was a factual mess but technically brilliant.  But
Stone's smart enough guy to know that this movie would affect its
viewers in the way I described and I really believe that it's
intentional, as I'm sure a lot of people have figured out.  What he's
doing is caricaturizing American media...  offering forth the favorite
subject of the tabloid news circuit (serial killers) in the same kind
of quasi-real quick-cut flash and sparkle style of those same tabloid
news shows.  Stone seems to be saying "you want sensationalism?  You
want flashy visual gimmicks?  You want the STORY and not the reality?
Here!  Here it is in spades times ten!!"  The problem with this film's
reception with people who criticize it, I think, is they don't GET that
it's a spoof of media.  And understandably so!  Indeed, "news" nowadays
has gotten all too much like the style of NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  It's
hard to tell the caricature from the original and at first glance it
seems that Stone is just offering *more* of what he's purportedly
criticizing and spoofing.  The difference between what Stone offers and
what television offers is that Stone has a bigger budget and more time
to work on it.  NATURAL BORN KILLERS is visually assaultive, confusing,
violence-glorifying, over-the-top, pretentious, self-indulgent comic
book fairy tale.  But that's the point!</P>
<P>     There really is a fine line between what Stone has put together
here and what he's commenting on and spoofing.  Since media is becoming
more and more a parody of itself, parodying media is getting to be a
tricky business calling for the kind of extremities Stone explores
here.</P>
<PRE>     *That* in itself really says something.</PRE>
<PRE>.
