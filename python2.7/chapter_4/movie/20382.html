<PRE>Let's get the DAT out of here!
The Blair Witch Project</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>My goodness, this little picture has become such an event, hasn't it? The
film itself (without the chatter) wouldn't be much more than a video teens
might think pretty cool. However, everyone is talking about this film; the
gardener, the taxi driver -- I just discussed it with a semi-retired notary
in San Louis. Unless you're one of those weird, remote, or way-married folks
who never see movies anymore -- you've heard the hype.</P>
<P>Admittedly, I wouldn't have seen it without the popularity, without the
lines of people outside the theaters. Alas, my ever-growing curiosity could
no longer remain in the dark.</P>
<P>What it appears to be: The picture is about a film crew of three young
people (Josh, Mike and Heather) with the mission of documenting the legend
of Blair Witch. Supposedly, in 1940 seven children were killed up in the
back woods of New England and since then the older generation has always
spoken of hauntings.</P>
<P>The preface (in text) tells us that this documentary trio disappeared and
that we're about to see the film and video tape that they left behind. The
first twenty minutes are spent in nearby towns interviewing a few people
concerning their knowledge of the myth and whether or not they buy into it.
But much of the footage holds behind the scenes glimpses of the young trio
as they think and talk about their mission. It's reminiscent of MTV's "Real
World."</P>
<P>The remainder of the film is shot with no other subjects beyond these three
crew members in no other location than in the woods. No witch is ever
filmed. In short, there's a lot of shaky camera movement, hiking, arguing
about map interpretation, and spooky noises in a dark tent during the four
or five nights.</P>
<P>Heather is the director and project leader, she drives the crew. It appears
to me that she is in on the hoax. The other two actors seem to be truly
bewildered and increasingly "freaked out" by what appear to be "the real"
filmmakers (or producers, or friends of Heather) out in the woods making
cackling noises, ruffling the tent mesh, and leaving creepy patterns of
stones and sticks. Though I must say, Heather's cracking voice and red-eyed
tears often had me reconsidering my assumption.</P>
<P>Did I say "hoax"?
Perhaps hoax is too strong a word. Anyway, what's really happening is...
before the shoot, "real" directors Myrick and Sanchez provided their three
person mock-documentary crew a 35 page outline, a crash course on 16 mm film
and Hi-8 video photography, and daily clues left in a box. From there, "BWP"
is three rattled actors doing a fine job of ad-libbing. Whether or not the
actors where informed that they'd be harassed at night, I don't know. Either
way ... Myrick and Sanchez were getting heated drama during the day and
truly animalistic fear-filled utterances from them in the dark.</P>
<P>Technically speaking:
The little film is shot mostly on video tape and 16mm film, both of which
are not considered acceptable formats for the big screen under normal
circumstances. However this is not a normal situation. I have high praise
(and envy) for the conception of the "Blair Witch Project." The filmmakers
took a great idea, lied a little, and made a motion picture out of a bunch
of sticks and very little money. I'm sure they'll have secured themselves a
nice budget for their next production.</P>
<P>(FYI: DAT is Digital Audio Tape. The three often worry about getting the DAT
back. Which means ... they'd probably rented sound recording equipment and
needed to return it promptly or pay penalty fees etc.)</P>
<P>Entertainment value:
Oddly I found most of the production rather interesting -- though nothing
terribly scary till the end, which was more of a spooky cub-scout-camp-story
scary than really horrific. I enjoyed the drama between the three. I wanted
to see just how long Heather could keep these guys from beating the crap out
of her or taking off on their own. The sometimes extremely heated arguments
(usually between Heather and either one of the guys) did get tiresome. That
and the video was very jittery at times -- beyond what was necessary to
create the sense of nervousness I'm sure they wanted. I had to
intermittently look away from the screen to prevent a headache. Ultimately,
the movie was better than I'd anticipated, a curiously unique endeavor on
it's own (which I'm reviewing) and plainly outstanding as the event that
it's become.</P>
<P>The Remarkable Dollar Stats:
Filmmaker's budget: $35,000
Artisan's purchase price: $1.1 million
Projected domestic box office gross: $100 million</P>
<P>Starring Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams.
Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez.
Released by Artisan.</P>
