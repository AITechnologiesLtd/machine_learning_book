U.S. MARSHALS     1998
Reviewed by Pierce Dalton
3 1/2 stars (out of 4)</PRE>
<PRE> U.S. Marshals is an arresting film.</PRE>
<P> I would even say that I liked it better than The Fugitive, the 1993 Harrison
Ford vehicle for which Marshals is a sequel, or spin-off, of, so to speak.</P>
<P> Tommy Lee Jones stars again as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard, the ruthless,
unstoppable cop who tracked down and help find innocent Dr. Richard Kimble
(Ford) the first time out.</P>
<P> Here, he is back in top form, tracking down another fugitive, played by Wesley
Snipes.  He is framed (?) for the homicide of two FBI agents in New York,
transfered in a plane for convicts, but escapes after the plane is forced to
make an emergancy landing in an exciting crash sequence that tops, even, the
bus crash in Fugitive.</P>
<P> Marshals is a very well-made thriller.  Director Stuart Baird has captured the
style and essence of Andrew Davis (who directed the original), and, I think,
added his own extra special hand.</P>
<P> There is a literally edge-of-your-seat scene at a cemetery, during a funeral,
which has an assassin on the roof top of the church shooting as our hero Jones
as he trys to flee for his live.</P>
<P> U.S. Marshals is brainy fun, and visually spectacular.  And seeing Jones in a
giant chicken costume is worth admission alone.</P>
