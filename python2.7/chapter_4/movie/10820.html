<PRE>GOOD WILL HUNTING   ****</PRE>
<P>My mind is constantly at work in all the movies I see.  My brain races to
find the ending of a film even before its plot has been fully revealed.  I
didn't let my mind race in Good Will Hunting, because I was too caught up
in the dialogue and characterizations.  I couldn't ruin the experience of
the film but trying to out-think it. </P>
<P>This is a wonderful film that reminded me of CHASING AMY, another of the
years best films.  The writing is very funny and fresh, with some of the
best dialogue spoken all year.  I relish in good writing, in a year when we
are enflicted with trash like THE SAINT and DANTES PEAK.  I laughed more in
this film than I did in most comidies like LIAR LIAR and THE FULL MONTY.</P>
<P>Matched with the funny comedy is truely heart wrenching moments that
reminded me of TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, one of the best films in the eighties. 
Damon and Affleck will probable win the best screenplay oscar and deserve
it.  Critics who dismis this film as being overly predictable are not doing
the film justice.  SOme of these are the same guys who over-praised the
film SLING BLADE.</P>
