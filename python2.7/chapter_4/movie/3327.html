<PRE>                           IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: John Carpenter takes a Lovecraft
          concept and spins it into a stylish horror film--
          one of the few really competent horror films I have
          seen in the 90s.  Still most of the interest is in
          the buildup and the payoff is neither original nor
          surprising.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4) text</PRE>
<P>     It is ironic that while the Western seems to be in decline and
horror films just seem to pour onto video store shelves there are more
quality Westerns being made than quality horror films.  The horror
genre is a classic case of bad films driving out the good.  The horror
genre of late has been dominated by gore, splatter, plastic prosthetic
makeup effects, teenage protagonists, predictable jump scenes, and a
tired succession of sequels and remakes.  Imagination and creativity
are becoming increasingly scarce in most horror films.  Now that
impressive visual effects are easy, filmmakers are using them in lieu
of atmosphere, style, and imagination.  One filmmaker who still does
use some style and ideas in his horror is John Carpenter.  While he
falls short of the stature even of David Cronenberg in the same genre,
Carpenter does occasionally turn out a very original piece of horror
like PRINCE OF DARKNESS or THEY LIVE.  IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS is not
up to those two films, but it is one of his better horror exercises.</P>
<P>     A bit too much of the premise is obvious from the trailer, but the
story concerns an insurance investigator, John Trent (played by Sam
Neill), who has been driven mad by his recent experiences.  Neill gives
a bizarre and quirky impression of madness.  Trent's experiences
involved looking for a missing horror writer, Sutter Cane (Jurgen
Prochnow).  As a publishing executive tells Trent, "You can forget
about Stephen King, Sutter Cane by far outsells him."  (If, in fact, it
is true in the world of the film, one wonders why Trent would have to
be told how popular Cane is.)  The trail to find the horror writer
leads to a small and strange New Hampshire town, Hobbs End--the story
is an expansion of an idea by H. P. Lovecraft but, like PRINCE OF
DARKNESS, contains more than one tip of the hat to Nigel Kneale and his
QUATERMASS AND THE PIT.</P>
<P>     Carpenter recognizes that the most disturbing images do not
require special makeup and visual effects.  Instead his most haunting
scenes involve juxtapositions distorted just slightly out of our
reality.  There is more wrong with Hobbs End than that it seems like it
could be the setting for a horror novel, but what is wrong in the town
is artificial and a letdown after we see how the citizenry of Hobbs End
react to the secret.</P>
<P>     Neill's performance as a madman in the early parts of the film is
a real departure for him, but he gives no signs of a severe strain in
the events leading up to his madness.  Charleton Heston, David Warner,
John Glover, and Bernie Casey have minor roles and are under-utilized,
though Glover is certainly of some interest as a doctor with a tenuous
grip on reality.</P>
<P>     At heart this story is an old idea--the small town that appears
innocent and hides a deeply sinister core, but Carpenter has hung
enough interesting gimmicks on the tale that his fans probably won't
mind.  I give this film a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
