Review: Chicken Run (2000)<HR></PRE>
<PRE>[3.5/4.0]</PRE>
<P>The escape film is a standard genre which has been employed throughout
motion picture history. Its inherent tension and suspense provide a
natural framework on which to build a gripping story, and this has
been done so often that it is difficult to create anything original
within that genre. However, being such a stalwart formula also makes
it a ripe target for parody, and this film does that by replacing all
the standard human characters with primarily chickens.</P>
<P>The film is an animated feature made by a process of stop motion
animation with clay figures - "claymation", a specialization of
Aardman Production, which produced this film. It is written and
directed by Nick Park (who is known for his claymation shorts Wallace
and Grommit) and Peter Lord. This technique has been in existence
since the early days of film, but has become rare since the
development of less labor intensive special effects, notably computer
generated imagery.</P>
<P>The story takes place at the Tweedy chicken farm, where the resident
chickens (all hens save for one aged rooster) are held captive. They
are constantly searching for a way to escape the unpleasant conditions
at the farm, where they must keep up their egg production quotas or
literally get the axe. They make many attempts to escape, led by
natural leader Ginger (Julia Sawalha), but never meet with any
success. One day they see Rocky the Rooster (Mel Gibson) fly overhead
and accidentally crash into their fenced compound. In Rocky, they see
someone who could teach them to fly, and thus give them a means to
escape the farm and reach a sanctuary to live a life of freedom.</P>
<P>Although a grim storyline is the basis of the plot, this is actually a
funny and entertaining film. Their enclosure is portrayed as the
common prisoner of war camp of film, and all the components of that
genre are expressed - clandestine meetings, contrived escape plans,
close camaraderie from shared hardship, and a barter economy with
black market traders (in this case, Cockney rats).</P>
<P>Although it may appear derivative, the story goes to such great detail
to anthropomorphize the chickens, that it feels that the genre itself
is the aspect being manipulated to fit the plot. When a formulaic
storyline is used as a shortcut for original, writing, it is dreary.
When it is used as a basis for a genre spoof, it can be the outlet for
intelligent humor. Discerning viewers will notice the multiple layers
employed by the film, and will be impressed by the challenges that the
film sets and meets.</P>
<P>The film is constructed to have appeal for all viewers. It does not
euphemize death and killing for its younger audience, but it also does
not present intentionally disturbing images. For younger viewers, the
film provides colorful characters, typical cartoon action sequences,
and limited musical sequences. For adult viewers, it provides clever
one-liners, caricatures of stereotypical characters, and subtle
references to classic films.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. This film uses a standard storyline to great
effect. It is a simple, common structure that can be followed by
children, and it is also a target for parody that will entertain adult
viewers. It is consistently humorous, entertaining, and clever, and
thus has appeal for a wide audience.</P>
