<P>Director Barbet Schroeder takes a wide-turn at the genre section of
movie-making, and trades in his permanent place-card from the human
drama division, and punches up a DIE HARD (8/10)-type thriller for the
intellectually-challenged. </P>
<P>PLOT:
A feisty police officer's nine-year old son has fallen gravely ill and
needs a bone marrow transplant in order to survive. The only donor
compatible to the child is Peter McCabe (Keaton), multiple murderer
locked up in jail. Agent Conner (Garcia) convinces Peter to redeem
himself by helping his son live longer. McCabe agrees. Once in the
hospital, McCabe escapes, and mayhem ensues. Ironically, detective
Conner must catch the fugitive, but not kill him, for his son's life
hangs in the balance. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Rudimentary thriller containing some suspenseful moments, many
implausibilities, a standard car chase, a solid performance by Keaton
as the highly enlightened killer, and a cool final scene. This movie is
not extremely original in any way, shape or form, but it does offer an
interesting launch premise, a relatively short run-time, and an even
pace of suspense and interest throughout. Michael Keaton's performance
is also very over-the-top and fun to watch, and of course, the
proverbial Andy Garcia playing "the suit" (I may be mistaken, but I
think Andy's last seven films have him garbed in a suit. Perhaps even
the same suit! Stretch your acting muscles, Andy! Loosen the tie,
dude!!).</P>
<P>Schroeder does not bring anything overtly stylish to the film, but does
maintain a non-stop pace of twists, turns and action scenes. The film
could've used a stronger "reality check" (Garcia asks other police
officers not to shoot Keaton's character in order to maintain his son's
chances of living, while sacrificing the lives of other officers in the
process.), as Garcia's character seems to break every law in the book
by the end of the film (Why couldn't you just shoot the guy in the legs
to slow him down? Just a thought.)</P>
<P>Overall, this film would not be a highly recommendable one by any
stretch of the imagination, but I guess it was some fun for what it
was, and it sure wouldn't hurt if you crashed out after a long day's
work, and needed something to join your brain in shut-down mode for an
hour or so. Keaton's performance is also enjoyable to watch, as is the
"suit's". Also, the final scene of this movie is one of the coolest
that I've seen in a while, so I guess you could always look forward to
that little tidbit of hipness. Otherwise, this film is like a wet fart
on a hot day. Satisfying as it goes along, but ultimately empty and
forgettable when it's over. </P>
<P>Little Known Facts about the film and its stars:
The article "Inside the Mind of a Sociopath" that the Captain is
reading during the trip to the prison is written "by Michael Keaton".
Andy Garcia was born in Havana, Cuba, under his full name of Andres
Arturo Garcia-Menendez. Upon his birth, Andy apparently had an unusual
growth on his shoulder. It turned out to be a twin that hadn't fully
developed. "They just snipped it off, apparently," says Garcia. He's
been married to Maria Victoria (whom everyone calls Marivi), a fellow
Cuban émigré, since 1982, and vigorously guards her privacy and that of
their three daughters, Dominik, Daniella, and Alessandra.
Director Barbet Schroeder is a man. He was nominated as Best Director
at the 1991 Academy Awards for THE REVERSAL OF FORTUNE (7/10), and
played the French President in the Tim Burton movie MARS ATTACKS!
(6.5/10).
Writer David Klass' first produced screenplay was KISS THE GIRLS
(7/10).</P>
