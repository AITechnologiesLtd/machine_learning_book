<PRE>                              HARRIET THE SPY
                       A film review by Kevin Maguire
                        Copyright 1996 Kevin Maguire</PRE>
<P>Director: Bronwen Hughes
Producers: Tons Of People From Nickelodeon
Starring: Michelle Trachtenburg, Rosie O'Donnell.</P>
<P>        In the new movie HARRIET THE SPY, Michelle Trachtenburg plays an 
intrepid young girl set on spying people and things. However, as any 
movie must have it, Trachtenburg gets stuck several times doing things 
and spying on things that aren't really appropriate for her to be seeing. 
She has every piece of spy gear possible, glasses, rope, a huge 
treehouse. What more could go wrong?</P>
<P>        The movie she's in. HARRIET THE SPY, although sometimes strangely 
validating, and in one scene, touching, is a comedy that has been cranked 
out of a machine. Although the idea is based on a good book, it's not 
supposed to be funny. The idea is that Harriet can go around spying on 
people, and we should be able to really sense her intensity level. But 
comedy once again woes us. There are stupid fights, and flatulence 
attacks.</P>
<P>        Indeed, one of the biggest problems in HARRIET THE SPY is within 
its producers. Workers for Nickelodeon, these producers have made a half 
funny, half touching, and no thrilling movie that reminds me of sugar in 
a Pixy-Stik. It's just sugar, there's no real flavor in the different 
colors. Rosie O'Donnell, hot off her Merv Griffith approved TV program, 
THE ROSIE O'DONNELL SHOW, surprisingly keeps going on a roll. Her 
performance is spunky, and charged with wit that I don't see in a Woody 
Allen film. </P>
<P>        To bad the writing shrinks her to another one of the movie's 
concocted characters. In HARRIET THE SPY, there's no way to separate 
what's corny, and what's not. Ideally, the movie would be an IT TAKES TWO 
takeoff. It does one step better than that movie, but this one's still 
way off base.</P>
