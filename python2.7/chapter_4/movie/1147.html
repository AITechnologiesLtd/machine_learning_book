<PRE>                                BARTON FINK
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     BARTON FINK is a film directed by Joel Coen, written by Joel and
Ethan Coen.  The film stars John Turturro, John Goodman, John Mahoney,
Judy Davis, Michael Lerner.  With Jon Polito and Steve Buscemi.  Rated R
for language.</P>
<P>     BARTON FINK is the most puzzling movie I've seen in a long time,
which is not to say I didn't enjoy it.  I did, I enjoyed the hell out of
it.  Just don't ask me what it's about.</P>
<P>     I find it impossible to say anything about BARTON FINK that needs
saying without possibly giving something away.  This is a film that
amazes and surprises in virtually every scene.  So be warned:</P>
<PRE>!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!</PRE>
<P>     You've probably heard about the story and I'm not going to get into
that, except to say that Barton Fink (John Turturro) is a self-absorbed
playwright with his first hit on Broadway who gets himself co-opted by
Hollywood in 1941.  Hollywood, in this case, is personified by mogul
Jack Lipnick (Michael Lerner).  Fink is thrown into a totally unsuitable
project, a B wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.</P>
<P>     He lives in the Hotel Earle, which has got to be the Official Hotel
for the Twilight Zone.  The hotel is dark, hotel, vast, and populated
exclusively by Fink, a very strange bell boy/room clerk Chet (Steve
Buscemi), a superannuated elevator operator who thinks he may heard of
the Bible, and Charlie Meadows (John Goodman), Fink's next-door
neighbor, an insurance salesman with a gift for gab.</P>
<P>     Fink also makes the acquaintance of another studio writer,
W. P. Mayhew (John Mahoney) and Mayhew's secretary/lover, Audrey Taylor
(Judy Davis).</P>
<P>     If you're a Hollywood buff, you may find yourself caught up in the
roman-a-clef aspect of the script: is Fink Clifford Odets, is Mayhew
William Faulkner, Lipnick Louis B.  Mayer with a touch of Harry Cohen?
What do you do with the fact that Beery actually did make a wrestling
picture, FLESH, in 1932, directed by John Ford and reputed to be a
pretty good flick?  Time is only one of the things that are out of joint
in this film.</P>
<P>     Indeed, there are whole lot of facta that I have no idea what to do
with (if that's a sentence).  The disgusting, sweating, peeling
wallpaper, the fan that doesn't blow any air, the horrific murder, the
flaming corridor that no one seems to notice.  I keep returning to John
Goodman charging down that hallway with his shotgun intent on mayhem and
shouting "the life of the mind" over and over.  Is this really what
BARTON FINK is about: the life of the mind?  If so what does it say
about this?  All the characters are frauds, a third of the action may or
may not be happening to the characters in the same way it's happening to
us, the audience.  And then there's the pin-up over Barton's writing
desk who seems to end the film on the beach.  Barton says, "You're very
pretty.  Are you in the pictures?"  She says, "Don't be silly."  What?
I gasped to myself.  "Don't be silly"?  Wait, I cried, don't end the
movie now!  If the movie itself a deliberate fraud?  Do I want to hear
that?</P>
<P>     If you go to the movies to see wonderful performances, this is a
choice for you.  Turturro, who previously played the psychotic crybaby
in MILLER'S CROSSING, is absolutely wonderful in the weird title role,
making Fink interesting even while skewering Fink with his own ego.  And
John Goodman, sweating with a passion I've never seen from him, is
alternately boobish and horrifying and enigmatic.  Lerner as the mogul
goes far beyond the call of duty in his portrait of the degeneracy of
absolute power: a man who will do anything because he can.  The other
actors each create memorable characterizations, even as you shake your
head over each one's mystery and corruption.</P>
<P>     The camera work is bold, the editing tight and ingenious, the
acting and direction totally over the top.  Unfortunately, for the more
conventional movie-goer BARTON FINK displays a kind of contempt for
story-telling, dropping major story lines into the abyss of enigma.  The
Coens give no quarter and ask none.</P>
<P>     I recommend BARTON FINK to anyone who can tolerate a movie that
will leave him or her on his or her own, a movie that may give one
something to talk about for a long time after leaving the theater.  And
I recommend it as full price.  It's worth it.</P>
