<PRE>The Negotiator (1998) 2 stars out of 4</PRE>
<P> Sometimes as you watch a film you get a sixth sense that something is
lacking.</P>
<P> I'm not talking about some grade-Z slasher film with a no-name cast, but a
major studio production with bankable stars.</P>
<PRE> Such a movie is The Negotiator.</PRE>
<P> On the surface the movie, about a highly-decorated Chicago police hostage
negotiator who takes hostages of his own after being framed for his
partner's murder and the theft of $2 million from the police pension fund,
is enjoyable as well as being predictable.</P>
<P> But it's missing that spark, that added something that raises it from the
mere ordinary.</P>
<P>And it's in the performances of Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey that
this fault lies. Both are very fine actors who usually dominate the screen.
But in The Negotiator they seem to only be going through the motions. Both
give workmanlike performances. Both are very professional and smart. Both
are very good. But it's as if they didn't put their hearts and souls into
the project.</P>
<P> It's more like the movie was just another job, another paycheck.</P>
<P> With Jackson and Spacey as protagonists - Spacey's character, like
Jackson's, is a hot-shot police negotiator - sparks should fly when they
face off on screen.</P>
<P> But nothing happens. Just two fine actors throwing lines at each other. A
remoteness is emitted from the screen. An invisible barrier keeps you from
any emotional involvement in either character or Jackson's predicament.</P>
<P> Jackson and Spacey are too intelligent and too charismatic to allow their
characters to be nothing more than two-dimensional archtypes. They endow
their roles with enough business to keep you interested. But, perhaps
because of their reputations or their past performances, we've come to
expect more.</P>
<P> Maybe it's because the screen just doesn't explode from the force of their
personalities. Or maybe it's because they are so focused on each other that
they forgot there's an audience watching.</P>
<P> It doesn't help that The Negotiator has a been-there, done-that feel to
it. An honest cop, framed by dishonest bretheran. We've seen it all before.</P>
<P> And after a while it becomes obvious who the secret leader of the
conspiracy is. While everyone else involved in the hostage situation wants
to rush in and shoot Jackson's Danny Roman, only one of his superiors
remains the calm voice of reason.</P>
<P> Fans of Jackson and Spacey should enjoy The Negotiator. It's just that
considering the fine cast, which also includes David Morse, Ron Rifkin and
John Spenser, you'd expect more of an edge, a bit more unpredicatibility.</P>
<P> As it is, The Negotiator is merely routine. And that is not enough.</P>
