<P>Based on the best-selling novel of the same name, this film recreates a
nightmarish situation to which all parents could identify: the sudden
disappearance of a child. Michelle Pfeiffer takes on the role of the
absent-minded mom who loses the boy, while Treat Williams portrays the
steadfast and patient husband.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Regular family of mom, dad and three kids. Mom takes trip with kids, and
leaves her two sons alone in a hotel lobby for a few minutes. When she
returns, the younger boy has disappeared. They try to find him but to no
avail. Nine years later, the boy unknowingly shows up at her front porch
soliciting a lawn-mowing gig. His fingerprints are a match. Now, they must
survive his return and their ongoing struggles to cope with their divergent
feelings.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Take a TV movie of the week, add two dashes of a solid actress via Michelle
Pfeiffer, an interesting, if not mostly given away by its own trailer,
storyline, some hugs, some tears, and you've got yourself a film whose title
still doesn't fully make much sense to me. Now despite me knowing exactly
what was going to happen up until the halfway point of this movie, this film
conquered the impossible, and still managed not to bore me too much. It did
however lack the overall emotional authenticity for me to qualify it as a
solid all-out dramatic piece of filmmaking. The acting was also a
half-and-halfer with Pfeiffer pulling off an excellent mom going through all
the obvious stages of grief and guilt-syndrome, while others like Whoopie
Goldberg stuck out like a sore thumb (That's right, she plays Whoopie
again!).</P>
<P>I also found the missing kid to be lacking much of the conviction needed for
his complex role. His character always seemed indifferent and emotionless,
and whether or not that was the actor's fault or that of the screenwriter, I
didn't quite find his full-circle plight all that believable. Having said
that, Jonathan Jackson playing the older brother was super in his role, and
Treat Williams, well, Treat Williams continues his artistic trek to restore
some much-needed legitimacy to his acting career. Mrs. JoBlo enjoyed this
film much more than I did, but I suppose that was to be quite expected,
considering the subject matter of the picture. All in all, I didn't think it
was a bad movie, but did wonder about its need for giant screen
presentation. The TV tube and a Sunday night would have been fine. All in
all, it is Pfeiffer and Jackson that give this movie some worth, with the
story never running into major boring moments (or any exciting ones for that
matter), and qualifying this movie as a worthy candidate for a video rental.
You might even want to check it out in the theatres, if you've been feeling
sensitive of late, and want a good cry. That, or if you're really intrigued
by its premise.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
The novel on which this film is based was endorsed by Oprah Winfrey's
wonderful Book Club. In fact, it was the first book picked by the super-rich
talk-show queen back in September of 1996.
