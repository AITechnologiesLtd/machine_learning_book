<PRE>PECKER (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: John Waters
Starring: Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci, Lili Taylor, Mary Kay Place,
Mark Joy, Brendan Sexton III, Jean Schertler, Martha Plimpton, Lauren
Hulsey, Patty Hearst, Bess Armstrong, Greg Gorman</P>
<P>If you look at the statue of Benjamin Franklin that stands above all the
buildings in Philadelphia from a certain perspective, it seems as if he has
a giant erect penis.  Looking at things from a different perspective and
discovering humor in them is one of the things that make life tolerable,
and the lead character in this film, nicknamed Pecker for his bizarre
eating habits (yeah, right), sees this, a habit which is introduced in one
of the film's first images, that of a statue of George Washington looked at
from a different perspective that makes is eerily similar to the Franklin
statue in Philadelphia.  Is there a connection between all the stautes of
these Revolutionary Era heroes?</P>
<P>Played by Edward Furlong, Pecker is a cheerful teenage photographer living
in Baltimore who takes pictures so much that whenever he needs Kodak film,
he sets up an elaborate shoplifting scam from the local grocery store. 
Using a small camera he got from his mom's Thrift store, he takes pictures
of anything even remotely interesting, and has become a bit of a celebrity
around town because of it.</P>
<P>Of course, it helps that he has pretty interesting subjects.  His
girlfriend, Shelly (Christina Ricci, who has officially become "la reine
d'art house"), is a laundromat-nazi who occasionally pulls down the zipper
on her blouse so Pecker can take a pic of her cleavage.  His younger
sister, Chrissy (Lauren Hulsey), is a notorious sugar fiend.  His older
sister, Tina (Martha Plimpton), works at a gay strip bar named the "Fudge
Palace."  His father (Mark Joy) works at a bar which is losing business
because a lesbian tittie bar has opened across the street from him, causing
him to bitch about how it's against the law to show beaver whilst serving
liquor.  His best friend, Matt (Brendan Sexton III, from "Welcome to the
Dollhouse"), is a masterful thief.  His grandma (Jean Schertler) has a
statue of the Virgin Mary that talks...with grandma pulling a switch on its
back that moves its lips and doesn't seem to realize she's doing
ventriloquist work for the voice.  And there's his mom (Mary Kay Place),
who happily works at the Thrift Store and boasts she can dress anyone
nicely for a mere quarter.</P>
<P>When Pecker shows a free art show at his work, a New York art dealer, Rorey
(Lili Taylor), shows up and immeadiately loves his work, and gets him a
show up in New York.  The critics and art freaks love his work, dubbing him
"a more humane Diane Arbus."  Pecker has become a little Andy Warhol: a
young artist who's discovered from a small home town.  But Warhol stayed in
New York, while Pecker finds he has to decide what he wants to do.  His art
ends up doing more harm to his family than good, but on the other hand,
he'll be the toast of the New York art world and will be set for life.</P>
<P>"Pecker"'s the latest from John Waters, the hilarious man with a paper-thin
moustache, and known for his ghastly disgusting films, the most notorious
being "Pink Flamingoes," the film that shocked the world over 25 years ago
with images such as a woman eating shit and a song and dance done by a pair
of testicles.  I've, sadly enough, never seen one of his films, but have
come to admire the guy from interviews, articles, and most brilliantly, a
guest appearance on "The Simpsons" that was nothing short of absolute
hilarity.</P>
<P>But with "Pecker," he must have calmed down.  A lot.  Sure, he shocks us
with a couple jokes.  There's a shot of what has to be the closest image of
a woman's pubic hair in an R rated film.  There's the image of two rats
fucking.  There's the hilarious introduction to a gay-bar fetish known as
"tea bagging" (guess what it entails).  And I almost don't need to mention
that the title is the best of the year (after seeing it, you can tell your
friends "Yeah, I just saw John Waters' 'Pecker'").  Of course, when a
film's title is the film's best joke, you're really in trouble, and after
these few jokes, varying in hilarity, that's really about it as far as
jokes that are actually humorous.  Waters has become infamous for making
people laugh with disgusting images and scenes, those which cross over into
what is commonly referred to as "bad taste," but which can easily become
comedy to anyone who doesn't always need subtlety with their humor.</P>
<P>But that's not what's really wrong with this film.  We do expect something
extremely shocking from John Waters, but it would still be fine if he did
calm down and made a film that was hilarious without resorting to NC-17
tactics.  The problem is it's just not very funny.  Nor is it subtle. 
Waters has created a film here that really could be very hilarious.  Take
the joke about the Virgin Mary statue - there are countless jokes that
could be really funny about this.  Waters uses about two of them.  And
they're not really the really funny ones.</P>
<P>Instead of really funny humor, with scenes that are so vile and gross that
we just can't help but kick the chairs in front of us with fitful laughing,
we get scenes that are so blatant in their message and so jaw-droppingly
unfunny that we can't help but just sit there, staring at it, and wondering
what Waters thought was exactly humorous about them.  In one scene, Shelly
discovers Pecker kissing Rorey in his basement, and a chase ensues between
Pecker and Shelly which ends up in a voting booth (I guess when you have to
vote, you have to vote), where they have loud, physical, and clothed sex. 
Just not funny.</P>
<P>It's sad, too, that Waters can't do satire without subtlety.  His
characters say exactly what the problem is whenever the problem arises,
like "My pictures are turning my life inside out."  And while the culture
shock between the odd balls of Baltimore and the art world of New York is
occasionally funny (when coming home from New York, some Baltimorians kiss
the street), it's shots at the art world are stale.  As if they actually
needed skewering.  It would be funnier if a new angle was taken or if the
Baltimorians were more humorous.</P>
<P>"Pecker" may be pretty much bad and unfunny, but it's not totally
unworthwhile.  Some of the performances, particularly the ones by Christina
Ricci and Mary Kay Place, are right on.  There are some moments that are
oddly funny, like a bizarre scene where a social worker makes a house call
to put the younger sister on Ridlin.  These are what redeem it slightly. 
But when there's a dinner scene where Pecker makes a lengthy, corny speech
where he thanks everyone from his hometown for inspiring him while there
are numerous annoying side comments, and this scene is not the worst scene
in the film, well, that just doesn't leave a whole lot to recommend.</P>
