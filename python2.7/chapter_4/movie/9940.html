       WELCOME TO SARAJEVO
       --------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            GRADE: B</PRE>
<P>       Director Michael Winterbottom's new WELCOME TO SARAJEVO opens
       fiercely, with the kind of moment that snaps your eyes wide
       open and makes you remember what the movies can really be
       about. As a wedding party leaves a Sarajevo church, one of
       the members is shot dead by an unseen sniper. The group
       scatters. The bride runs away in slow motion, a vision in
       white. Cut to the press, a cadre of photographers and
       videographers huddled together at a semi-safe vantage,
       cameras clicking in a staccato fury. It's a footnote to
       history recreated in widescreen and Dolby stereo.
       Winterbottom stretches the moment just long enough for us to
       understand its subtext -- how important it is that somebody
       be present to take those pictures, lest this bombed-out city
       be forgotten by the Western world, and what it must mean to
       be a journalist, covering these horrifying everyday events
       but staying (at least in theory) at a clean remove, like a
       Wenders angel.</P>
<P>       If only the rest of the movie were as riveting, as demanding
       of our attention. WELCOME TO SARAJEVO has the makings of a
       small masterpiece, but it loses its way. It's a fascinating
       film, to be sure, even if Winterbottom does resort to such
       hardball tactics as cutting video footage of real Sarajevan
       casualties into the mix in order to focus our attention and
       our sympathies. That's fair play, I suppose, for a film that
       indicts the unresponsiveness of the Western world during the
       years when innocent men, women, and children were being shot
       dead and blown to bits on the streets of the Bosnian capital.
       ("We have to deal with 13 countries in the world which are
       worse than Sarajevo," a United Nations type tells the press
       corps at one point.) But it's used to enliven a film that
       doesn't muster a sufficient sense of outrage through its own
       drama. As social commentary, WELCOME TO SARAJEVO is acrid and
       spiky. As cinema, however, it becomes just a little bit dull.</P>
<P>       But it gets by on the strength of its convictions, not least
       of which was Winterbottom's determination to shoot on
       location, beginning in the post-war summer of 1996. If you're
       not familiar with the Bosnian conflict, this film will serve
       as a crash course on the hostilities as well as a record of
       the damage wrought on the city itself. In short, the Bosnian
       capital of Sarajevo was uniquely positioned to take the brunt
       of violence as the former Yugoslavia broke into independent
       nations. Sarajevo was caught in the crossfire as radical
       Bosnian Serbs began a campaign to cleanse Bosnia of Muslims.
       Although tensions between Serbians, Croations and Muslims
       have long sparked violence in the region, Sarajevo was a city
       where all three ethnic groups lived in close proximity, which
       fueled the fires as the war raged on. Eyewitnesses to the
       fighting in Sarajevo reported that neighbors were opening
       fire on one another.</P>
<P>       Based on the nonfiction book NATASHA'S STORY by British
       journalist Michael Nicholson (and "inspired by" actual
       events), WELCOME TO SARAJEVO is the story of the Western
       press corps living in the besieged city, struggling to
       galvanize the world's conscience against the fighting.
       Coverage of what became known as the "bread-line massacre,"
       for instance, when Bosnian Serbs bombed a group of Sarajevans
       waiting to buy bread, killing 16 and wounding many more, is
       shunted into second place on the news programs by the divorce
       of Andrew and Fergie.</P>
<P>       Modeled on Nicholson, Michael Henderson (Stephen Dillane) is
       particularly appalled at the world's reluctance to condemn or
       even acknowledge the continuing tragedy. And he's
       particularly drawn to the plight of Sarajevan children,
       especially those at an orphanage he discovers and focuses his
       energy on covering. "As long as the U.N. are here," he tells
       his colleagues, "I'm going to keep those kids on the screen.
       Every night, different child, same message: get me out of
       here." Like his real-world counterpart, Henderson will
       eventually take it upon himself to smuggle one of these
       children, Emira (Emira Nusevic), out of the country.</P>
<P>       Woody Harrelson plays Flynn, a cynical hotshot from America
       who steps into the story he's covering at one point, when he
       carries a wounded civilian out of the line of fire. Rounding
       out the ensemble are Emily Lloyd as a freelancer, Marisa
       Tomei as the American aid worker who wants to get the orphans
       out of Sarajevo, Kerry Fox (of SHALLOW GRAVE) as Henderson's
       producer, and Goran Visnjic as their driver. Much of the film
       depicts their everyday existence at a local hotel, where the
       procurement of a few eggs is cause for celebration. By the
       time Flynn shows up at the Holiday Inn with footage from Serb
       concentration camps -- which are bone-chillingly reminiscent
       of those *other* pain-stricken concentration camps -- the sense
       of outrage is complete.</P>
<P>       But since there must be a story, we're soon caught up in
       Henderson's scheme to get Emira out of the country. Welcome
       to Sarajevo gets certain things just right, like Henderson's
       wife's flabbergasted but understanding reaction to the news
       that he is bringing a Sarajevan orphan home with him. Even
       so, the film remains at a cool distance to these characters,
       never quite forcing our identification with either of them.
       Later, when it's discovered that Emira's mother is alive --
       and wants her back -- Henderson's inescapable journey back to
       Sarajevo is intriguing, but we're not emotionally involved in
       the story. These characters seem almost purely
       representational -- they're different types of people rather
       than people in their own right. I can't help but think a
       little more imagination in the screenwriting department might
       have helped flesh everybody out and make us closer witnesses
       to their desperation.</P>
<P>       Winterbottom is no stranger to the desperate situation. His
       two previous films to receive a U.S. theatrical release were
       the lesbian serial killer drama BUTTERFLY KISS and the Thomas
       Hardy adaptation JUDE, both of which leave you with the oddly
       satisfying feeling of having been whalloped in the midsection
       so hard as to have your breath knocked out of you. (He also
       directed the acclaimed GO NOW, starring Trainspotting's
       Robert Carlyle as an MS victim.) WELCOME TO SARAJEVO has a
       similarly lasting impact. The picture feels slight, and
       disappointingly understated as you watch it. But it's a
       persistent little film, and it sticks with you. Maybe this is
       what it would be like to really be there. Day by day, the
       sickening violence takes on a sameness, and the siege becomes
       unremarkable on its own terms. Still, it scars you. And when
       you leave this country, you're haunted for life by the ghosts
       of the Sarajevans.
