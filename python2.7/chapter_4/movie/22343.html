<P>A-
The television industry is a vicious world of circling sharks, a world
of death, violence, sex, manipulation, cynicism, and spite.  Paddy
Chayefsky's dark exposé of this industry, Network, is savage, hilarious,
and strangely powerful.  From it has come the famous cry, "I'm mad as
hell and I'm not going to take this anymore," screamed live on air by
Peter Finch's final character, the depressed and degraded
ex-anchor-gone-mad Howard Beale.  Chayefsky and one of the great
American directors, Sidney Lumet, show us a plethora of venomous and
interesting characters in a film that dares to explore not only the
corruption of electronic journalism, TV execs, and machinery, but also
the corruption of a generation polluted by the god-like, morbid minds on
screen.</P>
<P>Howard Beale (Finch) has just been fired from his anchoring job on the
struggling network UBS.  On the air, he refuses to go out without a
bang.  He announces he will commit suicide on television, for all to
see, and jokes about how this outburst will surely buoy the current, low
ratings of the news show.  Of course, the public and press react.
Everyone is either outraged or enlightened.  This may have been the
first time an anchor has shown his true, humanistic colors on the tube.
The public is interested.</P>
<P>On the next night, executives agree to keep Howard Beale on the show for
one day.  They expect him to apologize for his emotional eruption.  He
doesn't, though.  On UBS news that night, Beale decides to segue into a
tell-all, pessimistic tale of corruption and hypocrisy in our society.
He also uses the "Bs" word.  UBS News has sky-rocketed up the Nielsen
Ratings and, though it is clear to his friends (William Holden) that he
has lost his mind, the station keeps him as an anchor to better their
ratings.  The audience seems to be responding to Beale's seemingly
biblical proclamations because they seem so true.  Everyone has become
tired of happiness and people are willing to listen to the empowering
mockery of American culture Howard Beale and UBS News are providing.</P>
<P>One night, Beale, wet from the outside rain and in his raincoat and
pajamas, begins ranting his apocalyptic and trademark angst shout on TV,
"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!"  He urges his
viewers to get up from their chairs and go to the window.  He tells them
it is no use to change things when you're not as "mad as hell."  "You
have to get really angry first," he advises.  That night, the whole
nation screamed from their windows the furious cry of Howard Beale.</P>
<P>Faye Dunaway is Diana Christensen, the sexy and driven programmer of the
new Howard Beale show, a wrath-ridden, daily showcase of Beale's
newfound philosophies.  Max Schumacher (Holden), the original news
programmer, is fired because of his concern for his insane friend.
Diana and Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall), the power-hungry executive,
milk Beale of all he can offer and use him like a dog.  Beale has
commanded an entire culture to tune in every night and watch him
screaming about "truthful" issues.  He has reached the heights of an
American guru or idol.  He may even have replaced the role of God in
America.  He speaks of the illusion of power and the illusion of
television.  He is a good man who has exploded; he is sick and tired of
blood-thirsty hounds.</P>
<P>There is a very moving subplot in Network, one of infidelity that
involves Max, the middle-aged, helpless producer, and Diana, the
ruthless young programmer, in an affair.  We also see Beatrice Straight
in a very brief but brilliant performance as Max's wife.  We learn that,
beneath Diana's assured exterior, she is completely empty of human
emotion and is numbed to reality.  Max, who is going through a mid-life
crisis, gives a moving speech on his fear of death and how he used Diana
to rid this fear and, in turn, was used by her.  As a college student,
Diana had a great crush on Max when he gave a lecture at her university,
but now that her past infatuation has become a delusive relationship, we
realize that her exposure to the television culture has steered her life
in a superficial direction.  However, as Lumet pointed out in his great
book Making Movies, it is not the TV, a mere machine, that has corrupted
an entire generation and will corrupt many generations to come, but the
horrible minds on the screen that conquered the goodness of the people.
Diana is a woman who was raised on these corrupted minds and Max,
realizing this, flees the affair.</P>
<P>Network, with the guidance of Lumet and cinematographer Owen Roizman,
plunges us into an artificial world in which everything is based on the
dollar bill and the manipulation of a confused mass audience.  Not only
are the executives, programmers, and presidents of these stations at
fault for contaminating our souls, but we are as much at fault too, if
only because we have allowed ourselves to be persuaded by money-making
ideas that may seem novel at the time but, as Beale would say, are what
we could have find within ourselves.  No, Network is not a film of
immense, sappy coating.  It is brutally funny and relentlessly moving.
It gets its point across very well through its pungent darkness and
Chayefsky's amazing script.</P>
<P>The cast is heaven-sent.  Faye Dunaway is calculative and scheming and
she gives one of her best performances ever as Diana.  William Holden is
extremely impressive and affective as Max, giving probably the most
moving performance in the film.  Peter Finch won the Best Actor Oscar
posthumously for playing Howard Beale with the passion and anguish that
he did.  Beatrice Straight and Ned Beatty stand out in very small roles
with superbly written monologues.</P>
<P>Network, directed by the great man who brought us such masterpieces as
12 Angry Men and Dog Day Afternoon, is outrageous and campy.  The issues
of television corruption may be exaggerated (or may not be) but they are
not difficult to believe.  (*Spoiler*) When Howard Beale is killed at
the end for his show having network-threatening ratings, it is not
beyond belief.  A world of extortion and villainy is always capable of
stooping that low.  What Network may eventually make clear is that
people are able to go to such horrific, violent extremes for the simple
reason of money, but only when they have been hardened and made plastic
by the sinister coercion of illusions.</P>
