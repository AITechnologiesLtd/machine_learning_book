<P>"When I look back on my childhood, I wonder how my brothers and I 
managed to survive at all" is the first line of Angela's Ashes. As 
people look back on this film they too will wonder how they ever 
survived. The movie's biggest flaw is that the two and a half hour 
duration goes at the rate of a Leslie Nielson death scene. Misery does 
love company and this examination of Irish misery finds plenty of 
company so as not to leave this one aching flaw alone.20</P>
<P>Angela's Ashes must know just how uninteresting it is. There is no other 
explanation for what transpires in the first 30 minutes: three children 
die; the filmmakers resort to this oldest, most melodramatic technique 
not once, but three times. Then, as if the movie realizes that there are 
only so many characters who can pass away, the work ventures away from 
the morbid and tries to find a plot. But there is none to be found; so 
the deaths resume, just at a slower rate. Filling the now-longer gaps is 
Hollywood's second oldest emotional stunt: The Alcoholic Father.</P>
<P>Despite being absent a plot, Angelas Ashes does have a setting: Ireland 
during a time when students could openly ponder "What use is Euclid when 
the Germans are bombing everything in sight?" The production centers 
around a young boy and his family. The mother, Angela (Emily Watson who 
is far too plump for this poverty-stricken role), has no qualms with 
picking coals off the street to warm her often-sick family members. The 
father, Malachy (Robert Carlyle who's acting is quite possibly the only 
good part of the movie, even if it is just a reprisal of his role in the 
acclaimed The Full Monty) thinks otherwise, insisting "We're not 
beggars" and scolding "You have no pride, Angela." In reality, he is the 
one without pride who begs for money not to cloth his family but to 
provide the almighty "pint." On one occasion the narrator, Frank, 
comments of his father "A man who drinks the money for a new baby has 
gone beyond the beyonds." Get the picture? Good. That was 140 minutes in 
one paragraph. (And my editor says I'm not concise enough!)</P>
<P>Those not familiar with the IRA, Oedipus and "The Consumption" might 
struggle with what little this highbrow film has to offer. Those who 
prefer popcorn during their trips to the cinema might struggle with a 
guilt trip. Those fans of Monet might struggle to have any appreciation 
for a re-occurring scenery shot clearly ripped out of one of his 
paintings. Those of the non-anarchist persuasion might struggle with the 
film's anti-debt moral. Those with limited or even normal attention 
spans will struggle with the movie's length. Those that enjoy good films 
will struggle with the overall lack of quality. These struggles are not 
nearly as bad as the poverty depicted in Angela's Ashes, but there still 
is no reason to voluntarily subject yourself to them, much less pay for 
them.</P>
