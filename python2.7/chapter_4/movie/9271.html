<PRE>U-Turn
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1997 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Oliver Stone. Let's get it right up front and out of the way. That's what this
film is about. Oh, it may pretend that it has something to do with a
down-on-his-luck small time gambler running into the weirdest characters this
side of the Pecos, but this is the director's film. It says more about him
than it says about anyone on screen.</P>
<P>Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn) is driving through the Arizona wastelands with a bag
full of $30,000 to repay his gambling debt to Russian mobsters who have
already expressed their displeasure at his tardiness by cutting off two of his
fingers. A blown radiator hose lands him in the town of Superior, a lost
civilization that time forgot and peopled with an grotesque cast of rednecks,
Indians, millionaires and babes.</P>
<P>Pulling into a junkyard masquerading as a gas station, Cooper encounters
proprietor Darrell (Billy Bob Thornton) who reckons that he can fix the
vintage 1964 1/2 Mustang convertible. One look at Darrell's grease-covered
exposed pot belly, coke-bottle glasses and teeth that look as if they belong
in a medical specimen museum convinces you that he's going to fix something,
but it's more likely to be Bobby's wagon than his car. Things aren't made any
better when Cooper makes it clear who belongs where in the hierarchy of hicks
and city slickers.</P>
<P>At this point the gambler's fate is sealed, he just doesn't know it yet. To
kill time he decides to take in the town. When he meets Grace McKenna
(Jennifer Lopez), a sultry femme fatale whose body and lips promise anything
and everything -- but first the price, he quickly accepts her invitation to
come home to help her with some things.</P>
<P>Just as they are about to "hang drapes", Grace's husband Jake (a virtually
unrecognizable Nick Nolte) bursts into the bedroom. After knocking Cooper
around, he offers him a ride back to town.</P>
<P>When he asks him to kill his wife, Cooper replies "I'm not a murderer."</P>
<P>"How do ya know if you haven't tried it?" questions the grizzled millionaire.</P>
<P>His hunger is to do is leave town, but all he gets is trouble. Jake wants him
to kill Grace. Grace wants him to kill Jake. While in a grocery store, he
witnesses a robbery that results in two graphic shotgun killings. His money is
destroyed. A fifties-inspired bimbo (Clare Danes) wants to have his love child
and her equally anachronistic slick cowboy boyfriend TNT (Joaquin Phoenix)
would rather let his fists do the talking. Billy Bob Darrell thinks that a
radiator hose is worth a couple of hundred bucks. The hard-drinkin' sheriff
(Powers Boothe) keeps an open eye on the stranger.</P>
<P>It's not a pleasant community. In a town that looks to have about 500 people,
there are more hidden agendas than in the naked city.</P>
<P>The only almost friendly, albeit no less bizarre, face belongs to a blind
Vietnam vet Native American shaman (an even more unrecognizable Jon Voight)
who hauls around his dead dog and demands Dr. Peppers.</P>
<P>Based on John Ridley's "Stray Dogs", the most obvious aspect of the film is
Robert Richardson's cinematography. Jerky fast zooms and pans combined with
over-exposed grainy film stock work well to create an edgy uncomfortable
feeling in the audience. Although a bit too MTVesque for my tastes, it
certainly does what it is designed to do. It puts you into Cooper's frame of
mind: stark, frantic and desperate for the experience to end.</P>
<P>And that's one of the problems with the movie. It may be art, but it's often
not enjoyable. The quirky filming gets old after a while. There's not one
likable character in the story. The dark violent humor is uncomfortable;
you're unsure if you want to laugh or be disgusted. It's a bloody car wreck
with clowns strewn on the highway.</P>
<P>Stone has been on an eccentric road himself. From his marvelous "Platoon" and
"JFK" to the brutal "Natural Born Killers" and now to this, it's obvious that
he's looking for something. What it is, we can only guess. "U-Turn" is a
sideroad to excess, but hopefully he's gone to the extreme, found his muse and
is on his way back.</P>
<P>With Stone, even the mis-fires are worth experiencing and all we can do is
strap on our seatbelts and brace ourselves for the ride.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman, after over 22 years of writing this column, is probably going
to do it again next week. Email to <A HREF="mailto:mredman@bvoice.com">mredman@bvoice.com</A> will probably find him eventually.)</P>
