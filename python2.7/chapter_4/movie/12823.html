<PRE>SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS
(TOUCHSTONE)</PRE>
<P>RUNNING TIME: 1 HOUR 40 MINUTES.
STARRING HARRISON FORD, ANNE HECHE AND DAVID SCHWIMMER
DIRECTED BY IVAN REITMAN</P>
<P>    Director Ivan Reitman, who brought us the brilliant Ghostbusters (1984),
and the not so brilliant Fathers Day (1996), seems to back on good form with
this entertaining comedy. Anne Heche and David Schwimmer play happy couple
Robin and Frank, who take a holiday to a island of Tahiti. Robin works for a
magazine in New York, and when she is called back from the island for an
important photo shoot for the magazine, she has to use the services of Quinn
Harris's (Harrison Ford) airline. The two, obviously, don't get along, and
when Quinns plane crashes on a remote island, Quinn and Robin must learn to
get along for a few days. Comedy and mayhem, plus romance, occur, all in
true Hollywood fashion.</P>
<P>    Six Days, Seven Nights is light, breezy entertainment, which places no
demands on the viewer. Harrison Ford is surprisingly able at comedy, and is
pretty funny. His character is a cross between Indiana Jones and Bill
Murray, and comes off well. Anne Heche, Ellen DeGeneres girlfriend at the
moment, also proves to be fun, and luckily never starts to annoy.
Thankfully, there's also chemistry between them, making them a fun couple to
watch. David Schwimmer is good as Robin worrying boyfriend, and he tries
(and generally succeeds) to not be Ross from T.V's Friends. He also has the
funniest scene towards the end. So, Six Days, Seven Nights gets off to a
good start with funny actors. Director Ivan Reitman is also good, proving
competent with both the comedy/romance, and the action scenes. The comedy is
funny, and the action can get exciting.</P>
<P>    Writer Michael Riva may be cutting it a bit close with the Romancing The
Stone (1981) references, but generally the film breezes along. Sadly, the
script never reaches the high point the audience expects. Although it has
many opportunities, it never reaches quite the fever pitch the film should
achieve. Still, there's some good one liners, some tense action, and the
romance is never overly sentimental (mainly due to Ford's ruggedness.) Six
Days, Seven Nights also looks good, with the island looking pretty
impressive, and some nice special effects, especially during the storm which
causes Quinns plane to crash. There's also a good soundtrack, with a toe
tapping tropical feel, composed by veteran Randy Edelman.</P>
<P>    Six Days, Seven Nights, in the end, turns out to be a non demanding,
slightly cliched, yet always entertaining film, something Hollywood (and
especially Ivan Reitman) specialize in. In fact, the film is completely
crowd friendly, with a major star, undemanding jokes, romance and adventure.
Six Days, Seven Nights main aim appears to be to please everyone, and in the
end it does that. Although it's no classic, and 20 minutes after the film
you probably would have forgotten about it, while watching the film Six
Days, Seven Nights is loud, dumb and fun. Definitely worth watching. (Try to
watch it with a large crowd, it adds to the entertainment.)
OVERALL RATING=***1/2 OUT OF *****
