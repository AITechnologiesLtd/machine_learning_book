<P>   The best thing about "Bent" is that it adds to the wealth of
material available on the screen about the Holocaust. 
Focusing strictly on the Nazi purge of homosexuals which
occurred early on, in 1934, just after the election of Hitler to
power in 1933 and five years before the opening of World
War 2, "Bent" does for gays what the play "Good" did for old
people. It reveals the intolerance which the Aryan mentality
had for people it considered weak, immoral, or sick.  That its
principal character is also a Jew becomes relevant in the final
scene and has some resonance throughout, as Max (Clive
Owen), adamantly denying his homosexuality, has no problem
wearing the yellow star when he might have opted for the pink
triangle.</P>
<P>   Unlike "The Substance of Fire," a play which was quite
successfully and movingly translated into celluloid, "Bent"
appears difficult to decode from stage to screen, though
perhaps in the hands of another director, the technical
problems could have been resolved.  When Martin Sherman's
drama opened on Broadway seventeen years back, it moved
many in the audience to tears and elicited a review from the
New York Times 'Powerful and provocative," while Women's
Wear Daily called it "an explosive, overpowering experience. 
The power is lost in a naturalistic medium like the movies.  As
Greta, Mick Jagger sits on a large brass ring high above the
crowd of the cabaret belting out a mournful song about how
the city of Berlin will eat up its denizens--the kind of mise en
scene absolutely made for the stage but banal, even
unbelievable, on the big screen.  The one element of the
story which is improved by filming is the chase scene, though
Sean Mathias directs the panorama as a generic event.</P>
<P>   The opening scene at the cabaret is the movie's most
lavish, one designed to contrast with the bleakness of the
proceedings which occur later in a concentration camp. Max
is pictured as a charismatic fellow whose presence electrifies
those around him, as he works the room kissing several of
the people seated at one table, and attracts the attention of a
Nazi S.A. officer.  "Bent" touches upon an activity reminiscent
of big city bath-house exercises during the 1970s, as several
gays in the audience retreat to a dimly lit area for anonymous
sex--a grunt and groan escapade probably responsible for
earning the movie an NC-17 rating.</P>
<P>   When German officials, tipped off by Greta, raid Max's loft,
they slit the throat of their fellow officer who has besmirched
the uniform by engaging in homosexual activity and pursue
the fleeing Max and his partner Rudy (Brian Webber) into the
forest.  Captured and put on a train to Dachau, Max shows
his determination to survive by denying his friendship with
Rudy and beating him to death when so ordered.  At the
camp he meets Horst (Lothaire Bluteau), who declares his
love for Max, and scoffs at Max's refusal to wear the pink
triangle.  </P>
<P>   What is meant to elicit tears from the audience comes
across inadvertently as near-camp.  When Max and Horst
take their allowed three-minute break after a two-hour period
of moving rocks from one pile to another, they stand side to
side imagining what sex would be like.  Without even brushing
fingertips--two guards are constantly watching from the tower-
-they reach simultaneous orgasm.</P>
<P>   During the entire time Max and Horst move rocks
meaninglessly from one side of an outdoor area to another--a
scenario which takes up half the story--we get the impression
that Dachau was a camp built almost exclusively for them. 
There are virtually no other prisoners in sight: the cubicles in
which the doomed are allowed to sleep are populated by only
a handful of men.  Once again, this absence of population
would work just fine on the stage, where an audience can
easily suspend disbelief, but comes across as claustrophobic
on the movie screen.</P>
<P>   Ian McKellen is underutilized in the role of Max's uncle, a
homosexual who is married and urges Max to do the same to
put up a front during these repressive times.  Clive Owen and
Lothaire Bluteau do display a chemistry that convinces us that
they are lovers in spirit in this British production, filmed largely
in Scotland, about a little-known aspect of intolerance.  The
final tableau should please particularly the gays among the
viewers, Max's spectacular proclamation of pride in his true
identity.  Rated NC-17.  Running Time: 100 minutes.  (C)
