Susan Granger's review of "POKEMON THE MOVIE 2000" (Warner Bros.)</PRE>
<P>There's a sequel to last fall's "Pokemon" phenomenon revolving
around the Pokemon universe.  While the first, "Mewtwo Strikes Back,"
introduced all the participants, this has more adventure as a terrible
force threatens all life on Earth and the only one who can stop it is
a young trainer named Ash Ketchum, who proves that one person can
really make a difference. There are six new Pokemons, including Lugia,
a great hero who plays a key role in helping Ash restore balance to
the world. The plot revolves around a villainous, unscrupulous pokemon
collector who is after Lugia, who is rare and, therefore, quite
valuable to collectors. Legend has it that when three Pokemon -
Zapdos, Articuno and Moltres - are assembled, Lugia will appear. But,
as each globe is captured, the balance of nature is disrupted and
bizarre weather patterns emerge. Ash, Misty and their cohorts are
alerted to this danger when a sudden storm forces them to crash into
an island and soon setting the ecology of the planet to right becomes
everyone's quest. In Japan, where it was released last year, this film
was called "Poketto monsutaa: Maboroshi no Pokemon X: Lugia bakudan."
The rudimentary animation resembles the TV show and many familiar
characters from that series make an appearance, plus there's a music
score by Ralph Schuckett and John Loeffler. As an added bonus, there's
"Pikachu's Exploration Party," a cartoon short that precedes the
feature, much like "Pikachu's Summer Vacation." On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "Pokemon the Movie 2000" is a formulaic 4 -
appealing to those children who are crazy for Pokemons and quite
boring to those who aren't. Warner Bros. Pictures is once again
collaborating with Nintendo of America, so be aware that there are
lots of new toys to accompany this film.</P>
