<PRE>                          STAR TREK: GENERATIONS
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     STAR TREK: GENERATIONS is a real dog, without the excuses of the
other two dog "Star Trek" films: I (the first, apparently they didn't
know what they were doing) and V (directed by Shatner.)</P>
<P>     Who directed this film?  It is very Shatner-esque.  Captain Kirk
gets to show off his fighting skills, and even Picard seems to prefer
combat given the choice.  (He can go anywhere in the universe in time or
space, and he picks the one place that will allow him to have a fight
with another old guy.  Come on, please.)</P>
<P>     Another Shatner-esque touch: Picard and Kirk get to go to some
place that sounds great, and it turns out to be fake snow, dumb holiday
scenes complete with a Tiny Tim substitute, and K-Mart style holiday
clothes.  (Remember how the visit with "God" in "The Undiscovered
Country" turned out to be really stupid?) No wonder they don't mind
leaving.</P>
<P>     Most of the original Star Trek cast are sensibly absent from this
turkey.  Only Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov show up.</P>
<P>     So many familiar plot devices are screwed up that you wonder how
they're going to make another movie.  I won't give away the plot, such
as it is, by revealing any of this, but I suppose Star Trek VIII will
dedicate itself to undoing the damage done by its predecessor, like
Star Trek III. I just hope they don't resurrect you-know-who.</P>
<P>     "All Good Things..." is a far better film.  I wonder why the same
people who could make a good film like that could not get their act
together well enough to put together a film that would appeal to anyone
other than a Trekkie.</P>
<P>     There's really nothing to recommend in this film.  All the TNG
actors seem to be under the influence of either very bad direction or
some kind of depressants.  Perhaps they don't want to show up the
acting skills of their inferior counterparts from TOS.</P>
<P>     I have an idea.  Maybe Shatner got a clause in his contract
guaranteeing him a certain type of direction, and no acting any better
than his, in exchange for doing this film.  That could explain it.</P>
<PRE>     Don't go if you aren't a Trekkie.</PRE>
