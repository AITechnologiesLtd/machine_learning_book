<PRE>Finding Your Authentic Swing
The Legend of Bagger Vance</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Jack Lemon walks out onto the fairway and has a heart attack. During 
this surprisingly un-traumatic experience he relives (that is, narrates 
to us) a story about a mysteriously wise (perhaps mythical) caddy that 
comes to the aid of a broken man back during the great depression. The 
story is told in the style of mid-80's films (like "The Natural"): warm, 
big, movie-like. Nothing is all that real, but really swell nonetheless. </P>
<P>No artificial enemy torments our protagonists for tension (I found that 
refreshing). Well, there is a play at it early on, but most of the 
story's conflict rests squarely on Rannulph Junuh's struggle with 
himself. He's a first rate golfer, struck down in his prime (note the 
similarity to "The Natural") by war memories. The whole town of Savannah 
needs him to step up and play a big match against the two best golfers 
of the era. </P>
<P>Damon (as Junuh) plays fine enough, but you might think that Robert 
Redford would be a "Natural" for the part, in which case you wouldn't be 
surprised to learn Redford directs. Actually, the actor I think of as a 
young Redford came to my mind - Brad Pitt. And though Will Smith does a 
better job than anticipated of playing the wise old (er... young) caddy 
Bagger Vance, Morgan Freemon would have been the more obvious choice. 
Yeah, Pitt and Freemon - I'm sure of it. Aside from that, the other 
casting choices were excellent. J. Michael Moncrief stroking a better 
than par swing as the 10-year-old Jack lemon. </P>
<PRE>Schmaltzy, sure...
"God is happiest when his children are at play."
"Harmony of the ball and field."
"Let the swing choose you."</PRE>
<P>But hearty and hopeful too, and although it is structurally formulaic, 
the film goes several hundred yards in search of unformulaic details. </P>
<P>Rolling off the green on a few strokes, the picture lays the ball right 
in the hole a couple of times as well. Improvements could have been made 
by striking Junuh with a few more (and detailed) flashbacks of wartime 
misery. Also, I'd have woven that last dance into a thing of beauty 
rather than a loose end in need of tying. That said, in a gentle and 
warm kind of way, I enjoyed the film. Not over the top great, but 
decidedly above average. </P>
