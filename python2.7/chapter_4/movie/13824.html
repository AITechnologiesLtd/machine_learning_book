<P>        In a summer full of overlong epics like "Armageddon" and "The Mask
of Zorro," a modest quickie like "Halloween: H2O - Twenty Years Later" seems
refreshingly unpretentious. It takes almost as long to pronounce that
unwieldly title as it does to watch the movie. But here's a case in which
brevity is something of a handicap.
 There are actually some intriguing issues bubbling just below the
blood-spattered surface of "H2O," which brings back Jamie Lee Curtis of the
original two "Halloween" movies to restore some much-needed class to the
"slasher flick" genre, but the film's 85-minute running time leaves scores
of irritating unanswered questions and unresolved issues.</P>
<P> Alright, no one buying a ticket for "H2O" is going in expecting an
insightful study of human nature, but much of the movie's first hour devotes
itself to detailing the disturbing, fragile bond between Curtis' character
Laurie Strode and her 17-year-old son John (Josh Hartnett), which plays like
an Oedipal version of the Meg Ryan-Andy Garcia relationship in "When A Man
Loves A Woman." Still traumatized from her violent brushes with her
psychotic brother Michael Myers, Laurie now lives under the alias of Keri
Tate and oversees Hillcrest, an exclusive prep school. She's referred to by
John as a "functioning alcoholic," which apparently means she can pound
glasses of chardonnay at lunch, down a triple-vodka dinner and still have
the energy to harangue Hillcrest's useless security guard (LL Cool J).</P>
<P> Director Steve Miner, whose previous films include the clever
sleeper "Warlock," manages to sustain a fair level of tension as Laurie's
drink-induced hallucinations of Michael -- he's become her personal Baby Cha
Cha -- give way to the all-too-real thing, the chalky-faced killing machine
who shows up at school while the kids are away on a Halloween field trip.
While family counseling might have worked wonders for other siblings in
similar situations, Laurie and Michael prefer to resolve their differences
with big knives, heavy machinery and the always-reliable fireman's ax.</P>
<P> Curtis is both "H2O''s trump card and its biggest problem, the
trouble being that she does such a fine job of illuminating Laurie's hollow
shell of a life that we can't help but want to know more about her and how
she's managed to keep it together for as long as she has. There's
considerably more attention paid to characterization here than one would
expect in a horror film and that may cause "H2O" to seem slightly sluggish
to fans raised on the high energy and hip wit of the "Scream" movies.</P>
<P> Because Curtis takes so much care in establishing Laurie as a
fascinating, flawed woman, the slash-and-burn mayhem of the film's last 20
minutes (complete with 'victims' coming back from death's door) seems like
the writers' lazy way out of completing what could have been a much smarter,
more interesting script. There are enough flashes of intelligence in
"H2O" -- check out the music during Janet Leigh's big scene and the make of
the automobile she's driving -- to indicate everyone concerned could have
gone a bit further and pushed the boundaries of the genre a little more.
Unfortunately, the abrupt ending of "H2O" cuts it to the quick, making the
movie seem like a slow build-up to a puny pay-off.
