The Sweet Hereafter</PRE>
<PRE>(Canada, 1997)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 24 December 1998 with Linda for $8.75 at the Lincoln Plaza Cinema</P>
<P>Perhaps I am turning into a stone, but I was unmoved by *The Sweet
Hereafter*, although it is a beautifully filmed movie. Other reviewers
have described it as elegaic. While it does remind you of an elegy, how
many elegies run feature-length? </P>
<P>*The Sweet Hereafter* examines the lives of parents just after a fatal
accident in which a bus plunges through a guard rail, careens down an
embankment, and falls through the frozen surface of a lake in British
Columbia. </P>
<P>The story that drives the movie is the arrival of an attorney, Mitchell
Stephens (Ian Holm) who wants to push some of the grieving parents into
pursuing compensation, that perhaps somehow the senseless tragedy can be
blamed on someone or something; a careless school bus driver, or a faulty
bolt, or something. As if monetary compensation will make up for the loss
of fourteen children. This sort of lawsuit will gain him one-third of the
netted compensation. Also, it means he has to find the "right" sort of pa
rents to testify.</P>
<P>There are also two parallels to the main storyline. First, there is the
irony of Stephens appealing to parents when his own daughter, a drug
addict, is out of control and he can no longer do anything for her. Or, as
he put it, his love for her has become and anger something like "steaming
piss." Also, there is the parallel of the children's story of the Pied
Piper of Hamelin. This is one of the strongest points of the movie. A lot
of the parents in *The Sweet Hereafter* are hardly worthy of their
children, and there is a strong sense of not just sadness but punishment as
well.</P>
<P>Director Atom Egoyan does a good job of showing people after tragedy.
There is a strong sense of the Time Before and the Time After.
Unfortunately, from the beginning of the movie, it is difficult to follow
the timing of the story and the many flashbacks, as there is a lot of
jumping around. Holm is shown having a chance meeting on a plane--a friend
of his daughter--to whom he talks of his daughter's troubles. Where that
fits into the timing of the rest of the story is very difficult. </P>
<P>I think that because the story is told subtly, and because the characters
seem so low-key and almost stoic, it is hard to really empathize with
them. There is also the taboo of incest, a topic that should have evoked
more emotion, but Egoyan does a lot of filmus interruptus, and the
constant jumping around of flashbacks hurts the full development of
investing in the story and the characters. You are on the edge of tears,
and then suddenly, you are pulled out of the moment. Even when the
characters are fighting, as in the scene where Billy Ansell (Bruce
Greenwood) and Sam Burnell (Tom McCamus) disagree over having a group
lawsuit, there is no intensity. </P>
<P>A town losing 14 children in a tragedy undoubtedly changes that town
forever, and Egoyan shows the emptiness and sterility very well. It's just
a shame that it was not as moving as it could have been. *The Sweet
Hereafter* left me with the feeling of looking at the carcass of a
wrecked bus, but not knowing anything about the people who perished within
or the people who loved them. Feeling sorry for them is as difficult as
feeling sorry for the people of Hamelin. There is more after than before
to really build the sort of sympathy a movie like this surely wants to
achieve. </P>
<P>Written by Atom Egoyan, based on a novel by Russell Banks</P>
