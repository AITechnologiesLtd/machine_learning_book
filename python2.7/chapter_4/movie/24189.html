<P>     Love for the game of basketball -- and for women's basketball in
particular -- fills virtually every frame of Gina Price-Bythewood's LOVE
AND BASKETBALL. The first-time filmmaker grasps the frustrations of female
athletes struggling against societal expectations and limited
opportunities to make their passion part of their lives. She gets inside
the head of a basketball player as she makes split-second game decisions. 
She even does something I never expected to see in a sports film,
something that sent this hoops purist into a rapture: She has her heroine
win a big game not by taking the last shot, but by taking an offensive
foul.</P>
<P>     Yes, Gina Price-Bythewood knows her ball, and she knows the
psychology of women who love the game. She knows them well enough that it
makes up for the sluggish narrative to which she attaches them. The story
begins in 1981, where the Wright family moves in next door to the McCall
family in their Los Angeles neighborhood. Middle-school hoops junkies
Quincy McCall (Glenndon Chatman) and Monica Wright (Kyla Pratt) instantly
develop a competitive love-hate relationship, one that reaches full bloom
when Quincy (Omar Epps) and Monica (Sanaa Lathan) excel for their high
school teams. That relationship turns more to love than hate in college,
but their personal lives begin colliding with their hoop dreams. While
Quincy's desire to follow in his father Zeke's (Dennis Haysbert) footsteps
to the NBA is complicated by a startling revelation, Monica's professional
aspirations collide with notions of femininity espoused by her housewife
mother (Alfre Woodard) and even Quincy himself.</P>
<P>     LOVE AND BASKETBALL gets off to an appealing start with the
adolescent tug-of-war between Quincy and Monica. There's a nice scene in
which the two 11-year-olds go from first kiss to knock-down brawl in the
space of a few seconds, neatly summarizing the competitiveness that will
sabotage their mutual attraction. Price-Bythewood is interested most
strongly in the second-class status of women athletes, and the fierce 
attitude Monica develops as she struggles with the tacit disapproval of
her mother and the awareness that her quest to be a pro may be over before
it begins. Sanaa Lathan does a wonderful job as Monica, capturing the
moping tomboy, the uncertain teenager and the ever-more-confident athlete
with strength and grace. It takes a special performance to lend
credibility to wild swings of emotion. Lathan nails every twist in
Monica's life journey.</P>
<P>     Monica is such a dynamic individual presence that she overwhelms
almost everything else in LOVE AND BASKETBALL. In theory, the film follows
the careers of both Quincy and Monica equally, but it's always evident
where Price-Bythewood's heart is. Quincy's character is far less
interesting from the outset, since he's already a high school star. When
Quincy and Monica get together, Price-Bythewood lets Quincy off the hook
by not exploring the blow to his ego when Monica's fortunes begin to
eclipse his own. Nearly every time Quincy or his family are drawn into the
story, there's a palpable loss of energy, a more predictable arc to the
drama. The "love" part of LOVE AND BASKETBALL starts to feel tacked on for
the sake of convention. Making it a story with two equal protagonists
repeatedly makes it evident that Price-Bythewood doesn't understand Quincy
nearly as well as she understands Monica.</P>
<P>     LOVE AND BASKETBALL is structured in four time period segments over
some dozen years, each segment identified as a basketball "quarter." By
the time the film draws to a close after two hours, you may feel as though
it has gone into at least one overtime. Gina Price-Bythewood builds a
sense of the epic into the relationship between Quincy and Monica, but
there's always the sense that it would have been much more effective as a
smaller, more intimate story. It's a very good film when it focuses on one
woman's attempt to create a happy personal life that also includes the
game she loves; it's pretty mediocre when it tries ineffectively to give
equal time to the men. It may be my long-standing affinity for women's
basketball talking, but I wanted a film about the one character in which
the filmmaker clearly had the most emotional investment. Women finally
have a basketball league of their own; it shouldn't have been too much to
ask to give them a basketball movie of their own.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 hoop (skirt) dreams:  6.</PRE>
