<PRE>"I Know What You Did Last Summer" Offers Few Memories

<P> The camera zooms in incredibly close .  It focuses on the closed eyes
 of a person presumed dead.  All of a sudden, with a thunderous sound
 effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse, his eyelids open.  The
 camera zooms in incredibly close.  It focuses on one of the characters
 desperately running for her life.  Then, with a thunderous sound

 The camera zooms in incredibly close.  It focuses on a door from where
 seemingly strange sounds emanate.  All of a sudden, with a thunderous
 sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse, the doors swing open
 to reveal what's inside.</P>
<P> Close-up thrill-shots such as these seemed to elicit more laughter
 from the audience rather than genuine fear, which is a pretty good
 sign that you're not watching the thriller that the director had
 originally envisioned.  Rather, you adopt the opinion that the
 characters are so goofy and so unaware of the trouble that they're in,
 that you stop caring about who lives, who dies and where the story
 goes.  Instead, you become more interested in how the characters get
 killed off.   </P>
<P> The four young teenagers who are the potential sacrificial lambs for
 this movie are  Helen and Barry and Julie and Ray - two couples and
 dear friends to one another.  During the summer just after high school
 graduation, they take a fateful drive down a dark mountain highway.
 Suddenly, without warning, their car hits someone whom the teens
 presume was killed as a result of that collision.  Fearing jail time
 and possible manslaughter charges if they confess, they instead decide
 to dump the body into the ocean and make a pact never to discuss the
 episode again.  A year goes by and things among the four friends begin
 to change.  Relationships fizzle, future dreams crumble, and attitudes
 change.  But, they can not forget what they did.  And apparently,
 neither can someone else.  Someone begins to send letters to all four
 of the teens with the frightening message: "I know what you did last
 summer."  The letter-writer (a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a
 large metal hook) soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt
 down the four teens.  It's now up to the four of them to try to figure
 out who the killer is before it's too late.  </P>
<P> While this movie has some nice visually eerie effects, too much of
 it's impact had to be generated with extreme close-ups, while the
 level of suspense was choppy at best.  There is so much more that this
 movie could have been, but decided to give us nothing but cheap
 thrills.  It could have been a clever whodunit, but discovering who
 ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders.  It could
 have explored the changed friendships after a year of adulthood, but
 seemed to only include that aspect to add 15 more minutes to the film.
 It could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime you're
 alone and you see shadowy figures moving about, you don't walk towards
 them yelling "hello".  Once you yell "hello", you can expect an
 extreme close-up, a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding
 musical pulse.  It's difficult to be in suspense when you know what's
 about to happen.  The only redeeming aspect of the movie is that I now
 have a neat idea for a Halloween costume, but I'm not sure if the
 local costume store sells rubber slickers and hooks.  The horror that
 I experienced from this film is realizing that I actually went to see
 it.</P>
