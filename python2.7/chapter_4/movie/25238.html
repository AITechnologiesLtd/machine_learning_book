<P>"Up at the Villa" is a strange movie experience, possibly because such a polite film of manners and delicacy switches gears and becomes something other than what you might expect. It has the grandly theatrical look and feel of 1999's "An Ideal Husband" but it develops into something akin to an Agatha Christie mystery.</P>
<P>Kristin Scott Thomas stars as the widowed, highly composed Mary Panton who locks herself inside a beautiful villa, often contemplating her lack of passion while sitting out in her garden (my, my, how great it must be to rich). Mary is unsure of whether she should accept a marriage proposal from a courtly diplomat (James Fox) but she has to have an answer soon since he is going on a trip (and gives her a gun to protect herself from the roaming refugees on the streets). She leans more towards a married, debonair American (Sean Penn), though she resists him at first due to his honesty. Then there is the pity she feels towards a young, poor Austrian violinist (Jeremy Davies) who is also a refugee. One thing leads to another and when she tries to resist the young, passionate fellow, things get rather awry. </P>
<P>This is where the big switch in tone and style comes in, and "Up at the Villa" becomes more of a moral tale where immorality takes the day. Yes, immoral, considering the choices Mary makes when confronted with danger. A film like this would not have existed during the Production Code days where protagonists had to be punished for their crimes. Mary and the American get involved in a crime that evolves into a highly political situation - even the Italian police are corrupt. </P>
<P>The performances deliver for the most part, all very classy acts to be sure. Kristin Scott Thomas has a difficult role, exuding sensuousness, duplicity and beauty all in one package, often at the most inappropriate moments. Still, she has class and elegance and maturity - though not at the same breath as in "Angels and Insects" (directed by Philip Haas who helmed this one as well). Anne Bancroft is the gossip-mongering neighbor married to Italian royalty who is as freewheeling and flirtatious as they come. Sean Penn is the added sparkle to this fine cast, his nuance and diction are as far removed from "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" as you might expect, and he is far more restrained than he usually is. He also has the right flair and chemistry in any scene he shares with Scott Thomas. Kudos must also go to Derek Jacobi's brief role as a flamboyant tour guide of sorts.</P>
<P>"Up at the Villa" is an uneven film, never quite finding the consistent tone that it needs, but it is slick and involving enough. Sometimes, pictaresque settings and Kristin Scott Thomas wearing any colorful wardrobe she chooses is often enough for me. "Up at the Villa" has plenty of both.</P>
