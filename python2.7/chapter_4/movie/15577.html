<PRE>                             A BUG'S LIFE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Our second animated ant film of the
          season edges out the first for humor and actual
          animation style.  A BUG'S LIFE has a mediocre
          story-line, seemingly derived from Kurosawa's SEVEN
          SAMURAI, but its animation will dazzle the eye.
          This film offers adults a little less plot and
          characterization than did ANTZ, but the visuals are
          better and jokes are funnier.  Don't miss the
          closing credit sequence.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low
          +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Let's get the expository lump out of the way at the beginning.
All bugs are insects but not all insects are bugs.  Bugs have tube-like
mouthparts and wings that are joined to the body in a sort of thickened
area. Scientists call them "Hemiptera."  Ants, walking sticks, and
certainly spiders are not bugs.  And to further correct, ants have six
legs as we saw in ANTZ (well, sort of), not four as portrayed in A
BUG'S LIFE.  And speaking of inaccuracies, in my review of ANTZ I said
that Pixar and Disney might have to look to their laurels to match the
animation quality of ANTZ.  Well I was wrong; Pixar and Disney are
doing just fine, thank you.  A BUG'S LIFE actually is the more visually
sophisticated of the two animated films, but each has far surpassed TOY
STORY.  There may be more animated figures in some scenes in ANTZ, but
Pixar has the edge on life-like animation and in giving a three-
dimensional look.  They have also made some perceptive improvements in
digital representation light and surface texture.  Facial animation is
also better. In fact looking at the faces of the grasshoppers as they
talk, they really have more texture than a camera would pick up looking
at a real grasshopper.  They have gone into a kind of hyper-reality,
much like the saturated Technicolor of musicals of the 50s created a
sort of hyper-reality.  But since people get a little squeamish looking
too closely at real insects, Pixar seems to reserve this over-texturing
for the villainous grasshoppers and there to make them a somewhat more
repulsive foe.</P>
<P>     Where A BUG'S LIFE has a problem is that it has a less
sophisticated or interesting plot than either TOY STORY or ANTZ.  The
plot is directly or indirectly a rehash of the late Akira Kurosawa's
SEVEN SAMURAI.  The ants of Ant Island could live very well if they
were not obliged to pay a heavy tribute of food each year to a
ferocious band of grasshoppers.  In the colony ant Flik has many ideas
how to do things differently-he even has ideas for how to deal with the
grasshoppers.  The catch is that none of his ideas seems to work very
well.  Flik's idea for how to deal with the grasshoppers is to get
bigger bugs to fight for the ant colony.  So the colony decides to send
someone to find defenders.  And who do they choose?  The ant they can
most spare, Flik.  Our intrepid ant finds defenders, but does not
realize that they are not fighters but flea circus performers.  With
Flik's ideas and with the aid of what they think of as fighter insects,
the colony prepares to defend itself against the cruel grasshoppers.
The grasshopper leader is the nasty Hopper, voiced with real menace by
Kevin Spacey.</P>
<P>     It is tempting to compare this film's weaker plot but impressive
visuals with the current trend of sci-fi films being taken over by
special effects.  But many respected classic films did much the same.
Busby Berkley musicals had real visual style but had relatively bland
and cliched plots.  Then as so frequently now the entertainment was in
what the audience saw, not what the film said.</P>
<P>     It is worthwhile to see A BUG'S LIFE just to see how the animation
technology is progressing. If the story- line is weak at least there
are moments of really good humor, though many are in the closing
credits. It would be interesting to know if ANTZ eats into the profits
of A BUG'S LIFE.  ANTZ seems to have been timed to do just that, but if
so it may have been a miscalculation.  The two films dealing with the
one non- conformist ant in the colony could co-exist at the box-office
much like DEEP IMPACT and ARMAGEDDON have.</P>
<P>     I would rate A BUG'S LIFE a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on
the -4 to +4 scale.  There are a few scenes that could be frightening
to younger children.</P>
<P>     This film has been released with the short film "Geri's Game"
which won Pixar an Oscar.  It is a funny little short of an old man
playing chess with himself in the park.  It humorously makes the point
that playing chess with yourself as an opponent is not really like
playing a different person.  Actually it could almost be a study of
schizophrenia, though I think that is reading more into the short than
Pixar intends.  One of the more interesting aspects of "Geri's Game" is
to see how far Pixar has progressed in representing computer animation
of human figures.  It is one thing to represent in animation toys and
insects with their rigid surfaces, but it is harder to represent humans
realistically.  Human characters were kept to a minimum in TOY STORY
and are not present at all in A BUG'S LIFE.</P>
<P>     I have one question about the closing credits.  (Hopefully this
will be meaningless to anyone who has not seen the film.)  How genuine
is what we are hearing?  The joke is obviously that the visuals are
false, but the audio track may be genuine.</P>
