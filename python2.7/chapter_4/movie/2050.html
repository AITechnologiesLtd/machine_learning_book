<PRE>                                RESERVOIR DOGS
                        A film review by Michael Har-even
                         Copyright 1993 Michael Har-even</PRE>
<P>     Even though RESERVOIR DOGS is the first film of director-writer
Tarantino, I would like to evaluate his work.  The most striking thing
in the film is the mixture of events from the present and the past.
The pre-crime and crime sequences are not flashbacks, their main
purpose is not to explain but rather to increase the dramatic tension.
Those events are assembled by the author of this film as another mean
of expression.  We might even say that this process is super-editing or
even super-montage of a whole film.</P>
<P>     Another quality of this film is the lack of psychology.  All the
characters are flat and the only important matter is the action and not
the reason.  This is one of the reasons why the last scene is already a
myth.  In fact, we know almost nothing about each character.  The only
exception is the police agent and I am not sure that it is justified.
The difficult violence is mingled with humor.  This mixture is not only
original but it is also being used to increase the total realistic
effect.</P>
<P>     Tarantino is an excellent writer and a talented director.  The
main problem is his inability to control the medium totally.  Most of
the scenes on the film are theatrical yet the decor is monotone.  The
lighting could be improved and there is no order (or purposeful
disorder) in the cinematography.  For example, the dazzling movements
of the camera on the dialogue scenes remind an experiment of a cinema
student.  Naturally, Tarantino has no experience so we have to forgive
him.</P>
<P>     His next film will be the true test of an artist.  If he continues
to be obsessed with violence at the expense of form, in the best case
he will be just another good American director like Scorsese or
Coppola.  In the worst case, he will be merely an imitator.  By
forgetting all his idols and by challenging the limits of cinema, his
true self might be exposed.  After all, I hope he wants to become more
than just a fucking professional!</P>
