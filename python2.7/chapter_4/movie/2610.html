<P>Viewered at San Francisco Film Festival, May 9, 1994</P>
<P>Rating: Scale 1-10 (10 = highest) 9
Must be viewed on large screen, video is inconceivable.</P>
<P>     A film I recommend with reservations: I was enthralled, but the
typical filmgoer, without advance warning or program notes, would find
this offering about as exciting as watching paint dry.  Sokurov has
created an almost wordless visual poem ... compelling, watery dream-like
images, with subliminal sounds of half-heard conversations and rushing
water leaking in.  Orthogonal camera distortion, murky still images,
matted backgrounds and miniatures create a world that taps heavily from
the universal race consciousness, a heavy dose of deja vu will set in
as you "remember" images that nearly every citizen of the western world
has experienced in universal dreams and nightmares.</P>
<P>     WHISPERING PAGES is based on "images" from 19th Century Russian
novels.  A scrap of plot, with nameless characters, involves a
Dostoyevski-esque tragic hero who's evidently murdered an old woman to
collect on her estate.  A waif-like heroine, reduced to prostitution,
is so ethereal that you suspect she may be a figment of his
imagination.</P>
<P>     The 77 minutes pass quite slowly, with some camera pans (e.g. from
the top to the bottom of a statue) taking nearly five minutes.  It's
not a bore, though.  The alert viewer will catch occasional freezes
into a still shot, and a watery drifting in and out of color.  The film
is a brilliant textbook on camera technique; required viewing for any
serious students of world cinema.  Your appreciation will increase if
you're also a fan of German Silent films.  Many of the overhead shots
of murky urban miniatures bear a startling resemblance to the workers
quarters in METROPOLIS.  At times the camera lens is so distorted that
the crooked alleyways resemble the twisted sets of CABINET OF DOCTOR
CALIGARI.  A bureaucrat who administers red-tape surrounding the old
woman's estate is identical to the police clerks in CALIGARI.  All
that's missing are the elevated desks and chairs.  Long shots of the
hero, in supplication in his cell-like apartment, chill the blood as
much as the infamous camera shot receding from the tragic Emil Jannings
in THE LAST LAUGH.</P>
<P>     WHISPERING PAGES, though, is far from being a silent film; the use
of sound is brilliant.  Through the film, there is the constant sound
of water; running through pipes, rushing by opaque windows, dripping.
You can almost "hear" the omnipresent vapors.  In a chalky image of
birds hovering above the river's surface, we hear the heart-like beat
of wings.</P>
<P>     The lead actor, Alexander Cherednik, is lanky, and very
Christ-like in appearance.  Unless you notice that his fingers have
mysteriously elongated, several encounters with a distortion lens
during his scenes may escape your notice.  This film has many searing
visual images, that match the greatest moments of German Silent Cinema;
for instance, when Cherednik awakens under the monstrous statue of a
lioness and sucks on her teat.  Camera pointed at ceiling, with
severely distorted lenses makes a four-story stairwell appear like
something from a medieval miniature; we see nameless characters
climbing over the rail, and plunging, in slow motion, into an abyss.
Doors open onto plunging shafts.  Exterior shots of tenements on the
river reveal ladders and stairs that end in mid-air.  Much of the
imagery is nightmarish and unforgettable.</P>
<P>     Experiencing the film is a bit like being in a convincing seance,
summoning up images from a the world of the dead.  You feel like a time
traveler, drifting, ghost-like, in the netherworlds of Russian poverty
sometime around the 1830s or 1840s.  You'll derive an almost
voyeuristic thrill in picking up snatches of conversation that you
weren't intended to hear.</P>
<P>     If this type of film or subject matter interests you at all, I
encourage you to alter your calendar to accommodate it's rare
showings.  Like the watery, ghost-like images it contains, sadly, this
film won't see the light of day for long in our channel-surfing world.
Ironically, unlike most current popular films, which evaporate from
your memory by the time you get to the parking lot.  WHISPERING PAGES
leaves indelible images floating before you vision upon waking the next
day.</P>
