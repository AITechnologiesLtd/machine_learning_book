<PRE>                       THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS
                       A film review by Rick Pali
                        Copyright 1997 Rick Pali</PRE>
<P>Supposedly based on a true story in which the British drive to build a rail
bridge deep in Africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing
off the workers in 1898. John Patterson (Val Kilmer), the bridge building
expert set to oversee the operation, tried to rid his operation of the
lions, but fails. A world renound hunter, Remington (Michael Douglas), is
called in and the battle, man against lion, begins. </P>
<P>This film has a great soundtrack, and wonderful scenery. The acting is not
too bad except the characters are all so thin. We only see one side of each
character. Kilmer is a bridge builder and that's all we see him as. These
lions kill dozens of his men and he doesn't even appear to be too upset
about it.</P>
<P>And the plot? It's Jaws, but with lions. Again we're presented with an
animal that behaves not at all as it should. It appears to kill men because
it just likes too. Why? Who knows. I guess there wouldn't be much of a
story if it didn't. The problem is that there isn't much of a story even
though it does.</P>
<PRE>** (out of five)
