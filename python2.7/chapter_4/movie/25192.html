"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>The ads for Jim Carrey's new film announce he's going `from gentle to
mental.' The slogan refers to Carrey's character in Me, Myself & Irene,
the new comedy from the dick/shit joke factory known as the Farrelly
brothers, but it could just as easily apply to the $20 million man's
decision to sign on to Irene.  He's reverted from (near) Oscar-worthy
performances to the type of hyperactive, lowbrow comedy that made him a
star.</P>
<P>In Irene, Carrey (Man on the Moon) plays Charlie, a well-adjusted Rhode
Island State Trooper complete with typical cop moustache. Described as a
really nice guy, Charlie also has a beautiful girlfriend named Layla
(Traylor Howard, Two Guys and a Girl), and the film opens with the happy
couple getting hitched. But things start to unravel for Charlie pretty
quickly, as he gets his ass kicked by Shonte (Tony Cox, Friday), the
newlyweds' genius black midget limo driver.</P>
<P>But that's just the tip of the iceberg, as far as Charlie's troubles are
concerned. Nobody takes him seriously, from the neighbor that steals his
newspaper, to his co-workers, to the citizens he's supposed to serve and
protect. Oh, and there's the little matter of the severely tanned
triplets that Layla has given birth to. Their names are Jamal, Lee
Harvey and Shonte, Jr. - you do the math. Layla eventually leaves
Charlie and the kids to live alone in their garage-sized house.</P>
<P>As a result of the entire world walking all over him, Charlie develops
another personality - a rude, no-nonsense bad-ass named Hank - that
emerges in a very funny scene set in a supermarket. As you can imagine,
Carrey plus a split personality equals a lot of nifty physical comedy
that nobody else in the world would be able to pull off. There's a scene
toward the end where Charlie is fighting Hank (or vice-versa), and
Carrey does such a good job, it almost looks fake.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Irene doesn't quite measure up to any of the three
previous Farrelly brothers' films (There's Something About Mary, Kingpin
and Carrey's Dumb and Dumber). The main problem is with a convoluted
storyline involving a woman named Irene (Renée Zellweger, The Bachelor)
who Charlie/Hank must escort from Rhode Island to Massena, New York.
Irene is embroiled in some sort of big business/police cover-up deal
that's way too detailed for this kind of film.  And there are no
bust-your-gut-laughing scenes, like the Stiller vs. Dog set piece in
Mary.</P>
<P>As a result, the film is flat in too many spots, and wastes time setting
up its unnecessarily complicated plot when it could have had more gags
about feces and urine. Irene was originally supposed to be about Siamese
twins (played by Carrey and Woody Allen) that fall for the same girl,
but that idea was scrapped when Allen didn't sign on to the project. The
Farrellys dusted off an old script that they co-wrote with an old friend
(Mike Cerrone - he plays a police officer, too).</P>
<P>Like the previous three Farrelly films, Irene is chock-full of offensive
material that is bound to piss a lot of people off. But the Farrellys
are equal opportunity offenders and leave no stone unturned. They mock
blacks, albinos, lesbians and just about any other group you can attach
a name to. And there are sight gags a-plenty (like Charlie crammed onto
the couch with his three gigantic black sons), which leaves Zellweger as
the straight man in all of her scenes with her real-life beau Carrey (I
think she sets some kind of film record for the most number of
horror-struck double takes).</P>
<P>Irene is narrated by Rex Allen, Jr., who, like William Preston Robertson
in Raising Arizona and Sam Neill in The Big Lebowski, uses a slow
Southern drawl to tell the story via flashback. The film also features
cameo appearances by tennis pin-up princess Anna Kournikova and former
Boston Bruin puck-head Cam Neely. Sadly, Farrelly staple Lin Shaye
(she's the one who French-kissed the dog in Mary) appears briefly in
only one scene.</P>
<P>1:56 - R for strong sexual content, crude humor, adult language and
violence</P>
