<PRE>                            NICK OF TIME 1995
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Johnny Depp, Christopher Walken, Roma Maffia, Charles S. Dutton,
Marsha Mason Director: John Badham Screenplay: Patrick Sheane Duncan</P>
<P>As the minutes tick away, we get older each day. This is a ‘real time'
movie so let's do this review real time.</P>
<P>12.00pm Depp arrives at the train station with his daughter.
(The door bell rings, it's the Jehovah Witnesses. Oh no not again!)</P>
<P>12.15pm Walken and companion kidnap Depp and his daughter. ‘Kill the
governor, or your little girl dies!'
(Phone call. It's a survey on cars. Do I like B.M.W.s, Mercedes, or
Porsches? I like Toyotas thank-you very much).</P>
<P>12.30pm Depp arrives at the hotel with Walken breathing down his neck.
(Time for a toilet break.)</P>
<P>12.45pm The Governor's in the lift. Here's Depp's opportunity to shoot
her, but the gun's not loaded.
(What shall I have for lunch? Pizza? Kentucky? MacDonald's? Oh what the
heck let's go Italian.)</P>
<P>1.00pm Ooops. Depp's just missed his second opportunity to kill the
governor. The conspiracy unfolds.
(Pause button. Home made Italian -  Bolognese in the microwave. Ugggh!)</P>
<P>1.15pm Depp and the governor have a heart to heart at gun point.
(Dry cleaning, groceries, return the videos and work tomorrow! And
there's still a million and one things to do today.)</P>
<P>1.30m Finale. Finally.
(Now of to the gym before it closes for renovations, and I got there in
the nick of time!)</P>
<P>Ever feel like you were being rushed to finish something. Well that's
what this movie feels like. Too much time focussed on the clock ticking
away, and not enough time spent thinking through the mechanics of the
movie.</P>
<P>Solid performances by Depp and Walken. An original concept, and
occasionally tense.</P>
