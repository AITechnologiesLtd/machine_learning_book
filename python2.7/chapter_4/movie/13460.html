<PRE>WAYNE'S WORLD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(1992) US, 95 mins</PRE>
<P>THE CREDITS: Director: Penelope Spheeris; Starring: Mike Meyers, Dana
Carvey, Rob Lowe, Tia Carrere</P>
<P>THE VERDICT: You know something, people? I just *love* this film! Party on!</P>
<PRE>THE RATING (out of 5): * * * *</PRE>
<P>Despite being yet another entry into the American Teenage Airhead (tm)
genre (ala BILL AND TED), WAYNE'S WORLD is a resounding triumph. For a film
based around two brainless idiots, it's actually surprisingly intelligent -
the writing is sharp, the jokes witty and the script is packed with
well-observed parodies and social comment.</P>
<P>The film is a visual feast of gags, and the come fast and furious. Forget
the plot, because there's really not that much to it, but it's executed
with such energy, enthusiasm, wit and finesse, that WAYNE'S WORLD is a
winner - big time! Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey star as two "himbos", Wayne
and Garth, who run a cheap, tacky (and supposedly funny!) public access TV
show which is picked up by a big network (headed by the slimey Rob Lowe)
with the intent to exploit it. The plot does afford some clever satire with
regard to the scruples (or lack thereof) of television advertising, but it
plays second fiddle to some inspired performances and some genuinely
hilarious gags. Myers does a great job as ageing teenager Wayne, and Ron
Lowe is suitable sleazy as the double-crossing network exec, but it is Dana
Carvey who steals the show as the geeky Garth! He gets some wonderful
moments and some of the best lines - and there's a hysterical sequence
where he sings "Foxy Lady".</P>
<P>WAYNE'S WORLD is one of the most inventive, consistently funny and
downright endearing comedies I've seen in a long time. Needless to say,
it's also responsible for a number of phrases that have since crept into
our everyday vocabulary! Sch-wing! </P>
