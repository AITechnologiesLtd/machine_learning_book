MONARCH
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>MONARCH is an atmospheric tale of plotting and intrigue set during one 
of those classic dark and stormy nights.  This "god-forsaken night" 
occurs during the last year of the reign of Britain's King Henry VIII in 
1547.  Having the claustrophobic feel of a filmed play, which it 
apparently is not, the movie takes place within the confines of a few 
sparsely furnished rooms of a large manor house, which is surprisingly 
guarded by only one young man, Will (Mark Montgomerie).</P>
<P>Written, directed, produced and edited by John Walsh, the movie creates 
handsome images but has trouble crafting a compelling story.  The plot 
has the aged king being attacked, injured and taken to the manor house.  
Since only the king is hurt and no money is taken, the six aides who 
accompany him assume that it must have been a failed assassination 
attempt.</P>
<P>These six aides are quintessential court schemers.  Lurking in the 
shadows of the house they speculate on who is plotting against whom 
about what.  Looking similar and dressed in identical black robes, the 
actors play almost interchangeable parts.  Jean Marsh, in Henry's 
hallucinations, shows up in a cameo as the amalgamation of all of his 
wives.</P>
<P>At one point the movie looks like it may turn into something akin to THE 
TEN LITTLE INDIANS, but, alas, it is never that exciting.  Instead, the 
movie just drifts until daybreak ends the story.  Most of the movie is 
as obvious as its metaphors.  "There is always something rotten at the 
core," one of the king's aides tells Will after they make him bite into 
a worm-infested apple.</P>
<P>Although it is handsomely filmed and reasonably acted, the movie's most 
memorable moments come from the rain and wind.  It's not a good sign 
when the best parts of a drama are the sound effects.</P>
<P>MONARCH runs 1:39.  It is not rated but would be an R for a few scenes 
of violence.  It would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
