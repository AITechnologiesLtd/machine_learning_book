<PRE>A Review of Alien Resurrection</PRE>
<P>Tagline: "Witness the Resurrection (of another bad Alien sequel)"</P>
<P>Not learning much from the lesson of letting a Frenchman make a sci-fi film
after $80 million disaster THE FIFTH ELEMENT, Twentieth Century Fox once
again hires Luc Besson to destroy yet what could've been another science
fiction classic, the $70 million ALIEN RESURRECTION.  At least they saved
about $10 million this time around.   In order to payback its hefty budget,
the fourth installment of the formerly popular series attempts to resurrect
not only Sigourney but also the elements of the first two films that made
the franchise a critical and financial success. Granted, the heavy-duty
action of ALIENS and the claustrophobic terror of the original ALIEN are
present in RESURRECTION.  They even throw in an obligatory butt
scene--reminiscent of that of Sigourney's near the end ALIEN--with Kim
Flowers plump backside bulging out of a pair of g-string undies as Michael
Dudikoff massages her feet.  However, despite all of these appealing
familiarities,  it's ultimately the French element sprinkled in by Besson
that spoils the ingredient for this sequel for its American audience.  </P>
<P>Sigourney Weaver (most noted in GORILLA IN THE CLOUDS, THE ICE PIRATES)
once again returns to her role as Probation Officer Ellen Ripley, but this
time she's a whacked out, smartass cloned version of her former self who,
20 years previously, heroically leaped to her death in ALIEN 3.  Joining
her along for the adventure is humanitarian android named Call, played by
Winona Judd (BEETLEJUICE, HEATHERS).  Also, in minor supporting roles are
Ron Perlman as the big gorilla-type bully Johner, Dominic Pinon as the
horizontally challenged Vriess, Stephen Dorff as the mad geneticist Dr.
Guinan, Dan Hyhena as the goofball General Perez, J.E. Freeman as
untrustworthy Dr. Wren, Michael Dudikoff as toad-caught-in-this-throat
Elgyn, John Leguizamo as serious officer DiStephano, and Kim Flowers as the
"other" tough female ball buster Hillary.  This is pretty much the extent
with which the supporting characters are developed before becoming dinner
for the aliens.</P>
<P>As for the story, Ripley and Call soon find themselves along with rest of
the space pirates bunched up against a crowed of loose, DNA enhanced aliens
that wreck havoc onboard ship called the Algeria.  Because Ripley herself
is half-alien and missing a few human brain cells, the
pirates--particularly Call--are reluctant to form an alliance with this
alien ball buster.  Once they figure out that they have no chance to win
the "cat and mouse" game with the aliens, they all get behind Ripley as she
rips the shit out of the slimy acid beings and leads them back to their
ship that's docked inside the Algeria before they crash on Earth.</P>
<P>Although the concept may sound interesting, the story seems to get lost in
its confusion on exactly what type of film it's suppose to be.  Here comes
the problem of Besson who seems to want to try to impose his Frenchie artsy
style on his latest interpretation of the American series.  (Did we see
Cameron impose this Australian culture and values in the classic ALIENS?) 
Self-indulgent  Besson casts two of his stock French actors Ron Perlman and
Dominic Pinon from CHILDREN OF THE LOST CITY as two contrived weirdo
characters who are more fitting in some bizarre independent art film than a
sci-fi action flick.  Who wants to see some big asinine ogre and a crippled
midget with a speech impediment trying to resolve their sexual tensions
through petty bickering for the entire film? (And you thought the
heterosexual black gay guy was weird and annoying in THE FIFTH ELEMENT.) 
Besson figures that if he just makes his characters odd, it automatically
develops them.  With his attention focused on his odd French characters,
the director pretty much ignores the other supporting characters which end
up going to waste.  For example, with the comic ingenuity of John
Leguizamo, imagine how Besson could've made DiStephano more interesting and
funny.  But instead, we are forced to see Leguizamo suffer as he plays his
character straight... into boredom.</P>
<P>In addition, Besson has to incorporate his kinky French sensibility of sex
into the film.  Ripley, in one scene, is sucked into some gooey bio-matter
and does some soft porn antics with one of the aliens which the director
attempts to sexualize through fade ins and outs.  From what I can gather,
the aliens seem to prefer the traditional missionary position.  Hence, this
brings up the question: Is Ripley a Catholic?   The director never explores
this possibility and leaves yet another possible moment of character
development behind.  At this point, Besson rather subjects us with graphic
details of the alien queen giving birth to an albino mutant alien out of
her new human-like womb which is much more grotesque than those explicit
health videos that  you're forced to watch in the 10th grade.  And yes, it
does get worse when we see the new albino mutant progeny French-kiss Ripley
with its eight foot long tongue.  Did I forget to mention that these aliens
also ooze lots of bodily fluids out of their mouths onto the humans as
well?  YUCK!!!</P>
<P>Due to the director's incompetence, the story never grows beyond the gross
visual spectacles.  And the characters are more like mannequins, acting as
mere decorations to the film.  In particular, Call had some potential in
becoming interesting, but she ends up not doing much for the film except
looking good.  Winona Judd never seems to quite fit into the role and looks
out of place especially during the chaotic action sequences.   Her sister
Ashley Judd would've faired much better in the role, especially after
audiences got to see her as the "I'm no victim" kickboxer/doctor in last
fall's  KISS THE GIRLS with Morgan Freeman.  Maybe Winona should go back to
her former  singing career and leave the acting talents with her much
better-looking sister.</P>
<P>In all, ALIEN RESURRECTION gets lost is its artsy visual spectacle, leaving
us with a unexplored story with lots of unresolved holes and bodybags of
empty characters.  Hopefully by the time Alien 5 is made, the studio and
producers will understand that a good script, not an expensive budget, big
stars, and a foreign director with a keen eye, is the secret magic in
making a good sequel.</P>
