<P>There are three opening moves to this movie. The comic-book design of the
opening credits; in her palatial penthouse, Cynthia who jumps to her death
from the balcony; a flashback to four young women, close friends who are
happily graduating from Middlebury College in 1969.</P>
<P>Cynthia's tiny sequence is the only serious one and arguably the best in a
movie botched by its comic-book treatment of a major subject.</P>
<P>In the first of a string of improbabilities, the Middlebury graduates,
while  so close to each other, have not met in ages, even though they all
lived in New York City.  It takes Cynthia's funeral services to reunite the
surviving three , Keaton, Midler and Hawn. They are now 45 or 46. If  you
believe their official birthdates, the three actresses are nearing 51.</P>
<P>In another forced ploy (it's in the book) all of them were abandoned by
their husbands for younger chicks. This is what had happened to Cynthia
too. In additional inventions, all three women had helped their husbands
attain wealth and status;  all three men are creeps; all their new
patooties are flawed. Sarah Jessica Parker is a dumb ,vulgar, uncultured
bimbo ; Elizabeth Berkley ("Showgirls") is a naive aspiring actress, who
much later turns out to be only 16 ; Marcia Gay Harden, is a shrink who
breaks ethics monstrously as, in another outlandish arrangement, she is
both Keaton's therapist and the lover of  Keaton's husband.</P>
<P>Keaton is in a trial separation. She hopes matters will improve after her
husband has unexpected sex with her ... and then announces that he wants a
divorce. Hawn's ex has the cheek to ask her for alimony.</P>
<P>To this coarse, too-much-is-too-much mess are added, for no really valid
reason, Midler's son and his Bar Mitzvah, and Keaton's daughter who
proudly announces that she is lesbian. Neither embellishment helps the
Jewish or the gay causes.</P>
<P>The ladies are seething. When each receives a letter from the grave
(Cynthia's),the trio decide to exact revenge. In ways too unlikely to
analyze, they succeed.</P>
<P>The actresses do what they can with their parts, but none of them is
likable in a movie where nobody is. With the minor exceptions of  friends
recruited to help the wives: Maggie Smith as a sly "grande dame" and
Bronson Pinchot, "one of the nine worst decorators in Manhattan" who also
lends a hand. With the exception of tongue-in-cheek Smith, the  acting
ranges from broad to very broad, the latter fitting best Pinchot and Sarah
Jessica Parker. There is not even token dimensionality to the three
husbands, with Victor Garber (as Hawn's ex) being icomprehensively passive.</P>
<P>The film's subject is no joke but is treated as such yet there are few
successful one-liners or gags --save for a funny scam sequence at
Christie's auction house.  While conceived as a farce, the film is not
handled as a farce. Sluggish, dull, doing nothing for feminism, it limits
it would-be message by limiting its arena to a moneyed milieu. In the
wrap-up the ladies use their new wealth to open (in an artificial attempt
to flatter female audiences) a women's crisis center. They throw a high
society party which is like the opening of a ritzy restaurant or a fashion
show. There's a dumb, cop-out reconciliation of one couple. The last scene
has the three women doing an embarrassingly silly musical comedy song and
dance number.</P>
<P>Director Hugh Wilson has made "Police Academy," (hmm), "Rustler's Rhapsody"
(ugh), "Burglar" (ugh), "Guarding Tess" (good). Scripter Robert Harling
wrote "Steel Magnolias" from his play, co-wrote the funny "Soapdish" and
was one 7 writers on "Sister Act."</P>
<P>If you want to see a delightful film about three women who revolt against
male oppression, try the 1980 "9 to 5."</P>
