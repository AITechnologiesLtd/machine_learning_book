                       A film review by James Berardinelli
                        Copyright 1993 James Berardinelli</PRE>

<P>     In 1972, a chartered plane carrying 37 people--friends, family,
and members of a Uruguayan rugby team--crash-landed in the Andes en 
route to Chile.  For 72 days, the survivors struggled to prolong their 
existence, resorting to cannibalism to stay alive.  ALIVE, based on
Piers Paul Read's bestseller, is their story.  </P>
<P>     The film begins and ends with a close-up of an uncredited John 
Malkovich, who, playing one of the survivors, reflects back on the
ordeal and how it has affected his life since then.  Malkovich,
although only on-screen briefly, effectively sets the stage for what is
to come.</P>
<P>     ALIVE will not be shown on any airplanes.  The plane crash
sequence, perfectly led up to and executed, is hair-raising, perhaps
the most terrifying crash ever shown in a movie (including those in the
AIRPLANE films and DIE HARD 2).  The tension of the moment is
heightened, rather than diminished, by the knowledge of what is to
come.  As the plane begins to rise and drop through air pockets, we're
put on the edge of our seats, dreading the inevitable.  ILM,
responsible for making the crash real, has created a memorable
spectacle.  The sight of seats, with people still in them, tumbling
through a gaping hole in the back of the cabin is unforgettable.  </P>
<P>     The unpleasant subject of cannibalism is dealt with in ALIVE.
Because it was such an important factor to the survival of the sixteen,
it could not be glossed over.  The film confronts the issue head-on,
but deals with it sensitively rather than sensationalistically.  There
are no gruesome close-ups of half-eaten bodies.  The characters react
with genuine horror at what they have to do.  The most graphic scene
occurs past the mid-point of the film, in a wide shot of the crash/camp
site, where several stripped skeletons can be seen half-covered by
snow.</P>
<P>     ALIVE is an adventure story that grapples with themes more profound
than most movies of the genre.  The moral implications of eating the
body of a dead friend or relative are not overlooked, nor is the
spiritual cost of such a decision.  The will to live demands
sacrifices, none of which come cheaply.  Religion and the existence of
God are themes that Alive constantly returns to.</P>
<P>     One of the disadvantages of having so many characters is that few
of them attain independence from the mass as far as the audience is 
concerned.  As a result, most of the deaths are meaningless.  There are
only three characters who have enough screen time, dialogue, and
interaction to achieve depth:  Nando Parrado (Ethan Hawke),  Antonio
Balbi (Vincent Spano), and Roberto Cannessa (Josh Hamilton).  It is
primarily around these three that the story centers.</P>
<P>     The cinematography by Peter James is impressive, effectively
capturing the awe-inspiring feel of the Andes--vastness, majesty, and
danger.  The camerawork that sets up the plane crash at the beginning
is of equal importance in detailing an avalanche and showing the
difficulty of a long trek across the snow-covered, precipitous slopes.
A less inspired effort would have resulted in a film with reduced
impact.</P>
<P>     ALIVE is far different from any recent motion picture.  It is an
adventure tale with depth and breadth that would put many dramas to
shame.  Well-produced, acted, and scripted, this is a film that has to
be seen to be experienced, even by those who know the entire story.  </P>
<PRE>                      Rating:  8.5 (A-, ***)</PRE>
