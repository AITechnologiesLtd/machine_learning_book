<P>Am I the only one who's had it up to here (that's right...here!) with films
that start by either thirteen or six? Let's look at the past few years.
There was THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR, THE THIRTEENTH WARRIOR and now, THIRTEEN
DAYS. There's also been THE SIXTH DAY, THE SIXTH SENSE and SIX DAYS, SEVEN
NIGHTS. C'mon Hollywood...get original, dude! How about tossing some new
numbers in there? The SECOND DAY might've been just as good/bad, or what
about the EIGHTEENTH WARRIOR? I don't know, maybe I'm just a little cranky
cause it's that time of the month again and my memory sucks, but let's see
what Kevin Costner has to say about all this...</P>
<P>PLOT:
Based on a real life event. The Soviet Union is stockpiling nuclear missiles
in Cuba. The United States spots the warheads and considers them to be a
little too close for comfort. The President and the rest of the big wigs in
the government spend the next thirteen days grazing the possibility of an
all-out war breaking out against the USSR. Who's gonna blink first? Are the
Soviets bluffing? Will Marilyn Monroe save the day?</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Historians, patient moviegoers and those fascinated with the
behind-the-scenes goings-on of all things political are likely to embrace
this movie. I dug it myself. Certain elements from it reminded me a lot of
two other great films, namely NO WAY OUT and CRIMSON TIDE, although this
film focused more on the talkie-talkie stuff, rather than any action,
romance or humor. Of course, this film isn't about that anyway. It's about
tense moments, tit-for-tat strategy sessions and basically, one of the
greatest political chess games of all time. I thoroughly enjoyed this film,
never once felt bored during its two and a half hour runtime and was gripped
by its many strong performances. Ironically, the first utterance of Kevin
Costner's thick, thick Boston accent had me wondering if I had walked into a
comedy or what, but it only took five minutes for me to believe both him,
his accent and pretty much everything else that occurred in this movie from
there on out.</P>
<P>You see, the Cuban Missile Crisis took place long before my time and I
honestly didn't know all that much about it before seeing this movie (me no
Americanos), so every second on the clock was a captivating one for me. The
jargon wasn't too hard to follow, especially with the Kennedy brothers
sharply tag-teaming their way through most of the hard-liners, and all of
the main characters, very well drawn out. And what about those awesome suits
that the brothers and Costner were wearing? Very cool! All in all, this
movie is structured a lot like a play. Plenty of dialogue, lots of
characters interacting amongst one another and very few distinct locations.
One thing I didn't "get" or like about this film, was the director's
seemingly arbitrary use of black and white vs color scenes. He pulled a
couple of these babies early on and then stopped. Not exactly sure why. It
was just distracting. But on the whole, the movie grabbed by the cojones and
let me fly up on the wall during a pretty funky time of our history.
Granted, it didn't have me chomping fingernails the whole way through, but
the tension was present throughout, the dead-on performances by Bruce
Greenwood and Steven Culp infectious to behold, and ultimately, the movie
helped me achieve a greater understanding of the entire event as it took
place, and allowed me to put my little miscommunication issues with the
Missus in perspective.</P>
<P>You see, when the Mrs. and I miscommunicate, I don't get any nookie for the
night. But when JFK and Kruschev miscommunicate in this movie (couldn't
these guys just call each other direct?), the result could likely have
turned into World War 3. Makes the whole toilet seat up-or-down debate seem
pretty insignificant, eh?</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Note about this film (from the press kit): While this picture is based upon
a true story, some characters have been composited or invented, and dialogue
and a number of incidents contained in this film were fictionalized for the
purpose of dramatization.
PackBacker, this one's for you! This is screenwriter David Self's second
produced screenplay. His first was for 1999's THE HAUNTING. Yikes!
Director Roger Donaldson previously worked with Kevin Costner in the 1987
thriller NO WAY OUT.</P>
