<P>        Fate has two aspects in YELLOW EARTH, and both are pitiless.  There 
is the fate decreed by nature, and there is the fate decreed by 
society.  Young Cuiqiao (Xue Bai), a teenage girl in the rural Chinese 
region of Shaanxi, struggles against both these forces.  She does not 
desire the marriage that has been arranged for her by her father.  She 
would leave if she could, but it's 200 miles to Yenan, where she might 
join the Communist Army and escape the role her father has assigned 
her.</P>
<P>        Society and the natural world conspire against her, but she is not 
even aware that other options exist until Gu (Wang Xueyin), a 
Communist, comes to stay in her farming community.  He has come to 
gather folk songs, to bring back as inspiration for the army.  He 
tells Cuiqiao about female comrades who crop their hair, who can fight 
the Japanese, who can read and write.  "They have great spirit!" he 
says.  "Oh," she replies, and she begins to consider the 
possibilities.</P>
<P>        Meanwhile, she and her father (Tan Tuo) and her brother (Liu Quiang) 
go about their lives, while Gu studies them, asks questions, watches 
them live off the land.  The land is an awesome presence in YELLOW 
EARTH, magnificent and imposing.  In the flow of the river, the 
expanse of the sky, the sweep of the mountainside, there is a sense of 
space and freedom; at the same time, these landscapes overwhelm the 
people, and there is a sense of entrapment.  They land provides for 
them, but they are also at its mercy.  </P>
<P>        We see water being gathered in buckets from the river, plough-blades 
turning up the earth: in these pastoral moments, the film surrenders 
to the rhythms of the natural world.  There is a bond with the earth, 
an intimacy.  It's not surprising that cinematographer Zhang Yimou 
grew up in this area: he sees it so vividly.  But nature can be harsh.  
There is a drought; the earth becomes dry and dusty; food becomes 
scarce.  The farmers pray for rain, and nature is oblivious.  
Meanwhile, Cuiqiao, trapped by the vast, indomitable landscape and the 
stifling social codes of her people, continues to weigh her options.  
Which fate is better?</P>
<P>        Cuiqiao's sister is married to a man who beats her.  Gu asks her 
father why she must live such a hard life.  "Fate," he replies, as if 
that explained everything.  In his mind, it does.  But this so-called 
"fate" is simply the refusal to allow for other possibilities; as 
such, it is merely another name for oppression.  Gu--who the film 
treats quite sympathetically--does not approve of the father's 
fatalism, but he too will fail Cuiqiao, and his failure is the failure 
of Communism.  The movie ends with a stirring Maoist song--"The 
Communist Party will save us all!"--played over an image that makes 
the words savagely ironic.  You need to see the movie to appreciate 
its full impact, but the censors who subjected the film to their 
humourless appraisal must have been immune to irony.  Gu and the 
father are both guilty of the same sin: they can change Cuiqiao's 
"fate," but they don't, because it is easier not to.  Nature may be 
harsh, but at least she plays fair.</P>
<P>        YELLOW EARTH is a landmark film.  With Zhang Junzhao's ONE AND EIGHT 
(1984), it launched the Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers.  Zhang 
Yimou was the cinematographer on both films, and has since become the 
best-known director of the group, who are probably the most exciting 
filmmakers currently at work.  On an artistic level, they're exciting 
because they make great movies, plain and simple.  On a political 
level, they're exciting because they manage to make bold, subversive 
statements despite their government's best efforts to prevent them.  
YELLOW EARTH is a wonderful work of art, but it's also a fascinating 
study in the ways political artists can express themselves, even when 
limited by rigid restrictions.</P>
<P>        Chen's later movies FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE and TEMPTRESS MOON were 
both banned in China, yet YELLOW EARTH escaped that fate, even though 
it manifests a profound disillusionment with Communism.  You can't do 
anything about a drought, but you can give the people of your 
country--or your daughter--a better life, if you choose to do so.  But 
the men in this movie are incapable of such a choice.  You'd have 
better luck praying to the gods for rain. </P>
