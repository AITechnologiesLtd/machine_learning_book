<P>     When Greenaway came to introduce the film at the 1993 Cambridge
Film Festival, he explained that he was no longer interested in making
films in a naturalistic style, or in ideas such as "character" and
"plot."  As far as he is concerned, there are plenty of other
film-makers making films in these ways, and he wanted to set out to
make films that are different, that he would want to watch, films that
do for naturalism in cinema what the abstract movement did for
naturalism in art.</P>
<P>     The result is something that is difficult to identify with because
the characters are flat and the dialogue is completely unconvincing (in
much the way that the dialogue of a verse drama is unconvincing).  I
found the result utterly compelling, but very distasteful.</P>
<P>     The business of the film is a play called "The Baby of Macon,"
that is being presented to a group of Renaissance nobles in the
Cathedral at Macon in France.  The play is introduced by the figure of
Famine sitting on a swing describing how the land around Macon has been
beset by famine and pestilence; crops will not grow, everything decays,
when women give birth at all they give birth to monsters.  One
particularly ugly woman, horrendously distended, is about to give
birth.  We see one of the actors running up with a doll to represent
the baby, but before he can supply it to the midwives, a real baby is
born.  It seems that on this evening the play is to happen for real.
The miraculous baby becomes a source of contention between the Church,
represented by the bishop's son (Ralph Fiennes) and the baby's sister
(Julian Ormond), who later pretends that she is its mother.  Both sides
exploit the baby for their own ends, their own riches, and their own
power.  The play ends in tragedy and bloodbath.</P>
<P>     One of Greenaway's aims in THE BABY OF MACON is to say something
about the relationship between a film and its audience.  He said that
one of the sources of inspiration for the films was the banning of the
Benetton advertising poster campaign in the UK that featured pictures
of a newborn baby, covered in blood and still attached to its umbilical
cord.  An outcry caused the posters to be removed.  What is so horrible
about a newborn baby, Greenaway wanted to know.  Why is that image (one
that is seen many times a day in hospitals all over the country) so
unacceptable, when much more horrific images are presented on
television and the cinema, featuring murder and rape, but glamourised
and made safe.  Greenaway set out to make a film featuring murder and
rape in which nothing was glamourised and nothing was safe.</P>
<P>     The centerpiece of the film (I am not spoiling very much here; one
of the characters in the film explains beforehand what the scene is
going to involve and how long it will last) is a ten-minute long rape
scene, filmed in a single virtuoso take.  There's no edit to make it
safe for us, no looking away; we can't say so easily and so quickly "it
was all illusion" (although of course it is).  The play-within-a-film
construction of THE BABY OF MACON allows this scene to become a
representation of a snuff film: the actress "steps out of character" to
express relief that it's only a play, only to discover that this night
it is "for real."  This step out of the fiction is disconcerting and
horrifying; a number of people walked out of the cinema at this point
on both the occasions that I've watched the film (though not as many as
walked out of THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER - perhaps
cinema-goers had received more warning of the kind of images they were
likely to be confronted with in this case).</P>
<P>     At the end of the film, the camera pulls back through the theatre
(actually the cathedral at Macon) and the cast bow toward the camera to
the sound of rapturous applause.  Clearly it is the audience in the
cinema to whom the applause is attributed, and the effect is to make
the audience feel that it is complicit in its approval of what it has
seen on the screen.  I felt that however much I admired Greenaway's
film-making skill, I did not want to applaud the action, and yet the
framing of the end of the film made me complicit in the action,
implying that because I had chosen to attend the film, I had some part
in causing it to be made.  The feeling was uncomfortable and
thought-provoking.</P>
<P>     Other ideas in THE BABY OF MACON are treated in less detail: the
exploitation of children; the oppression of women by the medieval
Church; the relationship between science and superstition during the
Renaissance; the Catholic fascination with the Madonna and Child.</P>
<P>     If you expect a conventional film in which you can identify with
one or more of the leading characters and enjoy and entertaining plot,
then you are sure to be annoyed and disappointed.  If you're prepared
for a film that's quite different from Greenaway's previous feature
films (though anticipated by the "TV Dante" and "M is for Man, Music
and Mozart") then you might be impressed.</P>
