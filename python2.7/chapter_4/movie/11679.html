<P>     Walt Disney spent over thirty years turning the Disney name into the
gold standard for charming family entertainment.  In only a handful of
months, the clown princes currently ruling the Magic Kingdom appear to
have made it their mission to make the name an indicator of pure garbage.
The annual animated feature aside, Uncle Walt's factory has taken to
churning out insulting, embarrassing live-action features which stink like
the flatulence they so often feature:  101 DALMATIANS, THAT DARN CAT,
ROCKET MAN, MR. MAGOO, KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBE and now MEET THE DEEDLES.</P>
<P>     The story this time revolves around a pair of ne'er-do-well teenage
brothers, Phil (Paul Walker) and Stew Deedle (Steve Van Wormer), who spend
all their time surfing and slacking in Hawaii because their Dad is filthy
rich.  When Pa Deedle (Eric Braeden) finally grows tired of his layabout
sons, he sends them off to Wyoming for a character-building camp
experience.  A few misadventures and cases of mistaken identity later, the
young Deedles are rangers-in-training at Yellowstone National Park,
charged with ridding the park of a prairie dog infestation threatening to
undermine -- literally -- the Billionth Birthday Celebration for Old
Faithful.</P>
<P>     Predictably, a bunch of tenuously connected action-slapstick
sequences ensue.  Even more predictably, those action-slapstick sequences
include a dose of content entirely inappropriate for the target audience.
At best, we're talking about taking the toilet humor in the creative
direction of incontinent pigeons bombarding the Deedles'
stuffy-but-ultimately-sympathetic antagonist Chief Ranger Pine (played by
career stuffy-but-ultimately-sympathetic antagonist John Ashton).  At
worst, we're talking about the omnipresent smack-in-the-groin shot.  I'm
sure MEET THE DEEDLES is going to have plenty of pre-teenagers in
hysterics.  It's just depressing to watch the same Disney which used to
bring kids goofy, harmless fare like THE LOVE BUG and THE MILLION DOLLAR
DUCK resorting to such blantant pandering.</P>
<P>     An important programming note at this point:  in no way do I consider
myself "above" low humor.  In Mel Brooks' HIGH ANXIETY, a similar barrage
of pigeon excrement during his parody of THE BIRDS still makes me guffaw.
The problem with films like MEET THE DEEDLES is that they trot out
scatological gags with a weary inevitability, as though it wouldn't really
be a kids' film unless someone let one rip.  All of which makes it even
more puzzling when scripter Jim Herzfeld tosses in a reference to "suicide
doctor" Jack Kervorkian, which of course would be familiar to every
headline-hungry middle-schooler.  If that's Herzfeld's idea of throwing a
bone to the parents forced to squirm through this mess with their kids,
perhaps a better one might have been making the slang-spewing Deedles a
bit more than one-joke copies of Bill and Ted.  Or giving Dennis Hopper
(as the vengeance-seeking former ranger running the prairie dog scheme) a
sense of irony about his own performance.  Or providing a way to explain
to young girls why a competent female ranger (A.J. Langer) turns to mush
when an 18-year-old moron woos her with sweet nothings about how he
"totally craves (her) wave."</P>
<P>     MEET THE DEEDLES didn't have to be smart.  There's a place in our
multiplexes for dopey-but-innocuous family fare.  The key word there would
be "innocuous."  If Disney execs are interested in salvaging what remains
of the studio's reputation -- and its dignity -- they might stop for just
one moment to think about what Uncle Walt might say.  That is, what he
might say after he picked his jaw up off the floor and stopped slapping
the responsible parties insensible.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Deedles on empty:  1.</PRE>
