                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     PATHER PANCHALI (1955), also known as SONG OF THE LITTLE ROAD, is
an Indian film that is showing now at some of the cinematic art houses.
It is considered by many to be a classic movie and is the first part of
director Satyajit Ray's "Apu Trilogy."  The movie has a lot going for
it, not the least of which is extremely earnest and heartfelt
performances by all of the cast.  In its depiction of abject poverty it
reminded me somewhat of King Vidor's OUR DAILY BREAD (1934) and John
Ford's THE GRAPES OF WRATH (1940).  I am sorry to report that, being
one of the slowest films I have ever seen, I did not like PATHER
PANCHALI.  Sincerity is not enough for me; I like a movie where
something happens.</P>
<P>     At first I had trouble figuring out what was going on since not
much of anything was happening so I figured I was missing something.
After a while it dawned on me that PATHER PANCHALI is a slice of life
movie, but one at a glacial pace.  The director gets lots of long
sequences of people looking pensively.</P>
<P>     The story is a tale of a long suffering wife, Sarbojaya Ray
(Karuna Bannerjee), a financially irresponsible father, Harihar Ray
(Kanu Bannerjee), a daughter, Durga (Uma Das Gupta), a son, Apu (Subir
Bannerjee), and a very old and invalid Aunt, Indir Thakrun (Chunibala
Devi), whom the mother views as a lot of trouble.  The father is proud
to be the descendant of a long line of artists and scholars.  He wants
to be a playwright and poet, but has trouble making any money in the
meantime.  He works as an accountant, but does not want to complain to
his employer that he is not being paid lest he be fired.</P>
<P>     The movie works best in the scenes of everyday life.  My favorites
are the candy man who walks through the jungle ringing his bells like
an ice cream truck in this country, the six week old kittens
frolicking, and the great cinematography (Subrata Mitra) of water bugs
dancing on a pond.</P>
<P>     Most of the movie consists of incidents like Durga stealing fruit
from the old family orchard that used to belong to them.  She eats the
fruit herself as well as gives it to her Aunt and to Apu.  She
continues to get caught and get in trouble for it.  There is a constant
tension about whether the father will ever make any money to feed his
family.  The father has a simple philosophy of "Whatever God does is
for the best," which is a pleasant enough aphorism, but leaves his kids
close to starvation.</P>
<P>     PATHER PANCHALI may be an acquired taste.  Certainly the acting is
straight forward and earnest, but not much actually happens in the film
and what does happen happens so slowly.  I think tighter editing (Dulal
Dutta) and a more energetic script (Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay and
Satyajit Ray) would have kept my attention better.  Finally, for me the
best part of the picture is the music by Ravi Shankar who was then an
unknown musician.  It is sublime.</P>
<P>     PATHER PANCHALI runs 1:55, but I think it would have been much
more effective at about 1:25.  The picture is filmed in black and white
and the print I saw was in acceptable shape, but showed its age.  The
film is in Bengali with English subtitles.  It is not rated, but would
certainly be rated G.  There is exactly one mildly harsh word in it,
and there is no sex, nudity, or violence.  The movie would be fine for
children of any age, but the slowness would lose most of the young
ones.  I admire the sincerity of the film, but I can not recommend it
no matter how much of a classic it is.  It is unmercifully slow.  For
its sweetness I give **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
