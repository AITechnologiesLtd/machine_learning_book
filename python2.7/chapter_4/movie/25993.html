<PRE>An Archive Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Stephen King said The Evil Dead was, "The most ferociously original horror 
movie I have ever seen." The author supported this film, and helped it to 
become the cult classic it is now. Two sequels, Evil Dead II and Army of 
Darkness followed in later years. So what does the original have going for 
it, besides a rave from a horror novelist? It has nothing, nothing at all. 
It's just a by-the-numbers horror picture. The type a Scream movie destroys 
with delicious malice.</P>
<P>A group of teens head out to a remote cabin in the mountains. Their plans for 
endless midnight orgies and marijuana highs get put on hold by their 
lodging's creepy aura. After some investigation, they find the cottage used 
to be a lab for a scary professor. He discovered the Book of the Dead, a 
publication that puts a curse on whoever reads it. The only way to break the 
hex is by dismembering the victim. Our hero, Ash (Bruce Campbell), reads the 
book, unaware of its power. Soon his friends are turning into zombies and 
chasing him through the house. It seems doubtful Ash has what it takes to 
stay alive, and cut up his former pals.</P>
<P>This is a movie that puts recent supposedly violent flicks like The Cell to 
shame. If you cannot handle a large, continuous amount of gore, this is not 
for you. The blood is extremely frequent and bursts out often. Prepare to see 
pencils, knives, clocks, chainsaws, trees, and more all used as weapons of 
destruction. Just because the carnage is excessive doesn't mean it's 
realistic. From first to last frame this is obviously a student film. The 
blood often looks like badly colored water. Clay gets employed near the end 
for beheadings, flesh explosions, and other bodily mishaps. Prepare not to 
eat oatmeal for a long time. Prepare to never look at trees the same way 
again. Despite the bloodshed, there is some nice composition in the first 
half an hour or so. After which the cinematography tries to follow two simple 
questions. Can the camera get closer? and Can we make it seem bloodier? </P>
<P>Head out into the woods with some of the worst actors and least intelligent 
human beings ever. Overused, supposedly ominous music is your guide through 
the forest of an '80s Blair Witch. This overly gross gorefest is slightly 
scary about once, somewhere between zombie one's face being blown off and 
zombie two's foot being severed. It is occasionally good for a laugh, but 
director Sam Raimi tries too hard. </P>
<P>The sequels fared much better than this movie, which many consider inferior. 
Yet I really had to ask myself whether I would survive two more Evil Dead 
movies. My unsettled stomach screams no.</P>
