<P>    In 1995, Brian Singer and Christopher McQuarrie dreamed up a simple
concept: the audience isn't stupid.  From that, they went on and created the
most plot-driven, intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years.  The
result: the Usual Suspects, one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot
twist.
    The story is convoluted, and is really confusing to read, although easy
to follow on screen.  Special investigator Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) grills
"Verbal" Kint (Kevin Spacey), a crippled con-man who is the lone survivor of
an LA boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims. Kujan wants to
confirm that his nemesis, the rogue cop Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), is actually
dead. Kint relates the majority of the film in flashback, beginning with the
fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a police-station lineup in New
York City. Along with dour Keaton, Kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic
McManus (Stephen Baldwin), mordantly sarcastic Hockney (Kevin Pollak), and
Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), whose speech is virtually incomprehensible.
Together they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from "New York's Finest
Taxi Service"--crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug
kingpins. What follows is a shell-game of violence and betrayal, all hinging
on the identity of a mysterious villain called Keyser Soze.
    The film is brilliantly compact: its the shortest 90 minutes you'll ever
spend in a movie theater.  The cast is exceptional.  Palminteri shines, he
is brutally honest, a true cop, one who is going after the whole story
because its there.  Byrne is terrific, his brooding character, his
seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of Benicio Del Toro, who is
a riot as Fenster.  Del Toro is brilliant, his lines are a jumbled mess, you
can't understand a word the man says, but it sure is damn funny.  Baldwin is
also very good, he is careful, methodical, and cold, a chilling character
with a nasty streak of hot-blooded sarcasm.  Pollak is also terrific as
usual, a very good character actor.
    However, this will be forever known as the film that launched Kevin
Spacey.  Spacey is simply breathtaking, he is a force on screen, giving a
magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze.
Spacey's performance will be remembered for years, for it is the best of his
career, it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last 50
years.  Verbal Kint is a clever storyteller, weak, oppressed, and gleefully
evil to the bone, yet pitiful, one who draws sympathy.  The film is a good
one, a decent film until the last 10 minutes.  What this film boils down to
is the greatest ending in cinematic history, for me at least.  The
revelation of Keyser Soze, the closing gunfights, it is something wondrous.
You have to see this movie about 10 times to believe what they do.
    Kudos to McQuarrie and Singer for giving the audience a delightful,
fast-paced, furiously plot-driven movie with quirky characters, phenomenal
acting, and some hilarious moments stuck in the middle.  McQuarrie refuses
to believe the audience is dumb.  Without furnishing too many details, he
concocts his story and lets it run, hoping the audience gets it at the end.
We do.  This might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created.  Kudos
also to Singer and John Ottman, who created the score.  They both create
what is a true film-noir setting, carefully setting up this intricate puzzle
until the final, jarring ending.  There are flaws: more questions raised
than answers, lack of character development, and no strong female characters
(save one).  However, the plot, and that stunning ending, make up for all
the flaws and more.
    If you haven't seen the movie, rent it.  Watch it.  Then rewind the
tape, and watch it again.  Trust me, you'll be amazed.</P>
