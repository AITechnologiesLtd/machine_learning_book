<P>     Good noir-ish thrillers are so few and far between that it almost
breaks my heart when one with so much going for it stumbles so badly down
the stretch. That's the situation with CROUPIER, a slick tale set in the
world of a London casino. Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is an aspiring
novelist having trouble making ends meet while he tries to get something
published. Fortunately, he has a back-up skill: Having been raised around
casinos by his compulsive gambler father (Nicholas Ball) and having worked
in one in South Africa, Jack is an adept black jack dealer and roulette
wheel operator. His talent lands him a job in a casino where the money is
great, the rules of conduct strict and the hours challenging to his
relationship with his girlfriend Marion (Gina McKee). It also introduces
him to some potentially dangerous characters, like a patron named Jani
("E.R.'s" Alex Kingston) who wants Jack to help her with a little insider
job.</P>
<P>     From the outset, CROUPIER looks like it has all the classic film noir
elements. The protagonist narrates the story in a hard-boiled voice-over,
using a third-person description of events as Jack forms his experiences
into something he can write. Owen's laconic performance as Jack is
perfectly pitched; he's got that Campbell Scott deadpan thing going, which
is particularly appropriate since he's a dead ringer for Scott. There's a
promising femme fatale in Kingston's Jani, who slowly insinuates herself
into Jack's life before dropping the hammer. And Paul Mayersberg's script
offers a potent combination of sly dialogue, effective characterizations
and intriguing introduction to the world of the croupier. As the world of
the casino becomes ever more attractive to Jack, CROUPIER builds momentum
towards a resolution that seems certain to have a tremendous kick.</P>
<P>     Only it doesn't. It's hard to imagine a more anti-climactic climax to
a thriller than the one offered up by CROUPIER. The heist into which Jack
is recruited takes some unexpected turns, but for once that's far from a
compliment. It suddenly becomes evident that Mayersberg is going to wrap
things up far too quickly to make the film's conclusion satisfying. A dead
body turns up, but it never really matters in the long run. A manipulative
plot is exposed, but Jack doesn't seem particularly concerned by it. A
character appears to confess a secret love that makes you wonder what film
you just wandered into. A film like CROUPIER absolutely demands a big
payoff -- either realization that the protagonist has been suckered into
being the victim, or a big smile as he ends up the victor. CROUPIER can't
manage to provide either one. It's almost as though Mayersberg got stuck
on the film he was writing and pasted on the end of another film entirely.</P>
<P>     It's a testimony to how well CROUPIER works for 90% of its running
time that the train wreck of a conclusion can't derail the whole
film. Director Mike Hodges (probably best-known stateside for the garish
1980 FLASH GORDON) stylishly captures the dim casino milieu and the
choreographed moves of the croupiers, while Owen keeps us involved in what
will happen to Jack. There are some memorable scenes -- Jack's expert
manipulation of a poker game, for instance -- and some provocatively
enigmatic holes in Jack's back-story. There are also so many missed
opportunities that you just want to shake Mayersberg for his sloppiness. 
Right up to the moment of the planned casino heist, CROUPIER is well worth
recommending. I'd also recommend leaving the theater at that point. Any
ending you can come up with in your head is better than the one that ended
up on the screen.</P>
<PRE>      On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 casino-no's:  6.</PRE>
