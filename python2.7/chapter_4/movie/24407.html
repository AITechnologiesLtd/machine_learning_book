<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Brain Dead is adapted from an intelligent story by Charles Beaumont, a
former writer for the "Twilight Zone" series, who died in 1967. This
chilling tale left a lot to be desired and despite having an
intelligence and originality to it, it degenerated into a jejune work,
more of a display of style over substance. I felt cheated by its
wearisome ploy of not decifering what was a dream and what was reality,
feeling more like I was being manipulated than I was at being treated to
something special.</P>
<P>In a positive vein, this low-budget film kept moving at a swift pace and
the story was conceivable to a point. The film managed to  hold my
interest until about the halfway point, when too much of the same
interplay between dreams and reality was never made clear, so much so
that I stopped suspending disbelief, which is tantamount to pulling the
life support on one of these flicks and rendering it brain dead.</P>
<P>The story opens with a brain research scientist (he is also a brain
surgeon), Dr. Rex Martin (Pullman) and his assistant Berkovitch,
experimenting in their science lab on dead brains, where they keep jars
of them stored in shelves along the wall. Pullman's old friend and
college competitor, a slippery marketer for a large corporation called
Eunice, Jim Reston (Paxton), visits his office and presents him with an
opportunity to make a name for himself in science and become rich. He is
aware that Martin  developed a technology to alter personalities and to
re-sculpture memory, by fiddling with one's reality. Reston's idea is
that they can sell this to the public as a product and open up clinical
salons, with people able to change their personalities to the one's they
want. The slogan for the product would be: The new you from Eunice.</P>
<P>Reston also tells him he has a fresh brain available for him to use his
ideas on, to see if they actually work. The person he is talking about,
is a one-time genius mathematician who worked for the Eunice corporation
(or he could be an accountant in Conklin's mattress firm), Dr. Halsey
(Cort). He is a paranoid psychopath, who killed his wife and two
children and three lab assistants, for apparently no reason, and pleaded
insanity. He's now in a private mental institution, Lakeside, where he
denies everything. But, he holds some invaluable numbers that he was
working on for Eunice, that Reston says is classified information. It is
further explained to Martin, that these are numbers we do not want to
get into anyone else's hands. The proposition is, that we get you a
meeting with him and you get to do brain surgery on him, and if you can
manipulate his thought process so we get the three numbers we need,
fine. But if he should go brain dead, that's fine too. Eunice's
corporate head (Kennedy) agrees to this plan. As loopy as the story is
from here, it is the most sense it will make, because everything gets
more confusing from here on, after Martin visits the harmless but
paranoic Halsey in Lakeside.</P>
<P>When Martin leaves the sanitarium, he is walking in the street with a
jar that has a brain in it and a homeless man attacks him, claiming
that's his brain. In the course of the struggle for the brain, a car
runs over Martin. He falls into a world of nightmares, madness, and
paranoia, where rationality is lost sight of. It plays like an episode
derived from the "Twilight Zone," as Dr. Martin's technology is now
being experimented on him.</P>
<P>Martin's dreams include: seeing Jim making love to his lovely wife
(Charbonneau ) in the nude; that he is really Halsey; that the doctor
who is treating him is from Lakeside, Dr. Ramsen (Pryor), who gives him
shock treatments and applies to him the same surgery procedure he used
on Halsey; and, that his life is completely disorientated, at one moment
he is Martin, at another he is Halsey, and the nightmare keeps changing
every ten minutes or so, so that the viewer is totally confused. There
are also dreams within the dreams, adding more confusion, until the film
ends on a dull conventional note, after all the expections of something
radical being promised.</P>
<P>The film didn't do much for me, as it was not worth putting in all the
effort to watch it, as the payoff seemed too little. But the dream
sequences were scary and the film had an intelligent approach to its
horror rather than the usual exploitive one...if only it made more
sense! Pullman seemed believable as someone losing sense of reality,
while Paxton was robotic in his role, playing it without feeling. All
the other performances were as forgettable as the film.</P>
