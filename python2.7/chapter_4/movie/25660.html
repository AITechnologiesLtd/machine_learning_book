<PRE>Shanghai Noon </PRE>
<P>It's a western, an action movie and a comedy all rolled up into one. But it's 
also a Jackie Chan movie so that
automatically makes it a lot more likable to begin with. </P>
<P>The story is simple, Chan stars as a Chinese imperial guard who must travel 
to Carson City, Nevada in the
late 1800s to rescue a princess who thought she was going there to start a 
new life but actually walked right
into a kidnapper's trap. </P>
<P>Owen Wilson costars as Roy O'Bannon, a train robber who I think is Han Solo 
in a former life. When the
two find themselves as a team a lot of hilarity and action ensues. Wilson is 
really charming as the supposed
bad boy and so is Chan as the ignorant immigrant. </P>
<P>The story is really all over the map but it's forgivable because the two men 
are so fun to watch and the
action sequences are so exciting. This is how action movies are supposed to 
work. </P>
