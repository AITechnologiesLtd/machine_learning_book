<PRE>                                 FLATLINERS
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1990) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        In medical slang, a "flatline" is when a person suffers 
clinical and mental death. Ironically, the film FLATLINERS does 
the same thing about halfway through. It starts out a fascinating 
drama about a group of medical students who have found a way 
to induce death and bring themselves back to life, experiencing the 
mystery of the afterlife and living to tell abotu it. It ends up 
becoming a supernatural thriller reminiscent of the most 
mediocre Stephen King TV-movie adaptations.</P>
<P>        At the outset, Keifer Sutherland convinces a few of of his 
fellow students to help him with his death-cheatin' experiment, 
which calls for them to lower his body temperature and inject 
various chemicals into his blood stream until he flatlines. Kiefer 
flies over a giant field of flowers and trees for awhile. Then, thirty 
seconds later, they begin to raise his temperature and electroshock 
him back to life. Here, as with every other part of the movie where 
one of the flatliners is being brought back to life, director Joel 
Schumacher milks every drop of suspense he can get by making 
us think the students won't be able to bring their colleague back 
from the great beyond.</P>
<P>        Sutherland comes back blathering about the tunnel, the 
shining light and all that crap, and suddenly the other students want 
to experience it as well. Next comes Billy Baldwin, the stud of the 
bunch, whose personal afterlife involves quick cuts of beautiful 
women in various stages of undress, once again reinforcing my belief 
that heaven is an Aerosmith video. Finally, Kevin Bacon and Julia 
Roberts experience a few fleeting moments of death.</P>
<P>        But the movie's only halfway over, so we now some kind 
of complications will come along with these four manipulating the 
forces of nature. I just didn't think it would be a cross between BILL 
AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY and the ending of GHOSTBUSTERS. 
Suddenly everyone's worst memory of regret comes back to haunt 
them, Keifer's being an eight-year-old boy he inadertently killed 
when he was a child, Joe's in the form of all the women he's lied to 
for cheap sex (which he also secretly videotaped and sent to Bob 
Saget), Kevin's nightmare a ten-year-old girl he used to torment at 
school and Julia's her dead father.</P>
<P>        It's at this point the movie crashes and burns, becoming 
a second-rate horror/thriller. The topic of death is one that either 
interests or frightens everyone, and FLATLINERS could have taken 
more time to explore the theme instead of making it a plot device 
that brings the characters' worst feelings of guilt to life. In reality, 
the only guilt these people should feel is standing by and letting 
this movie die instead of doing something to save it.</P>
