LOVE & SEX
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>"Love is a minefield," Kate (Famke Janssen, Dr. Jean Gray in X-MEN) 
tells us in the introduction to LOVE & SEX.  "You take a step and are 
blown to pieces."  </P>
<P>This philosophical film by writer/director Valerie Breiman would have 
been more aptly titled REFLECTIONS ON RELATIONSHIPS, but, of course, the 
current title is a more marketable one.  Love and sex there is, but the 
characters spend more time discussing the twin subjects than engaging in 
them.  And when it comes to sex, Janssen would appear to have a 
no-nudity clause in her contract, since she stays partially clothed in 
situations which would much more naturally be engaged in without 
underwear.</P>
<P>Although most of the staging never quite rings true, the movie does 
commendably place both of the leads in real jobs that they actually go 
to.  Most cinematic characters appear to live off of some off-screen 
sugar daddy, permitting them to live without the toils of work.</P>
<P>Kate is a cubicle dweller at the headquarters of a women's magazine 
named "Monique."  Kate's only honest piece of writing -- about oral sex 
as a cure for depression -- is rejected by the magazine's eponymous 
owner, played without emotion by Ann Magnuson.  </P>
<P>"They say 'you have to kiss a lot of frogs to get a prince,'" Kate tells 
us before finding hers, an avant-garde painter named Adam (Jon Favreau, 
the crazy cop in THE REPLACEMENTS) who likes to paint things like a 
woman with a severed head coming out of her rear.  As her fourteenth man 
and his fourth woman -- these numbers are featured prominently in the 
storyline -- Adam and Kate form an instant relationship based on caustic 
wit.  He, for example, likes to call her by her school nickname of 
"horse face" and takes great delight in ridiculing her big feet.</P>
<P>"Hey, I believe in relationships.  Mine are just short ones," Kate 
explains to Adam after he finds out that he's number 14 on her 
relationship dance card.  "You're like a whore!" he tells her.  They 
have the sort of strange chemistry whereby they both think that it's 
funny that he calls her a whore.  They also enjoy sharing bedtime 
flatulence.</P>
<P>As they compete in the insults derby, in which he always wins, Adam and 
Kate become best friends.  They love arguing.  He tries to prove that 
men age better than women by asking, "Who's better looking: Sean Connery 
or Shelley Winters?" </P>
<P>The supporting cast of Kate's various other boyfriends includes Josh 
Hopkins as a Robert De Niro-obsessed porn star and Noah Emmerich as 
Eric, her number two.  Like the rest of the reflective characters, Eric 
is full of dating suggestions.  "Scheduled spontaneity is the key to 
long-term love," he says.</P>
<P>As witty as the script is, the direction is way off the mark.  The cast 
almost uniformly suffers from a bad of case of low energy.  Scenes seem 
designed more for cuteness than believability.  And never is the 
chemistry between Adam and Kate genuine, which is the kiss of death for 
a romantic comedy.</P>
<P>Although the movie has some wonderfully acerbic moments and some 
insightful parts, it is basically forgettable fluff.  You'll kind of 
enjoy it while you're there, but after you leave you'll wonder why you 
ever bothered.  </P>
<P>LOVE & SEX runs just 1:22.  It is rated R for language and sexual 
situations and would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
