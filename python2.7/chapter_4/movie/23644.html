<P>   When Bob Dylan sang "The Times They are a-Changing'"
some thirty years ago, not even he may have envisioned just
how much the world would transform itself by the turn of the
century.  The Iron Curtain is long gone, Vietnam and China
are edging toward prosperity, and even North Korea has
opened up serious negotiations with Japan, Australia and the
United States.  We're living in what NY Times journalist
Thomas P. Friedman calls the Global Society, a momentous
event that has impacted cultures in virtually every corner of
the planet.  As though to preface this great transfiguration,
small rebellions have been taking place in the families of
traditional cultures--the sons and daughters reacting against
the hidebound customs and cultures of their parents when
these practices have limited their freedom.  In Irish director
Damien O'Donnell's first feature, "East is East," adapted from
a staged play by Ayub Khan-Din, an Anglo-Pakistani family
living during the 1970s in the Manchester suburb of Salford is
a hotbed of insurrection.  The seven lively children of
Pakistani expatriate George Khan (Om Puri) and his English
wife Ella (Linda Bassett) are for the most part rejecting every
aspect of the culture to which their father clings while
embracing everything English from fish-and-chips to hot dogs
and ham to the local bimbos (who reject their own parents'
narrow-mindedness and embrace the young Khans).</P>
<P>   "East is East," which garnered awards in Britain
such as "Best British Film of the Yea"r from the London Film
Critics and from the Evening Standard and was nominated for
six BAFTA Awards including Best Picture, is alternately
riotous and dramatic in the best tradition of the genre and
features one of India's great performers, Om Puri, in the role
of the stressed-out father.  The subject of rebellion against
the culture of parents is hardly a new one in the movies. 
Who can forget poor Tevye in Norman Jewison's 1971
adaptation of Joseph Stein's musical "Fiddler on the Roof" as
a man trying preserve his family's Jewish heritage against
growing odds?  Just recently,  Soori Taraporevala adapted
Rohinton Mistry's book "Such a Long Journey" about a quiet,
decent man, Gustad Noble, who is angered that his son is
disobeying orders to go to engineering school.  What stands
out in all three stories is the depth of characterization: the
keeper of the legacy is not portrayed as an entirely
unsympathetic character, though the audience is coaxed to
root for the new.  Each in his own way has good reason to
opt for the antique ways in view of the seemingly anarchic
changes that the modern world is creating.  The urge to
preserve ancient cultures that have withstood the test of time
is understandable.</P>
<P>   George Khan, for example, is under a strain.  In his
Manchester suburb of 1971, war is being pursued by his
native Pakistan against India over possession of Kashmir. 
The crypto-fascist politician, Enoch Powell, is gaining some
support among the British people for his ideas of racial purity
and his suggested policy of repatriating all immigrants.  And
all but one or two of his seven children have assimilated into
English society, making friends with English neighbors--most
of whom display no anti-immigrant feeling.  While Maneer
(Emil Marwa) is the only obviously religious member of the
Khan children and Abdul (Raji James), is the typical good-boy
who always wears a suit, Saleem (Chris Bisson) attends art
school while feigning residence at an engineering academy; 
Meenah (Archie Panjabi), who is the only girl in the family,
eagerly plays soccer with the fellows on the street; Tariq is
the classic rebel disgusted with his father's backward-looking
presumptions; and Sajid (Jordan Routledge) is the source of
much of the picture's comedy as a 12-year-old boy who
forever wears a parka despite the October heat and who is
belatedly dragged to a doctor to be circumcised.</P>
<P>   When George's eldest son (Ian Aspinall) bolts from an
arranged wedding minutes before he is to take vows with the
woman he has just seen for the first time, George cracks
down on the others, determined to impose Pakistani culture
on his Anglo-Pakistani children.  George's English wife for the
past twenty-five years, Ella (Linda Bassett), is of two minds:
she wants her children to go their own way while determined
to have them respect George properly despite their
differences.  The various small incidents involving the playing
off of the father against each of his children and ultimately
committing an act of violence against this wife is climaxed in
a wonderful payoff scene involving a meeting between the
Khans and the family with whom George has arranged a
marriage for two of his children.  As uncomfortable and
insincere smiles give way to outright animosity, George Khan
is slowly led to an understanding that his children's world is
not the same as his own.</P>
<P>   Director O'Donnell crams in a great deal of comedy by
displaying the outdoor scenes involving the seductive
machinations of two local English girls toward the Khan
children and by ironically showing a small, bespectacled red-
haired kid distributing literature for Enoch Powell while
happily shouting "Salaam Aleikem" to George Khan and
playing happily with the Khans' youngest kid.</P>
<P>   The only aspect difficult to understand is that George would
ever marry a local woman, his children making the obvious
point that their embrace of the English culture is in no way
more daring that of their own dad.  The ensemble acting is
splendidly natural with Om Puri's charisma capturing the
attention of the audience, while Brian Tufano's camera
effectively illustrates the dismal banality of working-class
Manchester streets.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 96 minutes.  (C) 2000
