<P>Gus Van Sant is known for his quirky, bold, experimental features.
This film is a break with that tradition; what we've got in _Good Will
Hunting_ is a much slicker, more commercially viable film than I've
seen from him before.  In fact, he's made a film that could easily
have been hackneyed, we've seen it so many times -- the rebellious
youth tamed by his respect for an older, experienced man. Filmgoers
hoping for the verve and originality of _Drugstore Cowboy_ or My Own
Private Idaho_ will likely be disappointed.  But Van Sant proves with
this picture that he can do something more mainstream and palatable
with not just competence, but with a certain level of energy and
enthusiasm.  We have certainly seen this story before, but it's
been a while since we've seen it told this well.</P>
<P>Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a walking contradiction.  A young tough guy
from the wrong side of Boston, he spends his days roaming the streets
with his buddies, looking for trouble.  His nights, though, are spent
reading history and philosophy, and taking time out from his job as a
janitor at MIT to solve math problems that baffle Nobel Laureates.  Will
is a math genius with an eidetic memory; he is also an angry young man
who is on his way to a prison term when he is discovered by a Lambeau, 
a brilliant mathematician (played passably by Stellan Skarsgard), who
secures Will's release, on the condition that the two of them work
together -- and that Will agrees to see a therapist.</P>
<P>This last point is tricky, since Will is uncooperative, defensive, and
too smart for his own good, and runs circles around every therapist
he's sent to until he winds up in the hands of Lambeau's old college
roommate, Sean McGuire.  Sean is a brilliant burnout, a Harvard grad
who teaches at a community college and mourns the loss of his dead
wife.  And, at this point, the therapy starts to go somewhere -- for
Sean is from South Boston himself, and understands that the only way
to make any progress with Will is to win his trust.  Williams gives
one of the best performances of his career here, as we watch him teach
Will how to approach his life, even as he himself starts to awaken to
his own failures and what he needs to do about them.</P>
<P>These scenes with Will and Sean are often simply riveting, and they
alone would provide a perfectly good reason to see the picture.
Williams and Damon are great foils for each other; they bring two very
different sorts of energy to these scenes.  Damon, while not
delivering the film's best performance, has a way of bringing out the
finest in his co-stars; Williams flags a bit when Damon's not
onscreen, while Minnie Driver (playing Syklar, Will's love interest)
and Ben Affleck (as Chuckie, Will's best friend) really shine when
they're playing off Damon.</P>
<P>The film has difficulty holding itself together at times; Affleck and
Damon's script just doesn't have room to tell us everything we'd like
to know about the major characters; Driver's and Affleck's characters
would come off as rather cardboard were the actors not so skilled at
painting character in a few deft brushstrokes.  And the film hardly
compares to Van Sant's best work; the direction and writing, while
more than competent, are hardly making us take a fresh look at what
cinema can do.</P>
<P>Taken on its own, however, the film is engrossing and, at times,
startlingly moving.  And it does something that most films of this
troubled-youth genre don't do: it emphasizes that the most important
thing a person can do is learn to think and feel independently.  Too
many stories ask us to believe that rebellious youth should learn to
play by the rules; this one tells us that we should all be rebels --
but need to learn how to break only those rules that lie between us
and what we want.  Damon, Affleck, and Van Sant are telling us that
the cure for the rebel without a cause is not to stop rebelling; it's
to teach that rebel what a cause is, and let them find it themselves.</P>
