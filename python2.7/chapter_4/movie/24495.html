<P>        Former Denver Bronco Darrin Drozdov had an unusual talent: the
ability to vomit on command. That might not have been his ticket to a
job in Hollywood or a gig with one of the networks, but it was enough to
attract the attention of World Wrestling Federation czar Vince McMahon,
who had big plans for "Droz."</P>
<P> McMahon dubbed him Puke and planned to make him a star in the
WWF. Excited by the job offer, Drozdov called home. "You'll be real
proud of me, Mama," he says. "I'm now known as Puke."</P>
<P> Drozdov's is one of several funny/sad stories told in Barry W.
Blaustein's powerful documentary "Beyond the Mat," which looks not only
at the WWF, but also smaller establishments such as the All-Pro
Wrestling School (run by a rotund accountant who looks like a giant
Weeble) and Philadelphia's outrageously savage Extreme Championship
Wrestling, which Blaustein calls "the Ellis Island of wrestling, where
old wrestlers go to be reborn and new wrestlers go to be discovered."</P>
<P> Although the subject matter may not sound tremendously
appealing to non-fans of the showy sport, "Beyond the Mat" turns out to
be less interested in the cartoonish brutality of pro wrestling than it
is with the lives of the people who make their living in the ring. Much
of the violence is either carefully choreographed or faked, but when
they're not in the spotlight or in front of throngs of screaming fans,
the wrestlers themselves turn out to be candid, surprisingly low-key
guys.</P>
<P> The most pathetic of the bunch is former "Wrestlemania"
superstar Jake "The Snake" Roberts, who once fought in front of 80,000
people at the Pontiac Silverdome and now can be found performing in
cut-rate shows in places like Kearney, Neb. Roberts blames his squalid
family history -- he says he was conceived when his mother, then 13, was
raped by her mom's boyfriend -- and his frosty father for his drug
problems and his inability to reach out to his college-aged daughter, a
psychology major who acknowledges "he makes me nervous and I make him
nervous."</P>
<P> Other potentially troublesome father-child relationships are
brewing in Mick Foley's household. Just prior to a showdown with an
opponent who calls himself The Rock, Foley, known to WWF followers as
Mankind, is seen reassuring his young son Dewey and daughter Noelle that
Daddy won't get hurt at work. Sitting at ringside, however, the kids get
to see their father hurled into a column of speakers and beaten into
submission with a metal folding chair upside the head. Backstage, while
a plastic surgeon sews Foley's scalp back together, the wrestler tries
again to explain to Noelle that the gashing wound is "just a boo-boo."</P>
<P> Why would a grown man keep on doing this kind of thing? Perhaps
the answer lies in the life of Terry Funk, a legendary figure in
wrestling circles. Against his doctor's advice and his family's wishes,
the 53-year-old insisted on continuing his career because vanity and
pride demand it. If there's a recurring theme in "Beyond the Mat," it's
that these men will always run to the limelight, even if they have to
trample on the feelings of those around them to get there.</P>
<P> And, wherever guys are willing to put their bodies on the line,
you can bet there will be producers like McMahon ready to exploit and
promote them. McMahon, who reportedly tried to suppress the movie, comes
across as the consummate opportunist, a man who runs new talent through
the mill, feasts on the results and tosses out the leftovers. Even when
he's smiling and lighthearted, there's a fierceness in his eyes that's
downright spooky.</P>
<P> Blaustein, who wrote the screenplays for Eddie Murphy's "The
Nutty Professor" and "Coming to America," has a sharp eye and a knack
for getting his cameras in the right place at the right time. For
instance, rather than shooting the big match between The Rock and
Mankind, he instead turns his focus to the horrified reactions of
Foley's wife and children, all of whom are in tears long before the
finale. The resulting footage is absolutely heartbreaking, a reminder
that even phoney battles can provoke some very real emotions. James
