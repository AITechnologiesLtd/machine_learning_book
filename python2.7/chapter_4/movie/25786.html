<P>Don't get me wrong - I love me some straight-up comedy, and thus, looked
forward to seeing THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY this weekend - but
there's nothing that takes me back to The Day like The Big Lizard.  Man,
I remember all those campy GODZILLA flicks as a kid, watching them on
"Bill Kennedy's Sunday Movie" on channel 50 in Detroit just before my
sisters and I had to go to Sunday School.  It was a good memory, damn
near besmirched by Hollywood's special effects (and lack of soul) in its
lame Matthew Broderick-starring remake a couple years back.  When I
heard that Japan's Toho Studios had done their own GODZILLA update last
year, I couldn't wait to see the Real, True Lizard in all his
badly-dubbed glory.  My only question was, would he hold up to a G2K
treatment?</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Worrying about the plot of a GODZILLA movie is like trying to understand
the dialogue in a porno flick, but if you insist...</P>
<P>In an obvious continuation of previous Japanese GODZILLA movies, the
Godzilla Prediction Mobile team of Yuji Shinoda (Takehiro Murata) and
his young daughter Io (Mayu Suzuki), along with Roving Reporter Yuki
Ichinose (Naomi Nishida), want to study the city-stompin' - but
otherwise cute (in an ugly sort of way) - giant lizard known as Godzilla
(Tsutomu Kitagawa, under that rubber suit).  But not the Evil Folk of
the Crisis Control Intelligence agency [CCI, eh?  Hmmm...].  Where the
GPM wants to study Godzilla to learn ways to harness his power for Good,
the CCI agents - director Mitsuo Katagiri (Hiroshi Abe) and his
sidekick, Shiro Mayazaki (Shiro Sano) - take the American Approach: if
you don't understand it, destroy it.</P>
<P>The twist in this, the 23rd movie in the GODZILLA series, comes from a
mysterious big rock the CCI finds underwater and investigates as a
"possible alternate fuel source".  When they try to bring the big rock
up to the surface, they find it may not be what it appears to be at
first glance.  And since Godzilla can wreak only so much local havoc,
and he needs an ObAlien to fight against these days...well, you get the
idea.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
The point above - about GODZILLA 2000 being a continuation of previous
flicks - is an important one because it starts out, seemingly, where
those previous versions left off.  The existence of Godzilla Prediction
Mobile Unit is supposed to make perfect sense to the audience, because
we are given only a minimal background on it.  Or any of the characters,
for that matter - including Godzilla, who just shows up at the beginning
of the movie, tearin' stuff up, which the movie's citizens take in
stride, as if it happened all the time.</P>
<P>Indeed, I didn't get what was going on in the movie until about the
halfway point; up to then, GODZILLA 2000 was just a bunch of disjointed
scenes that I figured would gel into an understandable story, sooner or
later.  Not that this was a problem for me; part of the fun of watching
a GODZILLA flick, after all, is laughing at the dubbing, the cheesy
music and special effects, the campy overacting, and most of all, the
patented Godzilla screech and fireball.</P>
<P>All of which the audience got, in spades.  Well, mostly.  Almost all of
those classic elements were firmly in place, and even updated with a
'90s sensibility.  The music and special effects were still cheesy
(check out the underwater scenes), and the acting just as stoically
intense, even when saying lines like "Hey, did you see that flying rock
go by?", or staging a Three Stooges-like slapstick scene (that only
nominally worked).  One noticeable "improvement" that didn't work for
me, however, was the special effects fireball.  This new version, in a
word, sucked.  It looked as if Godzilla's mouth was unnaturally set on
fire every time it happened, and I longed for Godzilla's old firerings.</P>
<P>An update that did work well, though, was the use of current computers
by some the character; I got a kick out of seeing Apple iMacs and G3s in
the background, though I have to wonder about Compaqs being used as
Serious Scientific Equipment [she said, waiting for the ObComplaints
from Compaq lovers].  The whole product placement issue - there were
advertiser stickers seemingly everywhere - had me wondering whether this
was standard fare in Japanese movies these days.  And whether U.S.
studios are looking to follow this trend.</P>
<P>Fun, too, was the dubbed dialogue, and the patchwork editing.  I don't
know what was better: watching the GPM team driving at first far behind,
then parallel to Godzilla, a la Twister, only to pull up miles in front
of him, driving toward him, in the very next jumpcut - or hearing a
English dub of a Japanese character telling someone, "Bite me!".</P>
<P>If this were any other movie, I'd spend time Obsessing about how
Godzilla magically tears only so much stuff up, then stops for the
night, as if a referee blew a Time Out whistle (or for that matter, what
Godzilla does in between movies).  But asking for logic in a GODZILLA
movie is like wondering whether world wide rasslin' is real.  You have
to either accept what you see as part of the thrill of the show, or
totally wash your hands of it.</P>
<P>Its minor flaws aside, the goofy GODZILLA 2000 is a fun, mindless way to
spend an hour or two in the theater; you have to hang up your Disbelief
Issues at the door, but other than that, it's an easy ride.  But I think
Yuji got it wrong: I think what he meant to say is, "there's a little
bit of all of *us* in Godzilla"...</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
All the Camp, none of the Matthew Broderick.  Thank you, Toho Studios,
for taking me back down Memory Lane.</P>
<P>GODZILLA 2000 (rating: greenlight):
You Haven't Lived until you hear and see a Japanese film in which the
line "kwit yer bitchin'" is dubbed.</P>
