<PRE>How Unholy Wood made me eat my words. </PRE>
<P>Recently, in a benevolent mood I wrote that Hollywood remakes 
are generally worse than the originals, with some exceptions. 
"Diabolique" reminds me that I was too kind, that the enormous 
majority of remakes are bad. And they can stink when you know 
the orginal, like the classic thriller-suspenser by 
Henri-Georges Clouzot, "Les Diaboliques" of 1955.</P>
<P>The plot. A boarding school for boys somewhere in the 
mountains of Pennsylvania, within easy driving distance to 
Pittsburgh. The establishement was inherited by Mia (Adjani) 
who suffers from 1) a weak heart and 2) lousy husband Guy 
(Palminteri). He is the headmaster, rules the roost, abuses 
Mia, has as a mistress Nicole (Stone), whom he regularly beats 
up. </P>
<P>The two women are teachers and friends. The school is a manor 
that ought to be shabby and run down, but that's not made 
clear. Shabby, because Guy is also an s.o.b. who skimps on 
food, feeds the kids and the staff disgusting things. He 
doesn't even have the swimming pool cleaned. ("Dirty pool" 
applies both literally and figuratively to the plot). The 
women, fully aware of each one's relations and relationship 
with Guy, decide to kill him.  </P>
<P>End of plot so far as this review is concerned. For two 
reasons. First, because what little you might get from the 
movie depends entirely on the twists and gimmicks. Second, to 
honor the memory of Mr. Clouzot, his wishes must be followed. 
When his film was shown there was a final "don't divulge the 
end" plea to the audience.</P>
<P>That's probably where Alfred Hitchcock got the idea of doing 
something like this for his "Psycho." Hitchcock loved "Les 
Diaboliques" and its source book. Unable to get permission to 
remake it, he used another novel ("From Among the Dead," which 
some critics wrongly translate as "Between Deaths"), by the 
same writers, and made "Vertigo," a gem with an improbable 
plot.  </P>
<P>The new version follows its model in bizarre ways. Many parts 
are copied scene-for-scene, other not. Even when copied, those 
sections always manage to do something stupid or cheap. 
Consistent with Hollywoodmania for sex and violence, the 
remake heavily insists on both, while the original was subtle 
on sex and had more shocks, suspense and surprises than 
violence. Like Hitchcock.</P>
<P>In the French film, the mistress was the excellent, already 
famous Simone Signoret; the wife was the unknown Vera Clouzot, 
then the director's wife. Signoret had presence and nuances. 
Clouzot was a born victim totally subjugated by both Signoret 
and Paul Meurisse, the husband. </P>
<P>Here, Sharon Stone mercilessly overdoes her hardness and 
cynical repartees, so much that she telegraphs plot 
developments. She's so hard that SS could easily play an SS 
guard. </P>
<P>Tarted up with heavy makeup, tight clothes (selected by 
herself) in terrible taste, with tops that never miss a chance 
to show her breasts, she's like a floozy. In the movie's 115 
minutes she does not once crack smile. How mechanical.</P>
<P>Adjani, at the start, has a full nudity scene. Her body is 
beautiful body, not just for a 40-year old but for any woman. 
But it is used only as a cheap, gratuitous come-on. She has 
minimal expressions and in general is a ninny. </P>
<P>As in the French film, Nicole is the strong one of the pair, 
Mia by far the weaker. But she lacks the wispiness, the 
convincing frailty and ill health, the helplessness, the 
pathetic religiosity of Vera Clouzot. </P>
<P>The school's staff is very small. Spalding Gray and the fine 
Alan Garfield have microscopic, irrelevant parts, unlike those 
of their atmosphere-enhancing French counterparts. The latter 
help set the mood for the women's fatal decision. The remake 
makes a flat mess even of the model's superior dining room 
scene, where rotten fish was served. </P>
<P>Nobody is more than skin-deep in version 2. While we don't 
need full-fledged background records or psychological 
analyses, all characters are paper thin.
Thrown in are two young men who are doing a promotional video 
for the school. It's plain padding. Thrown in too is an overt 
lesbian relationship instead of the original's hints.</P>
<P>Worse yet, Adjani has a scene where, after being disgustingly 
insulted by Palminteri, she revels in a kiss, with absolutely 
illogical and uncharacteristic passion. Cut to vigorous sex 
.. but wait, this is between Stone and Palmenteri! </P>
<P>The French police inspector was played by talented veteran 
Charles Vanel, who, I am told, was the model for Lieutenant 
Columbo. Vanel, like Signoret, had a weighty presence. Here, 
to feminize the movie, he's replaced by private investigator 
Cathy Bates. Her presence is depressing, her sleuthing 
improbable. </P>
<P>Bates is addressed as "detective," as in " What do you think, 
detective?" I've never heard this turn of speech before. Her 
character's name is Shirley. There's another Shirley in the 
cast, the likable actress Shirley Knight, in another 
depressing role. The odd thing is that she is not even 
mentioned in the blurbs given to the press. Sic transit...</P>
<P>Now to Mr. Palminteri and all that Chazz. Where the original's 
Meurisse was a diabolical, malevolent snake, Palminteri is 
just a coarse, crass, vulgar brute. It's like replacing a 
sports car with a dumpster.</P>
<P>The cardinal sin is the doctoring up the French film's climax, 
one of the cleverest, most unexpected and startling in the 
history of movie thrillers. Be prepared for more cheap and 
dumb turns, false twists, Grand Guignol and additional 
crassness.</P>
<P>The camera-work is OK though overdone and showy. Hitchcock 
would never have tolerated it. Strange too are the close-ups 
of Adjani that often elongate her face, like an El Greco 
painting or a CinemaScope film projected through  a regular 
lens. Beats me.  </P>
<P>The film is soporific. Instead of being an edge-of-the seat 
affair, it is a bottom-of-the-seat proposition. The torpor is 
intercut by the music's sudden bursts of energy, drumbeats and 
all, with imitations of Hitchcock scores by the great Bernard 
Herrmann.</P>
<P>Get the French film or most any Hitchcock movie.</P>
