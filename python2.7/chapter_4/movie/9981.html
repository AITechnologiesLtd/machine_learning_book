<P>Anastasia        
Directors: Don Bluth and Gary Goldman
With the Voice talents of: Meg Ryan, John Cusak, Christopher Lloyd, Kelsey
Grammar, Angela Lansbury, Bernadette Peters, and Hank Azaria
Approx Running time: 90 min.</P>
<P>The battle between ex-Disney animator Don Bluth and his former employers
began back in 1982 when Bluth's company created the marvelous "The Secret of
NIMH". At the time, Bluth hit Disney when it was most vulnerable; the
animation market was down, and cartoons were merely for children. As Disney
regained its prominence in the industry, Bluth was unable to compete, and
subsequent films failed both critically and at the box office. (With very few
exceptions.) Thanks to 20th century Fox (and a hefty budget) Bluth has
managed to combine state-of-the-art computer animation technology with a sort
of live-action feel that sends a loud and clear message to Disney; there's a
new kid in town.</P>
<P>Anastasia tells the story of a young princess separated from her family at
the age of 10. The evil Rasputin sells his soul in order to wipe the Romanov
family out of Russia. What he doesn't count on is the young girl being left
behind. She soon forgets her past and is raised by peasants, only to be given
hope by a couple of con-men who think they can pass her off to the queen as
the real princess.</P>
<P>Anastasia is replete with standard ingredients of an animated film. There is
romance, characters spontaneously bursting into song, and an evil bearded
character with gruff voice and a goofy sidekick. But Anastasia also offers
inventive storytelling, and some breathtaking sequences (one in which the
characters step into a Monet-like painting and continue to dance in front of
impressionist backgrounds)</P>
<P>Somehow, the "Magic of Bluth" created for me a feeling that I was watching
something real, something very human. There were few, if any, moments that
made me think that this absolutely had to be a cartoon. Of course there is
the fantastic element, and a talking albino bat, but the 3 years Bluth and
Co. put into this picture really shows that they wanted to capture something
important, emotion.</P>
<P>Anastasia is brimming with color and excitement. Plenty of computer razzle
dazzle, and some fun vocal performances. There couldn't have been a better
choice for the lead character than Meg Ryan. She brings her feisty attitude
(much like her character in French Kiss) and plenty of feeling to her
character. Christopher Lloyd follows the villain school of voice overs, rule
number one, "you must either be British or throaty." Since Rasputin was
Russian, he chose "throaty" but was menacing nonetheless as a living corpse
who's gimmick was that body parts fell off at random. (Eyeballs popping out,
hands falling off, lips sliding down his beard.) His sidekick, Bartok the
albino bat, was voiced by the marvelous Hank Azaria who really brings his
style of humor to the character. His adorable character is reminiscent of
Nathan Lane's fantastic "Timon" from the Lion King, though sadly, Azaria has
half the screen time.</P>
<P>Anastasia didn't have for me the power that Beauty and the Beast or The Lion
King did, but it is more than a "valiant effort" at dethroning the Disney
champs. If Bluth in his collaboration with 20th Century Fox can manage to
string together a few successes like Anastasia, the history of animation in
film will change forever.</P>
<P>3 1/2 stars out of 4
