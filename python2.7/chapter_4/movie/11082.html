<P>   When one of the characters in this vibrant, fast-moving,
romantic comedy conveys the view, "We are animals; you'd
better accept that," he utters a biologically provable fact.  Julie
Davis, who wrote, produced and edited the film at the age of
twenty-seven underscores the word "we."  Before women
embraced the birth control pill some decades back, it was the
male of the species which heeded this reality: females, the
only gender which can become pregnant, were expected to
ward off the particularly amorous embraces of their boy
friends until marriage.</P>
<P>   The culture of the 1990's in America is remarkably and
thankfully different from the mores of the fifties.  Women
embrace sex with the same eagerness as their male
companions, one of their the significant strides toward 
equality.  Some women hold out, seemingly trapped in a
1950's time warp, but if their own best friends and female
confidants no longer support their virginal convictions, the
maidens can be mighty lonely, not to say horny.  "I Love
You...Don't Touch Me" exploits the possibilities of this theme
in a movie which, however sitcomish, does indeed work to
generate laughs and whose pace and dizzying array of
characters come at us, so to speak, so briskly that we haven't
time to concern ourselves about their superficiality.  What is
exceptional about this autobiographical picture is that it was
made for just $64,000, yet retains a glossy, commercial look
and features performers well known to the TV audience who
waived compensation  while strutting their stuff.  "I Love
You...Don't Touch Me" is targeted to a 20-something audience
of single women, a constituency that has been left behind by
equally funny sitcoms like "The Brothers McMullen," which tell
their tales from the male point of view.</P>
<P>   Katie (Marla Schaffel), who is at the center of this feathery
comedy, is a women with a talent for singing who has been
as unable to break into the music field as she has been
helpless to surrender her 25-year-old virginity.  She has a boy
friend, Ben (Mitchell Whitfield), who loves her enough to
obsess about her to his psychotherapist (Sara Van Horn), but
Katie feels no physical attraction in return.  Nor does Katie
think of the male market as offering anything but trolls,
perverts and liars, a viewpoint which affects her career.  "You
understand the music," explains her voice coach, "But you
don't feel it."  When her friend Elizabeth (Nancy Sorel)
announces her engagement, Katie moans, "Now my mother
will give me more s..." and when her promiscuous friend
Janet (Meredith Scott Lynn)--described as "Barbra Streisand
on speed"--expresses contempt for Katie's sexual innocence,
Katie feels isolated.  When a celebrated musician comes into
her life, the 47-year-old Richard Webber (Michael Harris),
Katie finally falls head over heels (literally), a shock which
causes her to reconsider her priorities.</P>
<P>   Marla Schaffel rewards us with her fine singing voice and a
talent for finding the humor in her conflicted character.  A
woman whose mind wants stability but whose body craves
sex, her Katie realizes that it's no fun to stay in an ivory tower
of celibacy--that you have to kiss many frogs before you can
embrace your prince, and she is able supported by Meredith
Scott Lynn as her rollicking opposite, Mitchell Whitfield as her
good-guy friend and Darryl Theirse as her orgy-loving next-
door neighbor.  The film boasts a lively sound track with
songs like "Goin' Nowhere" and "There Will Never Be Another
You" among its twenty-three hits.</P>
<P>   In her debut as a writer-director, Julie Davis scores big with
the one-liners, offering her audience at Sundance and, now,
to a larger constituency of primarily young, single, a voice
they will appreciate.  Though the audience will be ahead of
her characters, able to foresee the conclusion five or ten
minutes into the story, the chief virtue of the project is the
recognizability of the characters, however predictable.  Some
have already compared Ms. Davis to early Woody Allen, but it
would be safer to compare her to a budding Neil Simon, when
that playwright was more interested in a succession of quips
(as in his 1961 "Come Blow Your Horn") than in the shaping
of a solid story (as in his 1984 "Biloxi Blues").  With the
steadfastness that Ms. Davis, a Dartmouth College graduate,
appears to have, we will conceivably not have to wait as long
for works which are equally funny while flirting with greater
complexity.  Rated R.  Running time: 95 minutes.  (C) Harvey
