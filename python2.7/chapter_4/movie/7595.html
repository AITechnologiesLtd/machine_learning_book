<PRE>                              A CHEF IN LOVE
                      A film review by Bradley Null
                       Copyright 1997 Bradley Null</PRE>
<P>.     The title character of A Chef In Love is a Frenchman with equal
passions for his restaurant and his lover.  These dual passions create
an unusual love triangle which, like most of the film's political,
romantic, and historical issues, is never quite resolved.</P>
<P>     Like the contemporary The English Patient, A Chef In Love is
structured around countless flashbacks and takes pleasure in confusing
our sense of time and place.  It ultimately becomes apparent that these
flashbacks present a love story which takes place in pre-Soviet Georgia,
and our chef's female love interest is a member of that country's
aristocracy.  Both of the chef's passionate romances become troubled
when the Communist revolution threatens his prosperity, and he is forced
to choose loyalty to one of his loves.  This story is recounted in a
compilation of old letters and diary entries which have been delved up
by the woman's son and the chef's niece.</P>
<P>     Originally, the woman's son, Anton, is completely unaware of his
mother's past relationship and his parents's past identities.  However,
in an early flashback we see Anton's father chasing his mother with a
knife muttering the name of this chef.  This serves to quickly verify an
unresolved conflict that Anton becomes eager to uncover.  The flavor of
this subjective flashback, in which the fleeing mother suddenly becomes
a turkey and is slaughtered by her husband, establishes the confusion
and complexities packed within this film.  Throughout, we are taken by
surprise as the narrative jumps from past to present, uncovering new
evidence and then addressing the effect that the discovery of it has had
on Anton.</P>
<P>     This flashback structure also adds to the film's theme of
repetition and circularity.  For example, the camera commonly lingers
over the same entrees and artwork in both the past and the present,
creating a sense of timelessness for the film's subject.  The settings
and other decor in the film are also quite beautiful.  However,
throughout, the camera's persistently tight frame prevents us from
enjoying the grandness of these exotic locations and feasts.  This
denial of spectacle serves to focus attention more tightly on the
complex love triangle and the tension it causes, which is developed up
to the last frame of the film.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, this preoccupation with the lovers forces most of
the others characters into flat and subservient roles.  For example,
Anton, although he discovers a whole new side of both his mother and
father, is denied the screen time to deal with these issues.  Likewise,
Anton's father is given just enough screen time for us to realize his
complexities, but not enough for us to understand them.  The most
egregious oversight however, is of Marcelle, the cook's niece, who is
not characterized at all, and ultimately serves to merely jump-start the
narrative by bringing these diary pieces to Anton.</P>
<P>     As a mature romance, A Chef In Love is the most compelling film to
come along in a long time (far superior to The English Patient). 
However, it is almost regrettable to witness so many interesting
characters and subplots being neglected for the sake of a single, albeit
interesting, story.</P>
