<PRE>                    SCARFACE [1983]</PRE>
<P>   A retro reveiw by: Richard Matich
I really did'nt like this Brian De Palma film very
much. It is a remake of the Howard Hawks film from
1932, and it is so dirty and violent that the shooting
and bombing become just a tactic to keep you from
turning away. The movie was so hyped at the time of
it's release that it does not live up to the praise</P>
<P>heaped upon it from wild eyed  Brian De Palma or Al
Pacino fans. At 170 minutes in length, the film is just
non stop brutal killing and screaming in Cuban accents.
De Palma directs himself a sleazy, cruelty ridden, and
cut rate Godfather. Palm trees, silk shirts, hit men,
cocaine, and bullets being sprayed at the drop of a
hat. Scarface is a movie that is absolutly desperate
for somebody's attention, and that is why you should
not give it yours!</P>
