<P>As a Canadian and fellow countryman of director David Cronenberg's, I have
always appreciated his visionary style of movie making with all the subtlety
of a violent storm.  Cronenberg rips into the very body of science fiction
and horror and then stands back and  holds its beating heart in his hand.  I
admire his approach to the material and the films where he has served as
both director and author or co-author of the screenplays are among his best
work.  Cronenberg's vision is comparable to that of a mad scientist.  His
work is always layered with the unorthodox and sinister sides of the human
soul and by this description I mean it as the highest possible compliment
because after all, his intention is to scare movie audiences into a frenzy
and although his films often have a sickening side to them, that's just in
his nature to show it that way.</P>
<P>Cronenberg began his career making short films in 1966 with a little number
entitled 'Transfer'.  Not only did he serve as the film's writer, director,
and producer, but he photographed and edited the project himself.  He first
gained a major following with his 1975 effort 'Shivers' and made 'Rabid'
(1977), 'Fast Company' and 'The Brood', both in 1979 before the film that
really would solidify him as a major film maker, 'Scanners' (1981) which was
about a form of mental telepathy that could pressurize and explode human
heads.  That film is his most cult like and chilling statement and he would
tackle Hollywood productions with 'The Dead Zone' (1983), and 'The Fly'
(1986), which won an Oscar for its incredible make-up.  Cronenberg's last
four films before 'eXistenZ', 'Dead Ringers' (1988), 'Naked Lunch' (1991),
'M Butterfly' (1993) and 'Crash' (1996) all show his ability to get better
with age and his maturity as a film maker remains intact.  'Naked Lunch' was
thought to be a story impossible to film, based on the literary work of
William S. Burroughs, and while I didn't like the film, I could see its art
which was brought to new heights by the incredibly droning and dream like
dialogue Cronenberg injected into the film.  'eXistenZ' is certainly made
with the Cronenberg stamp placed on it and the film is a perfect way to
usher in the new millennium as it plays on our fears and intimidating
feelings about technology.</P>
<P>Jennifer Jason Leigh is Allegra Geller, a designer of virtual reality games
who wants to test her latest invention on a focus group gathered one
evening, and they see her as a god who has designed some of the best games
ever made.  A member of the security team named Ted Pikul (Jude Law) fails
to protect her at the meeting and she's shot and pursued by her competitors
who want her dead for their own agenda.</P>
<P>The game is called eXistenZ and it's played by plugging into a human being's
bio port which is on the lower back and is sort of like an electrical outlet
inserted through the area to put a hole in the spine where all data connects
and draws the user into a virtual reality game where it is impossible to
tell reality from all the rest.  Allegra and Ted flee the shooting scene and
stop on a country road to assess their situation and Allegra persuades Ted
to have a bio port installed on his body and it's done at a small,
by-the-road service station by a character named Gas (Willem Dafoe).
Apparently, having a bio port installed is as easy as having your ears
pierced and we assume that this film is set many years in the future because
real life technology like this hasn't even been invented yet.  Let alone the
fact that a patent on such an idea would be very hard to get.</P>
<P>And that's where 'eXistenZ' really picks up and runs with the ball as it is
an original idea done with all the wet gore you would expect from a David
Cronenberg film.  It's suspenseful, darkly lit, but is really for die hard
Cronenberg fans who will enjoy it best.  The chemistry works well between
Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law and other interesting performances in the
film come from Don McKellar, Ian Holm and Callum Keith Rennie with a cameo
by Sarah Polley.  The only thing missing is a cameo by Cronenberg himself in
some small way which would have been a nice touch.  The film's subject
matter is a metaphor for drug use, sexual escapades and violent frustrations
and Cronenberg's the sole author of the film's screenplay and calls his own
shots all the way.</P>
<P>Not only is the film a story about virtual reality but that's exactly the
way the film plays before an incredible twist comes near the end of its
appropriate running time of 97 minutes.  Not too short and not too long is
the way a film like this should be made.  By making it appeal to our
attention span which would probably hold up as long as if we really were
playing a game.</P>
