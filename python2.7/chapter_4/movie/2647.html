<PRE>    KHAL-NAAIKAA
        A film review by Mark R.Leeper
         Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>     At this writing we are just back from Baltic Europe and I thought you
might find of interest some comments I made on my last trip, to India when I
went to see a sort of horror film in Hindi.</P>
<P>     During the Great Depression when people were working long hours for
small rewards, the film industry decided that people need glamor in their
lives. Movies became more glamorous and movie theaters became movie
palaces.  You paid your few cents for a ticket and you entered a world of
opulence.  Most of the palaces are now history or falling apart.  In India,
however, where the world's largest film industry still thrives, the concept
of the movie palace is still going strong.  The Raj Mandir in Jaipur is the
second-best theater in all of Asia according to the Lonely Planet guide.  It
is an impressive building, with mirrored interiors, pink decor, and rounded
rampways to higher floors.  The theater's capacity is about 1300 people.  As
we approached, a huge movie board announced it was showing Kumar's KHAL-
NAAIKAA.  For as little as Rs7 for the front row to Rs18 for the Diamond
Box, you can see a film on the big screen (about twenty-five feet high and
fifty feet wide).  (A rupee is about three cents.)  We each got into line.
They have separate lines for men and women.  No hanky-panky in line!  The
women's line went faster so Evelyn bought the tickets. We went inside and
admired the interiors for a while, then the lights dimmed.</P>
<P>     KHAL-NAAIKAA is about two-and-a-half hours long and the plot was not
hard to follow even if it was entirely in Hindi.  What helped especially was
what Evelyn pointed out how familiar the plot actually was.  This was
Bombay's two-and-a-half-hour musical remake of THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE
CRADLE.  Now we never bothered to see this film, but we did hear what the
plot was and it was pretty much all there, including the governess's weird
motive for her evil and even a greenhouse murder that exactly repeated the
scene in the coming attraction for the American film.  Just why anyone needs
a greenhouse in India would be anybody's guess.  Mr.  Kumar is not one to
take only partial advantage of the unenforcibility of copyright law.  He is
a very thorough thief. But what about is this about it being a musical?
Well, just about all Indian films are musicals regardless of subject matter.
This was the very first psychotic killer musical we had ever seen, but we
bet others in the audience had seen more than enough psycho-killer musicals.
Before I get to the film itself, I want to mention one more thing about the
theater itself.  The ceiling of the screening room is highly fluted and
apparently at least two birds were nesting there and at inopportune times
would fly in front of the screen.  Kumar was often very creative in how he
put in his production numbers. The heroine is singing a production number
on television at one point and the villainess reaches into the television
screen and pulls out the heroine and the two sing together.  A second grab
at the heroine causes her to fall back into the screen.  All during this
scene the Venetian blinds, which are white on one side and red on the other,
flash from red to white and back.  Rebecca DeMornay is fairly attractive and
the part calls for her to be seductive.  The Indian woman who plays the same
role does fill the bill.</P>
<P>     One of the things that helps the understanding is that there is a lot
of English language used in the film.  Scenes in a doctor's office are in
English and a fair number of English phrases are used at odd moments.
People say, "I love you," in English.  It seems odd to go to Jaipur to see a
version of THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, but you do learn a fair amount
about Indian culture from the experience and it is a comfortable and
pleasant three hours.</P>
