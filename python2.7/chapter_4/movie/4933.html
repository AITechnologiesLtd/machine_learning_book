<PRE>RATING:  ***  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1987)</PRE>
<P>   ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING is mindless, formulaic, unsophisticated, and
disposable ... and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  We've seen the premise of the
movie before, most recently in FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF.  On a Friday
night, four suburban youngsters venture out into the unfamiliar city (in
this case, Chicago) and suffer through an exhausting series of
misadventures.  Elizabeth Shue plays a beautiful baby-sitter who is
responsible for looking after a little girl (who idolizes the superhero
Thor), her 15-year-old brother (who is smitten by Shue), and his wild
friend.</P>
<P>   ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING wants us to believe that during the course of
their escapades, these four youngsters come to better understand
themselves and each other.  By the end of the movie, they are supposed to
be wiser and more mature than they were at the beginning.  However, the
plot situations in ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING, as well as the relationships
between the characters and the lessons they learn, are altogether
unoriginal.  The movie does not balance its extreme fantasy with a strong
enough dose of reality.  The fantasy is amusing but sometimes so
exaggerated that first-time director Chris Columbus undermines his own
attempts to generate any real dramatic credibility; a case in point is the
scene in which the little girl gets stranded on a window ledge 40 stories
high.  And yet despite these considerations, ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING is
irresistibly entertaining, thanks to its charming cast and keen sense of
humor.</P>
<P>   As in the film STAND BY ME, the success of ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING
lies primarily on the shoulders of four young and unproven actors.  These
four newcomers appear in nearly every frame of the film, and consequently
the strength of their performances determines whether the movie floats or
sinks.  ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING not only floats, it sails.  The young
actors save the film from its limitations and make it a worthwhile
endeavor.</P>
<P>   Elizabeth Shue, as the reluctant baby-sitter, is a natural; her
performance is enchanting.  She is a joy to watch from beginning to end
and seems completely comfortable in front of the camera.  With a
mischievous twinkle in her eye, Maia Brewton is cute and convincing as the
Thor-loving little girl who likes to tease her brother, steal eclairs, and
sometimes even climb skyscrapers.  Keith Coogan plays the little girl's
15-year-old brother, Brad, a freshman with a big crush on Shue (a
senior).  Coogan gives his character a delightful balance of awkwardness,
embarrassment, bravado, and charm.  He is particularly effective in the
scenes that deal with his hopeless admiration and growing respect for
Shue.  Although Anthony Rapp's role as Brad's friend is less substantial,
he is appealing nevertheless.</P>
<P>   The movie's loosely-structured plot is merely an excuse to have these
characters come together and interact.  These four young newcomers have
such great chemistry that I grew quite fond of them, even in an uninspired
and cliche-ridden story.  In fact, by the end of the film, I felt as if I
had made four new friends.</P>
<P>   ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING has another thing going for it: a wonderful
sense of humor.  Several scenes in the film are exceptionally clever.  For
example, Shue and her three wards at one point find themselves singing the
blues in an all-black nightclub.  The sequence yields the movie's funniest
one-liner.</P>
<P>   Regrettably,  the movie fails to make a lasting impression.  The
characters don't learn anything new, unusual, or enlightening from their
adventures.  Unlike THE BREAKFAST CLUB, a superior film which successfully
combined comedy and drama, ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING has very little
dramatic intensity or lingering emotional impact.  Columbus introduces
several serious, underlying themes into the movie, but he never fully
develops them.  These shortcomings, however, do not significantly flaw
BABYSITTING because its dramatic aspirations are not as lofty as those of
a film like THE BREAKFAST CLUB.  In any case, ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING
does succeed in fulfilling its primary function, which is to provide
diverting, humorous, and (alas) forgettable summer entertainment.</P>
