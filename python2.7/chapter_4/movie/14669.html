<P>     One of the things you've gotta love about Hollywood marketing people
is their occasional bouts with irony deficiency.  If you trusted
television advertisements for HOLY MAN, you'd probably suspect that it was
a raucous Eddie Murphy comedy where the star spends most of the film
mocking and deflating uptight media types.  That's because Touchstone
Pictures' marketing department knew it'd have one hellacious time trying
to sell HOLY MAN for what it really is:  a somber, sincere
satire-cum-cautionary tale in which Eddie Murphy, despite his lead
billing, generally plays second fiddle to Jeff Goldblum.</P>
<P>     The wonderful, awful irony comes from the "message" of HOLY MAN.
Goldblum plays Ricky Hayman, the programming director for Miami-based Good
Buy Shopping Network.  Faced with lagging sales at the network and
mounting personal debt, Ricky realizes he has to do something to turn
things around fast.  Fate intervenes when Ricky and colleague Kate Newell
(Kelly Preston) nearly run over an apparently homeless man calling himself
"G" (Murphy).  A few plot contrivances later, G wanders onto the Good Buy
set and on the air, becoming an instant phenomenon by lending his New Age
philosophizing to the hawking of chainsaws and electronic beauty aids.  As
G's success reinvigorates Ricky's career, Ricky begins to wonder whether
it's more important to be honest with people than to use any means
available to sell to them.</P>
<P>     Pretty good gag, huh?  Only the joke will be on viewers who expect to
have their funny bones tickled, but instead get a nearly two-hour lecture
on the evils of consumerism.  And what an achingly strident lecture at
that, with Goldblum twitching and furrowing his brow every few seconds to
make sure we understand he's in the middle of a Jerry Maguire-sized crisis
of conscience, caught between Preston as the angel on one shoulder and
Robert Loggia as the devilish network boss on the other.  Murphy,
meanwhile, gets a few devilish moments of his own -- you know, the ones in
the commercials -- but essentially spends the film's running time smiling
beatifically and waxing profound on the importance of love and connection
with the earth.  It's all very well-intentioned, and deadly dull.</P>
<P>     The sad part is that HOLY MAN could have been an effective piece of
satire.  The script by Tom Schulman presents G as a latter-day Howard
Beale or Chance the Gardener unknowingly tapping into some zeitgeist
malaise.  Unfortunately, if you're going to go for NETWORK or BEING
THERE-style stabs at modern media, you need someone a bit more cutting
edge at the helm than Stephen Herek (THE MIGHTY DUCKS, MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS,
101 DALMATIANS), Disney's crowd-pleaser-in-residence.  Herek wraps
everything in a warm-n-fuzzy package guaranteed not to offend, a pointless
perspective for a social satire.  Even the few token pokes at
infomercialism, including cameo pitch-meisters like Morgan Fairchild,
Betty White and Soupy Sales, are too feather-light to amount to much.
Wasting a chance to savage as ripe a target as home shopping should be a
criminal offense.</P>
<P>     It's similarly criminal wasting the presence of Eddie Murphy.  I
understand Murphy's recent move toward kinder, gentler, family-friendly
roles, since there are only so many ways to play the wise-cracking rebel
with the honking laugh.  The problem isn't his performance in HOLY MAN,
which is quite adequate for the minimal work he's actually required to do.
The problem is that no matter how hard Murphy tries to be a "versatile
actor," he's going to be in trouble with audiences if marketing geniuses
keep suckering his fans into watching a Murphy they don't really care to
see.  I'm glad Murphy felt strongly enough about HOLY MAN's message of
integrity to take a chance playing against type, but he could have picked
a less tedious vehicle.  It's even worse when Touchstone makes him look
like a certain Pot referring to a certain Kettle's ebony shading.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 guru'ed awakenings:  4.</PRE>
