<P>   Music hath charms to sooth the savage breast, but not all
bosoms want to be placated.  A recent survey about the
influence of music on the nervous system showed that New
Age spiritual harmonies assuage the spirit best, classical
second, and not surprisingly at the bottom of the list after acid
rock is grunge.  Grunge musicians do not sit primly on stage
in formal attire but stand and gyrate and even sometimes
resort to violence against patrons and one another as they
strum their electric guitars and swat their drums, committed to
driving themselves and their constituents into a frenzy.  Also
not surprisingly, folks who are "into" this sort of discord are
more likely than most to be part of the drug scene as well. 
It's no wonder, then, that Nick Broomfield's documentary
about famed punk rocker Kurt Cobain and his less talented
wife Courtney Love is chock full of interviews with people that
are off-the-wall and, in fact, if you count the principal
characters who appear on Broomfield's camera, you'll come
up with just two down-to-earth people.  One is the unaffected
aunt of Mr. Cobain, the other the filmmaker himself.  And not
every viewer will be convinced of Broomfield's wits.  The
subjects are more likely than not to make frequent use of
expressions like "you know," "like," and "totally" which they
utter between brief periods of nodding out.  The musicians
tend to be awfully thin (Cobain weighed only 120 pounds) and
their followers are apt to wear rings on their pierced skin.</P>
<P>   Kurt and Courtney is not a musicography: in fact,
unfortunately, Broomfield displays painfully little of the music,
in one case cutting away just as the musicians at one concert
were getting started kicking audience butt.  Had he spent
more time on the rhythms, we may have acquired more
insight into the nature of the beast.  But controversial rocker
Courtney Love, whom even straight audiences may have
seen for her vivid role in a movie about pornography king
Larry Flynt, threatened to sue if Broomfield made
unauthorized use of copyrighted music.  Ms. Love was merely
trying to stall the movie's opening, no doubt aware that all the
documentarian needed to do was expunge the melodies and
go on with his real agenda.  Why was Love so intent on
stopping the film?  With good reason.  Often playing like a
living supermarket tabloid, "Kurt and Courtney" toys with the
theory that Ms. Love ordered the murder of her husband, Kurt
Cobain, who was found dead in April 1994 amid a plethora of
drug equipment, ostensibly a suicide at the age of 27.</P>
<P>   The film unfolds primarily in Seattle and Portland where
Broomfield--a handsome, articulate interviewer takes us to
some of the title characters' relatives, friends, and
professional people who got caught up in the tawdry tale. 
The least sensational and yet most effective segments of the
ninety-nine minute drama show Cobain in the days before he
became a household word, a little kid who showed an
aptitude for music early on to become later a young adult who
mixed with the heroin and cocaine crowd.  Interviewed after
he became the leading figure of the grunge movement, he
insists that the gobs of money he made from his concerts had
little to do with happiness; that in fact he misses browsing in
second-hand shops, anxiety-ridden about whether he can
afford to buy the things he really liked but once indulging, he
treated his goods like special treasures.  Others confirmed
later that many of the arguments he had with the woman he
married, Courtney Love, were over money; Courtney favored
fancy cars like the Lexus while Cobain was positively
embarrassed to be seen traveling in anything but a van.  Nor
would Cobain be happy to be seen in the sort of mansion
favored by the Mrs.</P>
<P>   The most unusual interview is with Love's father Hank who
insists that he loves his daughter (with "tough love,") has
written two books about her and Cobain, and astonishingly
enough suggests that his daughter indeed had her husband
murdered.  Tom Grant, a private detective who had been
hired by Love to find Cobain when the rock singer was
missing for days likewise speaks against type by suggesting
even more strongly that Cobain was murdered in that there
were no fingerprints on the gun, the police botched the
evidence, and that a man with 1.52 mg of heroin in his
system would not be able to stand up and pull the trigger of a
rifle.  A character who is far-out even by West Coast
standards, El Duce, has a drunken talk with the interviewer
insisting that Love offered him $50,000 to whack her husband
but that he flat-out refused the bid.  (It came out later that this
Duce was paid $100 by Broomfield for the interview.  Duce,
who led a weird band called the Sex Slaves, was later killed
by a train while he was drunk.)</P>
<P>   Some reviewers have already criticized Broomfield for being
biased, contending that he takes for granted the theory that
Love ordered the murder.  The movie, however, shows the
charming interrogator to be fair-minded, to challenge those
like the private detective and the father when they accuse
Love of criminal activity.  But Broomfield is no fan of the
woman, whom he portrays as unstable, consumed by an
insatiable desire for attention, and given to violent threats
such as the one she made on the answering machine of a
hostile biographer, who moved suddenly from Seattle to L.A.
fearing for her life.</P>
<P>   Strange, isn't it, that a druggie like Courtney Love is
honored by the prestigious American Civil Liberties Union for
her stand on free speech in the movie "The People vs. Larry
Flynt" when, in fact, she was merely acting a role with no part
in the writing and when many people question the use of
Larry Flynt as a role model for the First Amendment.</P>
<P>   Though "Kurt & Courtney" cries out for a deeper look at the
demons in Cobain's life--the reasons for his psychosomatic
stomach pains and his suicidal depression--its tabloid-like
albeit fair assessment of Cobain and Love are vastly
entertaining.  Pulled from the Sundance Festival at the 11th
hour, the movie will ironically draw fair-sized audiences are
commercial screening if the crowd attending the opening in
L.A. are an indication. Not Rated.  Running time: 99 minutes.
