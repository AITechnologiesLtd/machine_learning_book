<P>During the whopping two hour and 44 minute running time of "The Patriot," my
mood shifted repeatedly. Early on, I found the oh-so-perfect picture
postcard lighting of every single damn scene so maddening that I leaned to a
friend and growled, "I hate this movie!" Then a juicy battle scene
reinvigorated my fading spirits. Later, I even got a little misty during a
quiet father/son moment. But just as I was ready to surrender to the story's
rah-rah momentum, the filmmakers threw in a series of
hero-charging-forward-waving-the-flag-in-slow-motion images so cheesy that I
wanted to scream, "Run for your lives, they've remade 'The Postman!'"</P>
<P>What else should I have expected from a Revolutionary War epic presented by
the producer and director team responsible for "Stargate," "Independence
Day" and "Godzilla?" Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich are infamous for their
ability to take intriguing premises and turn them into overcooked,
cliché-filled, pop culture goulash. Many people find their concoctions
satisfying, but as for me, pass the Pepto Bismo, please.</P>
<P>To be fair, "The Patriot" is one of their better offerings. The screenplay,
by "Saving Private Ryan" author Robert Rodat, explores the horrifying
concept of having a war fought in your own backyard, while effectively
presenting the differences between the Brits' formal, "gentlemanly" approach
to combat and the American militia's guerrilla tactics.</P>
<P>But Devlin and Emmerich's treatment of the script is remarkably ham-handed.
John William's thunderous score assaults the viewer, as Mel Gibson turns
from a war-wary father into a colonial Rambo. This film isn't about
patriotism, it's about revenge. The ads should read "Gibson's back, and this
time… it's personal! Welcome to 'Death Wish 1776.'"</P>
<P>Mel plays Benjamin Martin, a South Carolina widower determined to stay out
of the uprising against the British and raise his seven children in peace. A
veteran of the French and Indian War, he is haunted by memories of
atrocities committed during battle. But his eldest son, Gabriel (Heath
Ledger), views the hesitancy of his father with disdain and defiantly joins
the rebels.</P>
<P>Months later, the fighting draws near and Gabriel returns home injured.
While caring for him, and other wounded soldiers from both sides, Benjamin
is visited by British troops, led by the sadistic Colonel William Tavington
(Jason Isaacs). In short order, Tavington has his men burn down the Martin
home, arrests Gabriel and orders his execution and then shoots Martin's
second eldest boy. As soon as Tavington leaves, Benjamin arms his children,
rescues Gabriel and becomes leader of the area militia. His reputation as
"The Ghost" grows to the point that British General Cornwallis (Tom
Wilkinson) sends out his troops to capture Benjamin Martin, by any means
necessary.</P>
<P>At times, "The Patriot" delivers on its promises. Subdued conversations
between Benjamin and Gabriel are moving, thanks to the skills of Mel Gibson
and Heath Ledger, a handsome Aussie with talent and charisma reminiscent of
Gibson in his youth. A visit to a black refuge by the sea provides a welcome
respite from the fighting. Best of all is a clever, well-staged
prisoner-exchange negotiation between Martin and Cornwallis.</P>
<P>While a couple of the extremely graphic battle scenes are gripping, most
lack focus, playing out as mere excuses for Director Emmerich to fill the
screen with as much blood and gore as possible (he seems particularly fond
of showing the effect of cannonballs on human extremities).</P>
<P>Many civilian moments are as cloying as the battles are grisly. Every scene
is filled with gorgeous skies, sunbeams streaming through the trees and
other storybook imagery that blunts the sense of realism. Young Anne Howard
(Lisa Brenner) comes off more like a contemporary woman than a colonial lass
as she challenges the men-folk to enter the fray. While delivering her
speech, she exchanges so many coy smiles with Gabriel that her words seem
less like a call-to-arms and more like foreplay.</P>
<P>The single most infuriating scene comes straight out of a teen slasher
flick. A good guy shoots a bad guy, who falls to the earth face down. Our
hero silently approaches and leans over the body when - surprise! - the
villain, apparently possessed of considerable psychic ability, springs
around at precisely the right moment to strike a fatal blow. Who knew that
the great-great-great grandfather of Jason from "Friday the 13th" was
British?</P>
<P>"The Patriot" has its moments, to be sure, and I fully expect it to be one
of the biggest hits of this anemic summer movie season. But the next time
Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich decide to crank out another of their
manipulative popcorn epics, I hope they'll stick to aliens and giant lizards
and leave our history alone.</P>
