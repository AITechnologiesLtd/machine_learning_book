<PRE>SONGCATCHER
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>SONGCATCHER, written and directed by Maggie Greenwald, is a charming film that
could almost be a Hallmark Hall of Fame television movie given its Norman
Rockwell brand of folksy Americana.  Hallmark, however, would probably not be
comfortable with the amount of implicit sex going on and would want to cut short
the songs which fill almost every scene.  The film was a hit at 2000's Sundance
Film Festival.  It's an unusual picture, essentially a musical of folk ballads. 
It may not have much a narrative drive, but it sure can carry a tune.  </P>
<P>The story, set in the early 1900s, concerns a Doctor of Music, Dr. Lily Penleric
(Janet McTeer, TUMBLEWEEDS), who takes a leave from her university when she is
passed over again for a full professorship.  A feminist, she bitterly resents
the sexual discrimination.  Even the married professor with whom she has been
having an affair voted against her.  She's a modern woman with a sophisticated
set of values who believes in sexual freedom among heterosexuals.  Only her
sister's lesbianism troubles her.  Jane Adams (HAPPINESS) plays her sister, Elna
Penleric.  It is to Elna's school high up in the mountains to which Lily goes
for her break.</P>
<P>While in the mountains, Lily makes an incredible discovery for a musicologist
like herself.  She finds that the locals sing a pure version of old English folk
ballads.  She takes it upon herself to write down the songs and to record them
on cylinders.  Resenting "outlanders" like Lily, the mountain folks, especially
Tom Bledsoe (Aidan Quinn), at first are leery of having anything to do with her.
 Tom figures that she is "exploiting" them and "stealing" their music.  Yep, you
guessed it.  The liberal Lily will soon be shedding her clothes for Tom.</P>
<P>The movie is best when it lets the music flow, which is most of the time.  The
songs, both romantic and tragic, are uniformly lovely, regardless of the singing
ability of the person singing them.  Less effective are the moments when the
movie tries to go on message.  In one of these clichéd moments, Ambrose
McFarland (Steve Boles), the wealthy head of the coal company, which is trying
to buy the land for fifty cents an acre, doesn't believe in the importance of
Elna's school.  "Educating these savages is a waste of money," he says.  Later
he offers a huge donation to the school anyway but only as a ruse to get what he
wants.</P>
<P>A movie like this that is built with a collection of little incidents has
trouble ending.  The dramatic incident that Greenwald comes up with is a bit too
easy to foretell and is allowed to occur too easily by those involved.  But the
story has to end somehow, and the way Greenwald chooses is reasonable even if
not especially inspired.  SONGCATCHER leaves you in a state of bliss as the
music floats through your mind like a billowy cloud on a lazy summer day.</P>
<P>SONGCATCHER runs 1:52.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual content and an intense
scene of childbirth and would be acceptable for kids around 11 or 12 and up.</P>
<P>The film is playing in limited release now in the United States.  In the Silicon
Valley, it is showing at the Camera Cinemas.</P>
