<P>Susan Granger's review of "SEA PEOPLE" (Showtime TV Family Movie)</P>
<P> On Sunday night, June 20th, at 9 P.M., Showtime presents this
enchanting, original, made-for-TV movie, starring Fairfield's own Hume
Cronyn as a spry, old codger who's not what he appears to be. 14
year-old Amanda (Tegan Moss) is a bit of a loner who lives with her
family in a small coastal town in Nova Scotia. She trains as a
long-distance swimmer and dreams of swimming the English Channel, like
her heroine Gertrude Ederle. When the town's main source of
employment, the local cannery, closes, her father has to seek work in
a town a hundred miles away. Feeling abandoned and hurt, she suddenly
witnesses an elderly man (Cronyn) jumping off an inlet
bridge. Attempting to save him, she dives into the bitterly cold
water, only to be gruffly brushed off by the wiry man who calmly and
quite competently swims to shore. Introducing himself as John MacRae,
he takes the thoroughly chilled Amanda to his home to warm up and meet
his wife (Joan Gregson). After visiting with the couple, Amanda
becomes convinced that they are not human. They drink seaweed tea, eat
algae, and sleep in giant tanks filled with icy salt water. They even
refer to her and her family as "land people." Could they possibly be
related to the mermaids she's heard about in stories? She even quizzes
a school friend (Shawn Roberts) whose grandfather was supposedly
rescued by a mermaid. As their friendship deepens, the MacRaes reveal
their mysterious and magical relationship to the sea. And when John
becomes ill, Amanda embarks on a quest of desperate ingenuity to save
him. This is an unusually charming fable, a real winner that I highly
recommend for family viewing. It will be repeated on 6/29 at 7:15
P.M., 7/3 at 4:45 P.M., 7/9 at 8 A.M. & 6:15 P.M., 7/19 at 6:15
P.M. and 7/25 at 4:35 P.M.</P>
