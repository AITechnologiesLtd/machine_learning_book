<PRE>                            THE ABYSS: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros
                        Copyright 1994 Michael John Legeros</PRE>
<P>     Still making rounds around town is the director's cut of THE
ABYSS, a definite must-see for action fans and a perfect warm-up to the
July release of TRUE LIES.</P>
<P>     The story presses a team of oil-drilling divers (led by Ed Harris)
into the service of the Navy, who requests their aid to locate and
disarm a missing nuclear sub.  Along for the ride is one ex-wife (Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio), some less-than-playful SEALS (led by Michael
Biehn), and a handful of luminescent, underwater aliens.</P>
<P>     Director James Cameron's undersea adventure received a soggy
reception in 1989, despite grossing somewhere between $50 to $80
million in the States.  Critics couldn't accept the aliens and with good
reason.  The truncated film--cut by 27 minutes per the studio's
request--gave zero explanation for their existence.</P>
<PRE>     Aliens, that is.  Not critics.</PRE>
<P>     Now, with the footage restored, THE ABYSS is finally fathomable.
The ending is still way-too-literal, but Cameron was young when he made
this movie.  (Remember the awful editing in TERMINATOR 2?  The man is
still learning.  Let's talk after TRUE LIES.)</P>
<P>     If nothing else, THE ABYSS is a bonafide technical masterpiece.
The actors spent months underwater and did all of their own diving.
Their efforts helped to win the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.  (The
film was also nominated for best cinematography and best sound.)</P>
<PRE>     Brave THE ABYSS.  You won't see another film like it for some time
to come.</PRE>
<PRE>     It's *that* deep.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: A-</PRE>
