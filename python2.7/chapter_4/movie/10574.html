Casablanca</PRE>
<PRE>A film by Michael Curtiz</PRE>
<P>Starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains</P>
<P>    By now, this movie has transcended even film itself.  I was a late =
bloomer: it was a long time until I saw Casablanca.  Too bad, because =
when it was all said and done, I thought this really was the beginning =
of a beautiful friendship.  If you are one of those extremely rare =
people who have never seen this gorgeously amazing film, go right now =
and rent it.  Then watch it again.  And again.  And again.  It's that =
good. =20
    This, simply, is the best romance Hollywood has ever concocted.  It =
just might be the best picture Hollywood has ever made.  Alright, =
alright, I'm jumping ahead of myself.  Let's start at the beginning.  =
Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is a bar owner in Casablanca, a travel =
town in Morocco during WWII.  It is controlled by the Vichy French =
Government, but Rick is usually given a free hand to do what he pleases. =
 No one knows what fully goes on in Rick's place but Rick himself, as =
visas are sold, bribes are issued, and a whole host of other things go =
on.  It is a normal night, with many many people trying to flee =
Casablanca to America.  The plot centers around one of these people: =
Victor Laszlo, a French Resistance leader.  He and his wife Elsa =
(Bergman) come to Casablanca to seek visas to America. =20
    The catch?  Elsa is an old flame of Rick.  She used to date him, and =
they frequented a bar with a black piano player named Sam (the =
incomparable Dooley Wilson), who came with Rick to set up shop in =
Casablanca.  Elsa dumped Rick on a rainy night in Paris, and Rick's =
heart has been stone-cold ever since.  Rick holds two visas with him =
that could save the lives of the Laszlos, but he waits, for he feels he =
shouldn't give them to Laszlo at any price.  Finally, after the pleas of =
Elsa, Rick concocts a plan to get her out of the country.
    Bogart and Bergman are simply fabulous in their respective roles.  =
Claude Rains playes police captain Louis Renault to absolute perfection. =
 He is marvelously hilarious, sharing some memorable scenes with Bogart, =
especially the final scene.  The direction is subtly perfect by Curtiz, =
and everything comes together marvelously.  Nothing in this film goes =
wrong, and if it does, who cares?  For all the inconsistencies in the =
script (fog in Morocco?  visas that can't be rejected by the Nazis?), =
the lines are so good that they make up for it.  "Play it again, Sam". =
That's what we want most of all.  After all, "a kiss is just a =
kiss....as time goes by".  The script ends up to be marvelous.  This is =
as close to flawless as Hollywood will ever get. =20
    How can you argue with Bogie?  You can't.  Watch Casablanca again.  =
It'll be the start of a beautiful friendship.</P>
