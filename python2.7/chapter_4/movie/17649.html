<PRE>10 Things about `10 Things I Hate about You'
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>1. Anybody who is familiar with some of Shakespeare's work is probably
familiar with Taming of the Shrew.  `10 Things' is a lighthearted
adaptation of the Bard's tale about a younger sister who yearns to go
out but is forbidden unless her craggy and highly opinionated sister
first dates.  In this film, the two siblings are Bianca, a wholesome
girl with a tender smile and Cat, a cute but spiteful witch who
instills fear in a majority of the guys at their high school.</P>
<P>2. This movie begins unpromisingly as we are introduced to the various
high school cliques consisting of white Ziggy Marley fanatics who talk
with Jamaican accents, future ivy-leaguers who seem like grandsons of
Thurston Howell III, and even cowboys who are shown twirling their
lariats.  Satirizing cliques is perfectly fine; however, these are
included as mere sight gags, and the movie seems to have ample
opportunity to reintroduce these cliques into even funnier scenes, but
they just sort of vanish.</P>
<P>3. Even the faculty is no less odd including Guidance Counselor Ms.
Perky, who spends her time writing erotic fiction and Mr. Gordon who is
a black teacher that raps Shakespeare sonnets.  I'm not sure whether
the great Bard would have been more shocked by his raps (which do have
a smoothness to them) or knowing that they made this movie based on one
of his tales.</P>
<P>4. We meet up with Cameron is a likable yet vapid sort of guy who is
taken by Bianca's beauty.  He has to overcome two formidable obstacles.
 One is that she can't go out unless Cat also begins to date.  The
other obstacle is the vain, Chachi-look-alike (from Happy Days) student
that also wants to go out with her.</P>
<P>5. To get Cat to go out, they secure the services of Michael, the
school desperado, who probably has what it takes to tame her. 
Inevitably, he will fall for his prey and she will do the same.  It is
also inevitable that she'll realize that she was the product of a wager
and that there will be 10 minutes of film time while she ponders
intensively before she forgives and forgets.</P>
<P>6. Cat is actually very well-spoken.  In fact, for sophomores in high
school, some of the dialogue is incredibly grown up.  They seemed
extremely savvy about life and love.  Yet, despite their verve, nothing
of any importance really gets said.  How odd.</P>
<P>7. I can't say that I really liked anything about this movie.  However,
I can't really say that I disliked it either since it is about kids in
high school trying to find love, and let's face it…we didn't really
know all that much when we were in high school either.  But here's a
sweet moment that stood out.  Michael, to get Cat's attention, bribes
that school marching band to play while he serenades her over the PA
system.  Nice touch, but everything else was just ho-hum high school
silliness.</P>
<P>8. What was a shame was that some of these kids show real promise, but
it's hard to break out of the gravitational grip of a high school
comedy.  They will eventually graduate to bigger and better things.</P>
<P>9. Thinking about it more, I believe that I just tend to view high
school romance genres with a sort of detachment.  It seems as if so
many have come out recently (Can't Hardly Wait and She's All That, just
to name a few), that it's like watching the same movie over and over
again.  So, it's not that this movie is bad.  It's just that it's too
bad that so many of these films have come out.</P>
<P>10. The lowdown is this.  `10 Things' starts off as silly fare, but
there are some subtly charming moments, and for the most part, it's
relatively painless fluff.</P>
