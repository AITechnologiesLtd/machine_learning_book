Constance Shulman, Frank Welker, Doug Preis, Guy Hadley, Alice Playten. Rated
G.</P>
<P>For years, films made for a younger audience have either targeted
preschoolers or older teens. Barring the occasional transcendent animated
Disney feature, the amount of movies made to appeal to, say, a 12-year old.
Disney tries to change all that with Doug's First Movie, a film treatment of
the popular Saturday morning cartoon. The star of both the show and the movie
is Doug, a shy, timid schoolboy who is trying to win the heart of his
life-long crush Patti Mayonnaise in time for the school dance. He is forced
to compete with a cool, sleazy "upper-classman" named Guy. Incidentally, his
best friend Skeeter Valentine discovers a monster in the polluted Lucky-Duck
lake nearby, and now Doug must decide whether to save the monster, who is
being hunted by the trash-happy mayor and his dustbusters, or go after Patti.</P>
<P>I've always been an affectionate fan of the cartoon (please, don't leave!)
because of the neat way it chronicles how an ordinary kid deals with ordinary
problems in extraordinary ways. One of the problems with Doug's First Movie
is that it actually puts its protagonist in a truly unusual situation. I
never expected Doug to concern itself with a friendly monster, it is almost
abominably against the 'toon's very nature, but here we are.</P>
<P>The concept could have worked if it wasn't such a blatant rip-off of E.T. The
Extra Terrestrial, the classic about a boy who befriends a friendly alien.
This is essentially the same movie, except this one is preachy and not nearly
as touching -- or as cute -- as Steven Spielberg's family masterpiece.</P>
<P>The subplots about Doug's girlfriend-to-be and the evil mayor fare better, as
they are more involving and more akin to the tv show's general themes. While
the monster scenario is targeted at the very young people who will inevitably
see this movie, the other plots are out there for the preteens who should
have the most fun with Doug's First Movie. The film is too bland for the
4-year olds who will be disappointed at the non-flashy, sub-par animation and
the unfamiliar to them get-the-girl sub-plot. But 12-year olds might enjoy
this immensely because they are the group that it speaks to, if any.</P>
<P>Still, there are oodles of toons out there that are far superior to this
dull, unexceptional effort from Disney's animation. Doug's First Movie was
originally slated for straight-to-video release, but got a shot at the
multiplexes after the success of The Rugrats Movie. Unfortunately, on video
is where this belongs, and it would be much more passable as a rental. Unless
you have a 12-year old who is a fan of the show, there is simply no reason to
spend money on a film which is so unimpressive when compared to the string of
stellar animation that we have seen come out of the studios these past few
years.</P>
<P>Doug's First Movie is not as intelligence insulting as Quest for Camelot but
it's not nearly as good as The Rugrats Movie. It doesn't feel like an event
that belongs on the big screen. Also, Doug's First Movie decides to outright
preach (a no-no Rugrats avoided), which is decidedly un-Dougish.</P>
<P>Although I smiled and even chuckled at some of the jokes in this picture
(especially a VR gag that's "just like being in this living room... only much
more expensive), this does not amuse an adult; it may even torture a few. My
advice is to see this film only in case of extenuating circumstances.
Otherwise, wait for it to show up on those trusty video shelves.</P>
