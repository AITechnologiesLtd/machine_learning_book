<P>"Cop Land" is a film about weight. The weight of defeat, of broken dreams,
 of corruption, conscience and culpability. As Sheriff Freddy Heflin, 
Sylvester Stallone trudges through life. A heroic act as a young man cost 
him his hearing in one ear. The partial hearing loss cost him his dream 
of becoming a New York City Police officer.  And the loss of his dream 
cost him everything. So Freddy trudges through life, 40 pounds overweight,
 with a sad smile, a lazy gait and a don't make waves attitude. Heflin is 
Sheriff of Garrison, New Jersey, a small town just across the river from 
NYC. Garrison's population is comprised largely of New York cops who have 
made the town their refuge, an oasis from the madness of the big city. 
They treat Heflin with benign condescension, as nothing more than a slow-
witted figurehead. And Heflin accepts the role; if he can't be a "real" 
cop, at least he can hang out with them. 
So life goes on, with Heflin deferring to the lawbreaking and casual 
bullying of his "superiors", until an incident in NYC changes it all. 
Late one night, Murray Babitch (Michael Rappaport) is side-swiped on the 
George Washington bridge by a pair of joy-riders. When he pursues them, 
one of the men leans out the window and taunts Babitch while aiming 
something at him. Babitch panics and fires on them, resulting in a car 
wreck and two dead young men. Within minutes, the bridge is swarming with 
people, and the only object found near the men's bodies is "The Club". 
Police cronies plant a gun, but an alert paramedic notices the scam and 
raises loud objections. Amidst the chaos, Babitch's uncle, Senior officer 
Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel) spirits his nephew away, claiming that the 
young cop committed suicide by jumping from the bridge.</P>
<P>Babitch is given a lavish police funeral, while Uncle Ray keeps the youth 
tucked away in his Garrison home, so convinced of the sanctity of the 
town that he holds a barbecue at the house, with the youth wandering 
about freely drinking and socializing. Sheriff Heflin knows about the 
brazen farce. Internal Affairs investigator Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) 
suspects. But the cops in Garrison have many powerful friends.</P>
<P>The investigation of the incident allows "Cop Land" to spin off into a 
wide variety of sub-plots and character studies. The film meanders, the 
multiple stories become confusing, and the inevitable show-down is overly 
simplistic and more than a bit illogical, but Cop Land works anyway, 
because of writer/director James Mangold's steady, assured pacing, 
excellent cinematography and the strong performances of the powerhouse 
cast. </P>
<P>Stallone sheds his Nautilus image for the film, reminding us that he 
began his career as an actor, not an icon. His Sheriff Heflin is a 
fascinating character, an utterly defeated man with a spark of his former 
self still burning somewhere inside. Stallone's nuanced performance is 
good,  hopefully a harbinger of a new direction for his career. Keitel is 
excellent as the leader of the Garrison cops, a viper of a man whose 
smile is nearly as threatening as his scowl. De Niro does his usual fine 
work, as do Robert Patrick, Cathy Moriarty, Annabella Sciorra and Peter 
Berg in supporting roles. The wonderful Janeane Garofalo, who seems 
incapable of making a bad career move, has a nice turn in a cameo as one 
of Sheriff Heflin's deputies. </P>
<P>The actor who makes the biggest splash in "Cop Land", however, is Ray 
Liotta. After a long series of simplistic bad guy roles, Liotta finally 
has a part with some meat to it, and he is outstanding. His Officer Gary 
Figgis was once a member of the Garrison cop's inner circle, but became 
estranged from the group following the murder of his partner, who had 
planned to testify against the officers. Figgis is a bloated mess of a 
man, a cokehead drowning in anger and self-pity, but his conscience has 
survived and he becomes an uneasy ally of Sheriff Heflin. </P>
<P>Beyond the dynamic acting, "Cop Land" offers several impressive set 
pieces. One of the best involves a violent confrontation, viewed through 
Stallone's hearing-impaired character. The combination of near-silence 
and high-voltage action is disconcerting and mesmerizing, adding a 
surreal element to the film at just the right moment.</P>
<P>The structural and logical flaws of "Cop Land" are easy to forgive, given 
the strong acting, pacing and framing of the film. Writer/director 
Mangold has constructed a worthy tale of despair and redemption that 
overflows with memorable images. "Cop Land" isn't a great film, but it is 
a very good one. </P>
