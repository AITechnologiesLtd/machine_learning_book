<PRE>                              BLOOD AND WINE
                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>'Blood and Wine' has all the makings of classic 'film noir'.  It has two
legendary leading actors, a fortune, a beautiful woman and complications
arising from a robbery gone wrong.  Add that against the steamy backdrop of
beautiful Miami, photographed at times with obtusely graphic violence,
gorgeous sunsets and darkly inventive human conflict and you couldn't ask for
anything more.  </P>
<P>Jack Nicholson stars as a wine proprietor servicing a large sector of wealthy
Miami and its suburbs.  His wife (Judy Davis) is a character most ordinary;
lacking the strength of will but soon finds what she needs to survive.  Her
son and Nicholson's stepson (Stephen Dorff) earns his living as a fisherman
striving for more in life.  Nicholson becomes embroiled in mistrust and
suspicion with a crafty and sleazy jewel thief (Michael Caine) after the two
of them steal a million dollar necklace from the home of one of Nicholson's
clients.  They are aided in their crime by the beautiful Jennifer Lopez who
plays the nanny of the wealthy couple's child.  A heated argument which turns
violent one evening between two of the film's character's (I'm not saying
which ones) leads to a loss of the valuable necklace and vile determination
to reclaim it involving all the film's main characters.</P>
<P>Director Bob Rafelson ('Five Easy Pieces', 'The King of Marvin Gardens', '
The Postman Always Rings Twice', 'Man Trouble'), all of which star Nicholson,
has made a stark, gritty and hardboiled film mixing elements of suspense,
violence and sex all in good taste with unpredictable results. It's a film
embodied with style striving for originality and while it doesn't quite find
it at times and doesn't always hit the mark, it still has the
characrteristics of emotional drama and the ingredients to sustain a perfect
running time of 97 minutes.  It's not an ambitious film, just an odyssey of
clever film making and it knows its limits.  It's not too long and not too
short.  It's just perfect.</P>
<P>Nicholson and Caine are perfectly casted as two criminal adversaries out to
get rich quick and despite the cliche that 'crime doesn't pay', the movie
strives to enforce the unwritten rule that there is no honour among thieves.
 Stephen Dorff is effectively on target as the man caught in the middle and
plays his role with poetic ease with moments of heightened tension and this
could be a very important breakthrough film for him in his young career.
Dorff was most impressive as the little known real life character Stu
Sutcliffe who almost made it as a member of The Beatles in 1994's 'Backbeat'.
 He is one of Hollywood's rising stars.  Watch for him.  Davis gives a good
performance as Nicholson's wife, a woman with integrity and Jennifer Lopez is
interesting to watch as the 'other woman'.  She will soon be seen in a
biography of Mexican singing sensation Selena.  It's the story of the rising
rock star gunned down by her fan club manager.  </P>
<P>'Blood and Wine' is not playing in wide release but if you are lucky enough
to be living in a location featuring it, check it out.  It's a must see for
fans of Jack Nicholson and fans of 'film noir'.</P>
