<PRE>JOINT VENTURE</PRE>
<PRE>SAVING GRACE</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Nigel Cole</PRE>
<P>Screenplay by Craig Ferguson & Mark Crowdy
With Brenda Blethyn, Craig Ferguson</P>
<PRE>(Theater)     R     93 min.</PRE>
<P>     There's an inexhaustible mine of humor to be found in the oddball 
characters of small-town Britain when the material is handled right, and 
director Nigel Cole does just that with this virtuously naughty tale of 
good folks and contraband horticulture.</P>
<P>     Grace Trevathan (Brenda Blethyn of Little Voice and Secrets & Lies) 
has no more than buried her husband when she finds out the bastard 
checked out with a mountain of debt that is now hers.  Pretty soon 
they're carting out the furniture, and she's about to lose the grand 
house in Cornwall where until now she's lived without a care in the 
world, tending her prize-winning garden.</P>
<P>     A way out turns up in the form of a sickly marijuana plant.  Her 
gardener (Craig Ferguson of TV's The Drew Carey Show, who co-wrote and 
coproduced) asks her advice on restoring his ailing cash crop to health. 
 Pretty soon they've got a greenhouse full of the stuff, grown 
hydroponically and thriving (the filmmakers got government sanction to 
use real marijuana, but no plants were harmed in the making of this 
movie.)  The next step is to get a dealer, and Grace travels to London 
to find one.  Protected by her impenetrable combination of pluckiness 
and naivete, not to mention a stunning white leisure suit, she beards 
the den of the enjoyably sleazy Jacques (Tcheky Karyo of Patriot), wins 
him over, and..</P>
<P>     To make a long story short, she lives happily ever after.  Of 
course, certain concessions to popular morality have to be made, but 
that's no problem for these folks.  Blethyn is a wonderful actress who 
hits every note with perfect pitch, Ferguson adds an appealing Scots 
scruffiness, and the supporting cast is filled with crafty pros who know 
just how to take this well-worn material and make you grin at it all 
over again.  Beautifully photographed Cornwall adds to the enjoyment.</P>
<P>     Saving Grace is in the tradition of movies like The Full Monty  and 
Saving Ned Devine, and the old Ealing Studio classics like Tight Little 
Island, and while it doesn't take that tradition to any new levels, it 
doesn't let it down.</P>
