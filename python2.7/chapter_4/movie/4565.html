<PRE>                                 CLERKS
                       A film review by Sue Roberts
                        Copyright 1996 Sue Roberts</PRE>
<P>Directed by Kevin Smith.
Starring Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Mary Ghigliotti.</P>
<P>Wicked, amusing and possibly the most outrageous thing you will hear
in a long time.</P>
<P>It opens a door on the life of  Dante and shows a hell of a day. The 
boss has gone to Connecticut and the poor guy finds it anything but 
convenient that he's been left him to mind the shop. </P>
<P>The customers are a truly bizarre assortment of folk. However its not 
hard for him to appear competent compared to Randal from the store next 
door!</P>
<P>A hockey game was planned, but things don't turn out the way he 
intended.The funeral was unexpected, and when a lady from the past turns 
up, it causes him to ask where his life is headed!.</P>
<P>Like all good comedy it leans on the boundaries of taste, but has a ring
of truth underlying some of the jokes. The conversation stretches over 
life, the universe and everything. Is it any wonder with this assortment 
of characters dropping in? </P>
<P>Orson Welles made "F for Fake" about how the camera can be used 
to confuse the viewer's perception of what is fact, or fabrication, in 
art and in life. But Smith goes further down the road towards Ken 
Loach's "Raining Stones" in his choice of social realism for a backdrop. 
The grain of the black and white filmstock gives this film the ambience 
of a documentary and I think it is the presentation of fiction in this  
format which makes "Clerks" astonishingly powerful. </P>
<P>He puts his finger neatly on the sense of women that education is 
something to be fought for, but asks some impertinent questions about 
whether they are using their freedom without responsibility. Maybe the 
hockey players are not alone in taking their eye off the ball.</P>
<P>Perhaps most astonishing is the representation of young men with little 
conception of how, or where, they might engage with society.</P>
<P>Such a satire, that dénouement. The mere suggestion that a dealer could 
have more commitment to his work than a bona fide employee, and more 
awareness of what is relevant in life, points to some glaring holes in 
what this world seems to offer the next generation.</P>
<PRE>Funny and darned clever.</PRE>
