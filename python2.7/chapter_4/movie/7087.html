<PRE>                             GRACE OF MY HEART
                       A film review by Vince Deehan
                        Copyright 1997 Vince Deehan</PRE>
<P>Written and Directed by Allison Anders.  Cast : Illeana Douglas,  John
Turturro, Matt Dillon, Eric Stoltz, Bruce Davison, Patsy Kensit and
Jennifer Leigh Warren.</P>
<P>I had never seen an Allison Anders film before seeing GRACE OF MY
HEART.  I was aware that she had an acclaimed film called GAS, FOOD,
LODGING which I am now eager to see but my only exposure to her work was
her contribution to FOUR ROOMS. Anders herself has said that she is
not pleased with her segment of that film and all I'll say is I'm glad that
with GRACE OF MY HEART she has laid that travesty to rest and produced a 
wonderful film.  Although it has not been commercially successful in the US, 
I hope it will find its audience as people spread the word about it.</P>
<P>The film tells the story of Edna Buxton who is an heiress to the Buxton Steel
family in Philadelphia.  Edna wins a local talent contest which gives her a 
recording contract which unfortunately fails to come to any fruition.  She 
writes her own songs and intends to record them herself.  She is told early 
in the film that you can be either a singer or a writer , but not both.  The 
age of the singer-songwriter is yet to come.  She eventually manages to get 
her songs recorded, but by other artists, when she hooks up with Joel Millner 
(John Turturro) who works in a building called the Brill Building in New York. 
The Brill Building was full of songwriters who turned out many hits during 
the 60's.  Initially Edna is told that her songs will be recorded by male 
vocal groups but eventually she manages to convince Joel to let a girl group 
she knows, record one of her songs.  </P>
<P>Joel manages to get Edna to agree to change her professional name to Denise 
Waverley and creates a new , more audience-friendly, working class background
for her.  Denise's songs become hits and she hooks up with another writer who
seems to want to write similar songs to her - romantic songs that use realism
and gritty social issues.  One of the songs they write is about a 12 year 
old girl who gets pregnant by her 14 year old boyfriend. Needless to say some
of these songs get banned. The rest of the film shows how Denise tries to 
launch her own solo career and marries a Brian Wilson-type figure, the tortured 
musical genius Jay Phillips (Matt Dillon) .</P>
<P>We hear many of Denise's songs throughout the film and all of them are
wonderful.  Illeanna Douglas mimes to the songs but she does it very well
and almost acts out the songs as she mouths the words.  The best song in the 
film is "God Give Me Strength" which is the song that Denise tries to 
launch her solo career with   At this point in the film she has joined up with 
Jay Phillips who gives her great song a wonderfully lush orchestration.  In 
the film, the song fails to become a hit and financially cripples Denise's 
publisher/manager Joel Millner.  To my ears this song is just terrific. It 
came as no surprise to see that it was written by the legendary Burt Bacharach 
and the brilliant Elvis Costello.  Elvis Costello sings his own version of this
song over the end credits and it is just as beautiful as when Illeanna
Douglas' character is singing it. At this point it is important to point out
that the person responsible for Denise's great singing voice is Kristen 
Vigard. She has a fantastic voice. </P>
<P>The other song which really stood out was the song which Denise records for
her first album. This song is called "A Boat On The Sea" and was written by
Larry Klein (who was responsible for the soundtrack) and the great David
Baerwald (formerly of David and David. Remember them ?). The singer-songwriter
Shawn Colvin also appears very briefly singing a great song called 
"Between Two Worlds", written by Gerry Goffin, Louise Goffin and David 
Baerwald. Gerry Goffin was married to Carole King who Denise's character 
has been said to have been based on. </P>
<P>Illeanna Douglas gives a captivating performance as Denise and carries
the audience along with her throughout the film with a warm and very
charming performance.  John Turturro is as great as ever as the wig
wearing music publisher.  Eric Stoltz is always a joy to watch on screen 
and his appearance as a socially conscious songwriter is very enjoyable.
Matt Dillon does very well with his portrayal of the paranoid and mentally
unstable musical genius , Jay Phillips; his final scenes in the film are
very powerful and moving.</P>
<P>The biggest star of the film though, are the terrific songs which were 
so enjoyable that I can't wait to get my hands on the soundtrack.  Allison 
Anders has created a terrific film which shows the workings of the music 
business in the 60's and is full of the joy and passions of the people 
behind the songs.</P>
