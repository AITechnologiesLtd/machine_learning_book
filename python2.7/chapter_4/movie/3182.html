<P>     With its goofy premise, charming stars, and inoffensive humor,
I.Q. is likely to delight those who frequent movie theaters in search
of romantic comedies.  Anyone who wants a little more from a film won't
find it here, however.  I.Q. is inappropriately titled--cute and
lighthearted it may be, but it definitely isn't clever or intelligent.</P>
<P>     The storyline--which features Walter Matthau's Einstein playing
cupid to two mismatched younger people (Meg Ryan as Albert's brainy
niece and Tim Robbins as an auto mechanic)--is best when relegated to
the background.  Through the first hour, I.Q. is pleasant, carried by
the chemistry of its leads.  Ryan, with her wide-eyed gaze and
characteristic head tilt, and Robbins, with his Jimmy Stewart-like,
low-key style, work well together.  It's only in the movie's final
third, when an increasingly absurd and disjointed plot surfaces, that
the screen presence of the pair is no longer sufficient.</P>
<P>     Matthau is okay as Einstein, fitting most people's preconception
of a doddering genius.  Joining Albert are three other well-known
elderly personalities: Godel (Lou Jacobi), Liebknecht (Joe Maher), and
Podolsky (Gene Saks).  Altogether, these intellectual giants act much
like the Four Stooges, and are responsible for a fair share of I.Q.'s
comedy.</P>
<P>     The film starts out with Ryan's Catherine Boyd engaged to the
snobbish and fun-hating James Morland (Stephen Fry, of PETER'S FRIENDS
and TV's "Jeeves and Wooster" and "Blackadder").  Enter Ed Walters
(Robbins), who knows all about distributor caps, but little about
quantum mechanics or higher mathematics.  Once Catherine and Ed
exchange glances and trade tongue-tied sentences, we know poor James is
on his way out.  Fortunately, Fry plays his charge as such a stuffed
shirt that we don't care.</P>
<P>     Einstein decides that the only way for Ed to win Catherine is to
act like a lot smarter than he is.  This leads to the film's funniest
lowbrow scene--a multiple choice intelligence test with the four old
men finding a way for Ed to cheat--but it also devolves proceedings to
a sit-com level.</P>
<P>     Technical inaccuracies and anachronisms abound, some of which are
a little too obvious to miss.  How much these annoy the individual
viewer will likely depend on how spellbound he or she is by the film's
dubious web of magical romance.</P>
<P>     Towards the end of the film, Einstein advises Catherine, "Keep
your sense of wonder" and "Don't let your brain interfere with your
heart."  Those, apparently, are mottoes director Fred Schepisi hopes his
audience will bear in mind when watching I.Q.  The reason is obvious:
thinking is not the way to get the most out of this uneven picture.</P>
