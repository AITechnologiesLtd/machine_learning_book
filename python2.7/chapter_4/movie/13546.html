Hickman, Laura Hope Crews</P>
<P>I've been reading a lot of reviews of the most recent re-release of "Gone
With the Wind," the epic Civil War soap opera we've almost no doubt been
brought up on by our parents, and I'm actually shocked to find that the
words "Gone With the Wind" and "overrated" are used in the same sentence. 
What do I have to say to this: shame on you.  "Gone With the Wind" is not
great primarily because it's a classic, or because it merely portrays a
civlization that is gradually dying.  It's great for many of the same
reasons some people complain about: it's too long, it's story's a little
dated, and it's melodramatic.  And I personally wouldn't have it any other
way.</P>
<P>"Gone With the Wind" is the great sentimental view of the South during and
following the Civil War, depicting the gradual death of slavery,
plantations, and the introduction to segregation and intense capitolism,
all seen through the eyes of the film's famous (or infamous) protagonist,
Scarlett O'Hara.  Played by then-newcomer Vivien Leigh, Scarlett's the
classic Souther Belle: selfish, manipulative, egotistical, lovable.  We
first meet her when she's young, still living on her family's giant
plantation of Tara, the symbol of Southern Pride and the place that will go
through radical changes as the story progresses.</P>
<P>As the Civil War comes and goes, we don't see battles or carnage, but we
see everything from the perpective of Scarlett, who has fallen in love with
the suave but shallow Ashely Wilkes (Leslie Howard), a neighbor of hers who
has unfortunately fallen in love and proposed to his fragile cousin,
Melanie (Olivia De Havilland).  While Scarlett plots and plots to steal
Ashely from Melanie, mostly by befriending her and doing it that way, she
discovers someone else who has affections for her: Rhett Butler (Clark
Gable), the blunt, obnoxious, and intelligent lady killer who makes one of
the most interesting first impressions on Scarlett towards the beginning,
staring at her as she walks up the stairs at a party ("He looks as if he
knows what I look like without my shimmy," she remarks to a friend).</P>
<P>As the film progresses, Scarlett will loose everything, including a couple
husbands she marries not out of love but out of revenge and financial
desperation (in that order), and as the Civil War ends and the North claims
the South for its own, we see a battle between Scarlett's obsession with
Ashley and her unrequited love for Rhett, the former who loves her in that
nice way, the latter who simply adores her ("What a woman," he says once). 
Since the film runs about four hours or so (with an intermission, of
course), a lot happens, and instead of the film ending when Scarlett
realizes after she has lost everything that she "will never be hungry
again," the film keeps on going, mostly because this film is not about
Scarlett coming to the realization that she is an independent woman, but
has to come right back to the beginning of the film again.  Through four
hours of film, everything and nothing has happened.</P>
<P>For the fans of this film, this plot summary will probably be a refreshment
of the fun of just watching the events of the film unfold, which perhaps
may result in going to see the most recent reissue of this film, a ten
million dollar re-enhancement by Ted Turner that is currenly playing in
theaters (a weird experience, simply because the aspect ratio is that of a
TV - just one of the many older films that I wish had been filmed in
widescreen, if it had been around back then).  For those of you who've
never seen it before, this may be a good reason to actually go see it for
your first time.  Why?  Because of the two reasons many people give for
liking this film: because it's a classic and it's a masterpiece.  Two
reasons to see any film.</P>
<P>I don't consider every old film to be a classic or a masterpiece, mainly
because they are two completely different things and not every film made in
the past is one of them, let alone both.  "Gone With the Wind" is, though. 
It's a classic because it's not dated at all; it has effortlessly stood the
test of time.  We watch films like "Forbidden Planet," a great film that is
horrifically dated, not because the special effects have been improved, but
because of the hokey stench that it wreaks of.  "Gone With the Wind" has
none of that.  There are no unintentional jokes in this film.  Many of the
laughs in this film (and there are many, believe me) are laughs that we
could share with the audience of 1939, who saw this for the first time. 
Not to mention that Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable have lost none of their
appeal: she's still a babe, and he's still the man.  Watching them interact
is still one of the most engaging and wonderful cinematic experiences of
all time (their banter is killer).  "Gone With the Wind" is one of the few
films that has lost none of its power to entertain in its 60 or so years of
being in existence, and that's why it's a classic.</P>
<P>Why it's a masterpiece is a little more complicated.  But I can sum that up
in just a few words: becuase it tells a great story and it tells it well. 
There's not one chief character in this film who is not likable and who is
not seen in their full dimension.  Scarlett, even though she's a
manipulative bitch, is a lovable manipulative bitch who we root for and
againt without even thinking about it.  We all want her to get with
Ashley...and we don't because we don't want to see Melanie hurt.  And don't
tell me that you're not both saddened and satisfied by the film's final
scene, where Rhett answers her question of "What am I going to do?" with a
hilarious and sarcastically cold, "Frankly, dear, I don't give a damn." 
She got what she deserved and we're happy she did, but we also feel
something for her in that ending, some kind of pathos.  It's damn near
cathartic.</P>
<P>Scarlett could be seen as the sole tragic character in the story if most of
the main characters weren't tragic as well.  Rhett Butler is a man who has
everything he could possible have except the love of the woman he loves,
which ultimately destroys him and leaves him more cynical than in the
beginning.  Melanie is one of the saddest: a woman who is nice through
everything and becomes one of the main reasons for Scarlett's sadness in
the end.  And Ashely is the inept fool of the film, never realizing his
true importance and winding up losing the one woman he loves.  The sole
voice of reason in the film is Mammy (Hattie McDaniel, who won an Oscar for
her performance), the African American nanny to Scarlett, who is faithful
to her owners even after the War, and who lends pragmatic advice throughout
the film ("It ain't fittin', it ain't fittin', it ain't fittin'!").</P>
<P>And who can deny the scope this film places on its story?  We actually see
the passage of time contrasted in the story of the characters.  We see the
Old South die and be reborn, only differently, as we see Scarlett die and
be reborn, only differently.  We see Atlanta thriving as a busy city, then
burned down, and then rebuilt.  This film knows what happened during this
time, and it effortlessly portrays an accurate history lesson while telling
a delightfully absorbing melodramatic story about characters we like.</P>
<P>But none of these reasons are really why "Gone With the Wind" is such a
great film, and so worthy of being placed on the same list of great films
of all time as "Citizen Kane" and "Lawrence of Arabia."  The real reason is
because it never bullshits us about its story.  It just tells it, and never
denies us anything that we should know.  The film is about four hours long
because it has a long story to tell, and to leave out anything would result
in a lesser film.  This film is great because it has a great story to tell.
 Becuase it has amazing acting.  Because Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are
the perfect mis-matched couple of all time.  Because it has a killer
script.  Because Victor Fleming (and all the other guest directors, like
George Cukor) knows how to set up shots perfectly (my favorite is still the
pull back to show Tara at sundown in the beginning - orgasmic).  Because
it's a bit dated.  And because for four hours you can see one of the very
few times when Hollywood just got a film right, and wasn't afraid of a
lengthy running time or cost.  I really don't want to compare "Titanic" to
this, because it's just not going to be as great as this film for at least
another 30 or 40 years, but when Hollywood really pulls out the stops and
is concerned with everything at the same time, including the story, that's
when a great film emerges.  And "Gone With the Wind," for all its 222
minutes of running time and seeping soap opera structure, is one of the
greatest films of all time.  That's inarguable.</P>
