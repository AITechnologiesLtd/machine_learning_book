It's getting better.)</P>
<P>Morgan Freeman teamed with Brad Pitt in the best movie of 1995, David
Fincher's neo-noir Se7en. (I can't believe I just used a bullshit term
like "neo-noir".) Just two years later, America's Best Actor is
headlining another serial killer chiller thriller, but in Kiss The
Girls, he takes an unfortunate step backwards from shock to schlock.</P>
<P>Freeman stars as Alex Cross, a forensic psychologist who points out,
presumably for police terminology-challenged audience members, that
his job is to figure out "the how's and why's." When his niece is
kidnapped in North Carolina's Research Triangle by a deranged killer
who calls himself Casanova, Cross assists the small-town homicide
detectives in tracking down the murderer's whereabouts. Assisting
Cross is Kate, the woman who got away (Judd), a doctor who, like each
of the victims, is young and gorgeous, but not as weak.</P>
<P>By the third scene, the screenplay isn't working: why, exactly, did
the filmmakers choose to have Cross travel from Washington to North
Carolina instead of setting the case in his hometown, since the shift
in location does little to slow down his investigation? More
ridiculous contrivances abound. At one point, Cross believes he has
discovered the killer's identity, and he decides to tail him for an
evening. All evidence then has it that this is their guy. So, they
stake out his home, armed with guns. Who does? A S.W.A.T. team,
perhaps? No, just Cross and two police officers, with the perky Kate
waiting in the car. Casanova is one of the most wanted men in America;
the F.B.I. have been trying to capture him for months, yet it never
occurs to Cross and company to call for back-up. The outcome is both
tragic and idiotic.</P>
<P>Most unbelievably is that the hick cops (no pun intended) and the
F.B.I. are always waiting for the next body to show up. Why? Because
the dead women always appear in the same place, a nice little Miller's
Crossing-y section of a forest. So why aren't any of them patrolling
this area instead of twiddling their thumbs? Worse, they can't find
Casanova's hideout; how many dungeons can there be in these woodlands?</P>
<P>The characters are as lazily conceived as the plot. Can we please have
a moratorium on will-they-or-won't-they black man-white woman
relationships, a la The Pelican Brief? Had this film featured Harrison
Ford in the role of Cross, you can bet your eight-fifty he'd have
bedded Kate by the end of act two. Cross, we assume, is intelligent,
authoritative and wise, but only because Morgan Freeman is playing
him. Ashley Judd, an agreeable screen presence, unfortunately lacks
Freeman's worldliness, so Kate remains a nice but bland girl-next-door
type who goes kickboxing after work.</P>
<P>Director Fleder made the little seen but delightful Things To Do In
Denver When You're Dead. Kiss The Girls does shine at times, too:
Freeman's first scene, in which he talks a suicidal woman out of
shooting herself, is a great way to introduce his character. And the
opening credit sequence is outstanding (though it continues a
dispiriting trend, a la Mimic, of having opening titles more involving
and inventive than any scenes in the film that follows them). Fleder
has some visual flair, but so what? Kiss The Girls is littered with
overblown, over-directed scenes, too many supporting characters, too
many plot holes... Denver was pretty well written: witty, sad and
scary. It's clear that Fleder is a craftsman, only as strong as his
script.</P>
<P>Ah, but Morgan Freeman... why he would be attracted to this material,
especially so soon after appearing in the defining masterpiece of the
genre, is curious. But he does more than just make Kiss The Girls
watchable whenever he's on screen; he makes it compelling, and he
deserves better.</P>
