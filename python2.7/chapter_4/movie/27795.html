Woodbine, David Kaye, Kevin Pollack and Howie Long. Written by Richard
Recco and Demian Lichtenstein. Directed by Lichtenstein. Rated R.</P>
<P> The reaction to watching 3000 Miles to Graceland is probably akin to
attending one of those Elvis nostalgia shows, but with the guy who does
the older, fatter Elvis.</P>
<P> You enjoy the show, but are embarrassed and feel foolish about it.</P>
<P> The same emotions tend to rear up during this outlandish crime caper.</P>
<P> 3000 Miles to Graceland is, like Elvis, chintzy retro. It is
ultra-violent and bloody, but in such a cartoonish manner that you can
neither take it seriously nor really be offended.</P>
<P> This foray into foolishness is so outrageous, so near camp that all you
can do is sit back and go along for the ride when, at times, all you
wish you could do is ìReturn to Sender.î</P>
<P> You watch this movie with disbelief at times, jaws agape at how
preposterous and excessive this entire venture can be.</P>
<P> In a nutshell, the story revolves around a quintet of ex-cons who,
during an Elvis impersonation convention at a Vegas hotel, dress up as
The King to knock over the joint.</P>
<P> The robbery isn't the filmís main focus, though, except that it is kind
of kinky seeing Kevin Costner, Kurt Russell, Christian Slater, David
Arquette and Bokeem Woodbine all decked out in their best
rhinestone-studded Elvis paraphernalia.</P>
<P> No, it is the post-robbery double dealings that occupy most of the
filmís approximate 2 hours and 10 minutes.</P>
<P> What we get is a combination chase, road movie and love story, all
courtesy of screenwriters Richard Recco and Demian Lichtenstein, the
latter also serving as director ó or ringmaster, depending on your
outlook.</P>
<P> The bulk of the movie follows the cat-and-mouse game between Russellís
Michael and Costnerís Murphy for possession of the $3.2 million Vegas
loot.</P>
<P> Along for the ride is con woman Cybil (Courtney Cox) and her precocious
10-year-old son, Jesse (David Kaye).</P>
<P> The body count is mega-high, and that is disturbing, especially in this
post-Columbine climate in which officials are breathing down Hollywoodís
neck to tone down cinematic violence.</P>
<P> It is like the filmmakers are thumbing their noses at the
establishment. But, of course, being Hollywood, the filmís creators try
to have it both ways by putting together an end-title sequence that
seems to say, ìHey, folks, don't get all riled up, we're only kidding
around and having some fun here.î</P>
<P> One of the filmís weak points is Costnerís performance. The man cannot
be taken seriously as a badass ex-con. No matter how hard he tries, or
how many people he kills, he retains that Kevin Costner, all-American
good guy image. He even curses like a wuss.</P>
<P> Russell fares better as the ex-con with a conscious. You can tell heís
the movieís good guy because heís the only one who doesnít mow down a
dozen cops or gamblers during the heist sequence.</P>
<P> This is a movie in which the performances are really secondary to the
overall ambiance of the film. Director Lichtenstein uses hyper-drive
camera movements and lots of fancy angles to disguise the fact that what
he has created is merely a ferocious crime drama.</P>
<P> 3000 Miles to Graceland is a movie you may find entertaining, then
question your reaction afterwards.</P>
<P> It is a savage, destructive outing with a modicum of wit, some style
and many disturbing images.</P>
<P> However, you have to appreciate Lichtenstein and his crew for doing
things their way.</P>
