<PRE>                          THE BALLAD OF RAMBLIN' JACK
                        A film review by Jeremiah Kipp

<P>One of the biggest surprises at the Sundance Film Festival was debut
filmmaker Aiyana Elliott's documentary portrait of her cantankerous folk
singer dad, The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack. It was curious to see how well
the audience responded to this deeply personal, lyrical film of lonesome
highways and tough talking cowboys.</P>
<P>Aiyana Elliott previously made an impression on the festival circuit
with her ferocious short, Tough, which offered a strong visual
sensibility influenced by the washed out look of the golden era of '70s
filmmaking. She knew how to truthfully portray a modern dysfunctional
family, with naturalistic performances and startlingly honest dialogue,
a unit whose means of communication is handled through shouting. It's
not surprising to see that these themes continue in her current feature.</P>
<P>If Ms. Elliott's documentary fares less well, it's perhaps because her
instincts are stronger as a narrative filmmaker with control over the
subject matter and, perhaps, autobiographical implications. The fact is,
her dad doesn't really like to talk about herself. He flagrantly shows
his lack of connection and wary affection. At nearly two hours, the film
is too long, and Jack Elliott rambles and evades to the point where we
genuinely "get it" after an hour or so. From then on, The Ballad of
Ramblin' Jack seems redundant.</P>
<P>Aiyana Elliott makes herself a character in the film, along for the ride
during a Midwest tour and chronicling her daddy's life on the way.
Ramblin' Jack was a big folk singer I'd never heard of. Bob Dylan was
his pupil, and he was apparently a huge influence on the Rolling Stones,
Dylan and other rock/folk performers.  Kris Kristofferson and Arlo
Guthrie are among the celebrities waxing philosophical about Ramblin'
jack, usually saying that they never saw someone speak so well about
absolutely worthless horseshit.</P>
<P>There's a personal history unfolding, breaking through the '50s into the
beatnik era and the swinging '60s, to the trippy '70s style which
influences the entire movie.  Aiyana Elliott tries to get sun flare in
almost every shot which tracks down the desolate patches of road and
field in the heartland of America.</P>
<P>The interviews have a range from the honest to the superficial, which
you'll find in many documentaries. When people try to get into the depth
of Jack's persona or personality, it feels pretty thin and rote. Still,
Aiyana Elliott is able to capture the gravity of silences, when people
aren't sure what to say. There's a brilliant sequence where she asks her
mom how good of a husband and father he was, and she can't answer for a
good minute, trying to control her fits of laughter.</P>
<P>There's a wonderful, definitive moment where Aiyana and her dad are
driving around trying to find the first house she lived in. It's
important for her, a touch of personal nostalgia, and he can't find it.
He finally gives up after having promised her to track it down. He's a
pill, even a bit of a prick. Boy, does he annoy Aiyana onscreen, but the
moment plays out sad and funny.</P>
<P>That's the tone of The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack, which earns the moment
where Jack sings a lonely tune for his daughter at the last concert.
He's too mean to be sentimental, but the heartstrings get tugged
nonetheless.</P>
