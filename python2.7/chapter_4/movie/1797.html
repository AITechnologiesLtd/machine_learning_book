<PRE>ARMY OF DARKNESS
Directed by Sam Raimi
Starring Bruce Campbell</PRE>
<P>     General Comment: If you have a life (i.e., you're not making a
fortune by sticking coal up your butt), you'll enjoy this movie.</P>
<P>     Sam Raimi has an intense visual style which I would characterize
as the Coen brothers locked in puberty.  And I don't mean that in a bad
way (by the way, the two directors are acquaintances and have a film--I
forget the name--in which all three were involved.  Sam Raimi also
appears in Coen Brothers' MILLER'S CROSSING, briefly.) One of Raimi's
proclaimed influences are the Three Stooges.  Curiously enough, it is
specifically that influence which pops up in ARMY OF DARKNESS as often
as the number of times undead pop out of the ground.</P>
<P>     It's a tough task that Raimi tackles in making a sequel to the
tightly crafted EVIL DEAD II: DEAD BY DAWN (essentially a remake of
EVIL DEAD, or as Raimi claims, a remake of EVIL DEAD as a *tribute to
the Three Stooges*.  Go figure.)  It's one thing to have mundane
machoman Ash (Bruce Campbell) surviving in an isolated house in the
woods chopping evil dead limbs, spouting one-liners to the already dead
like "You're going down" but it's a much more monumental challenge to
propel Ash into a movie of epic form, epic in the tradition of KING
ARTHUR AND THE ROUND TABLE and D&D-like fantasy novels.</P>
<P>     We have seen plenty of fantasy movies from Hollywood, and to be
quite frank, they all sucked (THE DARK CRYSTAL being a remarkable
exception, sci-fi not being included in the genre I call fantasy, and
THE PRINCESS BRIDE not really fantasy).  The pretense of making a
"real" fantasy just becomes too inflated on the big screen.  All the
costumes and makeup don't come even close to the images we've already
formed in our heads.  No one's been able to touch that dreamworld who's
foundation lies in the logos of reading books and playing D&D games.
And wisely enough, considering the character of Ash, Raimi avoids even
trying.</P>
<P>     Instead, Raimi sticks to his guns.  Army of Darkness is slapstick
and parody (a parody of King Arthur and other mythological legends)
backed up by solid effects and amazing camerawork.</P>
<P>     Just as a note, there are some scenes in which Raimi's cameraman
had epileptic seizures, and though they were intentional, it was a bit
distracting (I kept thinking through the fast camera work, "Don't tell
the story in pans ... tell the story in cuts, Sam.  No, Sam, schizoid,
fast blurry pans are not an exception to the rule.").  And as if he
heard me, Raimi's next scene involves a hilarious rapid-fire sequence
of cuts in which Ash dresses in knight gear.  Bravo!</P>
<P>     The comedy potential for situating Ash into a mythological role as
The Prophesized One is realized by Raimi, but only halfway.  There are
great scenes.  As Ash begins to gain respect from the medieval people,
he yells with authority, waving his gun in the air, "This ... is my
BOOM STICK."  The scene in which Ash finds the NECRONOMICON is also
unforgettable (and elicited the most noise from the audience as Ash
mutters "I know it starts with an 'n'...") However, it seems to me that
Raimi didn't study his fantasy films, because in the end he resorts to
Three Stooges (Ouch ouch!  Take this!  Oof!  Stop it, stop it!
Nyuknyuk!--you know the kind) type humor to keep his movie going.
While that base level of humor had its moments, overdoing it seemed to
drain the menace out of the Army of Darkness and hence the climax never
got off to a jump start.  There's the cliche technology vs. brute force
theme and that's about it.</P>
<P>     It is my opinion that Raimi should have limited his humor to the
interplay between Ash (90s man) and the medieval myth-seeking folk and
the machoesque manner in which Ash disposes of The Dead (great scene in
which Ash flexes after shooting a witch from behind his back).
However, he focused that Three Stooginizations upon The Dead also, a
mistake he didn't make in EVIL DEAD II.  The leader of The Army of
Darkness appeared stupid, harmless and for a while I thought he was a
metaphor for Curly.  Who knows.</P>
<P>     But there's something to be said for the almost Ren & Stimpy-esque
manner in which Raimi has his characters trying to prove their
manliness and survive at the same time.  There's something to be said
for the times in which indignity stares both Ash and the viewer right
in the face whether it be in the form of skeletal fingers or just
forgetfulness.  And I would never dismiss Raimi's talent as
prepubescent or wasted.  After all, I enjoyed the movie.</P>
