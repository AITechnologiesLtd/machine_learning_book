<PRE>THE EDGE (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>The Edge is a beautifully photographed action thriller. There are two
strings of plot that run through the film, the biggest of them is of
survival. The other is about being rich. Who can you trust if you were a
multi-millionaire? Do people talk to you only because you're rich? Did that
pretty model marry because of your money? Life seems rough when you're rich.</P>
<P>The Edge follows the life of a multimillionaire, Charles Morse (Anthony
Hopkins), who is on a trip to the wilderness because his model wife has a
photo shoot with photographer Robert Green (Alec Baldwin). After the shoot
with Charles' wife, Robert wants to go find an old Indian bear hunter for
another shoot. Before going of to find the Indian, he invites Charles
along, and Charles agrees. They fly out to find the Indian, but catastrophe
happens and the plane crashes. Charles is an avid reader and has all sorts
of knowledge stored up in his head, including enough knowledge to help get
Robert, Stephen (Harold Perrineau Jr., who plays Robert's assistant), and
himself out of the wilderness.</P>
<P>The Edge starts out a little slow, but quickly picks up pace when a
specific character is introduced. This amazing character would be the
man-eating bear (Bart the bear) that is stalking Robert, Charles and
Stephen. Whenever the story gets a little slow, Bart the bear is called in
to help quicken the pace. And that he does just that. Bart the bear creates
some genuinely frightening and white knuckled moments.</P>
<P>There is a plot thread about Robert having an affair with Charles' wife,
and planning to kill Charles so that he can get both the woman and the
money. This plot thread is introduced early on in the film, but is left to
smoulder while Bart the bear thrills us. But, as I thought that the plot
thread was merely dropped it shows up again, and provides some good tension
between Robert and Charles.</P>
<P>The Edge is beautifully photographed, and there has to be lots of kudos
given to the cinematographer, Donald McAlpine. He captures the beauty of
the wilderness and never misses a chance to put in more. The film is
beautiful. Lee Tamahori (Mulholland Falls) does a great job at keeping the
pace of the movie quick and crisp. Though the beginning is a little slow,
he manages to move past it rather well. Tamahori handles the action
sequences very well, and is able to create some high tension during some
scenes.</P>
<P>The score by Jerry Goldsmith is worth mentioning also. The score fits the
movie well. The score is broad and moody just like the film. And the score
never becomes overbearing.</P>
<P>The two real reasons to see The Edge are for Anthony Hopkins and Bart the
bear. Hopkins gives a good multi-leveled performance. His performance is
the one that the film rides on, and he does exceptionally well. When we
look into his eyes, and listen to him state something on screen, we can
also see that he is stating something but his mind is focused on figuring
out what's ahead of that. Bart the bear is also a good reason to see The
Edge. He is mighty scary, and worth the price of admission itself.</P>
<P>The one person that I found as the weak link was Alec Baldwin. Maybe I'm
just used to seeing him in a more take-control part, but the whiner that he
plays in The Edge just doesn't work. He tries to be a whiner, but it never
comes off as being genuine. Baldwin hasn't had any good films lately, his
best role ever, for me, was his role as Jack Ryan in The Hunt for Red
October. And though I didn't think he fit his role in The Edge, this is one
of his better and more memorable performances in the long while since The
Hunt for Red October.</P>
<P>The Edge is a highly entertaining movie about the survival of men in the
wilderness. It starts off slow but quickly picks up the pace. Its action is
thrilling and will keep you at the edge of your seat while its beautiful
photography will take your breath away. Hopkins is the star of the film,
and he does a great job with his role. Don't miss this film in the theatres.</P>
