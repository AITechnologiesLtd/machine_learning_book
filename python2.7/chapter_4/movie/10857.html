<P>     With ILLTOWN, it's time once more to enter the seedy world of drug 
using and dealing, only on this occasion, at least there's a little 
variation on the theme (although it's not a very good one).  The drug 
dealers want out, and the turf war that starts to fill the vacuum of 
power is more about settling a personal grudge than it is about making 
the local crime boss rich.  However, while the storyline is not 
inherently uninteresting, writer/director Nick Gomez is determined to 
make this as much of a spiritual allegory as a small-time gangster 
drama.  This is a mistake, and the muddled result feels a lot like a 
failed Wim Wenders project.  </P>
<P>     When it comes to concrete characters, ILLTOWN offers Michael 
Rapaport's Dante (as classical allusions go, this one is a little too 
obvious) and Lily Taylor's Micky.  They're an upper middle class couple 
who have made their money by selling drugs for the local syndicate boss, 
D'Avalon (Tony Danza).  Now, sensing the inevitable approach of middle-
age, they want to go legitimate and start a family.  But, just as 
they're considering a way out, a new dealer by the name of Gabriel (Adam 
Trese), storms into their territory, spikes their drugs (causing six 
overdose deaths), and declares war on Dante and his best friend, Cisco 
(Kevin Corrigan).  The results are as predictable as they are bloody.</P>
<P>     Occasionally, Gomez (who previously brought the grim-and-gritty NEW 
JERSEY DRIVE to the screen) inserts strange, metaphysical images into 
his film.  Dead people re-appear on golf courses to give advice, a God-
like figure dispenses pearls of wisdom ("You're never going to find what 
you're looking for if what you're looking for is an easy way out," he 
tells Dante), and dreams occasionally intermingle with reality.  
Unfortunately, little of this stuff really works, and it all comes 
across as a rather pretentious and unwanted interruption in an otherwise 
humdrum story.  And, worst of all, the ending is so bogged down in 
spiritual imagery that it's virtually impossible to decipher what really 
happens.  The result of this bizarre ambiguity is an understandable 
sense of dissatisfaction.</P>
<P>     At least in ILLTOWN, I wasn't irritated by Michael Rapaport's 
abrasive (and overrated) acting style.  While this is by no means a 
complete performance, Rapaport shows flashes of promise and manages to 
forge a fragile emotional link between himself and the audience.  Lili 
Taylor's work, however, is more compelling.  With fewer scenes than her 
co-star, she develops the film's only consistently sympathetic 
individual.  Most of the other actors do adequate jobs playing standard 
types, although Adam Trese's Gabriel is a shell of a character with 
incomprehensible motives.  Trese never loses his annoying smile, even 
when he's being shot or beaten up.  I would also like to make mention of 
Tony Danza, who sheds his sunny, likable image to create a surprisingly 
effective villain.</P>
<P>     Clearly, I would have appreciated ILLTOWN if it had been more 
straightforward.  Gomez has tried something different, but the gamble 
doesn't pay off.  This isn't really a "deep" film; it's silliness 
masquerading as philosophy.  With all of the oblique references to 
redemption and salvation, there are times when the allegorical elements 
of ILLTOWN distract from the film's unremarkable, conventional aspects.  
With its painfully introspective tone, the movie is as low-energy as can 
be without threatening to lull audience members to sleep.  (However, 
anyone who dozes off will likely be awakened by gunfire as one of many 
high-school kids is blown away.)  As far as I'm concerned, the ending is 
ILLTOWN's biggest single flaw, but it's only one of many pieces that 
doesn't fit into the overall puzzle. </P>
