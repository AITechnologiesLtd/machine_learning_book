<PRE>THE MUSE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>A few days ago screenwriter Steven Phillips (Albert Brooks), the winner
of a humanitarian award for his life's work, was on top of the world.
Now, a studio executive -- who proudly owns the sofa used in SAVING
PRIVATE RYAN -- tells him that he's lost his edge and should be changing
careers.</P>
<P>THE MUSE, directed by Brooks and written by Brooks and Monica Johnson,
plays like an in-joke to Brooks himself, since he clearly seems to have
lost some of his edge in crafting it.  A writer and comic who's the best
when he's the nastiest, Brooks creates for himself a character that's
way too accommodating and sweet.</P>
<P>At its high points, as in its numerous cameos, the movie can be quite
funny.  Between these islands of laughter, however, lie too many deserts
of blandness.</P>
<P>Steven falls back on the custom of turning to someone famous when you
need a favor.  Since he met Steven Spielberg two decades ago, he tries
to set up another meeting with him.  After an incredible ordeal, he
finally gets a 5-minute audience with Spielberg.  His time alone with
cinematic royalty doesn't turn out to be quite what he expected.  He
talks with Steven Spielberg's cousin Stan (Steven Wright), who doesn't
do anything other than offer advice about future movies.  "Just
remember, make it in color," Stan says.  "People like color."</P>
<P>In order to rejuvenate his creative juices, Steven decides he is willing
to try anything including a crazy idea from his Oscar-winning friend
Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges).  Jack suggests Steven give his muse (Sarah)
a try.</P>
<P>Unless you've hired one before, you probably have no concept of the
enormous cost involved in hiring a muse.  Sharon Stone, who normally
takes herself way too seriously, plays Sarah with uncharacteristic,
child-like playfulness.  A world-class spendthrift, Sarah demands a
$1,700 a day suite at the Four Seasons Hotel and a refrigerator stocked
with special food.  She also expects Steven to be constantly at her beck
and call as her personal gofer.</P>
<P>Sarah doesn't tell her clients what to do.  She just inspires them.  Her
resume includes being the uncredited creative force behind THE TRUMAN
SHOW and THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT.  For Steven, she assists him in coming
up with a killer idea for a great summer comedy.  He proposes having Jim
Carrey inherit a troubled aquarium in which the fish die.</P>
<P>After Sarah bonds with Steven's wife, Laura, she starts helping the wife
and ignoring the husband.  As a would-be Mrs. Fields, Laura is played in
an awkward and wooden performance by Andie MacDowell.  In a movie that
needs more drive, MacDowell functions as the production's black hole,
sucking the energy out whenever she appears.</P>
<P>Hollywood's brightest stars drop by to get Sarah's advice or to pay her
tribute for past suggestions.  We learn that it was because of her that
Wolfgang Pung took only 30 seconds to decide it would be goat cheese,
and not mozzarella, on his famous pizzas.  James Cameron comes knocking
at her door wanting advice.  "I just don't see you going back to water
anytime soon," she counsels him briefly before sending him on his way.</P>
<P>Martin Scorsese has less luck when he comes by seeking her thoughts on
his remake of RAGING BULL using a really thin guy.  A caffeine-stoked up
Scorsese bounces away when she turns out not to be there at the time.</P>
<P>Where is a muse when you need one?  Let's hope Albert Brooks locates one
before his next film.  He's a national treasure who deserves all the
muses he needs.</P>
<P>THE MUSE runs 1:37.  It is rated PG-13 for brief nudity.  It would be
fine for kids 9 and up, but they would probably need to be teenagers to
enjoy it.</P>
