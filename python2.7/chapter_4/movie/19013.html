<PRE>                                TARZAN
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Disney Studios has made three films
          about the Tarzan-like Mowgli.  Now they finally have
          made a film about Tarzan himself, but what a
          disappointment. They have aimed it at a very young
          audience and thrown in a lot of anachronistic
          humor.  They have turned their backs on all but the
          basics of the original plot. The Phil Collins songs
          are nauseating and the so-called comic style is
          just as bad.  The animation is great, but little
          else will be of interest to Burroughs fans or
          adults.  This is a real letdown for Disney
          animation after MULAN. Rating: 4 (0 to 10), low 0
          (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Disney Studios seems to love the concept of feral children.  They
have made three films from Rudyard Kipling's THE JUNGLE BOOK.  Now they
are starting in on Tarzan, Edgar Rice Burroughs's even more popular
character originally inspired by the Mowgli tales.  And with luck,
starting is all they will do.  Tarzan would be a good choice for Disney
studios since Disney never feels particularly obligated to be faithful
to the source material.  After all, why bother?  Their version will be
the canonical one after it is released anyway, right?  But Burroughs
fans are used to disappointment.  With all the many theatrical film
versions of Tarzan almost none have been accurate to the Burroughs
conception. Until the Disney version the original 1918 film version of
TARZAN OF THE APES and the first half of GREYSTOKE: THE LEGEND OF
TARZAN, LORD OF THE APES are the only films that even look at where
Tarzan came from and how he got to be Tarzan. The rest just assumed
there was this man in the jungle.</P>
<P>     In the new Disney animated version we begin with a mother, father,
and baby escaping from a burning ship and trying to survive ashore in
equatorial Africa. (In the book they were Alice and John Clayton, but
the name Clayton is used in this film for the villain.)  At about the
same time the she-gorilla Kala (voiced by Glenn Close) lost her own
baby to Sabor the fierce leopard who holds Kala's tribe in fear.  The
grieving Kala hears the cry of a human baby and finds a tree house
destroyed by Sabor, and in it a dead man and woman, and their still-
living baby.  Over the objection of her mate Kerchak (Lance Henrickson)
and the disapproval of the other apes Kala adopts the baby, naming him
Tarzan.  Tarzan (Alex D. Linz as a boy and Tony Goldwyn as a man) grows
up an outsider with an androgynous friend Terk (Rosie O'Donnell who
brings entirely too much Rosie O'Donnell humor to the film).  Tarzan
struggles to win the approval of Kerchak, but Kerchak is a bigot who is
not ready to accept a human into his family. (Yes, there are many
politically-correct lessons in the course of the film.) Eventually
Tarzan meets humans who come in an expedition to find gorillas.  The
expedition is made up of Professor Porter (Nigel Hawthorne), his
daughter Jane (Minnie Driver), and guide Clayton (Brian Blessed).  Of
course, the expected love story is told one more time.</P>
<P>     I cannot think what Disney's studios could have done to so
alienate Hans Zimmer that he would leave them in the lurch when they so
desperately needed him. Zimmer, who scored films like THE LION KING,
has a feel for the sound of African music.  He could have done a
beautiful score for TARZAN.  Instead we have a collection of totally
obnoxious songs by Phil Collins.  Mark Mancina's music harmlessly fills
in the spaces.  On the other hand, the animation is little short of
wonderful with odd stylistic touches that mix flat animation with some
impressive three-dimensional animation.  In Disney's new tradition, a
different team animates each of the major characters.  One advantage of
this, I suppose is a lot more people can be working in parallel on a
single scene, yet a single character is consistently animated through
the entire film.  Some parts of the screen may look like traditional
flat animation; others will seem to be almost filmed as live-action.
It could be bothersome having more than one animation techniques in a
single scene, but it really is not.  The one animation problem is that
the words do not really fit the characters' lips well.</P>
<P>     Several problems with the script and its visualization show how
this film talks down to its audience.  We see Tarzan skid over tree-
limbs with obvious skate-boarding motions.  And the tree limbs would
have to be thirty feet long or more for the time he spends on each
limb.  And where in the world are there so many major waterfalls in
such close proximity?  We know immediately that Clayton is a villain
because he is so ugly.  Just once it would be nice to have an
attractive villain and an ugly hero.  (Lookism apparently continues to
be exempt from the Disney agenda.)  How likely is it that the
expedition has brought a magic lantern and a praxinoscope and hence is
prepared to teach Tarzan about civilization.  This seems like in the
worst traditions of "Gilligan's Island."</P>
<P>     There are no African people in this version.  That is not
surprising since however they are portrayed there would be someone
unhappy with the representation.  Though Africans are present in the
original novel, Disney decision-makers probably thought it was best
side-stepping the issues of including them in their adaptation.  There
have been some people taking issue with the fact they have been
eliminated, but it is relatively few.  It is ironic that the filmmakers
may be afraid to put in native Africans since they have Tarzan himself
ask the question, "why are you afraid of anything different from you?"
Apparently the filmmakers felt they themselves had something to fear.
But it is doubly ironic because Tarzan himself is a symbol of the power
of diversity.  After all he is presumably the lord of the animals
because he is actually human, and he is an invincible hero among humans
because he was raised by animals.</P>
<P>     Disney studios had the potential to make a very good adaptation of
the Edgar Rice Burroughs classic fantasy TARZAN OF THE APES.  Instead
they have set their sights considerably lower and made a film that will
have little appeal beyond grade-school level audiences.  I rate it a 4
on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
