<P>_Dead_Man_on_Campus_ (R) * (out of ****)</P>
<P>While I am not fond of any writer's use of cheap, easy puns, I am not
completely above using them myself when the situation merits it (witness my
review of _Pecker_ from a couple of issues ago).  So here goes: the
juvenile, college-set black comedy _Dead_Man_on_Campus_ is dead on arrival.</P>
<P>Strait-laced med student Josh (Tom Everett Scott, who manages to remain
somewhat likable throughout)'s blemish-free academic record breaks out into
Fs, thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate, Cooper
(Mark-Paul Gosselaar), who introduces Josh to the sex- and booze-filled
nights that come with university life.  With the threat of losing an
academic scholarship (Josh) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming
(Cooper), what are two good-hearted slackers to do?  Easy--look for a
loophole, which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school
charter that states that if a student's (or students') roommate commits
suicide, the surviving student(s) shall receive straight As.  So instead of
studying, Josh and Cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student
out there, move him into their dorm room, and drive him to suicide before
the semester ends.</P>
<P>Director Alan Cohn and screenwriters Michael Traeger and Mike White
(working from a story by Anthony Abrams and Adam Larson Broder) take their
sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with Josh and Cooper's
diabolical plot.  Until then, the usual boring cliches of college life
(booze, sex, more booze) fill the time, which is made to feel longer by
_Saved_by_the_Bell_ alumnus Gosselaar's sitcom-bred mugging.  That said,
once Cohn and company do build some comic momentum, they mishandle it.  The
introduction of the manic, psychotic Cliff (Lochlyn Munro), a potential
roommate for Josh and Cooper, brings some demented life to the uninspired
proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less
interesting candidates: paranoid nerd Buckley (Randy Pearlstein) and
British death rocker Matt (Corey Page).  One wishes that Cliff would
reappear, but, as they say, be careful what you wish for.  Not
surprisingly, he does resurface, and it then becomes clear that this is a
character that is best taken in a small dose; almost immediately, his
extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty.</P>
<P>The same can be said about all of _Dead_Man_on_Campus_.  Whatever morbid
appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates, and the
self-absorbed characters, especially Cooper, pretty much grate from the
get-go.  _Dead_Man_ doesn't grow tiresome; it already _is_ once the clever
opening titles are through.  As it slogs along to a cheesy,
happy-for-all-parties conclusion, _Dead_Man_ lives up to its title and then
some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die, it still
insists on going on... like a zombie.</P>
