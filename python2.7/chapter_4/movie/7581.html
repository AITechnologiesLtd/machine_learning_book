<PRE>                         NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>The word that springs to mind is SPELLBINDING.   In every way, which
includes the taut direction, the superb cast, the witty and precise
dialogue, and of course, the story (based on Robert Daley's book,
TAINTED EVIDENCE, that word sums up the film.   Andy Garcia, who is in
almost every scene, gives a terrific performance.  Richard Dreyfuss, a
real pro, just has to give a slight smirk, a lift of an eyebrow and he
is utterly believable.  And then there is the rest of the superb
supporting cast aiding to make this a Four-Byter.</P>
<P>This is a story of integrity, of being able to look oneself in the
mirror. That is what eventually confronts Sean Casey (Garcia) when he
begins to investigate the police force, 3 suspect precincts in NYC; and
he has to wonder about Joey (James Gandolfini), the cop and partner of
Sean's  father, Liam Casey (Ian Holm) and who is on the take,
protecting and giving information to the drug dealers in exchange for
money?</P>
<P>Jordan Washington (Shiek Mahmud-Bey) is impressive, tall, handsome and
menacing as the drug dealer the police would like to kill because they
have been offered a better deal than he was willing to give them.
When they close in on him, he ends up fatally shooting several police
and severely wounding the police veteran, Liam Casey.   That is all the
excuse District Attorney Morgenstern (Ron Leibman) needs to order his
cops to  make Washington sorry he was ever born "and we'll worry about
the Civil Liberties Union later!" Washington had surrendered to
Attorney Sam Vigoda (Dreyfuss), an attorney in the mode of famed
attorney William Kunstler.   And is Dreyfuss ever good!</P>
<P>Morgenstern is running for higher office against another District
attorney, Elihu Harrison (Colm Fiore) and in this high profile case
against Washington, he invites Sean, a former cop, and now a neophyte
attorney in the District Attorney's office, to be the prosecutor.   He
tells him the trial will be a snap: several police fatally shot by
Washington, Sean's father in the hospital, drug  dealer.  "You can't
lose."    They reckon without the brilliance of Vigoda.</P>
<P>Love interest in this tale of divided loyalties, backbiting and
honesty, is provided by Peggy (Lena Olin) who works in Vigoda's office
but falls in love with Sean.</P>
<P>Sidney Lumet feels: "The greatest threats to the nation are drugs and
racism."  He wants us to start fighting back before it is too late.
"Where is the line that separates "healthy compromise" from
"destructive loss of idealism?  'Just don't do it' and 'Just say "No"
is symptomatic of everything cockeyed about how we live: Put a sound
byte on it and it will go away."</P>
<P>Written and Directed by Sidney Lumet.</P>
