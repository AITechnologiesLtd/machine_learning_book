<PRE>"Modernization must die" </PRE>
<P>In our time. In our modern world, where the cool rule, it's hard to
imagine that Shakespeare is becoming 'the man'. And yet - film after
film, after film, is based on his everlasting magic. In Warner
Brothers' latest production, Shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat,
while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away.</P>
<P>Though the producers of The Matrix have vaguely based their picture on
William Shakespeare's 'Romeo And Juliet' , its title sequence with a
frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark
streets of New York, is very hard to associate with Shakespeare's
poetry. The film takes place during a silent war between the two major
mafia families in the city - the Afro Americans against the
Chinese. The youngest son of a Chinese mafia chieftain is found
murdered. The Afro-Americans are immediately suspected, but a peace
treaty is signed between the two godfathers. It is at this point that
Han (the Romeo of the story) finds out about his brother's
death. Escaping from a prison in China, he returns to United States to
avenge his brother's fate. But before he can restore justice with his
Kung Fu kicks, he falls in love with a mysterious beauty. The only
problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy..</P>
<P>There's only a weak echo of Shakespeare's talent in this disappointing
production. And there are more problems besides its title. Of course
we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece. We call it
'modernization'. It seems that the producers fear that the audience
will not respond to lyrics, without any car chases and gun
fights. This lack of respect for the audience I find very
disturbing. Kenneth Brannagh has already proven that Shakespeare
doesn't need to be updated, because his tales are grounded in the
basics of life and human nature. And as long as love, hate, honesty
and corruption do exist, everyone will understand and embrace
Shakespeare. I must admit that I found 'Rome Must Die' very
confusing. I can forgive Andrzej Bartkowiak, since it is his first
attempt at directing. He manages to create an incredible atmosphere
and directs with a firm precision. Unfortunately he completely forgot
about character- and story developments. His latest picture is
therefore visually impressive, but intellectually hollow. The love
story between Han (Jet Li) and Trish (Aalyah), and the mafia intrigues
are undeveloped and simplified. Jet Li is one of the most amazing
fighters to ever hit the silver screen and Aalyah has a magical
voice. Their achievement save this film from being completely
braindead, but they are not actors, and therefore can not act. They
are nothing more than two celebrities put together. The other actors,
including Isaiah Washington, Russell Wong, Henry O and DMX all give
the standard mediocre performances. Delroy Lindo is the only one that
projects a coherent image of reality. But there's more than acting to
worry about. Even with Li's incredible skills in martial arts, the
action scenes (though technically excellent) are too long and story
updates simply embarrassing. To make a long story short: 'Romeo Must
Die' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller, not sensual enough to
be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film. It is certain
that Bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and
completely unnecessary parallel to 'Romeo and Juliet', so the film is
completely stuck - not sure of what to be. And in the end it's
nothing. There are no performances worthy of notice, no interesting
character- or story surprises. So again, the only good thing about it
is its technical achievement. This film can boast of great sound, fast
paced editing, solid cinematography and some very well coordinated
action sequences. The music is another factor that prevents you from
leaving the theatre. It is mostly provided by Aalyah's enchanting
voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists,
that create a kind of 'ghetto feel' to it. But when I think back, it's
not much I remember from this 'production'. As in almost every summer
movie, there are some interesting scenes, but most of the moments that
I remember are associated with massive special effects. It is not a
film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities, simply
because it doesn't have any. For someone who has never read
Shakespeare, it's another popcorn film. For those of us who has, it's
a waste of money, time and brain cells.</P>
