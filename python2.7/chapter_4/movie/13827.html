<PRE>THE NEGOTIATOR (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Movies can be seen as bookends and the books in between. The bookends are
the opening and closing of the film and the books contain the story and
subplots of the film. Most movies have beautifully crafted bookends and
thin poorly written books. The Negotiator goes the other way. The bookends
for The Negotiator are bent out of shape and not beautiful at all. The
books that the bookends hold are tense and well written.</P>
<P>The Negotiator has a cliched and unbelievable opening. Danny Roman (Samuel
L. Jackson) is the best negotiator in his department. In the opening, Roman
is trying to talk a man out of killing his own daughter. Roman finally uses
some dangerous tactics to get the girl free and for this, he takes some
heat from his commanders. What we find out later, during the cliched
after-I-saved-the-day party, is that Roman's partner suspects that some of
the officers in the department are stealing money from the department.
Before Roman finds out too much from his partner, his partner is killed.
Roman is suspected of killing his partner. Though we know that he is being
framed.</P>
<P>What comes next is the contrived part in an instant, Roman's whole
department turns against him. They all think he's the killer. What doesn't
ring true is that from what I've seen, cops are pretty protective of each
other. What is portrayed onscreen just doesn't jive. But, this is also the
point in which the movie picks up a lot of steam. Roman takes hostages, one
being a key figure in the money stealing deal. Roman wants to force this
person to admit to what has been happening; he wants to clear his name.
Roman demands that a negotiator from outside his department do the
negotiating, and he will only talk to Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey). Jackson,
who by himself is already a great actor and a big presence on the screen,
is now joined by Kevin Spacey as the negotiator. From now on, the acting of
these two intense actors drives the movie.</P>
<P>One other thing drives The Negotiator. Though we think that the person that
Roman is holding hostage is maybe one of the people involved in the money
stealing scheme, we also know that there are others from Roman's department
that are part of the scheme. But who? Director F. Gary Gray and writers
James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox throw all kinds of bones out. And it isn't
until the very end that we find out who is behind all of this. I loved this
because it kept me guessing as to who was in the scheme and who wasn't.</P>
<P>Jackson and Spacey are from two different ends of the intense-acting
spectrum. Jackson is verbal and loudly eloquent. Spacey, on the other hand,
carries an inner intensity that radiates with his eyes and his calm
exterior. The two light up the screen. It is the dialogue between these two
that kept my attention.</P>
<P>The script by James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox is very knowledgeable about the
ways of negotiators. Watch for the lessons about negotiations by Roman
during the film. I loved how DeMonaco and Fox worked in a lesson on what to
say to hostage takers. Roman also talks about what to look for in order to
see that a person is lying. I think that DeMonaco and Fox did some good
research before embarking on writing this script. The script itself has a
meaty midsection that is sandwiched by a weak opening and closing.</P>
<P>Director F. Gary Gray keeps the movie tight and tense. Roman takes hostages
in an office in the midsection of a high rise. Gray uses the tight quarters
of this office fully. The only complaint I have is that Gray and the
writers threw in an action sequence halfway into the film that didn't feel
right. I thought that Gray and the writers were doing very well with the
negotiations between Roman and Sabian, but then all the sudden there
appears this action sequence. But, this is a small complaint. Kudos to Gray
for putting together a taut film.</P>
<P>The supporting actors all fare well. Look for the late J.T. Walsh in his
final performance. David Morse and John Spencer turn up good supporting
performances.</P>
<P>Don't let the bookends of The Negotiator fool you into thinking that it's a
raggedy movie. Don't Miss The Negotiator in the theatres. This is a solid
film that will keep you at the edge of your seat from the beginning to the
end.</P>
