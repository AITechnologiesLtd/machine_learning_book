<P>Another "Jennifer-Aniston-cast-as-the-beautiful-girl-with-no-luck-
in-relationships" movie attempts to add a little variety onto the
proverbial menu, by slapping a gay lead as her man of choice, while
serving the consequences of their relationship as the main course.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Lovely, independent woman does not want her boyfriend to move in with
her, but does request a gay friend of hers to do the same. Her
relationship with the gay man blossoms into a true friendship, as her
actual relationship with her boyfriend begins to crumble. When faced
with a life-altering decision, she must decide who she really loves,
who really loves her back, and how these decisions will affect their
future.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Would-be comedy actually delivers very little in the chuckle
department, runs way too long, musters up a weak ending, and offers
nothing substantially original or thought-provoking to the audience.
This film was actually quite dramatic at points, and within that
context, delivered very little substance to back itself up. The funnier
moments were lacking, the characters seemed pieced together, and the
ending just seemed to politically-agree with anyone who might care
(except for an audience looking to be entertained, that is.) </P>
<P>CHASING AMY (7.5/10) is the Kevin Smith film that bookmarked the idea
of a heterosexual falling head over heels for a homosexual, but that
film made sure that we understood where each character was coming from,
mixed the whole fling within various real circumstances, and delivered
many funny moments and hip dialogue. Having said that, I also didn't
care for AMY's ending, but that's because I didn't find Banky's
decision realistic. This movie, on the other hand, seemed very cliché,
unoriginal, and quite boring.</P>
<P>Many of Nina's (Aniston) decisions in the film seem self-centered and
unexplained, and left us wondering why she was acting the way that she
was. Also, I never really bought into her "love" for her gay roommate,
and didn't appreciate the zillions of shots of them dancing together,
to make this point (Oh, I get it. If they're dancing together, that
MUST be love!!). All in all, this film is so-so in its narrative, so-so
in the acting department, but boring over its entire close to two-hour
running course. Nigel Hawthorne was the only standout in the cast as
the older, wiser, and more sensitive soul. </P>
<P>Unless you are in this exact type of situation in your own life, do not
see this film. And even if you are in the same type of scenario, you
will still not be entertained by this film, but may take away some
questions of your own. Either way, do yourself a favor and see Kevin
Smith's CHASING AMY instead. A way superior movie, with better
characters, better dialogue, and a much more entertaining story-line.
You might even want to see MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING (7.5/10) for a more
mainstream solution.</P>
