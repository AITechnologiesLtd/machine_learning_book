<PRE>                                 CLERKS
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1994) ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I guess it's just the fact that I've been a teenager for the past 
five years and heard every possible obscenity and sexual innuendo 
on a daily basis, but the film CLERKS didn't offend me at all. There 
were certain lines of dialogue that morally disgusted me, but none 
of it had any shock value. Nothing new under the sun, as it were. 
But the Motion Picture Association of America took a different 
stance on the movie, slapping it with the dreaded NC-17 rating, 
the first movie ever to receive an NC-17 based on language alone. 
It was eventually reduced to R, but CLERKS is definitely an 
adult film, even if I've heard and read this kind of stuff since 
junior high.</P>
<P>        Talented director Kevin Smith brings us a day in the life 
of two slackers, Dante Hicks (no relation) and Randal, who work in 
a convenience store and video store, respectively (but not respectfully). 
Dante agrees to man the store on his day off because another employee 
is sick. He definitely picked the wrong day to come to work. By the 
day's end, he's closed the store twice to go to a funeral and play 
hockey on the roof, been responsible for an act of necrophelia, lost 
two girlfriends and been fined $500 for selling cigarettes to a four 
year old, among other things.</P>
<P>        In the wake of PULP FICTION's revolutionary use of 
pop-culture references in intelligent dialogue, CLERKS brings us 
several memorable exchanges, in sexual and nonsexual contexts, 
including the least respectable job on the planet (the guy who 
mops the peep show booths at a porno house), the ending of 
THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK vs. RETURN OF THE JEDI and 
Randal on the phone to the video distributor, ordering a couple 
dozen adult movie titles while a woman and her small child wait 
to be helped. There are plenty of G-rated sequences mixed in with 
the NC-17 ones, leading me to believe this movie actually could 
be shown on TV one day, albeit in an hour time slot.</P>
<P>        CLERKS is basically plotless, but Smith keeps it far 
above the level of a sitcom or "wild comedy" movie like D.C. 
CAB or REVENGE OF THE NERDS. It has a distinct identity 
no other "Generation X" film has brought us, filmed in black-
and-white, surveillance camera-style. Most artsy movies like this 
don't appeal to the masses, but CLERKS brings with it that 
self-indulgent air of dirty talk most people our age secretly enjoy 
engaging in at some point or another with our friends. What the 
MPAA needs to realize is that everyone's life would be rated 
NC-17 if it were a movie because none of us can escape the adult 
situations and dialogue life brings us. Not to mention the 
gratuitous nudity every time we take showers.</P>
