<PRE>Love Stinks  ***1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Rated R
Independent Artists</PRE>
<P>Starring: French Stewart (3rd Rock), Bridgette Wilson (Billy Madison, Mortal
Kombat), Tyra Banks (supermodel), Bill Bellamy (MTV guy), Tiffani-Amber
Thiessen (90210 vixen), and Jason Bateman (one of those Hogans)
Jeff Franklin (Director/Writer)</P>
<P>In the new movie "Love Stinks", French Stewart plays Seth, a funny TV writer
who is smitten with the likes of Chelsea, the matron of honor at his best
friend's wedding.  Seth and Chelsea hit it off and start dating and that is
where the fun begins.</P>
<P>As Chelsea quickly insinuates herself into every corner of Seth's life, he
has no recourse but to accept the inevitable.  French's quips on the demise
of his freedom are high points of the first act.  Even funnier is when the
relationship turns adversarial and Chelsea shows herself to be the psycho
that was always just underneath her perfectly molded surface.</P>
<P> I'm not one for toilet humor but when Seth tried to get her out of their
bed by bombarding her with nocturnal odors, I almost laughed up a kidney.
As their "war of the roses" escalates, so does the comedy.</P>
<P>Co-stars Bill Bellamy and Tyra Banks do a fine job as the respective best
friends of our combatants.  Cameos by Tifanni-Amber Thiessen and Jason
Bateman parodying themselves as TV stars is also handled with great aplomb.</P>
<P>If your comedic tastes match your culinary ones, this is a good meat and
potatoes comedy that should leave you feeling very satisfied.</P>
