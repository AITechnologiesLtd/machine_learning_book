<PRE>THE ART OF WAR</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Christian Duguay
Written by: Wayne Beach, Simon Barry</PRE>
<P>Agent Neil Shaw (Wesley Snipes) is a covert ops agent for the UN (I didn't 
even know the UN had a covert ops unit). He and his teammate, Bly (Michael 
Biehn), are employed by the Secretary General, Douglas Thomas (Donald 
Sutherland), and his right-hand man (his words, not mine), Eleanor Hooks 
(Anne Archer). His latest assignment involves spying on a Chinese diplomat 
(James Hong), who gets assassinated right in front of Shaw's eyes. Soon Shaw 
is on his own, after his teammates are killed, and he's running from both 
the Chinese and the Americans, since they believe he killed the diplomat. 
Thrown into the mix is a Chinese version of Donald Trump (movie's words, not 
mine), David Chan (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), who may know more about the 
assassination than he's letting on. The only person on his side is a Chinese 
reporter, Julia Fang (the very cute Marie Matiko), who knows he wasn't the 
assassin. Against him is FBI agent Frank Capella (Maury Chaykin), who is 
investigating a different crime which seems to link to the slain diplomat. 
Now Shaw and Julia have only 24 hours to clear his name, before...</P>
<P>... where was I? Sorry, I sort of drifted off for a minute there. "The Art 
of War" is something of an anomaly amongst action movies. It's an action 
movie which is intent on featuring as little action as possible. That's why, 
despite the fact that I'd had plenty of sleep, I was drifting off every 
twenty minutes or so. So what does Duguay ("Screamers") insert instead of 
action? Some of the worst dialogue you're likely to hear. "The Art of War" 
is an action movie with no action; a political thriller with no thrills; and 
a mystery you'll have figured out in the first twenty five minutes. Alright, 
alright, I know there's only one real question on your mind, and it's that 
you want to know if it's entertaining. I'm afraid not. In fact, you'll 
probably be indulging in one of three different activities rather than 
watching the movie. You might be snoring (quite a few people in the audience 
at my showing were doing that), you might me checking your watch (I wish I 
could have been doing that, but my pocket-watch has no indiglo), or you 
might be chatting with your neighbor (the rest of the audience was doing 
that). In case you're wondering, I was busy doodling on my notebook. Why am 
I sitting here, rambling about everyone's activities during the movie? 
Because writing a review for a truly dull movie is almost as bad as watching 
one.</P>
<P>Ah the acting, the acting is certainly one of the more dismal points to "The 
Art of War". Wesley Snipes has two acting modes: Slyly humorous and friendly 
(like in "Major League"), and gruffly stoic (like in "Blade"). Snipes is in 
full stoic mode in "The Art of War", which is a shame because he might have 
brought some humor to the script otherwise. Instead, the humor all comes 
from Maury Chaykin ("Cutthroat Island"). However, while Chaykin's brand of 
humor (which generally involves him quietly making strange comments) is 
rather amusing, it's completely out of place in this movie. Donald 
Sutherland does nothing more than chew scenery in a few scenes. Marie Matiko 
("Mystery Men"), who is a relative newcomer, plays Snipes's love interest (I 
think) in one of the most tacked on romances I've ever seen. That's not to 
say she does a poor job; it's just that her role was so useless she couldn't 
do much with it. Finally, we have Michael Biehn ("Aliens") and Anne Archer 
("Rules of Engagement"). I've always found Biehn to be one of the most 
underrated actors in Hollywood, turning in stellar performances in "The 
Abyss", "Terminator", and "Aliens". In "Rules of Engagement", Biehn seems to 
be going out of his way to prove me wrong. He overacts like no one this side 
of John Lithgow, he uses one of the worst Southern accents I've ever heard, 
and he fights like a girl. I could beat this guy up. Anne Archer, who I've 
never thought of as a particularly talented actress, just gives me more 
ammunition for my arguments against her.</P>
<P>Perhaps in the hands of a more skilled director, "The Art of War" could have 
been at least vaguely interesting. Afterall, Duguay's idea of neat 
directorial tricks are as follows: put little trails behind the bullets 
(pretty original, huh?); show us everything we've already seen in flashbacks 
as though we're too stupid to remember (I think the movie was actually an 
hour long, played twice); blast the soundtrack and sound effects at all 
times till the audiences' ears start bleeding; and throw in completely 
gratuitous nude scenes so as to appeal to young males who snuck in (most 
young males in my audience didn't catch the gratuitous nudity, they were too 
busy sleeping). Then again, with a script like this, maybe the director 
didn't make much of a difference. For all those (like me) who thought "The 
Perfect Storm" had horrendous dialogue, wait till you get to sit through 
this one. My personal favorite was Anne Archer saying: "My instinct tells me 
there is something lurking beneath the surface." She utters it with complete 
seriousness, and poor Donald Sutherland is forced to reply without bursting 
into hysterics (if you look at his face, it's obviously killing him).</P>
<P>So after all this complaining, are there any good points to "The Art of 
War"? Well, the first fifteen minutes have their moments. Snipes is sneaking 
into a skyscraper so he can blackmail a general into resuming peace talks 
(or something like that). The soundtrack during those few scenes is really 
quite good, and there are one or two decent action scenes (Snipes falling 
slowly towards earth using a damaged parachute). Also, Snipes may not be the 
world's best actor, but he does have some impressive moves. The film's 
ending goes on far past what was necessary, dragging on for about four 
scenes too many. One last thing - why do some directors (I won't name names) 
think audiences are so stupid that they feel a need to explain the most 
obvious ideas? In one scene, Maury Chaykin gets shot in the chest by an 
assassin after already being in a car accident. The assassin shoots him to 
ensure he's dead, obviously. After the assassin leaves, Chaykin stands up, 
curses a little, and proceeds to show us how he's miraculously still alive; 
a bulletproof vest! What wondrous invention is this? Apparently something 
fairly new since the assassin didn't even think to shoot Chaykin in the 
head. "The Art of War" runs an ungodly 117 minutes. I'd recommend it to no 
one and give it two out of five stars.</P>
