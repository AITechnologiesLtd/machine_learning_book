<P>         "One night in Bangkok, and the tough guys tumble," sang Murray
Head in the musical "Chess." Unfortunately for Alice Marano (Claire
Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale) that lyric proves prophetic
in "Brokedown Palace," the latest cinematic sermon about the dangers of
visiting Asian countries. Fresh out of their Ohio high school, Alice and
Darlene jet off to Thailand for a post-graduation vacation -- "Hawaii
seemed so middle-class," Alice explains -- and wind up staying quite a
bit longer than they expected after they're caught with two kilos of
heroin in one of their backpacks.</P>
<P> Had the girls gone to the movies in the last few years they
would have known travelling abroad will put you on the highway to Hell.
Didn't they see "Red Corner," in which poor Richard Gere was framed for
murder while on a business trip to China, or last year's "Return to
Paradise," which found Vince Vaughn and his buddies rotting in jail
after trying to export drugs from Thailand? No, they didn't -- and
neither did anyone else, for that matter.</P>
<P> It's unlikely "Palace" will attract much of an audience either,
since it's about as thrilling as a long line at customs. The screenplay,
apparently based on those recorded warnings played in airports, follows
Alice and Darlene on a downward spiral as they hook up with a slick
blond Australian (Daniel Lapaine) who offers to fly them to Hong Kong
for a weekend of high times. Instead, the duo are railroaded by shifty
bureaucrats into a prison populated entirely by stock characters (the
easy-going Jamaican, the inscrutable dragon lady, the jaded
Englishwoman, etc.); somewhere, the Hawaii tourism board is chuckling.</P>
<P> If "Palace" aims to be the female version of "Midnight
Express," it consistently rings false. For one thing, the jail is
frequently shot through gauzy golden filters, making it look more like a
dullish day camp than the nightmarish hole everyone keeps insisting it
is. Secondly, even though Darlene and Alice are supposed to be naive,
they keep doing such foolish things -- signing statements they can't
read, plotting escapes within earshot of their enemies -- you can't help
but feel they're to blame for their bad luck, not the Thai court system.</P>
<P>         Director Jonathan Kaplan, seemingly aware of the script's
failings, often resorts to dreamy montages of his stars to fill out
half-baked scenes. These sequences are accompanied by ethereal
dance-trance songs by Delirium and Sarah Brightman, and though the music
doesn't really jibe with the action, it's a lot easier to listen to than
David Arata's stale dialogue.</P>
<P> Through it all, Danes and Beckinsale struggle to bring some
conviction to a story sorely in need of it. Though Danes occasionally
has to strain to hit Alice's emotional peaks, she's a good deal more
credible here than she was playing a former junkie in the disasterous
"Mod Squad," and Beckinsale, the fabulous British actress who did
memorable work last year in "Shooting Fish" and "The Last Days of
Disco," eloquently captures Darlene's confusion and despair. As the
lawyer who tries to spring them, Bill Pullman is undermined by an
unconvincing character. James Sanford</P>
