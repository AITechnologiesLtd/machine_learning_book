<P>     THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST is one of those movies that tries so 
hard to be cute and romantic that it becomes sickeningly offensive.  
While the film probably holds some limited appeal for undemanding pre-
teen girls, that's about the most positive thing I have to say about it.  
There's little evidence of originality, inventiveness, or freshness in 
this trite production.  Even if you accept that it's intended to be a 
song-less satire (rather than a rip-off) of THE SOUND OF MUSIC, it still 
comes across as flat.  </P>
<P>     The story attempts to cram as many cliches as possible into an 
abysmal package.  Fran Drescher plays Joy Miller, a Queens beautician 
who is mistaken for a top-flight teacher by an emissary (Ian McNeice) 
from a tiny Eastern European country.  Faster than you can say 
"Karamazov", she has accepted a $40,000 job to tutor the local 
dictator's children.  She crosses the Atlantic and meets her four new 
charges:  two teenagers (Lisa Jakub, Adam Lavorgna), one pre-teen 
(Heather DeLoach), and one toddler.  Then there's the Stalin-like 
dictator himself, Boris Pochenko (Timothy Dalton), who spends his time 
muttering nasty things like this about running his country:  "It's not 
all making war and smashing dissidents."  So Joy sets out to smooth 
Boris' rough edges, improve his relationship with his kids, and make him 
a kinder, gentler beast.  In the process, of course, she falls in love.</P>
<P>     Being forced to listen to Fran Drescher's New Yawk accent for more 
than ninety minutes is enough to drive anyone to distraction, so, in an 
apparent attempt to camouflage how bad she sounds, the film makers 
decided to give all their actors horrible accents.  Since the bulk of 
the film takes place in Slovetzia, a fictional former Soviet country, 
everyone has adopted an "appropriate" accent.  Of course, they all speak 
English, even though there's a throwaway reference to that not being the 
native language.  It seems that even the poor, downtrodden peasants have 
mastered this second language.</P>
<P>     Generally, I enjoy romantic comedies, even when they're hopelessly 
mired in formulas.  However, for a movie of this sort to work its 
particular brand of magic, it has to possess intelligence or appeal, 
neither of which characterizes THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST.  At the 
outset, with a brief, clever animated sequence, the film seems to want 
to be different, but it isn't long before it has settled into a 
painfully bad rut.  Todd Graff's script is television-quality writing at 
its worst, and the direction by Ken Kwapis, who made the better DUNSTON 
CHECKS IN (who would have ever thought I might use the word "better" to 
describe that film?), does justice to the screenplay's pedestrian 
nature.</P>
<P>     As a vehicle for Fran Drescher, THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST fails 
to highlight her supposedly luminous personality.  Her Joy is 
consistently abrasive, although I suppose that's supposed to be part of 
Drescher's dubious "charm."  Timothy Dalton is out of place and looks 
it.  Right now, he must be wondering what Pierce Brosnan has that he 
doesn't.  Lisa Jakub (who bears a striking resemblance to a young Irene 
Jacob), last seen as a virtual walk-on in INDEPENDENCE DAY, gets the 
thankless role of the daughter-in-love-with-a-rebel.  Ian McNeice is the 
comic foil and Patrick Malahide is the dictator's evil Prime Minister.</P>
<P>     There are ways to get through the film, such as analyzing 
continuity errors (watch the moving foam on McNeice's face and clothing 
after he gets sprayed), checking how often the various actors' accents 
slip, and wondering how much Blockbuster Video paid for an outrageous 
product placement.  Somehow, however, I don't imagine that's how the 
film makers envisioned us spending the movie's running length.  
Unfortunately, it's about the only reasonable alternative to getting up 
and walking out.</P>
