<P>1.Why I Saw This Movie. The able and smart main film-critic of this 
country's best newspaper, unlike many other reviewers, is especially 
kind to movies. Yet this person's write-up on The Story of Us was so 
unusually scathing that it piqued my curiosity.</P>
<P>2. Whom I Saw It With.  A substantial audience. They seemed to like 
it, laughed often. I did too, but much less.</P>
<P>3. What Does The Film Remind Me Of. The same director's When Harry 
Met Sally (1989) --in reverse. Call it When Ben and Katie Separated 
After 15 Years of Marriage and Two Kids. But this wouldn't fit the 
marquee.</P>
<P>4. What I Learned About Bruce Willis. He is left-handed, bald and 
uses terrible hairpieces. He plays a writer, but I didn't figure out 
precisely what he writes. More importantly, he can not only do action 
flicks but he can also act.</P>
<P>5. What I Found Out About Michelle Pfeiffer. She is 42, lovely as 
ever, still at the very top of the list of appealing stars. Her eyes 
continue to fascinate me by their beauty and the oddity than they are 
always ever so slightly bloodshot. This reinforces their power to 
suggest sorrow.  Here Pfeiffer is a professional crossword-puzzle 
editor, undoubtedly a most instructive job.</P>
<P>6. How Her  Profession Is Worked Into The Movie. Just a little. On 
the other hand, as a working Mom she has a normally frantic life.</P>
<P>7. What  Genre The Film Belongs To.  The romantic comedy. (You know 
even before you get your ticket that there will be a happy ending. It 
takes the form of a long speech by Pfeiffer, is phony , and too 
artificially emotional for the usually cool Michelle). The real 
sub-genre is Comedies of Remarriage. Couples split for whatever 
reason but get back together. Some great old movies in this group are 
My Girl Friday, My Favorite Wife, the Hitchcock rarity (not a 
thriller) Mr and Mrs Smith.</P>
<P>The couple hide their ever-increasing differences, gripes and other 
Bad Things from their teen-age children so as not to upset them. 
Which is ridiculous as the presumably intelligent kids ought (but 
have not?) seen or sensed their parents' problems. The separation 
starts after the parents have taken the children to summer camp. 
Willis moves to an hotel, then an apartment.  Pfeiffer enters, by 
chance, into a relationship with a divorced family acquaintance. 
Honor is Safe. Supposedly nothing happenes between this new  twosome, 
beyond cooking beautiful Thai food together. Come on!</P>
<P>A familiar yet realistic touch. When the man finds out that the 
couple has split up, he expresses his strong sorrow then makes an 
immediate pass. But other sections are over the top: a sequence of 
Willis and a close friend (played by director Rob Reiner) 
philosophizing about couples is forced;  a sequence where Willis, 
Reiner and the latter's wife (Rita Wilson) go to a posh restaurant 
and Willis starts shouting out his problems is ham-fisted; a scene 
where Willis tells pal Dave (Paul Reiser, unusually sufferable) that 
he wants to write a book about his (Willis's) grandmother is gauchely 
worked into the story.</P>
<P>The story is related in bits, with a profusion of flashbacks, 
flashforwards, flashsideways, and with the spouses addressing 
directly the camera. One of the flahsbacks, a trip to romantic Venice 
(in Italy, not California) in order to rekindle the old passion and 
make them an "us" again, is rather amusing Especially when they meet 
an older couple of obnoxious, loud and jocular tourists from 
Cleveland. But the return home is artificially made into an instant 
fight. There are, too, three flashbacks to shrinks/marriage 
counselors, all three forced.</P>
<P>The flick travels in time non-stop. It uses sitcom humor with 
sitcom-ish fragmented action, the only difference being the 
uncensored language. There is brio, albeit overdone, in a raucous 
restaurant sequence in which Pfeiffer and her best friends Julie 
Hagerty and Rita Wilson discuss husbands and sex. This is 
mechanically paralleled (though also lively ) in a restaurant meeting 
of Willis, Reiser and Reiner who discuss  wives and women. Both have 
some humor, plus a lot of four-letter and sexual anatomy descriptions 
by Rita Wilson.</P>
<P>If all this sounds like a sloppy script, it is. Curiously, however, 
the picture does not feel irritating, dull or overlong -- at least 
not until about minute 80 (out of 92).</P>
