<PRE>`HENRY FOOL' (1998)
DIR/WTR/COMP: HAL HARTLEY
CINEMATOGRAPHY: MICHAEL SPILLER
STARS: JAMES URBANIAK, THOMAS JAY RYAN,
PARKER POSEY, and MARIA POTTER.
SONY PICTURES CLASSICS</PRE>
<P>    The film begins with a dizzying introduction into the life of
Queens garbage man Simon Grim.  James Urbaniak (Simon) gives a
controlled but captivating performance, his eyes and lanky body
creating Simon as a link between Sam Beckett and Marlon Brando. The
sight of ex-con Henry Fool marching down the street signals the end of
this quiet, unremarkable life.  Thomas Jay Ryan (Henry) is rowdy,
crude, and becomes surprisingly sympathetic in his Mephistophelean
role.</P>
<P>    Henry first finds Simon placing an ear to the ground, as if
listening for the approaching steps of fate. `Get up off your
knees.' -- Henry commands as he swiftly moves himself into the Grim
family basement and into the lives of Simon's sex-dependant sister
(Parker Posey), and morbidly depressed mother (Maria Potter). Henry
claims to be finishing his ‘Confessions', which he is convinced
will provoke and thrill the literary establishment. He offers a spare
notebook to the monosyllabic Simon, telling him to stop and write down
what he can't seem to express in conversation. When Simon's book
length poem becomes infamous almost overnight, Henry and his
unaccomplished ‘Confessions' are left in the shadows.</P>
<P>    The second half of the film concentrates mainly on Henry; Hartley
opens things up to breathe, after focusing almost claustrophobically
on Simon's evolution from garbage man to controversial poet. Henry
is faced with personal failure, and a looming obligation as someone so
aware of life, society, and his surroundings.  While the story is
admittedly modeled on Faust, both men proceed to their private heavens
and hells guided by trouble and desire.</P>
<P>     Like the films of Robert Bresson, or J.L. Godard, emotion and
human relation are heavily dealt with, although not thoroughly
expressed thru any individual source, but as a constructed whole. The
film can be seen as a modern fable, a performance art piece. Each
frame is so carefully designed and controlled, it's undeniable this
story could only be told in film. The ‘World of Doughnuts' which
Henry & Simon frequent is photographed uniquely for each scene,
creating a totally ordinary, yet nearly undefinable space. Like
Godard, Hartley's films can be taken as film-criticism. Almost in
antithesis to films like Armageddon, takes are long and
static. Characters interact in abstract but never embellished
dialogue. The screen comes alive with stylized, almost modern dance
choreography equal to his earlier `Flirt'.</P>
<P>    Is it a good movie? Yes. There's enough scatological humor and
mediation on creativity and morality to touch most segments of the
audience, although some might find the 2-hour plus running time
excessive, or the style too ironic and detached. Surprisingly its
Hartley's largest, most accessible, and complex film to
date. It's a fantastic accomplishment for him and will easily be
one of the best films of the year.</P>
