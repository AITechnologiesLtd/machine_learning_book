<P>   There may be quite a few reasons that some people turn out to
be Mother Theresa types, or at least do-gooders who think more
of the happiness of others than they do of their own felicity.  Jean-
Pierre Jeunet, who directs Amelie from his own script which is co-
written by Guillaume Laurant, posits one theory that I think we call
agree with.  People who are outsiders, those who never seem to
be accepted by others and who are therefore shy and introverted,
may identify with those who share that condition, or at least that's
the condition of the title character of Jeunet's latest movie.  </P>
<P>   Jeunet, who is nothing if not a stylist, is responsible for such
independent fare as "Delicatessen" (about a landlord who dices
human beings into cutlets for non-vegetarian tenants) and, four
years later, "The City of Lost Children" (about a scientist unable to
dream who invades the dreams of children).  Unfortunately
"Amelie" is in no way as meaty as the former work or provocative
as the latter.  While the Jeunet style is present in virtually every
scene--the sumptuous visuals and painstaking invention--"Amelie"
centers on a character who soon becomes irritating and the
picture itself if afflicted with so  many film-school excess that it
overstays its welcome long before its absurdly long two-hour
tenure.  Jeunet could be on the downward spiral that began with
his clumsy, illogical "Alient Resurrection" which wasted Sigourney
Weaver in the starring role.</P>
<P>   The central figure of Amelie (Audrey Tautou), who affects an
Audrey Hepburn demeanor, is thought by her father (Rufus) to
have a weak heart, a diagnosis that could have been made even
in the U.S. today by the typical HMO physician.  The faulty
reading on the stethoscope is caused by her excitement at being
touched by her father as a little girl in this once-a-month
examination ritual: her dad is undemonstrative and denies his
daughter the kind of normal contact on which every little girl
thrives.  Her neurotic mother, who has educated her at home,
commits suicide.  Amelie becomes an unhappy loner indeed,
giving her a particular sympathy for those who, in her eyes, share
her torment.  Those people include an artist who paints the same
Renoir "Luncheon of the Boating Party" over and over, the son of
a greengrocer who is verbally abused by his dad who publicly
denouncing him as retarded (simply because he treats every
eggplant with love), and a handsome man, Nino Quicampoix
(Mathieu Kassovitz) who collects pictures from a Coney-Island
style photo booth.  </P>
<P>   She does her best to serve as matchmaker for a chap who
hangs out daily at a cafe, a man who has been rejected and sits
around spying on his lost love.  She helps a blind man across the
street, describing in detail what activities are in progress.  </P>
<P>   Audrey Tautou is, I suppose, ideally cast for what comes across
as a fable, filled with magic realism.  Her eyes focus like those of
Kliban's cats, her hair is short, giving her a perky look, and Bruno
Delbonnel's camera lets us see the eccentric Parisians as Amelie
herself perceives them.  "Amelie" is filled to the brim with too
many people and therefore too many stories, to be embraced by a
single motion picture. The result is a hodgepodge which depends
too much on techique, on style over substance, to make for an
engrossing comedy.</P>
