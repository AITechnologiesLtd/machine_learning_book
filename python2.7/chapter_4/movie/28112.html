<PRE>                        THE DAY I BECAME A WOMAN
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>A movie called The Day I Became a Woman can only be about one of two
things.  Either it's going to star a young girl who is coming of age or
a guy who's getting a sex change operation.</P>
<P>Surprise, on this Day we get three (genuine) women all going through
various life experiences.  They can be nearly meaningless -- a nine year
old girl is given one hour to play on the morning of her birthday.  They
can mean the end of life as you know it -- a married woman is verbally
divorced by her husband when she refuses to stop riding her beloved
bicycle.  And they can be perplexingly final -- a very old lady spends
her life savings on all new appliances, sets them up on a beach, and
then puts them all on rafts as she sets sail for a boat that doesn't
exist.</P>
<P>Needless to say, we don't normally see stuff like this coming out of
Hollywood; The Day I Became a Woman is an Iranian film directed by
Marzieh Meshkini, 74 slight minutes told in three miniscule vignettes.</P>
<P>Now, most of us (myself included) typically stow the phrases "Iranian
cinema" and "rollicking good time" in totally different parts of our
brains.  Personally, the plodding pace and overblown self-importance of
Middle Eastern films (see also A Time for Drunken Horses) typically numb
me into a depressed coma.  But The Day I Became a Woman stands out as a
reasonably intriguing film -- enlightening us about the life of the
modern Iranian while not pretending to be so significant that the very
earth will shake thanks to its creation.  Along with A Taste of Cherry,
another recent Iranian import, there appears to be some filmic promise
coming out of this war-torn country after all.  Not that Michael Bay has
anything to worry about.</P>
