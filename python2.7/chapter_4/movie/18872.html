<P>I've seen a lot of bad movies before but never one this boring.  Bill Paxton is
pretty good as a tornado expert and some of the jokes are pretty funny but yet
this movie still sucks.  At the beginning of the movie, we are told that the
characters have four chances to get dorothy into the tornado.  How many times
does it take them?  Four chances.  Also at the beginning, the good guys are
supplied with a competitor.  What happens to them?  They get sucked up by a
Tornado instantly.  What was the point of the bad guys?  To show us the dangers
of a tornado?  Most of us have already seen tornado footage and know the
danger.  Or perhaps it was simply a showcase for the special effects?  We are
shown the tornado plenty of times.  Each time is dramactically less and less
interesting.  </P>
<P>I think that's the problem with disaster movies.  The directors never seem to
provide the volcano, tornado, asteroid, or whatever with any character.  If the
theme of disaster movies is man vs. nature why not give us more from the
nature's side.  The writer seems to be content with the characters studying it
electronically which is quite boring for the audience.  And what of the Helen
Hunt/Bill Paxton love subplot?  Dull and uninteresting.  This is a pretty
formulaic movie so we know they'll end up together.  Another problem with
disaster movies is that there's no suprise ending.  At least with a boring
drama movie there's hope for a suprise ending to make amends.</P>
<P>The movie also provides us with another supblot involving Helen Hunt facing the
Tornado.  Which she does about four times.  Even though the last one is pretty
strong.  Who cares?  They all look the same to me.</P>
<P>During this movie, I learned nothing about what a twister was.  Only about how
much a movie about a twister could suck.  </P>
