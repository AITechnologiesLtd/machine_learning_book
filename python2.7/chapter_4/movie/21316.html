<P>IN A SAVAGE LAND (M).  
(Beyond Films/Universal)
Director: Bill Bennett
Stars: Rufus Sewell, Martin Donovan, Maya Stange, Max Cullen, John 
Howard, Andrew S Gilbert, Susan Lyons, Marshall Napier
Running time: 106 minutes.</P>
<P>Just before the outbreak of World War Two, a pair of newly wed
anthropologists venture to the Trobriand Islands off New Guinea to
study the sexual habits and rituals of the local tribesmen.  However,
their experiences soon expose the cracks in their unsatisfactory
relationship, and tension grows between the pair that affects their
work.</P>
<P>Phillip Spence (an unusually lethargic and insipid Martin
Donovan) is a renowned anthropologist and teacher looking forward to
the challenge of studying the sexual mores of a tribe largely
untouched by the twentieth century.  His wife Evelyn (newcomer Maya
Stange) is a former student and idealist with outspoken views on the
direction that their research should take.  Far from being a demure
assistant and typist, Evelyn takes to pursuing her own research, which
upsets Phillip.  Evelyn also manages to offend both the stuffy
colonial administrator (a tired Max Cullen) and a pompous priest (Sea
Change's John Howard) determined to bring Christianity and
civilisation to the savages.  As the tension between her and her
husband increases, Evelyn is attracted to Carpenter (Rufus Sewell),
the ruggedly handsome, roguish pearl fisherman and trader.</P>
<P>In her first major film appearance, Stange delivers a solid
performance in a quite complex and emotionally demanding role, and she
carries the film.  Sewell and Donovan are far less impressive in
clichéd roles.</P>
<P>Writer/director Bill Bennett has tackled some ambitious themes
here - changing sexual roles in the 20th century, the clash of
cultures, western imperialism and the destruction of so-called
primitive societies - but he is let down by the somewhat clichéd
and melodramatic narrative.  In A Savage Land is based on a true
story, but Bennett and his co-writer Jennifer Bennett have opted for
some soft options and familiar stereotypes rather than more hard
hitting stuff.</P>
<P>Production values are solid, with plenty of attention paid to
accuracy concerning period detail and costumes.  Bennett spent some
two years researching the film and studying the Trobriand Islands, and
has captured some of the tribal rituals in detail.  He has undertaken
the difficult task of filming in the inhospitable wilds of New Guinea
itself rather than in a more friendly environment, but his decision
has added authenticity to the dramatic locations.  Cinematographer
Danny Ruhlmann, a former director of high profile commercials, uses
the wide screen to great effect here, creating some vivid and
memorable images that leave more of a lasting impression than the
sometimes routine drama itself.</P>
<P>In A Savage Land is almost a conventional film, and lacks the
assured cinematic style and energy that Bennett brought to the screen
with his stylish, award winning thriller Kiss Or Kill.  The pace is
occasionally plodding, and the film lacks any real sense of passion
and emotional depth.</P>
