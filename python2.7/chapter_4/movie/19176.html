<PRE>                             A SIMPLE PLAN
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1999 Timothy Voon
                      2 out of 5 for a greedy plan</PRE>
<P>Cast:  Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Bridget Fonda, Brent Briscoe,
Gary Cole.
Screenplay:  Scott B. Smith, based on his novel.
Producers:  James Jacks and Adam Schroeder.
Director:  Sam Raimi.</P>
<P>This is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and
getting away with the cash. This is more about a parable of greed, and
how money can become the bane of your life. Yes, there are elements of
‘Fargo' here (the snow and cold), although not as vivid in the blood and
gore department. It shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading
to death and the destruction of lives. And how at the end of the day,
the things that matter most are love, truth and honesty.</P>
<P>Although in one sense it may seem tedious, making a movie about the
ugliness of greed (not box office material), it does become tedious, not
because of the morale ending, but because one expects the movie to end
that way. This becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the
crime, the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there. The
characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk,
brothers and friends, who all fall prey to the avarice of money. They
should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible, level headed and not
affected by greed to give the party more balance.</P>
<P>Commendable is the exceptional performance of Billy Bob Thornton, whose
portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful. Bill Paxton also gives
a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother, whilst Bridget
Fonda is convincing as the greediest wife, who indirectly causes the
most problems. Fill a room full of greedy people and several million
dollars, and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath. It's
not a simple plan, when you shoot everyone you love for money, unless
you're the Menendez brothers.</P>
