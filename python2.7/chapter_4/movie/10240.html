<PRE>Scream 2   *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>DIRECTED BY
Wes Cravens</PRE>
<P>Starring
Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie
Kennedy, Laurie Metcalf, Jerry O'Connell</P>
<P>We're not breaking new ground here, folks. </P>
<P>If you liked the original Scream, you'll enjoy the sequel. But it is still
a sequel. The joy of discovery (as with the original Scream, which was the
first good slasher pic in more than 10 years) is gone.</P>
<P>Everyone who survived the first Scream (yes, I'm going to spoil the
original's plot;  if you haven't seen it by now, tough noogies) is back --
plucky Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now a college freshman, majoring
in theater. Randy (Jamie Kennedy), the kid who knew all the horror
cliches, is at the same college, majoring in film. Deputy Dewey (David
Arquette), crippled by his injuries, is no longer a cop;  Gale Weathers
(Courteney Cox) is still a sleazy journalist, and has written a book about
the Woodsboro murders of the first film.</P>
<P>As Scream 2 opens, the movie of Weathers' book on the murders from the
first film (stay with me here) is opening. Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps play
an unlucky young couple who attend the premiere of Stab, as the
movie-in-a-movie is called. </P>
<P>The movie-in-a-movie stuff is a real hoot. Sydney's worst fear is realized
-- in Stab, she's portrayed by Tori Spelling. If you've seen Scream, the
movie-in-a-movie will seem very strange ... I kept thinking "No, that's
not how it really happened! I was there, I know!" This must be the way
Joey Buttafuoco felt when he watched the three TV movies about him and Amy
Fisher.</P>
<P>After this very promising beginning, Scream 2 becomes a pretty damned good
slasher-pic sequel. The characters have fun with the sequel cliches
(though not as much as in the original). Many people are killed. There are
some neat, nightmarish sequences, such as Sydney's rehearsal of
"Agamemnon," in which she plays Cassandra.</P>
<P>The movie cheats at the end; any good whodunit (which is, in essence, what
both Scream flicks are) should give subtle clues to the killer's identity.
When he or she is finally revealed, the audience should think, "Of course!
I should've known!"</P>
<P>Not here. The killer's identity came totally out of left field. All right,
as one character in Scream said, "It's the millennium, motives are
incidental."  But I don't think it's too much to ask that the perp have
some reason for doing what he or she does.</P>
<P>All criticism aside, Scream 2 is an entertaining movie. Fans of the first
are unlikely to be disappointed. </P>
<P>Scream 3, apparently, is in the works. Wes Craven says he planned the
movies as a trilogy all along. I'm skeptical, but maybe he'll break new
ground with the third installment. We'll see. </P>
