<P>I'd sort of given up on Woody Allen after the majority of his work during
the 90s appeared to be more about getting "name actors" into his films, then
making original and quality productions (save for HUSBANDS AND WIVES and
BULLETS OVER BROADWAY). But don't look now cause the Woodman has returned to
his roots with an all-out slapstick featuring only one "big" name (Hugh
Grant) but plenty of funny one-liners!</P>
<P>PLOT:
A down-and-out dishwasher with a dubious past, comes up with a plan to clean
out a bank's vault with the aid of a few of his dim-witted buddies, and some
financing help from his gaudy wife. As a successful couple, the husband and
wife must then figure out how they are going to "fit in" with all the other
rich and cultured socialites.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Welcome back, Woodrow! An easy predictable plot with funny, neurotic
characters and plenty of hilarious one-liners certify this film as one of
Woody's most accessible and entertaining of the past decade. Of course, it
helps if you are already a huge Woody Allen fan (which I am), but Dreamworks
knew something when they picked up this film, cause it is certainly does
pack many a guffaw, and is easily one of the more mainstream films of
Allen's career. Yes, fans of BANANAS and TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN won't be
disappointed, but I think most anyone looking for a few simple laughs laced
within a fast-paced and clever script will most likely enjoy this picture.
In fact, it is the film's first hour which probably holds the most bang for
your buck, with many audience members breaking out in large fits of
laughter. The second half slows the chuckles down a little, but even then,
enough smiles are provided to allow one to ease further into the film's
hokey plot.</P>
<P>Of course, there isn't much originality to the overall story, most of which
can be foreseen as the film moves along, but the characters are fun to
watch, Woody is his typical stuttering goofy self and the feel-good ending
will most likely satisfy the majority. I thought the conclusion was a little
too corny for my taste, but then again, I'm a jaded ol' critic, I am : ) One
thing to note is that the trailers make it seem like the film is all about
the bank robbery, when really it actually takes off from that premise pretty
early on. In fact, the three dum-dums who help Woody with the heist more or
less disappear about halfway through the film, as Hugh Grant enters the
picture. The standout in the cast would have to be Elaine May as the
not-too-bright cousin in the bunch, and Tracey Ullman, who nails her role to
perfection. It's also interesting to note that Michael Rapaport has finally
given up on his career as an actor, and affectionately embraced the odd
choice for a profession, playing the "doofus" in every other movie.</P>
<P>All in all, the film has plenty of laughs, delivers Woody firmly tucked back
in his humor saddle, and presents a story interesting enough, albeit
predictable, to satisfy all Allen fans, and even some of the rest of ya'll.</P>
