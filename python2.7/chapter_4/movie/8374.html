<PRE>                         HEAVEN'S PRISONERS 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Alec Baldwin, Mary Stuart Masterson, Kelly Lynch, Teri Hatcher,
Eric Roberts, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Samantha Lagpacan Director: Phil
Joanou Screenplay: Harley Peyton and Scott Frank based on the novel by
James Lee Burke</P>
<P>Does anybody know why this movie is called Heaven's Prisoners? The only
connection I can make is the fact that the wife gets shot and maybe goes
to Heaven. Have I missed an important point somewhere in this movie? Or
is 'Heaven' the name of the place where they live?</P>
<P>I had great difficulty understanding this complex (=confusing) movie
about a plane crash; a rescued 'please adopt me because I'm so cute'
Spanish girl; a flask carrying, smooth talking, 'sleep with me' tattooed
vixen; a lonely-hearts, 'love me or leave me' stripper; a 'kill me in
the first fifteen minutes', bullet-riddled wife; a 'have you been
sleeping with my wife - I'm going to punch you anyway' childhood friend;
some angry drug dealers and a vengeful ex-dick?</P>
<P>This movie based on a novel written by James Lee Burke, feels as though
the director has decided to randomly rip pages from the book, before
pasting it's remains to create a movie. I have never felt this
disjointed or confused about anything, except for the time I dislocated
my shoulder playing basketball, then lapsed into temporary bliss when
the pethidine kicked in.</P>
<P>The cast is no better. Kelly Lynch is terminated before she can
demonstrate any signs of emotion. Terri Hatcher gets to pout and show
all of her emotions from A to C, and unfortunately isn't disposed of
sooner. Mary Stuart Masterson who normally plays the 'girl next door',
is wasted as a stripper who never shows her wares; and Eric Roberts
'Bubba', looks like he's just attended Whoopi Goldberg's school on hair
braiding skills. The only person with any admirable talent is Baldwin
who plays the tortured, emotionally wrecked husband much better than he
does the vengeful ex-detective. Here take a tissue Alec you deserve it.</P>
<P>There's also a plentiful supply of sultry, sassy, southerners with great
slurring accents. Who don't walk, but strut; don't perspire but sweat.
Who settle misunderstandings the old fashioned way (with fists). Where
strippers are known synonymously as whores, and unfaithful wives are
executed by trigger happy husbands; and it's called 'Heaven's
Prisoners'???</P>
<P>Comment: How about 'Straight To Hell. Don't Collect $200, and Don't Pass
Go'?</P>
<P>Monopoly (British Version) Feel scale:
0% *OLD KENT* / Trafalgar Square / Mayfair 100%</P>
