<PRE>                                PULP FICTION
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman,
           Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Harvey Keitel.
Screenplay/Director:  Quentin Tarantino.</P>
<P>     According to all evidence, PULP FICTION is going to be one of
those movies that turns people into incarnations of Beavis and
Butthead; either it "sucks" or it "kicks ass," apparently with no
tenable middle ground.  This of course is the natural course of things
for films as unique as PULP FICTION.  The same thing happened with
NATURAL BORN KILLERS already this year, as proponents and detractors
exchanged ad hominem volleys.  Quentin Tarantino's stunning sophomore
effort deserves better.  It is the kind of film, imperfect though it
may be, which should inspire discussion about how exciting the medium
can be.  There are more moments in this one film which awed me to
silence than in every other 1994 release combined, and while its faults
may not allow it to stand as the year's best film, it's certainly
close.</P>
<P>     PULP FICTION is divided into segments telling interlocking tales
about a group of shady characters.  Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and
Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are enforcers for crime boss
Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames).  Vincent is asked by Marsellus to take
care of his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) while he is out of town, leading to
an adventurous night out.  Marsellus, meanwhile, is arranging for boxer
Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to throw a fight, which Butch doesn't do
when he figures he can clean up by winning.  Then, in an
out-of-sequence flashback, Vincent and Jules deal with an inadvertent
killing, and a pair of madly in love robbers (Tim Roth and Amanda
Plummer) in a diner.</P>
<P>     This is what must be said about PULP FICTION: few films in the
last fifteen years have left me so charged with the pure gonzo thrill
of movie-making.  Has there been a more erotically charged conversation
than that between Vincent and Mia at a gaudy 50's-style burger joint?
Has the flushing of a toilet ever caused such a combination of laughter
and suspense.  And has any scene caused an entire audience to squirm
quite so violently as a spectacular moment involving an overdose victim
and a six inch hypodermic needle?  Quentin Tarantino refuses to let any
moment just sit there; relationships between characters crackle with
intensity, and darkly comic punch lines are spit out like bullets.  I
left PULP FICTION feeling as though I had not simply watched a movie,
but *experienced* one.  I was exhausted.</P>
<P>     However, it would be a mistake to suggest that there is nothing to
PULP FICTION but its visceral impact.  Tarantino does not place his
characters in a universe of amoral anarchy; as RESERVOIR DOGS first
indicated, he is fascinated with loyalty and moments of improbable
selflessness.  Two such moments provide the moral backbone of PULP
FICTION.  In one, Bruce Willis' Butch makes a decision which could cost
him his life--even if he is successful--all to save another human being
from torture.  In the other, Samuel L. Jackson's Jules undergoes a sort
of conversion, and in the course of explaining his actions gives one of
the most stunning speeches in recent memory.  Both are showcases for
career performances.  Willis is better than his previous work had ever
so much as hinted at, while Jackson delivers what is quite simply the
best performance in an American film this year.  It is at these moments
when PULP FICTION, for all its frantic energy, reveals its real
message:  even in a world this violent, salvation is possible.</P>
<P>     The only real problem with PULP FICTION is a significant lag
between the marvelous middle segment and Jackson's tour-de-force
monologue.  It consists of the appearance of a low-key fixer named
Winston Wolf (Harvey Keitel) who helps Vincent and Jules clean up after
their car gets unexpectedly messy, and it never really develops the
momentum that the Travolta/Thurman and Willis/Rhames segments do.  But
Tarantino brackets that lull with such sheer cinematic glory, that the
sour taste doesn't linger.  PULP FICTION is violent, profane and filled
with addicts, racists and killers.  At the same time, it may be one of
the most moral stories the big screen has seen in years.  That
Tarantino was able to pull off that little maneuver says as much about
his talent as a dozen Palmes d'Or.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Palmes d'Or:  9.</PRE>
