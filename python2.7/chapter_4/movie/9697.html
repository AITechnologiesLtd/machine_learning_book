Mortal Thoughts (1991)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 80</PRE>
<P>"Mortal Thoughts" is an excellent crime drama.  It is also an
unhappy and tense film.</P>
<P>"Mortal Thoughts" stars Demi Moore and Glenne Headly as two
lifetime friends who together end up murdering Bruce Willis,
Headly's reel-life and Moore's real-life husband.  They
try to cover up their crime, but are all too aware that
they are unlikely to get away with it.</P>
<P>One can argue that Willis has it coming.  He is one of
filmdom's worst husbands.  He is drug-using, abusive,
sponging, and obnoxious.  He also makes unwanted passes at 
Moore without taking no for an answer.  Clearly, Willis 
relishes the role.</P>
<P>The story is told mostly in flashbacks.  At the start of
the film, Moore is under police interrogation by Harvey Keitel.
As she gets into increasing trouble attempting to explain
her actions, flashbacks take her back to the scenes she
is describing.  This technique has been used in other crime
dramas, such as "Double Indemnity (1944)."  There is also
a plot twist or two, which is almost mandatory for the genre.</P>
<P>Director Alan Rudolph does fine work.  He does has a 
fascination with slow-motion, particularly when the camera 
is focusing on Moore.</P>
<P>"Mortal Thoughts" sags a bit in the middle.  This may be
because we lose all sympathy for Moore and Headly's 
characters, who are both guilty of various serious crimes.</P>
<P>"Mortal Thoughts" has violent scenes.  Other scenes have
large amounts of blood everywhere, so it is not for
children or the squeamish.  One question that has to be
asked: Is the violence and blood necessary?  I think it
is, in this case, because it gets across the point that
it is a terrible crime to murder someone.  Murder is not
glorified in this film.</P>
<P>"Mortal Thoughts" has not received the attention or
aclaim that it deserves.  I hope that this is not due
to the presence of Moore and Willis, who may have made
other poor career decisions, but are well-cast here.</P>
