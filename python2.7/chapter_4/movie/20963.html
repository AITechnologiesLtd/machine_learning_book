<P>Take Chinatown as the archetypical detective movie. In it a private
investigator has to reconstruct some crime bit by bit. And the crime of
course happened before the movie started. And everyone tries to steer him
off the case. And it all gets real personal real fast, to the point where
the detective's need to know is held in balance against his need to live.
These conventional developments we expect from a hard-boiled detective
movie. What we don't expect them from so much, though, is horror, which is
part of the appeal of director David Koepp's Stir of Echoes (based on
Richard Matheson's book)--that, although it has dead people walking the
halls, is nevertheless structured after the traditional detective movie,
even down to the opening, where Tom Witzky (Kevin
Bacon)--private-investigator-like--is minding his own business, just trying
to scratch out a decent living, when a 'strange woman' enters and turns his
world inside-out.
Or, specifically, via an overextended Big Lebowski-ish hypnosis session, she
accidentally flips a switch in his psyche, which transforms him into a
'receiver,' which translates into the ability to see dead people walking
around, to catch glimpses of the past, the future, all that. But of course
Witzky never quite sees it all in detail (qua Blink), which is tantalizing
enough to compel him to reconstruct bit by bit whatever 'crime' occurred
before the movie opened. Think Poltergeist; it's the same story with a
tighter cast and better music (or, it's 1996's Spectre with good direction).
And his 'investigation' unfolds conventionally, with all the appropriate
setbacks, distractions, isolations, etc. He even gets some help from his son
(Zachary David Cope), who's a 'natural' receiver, not unlike Haley Joel
Osment from Sixth Sense, though Zachary David Cope is no Haley Joel Osment.
Where Stir of Echoes breaks from the traditional detective movie set-up is
that the 'detective' here actually has a home life--nominally pregnant wife
and prescient son--which serves to heighten what's at stake for him here.
And it is effective in that regard, though at times the rounds of marital
conflict and reconciliation seem a bit forced, more dramatically necessary
than developmentally. This home-life, however, does give Witzky room to
complain that his life is too 'ordinary,' which, in a horror-movie, is
another way of asking for it. Soon enough everything's all but ordinary, and
Witzky only wants to close the Doors of Perception which Jim Morrison wanted
open so badly in The Doors.
And it's easy to understand why he wants them closed: the undead he can see
now are easily the summer's scariest, even moreso than Sixth Sense's, this
due largely to how Koepp renders undead movement--both fast and contained,
as in Jakob's Ladder, which is for some reason primally disturbing. Which is
of course exactly what we pay for--to be scared. In that sense, Stir of
Echoes satisfies, and then some. However. For a while, when the external
pressure Witzky's facing is at low ebb, Stir of Echoes tries to maintain the
tension via the undead doing all the typical haunting things--turning out
lights, standing around every corner, etc, which doesn't fit with how the
undead in the reality of Stir of Echoes are 'supposed' to act. But oh well.
It happens in Romero too, whom Koepp unsubtly references. Aside from that,
and in spite of an ill-advised (see: non-catchy) title, Stir of Echoes is
high-caliber horror, the kind that stays with you a little longer than you
really want it to.
