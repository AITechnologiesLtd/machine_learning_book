<PRE>                           SHADOW OF A DOUBT
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     "It's not good to know too much about someone, Charlie," Charles
warns his niece, Charlie (Margaret Welsh), with a devilish grin.
Charlie is infatuated with her namesake uncle, her "soul mate" as she
calls him since her mother gave her his name.</P>
<P>     There's a lot to know about Charles, not the least of which is
that he strangled 3 widows back East.</P>
<P>     Mark Harmon, who looks like anything but a killer but specializes
in playing them, plays Charles, the Merry Widow Murderer in the 1991
Hallmark Hall of Fame remake of the 1943 Hitchcock film, SHADOW OF A
DOUBT.  And to avoid any questions about his guilt, we see Charles in
action in the opening scene with his last victim.</P>
<P>     The story takes place in the early 1950s in the small town of
Petaluma, California, where Charles heads to avoid the police.  John
Gay's script uses most of the original screenplay by Sally Benson, Alma
Reville, and Thornton Wilder.  Karen Arthur's direction is certainly no
match for the great master, but on an absolute scale, the movie
maintains a high level of suspense.</P>
<P>     When supercilious and deceitful Charles comes to pay a visit of
indeterminate length with his sister and her family in Petaluma, they
don't know about his nefarious activities.  He showers them with
elaborate gifts to buy the love they had already given him anyway.</P>
<P>     Two mysterious and exceedingly clean-cut writers for a magazine
show up to take pictures of the family for a spread on the "average
American family," but their interest is focused on Uncle Charles,
especially on taking his picture and learning about his background.
Charlie, who first welcomed her uncle's visit, begins to feel more and
more uncomfortable with him and suspicious of the disingenuous magazine
reporters.</P>
<P>     The picture advances with a delicate power using small details
such as the newspaper article that the uncle tries secretly to remove
and that Charlie discovers.</P>
<P>     The beauty of the story is the pas de deux between uncle and niece
as they try to out psych each other.  She wants him to leave, and he
doesn't want to go, what with a local, rich widow as a prospective
victim.  Will Charles kill Charlie first, or will she get him out of
town.  Harmon is wonderfully creepy and smug, and Welsh is tough but
trapped.</P>
<P>     With a deft touch the director sets up each scene, several with
thunderstorms, and Tom Neuwirth's sepia-toned cinematography makes the
movie feel as if it were filmed in the 50s.  My only quibble is the
director's awkward staging of the final scene on the train.</P>
<P>     Is Hitchcock's version better?  Of course.  Is this one worth
watching as well?  Actually, yes.</P>
<P>     SHADOW OF A DOUBT runs 1:40.  It is not rated but would be PG for
adult themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up.</P>
