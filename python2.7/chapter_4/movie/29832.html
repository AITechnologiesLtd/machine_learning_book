<P>"Mexico? You know I have sanitation issues!"</P>
<P>Starring Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Cate
Blanchett. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Bandits is a fun, uninhibited little comedy, with a
plot that's a red herring for the bizarre wit of its
dialogue. It also offers the rare sight of Billy Bob
Thornton aping Woody Allen, as well as Cate Blanchett
doing physical comedy. How great to see a mainstream
film that revels in writing and little character
moments rather than trying to overwhelm us with
overwrought action and story. Its attempts at "heart"
and any other form of significance are quickly and
cruelly dashed, but there are images here that are so
strange, I won't soon forget them.</P>
<P>The film was directed by Barry Levinson, a remarkably
versatile director who has experimented with nearly
every genre one could imagine and his results have
ranged from abominable to incredible. Here, he's
assembled two great character actors and one great
leading man and sticks them into a plot that
compensates for its conventionality with sublime
ridiculousness. There's also an oddball structure:
Bandits begins with what seems to be the title
characters' last crime, then fast forwards to a
reality crime show where it is announced that the
"Sleepover Bandits" died in a shootout immediately
following it.</P>
<P>The next scene goes back to the beginning, as Joe
(Bruce Willis) and Terry (Billy Bob Thornton) escape
from prison by hijacking a cement truck and driving it
through numerous chain-link fences. After they're sure
that they have lost their pursuers, Joe proceeds to
rob a bank with a magic marker. Later, as they're
stealing new clothes from a random house, Terry comes
up with the perfect bank robbery: do it early in the
morning, with the full cooperation of the bank manager
whom they kidnapped the night before.</P>
<P>Back up. To explain my fascination with this seemingly
formulaic heist flick, I need to describe the
personalities of the two partners-in-crime. Joe is
actually a fairly "regular" (in the Hollywood sense)
criminal: fast-thinking, charming, charismatic and
cocky. But Terry, ooooh boy. He's intelligent and
pragmatic, but his positive qualities are far
outshadowed by his unbelievable neurosis. One of his
phobias is antique furniture, and he doesn't want to
escape to Mexico because of "sanitation issues."</P>
<P>If it seems impossible for Blanchett to somehow wedge
her way into this story, it is, which is why Levinson,
consistent with the tone of the rest of the script,
gives her a completely non sequitur entrance before
actually integrating her with our protagonists. She
plays a neglected housewife who accidentally winds up
tagging along with our sleepover bandits and falls in
love with both of them. I don't think I need to
mention (but I will anyway) that she is the source of
all of their problems.</P>
<P>Certain scenes here are pure comedic gold. The problem
with reviewing the film is that it is impossible to
convey the humor, or even the spirit, of those scenes
in words. Suffice it to say that while little here
would be funny if taken out of context, seeing
Blanchett's character try to scare Terry out of a
sneezing fit is one of the funniest things I have seen
in a long time.</P>
<P>It's strange, at first, to see the A-list stars and
director devote their time to what is doubtlessly an
exercise in frivolity. Lately it becomes clear: rarely
has so much talent been dedicated to writing such
frivolity. Bandits is absurd, rambling, and very, very
funny. </P>
