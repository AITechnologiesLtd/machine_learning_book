<PRE>                               ENTRAPMENT
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     It's tough to say what ENTRAPMENT will be remembered better for:
Sean Connery's hairpiece, or Catherine Zeta-Jones's ass.  I pick the
ass, and the way it's featured in the trailers for ENTRAPMENT, I'd say
the producers do too.</P>
<P>     If only the rest of the movie was so interesting.  While the idea
is pretty cool: a cop and an art thief tangle in a cat and mouse game,
constantly switching sides, all on the eve of the millenium... it's the
execution that gets 'em every time.</P>
<P>     Connery's the thief, and he does fine work.  Zeta-Jones is the
cop.  Well, she's not a cop.  She's an, um, well, how do I put it? 
She's an *insurance agent*--although unlike any I've ever encountered...
not by a long shot.  And when Connery steals a valuable Rembrandt, does
insurance boss Will Patton send in the feds to catch him?  No!  He sends
Z-J.  Why not?</P>
<P>     Well, most of ENTRAPMENT plays out in head-scratching "Huh? Why?
Eh?" moments like these.  Like how do you "download" money off of a
mainframe?  Why doesn't Connery have locks on the doors to his castle? 
Can you just check valuable art in your baggage?  Why would you leave
DNA evidence (on gum) at the scene of the crime?  And wow do you get
away with the crime if they know exactly who you are?  And why does an
insurance agent get to carry a gun?</P>
<P>     There are no answers to these little riddles... but it's really
moments like Zeta-Jones playing gymnast through "invisible laser beams"
and the constant "disappearing behind a moving train" maneuvers that
really had 'em rolling in the aisles in our screening.</P>
<P>     That's not to say that ENTRAPMENT isn't without its little charms. 
There's exotic locales, clever hi-tech gadgetry, and of course, the
aforementioned ass.  Something to remember when the plot's a distant
memory.</P>
<P>     The presskit claims ENTRAPMENT was sold to Fountainbridge Films
after a Ron Bass pitch only seven lines long.</P>
<PRE>     Sounds about right.</PRE>
