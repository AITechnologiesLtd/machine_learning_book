<PRE>The Mask Of Zorro
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>** (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The old adage "You can't go home again" is often especially true of one's
early childhood havens. Things tend to be smaller, less fascinating and not
quite as profound as memory would indicate.</P>
<P>Perhaps Zorro is one of those youthful memories best left alone. Out of the
several versions of the swashbuckling hero, Disney's Guy Williams was mine.
Hours were happily spent in front of the television watching the hero of old
California make his enemies look like fools. The current film pales in the
_recollection_ of those shows, although probably not compared to the actual
programs themselves.</P>
<P>Based loosely on Johnston McCulley's 1919 magazine serialization which was
brought to the screen a year later, this movie features two Zorros. We are
introduced to the first, Don Diego De La Vega (Anthony Hopkins), in 1812
during his last adventure. The evil governor Don Rafael Montero is ready to
execute innocent men to draw out his arch-foe. Zorro rides in, saves the men,
fights off an army, poses dramatically a number of times and escapes.</P>
<P>But all is not well. Montero discovers his secret identity and invades De La
Vega's home. During the battle, Zorro is captured and his beloved wife killed.
The governor then takes De La Vega's young daughter Elena to raise as his own.</P>
<P>Skip ahead twenty years. Montero returns from Spain with the grown Elena
(Catherine Zeta-Jones) and a plan to buy California from Mexico. Upon hearing
of this, De La Vega, languishing in a squalid prison, escapes. In a tavern he
runs into bandit Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas) who had befriended him
as a child.</P>
<P>Murrieta is seeking revenge against Captain Harrison Love (Matt Letscher) for
causing the death of his brother. Love is Montero's partner in his depraved
plan. The older Zorro takes on this young outlaw and trains him to be the new
masked avenger.</P>
<PRE>And then they fight the bad guys.</PRE>
<P>The film is a return to a simpler lighter adventure reminiscent of "Raiders
Of The Lost Ark". There's no dark brooding Bruce Wayne. It's all played for
action and laughs. The problem is that the action is listless and the laughs, forced.</P>
<P>The sword fighting is mostly filmed in medium shots resulting in a flat
experience. The scenes are formulaic and repetitive. Each fight looks like the
last. Zorro runs to the left and finds a group of soldiers. He runs to the
right and finds a group of soldiers. He runs back to the middle and fights
them all at once. Fifteen minutes later he does it again.</P>
<P>The comedy is played broadly and over and over. The young Zorro's problems
with his horse are slightly humorous the first time. The second and third are
less so.</P>
<P>Hopkins is the highlight of the film. His aging mentor is witty and
appealing. Banderas fares less well, but does what he can with the limited
role. Zeta-Jones certainly has a screen presence. Her sword fight with
Banderas which doubles as foreplay is a joy at least until it goes on too long.</P>
<P>Other viewers might find the recent Zorro dazzling. Me, I think I'll stick
with my memories.</P>
