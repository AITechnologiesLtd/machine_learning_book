<P>Sports movies, with their clearly definable elements of winning and 
losing, lay out a simple blueprint for our emotions. We identify with 
the protagonist, and then cheer when he wins. It's fun, it's easy, and 
anyone can play.</P>
<P>There's all of that in Remember the Titans, a visceral football movie 
based on the true story of the forced integration of an Alexandria, Va. 
High school in 1971. It's a feel-good, feel-bad, feel-good roller 
coaster ride, replete with the familiar signposts of the genre. But it's 
not really about football. It's about race relations, and there are 
plenty of familiar signposts from that route as well. What is 
surprising, then, is what a terrific movie it turns out to be.</P>
<P>How accurate it is we can only guess. But Alexandria's T.C. Williams 
High School was integrated in the fall of 1971, and its popular white 
football coach was replaced with a black man. Coach Yoast (Will Patton) 
agreed to stay on as an assistant under Coach Boone (Denzel Washington), 
a decision which may have been motivated by an understanding that the 
minute Boone stumbled, the Board would kick him out on his unpopular 
black ass. The movie isn't clear whether Yoast is in on this this from 
the start, but it's not far from everyone's mind.</P>
<P>Boone is not a man who requires any such motivation to succeed. He's a 
tough leader who demands perfection from everyone, black and white, with 
the tyranny of a marine drill sergeant. And he understands that a 
football team beset by racial division is a losing football team. So his 
away-from-home preseason camp is devoted to forcing his black and white 
players to accept each other as much as it is to teaching football and 
fitness. A highlight is a brutal predawn run through the woods which 
ends in the early morning mists of the battlefield at Gettysburgh, where 
the coach delivers a moving inspirational speech.</P>
<P>Bonding a bunch of kids with a common goal is one thing. Translating it 
to the community is another. Virginia in the early seventies was a place 
with a deep-seated perspective on the mixing of races; back from camp 
and in the real world, the integrated Titans have to test their 
hard-earned brotherhood in the fires of the bigotry of their families 
and friends.</P>
<P>Success is measured the old-fashioned way, one perfect season at a time. 
One wonders what the effect of a few tough losses would have been on the 
history of integration in Northern Virginia. But this is a movie, and 
there are certain conventions to be followed. I don't mind a movie that 
pushes my buttons if it pushes them well, and this pushes them like E. 
Power Biggs hitting the stops on a church organ.</P>
<P>There's plenty of credit to go around, starting with another commanding 
performance by Washington and a smart, tough assist from Patton and a 
likable cast of young actor/athletes. And it would be a crime not to 
single out young Hayden Panettiere as Yoast's pint-sized, 
football-obsessed daughter. Pulling the strings masterfully are 
screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard and director Boaz Yakin (Fresh). And 
don't forget producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who finally hits after two duds 
this year, a record that would have had him out on his white ass if he'd 
been coaching the Titans.</P>
