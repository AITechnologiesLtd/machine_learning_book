<P>The third season of my favourite television series, 'The X-Files', has an
episode entitled Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space'.  Studying the title for
the first time and making a quick judgment of that episode would lead you to
believe that a man named Jose descends from outer space.  Upon further
review and seeing the episode, we learn that it is actually the title of a
book that he's writing.  So like: Stephen King's 'The Shining', we have Jose
Chung's 'From Outer Space'.  A cleverly written episode of 'The X-Files' by
the series' most bizarre and imaginative individual, Darin Morgan.  The
episode Jose Chung's 'From Outer Space' was about perception and how we
distinguish or how we may not be able to distinguish the real from the
unreal.  A girl was supposedly abducted by aliens but later we learn it may
have been the military using alien technology to distort her perception of
exactly what happened.  Later, Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) meets a
military pilot at a diner who doesn't know if the things around him are real
or a distortion.  The episode even throws in a humourous jab at it all by
portraying a man in black (Jesse Ventura) as a great philosopher who gives a
sermon on how
human perception is not quite understood by Earthly scientists but that
somehow people declare that "Seeing is believing".  What's the point of all
this you ask?  To illustrate that 'The Matrix' is a similar type of story
with a more complex and serious tone that has no humour which in this case
is a bad thing.</P>
<P>Keanu Reeves stars as Thomas Anderson, a computer hacker who works for a
large and influential software company who makes a fortune in side projects
by pirating and selling high tech information.  His cyber name is Neo and
he's recruited by a renegade band of cybernetic crusaders whose leader,
Morpheus, (Laurence Fishburne) believes that Neo is the chosen one.
Morpheus' right hand girl is Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss).  Morpheus tells Neo
that the people of the Earth are slaves and that the world is only a quality
of imagination and that it doesn't really exist.  He explains that people
rely too much on machines in their everyday lives and that today's Earth is
sort of like a virtual reality.  It was created by an outside force designed
to enslave humans.  It's THE MATRIX, but it can't be explained.  It has to
be experienced to be understood.  Morpheus compares the matrix to a dream
where it feels so real but it isn't so, and only those who have the dream
know how it is perceived.  Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who can
break it all up and save mankind and restore a sense of belonging and
happiness that human beings should experience everyday of their lives.  Sort
of like the John Connor character in 'The Terminator' saga who is the chosen
one to save mankind.  You can't have a movie like this without villains
trying to stop you.  They come in the form of artificial intelligence,
dressed in black suits with earpieces for communication, like secret service
agents and wearing dark sunglasses a.k.a. 'Men in Black'.</P>
<P>It's disappointing that I can't quite recommend 'The Matrix' for several
reasons.  Just when the film is getting really cranked  up for a grand
climax, they resort to formula (it was produced by Joel Silver) and the
climax is handled in a giant shoot out where the bad guys can't kill the
good guys no matter how many bullets they have.  It's almost as if a great
script had been written but the authors had writer's block going into the
final stages of its draft.  Maybe there was a different ending in mind.  I
like to think that the creative energy was there but that it was a studio
imposed ending with the ultimate decision on how to resolve things left up
to the suits instead of the artists.</P>
<P>It would be unfair to overlook the film's many virtues such as the
performances.  There is an intellectual and profound style of personality
executed very well by Laurence Fishburne, and Keanu Reeves is almost grown
up in his best performance since 'Speed' but he still can't make you forget
about his Bill and Ted days which will probably follow him throughout his
career.</P>
<P>Further hindering 'The Matrix' are too many references to other films in the
science fiction genre.  Obvious comparisons to other films this one makes
are to 'Total Recall', 'The Terminator' series, 'Invasion of the Body
Snatchers' and ironically, another Keanu Reeves movie entitled 'Johnny
Mnemonic' which was indefensible trash.  Many film makers, like Quentin
Tarantino, know how to draw on the past and take things from other movies in
order to make their own without making it look obvious.  'The Matrix' does
not do this.</P>
<P>The film is written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers, Andy and Larry
who made many 10 best lists in 1996 with 'Bound'.  As 'The Matrix' is their
sophmore effort, it fails like many others who come up with an encore for
previously praised work.  All you can do is re-group and hope that your next
film is a winner.  They just missed the mark here.</P>
