<P>   Hey, I'm a dotcomer who founded a major organization--
how come I haven't made my first million like all those 23-
year-olds running around in Silicon Valley?  Could be that I
was influenced by all those articles that took pity on computer
geeks, people whose only contact with the human race is
with the white letters that pass across their blue computer
screens.  I guess I preferred to spend more time at the
movies with people who shared my love for cinema rather
than sit in the bedroom or the "home office" living room peck-
peck-pecking throughout the day and night.  Yeah, that's it I
think.  Along comes Wayne Wang ("Smoke," "The Joy Luck
Club," "Blue in the Face") with a striking and, dare I saw
sexy, movie about such a geek, a kid in his early twenties
who by the end of the story has 20 million dollars but is not
really happy.  You see, despite his good looks, his aw-shucks
charm, his gentle manner, he doesn't have a girl friend (yeah,
right) so he thinks he has to buy sex.  Wang's latest, "The
Center of the World" acquires its title comes from the area of
the anatomy to which Richard Gere's character Dr. T.
dedicates his career, an area considered so vital to the
cutting-edge businessmen in the Bay Area that they inevitably
take their clients to San Francisco's upscale strip joints such
as the one cited in the story, Pandora's Box.  According to
the voluminous press notes for this film, a considerable
amount of business gets completed under the persuasive
influence of lithe young women who know their way around
laptops--and we don't mean computers.  If you haven't
guessed yet, this movie is about sex, a subject about which
Mr. Wang states he was determined to make, having given
us some other down-to-earth, authentic human relations
stories like "Blue Smoke"--which is about intertwining lives
around a Brooklyn smoke shop including a philosophical
manager, a burnt-out novelist, and a worldly-wise teen.</P>
<P>   Only a fraction of the film takes place in Pandora's Box,
which is fine, because Wang gets a lot of action in the
capacious suite of a 5-star Las Vegas hotel rented for three
days by a disarmingly unpretentious young multimillionaire,
Richard Longman (Peter Sarsgaard).  Richard, who spends
all his waking hours in his room surrounded by three
computers, would like to believe his virtual relationships are
all he needs.  He gets whatever goods he needs by punching
in a few letters (presumably like drugstore.com and
netgrocer.com) but he knows something is missing. 
Fascinated by the gyrations of a stripper in a club, Florence
(Molly Parker), he invites her to spend a weekend with him in
a Vegas suite, which she accepts but not until she gets his
agreement to some pretty rigid rules.  No penetration, no
kissing on the mouth, working hours are 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.
only, separate bedrooms.  "I don't do sex for money," she
insists, and with a list of regs that resemble the complexity of
the Magna Carta, he agrees.  And he pays her $10,000--not
bad if you can get it.</P>
<P>   Filmed in digital video, giving sharp colors when needed
and more earthy tones for the closeups, cinematographer
Mauro Fiore directs his camera on the games these two
people play, to the way they silently or overtly re-negotiate
the terms of the agreement as two lonely people out on a
business weekend actually get to feel something for each
other.  Will she or won't she?  This is the most pressing
question, although on a broader level, of course, we're all
wondering whether somehow Richard and Florence (or Flo,
when she's performing just for him between 10 and 2) will
finally break through their sequestered selves--she, who not
surprisingly feels alone and unconnected when on the stage,
he, when he's pecking away on his three computers or even
when he's talking about a lucrative business in which he has
amazingly lost interest.</P>
<P>   But we in the audience don't lose interest, not if we have
normal libidos at any rate and not if we have the capacity to
care about two people who could--give or take a few million
and, perhaps, lose the stage and the night club and
substitute a cubicle at the local accounting firm--be any of us! 
The 51-year old Hong Kong-born director, equally at home
portraying Chinese culture as he is at depicting the cutting-
edge techno society here in the States, gets nice
performances from Parker and Sarsgaard and also from
Carol Gugino who performs in the role of Florence's friend
Gerri, the young woman who allows Richard to get to know
more about his new friend than he would if he were
interested (like some men I know) only in the center of the
world.</P>
