<P>Spike Lee decides to take a novel route through his latest joint, foregoing
his usual emphasis on the lives of African-Americans, and instead, taking a
deep plunge into the mishmash of activity in the late 70s of New York City.
The "Son of Sam" serial killer, the Italian neighborhood caught in its
paranoiac frenzy, the burgeoning punk rock scene, the New York Yankees and
their bid for the Championship, the last days of disco, and well, what
else...love.</P>
<P>PLOT:
This film takes a look at a certain group of people in an Italian
neighborhood during one of New York City's most turbulent times. The year
was 1977 and the "Son of Sam" serial killer was on the loose. Meanwhile, a
husband cheats on his wife, a good ol' Italian boy turns punk and turns
tricks to support his music career, the police ask the Mob for help catching
the killer, while the rest of the Italian boys scratch out their own list of
suspects.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A slice of life movie. This film is not for everyone, and will most
certainly not be enjoyed by those who go in expecting a serial killer
thriller, or a story told via the traditional trajectory. This movie is for
those folks who enjoy an authentic look back at a time and place in life, a
story full of rich characters, a delectable shooting style reminiscent of
films like GOODFELLAS (10/10) and BOOGIE NIGHTS (8/10), a lively and
appropriate soundtrack, and a superb cast of actors banging out their
greatest thespian hits. I personally believe that this film represents John
Leguizamo's finest work on film yet, with a terrific portrayal of a man
being torn apart by his respect of tradition and his more primitive
yearnings. Adrien Brody plays another great character, managing to capture
all of Ritchie's punk-rock attitude and bravado, with plenty of charm and
humanity, to register his person as one to care about.</P>
<P>On the down side, I think that the film could've been chopped down by twenty
minutes or so, and certainly been improved upon if the distracting
appearance of Spike Lee as a nerdy reporter, had been left on the cutting
room floor. Having said that, Spike the director has stylistically outdone
himself with this picture, playing with everything from the lights, to the
film stock, to the quick cuts to the camera angles...Oliver Stone beware! I
personally have always been a sucker for style and an interesting story told
by the point of view of lively and authentic characters. In fact, the "Son
of Sam" killer angle in this film is simply a backdrop to the proceedings of
these people's lives. An external stimulus mixed in to add paranoia to their
overflowing vat of personal issues in the hot, dirty summer of New York
City. This film managed to make me feel like I was there during that period.
Feel the music, smell the piss on the floor, see the craziness. If you want
to know more about the killer, then this film certainly ain't for you, but
if you want to bask in a couple of hours plus of interesting characters
dealing with real issues during a serial killer frenzy in the late 1970s of
New York City, a groovy soundtrack and a visual style that never lets you
get bored for a second, try this one on for size! It's sure to fit just
right.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
The real "Son of Sam" (David Berkowitz) converted to Christianity about 11
years ago, and maintains his own Web site out of jail:

Mira Sorvino's part of "Dionna" in this film was originally given to
Jennifer Esposito, but she had to take a different part as "Ruby" when
scheduling conflicts prevented her from taking the lead.
Screenwriter Michael Imperioli also acts in this picture. You may also
remember him from one of his most infamous roles as "Spider" from Martin
Scorsese's classic mob tale GOODFELLAS (10/10), in which he gets shot in the
foot by the Joe Pesci character. He also plays a character named Christopher
on TV's "The Sopranos" who, in tribute to his earlier role, shoots someone
else in the foot. Ironically, co-screenwriter Victor Collichio also had a
part in GOODFELLAS, as one of Henry's 80s crew.
John Leguizamo claims that he is actually a better dancer than the film
portrays, since he had to wear high-heeled shoes for his dancing scenes with
Mira Sorvino, because the filmmakers felt as though their size discrepancy
was an issue. Leguizamo didn't really care about the size difference. He's
5'5", she's 5'11".
Leguizamo was born in Bogotá, Colombia, and moved to America with his family
when he was four. He was accepted into Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio and
studied with the master for one day before Strasberg died.
The staple white guy in most Spike Lee films, John Turturro, makes a
surreptitious appearance in this film as well. Listen closely, and you may
just recognize his voice as that of the dog which speaks to the "Son of Sam"
character at some point in the movie.
Mira Sorvino is a babe who has degree from Harvard University, speaks fluent
Mandarin Chinese and once dated video-store clerk turned into director
extraordinaire Quentin Tarantino,
Boxing champion Evander Holyfield has a two-bit part as a "man in riot"
during one scene, while screenwriters Victor Collichio and Michael Imperioli
both make appearances as the characters of "Chickie" and "Midnight"
respectively.
Retired Det. Richard Paul was the Technical Advisor on this film. He was
involved in the first "Son of Sam" homicide. This film was originally titled
THE SON OF SAM.</P>
