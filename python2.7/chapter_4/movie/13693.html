SUPER FEATURES:  I wanted to like this film.</PRE>
<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>I really wanted to like this film.  And like its predecessor, WINGS OF
DESIRE, it has some nice touches, which one wonders where is going to lead,
and what is the film doing.</P>
<P>But, alas, it seems that every film exercise has to end up in some sort of
theme, or idea, for it to have meaning, so it seems.  It is my opinion, that
this film deteriorates, as soon as it becomes a story, instead of
maintaining the idea that it had created.</P>
<P>That's not to say that the film isn't as good, when that happens.  To me,
the illusory part was a bit more interesting, than the eventual story about
an angel wanting to find out what it is like to be a human, and having to go
and find out what it is like.</P>
<P>The film starts with the usual style that made the other film so
interesting. In this one Cassiel, Rafaela spend much of their time looking
at things and making observations about people.  As before, they can hear,
and see things before they actually happen, and most often when they are
happening.  Where their attention goes, they connect
and hear that person's lament, or questions.</P>
<P>Cassiel, however, longs to find out what it is like to be human, and
eventually gets to try it.  And innocently enough he gets to find out that
not everyone around is honest, and has good reasons to boot.  His first
connection, is in all actuality another member of his
group ( a baker named Daniel ), and they all go about their business until
Cassiel gets involved with some not so good affairs.  And the film becomes a
bit of an over ripe fig for my tastes.  To me the wonder of the previous
half, is now becoming the symbolic path that the film has to take.  A sort
of Christian concept now has to take over, complete with sacrificial lamb,
and pointed theme.  This, to this reviewer, ate the film up.</P>
<P>But, it isn't all as bad as I make it sound.  I suppose, for a regular art
film go'er, we may have liked to see something stick to it, and really make
a case.  The premise was great, but since we are humans, our resources into
that space are limited, and this film is no different.  It really is not the
film's fault.  But it could have been more interesting
to me to see the stream of consciousness that it was working with instead of
a thematic story, so overly laden with symbols that do not really add
anything to the whole film.</P>
<P>The best part of the film, and also the oddest, is Wim Wenders use of
various musicians and their songs to highlight several things here and
there.  Right out in the open, are Lou Reed, Nick Cave, Jane Sieberry,
Laurie Anderson, House of Love and other unusual musicians, which give the
film a basic art house style.  To me, though, it is a shame that the film
departs from it too soon.  But these artists, become a sort of
inspiration for the now earth bound angel, which adds a nice touch to the
material.  While what these artists do say is interesting, it is not as good
as what is around, but the analogy is good enough. And Lou Reed is specially
interesting, as he happens not to be a vain artist, and knows very well what
he is doing.</P>
<P>Another of Wim Wenders' curiosity shop items, is his use, and handling of
Michael Gorbachov, of the recently broken up Soviet Union.  As he  works on
a book, he wonders about certain things, and then writes, and of course, we
already knew that these things were happening.  But the charismatic leader,
did come off, like the other characters in the film, for the most part, as
honest, and caring, something that not many of us has the feeling for in
many politicians, specially one of Gorbachov's stature.</P>
<P>Not a great film, but easier to watch than its predecessor Wings of Desire.
Watch the really well thought out camera angles to allow you to see a
different point of view.  The technical side of this film  is probably its
very best asset.</P>
