<P>THE DINNER GAME  (LE DINER DE CONS) (M).  
(Gaumont/Sharmill Films)

Prevost, Alexandra Vendernoot, Catherine Frot
Running time: 80 minutes
(French, with English subtitles).</P>
<P>Writer/director Francis Veber is a dab hand at fast paced
comedies centring on odd couple relationships, and The Dinner Game (Le
Diner De Cons) finds him at his peak.  This is a fast, frantic and
hilarious farce, and one of the funniest films of the year!</P>
<P>The premise of this delightful and thoroughly enjoyable comedy
centres around a group of friends who regularly gather to hold an
unusual dinner party.  The object is for each of the participants to
bring along as a guest the "biggest idiot" they can find so that they
can maliciously make fun of them during the evening.  Usually the
targets of this bizarre entertainment are dull people with unusual
hobbies about which they can discourse at long and boring length, full
of trivial detail.  Publisher Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte)
thinks he has found a pearler when he stumbles across Monsieur Pignon
(Jacques Villeret), a scruffy, dishevelled taxation clerk who builds
elaborate structures out of match sticks.  He invites him to the next
dinner party, assured that he has a winner.  But things start to go
wrong, as Brochant hurts his back in a golf game and is initially
reluctant to go to the dinner.  To add further insult to injury his
wife leaves him.  The evening quickly turns into a litany of
disasters, as Pignon's well meaning attempts to solve Brochant's
problems lead to one hilarious misfortune after another.  But there is
also a humanity and a strong moral to this tale that hits home.</P>
<P>The Dinner Game is based on Veber's own stage play.  Although
its origins are sometimes evident in the setting, this is nonetheless
an entertaining film that overcomes the limitations brilliantly.
Veber's crisp direction and writing wastes precious few moments
throughout the film's tight and sometimes unpredictable 90 minutes.
Villeret is superb as Pignon, and he brings a wonderful physical
presence and energy to the role.  His facial expressions and
contortions provide plenty of humorous moments.</P>
<P>Many of Veber's previous comedies have been turned into bland
American comedies (The Birdcage, Three Fugitives, etc), and one can
almost see The Dinner Game also being turned into a typically pale
Hollywood-style imitation, with Danny De Vito in the role of Pignon.</P>
