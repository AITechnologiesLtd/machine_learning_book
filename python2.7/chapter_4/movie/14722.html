<PRE>Review: Ronin
By Ryan Davis

<P>        If you have ever seen Fox TV's special car chase programs, you'll
have a good idea about the content of Ronin, the new action "thriller" from
director John Frankenheimer.</P>
<P>        The film involves a mysterious briefcase, that several groups of
terrorist want to get their hands on.  An Irish women, Dierdre (played by The
Truman Show's Natascha McElhone), hires a group of mercenaries to assist her
in getting the briefcase. Among the people she hires are Sam (Robert De
Niro), Vincent (Jean Reno), and Gregor (Stellan Skarsgård from Good Will
Hunting). Dierdre's  groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the
current owners are transporting it. They accomplish this task, but a traitor
is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again.</P>
<P>        The briefcase stays on the run, as the movie leads the viewer through
several  plot twists that are badly executed. The writer seemed to be
attempting to make a smart action movie, but failed to understand that just
because there are surprises, it doesn't add too the credibility of a senseless
script. The plot twists get no reaction because they come at a time where no
one cares what is going on, after the apparent climax of the film.</P>
<P>        But to add to the excitement, as I mentioned earlier, there are endless
car chase scenes. They are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story.
Don't get me wrong, I love car chases, but they were overdone and too long
here.</P>
<P>        We never do find out what's in the briefcase, but I doubt anyone cares
by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller.</P>
