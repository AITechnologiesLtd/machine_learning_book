<P>You Know Your Movie's In Trouble When...the normally stoic David Caruso
is the most lively person on screen.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Peter Bowman (David Morse), an Engineer for a multinational oil company
trying to build a well (as cover for their ultimate goal: to build an
oil pipeline which just so happens to be on the same lines as a drug
field), is kidnapped by the ELT, a South American Rebel Faction that is
more interested in "earning" money than in political gain.  After the
company which sent Peter to that country fails to support Peter in his
time of need, international kidnap and ransom agent Terry Thorne
(Russell Crowe), Terry's friend and partner, Dino (David Caruso), and
Peter's wife Alice (Meg Ryan), work closely together to try and bring
Peter safely home.  So closely together, in fact, that Terry starts
developing Feelings for Alice.</P>
<PRE>Uh oh, I feel a big *Y A W N* coming on.</PRE>
<P>The Upshot:
The thing I hate most about yellowlight-worthy flicks is that while
there's not a lot *good* to point out within them, there's also nothing
so irreparably and completely *bad* about them that they won't give
*somebody* the idea to rant at me about why I keep Picking On their Star
Du Jour.  I'd druther have strong feelings about a movie, one way or
another, that would allow me to vigorously defend my stance to said
ranter.  Ambivalence sucks.</P>
<P>One positive thing PROOF OF LIFE had going for it, admittedly, was one
of the best character actors working today.  In the limited screen time
he had, David Morse as the kidnapee, far outclassed the rest of the
field; his was the only character of the bunch that I gave two figs
about coming out alive.</P>
<P>Meg Ryan's Damsel In Distress, in the person of Alice Bowman, at least
had the good graces to not be the same airheaded so-and-so Ryan seemed
so eager to play as a young Hollywood actress.  Indeed, her Alice was
reminiscent of one of Ryan's strongest characters yet, the
tough-as-nails Military Chick in COURAGE UNDER FIRE; Alice even *cries*
like Ryan's "Courage" character.  Which is to say, Alice had a very Been
There, Done That feel to her.  And though Crowe must still be riding
high from the success of GLADIATOR from earlier this year, he apparently
decided to play it safe in a minimally-defined role that might've been
much more interesting had it been more fully fleshed-out.</P>
<P>Of the supporters, Wolframio Benavides (as Juaco, the Hot-Headed Rebel)
and Morse shared a few interesting moments as a captor and his willful
captive; unfortunately, those moments weren't allowed enough room to
breathe and grow into a full-fleged Defining Event for either of the
actors or their characters.  Of the remaining main supporters, Pamela
Reed was far too screechy as Peter's older sister; and Caruso - who I so
dearly loved as Detective Kelly in his infamous NYPD BLUE role - *very*
quickly wore out his wildly-overacting welcome in a questionably
humorous supporting part.</P>
<P>The direction and writing was as unremarkable as the South American
scenery was beautiful; drop Stallone's "Rambo" in that jungle, maybe
you'd have a more thrilling (if not Meaningful) story.  The most
irritating thing about "Proof" is that it took forever to get to an
easily-anticipated Point that could've been more quickly achieved with
well more than half of it edited out.  My husband said it best when he,
uncharacteristically, left the theater to get a pop refill - and wasn't
very concerned about what he might miss in doing so.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
I don't think I've had a "Latino Factor" yet.  To be honest, I don't
know if I'm qualified to address their Issues, especially not those
concerning [insert Latin/South American country here]'s Drug Trafficking
Problem.  Hell, I'm not really even sure what the proper terminology
used to address those who my fellow Americans once blindly grouped as
"Mexicans", would be ("Hispanic"?  "Latino"? Or as I've commonly heard
in the vernacular lately, "Brown"?)</P>
<P>I'd be more than happy to Lend This Space to someone more knowledgeable
of the LF than myself. While you're at it, I'd like to know if it's Just
Me, or is anyone else tired of the brunt of the blame for the
consequences of America's War On [Some] Drugs, being laid entirely at
the feet of [insert Latin/South American country here], with no blame
being assigned to the War On [Some] Drugs itself?</P>
<PRE>Bammer's Bottom Line:
Sounds like a "Jeopardy" category...</PRE>
<P>[Contestant]: "I'll take 'Proof Of Life' for $200, Alex"
[Alex]:  "It's our first Daily Double! The answer: 'What paramedics were
checking for after catatonic-looking audience members left the new movie
starring Russell Crowe and Meg Ryan...'"</P>
<P>PROOF OF LIFE (rating: yellowlight):
PROOF OF LIFE committed the unforgivable act of boring me to death.</P>
