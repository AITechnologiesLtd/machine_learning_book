<P>   Politicians have about as much public trust as used car
salesmen.  They lie, cheat, steal and speak in platitudes. 
They commit adultery, but that's not so bad.  What's worse is
that they get into bed with wealthy corporations, yet wind up
screwing the poor and the middle class.  If you don't believe
that, you probably also had faith in the guy who said, "Read
my lips: no new taxes."  What would happen, though, if a
public official actually told the truth about everything?  Would
he last more than a month in office?  According to the movie
"Bulworth," the answer to the last question is, "Yes and no."
This sharp, sometimes intelligent and always stimulating
picture, produced, directed, co-written and starring Warren
Beatty, deals with what happens when a high public
official--like Jim Carrey's character Fletcher Reed--simply
cannot lie.  No way is he like that hair-care manufacturer who
contended some time ago that "If you have only one life, live
it as a blonde."  Among the points hammered home in
"Bulworth" is the notion that black people have more fun. 
"Bulworth" is about a politician who doesn't just talk a good
game: he really gives a rap.</P>
<P>   If campaign rhetoric has ever tempted you to reach for
Prozac, you'll understand what the title character is going
through during his bid for re-election as U.S. senator from
California.  Depressed to the point of suicide after repeating
the bromide, "We stand at the doorstep of a new millennium"
for the thousandth time, Senator Jay Bulworth (Warren
Beatty) cuts a deal with two shady characters.  Agreeing to
bottle in committee a bill which would force insurance
companies to issue policies to ghetto residents, he pressures
lobbyist Crockett (Paul Sorvino) into writing him a ten million
dollar life insurance policy to provide for his family upon his
demise.  He then contracts with hit man Vinnie (Richard Scott
Sarafian) to target himself, in effect committing suicide with
the appearance of murder.  When he meets and becomes
smitten with a young black woman, Nina (Halle Berry), his
depression lifts.  Having stood at the doorstep of his own
extinction, he shucks off his old, corrupt self and determines
to tell it like it is.  After this point, "Bulworth" divides into two
stories: one, the senator's caustic and brutally honest
discourses about the nature of American society; the other, a
madcap series of adventures planting the politician deep into
the world of a black urban ghetto.  The first concept succeeds
so well that you wish Beatty could sustain its tone throughout
the story.  The second, likely to appeal to the younger set in
the audience, veers unfortunately into the well-worn
categories of car chases, farcical assassination plots, and
excess.  If the movie could have sustained the comic,
insightful repartee which made its trailer the most enticing
advertisement of the year, "Bulworth" could have been a
modern masterwork of political debunking.</P>
<P>   With this in mind, you may agree that the scenes that work
best are those which display Bulworth engaging his
voters with politically incorrect thought.  Meeting
constituents in a black church packed with supporters of his
party, Bulworth is confronted by an angry woman who
suggests that the Democratic Party doesn't care about the
African-American community.  Rather than soothe the voter,
he retorts, "Isn't that obvious?"  He suggests that the voters
are stuck with him for the next six years anyway since they're
not about to vote Republican; that they will never get
anywhere if their chief interests are eating chicken wings,
drinking malt liquor, and supporting a former running back
who stabbed his wife.  Pressed to explain what happened to
the development funds that the senator promised to funnel to
the community, Bulworth responds truthfully enough that he
forgot about the promise, "But then you haven't contributed to
my campaign, have you?"  In yet another repudiation of
political correctness, he meets a group of Hollywood
filmmakers and, in a master-stroke of self-denigrating humor
about the movie industry tells them, "Most of your films are
not very good.  You must be doing it for the money.  You turn
everything to crap."  He also reports to the aghast, mostly
Jewish congregation that "my guys aren't stupid: they always
put the big Jews on the committees."</P>
<P>   The movie is not as successful when it abandons verbal wit
and turns to madcap burlesque.  Vittorio Stararo's camera
frequently turns to an assassin in dark shades, a caricature
who simply appears from time to time on the orders of his silly
mob boss, Vinnie.  Beatty provides us as well with a
stereotypical bunch of teens toting guns in their decaying
neighborhood, gang members who are more like the giddy
dead-end kids of Lyle Kessler's "Orphans" than like the scary
youth of the Hughes brothers' "Dead Presidents."  Even here,
however, Beatty provides us with a three-dimensional role by
Don Cheadle as L.D., a drug lord who employs kids because
they can carry out his demands without the legal
accountability of adults (just like politicians, who play fast with
other people's money). When Halle Berry in the role of
Bulworth's inspiring new girl friend, is not simply displayed
with a cryptic expression on her captivating face, she has
a believable sexual chemistry with a man who is of a different
race and old enough to be her grandfather.  As Murphy, the
senator's chief of staff, Oliver Platt makes up for his
miscasting as Maffio in Marshall Hershkovitz's "Dangerous
Beauty,"  in an engaging turn as the senator's foil who finds
his boss's new lifestyle  contagious.   Also surprisingly
effective in a smaller role is black militant playwright Amiri
Baraka in the part of a homeless man who stands for the
conscience of America, calling ultimately for a new spirit to
embrace the land.</P>
<P>   The movie has a pulsating rap score , including a smart
rendition by Beatty of an extended lyric which satirizes the
right-wing strain in American politics. Beatty looks so good
that when Halle Berry estimated the man's age as 60,
members of the audience gasped at the absurdity.  Yet this
gifted performer, born in March 1937, is evidence that a keen
mind focused on a productive career can indeed keep a
seasoned person looking fresh. Rated R.  109 min.
