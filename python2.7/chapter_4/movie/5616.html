<P>     It's often said that if you're going to borrow, borrow from the 
best.  And, in motion pictures, one of the best is certainly Akira 
Kurosawa.  His THE SEVEN SAMURAI was remade as John Sturges' immensely 
popular THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.  His THE HIDDEN FORTRESS inspired George 
Lucas' epic STAR WARS.  And now, the premise of 1950's RASHOMON has been 
re-worked by director Edward Zwick and screenwriter Patrick Sheane 
Duncan for COURAGE UNDER FIRE, a powerful and intelligent examination of 
the consequences of guilt and responsibility, and the meaning of 
absolute truth.</P>
<P>     COURAGE UNDER FIRE shows us another face of war's horrors, although 
this particular perspective is less bleak than that of a PLATOON or an 
APOCALYPSE NOW.  Those movies were brutally effective because they 
reveled in bleakness, cynicism, and carnage; COURAGE UNDER FIRE gains 
its power by affirming that the cost of war isn't the inevitable 
eradication of every trace of human dignity and heroism.  The acts of 
valor depicted here stand out because they are contrasted with the 
barbarism that results from the battlefield transformation of thinking 
men into heartless killers.</P>
<P>     Depending on your point of view, the Gulf War could have been one 
(or more) of many things:  a bold stroke for liberty, a punitive strike 
against a deserving enemy, muscle-flexing by a president eager to shed 
his weakling image, or an attempt to whip the country into a patriotic 
frenzy.  For those involved in the combat, however, the political 
reasoning underlying the war was of little importance.  Battle meant the 
potential for death, and that potential unleashed the best and worst of 
human nature.</P>
<P>     Lieutenant Colonel Nat Serling (Denzel Washington) was a tank 
commander during the Gulf War.  On the night of February 25, 1991, his 
troops engaged the Iraqis, and, during the confusion, Serling mistook 
one of his own tanks for the enemy.  He gave the order to fire, and 
ended up killing his best friend.  Since then, Serling has been burdened 
by guilt.  He has become an alcoholic, his marriage is falling apart, 
and the government, which is covering up the incident, hasn't offered a 
means to assuage his bruised conscience.</P>
<P>     Six months after the war's conclusion, Serling is working on the 
staff of General Hershberg (Michael Moriarty), investigating potential 
medal recipients.  In that capacity, he is asked to rubber-stamp the 
approval of a posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor for Captain Karen 
Walden, a helicopter pilot who is credited for saving five lives at the 
cost of her own.  She would be the first woman to receive the Medal of 
Honor for combat.  As Serling begins his investigation, however, he 
discovers discrepancies in the stories of those involved.  He digs 
deeper, and uncovers contrasting perspectives of the same events.  
Ilario (Matt Damon), one of the men in Walden's medi-vac unit, claims 
that "the heavier the pressure, the calmer she got."  Monfriez (Lou 
Diamond Phillips), another of Walden's men, has a different story, 
stating emphatically, "She was afraid... She was a coward.  That's the 
bottom line..."</P>
<P>     Kurosawa's RASHOMON depicted a murder from several different 
viewpoints.  COURAGE UNDER FIRE uses a similar technique for events in 
the desert.  Which Karen Walden is the real one:  Ilario's, Monfriez's, 
or someone else's?  Or is the truth unknowable?  For Serling, whose 
honor demands that he get to the bottom of things, understanding what 
happened when Walden crash-landed becomes an obsession.  Even when he is 
officially removed from the investigation because the White House is 
getting impatient to award the medal, he refuses to give it up.  He asks 
for help from Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn), a Washington Post reporter, 
promising answers in return for aid.</P>
<P>     Serling's quest is like putting together a puzzle with pieces 
missing, and we work alongside him to unravel the mystery.  The audience 
is in synch with the film; the script is neither one step ahead of us 
nor one step behind.  Ultimately, as the truth begins to surface, 
everyone must face the consequences of their actions.  COURAGE UNDER 
FIRE ends with a moment of catharsis, but there are no overblown 
speeches -- only a simple, quiet scene that touches the heart more 
profoundly than anything accomplished by melodramatic manipulation.  Is 
it overly-sentimental?  Perhaps.  Is it effective?  Definitely.</P>
<P>      Denzel Washington, whom Zwick directed to an Oscar in GLORY, is in 
top form here, essaying a tormented man with a noble heart who's caught 
in a vortex of political and emotional turmoil.  Meg Ryan, aiming to 
break away from her reputation as a romantic comedy leading lady, uses 
this opportunity to attempt more demanding, dramatic acting.  Because 
her character is seen only through the flashbacks of others, she must 
essentially play multiple roles -- a task which she carries out 
admirably.</P>
<P>     In GLORY, Zwick effectively married a powerful human interest story 
with well-choreographed battle sequences.  Here, he once again 
accomplishes this, although the combat takes place in a far more 
technologically advanced arena.  But the campaigns of COURAGE UNDER FIRE 
that leave the deepest impression aren't those involving ground troops 
and air cover.  Rather, they're the deeper, more personal struggles of 
Nat Serling as he sifts through the war-ravaged elements of the human 
spirit for that "one little piece of shining something for people to 
believe in."  COURAGE UNDER FIRE is as profound and intelligent as it is 
moving, and that makes this memorable motion picture one of 1996's best.</P>
