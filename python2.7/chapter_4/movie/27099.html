<P>   Despite the sci-fi concept of a man temporarily given the
ability to read women's minds and consequently to know what
they really desire, "What Women Want" is a conventional,
sappy romantic comedy, a retread of the usual relationships
explored by the film industry.  Fathers often make
misconnections with their teenaged daughters, male
executives with their female assistants, husband with wives. 
The strange thing about this movie helmed by Nancy Meyers
is that despite the extraordinary power given to advertising
executive Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) literally to know what
every woman around him is thinking, Josh Goldsmith and
Cathy Yuspa's script contains not a single detail that we in
the audience do not already know.  We learn that a dress is
the most important item of concern to a fifteen-year-old girl
invited to the senior prom by her boyfriend.  We find out that
a woman with a reputation for bitchiness who has been hired
as creative director of an ad agency is not a bitch at all, and
that a T&A man can, under the proper circumstances,
become a sensitive listener with a newly found respect for
women after learning what they really think of him.  By
reading the mind of a server of coffee in a Chicago building's
lobby, we find out that she does not like being rejected.  Now,
those of you who do not have the ability to read women's
minds...which of these notions did you not already know?</P>
<P>   Filmed in Chicago, principally in the offices of a midtown ad
agency directed by an apprehensive Dan Wanamaker (Alan
Alda) and in Nick's spacious condo, the story gains impetus
from Wanamaker's attempt to revive a lagging business by
snagging the coveted Nike women's sneakers account. 
Needing a creative director who understands the way a
woman thinks, he bypasses Nick for the promotion, instead
going with the assertive director of a competing agency,
Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt)--who then works closely with
Nick as her subordinate.  Little does Darcy know that
because of a freak accident with a hair dryer, Nick has been
given the novel ability to hear what women think, a power he
uses both to steal Darcy's ideas and to listen in to both the
compliments he is secretly given by women for his sexiness
and the insults by those who think he's a jerk and worse.  To
counteract his reputation as a macho man who never really
listens to the females in his life, he raises his antennas to find
out what these folks really want and then, showing great
sensitivity to their needs, he gives it to them--changing their
opinions of him for the better.</P>
<P>   Though essentially a comedy, "What Women Want" pulls
almost mercilessly on the heartstrings as Nick takes action to
prevent the suicide of an office worker he'd ignored and to
service a coffee worker who in the past needed to fake
orgasms which she heretofore was unable to achieve
because of her partners' lack of tenderness.  Mel Gibson
relies on his usual mannerisms--rolling eyes, revolving head,
nice-guy smile, to convey his emotions to a movie audience
that is unable to read minds, while Helen Hunt, a fine
performer not always fortunate in her choice of films, does
not convince us that she's head over heels with her co-
worker.  During the two kissing scenes, Dean Cundey's
camera tries to make up for their lack of chemistry by
presenting their embrace from various angles while music
supervisor Bonnie Greenberg-Goodman pumps up the great
classics like "Night and Day" whether or not the Cole Porter
song or several others have much relationship to the tale. 
Too bad an uncredited Bette Midler is on camera for precious
few minutes.</P>
<P>   The one scene that gives away director Nancy Meyer's
attempt to appeal to an adolescent mentality involves Nick's
being caught by his daughter and her boy friend while
dressing in a woman's panty-hose, shaving his legs, and
donning nail polish--all in the service of researching a
woman's psyche by becoming as close to a woman himself
as he dares.  If that encourages you to roar with laughter,
this is the movie for you.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 123 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
