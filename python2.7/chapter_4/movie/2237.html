<PRE>                          THE REMAINS OF THE DAY
                       A film review by Lewis Butler
                        Copyright 1993 Lewis Butler</PRE>
<PRE>Summary:  The latest offering from Merchant/Ivory once again shows what 
          movies should be.  A finely crafted story with marvelous
          performances from all.  Hopkins deserves at least a nomination.
          One of the best films of the year.  +3 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The only thing I can say in detraction from THE REMAINS OF THE DAY
is that the rather stilted style of the film itself, a series of
flashbacks, detracts from the overall effect of what must be viewed as
a tragic tale.  It would be my guess that the film would have been much
more powerful had we not began the film with James Stevens (Anthony
Hopkins) as an old man, alone.  Hopkins performance is a wonder to
watch.  He plays the stoic butler with such ferocity one can barely
resist the urge to vault up and strangle the man.  Each trace of
emotion is so carefully and wholly hidden that no one in the film has
the foggiest notion Mr. Stevens might actually have feelings.  The
story revolves around Miss Kenton and Mr. Stevens.  Miss Kenton is the
house-keeper hired for a large English manor, Darlington Hall.  Mr.
Stevens is the butler, head of the household.  Master of all the
servants.  The ultimate servant.  Mr. Stevens and Miss Kenton fall in
love, but the requirements of their duty prevent either from
acknowledging their feelings.  Despite Mr.  Steven's one Freudian slip
that he would be lost without her, he is never able to admit his
feelings.  Not for Miss Kenton, not for his father, not even for his
employers.  When one character tries to talk to Mr. Stevens as a
friend, we see a person very uncomfortable with the idea, and unable to
relinquish the stoicism of his position.</P>
<P>     Emma Thompson is Miss Kenton, and she brings her usual charm to
the role.  She finds herself in love with Mr. Stevens, but is unable to
coax him into any sort of reaction except that of the good and proper
servant.  Ms. Thompson's performance is exactly what Hopkins needed;
it allows Steven's character to be softened just a tad.  As the
audience we are not so irritated with Stevens that we loose interest in
his life, because we see what he means to Miss Kenton.</P>
<PRE>     I'm not sure that it is the best movie of the year, but it is
among the best I've seen.</PRE>
