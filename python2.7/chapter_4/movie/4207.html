<PRE>                               THE VANISHING (1991)
                       A film review by Lon Ponschock
                        Copyright 1995 Lon Ponschock</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by George Sluizer
Stars a Dutch cast</PRE>
<PRE>                                "The eternal not knowing...
                                 that's the worst thing."
                                 -- from The Vanishing --</PRE>
<P>     It hooked me.  After a bunch of false starts in watching this
foreign film--winner of all kinds of prizes--it hooked me and I had to
finish it.  I had started watching the show on several occasions and it
looked pretty much like the average import.  But it hooked me with the
idea of 'man who has to know' beyond all costs, out of time ...
forever.</P>
<P>     THE VANISHING is a mystery.  It concerns the disappearance of
'Saskia' and the search to find out what happened to her by her lover.
This search goes on over years, starts and stops, always in the
background of the man's life-- an obsession.</P>
<P>     This man is confronted by another who will tell him, he says, what
he needs to know about Saskia.  From there, the viewer is taken on a
psychological journey into the minds of two men: one obsessed, the
other a sociopath.</P>
<PRE>     It hooked me.</PRE>
<P>     But THE VANISHING said something different to me than 'what is the
perfect crime'.  In the old Hitchcockian mode we have seen many
variations on this and I, for one, just don't care a whole lot about
crime stories.</P>
<PRE>     No.</PRE>
<P>     What hooked me was the 'need to know' at any cost.  The drama
turns on this.  The man's love turns on this.  And the difference
between the casual discussion of what it means to sustain a loss and
the reality are here ... in THE VANISHING.</P>
<PRE>                           "She didn't give you the chance to
                            not to love her "
                                         -- from the film --</PRE>
<PRE>     It hooked me.</PRE>
