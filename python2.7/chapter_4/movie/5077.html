<PRE>                               THE BIRDCAGE
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1996 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>"The Birdcage" is showing its age. This latest take on "La
Cage aux Folles" is curiously flat in spite of the very big
talents of Robin Williams, Nathan Lane, Gene Hackman, and Dianne
Wiest. Elaine May and Mike Nichols have teamed up to update the
dialogue and direction. Cast and production team just couldn't be
better--so what's wrong?</P>
<P>Start with the story. Armand (Robin Williams) and Albert
(Nathan Lane) have raised Val (Dan Futterman), Armand's son by
his one experience with a woman 20 years back. Now Val has
announced the unthinkable: he is going to marry a girl, and the
girl is the daughter of Senator and Mrs. Keely. </P>
<P>The senator, a giant in "The Coalition for Moral Order," has 
recently announced his support for presidential candidate Eli
Jackson, who has just been found dead in the bed of a black
prostitute who heard her customer's last words: "Your money's on
the dresser, Chocolate." The senator and his wife bring along an
appropriate load of anxiety when they arrive in South Beach to
meet the parents of their daughter's intended. Will Val's parents
be put off by Keely's embarrassing endorsement of a fallen leader
of "family values?"</P>
<P>In South Beach, meanwhile, Armand is staging an elaborate
charade for his son. To create a mainstream family, he enlists
Val's mother Katherine (Christine Baranski) to play her real role
and tries unsuccessfully to hide Albert, who refuses to be left
out of the proceedings. </P>
<P>The earlier film and stage play did all this with a grand
blend of hilarity and pathos. In 1996, the assumptions seem all
wrong. The decade has given us state-of-the-moment drag films
("Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," "Paris is Burning") that
advanced public understanding of the transvestite culture.
Watching Albert try to walk like John Wayne and keep a stiff
wrist is a little like watching Butterfly McQueen play Prissy in
"Gone With the Wind." The world has moved beyond the
stereotype--a little, at least. </P>
<P>Robin Williams responds by playing Armand with quiet
dignity. Dianne Wiest and Gene Hackman have a field day
straight-facing the Moral Coalition couple that Elaine May
created to bring the story into the 90s. Mr. Hackman, just by
mouthing right-wing pieties without embellishment, pierces the
skin of the hypocrisy. Christine Baranski jumps into the pretense
with high spirits, only to stand mute when her role is dropped.
Nathan Lane's caricature performance is part of the problem.</P>
<P>Topical it may be, but the warmth is gone. There isn't a
scintilla of evidence of real affection between Armand and
Albert, no feel of their love for Val or his for them. The film
is powered only by the desperate need to fool the Keelys. Asking
too much? Perhaps. But if this modernized, brittle version of "La
Cage" is very funny, it is also without heart. On the road to
topical comedy, it lost its power to be affecting.     </P>
