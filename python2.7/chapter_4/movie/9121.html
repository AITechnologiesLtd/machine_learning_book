<PRE>                        GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon

<P>"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!"</P>
<P>I didn't think a theme song could be this contagious until I found
myself humming it for breakfast, lunch and tea.</P>
<P>"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEE!"</P>
<P>Yep. I've caught Jungle fever, God help me. Not long after George
started swinging, I felt the incredible urge to throw of all shy
reservation and self restraint, strip out of coat and tie, throw on a
loin cloth and swing from vine to vine. There's nothing quite like the
feel of flying through air, only to be stopped by the incredible jolt of
a large tree trunk. The feel of wood smashing against skin and bone,
shattering the vertebrate, the splinters embedding in the soft tissue of
tongue and cheek, the missing teeth .... I'm getting carried away!</P>
<P>"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEE!"</P>
<P>As a decent, respectable citizen of this earth, I found myself laughing
at excrement jokes, painful male gonad jokes and self inflicted, bodily
harm jokes? Maybe it was because Jim Carrey was absent, and Brendan
Fraser present that made the slapstick so much more palatable. This
likeable portrayal of "George" by Brendan, carries with it the innocence
of a child, the pectorals of a Man, and other well proportioned parts
desired by Woman. Yes ladies, stop gawking - tongue in, close that jaw.
We've all got what he's got, more or less.</P>
<P> "George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEEE!"</P>
<P>I didn't know that animals were so computer malleable until I watched an
Ape philosophize, an elephant imitate a dog, gorillas become Ninjas, and a
monkey imitate George. The story is very simple. George finds Ursula,
George likes Ursula, George mates with Ursula - I don't mean initially,
because we need to build up the sexual tension between Man and Woman,
Tarzan and Jane, George and Ursula; and I don't mean literally - shame
on you, put away those thoughts, this is a children's movie! Who's
Ursula? Oh, she's a wealthy blonde who is the most fortunate and
compatible of her sex to be chosen for George, with a matching I.Q. of
one.</P>
<P>"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEEEE!"</P>
<P>So Disney has created a fun spoof with more vacuum than grey matter; but
who cares, after a hard days work, it's pretty invigorating to end up
laughing like a one year old. This movie doesn't pretend to be a great
myth of Olympic proportions, like the meat loaf "Hercules"; and so ends
up to being more enjoyable and likeable, with little expectations to
live up to.</P>
<P>"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEEEE!"
"Goodbye England's rose .... Like a candle in the wind..."
"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEEEE!"
"Let's hear it for the Men in Black.....Men in Black."
"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEEEE!"
"Now how does that song from My Bestfriend's Wedding go again?"
"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEEEE!"
"It's the Circle of life....."</P>
<P>Nope, I still like this tune the best: "George, George, George of the
Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEEEE!"</P>
