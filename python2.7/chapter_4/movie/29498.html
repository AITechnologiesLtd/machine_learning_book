<PRE>THE MALTESE FALCON (1941)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Flood of remakes is definitely one of the most annoying
trends of contemporary Hollywood. It seems that every
outstanding film made twenty-five or thirty years ago is
about to get modern makeover. Judging by the way Hollywood
handled those remakes in past few years, it is almost
certain that many great films are about to have their
reputations forever tarnished by uninspired and usually
abysmal modern versions. Remakes, same as the sequels in
past few decades, are viewed as the manifestation of
creative crisis in modern Hollywood and its inability to
deliver anything original in their products. However,
remaking films is hardly a contemporary phenomenon in
Hollywood; movies used to be remade in previous decades same
as in our times. And in some rare occasions remakes turned
out much better than original. The best example is, of
course, one of the best known films of all time - THE
MALTESE FALCON, film noir classic directed by John Huston in
1941.</P>
<P>The plot of the film is based on the "hard-boiled" detective
novel by Dashiell Hammett, which has been adapted for the
screen twice before - in 1931 and 1936. Protagonist is Sam
Spade (played by Humphrey Bogart), tough and street-wise
private investigator from San Francisco who shares a firm
with his partner Miles Archer (played by Jerome Cowan). One
day their services are hired by mysterious and good-looking
Miss Wonderly (played by Mary Astor). What was supposed to
be routine surveillance job goes terribly wrong for Archer
who gets killed, while Spade becomes a prime suspect. Almost
immediately after that Spade is approached by peculiar yet
sinister world traveller Joel Cairo (played by Peter Lorre)
who wants to hire his services in order to put his hand on a
certain object. Spade is convinced that those two events are
connected and his suspicions are gradually proving correct -
not only Cairo, but also few other interested parties are
involved in the case that revolves around ancient and
priceless artefact known as "Maltese Falcon". That includes
Miss Wonderly who is not what she claims to be, yet that
doesn't prevent Spade to fall in love with her.</P>
<P>THE MALTESE FALCON is often seen as the Hollywood's first
film noir. The genre of hard-boiled detective stories
existed before, namely in the domain of pulp literature, but
this film was first to bring it to the silver screen in its
recognisable form. Because of that, THE MALTESE FALCON has
great historical importance - it represents something of a
milestone in development of American genre cinema. It is
also the reason why many of the characters and situations
might look like cliches, but to view them this way would be
a great injustice to the film that actually inspired such
cliches. However, when we watch the film we are hardly aware
of such cliches - the plot and character type, despite being
utilised in numerous other films through the latter decades,
are still interesting and the movie provides lot of
entertainment. This accomplishment is even greater when we
consider that THE MALTESE FALCON was actually the first film
directed by John Huston, one of the greatest American
filmmakers of 20th Century. It could be argued that his
first film (in which his father Walter appears in small
cameo role) is actually the best film in his entire career,
making this the second such instance in 1941 - the very year
when Orson Welles made his CITIZEN KANE.</P>
<P>One of the reasons why THE MALTESE FALCON happens to be as
great now as it was more than a half a century ago could be
found in its timeless quality. The story, characters and
situations are universal and you could sense that they might
exist in each era, including our own. This is due to the
extremely clever and tight script by John Huston, who took
each scene and each piece of dialogue from the original
novel and packed it into the coherent whole as faithful to
the dark world of Hammett's fiction as possible in early
1940s Hollywood. And because of that the movie looks
incredibly modern - its content, with hidden and some not so
well hidden layers, might very well belong to our time. The
protagonist is anti-hero with the utter lack of conventional
moral code - he is cynical, adulterous, lacks any compassion
and sometimes manifests sadistic pleasure in using violence.
There is hardly anything that separates him from the
villains in this film, except for the fact that he is more
experienced and more intelligent and therefore uses
manipulation instead of the acts that would brand him as the
villain in the classical sense. Even his final act, when he
does the Right Thing, is motivated more by the common sense
than adherence to even the most basic ethical principles. In
the world of THE MALTESE FALCON almost everyone (with the
exception of Spade's loyal secretary Effie, played by Lee
Patrick) is bad - each and every character is motivated by
greed or instant self-gratification in the form of sex (like
the character of Iva Archer, played by Gladys George). Even
the forces of law and order, which are supposed to give some
kind of moral compass, are presented as inept or violent.
Because of that, THE MALTESE FALCON, with the cast of
exclusively immoral characters, might remind contemporary
audience of the Tarantinoesque films about criminal
enterprise going bad.</P>
<P>Huston's flawless direction was in many ways helped by truly
stellar cast. The most recognisable of all actors, Humphrey
Bogart, used this role of morally questionable protagonist
as an excellent opportunity to make his transition from the
roles of traditional villains, which he had played in 1930s,
to the roles of noble heroes he was going to play in 1940s.
Cynical and near-psychopathic Sam Spade is, therefore, one
of his most recognisable screen incarnations, although not
as a loveable as his next greatest role in CASABLANCA. His
partner Mary Astor is also great - she might not look
enchantingly beautiful compared to the other femme fatales
of film noir, but she nevertheless manages to ooze
wickedness on the screen in a manner which is, in a sense,
more sexy than physical looks itself. Of course, the rest of
the cast is even more interesting. Peter Lorre's role of
homosexual gangster is legendary, and it is no wonder that
he became one of the greatest characters of his time. Sidney
Greenstreet as seemingly cultivated yet equally ruthless
criminal (with the large belly as a character trait, which
Huston emphasised with clever camera angles) is also great,
and his accomplishment is even greater, considering that
this was his first major on-screen role. Finally, Elisha
Cook Jr. is equally impressive as young wannabe thug. The
good acting was essential for the success of this film,
because the complicated plot would be quite uninspiring
without interesting characters and the cast capable of
presenting them to the screen. Huston again shows his great
directing skills by managing to tie every loose end and keep
the appropriate pace in the same time, making this film
slightly more than an hour and half long.</P>
<P>THE MALTESE FALCON, with its great direction, truly stellar
cast and interesting story and characters is a film that
managed to transcend its time and it is still able to
entertain the audience six decades after its making. To
countless new generations of viewers this is film is more
than an important piece of film history. It is a true
masterpiece.</P>
