<PRE>The Legend of 1900 
 A film review by Marty Mapes 
 Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes </PRE>
<P>***1/2 (out of 4) THE LEGEND OF 1900 is an unconventional, imaginative
fable about a man whose entire universe is a ship. </P>
<PRE>SUMMARY</PRE>
<P>The story is told by Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince), a sad and lonely guy
who's giving up his career as a musician. He tells the story as he sells
his trumpet to the man at the music shop.</P>
<P>The story begins after the passengers disembark in New York, on the
first day of the first month of the new century -- 1900, that is -- a
ship worker (Bill Nunn) finds a baby on the piano in the ship's lounge.
He names the boy 1900 (for short) and raises him in the boiler room of
the ship.</P>
<P>One day the boy is found playing the piano. He has a natural talent for
it, and so moves out of the boilers to the upper decks of the ship,
where he entertains the passengers.</P>
<P>The talent of 1900 (now played by Tim Roth) is enormous. He can play any
style of music, even from just a hummed scrap of a tune. One of his
favorite styles is jazz, and he earns a sterling reputation as a jazz
pianist. Some say he's even better than Jelly Roll Morton.</P>
<P>Jelly Roll (played with fierce pride by Clarence Williams) takes this
challenge seriously. Since 1900 refuses to set foot on land, Jelly Roll
books a trip across the Atlantic, just to meet this man -- and to put
him in his place. In one of the most memorable scenes, Jelly Roll and
1900 have a musical duel.</P>
<P>In another episode, 1900 comes as close as he ever will to falling in
love. As he plays a ballad for a new recording, he notices a girl on the
other side of the porthole. The song becomes his love for her.</P>
<PRE>ANALYSIS</PRE>
<P>Two of the best things about THE LEGEND OF 1900 are clear in these
scenes. The first is that, because the story is told AS A STORY, the
movie is allowed to take on an imaginative, slightly-exaggerated,
storybook feel. The exaggeration stops well short of zaniness. There is
merely enough to give the characters a larger-than-life charm. (That's
something Tornatore did well in CINEMA PARADISO, too)</P>
<P>The second is that Tornatore acknowledges that music is important to the
movie, and lets it play for a long time. This is worth mentioning
because a lot of directors don't show music scenes for very long –
they're hard to film in a way that's not boring. (Recall Jane Horrocks'
"evening" of music in LITTLE VOICE. It was compressed down to about 5
minutes of screen time, even though it was the film's whole RAISON
D'ETRE. A more recent example is the penultimate scene in MUSIC OF THE
HEART, where no composition gets more than about 30 seconds of screen
time.)</P>
<P>Ennio Morricone wrote most of the music for this movie, and he was the
perfect choice. Morricone's music often seems weird and unconventional
-- as though he had no formal training in how music is "supposed" to be.
(Think of the screamed and quacked voices in the theme from THE GOOD,
THE BAD, AND THE UGLY.) 1900's music isn't THAT far-out, but Morricone's
unconventional-yet-functional style is perfect for the character of
1900, who is self-taught and musically isolated.</P>
<P>The acting by Roth and Vince is impeccable. Although Roth's part was
smaller than it at first seems, he captured the shy, fragile charm of
1900. He wasn't listed in the music credits at the end, but he knew
enough piano to look like he was really doing it. And even though Vince
has acted in a dozen movies, he's never had a part this big. Vince has
darting eyes, which might seem a hindrance, but they add to the pathos
and sympathy of his character. </P>
<P>One final trait of THE LEGEND OF 1900 is worth mentioning: the
cinematography by Lajos Koltai. A few scenes in particular are
noteworthy. One is the fluid, energetic photography of the great piano
duel. As I said, most filmmakers can't shoot music performances without
making them boring. Tornatore was able to make his performances last
longer by letting Koltai shoot some great stuff.</P>
<P>The other great-looking scene was of the first meeting between 1900 and
Max. Max was seasick and 1900 had the perfect cure. I won't say more,
except that the cinematography in this scene won me over completely.</P>
<PRE>CONCLUSION</PRE>
<P>Roger Ebert gave THE LEGEND OF 1900 a so-so review because he didn't
completely understand the character of 1900. I can't say I understood
him any better, but that's not what this movie was saying to me. </P>
<PRE>The innocent, charming fable is supported so well by the music, the
cinematography, and the manner of storytelling, that I can't see THE
LEGEND OF 1900 as anything but a success.
