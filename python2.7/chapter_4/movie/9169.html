The Young Lions (1958)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 86</PRE>
<P>"The Young Lions" is a lengthy war epic that focuses not on
battles, but on the people that have been forced to fight
them.  The theme of war as an evil, destructive and pointless
force is well-developed, and the quality of the script and
story more than compensates for minor problems.</P>
<P>It is the story of three soldiers.  Marlon Brando plays a
German lieutenant whose growing disillusionment with war
and the German cause parallels the decline of the Axis war
machine.  Montgomery Clift plays a jewish private who must
overcome harassment from his fellow soldiers.  Dean Martin
plays a Broadway entertainer who is racked with guilt for
trying to avoid fighting in the front lines.</P>
<P>Dean Martin has the weakest character.  He is clearly in his late
thirties, but is so guilty over not serving in the trenches
that he falls to drinking and abuse of his girlfriend.  Martin
doesn't seem comfortable, looking as if he'd rather be somewhere
else.</P>
<P>Clift effectively underplays.  Clift always landed terrific
roles, due either to his excellent judgement of scripts, or 
from film directors noticing his charisma.  His character
briefly deserts his unit, an action not well explained.  Also,
perhaps he is made too much of a hero in rescuing his bullying 
fellow soldiers.</P>
<P>Brando has the best role.  His German accent isn't quite right,
but he underplays his character perfectly.  Torn between duty
and the revulsion of his actions, he soon has the unhappy look 
of a condemned man.  </P>
<P>Well directed, there's not a scene wasted, and the film
never drags.  The Germans are portrayed as humans reluctantly
following an evil cause, rather than as murderous stereotypes.
The script and cinematography is also excellent.</P>
