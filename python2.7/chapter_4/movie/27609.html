<P>   Racine meets Moliere in the utterly delightful French
comedy of manners co-written and directed by Agnes Jaoui--
who also turns in a crackerjack performance as a hashish-
peddling bartender together with her real-life husband and
film's co-writer Jean-Pierre Bacri.  This French entry into the
Oscar competition blends parody and affliction so seamlessly
that members of any audience fortunate enough to watch the
story may effortlessly identify with the poignancy of the
principal character's condition while at the same time smile
broadly at the way he boorishly tries to fit in with a crowd
whose breeding is so different from his own.</P>
<P>   Filmed in Rouen, "The Taste of Others" (or, if you prefer,
"Le gout des autres") highlights the tribulations of successful
businessman Castella (Jean-Pierre Bacri), married to a
neurotic interior decorator, Angelique (Christiane Miller)--a
dog-owning woman whose taste in home decor is as
excessive as is preference for animals to human beings. 
Bourgeois in her desire to attend performances of artsy plays
by the likes of Racine--though neither liking nor
understanding their purport--she drags her reluctant husband
to a performance of "Berenice," at which time he becomes
swiftly and grandly infatuated with its title character played by
the 40-year-old Clara (Anne Alvaro).  Determined to press his
suit with her, he propels himself into her world of actors,
director, and crew and despite their attempts to get rid of him. 
They regularly make fun of his philistinism and 
ultimately exploit him for his money, the starry-eyed executive
sees no evil.</P>
<P>   Jaoui imbues the screen with an ensemble of Castella's
satellites, including his bored bodyguard Moreno (Gerard
Lanvin) and his chauffer, Deschamps (Alain Chabat)--both of
whom pursue an affair with Manie, an independent-minded
barmaid (Agnes Jaoui) who would like to be married.  She is
reluctant, however, to accept the proposal of a conventional
man whom she likes but who'd insist on transforming her
from a popular barkeep and hashish dealer into a
housekeeper who'd devote her years to taking care of his
children.  Among the miserable characters, Clara shrugs off
the applause of her theater fans, depressed by her inability to
find a father for the children she would like to have.</P>
<P>   Any among us who have ever been embarrassed by a
friend who acts inappropriately in our presence--by telling
scatalogical jokes to a group of cultivated people more
interested in discussing Ibsen or by casually and obliviously
insulting gays while in the presence of a couple of
homosexuals--will treasure Bacri's appearance at the table of
a crew of aesthetes.  They scoff at his boorish choice of
expressions while at the same time leaving him clueless
about the source of their animosity.  The ensemble is so
sublime that we'd have difficulty singling out any of the
players for special merit.  Jaoui's carefree demeanor is
contrasted with Alvaro's nervous energy while Bacri's
churlishness contradicts the grace and artistic intelligence of
the theater company.  </P>
<P>   Ms. Jaoui had intimated in an interview communicated in
the production notes that no matter how open-minded we'd
like to think we all are, we can expect any attempts on our
part to cross social borders mighty difficult if not
heartbreaking.  She adds that from the time we've all been in
grade school we've tried to fit into one clique or another,
occasionally getting rejected while clueless about the cause. 
As we look back on the so-called good-old days of our youth-
-a time actually charged with heartbreaks and pathos--we can
perhaps grin at our naivete, our grandiosity in believing that
everyone would love us as much as did our mothers. 
Distancing ourselves from the afflictions of our youth, we
Monday morning quarterbacks can now react with greater
understanding of the errors of our ways.  Mercifully, time
heals, but for the mostly hapless folks who populate Ms.
Jaoui's wonderful film with its exquisitely observed
personalities, the taste of others has been bittersweet at best.</P>
