<PRE>"The Circle"</PRE>
<P>In a nation where a woman cannot even buy a bus ticket without her
husband's permission or smoke a cigarette in public, much less obtain an
abortion, director Jafar Panahi delves into the lives of women on the wrong
side of the law in Iran in "The Circle."</P>
<P>>From the very start of "The Circle" we are thrust into the alien,
male-dominated society of Iran that treats its women as possessions, not
people. An old woman stands outside the small door to a hospital maternity
ward. The door slides opens and a nurse tells her that her daughter has had
a beautiful baby girl. The door slides shut. Obviously agitated, the woman
knocks at the door and asks another nurse about the baby's sex. Again,
"it's an adorable girl," she is told. "They'll want a divorce!" she moans
about her in-laws as she dejectedly leaves the hospital.</P>
<P>This extended scene of despair summarizes the film's theme of the harsh
life for women, especially an ex-convict, in Iran. The old woman's misery
is just the lead into one of the most powerful, thought-provoking and
eye-opening films to come to the screen this year. Iran's Islamic society
stridently keeps women in a second-class, subservient role where the men
running the country define a woman's "rights". Conditions, from a western
viewpoint, are severe, at best, for the average Iranian woman.  Panahi's
"circle" of women is an even more harshly treated subgroup - the sisterhood
of women who served time in Iranian prison.</P>
<P>As the old woman leaves the hospital, she crosses paths with three younger
women, dressed head to toe in the black robes and the ever-ready chadir
required by Islamic law. There is something wrong as they try to make a
phone call to a friend who can help get tickets for the three to flee the
city, hopefully to a place where the air is not so oppressive. But, no one
answers the phone. Desperate for money, one of them takes their one
valuable possession, a slender gold necklace, and tries to sell it on the
street. A scuffle ensues and she (though not the men she tries to sell the
trinket to) is arrested, as her friends look on helpless to intervene.</P>
<P>Arezou (Maryiam Parvin Almani) and Nargess (Nargess Mamizadeh) now must
fend for themselves. The older Arezou takes the little money they have and
gets Nargess onto a bus that she hopes will bring her young friend back to
the wonderful world of her childhood. It doesn't and Nargess must seek out
another convict, Pari (Fereshteh Sadr Orafai), for help. The story shifts
to Pari, who has her own set of problems. She's a prison escapee, single
and pregnant, not a safe combination for a woman and Pari goes to another
prison sister for assistance. The story then weaves in a heart rendering
tale about a pretty little girl, dressed in her best clothes, abandoned by
her unwed mother (Fatemah Naghavi) in hopes that she'll be taken by good
and kind people.</P>
<P>The end of the film bookends the beginning with another small door sliding
shut. The finality of this action closes out a story that leaves you
pondering just how it would feel to live under such repression, always
fearful and always vulnerable. It's a story about a man's world shown from
the woman's view and it's not an appealing picture of life in Iran. But, it
is a beautifully made film by the maker of the wonderful childhood story,
"The White Balloon," showing Panahi's deft versatility as a world-class
filmmaker.</P>
<P>The cinema verite-style camerawork helps carry forward the tension these
women live with, day to day, as they strive to survive and stay out of
prison - and it doesn't take much to get sent to prison. The look of the
film, coupled with the natural efforts by the actresses, makes it feel
real, almost documentary-like, and brings us to see a very different social
order. "The Circle" is a powerhouse of a film and I give it an A.</P>
