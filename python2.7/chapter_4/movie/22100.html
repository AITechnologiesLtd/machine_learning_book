<PRE>"Toy Story 2" Review
by Fontaine Lien
Warning: Contains plot information</PRE>
<P>I remember three years ago, after seeing "Toy Story," I came out of
the theater mystified, a believer.  The film had managed to disarm my
natural defense against "animated movies" and capture my heart and
imagination.  Those of you who know me know I often cite Owen
Gleiberman's comment on "Toy Story" when describing a wonderful film:
"[It was] the art of dreaming when you're wild awake," or something like
that.  When I heard that a sequel was being planned, I was doubtful. 
After
all, how many *good* Hollywood sequels can you name?  "Speed II," "The
Lost World," "Lethal Weapon IV" certainly do not make the list.</P>
<P>I am overjoyed to report after three years, a high school diploma,
and numerous changes in life, I enjoyed "Toy Story 2" tremendously, if
not
more than the first one, and I trust that adults everywhere will enjoy
it
too.  An old recipe never fails; this time a good result has come out of
recycling old formats.  "Toy Story 2" features the same characters, the
same hilarity, the same bright picturesque scenery, even a similar
story. 
Tim Allen and Tom Hanks again bring their considerable voice talents to
the characters; Joan Cusack and Wayne Knight (why am I not surprised :)
also join the superb voice cast.  This time it is Buzz Lightyear who
rushes
to the rescue of Woody, the toys are in more danger and they face bigger
obstacles, such as a flyaway airplane instead of a runaway moving truck. 
But basically, the idea remained the same.  Toys should look out for
toys,
and there is nothing more precious than the bond toys share with their
owners.  Most of my favorite characters, including the T-rex, Mr. Potato
Head, Slinky, and the cute little aliens, returned; ingenious new
creations
also surfaced, such as Andy's pet puppy (which we only heard bark in the
original).   The film is eye candy itself, needless to say, and it's
like
putting on 3-D lenses and looking at the world.  Everything takes on
another dimension, bright dazzling colors and textures, and an ethereal
quality.  </P>
<P>I will not bore you with inane details, because anyone who has seen
"Toy Story" will understand how glad I am that the folks at Pixar stuck
to
what they excelled at instead of trying to introduce new gimmicks.  Yes,
I
could have done without the Star Wars references or the stock character
of Stinky Pete, but in general the film delighted and entertained.  
There is
nothing more joyous than being transported to another realm of complete
make-believe, non-stop action adventure, laughs, and artistic wizardry. 
Children love storytelling time, and apparently so do grown-ups like me. 
"Toy Story 3" or "The New Adventures of Buzz and Woody"?  I sure hope
so.</P>
