<PRE>[comedy/satire/science fiction]</PRE>

<P>Seen Sunday, November 2, 1997 at 2:20 p.m. at the Crossgates Mall Cinema 12
(Guilderland, N.Y.), theater #6 [?], with my brother John for $4.75. [Theater
rating: ***: good seats, picture, and sound] </P>
<P>Movies geared towards massive audiences tend not to be too complicated or
have much intelligence to them. Americans especially like to watch things
they don't have to think too much about. What's good about "Men In Black" is
that, technically, it's another lightweight, mass-market comedy/adventure,
but it's also a clever satire. It appeals to both the child and the adult in
us.</P>
<P>It's difficult to make a film intended for the family that can actually be
enjoyed by all members.  But this movie starts off well by displaying its
ability to do just that. The first scene depicts a truck full of illegal
aliens which is stopped by highway patrolmen, until two men in black suits
show up and take over. Agent K (Jones) singles out one of the immigrants and
brings him back into the desert where his true identity is revealed. He's an
illegal alien all right - one from another planet who doesn't have a
passport. </P>
<P>The dialogue between K and the alien is cartoony, but witty, in a
"Simpson's" sort of way. Even though there's a slimy sight gag, it was built
up through satire, which shows how the comedy succeeds on many levels.</P>
<P>Satire derives its power from great acting. Anyone can write a joke, but it
takes talent to make subtle comedy funny. Tommy Lee Jones is fantastic here
as the Joe Friday-like Agent K. His sense of timing is perfect and his
deadpan delivery makes everything he says or does seem both serious and
funny. </P>
<P>Then there's his counterpart, the always hyperactive Will Smith as James
Edwards, an NYPD officer who is asked to join "Men in Black" (the secret
agency K works for), because of an encounter he had with an alien.  Many
consider Smith a typecast actor who always plays characters like himself -
but it doesn't matter because he's hilarious! It seems like he improvises
every joke and gag, yet he never repeats himself.</P>
<P>The actual plot of the film involves some kind of pending inter-galactic war
with Earth in the middle. Agents J and K's job is to find a "bug" (D'Onofrio
as "Edgar") whose ship crash-landed on a farm in upstate New York. He has
made his way to NYC and wreaks havoc like a zombie in an Ed Wood movie, and
if they don't find him soon something terrible is going to happen. </P>
<P>There's a lot of detail and attention given to the MIB operation, which not
only makes the comedy even funnier and the satire more clever, but shows how
the film doesn't cop-out where most others would. Everything the characters
do has a purpose, and there's a good sense of mystery here. At times I wasn't
quite sure what was going on, but because the story is so lighthearted I was
never hopelessly lost.</P>
<P>Not much more needs to be said about the film because the comedy is so
broad. It would be difficult to list even a few examples without describing,
in detail, the context in which they take place. Everything's just plain fun,
and the ending is a real hoot.</P>
<P>Special mention must be given to Linda Fiorentino as Dr. Laurel Weaver, the
sexy coroner who never plays the role of the damsel in distress nor the
butt-kicking, "strong-willed woman" stereotype. </P>
<P>"Men In Black" is the epitome what the summer blockbuster movie should be:
just plain fun.</P>
