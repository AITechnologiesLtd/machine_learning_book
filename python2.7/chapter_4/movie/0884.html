<PRE>                            THE GODFATHER PART III
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  The Corleone saga continues in another
     story of honor and revenge.  This is not the Best Picture of
     1990 but it is good enough that it will probably be nominated
     for that honor.  While it is less than totally original,
     major similarities to the other parts may well go unnoticed.
     (The afterword to this review is a spoiler.)  Rating: high +2
     (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     In these days of making popular films into series, by far the most
respected series is the now three-part "Godfather" saga.  Both THE GODFATHER
and THE GODFATHER PART II won the Best Picture Academy Award and it is very
likely we will be seeing a campaign to get THE GODFATHER PART III the same
award.  No sequel other than THE GODFATHER PART II has ever won Best
Picture.  The series has even outlived the accuracy of the title, since
Michael Corleone was certainly not the Godfather in PART I, and seems only
rarely to use the title of "Godfather."  In many ways this is also the most
deserving of being a series since the stories really do build on each other
and lose a great deal if viewed out of order.  There is now authenticity
from the fact that when a character remembers an event from years earlier,
the audience also remembers it from a point in time that is genuinely years
earlier for them.  If Michael remembers the death of his first wife many
years ago, I also remember it from eighteen years ago.</P>
<P>     It is not that there is really such original writing.  In many ways we
are repeatedly seeing the same story.  (For fear of spoilers I can list only
some superficial parallels here and will say more in the afterward.)  Each
film starts with a long sequence that is a celebration of an important
family event: a wedding, a confirmation, an award from the Pope.  Each also
concludes with a family event.  One thinks of the films as being about the
family business but, in fact, the subject is very rarely even mentioned.
There is very little about how the Corleones acquire their money.  Instead,
these films are almost exclusively about meta-business issues such as the
politics of dealing with the competition; the issue arises in each film.
Perhaps the reason for the chosen concentration is that the Corleones would
be much less sympathetic if the films were about their day-to-day business.
Even visual touches are repeated.  There is always a scene in the Corleone
kitchen with a big pot on the stove.</P>
<P>     As the film opens Michael Corleone--do I really have to say he is
played by Al Pacino?--is still trying to whitewash the family name and to
live up to the nobility of the name Corleone (Lionheart).  He has
contributed vast sums of money to charitable works.  At one point we see a
hospital named for Vito Corleone and probably not because Vito provided them
with patients.  At the opening Michael is contributing $100,000,000 for
poverty relief for Sicily and receiving the order of San Sebastian from the
Pope.  Of note is that there is far less of the ethnic Italian feel to this
event than there was at Connie's wedding.  The Corleones are apparently
assimilating American styles.  Michael feels that he is finally achieving
legitimacy and respectability.</P>
<P>     But there is a problem with Vincent Mancini (played by Andy Garcia)
who, despite the surname, is the son of Sonny Corleone (played by James Caan
in Parts I and II).  Vincent is the most likely heir to the family business,
but he is also something of a loose cannon.  He is as temperamental and
power-hungry as his father was.  Vincent has a feud with his current boss, a
hood named Joey Zasa (played by Joe Mantegna).</P>
<P>     Vincent is attracted to Michael's daughter, Mary.  In fact, the choice
of the plain-looking Sofia Coppola, the director's daughter, for Mary
instead of the originally cast attractive Winona Ryder may actually work for
the film.  Coppola is not a great actress but putting a less attractive
woman in the role creates interesting speculation as to Vincent's motives.
There is no great mystery as to why Vincent would be interested in a woman
as attractive as Winona Ryder.  But Vincent has an eye for good-looking
women and the power-hungry nephew's interest in Mary could well be power
rather than physical attraction.  In any case, Michael is dead set against a
relationship between these two grandchildren of Vito Corleone.  It is
Vincent's feud and Michael's relation with the Vatican that are the
springboard for this third story.</P>
<P>     Michael's other child is Anthony who, like the young Michael, wants no
part of the family business and wants instead to sing grand opera.  In fact,
his debut performance at La Scala, in the lead no less, becomes an important
event in the film.  The choice of opera, Pietro Mascagni's "Cavalleria
Rusticana," is of course highly appropriate.  The title literally translates
to "Rustic Chivalry" and refers to the code of honor of the poor Sicilians
of the story.  The concept of this Sicilian code of honor pervades the
"Godfather" films as well as the opera.  The emphasis on this-favor-for-
that-favor, how one treats the Don, and symbolic gestures such as "the Kiss
of Death" are equally  important in the series and in this opera of the
hatred of Turridu and Alfio.  In the time-honored Sicilian custom, Alfio
challenges Turridu by embracing him and Turridu signifies he accepts the
challenge by biting Alfio's ear.  Naturally, the opera ends in bloodshed.
The sweetly melancholic Intermezzo from "Cavalleria Rusticana" may already
be familiar to filmgoers from its use in RAGING BULL.  Coppola uses it in
THE GODFATHER PART III to underscore the final scenes of the film.</P>
<P>     So does this new film live up to its predecessors?  It is flawed, of
course, but then PART II diluted its effect by jumping around in time to
pick up pieces of storyline both before and after the first film.  That was
the flaw that television thought it could correct when it re-edited the
first two parts into one chronological story.  (Comments on that effort will
appear in my afterword.)  The third film is no more flawed and probably in a
league with the first two.  I would rate it a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.
(In case you're curious, I would rate THE GODFATHER a +3 and THE GODFATHER
PART II a high +2.)
[Spoiler follows]</P>
<P>     Spoiler-afterword: Earlier in this review I talked about a repeating
structure in the "Godfather" films.  Let me be more detailed.  The films
always start with a major family event and they always end with a bloodbath
that coincides with another major family event: baptism, marriage-
separation, son's operatic debut at La Scala.  In each case Michael is
trying to make himself or his whole family legitimate, but he is stymied.
There is some unspeakable act committed by an apparent enemy: the Tataglias,
the Rosatos, Joey Zasa.  Michael decides his honor and the general safety of
the family demand revenge.  However, the perpetrator is only the apparent
enemy.  The real enemy pulling the strings does not show his face except as
an apparent peacemaker: Barzini, Roth, Altobello.  In the end the ersatz
peacemaker and all his co-conspirators are dispatched in the bloodbath that
spans only hours or minutes.  This strikes me as being too strong a parallel
in structure to be just coincidence.  It, in fact, goes beyond formula.
Each film is a repetition of the same melodrama.  Michael is trying to be
good.  Someone interprets this as weakness and moves against him.  The urge
for revenge with Sicilian anger takes over.  Vito's mother, too, promised
Don Cicci that she and Vito would not take action against him and asked for
peace.  He murdered her in cold blood.  Vito's Sicilian revenge must wait
for the proper time but honor demands it.  Vito's son Michael replays this
melodrama in each film.</P>
<P>     I did not see the television re-editing in which the first two parts
were edited so they told one story in chronological order.  I have been told
it is an improvement.  I find it hard to believe, however, since each story
is a re-telling of an instance of Michael repeating his father's tragedy.
Re-editing would violate the internal structure.  The "improved" version
sounds too much like taking Shakespeare's HENRY IV Parts I and II and HENRY
V, editing them together to make one long play, then showing it over five
nights with commercials.</P>
