<PRE>                            DOLORES CLAIBORNE
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1995 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(*** out of four)</PRE>
<P>     Yet another movie that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that
Stephen King can tell a compelling story without falling back on the
traditional elements of horror and the supernatural.  DOLORES CLAIBORNE
is also the second three-star King film to star Kathy Bates (the first
was MISERY).  Bates plays Dolores Claiborne, a feisty old woman who's
been accused of treating her aging employer to a fatal fall down the
stairs.  What makes the small-town detective that much more obsessed
with putting Claiborne in jail is the fact that Claiborne was also the
defendant of a murder trial eighteen years ago, the only one of his 86
cases that hasn't been solved.  She was acquitted of a crime that may
or may not have been an accident.  Her abusive husband fell down a well
and died, even though Baby Jessica was down there to break his fall.</P>
<P>     Claiborne's daughter, Selena (could have sworn she was murdered
too?), played by Jennifer Jason-Leigh, hears of the most recent
accusations against her mother and comes home for the first time in
years.  We learn through flashbacks that Dolores worked as a maid for
the dead woman for over twenty-five years and toward the end all they
had were each other, even though there was a mutual dislike between the
two.  And Selena soon begins having flashbacks too (those things are
more contagious than yawns) and recovers a few repressed memories that
prove to her that her dad wasn't quite the guy she thought he was.  For
starters, on more than one occasion, he made her bruise his fruit.  Tag
his cattle.  Slap his salami.  Bridle his horse.  Crash his bumper
car.  You get the picture, although I'm sure you wish you didn't.</P>
<P>     DOLORES CLAIBORNE is a dark thriller with plenty of drama and
suspense.  Bates does the complicated world of eccentric King
characters justice once again in an excellent performance.  Sure, she's
not the usual emaciated, glamorous Hollywood model/actress.  Never
mind that 90% of men would choose Cindy Crawford over Kathy Bates (with
the other 10% choosing Fabio over both of them), Bates can act Crawford
into a mole in the ground... excuse me, a hole in the ground.  And is
it just me, or does this movie set a new record for use of the word
"bitch"?</P>
