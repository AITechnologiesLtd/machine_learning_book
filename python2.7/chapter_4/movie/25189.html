"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Later this summer, Jim Carrey will essentially play two different
characters in the same film when he portrays a man with
split-personality disorder in Me Myself & Irene.  In this superb new
epic about the trials and tribulations of a family of Hungarian Jews,
Ralph Fiennes does Carrey one better by tackling three unique (albeit
less comical) roles as he plays a different part in each generation of
the family.</P>
<P>Sunshine is as much a story of Hungary's tumultuous political upheaval
as it is a poignant tale of a family's struggle to keep itself
together.  The film covers the period between 1840 and 1989, when the
Red Curtain finally came crashing down around Eastern Europe, and is
broken into three hour-long sections that each show one generation of
the Sonnenschein family, who have prospered throughout the late 1800s
thanks to a recipe for an herbal tonic called `Taste of Sunshine' (the
film's original title) and a gold watch that is passed down from father
to son in each generation.</P>
<P>In the first story, Fiennes (The End of the Affair) plays Ignatz
Sonnenschein, a loyalist to the Austro-Hungarian Empire that rules his
country.  Against the wishes of his father, Ignatz marries his cousin
Valerie (Jennifer Ehle, Wilde) and shortens his last name to Sors to
avoid anti-Semitism in his attempt to become a powerful judge in
Budapest.  Having already alienated his father by changing the family
name, and his brother Gustave (James Frain, Where the Heart Is) by
simply not sharing his radical political ideas, Ignatz's career
ambitions threaten his relationship with Valerie as well.</P>
<P>Sunshine's second story concentrates on Adam Sors (Fiennes), the younger
son of Ignatz and Valerie.  Adam is a fencer who, like his father, must
deny his roots when he is forced to convert to Catholicism in order to
further his competitive career.  Hungary's national champion, Adam's
dreams of winning a gold medal in the 1936 Berlin Olympics are dashed by
a Nazi radio report that exposes Jews and outlines what jobs they are
not allowed to keep.  Like father, like son – Adam has trouble with the
ladies.  Happily married to Hannah (Molly Parker, Waking the Dead), Adam
has an affair with his sister-in-law Greta (Rachel Weisz, The Mummy).</P>
<P>The film's final chapter features Adam's son Ivan (Fiennes), who was one
of the few Sors to survive the Holocaust.  As a result, he's feels jaded
and guilty, and tries to avenge the past by committing himself to the
new Communist regime.  But the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, and
Ivan soon finds himself having an affair with the sultry wife (Deborah
Unger, The Hurricane) of a high-ranking party official (William Hurt,
One True Thing).</P>
<P>Sunshine comes full circle when Ivan, after being stirred by his grandma
Valerie (Rosemary Harris, My Life So Far – she's also Ehle's real-life
mother), abandons his ties to Communism and changes his name back to
Sonnenschein.  Having lived through the most harrowing experiences of
20th century Europe (both World Wars, the Holocaust and the rise of
Communism), Ivan seems to be the first person in his family who is
prepared to accept the consequences of not hiding his roots.  The final
shot of Ivan walking down a busy street in modern Budapest is
beautifully executed, and a reminder of how much has changed.</P>
<P>Brilliantly directed by István Szabó (Mephisto), who co-wrote the
haunting script with internationally acclaimed playwright Israel
Horovitz, Sunshine is truly the year's first Oscar-quality film.  It's
already won the Best Screenplay trophy at the European Film Awards,
where it also nabbed top honors for Best Actor (Fiennes) and Best
Cinematography (Lajos Koltai, The Legend of 1900) and was nominated for
Best Picture.  Sunshine was also nominated for a mind-boggling fourteen
Genie Awards (the Canadian equivalent of the Oscars), winning the prize
for Best Motion Picture of the year.</P>
<P>3:00 - R for strong sexuality including rape, and for violence, language
and nudity</P>
