<P>HOME FRIES
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)
Warner Bros. / 1:30 / 1998 / PG-13 (comedic violence, a few sex jokes)
Cast: Drew Barrymore; Luke Wilson; Catherine O'Hara; Jake Busey; Shelley 
Duvall 
Director: Dean Parisot 
Screenplay: Vince Gilligan <HR>With "Home Fries," Drew Barrymore finds herself on a roll of both 
sesame-seed and career varieties, the former because she here plays an 
employee at a southern burger joint and the latter because this young 
starlet's recent filmography has been composed of nothing but peaks. Add 
"Fries" to a menu of stellar turns in fare like "Scream," "Ever After" 
and even "The Wedding Singer," though this movie isn't likely to be as 
big a hit as either of those three. The reason: This tasty black comedy 
is being wrongly marked as a bubbly romantic confection. </P>
<P>The dark, mischievous tone will therefore jar viewers expecting what 
they've been promised by TV spots and theatrical trailers, but fans of 
films like "Grosse Pointe Blank" should have a terrific time eating up 
the many offbeat pleasures "Home Fries" has to offer. Chief among them 
is seeing Luke Wilson, star of the indie great "Bottle Rocket," finally 
nail a lead role in a major studio picture; other charms include a plum 
role for Catherine O'Hara and a keen screenplay that combines 
disarmingly sweet characters with murder, mayhem and a few helicopter 
chases. </P>
<P>One such action sequence kicks off the movie, as a chopper navigated by 
two National Guardsmen (Wilson and Jake Busey) ends up scaring a 
middle-aged man to death. Turns out the pilots are the dead guy's 
stepsons, ordered by their domineering mom (O'Hara) to do away with him. 
To give away much else would risk ruining the increasingly surprising 
story, but a later destination worth noting is that Wilson's Dorian 
takes a part-time job at the local Burger-Matic, where he works 
alongside pregnant drive-thru cashier Sally (Barrymore). Sally, of 
course, has a more sinister connection to Dorian than she first 
suspects. </P>
<P>"Home Fries" eventually rushes towards an uncanny courtship between 
Sally and Dorian, and due to the adorably passive charisma of the 
actors, the sparks don't fly as much as they hover. A lesser movie might 
have run into a problem area there, but this low-key, fast-food romance 
seems perfectly rational in such a warped universe. Only helping matters 
is that Barrymore and Wilson are eternally likeable performers; how they 
turn a Lamaze class interlude into subtle, grin-inducing physical comedy 
without a gag-inducing sap factor is remarkable. </P>
<P>Though the ending fails to tie up the loose ends of some of the more 
convoluted story threads, "Home Fries" still ranks as an oddball 
delight, one that perhaps seems less askew given that the script was 
penned by "X-Files" producer Vince Gilligan. Credit him for creating an 
atypical combination of person and place that's worth a repeat visit, 
and credit debut director Dean Parisot for handling the material just 
right. Some may arguably carp that these collective efforts have 
produced the textbook definition of a "smallish film," but even so, 
"Home Fries" is still a side order that satisfies on its own.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"The most ethical guy on the production must have been Norman Hollyn, 
the editor, because he didn't cut anybody out, and there must have been 
people willing to do him big favors to get out of this movie." -Roger 
Ebert on "Mad Dog Time"</P>
