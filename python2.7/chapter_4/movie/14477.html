of ****)</P>
<P>Director Jacques Demy and composer Michel Legrand's 1967 musical follow-up
to their classic 1964 jazz opera _The_Umbrellas_of_Cherbourg_ is by no
means the masterpiece that film was, but it is not without its frothy
charms.  Catherine Deneuve, who also starred in _Umbrellas_, and her
real-life sister, Francoise Dorleac, respectively play fraternal twin
sisters Delphine and Solange Garnier.  Delphine is a dancer; Solange is a
composer, and both have dreams that stretch beyond the boundaries of their
small hometown of Rochefort--first and foremost being finding true love.
Little do they know that their perfect matches are also wandering the local
streets: poet/artist/sailor Maxence (Jacques Perrin) and American composer
Andy Miller (Gene Kelly), respectively.  Delphine and Solange's mother
(Danielle Darrieux) also pines for a true love--a lost one--who, yes, also
happens to be in town: music shop owner Simon Dame (Michel Piccoli).  These
six characters constantly run into each other, but, of course, each just as
constantly misses his or her match.</P>
<P>Although much of _Rochefort_'s creative team, from the director, composer,
and lead actress to many of the dubbed-in singing voices are the same as
those of _Umbrellas_, the two films could not be more different.  While
_Umbrellas_ was entirely sung but without a single dance number,
_Rochefort_ is a more traditional musical, with spoken interludes between
lavish production numbers and wall-to-wall dancing.  But the most crucial
difference is the tone; where the heartbreaking _Umbrellas_ was tragically
bittersweet, _Rochefort_ is unremittingly sunny, which fits the light
storyline.  However, all the lightness makes this film, unlike the
emotionally sweeping _Umbrellas_, a completely disposable entertainment.
Nonetheless, _Rochefort_, while an overlong 125 minutes, is a delightful
confection, made all the sweeter by Legrand's jazzy, toe-tapping score,
Bernard Evein's candy-colored production design, and the energetic cast.</P>
