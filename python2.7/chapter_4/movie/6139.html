<P>    THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT is my favorite bad movie of the year, even
better than BARB WIRE, DIABOLIQUE, or, dare I say the name?, MARY
REILLY.  Sure, it's as fowl as any turkey of times past, but this
mega-million dollar Renny Harlin-Geena Davis-Shane Black bomb is never
off-putting.  That is to say, it's awful fun.  The major misstep is the
casting of Mrs. Renny Harlin as an amnesiac house- wife who awakens one
day to discover that she's really a former anti-assassin for the U.S.
Government.  Geena Davis has the pumped- up physique and, yes, the same
wide-eyed exuberance that passed for characterization in CUTTHROAT
ISLAND.  What's missing, though, is the *steel* behind the sheen.  You
just don't believe that she wants to kick your ass.  (Memo to Mr.
Harlin:  in the interest of preserving not one but two careers, please
stop attempting to cast your wife as an action hero.  She's about as
well-suited to that role as Demi Moore is at playing strippers.  Just.
don't. do it.)</P>
<P>     Compounding the confounding is a story structure that reveals her
secret at the very beginning of the movie, I mean RIGHT THERE IN THE
OPENING CREDITS.  (Arrive late?  No problem!  The filmmakers also
include a scene or two or three of the bad guys getting ready to get
Geena.) This "tipping of the hand" is a 100-proof mystery- killer-- the
audience ends up knowing too much too soon and that knowledge drains the
suspense right out of the story.  The rest of the movie is reduced to
red-stained catch-up, with Harlin trying his hardest to generate the
tension that should've been there from the beginning.  Instead of
intrigue we get pumped-up peril, very little of which excites the way it
should:  Mommy ambushed at home, Mommy sprayed with bullets in a bus
station, Mommy hitting a deer and wrecking the car on her way home from
a Christmas party.  (Has anyone figured out the purpose of that last
scene?  Other than the guilty pleasure of seeing someone snap Bambi's
neck?)</P>
<P>     Thank God for Samuel L. Jackson.  His low-rent private dick is the
perfect foil to Le Femme Nondescript.  In addition to adding some much-
needed humanity to the movie, he's the most colorful character in the
cast.  Tearing into writer Shane Black's delicious dialogue, Jackson
walks away with nearly every scene, except when upstaged by Brian Cox
(CHAIN REACTION, THE GLIMMER MAN).  The original Hannibal Lecter (look
it up) submits a priceless monologue about a dog and where it likes to
lick itself.  (BTW, has anyone transcribed that exchange?  Please
e-mail, if so.) The Brit is gone before long, but Jackson is on hand for
the duration and he's so fun to watch, even when reduced to little more
than a spectator to the various explosive set-pieces that get
progressively bigger, bolder, and brain-dead.  After all, this *is* a
movie by Renny Harlin, the guy who directed CLIFFHANGER and DIE HARD 2,
which means you can expect a basement explosion that's pretty cool and
one whammy of a tanker- truck wreck, with Davis hanging-ten a la Arnold
in TERMINATOR 2.  The final fireball is the best and almost beats the
pyrotechnics in INDEPEDENCE DAY.  Not bad for a bad movie.  </P>
