<PRE>"Down To Earth" -- Fall from Grace
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>Here's a little bit of film history.  In 1941, a
well-received film called "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" was
released, which told the story of a boxer who
accidentally dies before his time and is reincarnated
in the body of a murdered millionaire.  Decades later
in the late 70s, "Heaven Can Wait" was released, which
told the story of an NFL quarterback who accidentally
dies before his time and is reincarnated in the body
of a murdered millionaire.  Now, we have "Down to
Earth," which tells the story of a comic that
accidentally dies before his time and yada, yada,
yada.</P>
<P>This tepid little reincarnation of two arguably much
better films focuses on struggling comic, Lance Barton
(Chris Rock).  His ultimate goal is to perform at the
Apollo theatre without getting booed off the stage. 
But he is prematurely sent to Heaven.  Too bad for
Lance.  Now, he'll never get to make that appearance
and he won't be able to meet that cute girl that he
saw crossing the street.</P>
<P>Even Heaven makes a mistake now and then.  Yet, while
he can be returned among the living, he can't have his
old body back.  That's just the way it goes, and with
the help of two Angel chaperones (Eugene Levy and
Chazz Palminteri), they help Lance look for a new one
to inhabit.  </P>
<P>Lance finally settles on the body of billionaire
Charles Wellington after discovering that he is the
object of attention of that aforementioned cute girl. 
He not only gets a rare second chance to make good on
his unfulfilled dreams of stardom but also gets the
opportunity to affect some positive changes on the
lives that he touches.</P>
<P>There's no burst of creativity here.  You'll also be
disappointed with its screenplay, which is
unforgivingly underdeveloped.  One of its two major
sins is that there are too many elements that are left
dangling.  Foremost is the fact that
Lance-as-Wellington, along with his money and power,
can really do some good.  But, everything that he says
and does seems to be just an excuse to test out his
comedic material.  At a board meeting regarding the
privatization of a community clinic, for instance, he
enters a Johnny Cochrane state-of-mind.  "If he's shot
in the head; give him a bed.  If he's bloody; he's our
buddy," he riffs to the dismay of the greedy
stakeholders.  This is funny material that establishes
Rock's comedic presence.  But, it doesn't take the
movie anywhere.  Why can't he make those
white-collared pruneheads see the error of their ways?</P>
<P>A more shameful sin, though, is its lack of funny
moments.  Rock has three or four decent sequences that
make us smile.  It's cute watching Lance-as-Wellington
(who is seen as a white, portly, balding, 50-year old
man) sway to rapper DMX and 'act black' in Harlem. 
But the film spends too much time making Rock, whose
acting seems amateurish, into a romantic leading man. 
Part of the problem also lies in the fact that this
film is rated only PG-13 while the amiable comic with
eyes-bigger-than-a-cue-ball and
teeth-as-bright-as-a-flashlight does his best stuff in
an R-rated environment.  Here, he looks desperate to
utter the "F" word.  What we get here is a manic comic
that is unfairly restrained, a story that has too many
loose ends, and a film that only Chris Rock fans would
really enjoy.</P>
