<PRE>                             WHITE MAN'S BURDEN
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     About twenty minutes into the movie it became clear what point
writer/director Desmond Nakano wished to make:  What if black people
changed places with white?  What if everything were reversed and the
blacks owned the factories, that racist black cops beat up whites as
the white police did with Rodney King?   What if all the indignities
blacks frequently suffer at the hands of many whites were reversed?</P>
<P>     Once having gotten that understanding and, because I have always
been a fighter for racial and religious equality, I did not need a
movie to bring it into focus for me.   More importantly, would those
who are racist go see such a movie or would word of mouth tell them the
film is heavy-handed and then not go see it?  I'm inclined to think
that would be the case ... which is a pity.</P>
<P>     Director Nakano says that if "white Man's Burden" can jar viewers
out of their usual polarized complacency and provoke genuine dialogue
on race, then it will have succeeded in its intent.  This film is very
unlikely to accomplish that, however honorable and worthy its
intentions.</P>
<P>     Louis (John Travolta) works in a factory where all the employees
are white, the one exception being the executive who runs the place.
Louis is a hard worker; he does more than is expected.  When a package
has to be delivered to the factory's owner, Thaddeus Thomas (Harry
Belafonte), he volunteers to do it.  Arriving at the gated entrance to
the estate, the maid, via phone, tells him to bring the package around
to the side of the house.</P>
<P>     Inside the house, the family and friends, all elegantly attired,
and served by a white maid, are departing after dinner.  This is one
very rich, high society family.   As Louis is standing, package in
hand, waiting for someone to come and accept it, Thomas' wife has just
finished with her shower and is taking off her towel while standing at
an open window, at which point Thomas sees Louis and assumes he is a
Peeping Tom.  When the maid had told Louis to go to the side of the
house, she meant the other side.</P>
<P>     The package is accepted by the maid.  Louis, next day, approaches
his black manager and asks if he could become a foreman as the current
foreman is leaving, and "as you know, I have been a hard worker for
nine years here."  Instead, he is fired.  The explanation which Louis
ekes out is that the boss does not want Peeping Toms employed at his
plant.</P>
<P>     Louis is desperate.  He has not ever earned enough to support his
wife and two children and now he is being canned.  In the evening, in
despair, he goes for a walk.  He sits at the curb.  A police car with two
black policemen jump out of their car and command him to raise his
hands.  When he asks what that is all about they begin to club him even
while he is lying on the ground covering his bloody head with his
hands.  (A robbery had recently occurred and the description of the
robber fit Louis.)  [All whites look alike?]  When the police discover
he is not the robber, they say "Sorry about that" and take off in their
patrol car.</P>
<P>     Attempts by Louis to meet with Mr. Thomas and explain meets with
rejection.  Mr. Thomas does not want to talk with him. At this point,
the desperate Louis points a gun at Mr. Thomas in order to force him to
listen  and get his job back.  What follows is a kidnapping.</P>
<P>     It is quite obvious that the movie has a real, and important story
to tell but I do not think this film is the one to do it.</P>
<P>     Tom Bower plays Louis' homeless friend who does not want to get
involved with the kidnaping.  Kelly Lynch has the role of Louis' wife
trying to make ends meet.</P>
