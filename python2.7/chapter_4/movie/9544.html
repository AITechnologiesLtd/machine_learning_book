<PRE>SWIMMING WITH SHARKS (1995)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: George Huang
Starring: Kevin Spacey, Frank Whaley, Michelle Forbes, Benicio Del Toro</P>
<P>I hated my last boss.  I mean it.  He was a giant schmuck who, after two
years of service, one of them being without a doubt the most competent
worker in my field of work, gave me a total of five raises, culminating
at the current minimum wage while my peers were being promoted to the
better next level (cook - I was a busboy, by the way).  He was also too
moody, often acting like a total asshole, which was different than him
being only a quarter of an asshole the rest of the time.  I mean, I was
afraid to even approach this guy to tell him the sink was clogged.  I
know that if I had the chance to literally bit the shit out of him
without anyone knowing about it and no repurcussions for my actions, I
would have done it.</P>
<P>That's what this film does...well, sorta.  It also gives a satirical
look at Hollywood, but it seemed only secondary to the whole "My boss is
an asshole!" spiel.  Watching the abused employee finally enact his
revenge on his sadistic, immature boss throughout the film, between
flashbacks, is one of the most entertaining things I've ever seen.  Of
course, not all of the film is as good as watching this and laughing at
the boss mock the employee.</P>
<P>Frank Whaley plays a hopeful filmmaker, and recent graduate of film
school, who lands a temporary desk job at a film company, acting as the
secreatary to one of the executives of the company, Buddy (Kevin Spacey,
the year he was in four films and became a superstar and in one of his
most memorably flawless performances).  The outgoing secretary (Benicio
Del Toro, stealing scenes as usual) warns him that he'll become a
bitter, coffee-downing, chain-smoking nervous wreck but will finally
settle into cynicism, but Frank's optimistic.</P>
<PRE>Then he meets Buddy.</PRE>
<P>Buddy is the most childish excuse for a man.  A selfish, immature
asshole who makes my boss look like Mother Teresa (God rest her
overlooked soul, since Di's death overshadowed that of the most
selfless, caring person since Jesus).  He humiliates him from the first
sentence, and mocks him sadistically throughout the film, uses him for
his own personal gain, treats him like a slave, and drives him into near
insanity.</P>
<P>Also going on in poor Frank's life is a relationship with another
selfish woman (Michelle Forbes), who is also in the film business, has
slept her way to the top, and may be using Frank to sleep her way into
Buddy's services.  But she claims to really care about him, even when
he's sleeping into insanity and possible homicidal tendencies.</P>
<P>In the beginning (and gradually throughout the film, since the past is
told through flashbacks), Frank walks into Buddy's house with a gun,
ties him down to a chair, and proceeds to torture him in some original
and not-so-original ways (to get an idea how cool it is, he uses an
envelope to give him some uncomfortable paper cuts).  The plot twists a
bit, we laugh some more, then things get dark and kinda depressing.</P>
<P>While the torture scenes and flashbacks are well done, the ending is too
dark for what happens.  It works well, but this whole obsession with
being brooding and overly serious doesn't mesh well with the black
comedy of the first hour or so.  But other than that, this is a really
funny black comedy that satisfies anyone's needs to ever beat up their
awful, power-hungry bosses.  And, it even says a bit about how horrible
those nasty Hollywood-ites.  But, we all knew that anyway, didn't we?</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
