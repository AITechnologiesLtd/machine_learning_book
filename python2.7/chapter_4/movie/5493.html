<PRE>                                LA JETEE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     LA JETEE is a 1962 black and white short film now in rerelease at
some of the art houses.  Besides being an innovative and acclaimed film
in its own right, it was the basis for last year's popular and
controversial TWELVE MONKEYS.</P>
<P>     LA JETEE is a fairly unique film in that it is all done with still
photos, except for one moving part that goes by in the blink of an eye.
The cinematography (Chris Marker) is apocalyptically done with dark,
low contrast black and white film stock.  The music (Trevor Duncan) is
suitably dramatic as fits an end of the world picture.</P>
<P>     LA JETEE starts just before the outbreak of World War III.  There
is a person referred to only as The Man (Davos Hanich) who sees The
Woman (Helene Chatelain) on the walkway at Orly Airport in Paris.
Before they come together the atomic bomb drops.</P>
<P>     Most of the movie happens underground.  People can not leave
because above ground it is a nuclear wasteland.  They try to send
people into the past and into the future via drugs so that they can
retroactively prevent the destruction in some way.  After many failed
attempts, finally The Man is successful.  The picture tells of his
adventures and considers the paradox of going back to your own past.
If you've seen TWELVE MONKEYS, you will recognize many of the
similarities.</P>
<P>     The Narrator (Jean Negroni) is the only one that speaks.  He has a
deep and dramatic voice almost like that of an announcer on an old
newsreel.  The direction and the script by Chris Marker is highly
stylized and effective.  An unusual picture that is hard to predict,
and also a film that grows on you are you are watching it.</P>
<P>     LA JETEE runs just 28 minutes, but it is so refreshing to see
something take the right amount of time rather than be lengthen to the
magical one and half to two hour mark just so it can find a theatrical
booking.  There is many a movie that has a half hour of good ideas and
no more, but is ruined by tripling its length.  The show is in French
with English subtitles.  It is not rated but probably would be PG or
PG-13 only for its subject matter.  There is no sex, nudity, bad
language or violence.  If you get a chance to see this little jewel,
take advantage of the opportunity.  I saw it on a double bill with a
dog of a movie call THE CONVENT.  I give LA JETEE ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
