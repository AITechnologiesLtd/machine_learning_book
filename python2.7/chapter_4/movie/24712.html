MAGNOLIA (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Paul Thomas Anderson</PRE>
<PRE>Screenplay: Paul Thomas Anderson</PRE>
<P>Starring: John C. Reily, Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Jeremy Blackman, April
Grace, Julianne Moore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Robards, Phillip Baker
Hall, William H. Macy, Melora Walters</P>
<P>In MAGNOLIA, Tom Cruise struts and jives, pervading his boyish voice with the
inflection of a soulful preacher, William H. Macy babbles about his past, and
Melora Walters snorts a lot of coke. Like a Robert Altman film (McCABE AND MRS.
MILLER, SHORT CUTS), Paul Thomas Anderson's (BOOGIE NIGHTS) interests lie in
communities, and the people who co-exist within them. He leaps between
disparate narratives and characters (all with comparative issues), the audience
instinctively assuming that he will eventually bring everyone together for the
finale (as is usually the case with such a film). But Anderson has something
more complex up his sleeve. Without giving too much away, MAGNOLIA is not so
much about its characters as it is about the volatile life that surrounds them.
And it's not particularly interested in traditional plot lines, but
thematically, everything relates. The film concludes in a manner, that made me
think of the lack of supremacy we have over our lives.</P>
<P>As the millennium approached, various religious zealots predicted the end of
the world. These knuckleheads made the assumption that Earth would be no more
because of a passage in the bible hinting that "something" would happen
following the commencement of the millennium. Of course nothing did, and
besides we have no idea when the millennium is; date and time are man-made and
as such we're not on any schedule! (Please excuse me for being so obvious, but
trust me, this half-hearted semi-rant is going somewhere). These kind of
sentiments have much to do with man's desire to be in control of his existence
when really he's just another "spoke on the wheel", to quote one of the
characters from MAGNOLIA. We like to think that we have control over our lives,
but the sad truth is that we have very little say in the way things ultimately
pan out: a plane could crash into our house while we lay in bed, a psycho path
might gun us down in a shopping mall, an earthquake may trap us under a
building. Life is a series of moments where we often must put our trust in the
world that we inhabit.
I don't believe that most audiences will walk out of MAGNOLIA liking it as much
as I did, or getting from it what I did. Some will say that its ending is
irrational, a "cop out", but it resonated with me, and I feel as if I "get"
what Anderson was doing. However, one somewhat vocal member of the audience did
not. This man chortled loudly at the films concluding moments, obnoxiously
proclaiming "This is ridiculous!" I don't think it is. The ending coheres with
the basic theme the movie sets up in its opening, and though it is not
traditional, it does succeed.</P>
<P>Often when a filmmaker attempts to construct his film solely out of themes, the
end result is manipulative and pretentious. But Anderson puts just as much care
into his very human characters as he does into his "plot". His story takes
place in the "real" world, so when astonishing things happen it's just as
stupefying for the characters as it is for us. They exist in their own hectic
worlds, never privy to everything that occurs around them. But we see it all,
and what it leads up to will only make sense to some of us.</P>
<P>So what is this thing about? It's about our past and how it haunts us no matter
how hard we try to escape it, and it's about a redemption that for most never
comes. But we expect it to come. Maybe those who react negatively to this film
do so because they didn't know what to expect. There is nothing predictable or
formulaic about MAGNOLIA. Anderson has brazenly gone in a direction that I
think few will comprehend (judging from the plethora of puzzled faces that I
noticed, following the screening). Audiences may like being force-fed surprise
endings (even if at times they defy logic: THE USUAL SUSPECTS), but when
presented with something that is seemingly inexplicable, they would rather
dismiss the entire film than put their thinking caps on.</P>
<P>Anderson introduces his intentions with a prologue about chance and coincidence
that is so dazzling and free from usual film constrictions, I found myself
marveling at its propulsive cleverness. Other scenes left me with the same
breathless wonder.</P>
<P>The characters are introduced in a manic ten-minute montage. Jason Robards is
an aged producer, plagued with a cancer that is slowly draining the life out of
him. Julianne Moore (essentially acting out her BOOGIE NIGHTS coke frenzy scene
for the duration of this film) plays his trophy wife. Robards is looked after
by a kind, plump nurse, Phil Parama (a slack jawed Phillip Seymour Hoffman).
Tom Cruise is Robards' estranged son, a wolfish "self help guru" who instructs
horny losers, in a profane workshop on how to pick up chicks. Cruise is
constantly over the top screaming out lines like, "Respect the cock!" with such
conviction he could be a hopped up Moses relaying the TEN COMMANDMENTS to his
people. It's a brave performance, but one that doesn't always work. Cruise has
a virtuous little boy voice, and to hear him acting with such macho indignation
is a bit like watching David Schwimmer in the Andrew Dice Clay role. Though
Cruise does put his trademark grin to good use as a mask of narcissistic
endearment; he seems to be saying, "Yeah I'm an asshole, but I'm just too damn
charming".</P>
<P>Another character is afflicted with cancer, this one game show host, Jimmy
Gator (Phillip Baker Hall). Hall speaks in an urbane, grandfatherly pitch,
textured with wisdom and worldliness. He has a likeable demeanor, and as such
it's effectively dismaying when we discover his past indiscretions. Gator's
pug-nosed, crumpled visage seems to be slowly deteriorating in guilt. He
remains estranged from his cokehead daughter, Rose (Melora Walters). Rose is so
traumatized by events in her past, that she denies herself any kind of
emotional relationship, only engaging in purely sexual ones. This doesn't stop
a kind-hearted cop (John C. Reily) from falling for her. If anyone has the most
screen time it's Reily, and that's a good thing; the actor is adept at playing
naïve, yet admirable characters. Along with Hoffman, Reily offers glimmers of
hope amid the human wreckage permeating Anderson's tale.</P>
<P>The Game Show is an old fashioned Quiz show, in which child geniuses' match
wits against challenging adults. The current child star is Stanley Spector (an
emerald eyed Jeremy Blackman). Spector is idly in the process of becoming
estranged from his loutish father. Then finally, there is a jittery William H.
Macy as former whiz kid Donnie Smith, now just plain old current loser, Donnie
Smith.
Anderson shoots this with the same audacious camera motions he employed in
BOOGIE NIGHTS. At times he seems too in love with his own film making
abilities. He utilizes expansive pans, and whooshing, stylized hand-held
movements, simultaneously jacking up the volume on the soundtrack at just the
right moment for impact. While that's a sure way to increase the energy in one
scene, it becomes a bit exhausting if over done, as is occasionally the case.
The film has constant climaxes, realizations, and emotional outbursts all
handled relatively well. In one affecting sequence Blackman breaks down on air,
directing his malice at Jimmy Gator for heaping so much pressure on innocent
children. It's a distressing moment, because the kid has no idea how to convey
his feelings; they just come bursting out of him like a flood of pent up
sentiments. The reaction is substantially real, and one that thankfully isn't
accompanied by a bullying Hollywood score.</P>
<P>Though MAGNOLIA is chock full of great actors (some of whom doing their best
work here) it is Anderson who deserves much of the credit. His dialogue and the
way the actors use it, is authentic; the characters have a certain middle class
vagueness about them. They stutter, stumble over words, and interrupt each
other like genuine people. They talk about inconsequential things, and they
don't always communicate their emotions in ways that we're used to seeing.</P>
<P>Anderson takes a big chance with this movie; it's not typically mainstream, and
not one that even many critics have agreed on. But it's well worth it for
adventurous filmgoers. At three hours, MAGNOLIA is a constantly surprising epic
that bridges the gap between the believable and the unbelievable.</P>
