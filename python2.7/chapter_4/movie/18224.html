<PRE>The Matrix
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) THE MATRIX is a great piece of eye candy. From our
normal, everyday "reality," the film travels back and forth into
Wonderland, and changes the definition of which is which.</P>
<P>Keanu Reeves is Mr. Anderson, a cubicle-dweller in an unconvincing
high-rise. His job, his life, and his caricatured boss are never
explained, and so the movie starts out flat and amateurish. It's
disappointing, but we know this soon won't matter, so we continue to
watch.</P>
<P>In his cube he receives a phone call that tells him to get out of the
building; the suits at the elevator are coming for him. Sure enough,
peering over his cube, he sees some men in black come his way. The voice
on the phone directs him to a window in the high rise, from which he's
supposed to make a difficult jump to a scaffolding. Realizing he has
nothing to hide and has no idea who the caller is, he wisely chucks the
phone and turns himself in to the suits.</P>
<P>For the first 20 minutes of the film, the suited "establishment" and the
vague "underground" fight for his attention and loyalty, warning him not
to join the other side. Neither side explains who they are or what they
want with him, but when the "underground" expose a bug planted in his
gut by the other side, he agrees to trust the underground. He is taken
to their leader, Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne). </P>
<P>THE MATRIX packs a lot of mythology into its story. Readers of Joseph
Campbell, the scholar of comparative mythology, will recognize in
"Neo's" (Reeves') story, the traditional hero's journey -- the call to
adventure, the refusal of the call, the spirit guide, the special human
ability attained by those who open themselves to it....</P>
<P>So when Morpheus offers the choice of a red pill that leads to danger,
adventure, and self-awakening; or a blue pill that leads a safe,
comfortable return to the status quo; the age-old story has already
chosen for him. Anderson (his computer name is Neo) eats the red pill
and is reborn, both mythically and visually.</P>
<P>Through the looking-glass, Neo meets the half-dozen others who have gone
before him. The small band comprises those who have awoken from their
DREAM OF reality, into reality itself, a dark cloudy world a century
into "the future." In this reality, humans and artificial intelligence
are fighting for control of the planet, and for control of each other.
Neo, the chosen one, is prophesied to be the first who can beat the
computers on their own turf (that is, in the virtual reality that is the
Matrix).</P>
<P>I suppose this nerdly premise is partly borrowed from such sources as
DARK CITY and the TERMINATOR movies. Still, the concept is sufficiently
creepy to drive the plot, and the overlay of both ALICE IN WONDERLAND
and timeless mythology adds a dash of legitimacy to the otherwise
adolescent fantasy.</P>
<P>As I said, THE MATRIX is a great piece of eye candy, and credit should
go to the visual effects supervisor John Gaeta and cinematographer Bill
Pope. Although the unflavored modern world from the first scenes is
uninspired, the later settings -- the stark white void, the bleak future
underground, and the computer-enhanced "reality" are convincing,
interesting worlds.</P>
<P>The time-changing special effects are the next evolutionary step in
cinematic gimmickry. Watch a few commercials from the last year and
you'll see what I mean -- time stopping while the camera moves, or the
speed of time changing instantly. Until now, these tricks have not been
integrated in to a feature film. They've been used as tricks to catch
your eye to sell products. </P>
<P>But the same way TERMINATOR 2 commanded the morphing technologies of the
day and actually did something with them, THE MATRIX commands these
time-shifting film tricks and folds them into a story.</P>
<P>Does that mean the film automatically deserves praise? Not necessarily.
But because it's the first big film to use this technique as part of its
story, it will be as important to film history, decades from now, as T2.
(In the short term, it means that Hollywood is going to need a new bag
of tricks.)</P>
<P>Pope (who has worked with the Wachowskis before, and with Sam Raimi)
does deserve praise. His mastery of the texture of light -- the
highlights, shadows, and reflections -- show such tight control that the
film would look just as beautiful in black and white (a feat that's
harder than you might imagine).  </P>
<P>So THE MATRIX must be an awesome movie, right?</P>
<P>Well... sort of. There are several things that keep THE MATRIX from
being perfect.</P>
<P>The first that comes to mind is the film's ending. Or rather, endings.
The first ending is a false one, and the second one has a coda. It's as
though the Wachowski brothers knew they were on a roll and didn't want
to stop. Worst of all is the final scene of the movie where "love" comes
into play from out of the blue.</P>
<P>Also lacking is the acting. Keanu is no Anthony Hopkins. It's not that
he spoils the movie -- he doesn't -- it's just a little hard to take him
seriously. Hugo Weaving (of THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE
DESERT) plays Agent Smith with a deliberately stylized persona. But even
so, his speech and mannerisms are slow, awkward, and distracting.</P>
<P>As for the film's message, there is an unhealthy moment (BEFORE we are
aware of the film's definition of "reality") where Mr. Anderson is told
that the world doesn't apply to him, that the world "has been pulled
over your eyes to hide the truth".</P>
<P>In other words, the world and all its rules, mores, and authority
figures are for everyone else, and not for him. In fact, the world is a
lie that must be DESTROYED if the truth is to be revealed. This talk
made me uneasy, particularly while the film was still in "our" reality.
If Mr. Anderson had any sociopathic tendencies, this might have
encouraged him to go postal. Watching, I knew the movie wouldn't pursue
that avenue, but the idea is disturbing enough, and THE MATRIX
illustrates it just a little too well.</P>
<P>So THE MATRIX must be a terrible movie, right?</P>
<P>Well... no. In fact, I think it's one of the better movies I've seen
this year. I liked it so much I hoped I could give it a very high
rating. But with so many things not quite right, I think it's only fair
to point them out. But if you are undeterred and are want to see it
anyway, I highly recommend it. See it on a big screen while you can. -
