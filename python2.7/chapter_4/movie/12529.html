<P>On a dark afternoon, a young man named Katadreuffe is just sworn in as a
lawyer.  The way he chooses to celebrate this achievement is to visit his
enemy, a court bailiff named Dreverhaven and slam a knife on his desk.
Later we see Katadreuffe leaving the building covered with blood.  Soon
we learn that Dreverhaven was stabbed to death with the very same knife,
and the new lawyer is arrested on suspicion of murder.  This provides a
setup for him to unfold his life story through the police interrogation.  </P>
<P>Set in the 1920's Rotterdam, "Character" is a good-looking piece of
melodrama from the first-time director Mike van Diem.  It follows
Katadreuffe's life, out of wedlock from a one-night stand between the
brooding and stony bailiff Dreverhaven and his housekeeper Joba.  She
refuses his marriage proposal and raises her son alone.  He grows up with
strong resentment for his father, and Dreverhaven's action does not help
to improve this relationship either.  He sets numerous obstacles in his
son's road to success, only to watch him jump through the hurdles one
after another by the young man's stubborn and persistant effort.  The
tension between father and son continues to escalate to the point that
it finally ends with a knife.  </P>
<P>The weakness and the appeal of "Character" is its unrestrained passion
displayed among the three members of the family, especially between
Dreverhaven and Katadreuffe.  Hate mixed with love flying and spilling all
over the place, it is easy to be affected, yet hard to completely
understand these characters' motivation and minds.  The most
puzzling and contradictory person is Deverhaven. He appears to
be a ruthless, terrifying man who throws poor people out of their homes
into the streets.  He seems to enjoy making life difficult for his own
son.  On the other hand, he has his reasons -- he believes building
one's character requires hardship and endurance.  Ironically, it all works
very well for his son.  He does not disgard Joba when she is pregnant,
even though he has forced her.  Instead he kept asking her "When is our
wedding?"  He is clearly tired of living, and makes attempts to get
himself killed only to fail.  One can only speculate his degeration to
such a sad existence since the movie refuses to give us any clue about
why.  He is the mysterious father figure that no one understands.  Jan
Decleir has a truly chilling presence on screen as a heavy, intimidating
figure of power, authority and ruthlessness that the mere sight of him in
that black coat and hat can inflict instant fear in the hearts of the poor
and of his own son.  He doesn't have many words, but always casts a shadow
everywhere in the film.  </P>
<P>If the father is intimidating, the mother is no more approachable.  She
seems to enjoy being the only person in the world to drive the mighty
Deverhaven crazy.  She ignores the boy's emotional needs forever.  She
hardly even says a word.  Years later, when her son asks why she did not
marry when his father proposed to her, she is still a stone wall.  She is
so cold and distant that it is almost inhuman.  Again no explanation is
provided and she remains mysterious until she takes all her secrets into
the grave.  </P>
<P>With dysfunctional parents like these, it is no wonder that Katadreufe is
emotionally messed up.  He is a passionate child, with no one to turn to.
He turns out to be unable to release himself from the extreme desire to
piss off his father, or perhaps subconsciously to please him and meet his
expectations.  As stubborn and proud as his parents are, he fights his way
up in a small law firm from the lowest level.  By a faint light, we fancy
the same kind of self-torturing hard struggle in a young Deverhaven years
ago, and the same kind of disillusion when he gets everything he had
wanted, yet realizes that he has lost any chance to find love and a
healthy normal life.  The line between love and hate is blurred.  When his
mother is so indifferent to him, we suspect that even the harsh treatment
from his father is welcome deep down in Katadreuffe's mind -- at least he
gives a damn about him, even if it's mean-spirited.  </P>
<P>Compared to this really dysfunctional family, the movie provides a couple
of rather interesting supporting roles.  Lorna Te George is Katadreuffe's
office coworker who is let down by his failure to express his love for her
(because of whatever demon he has).  De Gankelaar is K.'s boss and mentor
who tries to substitute for a sensible and loving father to him.  He has a
protruding jaw that reminds me of Billy Bob Thornton's Karl Childers in
"Sling Blade", with a warm and understated tenderness.  K.'s only friend
Jan, his mother tenant, is a fun-loving young man and a communist.  These
are K.'s only chance to escape his family and connect to a normal
emotional world, but his blood and destiny pulls him back to his dark
father.  </P>
<P>As a directorial debut, Mike van Diem displays a great deal of confidence
and sophistication in his work.  The tension and passions are pushed to
the highest level, because he never tries to hold it back.  Such approach
often leads to something completely over-the-top, but the nice
performances by the entire cast have prevented it.  Instead, we are
affected by them rather than feeling silly or disbelief. He also shows a
very sure hand in the movement of camera and the transitions between two
scenes.  It's a good thing that van Diem refuses to explain everything to
us including what's on the characters' minds, but some crucial points
become too vague for the audience to identify with or understand.  Another
problem is that the tone throughout the movie is so decidedly and
stubbornly dark and suffocating, that it becomes rather humorless and a
bit too heavy from time to time.  </P>
<P>If the direction is not quite over-the-top, unfortunately the music is.
Always ready to increase the sense of fear, rage, hatred, pain, etc. etc.,
it is just too much.  I feel that the music tries too hard to tell the
story that it loses its effect after a while, as if it was trying to
scream at the audience to tell them how they should feel.  </P>
<P>The things I enjoy the most about this film are the cinematography and
production design.  Filmed in Poland to replicate the scenery of an old
Rotterdam, it is full of symbolic tall and dark buildings that cast
shadows of terror upon one's heart.  The cinematography is truly gorgeous
and breath-taking.  With most scenes shot in the rain, at night, in the
shadows of the houses and under cloudy skies, it effectively creates the
moody world of despair and melancholy.  It is a perfect example of
beautiful camera work becoming a central element of the movie.  It is
simply wonderful to look at.  </P>
<P>Overall, I find it a quite handsomely done piece of work.  I have to
admit that I enjoy watching such bold effort to throw passions at the
audience without holding back.  Grade: B+.  </P>

ps. I was rather disappointed to find out that someone beat me at pointing
out the fact that "Character" and "Star Wars" have strong similarities.</P>
