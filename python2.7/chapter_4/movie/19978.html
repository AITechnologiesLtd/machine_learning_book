<P>     In the bowels of a Thai prison, two American girls learn about the
horrors of bad judgment -- the hard way.  Alice Marano (Claire Danes) and
Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale), two high school grads from suburban Ohio,
had only intended their trip to Thailand as a final pre-college fling.
That was before Australian seducer Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine) played them
for suckers and set them up as heroin smugglers.  Now, in the first year
of a 33-year sentence, Alice and Darlene are beginning to discover what
damnation really means.  It means vaguely drab pixie haircuts, heavily
filtered sunlight streaming into an exercise yard, and a non-stop
soundtrack from some techno-Thai concept of Lilith Fair.  Truly, this is
hell on earth.</P>
<P>     Jonathan Kaplan's BROKEDOWN PALACE is one of those gritty "issue"
dramas that stabs itself in the heart by assuming the audience's
sensibilities can only handle so much grit.  The opening half hour works
well enough, following the two friends on their early youthful adventures
and establishing the basic framework of their relationship.  Alice, the
instigator, makes all the daring choices; Darlene, the good-girl follower,
plays along with her best pal's caprices.  Danes doesn't go overboard with
her character, keeping Alice's devilish streak within the realm of
rebellious plausibility, while Beckinsale struggles a bit more with
Darlene's naivete.  When Nick enters the picture, submerged jealousies
begin to surface, establishing how easily a life-long friendship can be
strained.  It may not be particularly inspired story-telling, but it's
solid enough.</P>
<P>     Then the girls become inmates, and the whole thing falls apart.  The
theme of BROKEDOWN PALACE may not be "look at the squalor of Thai
prisons," but it shouldn't have been "look how attractive a Thai prison
can be with the right cinematography."  Kaplan shoots bridge sequences as
elaborate music videos, turning his actresses into cute models instead of
tormented characters.  Meanwhile, the various government officials who
sneer and smirk their way through the film -- including Kay Tong Lim as a
corrupt Thai detective and Lou Diamond Phillips (in a gruesomely bad
performance) as a nonchalant U.S. embassy flunkie -- provide the tidy
villainy we require.  With a script by first-time screenwriter David Arata
that forgets sub-plots and provides simplistic outrage, BROKEDOWN PALACE
proves itself to be fairly lazy film-making.  It pre-digests its story
into over-wrought melodrama.</P>
<P>     There's a hint of promise when Bill Pullman enters the story as
Yankee Hank, an expatriate American attorney with that typically
expatriate American sense of me-first-ism.  It's fairly obvious from the
get-go that his character arc will be straight out of CASABLANCA -- a 
jaded pseudo-Rick Blaine who gives up his own financial interest for the
greater good -- but Pullman is an interesting enough actor to pull it off.
Unfortunately, his story also pulls us away from the two central
characters.  Though in a way that's a good thing -- the fewer scenes spent
in the meticulously unpleasant prison, the better -- it's also a
distraction from Alice's theoretically central conversion to selfless
friend.  </P>
<P>     Comparisons between BROKEDOWN PALACE and last year's RETURN TO
PARADISE are inevitable -- both are tales of Americans languishing abroad,
seasoned with self-sacrifice for the sake of a friend.  But as uneven as
RETURN TO PARADISE was, it approached every similar point with more
provocative shades of gray.  Instead of RETURN TO PARADISE's two casual
acquaintances, the friends are best buddies from the cradle, making the
choice considerably less complicated; instead of making the protagonist
convincingly selfish from the outset, it makes her a misunderstood wild
child.  Kaplan and Arata want desperately for the plight of their
characters to matter, but the final hour is too irretrievably phony to
provide an emotional pull.  Viewers who find this sort of morality play
uplifting may find their hearts swelling at the conclusion.  I found mine
sinking as BROKEDOWN PALACE closed on the beatific smile of an actress,
placed center stage while a well-placed beam of sunlight captured her
soaring spirit in an MTV prison.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Thai breakers:  4.</PRE>
