<PRE>MAGNOLIA
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Anyone unconvinced of Paul Thomas Anderson's talent following the
critical success of "Boogie Nights" (the film which put Mark Wahlberg's
"talent" on the map) need look no further than his latest film, "Magnolia."</P>
<P>        "Magnolia" stars Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, John C. Reilly,
Melora Walters, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Philip Baker Hall, all of whom
appeared in "Boogie Nights."  Utilizing a stock company of repertory
regulars is an approach employed by the likes of Robert Altman and Alan
Rudolph, and it works well for Anderson too; every single member of his
ensemble delights in profound and significant ways.  "Magnolia" also stars
Jason Robards and Tom Cruise, and they complement Anderson's veterans
extremely nicely.</P>
<P>        In a story of intersecting lives and emotions, Robards is bed
ridden and dying of cancer, Moore is his emotional wreck of a trophy wife
who's finally learned to love him, and Hoffman is his sensitive and
beleaguered nurse.  Cruise, in a dynamic performance, plays a misogynistic
motivational speaker with turbulent ties to the dying man.  In parallel
story threads, Reilly is a San Fernando Valley cop who falls for the
coke-addicted daughter (Walters) of a TV game show host (Hall), and Macy
appears as a former game show prodigy with love in his heart for a
tinsel-toothed barkeep.</P>
<P>        As you can probably tell from these brief character descriptions,
"Magnolia" is structured more as a series of vignettes than a traditional
central narrative yet many of these disparate storylines come together very
untraditionally in the film's breathtaking final act.  The film is a little
over three hours long but you'd never know it; the minutes simply fly by.</P>
<P>        Anderson, some say an upstart of a filmmaker at 29, wrote as well
as directed "Magnolia," yet the film plays out with the sophistication and
maturity of someone beyond his years.  Since "Magnolia" was supposedly
inspired by a lyric from an Aimee Mann song, it makes perfect sense that
Anderson would employ the talents of the former 'Til Tuesday lead singer,
whose melancholy refrains are featured predominantly on the film's
soundtrack.  That soundtrack also features impressive music by Jon Brion
(Anderson's "Hard Eight").  His insistent score is especially effective in
its ability to heighten passions, pulling the characters together with its
urgent layering across scenes.</P>
<P>        In addition to drawing superlative performances from his cast,
Anderson takes two major risks in the film, sequences so against the grain
you'd expect some conventional bigwig to have exorcised them from the final
cut.  The fact that they meld perfectly with the escalating human drama
only further substantiates Anderson's skill as a writer and director of
unique and remarkable vision.</P>
<P>        Unfortunately, "Magnolia" was released in Philadelphia one week too
late to be included on my list of outstanding films of 1999, but even this
early in the new year I can guarantee it will make it onto my best films of
2000 list.  As a candidate for the best film of the year, it's gonna be a
tough act to beat.</P>
