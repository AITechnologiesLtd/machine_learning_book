<PRE>The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas (2000)
*
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp

<P>Miscellaneous thoughts noted down during the running time of "The
Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas":</P>
<P>1. According to the movie's press material, four writers received credit for
this film.  Why any of them were needed, or what they contributed, is a
mystery to me.  Collectively they don't even add up to one good one.</P>
<P>2. Jokes about dinosaurs passing gas are not funny.  The only time I have
seen anything remotely amusing about a giant creature passing gas was when
its name was Gamera.</P>
<P>3. Names which are plays on words, which was most of the stock-in-trade with
the Flintstones animated cartoon, are only funny up to a point.  In this
film we get "Mick Jagged and the..." -- are you holding your breath? --
"...Stones."  Chortle, chortle.  Even children, the primary audience for
this film, are going to find this movie tiresome.</P>
<P>4. Ann-Margaret embarrassed herself badly enough as a singer in "Tommy".
History repeats itself in this film.</P>
<P>5. Mark Addy (of "The Full Monty") isn't bad as Fred Flintstone, but he is
faced with the hopeless task of being interesting in a movie that defies
interest.  Barney, played by Stephen Baldwin, looks as though he would be
more at home playing his trigger-happy character from "The Usual Suspects".</P>
<P>6. Live-action movies made from cartoons are often painfully bad, for one
very simple reason.  What we see in animation we can forgive a great deal
of; what we see in live-action is utterly unsparing.  "Inspector Gadget" was
an object lesson this movie has not learned a thing from.</P>
<P>7. A sure measure of desperation on the part of the filmmakers: a subplot
about an alien who has no purpose in the film other than to eat up running
time.  I never imagined 90 minutes would be so difficult to burn.</P>
<P>8. A good movie makes you forget you're watching a movie.  A bad movie never
lets you forget this.  "The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas" is a very bad
movie.</P>
<PRE>9. Joan Collins should retire.</PRE>
