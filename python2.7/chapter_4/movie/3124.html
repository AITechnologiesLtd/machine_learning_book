<PRE>                       MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Directed by Alan Rudolph
Starring- Jennifer Jason Leigh, Campbell Scott, Matthew Broderick,
          Jennifer Beals, Andrew McCarthy, Wallace Shawn, Peter Gallagher,
          Martha Plimptom, Stephen Baldwin, Keith Carradine
Screenplay by Rudolph & Randy Sue Coburn
Produced by Robert Altman</P>
<P>     It would seem that the makers of ED WOOD and the makers of MRS.
PARKER got their scripts mixed up.  ED WOOD was about a fun film about
an interesting group of celebrities.  MRS. PARKER is a downbeat film
about somebody declining into alcoholism and failure.</P>
<P>     MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE can be seen as a companion
piece to Rudolph's 1988 film THE MODERNS.  The jazz age cultural elite
of New York, instead of Paris, is prominently featured.  Instead of the
Paris cafe scene, the main setting is the dining room of the Algonquin
Hotel.  Anybody who was anybody seemed to sit at one table there.
Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, George S.  Kaufman, and Edna Ferber
were among the most notable.  The 'good natured' sarcasm of the critics
and playwrights assembled still turns up to fill the small stray spaces
of magazines.</P>
<P>     From this group, Rudolph focuses on verse poet Dorothy Parker and
erudite humorist Robert Benchley.  Jennifer Jason Leigh and Campbell
Scott respectively turn in fine subdued performances in the lead
roles.  Leigh gets a lot out of her emotionally distant Dorothy Parker
character that always has to be ready with a verbal barb.  Scott
manages to find a level of insecurity in Robert Benchley, the face
behind the mask.  Most of the other roles in the film are just cameos,
people that Parker and Benchley encounter along the way and fail to
connect with.  Wallace Shawn has an amusing turn as the Algonquin
waiter.  Keith Carradine, star of THE MODERNS, turns up very briefly as
Will Rogers.</P>
<P>     The plot of the film is very loosely structured, so much so that
it can hardly be called a plot at all.  Days at the Algonquin when
famous people turned up to say famous lines are punctuated by Dorothy
Parker's increasing dependence on liquor and empty sexual encounters.
Her later years, in black and white, are intercut with her pastel
colored memories of her time in the national eye.  It is more a series
of events than a story.  And while we often see the characters drink,
we seldom see them write.</P>
<P>     Both as a double character study and a recreation of bygone era
MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE is quite successful.  It avoids the
common tendency to automatically deify the subject of the film.  Quite
to the contrary, depicting the human failings of the famous people of
the jazz age seems to be the project of the film.  The famous witty
jabs somehow don't seem quite as funny when the nature of the "vicious
circle" is revealed.  Mostly they become forced vain attempts at
comraderie.</P>
<P>     As with all of Rudolph's work, the film is visually stunning if
perhaps a little slowly paced.  The audience for the film is also
perhaps a small one.  Watching the film evokes the same feeling as
reading New Yorker magazine, which published work from Dorothy Parker
and others depicted.  If you don't enjoy one, you probably won't enjoy
the other.</P>
