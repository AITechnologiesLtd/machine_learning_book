<PRE>                                  QUIZ SHOW
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     It is not often that one is fortunate enough to see a movie that
has a good story, exceptional acting, not only by the film's stars but
all the supporting cast, and also has great direction. All of these are
found in this gripping, emotional film, and what a treat that is for
the moviegoer.</P>
<P>     Everyone probably remembers or has heard of the quiz show,
"Twenty-One," that swept the country's TV viewers in the mid-1950s, and
of the accompanying scandal when it was found the program was rigged
with some of the contestants being given the answers.   That it also
involved the son of a most distinguished intellectual family added
further drama.  Despite our knowing that story, it in no way diminishes
the excitement of the film.  This, again, is due to the fine direction
and to its superb cast.</P>
<P>     Herbie Stempel (John Turturro) is the man the show's producers ask
to miss a question when they feel he has outlived his popularity as the
show's top winner.  Turturro is perfect as he rages over being dropped,
and with the further ignominy over a question to which he (and everyone
else) knew the answer.</P>
<P>     Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow) is the attorney who tenaciously sought
to find out if and how the program was rigged, and present it to the
Congressional Committee on Legislative Oversight. Charles Van Doren
(Ralph Fiennes), who rose to fame as the contestant who won the most
money; his father, poet and critic, Mark Van Doren, (Paul Scofield);
Quiz Show producer Dan Enright (David Paymer); and Jack Barry
(Christopher McDonald) the show's Host, all give wonderful
performances.</P>
<P>     Look for many nominations from Quiz Show come Oscar time, for Best
Movie, Best Acting by leads and supporters, and Best Direction.  One
extraordinary film!</P>
<PRE>Directed by Robert Redford.</PRE>
