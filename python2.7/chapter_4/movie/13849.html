<P>Chow Yun-Fat makes his American movie debut in a shoot 'em up Hong
Kong-themed action thriller co-starring Quentin Tarantino's main
squeeze from the days of shooting, Mira Sorvino. This film is also the
first for music-video director (see Little Known Facts below) gone
movie director Antoine Fuqua.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Hitman Lee (Yun-Fat) must kill a police officer's son for his gangster
boss Mr. Wei. Before he kills the child, he develops a conscience, and
skips his task of murder. Mr. Wei is not happy with his killer
employee, and sends in some "replacement killers" to finish him off, as
well as the cop's kid. Lee must do battle with other killers, while
attempting to return home to his endangered family in China, with the
assistance of passport forger Coburn (Sorvino).</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Do you like guns? Do you like the gunplay? If your answers to the
previous two questions were a resounding "yes", then I suggest you get
up off your ass, jog over to your nearest video store, and rent this
gun smokin' fun-fest! If you're one that enjoys the plot of a movie,
the deep characterization of man and woman, and the existential meaning
of life, then I suggest you remain seated, and move onto another
review. This bullet-emblazoned film is all noize and explosions, and
anything but stimulus for your cerebral matter.</P>
<P>This movie is also filmed like a MTV music video, with the required hip
eclectic soundtrack, a dark moody look with sporadic use of green and
red filters, and the obligatory Tony Scott-famed rainfall. It also
boasts the required short runtime (less than 90 minutes- flat), an
extreme use of slo-motion when the bullets and the bodies are a-flyin',
and the less than impressive emphasis on plot. If there was a plot,
that is. Oh yeah, hitman develops conscience: Now, let's kill hitman.
Slap in some Sorvino running around in a bra for most of the film, and
you've got yourself a nacho-munching fool-fest for all those willing to
drop their brains off at the door (Guilty as charged.)</P>
<P>Yun-Fat's rookie American performance is also pretty lame in this
movie, with his entire dialogue based around three word monotone
sentences. Michael Rooker as the good cop plays Michael Rooker as the
good cop, and the rest of the cast is basically just a heap of bodies
to be counted later. Did I mention that there were a lot of gunfights?
In the tradition of the master himself, John Woo (co-executive producer
on this one), Fuqua also wastes no time in between gunplay scenes. Fat
walks into a hotel. Gun fight. Fat walks into an arcade. Gun fight. Fat
walks into a car wash. Gun fight. Highly stylized gunfights mind you,
but perpetual gunfights nonetheless. All in all, this is the kind of
stuff that seems to be receding our kids into the lobotomous zones that
we recognize them in sometimes. On the other hand, if this is your
taste of salsa, don't let me stand in the way of a man, his cheese and
his monster bag o' nachos!  </P>
