<P>
The afternoon before the Oscars, I finally got around to seeing "Life
is Beautiful".  I only caught a glimpse of Benigni's victorious
stepping on of Spielberg as he clampered over the seats; I was tired
and went to sleep early.</P>
<P>The movie has achieved a large share of acclaim, but there are also
many detractors who argue that this slapstick comedy partially set in
the Holocaust verges on Holocaust denial.  Among of the examples I've
seen include the New Yorker's film critic in two seperate articles,
because the first one was too short to contain his arguments; an NPR
piece that included commentary from Art Spiegelman, the author of Maus,
who takes it personally as Benigni appears to be using the Holocaust as
a metaphor, a corruption of Maus's use of using metaphor to approach
the Holocaust [1]; and Salon's reviewer [2].</P>
<P>I went into the film with this critical baggage.  This, of course,
colors the film in a certain way: one starts to look to see if the
movie confirms the criticisms.  I'm not sure how important this is, as
no film is seen in a vacuum of personal experience.</P>
<P>To summarize the basic plot (and get the obligatory bits of a review
over with), we should note that the movie starts as a light romantic
comedy.  Benigni plays a waiter, pursuing a woman he literally runs
into.  There are complications: she's engaged to the local Fascist
boss, who Benigni previous met in, well, let's say comic
circumstances.  Over the first hour of the film, Benigni's clown charms
her, wins her over.  Some years later, we find them their life together
happily settled, with a precocious son scampering around.  This idyll
is shattered when the Nazis come and the family is taken to a death
camp.</P>
<P>To keep his son alive, Benigni spins a story for him: the routines of
the camp are an elaborate game, and the winner gets a big tank as first
prize.  Elaborations are improvised: when the rest of the children
vanish, Benigni tells his son they are hiding, and that he should hide
too.  The charade continues until the end, when the war is over and the
Americans roll in to liberate the camp.</P>
<P>I actually found this to be a fine film, but weightless.  It makes a
statement about love and humor conquering all, but it is not a tested
proposition.  Yes, Benigni is still able to act as a clown to keep his
son alive and believing, but there was never any indication in the film
that he could not act as a clown.  There is little evidence in the film
that his character changes with circumstance, that he is not
compulsively the way he is.  There is then no doubt that love and humor
will conquer in this film: they simply exist and continue to exist,
unchallenged by any real despair or doubt.</P>
<P>It's in this nonexistence of despair that I see the point of the film's
detractors, and why they argue that it approaches Holocaust Denial
Lite, which asserts that while the Holocaust happened, it really wasn't
that bad.  Yes, there are unrealistic touches with the physical
presentation of the camp: it looks a whole lot like a summer camp, with
fairly roomy barracks for the inmates.  The guards have a touch of
Hogan's Heroes about them (the actor who plays the SS guard spelling
out the camp's rules, in fact, almost loses it and laughs out loud to
Benigni's antics).  Security is interestingly lax, as Benigni is able
to get to the camp loudspeaker for quite a long time without
interruption, as well as put a record player to good use in cheering up
his distant wife [3].  But more importantly, there's a lack of despair
or oppression, except for a few dramatically conducive moments.  In
some sense, the Holocaust isn't the Holocaust.  In this movie, the
Holocaust is merely a big bummer.</P>
<P>Interestingly, the one surreal moment of the film, when Benigni is
taking is son home from the Officer's mess, the dreamlike fog parts and
he sees a scene from a Breugel [4]: a mound of dessicated, naked
corpses, what remains after Death has conquered all.  Perhaps the
decision to make this sequence otherworldly is acknowledgement that
this ultimately light film cannot incorporate the reality of the death
camps within its frame.  It's in this sequence that the film comes
closest to breaking through its comic straightjacket, to shake off its
rictus of a smile.  We see a hint that the clown may well be confronted
by despair, but the hint doesn't last.</P>
<P>The film only works at one level, the simple one in which love,
compassion and humor can overcome the most dire of circumstances.  One
critic noted that "Life is Beautiful" could have become a great ironic
fable if the child was fully aware of what the camp was for, but was
playing along with the father to maintain his father's sanity and faith
that things will work out in the end.  But Benigni doesn't take this
path; it's unclear if you could have.  Another route may have been to
take seriously the notion that this film is a fable constructed from
the wartime memories of a six-year-old boy: the
death-camp-as-summer-camp is the world his father created for him,
hiding the reality.  Of course things were more pleasant; the loving
father has spun a necessary illusion.  But this is another road not
taken, and the film's message remains uncomplicated.</P>

<P>[3] There's a similar scene in "The Shawshank Redemption".  I think
it's in the Stephen King short story, but I don't remember.  I'm
curious about the precedents for the record player stunt.</P>
