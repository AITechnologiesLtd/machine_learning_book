                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>There have been many redemption stories put through a camera lens in film
history.  The 1980's had some obvious and often talked about winners such as
'The Verdict' (1982) in which most film gossipers felt Paul Newman was robbed
by not winning the Best Actor Oscar as an alcoholic lawyer struggling with
the biggest case of his life.  The Oscar most deservingly went to Ben
Kingsley that year for 'Gandhi', respectively.  'Amadeus', which in part was
about a man (F. Murray Abraham in an Oscar winning role) observing the
realization of what his fate in eternity might be by absolving himself in
confession of his sins to a priest and then on a lighter note there was
'Tootsie' (1982) which most people don't think about as a story of redemption
but it is since its leading star (Dustin Hoffman) finds out through a gender
exchange done with make-up and women's clothes that he was a better person as
a woman in the short time he faked it than he ever was as a man.</P>
<P>1983 saw a small, little seen film entitled 'Tender Mercies' receive
exceptional notices from the critic's circle and from the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences as it was nominated for 5 Academy Awards; Best
Picture, Best Actor (Robert Duvall), Best Director (Bruce Beresford), Best
Screenplay Written Directly For the Screen (Horton Foote who was a previous
winner for 1962's 'To Kill a Mockingbird') and Best Original Song ('Over You'
written by Austin Roberts and Bobby Hart).  Both Duvall and Foote came out
winners that year for their efforts.  As an actor it was Duvall's fourth
nomination after 'The Godfather' (1972 nominee for Best Supporting Actor),
'Apocalypse Now' (1979 nominee for Best Supporting Actor) and 'The Great
Santini' (1980 nominee as Best Actor).  If any American actor can hold his
own and can stir up conversation among film historians for all time it is
Robert Duvall.  </P>
<P>In 'Tender Mercies' Duvall emerged with a stunning characterization by
portraying a country and western singer well past the middle age of life
struggling with alcoholism and the demons of misery concerning an ex-wife who
won custody of their only child, a daughter, whom Duvall hasn't seen in many
years.  In the opening scene of the film we glance upon a country road motel
room window at night in which two figures in silhouette fashion can be seen
and rumblings are heard from the room with the repetitive chant of 'Give me
the bottle!' ringing out.  The motel's young and widowed owner, (Tess Harper)
and her young son step out on to the porch of the office and listen while
trying to watch the scene play out through the window  The scene abruptly
shifts to the room itself as Duvall is shoved to the floor by the other man
in a pathetic struggle over a bottle of alcohol.  The man with Duvall is
never seen on camera making this scene one of clever duplicity.  The next
morning Duvall awakes from his drunken cloudiness and the film's credits
begin to appear and the picture's tone and protagonist are established.</P>
<P>As the film progresses Duvall works off what he owes for the motel since he
is flat broke and asks to stay on and work as he is attracted to Harper and
sees a chance for redemption with his new surroundings.  He stops drinking
and is paid a visit by a persistent journalist (Paul Gleason) who asks Duvall
if he's a famous country and western singer from yesteryear that he's
planning to do a story on.  Duvall is naturally publicity shy and the
journalist informs him that his ex-wife (Betty Buckley) who is a world famous
c+w singing sensation is having a concert nearby.  Duvall then takes an
interest as it will give him an opportunity to see his only daughter.  Upon
seeing his ex-wife they immediately go for each other's throats verbally and
the spat is broken up by Buckley's manager (Wilford Brimley).  </P>
<P>A short time later Duvall is paid a visit by his now adult daughter (Ellen
Barkin) and the two of them are glad to see each other although sentimental
feelings never surface giving the film a dimension of stability by avoiding
any pretentious qualities.  Also in the course of the film, Harper and Duvall
get married and Duvall treats his new wife and stepson with dignity and
respect and they are paid constant visits by a group of young musicians who
idolize Duvall and they help him back on the road to success.  He makes a
recording that seems to do well but then an event occurs in his life which
reminds him of one of life's most staggering tragedies and he explains to his
wife in a heartfelt moment the he never did trust happiness.  It was that key
scene which won Duvall the Oscar more than any other point in the film.
 Duvall also wrote and sang his own songs in the film.  In fact, the entire
cast shines and Tess Harper's performance was overlooked that year by the
Academy and she would go on to be a nominee in 1986 as Best Supporting
Actress for 'Crimes of the Heart' which was good work but significantly less
than her work in 'Tender Mercies'.</P>
<P>'Tender Mercies' is a series of short scenes that make a short film with a
running length of only 89 minutes but the enormous power that shines
gracefully on the audience comes from the film's monumental simplicity
started by Horton Foote's script and carried out by director Bruce Beresford
and is a testament to Beresford's talent as a director.  In 1989, his film
'Driving Miss Daisy' would go on to win the Best Picture Academy Award but
Beresford would find himself not receiving a Best Director nomination that
year.  'Tender Mercies' is a solid film classic that is free from the
trappings of Hollywood's often too obvious visual style of fake emotion and
is proof that smaller films can sometimes be the backbone that keeps the
entire motion picture industry alive.</P>
