<PRE>THE HAUNTING
RATING: 4 / 10 --> This movie sucks</PRE>

<P>A big house. A big director, Jan de Bont of SPEED and TWISTER fame. A big
star, Catherine Zeta-Jones, hot of the heels of ENTRAPMENT (6.5/10) and
ZORRO. A big remake of THE HAUNTING. And big special effects. So what do
they all amount to? Unfortunately for us, a big bore!</P>
<P>PLOT:
A hotshot doctor brings three insomniacs to an old, spooky mansion for
controlled testing. Unbeknownst to the patients, the good doctor is actually
conducting his own cover project that has to do with the psychology of fear.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This movie just didn't scare me one bit. Sure, it creeped and spooked me out
a little here and there, but on the whole, it took waaaaay too long to get
going, provided very little meat in the plot, went way past its own bedtime,
and basically relied on grunts, the muttering of children's voices and
over-the-top special effects, to scare us. Well, this film didn't do much
for me. And they might as well have called it the "Haunting of Lily Taylor",
since she's basically the only character who had any real depth, background
or reason to be in the house in the first place.</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong, Catherine Zeta was sweet window dressing (despite my
continued perception of her faint mustache-see ENTRAPMENT), and Owen Wilson
was good as the standard "comic relief", but come on people, if you're going
to have us sit through two hours in a theater with these folks, how 'bout
giving them a little more than one-liners as dimension. Neeson was also
wasted as the smart, British guy. It's all too sad, cause certainly the
"idea" seemed like a good one (see THE SHINING (9/10) for a close to perfect
example of a creepy gone awry), but the story was thin, the conclusion was
laughable (Be gone...poof!) and the special effects? Well, they sure were
nice to look at, but not for a moment did one of them scare, or even for a
split-second, have me believe that they were anything more than Hollywood
special gadgetry.</P>
<P>See it for Zeta-Jones, or if you like special effects and scary movies that
take forever to get going, and provide very little payback, otherwise skip
it and check out the original or the ultimate movie about spooky homes from
the netherworld, THE SHINING.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Goofy actor Owen Wilson co-scripted indie favorites RUSHMORE (8/10) and
BOTTLE ROCKET with director Wes Anderson. His brother Luke Wilson is also an
actor, who once dated Drew Barrymore for a year or so. Brother Andrew is
also an actor.
Singer Lisa Loeb is listed in the credits as having portrayed the character
of Olivia Morice, but I personally did not notice her. She is well known for
her number one single "Stay (I missed you)" and goofy glasses.
The creaks and moans heard throughout the house were prerecorded and played
during filming in order to get a more natural expression of fear out of the
actors.
Catherine Zeta-Jones is currently dating flabby ass actor Michael "Sex is my
life" Douglas. She stands 5'8".
In 1998, actor Michael Rapaport pleaded guilty to the aggravated harassment
of Lily Taylor. He was ordered to stay away from her and undergo counseling
for one year.
Actor Bruce Dern, who plays the throwaway role of the gatekeeper in this
film, was once nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role
in COMING HOME.
Director Jan de Bont was born in Holland, and began his lengthy career as a
cinematographer on films as DIE HARD, HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER and BASIC
INSTINCT, directed by another Dutchman, Paul Verhoeven.
Actor Todd Field also played a small but pivotal role in Stanley Kubrick's
last film, EYES WIDE SHUT. He was Nick Nightingale, the pianist.
This film was originally titled THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE.</P>
