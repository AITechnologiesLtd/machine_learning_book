<P>DISTURBING BEHAVIOR
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ** (out of ****) 
MGM / 1:23 / 1998 / R (violence, language, sexuality, brief nudity)
Cast: James Marsden; Katie Holmes; Nick Stahl; Bruce Greenwood; William 
Sadler; Steve Railsback; Chad E. Donella; Crystal Cass; Tobias Mehler 
Director: David Nutter 
Screenplay: Scott Rosenberg<HR>Combining brief flashes of a intense, roaming light with an 
understatedly eerie orchestral theme, the opening credits of "Disturbing 
Behavior" are really something spooky. But then the action begins, the 
sense of mystery vanishes and the movie quickly molds itself into the 
textbook definition of "uneven tone." A must-be-seen-to-be-believed 
prologue sequence -- involving a vicious bit of pseudo-coitus 
interruptus -- is supposed to provide the audience with a fast jolt 
that'll only hint at the freaky weirdness yet to come. Instead, it kicks 
off the first in a long series of unintentional guffaws that render 
"Disturbing Behavior" an amusing almost-guilty pleasure. </P>
<P>In this greatest-hits mesh of "The Stepford Wives," "Village of the 
Damned," "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and (oh, why not?) "A 
Clockwork Orange," a sinister force is at work in the nice little 
community of Cradle Bay, turning a large percentage of the young adult 
populace into ideal, zombie-like preppies whose primary concerns include 
the honor roll and bake sale strategies. New-kid-in-town Steve (James 
Marsden) makes friends with Cradle Bay outcasts Gavin (Nick Stahl) and 
Rachel (Katie Holmes); together they become increasingly suspect of 
their classmates' unnaturally perfect existence, and begin to uncover a 
conspiracy involving their peers' own parents. </P>
<P>Even though the story plays its silly scares with a straight face, 
"Disturbing Behavior" isn't a complete bust -- it's just nowhere near 
the clever, frightening post-Scream thriller it so aspires to be. The 
wannabe-trendy dialogue is chuckle-worthy for all the wrong reasons, and 
with lines like "Self-mutilate this, fluid boy" and "Who put the acid in 
my Spam?", it's no wonder. Late in the film, when Steve and Rachel find 
unsettling surprises in a dark, dreary asylum, the scene plays like 
"Awakenings" on crank. Since what's really missing here is running audio 
commentary from the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" gang, you might be 
enticed to create your own. </P>
<P>Holmes, of "Dawson's Creek" fame, survives her howler-heavy part with 
her fresh reputation in tact, although this is one film her precocious 
television buddies would definitely pass judgement on. Stahl and Marsden 
make the most out of their roles as well, but the latter is saddled with 
a head-scratcher subplot involving a sibling who committed suicide. In 
the movie's most frenzied performance, William Sadler (the Grim Reaper 
from "Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey"), as a wild-and-crazy janitor, chows 
on the scenery, coughs it back up and devours it again. It's called 
"unsubtle foreshadowing" when he uses a high-pitched radio frequency to 
cure his boiler room of a rat problem. </P>
<P>Those seeking gobs of blood and guts are better off checking out "Saving 
Private Ryan" this weekend -- the most violent scene here includes just 
a forced nosering removal. The film itself is also a pretty painless 
sit, thanks to a running time that barely constitutes 80 minutes -- and 
that includes the several seconds devoted to a completely unnecessary 
breast shot. At least you can't accuse "Disturbing Behavior" of wearing 
out its wack-job welcome, even if it does squander its potentially 
intriguing subject material in favor of something hip, fast, flashy and 
filled with enough good-looking teens to make a whole new Aaron Spelling 
series. Mark my words: This flick is a midnight movie in the making.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"The best possible argument for including [a shot of Bruce] Willis' 
genitals would have been that the movie, after all, contains everything 
else." -- Roger Ebert on "Color of Night"</P>
