LASSIE COME HOME
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>The latest STAR WARS craze clearly shows that certain
categories of movies are very hard to review objectively.
The reviewer is often tempted to judge movie not by its own
merit, but by his or her own feelings of nostalgia towards
past times. Many of those movies belong to the category of
family entertainment, which is natural, because for many,
those films invoke happy memories of childhood. For the
author of this review, one of such films is LASSIE COME
HOME, 1943 Hollywood film by Fred M. Wilcox, one of the
classics of family entertainment. I first saw this movie at
the very early age and it was one of the most memorable
movie experiences in my life.</P>
<P>Based on the novel by English author Eric Knight, this film
is set in Depression era Yorkshire, where Sam Carraclough
(Donald Crisp) and his wife (Elsa Lanchester) and son Joe
(Roddy McDowall) must endure the hard times caused by
employment. For the little Joe the only comfort in those
hard times comes in the shape of Lassie, collie which is his
father's pride and joy. But one day money runs out and
family is forced to sell the dog to rich Duke of Rudling
(Nigel Bruce). The dog, however, is using every opportunity
to run back to his old owner, which is causing great
frustration to Duke's kennel keeper Hynes (Pat O'Malley).
The escapes are to stop when Duke moves to Scotland. Duke's
granddaughter Priscilla (Elizabeth Taylor) would allow dog
to escape and begin long, hard and dangerous journey south.</P>
<P>At first glance, LASSIE COME HOME might look like nothing
more than standard Old Hollywood tearjerker. But even those
who don't like tearjerkers would, in most likelihood, agree
that this film looks almost like a mythical masterpiece
compared with some of the recent examples of the genre. The
script by Hugo Butler is very tight and simple, but, in the
same time, provides enough material not only to entertain
the young audience, but even to make them think. The main
element of the plot is based on real life - conflict between
reason and emotion, this time accelerated by down-to-Earth
economic hardships, something very palpable not only to the
audience fifty years ago, but for people in many countries
today. The sub-theme of poverty is very present in the film
- on her journey Lassie encounter many characters who suffer
because of it, and the only act of violence in the movie is
economically motivated. But even those who don't appreciate
this social aspect of the film would enjoy it, because it is
well-told and interesting adventure story, full of not so
spectacular, but really moving and memorable scenes. In hour
and half we see some barely sketched characters, who are
magically fleshed out by excellent actors, whether they are
veterans like Donald Crisp or child newcomers like young
Roddy McDowall and Elizabeth Taylor. Another thing that
distinguishes this film from the rest is absence of true
villains - compared with today's cinema, the characters seem
surreally good. The music by Daniele Amfitheatrof sets the
right, melancholic atmosphere, same as Oscar-nominated
colour photography by Leonard Smith. The film was great
success in its time and spawned many sequels, and, in later
years, many remakes and imitations. But for the author of
this review LASSIE COME HOME is one of those rare and
precious films that are to be enjoyed by all generations -
children and adult.</P>
