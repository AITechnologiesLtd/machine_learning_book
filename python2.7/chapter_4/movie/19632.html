Shiloh 2:  Shiloh Season</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>It's a sure bet the family will enjoy 'Shiloh 2', the film based Phyllis 
Reynolds Naylor's 'Shiloh Season', the second book of the 'Shiloh' trilogy.</P>
<P>Young Marty Preston (Zachary Browne) has saved the beagle Shiloh from the 
clutches of a ne'er-do-well neighbor, Judd Travers (Scott Wilson).  But Judd 
resurfaces, his drunkenness and bad temper escalating.  Marty's father Ray 
(Michael Moriarty) believes Judd is hunting without permission on Preston 
land, and to make things worse, Judd makes overtures toward reclaiming 
Shiloh.  At one point Judd's dogs run loose, and one of Marty's sisters is 
bitten on the leg.  Clearly, Judd is a threatening presence.</P>
<P>Then something happens to Judd Travers.  Lassie-like, Shiloh leads Marty to 
Judd's overturned truck, saving the man's life.  Will Judd ever lose his 
apparent hatred?  Marty sets out trying to befriend him, following the 
example of his loving dog Shiloh.</P>
<P>As Marty, Zachary Browne is mostly convincing;  he is even endearing during 
his confrontations with Judd Travers, Browne's eyes full of sincerity and 
fear.</P>
<P>As Ray Preston, Michael Moriarty turns in an average performance.  His 
acting skills are apparent, yet he plays the role with little or no 
expression:  too low-key are his replies and  warnings in conversations with 
other characters.  His wife Louise, played by Ann Dowd, is much stronger in 
her portrayal of a concerned parent.  In one scene, protecting her daughter 
and other children from the vicious dog, Mrs. Preston swings a broom with 
frantic protectiveness.  Just as she is believable in her disdain of Judd, 
her husband Ray acts unbelievably laid-back toward the main who seems to 
pose a threat to the family.</P>
<P>Rod Steiger plays Doc Wallace, the wise mentor to many of the area children. 
  Steiger's experience is visible in his natural manner, even in his expert 
blocking:  the scenes in which he appears are very watchable and 
well-directed.</P>
<P>Scott Wilson sketches Judd Travers with convincing hatefulness.  His drunken 
staggers are not overdone (although his frequent drunk driving without a 
sheriff giving chase is inexcusable).  Even when the script gives him too 
little to say, Judd maintains a sour face and convinces us he is a hard nut 
to crack.</P>
<P>What is not so well done is the portrayal of seventh graders.  One scene has 
all the children on a school bus, talking civilly and woodenly about the dog 
attack.  The kids in Marty's class are entirely too quiet and cooperative 
with their new teacher, Miss Talbot.</P>
<P>As one might expect, there are many opportunities for sentiment in the 
story.  But in general, director Dale Rosenbloom keeps the tone from 
becoming too sickly sweet.</P>
<P>Music by Joel Goldsmith assists the story unobtrusively, and a theme song by 
Rita Coolidge does a nice job of closing the narrative.</P>
<P>A warm-hearted story with an all-important message, 'Shiloh 2: Shiloh 
Season' will capture the fondness of any viewer.  With a story that only 
seems simple, the film is a solid bet for family enjoyment.  In an age in 
which so many filmmakers refuse to target children, 'Shiloh 2' captivates 
with a mixture of fun and intelligence.</P>
