<P>   One of the things you learn in this richly textured romance
is that size may not be important, but hair is.  When Helen
(Gwyneth Paltrow) cuts her hair to take on a new look after
breaking up with her boyfriend, she loses a principal source of
her charm.  When she allows her abundant locks to fall
straight down her back, she is drop-dead gorgeous.  Couple
the mane with the Queen's English accent which she
successfully adopts and you have a woman who rivets the
attention of the males in her audience just by showing up.  In
fact, given her appeal, the most unbelievable aspect of
"Sliding Doors" is that not only does her boy friend
stray and alienate her affection for him: when he gets the
chance to make up, he botches his good fortune yet again.</P>
<P>   The movie, a joint venture of Miramax Films and Paramount
Pictures, is a rich and imaginative fable which uses the sliding
doors of a tube in London's underground as a metaphor for
opportunities lost and gained.  Directed smartly by Peter
Hate from his own screenplay and edited crisply by John
Smith, "Sliding Doors" is a heartfelt romance of the "what if"
genre, which considers the importance of a single split second
in the life of a publicist for a high-class London firm who
misses a train home by a hair.  The mischance will probably
leave all viewers in the audience thinking about how their own
lives would have been very different if they had not happened
upon a single occurrence which altered their destinies. 
Though the doors close on her just before she can enter, she
retraces her steps in her own imagination, backtracking up the
stairs and then dashing a bit more quickly this time.  She
wriggles through and arrives just in time to catch her
lover, Gerry (John Lynch) in a position with Lydia (Jeanne
Tripplehorn) which is so compromising that Gerry does not
even try to say, "It's not the way it looks."</P>
<P>   A conventional picture could easily extract a couple of
hours of adventure from this flight of fancy, framing the action
by having the dreamer wake up just as things reach a high
point.  Howitt, however, has something else in mind.  Splitting
Helen into two people, one being the realistic person who
misses the train and goes about her life as it really unfolds,
the other the fanciful Helen who immerses herself in a far
more strained enterprise.  Now you see the long-haired Helen
returning to her boy friend only vaguely speculating that
something's amiss (she spots two brandy glasses in a pile of
laundry); now you see the short-haired, fanciful Helen who
catches Gerry in flagrante delicto.</P>
<P>    Obviously the woman of the vision has the more
interesting adventure.  Having walked out on Gerry, she runs
through an affair of the heart with a witty man, James (John
Hannah), whom she has met on the tube.  Finding herself on
the rebound, she keeps the new relationship on the slow track
while staying at the home of her best friend, Anna (Zana
Turner), who advises her and enjoys a vicarious thrill from
listening to her accounts, a narrative that gathers momentum
when Gerry returns to compete with James for Helen's
affection.</P>
<P>   "Sliding Doors" is what some would call a date movie, a
frothy confection whose two Helens avoid confusing the
audience since we know that the short-haired romantic is the
one who has been dumped and who is now leading a far
more interesting life both professionally and romantically.  The
dialogue is smooth, reminding one of the give and take of
Edward Burns's "The Brothers McMullen," and featuring a
surprisingly acerbic role by Jeanne Tripplehorn as Lydia,
Gerry's other girl friend, a manipulative and mean woman who
will stop at little short of murder to divert her man's attentions
from the far more desirable Helen.  The movie displays a
Gwyneth Paltrow who still conveys the culture of a highly
educated and classy woman but who can safely play
contemporary characters as well as she can interpret
Jeffersonian contemporaries.  Though the concluding scenes--
which draw the two halves of Helen together--seem contrived,
the story as a whole is resourceful, amusing, and a delight to
watch.  Rated R.  Running Time: 108 minutes.  (C) 1998
