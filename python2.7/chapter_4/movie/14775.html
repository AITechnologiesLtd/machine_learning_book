<PRE>        LOVERS OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE (Spanish with subtitles)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: A tender love about love, fate, and the power of
coincidence.  This is the story of Ana and Otto who love each other
from childhood, become foster brother and sister, lovers, and finally
have linked fates within the Arctic Circle.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low
+2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Written and directed by Julio Medem.
   - Arctic plane crash under the credits, a teaser for what will
     happen in the final reel.
   - Story is told in chapters, usually alternating between "Otto" and
     "Ana."
   - Otto as a child loves paper airplanes.  He flies dozens over the
     school playground setting several plot lines in motion.  Otto's
     father meets Ana's mother and leaves Otto's mother for her.  Otto
     and Ana fall in love even though they are living like brother and
     sister.  They have a secret love affair in their parents' house.
   - Stories and flashbacks keep interconnecting with each other.
   - Otto who has left his mother's house to live with his father and
     Ana then blames himself for his mother's death.  Theme of guilt
     and shame.
   - There is some nudity in some nicely filmed love scenes.  Spanish
     films usually seem to have interesting approaches to their
     frequent nude scenes.
   - Supposedly story is told from one character's point of view or the
     other's.  Yet scenes in which they come close but do not see each
     other cannot be from either's point of view, or how would they
     have known?
   - Characters believe very heavily in power of coincidence and
     coincidence is what drives the story.  Some of the coincidences
     are extremely far-fetched.
   - End of film seems very contrived.</P>
