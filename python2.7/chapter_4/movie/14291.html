<PRE>COP LAND</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  **1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>The local sheriff of a small town has turned a blind eye to its criminal
inhabitants for years.  The bad guys are bad, all right, but they've also
kept a certain kind of order.  The sheriff figures that as long as worse
criminal elements are kept at bay, and peace is the rule, there's no use
making waves.  Then one day, the sheriff's conscience begins to bother him,
and he remembers why he became sheriff in the first place.  Inspired by the
appearance of another law enforcement officer who has continued the fight
for justice in the midst of corruption, the sheriff resolves to persevere in
the face of overwhelming odds and fight for right once again, culminating in
a showdown at dawn.</P>
<P>Sound like a classic western?  Something with Gary Cooper?  John Wayne?
Actually, it's Sylvester Stallone, and the small town is in modern day New
Jersey.</P>
<P>Yes, you heard me right, and no, I'm not off my rocker.  The movie is James
Mangold's COP LAND, which plays itself out like a western for our time.  The
town is called Garrison, aptly named because it is populated by New York
City transit cops who have gotten out of the perilous Big Apple and built
themselves a suburban community across the river in New Jersey (so maybe the
movie is an "eastern").  Stallone plays Sheriff Freddy Heflin, a
slow-witted, overweight man with one bad ear that has prevented him from
becoming NYPD himself.  With cops all around, Heflin's biggest job is
finding out who's been dumping trash in front of other people's yards.  The
guy doesn't even give out parking tickets, since most of the cars belong to
cops.  "Real" cops.</P>
<P>It seems most of the NYPD living in Garrison has their hand in something,
and the cop who controls it all is Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel).  Donlan is
something of a celebrity and power broker within the NYPD - everybody knows
him, and he gets what he wants.  Donlan's nephew Murray Babitch (Michael
Rappaport), also a cop, gets into trouble for shooting a couple of unarmed
black youths on the George Washington Bridge, and Donlan covers it up by
faking Babitch's suicide and hiding him out.  Internal affairs investigator
Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) suspects Donlan's activities and asks Heflin for
help, but Donlan gets the investigation called off by one phone call to the
New York City mayor.  With Tilden's hands tied, Heflin alone must uncover
the plot and bring Babitch in.</P>
<P>As I'm sure other reviewers will note, this is easily Stallone's best
performance since ROCKY.  He plays a character who is understated because
the script calls for it, but is even more so because we don't expect it.
This is Sylvester Stallone, after all, and here he is backing down even
before a confrontation develops.  To watch him play this character is
somewhat shocking at first, but due to the merit of his performance, we
quickly accept him in the role and move on.  Even better, Stallone takes the
shy Heflin and gradually increases his assertiveness and alters his meek
complacency over the course of the film.  You want character development?
This is it.</P>
<P>Stallone is surrounded by a wealth of acting talent.  I mean, come on -
Keitel and De Niro (hey, I just realized that they were both in TAXI DRIVER)
should be enough said, but Ray Liotta, Annabella Sciorra, and even Robert
Patrick (that's right, the T-1000 from TERMINATOR 2:  JUDGMENT DAY) are no
slouches, either.  Liotta plays Gary Figgis, Heflin's friend and a cop who
happens to be fed up with Donlan and his flunkies.  Sciorra is Liz Randone,
whom Heflin saved from drowning years ago as a teenager.  His act of heroics
is the reason why he's partially deaf and can't live the life he's always
wanted to.  Patrick plays Jack Duffy, another cop and Donlan's right-hand
man.  All actors portray their characters well and contribute to the
advancement of the plot.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, with all this talent, you're left wanting more than what
you're given.  You want to see more screen time for some of the
actors/characters.  Most characters in the film are interesting, and at a
slightly clipped running time of 104 minutes, there could have been enough
leeway to give them the extra scenes.  It's too bad, since a couple of the
plot threads, like Heflin's relationship with Liz, and Tilden's
investigation into Donlan's mob connections, could have easily been explored
further.</P>
<P>Another problem is the film's closeness to a western.  Because we know what
happens in most westerns, once we recognize the pattern in COP LAND, we know
what the outcome will be.  At that point, almost all of the tension and
anticipation drops out the bottom, leaving only a curiosity regarding the
technicalities of how the inevitable conclusion will be played.</P>
<P>COP LAND may not be a masterpiece, but it does showcase some solid acting
that's worth seeing.  I just hope Stallone hangs on to the dramatic bug
again after such a long hiatus.  Given the right circumstances, he'll
surprise you with how good he is.</P>
<P>Note:  Stallone reportedly gained between 20 and 40 pounds for this role,
and he's been lauded for this.  How come when I gain a couple of pounds,
people just tell me I'm starting to look a little thick?  Oh, the injustices
of the world....</P>
