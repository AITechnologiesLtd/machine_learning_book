<PRE>DEEP BLUE SEA
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  1/2</PRE>
<P>DEEP BLUE SEA is a movie about intelligence and the lack thereof.</P>
<P>On the intelligent side are 3 jumbo-sized, killer sharks. Through
genetic engineering they have had their brains dramatically enlarged.
This causes them to be super-smart killing machines. Don't worry, this
is all for a noble purpose, the eradication of Alzheimer's Disease. (I'm
not making this up.)</P>
<P>On the unintelligent side is just about everyone else. The characters in
the story make one stupid decision after another, as if they were trying
hard to fail the ultimate pop quiz.</P>
<P>When trapped several stories underground in a platform at sea, for
example, the people in the movie just stare as a shark slowly breaks the
plate glass in front of them. Only when a river of water knocks them
over do they begin to beat a hasty retreat.</P>
<P>A question should also be raised about the sanity of the film's backers.
Director Renny Harlin has become known, of late, for his overbudget,
lavish fiascoes that bomb at the box office. When he first pitched the
movie, he should have been turned down flat. A disaster movie set in the
ocean, in which we watch sharks slowly eat most of the cast, isn't
exactly original or interesting. And the script by Duncan Kennedy, Wayne
Powers and Donna Powers is completely ridiculous.</P>
<P>The movie wastes the first half-hour slowly introducing us to the
players. (If you get the urge to walk out during this dead period, do
not resist.)</P>
<P>Saffron Burrows plays Dr. Susan McAlester, who is perfectly willing to
sacrifice everyone in the name of science -- her father had Alzheimer's,
you see. As Carter Blake, Thomas Jane is the diver who's never found any
action too risky. Samuel L. Jackson plays the project's financial
backer, Russell Franklin, a mountain climber who recently survived an
avalanche. There are many others. The filmmakers need plenty of shark
food. Finally, the only cast member to insert any humanity into the
picture is LL Cool J as the religious, cross-carrying cook.</P>
<P>Played seriously, the movie is no parody, although it becomes so
ludicrous that you will laugh, and loudly, on occasion. But this
laughter is that of pain as you realize what an awful movie the studios
are subjecting you to. Castor oil would taste good in comparison. The
film is definitely worst of the year material. On the other hand, if
they start giving awards for actors who manage to keep a straight face
during a ridiculous farce, every member of this cast would be
contenders, save LL Cool J, who seems to understand how noisome it is.</P>
<P>"It's pretty scary stuff, huh?" scientist Janet Winters (Jacqueline
McKenzie) asks Franklin about the sharks. "Yeah, it is," he agrees. The
problem in the movie is that no matter how many people are bitten in
two, it's never the least bit scary because it's never credible. Fear
comes only when you can believe what you see. Nothing in DEEP BLUE SEA
is the least bit believable.</P>
<P>The list of nonsensical events in the movie is endless. As another
example, they call their local flying doctor service in the middle of a
hurricane. With gale force winds and seas in excess of thirty feet, the
helicopter comes anyway and chooses to fly close to the water. Through a
miracle of miracles, the helicopter crew attaches the injured to a
cable, which goes a few feet above the shark tank. Now, is there anyone
who can't guess the success of the helicopter's mission?</P>
<P>Is there any scene worth saving in the movie? Yes, the film contains,
hands-down, the best anti-smoking commercial imaginable.</P>
<P>DEEP BLUE SEA runs way too long at 1:45. It is rated R for graphic shark
attacks and for language. The movie would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
