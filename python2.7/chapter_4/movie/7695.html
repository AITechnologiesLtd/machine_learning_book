<PRE>                                 ADDICTED TO LOVE
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
          Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: ** (maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>Appealing actors alone do not a romantic comedy make.  The genre defines a
film that is light, charming, and cute.  While "Addicted to Love" is
certainly all of those things to a degree, and *does* offer the charismatic
Meg Ryan and Matthew Broderick, for some reason it's missing that magical
spark that puts it in the same league as, say, "When Harry Met Sally..."</P>
<P>When his girlfriend Linda (Kelly Preston) jilts him for a French
restarauteur, Sam (Broderick) heads for the big city to try and win her
back.  Sam, an astronomer by profession, holes up in an abandoned building
across the alley from his ex and rigs up an elaborate camera obscura to spy
on her.  This fantastical device, constructed from bits and pieces from the
office, projects fuzzy images of his former lover's comings and goings onto
the whitewashed walls of his hideout like a big screen TV.  Clearly he made
the wrong career choice somewhere down the line; few private investigators
get this good a look at their quarry.</P>
<P>When an unwelcome visitor, Maggie (Ryan) drops in on Sam's stakeout, it's
soon clear why.  This guy Anton (Tcheky Karyo) that Linda is, er, seeing,
is Maggie's ex.  Et voila!  Maggie's contributions to the surveillance
operation include a cactus--quirky--and a number of strategically-placed
microphones, which pick up every sigh, gasp, and moan from the neighboring
love loft.</P>
<P>Sam and Maggie's voyeuristic goals are very different, however.  Sam is
gathering data in a scientific attempt to chart Linda and Anton's
inevitable break-up.  For the star-struck Sam, Linda's condition is just a
passing phase, like a new moon.  Maggie, on the other hand, simply wants to
exact revenge.</P>
<P>The contrivances of the script are mostly predictable (letting cockroaches
loose in a restaurant, for example), although it is amusing hearing Anton
explain to Linda why he smells like expensive perfume, or has lipstick on
his collar.  "Why would I have sex with ze hamburger when I can make love
to ze steak?" gasps Anton in his defense.  Maggie and Sam grimace more than
usual during that interpersonal exchange.</P>
<P>At one point the film turns into "Mystery Science Theater 3000," with a
tipsy Ryan and Broderick sitting in for the wise-cracking robots, dubbing
the muted lines of their rivals with much wit and pathos.  Less charming is
Maureen Stapleton's character, who shows up for five minutes simply to tell
Ryan "your tits look like rocks."  And frankly, Broderick is starting to
lose some of that puppy-ish charm that has worked so well for him in the
past.</P>
<P>"Love can sometimes be a very difficult thing," begins Linda's 'Dear John'
letter to Sam early on in the picture.  Watching "Addicted to Love" can be
occasionally tedious, but it's not without its moments.</P>
