<PRE>Good Fella on the Couch
Analyze This</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>I gotta tell you, I was preparing to wince. I mean the previews didn't look
too promising and the ad in the paper made the two top name actors look like
they were pleading for our forgiveness for making such a stupid movie. And
De Niro, I just didn't know if I was ready to see a film hero make a fool of
himself.</P>
<P>My premonitions were all in vain. "Analyze This" is a respectably funny
piece of work. Crystal was as good as ever, and De Niro didn't let me
down -- even when he cried like a big thug baby. In fact, I'm very impressed
with him for taking that kind of risk (and also for not making a buffoon of
himself). Who else could have played the part of a Mafioso gang boss gone
all mushy funnier than an actor that we all hold with such high and hardened
wise-guy esteem?</P>
<P>I think you know the story, gangland boss Paul Vitti (De Niro) goes soft
(under more than one type of situation) so he hires (loosely kidnaps) a
shrink (Billy Crystal) to put his head back together. Wonderfully neurotic
Lisa Kudrow plays Billy's wife to be.</P>
<P>As I left the theater, I overheard a couple discussing the film ... "It was
good, but not great." Be that as it may, let me tell you -- not only did I
laugh a lot, but I went home with a nagging desire to play a Tony Bennett or
Louis Prima CD.</P>
<P>Starring Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. Directed by Harold Ramis. Rated
R.
Produced by Paula Weinstein and Jane Rosenthal at Village Roadshow/Warner
Brothers.</P>
