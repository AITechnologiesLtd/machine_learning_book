<PRE>HIT AND RUNWAY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>In Christopher Livingston's HIT AND RUNWAY, two reluctant writing 
partners, Alex Andero (Michael Parducci), a straight Italian, and Elliot 
Springer (Peter Jacobson), a gay Jew, join forces to develop a script 
for a Hollywood producer who wants a new project for Jagger Stevens 
(Hoyt Richards), his Clint Eastwood-style star.  Just in case we miss 
the similarities, the movie has Jagger say things like "Make my day!"  
And lest we miss the connection between Elliot's brand of Jewish humor 
and Woody Allen's, there is a dream sequence in which Elliot sounds just 
like Woody.</P>
<P>Since Alex, who lives in the basement of his family's restaurant, is 
just learning the art of screenwriting at a class, he prevails upon 
Elliot to help him turn his action film, also titled HIT AND RUNWAY, 
into a comedy as the producer wants.  About an undercover cop who 
investigates international crimes in the world of fashion models, this 
movie within the movie has the potential for some nice parody but get 
little screen time.  Instead, the film mainly concerns the petty 
bickering between Alex and Elliot and between Elliot and his young 
boyfriend, Joey Worciuekowski (Kerr Smith).  Joint screenwriting is 
"kind of like a marriage, only the people have to talk to each other," 
Elliot warns Alex.  Of course, Elliot and Alex's screenwriting marriage 
will be a highly dysfunctional one that will end in divorce.</P>
<P>Most of the comedy is flat and obvious.  As if it is some huge 
revelation, Elliot explains to Alex that the gay culture has a caste 
system in which the best looking men only date other similar hunks. This 
sounds exactly like the straight world, ignoring, of course, Julia 
Roberts brief marriage with Lyle Lovett, which gave false hopes to 
average looking men all over the planet.</P>
<P>Like a jet without enough power to lift off the runway, the film just 
taxis around slowly.  Slack pacing is deadly for comedy, especially for 
one like this in which the good lines are few and far between.  Even the 
best lines aren't anything to write home about.  "I think I need 
something more neutral on the walls," Joey says in the film's best 
interchange.  "You could always hang up a map of Switzerland," Elliot 
suggests as a solution.</P>
<P>HIT AND RUNWAY runs a very long 1:48.  It is rated R for language, 
sexual content and some violent images and would be acceptable for most 
teenagers.</P>
