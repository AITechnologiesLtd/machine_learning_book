                             FALLEN</PRE>
<P>Supernatural films all have the same problem, that of making the
story seem reasonable.  That is quite a challenge.  Unfortunately,
about the only thing that would make an audience believe FALLEN is
that the personable Denzel Washington is the star.    He is
Detective John Hobbes in an unnamed city (but filmed in
Philadelphia.)</P>
<P>Detective Hobbes had witnessed the execution of killer Edgar Reese
(Elias Koteas). It is odd that the ever-observant detective (as he
himself tells us in a voice over) did not think it strange that
Reese seemed to take the impending execution very calmly, even
singing "Time Is On My Side" as he is about to be gassed.</P>
<P> Shortly thereafter there occurs a series of murders which although
having all the earmarks of Reese's style, are nevertheless the
apparent work of other killers.  It is Hobbes' assignment to find
out what is happening and to put an end to it.   Easier said than
done as Hobbes ponders whether these are copycat murderers or
perhaps something more strange.   To help him, he seeks the advice
of Greta Milano (Embeth Davitz) who is a professor of theology, well
versed in the supernatural. It is she who tells Hobbes that he is
dealing with Azazel, an angel who has fallen from grace but who has
the ability by a mere touch to invade a person's body.   In fact we
see him walking along the street, touching people apparently at
random as he moves from one human to another..   While it is shown
that Azazel is out to get Hobbes, we are never quite told why Hobbes
himself appears to be immune to invasion of his body.</P>
<P>The film's ending does provide some surprises but by that time it is
too late to be saved.</P>
<P> The supporting cast helps the film but only to a degree.   Jonesy
(John Goodman) is Hobbes' partner.  Donald Sutherland is Lieutenant
Stanton in the police department. Lou (James Gandolfini) is the
sneaky-looking detective.  But all are to no avail.</P>
