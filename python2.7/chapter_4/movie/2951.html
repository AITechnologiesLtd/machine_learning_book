<PRE>                                    ONLY YOU
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Marisa Tomei, Robert Downey Jr., Bonnie Hunt, Joaquim de
Almeida, Fisher Stevens.
Screenplay:  Diane Drake.
Director:  Norman Jewison.</P>
<P>     Ingredients: one lost shoe found by a handsome suitor, a gypsy
selling roses, a street corner saxophone player, a carriage ride,
beautiful Italian scenery (including canal boats in Venice), the moon,
the stars, and a version of the title song by Louie Armstrong.  Oh, and
a reference to ROMAN HOLIDAY.  And a nice-but-uninspiring guy for the
heroine to throw over.  Have I forgotten anything?  It doesn't appear
that the makers of ONLY YOU have.  It is packed to bursting with
everything that a Hollywood romance is supposed to have--except any
connection between its stars.  As a result, its agonizing cuteness
becomes all the more agonizing, and the hole at its center positively
gapes.</P>
<P>     ONLY YOU stars Marisa Tomei as Faith Corvatch, a lifelong romantic
who was told as an adolescent (by a Ouija board and a fortune teller)
that she is destined to marry someone named Damon Bradley.  Fourteen
years later, she is preparing to marry someone *not* named Damon
Bradley, a podiatrist named Dwayne.  All that changes when Faith gets a
call from an old friend of Dwayne's named ... Damon Bradley.  With best
friend Kathy (Bonnie Hunt) in tow, Faith races off for Italy on the off
chance that she might meet the man who is her destiny.  Then she does
meet a man (Robert Downey Jr.) who sweeps her off her feet and
re-introduces her to romance--only his name may or may not actually
be Damon Bradley.</P>
<P>     There is a trend which has developed in film romances in the last
couple of years (including SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE and, to a certain
extent, FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL) which has made me wary of them
even before they appear.  They are no longer about romances which
blossom between real people in the course of actual interaction;
instead, they are the worst kind of pop fairy tales, selling
infatuation with a romanticized ideal as true love.  Marisa Tomei and
Robert Downey Jr. end up together (and please, no one try to tell me
that I'm spoiling anything by revealing that fact) because that's the
way it has to end.  Not because these characters learn anything about
each other that would make them want to learn more, and not because
they seem right for each other.  For most of the film, their
relationship is based on self-delusion and lies.  However, since it's
all accompanied by carriage rides and flowers and beautiful Italian
scenery, it passes for a love story.  And that's fairly sad.</P>
<P>     Equally sad is that there is a supporting story to ONLY YOU which
is infinitely more interesting and touching, and might have made for a
movie I would truly have enjoyed.  Bonnie Hunt gives a winning
performance as Kathy, a woman whose marriage to Faith's loutish brother
Larry (Fisher Stevens) has left her wounded and bitter.  "I married a
liar," she says at one point.  "Why?  Because I married a man."  Her
tentative romance with a smooth-talking Italian (Joaquim de Almeida of
CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER) is the one thing in ONLY YOU which rings
true, and watching her struggle with her feelings about her marriage is
genuinely affecting.  Unfortunately, the story isn't about Kathy, and I
just didn't care about Faith's quest for Damon.</P>
<P>     Individually, as performers, I generally like Marisa Tomei and
Robert Downey Jr.  Both usually appear very natural on screen, and
Downey in particular shows the potential to be a solid, charming
romantic leading man.  In ONLY YOU, however, his lovable rascal is
completely one-dimensional, and the script's attempts to justify his
behavior don't sell.  Tomei has it even worse, directed by Norman
Jewison to a teeth-aching level of adorableness, but that's just
indicative of how everything in ONLY YOU is pitched:  lay on the syrupy
score, emphasize Sven Nykvist's cinematography, throw in romantic
signifiers by the dozen.  What it all adds up to is a film so
mechanical you can almost hear the gears grinding.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Roman holidays:  4.</PRE>
