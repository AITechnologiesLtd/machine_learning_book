<P>This film was one of the nominees for the Oscar's FOREIGN FILM Award this
year.  And it is a worthy candidate, that stands out as a special film as it
does very quietly, and slowly, what only the likes of David Lean have been
able to do.  Tell a story where the country itself is the story.  Few film
makers have been able to get the setting to come alive, a veritable desert
full of mirages and thoughts
that keep one coming and going.</P>
<P>Using all Mongolian actors, it is the story of a family that farms in the
middle of nowhere land, and they have their habits and ways of doing things.
Their style of lovemaking, or at least of chasing for
lovemaking, is literally the old Mongolian way.... a real chase on
horseback, which unfortunately for Gombo, is in violation of the new Chinese
laws that limit the number of children.  But Gombo, as
old fashioned as he is, and unable to come to terms with the present
commodities of childbirth control ( he is a country boy and she is a city
girl.... ) at least maintains himself long enough until he is ready
to burst out.  He can't find the answers he is trying to find on his way to
town, to trade for what he has to offer, but the town's ways with religion
and drinking also have nothing to help him with.  He returns empty handed
ready for another chase, his only real love being the woman he has married
and the wild country.</P>
<P>The acting in this film is either total, or it is a dedicated job to
showcase some very strong people that live in incredible at odds with nature
itself.  It is smooth, moody when it has to, and well designed
by a director that knows the difference between the use of space and camera
to display to us, their dilemmas... very much theatre style, only alive
instead of staged.  The distancing between people
is a measure of their ability to understand or communicate.</P>
<P>While the film stops short of saying anything about this way of life, it
does suggest that modernization is about to destroy the myths and the
legends of this once proud and great people that were systematically
dismantled by both the Chinese and the Japanese in this century.  But if the
new life of modern creatures is coming, it has no hint of the wild life that
these peoples had lived.  The town is structured in such a way as to make
things difficult to get done, the priest is too busy praying, the doctor is
too busy dating, and the Russian visitor  is too busy drinking, all a
statement on the frustration of life these people have and suffer in their
everyday existence.  Gombo is not about to let this get in the way of his
feelings.</P>
<P>He returns, and while he does not bring from the town what he was asked to
bring, he does bring with him a certain vivacity and explosive desire, which
the wife, at first upset, but then defiant immediately
takes on to.  It doesn't matter that the Chinese have rules.... these are
the Mongolians....... and the ending is very nice and leaves us rather
excited and happy.  The modernization did not stop those
two from creating another child, and it neither did stop their desire for
each other.</P>
<P>Wonderful film.  Long shots, trying to remind us of the beauty of a pristine
country, the once proud culture of the Mongols.</P>
