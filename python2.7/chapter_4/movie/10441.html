A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Anthony Waller</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: 
Anthony Waller, Tim Burns, and Tom Stern </PRE>
<PRE>Starring:
Tom Everett Scott, Julie Delpy, Vince Vieluf, Phil Buckman</PRE>
<P>Ingredients: 
Three young American guys traveling in Paris, cute girl who is a
werewolf by night, a werewolf organization that wants to take over the
world</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS is based on the mythology of an earlier
film: AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON (1981) by John Landis. For those of
you unfamiliar with the AMERICAN WEREWOLF ... formula, the basic
horror/comedy formula for this series is: some young American guys hang
out in Europe to backpack, travel, and meet women. One of them
invariably gets bitten by a werewolf, while another invariably dies. The
spirit of the dead friend is cursed to haunt and give advice to the
surviving friend, who now finds that he transforms into a hairy
man-eating creature at night when the moon is full. AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF
IN LONDON (1981) became an 80s cult classic because of its dark humor
and great special effects transformations. </P>
<P>AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS does not have great special effects (the
wolf creatures don't have natural movement or balance), but it does
contain elements of the same plot formula as AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN
LONDON. In the first ten minutes, it's established that three immature
American main characters are bumbling around Europe daring each other to
do crazy stunts and meet women. When the geekiest of the travelers - -
Andy (Tom Everett Scott) - - tries to impress his friends with a bungee
jump off the Eiffel Tower, he accidentally ends up saving a hot French
babe named Seraphine (Julie Delpy), who is trying to commit suicide from
the top of the tower. Little do the boys know that Seraphine is really a
werewolf. Soon enough, Andy gets bitten by a werewolf, his buddy dies,
and the spirit of the dead friend is cursed to haunt and give advice to
poor Andy - - who now finds that he transforms into a bloodthirsty beast
at night when the moon is full. The third American buddy is captured by
a gang of anti-American French werewolves who want to take over the
world. Meanwhile Seraphine is doing some research on an antidote to cure
lycanthropy (werewolfism). Can Andy and Seraphine cure themselves and
also stop the militant werewolf group from world domination?</P>
<P>Opinion:
I like werewolf movies in general. I also like the first ten minutes of
AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS; it is kind of funny, and it establishes
that - - aside from the wolf story - - some sort of comedic romance is
going to take place. Finally, I like the end of this movie, because it
ties in with the beginning. But the middle of the film really loses me -
- with a dozen side plots about militants taking over the world, causing
and curing lycanthropy, a mysterious patient on a respirator, a needless
breast-feeling scene, an unresolved female American tourist undead
spirit character, confusing new werewolf lore about eating the heart of
the werewolf that bit you, and so on. I ended up with more questions
than I came in with. In my opinion, they should simplify the middle of
this movie by weeding out unnecessary unresolved subplots and
characters, and then find a way to make it humorous and witty - -
instead of suspenseless and confusing.</P>
