<PRE>TRAINING DAY
------------</PRE>
<P>Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke, "Snow Falling on Cedars") has one day to prove to
new senior partner Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) that he has what it
takes to be a NARC in his quest to advance to police detective.  In 24
hours, Jake will experience the ultimate corruption of a cop who's lost 
his soul to the environment he originally served and protected in "Training
Day."</P>
<P>Director Antoine Fuqua ("The Replacement Killers") takes to the streets of
South Central, Watts, Inglewood, and the Imperial Courts housing project
to give his film authenticity, but screenwriter David Ayer ("The Fast and the 
Furious") trots out too much evil to believably comprehend within his
dawn to dead-of-night structure.  Given that limitation, Denzel Washington
gives a performance that glints like steel while Ethan Hawke meets him
head-on.</P>
<P>Jake's day begins when Alonzo calls him at home, instructs him to skip 
roll call and meet him at an inner city breakfast joint.  Jake's attempts
at small talk are rebuffed as Alonzo immediately challenges the young man
to show his mettle.  College kids hitting the bad part of town to score
pot are shaken down at gun point, relieved of their weed and let go, then
Jake's told to smoke the stuff, as a true NARC needs to understand drugs
first hand.  Jake allows himself to be convinced before he's told that 
the pot was laced with PCP.</P>
<P>In a move that will prove fortuitous later, Jake single handedly saves 
a young Latina from rape at the hands of two junkies.  Once again, Alonzo
delivers street justice, beating the men senseless, but not arresting them.
When Alonzo's methods with a wheelchair bound pusher (Snoop Dog) prove 
effective, Jake begins to come around, but it's short lived.  Jake learns
that Alonzo's in trouble, having pushed the Russian mob too far by killing
one of their own in Las Vegas, and Alonzo's willing to go to any length
to pay his debt and remain the street czar of the inner city.</P>
<P>Washington proves here that he's as fine an actor playing compromised evil
as he is at the noble, heroic roles he usually takes on.  He initially seduces
the audience along with Jake, soothingly smoothing over his radical actions
with rhetoric like his signature line, 'to protect the sheep you gotta kill
the wolf and it takes a wolf to kill the wolf.'  But Washington always keeps
us unbalanced as well, punctuating his words with an underhanded snicker.
Hawke is the real surprise, going toe to toe with Washington while providing
our point of view.  Hawke makes Jake an idealized young man who toughens up
first for the wrong, then the right, reasons as he realizes he must trust
his own instinct and principles.</P>
<P>Support is terrific in many small roles too numerous to mention.  Macy Gray
is a standout as a dragon lady of a dealer's wife reacting to a falsified
warrant.  Cliff Curtis ("Blow") is the only creditted member of a Latino
threesome Alonzo leaves Jake with - ironically the four actors provide the
best scene in the film without Washington, although ultimately Ayer leaves
them to end the bit on a note that plays too much like a fairy tale.</P>
<P>Director of Photography Mauro Fiore ("Driven") smoothly captures the action,
from both within Alonzo's menacing black 1978 Monte Carlo low rider and
outside as it glides over the orange-hued, rain slicked streets of sunset.  
He maintains the tension in the interiors of South Central and the hidden
domains of the LAPD's underground.  Production designer Naomi Shohan 
("American Beauty") maintains a shadow world (even when brightly lit) rooted 
in reality, which Mark Mancina's ("Speed") score reflects by placing
shivery highlights over the ethnic music of the neighborhoods.  Fuqua's
direction is confident, delivering not just the style seen in his "The
Replacement Killers," but the substance of full characterizations as well.</P>
<P>"Training Day" is a good film held back from greatness by the excesses of
its script.</P>
