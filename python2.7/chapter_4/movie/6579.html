<P>     In the late 70s and early 80s, theater screens were overrun by a film
genre which had primarily teenage audiences filling the seats and
sociologists shaking their heads.  It was the golden age -- if that isn't
a gross misapplication of the term -- of the slasher movie, where
cutlery-wielding crazies turned every possible day on the calendar
(HALLOWEEN, FRIDAY THE 13TH, PROM NIGHT, MOTHER'S DAY, MY BLOODY
VALENTINE) into a stomach-churning ordeal.  These films usually differed
only in the manner of the violent killings, leading to a numbing
predictability deserving only of parody.  Wes Craven's SCREAM wants to
have some fun with the conventions of the slasher movie, but not at the
expense of providing a few scares of its own.  That presents problems as
well as opportunities, as the self-aware script sometimes diffuses the
tension Craven can create as a director.</P>
<P>     In SCREAM, the students at Woodsboro High are facing more profound
problems than the usual homework and bad skin.  Two students have been
murdered -- stalked and disemboweled by a lunatic -- and everyone is on
edge, particularly Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell).  It is nearing the
first anniversary of the day Sidney's mother was raped and murdered, and
when the masked killer comes after Sidney, she begins to wonder if the two
events are related.  Tabloid TV reporter Gail Weathers (Courteney Cox)
wonders, too, and she becomes determined to find out the connection
between Sidney and the murders.  As students gather for a party, including
Sidney, her boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich) and best friend Tatum (Rose
McGowan), the reporter stakes out the scene, waiting for the inevitable
bloodbath.</P>
<P>     As SCREAM begins, it looks like it is going to be a fairly
conventional horror film, if an unusually gripping one.  A 12-minute
prologue finds Drew Barrymore terrorized over the phone by the killer,
quizzed on horror movie trivia to save her life.  Most of the familiar
tropes of the slasher movie are in place -- the absentee parents, the
improbably massive house with plenty of glass, the ever-alarming ringing
phone -- but the sequence is still scary stuff, with Barrymore providing
an effective and convincing portrait of mounting panic.  Though much of
SCREAM becomes a joke at the expense of monotonously violent horror films,
Craven is not about to spit in the face of the genre which made his
career.  Horror films in general are not the target in SCREAM -- horror
films with no style or imagination are, and Craven provides both
throughout the film, though nowhere as effectively as the opening.</P>
<P>     What happens between the scares is what gives SCREAM its knowing
edge.  Kevin Williamson's script is loaded with references to horror films
-- it seems that half a dozen are aimed at Craven alone -- and loaded with
characters who have seen other horror films.  Many of those references are
spelled out quite literally, and they are the least interesting.  When one
character explains the "rules" of the slasher film, including the "sex
equals death" paradigm, it seems as though Williamson believes he is the
first person to have noticed them.  Some of the most subversive humor is
the least obvious, however.  One young woman is unable to escape the
killer through a doggie door because -- like all horror film ingenues --
her breasts are nearly as large as her head; another running gag finds the
masked killer repeatedly knocked around like one of the Three Stooges.
SCREAM also turns into something of a whodunnit, a rarity among slasher
films, and Williamson and Craven trot out plenty of suspects:  moody
boyfriend Billy (Ulrich, looking more like Johnny Depp than Depp himself),
Billy's wired friend Stu (Matthew Lillard), a repressed video clerk (Jamie
Kennedy), the mild-mannered deputy (David Arquette), the school principal
(Henry Winkler!) and even Sidney's father.  SCREAM plays with expectations
effectively, making the guessing game part of the in-joke.</P>
<P>     The guessing ends in a climax which, while certainly surprising,
isn't particularly effective.  It is also excessively drawn out, as writer
and director seem to engage in an ideological battle over whether it is
going to be the climax to a horror film or a commentary on the climaxes of
horror films.  In the end it is both, which is to say that it is neither.
Some of the gags are quite funny, but the suspense all but vanishes in the
final fifteen minutes as the characters talk their way through a
comparison of this finale to the traditional finale.  The script for
SCREAM is not clever enough to provide a consistently witty thriller; it
is sometimes witty and sometimes thrilling, but never both.  That alone
makes SCREAM stand out from its genre cousins, though, as Wes Craven
reminds us that terror can be fun, and not simply a grueling march
through gore-spattered holidays.</P>
