<PRE>MEN BEHAVING LIKE NINNIES</PRE>
<P>A romantic comedy about Irish Catholic brothers living in New York
with skewed life philosophies, screwing up their relationships with 
women. With a $25,000 budget and a bunch of unknown actors, Edward Burns 
wrote, directed and starred in this movie last year and called it THE 
BROTHERS MCMULLEN.  This year, with a $3 million budget and some big 
name stars, he's done the same story and called it SHE'S THE ONE.  The 
first movie was a little home-made masterpiece that charmed with its 
fault-ridden but likeable characters, cynically witty but not smart-ass 
script, and fine acting all around.  SHE'S THE ONE, on the other hand, 
is just a waste of good Tom Petty music.  As Irish Catholic brothers 
who've screwed up their love lives must be wont to say, "What the hell 
went wrong?"</P>
<P>Ostensibly, the story is about the brothers Fitzpatrick, their
women, and their gruff but well-meaning father.  Mickey (Burns) is the
karmically damaged elder brother who after discovering his former fiance
Heather (Cameron Diaz) in bed with another man, gives up on life and
becomes a taxi cab driver, to the disgust of his brother Francis (Mike
McGlone).  </P>
<P>Francis is a successful but discontented Wall Street executive who
is neurotically competitive about everything and doesn't want to have
sex with his wife (Jennifer Aniston) because he rationalizes that it
would be like cheating on his mistress, who happens to be his brother's
ex-fiance Heather.  And as if things weren't bad enough for them, they
also have to cope with their father (John Mahoney, FRASIER's dad on TV),
a veritable font of bad advice and confused logic, and Hope (Maxine
Bahns - Burns' girlfriend in THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN, Burns' girlfriend in
real life), Mickey's new girlfriend, a suspiciously romantic waif who
marries him the day after she meets him, while neglecting to tell him
that she intends to leave for Paris in a few weeks.</P>
<P>Emotional chaos erupts when Mickey finds out about Francis's
affair with Heather, gets mad with him, has second thoughts about his
marriage to Hope, who gets mad at Mickey for getting mad at Francis,
Francis asks Renee for a divorce and proposes to Heather.  Everybody
pretty much gets on each other's nerves and they will get on yours too,
with their self-absorbed whingeing.  </P>
<P>The plot loses both cohesion and momentum about midways through the
show, and if you start losing interest, you might end up hanging on to
the running series of peurile jokes revolving around Francis's
preoccupation with his sexual abilities.  But even on this you'll find
yourself shortchanged because the people on the Board of Film Censorship
have really butchered this one, as according to their own nefarious and
unknowable tenets (the film has a PG-13 rating in America).</P>
<P>If SHE'S THE ONE, like THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN before it is meant to
tell us anything, it is that men, given any event in life more
complicated than drinking beer, fishing with dad, and smoking cigars,
will invariably and without exception act like morons, but forgive them
anyway because they don't know any better.</P>
<P>But while THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN worked because the characters were
believably hung up, and the humour was situational rather than
gag-oriented, SHE'S THE ONE rings hollowly to the very end.  It's mix of
cheap cariactures, smug jokes, smarmy romance and unlikely coincidences
is grating more than anything else.  The final scene, one of the
Fitzpatrick's ritual fishing trips, where Daddy Fitzpatrick lifts the
"no women onboard" rule on his boat to get Mickey and Hope to make up so
that we can have a happy ending is wincingly twee but thankfully brief.</P>
<P>And for those of you who want to watch this show because of
"Friends" star Jennifer Aniston's "debut" performance, you might like to
know that she was previously in a movie called THE LEPRECHAUN, which was
good enough to be a reference in WAYNE'S WORLD II. </P>
<P>The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
 * Wait for the TV2 broadcast. 
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha! 
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend. 
 **** Amazing, potent stuff. 
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
