<P>   Every tour book in the Barnes and Noble travel section
insists that the country covered between its page is the real
find, but truth-to-tell, Mexico is the quintessential destination
for its variety of landscapes.  That exotic and erotic place has
mountains, jungles, cosmopolitan cities, Mayan ruins,
beaches, quaint villages, an ethnic cornupcopia, a cuisine
that has risen to enormous popularity in the U.S., and
wondrous animals--appealing to college kids on spring break,
middle-aged romantics, retireds looking for a cheap, sunny
place to spend their golden years, and more.  The Mexico
that director Gore Verbinski ("Mouse Hunt") chooses to
capture is off the beaten track except to those with a genuine
interest in history, the village of Real de Catorce in the north
central region of San Luis Potosi.  By contrasting the earthy
brown shades of this former silver mining town) with the
gaudy neon of Las Vegas and the commercial look of all
areas photographed in the the environs of that gambling
mecca, lenser Dariusz Wolski creates for the armchair
moviegoer the stark contrast that hits travelers from 
highly-developed U.S. cities when they cross the border and
proceed south.  The divergence between the two cultures is a
significant aspect of the movie appropriately entitled "The
Mexican," mirroring the dissimilarities between its two
principal characters, Jerry (Brad Pitt) and Samantha (Julia
Roberts).</P>
<P>   The key question raised by this contemporary, off-beat,
romantic Western (the best way to label its genre) is:
When two people love each other but can't get it together,
when do they call it quits?  The lovers in this story are two of
Hollywood's most appealing performers, a box office draw
that should bring truckloads of the 20-40-year-olds to the
theaters.  Whether that particular audience will like what they
see will depend on their appreciation for subtleties that were
absent from predictable recent Hollywood fare like "What
Woman Want" and the even more embarrassing "Miss
Congeniality."  In his original screenplay, J.H. Wyman puts
twists and surprises into the two-hour picture that will keep
you off balance, though one particular curve involving the
character of a hit man, Leroy (played by "Soprano" star
James Gandolfini) would have drawn titters a couple of
decades ago but which seems pretty cornball today.</P>
<P>   Driven by character and plot in equal measures, "The
Mexican" is framed by a gorgeous couple, Jerry Welbach and
Samantha Barzel, who appear in the opening and closing
scenes but ply their separate lives during its extended imddle
section.  Jerry and Samantha are engaged but Sam has
made clear that the espousal is off if Jerry insists on going on
yet another underworld job.  When he is given a choice by
gangland big-shot Nayman (Bob Balaban)--who is working for
the currently incarcerated big boss Arnold Margoles (played
by a surprise uncredited actor)--of flying to Mexico to retrieve
a priceless antique gun which is named The Mexican or of
sitting in the trunk of a car while Nayman blows it up, he
chooses survival over his girl friend and takes off for the
cobblestone streets near the Toluca airport.  Easily securing
the pistol from Margoles's grandson, Beck (David
Krumholtz), he finds his troubles only beginning: to insure the
delivery of the pistol, Leroy has seized his ex-fiance.  Leroy is
a hit man whose real identity is unexpected one and whose
personal life is not what you'd anticipate from someone in his
profession.</P>
<P>   Verbinski seems to have good time both sending up
and paying homage to Sam Peckinpah, who was himself an
undisciplined macho youth known for love poems to the
American West such as "Ride the High Country" and
massively bloody violent horse operas like "The Wild Bunch." 
Portraying the Mexicans in broad caricature, Verbinski hones
in at one point on such local scenery as the tough bartender
who issues the obvious, golden haired gringo a bottle of
tequila for twenty bucks and then silently demands a tip for
leading him to the guy who holds the valuable revolver.  In a
tribute as well to the early days of cinema, Verbinski from
time to time stops the flow of the story to flash back to a 19th
Century scene transmitted with a photographic bleach-out
technique involving various interpretations to the legend of
the gun, on which a curse has been placed by a disappointed
suitor whose troth has been handed instead to the town
nobleman.</P>
<P>   Julia Roberts turns out the typical role that has reliably
drawn crowds time after time.  As in "Erin Brockovich," her
emotions are perpetually on her sleeve as she flashes her
eyes, rants and raves against a man she cannot stop loving
but whom she considers too selfish to share a down-to-earth
relationship, and acts in a particularly seductive way to the hit
man who uncharacteristically reveals secrets about a
deficiency of luck in his own love life.  The revelations made
by Leroy and the actions taken by this assassin on the advice
of his hostage give this Western its claim to uniqueness
within the genre.  The chemistry between two of Hollywood's
most attractive personalities is as solid as what you might
feel from the posters advertising the movie.  Pitt and Roberts
appear genuinely to like each other and convincing in
communicating the difficulties they face that keep them
emotionally apart.  In a way "The Mexican" reminded me of
Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's long-running off-Broadway
play "The Fantasticks"--which had a disastrous transfer by
Michael Ritchie to the screen last year--in which the smoke-
and-mirrors trip that one Luisa receives from a Spanish
bandit named El Gallo teaches her that the world outside is
not so nice, allowing her to see her lover Matt as a true hero
and not as the loser she sometimes considered him to be.
Brad Pitt scores in a role that pits him (as well as James
Gandolfini) against type as a loser who until the conclusion of
the tale has been unable to succeed in his job or in his love
life.  For all its comedy, though, "The Mexican" is not the
usual, slick Hollywood movie you might have expected but
off-beat, often surprising, and even demanding.</P>
