<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>     Anyone who has ever been deeply involved in a wedding party knows that
sometimes a wedding is not always so wonderful and romantic as some
sentimentals make it out to be. Julia Roberts has a first hand experience at
this in 'My Best Friend's Wedding'.  Roberts plays a food critic in NYC who
gets a phone call from her best (male) friend (Dermot Mulroney) and he
informs her that he's getting married.  It comes as a shock since its
Wednesday and the wedding is in four days.  Roberts tells her gay editor
(Rupert Everett in the film's best performance in a sly supporting role that
will grow on you) that she has four days to 'break up the wedding' because
she feels the woman marrying Mulroney (Cameron Diaz) is all wrong for him and
that she has secretly been in love with him all these years but somehow
didn't tell him. </P>
<P>     As I was watching this movie I loved part of it and hated part of it.
 That is really strange.  I don't consider myself a romantic and I've only
been to one wedding in the last ten years.  Don't get me wrong, I believe in
marriage; heck, my parents just celebrated their 49th wedding anniversary on
July 1st.  What I really found odd was the mixture of characters being in
this situation and at times appearing very unattractive in their qualities
and at other times I wanted to give each of them a hug.  It was like I was
watching two different people (especially in Roberts and Diaz) with split
personalities.  Julia Roberts is somewhat inept in this film and I didn't
believe it could have taken her so long to confess her love to the man of her
dreams especially when she does it on the day of his wedding.</P>
<P>     'My Best Friend's Wedding' is a fantastic date movie even though it
falls victim to the trappings of old fasioned Hollywood movie making in the
most sentimental of ways and in many ways this in uncharacteristic of the
film's writer (Ronald Bass who won an Oscar for co-writing 1988's 'Rain
Man').  The film's director (P.J. Hogan) must have been responsible for this.
 There is a just ending to this film but it doesn't conclude the way you
might think it will and I wish I could believe that someone as attractive as
Julia Roberts could stay single until she was three weeks away from her 28th
birthday (her age in the film) but women this gorgeous are usually taken long
before that.  At least the movie is honest enough to relay the fact that in
most cases men and women can't have a close platonic relationship without
taking things further because as Billy Crystal said in 'When Harry Met Sally'
-----> "the sex part always gets in the way".  </P>
