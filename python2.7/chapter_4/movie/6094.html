<PRE>                                BIG NIGHT
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The issue of pragmatism vs. ideals
          and the contrast of Old World and New World values
          are treated in a slice-of-life comedy-drama.  Comic
          actor Stanley Tucci shows that he has many film-
          making talents in this bittersweet tale of a
          restaurateur with one final chance to save his
          high-quality restaurant from going under.  This
          film is predictable but touching.  Rating: +1 (-4
          to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Every once in a while a particular performance grabs my attention
and I begin to watch for the actor gave it. Perhaps the best thing
about PRELUDE TO A KISS was the comic acting of Stanley Tucci.  I saw
him several times after that and always liked his performances.  But he
always seemed to have small parts; generally he plays thugs and
henchmen, at least in the films I have seen.  Apparently to actually
star in a film he had to co-write the script, co-produce the film, and
then co-direct it.  But it is worth it to see much more of his acting.</P>
<P>     Tucci plays Secondo, an immigrant from Italy trying to run the
aptly-named Paradise, an Italian restaurant somewhere on the New Jersey
shore in the late 1950s.  Secondo manages the tiny restaurant while his
older brother Primo (Tony Shalhoub) does the cooking.  And what cooking
he does!  Primo is an artist who believes that "to eat good food is to
be close to God."  Eventually we see some of what Primo can do.  Like
BABETTE'S FEAST and  LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE, this is definitely not a
film to see when you are hungry.  Among other things this film is a
paean to great Italian cooking.  The problem is that the customers are
expecting spaghetti and meatballs.  Every dish must have a spaghetti
side dish and most must be buried under cheese.  New Jersey is just not
ready for great authentic Italian cooking in the late 1950s. The
customers just don't get it.  Making things even harder is just down
the street is the fabulously successful Pascal's Italian Grotto.
Pascal (Ian Holm) makes an art of living, not of cooking.  His
philosophies are "bite life in the ass" and "give the people what they
want, then later you can give them what you want."  That "later" may
never come, but in the meantime he is making a fortune selling steaks
and spaghetti with meatballs.  To help the failing brothers he arranges
that the famous singer Louie Prima (playing himself) will come to the
restaurant to eat and thereby endorse the establishment.  The brothers
have one night to demonstrate the best in Italian cuisine for Prima and
some invited friends.  Secondo has to balance the preparations for
dinner with his diffident relationship with his woman friend Phyllis
(Minnie Driver) and his mistress (Isabella Rossellini).</P>
<P>     This is probably Stanley Tucci's favorite role, since he did,
after all, write it for himself.  However his acting is just a little
more reserved than is some other films. Complete with Italian accent he
is certainly believable in the role, but I still prefer some of his
humorous touches in PRELUDE TO A KISS. He is looking for more
authenticity in this part than in some of his others, apparently.  He
seems a little too unflappable as Secondo and the film foregoes some
comic possibilities as a result.  On the other hand Tony Shalhoub is
just a bit over-the-top as Primo boisterously rebuking a boorish
customer or accusing Pascal of "culinary rape."  Even more exaggerated
is Ian Holm's wild and crazy Pascal, literally biting people on the ass
as part of his life-loving routine.  Tucci co-directs with Campbell
Scott (of LONGTIME COMPANION, DEAD AGAIN, and MRS. PARKER AND THE
VICIOUS CIRCLE).</P>
<P>     A well-made period piece is always a pleasure to watch, though
Tucci does not flood us with late-50s detail. Occasionally we notice a
price has been changed, a car has fins, or a pair of glasses has the
same distinctive fin-styling.  The feast itself is complete with titles
for each of the courses and includes some authentic Italian dishes that
are unfamiliar even today.  The photography of food preparation and of
the final product is at times gorgeous, but not all the film is as
well-paced as it might be.  At times the plot just stops dead while the
camera watches somebody prepare food.  In the end there are still many
loose ends intentionally not tied up.  But then not everything in life
is tied up at the end of a day.  BIG NIGHT will leave some audience
members feeling that there should be more to the story, while others
will be happy it is over so that they can proceed to dinner.  I give
BIG NIGHT a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
