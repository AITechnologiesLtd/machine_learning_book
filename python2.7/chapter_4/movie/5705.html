<PRE>                                 KINGPIN
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2</PRE>
<P>        Inane. Vulgar. Cheap. And sometimes very funny. Those 
are my main impressions on KINGPIN, the comedy that turns the 
pathetic, bloated world of bowling upside down. How do I know 
bowling is bloated and pathetic? Because it's the only sport I'm 
good at. And it's the only sport any of the loser characters in 
KINGPIN can claim talent in.</P>
<P>        First there's Woody Harrelson, the scatterbrained bowler 
who beats Bill Murray in the state championship. Murray lures 
naive Woody into participating in a bowling hustle with him, then 
ditches him there when the drunken bowlers want revenge. It's not 
clear exactly what they do to Harrelson, but he alternates between 
a hook and rubber hand on his right arm as a souvenir of that 
fateful night. He spends the next seventeen years drinking and 
pulling small-time hustles to earn money when he finds a new 
prospect.</P>
<P>        That's Randy Quaid, an Amish farmboy who sneaks off 
to the bowling alley and sports a 270 average (per fifteen frames, 
we later find out), whom Harrelson sees as his chance to win the 
million-dollar bowling tournament in Reno. But Quaid won't go 
until Harrelson wears him down by infiltrating the Amish 
community under the name Hezekiah. Quaid finally goes with him 
on the cross-country drive, which includes another bowling hustle 
to keep the cash flow up, after which they flee with the victim's 
girlfriend en tow.</P>
<P>        And that would be Vanessa Angel, USA's "Weird Science" 
babe, whose two requirements in the movie are to wear a lot of tight 
outfits and quarrel with Harrelson, the first of which she does very 
well. Angel is the only beauty in a very ugly movie, both visually 
and metaphorically. Besides having an overall grimy look, 
Harrelson and Murray both have some of the most absurdly-
dated wardrobes and disgusting hair in movie history.</P>
<P>        Metaphorically speaking, KINGPIN has a lot of repulsive 
moments. Cheap sexual innuendoes abound, along with some 
sickening visual gags, the most disgusting of which has Harrelson, 
during the Brother Hezekiah sequence, telling a farmer he milked 
their cow. He has a milk moustache and tells the farmer it took 
some priming the pump but he finally got it flowing, after which 
the farmer replies, "We don't have a cow, only a bull." Harrelson 
gets a disgusted look on his face and says he's going to brush his 
teeth. The movie is full of disgusting moments like that, split about 
half-and-half between funny and awful.</P>
<P>        KINGPIN is an uneven movie but has a lot of positives 
going for it. The cast shows a talent for comedy, and Bill Murray 
is especially funny here for the first time since GROUNDHOG DAY. 
Angel, besides being an indisputable beauty, can act. The Farrely 
brothers, who directed KINGPIN, have a talent for cheap humor that 
is actually funny, making this an appropriate follow-up to DUMB 
AND DUMBER. If the movie hadn't been so long and loaded with 
misfired gags, it would have been a good movie to seek out. Right 
now it's worth watching but not worth arranging your schedule 
around.</P>
