                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1995 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Yves Angelo
Starring Gerard Depardieu, Fanny Ardant, Fabrice Luchini,
         Andre Dussollier
>From the novel by Honore de Balzac</PRE>
<P>     While the free-wheeling spirit of the French New Wave may be all
but gone, except for a few festival circuit oddities, the tide of
high-brow revisionist costume dramas keeps getting stronger.  Following
close on the heels of QUEEN MARGOT, a  Dumas novel adaptation, comes
COLONEL CHARBET.  This latest film is adapted with remarkable subtlety
from a novel by Honore de Balzac.  Balzac is one of those authors that
one always means to read sometime, but never quite gets the book all
the way from the shelf to the cashier's counter.  This impressive film
might change that.  It is one of those films that makes you want to
read the book to find out more of the elusive details of the strange
story.</P>
<P>     COLONEL CHARBET is somewhat of a similar story to THE RETURN OF
MARTIN GUERRE.  A soldier, after a long time, returns home to find his
wife remarried, and his money, well, tied up.  The setting for the
story this time is the Empire period,  1817 to be exact.  The Colonel
is played by MARTIN GUERRE'S Depardieu.  Early in the film, Gerard
Depardieu has a long monologue.  He explains his situation to a busy
lawyer.  Eventually they trade stories on the depths to which they have
seen humanity sink.  The story calls for flashbacks but few are given,
brief glinpses of a long ago battle.  Depardieu manages to hold our
interest merely by talking in a static shot.  His low-key, seemingly
effortless approach to the complex character of Colonel Charbet is one
of the things that sells the film.</P>
<P>     With all the expensive trappings and elaborate Empire era
costumes the film runs the risk of becoming a bloated Masterpiece
Theatre episode.  The screenplay downplays the pageantry and even the
battle scenes.  Universal themes of ambition, greed, happiness and
justice come the forefront.  Without being cardboard cutouts, various
characters come to stand for certain ideals; the lawyer being
interested in justice most obviously.  It is small moments, little
gestures and expressions that make them real.  The way the lawyer reads
his mail while listening, Countess Ferraud's (Fanny Ardant) ploy with
her necklace, Colonel Charbet's expression when he looks at his wife's
fraudulent tax statements, all of these things make the dusty literary
characters into real people.  Injecting otherwise dusty storylines with
a note of realism is one of the Balzac is noted for.  Director Yves
Angelo, along with additional screenwriters, managed to capture that
sense of realism.  Too often the subtle elements of a costume drama are
lost in the translation.</P>
<P>     In terms of visual style, realism abounds as well.  The candle-lit
night scenes are dim and yellowed.  The streets seem to be always
recovering from a recent mudstorm.  The handsome, and for women often
bizarre, costumes don't look like permanent press polyester.  The
household servants look like the underfed and poorly educated people
that they probably would have been.  The hard edged Colonel Charbet,
(Depardieu), looks awkward and uncomfortable the few times that he has
to wear his dandyish suit.  His lawyer on the other hand looks as if he
was born to inhabit such flamboyant attire.  The Countess, (Ardant) has
an elaborate array of  Empire era hair accessories and doo-dads in her
room, she at least seems to know where they all go and what they are
used for.</P>
<P>     Ardant has a difficult role in the Countess.  She is both a victim
of circumstance and a victimizer.  Her role could easily fall into
another spider-woman portrayal of the greedy and cold blooded woman so
often found in period literature.  Ardant manages to keep the Countess
a sympathetic figure, even as she tries to use her children as pawns
and tries to deceive her husband, Count Ferraud (Andre Dussollier).</P>
<P>     There is a lot of history  in the film, but it is a fairly
painless lesson in post-Napoleonic events.  COLONEL CHARBET is an
easily enjoyable and easily understandable film.  The writing, acting,
directing and production design is all first rate for a period costume
drama.</P>
