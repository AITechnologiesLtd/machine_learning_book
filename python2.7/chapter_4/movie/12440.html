<PRE>**L.A. Confidential**
Reviewed by Jeff Walters</PRE>
<P>        One of the best movies I've ever seen. I'd heard extremely
good things about this movie, and though the previews didn't really
intrigue that much, it was a movie I'd been anticipating for a few
months now. For some reason I'm not sure of - this movie was not that
big a sucess over in the U.S. It was a definite hit with the critics,
but didn't exactly set any box office records. After viewing this
incredibly well directed, written and acted movie, I can't help but
wonder - why?</P>
<P>     The strength of this film is it's gritty realism. The main
characters are all human with individual flaws, no stereo-type
hollywood heroes. You may not agree with many of their actions in the
movie or their approach to life, but that is what makes it
so real. I had expected this movie to be more of a drama than a
thriller, but I was mistaken. Even the interrogation scenes moved
at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase. And
the ending......whoa.</P>
<P>             I've never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it
acts brilliantly. The three male leads - Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey and
Russell Crowe are all just  terrific. The 'Best Actor' Oscar talk
surrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue, but
there is one problem there. How could they have chosen between these
three actors? There is no way I could look at this film and say one of
them was better than the other two. It's impossible.</P>
<P>               Kim Bassinger's performance is also a revelation. I'd
never been a big fan of hers before and always thought she was,
well...what's the word - a twinky? That impression has changed, as she
complemented Crowe and Pearce perfectly. </P>
<P>     The depth to the story and characters is truly astounding. No
cardboard characters here. The plot is full of twists and turns
and some very clever sequences. Pearce's interogation of three
seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant.</P>
<P>     I really can't fault this movie at all. I was so glad to see
fellow Australian's Pearce and Crowe star in such a breathtaking
movie. I had been very familiar with Russell Crowe beforehand from his
many Australian films, but had not seen much of Guy
Pearce. I intend to change this next time I visit the video store :) </P>
<PRE>     Overall, all I can say is "See it. See it NOW!".</PRE>
<PRE>5 stars out of 5 </PRE>
