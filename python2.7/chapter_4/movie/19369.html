<PRE>_The_Wood_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>So-called "urban" films almost always tend to be consigned to a box
office ghetto of their own, rarely connecting beyond its target
African-American audiences, even if the film has cross-demographic
appeal.  Even with the promotional muscle of MTV Productions behind it,
_The_Wood_ is not likely to be an exception to the rule, but this warm
and funny, if somewhat uneven, film deserves to be.</P>
<P>The film's title refers to Inglewood, California, and if anyone outside
of the Southern California area knows about the city, it's for either one
of two reasons: (1) it's the home of the Great Western Forum, longtime
arena to the Los Angeles Lakers (at least until this coming fall); or (2)
it's known for its gang activity.  The latter would be the obvious angle
to pursue, but aside from the gang connections of one secondary
character, writer-director Rick Famuyiwa admirably skirts the issue. 
Famuyiwa grew up in Inglewood, and his take on the city is an
affectionate portrait that could be of any given community; it has many
different qualities (including, as it is, gangs) that contribute to its
unique flavor.</P>
<P>Similarly universal, if more than a little formulaic, is its story,
which tracks a group of three friends over a span of 13 years.  The main
character is Mike (played as a teen by Sean Nelson, as an adult by Omar
Epps), who moves to The Wood from North Carolina in 1986.  In junior high
he immediately clicks with Wood natives Roland (played as a teen by Trent
Cameron, as an adult by Taye Diggs) and Slim (played as a teen by Duane
Finley, as an adult by Richard T. Jones), and together they come of age
through high school.  As is with the case of all young men of the teen
age, sex dominates the brain, and in a sense _The_Wood_ can be seen as a
(slightly) less crass cousin to _American_Pie_; there are no outrageous
gross-out gags, but the trio's attempts to initiate themselves are
humorous in how they are so firmly grounded in honest reality.</P>
<P>As can be gleaned from the actor credits, there is also a parallel story
that follows the trio as adults, and, unfortunately, it is not as
interesting as the teenage story.  In 1999, it's Roland's wedding day,
and hours before the ceremony, he's nowhere to be found; Mike and Slim
eventually do locate him, but he's plagued with doubt.  The flashbacks
are meant to punctuate the contemporary action, but the '99 scenes feel
like needless interruptions in the story that runs through '86 and '89. 
This is no fault of the likable and charismatic actors, even if Epps is
called on to address the camera directly for the film's first 15 minutes.</P>
<P>While I found that device to be distracting, it is in line with the
theme of the film, which is this idea of community and belonging, which,
of course, can be broken down to friendship.  Over the course of
_The_Wood_, one really grows to know and like these people as well as get
a keen feeling of their place and time; by the film's final toast, one
feels as if they are indeed part of The Wood.</P>
