<PRE>TWILIGHT
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Robert Benton has assembled a stellar, mature cast for his latest
feature, Twilight, a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of
Hollywood.</P>
<P>Paul Newman stars as retired detective Harry Ross.  Harry has spent the
last couple of years doing odd jobs for Jack and Catherine Ames (Gene
Hackman and Susan Sarandon), a pair of married actors who have fallen
from the limelight.</P>
<P>When Jack sends him on a routine delivery job, however, the old
instincts kick in.  Soon, Harry is wading through a mystery where
friendships and lives are on the line, and he no longer knows who to
trust.</P>
<P>There are plenty of familiar faces throughout Twilight, in addition to
Newman, Hackman and Sarandon.  James Garner plays Raymond Hope, a former
cop and one of Harry's best friends.  Stockard Channing plays Verna,
Harry's former partner, and possibly a former love interest.  Reese
Witherspoon is Mel, the distrustful daughter of the Ames', and Liev
Schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend.  Giancarlo Esposito appears as
Harry's bumbling detective protigi, and John Spencer is a suspicious
police captain.</P>
<P>With a cast like that, it's almost worth watching Twilight just to
stargaze. Luckily, there's more to the film than some sort of actor's
recognition ceremony. Twilight has a solid film noir-ish plot.  It may
not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics, but it has
much more than a lot of what passes for film these days.</P>
<P>The major cast members all deliver strong performances, as can be
expected of their caliber.  However, none of them have that little extra
oomph which would make them memorable.  The supporting cast is
enjoyable, if a little underdrawn.  Stockard Channing's character, in
particular, is a cipher.  There's more to her character than the film
takes the time to describe. It's a minor, but irritating, flaw.</P>
<P>With a solid cast, and a good plot, there's a lot to recommend about
Twilight. It's biggest flaw is actually its short running time.  At a
slim 94 minutes, there's a lot of stuff that's packed into an awfully
small package.  Still, the chance to see Newman, Sarandon and Hackman
working together is worth a cramp or two.</P>
