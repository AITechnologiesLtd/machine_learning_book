<P>They should have called it "Babe: Pig in Gotham City." This dark sequel 
to the 1995 hit has virtually none of the bucolic charm displayed in the 
original. Instead, we get a grim parade of unpleasant characters, ugly 
imagery, overlong chases and numerous scenes of animals in distress. 
While imaginative and technically impressive, "Babe: Pig in the City" is 
one of the most depressing family films I have ever seen. What in the 
world were the filmmakers thinking? </P>
<P>The original "Babe" won the hearts of audiences around the world with its 
simple tale of a little talking pig with a big heart. The delightful 
Australian film introduced Babe, a porcine youngster adopted by dogs 
after the death of its mother. The story followed Babe's adventures on 
the farm; getting to know Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) and his wife 
(Magda Szubanski), interacting with the other animals, and achieving 
success as the world's first shepherding pig. </P>
<P>"Babe: Pig in the City" takes a wrong turn in its opening moments, with a 
slapstick well accident that is too realistically filmed to be funny. The 
accident sidelines Farmer Hoggett for most of the film, shifting the 
human focus from the kindly, soft-spoken man to his fussy, easily 
flustered wife. Bad move. </P>
<P>With the farm in financial trouble, Mrs. Hoggett accepts a lucrative 
offer for Babe to appear in a shepherding demonstration and the pair 
takes off for the big city, with Babe's pal, a neurotic duck, frantically 
attempting to keep up with the airplane so he can watch over his friend. 
Hoggett and Babe miss a vital plane connection when a drug-sniffing dog's 
barking, an attempt to show-off for Babe, results in Mrs. Hoggett being 
hauled off by authorities for a full-body search.</P>
<P>Stranded in the city, Hoggett and Babe end up at a picturesque flea-bag 
hotel, where the pig meets a number of hardened city animals, including a 
surly group of performing monkeys, owned by a gross, ill-tempered clown 
(Mickey Rooney). When Mrs. Hoggett gets arrested in yet another mix-up 
and the clown dies (are we having fun yet?), the animals are left to fend 
for themselves. After a nasty encounter with some attack dogs, Babe saves 
a pitbull from drowning and forges an alliance between the animals. </P>
<P>Almost as quickly as everyone makes friends, animal control agents storm 
the hotel, capturing most of the terrified creatures and hauling them 
away. Will Babe survive? Will Mrs. Hoggett be able to rescue the critters?
 Will your children be able to get through all of this without crying?  </P>
<P>Thankfully, there are at least a few sunny, clever images in "Pig in the 
City" to lighten the harsh proceedings a bit. An aerial shot of a duck 
hitching a ride in the roomy mouth of a seagull is witty. An elaborate 
set piece involving two characters springing around a large room on 
elastic bands is fun (it also serves as a lively homage to another film 
from director George Miller -- "Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"). Distant 
shots of the town, an amalgam featuring landmarks from many different 
cities, cast a nice storybook feel and, of course, there's the inherent 
charm of watching cute little animals talk. </P>
<P>There are far more talking animal scenes here than in the first film and, 
for the most part, they are even more convincing. Christine Cavanaugh, 
the voice of Babe in the original, wanted more money than the producers 
were willing to pay, so E.G. Daily of "Rugrats" fame takes over the vocal 
chores and does good work, making Babe sound just as adorable this time 
around. If only the rest of the film was as sweet.</P>
<P>Instead, in addition to the aforementioned disturbing images, audiences 
are treated to the spectacle of a dog dangling from a bridge with its 
head under water, flailing desperately to avoid drowning. Another scene 
shows a disabled pup on a small cart, dragged at high speeds behind a 
truck, then released to flip over and over on the sidewalk. It's a 
shocking image likely to traumatize children, even though the dog is 
shown alive a few moments later. </P>
<P>A press junket and premiere for "Babe: Pig in the City" were canceled at 
the last minute, supposedly to allow more time to complete special effect 
shots for the film. Insiders report that, in fact, a test screening drew 
extremely negative reactions from the audience and the film underwent an 
emergency edit to make it more family friendly. It's scary to realize 
that the film I saw is the toned-down version.  </P>
<P>The big question, of course, is why? Why did the filmmakers all but 
remove James Cromwell from the movie? Why did they surround an enchanting 
little pig with foul-tempered characters and repulsive imagery? Why did 
they take one of the most creatively substantial fairy tales in years and 
crank out a garish sequel with violence and chases substituting for wit? 
"Babe" was one of the nicest surprises of the '90s. "Babe: Pig in the 
City" is also a surprise; a disappointing, depressing one.</P>
