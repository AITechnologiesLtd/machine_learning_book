<PRE>SCREAM 2
A review by David Wilcock (C)1998 David Wilcock</PRE>
<P>(MIRAMAX)
RUNNING TIME: 122 MINUTES (2 HOURS 2 MINUTES)
STARRING DAVID ARQUETTE, NEVE CAMPBELL, COURTENEY COX AND JAMIE KENNEDY
DIRECTED BY WES CRAVEN</P>
<P>After Scream (1996) managed to pull in an over $100 million gross, it would
seem obvious that a sequel would eventually arrive. And it's arrived quickly
aswell. Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Wiliamson saw they were on a good
thing, as just as Scream (1996) is enjoying success on video, the sequel,
the imaginatively titled Scream 2 comes slashing onto our screens. And while
Scream 2 has got a bigger body count, and a fair amount of jump scenes, this
film is never as enjoyable as you would expect it to be.
The film opens with two college kids at the opening night of the new horror
flick that has just opened, 'Stab', based on a book written by Gale Weathers
(Cox) about the happenings in the original Scream. A nice twist is that all
the audience members are wearing the 'Scream' mask which was the killers
trademark in Scream, so when the two college kids are viciously killed in
the cinema, the amount of culprits is overwhelming. The news of the killing
reaches Sidney Prescott (Campbell), one of the survivors from the prequel,
and when Casey 'Cici' Cooper it killed by a guy in a 'Scream' mask, it looks
as though the killings are starting all over again. Prescott, along with
Weathers, Randy Meeks (Kennedy), and Dewey Riley (Arquette) join together to
find out who's performing the killings.
For a spoof, Scream 2 takes itself awfully seriously. The death scenes
aren't funny, if anything that actually quite nasty. Scream 2 seems to poke
fun at all the clichés in horror movies, then pulls off a whole load of
clichés itself. Most of the time, it's pretty obvious what's going to happen
next. Also, because the killer is a normal person, not some supernatural
monster (like Freddy Kruegar) there's only a limit to what the killer can
do, so most of the deaths are pretty boring (and as said above, strangely
nasty.) The characters are also meant to be horror movie fans, and know the
tricks of the horror movie trade, but some of the things they do are
surprisingly stupid. For example, Campbell is stuck in a car with the
unconscious killer. Instead of shooting him with a gun that's close to her,
and then unmasking the killer, she goes out a window, and runs to a deserted
theater, leaving the killer free to escape (when she/he wakes up) and chase
her.
Although the story may be flawed, the performances are fun, and the dialogue
is funny. There's in-jokes about the movies, and there's also a funny scene
where Randy and Dewey are discussing the culprits (although you've probably
already seen this clip in the trailers.) While the scare scenes rely more on
the killer popping out from nowhere and loud music suddenly playing, there's
some suspenseful scenes, such as when Gale is being chased around a sound
studio, and the first five minutes. But you don't feel scared throughout,
and most of the time it's obvious when the killer is going to show itself,
the film is so clinched.
Wes Craven directs well enough, he handles the jump scenes well, and he
isn't too bad with the 'serious' bits either. Kevin Wiliamson script,
although predictable, is fun, and the film zips along like some demonic
roller coaster. Two hours is a bit long for a horror movie though, and the
ending is weak, and stretched out far too long (and, again, is entirely
predictable.) The soundtrack is good, although if you've seen Broken Arrow
(1996), the music will sound very familiar (the film uses the Broken Arrow
soundtrack.)
In Scream 2, there's a scene where a film class is discussing whether
sequels are better than the originals. Randy points out that the prequel is
always better. In the case of Scream and Scream 2, his argument is correct.
OVERALL RATING= *** OUT OF  *****
