<P>     Give this to Robert DeNiro--he's been paying attention.  After
working with some of the finest directors of his time, DeNiro proves
he's learned what goes into directing a good film with his first
helming effort, A BRONX TALE.  While his style frequently bears more
than a passing resemblance to frequent collaborator Martin Scorsese,
he's adept enough to get away with it, and adds enough of his own
vision to make him credible.  Hang all of this on a strong story about
a young man learning about life from two mentors and you have a solid,
entertaining two hours at the movies.</P>
<P>     A BRONX TALE is set during two years in the Bronx.  In 1960,
impressionable 9-year-old Calogero (Francis Capra) is fascinated by
Sonny (Chazz Palminteri), the neighborhood crime boss.  His father
Lorenzo (Robert DeNiro), a bus driver, tries to steer Calogero away
from Sonny's hangouts, but with little success.  Eight years later, a
now 17-year-old Calogero (Lillo Brancato) is still associating with
Sonny, as well as a group of young toughs nurturing a hatred for the
blacks beginning to appear in their neighborhood.  He continues to
weigh the advice coming from Lorenzo and Sonny, including advice
concerning his attraction to Jane (Taral Hicks), a young black girl,
and concerning the best path towards success.</P>
<P>     A BRONX TALE has been adapted from a one-man play by Palminteri,
and it has made an exceptional transition to the screen.  It doesn't
feel stagy like last year's adaptation of A FEW GOOD MEN, and has an
easy flow, even between the 1960 and 1968 segments.  Palminteri's
script is full of colorful characters and evocative period atmosphere,
and the first half in particular is also quite funny.  However, I was
far less engaged when the tone took a turn towards the overly serious
and focused on racial tensions.  The romance between Calogero and Jane
felt forced, and ultimately I didn't think the climactic racial
confrontation worked.  The film had established such a unique and
interesting central triangle of Calogero, Sonny and Lorenzo that I was
disappointed when that conflict took a back seat.</P>
<P>     The appeal of that conflict is part character, part performance.
The two father figures are complicated characters portrayed by two fine
actors.  DeNiro has the less showy role of Lorenzo, a hard-working man
trying to teach his son respect for that hard work.  Yet he is not a
faultless blue-collar angel.  At times, DeNiro plays Lorenzo as just as
concerned with his son's opinion of him as he is about Calogero's
well-being.  He also discourages his son's interracial romance, saying
people should "stick to their own."  Palminteri handles Sonny just as
deftly.  While a brutal figure capable of laying out a group of Hell's
Angels, he also lectures Calogero on the importance of staying in
school and staying away from his trouble-making buddies.  Calogero's
moral uncertainty is real because the good guy and bad guy in A BRONX
TALE frequently exchange hats.  Francis Capra is very good as the
mischievous young Calogero, but I was less impressed by Lillo
Brancato.  He's a bit too blank, and adopts too many DeNiro mannerisms
(Brancato won the part by doing an impression of DeNiro).  Jane is
written basically as a "type," and Taral Hicks looks painfully
uncomfortable a great deal of the time.  The combination of these two
weaker performances only added to my antipathy toward the romantic
subplot.</P>
<P>     Robert DeNiro's direction, as I've noted, owes much to Martin
Scorsese; indeed, an early scene introducing the nicknamed regulars at
Sonny's bar is lifted straight out of GOODFELLAS.  DeNiro also displays
Scorsese's gift for pacing and crisp images.  But this is more than a
knock-off job.  DeNiro's tone is lighter, more affirming and
optimistic.  In that respect, A BRONX TALE perhaps bears more
resemblance to the current KING OF THE HILL than it does to
GOODFELLAS.  It's a flawed film, but does considerably more right than
it does wrong.  A BRONX TALE is a coming-of-age fable in which Robert
DeNiro shows he has come of age as a filmmaker.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 father figures:  7.</PRE>
