<PRE>U-TURN
Directed by Oliver Stone</PRE>
<P>It's a telling sign that "U-Turn" is identified in the opening credits
as "An Oliver Stone Movie" rather than "An Oliver Stone Film." This is
Stone in an apolitcal, even -- dare we say it -- lighthearted
mood. But this time out his bag of tricks is filled with recycled
items: grainy film stock, black-and-white inserts, scorpions, scolding
crows, Indian soothsayers and a non-stop parade of white
trashies. "U-Turn" has some of the style of "Natural Born Killers"
with almost none of its satiric sting or kinetic energy, and the
result is a clunky black comedy with only a few scattered laughs
breaking up a monotonous cruise.</P>
<P>Although the story claims to be based on John Ridley's "Stray Dogs,"
it actually owes more to such modern film-noirs as "Red Rock West" and
"Body Heat." A breakdown strands luckless gambler Sean Penn in a
desert town where everyone seems to be either hot-blooded or
hot-tempered.  Sultry local slut Jennifer Lopez (awkwardly making her
way through a role originally intended for Sharon Stone) would fall in
the first category; her real-estate magnate hubby Nick Nolte belongs
in the latter. Penn gets the opportunity to murder both of them, in
between would-be wacky misadventures straight out of the far superior
Martin Scorsese opus "After Hours."</P>
<P>The only real amusement is provided by the vibrant Claire Danes,
playing a bubble-brained tease who desperately tries to seduce Penn
into helping her escape the town, and Joaquin Phoenix, as her even
dumber boyfriend, who calls himself "T.N.T." Penn can be extremely
funny given the right material, but "U-Turn" affords him few
opportunities to do anything except look put-upon. Nolte growls and
grimaces unmenacingly, and his tawdry sex scene with Lopez should have
been cut: It's an embarassment to both actors. Cameos by everyone from
Laurie Metcalf to Liv Tyler abound, creating only momentary interest.
When "U-Turn" finally comes to its long-delayed ending, you realize
"Donut" would have been a far more suitable title, as your unexciting
two-hour journey has only taken you around in a circle; like its hero,
this show never gets on the road.  James Sanford</P>
