<P>   As the millennium approaches, the assassination of
President Kennedy will undoubtedly make the news
magazines as one of the seminal events of the century. 
Remember the big question whose answer everyone over 40
seems to know, "Where were you on the day that JFK was
killed?"  In the Canadian movie "Last Night," which was a
surprise hit at the 1998 Toronto International Film Festival
and won the prestigious Prix de la jeunesse at
Cannes, Don McKellar has a more interesting query.  "Where
were you on the night the world came to an end?"  We seem
to have some time left before that milestone in the Earth's
sorry history, so let's rephrase: "What do you think you'll be
doing during the final hours of humankind's existence?" 
Completing a round-the-world excursion?  Smoking your final
joint at a week-long party with friends?  Huddled and
trembling in the corner like a hapless schizophrenic?  Mc
Kellar--a talented young man who wrote the offbeat "Thirty-
two Short Films About Glenn Gould" and the epic, if bloated,
"The Red Violin"--suggests otherwise, using a diverse group
of Toronto residents to stand in for the world at large.  </P>
<P>   McKellar's would appear a natural subject for a movie
about the ultimate fin de siecle, and yet when you think back
to how the Americans treated the theme-- in "Armageddon,"
"Deep Impact," and the like--you get what Hollywood knows
its market wants: explosions, heavy violence, and the use of
all the special effects that money can buy to ignite and
convulse the screen.  Though "Last Night" is not without
chaos, the disorder is carried out only by the crazy
teen-agers in the cast who do little more than shoot a guy off
screen, roll over a couple of vehicles, and cheer amid confetti
in Toronto's principal square as the clock ticks the time to
termination.  McKellar focuses inward to afford us a film
whose positive features are its originality, sensitivity, and
unpredictability, but whose noble aims are all but overrun by
largely mediocre improvisation-style acting and the image of
an off-Broadway play adapted to the screen by a guy with a
limited budget.</P>
<P>   Though they say that in your final moments, your entire life
passes before your eyes, the gang of Canadians--some
earnest, some quirky--go about their lives as though
nothing more depressing than another New Year's Eve were
taking place.  Chief among the surprises is the activity of
Duncan the gas man (David Cronenberg of all people),
whose startles the audience by being so utterly matter-of-fact. 
Duncan spends Earth's final six hours sitting at the phone in
the office of his company calling people in the region to
assure them that the company expects to supply its product
until the very end.  The sole comic moments in this otherwise
astonishingly ordinary, mundane group are supplied by Craig
Zwiller (Callum Keith Rennie), a fun-loving puckish fellow who
is the only one in the picture doing what you might expect a
fun-loving fellow to do: his aim is to have every kind of sex
imaginable during the world's final two months, and he has
strewn a check list across every inch of wallspace in his
kitchen outlining the specifics.  To no one's surprise he finds
virtually all the willing partners he needs--people of all races
and proclivities, not exluding a fifty-ish virgin (Tracy Wright)
and his former French teacher, Mrs. Carlton (Genevieve
Bujold).  </P>
<P>   McKellar is a sort of Canadian Woody Allen: not only
directing, writing and acting in his own picture but emulating
the American comic with his hangdog face and all-around
nerdish demeanor.  Though his character, Patrick, shares
with Greta Garbo a need to be alone on this of all nights,
away from his decent, prayerful family (Roberta Maxwell and
Robin Gammel as Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler), he is jolted back to
life by an amazing encounter with an intelligent but desperate
woman of Asian background, Sandra (Sandra Oh). Sandra is
eager to get home to the husband she loves but, realizing
that this is not going to happen, spends her final hours
discussing life and death with the newly invigorated young
man.</P>
<P>   While granting that "Last Night" is a welcome change from
the types of disaster movies realized in razzle-dazzle
manners by Hollywood (here we have no idea how and why
the earth is ending nor should we care), this off-beat
Canadian entry with a dollop of black humor, a generous
serving of philosophy, and an entirely sober concept of what
we'll be doing just before the second Big Bang, is done in by
its staginess.  McKellar might well consider taking his script
to prestigious off-Broadway theaters in New York such
as the Promenade and the CSC Repertory.  "Last Night" is
the work of a good playwright, not a screenwriter.</P>
