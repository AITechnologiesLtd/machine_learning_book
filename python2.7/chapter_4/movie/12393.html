<PRE>DEEP IMPACT (1998)
A "Turkey of the Week" film review by Justin Felix.  
Copyright 1998 Justin Felix.  </PRE>
<PRE>Rating: *** (out of five)  </PRE>
<P>Written by Michael Tolkin and Bruce Joel Rubin.  
Directed by Mimi Leder.  
Starring Robert Duvall, Tea Leoni, Elijah Wood, Vanessa Redgrave,
Maximilian Schell, Morgan Freeman.  
Rated PG-13 (contains violence and profanity)  approx. 110 mins.  </P>
<P>Synopsis:  An annoying, alcoholic reporter for MSNBC stumbles upon the
biggest story of the century: a giant comet is on a collision-course for
Earth.  A crew of astronauts attempt to blow up the comet with nuclear
devices but only manage to split the comet in two.  A salvo of nuclear
weapons, a massive underground shelter, and the astronauts' desperate
second plan become man's only hope for survival.  </P>
<P>Comments:  Judging from DEEP IMPACT's previews, I expected the worse.  With
syrupy phrases bandied about like "oceans rise," "cities fall," and "hope
survives," along with a melodramatic score in the background and a rather
cheesy image of a tidal wave knocking buildings over in New York City, the
movie did not seem promising.  Add to this the fact that another
high-profile summer flick, ARMAGEDDON, deals with basically the same topic
-- Hollywood has a hard time coming up with respectable disaster movies in
pairs (as the recent volcano and earthquake debacles illustrate).  I was,
however, somewhat surprised by DEEP IMPACT's strengths.  Instead of a
turkey, it's a better-than-average TV mini-series with a bloated 75 million
dollar budget and a shorter running time.  </P>
<P>Those 75 million bucks seemed well-spent, surprisingly.  The special
effects in DEEP IMPACT are very noteworthy (quite a feat considering the
countless movies Hollywood releases now which are predominantly
effects-driven).  Nothing shown in this movie, to further the surprise, is
particularly new or innovative.  People flee in vain through a crowded New
York City street, for example, with a giant tidal wave smashing buildings
and consuming cars behind them, a scene almost stolen from INDEPENDENCE DAY
(same city, similar street -- only, in ID4, it was fire rather than water).
 Similar destruction, both in cities and in the countryside, have been seen
in many other recent natural disaster flicks.  VOLCANO, DAYLIGHT, and
DANTE'S PEAK come to mind.  This doesn't, however, lessen the impact that
such images of destruction has on the audience (no pun intended).  Though
highly unrealistic, the outer space sequences are also visually stunning,
perhaps the best in the film.  </P>
<P>Whatever was left over in the budget after the special effects was still
well-spent.  DEEP IMPACT sports a very solid, respectable cast.  Robert
Duvall and Morgan Freeman give the most notable performances.  Duvall,
fresh off of his Academy Award-nominated work on THE APOSTLE, pulls at the
heartstrings as an aging astronaut named Spurgeon Tanner.  Tanner, an
experienced navigator and recent widower, overcomes the age discrimination
of his much younger crew to become a leader and a hero convincingly.
Morgan Freeman's always powerful presence lends credence to his job playing
the President of the U.S.  Screen vets Maximilian Schell and Vanessa
Redgrave play the divorced parents of the reporter who breaks the story
very well.  The reporter, Jenny Lerner, played by Tea Leoni, is the only
casting misfire here.  Leoni is wooden and unconvincing throughout; she
lacks charm, and many of her scenes are hollow and unsatisfying.  As one of
the major characters in the movie, this is a striking fault.  </P>
<P>Another fault, admirable as it may be, is that DEEP IMPACT attempts too
much.  I made a comparison earlier between this film and a TV mini-series.
DEEP IMPACT needs four or six hours to satisfactorily tell its tale.  The
story takes place over the course of a couple of years and involves a great
many characters.  We see the President and the government, the news media,
the astronauts of the space shuttle "Messiah," and numerous everyday,
middle-class, mostly white Americans.  Many of these characters are complex
and fascinating, yet not enough time is spent on them.  In order to be more
in-depth in a 2 hour movie, perhaps the screenwriters could have
concentrated upon one group of characters.  My vote would have gone to the
"Messiah."  The astronauts are uniformly interesting; all have families on
Earth (so we still would have a tie to the Earth); and, their sacrifices
are some of the most memorable in the movie.  We don't see them in
training; they're just introduced suddenly, given a party, and launched
into space.  </P>
<P>Focusing upon the astronauts would have also saved the audience from
sentimentally absurd scenes involving the middle-class, suburban, American
characters.  As primarily a disaster film (one could legitimately argue
this is science fiction as well), DEEP IMPACT follows some of the cliches
which appear in other movies of this genre.  We have pregnant women,
parents who sacrifice themselves for their children, and despicable
characters who turn over new leaves in order to become heroes.  Thankfully,
a dog doesn't play a prominent role here (dogs-in-jeopardy, a tired element
seen in disaster epics like DAYLIGHT, etc.).  Young love, however, does
appear: the child who unknowingly discovers the comet falls in love, gets
married to save his sweetheart (he's picked to go into the underground
shelter; she is not), follows her as she decides to spend the apocalypse
with her parents, and then finds her, somehow, just in time to witness the
movie's climactic ending.  Please.  This was the most unlikely subplot of
the film, and I, for one, did not buy it.  Though, as my friend and I
vacated the theater, I overheard two teenage girls talk about how they
hadn't cried so much at a film in a long time.  I guess it worked for some
people.  </P>
<P>Removing the plot from the critical equation (let's face it, most
special-effects driven films ask you to swallow a lot that's unbelievable),
DEEP IMPACT is an entertaining, diverting, early film for the Summer of
1998.  This is a film to check out on the big screen.  Rated PG-13, this
film makes a pretty good matinee movie with little that would offend the
audience.  The rather convoluted storyline, though, may tax some children's
understanding and patience.  </P>
