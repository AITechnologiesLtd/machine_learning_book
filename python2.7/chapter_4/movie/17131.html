<PRE>Cruel Intentions
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>[No Stars] (Out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>I have a confession.</PRE>
<P>At times, especially the eerily quiet early morning hours, when
working on a project at home, I'll have the television on next to my
computer. Usually I'll slip in a "Northern Exposure" or "Seinfeld"
tape that I've seen a dozen times before. Since I know the shows by
heart, they provide audio companions that don't require much
consideration. It's like having friends over that I don't have to pay
any attention to.</P>
<P>Occasionally I'll channel-surf searching for an innocuous nature
documentary or old sit-com for background chatter. Sometimes around
4:00 am, I'll run into horrendous soap operas that are, for some odd
reason, broadcast while most people sleep. I assume these exist
because the network hopes insomniacs will watch <I>anything<I> in the
wee hours, even faux drama with little plot and less acting talent.</P>
<P>"Cruel Intentions", despite its thematic similarity to these, could
never aspire to be even that good.</P>
<P>Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Phillippe) and his step-sister Kathryn (Sarah
Michelle Gellar) are spoiled rich kids who get their kicks by
manipulating other spoiled rich kids. Sebastian's hobby is bedding
down his female classmates by any means available. Kathryn is out for
revenge on innocent Cecile (Selma Blair) who inadvertently stole her
boyfriend.</P>
<P>Somewhere in the middle of this, the siblings bet on Sebastian's
ability to successfully deflower Annette (Reese Witherspoon), a sweet
young thing who has written a pro-virginity manifesto for a national
teen magazine. If Kathryn wins, she gets his vintage Jaguar. If he
wins, she'll give him the ride he really wants.</P>
<P>Kathryn begins her Machiavellian scheme by pretending to be childlike
Cecile's best friend and turning her into a "bad girl." Advising
Cecile to "sleep with as many people as possible," she sets her up for
Sebastian's alcohol-assisted seduction. Meanwhile he is beginning to
have real feelings for Annette. At least he's supposed to be having
those feelings. You'd never know it from watching the actor.</P>
<P>The plot has some solid ground, based, as it is, on the eighteenth
century "Les Liaisons Dangereuses". The loose re-make of "Dangerous
Liaisons" with younger actors quickly turns that ground into quicksand
as it gets mired down in its own inanity.</P>
<P>There's not an actor in the batch that creates a believable
character. Both Witherspoon and Blair come across as Rebecca of
Sunnybrook Farm but without the depth. Gellar desperately wants to
play a vamp but doesn't have the acting chops to pull it
off. Phillippe struts around looking like a Greek god and prettier
than any of the girls, but doesn't demonstrate any emotions beyond
boredom.</P>
<P>The movie is designed to draw in the young teenage market who are able
to talk their way into an R-rated film. It's filled with gratuitous
sexual supposed-taboos. There's an inter-racial romance, a gay
encounter, almost-incestuous gropings and dirty talk. When Kathryn
teaches Cecile about making out, we're treated to an extended close-up
of the girls French-kissing.</P>
<P>Every action is presented in the most exploitive manner possible. The
film is homophobic, sexist, racist, classist and just about every
other word that ends with "ist."</P>
<P>What else could we expect? Give an involved French novel to director
Roger Kumble, responsible for some of the most uninspired films in
recent history ("Dumb And Dumber", "National Lampoon's Senior Trip"),
aim it towards teens and the outcome is inevitable. If this is what
Hollywood thinks America's youth finds entertaining, the industry is
in trouble…or the country is.</P>
<P>The movie is remarkable in its ability to grow more insipid with each
passing moment. It's one of the few that I can remember turning to the
person sitting next to me and asking, in astonishment, if the film
could possibly be as bad as it seemed.</P>
<P>Even the tenth viewing of the episode where George is concerned about
"shrinkage" holds more surprises. And you don't have to sit in a huge
dark room for two hours watching it.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for longer than the characters in
"Cruel Intentions" have been alive and thinks that even his reviews would make
a better movie. Email your cinematic disappointments to <A HREF="mailto:Redman@indepen.com.">Redman@indepen.com.</A>)</P>
