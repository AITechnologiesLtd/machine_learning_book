<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Neil Jordan's (In Dreams) latest is a lean adaptation of Graham Greene's
novel of the same name.  There isn't much to the story (some even say
that the book would have been better as a novella) and there aren't many
characters.  But thanks to first-rate acting talent and gorgeously dark
cinematography, The End of the Affair is still a winner.</P>
<P>The story takes place in London during and after World War II, where
Sarah Miles (Julianne Moore, An Ideal Husband) steps out on her boring,
loveless, civil-servant husband Henry (Stephen Rea, Guinevere) to have a
torrid affair with a novelist named Maurice Bendrix (Ralph Fiennes, The
Avengers).  Their trysts begin in 1939 and the two carry on unchecked
for years until one day Sarah abruptly calls off the relationship
without even giving Maurice a reason.</P>
<P>Years later, Maurice is still perplexed about the termination of their
affair.  Believing that she left him for another man, he hires a private
investigator (Ian Hart, Enemy of the State) to shadow his ex-lover.
Their relationship is shown in a series of intricate flashbacks, with
the first half of the film from Maurice's perspective and the second
from Sarah's as he reads it from a diary lifted by the PI.</P>
<P>Jordan's unique structure and Roger Pratt's (12 Monkeys) haunting camera
work complement the great performances from Fiennes, Moore and Hart.
The story of jealousy and lust is simple and predictable, yet in the
capable hands of this cast and crew, The End of the Affair is always
entertaining.</P>
<P>1:49 - R for nudity and scenes of strong sexuality</P>
