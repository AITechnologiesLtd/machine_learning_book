Reviewed by Dustin Putman, September 9, 2000.</P>
<P>For director Neil LaBute's first two pictures, 1997's "In the Company of the 
Men" and 1998's "Your Friends & Neighbors," he showed an affinity for 
ruthless, acid-minded characters who primarily are only out for the 
well-being of themselves, and no one else. His views of the human condition 
were at once startling, yet grim--bravura looks into the darker corners of 
the world. For LaBute's third effort, "Nurse Betty," he has adapted the 
highly original screenplay by John C. Richards and James Flamberg into a 
motion picture that is as sweet as could possibly be, with the title 
character being one of the most lovable heroines in many a moon. While not 
without a few shocking moments of bloodshed and murder, "Nurse Betty" is a 
profoundly earnest and charming film, not to mention LaBute's strongest, to 
date.</P>
<P>As Betty Sizemore, the lovely Renee Zellweger has found a wonderfully layered 
role that she was undoubtedly born to play. A coffeehouse waitress in Kansas 
who is stuck in a dead-end marriage with her no-good, philandering husband 
Del (Aaron Eckhart), Betty is enamored with the soap opera, "A Reason to 
Love," as well as the strikingly handsome Dr. David Ravell, played by actor 
George McCord (Greg Kinnear), and dreams of going to nursing school. She has 
always wanted to help people, you see, and it wasn't until she got married 
that she found her future grow cloudy and uncertain.</P>
<P>One night, as Betty quietly watches a recording of the day's episode of "A 
Reason to Love," she hears noises out in the living room and eavesdrops on 
Del being threatened by two men, Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris 
Rock), hired killers who subsequently scalp and shoot him to death. The 
post-traumatic shock of seeing him getting murdered in cold blood sends Betty 
into a dissociative fugue in which she believes that the characters on "A 
Reason to Love" are real people. So she sets off for the fictional Luna Vista 
Hospital in Los Angeles to find Dr. David Ravell, the man she just knows she 
was meant to be with, in a borrowed 1997 LeSabre that is, unbeknownst to 
Betty, carrying drugs in the trunk. </P>
<P>After a summer overflowing with special effects-laden disaster pics and 
tiresome big-budget retreads, you can always tell when the Fall movie season 
has arrived with the release of the first great film. "Nurse Betty" is a true 
American original, high-spirited and giddily entertaining, with a potentially 
overblown fantasy of a storyline that, through the assured filmmaking touch 
of LaBute, never strays far from the bounds of realism. The premise may 
appear to be in danger of growing preposterous at any minute, but it never 
does, and you follow the film closely and care about what happens so much 
because of one major factor: the seminally written and performed character of 
Betty.</P>
<P>Mere written praise cannot, and does not, possibly do justice to how very 
good Renee Zellweger is as Betty, but to give you an idea, she was able to 
generate such likability right away that she does something within the first 
five minutes that was so genuinely touching and heartfelt, it nearly caused 
me to tear up. With 2000's "Me, Myself & Irene" and, most prominently, here, 
Zellweger has also proven herself to be quite a funny actress, able to 
generate huge guffaw laughs simply from an expression or the delivery of a 
single line of dialogue. Sorely passed up for an Academy Award nomination for 
her impressive turn in 1996's "Jerry Maguire," Zellweger's time to shine in 
Oscar's glory may finally, and deservedly, have arrived with her brilliantly 
nuanced work in "Nurse Betty."</P>
<P>Also a standout is Morgan Freeman, who hasn't been given such an opportune 
chance to really show his talent as an actor in quite some time. As the 
worn-out romantic Charlie, who is getting ready to retire from the profession 
of being a hired killer and who forms an indirect close bond with Betty, 
Freeman puts his many years of being a performer into his role, successfully 
conveying wisdom and honesty. </P>
<P>In supporting roles, Chris Rock is surprisingly restrained as Charlie's 
apprentice, Wesley; Aaron Eckhart appears briefly and effectively as the 
loser Del; Crispin Glover and Pruitt Taylor Vince are humorous and 
sweet-natured as two of Betty's friends from Kansas who set out to find her 
themselves; and Greg Kinnear is excellent as the charming Dr. David Ravell 
and the vain, self-important George McCord.</P>
<P>"Nurse Betty" is a masterful human comedy and a sincere drama, as imaginative 
as it is unpredictable. Without giving anything away, the film does not sell 
out and go for the obvious, too-neat conclusion, but stays true to the main 
character and ends the only possible truthful way that it could. "Nurse 
Betty" is a pure heartwarmer from the first frame to the last, an uncynical 
motion picture that proves, yes, dreams surely do come true.</P>
