<P>Susan Granger's review of "INNOCENCE" (Fireworks Pictures/Cinemavault
Releasing)</P>
<P>     An adult love story is unusual - a poignant, engaging, romantically
poetic one is unique. And that describes "Innocence, " Australian
writer/director Paul Cox's tale of love rediscovered. Charles Tingwell ("The
Dish") and Julia Blake ("Travelling North") play Andreas and Claire, ill-fated
teenage lovers who were separated in post-W.W.II Belgium when his father
disapproved of their relationship. Now a retired music teacher and church
organist, a widower with a grown daughter, Andreas proposes a date for lunch in
a letter to Claire, who has endured an emotionally sterile marriage and has a
grown son. When they meet, memories come flooding back as they discover feelings
that have been dormant for 50 years. Tenderly, the elderly couple embark on a
gentle but intense affair, transcending time and place. Declaring they're too
old to lie, they don't attempt to hide. In fact, Claire recklessly tells her
puzzled husband (Terry Norris) whose incredulity soon erupts into jealousy,
followed by desperation. </P>
<P>     Adeptly avoiding schmaltz and sentimentality, Paul Cox so cleverly
interweaves the tempestuous affair with flashbacks to their carefree, youthful
ardor that it's tempting to forgive his cloying aphorisms ("Too much love is as
bad as no love at all.") and inept editing. The obviously experienced and
intelligent cast is excellent, performing even the most intimate scenes of
reawakened sexuality with understated dignity and discretion. And Cox explains
the title as having the opportunity to explore your first love again. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Innocence" is a warm, compassionate, insightful
8, proving that love and passion are ageless. As Cox puts it, "This film is a
sanctuary - hopefully it will restore a bit of humanity to the cinema."</P>
