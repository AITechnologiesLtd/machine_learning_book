<P>     MADAGASCAR SKIN, a two-character study from writer/director Chris 
Newby, is more boring than it is bad, although both terms apply.  From 
beginning to end, a frustrating sense of inertia holds everything on-
screen in a vice-like grip, making for an interminable, tedious ninety 
minutes.  Along the way, there are breakthrough moments when MADAGASCAR 
SKIN shines, but these are distressingly rare.  For most of this movie, 
I found myself fending off sleep.</P>
<P>     Although Newby would like us to believe he has come up with an 
original plot, the core of his movie -- two dissimilar, lonely men 
finding companionship with each other -- is a basic motion picture 
staple.  Sadly, perhaps the most unique thing Newby has accomplished in 
this case is to strip his two protagonists of much of their humanity.  
They are two-dimensional figures unsuccessfully struggling to escape 
from their stereotyped cocoons.</P>
<P>     As the film begins, Harry (John Hannah), a painfully shy gay man, 
is at a gay bar, drinking a beer and staying in the shadows.  When the 
lights come on, it's apparent why he prefers the darkness -- the entire 
left side of his face is covered with a port wine stain the shape of the 
island Madagascar.  Hurt by the looks of repulsion cast in his 
direction, Harry flees not only the bar, but civilization in general, 
escaping to a remote section of the Welsh coast, where he intends to 
live out of his car.  Fate has other plans, however, and, while he's 
walking the beach, Harry comes upon the unconscious Flint (Bernard 
Hill), who is buried up to the neck in the sand.  After a short period 
of indecision, Harry decides to rescue the older man.  Soon, the two of 
them are squatting in a nearby, apparently-abandoned house that, 
conveniently, has electricity and running water.</P>
<P>     There's nothing compelling about either Harry or Flint, both of 
whom are sketchily-drawn and incomplete.  One is intelligent and 
educated; the other is illiterate and obtuse.  One is gay; the other is 
heterosexual.  One is shy and withdrawn; the other is blustering and 
forthright.  One eats beans with his hands; the other swallows insects 
and chews on glass.  The only things they share are poverty and an 
almost-desperate need for human companionship.  On those occasions when 
MADAGASCAR SKIN slices through its self-imposed barriers to develop a 
moment's empathy with these characters, we are treated to a glimpse of 
the quiet power this film could have possessed.  But there are too few 
of these moments, and much time is wasted on an arm's-length view of 
individuals whose bizarre attributes make them unfathomable and 
contradictory, not special.</P>
<P>     Throughout MADAGASCAR SKIN, Newby delights in shocking us with 
graphic, grotesque images.  Ugliness is everywhere:  dead squid and fish 
squashed by car tires, a severed penis, and worms feasting on a decaying 
body.  Perhaps the most stomach-turning moment of all is when Flint 
opens his mouth and swallows a mouse whole, then chews on the rodent 
before sucking in the tail.  I'm not squeamish -- I sat through *the* 
scene in CLEAN, SHAVEN -- but this caused me to wince.</P>
<P>     Often, there's a warped, dream-like quality to the way Newby 
presents the visuals, causing us to wonder whether the entire narrative 
is Harry's nightmare.  If it's not, there's no obvious reason why 
MADAGASCAR SKIN should be presented in such a pretentious, pseudo-arty 
manner unless the director is trying to demonstrate his "talent" as a 
film maker.  This movie would have been better served if more energy had 
been invested in creating vital protagonists and telling a worthwhile 
story.</P>
<P>     Although both Harry and Flint fail as characters, neither actor 
Bernard Hill nor John Hannah (FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL) can be 
blamed.  Both give solid, albeit wasted, performances, and I'm sure that 
several of the fleeting connections the audience makes with the pair is 
due entirely to good acting.  It's a grim prospect to contemplate what 
MADAGASCAR SKIN would have been without them.  In fact, it's not all 
that pleasant to consider what it is with them.  This movie can get 
under your skin, but not in the way the film makers intended, and only 
if you stay awake.</P>
