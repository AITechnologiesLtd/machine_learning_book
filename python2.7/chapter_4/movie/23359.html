<P>Review by Scott Hunt
Movie Hunt:   <A HREF="http://netdirect.net/~hunt/index.html">http://netdirect.net/~hunt/index.html</A></P>
<PRE>Rating: Bulleye  (4 out of 4 stars)</PRE>
<P>Cast: Adam Beach, Gary Farmer, Irene Bedard, Evan Adams, Tantoo
Cardinal, Cody Lightning and Tom Skerritt
Director: Chris Eyre
Writer: Sherman Alexie</P>
<P>A lyrical, at times magical, look at the familial bond, "Smoke Signals"
is the first film written, directed,co-produced, and acted by American
Indians. Director Chris Eyre and screenwriter Sherman Alexie have
adapted Alexie's critically acclaimed collection of short stories, The
Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven, into a funny, bittersweet
road picture that avoids melodrama and the often romanticized images
presented of American Indians in modern cinema.</P>
<P>Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan Adams) and Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) are
Coeur D'Alene Indians who share a common bond. As an infant, Thomas was
thrown from the upper story window of his house as it burned, his
parents trapped inside. Moments before hitting the ground, he was saved
by Victor's alcoholic,physically abusive father, Arnold (Gary Farmer).
As the boys grew, Thomas came to view Victor as a brother and Arnold as
a surrogate father. Twenty years later, word comes to the reservation
that Arnold, who had left Victor and his mother Arlene (Tantoo Cardinal
in a subtle, knowing performance) years earlier, has died and Victor
must go retrieve his ashes. Short of funds, Victor is forced to accept
money from Thomas, despite his annoyance and apparent dislike of him,
on the condition that Thomas can go along.</P>
<P>Evan Adams is a delight as Thomas, Victor's cousin. Thomas has a
fondness for sports coats with matching vests, black framed glasses and
pigtails, along with an ever present goofy grin, something which
irritates the brooding Victor. At one point Victor tells
Thomas, "Indians ain't supposed to smile. Get stoic. If you don't look
mean, white people won't respect you." Victor holds a special
resentment for Thomas, who has leaned what it's like to be an Indian
from watching television. As Victor puts it, "The only thing worse than
Indians on TV is an Indian watching Indians on TV."</P>
<P>Victor is a walking knot of anguish, conflicted about his feelings and
memories of his father, a man he can neither hate nor love. Throughout
the film, more is revealed about Arnold in expertly done, non-intrusive
flashbacks. This is one of the movie's strengths as Thomas narrates
many of the flashbacks in an annoying, yet mesmerizing, sing-song voice.</P>
<P>The movie settles into the familiar trappings of a road picture as the
two young men gain fresh insight into themselves and Arnold. What makes
the film special is the self-deprecating dialogue, often centering on
stereotypes of American Indians. Ayres and Alexie don't preach at the
audience, but rather give them a comedic nudge as they tear down many
preconcieved notions about Indians.</P>
<P>As both Thomas and Victor struggle to interpret the smoke signals of
Arnold's death, they ultimately begin to learn the power of fathers,
sons, and forgiveness.</P>
