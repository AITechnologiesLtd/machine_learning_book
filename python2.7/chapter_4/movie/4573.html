<PRE>                               FROM DUSK TILL DAWN
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     If you have the faintest idea what this movie is all about, I'd
appreciate a call.  As best I can tell, the lowdown is this:  guns,
hostages, a Winnebago, Mexico, breasts, booze, vampires, and gore...lots
and lots of gore.</P>
<P>     "Not for all tastes" is an extreme understatement, as FROM DUSK TILL
DAWN is the most obscenely violent and distasteful film to come along in
years.  Basically an EVIL DEAD set in Mexico, this Quentin
Tarantino-Robert Rodriguez collaboration tells the sketchy story of the
Gecko brothers (Tarantino and George Clooney, taking a rest from "ER" to
cut up people in another medium), a couple of fugitives on the run to the
border.  On the way, they pick up a family as hostages:  lapsed preacher
Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel), daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis), and son
Scott (Ernest Liu).  In the Fuller's RV, they make it to a Mexican strip
bar, only to discover it's run by vampires.  (Thankfully, it makes a great
place for an old-fashioned bloodletting.)  Plot is clearly incidental to
the film.</P>
<P>     Tarantino's typical wry humor (some is funny, some is decidedly not)
pervades the film, punctuated by Rodriguez's flair for filming violence. 
The latter gets a lot more screen time, with the frequently loud
explosions effectively muting what I expect were some good one-liners. 
These two filmmakers may be best buddies (and they are), but their styles
just don't seem to match sometimes:  Tarantino's penchant for long,
drawn-out scenes doesn't fit with Rodriguez's quick cutting style.  You
can almost hear him off-screen, chanting, "Get on with it!"</P>
<P>     And I was too.  I wish Tarantino would get over the fascination of
hearing his own dialogue, although I must admit he seems to have found his
perfect role as a demented pervert with a heart of coal.  By the time the
gore-fest is in full swing, it feels like a giant-screen game of "DOOM,"
complete with flowing blood and rolling heads.</P>
<P>     The way-over-the-top campiness is so completely ridiculous, it's
impossible to take anything in the film seriously.  And trust me, that's
not a bad thing.  The problem is, it makes rating FROM DUSK TILL DAWN
nearly impossible, so here's my best shot.  For the squeamish and/or
feminists: *.  For schlock horror fans and Tarantino freaks: *****.  A
nice average:</P>
<PRE>RATING:  ***</PRE>
<PRE>\-------------------------------\     
|*     Unquestionably awful     |     
|**    Sub-par on many levels   |     
|***   Average, hits and misses |     
|****  Good, memorable film     |     
|***** Perfection               |
