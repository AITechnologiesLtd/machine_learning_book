<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Frozen is an independently produced Chinese film, made during 1994, and
it reflects the pessimism the artist community of the post-Tiananmen
Square generation felt about the materialistic Communist regime and how
the regime stifles free expression. It is a call for artistic freedom,
but interestingly enough, this political film shies away from offering
any significant political commentary. The director, Wang Xiaoshuai,
clashed with the Chinese authorities over the film, since filmmakers in
China must go through official channels. He finally took the film
secretly to Amsterdam to get it released and took the pseudonym Wu Ming,
meaning `No Name.'There is a coldness about this film that prevents it
from being a true emotional experience rather than an intellectual
response to what the students and avant-garde community in Beijing were
feeling at the time.</P>
<P>The story is told in flashback style, of a laconic, stoic, young
depressed student, Qi Lei (Jia Hongshen), who is a performance artist
and decides that at the beginning of each of the four seasons, to
perform a symbolical death ritual, which will culminate in his actual
suicide. He starts with a self-burial in the autumn, a water burial for
the winter, a burning for the spring, and for the summer, he plans to go
through with his actual death, in the form of an ice burial.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to feel anything but regret for his plan of a slow
suicide, a martyrdom for the cause, to show how repressive the Communist
system is and how tired he is of living. His plan is to use himself as a
concept for others to rally around his cause. The world has had too many
martyrs already, and his plan is such a cold and calculating one, that
three-quarters of the film is boringly spent showing him with his fickle
friends, Longhaired Guy (Wei Ye) and Bald Guy (Bai Yefu), his
understanding girlfriend, Shao Yun (Ma Xiaoqing), and his cynical
physician sister (Bai Yu), whom he sponges off; and, her husband, his
wisecracking brother-in-law (Li Geng), who wants to possess his
paintings in case he becomes famous after his death. Only Qi Leng's
mentor, the art critic Lau Ling (Zhang Yongning) -- Shao Yun's ex-lover
-- seems to approve of what Qi is doing.</P>
<P>The film opens at a posthumous exhibition of Qi Lei's art work, where
the attendance is good for the first day, but interest in his death soon
wanes. He will be shown communicating with the other students and
performance artists, who either do not act favorably to his plan or
remain quiet. A performance artist eats a bar of soap with a knife and
fork and is revolted by what he eats, almost as much as the audience is
revolted by seeing him go through that routine. A fortune teller
mysteriously mentions that he will be reborn, that one life leads to
another. His friend, Longhair Guy, thinks he might be having mental
problems and brings him to a mental-health clinic so he can be dissuaded
from committing suicide, but a mistake in identity occurs and the doctor
takes him for the patient, Qi Lei. This was a hard scene to swallow as
not being a contrived one and a very forced metaphor on the political
situation, though it provided some much needed levity rather than any
particular increase in political insights.</P>
<P>The last 20 minutes of the film offers a surprise twist to the story and
thereby saves it somewhat from the doldrums it was in. It results in a
film that gets its message across that freedom is frozen in China, that
things are still far from democratic. It was a though-provoking film,
but in a very manipulative way, that was none too pleasing to view
despite its good intentions.</P>
