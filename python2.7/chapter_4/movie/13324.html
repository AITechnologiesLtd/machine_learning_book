<P>   As the crowd was leaving an advance screening of "There's
Something About Mary," a guy in the lobby was passing out
bottles of hair gel with the name of the film on the logo.  The
stuff was free, so why not?  Everyone grabbed, a few
laughed, some tucked the bottles into their handbags and
jacket pockets.  But a few groaned aaaargh and tossed the
stuff into the trash without smelling or trying the substance. 
Why the overreaction?  The "hair gel" is the movie's biggest
joke, or, more accurately, the grossest sally.  It's the gag that
everyone will be talking about.  If this movie were up for an
Oscar (which is doubtful), this is the sort of thing that the
Academy would remember at voting time even if the film had
opened thirteen months before the poll.  When Mary
(Cameron Diaz) accepts a dab of the gel from Ted (Ben
Stiller), who is madly in love with her, and places it on the
front of her sunshine-bright blond hair, the audience roars. 
Why?  You'll have to see the movie, though it's likely as not
that your pals already spilled the beans (so to speak).</P>
<P>   They always tell us in film school about the critic who roars
with laughter, and while he's doubling up with mirth he's
moaning, "This is awful, oh this is terrible, ah this picture is
the pits."  This is the kind of reaction this movie gives.  The
script has a few corkers and cases of multiple mistaken
identities that you probably won't figure out. For the most part,
though, its humor depends on the same sorts of gross-outs
that the Farrelly brothers were noted for in their previous
exercise in coarseness, "Dumb and Dumber."  "Dumb and
Dumber" has a plot that's similar to this one, also prominently
featuring a dog (Jeff Daniels ran a dog-grooming service) and
a bottle of beer which turns out to be not a bottle of beer. 
Like this, it involves a run-in with a gangster and a
rendezvous with a cop.  In fact Roger Ebert, who gave "Dumb
and Dumber" only two stars, admitted that "there is a moment
that made me laugh so loudly I embarrassed myself...I just
couldn't stop."  There's more than one twinkling just like this in
"There's Something About Mary," particularly involving a dog
which in one case reacts strongly to a tranquilizer and in
another, to speed.</P>
<P>   The sitcom plot revolves around an obsessive love that Ted
has felt toward Mary for thirteen years.  A student in a Rhode
Island high school, he asks her to the prom, is amazed that
she accepts, but then circumstances intervene which force
him to cancel the date.  Years later, he hears that she has
moved to Miami and hires a would-be private investigator,
Healy (Matt Dillon) to track her down.  When Healy finds her,
he also falls instantly in love and is determined to hide her
existence from his client while he courts her for himself.  The
film follows the usual strategy of romantic comedy, which is to
put obstacles in the paths of the lovers until the very end,
when the relationship is consummated or at least confirmed.</P>
<P>   There are two hilarious dog scenes.  In one instance,
Healy, using spy equipment, overhears Mary's neighbor
Magda (Lin Shaye) insist that Mary accept as a boy friend
only a guy who gets a friendly reaction for her Border terrier.
This little dog has growled at every stranger who enters the
house.  To insure a cordial reception, Healy tosses a
tranquilizer through the window, the dog eats, then passes out
requiring Healy to administer artifical respiration, followed by
electric shock stimulation.  In a reverse situation, the dog has
swallowed an upper and in one of the most riotous battles
ever filmed between man and terrier, Ted is vociferously
attacked, his reputation saved only when he ducks and the
dog flies through the window.  The most controversial scene
finds Ted taking a certain action before a date with Mary, one
which is designed to calm him down and which forms the
basis of the hair gel joke.  Yet another gross-out takes place
when Ted gets a part of his body caught in the zipper of his
pants just as he is to escort Mary to the prom and requires
the help of Mary's mother, her stepfather, a fireman, a cop,
and a team of paramedics.</P>
<P>   Political correctness takes a vacation as the Farrelly
brothers lampoon retarded adults and a cripple alike, while
spoofing psychiatrists, gays, and obese women.  </P>
<P>  Like "Dumb and Dumber," the plot is pitched at the level of
base, lewd and obscene films like "Mall Rats" and
"Trainspotting," and should appeal mightily to high-school
kids.  That's not to say that adults will sit through the film with
a straight face.  This is the sort of picture that you can't help
laughing with while realizing all the while that it's appealing to
your basest stretches.  In other words, you'll react just like the
critics.</P>
