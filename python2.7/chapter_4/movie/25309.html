<PRE>                            CHICKEN RUN
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The British Aardman Animation
          team, Oscar winners, make their first feature
          length film.  It is a satire on all those old
          World War II POW escape films, especially THE
          GREAT ESCAPE.  But it is done as chickens trying
          to escape from a chicken farm.  The film relies
          too heavily on that one joke.  Somehow the
          Aardman charm just does not work for 85 minutes.
          We are left with a few jokes that really are
          funny and a lot that is overly familiar and not
          very good.  The film did not work for me.
          Rating: 4 (0 to 10), 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Nick Park is now a three time Academy Award winner having won
Oscars for his shorts "Creature Comforts," "The Wrong Trousers," and
"A Close Shave."  The latter two feature his characters Wallace and
Gromit.  He has made his trademark to have his clay animation
characters have teeth that do not quite fill the cheeks from side to
side so there is a gap on each side.  In this country his style may
best be recognized in some commercials he has done, particularly
Chevron ads with talking cars.  It takes a little chutzpah for him
to do a feature length film with chickens satirizing World War II
POW escape films like THE PASSWORD IS COURAGE, STALAG 17, THE
COLDITZ STORY, and especially THE GREAT ESCAPE.  In the first place
it is a little hard for Park and co-director Peter Lord to sustain
one joke for that length of time.  The joke in his popular Wallace
and Gromit stories are that Wallace is such a dull personality.  It
takes considerably more character value to keep an audience
interested for 85 minutes.  In the second place chickens do not have
teeth or wide cheeks so he must give up his trademark or have his
chickens look not very much like chickens.  He does the latter.
Does the Nick Park charm work for a feature film?  In my opinion,
not really.  There were chuckles throughout the film but the story
is cliched and silly.  Apparently that is part of the point and that
can be done in satire if the film just remains entertaining.  It
becomes a little too much of the same good thing.</P>
<P>     Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha) is one smart chicken.  She
knows that her days are numbered at the chicken farm where she
lives.  Sooner or later she will stop producing eggs.  And she knows
that when a chicken stops providing breakfast, she provides dinner.
So every night she tries to escape from the barbed wire fences and
every night she is caught and thrown into solitary confinement.
After several attempts and after involving other chickens, she is
about at her chicken-wits' end.</P>
<P>     No escape plan works until an American rooster named Rocky the
Rooster (Mel Gibson) comes flying over the compound one day.  So
chickens can fly!  The news is inspiration to all the hens.  They
convince a reluctant Rocky to teach the group to fly and lead them
all over the fence.  There are a lot of jokes, but most are more
cute than funny.  The few surprises in the plot have a way of
telegraphing themselves.  The plot seems to have been written on
autopilot and, except for the choice of animals, is very familiar.
John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams provide a nice military score
reminiscent of Elmer Bernstein's score for THE GREAT ESCAPE.</P>
<P>     Park and Lord have chosen a number of major British actresses
to voice the chickens and humans, though their names will be
familiar mostly to art house crowds here.  He has Miranda Richardson
(of THE CRYING GAME and MERLIN), Jane Horrocks (of LITTLE VOICE) and
Imelda Staunton.  The main character is played by Julia Sawalha who
is almost unknown in the US.  To balance this, apparently top
billing unjustifiably goes to Mel Gibson.</P>
<P>     Park's cartoons have always had a dark side and this film has a
few grim scenes involving head chopping that could be disturbing to
younger children, so parents should not be fooled by the G-rating.
In some ways this film is even grimmer than the war films it
imitates.  The prisoners in the war had the Geneva Convention to
give them some protection and they could look forward to being
released at the end of the war.  These chickens could be killed any
time at the farmer's will and their captivity would never end of its
own.  So if you look for it the story is fairly grim.  Still, the
script shies away from looking at the implications of the treatment
of domestic animals unlike some better films like Caroline
Thompson's excellent BLACK BEAUTY (1994).</P>
<P>     This film is a "curate's egg" as the British would say. Some
parts are much better than others.  Overall it does not deliver
quite enough.  I give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4
to +4 scale.  Stay through the end of the credits.</P>
