<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 stars</P>
<P>"Get ready to root for the bad guy," trumpet Payback's advertising
taglines.  With a mean spirit and a bad temper, Mel Gibson returns to
form in a film that is so nasty it's almost refreshing.  The film's dark
and cynical edge is driven by Terry Hayes and Brian Helgeland's
screenplay (based on The Hunter by Richard Stark), and Helgeland also
directs with a similarly edgy style.  The scripting bears similarities
to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in its cleverness and wit; both
films consistently keep themselves two steps ahead of their audiences.
But also like Lock, Stock, Payback's screenplay is responsible for its
only major downfall.  Character and meaning are afterthoughts, whilst
violence and brutality take center stage.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, the film gels quite nicely.  The combination of
Helgeland's hostile direction and Gibson's eccentric title performance
is a winning one.  Gibson especially seems to relish the opportunity of
playing a bad guy.  A really bad guy.</P>
<P>In fact, in the first ten minutes or so of Payback we've already
witnessed Porter (Gibson) take money off a street beggar, steal
cigarettes from a waitress, and take advantage of some poor guys credit
card.  You see, after a money heist, Porter's partner Val (Gregg Henry)
and wife Lynn (Deborah Kara Unger) double cross him - they shoot him in
the back and leave him for dead.  Much to their disgust, Porter soon
makes it known to them that he is indeed live and well, and thirsty for
revenge.  The tough Porter is now even tougher, and he will do
absolutely anything to win back his share of the loot.</P>
<P>I could complain about Payback's lack of heart and emotion, but I guess
that would be missing the point.  No doubt both Brian Helgeland and Mel
Gibson intended to create something different, something that could
separate itself from the many other blood-soaked crime capers.  In that
way, Payback is a success, though that's not to say it is totally
original.  The film borrows bits and pieces from other films and gives a
fresh spin on them.  Although the old cigarette dropped on petrol trick
has been done numerous times before, it seems irresistible when
performed by Gibson.   There is something about watching a cuddly
Hollywood star trapped inside a vividly portrayed world of crime that
immediately captivates.</P>
<P>Although flawed with a script that is too clever for its own good,
Payback provides great light entertainment.  In fact, I was often so
amused by this film that I became frustrated knowing that the inevitable
would come - an ending that really doesn't satisfy.  By the time that
Payback reels through its final few scenes, it is obvious that the film
is too weak on plot and characters to make it a memorable flick.  It is
also obvious, though, that almost all of Payback is immensely enjoyable.</P>
