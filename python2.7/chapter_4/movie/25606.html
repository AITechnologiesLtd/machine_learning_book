<PRE>THE PATRIOT</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Roland Emmerich
Written by: Robert Rodat</PRE>
<P>Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a former war hero who now runs a plantation 
with his family in late 18th century South Carolina. The rest of the country 
is up in arms about King George's taxation from England, and they are crying 
for revolution. Martin says he will not fight, but his son, Gabriel (Heath 
Ledger), joins the colonial army against his father's will. Martin's friend, 
Col. Burwell (the excellent Chris Cooper), is Gabriel's commanding officer 
and promises to look after the boy. Martin tries to go on with his life, but 
soon finds himself drawn into the conflict when the sadistic British Colonel 
Tavington (Jason Isaacs) destroys his home and his life. Martin decides to 
seek revenge by joining and eventually leading the local militia. His ambush 
tactics and countless victories cause the British to give him the nickname 
"The Ghost". As Benjamin and Gabriel continue to win victories, the British 
decide that more brutal tactics are in order. General Cornwallis (Tom 
Wilkinson), who is in charge of the South Carolina aspect of the war, 
employs Colonel Tavington to use whatever means are necessary to bring 
Martin in. This includes going after his family, being watched by his 
deceased wife's sister, Charlotte (Joely Richardson).</P>
<P>I must admit, "The Patriot" wasn't quite what I expected after seeing the 
movie's trailers. I think I expected a massive, three hour long epic like 
"Braveheart", but it was... well, something quite different. Actually, 
that's one of the biggest problems with this movie; "The Patriot" is never 
quite sure what kind of movie it's trying to be. It switches around amongst 
several possible genres without ever finding one that quite fits. At times 
the movie is a glorious war movie, then a movie showing the horrors of war, 
then a social commentary, a history lesson, a heart-warming family movie, a 
sappy romantic movie. The list goes on and on, but I'll stop here rather 
than driving what I'm trying to say through your head like a rail road 
spike. Despite this and a cliche ridden plot, "The Patriot" is still a 
decent and entertaining movie thanks to some great acting, costumes, 
scenery, and music. It also features some magnificent battle scenes, 
courtesy of Roland Emmerich's ("Independence Day") astute direction. When 
"The Patriot" stays on the battlefield, it's rousing and entertaining; when 
it tries to be more emotional, things go somewhat awry.</P>
<P>Mel Gibson gives an outstanding performance and leads a strong cast through 
an otherwise weak script. Gibson's acting is interesting; he appears wooden 
and emotionless at first but develops more and more emotion as the story 
goes on. Heath Ledger ("10 Things I Hate About You") delivers a promising, 
if somewhat inexperienced performance, as the brash and willful son. Off the 
battlefield, the film is at its best when dealing with the father-son 
relationship. Ledger and Gibson are backed up by a colorful supporting cast 
composed of good, reliable actors like: Rene Oborjonois (Star Trek: Deep 
Space Nine) as a Reverend turned warrior; the always great Chris Cooper; and 
Tcheky Karyo ("The Messenger") as a French soldier who offers his services 
to the revolution. The only weak link in the cast (but what a weak link it 
is) is newcomer Lisa Brenner as Gabriel's love interest, Anne. Not only does 
she give a terrible performance, but she delivers a key dramatic speech to a 
crowd of supporters, at one point, and does it so poorly I actually started 
laughing out loud. Last we have Jason Isaacs ("Armageddon", "Event Horizon") 
giving a great performance in a horrible part. Isaac's historically 
inaccurate character is about as chiched a villain as is possible. The man 
does everything but laugh maniacally and twirl his moustache (thankfully he 
doesn't have a moustache). Yet Isaacs is such a good performer and was 
obviously having such fun with the part, it really didn't matter.</P>
<P>There are a lot of things working for "The Patriot" and nearly as many 
working against it. On the for side we have some great performances, good 
direction, interesting battle scenes, and yet another wonderful score from 
John Williams (can the man do no wrong?). Against it we have a cliched 
script, one really bad performance, and a story that doesn't know where it's 
going. You'll have to weigh the pros and cons before deciding whether or not 
to see this. I felt the battle scenes tilted the pros in favor of a higher 
rating. Speaking of the battle scenes, one of the first ones we see is truly 
fascinating. It involves Benjamin Martin attacking a caravan, practically on 
his own, and defeating every soldier in it. This was a fascinating scene 
because the tactics used by the British were quite historically accurate 
(and obviously very poor since they were beaten by one man), and there was a 
realism to the scene that you don't often get in these kinds of movies. I'd 
best warn those of you who are faint of heart, "The Patriot" takes no 
prisoners and edits nothing out. We see all the horrors that come with war, 
including innocent men, women, and children being slaughtered by the enemy. 
A few of these scenes are absolutely heart wrenching (some people in the 
theater broke down crying). "The Patriot" runs a long 164 minutes, and as 
interesting as the movie may be, it feels that long. I'd recommend it to 
fans of Gibson since he turns in a stellar performance, and to anyone who 
enjoyed "Braveheart" since the similarities are obvious. History buffs (like 
me) will find certain segments painfully inaccurate (I'm pretty sure 18th 
century muskets weren't capable of that kind of accuracy, and George 
Washington played a slightly more significant role in the war), but should 
still have a good time catching historical references. I give the film three 
and a half out of five stars.</P>
