                         AS GOOD AS IT GETS 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
              3 :-) :-) :-)  for being as good as it comes</PRE>
<P>AS GOOD AS IT GETS is one of those brown packages that you get in the
mail that far exceeds all your expectations. Well written, sensitively
directed and wonderfully acted, makes this unusual romantic comedy one
of those rare treasures that one can look back on with utter delight.</P>
<P>Meet Simon the fag, Carol the waitress and Melvin the neurotic,
obsessive/compulsive, acid-tongued writer from hell. Mix these three
intriguing characters from very different walks in life together and the
result is an explosive experiment of human interactions. Watch the
neurotic writer (Jack Nicholson) spit hellfire on the fag (Greg Kinnear)
and waitress (Helen Hunt). Watch the fag get brutally beaten before
emerging triumphant, post emotional catharsis with renewed artistic
inspiration, thanks to the compassion of the waitress. Watch the
waitress struggle to bring up a sick child alone, waiter on the neurotic
writer before writing long thank-you letters where conscience becomes
the letter's most difficult issue. Then observe the neurotic demon
change into a guardian angel when he helps shelter the fag, the dog,
before falling in love with the most wonderful woman in the entire
world. This is life, and this is as good as it gets.</P>
<P>I've never liked Jack Nicholson as an actor or as a person. However, one
has to commend him on making his character Melvin, one of the most
ascorbic and entertaining characters to shine on screen. Greg Kinnear
uses his puppy-eyed look to effectively to draw sympathy from the
audience when he is savagely beaten. Lastly, the ever charming, ever
delightful Helen Hunt, whose character is similar to Jamie in MAD ABOUT
YOU, is ideal as the waitress who speaks her mind and holds her own.
Fine performances from all concerned. Making this movie experience one
of the most enjoyable this year.</P>
