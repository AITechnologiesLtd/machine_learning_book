Reviewed by Dustin Putman, November 7, 1999.</P>
<P>Controversial even before its release, "The Insider" has recently been under 
fire for its mostly accurate, but allegedly dramatized telling of events that 
took place in 1996 between the news show "60 Minutes," its television station 
CBS, and the tobacco industry. "60 MInutes" reporter Mike Wallace is one of 
many that has let his displeasure known, due to what he says are embellished 
details in the film, as well as the unfavorable depiction of himself. Based 
on the widely argued Vanity Fair article by Mary Brenner, "The Man Who Knew 
Too Much," filmmaker Michael Mann (1995's "Heat") has crafted a highly 
charged drama that, despite featuring next to no action, occasionally shifts 
over to being a sort of heart-stopping paranoid thriller. </P>
<P>The events that surround the goings-on in 1996 begin somewhere around the 
time middle-aged Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) is fired from his job as an 
executive for a tobacco company. Jobless and with a housewife (Diane Venora), 
two young children, one that has acute asthma, and a nice home, to support, 
Jeffrey Wigand is sought out by "60 Minutes" producer Lowell Bergman (Al 
Pacino), who is working on a story about the question of whether tobacco is 
addictive, which the companies say aren't. At first trying to avoid Lowell, 
Jeffrey finally decides to hold an interview with "60 Minutes" for a paycheck 
that he really needs, despite his contractual obligation that says he won't 
ever say anything that might put Brown & Williamson in hot water. The 
revelation that Jeffrey holds, however, could very well ruin him and destroy 
CBS if they run the interview he holds, in which he reveals that the company 
knew all along cigarettes were addictive and had begun to add various other 
chemicals so as to give them more of a kick. </P>
<P>For all of its very serious, disputatious subject matter, the strength of 
"The Insider" lies not with the premise, but in the excellent treatment it is 
given. In essence, a docudrama, and perhaps carrying a story more suitable 
for television, director Mann has transformed it into a 2 3/4-hour motion 
picture opus that is filled with the sort of rich details and highly felt 
characters that only a great director could come up with. </P>
<P>The first half is told mostly from the point-of-view of Jeffrey Wigand, a 
recovering alcoholic, but caring husband and father, whose life ultimately 
takes a disheartening turn when his family starts to receive ominous death 
threats and are suddenly overrun by the media, signaling their separation 
and, later, divorce. Jeffrey is played by the 35-year-old Australian actor 
Russell Crowe (1996's "L.A. Confidential"), and what an amazing performance 
he gives. Abandoning his usual good looks and gaining over 20 lbs. for the 
role, Crowe is not only wholly believable as a man nearly twenty years his 
senior, but he virtually disappears into his character, equipped with a 
pitch-perfect American accent. Better yet, he portrays Jeffrey Wigand as a 
flawed, but sympathetic man whom you know cares for his family, but also is 
dedicated to telling the truth, despite his possible downfall. </P>
<P>The focus then shifts midway through to Lowell Bergman, and when this occurs, 
the picture admittedly loses some of its punch. The conflict that Lowell 
faces is certainly an intriguing one, as he is devastated to discover that he 
was the antagonist that caused Jeffrey's collapse, and begins to grow 
doubtful of the validity of "60 Minutes," but Lowell simply isn't as fully 
written as Jeffrey. With a wife (Lindsay Crouse) and two teenage sons of his 
own, Lowell puts himself in Jeffrey's place and realizes he did a careless 
thing without thinking about the consequences. As Lowell Begman, Al Pacino is 
his usual captivating self, and is well-cast, but it really isn't much of a 
stretch for him, in comparison to a handful of his other roles.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is filled to the brimming point with first-rate talent, 
from Christopher Plummer's bravura turn as Mike Wallace, to Diane Venora's 
poignant portrayal of Jeffrey's trophy wife who wishes for something more, to 
young Hallie Eisenberg as Jeffrey's daughter, who has abandoned her famed 
Pepsi commercial spots to show that she is a natural young actress.</P>
<P>The largest compliment that can be given to "The Insider" is in showing the 
questionably dark corners that people can back themselves into. Director Mann 
has a gift with depicting the threat and danger of average, everyday 
surroundings, and is aided by one of the most impressive examples of 
cinematography so far this year, only equaled by "American Beauty." Director 
of photography Dante Spinotti benefits from intermittently using visually 
stunning colors amid the washed out hues of modern suburbia and New York 
City, as well as in using handheld cameras that put the audience in the 
moment, and tight close-ups. Two astounding sequences come to mind that 
should be noted, the first set at a desolate golf driving range late at 
night, and the latter involving a noise one of Jeffrey's daughters hears 
outside. Suspenseful and even a little eerie, those are two adjectives that, 
in lesser hands, you'd never hear being mentioned in a review about a film of 
this genre. Furthermore, the pulsing music score, by Lisa Gerrard and Pieter 
Bourke, is dynamite.</P>
<P>By the last half hour, "The Insider" had begun to wear out its welcome, 
introducing further subplots and unneeded scenes, and neglecting a few of the 
characters I would liked to have seen given more closure, particularly 
Venora. But still, Mann, a master filmmaker who admittedly doesn't know when 
to hit the edit button, has made a film that is both powerful and 
thought-provoking. Whether much of it is accurate or not to the real-life 
story remains to be seen, but as a film, even one that has taken several 
liberties in search for the truth, it is an electric drama.</P>
