<PRE>                           CRADLE WILL ROCK
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: In the 1930s art and politics
          inextricably intertwine in this (mostly) true story
          of big money interests fighting the WPA's Federal
          Theater Project.  Also retold is the tale of the
          disagreement between Nelson Rockefeller and Diego
          Rivera over the mural that Rivera painted for
          Rockefeller Center.  Tim Robbins, who both wrote
          and directed captures a feel for the heady days
          when American talent seemed to be blossoming but
          when the mostly liberal sentiment of art was seen
          as a threat to the wealthy who strongly influenced
          the government.  This film will certainly be in my
          top three films of the year.  Rating: 9  (0 to 10),
          +3 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     In the 1930S during the Great Depression massive numbers of
Americans were out of work.  In 1934 the number was 11 million.  To cut
unemployment and get people working again the Works Progress
Administration was established.  It eventually employed 8.5 million
people to improve the infrastructure and culture of the country.
Laborers built roads, bridges, parks, buildings, and airports.  Artists
were employed by the Federal Arts Project, The Federal Writers Project,
and the Federal Theater Project.  The Federal Theater Project (FTP)
lasted from 1935 to 1939 when it was shut down by the House Committee
on Un-American Activities for its left-leaning plays.</P>
<P>     CRADLE WILL ROCK combines the stories of two incidents of the
1930s.  In 1933 Nelson Rockefeller objected to the mural that Diego
Rivera was creating for Rockefeller Center which depicted Lenin as a
liberator.  In 1937 Marc Blitzstein's play "The Cradle Will Rock" was
to be produced under the aegis of the FTP staged by Orson Welles and
John Houseman, but the government withdrew support with dramatic
consequences.</P>
<P>     The film begins with a homeless woman Olive Stanton (Emily Watson)
catching some sleep behind the screen of a movie theater.  The theater
is showing a newsreel about the spread of Fascism in Europe, but how
things are better and more optimistic in the US.  Stanton clearly knows
more about conditions in the US than the patrons of the theater.
Chased from this shelter she looks for a job with the Federal Theater
Project.</P>
<P>     The FTP is an explosion of creative chaos presided over by the
tireless Hallie Flanagan (Cherry Jones).  She reads new plays, makes
production assignments, and does a wealth of other jobs.  We are soon
introduced to Orson Welles (Angus Macfadyen), John Houseman (Cary
Elwes) putting on a creatively-staged production of Marlowe's DOCTOR
FAUSTUS.  They are also preparing a polemical play, "The Cradle Will
Rock," for the FTP.</P>
<P>     The wealthy also mix in with a strong interest in the arts.  We
meet Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack), an oil magnate more interested
in art and Latin America than he is in petroleum.  He has commissioned
the admired Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades) to paint a mural for
Rockefeller Center, the theme of which is to be "Man's Intelligence
Controlling Nature."</P>
<P>     But not everybody is happy with this flowering of creativity.  Icy
Hazel Huffman (Joan Cusack) and a frustrated vaudeville ventriloquist
Tommy Crickshaw (Bill Murray) do not like the leftist message of many
of the plays present.  They are organizing to fight what they think is
becoming a liberal establishment.  The film chronicles their collision
with the artists and playwrights they oppose.</P>
<P>     The casting is quite good.  Especially notable is the Angus
Macfadyen impression of Orson Welles.  Welles has now been portrayed by
a number of different actors on the screen but never by someone who
with so close a physical resemblance or who got the facial expressions
down so well.  Less familiar is John Houseman but Cary Elwes at least
sounds a good deal like Houseman.  Cherry Jones just sparkles as Hallie
Flanagan.</P>
<P>     The characters of CRADLE WILL ROCK are in a kettle with a seething
stew of politics and art.  Tim Robbins who wrote and directed, sees the
events of this film to be the beginnings of the 1950s Congressional
witch hunts for communists.  It also provides much of the reason that
even today there are few plays on Broadway with any real political
meat.  Art today is about colors and textures and not political ideas
for the most part.  Few works in art museums have strong political
comment and much of Broadway is given over to fluffy plays with little
political bite.  Ironically Robbins makes a very clear statement that
only some censorship is bad.  Aldo Silvano (John Turturro) does not
want to see "The Cradle Will Rock" be censored for its unpopular
political message.  Yet he is outraged when he hears his children
singing a song that is sung by the Brown Shirts in Italy.  In this case
he is censoring his own children's singing of a Fascist song.  That
seems right, but where is the line to be drawn?  Plays of this time
could appeal to any political persuasion instead of having to appeal to
people of every political persuasion as they do today.  The wealthy and
powerful do not want art to have messages that threaten their
interests. The rich who have been the patrons of the arts do not what
to have to choose between what is good for art and their own welfare.</P>
<P>     The film is good entertainment.  Is it accurate history?  There is
some distortion, certainly.  Just having two art and political
censorship events occurring at the same time instead of years apart
leads one to believe that such clashes were more frequent than they
really were.  Robbins portrays the people who agree with his political
viewpoint being likable, intelligent, artistically fulfilled people.
Those who oppose artistic freedom are maladjusted neurotics if not
out-and-out wackos.  By leaving no doubt as to whom the viewer should
credit as being in the right, Robbins talks down to his audience and
demonstrates that he does not trust them to choose the correct side of
the debate.  One could ask if Lenin was the great liberator that Rivera
wanted to portray, where are all the people who genuinely believe that
he liberated them? History seems to have sided with Rockefeller.</P>
<P>     While CRADLE WILL ROCK plays a little fast and loose with history,
it still is an enjoyable watch and one of the best films of the year.
I rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
