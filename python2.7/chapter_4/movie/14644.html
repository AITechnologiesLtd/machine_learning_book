<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>I have not read the novel by "Anonymous" Joe Klein, and I wouldn't have 
picked the film "Primary Colors" as my first choice of the weekend, but 
I was pleasantly engaged.</P>
<P>First, John Travolta is right-on as Jack Stanton -- the Clintonesque 
quiet yet raspy drawl, the gut, the "tell me your pain" empathy. Emma 
Thompson is almost as strong as first lady-to-be Susan Stanton. In one 
scene in which this stolidly patient wife discovers another dalliance, 
Thompson snaps magnificently: it's as if her soul is slipping out of 
her. Her anger and then her grief are stunning to watch.</P>
<P>She'll probably be forgotten by the end of the year, but Kathy Bates 
should get nominated for supporting actress. As Libby the "Dust Buster," 
her character protects (as much as possible) the name of Jack Stanton, a 
friend from the 70's. Bates brings a literally crazy abandon to Libby, 
who is one of the few characters who is even concerned about taking and 
passing a morality test.</P>
<P>I've read in other reviews about a flaw in narration. Henry is the 
campaign worker through whose eyes we see most of the action. The 
trouble is that Adrian Lester turns in a performance that is solid but 
not dynamic. Sure, no one wants to try to out-act Bates and Travolta and 
Thornton, but Henry never shows us the passion that he claims to hold in 
his heart; he keeps it in his head. What causes him to stop working for 
one politician, to forfeit his relationship with a beautiful woman, to 
change his mind so easily when Jack Stanton asks him to?</P>
<P>"Primary Colors" sports a superb cast, down to the extras. Mike Nichols' 
last few efforts have been strong and solid, and this adds to the 
string. </P>
