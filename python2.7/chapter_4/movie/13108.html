<PRE>Broadway Damage (1997)</PRE>
<P>Seen 30 May 1998 for $8 with Andrea at the Quad Cinema</P>
<P>"Greetings from Greenwich Village" is the subtitle to this bubbly little
independent film, written, edited, and directed by Victor Mignatti.
Considering it's practically a one-man show, it can be forgiven its flaws.
In fact, it's lucky it got made at all,
 in all likelihood. </P>
<P>*Broadway Damage* presents us with two young people starting out. Marc
(Michael Lucas)  is a cute young gay man, would-be actor, and Cynthia
(Mara Hobel) is his fabulous female friend who does not let more than a
few extra pounds get in the way of self-esteem or her dream to work for
New Yorker editor Tina Brown. She thinks she's better than entry level,
and doesn't try too hard to do anything but try getting an interview with
Ms. Brown in a variety of inventive methods. </P>
<P>"Broadway damage" is acting jargon I didn't fully understand, but I think
it refers to those would-be actors who are particularly stuck on the idea
of performing live on stage. Throughout the film we see Marc and his
friend Robert (Aaron Williams) getting feedback from a drama coach as
they recite lines or sing. Robert is stuck on Marc and with his goofy
Gilligan-style hat and glasses he is the "nerd" role in the movie. While
pining away for Marc, he attempts to woo a hunky, bespectacled,
Monet-loving, Zola-reading clerk in a kitschy card store. </P>
<P>Meanwhile, Marc falls in love with neighbor David (Hugh Panaro), whom he
spots in a backing building visible from his fire escape. Hearing him sing
a song helps him fall a bit harder. But David is involved in a
relationship, and as the story progresses, David turns out not to be at
all what he seems. </P>
<P>*Broadway Damage* is light, fluffy entertainment; it provides a lot of
amusing little moments and more than a few stereotypes along the way. But
the audience (98% gay) seemed to love it nonetheless. Mara Hobel, best
known for playing the Christina Crawford as a child role in Mommie
Dearest, is the stereotypical fat girl fag hag; Marc is a "ten" but
doesn't think so--"my arms aren't big enough"; Robert loves Sondheim, of
course. The movie has a curious throwback quality. Finding an dilapidated
apartment via obituaries is something straight out of a 1970s sitcom.
Didn't Oscar and Felix have to do this once? Nary a mention of AIDS. Just
frivolous amusement all the way. Costumes and interior design are more
important here than cinematography, which is rather basic. </P>
<P>I could go on about "why are these people friends?" but why? Yes, it's odd
that they are friends but no one knows the clothes hound Cynthia comes
from a family that's stinkin' rich. But it's all so amusing--at least at
the time. Broadway Damage shows young people starting out in life and
love. Mostly gay. Hearts broken and rebuilt along the way. Possibly the
biggest problem they have in life is a mouse and rat problem in their
hovel. It doesn't take itself too seriously and neither should you. Go and
enjoy it. Class dismissed.</P>
<P>TOILET NOTE: There were just three women in this audience, and they were
thrilled to discover that for once, there was no long line at the Ladies'
Room. A once-in-a-lifetime event.</P>
