<PRE>THE HI-LO COUNTRY</PRE>

<P>   The paradox of "The Hi-Lo Country" is that in many ways it
resembles the old-fashioned western with its scenes in a
saloon, the interminable fist-fights, the assertive females; and
yet it departs from the genre in so many others.  For one
particular, the lines between good guys and bad are not so
clear-cut.  For another, it does not depict one lone gunfighter
as hero, but opts instead to be a buddy movie about two men
who are so tight that they would die for each other.  In yet
another route, perhaps the most significant one, it
demonstrates its director's preoccupation with showing a
historic crossroads that took the last frontier into the
corporate age, much to the regret of those who would like to
think of the American West as our last remnant of
individualism.  Significantly it is directed by
Stephen Frears, a British helmer brought up in the city of
Leicester who looks at the heartland of America from an
outsider's point of view with the understanding that only a
disinterested third party can bring.  "The Hi-Lo Country" is a
picture that can fascinate the most die-hard urbanite, the sort
of dude who thought that westerns were strictly for the
kiddies.  It could enchant even New Yorkers who believe that
if you sail west on the Hudson you'd simply fall off the edge.</P>
<P>   What is the source of this charm?  Part of the secret is in
the fortuitous casting of Woody Harrelson, whose role as an
architect in a previous picture was more indecent than the
proposal of the title.  Out of place there as Demi Moore's
wife, he is right at home in Hi-Lo country where the Texas-
born, fair-haired lad who made a name for himself in the TV
series "Cheers" is a natural on a horse--roping steers, and
causing mayhem throughout the countryside.  By equipping
Billy Crudup as his diametrical opposite  and yet credibly
showing how the two got along so famously, director Frears
succeeds admirably in underscoring the surprises that
incongruity can convey.  Some exquisite photography on
location in New Mexico, particularly in the long shots of a
cattle roundup, gives the film its nostalgic kick: a sight or two
to symbolize the end of an era when the region of hard-
drinking Marlboro men gives way to the turf of corporate agri-
business, in which cattle get shipped by current but decidedly
unromantic methodology.</P>
<P>   What drives the story forward is the interest that the two
fast friends have in the same woman.  At a time that the
nation's strong young men shipped out to Europe and the Far
East during World War II leaving behind a surplus of newly
aggressive, man-hungry women, Mona (Patricia Arquette)
settled in marriage for a man she could barely stand.  No
sooner did the boys come home in 1945 then she cast her
eyes and then some on handsome, Pete (Billy Crudup), a
strong, silent type also pursued by his regular girl friend
Josepha (Penelope Cruz).  Obsessed by his desire for Mona,
Pete is crushed when Mona shifts her devotion to Pete's best
buddy and riding partner, Big Boy (Woody Harrelson), a self-
destructive, macho man who looks death in the eye without
fear but who is just slightly domesticated by the woman
whose body he compares not unfavorably to that of his best
horse.</P>
<P>   Stephen Frears, effectively, nay triumphantly, transforming
a novel by Max Evans, portrays the New West which is
evolving while the passion of its characters plays out.  Cattle
Baron Jim Ed Love (Sam Elliot) is buying up land, even
forcing out reluctant cowboys with the blessing of the local
magistrates.  Love has earned the contempt of the
townspeople, who celebrate Pete's powerful fists as they land
with fury on the Ed Love's henchmen.  Pete's disdain does
not stop on his doorstep, as he scorns his own kid brother,
Little Boy (Cole Hauser), for staying home during the war and
working for the detested buyer.</P>
<P>   According to critic David Thomsen, Stephen Frears once
said that he does not enjoy working in America, but you'd not
know it from this picture.  This movie comes across as a
paen, a joyous ode to the majesty of the big country, to an
area that the director's compatriots must look at with envy
from their tight little island.  Perhaps the covetous English
look with vindictive glee on the very technology that has
transformed the land of Big Boy into the terra firma of a more
productive but obviously less interesting corporate
agribusiness.  At any rate, that's the impression you take
away from this large, brawling, lusty film which boasts nothing
short of mythic resonance.</P>
