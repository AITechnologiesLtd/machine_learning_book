<PRE>                                 CASINO
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<PRE>        "Running a casino is like robbing a bank with no cops around.
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins.  It's like a morality
car wash."
                            --Sam "Ace" Rothstein</PRE>
<P>In Casino, director Martin Scorsese takes a good look at those who run
Las Vegas' casinos as well as the also-rans.  The thought that some 30
million people visit Las Vegas each year (and, I confess to being one
of them), is enough to make you sick at heart. You may win now and then
but in the final computation everyone is a loser.  Of course, that does
not include the gangsters who run the casinos. For them it's a gold
mine.</P>
<P>Scorsese's film is based on the real life story (from Nicholas
Pileggi's book) of Sam "Ace" Rothstein, a big time bookie, who was sent
to Las Vegas by "the mob" to find out who was stealing, who tinkered
with the mechanisms of slot machines so they would win huge jackpots,
and to put a stop to it, as well as watch that the blackjack dealers
were kept honest.  Oddly, you are left with a lot of empathy for
Rothstein (Robert De Niro) largely because the way he plays his role
and Scorsese's direction.</P>
<P>While Rothstein may have known everything there was to know about
gambling, drugs, prostitution, alcohol. etc. he nevertheless falls
heavily for Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone).  He even goes so far as to
marry her, while she becomes a drug and alcohol user. This bodes no
good for Ace.   I do not think it did much for Sharon Stone, either, as
I felt she was miscast.</P>
<P>There is one other main character, Nicky (Joe Pesci), a childhood
friend of Ace, but too much of a trigger-happy mobster. Pesci runs away
with the film as he bends all his efforts to take over the operations
from his pal, Ace.</P>
<P>Also in the cast but in smaller roles are Alan King, James Woods, Don
Rickles L Q Jones and Kevin Pollak.</P>
<PRE>        Scorsese has succeeded in once again making an exciting film
        but it would not have hurt one iota if a half hour had been
        edited out along the way.</PRE>
