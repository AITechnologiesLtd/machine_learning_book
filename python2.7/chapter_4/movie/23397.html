<PRE>THE VIRGIN SUICIDES
by Athan Bezaitis
copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P> THE VIRGIN SUICIDES is a dark comedy that embodies some twisted views
on suburban family life and the true lack innocence of adolescence.
First-time writer and director Sofia Coppola, daughter of GODFATHER
creator Francis Ford Coppola, proves to us that she's not really an
actress (see THE GODFATHER, PART III), but that she does have the family
knack for provocative movie directing.  The movie is based upon Jeffrey
Eugenides' novel, The Virgin Suicides, a detective story about five
sisters who mysteriously commit suicide and the investigation by four
neighborhood boys who had fallen in love with them.  Coppola, however,
transforms the movie into her own allegory of five adolescent girls who
suffer from ruthlessly suppressed lives, their desperate plea for
self-expression, and the tragedy that besets their wretched existence.</P>
<P>Set in the mid-seventies, the plot follows the Lisbon family, with James
Woods, a physics teacher at the local high school, as the scatter
brained father, and Kathleen Turner as the uncommonly strict mother.
Their five daughters are beautiful, naturally blonde, and the desire of
every boy in the neighborhood.  When the youngest, Cecilia, mysteriously
attempts suicide, psychiatrist Danny DeVito recommends that she be
allowed to interact more socially, especially with boys.  So the Lisbon
girls are introduced to the boys of the neighborhood, who have already
been watching the girls from afar through half-opened window shades,
binoculars, and telescopes.  At a party in Cecilia's honor, the boys
witness a tragedy that shocks them out of their wits.  As a result, the
Lisbons fall into a deep suppression shutting out the rest of the world
by retreating into their own inner sanctum.  It appears they will never
recover until Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett), the high school heartthrob,
pursues the unattainable Lux (Kirsten Dunst).  He attempts to ask her to
the prom, but the only way her mother will allow him to take Lux is if
all the girls go together.  For the first time, the girls will venture
out of the home to interact socially in an environment other than
school.</P>
<P>The movie begins as a lighthearted comedy with some great cameos from
the likes of DeVito and town priest Scott Glenn (BACKDRAFT).  The tone,
however, turns somber once the children are exposed to the worst of
their suppression.  Kathleen Turner as mom reverts to her SERIAL MOM
days, making the kids burn their rock records and even withdrawing them
from school.  Reminiscent of 1987's FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC, the children
are forced to fantasize through travel guides, imagining a different
life in faraway lands. With every avenue of self-expression cut off, the
girls suffocate in their misery and cry out for help to the boys in the
neighborhood.</P>
<P>The film, with its large ensemble cast, is well acted, and director
Coppola gets the best out of old pros Woods and Turner, while at the
same time coaxing solid performances out of her young cast, especially
Dunst and Hartnett.  On the flip side, what the film lacks is solid
character development.  We don't learn enough about any of the
neighborhood boys, or the strict Lisbon parents, or the mysterious Trip
Fontaine.  Constantly floating from one sequence of events to the next,
I was left with too many unanswered questions as to whether the story
was a mystery about what drove the girls off the edge, or how the
neighborhood boys became so fascinated with them.  Either way, it takes
away some of the film's appeal with no "real" characters to latch on to
in order to help you through such a bizarre and fantastic situation.</P>
<P>Despite its flaws, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES is a success.  It's an eerie look
at life with a sick twist of fate for five beautiful sisters with the
world as their oyster.  With this film, Sofia Coppola will strike a
presence for herself on the Hollywood scene -- no longer to be known for
her infamous role as Michael Corleone's daughter.  Ford Coppola was
criticized for casting Sofia in that role, but now he will be praised
for helping to produce his daughter's beautiful film.</P>
