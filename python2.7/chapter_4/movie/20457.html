<PRE>                             AMERICAN BEAUTY
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     At last, a movie with no likable characters that is nothing short
of a joy to watch.  Let's see if AMERICAN PSYCHO can top that!</P>
<P>     AMERICAN BEAUTY chronicles the last year in the life of 42 year-old
hack magazine writer Lester Burnham (Spacey), a suburban loser that has
just about had it with his humdrum life and decides to make a few
changes to regain control, for better or for worse.  Those changes
include quitting his job and blackmailing his employers, buying a
vintage Firebird, taking a new job at the local fast food joint, buying
thousands of dollars worth of pot, and plotting to sleep with his
daughter's best friend (Suvari, the good girl from AMERICAN PIE, playing
the bad girl here).</P>
<P>     If you think he's gone over the edge, wait until you get a load of
his Realtor wife (Bening, playing an evil Martha Stewart – okay, a
*more* evil Martha Stewart).  Or the daughter (Birch), a zoned-out
basket of angst.  Or their neighbors, headed by a stern ex-Marine
(Cooper) and his pleasant but quietly psychotic drug-dealer son
(Bentley).  Everyone here is a creep, and it's delicious to watch them
play off one another – think of it as an updating of THE ICE STORM to
1999.</P>
<P>     The joy of BEAUTY lies in its brilliantly drawn characters, great
dialogue, flawless acting by all the players, and a clever voice-over by
Spacey that, for once, adds quite a bit to the picture.  For example,
we're told at the beginning that Lester is going to die.  While the
black comedy unfolds for two hours, we struggle to figure out exactly
how he's going to go.  Obviously, someone is going to kill him.  But
who, and how?  The genius of the script is that it could be anyone who
does it.</P>
<P>     Oscar nominations are deserved universally for the cast and crew,
and I hope AMERICAN BEAUTY is neither forgotten at Awards time nor at
the box office.  This is a rare and outstanding film that deserves
attention and will challenge some heady competition for a place as the
best film of the year.</P>
