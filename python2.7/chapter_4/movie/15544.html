<P>The small-scale film, in limited release, "Waking Ned Devine"
is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows
the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town.  Filled
with breathtaking scenery, 'characters', and delightful music,
the movie would be interesting even without a plot.</P>
<P>The story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned
in a review.</P>
<P>The film starts out with a sharp opening, which gives us a taste
of what is to follow: country folk with an inclination for a bit
of larceny.  What gets things going is the fact that a winner
of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small
town (pop 52) of Tullymore.  Who that person is, and how to
share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends
Jackie (Ian Bannen) and Michael (David Kelly).  Part detectives,
part scalawags, they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances
they face as the story unfolds.</P>
<P>The village consists of several amusing characters.  A clueless
pig farmer, temporary priest, and a witch.  There's also the
Lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the
up-and-up.</P>
<P>There are no Hollywood touches to this film - except for the
outer space introduction [!].  Pacing is right.  Towards
the end, it runs a bit out of steam, but that's okay because
for most of the 90 minutes we've been interested in the
goings on.  A mixture of laughs and (occasional)
sentiment - all the right emotions are engaged.</P>
<P>In one brief dream sequence - you'll know it when you see it - a
fantastic combination of color and music transports the
characters to a place you really hope exists.  One of the
key moments in the film.</P>
<P>The music, available on CD (LONDON 289 460 939-2) follows
the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering.</P>
<P>A fine film that's for everybody except action fans.  Somewhat
like 'The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain,'
... but livelier.</P>
