<PRE>                   THE OPPOSITE SEX AND HOW TO LIVE WITH THEM
                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     From the moment of their first meeting, David (Arye Gross) and
Carrie (Courteney Cox) are hopelessly attracted to each other.  THE
OPPOSITE SEX chronicles their first date, early relationship, first
night together, and other aspects of their relationship.  Kevin Pollak
plays Eli, David's best friend and Julie Brown is Zoe, Carrie's
roommate.  These two occasionally help, but more often hinder, the
developing attachment between David and Carrie.</P>
<P>     THE OPPOSITE SEX is an extremely funny and surprisingly insightful
look into the mating game.  Similar in style to SINGLES (although this
film was made first), THE OPPOSITE SEX concentrates on one relationship
instead of several.  Its depiction of the various stages of David and
Carrie's courtship is filled with little details that movies often find
unimportant but which are critical to real-life situations.  Many of
these are approached from a humorous vantage, but much of the comedy is
successful because the circumstances are so true-to-life.</P>
<P>     As for the humor in the film, it ranges from wit and satire to
belly- laughs.  Some of the best moments come when characters break the
fourth wall, turning to address the audience in the middle of a scene
with occasionally side-splitting asides.  Two of many amusing instances
involve a profane-but-hilarious parody of FIELD OF DREAMS' catch
phrase, "If you build it, he will come," and a sequence where David and
Carrie become subjects of a nature film crew doing a program on human
mating habits.  Also memorable, although far less humorous, is a
takeoff of ABC's NIGHTLINE.  Kevin Pollak does an impressive Ted
Koppel.</P>
<P>     As irreverent as the movie frequently is, it has a lot to say
about relationships.  As a result, THE OPPOSITE SEX has more depth than
might initially be supposed.  It isn't just another run-of-the-mill
romantic comedy, but one with bite and backbone.</P>
<P>     The main cast of four all do fine jobs.  None are well-known
actors, although Kevin Pollak has become more recognizable following
his role in A FEW GOOD MEN.  Courteney Cox and Arye Gross manage to
find the right balance between drama and comedy to bring across
real-seeming, sympathetic characters.  One of the great intangibles,
their chemistry, is flawless.  Julie Brown and Kevin Pollak, often
serving as a kind of "Greek Chorus" to detail the activities of their
friends to the audience, are equally as proficient.</P>
<P>     The production team of THE OPPOSITE SEX should be congratulated.
They have created a fresh, inventive comedy that is definitely worth a
look.  It's a wonder why it took Miramax so long to pick up the movie
for distribution, and a sad fact of life that, given the relative lack
of publicity, it won't be in theaters for long.  Nevertheless, there's
no denying that THE OPPOSITE SEX is a pleasant surprise.</P>
<PRE>                            Rating: 8.7 (A-, ***)   </PRE>
