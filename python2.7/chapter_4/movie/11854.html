[video] "The Grimm Brothers' Snow White"
A Postview, copyright 1998 p-m agapow</PRE>
<P>The classic fairy tale, fed ("Fargo" style) through a tree shredder.</P>
<P>The media-astute amongst you will recognise "The Grimm Brothers' Snow 
White" as the latest in the string of "X's Y".  For example:</P>
<PRE>        * "Bram Stoker's Dracula"
        * "Jackie Collin's Hollywood Wives"
        * "Steven Seagal's Career's Shot To Hell"</PRE>
<P>It is also a member of that dubious class known as Films With Many 
Names (also known as Films That Are Not Very Good), scuttling around 
like an international master criminal under various nom-de-plumes:</P>
<PRE>        * "Snow White in the Black Forest"
        * "Snow White: A Tale of Terror"
        * "Innocent Blood"</PRE>
<P>which evokes images of sequel films like "What Snow White Did Next" 
and "Snow White From Navarone".  This schizophrenic identity is 
indicative of a picture that would like to reinvent an old myth, but 
instead just slaps on a fresh coat of paint and sticks a huge 
extension out the back.  It's not exactly a bad film, but one that is 
not as brave as it needed to be.</P>
<P>We commence the film with a tragic carriage accident somewhere in the 
faux Middle Ages.  Lord Friedrich Hoffman (Sam Neill, no - really) is 
distraught at losing his beautiful wife and vows he will not show any 
facial expressions until he can remarry and advance the plot.  But at 
least he still has his daughter, the utterly resistible Lilli (Taryn 
Davis).  You see, she is named after her unfortunate mother.  Holy 
Freudian overtones, Batman!</P>
<P>Sure 'nuff, after some years Lilli is replaced by another actor (the 
even more resistible Monica Keena) and the Lord Friedrich announces he 
will get married to the mysterious Claudia (Sigourney Weaver).  With 
la Sigourney flouncing around the castle, complete with malevolent 
mute manservant and a wardrobe that occasionally blinds the cleaning 
staff, things start to get interesting at last.  La Sigourney wants to 
have a child with Friedrich (which is one method of determining 
whether he's alive or not, I guess) and Lilli pouts a lot.  Finally, 
one of Lilli's tantrums causes her step-mother to miscarry.  La 
Sigourney cranks the acting dial up to "11" and storms dishevelled 
around the castle, wielding her manservant liberally and talking to 
the mirror in her wardrobe.  (The mirror's reflection incidentally, 
does a nice fuzzy lens effect that William Shatner would be proud of.)  
She tries to resurrect her dead baby, casts a sleeping spell on the 
castle (inadvertently resolving the issue of whether Sam Neill is 
conscious or not) and casts Lilli out into the deep woods, distracting 
her would-be beau, the wholly unremarkable Dr Peter Gutenberg (David 
Conrad, in a career-stalling appearance).</P>
<P>It is about here that the film's inventions start getting problematic.  
In the earlier scenes, Claudia is sympathetically drawn as a 
stepmother that is trying hard with a new and uncooperative daughter.  
Then the daughter's actions cause her to derail, drool wildly and 
start dabbling in the dark arts.  As in "Bram Stoker's Dracula", we 
are left with the perplexing issue of whether our villain is a damned 
vile creature, or just someone with a few issues to resolve.  
("Tonight on Oprah - Satan, Master of All Evil or Just 
Misunderstood?")  Either way, it seems clear the actions of the bratty 
Lilli has pushed her onto this path, which allows no happy nor 
satisfying conclusion.</P>
<P>(Also problematic is the mirror charming Claudia with talk of how 
beautiful she is, and then presenting the shocking news that there is 
one more beautiful than her - Lilli.  I mean: Hello?  We're talking 
about Sigourney Weaver here?  The mirror doesn't have to like to her!  
And you're comparing her unfavourably to the whiny, pasty Lilli?)</P>
<P>In the forest, Lilli encounters not the Seven Dwarfs but the Six 
Impoverished and Politically Disenfranchised Homeboys.  One of them is 
actually short, but if you were a Freudian you might think that their 
lack of power and - hence - metaphorical economic and civil 
emasculation, make them "dwarfs" in a political sense.  (No, that 
didn't fly for me either.)  The Six (And Shortly To Be Five then Four) 
Homeboys fight over whether they should kill, ransom or protect Lilli.  
And it doesn't matter how many times you watch the film, they always 
make the wrong decision.</P>
<P>Needless to say, Lilli with the help of her homies eventually caps her 
evil but well-intentioned stepmother, La Sigourney chewing scenery all 
the way.  Lilli's boyfriend shows back up again and - alas - Sam Neill is 
revived and rescued, which means that "Event Horizon" will get made.  
Darn.</P>
<P>Once again, not a bad film (but who can tell after "Starship 
Troopers"?)  and more one that speaks of a horrible design by 
committee, where no one vision is allowed to dominate and the film ends 
up going several directions at once.  Sigourney is as always good even 
in bad roles, Neill continues to snooze his career away, and we have 
an elegant proof that you don't have to be European to make bad 
arthouse films.  [*/misfire], casual inelegance on the Sid and Nancy 
scale.</P>
