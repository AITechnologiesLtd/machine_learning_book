<P>After the incredible and unexpected success of "Shakespeare in Love", the
audience has again opened their eyes for Shakespeare. Michael Hoffman is one
of many that dived into the ocean of Shakespeare's poetry during the last
decade.</P>
<P>"A Midsummer Night's Dream" has been adapted to the big screen several
times, with no particular luck. It can be a dark nightmare, a slapstick
comedy, or a semi-serious melodrama, depending on the script adaptation.
Hoffman has chosen the most common and easiest way - light comedy. The
director creates an enchanting atmosphere, as he brings to the foreground of
the story beauty and elegance - a magical recipe for the recreation of a
timeless story that is as relevant today as it was when Shakespeare wrote
it.</P>
<P>Hoffman didn't move too far away from Shakespeare's original play: Egeus,
father to Hermia, has betrothed his daughter to Demetrius, a man who in turn
loves her with all his heart, and is determined not to let Hermia's true
love, Lysander, from inheriting his bride. Then Hermia and Lysander plot to
run away together to avoid this marriage, and even possible death. They
share their plot with Helena, a close friend, who unfolds on-stage her own
attraction to Demetrius. She then storms out to inform him of what Hermia
and Lysander are doing, which will benefit Helena later, as she suspects
that her decision to reveal this plan to Demetrius will show him how much
she loves him. The parallel story unfolds in the forest nearby, where magic
transforms the grounds into an enchanted parallel world. Here we meet the
fairies. Oberon (Rupert Everett) and Titania (Michele Pfeiffer ) are king
and queen of this charming race, but that does not prevent them from feuding
over an Indian boy Titania cares for. Returning home and falling asleep,
Oberon discusses a plot with his servant, Puck, to apply a nectar from a
forest flower to his queen's eyes so that, when she awakes, she shall fall
in love with the first ugly creature that catches her eye. Continuing with
this plan, the king hears the accounts of the four lovers as they become
separated from each other in the forest. He furthers his orders to Puck, who
is instructed to apply this nectar to Demetrius, so that he can fall in love
with Helena, and all will be solved. But the plan is distracted when Puck
gets the men confused, and applies the nectar to Lysander's eyes. He then
exits the scene, and Lysander, as you probably know, falls in love with
Helena at first sight. Before the dawn all of Puck's mistakes have been
corrected, the magic is gone, the madness ends and the right lovers fall in
love with the people they are supposed to.</P>
<P>With his 1996 production of "Hamlet", Kenneth Branagh showed that it is
possible to conceive a brilliant adaptation of the full text, but the result
will have a long running time, which would be unfortunate for a film like "A
Midsummer Night's Dream". Hoffman has chosen a more traditional approach of
snipping speeches by removing "extraneous" material. He is less successful.
Because of the minor problems in the script and unusually rare and difficult
language the acting feels at times cold and removed, as if the actors
themselves didn't quite understand the lines they are pronouncing. Christian
Bale is pale, Calista Flockheart and Anna Friel are acceptable and Dominic
West is at times interesting. But it is only Kevin Cline, Stanley Tucci and
Michelle Pfieffer that feel confortable in their roles and really give
extraordinary performances.
Hoffman's magical picture relies more on performances and atmosphere than on
special effects and depth of story. There are no computerized creatures and
characters, which is a nice break from Lucas and Besson. The technically
simple, but incredibly effective art/set direction dazzle the viewer with
golden sparks and fairies, shining in the air like gems, and silver
moonlight shining upon our lovers. Makeup and costume design are spectacular
in creating a variety of odd denizens, including a rather frightening- looki
ng medusa and a few alien-looking creatures. The movie captures the delicate
beauty of this Shakespearean comedy. In a magical fantasy setting like this,
lines as "The course of true love never did run smooth" and  "Lord, what
fools these mortals be" work exceptionally well.</P>
<P>The director changed setting from 16th century Greece to Tuscany in the late
1800s. The bicycle – a relatively new invention at the time – becomes a key
prop, allowing characters to pedal after each other instead of chasing
around on foot. It also provides one of the movie's most amusing sight gags.
But he is careful, this is not "Romeo + Julia". The modernizations aren't
too modern, and his changes to the original story are minor and almost
unnoticeable.</P>
<P>We have had many spectacular adaptations of Shakespeare's undying
masterpieces. And it is a tuff task to compare with them. Michael Hoffman's
new feature doesn't capture the depth and grandness of Kenneth Brannagh's
"Hamlet", nor does it possess the power and originality of Richard
Loncrane's "Richard III" . But its magical beauty and appealing plot make it
good enough to stand in such exceptional company.<HR>----------------------------------------------</P>
