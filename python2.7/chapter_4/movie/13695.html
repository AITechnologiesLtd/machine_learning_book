SUPER FEATURES:  Off beat deadly black comedy.</PRE>
<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>It's nice to see American directors come back to the old fashioned black
comedies and their off beat styles. FARGO is, aside from the deadly  serious
story line, one of those. But it becomes a black comedy by virtue of its
characters and their naivete, or should one say, on  occasion, their own
stupidity. At the bottom of all this, is the human
fallacy, that no one can see anything we do at all, and that we will  get
away with it all, even if something goes wrong.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the film states that this is a true story, which might have
made the film that much more entertaining. The real story is that the film
is NOT entertaining and that these characters are real people with real
reactions, and over reactions. And, in between, is a half baked attempt at
making fun of the life and times in the Midwest, with its naivete and over
abundance of expressions and vernacular.</P>
<P>The story is basic enough. A man who has grand designs for financial gains,
trying to do what others with the capital do -- harmless enough, hires two
bums to kidnap his wife and set up a ransom situation, where upon he  would
split the money with the bums so that he would be able to go ahead on a deal
that he has his eyes on. So far so good. But the two bums that he hires are
an odd couple. One is vicious and the other is apparently a bit retarded, or
at least not all there. And in the process of doing their job, they get
stopped by the highway patrol. The vicious guy loses his  temper and kills
the trooper and then decides to go after a passer by that drove by during
the moment they were disposing of the trooper's body.... and on, and on.</P>
<P>Amidst all this is a police chief, Marge, who is pregnant, but seems to
have a pretty good handle on things, and a fairly controlled demeanor. She
and her husband look like the all American average Joe and Mary, boring as
heck, they probably go to the Twins games once a month, etc, etc. She is a
character. She has brains, in a place where other troopers do not seem to
have much of an eye for detail and attention. She decides to follow up the
case, and it kicks back to the man who has the grand designs. The getaway
car, seems to have a dealer's plate, and this seems to be the  only
dealership in town. The fact that his wife is also missing, is also  a
curious point to her. They couldn't be connected could they?</P>
<P>Eventually, the two bums kinda get out of hand, and the kidnapped wife
manages an escape. By that time, the police chief has done all her homework
and is already after the bums and the man with the big plans. End of story,
and film.</P>
<P>But in between, the whole thing is crazy, and off key, with the largest
array of off beat characters this side of FREAKS. And they all have an
expression, and they all talk funny, and they all say the darndest things,
right down to the two young gals that were picking up a couple of extra
bucks for their movies and fun. Unfortunately, the information they  provide
to the chief is really useless, but the moment is a treat.</P>
<P>Making serious films is one thing. Making fun films is another. But making a
funny serious film, is yet another one, and Joel Coen, has done a very nice
job on this one, right from the start. But, darn, the whole thing is really
depressing. But funny.</P>
<P>There is no doubt that Frances McDormand is very good in this role as the
police chief, and probably well of her Oscar... I did not see all the other
winners. But this one was good, in a role that is very difficult to balance.
One inch that way, the film becomes a total satire, and the story loses it.
One inch the other way, the story becomes another murder mistery and the fun
part of the film becomes annoying and distracting to us, as it may have been
for the police chief. In the balance lies the great piece of work in this
film.</P>
<P>Nice film to see, although not exactly enjoyable. Not recommended to be seen
before bedtime, that's for sure...</P>
