<PRE>                                  L. A. STORY
                       A film review by Jim Pellmann
                        Copyright 1991 Jim Pellmann</PRE>
<P>     This one took me by surprise: none of the ads, clips, or reviews I
saw prepared me for this good a movie.  It's an intelligent, funny
romantic comedy, using Los Angeles as a surreal backdrop.</P>
<P>     Written by and starring Steve Martin, it's the story of a "wiggy,
wacky TV weatherman" who gets dumped by his status-conscious girlfriend
(Marilu Henner),  has a brief affair with a frenetic valley girl named
SanDeE* (no, that's not my terminal acting up), and ultimately pursues a
British journalist (played by Martin's real life wife, Victoria
Tennant).</P>
<P>     But this is L.A. and the city is as much a character in this story
as anyone else.  Indeed, a central "character" is a freeway road
conditions sign that magically communicates with Martin and helps him in
his romantic quests.  One reviewer compared this movie's fairy tale
aspects to those of ALICE, but with a lighter touch.</P>
<P>     As is expected from Martin, L.A. is the butt of a continual string
of jokes and the film is filled with jabs at the people and lifestyles
of southern California.  Some are mildly amusing: Martin driving over
sidewalks and neighbors' lawns, and down steep staircases to avoid
traffic jams; power lunchers' blase ignorance of an earthquake.  Others
are wickedly hilarious: the TV station's ever-changing news show format;
Martin's attempts to obtain a reservation at the city's hottest new
restaurant, L'Idiot, where potential customers must submit complete
financial records, and diners are offered designer dental floss between
courses.  Two days later, I'm still finding myself chuckling over some
scenes.</P>
<P>     This is the type of California bashing the rest of the country
loves to see.  But in this case it is all tempered by gorgeous scenes of
the tropical, the bright, the successful side of L.A. life.  Martin may
complain of living in an "intellectual-free zone", but everybody is
enjoying it, and we do too.  There are many visually stunning scenes and
liberal use of time-lapse photography.  The mood is capped by lush
musical interludes from new-age artist Enya.</P>
<P>     With so much going on, you have to look fast.  You'll easily miss
some of the visual humor if you don't pay close attention.  There are
also literally dozens of uncredited cameo appearances by well-known
movie and TV personalities.  Rick Moranis shows up as a
Shakespeare-quoting gravedigger, Chevy Chase as a restaurant patron
whose financial failings relegate him to a table in the back, and
Patrick Stewart (Capt. Picard on the new "Star Trek") as the owner of
L'Idiot.</P>
<P>     While all the performances are on target, it's Steve Martin's
writing that impressed me the most.  All in all, thoroughly enjoyable
and highly recommended.</P>
