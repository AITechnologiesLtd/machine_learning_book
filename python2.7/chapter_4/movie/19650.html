<P>The shadow of "Shakespeare In Love" looms over John Turturro'
sophomore directorial effort, "Illuminata". However, the latter film
has an ingenuity and flavor all its own. Turturro stars as Tuccio, a
struggling playwright in turn-of-the-century New York. Tuccio wants to
stage his controversial new play, "Illuminata", but many are convinced
that the work isn't yet finished. However, using his lover,
Rachel(Katherine Borowitz) as his muse, he crafts a work about
imperfect love. Among Turturro's eclectic cast is Susan Sarandon as an
aging actress and Christopher Walken(in the film's breakaway
performance) as a powerful, cynical theater critic. "Illuminata" moves
at a slow pace, and is not as lighthearted or flamboyant as
"Shakespeare In Love", but it is a fine film nonetheless. John
Turturro, having worked with visionaries such as the Coen brothers,
Spike Lee, Martin Scorsese, Robert Redford and John Dahl, knows how to
make a film, and it is evident that he knows how to work with
actors. No performance here is too overdone, and everyone seems to be
having a lot of fun.</P>
