<PRE>Scream 3 </PRE>
<P>The "Scream" series comes to a close (hopefully) with this installment not 
really starring Neve Campbell.
Courtney Cox and David Arquette are the real stars here as the story takes 
them to Hollywood where a
killer is dressed up in that same black costume murdering people, only this 
time he follows a movie script. </P>
<P>The premise offers a lot of possibilities but the execution of the story is 
mediocre. What's supposed to be
funny and satirical is only good for the occasional gaffaw but not too many 
belly laughs or sly zingers the
original "Scream" offered. In fact it's not really accurate to classify this 
film as a horror, there's really
nothing scary about it. It's more of a lame action/thriller since there 
doesn't seem to be anything remotely
supernatural. </P>
<P>Teenyboppers will love it, but the rest of us will just have to accept the 
fact this franchise ran out of steam
fast. </P>
