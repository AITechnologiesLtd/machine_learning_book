Alien Resurrection (aka Alien 4)
--------------------------------
Starring Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder
Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet</P>
<P>In resurrecting the character of Ellen Ripley (Sigorney Weaver), lead
character of the Alien-series, the writers of Alien Resurrection fully
intend to have their cake and eat it. Presumably thinking that, since
audiences will have to suspend their disbelief anyway to allow them to
bring back the deceased heroine, they should also be able to swallow that
the Ripley clone is, for all plot-purposes, in the same state as she was in
before she died: not only still pregnant with an alien queen but also, with
help of the shared hive-mind of the alien DNA that she carries inside her
she also has most of her pre-death memories (s-t-r-e-t-c-h) .</P>
<P>Scietists of an organization that is in actuality The Company from the
previous installments in all but name (to make it believable that the film
takes place 200 years after the third episode, you'll understand the
writers at least had to change a few tags) have succeeded, on board of
their huge space-lab (that despite its enormous size employs only 49
people) not only in creating a clone of Ripley, but more importantly, in
getting ahold of that alien queen that has eluded their equally evil
predecessors for so many decades. Living, human cryo-stored host bodies are
smuggled in, unscrupulously impregnated by the "face hugging" aliens that
emerge from the queen's eggs, and soon enough, a dozen of fully-grown
creatures are ready for action. Needless to say, the monsters escape their
cages, and once again Ripley, this time accompanied by the motley crew of
smugglers that unsuspectingly delivered the host bodies to the scientists,
can clean up the mess.</P>
<P>The first Alien film was an undisputed classic, the second a spectacular
and tremendously enjoyable film, one of the few sequels that approach the
original's quality, even surpassing it in some areas. So after the bleak,
empty failure that was the third installment, 20th Century Fox had a lot
riding on Alien Resurrection: it  had to work, or the once mighty franchise
was as good as dead. Fortunatly, the filmmakers, headed up by director
Jean-Pierre Jeunet (City of the Lost Children) made this important
installment with a keen eye for what went wrong in the third one. And to
give credit where credit's due, they do manage to fix most of the problems
that plaqued its predecessor. Unfortunatly, they forget to do much else.</P>
<P>Perhaps Alien3's most destructive failure was that its human characters
were so incredibly dull and uninteresting that no-one could be bothered to
tell them apart, let alone care whether or not they lived or died. In Alien
4, this problem is corrected, but unfortunatly it is done with so much zeal
that the heroes of Alien Resurrection are the other end of a very large
scale: every single character now has a gimmick, a trick, a neat twist, and
as such they seem too "assembled"; more like the pixellated champions of a
computer game like Street Fighter II than the champions of an installment
of a classic movie-series. Granted, they may have bags of
instant-character, but they are seriously shallow as well: the robotic
mechanic Call (an adequate Winona Ryder), for example, can't hold a candle
to female characters from Alien and Aliens in terms of depth and ability to
hold audience interest. Nevertheless, characterization remains undeniably
an improvement over Alien3. Certainly, Ripley's character remains
interesting; Alien DNA now mixed with her own, she has animal instincts and
even more of an attitude than usual. The lead scientist (a good turn by
genre-actor Brad Dourif) says it best when he refers to her as "something
of a predator" and Weaver certainly plays her 'new' role adequately. </P>
<P>But rather than focusing on what went wrong in part 3 and fixing that, it
would have been nice if the filmmakers would have looked at what went right
in parts 1 and 2 and had expanded on that. The first two films were filled
with original, exciting action-and suspense sequences. Alien Resurrection
has only one that's comparable to the best of those: a beautiful
underwater-chase and subsequent sweaty-palmed ladder-encounter. And even
that scene has a disappointing climax, with one of the Street Fighters
falling a few feet down into the water but, inexplicably, never
resurfacing. Oh, and in the meantime, Ripley is also briefly attacked by an
impregnating "face hugger" alien -- possibly a nice lead-in for episode
number five.</P>
<P>Other scenes that, while not classic, are not at all bad include a short
sequence in which the cryo-stored human hosts are impregnated under
authorization of the very evil scientists, the evacuation of the station
when the alien menace first breaks loose, and a sequence near the end in
which the (otherwise decidedly lacklustre) villain scientist is killed by
an impregnated surviving host that's about to "chest-burst". Other than
these, the film seriously lacks in the all-important department of great
action: it has a few other contrived sequences but nothing particularly
memorable. The aliens themselves aren't particularly threatening,
strenuously holding back whenever the script needs them to, and since it
needs them to so very often, they loose almost all of their punch -- for a
lesson in How To, Jeunet could have looked not only to the originals, but
also to Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park, in which the velociraptors were
consistantly threatening, and the film therefore consistently suspenseful
(how embarrasing that an Alien film would be outclassed by a PG-rated
Spielberg outing in terms of sheer horror). And I won't give away the
climax of Alien 4, not merely because I don't want to spoil it for those
who are yet to see the film, but rather because it's so ridiculous in every
fashion that it's just not worth talking about.</P>
<P>There *are* some interesting scenes in Alien 4, but they are mostly the
non-exciting ones. The scenes showing  learning process of both the aliens
and Ripley (yes, she *has* forgotten a few trivial things that she needs to
re-learn -- like language) are well done, as is an intriguing (albeit
somewhat oddly inserted) encounter between Ripley and her clone 'sisters':
apparently, the new Ripley was the eighth attempt at a clone, and the ones
among the first seven failures that we get to see are decidedly
Geiger-esque (despite him having little to do with their design) and look
horrifyingly great (production design is high overall: the huge lab-ship is
impressive, the sleek smuggler's ship has a lovely japanimation-look).
Another scene, in which Ripley shows that she can now play a mean game of
basketball, goes a long way in establishing not only her 'new' character,
but also that of her fellow street fighters. All these scenes can't
conceal, though, that the plot is incredibly thin, despite attempts at a a
'different', more artistic Alien film, with 'kinky' moments and a
ham-handed underlying mommy-and-child theme. </P>
<P>All in all, it sounds pretty terrible, doesn't it? Then let's sum up the
strengths again: nice new characters which are well acted (Ron Perlman's
tough guy Johner being my personal favorite, with Micheal Wincott -- as
smuggler leader Eldyn -- also managing to impress in his short time on
screen), some beautiful design (obviously, a lot of money was spent here),
and a handful of pretty good scenes. Other than that, though, Alien 4 is an
enjoyable but decidedly unspectacular and very shallow alien-battle romp,
scarcely better than the far less pretensious (if more clichéd) Alien
rip-off  'The Relic' of yesteryear.  As such, it's much more entertaining
than the third one, and certainly worth seeing for the starving fans of the
sci-fi horror genre, but it is ultimately nothing more than a B-movie in
fancy big budget clothing, and as such does the fans of the series few
favors. </P>
<P>Ripley may have her full memory back, she's nevertheless appearing in a
very forgetable film -- a film that's not bad in its own right, but in not
exceeding mediocrity still fails to bring the series back on track. Yes,
Fox can rest assured that Alien Resurrection doesn't immediatly kill the
weakened franchise like another bad Alien film would have, but surely that
franchise must now be considered to be living on borrowed time. One more
outing like this and it's dead beyond resurrection.</P>
