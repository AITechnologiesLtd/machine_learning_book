<PRE>                           An AYNTK Review
                             Bill Clark</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: Blows Goats</PRE>
<PRE>Speed 2: Cruise Control, has it all:</PRE>
<PRE>        Spunky Deaf Kids
        Really Slow Elevators
        Wooden Fire Doors</PRE>
<P>Crazy guy wants money AND revenge, (hey, it's the '90s; you CAN have it
all).  Decides to rip-off diamonds from a floating jewel show on a
cruise ship.  Hapless, unengaging but spunky characters are put at
risk.  Lame performances.  Crappy effects.
A poor knowledge of physics (watch the oil tanker explode like an atomic
bomb!)</P>
<P>This is the kind of movie that Chuck Norris would have made 15 years
ago, except there would be two dozen bad guys and plenty more
excitement.  </P>
<P>The leads are bad, but the supporting characters are worse.  You will
find yourself not caring what becomes of them.  If you absolutely must
see a movie with bad actors having misadventures on an ill-fated ship,
rent "The Posidieon Adventure."  At least the boat is upside down in
that one.</P>
<P><HR>The AYNTK (All You Need To Know) Review Series is dedicated to providing
the 
movie patron with a brief, completely biased assesment of whether or not 
current theatrical releases in Singapore are a total rip-off.  Recent
video releases may also be reviewed.</P>
