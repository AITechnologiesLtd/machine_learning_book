<P>I don't mind being confused by a movie.  Every once in a while, it's
fun to watch a confounding film and be forced to put the pieces together
at the end.  It's not fun, however, when the pieces don't fit together,
or when there simply aren't enough pieces.   Writer/director Todd
Haynes' Velvet Goldmine is a good example of a confusing movie that
doesn't give the viewer enough information to understand it completely. 
Perhaps I should see the film again -- there is a very good chance that
I missed something.</P>
<P>But it's not likely that I missed half the movie, even though I kind of
feel like I did.  Haynes' film, which partially revolves around a
British Glam rock star in the mid-70s, does a lot of things right --
mostly in production design and music -- but it's a hollow movie with no
emotional center, and almost no coherence whatsoever.  It's filled with
eclectic flashbacks and elaborate dream sequences, all of which begin
and end without the viewer knowing.   There's also very little dialogue,
and huge interludes of music without any speaking.  I'm sure someone
could make a case for this approach; it seems to me that Haynes was more
interested in capturing the look and feel of the Glam rock era rather
than telling a straightforward story about it.  The problem is that he
didn't give me a reason to care.</P>
<P>The film begins with a truly bizarre prologue, implying that Oscar
Wilde was a gift from aliens.  It then cuts to 1974, the year in which
Glam rock king Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) fakes his own
assassination during one of his concerts.  In the audience stands Arthur
Stuart (Christian Bale), a big fan of Slade.   Ten years later, Arthur
is a journalist who is sent to find out what really happened to Brian
Slade.  He interviews many people, including Slade's wife, Mandy (Toni
Collette), former lover, Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), and first manager
(Michael Feast).  Later, we learn that Slade was a major influence on
Arthur's life.</P>
<P>When the film was over, I felt like I had been sitting for days.   The
film isn't boring, but it's a chore to sit through because it's so
confusing.   You're always trying to figure out what time period your
in, or what characters you're supposed to be watching, or if the scene
is a dream sequence.  I think there's a way to evoke the Glam rock era
without perplexing viewers; I wish Haynes had tried to figure out how. 
I've got to give him credit, though:  the movie is visually and aurally
immersive.  The sets art big and colorful, the music is very loud, and
it's hard to pull your eyes away from the screen.  Haynes (whose last
feature, Safe, is far more subdued than this) has a good sense of mood,
but fails to tell a compelling story about real people.  And, as I said,
I'm pretty sure he meant to take this approach.   </P>
<P>It's not that there aren't any characters -- in fact, some of them are
interesting.   Rhys-Meyers is perfect as Slade, the effeminate rocker
whose face is barely visible through the makeup.  The main problem with
Slade as a character is that he's just a symbol in the film, and Haynes
never makes him into a believable human being.   McGregor is good, but
his psychotic character is not very pleasant.  Collette has a nice role,
but she's on hand mostly has a plot device.  The only actor who rises
above the material is Bale, but even Arthur's connection with Slade --
which is where the emotional grounding is supposed to come from -- isn't
well-developed.  None of this is helped by the fact that the characters
really don't talk to each other -- what little dialogue there is falls
prey to the stupefying visuals, and so the story can't emerge from the
rubble.</P>
<P>And so what we're left with is a flashy, vapid movie that makes no
sense.  Velvet Goldmine is an interesting film to a degree -- Haynes'
visual presentation is enough to keep anyone watching.  It's just that,
with iconic characters and an incoherent narrative, the film fails to
draw in its audience.  I don't think Velvet Goldmine needed to be a
mess, even though Haynes clearly wanted it messy.  It wouldn't have
taken much to straighten this film out -- get rid of the framing device,
make the flashbacks more obvious, and maybe add a little dialogue.   I
have no moral problem with a confusing film like this, but Haynes should
have given us enough information to figure it out.  </P>
