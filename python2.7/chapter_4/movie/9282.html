<PRE>Tim Burton is one of a kind.</PRE>
<P>Over and over again he takes bizzare premises and makes blockbusters. </P>
<P>Beetlejuice isn't a perfect movie--but it's an entertaining one. It's
uneven and poorly maintained and badly edited and the main character (
Beetlejuice played by Michael Keaton ) should have been completely rooted
out. I love this movie. It's offbeat, but so is all his work. And it has a
genuine sense of wit. </P>
<P>Here's the movie's outline: Two young lovers who have just been married
move into a house. In these first moments there's a lovely little sense of
whimsy and magic. One day they go to town to pick up some groceries. As
they're riding back they ram into the side of a bridge. Their car is
balanced over the side of a river courtesy of a plank of wood. There's a
dog on the other side, holding them up. Then he hops off and - boom!  -
down they go. Yep, they're dead in an instant and they don't know it.</P>
<P>I don't want to go into detail but this is a marvelous comedy about the
afterlife--a good rental for when you're feeling bizzare.</P>
