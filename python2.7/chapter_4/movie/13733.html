<P>It's a dismal day on the northwestern coast of France: the skies are
heavily overcast, the seas are choppy, the winds are high. At the Dog
Green sector of Omaha Beach, things are particularly gruesome: tens of
thousands of American infantrymen push relentlessly toward the sand in
troop transports. Then the army of boats land, and the ramps drop, and
there's a split second where everyone gets their first look at France.
Then the German gunners fill the air with rifle fire and troops are cut
down by the hundreds - some before taking their first step. Others are
killed on the beaches, or in the water, but eventually - if only by
sheer numbers - the Allied invasion force at Normandy wins the day and
gets a small foothold in Nazi France. </P>
<P>Such is the opening scene in Steven Spielberg's latest epic masterpiece,
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, a scene which some thought might have earned the
movie an NC-17 classification if the movie had been directed by any
other man. Such claims are not far off base, in the sense that Spielberg
incorporates an awesomely stunning amount of realism into his latest
product. The intense violence, largely concentrated to the first twenty
or thirty minutes, is a no-holds-barred look at the Great War. Men die
explicitly and and in utter chaos. At first glance, it would be easy to
earmark such a crass depiction as nothing but gratuitous violence. But
after only moments of viewing, Spielberg does the near-impossible. He
puts every member of the audience there at Dog Green on June 6, 1944. </P>
<P>Even after the opening-scene slaughter, everything remains authentic.
Mid-forties jargon, olive green uniforms, bulky grey helmets, original
automatic weapons, and more are all replicated in stunning detail and
attention to realism. On those terms, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is to World
War II what TITANIC was to its namesake oceanliner. If there's anything
about the movie that Spielberg does the most, it's in creating an
authentic, believable, and complete atmosphere for the story. Tramping
around the French countryside night and day, everyone watching is in a
complete sense of awe at the time travel they have just undergone. This
benchmark statement of set and production design is accented and
furthered by the acting corps. </P>
<P>Tom Hanks (THAT THING YOU DO!), Tom Sizemore (THE RELIC), and Ed Burns
(SHE'S THE ONE) are the lead players in a squad of US Army Rangers with
the mission of locating Private James Ryan. Ryan has three brothers, all
of whom have already been killed, and the War Department, fearing a
scandal, gives Captain Miller (Hanks) and his team the job of finding
the remaining Ryan. Each and every member of the team is believable and
solid in nature, as the joke, laugh, cry, and suffer through war and its
facilities. Hanks is not outstanding but is wonderful as ever, exuding
an aura that only comes from a man who has two successive Best Actor
nominations. His lead is essential in this movie, and contributes
greatly to making SAVING PRIVATE RYAN Spielberg's finest film since
SCHINDLER'S LIST. In comparison to his last feature, AMISTAD, Spielberg
exchanges a more colorful set for a more action-filled script; this
works out for the better with a 170-minute running time. All-in-all, the
definitive must-see feature of the summer, and possibly the year.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN": 4.0 stars - an excellent movie.</P>
