<PRE>                                PAPERHOUSE
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1990)</PRE>
<P>        PAPERHOUSE is probably one of those movies you've never heard of,
which is a shame because it's a gem.  The film was released in 1989 to a
handful of rave reviews, but it failed to find an audience and quickly
disappeared from the theaters.  It is now available on videocassette.  I
rented it expecting a solid little thriller; I did not expect to be swept
away--to be deeply moved, disturbed, and frightened.  PAPERHOUSE was,
without question, one of 1989's most striking and haunting films.  I'm
kicking myself for having missed the movie in the theater where it would
have had even greater visual and emotional impact.</P>
<P>        The movie (based on the novel MARIANNE DREAMS by Catherine Storr)
revolves around Anna, a precocious 11-year old played by Charlotte Burke.
Anna is a bratty troublemaker, miserable to everyone around her.  She gives
her teacher hell, she lies, and she is crabby to her mother (Glenne
Headly).  Then again, Anna has good reason to be bitter: she doesn't get
enough attention from her working mother and her father is never around
because his job keeps him away from home.</P>
<P>        PAPERHOUSE begins on Anna's eleventh birthday, and it's not a good
one.  First she gets detention at school, and then she comes down with a
glandular illness and starts running a fever and having fainting spells.
Happy birthday!  Anna's doctor orders her to stay in bed for at least a
week, a fate worth than death for a hyperactive eleven-year-old.  Anna
fills the time by drawing pictures.  In particular, she creates a drawing
of a house in a field with a boy looking out the second story window.
Then, a strange thing happens: every time Anna sleeps or faints, she has
vivid dreams of the house and boy in her drawing.  Anna soon discovers that
any change she makes to the drawing creates a corresponding change in her
dream world.</P>
<P>        In her dreams, Anna befriends Marc, the boy in the window, who
turns out to be paralyzed from the waist down.  The movie really plunges
into the twilight zone when Anna discovers that her doctor has a patient
named Marc who suffers from cerebral palsy; he is paralyzed from the waist
down!  In short, Anna knows Marc from her dreams despite having never met
him in her waking life.  The film is an eerie love story between a boy and
a girl who know each other only in their dreams.</P>
<P>        PAPERHOUSE is much more sophisticated and provocative than any of
the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET films.  Director Bernard Rose and screenwriter
Matthew Jacobs realize that the most frightening horror lies not in special
effects but in the subconscious mind.  PAPERHOUSE dives into Anna's psyche,
exploring, among other things, her resentment toward her father and her
budding sexuality.  But at the same time, the character of Marc (Elliott
Spiers) gives the film a supernatural twist.  Marc, like Anna, exists in
both the dream world and the real world, which suggests that there is some
sort of weird psychic connection between the two, even though they have
never met.  The filmmakers wisely leave the fantastical elements of the
movie unexplained.  PAPERHOUSE walks a delicate line between psychological
drama and supernatural horror.  The ending, which easily could have ruined
the movie, is strangely satisfying: on one hand, it answers all of our
questions--on the other hand, it answers none of them.</P>
<P>        Three key ingredients make the movie effective.  First and
foremost, there is Burke's extraordinary performance as Anna.  Although
Spiers (as Marc) and Headly (as Anna's mother) are outstanding, PAPERHOUSE
is really Burke's show.  Her acting is invisible, or seamless.  That is, we
are never conscious of a performance; all we see is a fully realized
character.  Second, there is the stunning production design which brings
Anna's dream world to life.  The dream house is dark, dank, and depressing.
A sense of dread lurks in the air, and it makes you want to flee.  Third,
there is the flawless direction by Rose, whose experience as a music video
director evidently prepared him well for the visual challenge of making
PAPERHOUSE, his directorial debut.</P>
<P>        PAPERHOUSE is hard to shake once it catches you in its grip.  It is
a truly imaginative creation, and it just may be the scariest film since
THE LADY IN WHITE, which is another overlooked treasure also available on
home video.</P>
