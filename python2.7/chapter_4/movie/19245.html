<P>   If you're going away this summer, you'll probably be
sending the folks back home those picture post cards to
make them jealous: "Wish you were here," or some other
original quip.  Everybody has a great time on vacation. 
Never mind that the family's all together 24 hours a day
under stressful conditions--foreign languages, strange
customs, exhausting voyages and tours.  Trekkers come
home and what do they tell you?  We had a great great
time...fabulous!  Do you believe them?</P>
<P>   Take the trio of twenty-somethings that drive to the
arboreal acres of Maryland in Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel
Myrick's fresh, imaginative feature.  These kids have a
purpose, and it isn't to ski, get a tan, play golf, swim, or
some other bourgeois design.  Like many their age, they
considere themselves amateur filmmakers, loading up with
both 16mm film and a High-8 video job intent on making a
full-sized, prizewinning documentary to confirm or lay
doubt on rumors of a witch in the woods.  The three who
journey on October 21, 1994 are Joshua Leonard, who
shoots the 16mm film; Michael Williams, who captures the
sound; and the group's leader, a Tracy-Flick-like Heather
Donahue who took charge and kept the respect of the two
males--for a while.  Just one thing, though.  "The Blair Witch
Project" is not a documentary, not a docudrama, but a
mockumentary, or mock documentary designed to give the
audience the distinct impression that what they are watching
really did happen.</P>
<P>   The group hike into the Black Forest region of Maryland,
near the town of Burkittsville, to search out an old legend that
the region was inhabited by the wicked Blair Witch--who
allegedly tortured and killed trespassers from time
to time since February 1785.  Though an entire town is
cursed by this outcast, Burkittsville is founded on the site of
this witch, notwithstanding the fate of a 10-year old girl who is
dragged to her death by a pale woman's hand--as seen by
eleven witnesses.</P>
<P>   What made "The Blair Witch Project" captivating to
some, so much that when its screening was announced at a
recent Sundance Festival every one of a theater's 1300 seats
filled up rapidly?  Simply this: instead of giving the three
trekkers a script to read, Myrick and Sanchez pulled a Marlon
Brando and engaged them in "method filmmaking."  The
three young performers were given quick training in camera
work and then turned loose for eight days to improvise
according to their actual predilections.   The directors planted
actors in the town for the three to interview, turning the burg
into a kind of Truman Show: the protagonists essentially are
to pretend--kind of like Truman Burbank in Peter Weir's
comedy--that they are not part of a movie at all.  They
speak with several salt-of-the-earth townspeople, most of
whom insist that they do not believe the legend of the evil
enchantress.  In the one situation that could cause the
audience to shudder, a small baby repeatedly puts her hand
across her mother's mouth to prevent the adult from telling
the scary story of the Blair Witch.</P>
<P>   The treatment given to the three (which resembles an
effective fraternity hell week) recalls the training given to the
cast of "Saving Private Ryan."  The actors playing soldiers on
the beach in the riveting opening moments of Steven
Spielberg's masterpiece had gone through such rigorous
discipline for the role that at least a half dozen repeatedly
threatened to quit.  In "Blair," Donahue, Williams and Leonard
are forced to suffer as actual people in their situation might
have done.  After a few days, they are soaked, exhausted
and hungry to such an extent that they actually feel the terror
of the journey, actually fearing for their lives.  This adds
markedly to the verisimilitude.  As the three prepare for the
trip by shopping, cracking jokes, and following Heather's
background narration, they speak to residents of the town,
drive to the woods, and proceed to hike for hours.  Without a
cell phone, they become increasingly anxious as they lose
their bearings.  When the map of the area--the only
document that could virtually guarantee their safe arrival back
to the car--disappears, panic takes over.  As Heather, the
confident tour leader, begins to lose it--screaming, crying,
cursing--the three go increasingly off the wall, their disquiet
reaching a climax when two of the party make a gruesome
and bloody discovery.</P>
<P>  "Blair," at once a road movie, a buddy drama, and a horror
show, is the sort of film that could be expected to come from
a studio like Artisan, known for willingness to experiment. 
Last year, Darren Aronofsky's "Pi," released under the Artisan
label, became the most innovative indie of the year. "Pi"
featured the nerdish Max Cohen, a mathematical genius, who
sets out to prove that everything can be reduced to a
numerical pattern.   Unfortunately, "The Blair Witch Project"
does not come close to matching "Pi." Though we may
indeed be convinced of the apprehension felt increasingly by
the three performers, we feel strangely distanced from their
dilemma.  The fault lies paradoxically with improvisation
which, for my money, almost never works.  What's needed to
get the pulse of the viewers racing is a solid script by a guy
like David Mamet or, going back a while, to a director like
James Whale. Only a tight screenplay effected by a director's
strong hand, can accomplish the indisputable goal of every
horror movie--to scare the living daylights out of everyone
willing to suspend disbelief.  Take, by contrast, the recent
movie "Limbo," which, like this one deals with people who are
stranded in a remote area, so desperate for help that they
are willing to risk their lives when an opportunity for rescue
finally comes.  "Limbo" is a near-great film--controversial
ending and all--because of the superb skills of John Sayles at
the helm.  What we have here, though, is a group of kids who
scream like banshees, uttering obscenities without a clever
piece of dialogue in the 87-minute production.  The moral?
To convey an atmosphere of anarchy, a film may need an
authoritarian hand at the controls--a tight script embodying a
real story and firm direction.  Though after viewing "Blair"
some in the audience might vow never again to travel without
a knowledgeable tour guide, I say, "Bring on the woods...The
city is hot and I have no problem tackling some sylvan
splendor."</P>
