<P>     There is a sub-category of Shakespeare's comedies referred to by
scholars as the "problem plays," and thought TWELFTH NIGHT is not
technically one of them, it is rather problematic in its own right.
Though primarily a farcical tale of confused romance, mistaken identity
and sexual politics, TWELFTH NIGHT also includes a sub-plot in which a
character is humiliated, imprisoned as a lunatic and released to vow his
revenge on his persecutors.  Trevor Nunn's adaptation of the play retains
that sub-plot, which makes the film quite faithful.  At the same time, it
is only that dark business in an otherwise bright and breezy film which
prevents TWELFTH NIGHT from being as successful at traditional Shakespeare
as WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO AND JULIET was successful at the
un-traditional.</P>
<P>     The central plot of TWELFTH NIGHT involves a woman named Viola
(Imogen Stubbs) who survives a shipwreck which apparently claims the life
of her twin brother Sebastian (Stephen Mackintosh).  Stranded in the
unfriendly nation of Illyria, Viola disguises herself as a boy named
Cesario to go into the service of the Duke Orsino (Toby Stephens).  Viola
is then given the task of wooing the beautiful Olivia (Helena Bonham
Carter) on Orsino's behalf, but not only is Olivia unreceptive to Orsino's
suit, she falls in love with the messenger she believes to be a boy.
Viola, meanwhile, has fallen for Orsino, creating a rather unique romantic
triangle.  To complicate matters further, Sebastian turns up alive,
resulting in no end of confusion.</P>
<P>     It is easy to turn TWELFTH NIGHT into a rather trivial farce, if an
entertaining one, but Nunn has opted for a surprisingly sensitive
rendering of the tale.  Imogen Stubbs is an appealing Viola whose
unrequited love is a source of both pain and frustration, and her defense
of the depth of a woman's love is given a confident strength.  Perhaps
most unconventional is Nunn's choice of making the reunion between Viola
and Sebastian the emotional climax of the film rather than the joining of
any pair of lovers, yet it works thanks to a carefully established 
prologue and the restrained work of Stubbs.  Helena Bonham Carter is
simply wonderful as Olivia -- smart, sexy, seductive and _very_ funny --
leaving a somewhat stiff Toby Stephens as the only squeaky wheel in an
otherwise smooth, clockwork romantic comedy.</P>
<P>     The more broadly comic secondary plot involves the machinations of
Olivia's drunken uncle Sir Toby Belch (Mel Smith) and her maid Maria
(Imelda Staunton) against the fussy, dour steward Malvolio (Nigel
Hawthorne of THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE).  The scheme involves persuading
Malvolio that Olivia loves him, inspiring him to uncharacteristic behavior
which eventually lands him in a madhouse, and the set-up for that scheme
presents Hawthorne with some priceless comic moments.  Hawthorne is an
actor with a remarkable range, which results in the curious case of him
pitching portions of his performance in a way which makes Malvolio too
sympathetic.  A scene in which the fool Feste (a wry, philosophical Ben
Kingsley) impersonates a cleric to further taunt the imprisoned Malvolio
should be simply amusing, but Hawthorne seems so genuinely confused and
tormented that his comeuppance seems dreadfully unfair.  When he
interrupts the revelry of the united lovers to swear his vengeance upon
those who tricked him, it truly spoils the festive mood.  It is an unusual
instance where a less accomplished actor, who might have played the role
quite broadly, might also have maintained a lighter tone.</P>
<P>     TWELFTH NIGHT may be uneven, but is still largely appealing, thanks
to the talented cast and the unique design of the film.  The locations in
Cornwall allow for some marvelous, liberating exteriors, and the late 18th
century settings and costumes allow Nunn to balance TWELFTH NIGHT on the
border between period piece and contemporary romance.  Kingsley and Smith
make particularly inspired choices for their roles, lending humor both
subtle and expansive, and Richard E. Grant is a perfect dim-witted fop as
Sir Andrew Aguecheek.  Trevor Nunn's direction is unexpectedly restrained
in small moments between Viola and Orsino given Nunn's recent history
staging massive stage productions like CATS and LES MISERABLES, but his
over 25 years as director of the Royal Shakespeare Company have not been
forgotten so easily.  TWELFTH NIGHT is a problematic play, but Nunn has
served it well, making it a revel with a dark side that can't eclipse the
bright.</P>
