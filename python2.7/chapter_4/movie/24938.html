<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Director Robert Iscove and star Freddie Prinze Jr. both appeared last year in 
the similarly themed She's All That. In that film, Prinze's jock character 
was trying to win a bet by turning an outcast into the prom queen, only to 
fall in love with her. Boys and Girls takes place in college, the next step 
after high school, but some main elements are very much the same. Luckily, 
both films retain a romantic charm that makes them work. Some would attribute 
this to popular teen romance movie star Freddie Prinze Jr. Freddie did make 
movies like Down To You and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer work, but 
Boys and Girls owes its thanks to a marvelous supporting cast. These 
characters are where the film's real comedy comes from, and it makes the 
movie seem like less of a rehash. </P>
<P>Ryan (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and Jennifer (Claire Forlani) have been running 
into each other at different points in their lives. One time they get seated 
on a plane together, another incident years later has them meeting up after a 
football game when her boyfriend runs over his mascot costume. The two are 
gawky and more than a little strange. As luck would have it, they end up 
going to the same college, where they discover the other hasn't changed a 
bit. Ryan must still have a plan for everything and is very uptight. Jennifer 
is free-spirited and still scared of commitment. Their differences turn out 
to form a friendship and they start spending a lot of time with each other. 
Their roommates Hunter (Jason Biggs) who is always trying to score with the 
ladies, and Amy (Amanda Detmer) who is always talking about or talking with 
her therapist, join the circle of friends. Jennifer's convinced her and Ryan 
are just friends, and the two date other people. Ryan's brainy, 
straightforward, and very funny girlfriend Megan (The Blair Witch Project's 
Heather Donahue) and a guitarist are among them. However, Ryan and Jennifer 
can't hold their passion in much longer. </P>
<P>All of the actors are quite charming in their roles. Freddie Prinze Jr. does 
nothing new, but Claire Forlani finally gets the lead role she's been looking 
for. Both Forlani and Detmer get a chance at laughs they didn't get with 
their last movies, and they succeed. Hunter and Megan are the real comic 
characters though. Hunter makes up so many lies about himself to women, 
hoping it will quickly lead to sex for the night. His tactics, attitude, and 
actions are never short of ridiculous. Megan only appears in a few scenes, 
but was a standout character. Heather Donahue brings her control freak 
by-the-rules Megan to life, and steals the show. My favorite part of the 
movie is when Megan first approaches Ryan and directly asks him out. As she 
says once or twice, "I'm a laser. I know what I want and I go straight for 
it." The soundtrack for the film is very good, and there is a great scene 
where Jennifer takes Ryan out to a club where they dance to â€œCar Washâ€? by 
Rolls Royce. While dancing, they actually are being washed with soap and 
water by the club's plumbing system. This strange modern musical number was 
also a feature of She's All That. </P>
<P>The appealing actors can't make up for a large amount of very stupid and 
rather pointless lines. At times the lines get convincingly said, at other 
times not, and the movie never reaches a huge level of reality. Jennifer 
complains late in the film about movies like Sixteen Candles, and how they 
never show the relationship six months later when everything is starting to 
fall apart. Despite these comments, this movie does the same thing. I had to 
ask myself how long this relationship could possibly last, but for now it 
makes for an entertaining romance that is sure to please teenagers and adults 
alike.</P>
