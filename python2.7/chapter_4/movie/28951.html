<P>   The blocks surrounding my apartment complex are undergoing
gobs of construction.  The Emmanuel Cellar Federal Building
across the street was demolished to make way for a larger
courthouse; Polytechnic University is making good use of a
multimillion dollar bequest the college recently received to put up
a dorm and an entirely new principal structure; a Department of
Social Services office has been demolished to make room for
who know what.  As I pass these buildings I see the workmen
joking with one another, sending out for coffee and doughnuts,
ogling the women passersby and talking about the latest game
they saw the other day on their 50-inch projection TVS.  Some
workers  look like the stereotypical all-American, others are
remarkably short to be doing this heavy-duty labor.  Most of all
everyone looks so NORMAL.  Ah, but what goes on underneath
the wholesome looks, the friendly chatter, the macho bluster?  Is
Cunningham on the outs with his wife?  Did Klein just get
dumped by his girl friend?  Do McGraw and Bradley hate each
other so much that at least one of them would like to shove the
other from the scaffold?  There are forty or fifty stories up there
on the unfinished eighth floor of this federal building as each
member of the construction crew does his best to put on a cheerful 
face, get the job done, and take home a good paycheck.</P>
<P>   "Session 9" has the makings of such a tale, but what gives
Brad Anderson's piece its feeling of dread--a sensation that
increases steadily, incrementally until the doozy of a payoff--is
that the construction team depicted are working inside a huge
asylum for the insane at Danvers, Massachusetts, which had
been abandoned in 1985 when the federal government and
various states determined to cut the budget and release what
were considered harmless to themselves and others.  Filmed by
Uta Briesewitz with one of those cool, new digital cameras that
knock out 24 frames per second just like film (so you'd scarcely
know the difference) and crisply edited by the director, "Session
9" is what a horror movie should be about.  No teens getting
impaled on meathooks, no false alarms that cause you to hold
your breath for a second only to realize that it's just young
Michael coming up from behind and tapping Susan on the
shoulder.  And happily "Session 9" takes itself with deadly
seriousness.  In other words this is in no way "Scream" or the most 
detestable of the recent mock-slasher fare, "Scary Movie 2."  Brad 
Anderson has surrounded himself with a crackerjack crew of performers
playing a team of asbestos removers who are working against
the clock to get rid of all the junk in the former looney bin in just a
week rather than in the usual three so that they can collect a fat
bonus promised to them by the city.</P>
<P>     For purposes of a review it doesn't hurt to know right off that each 
of the workers has a dark side, the potential to do bad things or to
have criminal acts performed against him.  Phil (David Caruso)
lost a girl friend to a fellow worker on the crew, Hank (Josh
Lucas) and wants to fire him from the start but is prevented
from doing so by his partner, Gordon (Peter Mullan)--who is
currently on the outs with his wife, living in a motel, and
desperately trying to reach her on a cell phone to make up with
her.  Jeff (Brendan Sexton III) is the kid of the outfit who got the
job from his uncle Gordon, but he is burdened with nyctophobia. 
He has fear of darkness--and you know what sort of horror this
can lead scripter Brad Anderson to hand to him during the week
of the project.  Hank tempts the fates by razzing Phil on the latter's
loss of a girl friend, and probably speaks for the entire crew when
he says that everyone there would rather be doing something
else.   Of all the members of the team, Mike (Stephen Gevedon--
who co-scripted the piece)--is the bright one, the guy who
dropped out of law school and simply does not belong in this
blue-collar atmosphere.  His curiosity gets the best of him. 
Despite the deadline, he becomes obsessed with a series of
tapes he finds from the 1980's--a psychotherapist's recording of
nine sessions conducted with a person afflicted with multiple
personality disorder.  Things becoming increasingly hairy partly
because of the secrets that lie within the asbestos-choked walls
of the Danville asylum, more because of the friction that develops
increasingly among the workers--as director Anderson holds the
audience in his grip by upping the ante as the hours tick away.</P>
<P>   The year 1999 brought us the superb ghost story, M. Night
Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense," which meets its match this year with
Alejandro Amenabar's  terminally spooky "The Others," starring
Nicole Kidman as a mother of two who becomes increasingly off
kilter as she witnesses invisible people opening and closing
doors in her large home while an equally unseen person
performs on the piano.  "Session 9" is right up there with those
dread-inspiring works.  As Anderson cuts from the laborers to the
labyrinthine areas of the serpentine building,  we watch each
begin to chat normally as co-workers are wont to do everywhere,
then get increasingly paranoid, even off the wall in two cases. 
But unlike "The Sixth Sense," "Session 9" deals not so much with
demons who lie outside the perimeter but with the devils who
inhabit the minds of the people racing to complete a job.  In that
regard, Anderson's picture is more like Roman Polanski's 1965
masterwork "Repulsion," a psychological shocker depicting the
deterioration of a repressed girl left alone for days in her sister's
apartment.  The men here may not be alone, but like all of us,
they are to an extent isolated in their own psyches.  That is what
gives "Session 9" its believability, and most of all, its distinct
relevance to each of us sitting in the audience. </P>
