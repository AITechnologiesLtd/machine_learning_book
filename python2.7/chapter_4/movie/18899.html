<PRE>Review:        Limbo</PRE>
<P>Starring: David Strathairn, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Vanessa        
Martinez, Casey Siemaszko, Kris Kristofferson</P>
<PRE>Written/directed by: John Sayles</PRE>
<P>Review by: Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic</P>
<P>The Thesaurus says that another word for Limbo is Nothingness.  In this
case, it's not true.  There is so much for the viewer in this marvelous
film.  The scenery alone is breathtaking.  Set in the area surrounding
Juneau, Alaska, you find yourself amazed at the endless terrain.  It must
have been what it was like for the pioneers when they first came to
America, just colder.</P>
<P>The main focus, however, is on the characters.  We get to know them as
real people and we understand why they have chosen to live in such a
remote area.  Each has a reason for seeking a `new' life.    We
immediately feel a relationship for David Strathairn as Joe Gastineau, a
fisherman who does odd-jobs rather than face another tragedy aboard a ship
such as the one that killed the younger brother of Smilin' Jack, played by
Kris Kristofferson.    He is making a delivery to the wedding of the
daughter of a prestigious Alaskan businessman.  Various conversations at
the wedding give us great insight into life in Juneau as it is…and as they
wish to portray it to tourists.</P>
<P>Also working at the wedding are Donna and Noelle De Angelo.  Donna,
portrayed by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is the lead singer for the group
entertaining the guests.  She has suddenly decided to break up with the
bandleader  during a song.  When she walks offstage, she coerces Joe into
taking her into town to pick up her belongings.</P>
<P>Noelle, wonderfully played by Vanessa Martinez, is working there as a
waitress.  She is so good in this role.  You feel all the pain, hurt,
shame, and frustrations that she is going through while watching her
mother again changing boyfriends, this time to Joe.  Her reading of the
diary later in the storyline will definitely move you.</P>
<P>For a while, you think that this is simply a love story, or a story about
Alaska, but it isn't.  It could have limited itself to that and it would
have been very entertaining.  Again, the characters are so perfect.  I
especially liked the two women, who are self-proclaimed lesbians, who
stand up for their rights.  And, there are the graphic scenes in the
salmon packing plant.</P>
<P>When Casey Siemaszko, as Bobby Gastineau, Joe's half-brother shows up,
the plot takes off in another direction.  Survival becomes the big issue. 
 I keep thinking about the end of the movie.  It isn't what I expected. 
When you leave, take another look at the poster.  This film is very good. 
I want to see it again.  I give it a B+.</P>
