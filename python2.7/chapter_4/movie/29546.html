<PRE>HAIKU TUNNEL
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>The bizarrely named HAIKU TUNNEL -- no, it's not a Japanese anime -- is a
sweetly humorous film that oozes charm from every pore.  Starring Josh Kornbluth
as Josh Kornbluth, it is a crowd-pleaser that puts the audience into rolling
howls.  Although not up to the level of Mike Judge's low budget masterpiece,
OFFICE SPACE, HAIKU TUNNEL is an over-the-top, yet dead-on, office comedy that
rings true even when it's the most exaggerated.</P>
<P>Josh, a happy yet neurotic balding guy, has a predicament, "to perm or not to
perm?"  No, he's not worried about what to do with his long, shaggy side-hair,
but whether he should make the big leap in life and convert from a temporary
secretary at the law firm -- S&M, no less -- where he works, to a permanent
employee.  Like a virgin who finally decides to make the big plunge -- "I don't
go perm on my first week." -- he throws caution to the wind and signs up.</P>
<P>At first the story looks like it will be a dark, Kafkaesque one.  When Josh goes
to work at S&M, he finds that the only paper on his desk is an eleven-and-a-half
page memo to the previous secretary explaining precisely what the boss expected
of her.  Although he fears that his boss is the devil incarnate and he worries
that he'll be caught messing up by the Nazi-like head secretary, his fears prove
unfounded, and the story turns out to be one of the sweetest ones of the year.</P>
<P>Along the way Kornbluth, who sometimes reminds one of a chubby Woody Allen,
copes with his many neuroses with great flair.  A wonderfully likeable actor,
Kornbluth could easily carry the movie on his own shoulders, and, indeed, the
film sometimes plays like a comedy monologue.  The supporting cast, which brings
an improv feel, perfectly complements the star.  My favorite is Helen Shumaker. 
A wisp of a middle-aged woman with salt-and-pepper hair, she plays the stern
looking Marlina D'Amore, the head secretary, which she slowly transforms from
the Wicked Witch of the West into a real sweetheart.</P>
<P>The writing has Orwellian sharpness, and a key subplot concerns the office class
hierarchy.  The story also gives the nondescript items of office work a life of
their own.  In one of my favorite episodes in which Josh retrieves his long lost
letters -- they were printed on a printer in another building thanks to the
screw-up of a system admin geek -- the pages coo and sing to him in chorus,
"You've come for me."  Take their advice.  Come and see Josh and his wacky
workers.  They're certain to put a smile on your face.  </P>
<P>HAIKU TUNNEL runs 1:30.  It is rated R for "language and some sexuality" and
would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States today, Friday, September 21,
2001.  In the Silicon Valley, it is showing at the Camera Cinemas.</P>
