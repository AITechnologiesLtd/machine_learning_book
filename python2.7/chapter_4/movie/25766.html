<PRE>CECIL B. DEMENTED
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>"Power to the people and punish bad cinema!" screams director Cecil B. 
Demented (Stephen Dorff from BLADE).  He is the leader of a young group 
of cinema terrorists and a self-described "prophet against profit" in 
making motion pictures.</P>
<P>CECIL B. DEMENTED is another deliciously over-the-top movie by that bad 
boy of indie films, outrageous writer and director John Waters.  
Although his last picture (PECKER) was a disappointment, most of his 
movies, such as SERIAL MOM, are real treats.  And this latest one of his 
is perhaps his best ever.</P>
<P>Melanie Griffith, delivering her first good performance since, well, I 
don't remember when, plays the lead, a self-absorbed star named Honey 
Whitlock.  Honey coos sweet nothings to the press but, behind the 
scenes, is a trash-talking bitch.  </P>
<P>Waters has the audience in stitches with the opening scene, which shows 
a multiplex whose films, according to the marquee, are STAR WARS, STAR 
TREK, STAR WARS, STAR TREK, STAR WARS and STAR TREK.  These titles and 
others dissolve into the film's credits.  Keep your eye out for other 
marquees during the movie.  The best advertises PATCH ADAMS: THE 
DIRECTOR'S CUT.</P>
<P>Honey is kidnapped by Cecil and his band of cinema outlaws.  (Since 
Honey is kidnapped, much like Patty Hearst was, Waters, in perfect bad 
taste, gets Patty Hearst to play a cameo part in the movie.)  Cecil 
wants Honey to star in his reality-based movie.  His horny crew, which 
includes an ex-porn star, Cherish (Alicia Witt), has "taken a vow of 
celibacy for celluloid" until it's a wrap, so Cecil tells Honey that 
she's safe with them.</P>
<P>The movie is filled with film industry in-jokes.  Every member of the 
crew threatens Honey if she doesn't perform precisely as required.  The 
cinematographer, for example, tells her just what will happen to her if 
she doesn't hit her mark.  She is also required to do her own stunts 
even if they may kill her.  "Suffer for celluloid!" screams Cherish as 
she makes Honey leap off of a building for her art.  </P>
<P>The movie skewers everyone from unions to drug addicts.  "Before I was a 
drug addict, I had so many different problems," says a coke-head and 
glue-sniffer played by Adrian Grenier.  "Now I only have one problem."</P>
<P>Waters stages fights using fans of various film genres (family, action 
and porn), managing to poke fun at each.  A scene inside a porn house 
playing one Cherish's movies is one of CECIL B. DEMENTED's funniest 
sequences.</P>
<P>Waters even comes up with a catchy little song and a motto, "Demented 
Forever," that will likely stay with you and remind you of this wacky 
and thoroughly enjoyable movie.</P>
<P>So what is the ultimate insult to a deep, deep underground director like 
Demented?  A prudish looking, family-film aficionado tells Demented 
that, "You're direct-to-video."  Oh, the pain!</P>
<P>CECIL B. DEMENTED runs a fast 1:28.  It is rated R for strong crude 
sexual content, violence, language and drug use and would be acceptable 
for older teenagers.</P>
