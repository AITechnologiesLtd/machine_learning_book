CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>The much anticipated and highly praised CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON 
is the most overrated film of the year.  Although it has MATRIX-inspired 
moments that are truly magical, these are few and far between.  A talky 
film with remarkably little to say, it features characters that are 
never fleshed out or worth caring about.  Kung fu fans will be probably 
be willing to wait through more long dry spots than Death Valley in 
order to watch the fighting.  Others may find themselves in the unusual 
position of frequently checking their watches in what, one assumes, is 
supposed to be an action picture.  Certainly, if the action sequences 
were removed, the rest of the comatose script would not be worth 
watching.</P>
<P>In CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, director Ang Lee (SENSE AND 
SENSIBILITY and THE ICE STORM) has come up with the least interesting 
film of his career, one that is, on the whole, not up even to his last 
effort, RIDE WITH THE DEVIL.</P>
<P>Chow Yun Fat, after his disastrous performance in ANNA AND THE KING, 
plays the male lead, Li Mu Bai, who is in the process of giving up his 
famous sword, Green Destiny.  Joining him is the head of the Yuan 
Security Compound, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh, TOMORROW NEVER DIES).  
Along the way, Jen (Zhang Ziyi), a disciple of the evil Jade Fox (Cheng 
Pei Pei), captures the sword.  Needless to say, the others will want to 
get it back.  </P>
<P>The trailers show almost all of the good scenes from the movie.  As they 
fight with swords and fists, the actors get to walk on water as well as 
treetops and thin bamboo.  Almost all of their movements do not occur 
naturally in nature.  These sequences could have formed the basis for a 
wonderful motion picture, but, as soon as the action stops, the actors 
start to slowly, painfully slowly, drone on with some of the most 
lifeless dialog of the year.</P>
<P>Based on the trailers, I expected a magical motion picture.  Instead, I 
got a tedious one that is interrupted sporadically by interludes of 
brilliance.  According to my watch, with which I become well acquainted 
during the screening, I believe that there are about 10 minutes of a 
great movie interspersed into an exceedingly dull one.  See the 
trailers; skip the movie.</P>
<P>CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON runs a long 1:59.  The film is in 
Mandarin with English subtitles.  It is rated PG-13 for martial arts 
violence and some sexuality and would be acceptable for kids around 11 
and up.  I suspect, however, that most kids will be quite bored.</P>
