THE UGLY KID
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>Cricket.  That's what they call Lloyd in Hector Barron's THE UGLY KID.  
With no chin, a large mouth, big eyes and geeky glasses, Lloyd (Todd 
Bosley) is an awkward kid who tries to make friends by being the class 
clown.  Even with candy bribes to his whole 6th grade class, he still 
remains decidedly unpopular.  He gets no valentines, no dances and no 
birthday party guests.  </P>
<P>Loving Tracy, the prettiest girl in school, Lloyd is, of course, spurned 
while a more deserving candidate casts her eyes on him.  On the other 
hand, a good kid and a nice looking boy, Troy (Brendon Ryan Barrett), 
becomes his best and only friend.  Lloyd could learn a thing or two from 
his 8-year-old brother, Nathan, a self-proclaimed "chick magnet," whose 
"honeys" call him up regularly on the phone.</P>
<P>The teachers in Lloyd's junior high school are various degrees of 
idiots.  Mrs. Crub, the worst of the bunch, ridicules her pupils by 
saying things like, "You're here to learn.  Ignorance isn't something to 
be proud of!"  She is of the opinion that the kids would learn more if 
the school weren't so much fun.  Most of the acting, especially by the 
adults, is way below the level found in just about any television series 
on the Disney channel.  Bosley tries hard to be sympathetically 
obnoxious but ends up being just obnoxious instead.</P>
<P>Lloyd's big dream is to marry Tracy.  He sees them together having an 
intimate candlelight dinner of Lucky Charms with chilled milk served out 
of a champagne bottle.  He would also like to try some "tongue hockey" 
on her, which is when the boy sticks his tongue far enough down the 
girl's mouth to "ring her bell."  </P>
<P>Lloyd's one claim to fame is that he knows a little magic, which he 
learns from the local magic store owner (Tom Arnold in a cameo).  Our 
family was wishing that Lloyd would make the whole movie disappear.  And 
the sooner the better.</P>
<P>THE UGLY KID runs 1:18.  It is rated PG for language and playground 
violence and would be acceptable for most kids.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, almost 12, who is a 6th grader just like Lloyd, thought 
the movie was absolutely terrible.  He gave it 1/2 of a star.  Only a 
nice ending scene kept him from giving it zero.  He said that the acting 
and the plot were dull, boring and stupid and that there weren't any 
funny or exciting parts anywhere in the picture.</P>
