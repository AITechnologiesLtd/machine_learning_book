<PRE>                          THE QUICK AND THE DEAD
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     You probably will not believe it but besides BASIC INSTINCT which
brought her instant fame, Sharon Stone has appeared in twenty-one other
films.  That includes a quickie moment in Woody Allen's STARDUST
MEMORIES when he catches a glimpse of her on a passing train.  THE
QUICK AND THE DEAD was supposed to make us forget the films that went
nowhere but this one will not do it.</P>
<P>     From the opening scene of a cowboy on his horse approaching
us at top speed across the range, there was a noticeable giggle in the
audience.  Everyone, it seems, guessed it was our first glimpse of
Ellen (Sharon Stone) and for some reason it looked funny.  It just was
not the Sharon Stone we have come to know and love.</P>
<P>     The remainder of the film has nothing to add.  It is a typical
Western.  Instead of a dusty cowboy seeking revenge on some bad guy
(Gene Hackman, in this case), it is a woman who is out to get him for
his role in having her father, a Marshall, killed when Ellen was just
about ten years old.</P>
<P>     There are plenty of tough hombres in the town of Redemption which
Herod (Hackman) runs with the help of his cronies.  To reduce the
number, each year he stages a shooting contest, with the winner (he who
remains alive) getting a large cash prize.  As Herod is the fastest
draw in town, guess who always wins?  And guess who hates him for
that: his son, "Kid," (Leonardo DiCaprio) who gets no respect from his
old man.</P>
<P>     This year there is a slight change in the :hootout; a woman is
going to participate and, as the rules never said a woman could not be
in the contest, Ellen is allowed in.  Ah, revenge!</P>
<P>     As acting goes, there is not very much in the film to challenge
anyone.  Sharon never cracks a smile, Hackman never stops his sneering
smile, DiCaprio has little to do.  The story is not supposed to be
taken seriously (said Director Raimi) and you can bet that no one
will.</P>
<P>     Others in the cast include Russell Crowe who used to be in Herod's
gang but decided he would rather be on the side of God.  Then there are
gunfighters played by Lance Henriksen, Keith David, Tobin Bell and
Jonathan Gill.</P>
