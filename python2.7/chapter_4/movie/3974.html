<PRE>                                 DESPERADO
                       A film review by Clark Goble
                        Copyright 1995 Clark Goble</PRE>
<PRE>Director:   Robert Rodriguez 
Screenplay: Robert Rodriguez </PRE>
<P>     Despite the hype that DESPERADO has received in the media and on
the net I still went in with some trepidation.  After all, the main
people praising Rodriguez were fans of the Hong Kong school of
directing: lots of bodies and guns that never run out of ammunition.</P>
<P>     The movie actually surprised me.  The first half was excellent.
The best description I could give is to say it is Clint Eastwood's
spaghetti westerns as done by Quentin Tarantino.  The first half of the
film is craftily put together with an excellent eye for both humor and
suspense.  The bar fight that opens the film is an excellent "dream
like sequence" that sets the stage for what was to follow.  The main
bar room brawl in the first half of the film is one of the best done
sequences of this sort since the original RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, as good as the first half of the movie is, it does
not begin to make up for the second half.  Rodriguez seems to have run
out of plot and by then all of the cameos are dead.  What we are left
with is a typical action movie without a plot.  The twists in the movie
end up being silly and the action sequences seem more like the A-Team
trapped in a guitar factory.  Only the A-Team gunfights seem a little
more realistic.  It is one thing to be over the top but quite an other
to go completely overboard.</P>
<P>     I really hope we get to see more of Rodriguez direction: he has
great talent.  Unfortunately, what we have as a first product is an
other example of the paucity of good scripts in Hollywood.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B- (but only because the first half was so good)
       D  (the second half)</PRE>
