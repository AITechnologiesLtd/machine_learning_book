<P>     "Duets" isn't a very good movie, but it has moments so good that 
you almost forgive it.  It takes place in the world of karaoke, that 
fading phenomenon that gives people a chance to be a star for three 
minutes (one-fifth of the Warhol lifetime allowance.)</P>
<P>     The good moments are not much to be seen early.  It's all dim 
lighting, bad blocking, and missed moments.  A karaoke hustler (Huey 
Lewis) plays the rube, lays some side bets, and then blows away the 
competition.  It's no news that Huey Lewis can handle a song, but the 
scene doesn't rise to the occasion.  Other characters are introduced - 
his estranged chorus girl daughter (Gwynneth Paltrow, director Bruce 
Paltrow's daughter), a salesman weary of his job and his life (Paul 
Giamatti), an ex-con guilty of "an error in judgment" (Andre Braugher), 
a cab driver and a karaoke singer (Scott Speedman, Maria Bello).  The 
most intriguing insight the movie offers is that fellatio is more 
dependable currency than frequent flyer miles. </P>
<P>     But there are music scenes that really take off, particularly those 
involving Giamatti and Braugher, who also provide the most interesting 
duet of the proceedings, thanks more to their playing than to the 
hackneyed script.  Their "Try a Little Tenderness" got people whooping 
in the movie theater (although Braugher's singing is dubbed.)  Gwynneth 
Paltrow does well as a sweet dim bulb, and shows off a beautiful voice.  </P>
<P>     It's TV veteran Paltrow's first theatrical feature since '82 ("A 
Little Sex"), and you won't leave the theater wondering why.</P>
