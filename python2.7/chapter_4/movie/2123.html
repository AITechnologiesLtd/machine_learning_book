<PRE>                           STRIKING DISTANCE
                       A film review by Jon Webb
                        Copyright 1993 Jon Webb</PRE>
<P>     This is the film whose working title was THREE RIVERS when it was
made in Pittsburgh some months ago.  I remember that the city offered
extremely good cooperation during the making of this film; they
willingly shut down streets, closed tunnels and bridges, at the
convenience of the filmmakers.</P>
<P>     All the cooperation paid off.  The film is like an advertisement
for Pittsburgh; it conveys a wholly different image from the
conventional one of a worn-out steel town.  Pittsburgh is clean, a city
of rivers.  We should be able to use this film to recruit new faculty
and students.</P>
<P>     The orientation of the film, toward's Pittsburgh's rivers, is
strong enough to make one think of Pittsburgh differently.  It seems
like we all should have boats, to give the impressive Pittsburgh Rescue
Force something to do.</P>
<P>     The plot is the obvious cop-movie plot.  A policeman has suffered
damage in the past as a result of his encounter with evil.  He has been
weakened to his very soul.  He must confront the evil again; will he
triumph.</P>
<P>     There's very little surprise in the film, though I suppose the
ending qualifies.  A few scenes were oddly filmed, and for that reason
striking:  for example, the shot of the three people tied to chairs,
and the drowning scene at the end.  It's something of a fresh view.</P>
<P>     But basically, this is a Bruce Willis film, with Bruce using
brutality softened by sarcastic quips to get his way, which is always
right.</P>
