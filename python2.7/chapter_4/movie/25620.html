<PRE>THE FANTASTICKS</PRE>

 United Artists
 Director: Michael Ritchie
 Writer:  Tom Jones, Harvey Schmidt

McIntyre, Jonathon Morris, Brad Sullivan, Teller</P>
<P>   When "The Fantasticks" opened off-Broadway on May 3,
1960 the two-act musical by Tom Jones, music by Harvey
Schmidt (suggested by Edmond Rostand's play "Les
Romanesques") was not yet dated.  Broadway productions
like "South Pacific" were already over the hill, but "The
Fantasticks" was perhaps considered timeless--a benefit
helped by its simple staging in the tiny Sullivan Street
Playhouse in New York's Greenwich Village where it is still
playing.  The staged work got a nice boost from Jerry
Orbach's position in the principal role of El Gallo, the
handsome would-be bandit who creates a fairy-tale world for
two teenagers to show them that you're best off looking for
love and romance in your own back yard.  </P>
<P>   You'd think that once the Vietnam War dragged on, leading
to increasing cynicism in the country, that such a fragile work
would die out as hopelessly dated.  Nonetheless the mood
created by this gossamer show hooked the crowds, which,
we are told, often remained in their seats several minutes
after the final curtain, the middle-aged members of the
audience remembering their youth and their first loves
through rose-tinted spectacles.</P>
<P>   Michael Ritchie's movie version opens up the play, still
keeping the fairy-tale motif, with its Arizona setting reminding
us of the vast reaches of farmland in the U.S. and helping to
make the characters stand out as isolated individuals in a
self-enclosed world.  What Ritchie does not ultimately
succeed in doing is re-creating the ambience that we felt in
the small theater in the Village because, after all, this is not a
grand and glorious celebration of life that made "Oklahoma"
even better on the big screen than on the stage.</P>
<P>   Ritchie re-arranged the songs, leaving the most famous
yearning song of nostalgia, "Try to Remember," for last,
perhaps because this is the one song recalled by anyone
who had seen the play forty years ago.  This is the strain that
moviegoers today probably wait to hear in fond anticipation. 
While the term "rape" is mentioned only once or twice--its
meaning in this play being the primary one of abduction and
seizure--the Rape Ballet no longer has that name and there is
no mention of the "First Class Rape" ordered by the fathers
in a roundabout way to help persuade their two children to
marry each other.</P>
<P>   The story is of two fathers, Bellamy (Joel Grey) and
Hucklebee (Brad Sullivan), who build a wall between the
adjoining homes and pretend to feud so that their children,
Luisa (Jean Louisa Lelly) and Matt (Joseph McIntyre) would
act as teens always do--to defy their allegedly hostile parents
and bond happily with each other.  To further their plan, they
pay El Gallo (Jonathon Morris)--who is the leader of a
traveling carnival act--to kidnap the girl so that the boy could
come to her rescue and be deemed a hero.  But Luisa
becomes infatuated with the handsome would-be bandit--who
takes her on a smoke-and-mirrors trip around the world--while
Matt, made to drink a bitter, magic solution, thinks like Judy
Garland's Dorothy that he is traveling way outside his
neighborhood.  Realizing that the world is not as glamorous
as they thought, the two young lovers are happily reunited.</P>
<P>   What saves the movie from terminal obsolescence is the
magical voice of Jean Louisa Kelly who can dance almost as
well as she can vocalize and whose intense and lovely
adolescent expressiveness should win most in the audience. 
Jonathon Morris makes a charming El Gallo but the two guys
playing the fathers, Joel Grey and Brad Sullivan, are so
irritating in the story that they become annoying for us in the
audience to watch.</P>
<P>   The movie does have innovations worthy of note.  For one,
thanks to digital technology, the actors sang live during the
shooting rather than lip-synching with recorded tracks.  For
another, this sugary musical is an antidote to the overkill of
vulgarity of the last two or three seasons.  Even the kisses
are innocent ones, over the eyes, on the hand and on the
wrist.  Also, the two performers playing the lovebirds are
teens themselves, not the twenty-somethings usually cast in
stories involving high-school kids.  In the final analysis the
movie could make one wonder about the longevity of the
play, but then, "Cats" has already proved that box office is
usually not directly related to quality.</P>
<P>Rated PG.  Running time: 85 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
