<PRE>                            THE X FILES 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
          2 :-) :-) for the bizarre world of Mulder and Scully</PRE>
<P>Cast: David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Martin Landau, Blythe Danner,
William B. Davis, Armin Mueller-Stahl, John Neville, Terry O'Quinn
Director: Rob Bowman
Producers: Chris Carter, Daniel Sackheim
Screenplay: Chris Carter</P>
<P>There is no corporate conspiracy between the Uranians and certain
government groups, to re-populate the planet Earth. Nor is there a
mutated alien virus hidden beneath the ice caps of Antartica, ready to
emerge to infect humanity and transform the host into gestation pods for
the creation of a new species. There isn't, nor will there ever be a FBI
agent as paranoid as Fox Mulder or as sexy as Dana Scully. It is also
unlikely that these two uncanny heroes will get close enough to kiss
again, until perhaps, their next feature movie.</P>
<P>After stating all the unlikely-hoods, the likely-hoods are that if you
are not an X-Files fan, which I am not, you may actually enjoy the
movie. So what has made the X-Files such a hugely popular syndicate
series. That is a difficult question and there is no answer, except for
some strange reason, the public enjoys watching aliens possess humans,
kidnap humans, mutilate humans, infect humans, digest humans … which
just about covers every episode of the X-Files. This is purely
observational, from someone who has never watched a full episode, but
the adverts say it all.</P>
<P>So what made me like a movie about subject material, I don't even like
watching on TV? Well I guess that eerie opening tune was catchy and sent
tingles down my spine, and the awkward chemistry between Mulder and
Scully was quite electrifying. Pity a stupid bee had to sting her as the
sexual tension mounted, leaving more than a love bite. The question now
is will I watch the series, because I liked the movie. Probably not, but
I will certainly look out for the next movie.</P>
