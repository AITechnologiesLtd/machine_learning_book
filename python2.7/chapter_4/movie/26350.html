<P>"We just hope we don't bore the s@#! out of you." 
--- Actor David Warbeck expresses unfounded fears over his (sadly) one
and only commentary track performance on the excellent DVD for the cult
film The Beyond. </P>
<P>A young woman Liza (Catriona MacColl) inherits an old hotel in Louisiana
where a painter (Antoine Saint John) that was guarding the gateway to
hell was viciously murdered by a lynch mob almost sixty years earlier. 
As handymen fix up the hotel for her, the crucified painter is
accidentally unearthed, causing the gateway to hell to swing wide and
allow the dead to rise and walk the Earth.  With the assistance of a
doctor named John McCabe (David Warbeck), Liza must find a mystical book
that may seal the portal and finally set things right in the world.  In
their way though, stands a legion of zombies lead by the undead painter,
who has all sorts of nasty surprises in store for those who stand in his
way. </P>
<P>The Beyond is, most certainly, the late Italian horror film guru Lucio
Fulci's masterpiece.  The plot may initially sound like a rehash of the
Evil Dead trilogy, but make no mistake about its origins.  This film was
made just prior to the completion and release of the original Sam Raimi
classic and contains more of a metaphysical slant than the more visceral
cult trilogy (though the metaphysical nature of the film is upstaged by
the mind-blowing ending of Michele Soavi's Cemetery Man).  The film also
contains little humor, which also sets it apart from Raimi's films. </P>
<P>We may not have been able to see this film the way it was intended if it
hadn't have been for two fanatical fans of the film and the recent
interest in Italian cinema.  In 1995, Sylvester Stallone's son Sage and
Army of Darkness editor Bob Murawski decided that there were some
classic underground, horror, and gore films that had been released over
the last twenty or more years that had not been getting the recognition
they deserved.  Thus was formed Grindhouse Releasing, a company
specializing in the restoration and release of classic cult films
theatrically and on home video (not to mention having the coolest logo
of any releasing studio in the country).  The first film they obtained
was the Lucio Fulci gorefest, The Beyond. </P>
<P>When this film was initially released to US theaters it was titled Seven
Doors of Death, and most of the traumatic footage of death and
dismemberment had been edited out.  This caused many to feel that the
film's narrative was lacking and that the director had to be a hack. 
With the assistance of Quentin Tarantino and his own production company
Rolling Thunder Pictures, a deal was struck that actually allowed
Fulci's film to finally be shown in the US in its full uncut version.  </P>
<P>And what an uncut version this film is too!  Although it doesn't come
anywhere near Peter Jackson's over-the-top gore circus Dead Alive
(a.k.a. Braindead), The Beyond showcases some of the most revoltingly
gory special effects ever seen in a film.  The opening scene, shot in a
sepia-tone coloration that gives it the feel of an old photograph,
features a chain-whipping sequence lifted straight out of Don't Torture
a Duckling (though the one presented here is far more graphic in its
depiction) followed by a crucifixion and the scalding and melting of a
man's face with quicklime.  What follows is more bloody face melting,
eye gouging, and exploding heads than many Italian films put together. 
The effects aren't top of the line, but they are very effective. </P>
<P>In fact, the only truly ineffective effect still packs a slight bit of a
wallop.  The scene entails a man named Martin (Michele Mirabella)
researching the grounds that the old hotel was built on (featuring the
basement where the painter was nailed to the wall... a virtual
impossibility since Louisiana is below sea level and no basements exist
throughout the state).  Martin accidentally falls off of the ladder he
was standing on while reading the old blueprints of the hotel and is
immediately set upon by killer tarantulas.  Many of the spiders in the
scene are most certainly real, but a few are obviously fake.  The fake
spiders then proceed to eat the flesh off of the Martin's face, which
looks very much like a dummy head rigged to spew blood and lose flesh. 
Where the scene does work though is a truly gross scene where one of the
spiders is seen rooting around underneath Martin's eyelid, finally
dragging the eyeball out with him when he backs out of the cavity. </P>
<P>Note: Fulci makes his Hitchcock-like cameo during the aforementioned
scene as a town clerk who allows Martin to do his own research while he
takes a union-mandated early lunch break.  </P>
<P>The Beyond was intended as the second film in a proposed trilogy of
films called the Seven Gates Trilogy (the first film being the
entertainingly graphic City of the Living Dead).  In fact, The Beyond
was actually supposed to be much different from the finished product and
was re-worked to expand on the themes set up in the first film when the
German distributors financing the project demanded there be zombies in
the script (when there originally weren't any).  The Seven Gates Trilogy
was never completed although one of the stars of The Beyond, David
Warbeck, wrote a treatment for an actual sequel to The Beyond itself
that picked up right where the first film left off, but he passed away
before it could come to fruition and the project was halted. </P>
<P>If the film alone doesn't satisfy your Fulci cravings, then the ultimate
Fulci fans Blackest Heart Media (www.blackestheart.com) have a bit of a
surprise for you.  Well known for their excellent graphic novel
adaptations of Fulci films, the gang don't disappoint again with a
wonderful comic version of The Beyond.  The Blackest Heart gang have
mastered the feel of Fulci's universe and even expand on some of the
character motivations, giving the film an even deeper subtext.  Included
in the comic are a forward by novelist Douglas E. Winter and three great
essays centering around horror comics (written by Steve Bissette), the
film itself (written by Blackest Heart owner Shawn "Smith" Lewis), and
the film's excellent music conducted by Fabio Frizzi (written by Stephen
Romano). </P>
<P>Speaking of the music, the graphic novel also comes with a remastered CD
soundtrack for the film, exclusive to its release.  The soundtrack
contains the entire score, as well as great dialogue clips from the film
("You ungodly warlock!"). </P>
<P>Anchor Bay Entertainment has outdone themselves with an excellent DVD
special edition of The Beyond.  The film is presented in the aspect
ratio of 2.35:1 (enhanced for 16x9 televisions) and is a wonder to
behold.  There are no visible scratches on the print used for the
transfer and the film looks as if it were shot only a few short years
ago, instead of almost twenty.  Features on the disc include the
international trailer, the German trailer, the US theatrical re-release
trailer, a music video directed by Jim Van Bebber (of Deadbeat at Dawn
fame) featuring clips from the film and a band that is apparently
screaming lyrics based on the film, the original color version of the
German opening credits (made because the German releasing studio didn't
appreciate the artistic vision of the director), and a still gallery
that also includes actual video footage of Fulci on the set of Demonia
and footage of he and David Warbeck answering questions at a convention. </P>
<P>The most entertaining feature on the disc is a commentary track by stars
Catriona MacColl and David Warbeck.  The track had originally been
recorded for the laserdisc release (and Warbeck was actually very ill
during the taping and died soon afterwards, though you can never tell by
his voice and attitude during the track).  The two seem to have a blast
reminiscing about the film and are actually surprised at the fans they
have garnered due to it.  All throughout, they crack jokes and discuss
Fulci with a high regard for his talent and the stories they have to
tell are fascinating and hilarious.  MacColl does seem a little
uncomfortable during the gore scenes (as she hasn't seen the film in
many years), but she always remains professional.  Commentary highlight:
When Warbeck reveals that a joke he had made on set (reloading his gun
by dropping bullets down the barrel) actually made it into the final cut
of the film... along with MacColl's bemused on-screen reaction when she
sees him doing it.  </P>
<P>As an added bonus, there are a few hidden easter eggs to be found.  The
first hidden goody is located on the "Images from the Beyond" menu
page.  From the Menu icon at the bottom of the page, click over to the
Mark of Eibon on the left to access an extremely gory trailer for the
Fulci film Cat in the Brain.  The second hidden goody is located on the
Audio Setup page.  From the Resume icon at the bottom of the page, click
over to the Mark of Eibon on the left to access the original opening of
the 1981 US version of The Beyond (entitled Seven Doors of Death and
credited to director "Louis Fuller"). </P>
<P>Note: Anchor Bay also has devised a most unusual and hilarious method of
promotion for the film.  Screener copies of the DVD were sent out inside
a specially created vomit bag proclaiming "the intense and shocking
nature of the film" and how "individuals with sensitive constitutions
may experience stomach distress".  The bag also asks "Can you take it?"
and lists the day and date of the film's release on VHS and DVD.  A
funny message at the bottom of the bag warns against over-filling. 
Though few will actually get to see this promotional item, it is
wonderfully inspired and was a highlight of receiving the disc. </P>
