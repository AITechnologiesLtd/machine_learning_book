<PRE>GRATEFUL DAWG
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>For fans only.  Gillian Grisman's traditionally composed documentary, GRATEFUL
DAWG, features Jerry Garcia and David Grisman in non-stop, mainly bluegrass
music, overlaid with a group of fairly uninteresting talking heads.  The late
Jerry Garcia is, of course, best known for being the lead of the Grateful Dead,
a name which isn't even mentioned until more than halfway through the
documentary.  Besides playing electric guitar with the Grateful Dead, Garcia
also liked to play banjo music with his old buddy Grisman.  Their music together
is certainly pleasant enough, but, unless you're a fan of this genre, you may
find it as sleep inducing as I did.</P>
<P>These two veteran musicians look so much alike that they could easily pass for
brothers.  Older hippie types with graying, frizzy hair and beard and chunky
builds, they are wonderfully gregarious and instantly likeable.  One of the
interviewees explains that the difference between them is that Grisman is highly
disciplined whereas Garcia is so laid-back that, if a note didn't come out quite
the right way, it was no big deal.  This isn't particularly apparent in the many
jam sessions and concert footage that we're shown.  They seem almost
interchangeably identical.</P>
<P>If almost an hour and a half of folk tunes from blue grass to old whaling songs
sounds like just your cup of tea, then GRATEFUL DAWG should prove very
satisfying to your palate.  On the other hand, if you prefer more limited doses
of this kind of music, you'll probably find yourself nodding off.  Personally I
found only one part of the film completely satisfying, which is their "The
Thrill Is Gone" music video, which appears to be included in its entirety.</P>
<P>GRATEFUL DAWG runs 1:20.  It is rated PG-13 for "brief language" and would be
acceptable for kids of all ages.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on October 5, 2001.  In the
Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the Camera Cinemas.</P>
