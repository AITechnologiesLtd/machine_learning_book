<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>They don't come gooier than this feel-good fluff piece without being too sugary
for consumption. It's a romantic comedy that spins every formulaic device
possible into overdrive to come up with its cutesy love story, missing only the
presence of Julia Roberts and any sort of genuine passion. It plays as if it was
an ad showing how the 'Beautiful People' spend some quality time doing the NYC
scene by taking in the Waldorf Astoria, Bloomingdales, Central Park's Wollman
Rink, and when looking up toward the skies they can even spot NYC's tallest
skyscaper--the Empire State Building. It was all so superficial and predictable.
The comedy was oooh so heavy-handed and the romance was unbearably contrived. To
get in the mood for this goo, one has to find numerous coincidental situations
believable even if they are not possible, which was asking too much from me. </P>
<P>If you like a flick that's pretty to look at, has attractive leads, sells its
love story like a $100 hooker sells herself at night in Times Square, is
brainless and anti-septic, and requires no thought, then this film might be in
your diet. </P>
<P>The lead character, the very beautiful British actress who plays Sara Thomas,
Kate Beckinsale, tells us that "Serendipity" has a nice sound for what it
means-- a fortunate accident. It also stands for the name of a sweets shop in
Manhattan where the two strangers first get to talk to each other while sitting
down over an ice cream sundae. </P>
<P>The film opens in Bloomingdales during the Christmas season and Jonathan Trager
(Cusack) grabs for the same pair of cashmere gloves as does Sara and then he
looks in her luminous eyes, sees astronomical formed freckles on her arm, and
falls madly in love with her. When he asks for her number a gust of wind blows
the paper out of his hand. Sara sees this as a sign that their fate should now
be in the hands of the gods and sets up two other possible chance meetings with
him in the hopes of fate determining whether they will meet again. After all she
'reasons,' if that's a good word to use in this film review, they are both
currently involved with someone else. He writes his name and number on a $5 bill
which immediately gets passed on to a newspaper kiosk vender and she writes hers
on the inside of a copy of García Márquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera," which
she promises to sell tomorrow to a used bookstore. </P>
<P>The movie shifts to three years later and they are both set to marry different
mates. They have had no contact, but with their impending weddings approaching
soon they begin to think of each other and yearn to meet again. Jon, a field
producer for ESPN, who wears his yuppie heart on his sleeve and agonizes over
not being with his ideal soulmate. He is set to marry the stiffly beautiful
Halley (Bridget Moynahan), who has nothing to say or do in this film but be
pushed over for another. Meanwhile, Sara, now a San Francisco therapist is to
marry a gimmicky New Age musician Lars (John Corbett), whose idea of romance is
to propose in the living room of their S.F. house before a fireplace and a bunch
of burning candles placed on stands at different heights in a setting that looks
like it's an ad for furnishings placed in a Bloomie's catalogue. Both feel
uneasy with their choices of mates who are easily expendable; so both decide to
look for each other. Can you guess if they will succeed! </P>
<P>The film gets comedy relief from the supporting cast. The best comedy comes from
Dean (Piven), an obit writer for the N.Y. Times and Jon's best friend. The one
bit he does that saves this film for me, is write an hilarious obit for Jon
based on what the Greeks might have said if they wrote obits for someone who
died for love. Sara's best friend is Eve (Shannon), a New Age waitress, whose
cliché and underdeveloped role is as the good-hearted wisecracking best friend
who only exists for Sara. There's also some forced comedy via acerbic quips from
a stuffy Bloomie's salesman, who helps Jon track down Sara through her credit
card number. He provides some laughs, except he hangs around too long in the
story and begins to become tiresome. </P>
<P>You can believe as this film does in "fate determining one's future," but it
does an awful job in proving its case. Though, I've seen much worst romantic
comedies. In this one, at least, the leads who didn't inspire me, didn't turn me
completely off. Which is the best I can say about this flick. </P>
