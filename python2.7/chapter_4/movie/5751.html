<PRE>                                 KANSAS CITY
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Every time Robert Altman makes a movie, it becomes *the* thing to
do for the Hollywood acting community.  It happened with THE PLAYER.  It
happened with SHORT CUTS.  It happened with READY TO WEAR.  And it
happened with KANSAS CITY.</P>
<P>     The only problem is that THE PLAYER was the last of his films that
was really all that great.  While KANSAS CITY marks a slight improvement
over READY TO WEAR, that ain't saying much because, after all, so does
SHOWGIRLS.</P>
<P>     KANSAS CITY is Altman's homage to the 1930's in the titular city,
with a plot revolving around a brassy young girl named Blondie (Jennifer
Jason Leigh) who kidnaps the drugged-out wife (Miranda Richardson) of
one of President Roosevelt's advisors named Henry Stilton (Michael
Murphy).  Why?  Because Blondie's husband (Dermot Mulroney) is about to
be killed by local gangster Seldom Seen (Harry Belafonte), and Blondie
thinks Stilton can get him back before it's too late.</P>
<P>     That's basically it as near as I can tell, mainly because the plot
of the movie is given second billing to the scores of jazz musicians
Altman populates the film with.  The jazz is everywhere -- drowning out
dialogue and action and just about everything else.  Not that that's a
bad thing, because without the music the film would be even worse than
it already is.  I just hadn't realized that Altman was making music
videos now.</P>
<P>     What's so bad about KANSAS CITY?  The main problem is that Altman
tries to make this really dull, boring, and simple story into something
that is unique, exciting, and intricate -- all of which he fails at
miserably.  It starts with some horrible acting performances from
otherwise good actors, the worst of the lot being Mulroney, who just
*stands* there for 90 of the 120 minutes, looking like a sheepdog.  And
there's Leigh, who acts like she's reprising that wretched role from
GEORGIA, stumbling from scene to scene, and leading me to re-evaluate my
opinion of her acting ability altogether.</P>
<P>     KANSAS CITY does have a neat ending, but it's far too little, far
too late, and in retrospect, it doesn't even make a whole lot of sense. 
But at least it was something different.  Oh well.</P>
