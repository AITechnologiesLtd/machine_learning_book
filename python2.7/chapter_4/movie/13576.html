<P>Think "Dawson's Creek" meets "The Stepford Wives." Think "Beverly Hills 
90210" meets "A Clockwork Orange." Better yet, think about going to see 
anything other than "Disturbing Behavior."</P>
<P>A spoiler alert. Generally I avoid revealing significant plot points 
about movies, but I'm making an exception here because I simply don't 
care.  </P>
<P>"Disturbing Behavior" is a painfully derivative, hapless little thriller 
about small town authority figures who use computer implants and 
brainwashing techniques to turn unruly young people into Republicans. 
Unfortunately, when the Stepford teens get angry or sexually aroused, 
they become homicidal maniacs. Oh sure, this may sound like the Bob 
Dornan story, but it's really just another hack horror flick aimed at the 
"I Know What You Did Last Summer" crowd.</P>
<P>The film suffers from post-Kevin Williamson-syndrome, where writers 
desperately try to crank out the kind of pop-culture riddled, ironic 
dialogue that helped Williamson strike gold with his "Scream" movies. In 
a script packed with unconvincing slang and snarky dialogue, writer Scott 
Rosenberg comes up with only one decent line, when sarcastic teen 
outsider Gavin watches the male and female leads eyeing one another and 
says, "Wow, appropriate sparks are flying. Cue the power ballad." 
Apparently, Rosenberg knew he hit pay-dirt with the quip, because he 
actually uses it twice in the film. </P>
<P>The story, such as it is, goes like this. New kid in town Steve (James 
Marsden) moves to Cradle Bay and hooks up with the annoying Gavin (Nick 
Stahl) and sultry Rachel ("Dawson Creek's" Katie Holmes). Gavin fills 
Steve in on the town's secret of success. Rebellious teens are taken away 
for "motivational weekends" with the "Blue Ribbon Club." They return as 
well-groomed All-American archetypes, with the aforementioned ultra-
violent programming glitch. </P>
<P>Soon enough, our heroes learn that they are next on the list for 
involuntary "Blue Ribbon" membership. Oh, what to do! As the kids wring 
their hands over their pending entry into the Christian right, they 
stumble onto a handy fact. The sonic rat repellent machines the whacked-
out school janitor keeps in the basement just happen to emit a frequency 
that short circuits the Aryan youths' brains. From there on...well, you 
do the math.</P>
<P>Even material this trite could have worked in the proper hands, but these 
filmmakers just don't have a clue. David Nutter, who directed a number of 
"X-Files" episodes, relies on every stock teen horror flick cliché in the 
book, while a standard-issue rock soundtrack grinds away in the 
background. The notion of remote-controlled jocks is amusing, but 
Rosenberg wastes the satiric potential with his limp script. The cast 
doesn't help matters. Marsden and Holmes look like pouty Gap models, and 
Stahl is so irritating that in his case, the implants don't seem like 
that bad an idea.</P>
<P>With "Disturbing Behavior," it appears the dregs of summer have arrived a 
few weeks early. Incidentally, please forgive this shorter-than-usual 
article. Throwaway flicks like "Disturbing Behavior" don't warrant a 
lengthy review and besides, I have better things to do. I'm going to 
surround the next Promise Keepers convention with sonic rat repellents 
and turn them all on at once, just in case...</P>
