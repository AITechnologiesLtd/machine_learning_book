 Director:  Satoshi Kon
 Screenplay: Sadayuki Murai, novel by Yoshikazu Takeuchi
 Animation: Hideki Hamazu</P>
<P>   Ordinarily one wouldn't compare a film like "Perfect Blue" to the
highly publicized final film of Stanley Kubrick, "Eyes Wide Shut," but
since the Kubrick epitaph opened just three weeks before the
U.S. debut of Satoshi Kon's Japanese anime feature, one can't help
noting at least a marginal similarity.  In "Eyes Wide Shut," Tom
Cruise's character, Dr.  Bill Harford, is made privy to a provocative
fantasy of his wife (played by Nicole Kidman).  Bored with a lull in
her nine-year marriage, Alice Harford attempts to make her husband
jealous by telling him of a near-affair she enjoyed with a naval
officer during their marriage.  Struck hard--as though he were living
in pre-war Imperial Vienna rather than in contemporary Manhattan--the
doctor becomes discombobulated, experiencing a virtual psychotic
break.  He wanders confused through some of New York's shadier
streets, an alienated man who has lost his bearings, ending up in a
mysterious Long Island mansion which is the site of a masked orgy to
which he had not been invited.  Kubrick invites the audience to
determine whether Harford is actually experiencing his disaffection or
whether he is merely an actor in a bad, bad dream.</P>
<P>   "Perfect Blue" deals with a woman who goes through a similar
ordeal.  Like Dr. Harford, Mimi Kirigoe, is leading a solid life as an
entertainer with the respect of both those near to her and of her
followers.  But a brief series of ill-fated encounters shatters her
fragile spirit in much the way Harford is crushed by his wife's
revelation, and she undergoes a period of deranged illusions which are
so real to her that she can no longer tell the difference between
delusion and actuality.  As she regresses psychologically into violent
episodes, she becomes convinced that she is no longer the victim of a
madman's agenda but a murderer herself.</P>
<P>   If the plot evokes for you Roman Polanski's "Repulsion"--that
director's 1965 psychological shocker about the mental deterioration
of a sexually repressed girl left alone in her sister's apartment for
several days--you'd be on the money.  There is one huge difference,
however.  "Perfect Blue" is wholly animated, a genre usually known in
the U.S.  for children's features by studios like Disney, Dreamworks,
and Warner Bros., but in Japan a type of filming taken with deadly
seriousness to display violent, shocking, psychologically compelling
themes.  Cognoscenti in the West may be familiar with Katsuhiro Otomo,
currently the giant of this category, whose "Akira" adapted a Japanese
comic-book sci-fi novel to the screen, depicting a group of
motorcycle-riding, telekinetically-empowered teens living in a
post-disaster Tokyo.  Though "Akira" was produced ten years before
"Perfect Blue," it shares the newer feature's technically spectacular
excellence, but unlike "Perfect Blue," "Akira" sometimes is derailed
by confusing storytelling.</P>
<P>   Director Satoshi Kon brings Sadayuki Murai's screenplay (based on a
novel by Yoshikazu Takeuchi) to vivid life, splashing spectacularly
vivid colors to the screen as he weaves the story of Mima Kirigoe--who
at the age of 21 is a pop idol whose Spice-Girls-style singing group,
Cham, is well-liked by their fans but whose records simply cannot make
the top-100 charts.  Persuaded to switch careers against the advice of
her manager, she becomes an actress, is given a bit part in a TV
detective drama, and is conned into taking part in more graphic pieces
involving nudity, rape, and modeling for Playboy-style magazines.
While her two partners who now perform as a duet in Cham become
successful, Mima loses the moral support of her former fans, forfeits
integrity in her own mind, and begins to deteriorate psychologically.
She can no longer distinguish her role in the thrillers from the
reality of her own life, is certain that she is being watched (someone
has even created a Mima Kirigoe home page on the Internet with
information that only she could have known), and while she appears to
be stalked by a genuine psycho who has brutally stabbed several of her
associates to death, she toys with the idea that she is herself an
illusion.</P>
<P>   Since Satoshi Kon is given only eighty minutes to tell this
frightening story, he dispenses with casual development of Mima's
character--which is all to the good.  By getting right to the point,
"Perfect Blue" moves forward quickly, compelling the audience to pay
close attention to detail, to vet each action for clues.  "Perfect
Blue" delights in keeping us in the audience as off guard and clueless
as its principal character.  Like Mina we never know when the
stalker's murderous moves on her are real, a figment of her
imagination, or a component in the thriller she is staging for her TV
audience.  We are reminded of David Cronenberg's recent fantasy,
"eXistenZ," in which Allegra Geller is plunged into an acid trip,
keeping the audience without an indicator to which scenes are part of
Allegra's journey and which represent her comeback to her actual life
before the start of the experiment.</P>
<P>   The title comes from the TV movie that has employed Mima as a
performer, "Double Bind," which the staff calls "the looking-glass of
Perfect Blue."  "Perfect Blue" works so well as a psychological
thriller that at times the audience can't be blamed for forgetting
that no real people are acting in the movie.  While the picture has
been shown at festivals around the world, the U.S. appearances are in
the English-dubbed version, a technique that does detract in the least
from its effectiveness.  One can't help thinking that the novelist is
taking a stab at celebrity with its fleeting fame and ersatz ecstasy,
illuminating in his story just why so many of the rich and famous wind
up alcoholics, drug addicts, and suicides.  He may, in addition, be
criticizing the public for seeking thrills in the tastelessly erotic
rather than in the more established qualities of fine fiction.</P>
<P>   "Perfect Blue" will probably wind up screened exclusively in art
houses, but this would be a shame.  Few Americans have experienced
animation except in movies principally for the kiddies (however
well-realized).  "Perfect Blue" is a fine antidote for moviegoers who
are bored by both the formulaic and the naturalistic.  The movie is
resonant with adult themes, superbly vivid animation, and the
excitement that a good thriller even if handicapped with human actors
can provide.</P>
