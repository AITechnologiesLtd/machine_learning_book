<P>The original Babe gets my vote as the best family film since The Princess
Bride, and it's sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet
critics, both Siskel and Ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of
the year's finest films. So, naturally, when I entered the screening room
that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be
found, this notion left me puzzled. It is a rare thing for a children's
movie to be praised this highly, so wouldn't you think that every parent in
the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly
"magical" piece of work? A tad bewildered, but pleased to not have to worry
about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with
family films, I sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a
very open mind, having great expectations for the film. Looking back, I
should have taken the hint and left right when I entered the theater. </P>
<P>Believe me; I wanted to like Babe: Pig in the City. The plot seemed
interesting enough; after the events that took place in the original, Babe
the sheep-pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon. But after a
fateful encounter with a water well, Arthur Hogget (James Cromwell, who the
movie could have used alot more of) has been rendered bed-ridden for a
number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially. The only
solution that his wife (Magda Szubanski, going from delightfully charming
to downright annoying) can come up with is to make an appearance with their
new celebrity pet at a national fair (I think) and to use the money they
earn to pay off the bank (set aside for the moment the fact that they could
get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known
to the public). Problem is, the fair is being held in the middle of the
dreaded "city", a completely foreign place to both the pig and his
companion. </P>
<P>Setting the main plot in motion, Mrs. Hogget and Babe travel to the unnamed
city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help
animals, despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels. It is here
that we meet an array of eccentric characters, the most memorable being the
family of chimps led by Steven Wright. </P>
<P>Here is where the film took a wrong turn. Up until this point, I had being
having a rather enjoyable experience. The beginning featured some smart
writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one
and even an inspired moment at the airport where Mrs. Hogget is accused of
smuggling drugs. Unfortunately, the story wears thin as we are introduced
to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel, none of them being even
one-tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous Babe. </P>
<P>The main topic of discussion surrounding Babe: Pig in the City is the
question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children,
and I believe it is. At one point, a dog is hung from his neck and slowly
starts to drown. At other times, we are treated to surrealistic flash-backs
to Mrs. Hogget's full cavity search at the airport. In fact, the overall
tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing. However, that is, as they
say, neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie
anyway. The animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing
enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half, let alone entertain a
child. </P>
<P>Another problem I found with the film was it's sudden change of pacing and
tone near the end of the story. If you're going to make a darker and more
sinister sequel, fine. It may not be my cup of tea, but at least it is a
noble ambition. But to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie
and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with Mrs. Hogget swinging from
wall-to-wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls? It just didn't feel right
and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining, and the
same goes for the rest of the movie. </P>
