<P>   What do you say when you leave work on Friday
afternoon?  "Have a nice weekend."  Right?  Do you mean it? 
Maybe...that is if you even remember what you said.  But if
the five cats in Justin Kerrigan's first feature film "Human
Traffic" heard you wish them a "nice" weekend, they'd
probably roll on the floor with laughter, because "nice" is
about the last thing they want when they quit their
stupefyingly boring jobs.  These guys and gals, all in their
early twenties, are going to live during those forty-eight hours.
They're going to forget the disapproval of their bosses at the
fast food joint and the jeans store and the flak they'd get from
their parents if indeed their folks even cared.  As Jip, the
principal character and the one who mostly likely stands in for
the writer-director, "All that exists now is clubs, drugs, pubs
and parties...I'm gonna blow steam out of my head like a
screaming kettle....We're gonna get more spaced out than
Neil Armstrong ever did.  Anything could happen.  For four of
the five kids on one particular weekend in the Welsh capital
of Cardiff, this weekend is fun like no other.  For Jip (John
Simm) and his frizzy blonde friend Lulu (Lorraine Pilkington)
something really big goes down.</P>
<P>   "Human Traffic" is the story of one weekend in the lives of
five young people who meet regularly from Friday eve
through Sunday and who get their kicks from solitary
probing of web sites or sitting passively in the movie
theaters like us critics, but from rave parties that they attend
while high on the drug Ecstasy.  You'll never think of coal
miners again since, after all, you don't have to be in swinging
London or hip New York to be part of the weekend madness. 
The groovy pubs of Wales will do just fine.</P>
<P>   Kerrigan, who wrote the script to this partly surreal
adventure two years ago when he was twenty-three, has lived
the scene and knows whereof he speaks.  He opens up the
movie by having a few of these characters tell us something
about their lives. Nina (Nicola Reynolds) relates that she was
turned down by her college because she gave the wrong
answer to the interviewer who asked why she was interested
in philosophy.  Jip sells jeans, but the boss is on his back
--and Kerrigan means to show that concept quite literally, as
portrayed by cinematographer David Bennett.  The only one
enjoys what he's going during the week is Koop (Shaun
Parkes), a vinyl freak that makes even Jack Black's character
Barry (from Stephen Frears's "High Fidelity") look like a
square.  When Koop flips a record onto the turntable, the
twenty-something customers dig the beat and dance up a
storm.  </P>
<P>   "Human Traffic" follows the five for two days as they make
the rounds of the pubs, the rave clubs, their parents' homes.
While there is no real plot and much of the dialogue is
improvised by these largely unknown performers, some of the
scenes are touching while most will draw at least a smile
form the youthful, targeted audience.  The Ecstasy-popping
comes with a price, of course. On Sunday the party animals
are so down, so paranoid, that they can't even look one
another in the eye.  The paranoid Koop doesn't even need
drugs to conclude that his bird, Nina, is flirting with every man
in sight.  </P>
<P>   "Human Traffic" is neither pro- nor anti-drug, laying out
both sides of the coin.  When these guys are high, they're in
the clouds, and the regularly surreal Justin Kerrigan puts
them there--again, literally.  When Moff (Danny Dyer), the
youngest in the group, is coming down from his high, he is
surrounded by his parents and grandmother at Sunday dinner
as they tut-tut about Cardiff's callow: "They have no
discipline: they have no morality."  As Moff targets each of
the adults with his TV remote control device hitting the
forward and back buttons rapidly, he sees them repeating
their blather over and over to a rollickingly funny effect.</P>
<P>   "Human Traffic" has been compared to "Trainspotting," but
this association is at best superficial.  We can understand
every word that Kerrigan's characters say without subtitles,
there are no bathroom jokes, and we never see any of the
people actually taking the drugs or throwing up.  This is a fun
buddy movie that looks more like Kerrigan's revenge for
being rejected by every film school to which he applied--at
which point he took odd jobs for a year until he was finally
admitted.  Kerrigan utilizes the cinema for what the big
screen is intended: a visual far more than literary delight. 
"Human Traffic" proves that amateur actors using a loose
script can do just fine given a director's quixotic camerawork
and fertile imagination.  Kerrigan gives new meaning to the
term "rave review."</P>
