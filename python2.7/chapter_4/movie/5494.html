<PRE>                               THE CONVENT
                              (O CONVENTO)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  1/2</PRE>
<P>     Director Manoel De Oliveira's THE CONVENT (O CONVENTO) is the one
of those artistic film that tries so hard to be artsy that it loses all
touch with reality and with what makes an enjoyable film in the first
place.  The director does do something right.  He hires two excellent
leads, Catherine Deneuve and John Malkovich.  He then makes a really
bad decision and hires himself to write the script which is on silly
side of ridiculous and the lines are preposterous.</P>
<P>     The plot is that an American professor Michael Padovic (John
Malkovich) and his French wife Helene (Catherine Deneuve) go to the
Portuguese convent of Arrabida to find the proof of Professor Padovic's
radical theory that William Shakespeare was not British.  The good
professor has tentative evidence that Shakespeare was of Spanish and
Jewish ancestry.  At the convent he believes he will uncover conclusive
proof that his theory is valid, and he will be forever famous in the
literary field.</P>
<P>     Once there they meet some creepy people including Luis Miguel
Cintra as Baltar, Heloisa Miranda as Berta, and Leonor Silveira as
Piedade.  As the story meanders along, the audience wonders where it is
going and why, and what is the point of it all.  I could waste your
time with more details of the story, but trust me, you don't want to
know them.</P>
<P>     The acting by even the brilliant leads is mediocre at best.  The
director's pacing is atrocious.  Scenes drag by at a glacial speed.
The editing (Manoel De Oliveira and Valerie Loiseleux) has no sense of
timing.  The cinematography (Mario Barroso) looks like many of the
scenes were filmed with the back of the camera open so that light
pollution almost ruined the film.  I am sure this did not happen so why
so many scenes are so washed out as to be almost unwatchable is
something I could never figure out.</P>
<P>     The worst part of movie has to be the music (Sofia Gubaidulina,
Toshiro Mayuzumi, and Igor Stravinsky).  It is so overscored and loud
at inappropriate moments that it seems to be a caricature of a bad
musical score.</P>
<P>     Is there anything good in this mess of a movie?  Only one.
Catherine Deneuve, now in her 50s, proves that real beauty is eternal.</P>
<P>     THE CONVENT runs only 1:30, but it will seem like a life sentence.
It is mainly in English, but when other languages are used there are
English subtitles.  It is not rated, but who cares since people of all
ages should avoid this bomb.  I give it 1/2 of a star only for
Deneuve's everlasting radiance.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
