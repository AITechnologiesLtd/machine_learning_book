<P>28 DAYS (2000) by JOHN SYLVA, associate of OFCS (www.ofcs.org)    </P>
<PRE>Rating: A-</PRE>
<P>Consider it for a moment.  Think about having to give up your hobby or passion
for 28 straight days.  Whether it is smoking, gambling, a loved one, or in my
case the internet- How could you possibly survive those grueling days without
it?  Every ordinary American has an addiction, and Gwen Cummings, an ordinary
American, has an addiction, and for her that addiction is alcohol and pain
pills.  After a troubling turn of events, Gwen will be admitted to a
rehabilitation center for 28 days, not able to have an ounce of alcohol, or
even one her pain pills that she so loves. As the film progresses, we see her
learn and grow as a person, as she realizes that her lifestyle is no way to
live.  The plot sounds schmaltzy and shallow, but the Betty Thomas flick "28
Days" brings the pain that Gwen (Sandra Bullock) must live through into a
touching reality, in a way that is both humorous yet dramatic, powerful yet
light.</P>
<P>Gwen Cummings is a character of charisma, tragedy, and self centeredness; What
one would consider the life of the party.  That is, before she gets a life. 
After making a scene (not to mention ruining it as well) at her sister's
wedding, followed by a house/car accident, Gwen is admitted to the Serenity
Glen rehabilitation center, where every night and day is filled with plenty of
soberness, chants, prayers, and "Lean on Me."  Gwen slowly comes to the
realization that she needs to grow up and give up what has made a complete mess
of her life, alcohol.  Along the way, Gwen befriends a number of other
patients, including her coke addict roommate Andrea (Azura Skye), and clean cut
baseball player Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortenson), whom she grows a deep affection
for.</P>
<P>"28 Days" bends between a fine line of comedy and drama it's entire 103 minute
running time, presenting both the comedic and dramatic elements of alcoholism
and ultimately overcoming it.  The latter is shown mostly through effective
flashbacks, showing Gwen's mother's problems with alcohol that resulted in her
death, and the comedic element brought through the rehab center's obsession
with the campy soap opera "Santa Cruz."  The pacing is perfect, with everything
meshing together nicely, thanks to Susannah Grant's superb screenplay.  </P>
<P>Almost everything is shining brightly in "28 Days," but nothing is shining half
as bright as Sandra Bullock.  Bullock digs herself out of a hole that she was
in as a result of films such as 1998's horrid "Practical Magic" and 1999's
mediocre "Forces of Nature."  Bullock is realistic and touching as her troubled
character, fulfilling her character's hardships as an alcoholic flawlessly.  </P>
<P>"28 Days" is a film that doesn't delve deep into the psychological aspects of
addiction, instead it just focuses on the lighter human aspects, ones that any
human being can relate to and understand with ease.  At one point, we see Gwen
at a stage so horrible that she is shaking, her face pale as ghost; She's at a
stage of total hazard.  Scenes like this in "28 Days" make it easy to relate
to, although we never completely understand all of the elements of Gwen's life
or her background, or how her mind works, but the point is that we don't need
to.  Because the film is so effortless and light, anyone can sit down and
relate to her character's life.  "28 Days" has its flaws, but if you can look
past the fact that the story has been done before, and that it's not
necessarily the best thing since sliced bread, you'll find yourself a nice
little slice of life.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line: Bullock gives an amazing performance in a simple, touching
film. A treasure.</P>
