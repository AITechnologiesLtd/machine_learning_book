<PRE>I Know What You Did Last Summer</PRE>
<PRE>Chad'z rating: ** (out of 4 = fair)</PRE>
<P>1997, R, 100 minutes [1 hour, 40 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[horror]</PRE>
<P>starring: Jennifer Love Hewitt (Julie), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Helen), Ryan
Phillippe (Barry), Freddie Prinze Jr. (Ray); written by Kevin Williamson;
produced by Stokely Chaffin, Erik Feig, Neal H. Moritz; directed by Jim
Gillespie; based on the novel by Lois Duncan.</P>
<P>Seen Monday, November 3, 1997 at 9:20 p.m.Glenwood Movieplex Cinemas,
(Oneida, NY), theater #7 (theater rating: **1/2 - low volume, small screen,
slightly uncomfortable seats, theater not dark enough), by myself for free
(free press pass).</P>
<P>The horror genre, or more specifically, the slasher genre, is attempting at
a comeback whether we want it to or not. What's interesting this time around
is that, unlike the completely brain dead flicks of the 1970s and 80s, horror
films of today are written and presented with complete logic, which is
somewhat commendable. "I Know What You Did Last Summer" is a perfect example
of this as it's relatively plausible, but all the logic in the world can't
make up for using every cliche in the book.</P>
<P>The story starts off like any horror movie as we meet our main characters -
four GenXers living in a small fishing town on the North Carolina coast (none
of them have Southern accents though). The first 15 - 20 minutes rushes to
define the one-dimensional characters and establish some kind of back story. </P>
<P>First there's Julie (Hewitt), the generic
strong-willed-girl-in-a-horror-movie. Then there's her friend Helen (Gellar),
the blonde bimbo, and her boyfriend Barry (Phillippe), the short-tempered
jock. There's also Julie's boyfriend Ray (Prinze Jr.), the quiet, sensitive
guy. Let's not forget Max (Johnny Galecki), the jealous outsider who will
become the first suspect once things get rolling. </P>
<P>It's the fourth of July and after Helen wins a beauty contest, the four
drive out to the beach, drink a little, fool around, tell the urban legend of
"The Man With The Hook," and on the way back accidentally run over a man.
They realize if they go to the police they could be charged with
manslaughter, so they decide to throw the body into the ocean even though he
doesn't seem to be entirely dead (my first clue was when he opened his eyes
and tried to strangle them). Everything that had happened up to this point
had been believable and entertaining, but then you really have to wonder why
they believe their plan will work.</P>
<P>We then flashforward to one year later as Julie returns home from college
and receives an anonymous letter (hence the title). The four get together and
try to figure out who could have sent it. They're convinced it's Max, but the
most obvious suspect is always the first to die. </P>
<P>The mid-section of the film showed promise. The gang does some detective
work which is quite interesting and realistic in the way they go about it
(using the Internet), and it seems like the killer (someone in a slicker and
rain hat with a hook but no face) might be a relative of the person they ran
over. But this is a horror film, not a mystery, and soon we're back to scenes
of the killer turning corners before the kids see him and hiding in shadows
and closets. The killer messes with their heads, often hurting them
physically, but doesn't always kill them. </P>
<P>Much like he did with his screenplay to "Scream," writer Kevin Williamson
makes it seem like almost anyone could be the killer. Unfortunately, once we
realize this the cliches start kicking in full throttle, such as the killer
standing behind someone and killing them with hundreds of people around. Or
the chase scene where the killer walks, but the victim runs and never seems
to be able to get away. Then there's stuff that's idiotic such as when
regular people are killed, or the victim who tries to get into and out of a
building with locks on the inside!</P>
<P>The ending is the worst of the cliches - a supposedly suspense finale on a
fishing boat with lots of places to hide but nowhere to run. There's a fist
fight, a heroic rescue, and a revelation of the killer and their motives. In
the end justice is served.... or so it seems.</P>
<P>"I Know What You Did Last Summer" ultimately fails because it tries to have
the best of both worlds - as both a plausible horror film and a horrific
plausible film. But as they old saying goes, you can't have your cake and eat
it too.</P>
