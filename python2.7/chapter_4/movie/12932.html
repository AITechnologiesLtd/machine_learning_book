<P>BULWORTH
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: *** (out of ****) 
20th Century Fox / 1:47 / 1998 / R (language, violence)
Cast: Warren Beatty; Halle Berry; Oliver Platt; Jack Warden; Don 
Cheadle; Paul Sorvino; Joshua Malina; Richard Sarafian;
Sean Astin; Laurie Metcalf; Isaiah Washington; Christine Baranski 
Director: Warren Beatty 
Screenplay: Warren Beatty, Jeremy Pikser<HR>The most memorable image of the 1998 summer movie season is here early, 
and it isn't a giant lizard making waste out of the MetLife Building. 
Rather, it's the sight of Warren Beatty donning wrap-around glasses, a 
skull cap and low-riding shorts near the end of "Bulworth," a lively, 
energetic political satire that he also directed and co-wrote. 
"Bulworth" is quite a bit of fun despite one or two questionable 
subplots and a finale that gets a little too serious for its own good, 
but it's probably best not to fault a film that at least attempts to 
comment on serious societal ills, especially one that, for the most 
part, succeeds. You could also whine that "Bulworth"'s premise is too 
one-joke, but the joke is a humdinger, so why carp? </P>
<P>Beatty plays Jay Billington Bulworth, an incumbent California senator 
who finds himself fed up with the glaring falsehoods of his personal and 
professional life -- his political agenda is full of empty promises, his 
marriage is a sham and his re-election TV spots are so phony that they 
move him to tears. Before hitting the weekend campaign trail through 
South Central L.A., Bulworth secretly makes his teenage daughter the 
sole beneficiary of a $10 million life insurance policy and orders a hit 
on himself to be carried out sometime within the several-day time frame. 
But the knowledge that he doesn't have much longer to live allows him, 
for once, to tell it like it is free of consequence. Bulworth finally 
has a reason to live, yet he could die at any given moment. </P>
<P>Although the hitman storyline acts as a plot catalyst and even throws a 
little intrigue into "Bulworth"'s ripe comedic agenda, it ends up 
largely distracting, mostly due to a related, uninspired twist that pops 
out of nowhere late in the film. Come to think of it, "Bulworth"'s whole 
last quarter could use a little touch-up, since it is here where quite a 
strong movie begins to encounter its share of problems. In particular, 
the African-American characters are underdeveloped, and Bulworth's 
interaction with them in the film's final passages is rather hazy. The 
ending -- especially the sermonizing last scene where "Bulworth"'s 
message is explicitly spelled out for the audience -- has a good chance 
at leaving a bad taste in many viewer's mouths. </P>
<P>But because Beatty is on the screen during these troubled chapters, 
"Bulworth" is all the more hard to discredit. He gives an electrifying 
performance, maintaining dignity and strength even when Bulworth crudely 
raps his exchanges with a CNN interviewer or giddily searches for his 
favorite expletives in the record collection of an urban nightclub; 
Beatty never turns Jay Bulworth into the walking punchline that he very 
easily could have been. Gorgeous Halle Berry fares very well in an 
ambiguous supporting role as a homegirl whose growing loyalty to the 
senator might lead to something more, but Oliver Platt steals scenes 
from everyone -- except Beatty, who even steals scenes from himself -- 
as Bulworth's chronically distressed aide. </P>
<P>So while "Bulworth" may grow uneven as it quickly heads toward its iffy 
destination, the trip there is assuredly rewarding, mixing mirth and 
morals in the flawless way that eventually (and sadly) eludes the 
screenplay. Among the fun to be had is a number of crowd-pleasing scenes 
where the game as ever Beatty raps the truth, a gag that threatens to 
both grow old and grate but surprisingly does neither. I'm sorta partial 
to the movie's first big production number, set at a large political 
rally, but a brief luncheon with Hollywood's elite also hits the 
bullseye. There, Beatty criticizes the gathered filmmakers for churning 
out large doses of "crap." Were "Bulworth" a lesser movie, it would be 
guilty of hypocrisy. But thankfully, it isn't.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck
