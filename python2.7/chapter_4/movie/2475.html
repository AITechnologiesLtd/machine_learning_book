<P>     The simplest and most honest expression of praise that I can offer
Mike Newell's latest movie is that this represents two hours of solid
movie magic.  FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL is a film with the rare
ability to make an audience laugh (and laugh hard) and cry, without
ever seeming manipulative or going hopelessly over-the-top.</P>
<P>     Charles (Hugh Grant), now in his fourth decade of life, is a
"serial monogamist"--someone who moves from girlfriend to girlfriend
without ever falling in love.  His friends have started down the
matrimonial road, but not Charles.  Thoughts of spending the rest of
his life with someone never enter his head, until one day at a wedding
when he encounters Carrie (Andie MacDowell), an American fashion
editor.  And, although the two enjoy a brief tryst at an inn, Charles'
typical British reticence kicks in, and Carrie is on her way back to
America before he realizes he should have said something.</P>
<P>     FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL is about, well, four weddings and a
funeral (actually, if you want to be picky, it's about three weddings,
a funeral, and another wedding).  While the central story of this
charming motion picture is fairly common romantic comedy fare, it is
framed in a plot filled with little twists and turns, lots of laughs,
and a frothy atmosphere that is nothing short of intoxicating.</P>
<P>     Mike Newell, whose recent directing credits include ENCHANTED
APRIL and INTO THE WEST, continues to show a deft hand when it comes to
good, escapist fun.  Mr. Newell's direction is understated--he allows
his actors and the script to carry the film, which results in a
satisfying mix of lighthearted comedy with a dash or two of pathos
(including an emotional reading of W.H. Auden).</P>
<P>     Screenwriter Richard Curtis (who also penned THE TALL GUY) is
quick to let the humor start flowing, and once it starts, it never
stops (although it slows a little during the film's second half,
especially during the funeral).  The scenes most likely to cause
uncontrollable laughter occur during the second wedding and center on
Rowan Atkinson as a somewhat confused priest.  That Mr. Atkinson feels
at home with a Curtis script isn't surprising, since the two
collaborated on the British TV show BLACKADDER.</P>
<P>     Hugh Grant, currently stealing scenes in SIRENS, is equally as
good here, playing a likeable if somewhat twitty character.  This is
truly a case of perfect casting, as there's no scene, whether comic or
serious, that Mr. Grant is incapable of carrying off.  In the process,
he evokes memories of a young David Niven.</P>
<P>     Andie MacDowell, playing opposite Grant, is perhaps somewhat less
of a perfect choice, but she's more than adequate as the carefree
American who connects with Charles.  The supporting cast varies from
good to excellent, and features a number of vaguely-familiar faces for
those who are used to watching productions from across the Atlantic.</P>
<P>     FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL is a modern comedy with a very
traditional theme.  It blends good breeding and bad language; laughter
and tears; and marriage and friendship into a thoroughly enjoyable
result.  Mike Newell knows what his viewers want, but appreciates them
enough not to give it in a predictable or obvious manner--and that is
the greatest pleasure of all in watching this movie.</P>
