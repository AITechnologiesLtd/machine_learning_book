<P>"Tour de force", would be classic euphemism for this film which hits
you with the force of a fifteen pound sledgehammer smashing into your
skull.</P>
<P>Well, the movie is about a butcher in Paris (superbly played by
Philippe Nahon) who has been released from prison following a stint on
assault charges (for stabbing an innocent person whom he suspected of
trying to rape his autistic daughter) and finds himself alone, jobless,
angry and depressed. He meets a fat salon keeper, who becomes his
mistress, and they move out to the country, but let's say that things
don't quite work out for them.</P>
<P>So, he returns to Paris in the hope of finding a job, but that proves
to be a futile exercise. All his friends are either destitute or don't
care a damn about him. Thus begins his long and nihilistic journey to
the edge of the abyss, and possibly beyond, but that's for you to judge
at the end of the film. As usual, I won't go into the details of what
transpires as it spoils the experience of people who haven't watched
the film yet.</P>
<P>Suffice it to say the director Gaspar Noé, who wrote, directed (and I
think shot, and edited it as well), has created a brilliant, shocking,
and unforgettable film, certainly one the year's best, IMO.</P>
<P>However, be warned, be very warned, that this isn't a film for the
squeamish, weak hearted and such, and even people who could stand
movies like "Happiness", might have a hard time sitting through it. The
film is disturbing on even on a physical level, and the loud gunshots
that accompany several quick cuts can be particularly unsettling.</P>
