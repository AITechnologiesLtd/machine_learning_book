<PRE>                                    THE 'BURBS
                       A film review by Shane R. Burridge
                        Copyright 1996 Shane R. Burridge</PRE>
<PRE>(1989) 97m.  </PRE>
<P>     Director Joe Dante has an affection for small-town communities,
even when he's unleashing all manner of havoc upon them.  It's evident
in his films, and is the subject of his 1991 television series EERIE,
INDIANA.  It should come as no surprise, then, to see his involvement
in THE 'BURBS, a film devoted to the subject.  Story takes place in the
suburb of Hinkley Hills, where enigmatic, unseen neighbors have just
moved into the rundown house next door to Tom Hanks and wife Carrie
Fisher.  Egged on by a couple of his neighbors, Hanks' paranoia about
the new arrivals escalates to absurd heights.  Picture runs out of
steam before the end, as the more recognizable idiosyncrasies of
suburbia in the opening sequences give way to situations that become
increasingly outlandish, preventing the film from becoming the
definitive statement on suburban neuroses that many moviegoers were no
doubt hoping for.  But if THE 'BURBS doesn't live up to its premise, it
still works effectively as a kind of goofy homage to suburbanites.
Dante's tendency towards cartoonish fantasy planes all satirical edges
off the story: the neighborhood he gives us is the type of communal
playground we would have liked to remember as children; a place of
eccentric, comical inhabitants (Bruce Dern, Rick Ducommun, and Corey
Feldman, to name a few), a weird gothic house (placed right in the
middle of a cul-de-sac!), friendly feuding, spying, night-time strolls,
and intrigue.  The film ends with the enthusiastic line "I love this
street", and by that time it's easy to share the sentiment.  We realize
that the characters belong in their suburban niche.</P>
<P>     As with other Dante films, THE 'BURBS is rife with references to
films and television - and his entire neighborhood set seems to be a
product of that as much as any other source.  Feldman invites friends
over to watch a scene unfolding on the street as if it were part of a
movie (which it is), and describes the activities of his neighbors to a
date as if they were characters in a story (which they are).  Dante
fans are used to such self-referential treatment -- as usual, he puts
his personal stamp on everything.  One of my favorite sequences is
nothing more than a walk down a path, which Dante shoots in flinty-eyed
Sergio Leone-style closeups.  It would be hard not to think that the
cast must have had a ball making the movie -- even Dern plays it
strictly for laughs, for a change.   I can't help thinking it would
come over better late at night at a drive-in.  A good companion piece
would be the surreal 1981 film NEIGHBORS.  Other faces on the street
include: Henry Gibson, Gale Gordon, and Dante regulars Robert Picardo
and Dick Miller.  Music by Jerry Goldsmith, who, in keeping with the
film's in-joke style, drops in themes from his score for PATTON.</P>
