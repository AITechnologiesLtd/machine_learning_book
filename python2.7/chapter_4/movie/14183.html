<P>Plot: At The Kingdom hospital in Copenhagen, Stig Helmer returns from 
Haiti with a potion with which he intends to turn his rival Kroshoj into 
a zombie but this goes astray and Stig must find and revive Kroshoj's 
corpse before he is arrested for murder. Meanwhile Judith, having been 
impregnated by the ghost of Dr Aage Krueger, has given birth to a freak 
baby which has an adult's head, a giant elongated body and a soul that 
is half-human, half-Devil, and is now wanted by Aage Krueger who is in 
reality Satan.</P>
<P>The 1994 Danish four-part tv mini-series `The Kingdom' was given a 
cinematic release in arthouse theatres in English-speaking countries 
where it was split into two two and-a-half hour parts. There the name of 
co-director Lars von Trier, then riding high on the success of 1991's 
Cannes hit `Zentropa' aka `Europa', was sufficient to carry it to 
audiences. The result was a delightfully eccentric piece of black comedy 
that suggested a head-on collision between `Twin Peaks' and `ER'. The 
series however was left unfinished, ending on the cliffhanger of the 
birth of the ghost-impregnated baby and a `to be continued' credit. But 
true to their word von Trier, co-director Morton Arnfred and the entire 
cast return here three years later to continue the saga, which once 
again aired as a four-part mini-series in Denmark and has elsewhere been 
released as a theatrical two-parter.</P>
<P>However `The Kingdom II', although not unenjoyable, is a relative 
disappointment over its predecessor. There is a certain ricketiness to 
the story. It comes with the distinct sense that von Trier and Arnfred 
are not so much continuing a story that is waiting to be completed than 
they are fairly much making the saga up as they go along. Many aspects 
of the original have undergone noticeable changes. The character of Dr 
Aage Krueger (played by Udo Kier) goes from the shadowy figure of a 
doctor who killed a young girl in the first mini-series to now become 
The Devil himself; the ghost ambulance from the first mini-series is now 
unconvincingly passed off as being a group of med students conducting 
daredevil bets. And the pivotal character of Mary, the ghost of the 
little girl that haunted the hospital in the first mini-series, is 
almost entirely dropped from the sequel bar a token dream appearance. 
Further the tone of the second series seems to have changed somewhat - 
with the sidelining of the character of Mary and the sequel's principal 
concentration on the more mundane fates of the various lead characters, 
the series loses much of the eerie sense of otherworldliness that 
hovered over the first series. Although there is some substitute in the 
bizarre scenes with Udo Kier playing a baby that has an adult head and a 
twelve-foot tall elongated body, wailing to his mother and cooingly 
dreaming of the future they might lead together.</P>
<P>This series at times feels overly long but it is largely carried by its 
sense of black comedy. Chief among which is Ernst Hugo Jaregard's 
hilarious performance once again as the conniving, disgruntled Swedish 
surgeon. There are some highly amusing scenes in his ongoing battles to 
avoid bailiffs or in mixing up which coffee cup he has placed a voodoo 
potion in during a staff conference or his plans to zombify his rival 
which keep going wrong. Birthe Neumann has an extremely funny part as an 
overly efficient secretary, who, after the decision that costs must be 
kept down by buying low denomination stamps, pops up to ask whereabouts 
on a letter entirely covered by stamps she is meant to place the 
address. Although the most hysterical sequence in the entire film is the 
character of a Jamaican faith healer who wanders in to heal a concussed 
Kirsten Rolffes and removes a large clump of bloody tissue from the back 
of her head and eats it, noting "It's the next best substitute since 
they took the Vitamin C out of Danish beer."</P>
<P>The biggest downside to the sequel is the end credit `to be continued' 
and the realization that one has sat through another five hours with no 
end in sight and that this means another three years and another five 
hours to wait for the saga to be wrapped up, if that.</P>
