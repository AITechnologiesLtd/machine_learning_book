Susan Granger's review of "IDLE HANDS" (Columbia Pictures/Sony Releasing)</P>
<P>        In the light of the tragic high-school massacre in Littleton,
Colorado, this ill-timed horror-comedy is so ghoulish and repulsive
that there's no excuse for it. Frankly, I think it should be
voluntarily withdrawn by the studio. But, since it's on the screen in
local theaters, here goes. Devon Sawa plays a vapid, pot-smoking 17
year-old whose hand becomes possessed by a murderous evil
spirit. "Idle hands are the devil's playpen" is the explanation he's
given. He kills his parents and many of those unlucky enough to be
around him until he cuts off the homicidal appendage with a meat
cleaver and microwaves it. First-time screenwriters Teri Hughes and
Ron Milbauer and director Rodman Flender (TV's "Dawson's Creek,"
"Chicago Hope") devise numerous grisly, blood-drenched deaths and
manage to have greenish corpses rise from the dead to become devilish,
wise-cracking zombies. Then there's Viveca A. Fox, supposedly
descended from a long line of Druid priestesses, who arrives in town
with her sacred dagger. Plus Sawa's girl-friend, Jessica Alba, and the
other freaked-out guests at a Halloween costume party who are doomed
for disaster. The most offensive scene, however, pokes fun at the
mourners at the funeral of two youngsters. On the Granger Movie Gauge
of 1 to 10, "Idle Hands" is barely a distasteful, disgusting 1 - and
definitely not for the squeamish. If this is what teenagers want as
entertainment, as a society, we're in deeper trouble than we realize.</P>
