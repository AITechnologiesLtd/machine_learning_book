<P>_Austin_Powers:_The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>_Austin_Powers_ is one pop culture phenomenon that has flown clear over
my head.  The shagadelic spy's first screen outing, 1997's
_International_Man_of_Mystery_--whose box office grosses topped out at
just north of $50 million, yet became a sensation on video--was
definitely a likable, high-energy affair, but for me, that wasn't enough
to redeem a script whose hit-and-miss stabs at humor were more amusingly
silly than genuinely hilarious.  The bigger, though not necessarily
better, sequel, _The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_, doesn't pretend to be anything
more than it is--more of the same.  Whether or not that's a good thing,
however, depends on who you are: fans of the original are indeed likely
to find this installment to be groovy (as did the rowdy fans at my
screening), but for me, it was another scattershot adventure with a few
good chuckles but not quite as funny as it believes it is--or should be.</P>
<P>One of the key problems I had with the original film was that about
three-quarters of the way through, the schtick of Austin Powers (Mike
Myers) was exhausted.  He's a defrosted British secret agent still stuck
in the swinging '60s who is perpetually up for a shag and believes
himself to be irresistibly sexy.  That's it.  By the time he performed
his climactic striptease to "I Touch Myself," I wasn't laughing but
silently grinning, if even that.</P>
<P>After _The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ gets past a brief prologue that writes
off the love interest of the previous film, Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth
Hurley), the film dives headlong into an elaborate credit sequence:
Austin prances through a hotel in the buff (with strategically placed
props, natch), culminating in an Esther Williams-style aquatic production
number.  Once this is all over, Austin is, to borrow one of his catch
phrases, "spent"--creatively speaking.  It's not so much that Myers,
co-writer Michael McCullers, and returning director Jay Roach do nothing
new with Austin in terms of story (again, he must thwart the
magalomaniacal Dr. Evil, who has travelled back in time to 1969 to steal
Austin's "mojo") than in terms of his thin character.  Austin's "Yeah,
baby!" one-liners, retro wardrobe, bad teeth, and swinging attitude--all
mined for their entire worth and then some in
_International_Man_of_Mystery_--haven't gotten better, just older.  Even
the diehards in the audience got bored; after Austin's umpteenth scene
transition dance number, one once-howling fan was overheard saying, "That
was stupid."</P>
<P>For me, Austin's archnemesis, the idiotic, hopelessly square, but no
less dastardly Dr. Evil (also played by Myers) was always more
interesting.  Surprisingly, _The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ focuses more on him
than it does Austin, and the film benefits from that fact.  Unlike their
laissez-faire treatment of Austin, Myers and company have actually taken
Dr. Evil in a fresh direction.  In the first film, Dr. Evil's antiquated
'60s sensibilities clashed with those of the '90s; in this one, the
opposite is the case, with his new pseudo-hip, ultra '90s mentality a
jarring anachronism in 1969.  It sounds less than inspired in concept,
but in execuation it fuels the film's best moments, most of which involve
his new midget clone Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer), whom a doting Dr. Evil
prefers to his black sheep biological son Scott (Seth Green, also
returning).</P>
<P>The rest of the film is a study in give and take.  Heather Graham cuts a
shagadelic figure as Austin's new sidekick/love interest, CIA agent
Felicity Shagwell, but Hurley's icy hauteur in the first film made for a
more effective foil.  As enjoyable as the bulk of Mini-Me's antics are,
his knock-down, drag-out fight with Austin is a less effective retread of
the MTV Movie Award-winning Ben Stiller-Puffy the Dog confrontation in
_There's_Something_About_Mary_.  Rob Lowe does an even better Robert
Wagner than Wagner himself as the '60s incarnation of Dr. Evil's yes-man
Number Two (Wagner also briefly reprises his role as the '90s Number
Two), but he is underutilized.</P>
<P>As with the original film, my just-OK assessment of
_Austin_Powers:_The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ is sure to be in the minority,
and the film's certain success will cement _Austin_Powers_ as a New Line
franchise.  And as lukewarm as my take on these first two films are, I'd
welcome a third--that is, if there can somehow be an _Austin_Powers_ film
without Austin himself.</P>
