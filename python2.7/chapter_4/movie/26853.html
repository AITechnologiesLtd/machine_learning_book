Prudishly and illogically rated R (for Navymen's salty language)</P>
<P>Biopics (biographical picture) have been a staple genre since movies 
began. They--including Hollywood productions--are overwhelmingly 
"creative," readjust fancifully the lives of notable persons, invent, 
adapt, prettify... and make historians despair.</P>
<P>Yet many of those films have been major hits. For example, the movies 
directed by German-born actor and director William Dieterle who 
achieved fame and glory with a string of  MGM pictures with great 
actors: "The Story of Louis Pasteur" (1936), "The Life of Emile Zola" 
(1937), "Juarez" (1939),  "Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet" (1940), "A 
Dispatch from Reuters" (1940), "Tennessee Johnson" (1942).</P>
<P>There have been movies about baseball greats like Lou Gehrig, "Pride 
of the Yankees" (1942); about a remarkable polio-treating nurse, 
"Sister Kenny" (1946); about the famous nurse Florence Nightingale in 
"White Angel" (1936) (by Dieterle) or in the British "Lady with a 
Lamp" (1951); about "Nurse Edith Cavell" (1939), that brave woman 
who, during World War I,  helped Allied soldiers escape 
German-occupied Belgium and ended up before a firing squad. The list 
is enormous.</P>
<P>In the heyday of biopics (the 1930s and 1940s) the world was younger, 
the audiences more naive than now, the film critics fewer and less 
sophisticated, at least when dealing with history of the big screen. 
But flights of fancy and non-scholarship notwithstanding, those 
movies contributed a great deal to educating their spectators. The 
biopics were a wonderful  introduction to facts and persons which 
only a small fraction of the masses knew anything about or even had 
ever heard of.</P>
<P>Today, in the area of films about real people and events, the more 
discriminating viewers and reviewers are more demanding than in the 
past,  The case of "Men of Honor" is another litmus test.</P>
<P>It is "based on" (words that ring the alarm bell) the life of Carl 
Brashear who was the first black to be accepted (grudgingly) to the 
Navy's Salvage school. He became an ace deep-sea diver and later a 
role model hero.</P>
<P>In those days (late 1950s on) the Armed Forces were officially 
integrated, but there was still no lack of violent, rampant racism. 
It took superhuman will, tenacity, patience as well as talent to get 
to where Carl Brashear got. So what we have here is a feel-good movie 
and a feel-bad one rolled into one during two-plus hours of 
spectacle.  But how many of the details are true and how many are 
Hollywood?</P>
<P>What rings truest is the feel-bad side. Carl was the son of a 
Kentucky sharecropper whose struggle to survive is realistically 
shown as pure horror. Sad and powerful too are most of the many 
episodes of Brashear's painful rise within a white and openly hostile 
military milieu. Without revealing the march of events, it is obvious 
to me that this huge and painful aspect of the movie is its best 
element.</P>
<P>The feel-good part is another story. Robert De Niro plays Billy 
Sunday, a super-talented Master Chief and Carl's immediate superior 
at diving school. Billy is a rebellious, authority-defying maverick, 
an alcoholic at some point, and while superior at his job, flawed in 
many other ways. Yet he will turn out to be a man with a conscience.</P>
<P>All this could be true, but is it? And all his is vitiated by 
bucketfuls of movie cliches, excessive  colorfulness, improbable 
dialogue and speechmaking, paint by numbers progression, and much 
else that required a suspension of disbelief.</P>
<P>This story also echoes  quantities of movies that feature 
tougher-than-hell D.I.s,  movies about Marines shaping up on Parris 
Island, movies with typically Hollywoodian moments complete with Big 
Emotions made even bigger by a Too Big Musical Score.</P>
<P>De Niro, who at times is like a parody of Douglas MacArthur plus 
Popeye, has had better roles, though even  here, his being De Niro 
does salvage some of the silliness.</P>
<P>Even so, in the footage of Sarl and Billy, the two leading 
characters, when their personal lives are depicted the film piles up 
unconvincing or phony or cute passages. A sampling, in no order of 
priority:</P>
<P>In the opening scenes in Kentucky, we glimpse the boy Carl's 
beautiful mother. She is oddly chic within a context of people who 
live in misery --at least I remember her as elegant. The romance 
between Carl and and a lady librarian plus medical student is 
touching, partly because Jo (Aunjanue Ellis) is good and appealing. 
But the war hero commandant of the diving school (Holbrook) is so 
totally gaga that his mega-racism is ludicrous and ineffectual, more 
a mental case than anything else. Worse yet, Gwen (Charlize Theron) 
who seems to be De Niro's child-wife, is a totally useless, unclear 
and unneeded character.</P>
<P>Where the guillotine's blade falls is in the last sequence, set in a 
military courtroom. It is so "inspirational," colorful, sentimental 
and fabricated that the audience should be provided with certificates 
of authenticity.</P>
<P>The film does keep you going, does perform a good service by 
acquainting us with the unusual and admirable Carl Brashear, but is 
also as untrustworthy as the near totality of biopics. One would 
think that in the second century of movies there must be ways to 
maximize veracity and minimize theatrics. Yet the picture does have a 
saving grace -- in that it deals clearly with the scourge of racism. 
This can make us forgive "Men of Honor" many of its sins.</P>
<P>Technically it's A-1 and, I suppose, true to deep-sea procedures in 
sequences that make the divers in heavy gear look like immigrants 
from Jules Verne and "20,000 Leagues under the Sea."</P>
