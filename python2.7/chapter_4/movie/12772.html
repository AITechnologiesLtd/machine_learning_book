<P>   It's one of those stories where you're out late walking through a bad
neighborhood, back alley, empty parking garage or seedy bar,
etc.,you know you shouldn't have been in in the first place...</P>
<P>    At one point or another almost all of my friends have related their
own personal ‘wrong place/wrong time' adventure(s) to me. Less
than half but more than a couple of these stories have a similar plot
thread: The highest point of anxiety was when the person was
approached by a big black guy.  Now, what you can't pick up from reading
this is the intonation used on the words "big BLACK
guy". It's almost a verbal wink which suggests that the extra fear is so
universal that even I, being black myself, should understand
and sympathize.
    *Sigh*
    I don't blame my friends or even bother to get annoyed by this
anymore. These are intelligent, liberal-minded people who are as
susceptible as the rest of us to the negative images bombarding us
everyday. Not so much from anything as blatant as the news but
from many more ‘harmless' forms of entertainment that access our
subconscious regularly.
    Take for example the much beloved sitcom CHEERS. It was certainly MY
favorite show when it was on. During it's eleven year
run CHEERS managed to have only one black character...for all of two
episodes. He was Louis:  a BIG, black, lazy and incompetent
mailman (oxymoron?) with a deep voice and a violent streak. The two
episodes (which were both very funny) centered around Cliff
running around scared that Louis was going to beat him up for getting
him fired. Now, I don't think that CHEERS is evil or that there's
anything inherently wrong with ‘Louis', except for the ratio. In eleven
years(!!) on America's most popular tv show there was not one
other black person  to contrast him with,  thus he added to the already
growing stereotype.
    I could site hundreds of more examples but what would be the point,
really? Neither of us wants me to suit up and fight every
dragon out there. I  mostly try to stay out of it...Still, sometimes a
man's gotta do what a man's gotta do...</P>
<P> ...BULWORTH is the story of conservative Democratic senator, J.
Bulworth (Warren Beatty), who suffers a nervous breakdown and
begins publically telling the bitter ugly truth about what goes on
behind the scenes in American politics, much to the chagrin of his
staff and the establishment...he's also taken out a $10 million policy
with the insurance lobby, put out a contract on himself and yadda,
yadda, yadda..."hilarity ensues".</P>
<P>   The political moments of BULWORTH are inspired and biting in their
candor. What's more shocking than what Warren Beatty says
is that he's allowed to say it. For example, when addressing the
congregation of a black church J.Bulworth is asked why he hasn't
fulfilled his promises to minority voters and his response is "Well, you
haven't contributed any money to my campaign, have you?". He
goes on to explain that the insurance and tobacco lobbies DO finance the
very expensive campaign he needs to stay in office which
puts him pretty much in their pocket. In fact, he implicates Clinton,
Bush and all politicians as being caught up in the standard S.O.B.
corruption of the machine. Okay, so if you listen to NPR or Pacifica
News everyday the movie just confirms what you've already
pieced together.
   BULWORTH spares almost no one and some of these moments are genius
(if you consider telling the truth ‘genius'). In one scene
Halle Berry's character gives a valid explanation as to why there are no
definitive black leaders these days...Unfortunately, she spews it
as if she were auditioning for a MicroMachines commercial...AND it's the
only intelligent dialogue to come out of a black characters
mouth in the entire movie.
     The film is most successful when J.Bulworth is ‘kicking the
knowledge', but the other 80% is banal and insulting- and not in the
way you might think.  J.Bulworth is no more offensive than Melvin Udall
(AS GOOD AS IT GETS) or Archie Bunker, both who I
loved. BULWORTH is extremely insulting in it's portrayal of black
people. It's as if everything Warren Beatty (who also wrote and
directed this) knows about black people he learned from repeated
viewings of HIGH SCHOOL HIGH and the WB Network sitcoms.
When J.Bulworth has his breakdown he becomes infatuated with Nina (Halle
Berry) and spends alot of time in the ‘hood. There's
ALOT of black people in this movie, yet none of them speak or act
realistically like anyone I've ever met. More to the point, they're all
idiots. They made ME want to cut social programs.</P>
<P>    But not everybody's gonna feel the way I do, you may not care about
anything I've said so far. Maybe watching the WB and UPN
networks is as multicultural as you want to get. Say you just picked up
a new frame for your NRA certificate and a signed, limited
edition, hardcover copy of The Bell Curve and you're feeling pretty
stoked that the Nazi party is starting to reform in
Germany...Guess, what: The movie still stinks!
    BULWORTH forgets more of its inane plot lines than it remembers. The
humor is all slapstick and ‘fish out of water' setups (Okay,
"the rich white guy is hangin' with the homeys." We get it!). It's and
endless string of "White men can't rap" jokes played to the hilt.
So much so that they start to ruin some of the good scenes. Even if you
can't get enough of that, it has an ending that I guarantee no
one- I repeat, NO ONE will like.</P>
<P>     I really wanted to like BULWORTH, too. I think it had the potential
to be a very important film, but alas, it is a celluloid train
wreck. The shoddiness would be understandable if it'd been made by a
first-time or music video director, but this is
Warren-freaking-Beatty we're talking about here!  He's been making
movies since 1961 and won a Oscar for REDS, which he also
wrote and directed.  For every brilliant scene in BULWORTH that makes me
want everybody to see this movie there are four or five
that make me blanche at the idea that anybody will ever see it...
...And you don't want to see a black man blanche.
  It's scarier than having him ask you for directions on a dark street.</P>

<PRE>*Whew* I didn't think I could get through that without saying BULWORTH
is Bull$#!+...
