<PRE>THE DAYTRIPPERS (1996)
 A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: Greg Mottola
Starring: Hope Davis, Parker Posey, Liev Schreiber, Anne Meara, Pat
McNamara, Stanley Tucci, Campbell Scott, Marcia Gay Harden, Andy Brown,
Paul Herman, Marc Grapey</P>
<P>The trailers for this film revelaed that this was to be a quirky,
fast-paced, and very funny little comedy, filled with a great
screenplay, good characterization, a simple-but-loveable plot, and even
some depth.  I mean, yeah, I laughed at some of the good lines, was
hooked by the fact that it had a good cast, and even in a bit of awe
since it boasted it was an official selection to be shown at Cannes. 
So, I was up for a good little bit of indie fun.</P>
<PRE>Then I saw the movie.</PRE>
<P>Now, granted, this aims for some depth, and has a lot of very funny
moments, but overall, it's a disappointment, failing at nearly
everything it aims for.  It wants to be quirky and funny, and yeah, it
is for a lot of it.  It wants to have good characterization, and some of
the characters are, although some of them are pure characteriteurs, and
not real people at all.  The simple plot is simple and likable, so that
works.  And there is some depth, but not a lot of it.  And any depth it
has is never followed up, and therefore fails.</P>
<P>Well, the plot deals with a woman named Eliza (Hope Davis, a dead ringer
for Julie Delpy, although with a smaller mouth, I guess) who's married
to a book editor, Louis (Stanley Tucci, who seems to be in everything
these days), but one morning finds a love letter in her house after he
leaves for work.  Is it from him?  Is it to him?  All she knows is it
has nothing to do with her.  So she freaks.</P>
<P>She high-tails it over to her parents' house, consisting of her
overbearing, and annoying-as-hell mother (Anne Meara), and her quiet and
soft-spoken father (Pat McNamara).  Also there are her sister (Parker
Posey, who IS in everything these days), and her long-time
boyfriend/possible fiance (Liev Schreiber), who's a very pretentious
writer who's in the process of writing a satirical book about a man with
a dog's head, which sounds like it might actually be a book I'd read. 
Oh well.</P>
<P>So they read the letter, and they decide to ask Louis to his face (since
you can tell if someone is lying when you see them face to face).  So
they all cram into the family station wagon, and head into Manhattan to
find him.  This is a light-weight plot, and luckily writer/director Greg
Mottola decides to go the road not-less traveled and give us a lot of
interesting and funny dialogue, as to waste time and make the trip, and
subsequently the film, more fun.  So we get some little discussions,
sometimes intellectual (Liev Schreiber's character is one of those
pseudo-intellectuals, who repeatedly talks about how bad society is and
how we should be in an aristocracy - this is later challenged).</P>
<P>We also get the occasional supporting character to take up some screen
time with some speeches, lines, scenes, etc.  The most interesting is a
writer played by Campbell Scott (Stanley Tucci's bosom buddy) who seems
to flirt with anyone with breasts, and tries to steal Posey from
Schreiber.  I've never really seen a whole lot of Scott, but he was just
awesome in this flick.  We also get a little pointless comic bit from
Marcia Gay Harden at a party that they arrive at.</P>
<P>The ending aims for a lot of depth, etc, but just seems to end abruptly
without a lot of explanation.  There's a twist, which was much talked
about, and yes, it's clever, but it's not brilliant or anything.  It
basically goes for the quick shock you might not have thought of.</P>
<P>But the big problem with this film is the mother.  First off, let me say
that she is wonderfully played by Anne Meara.  She makes her totally
overbearing, annoying, and does it so much that at one point, we almost
want to cheer at one point where some obvious bottled-up-anger is
released.  But she's a flat character.  There's no depth to her
character.  She's just annoying and overbearing, and that's it.  Of
course, we want to cheer at the point I just talked about - she's
annoying.  Anne does try to give her some depth, but the writing is just
not there for her.  Her character's portrayal in the writing is the weak
link in the film, and brings it down.</P>
<P>I will say that this is more well written than the film actually ends up
becoming. The dialogue is clever, very witty, and the characters are
well-defined...well, almost.  And the acting is very good, with the best
performances coming from Posey, Schreiber, Scott, and...McNamara (I
really liked what he did with the father, I don't know about anyone
else).  And there is a bit of depth to the film, but it's never deepend
to its fullest potential limits.</P>
<P>"The Daytrippers" is an occasionally funny, sometimes dramatic, but
overall unsatisfying little indie film which had potential to be an
excellent comic drama and even a parody of the nuclear family (I
guess).  Anyway, I was pretty disappointed with this film, but it didn't
suck.  So much for advertising.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): **</PRE>
