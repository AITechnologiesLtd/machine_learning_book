<P>    Doesn't suck, but isn't entirely cool, either.  The MTV morons go in
search of their stolen television set and end up at a flea-bag motel,
where some sleaze thinks they're a pair of hitmen (!) and offers them
ten grand to "do" his wife.  Believing that they'll finally score-- the
only action that these two see is of the, uh, self-inflicted variety--
Beavis and Butt-head accept the offer, which lands them on cross-country
chase involving international terrorists, biological weapons, and
full-body cavity searches by rubber-gloved ATF agents.  (After one of
which Butt-head admits "I think I just scored.") As expected, there's
enough concentrated juvenile humor here to keep any audience giggling,
and not just those fans of the show.  (The bits are, at times,
priceless.  While touring the Hoover Dam, Butt-head asks "Is this a God
dam?" And don't miss what they say after spotting a defecating donkey at
the Grand Canyon.)</P>
<P>     Unlike the television series, no music videos are played, except
for a psychedelic sequence set to White Zombie (one of many rockin'
bands on the soundtrack) and inspired by the designs of those old Rat
Fink cars.  (More amusing is a Vegas montage set to a Red Hot Chili
Peppers cover of "Love Rollercoaster.") BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA
is only eighty minutes long, but the last twenty are tiresome.  By then,
the hilarity has largely petered out.  Uh huh huh huh huh, I said peter.
Great voice work, though.  In addition to director/co-writer/series
creator Mike Judge, who voices several characters including the Two Cool
Guys, listen for Robert Stack, Cloris Leachman, someone who sounds like
Bruce Willis, and another person who sounds an awful lot like Demi
Moore.  And, yes, I believe that's the voice of Mr. Letterman in one of
the more, uh, explosive scenes. </P>
