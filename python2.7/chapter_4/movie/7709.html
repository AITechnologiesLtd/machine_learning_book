<PRE>                   AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY
                       A film review by Serdar Yegulalp
                        Copyright 1997 Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Godawful "comedy" that's amazingly shabby and cut-rate, and rather
bereft of laughs.</P>
<P>I was having a bad week in my life when I saw AUSTIN POWERS:INTERNATIONAL
MAN OF MYSTERY. I desperately needed something to cheer me up, or at least
distract me so I could get a clear head. Get some perspective. Even dumb
movies can do that for me, sometimes.</P>
<P>I tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment, but I am certain
now that AUSTIN POWERS would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on
the day I won the lottery. Michael Myers has taken a character that would
barely have supported a five-minute sketch on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE and
stretched it to the length of a feature film, padding it out with toilet
jokes and the sort of
props-strategically-positioned-between-naked-actors-and-camera gags that
Benny Hill got tired of fifteen years ago.</P>
<P>The plot, what little there is of it: Back in the Swinging Mod Hep Sixties
(I don't think I'm doing a disservice to the movie's attempted early look
and feel by describing it that way), sexy British secret agent Austin Powers
tangled with his nemesis Dr. Evil. Evil launched himself into orbit and
cryogenically forze himself to return decades later, when Powers was out of
the picture. Powers also had himself frozen, and he wakes up to find the
Nineties a very hard time to deal with.</P>
<P>The basic gag, that of Powers' total inability to cope with the Nineties, is
not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really
dealt with. The bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several
basic rubrics: James Bond gags (of which this movie has no end, right down
to the silly character names), inept slapstick, toilet humor, and
strategically placed props... The movie's amazingly bereft of ideas, come to
think of it, with a couple of bright exceptions. One is Dr. Evil's son --
there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter
group, chaired by Carrie Fisher -- and the other is a throwaway gag where
Austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch (it's a
visual gag -- hard to describe, and hard to recommend seeing the movie for).</P>
<P>A lot of Sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for
this movie, but it's desperate rather than clever. Instead of skewering the
whole thing, it's a rather bloodless and unfunny tribute. Myers himself is
also desperate: he's given an idea to play, not a character. Plus, the
attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with
another sexy (albeit "Nineties") agent are a waste of time. I wanted to have
the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her, only to have
her deck him one. With a couple of exceptions, the movie misses all of its
own best moments.</P>
<P>The movie even looks cheesy, and not in a good way: I kept wondering if it
had been transferred down from Hi-Def video or something, so grainy was the
film stock in a good many scenes. The whole thing has the air of being done
on the cheap.</P>
<P>My definition of comedy is simply: Did it make me laugh? The few times that
I laughed in AUSTIN POWERS were completely offset by the time I spent
cringing and wanting out. The most damning thing I could say about the movie
is that Wayne and Garth would most likely have shoved it into Mike Tyson's
shorts and sent it sailing.</P>
