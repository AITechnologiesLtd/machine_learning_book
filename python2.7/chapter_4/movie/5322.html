<PRE>                                    LAST DANCE
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
            Copyright 1996 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Bruce Beresford
Rating: ** (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>During the last half century, only one woman has been tried and executed
for her crimes.  Unfortunately for the producers of LAST DANCE, this
capital punishment movie fails to generate enough interest even to raise
the question "Is this *that* woman's story?"</P>
<P>Following on from last year's Academy Award nomination for her supporting
role in CASINO, Hollywood fave Sharon Stone continues her bid for
recognition as a Serious Actor.  After a diabolically-dreary turn in
DIABOLIQUE, Stone returns to serious cinema in a film that is seriously and
uncompromisingly average.  As death row inmate Cindy Liggett, Stone--sans
makeup and with a Meryl Streep-inspired Southern drawl--plays a convicted
killer who has been in the state penitentiary awaiting the death penalty
for 12 years.  With three stays of execution by a sympathetic judge yet
little hope for ultimate mercy, Stone's character is one that is beaten and
broken and ready to die.</P>
<P>Enter Rick Hayes (NORTHERN EXPOSURE's Rob Morrow), an inexperienced
attorney who is assigned to review Liggett's case for the Clemency Board.
Expected to follow standard operating procedure to an inevitable outcome,
Hayes instead finds himself drawn into a personal relationship with Liggett
as he investigates her crime.  Although there is no question that she is
guilty--as a teenaged crackhead, Liggett cold-bloodedly beat to death two
high schoolers--Hayes discovers a changed woman in Liggett and seeks to
have her sentence commuted.  Only a compassionate nod from the Governor can
save her from death by lethal injection as Hayes fights to uncover
discrepancies in her original defense trial.</P>
<P>But this is not a brutal, hard-hitting expose of life behind bars, which
might have made for better drama.  The worst the women prisoners appear to
endure is a steady diet of television soap operas and game shows!  LAST
DANCE's focus is on the relationship between Liggett and Hayes, and this is
where it falls down.  These two characters are similar in so much as no one
has expected anything of them in life, but otherwise there is simply no
chemistry between the two, for which we can blame both the weak script and
Morrow's featherweight performance as Hayes.  The film lacks emotional
punch right up until the climactic scenes, when Stone finally gives it her
all in glorious Technicolor.</P>
<P>Word-of-mouth and obvious comparisons to the superior DEAD MAN WALKING
should kill LAST DANCE off at the box office.  Sharon Stone fans are about
the only potential audience and they will be treated to a decent Sharon
Stone performance coupled with an atypical, anti-glamorous Sharon Stone
look.  She certainly does the best she can with the paper-thin
material--LAST DANCE is unlikely to hurt her career.</P>
<P>Veteran Australian director Bruce Beresford (BREAKER MORANT) is no stranger
to plots centering around civic injustice, but he plays this outing way too
safe, failing to inject any life or depth into the proceedings.  If there
was an opportunity for originality or creativity here then Beresford missed
the boat.  LAST DANCE fails to satisfy as astute character study,
provocative political treatise, or even camp women-in-chains potboiler.</P>
<P>As dances go, this is a slow one-step with no chance of appeal.</P>
