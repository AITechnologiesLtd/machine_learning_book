<P>I've never been much of a Tigger fan and, for the life of me, I can't
figure out why some people get so worked up over him.  Sure, he looks
cuddly, but to me he's always seemed like a lightweight Daffy Duck
knock-off (even though Tigger was around first).  I barely wanted to see
the film as it was, so imagine my horror when the theatre lights finally
go down and the screen lights up with something called `Disney Mambo No.
5,' which is basically a music video featuring
fourteen-and-a-half-minutes-into-his-fame Lou Bega.</P>
<P>The animated Tigger actually kicks off with a live-action scene of
Christopher Robin's bedroom.  For those of you that don't know the
basics of the whole `Pooh' story, Christopher was the son of creator
A.A. Milne, who wrote a series of books in the 1920s that were based on
his boy's stuffed animals plus a couple of real animals that lived in
the wooded area near their home.  Tigger's story is basically depicted
as one of the books in Christopher's room and is narrated by some
invisible guy that turns the pages of the book as the film progresses.</P>
<P>As viewers are initially submerged into the world of the Hundred-Acre
Wood, Tigger appears and sings a song proclaiming that the wonderful
thing about Tiggers is that he is the only one.  Damn straight, brother
– and thank God for that.  Tigger is a bouncer, apparently deriving
great pleasure from using his tail as a pogo stick and springing all
over the place.  He tries to get his friends to bounce with him, but
they're all too busy – raspy Pooh is too busy stockpiling pots of hunny
and worrywart Piglet seems concerned only for the amount of firewood he
has saved for the winter.  Only little Roo seems to have the patience to
deal with Tigger, who pretty much annoys everyone in the whole
Hundred-Acre Wood.  As they try to get things done, he bugs them - kind
of like a bouncy orange Kramer.</P>
<P>And speaking of Roo, who is his father?  The original Pooh books must
have been pretty edgy for the ‘20s, portraying Kanga as a single mother
way before it was fashionable.  She doesn't look too slutty, and since
the characters in these stories are fairly limited, my money would be on
the downtrodden Eeyore.  It's always the quiet ones you have to watch
out for.  And will somebody get Pooh a shirt that will fit over his
giant belly?  That little red number just doesn't cut it.  He looks like
a film critic, for Christ's sake.</P>
<P>Anyway, the story follows Tigger as he searches for his family during
the onset of winter.  He wants to track them down to have someone to
bounce with – something that I've always felt should be accomplished
with a person outside of the family.  He imagines what his family looks
like (shown through paintings inspired by Dali,Warhol, et al.) and he
sings songs.  A lot of songs.  There were at least seven that I was
awake for…and the film is only seventy-eight minutes long.  Do the math
– that's better than a song every ten minutes, toppling Topsy-Turvy for
the championship of the world.</P>
<P>The best scene is probably supposed to be when they all don Tigger
costumes to pose as his family, but the whole thing is depicted in the
film's poster, not to mention toy stores that have already begun to sell
stuffed Poohs and Piglets wearing Tigger suits.  The animation is less
that spectacular, but it's pretty true to the pictures in the Disney
books.  The voice work is also pretty lackluster, with the performers'
credits reading like a `who's not' in the animation industry.  Most of
their previous work is listed as `Additional Voices,' which pretty much
amounts to cartoon voice extras.</P>
<P>But, hey – it's short, the kids will probably dig it and it's not
Pokémon.  It could be a lot worse.</P>
<P>1:18 – Rated G and contains no objectionable material</P>
