<PRE>                   THE IMPOSTERS (United States)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: Roughly 60 years after its heyday, the farce returns.
Stanley Tucci wrote, directed, and stars in a very funny movie about
two out of work actors on a boat.  It is not exactly like Laurel and
Hardy, not just like the Marx Brothers, but it is in that vein.  And I
did laugh, which is rare these days.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), 2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - I first noticed Stanley Tucci in PRELUDE TO A KISS where I thought
     he was very funny.  Since then I have been watching for him.  But
     THE IMPOSTERS is like nothing he has made before and like very few
     films made since the 40s.  The only other true farce I remember
     from recent year is BRAIN DONORS and that was almost entirely
     taken from the Marx Brothers school.  THE IMPOSTERS is a new and
     very funny comedy team of Platt and Tucci.  It is hard to know if
     comedy will be funny for other people.  Currently people are
     laughing uproariously at THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY which did
     not do very much for me.  Other films like OSCAR and THE CHEAP
     DETECTIVE crack me up but are not successful comedies at the
     boxoffice.  So take it from whence it comes.  THE IMPOSTERS did
     make me laugh very hard at times.  Not many comedies make me
     laugh.
   - Tucci co-produced, wrote, directed, and starred in the film.
   - Cast includes Oliver Platt, Stanley Tucci, Alfred Molina, Lily
     Taylor, Steve Buscemi, Tony Shalhoub, Teagle, F. Bougere, Campbell
     Scott, and Isabella Rossellini.
   - The language and one or two modestly sexual situations are not in
     the classical farce tradition.
   - Out-of-work actors are given tickets to see HAMLET with a
     particularly hammy actor.  When Maurice (Platt) insults the actor
     they are chased hide in a packing crate and find themselves loaded
     onto an ocean liner.  From there a large number of subplots start
     working themselves out, GRAND HOTEL style with the help of Maurice
     and Arthur (Tucci).
   - Steve Buscemi sings???????
   - Bizarre scenes as the two seem to get into a fight at an outdoor
     restaurant.
   - An unexpected and uncredited role near the beginning.
   - Campbell Scott as a German crewmember is very funny.
   - The shooting title was SHIP OF FOOLS.  I saw that it was being
     filmed and expected a remake of the Catherine Anne Porter.  Uh,
     not quite.</P>
