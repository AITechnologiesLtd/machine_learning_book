<PRE>                                   HEXED
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>92 min., R, Comedy, 1993
Director: Alan Spencer
Cast: Arye Gross, Claudia Christian, Adrienne Shelly, Ray Baker,
      R. Lee Ermey, Michael Knight, Robin Curtis, Norman Fell</P>
<P>     Hotel clerk Arye Gross is in love with French model Claudia
Christian.  He finds out that Christian is going to be staying at the
hotel where he works.  Gross tricks Christian into going out with him,
and while they are out, Christian kills a man.  Christian sets up Gross
so that police officer R. Lee Ermey thinks that he did it.  Gross has
to prove that Christian did it before he gets caught.</P>
<P>     HEXED is a very funny film that is enjoyable to just sit down and
watch.  I recommend HEXED to fans of slapstick comedy.  I enjoyed
watching this film, and so did the audience in the showing that I went
to.  On a scale of zero to five, I give HEXED a four.  HEXED is rated R
for female nudity, adult situations, explicit language, adult humor, and
violence.</P>
<P>     The cast for this film does a good job.  My favorite person in the
film is R.  Lee Ermey (FULL METAL JACKET).  He does an excellent job.
Adrienne Shelly (TRUTH, THE UNBELIEVABLE TRUTH) outshines most of the
cast.  Claudia Christian (CLEAN AND SOBER, RELENTLESS: MIND OF A KILLER)
does a reasonably good job.  Arye Gross (HOUSE 2: THE SECOND STORY, SOUL
MAN) gives a great performance.</P>
<P>     This film may offend some people with a scene mocking the Rodney
King beating which involves a white man being unnecessarily beaten in a
hotel lobby by several police officers and being videotaped by a
tourist.  I happen to have found this scene funny, even though I also
thought it was in bad taste.</P>
<P>     Like the soon-coming NATIONAL LAMPOON'S LOADED WEAPON 1, HEXED
makes fun of many of the movies that have come out.  And for those who
haven't seen the movies that HEXED is lampooning, there are plenty of
sight gags.  The funniest are: the sex scene between Claudia Christian
and Arye Gross, the dead hotel worker, the Rodney King beating mockery,
and the ending.</P>
<P>     This film is not one that it matters greatly if you see it in the
theater or see it on videocassette.  If you have the time, definitely go
see this film.  If you don't, the film will probably be released on
videocassette in about six months and you can see it then.</P>
