<PRE>                               THE MAMBO KINGS
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     THE MAMBO KINGS is a film directed by Arne Glimcher.  The
screenplay is by Cynthia Cidre.  It stars Armand Assante, Antonio
Banderas, Cathy Moriarty, Maruschka Detmers, and features several Latin
music greats, including Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, and others.  It is
rated R for simulated sex, nudity, and some violence.</P>
<P>     THE MAMBO KINGS is derived Oscar Hijuelos' novel THE MAMBO KINGS
PLAY SONGS OF LOVE.  By all reports something was lost in the
translation from print to screen.  However, what survives is a pleasant,
likable movie with two wonderful performances, several interesting
character performances, and a lot of first rate Latin music of the early
Fifties.</P>
<P>     It is both unfortunate and a saving coincidence that AMERICAN ME
and MAMBO KINGS opened on the same Friday.  AMERICAN ME, which I
reviewed separately, is the superpessimistic view of the Mexican-
Americans of East Los Angeles.  MAMBO KINGS is a rather fluffy,
optimistic paean to the success of Cubans in the United States.  It is
nostalgic and sentimental.  At its best, it is the love story of two
brothers who have good cause to leave Cuba for New York and who start
their own mambo band there.  As such, it may be an anecdote to the
emotional hangover of the other movie, or its fluffiness may be seem
more than so that it really is.</P>
<P>     The brothers are literally overnight successes, but then the usual
predicaments and impediments slow down their rise to fame and fortune.
On the way we have admirable performances from Armand Assante as Cesar
and Antonio Banderas as his brother Nestor.  Assante is an actor who
seems mostly to have been fated to playing maniac heavies, usually a
drug lord with an attitude.  Here he develops a complex portrait of
Cesar, the ambitious Mambo King who despite his hunger to succeed stands
up for personal freedom.  Assante reminds me to a remarkable degree of
Robert DeNiro, there being a physical resemblance, but ever more
importantly a similarity in the intensity and energy he brings to his
performance.</P>
<P>     Banderas, who has starred in several of Pedro Almodovar's Spanish
films, turns in another excellent performance; this is Banderas' first
English-language role.  His portrait is of a Nestor who is a real artist
in turmoil, whose internal sufferings inform and inspire his art.  He is
sweet, a little passive, and a late-comer to rebellion against his
domineering brother.</P>
<P>     It is no small part of the charm of this slight movie that we get
some fine performances by Tito Puente and the fabulous Celia Cruz, whose
smile could light up all the Havanas of the world.  We also get an
extended cameo, if that's the expression, by Desi Arnaz, Jr., playing
his father.  And as a special treat Arnaz and the Mambo Kings are
seamlessly edited into an episode of I Love Lucy.</P>
<P>     There's a lot of love in this movie, love of brothers, love of the
music, love of Cuban culture.</P>
<P>     It's an enjoyable and worthwhile escape and as such I can recommend
it at matinee prices, but don't, as I did, see it too close to seeing
AMERICAN ME.</P>
