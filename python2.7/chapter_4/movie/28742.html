<P>Susan Granger's review of "LEGALLY BLONDE" (M.G.M.)</P>
<P>   It's a "Pretty in Pink"/"Clueless" coming-of-age story for the 
new millennium as Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), a perky Southern 
California sorority queen, switches from fashion to law in order to win 
back her yuppy boyfriend (Matthew Davis). The girl-power story begins as 
this sweetheart of Delta Nu is unceremoniously dumped by a bonehead who 
says: "If I'm going to be a Senator by the time I'm 30...I need to marry a 
Jackie, not a Marilyn." Determined to prove she's as smart a snobby 
brunette (Selma Blair) from country-club Connecticut, Elle not only applies 
to Harvard Law School but gets in, much to the amazement of family, friends 
and faculty. Once there, this flaxen-haired fish-out-of-water not only 
survives but tenaciously thrives, befriending a local manicurist (Jennifer 
Coolidge), dazzling a professor (Victor Garber) and rescuing a defendant 
(Ali Larter) in a celebrated Boston murder trial, plus finding a more 
worthy beau (Luke Wilson). In the tradition of teen-comedy film-maker John 
Hughes and his disciple Amy Heckerling, there's wit, cheerfulness, a 
fidelity of observation and a penchant for problem-solving. First-time 
feature director Robert Luketic is blessed with Reese Witherspoon who's 
joyously  incandescent in this utterly formulaic light comedy written by 
Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, based on a soon-to-be-published 
novel by Amanda Brown. The supporting cast is terrific, particularly Raquel 
Welch and Holland Taylor - and I particularly got a kick out of the gag of 
Elle distributing scented resumes in pink, her signature color On the 
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Legally Blonde" is a frivolous, funny, 
feel-good 8. Filled with ditzy blonde ambition, it's a movie for 
high-school kids that their parents would be happy to have them see. </P>
