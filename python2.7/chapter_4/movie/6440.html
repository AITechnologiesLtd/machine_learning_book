<P>     Arthur Miller's 1953 play, "The Crucible", was written during 
Senator Joseph McCarthy's House Un-American Activities Committee 
hearings (for which Miller was called to testify in 1956).  And, 
although the play is an historical allegory for the McCarthy period, its 
true power lies in its ability to be re-interpreted to fit any time 
period.  Indeed, its fertile themes -- the lure of power, the 
gullibility of those who believe they have a moral imperative, the need 
to accept responsibility for the consequences of all actions, and the 
nature of truth -- are universal in scope.  Events such as those 
depicted in "The Crucible" have recurred with alarming predictability 
throughout human history.</P>
<P>     Scholars can argue about which of Miller's two best plays ("The 
Crucible" and "Death of a Salesman") is the stronger work, but there's 
little doubt that "The Crucible" is the most accessible.  Oddly, this is 
the first English-language motion picture version.  With Miller handling 
the screenwriting, it comes as little surprise that THE CRUCIBLE is 
faithful to its source material.  Director Nicholas Hytner (THE MADNESS 
OF KING GEORGE) opens up the play, using location shooting and an 
impressively-detailed period setting to add a dimension not available on 
the stage.  Those unaware of the film's background may be surprised to 
learn that such a dynamic production began life in the theater.</P>
<P>     Miller has never claimed that his story is historically accurate, 
although many of the broader strokes correspond to events that actually 
occurred in Salem, Massachusetts during 1692.  In that year, a wave of 
superstitious terror gripped the Puritan town.  19 villagers were hung 
as witches.  Four died in prison.  One was pressed to death when he 
refused to answer questions.  It was an era, like that in America during 
the 1950s, when a mere accusation could doom a man or woman, and when 
justice often became secondary to saving face.</P>
<P>     The film opens with a seemingly-harmless event -- Abigail Williams 
(Winona Ryder), Mary Warren (Karron Graves), Mercy Lewis (Kali Rocha), 
and several other Salem village girls attend a secret voodoo ritual in 
the woods.  Tituba (Charlayne Woodard), a native of Barbados, presides 
over the ceremony, which involves drinking chicken blood, dancing naked, 
and casting charms to ensnare boys.  However, when the local preacher, 
Reverend Parris (Bruce Davison), stumbles upon the proceedings, and two 
of the girls subsequently fall into coma-like states, witchcraft is 
suspected, and an expert in the field, Reverend Hale (Rob Campbell), is 
brought in to investigate.</P>
<P>     To save themselves from the noose, which is the penalty for a witch 
who does not admit to consorting with the Devil, Abigail and her cohorts 
plead for their lives.  However, they not only confess to performing 
witchcraft, but name other townspeople as servants of Satan.  Soon, with 
the arrival of Judge John Danforth (Paul Scofield), the Deputy Governor 
of Massachusetts, the girls, now turned back to "the ways of God", are 
regarded as unimpeachable witnesses.  Those whom they condemn are 
arrested, and the innocent who refuse to confess are hanged.  Abigail's 
real reason for starting the charade is to eliminate Elizabeth Proctor 
(Joan Allen), the wife of John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis), the man she 
loves.  But, although Abigail and John once had an affair, he will not 
abandon his wife for his former mistress, and his staunch defense of 
Elizabeth places him in jeopardy, especially when he accuses Danforth's 
court of "pulling down heaven and raising up a whore!"</P>
<P>     One of the most contemporarily relevant aspects of THE CRUCIBLE, 
the ease with which justice can be manipulated and perverted, is what 
Hytner and Miller have chosen to highlight in this adaptation.  A 
parallel-yet-integral theme relates to the thrill of power  inherent in 
being the manipulator.  Abigail enjoys playing God until the 
circumstances she sets in motion gain enough momentum to escape her 
control.  Late in the film, her eyes express the horror that she feels 
as the crushing ramifications of her masquerade emerge.  </P>
<P>     As thematically rich as THE CRUCIBLE is, it would be a dry and 
uninteresting piece if the characters and their situations were less 
compelling.  Indeed, the human interest and drama of the story are what 
distinguish it.  In THE CRUCIBLE, there are heroes and villains, but 
nothing is black and white.  Shades of gray permeate every action.  
Abigail is the spark that ignites the inferno of mistrust; however, she 
is guided not by malice, but by a misplaced, obsessive love.  John 
Proctor, the most upright man in the film, is an adulterer whose own 
actions indirectly lead to the tragedy.  He is noble only to a point, 
and his character faults make him easy to identify with as a human 
being.</P>
<P>     Much has been made of Winona Ryder's performance, but, while she 
does an excellent job fleshing out Abigail as more than a cardboard 
instrument of vengeance and evil, two other actors captured my attention 
more forcefully.  The first, perhaps unsurprisingly, is Daniel Day-
Lewis, whose John Proctor takes on the dimensions of a classically-
flawed tragic hero.  The second, a relative-unknown named Karron Graves, 
plays Mary Warren, a girl who is deeply disturbed by the morality of her 
false testimony.  Graves' interpretation is wrenching, and deserves to 
be recognized alongside the performances of Ryder and Day-Lewis.  Joan 
Allen (NIXON), as Elizabeth Proctor, and Paul Scofield (QUIZ SHOW), as 
Danforth, are solid in supporting roles.</P>
<P>     Whether on stage or on film, "The Crucible" is a powerful, thought-
provoking production.  This version illuminates the story's numerous 
strengths, resulting in a motion picture of surprising emotional and 
intellectual impact.  By re-interpreting this classic so effectively, 
Hytner has assured that at least one version of "The Crucible" will 
become a part of film history.</P>
