<PRE>                       GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     I have mixed feelings about GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND. My major
problem with it was that Walter Hill (he also directed 48 HRS) thought
he was Richard Attenborough and was doing Gandhi. We had a lot of shots
of Geronimo staring Christ-like into the lens for long periods without
moving. Wes Studi who plays Geronimo, and who was great in LAST OF THE
MOHICANS, convinces you of Geronimo's near godliness. No matter how
many innocent (white) people he kills, you want him to slaughter more.
The picture makes you feel how he has been wronged and since he is a
warrior, murdering people is the natural thing that all warriors must
do.</P>
<P>     I read an article where Wes Studi said he felt the movie tried too
hard to be politically correct. If you want to see a really good movie
about Native Americans, I recommend DANCES WITH WOLVES. LAST OF THE
MOHICANS is also good albeit not in the same league as DANCES WITH
WOLVES.</P>
<P>     So what was right about the show?  Excellent performances by all
of the actors. Especially fascinating was Wes Studi and Jason Patric.
Good minor character roles were played by Gene Hackman and Robert
Duvall. The cinematography by Lloyd Ahern was award winning quality
with great open space shots and very effective close up shadow shots.</P>
<P>     GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND runs 1:55 and is rated PG-13. Given
the violence, I am surprised it did not get an R. It would be fine for
teenagers. Overall, I think the good does outweigh the bad, and I give
the show a thumbs up and ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
