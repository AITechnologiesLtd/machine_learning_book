<P>Rhythm. I kept thinking about that word as I left the theater. At it's
best moments, the Whole Nine Yards has a certain rhythm. It comes from
some of the one on one conversations between characters. There is a
certain comic timing that reminded me of 1940's screwball comedies, like
a good Tracey/Hepburn film. Those moments weren't plentiful, but they
were joyful to watch.</P>
<P>The Whole Nine Yards centers on dentist Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (Perry),
who is sleepwalking through life married to a shrewish wife (Arquette),
living a bland existance in Montreal. That all changes when Oz meets his
next door neighbor, Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Willis), a former Chicago
mob hitman recently released from prison for ratting out his former mob
associates. Because of Tulip's kiss and tell, a mob boss, played by
Pollock, wants him dead. The story careens along at a brisk clip as
there are double , then triple crosses and at certain points, you don't
know who is going to kill whom. Perry and Willis both play characters
we've seen before, but they imbue them with so much of their persona
that they gain an edge to them. </P>
<P>Perry is the same character he's played on TV and in previous movies: a
sweet, somewhat clever guy whose unsure of what he wants in life. Willis
is the same pucker-mouthed, wisecracking, king of cool that we've been
seeing since his Moonlighting days. The difference this time is that
Lynn has gotten the pair down to a distillation of themselves. The
acting may not be a stretch for either actor, but there is a leaness to
their performances that works in their favor. Perry runs the gamut of
slapstick physical comedy to repeated double takes to a modest spit
take, a comedic classic. He bounces through the film with whiffle ball
lightness, while showing a certain restraint. He is amusing to behold. </P>
<P>Willis manages to turn his trademark smirk into a mysterious Mona Lisa
smile, and that's the key to his performance. You think you know what
Tulip is thinking, but that smirk lingers a bit long as his eyes lock
uncomfortably onto another character and you sense the menace floating
behind that smile.</P>
<P>There are other nice acting turns. Amanda Peet, as Jill, Oz's dental
assistant, projects a sexy goofiness that is truly engaging. Natasha
Henstridge as Tulip's wife, holds the screen with subtle emotional
depth, that belies the swirl of zaniness surrounding her. Duncan, as
another hitman, lights the screen up with his self satisfied smile and
hulking presence. That isn't to say that everyone comes across so
effectively. </P>
<P>It's obvious that Pollock and Arquette, as Oz's wife, were told to play
their parts over the top. The problem is that they go so far over the
top that they fall off the other side. Arquette adopts what is suppossed
to be a french accent, but it sounded more like a blend of French,
Chinese and an other-wordly language. Pollock garbles his way through an
unfunny hungarian speech affectation that had me yearning for earplugs. </P>
<P>The Whole Nine Yards has it's moments, but it never climbs to the level
of belly laughs. I found myself chuckling at certain parts and smiling
in bemusement at others and there isn't a thing wrong with that. Just
because it falls short of going the full 10 yards, doesn't mean it's not
pleasant, very amusing film fare.</P>
