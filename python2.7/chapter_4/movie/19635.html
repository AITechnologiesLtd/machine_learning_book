<PRE>Go Go `Gadget' Fun
by Homer Yen
(1999)</PRE>
<P>Perhaps you might be familiar with a campy 60s TV show called Get
Smart, which featured a bumbling agent that always thwarted the forces
of evil even though he couldn't find a clue if it came up and hit him
in the face.  You might also be familiar with an equally campy 70s TV
show called the Six Million Dollar Man, which featured a man barely
alive who was rebuilt to be faster…stronger…better.   And of course
we're all familiar with the people at Disney, who possess a talent to
bring us good family fare full of wacky creativity.  Blend these three
elements together and you get 80 minutes of grins in Disney's
`Inspector Gadget.'</P>
<P>Inspector Gadget is actually John Brown (Matthew Broderick), a
mild-mannered security guard that almost loses his life during a
robbery.  In the accident, his body has suffered irreparable damage. 
But thanks to some groundbreaking work by scientist Brenda (Joely
Fisher), John can benefit from a new procedure that blends flesh with
technology.  On the operating table as they try to save his life, they
wheel in the entire inventory of the local Home Depot, from springs to
pipes to hoses.  When John wakes up, he learns that he is now the new
generation of law enforcement.  All he has to say is ‘go go gadget'
something, and voila – it pops out.  This man is the ultimate Swiss
pocketknife.  His thumb is a lighter, his ear is a sound amplifier, and
his legs turn into huge metal stilts that allow him to leapfrog through
traffic at an amazing speed.  When he wants to scale a building, ‘go go
gadget grappling hook.'  And when he needs to get somewhere across
town, 'go go gadget copter.'  I found these scenes inventive and cute,
although kids would probably appreciate the gee-whiz gadgetry more than
I did.</P>
<P>The acerbic police chief Quimby (Dabney Coleman) is not thrilled with
having an experimental cybercop, quipping that Inspector Gadget is
Columbo and Nintendo all rolled into one.  But this new inspector
catches the eye of the magnate, Mr. Scolex/Dr. Claw (Rupert Everett). 
He wants to steal the technology to build his own legion of warriors. 
Scolex is the kind of cartoonish bad guy that says mean things
accompanied by mean-sounding music in the background.  After all, this
is Disney.  </P>
<P>This live-action film was inspired from the cartoon of the same name
from the 80's.  I was mildly interested in the cartoon and probably
came away with a similarly lukewarm feeling after I saw the movie. 
There isn't much bite to this movie, although the movie has its tender
moments.  Nonetheless, I did enjoy Broderick's appropriately frumpy
performance and I thought that the movie paced itself very well to keep
me from slipping into a mode of boredom.  I also liked the
Gadgetmobile, which is a convertible that puts the Knight Rider
(another 80s show) car to shame.  Among the many cool things that this
car can do, perhaps the coolest is the built-in soda and candy
dispenser for the weary passenger in need of a snack.  But the funniest
scene happens during the end credits.  One of Scolex's evil henchman
wants to mend his ways and attends a meeting of the Minion Support
Group.  In this group, you'll find Oddjob and Jaws from a few James
Bond flicks and a few other memorable, evil sidekicks.</P>
