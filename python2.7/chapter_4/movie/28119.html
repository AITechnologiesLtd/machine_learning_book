<PRE>Charlie's Angels
2000 - 99 minutes - Rated PG-13
DVD Released March 27, 2001
DVD Review by Dustin Putman</PRE>
<P>After months of alleged production delays, casting and script problems, and 
endless rumors of on-set arguments, "Charlie's Angels," a big-screen 
adaptation of the cult '76-'81 television series (starring Jaclyn Smith and 
Farrah Fawcett, among others), seemed doomed for catastrophic failure. After 
all, when was the last time we saw a TV-show-turned-feature-film that was 
worthwhile, particularly when the budget was an overblown $90-million? 
Moreover, the terrible teaser trailer, with the three lead actresses 
performing their martial arts moves in front of a fiery background, was not 
exactly cause to break out the champagne glasses.</P>
<P>Imagine, then, the delightful surprise of watching the finished product and 
gradually realizing that I haven't had this much fun at the movies all year. 
In a nutshell, "Charlie's Angels" is an unequivocal success--a highly 
entertaining, funny, exciting, no-holds-barred, bubblegum triumph of the way 
to make a great action-comedy, as well as a rambunctious female empowerment 
fantasy.</P>
<P>Tough-girl Dylan (Drew Barrymore), sexy sweetheart Natalie (Cameron Diaz), 
and ultra-intelligent Alex (Lucy Liu) are Charlie's Angels: a trio of strong 
young women who work for mystery millionaire Charlie (voiced by John Forsythe 
and never seen) and his personal assistant Bosley (Bill Murray) to keep the 
world safe from nasty villains and megalomaniacs. Their latest mission is to 
rescue an electronics genius by the name of Knox (Sam Rockwell), who has been 
kidnapped by wealthy thief Roger Corwin (Tim Curry) and his silent henchman 
(Crispin Glover).</P>
<P>A comedic rendition of the countless James Bond flicks--only twenty times 
more fun and original--"Charlie's Angels" is not so much about its thin 
storyline as it is about the refreshingly lightweight style which feature 
film debut director McG (whose previous credits include several music videos) 
evokes. From the stunning opening sequence that begins on an airplane and 
ends on a sailboat, to the climax set around an ancient castle alongside the 
California coast, director McG clearly knows exactly how to balance all of 
his various genres, including action, comedy, and romance, for optimum 
effect. The movie is far-fetched, yet so shamelessly tongue-in-cheek as to 
never seem anything less than innocently believable.</P>
<P>If there was ever any on-set strife between the cast members, you won't find 
any signs of it here. Each actor finds just the perfect tone for their 
character, and they all elicit an overwhelming joy of performing. 
Actress-producer Drew Barrymore (1999's "Never Been Kissed") has found in her 
character of Dylan a chance to show off her comic flair to a greater effect 
than she ever has before. Cameron Diaz (1999's "Being John Malkovich"), as 
Natalie, is hilariously klutzy, yet smart, and has a smile so warm and 
beautiful that she sells every moment she appears here. Rounding out the 
angels is Lucy Liu (2000's "Shanghai Noon"), as streetwise Alex, who provides 
a welcome contrast to her tonally sunnier costars, and equips herself in her 
kung-fu-style action sequences quite nicely. Together, Barrymore, Diaz, and 
Liu are charismatic joys who obviously had just as much fun making the film 
as it is to watch it.</P>
<P>Adding an extra amount of amusement to the proceedings is the constant stream 
of costume changes the actresses goes through, as they head undercover posing 
in different disguises. There is particular entertainment to be had in a 
sequence in which Barrymore and Diaz crossdress, while the leather-clad, 
whip-striking Liu poses as a dominatrix-cum-efficiency-expert and bewitches 
every student in the class.
The supporting cast is appropriately over-the-top, and all the more enjoyable 
because of it. Bill Murray (1998's "Rushmore") returns to his purely jokey 
roots with Bosley, and makes a big impression with a not-so-large role. Sam 
Rockwell (1999's "The Green Mile") is lively and magnetic as the kidnapped 
Knox; Tim Curry is at his slimy best as Roger Corwin; and Tom Green (2000's 
"Road Trip"), Matt LeBlanc (TV's "Friends"), and Luke Wilson (1999's "Blue 
Streak") are effective as the gals' love interests.</P>
<P>Special notice must be made to Crispin Glover (2000's "Nurse Betty"), whose 
brooding role as The Thin Man is one of the most memorably nasty and 
appropriately animated villains to come around in years. Watch Glover 
closely; he doesn't have one line of dialogue throughout, but simply by the 
drifty way in which he carries himself and smokes his cigarettes, as if he 
were a famed magician performing his most popular trick, does he create a 
wholly fresh and despicably enjoyable character.</P>
<P>With sunny, attractive cinematography; fast-paced editing; a sharply clever 
screenplay by Ryan Rowe, Ed Solomon, and John August; a standout soundtrack 
that wittily includes innumerable songs featuring the word, "angel," in them, 
as well as a nice mixture of music from the '70s, '80s, '90s, and the present 
day; and awesome stunts not matched since last summer's "Mission: Impossible 
2," "Charlie's Angels" is a film that is unquestionably better than it has 
any right to be. The movie makes no halfhearted effort to be anything more 
than a happily diverting popcorn film, and by doing so, exceeds the viewer's 
highest expectations. By being unpretentious in the extreme, it is the most 
invigorating thing that has happened to the action genre in the last decade. 
"Charlie's Angels" is F-U-N, the type of movie the term, 'rollicking good 
time,' was invented for.</P>
<PRE>DVD Review</PRE>
<P>How Does It Look?
Presented in its original anamorphic widescreen theatrical aspect ratio of 
2:35:1, the picture quality on "Charlie's Angels" is a godsend. Filmed in 
brightly-chosen colors and hues, the clarity of the picture jumps off the 
screen from the first frame to the last. There are no artifacts, zero grain, 
nonexistent shimmering, and no bleeding of the colors. The treatment this 
"Special Edition" DVD got is, in one word, beautiful. Reference quality work.</P>
<P>How Does It Sound?
In the audio department, you case choose from English 5.1 (Dolby Digital), 
2-Channel (Dolby Digital), or a French track. Whichever way you play it, you 
will not be disappointed. Filled to the breaking point with music and action, 
you are sure to get a lot of groundbreaking play from your speakers. Dialogue 
is consistently clear, as well, making this DVD's audio treatment wonderfully 
alive.</P>
<P>Special Features?
Columbia Pictures didn't title the "Charlie's Angels" DVD a "special edition" 
for nothing. With so many bonus attractions, it's admittedly difficult to 
decide what to explore first. I began with the Screen-Specific Audio 
Commentary By Director McG and Cinematographer Russell Carpenter. McG and 
Carpenter are obviously good friends who got along very well, and had a lot 
of fun, while making this motion picture. Their enthusiasm for the finished 
product, and everything that went into its making, definitely shows through 
on this fast-paced and entertaining track that has no empty space, nor does 
it ever grow boring. Behind-the-scenes stories and talk of the actors make up 
much of their discussion, as do their intentions for what they were trying to 
make (a FUN movie).</P>
<P>Also found within are no less than six Making-Of Featurettes, each running 
between 2 1/2 and 8 minutes in length. "Getting G'd Up" is a heartfelt, if 
too brief, tribute to the joyful personality and talent of director McG. "The 
Master and the Angels" shows the kung-fu-style training that stars Drew 
Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu went through to prepare for their 
physically demanding roles. This is perhaps the most intriguing of the 
featurettes, as it gives a glimpse into the tough stuff that the stars went 
through to prepare for their roles. Most entertaining is a look at Barrymore 
screaming in agony after doing an umpteenth stomach crunch. "Welcome to Angel 
World" details the production design and set decoration of the film, while "
Angelic Effects" takes a fascinating look at how all of the visual effects in 
the movie were brought to cinematic life. Major work was done on a blue 
screen, to be sure, but it was surprising to see that much of it was actually 
filmed (such as the girls, albeit stunt doubles) jumping off a cliff as the 
castle behind them explodes. "Angelic Attire: Dressing Cameron, Drew, and Lucy
" is a relatively fluffy, brief piece that shows you how each of the actress' 
costumes were chosen, based on the realities of the characters they were 
playing. Finally, "Wired Angels" is a shot-for-shot replay of the fight scene 
between the three angels and Crispin Glover's Thin Man, but with all of the 
wires still prominently featured.</P>
<P>The special features aren't over quite yet, as there are three Deleted and 
Extended Scenes, preceded by an explanation from director McG on why they 
were excised. While none of the scenes are outright bad, it is easy to see 
why they were cut out, as they prove to not be vital to the film's tone or 
tight pacing. The bathroom scene, however, should be noted for being an exact 
replica of the bathroom in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 masterpiece, "The Shining."</P>
<P>There is an Outtakes and Bloopers section that is a mere repeat of the 
outtakes shown during the end credits of the film. There are also 2 Music 
Videos, for Destiny's Child's snappy "Independent Women Part 1" and Apollo 
Four Forty's "Charlie's Angels 2000," Talent Files, Production Notes on the 
inside booklet of the disc's box, and Theatrical Trailers. The trailers 
include the teaser and the full trailer for "Charlie's Angels," as well as 
trailers for "My Best Friend's Wedding," "Vertical Limit," "Crouching Tiger, 
Hidden Dragon," and two upcoming features: "The Adventures of Joe Dirt," with 
David Spade, and this summer's "Final Fantasy."</P>
<P>The Animated Menus boast great, dynamic showmanship, and like the film 
itself, are full of energy and originality.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line
"Charlie's Angels" remains the most entertaining film I saw last year, and 
with this "Collector's Edition" DVD, it is a must-buy for all fans of the 
format and the movie. And as I have heard mentioned before, if you didn't 
like the movie, then you simply didn't "get" it. While I'm certainly open to 
all opinions and criticisms, it is honestly difficult to believe that anyone 
could watch "Charlie's Angels," and not find it 100% fun.</P>
