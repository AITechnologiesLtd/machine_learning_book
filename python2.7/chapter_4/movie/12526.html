<P>Propelled with no music score, the heart pounding drama of 'The China
Syndrome' carries the entire film.  For younger readers, in the spring
of 1979, on March 28 to be exact, at 4 a.m., a serious accident occurred
at the Three Mile Island nuclear facility in Pennsylvania, outside of
Harrisburg.  In today's day and age of electronic media where breaking
news is almost instant after a major event happens, the fury over this
fiasco would have been ferocious.  The public didn't need the electronic
media in 1979 in the well known forms of the Internet, modems, cell
phones or faxes because there was something else interesting to talk
about.  'The China Syndrome', starring Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda and a
very fresh Michael Douglas, was released on March 16, just twelve days
before the actual nightmare in Pennsylvania.  Experts scoffed, critics
charged that the film was an unrealistic portrayal of a potentially
serious matter, comparing it to what they thought was the impossible
scenario painted in 'Dr Strangelove' where a U.S. general goes insane,
and on his own, launches a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union using an
alternative war plan.  It was, perhaps, one of the most under rated
controversies of all time in terms of timing a motion picture with an
actual occurrence.</P>
<P>I saw the film on my own and again one week later with relatives and
ended up seeing it a total of four times in the theatre and I own a
videotape of it which is well worn.  It's plot would make a great
episode of television's 'The X-Files' by working in some paranormal
phenomenon to subdue fans of the show, such as myself.  'The X-Files'
did a two-part episode in Season 4 based on the TWA Flight 800 tragedy
which took place in the summer of 1996.  I think the Three Mile Island
story was over shadowed somewhat by Russia's Chernobyl disaster in 1986
where a nuclear facility actually exploded and that incident was far
worse and had far reaching consequences for parts of the entire planet.
One of the reasons I'm writing this review is so that the memory of
Three Mile Island and Chernobyl will be activated in the minds of people
everywhere from time to time, whenever they log on to this review no
matter where they live in the world.</P>
<P>A veteran of two Academy awards and multiple nominations, Jack Lemmon
starred as a conscience stricken nuclear plant worker who, along with
others by his side, discovers that a serious accident may trigger an
even worse one later on.  When Lemmon is on the screen you don't care
about anything else that's happening, he's that good and he's the best
one in the film.</P>
<P>The setting is Southern California, in the Los Angeles area, where a
television news reporter (Jane Fonda) and a camera man (Michael Douglas)
are filming a documentary on the day to day activities of a nuclear
facility.  They are escorted by a public relations man who keeps them
informed and watches their every move, every step of the way.  The
television crew arrives at the room where Lemmon and his co-workers are
employed.  The t.v. people are on the above floor and witness the
accident mentioned in the above paragraph while looking through a glass
window, commonly found in factories, separating the clerical offices
from the other work stations.  Douglas secretly films the entire
accident through the glass and as he and Fonda arrive back at the
station, the unauthorized photography is a matter for serious debate
with their employer.  Douglas is furious that the station won't air the
footage, alleging a cover-up between the station and the executives at
the nuclear plant.</P>
<P>The investigation into the disaster is swift, relatively thorough but
misses something.  This troubles Lemmon, as he cannot accept the plant
being back in operation so soon.  At a loss of $500,000 a day to the
company that operates the facility, money seems to have a language all
its own.  That's not news.  What is fascinating about 'The China
Syndrome' is that it moves not only as a stirring drama, but as a well
placed thriller that is thought provoking and is undeniably
entertaining.  It looks so realistic as it moves from scene to scene and
its harrowing climax involving Lemmon's suspicions of danger actually
happening is comparable in feeling to the atmosphere experienced by a
multiple alarm fire or a military ambush.</P>
<P>The lacerating tragedy of the film is developed well from the start by
director James Bridges and by the script written by him and two others,
T.S. Cook and Mike Gray.  They all received an Oscar nomination for
their screenplay.  Lemmon and Fonda were nominated for Best Actor and
Actress, respectively, and I still say that Lemmon gave the best
performance of the five but lost to a deserving Dustin Hoffman in
'Kramer vs. Kramer'.  Lemmon was still more deserving.  If he had more
screen time in the film then I believe he would have won.  Compounded
with the fact that Lemmon had won before for Best Supporting Actor in
1955 for 'Mister Roberts' and in 1973 as Best Actor in 'Save the Tiger',
his defeat was more understandable but not necessarily excusable.
Lemmon's penchant for playing good guys made his portrayal of a decent
man getting stiffed all the more powerful.  Jane Fonda and Michael
Douglas shine strongly in their roles and if Michael Douglas were more
well known to movie audiences in 1979, he might have received a Best
Supporting Actor nomination but Douglas did win in 1987 as Best ACTOR in
'Wall Street'.  Jane Fonda had also won twice before being nominated in
this film.  She won in 1971 for 'Klute' as Best Actress and in 1978 in
the same category for 'Coming Home'.  In my opinion, 'The China
Syndrome' should have received a whole fistful of Oscar nominations in
such categories as Best Picture, Director for James Bridges and several
technical categories but it never happened.  I suppose the film will
have to live on without peer recognition but audience recognition can be
just as significant.</P>
