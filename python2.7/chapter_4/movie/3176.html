<PRE>     "[READY TO WEAR/PRET-A-PORTER] is just a silly little movie, it's 
not a serious epic.  So just enjoy, laugh with it, have a good time.  
It's no big deal." 
          - Robert Altman, director of READY TO WEAR </PRE>
<P>     One wonders whether Robert Altman arrived at that conclusion
before or after the much-anticipated READY TO WEAR was complete.
Despite some delicious moments, this sluggish, overlong, halfhearted
satire feels like a movie that wanted to go somewhere but never got
there.  With punches pulled and fangs capped, this look at high fashion
is not at all what was expected from the director of THE PLAYER, one of
the most vicious and biting sendups of the last two decades.</P>
<P>     First of all, there are far too many characters.  A cast list like
the one above looks good on paper, but no actor gets more than a
handful of scenes, which leads to a pervasive sense of apathy regarding
almost everyone.  Who cares if Marcello Mastrioanni's mysterious Sergio
finds his lost love (Sophia Loren)?  Neither of them seems any more
substantial than the garments worn by the models in the climactic
fashion show.</P>
<P>     At least three of the subplots could have been excised
altogether.  One involves Tim Robbins and Julia Roberts as American
journalists thrown together in the same hotel room.  Another pairs Teri
Garr and Danny Aiello as a couple with a "dark" secret, and a third
follows New York Times reporter Lili Taylor as she researches a story.
Eliminating these might have streamlined READY TO WEAR to make it more
palatable.  It certainly would have cut down the running time.</P>
<P>     It's not that Altman can't work with a large cast--he did an
admirable job in SHORT CUTS.  The problem here is that his stories
aren't particularly well-focused.  The best scenes are often those
where dialogue overlaps and the various subplots intersect.</P>
<P>     That's not to claim there's nothing effective in READY TO WEAR.
In fact, three of the stories are vintage Altman.  One, involving the
cutthroat machinations of three fashion magazine editors (Sally
Kellerman, Tracey Ullman, and Linda Hunt) to woo a sleazy superstar
photographer (Stephen Rea), has a bite to it.  The attempts of fashion
queen Simone Lowenthal (Anouk Aimee) to keep her empire out of the
hands of a cowboy boot maker (Lyle Lovett) takes a pointed turn that
leads to the scene almost everyone seems to be talking about.  And Kim
Basinger single-handedly skewers the shallow manner in which the news
media obsesses over fashion.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, READY TO WEAR doesn't have enough substance to
justify its length, nor does it possess enough raw humor to leaven the
flat spots.  The jokes are inconsistently funny, with some being worth
giggles, some eliciting hearty chuckles, and some prompting little more
than shrugs.</P>
<P>     Altman is a marvelously talented director.  There's no denying
that.  Films like M*A*S*H, NASHVILLE, THE PLAYER, and SHORT CUTS have
proven his skill several times over.  And, while READY TO WEAR is far
from his best work, neither is it equivalent to much of the trash
present on so many multiplex screens this season.  The fashion industry
can heave a sigh of relief that Altman has spared it the full force of
his guns.  This film isn't likely to provoke much outrage from anyone
except those expecting something as searing as THE PLAYER.  READY TO
WEAR keeps its jabs clothed, and by the time it strips away the layers
of covering (both literally and figuratively), it's a little too late.</P>
