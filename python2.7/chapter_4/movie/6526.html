<P>WARNING: This review contains spoilers.</P>
<P>A brilliant, if rather loose, adaptation of Michael Ondaatje's popular 
prizewinning novel, THE ENGLISH PATIENT is an intellectually intense 
and psychologically complex film that conveys the haunting power of 
memory. A great screen romance in the tradition of CASABLANCA and DR. 
ZHIVAGO, the film is also a tragedy and a fascinating mystery. 
Moreover, THE ENGLISH PATIENT takes on such subjects as the horror of  
war and the power of love.</P>
<P>The film is set in the late 1930s and early 1940s against the backdrop 
of World War II. Most of the earlier events take place in the North 
African desert, while the later part of the story is set in an 
abandoned ruined monastery a few miles from Florence, Italy. However, 
a nonlinear narrative structure is employed throughout, giving the 
film a dreamlike, enigmatic quality. </P>
<P>The film begins and ends with a sequence of images of a man and a 
woman  in a two-seat biplane flying over sand dunes. A little later, 
the plane is shot down and explodes into flames. Everything about the 
plane and its occupants is a mystery that the film unravels slowly. 
The mystery is maintained throughout the film; what happened to the 
plane and its occupants is not completely revealed until the end. </P>
<P>The title THE ENGLISH PATIENT refers to the man in the plane who,  
after being rescued in the North African desert by a nomadic tribe, 
ends up in the caravan of a field hospital. Since he has been burned 
beyond recognition and he claims to be unable to remember anything, 
his identity cannot be established any further than a guess at his 
nationality based upon the sounds of his speech. </P>
<P>During the waning days of the war, a young Canadian nurse named Hana 
(Juliette Binoche) takes pity on the man and leaves her unit so she 
can stay with him at an isolated bombed-out monastery in Tuscany where 
he can die in peace. It is at the monastery that the film begins its 
extensive use of flashbacks. The patient is given morphine by Hana for 
the intense pain from his burns, and he drifts in and out of 
consciousness. It emerges that the patient is actually a Hungarian 
count named Laszlo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), who begins to reminisce 
about a torrid, adulterous affair in prewar North Africa with an  
Englishwoman named Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). With his 
body broken and its pain numbed by morphine, his memory of Katherine 
is the only thing that still has vibrant life for him. These 
flashbacks are presented in a manner that is both emotionally and 
cinematically extremely vivid to emphasize the indelible nature of 
this love. </P>
<P>We eventually learn that Almasy's affair with Katherine unleashed a 
tragic chain of events that rippled through his own life and the lives 
of others. A man named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), whose thumbs were 
cut off by the Nazis, comes to the monastery to kill Almasy because he 
believes Almasy partially responsible for the mutilation of his 
hands. But after hearing Almasy's story, Caravaggio cannot bring 
himself to kill him. Thus the film is not only about the price that 
Almasy pays for passion, it is also about forgiveness.</P>
<P>Hana, Almasy, and Caravaggio are joined at the monastery by Kip 
(Naveen Andrews), a young Sikh from India who is an expert at 
deactivating mines and bombs. A sweet love develops between Kip and 
the nurse, serving as a counterpoint to the shady affair between 
Almasy and Katherine.</P>
<P>There are many good performances in this film, but I thought that the 
strongest belonged to Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas. Not only 
was their acting superb, but they had the chemistry of a great screen 
couple.</P>
<P>Ralph Fiennes gives an extraordinary performance as Count Laszlo 
Almasy. He portrays a man whose intellectual veneer cannot completely 
mask his heart's capacity for passion. What was remarkable to me was 
how Fiennes was able to convey such a wide spectrum of emotion using 
his eyes and voice when he was wearing a mask of scars.</P>
<P>Kristin Scott Thomas as Katherine Clifton is a self-confident femme 
fatale. Her intelligence and spirit are as much a part of her sex 
appeal as the way she looks. She is brave enough to take on the 
dangers of the desert, but she also betrays her husband with 
sang-froid. </P>
<P>Juliette Binoche's wonderfully expressive face is her greatest asset 
in this role, bringing to life the angelic compassion, child-like joy, 
and the spectrum of other emotions--including despair--that Hana 
experiences. </P>
<P>Naveen Andrews does a good job of portraying Kip. Like Almasy, he is a 
man whose cool surface covers his inner capacity for emotion. By day 
he defuses bombs with cool deliberation; by night he is Hana's ardent 
lover. </P>
<P>Dafoe's Carvaggio is a dangerous and mysterious man who masks his 
anger with a strange charm. Yet, Caravaggio is not an entirely 
convincing character in the movie. I think this is because he is 
reduced to little more than a sketch in the screenplay, rather than 
because of Dafoe's acting. </P>
<P>Colin Firth is quite good as Katherine's husband, Geoffrey Clifton. 
He is an affable fellow; yet when he realizes that he has become a 
cuckold, his face reflects a quiet fury.</P>
<P>Those who have read Ondaatje's novel should be forewarned that the 
story told in the movie differs in many ways, both large and small. 
The biggest difference is that the film expands the love story between 
the Count and Katherine, while drastically curtailing the roles of the 
other characters. In particular, the role of Kip is much smaller in 
the film than in the novel.</P>
<P>Although the movie is not faithful to the book from a literary point 
of view, it does find a cinematic equivalent to the poetic qualities 
of the novel: The story makes a breathtaking transition to the more 
visually assertive medium of film. I loved the way the wonderfully 
cinematic imagery worked in concert with the evocative story. From the 
opening sequence, this film is visually stunning. The plane flies over 
gracefully undulating sand dunes that resemble the curves of the human 
body; this visually sets the scene and foreshadows the story in a way 
that words alone never could. The flight over the desert sequence that 
begins and ends the film is dazzling; it is one of the most 
emotionally powerful sequences I've ever seen. And the equivalent of 
the novel's complexity is found in the film's visual density, with 
images echoing other images. For example, when Hana's lover Kip 
designs a device with pulleys that lift Hana up to view the frescos of 
the monastery by the light of flares, the opening sequence of lovers 
in flight is echoed.</P>
<P>Also, this film, like the novel, often juxtaposes both horror and 
lyrical beauty. One sequence where this worked particularly well was 
when Almasy and Katherine were caught in the sandstorm. Katherine 
watches the sandstorm on the horizon hovering like a shroud of fog--an 
image that is both gorgeous and ominous. She is oblivious to the 
danger until Almasy warns her and rushes her into the vehicle where 
they wait out the storm. While they are in the vehicle, the imminent 
danger brings down their emotional armor and they bond.</P>
<P>This is a superbly crafted and hard-hitting film that is 
intellectually and emotionally demanding, but I think that it is well 
worth the effort. Every aspect of this film is exemplary. The 
writer-director Anthony Minghella has created a masterpiece. This film 
is not light entertainment, but if you are up for a serious film, 
movies just don't get much better than this. </P>
