<P>At the risk of making a throwaway pun, "Bedazzled," directed by Harold Ramis 
(1993's "Groundhog Day"), is a devilishly enjoyable and savvy comedy that 
ends of packing quite a heavier punch by its conclusion than could have ever 
been expected. A loose remake of the 1967 Dudley Moore-starrer of the same 
name, the film is one of those rare cases in which the movie completely 
blindsides you, both because of its vast improvement over the unextraordinary 
theatrical trailer, and because of the unextraordinary trailer, which wisely 
does not even hint at how utterly imaginative and clever the proceedings are. </P>
<P>Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) is a gawky computer consultant who is a 
genuinely nice guy that, nevertheless, is the type of eager-to-please person 
most people try to avoid having to confront in a conversation. Amid his 
odd-man-out treatment, his one true love is Alison Gardner (Frances 
O'Connor), a fetching coworker of Elliot's for three years who doesn't even 
know he exists. After a failed attempt to strike up a conversation with 
Alison at a bar, Elliot is distracted by a sultry, alluringly sexy woman 
(Elizabeth Hurley) who informs him that she is the Devil incarnate, and has 
come to grant him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. Following a round of 
persuasion tactics, the Devil convinces Elliot to sign the contract and wish 
away. But there's only one hitch: in her dastardly plan, with every wish he 
makes, the Devil wickedly misconstrues things so that they not work out for 
him.</P>
<P>One of the genuine pleasures of "Bedazzled" is in not only seeing where each 
of Elliot's wishes takes him, but how the Devil conditions each wish to only 
turn out negatively for him. Aside from the tiresome, overlong first 
vignette, in which he wishes to be rich, powerful, and married to Alison, 
only to become a Colombian drug lord under attack whose wife despises him, 
the movie is unadulterated fun from beginning to end, even when it appears to 
be nothing more than harmless fluff. </P>
<P>Had "Bedazzled" stayed on its predictable main course from beginning to end, 
the picture would be admirable, but hardly memorable. However, the 
screenplay, by Larry Gelbart, Harold Ramis, and Peter Tolan, is a rare comedy 
straight out of mainstream Hollywood that is actually ambitious in both its 
ideas and snappy writing, and concludes with several emotionally rewarding 
scenes that do not completely abandon their humorous roots, but clearly and 
wisely hold a valid moral, like any useful fairy tale. </P>
<P>In a multilayered role that, once and for all, ties up all doubts about his 
clear talent as a performer, Brendan Fraser (1999's "Dudley Do-Right") not 
only carries the film as the lovable, insecure Elliot, but also is given the 
chance to jump into the part and become (among others) a well-loved 7 1/2' 
pro basketball player, a highly intelligent and fashionable gay man, and the 
world's most emotionally sensitive guy. After a string of forgettable 
characters (including the aforementioned "Dudley Do-Right" and 1999's "The 
Mummy"), Fraser is back with a movie that fully exposes how very good he can 
be.</P>
<P>In what is inarguably the best performance I've seen her give, to date, 
Elizabeth Hurley singlehandedly steals the show as the "Princess of 
Darkness." Clearly exhibiting that she's having a fun time, Hurley digs into 
the tricky role with great relish, being both very funny and, at times, 
surprisingly threatening. What is so impressive about the writing is the way 
the movie dabbles in slapstick every now and again, but despite its fantastic 
nature, seems to be planted firmly in reality when dealing with the 
characters. Hurley's Lucifer could have easily been written as an evil, 
one-dimensional type, but she isn't; it is clear that she likes Elliot and 
maybe even grows to care about his well-being, but is, nonetheless, stuck 
going against his yearning for happiness due to her decidedly high title as 
king (or is it queen?) of the underworld.</P>
<P>Throughout the just-right 92-minute running time, "Bedazzled" is whimsical 
and reasonably lighthearted, but because Elliot has, indeed, sold his soul to 
Satan, the viewer is understandable to wonder how exactly the movie could 
conclude with a happy ending. Without giving any details away, director 
Harold Ramis finds the perfect climactic approach, striking a satisfying 
chord and holding it until the end credits. It's not every week that you see 
a movie that surpasses all expectations (no matter how high or low they may 
be) to become a first-rate film worth seeing by all, but "Bedazzled" does 
just that. It's a wonderfully original and entertaining comedy--the rarest of 
breeds.</P>
