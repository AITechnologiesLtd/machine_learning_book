<PRE>JFK
**** OF **** grade is A+</PRE>
<P>JFK is about one man's crusade for the truth in the assassination of
John F. Kennedy.  This man, Jim Garrison (played marvelously by Kevin
Costner) is district attorney of New Orleans, and slowly becomes
obsessed with the Kennedy case.  He investigates the sloppy case, while
dealing separately with family problems, press leaks, death threats,
fighting among staff and someone bugging his office.  What suspects he
does interview seem shady and unreliable, as he becomes further emerged
in his case. </P>
<P>JFK is gripping and brilliantly written and directed, this is also the
birth and height of Stone's truly original, artistic approach to movie
making.  JFK offers an absolutely gripping tale that weaves with
wonderful dialogue and characters and turns with pure movie making
flare.  It is to Stone's credit that we are captivated and fixated
during the film's over three hours of running time.</P>
<P>He acting is also brilliant and amazing, with an all star cast that rips
up the screen with fury.  Kevin Costner has his career best role in this
film, the best performance he will ever give.  Sissy Spacek has a great
turn as his growingly annoyed and concerned wife.  Gary Oldman, Tommy
Lee Jones, Joe Pesci are superb in small but important roles.</P>
<P>Stone was criticized as being a vast conspiracy theorist after the
release of this film and that is a shame because this film is more
interested in the truth than concocting some nutty theory about who
killed Kennedy.  This film has the same goal as its hero Jim Garrison
does as they both approach it fast and hard.  They aren't willing to
compromise to suit everybody and don't care if you disagree with their
opinions.  JFK, though based on two books (Crossfire: The Plot to Kill
Kennedy & On the Trail of the Assassins), should not be taken as a
documentary and some scenes may crumble if put to intense scrutiny.  </P>
<P>What is so wonderful about JFK is that it puts that intense scrutiny on
the government, Warren's report and autopsy/police records.  Many
inconsistencies and impossibilities are seen as the theories are
questioned and made to crumble.  I guess JFK may be conspiratorial and
somewhat inaccurate BUT so are the reports we are offered, most of which
are incomplete or incomprehensible to a common sense.</P>
