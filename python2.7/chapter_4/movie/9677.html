Retrospective: Full Metal Jacket (1987)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 89</PRE>
<P>Another Vietnam War movie?  What can be said about the Vietnam War
that hasn't been said already?  "Full Metal Jacket" answers that
question, and demonstrates that there is always room for a
great film, even if the genre has already been thoroughly explored.</P>
<P>"Full Metal Jacket" is really two different films, with Matthew
Modine's everyman character bridging the gap.  The first half
has several dozen marine recruits undergoing basic training,
under constant verbal and physical abuse from a tough-as-nails
drill sergeant (R. Lee Ermey, who should have won Best Supporting
Actor, even if he was a marine drill sergeant in real life).
His favorite target is fat, slow recruit nicknamed Gomer Pyle
(Vincent D'Onofrio).  Those who are considering joining the 
marines should see this film.  It may change their mind!</P>
<P>Only three mild criticisms about the first half, which is
superior to the second half.  Out of the large number of
marine recruits, only four (Joker, Snowball, Pyle and Cowboy)
have speaking parts.  Did the writers think we would get
confused with too many characters, or was the producer
unwilling to pay extras to speak?  Also, Modine frequently
does a John Wayne impersonation, which is not very good!
Finally, Pyle has a weird character turn that doesn't seem
likely despite all the abuse and brainwashing he has received.</P>
<P>The second half of the film has Modine in Vietnam, covering the
war first as a journalist and then as a soldier.  The early
scenes of this second half are outstanding, but when Modine
finally sees action the film declines slightly, though still
excellent.  War is hell, but in this case not quite as
interesting.</P>
<P>One observation is that the American soldiers have great
respect for the North Vietnam soldiers, but contempt and
bitterness towards the people of South Vietnam.  This may
be due to its corruption, depicted through extended scenes
of negotiations with prostitutes, or the notion that
South Vietnam was not grateful for the "assistance" of
Uncle Sam.  Actually, given scenes of a soldier in a helicopter
machine-gunning every Vietnamese he sees, of any age or gender,
it is clear why the South Vietnamese weren't so grateful!</P>
<P>Not the greatest war movie ever (I still favor "All Quiet on
the Western Front") but probably one of the best Vietnam 
movies ("Apocalypse Now" was overlong and lacked necessary 
focus.) and the best basic training movie.</P>
