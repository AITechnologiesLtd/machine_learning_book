PRETTY MAN</PRE>
<PRE>NOTTING HILL
Directed by Roger Michell
Screenplay by Richard Curtis
With Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant
Lensic     PG-13     125 min.</PRE>
<P>     Hugh Grant gets chastised from time to time in the press for the
encroaching familiarity of his mannerisms, but as he's been making
fewer movies lately (or we've been getting fewer of them), he seems to
be wearing better again.  The diffident dip of the bushy head of hair
(here homage is paid with the nickname "Floppy"), the hesitations in
speech -- they all add up to real charm here, as Grant teams up with
Julia Roberts in a "Pretty Woman"- ish romantic fairy tale in which he
gets the woman's role.</P>
<P>Roberts is the rich and powerful figure, here an American movie
star promoting a blockbuster film in London, where Grant has a little
travel bookshop in Notting Hill.  She wanders into his store, a little
later he spills orange juice on her and has her back to his nearby
house to clean up, and she thanks him with a kiss that goes a chapter
or two beyond the perfunctory peck on the cheek you might expect.  A
few days later she calls, they meet, he asks her out, and they go to
his best friends' house for a dinner among common people.</P>
<P>There are several things that take this material and raise it to
the level of delightful, satisfying entertainment.  The script by
Richard Curtis ("4 Weddings and a Funeral") has enough solid wit to
carry it through heavy stretches of predictability, and Roger Michell,
who directed the best of the Jane Austen movies ("Persuasion"), guides
it all with a nimble hand.  They've loaded it with in-jokes (like
Roberts being mistaken by an adoring fan for Demi Moore) that are not
so obscure that we can't be amused.  They've given us the supporting
cast of supportive friends that worked so well in "4 Weddings",
including Grant's slovenly Welsh roommate Rys Ifans, and the lovely
Gina McKee, his former girlfriend who is married to his best friend
Tim McInnerny.</P>
<P>And they've given us Grant and Roberts, who provide good
chemistry in their reversal roles.  It is Roberts who is the moving
force in the relationship, Roberts who moves in and plants the kiss,
who makes the call, who dictates the pace of play.  Grant is the
adoring planet circling this radiant sun, and he pulls it off with a
self- deprecating humor that makes him the focus of our interest and
really carries the picture.  We might, however, wish for a little more
character delineation.  We don't expect an awful lot of men in
romantic situations, but we're used to women requiring something more
profound than a pretty face with which to fall in love.</P>
<P>But why quibble?  Summer's here, and this is a romantic comedy to
lift us into it.</P>
