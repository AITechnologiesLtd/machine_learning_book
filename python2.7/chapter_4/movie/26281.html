<PRE>Girl, Interrupted (1999)

<P>Girl, Interrupted is a Don't Miss film. It is also, whole-heartedly, a 
Winona Ryder film.</P>
<P>Girl, Interrupted follows a troubled girl named Susanna Kaysen (Ryder) who 
may or may not have a borderline personality disorder. After Susanna tries 
to kill herself, she is sent to a mental institution by her parents to 
recover. What we see is that Susanna doesn't really have a disorder but is 
more of a slacker who spoils herself. At the institution, Claymore, she 
meets all sorts of women with real disorders. The most enigmatic is Lisa 
(Angelina Jolie) who is a sociopath. The two befriend each other and we see 
their friendship bloom then wither. Girl, Interrupted is about a girl who 
discovers herself, and does just that in a mental institution. The story is 
based on the memoirs of Susanna Kaysen and covers about two years of her 
life starting in 1967.</P>
<P>The performances are excellent. Ryder as Kaysen puts up a wonderful 
performance. Jolie does well also, but I'm starting to think that although 
she is a wonderful actress and is always believable, her range in roles is 
not as wide. She's always doing a rebellious type and though she does it 
good, I wish she would expand her roles a bit. It was good to see Whoopi 
Goldberg in the film as the head of the ward that Susanna and Lisa live in.</P>
<P>Worth mentioning is the score by Mychael Danna which works very well with 
the movie. The song selection for the movie is also excellent. The music in 
the film ties in very well.</P>
