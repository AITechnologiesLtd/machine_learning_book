<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>While watching Ever After, I realized that the only rendition of the
classic tale of Cinderella I had seen is Disney's animated version.  I
became aware of this about halfway into the film, when I noted that it
was going to be hard for the director, Andy Tennant, and his writers to
include fairy godmothers, talking mice, and carriages that turn into
pumpkins after midnight.  Like most children's' stories, I have no
affinity for this particular fairy tale, but Ever After is a
delightfully entertaining re-interpretation of the story.</P>
<P>Drew Barrymore takes center stage in this version, cast as the young
Danielle.  After the untimely death of her father (she's only eight when
he dies), Danielle falls under orders of her stepmother, Rodmilla (a
very wicked Anjelica Huston), and stepsisters (Megan Dodds and Melanie
Lynskey).  Danielle is, of course, a very strong girl because she was
raised from an early age by her father.  Rodmilla sees this as an
advantage, and puts Danielle to hard labor for ten years.  When Danielle
reaches the ripe age of eighteen, she's a confident and hard-working
young woman, in addition to being fantastically attractive.</P>
<P>So, when she meets the Prince Henry (Dougray Scott), heir to the French
throne, he's instantly enthralled with her intelligence (she likes to
read) and passion (she's a socialist).  But, feeling that her status is
not good enough for him, she spins a lie in which she pretends to be a
rich Baroness whenever he's around.  What she doesn't realize is that
Henry is looking for his bride, and that her stepsister, Marguerite
(Dodds), is successfully attempting to win the right to be his wife.</P>
<P>It takes a lot of talent to wring interest out of a story told so many
times, and Tennant proves that he's up to the task.  Visually, the film
is impressive, with nice cinematography, and fantastic sets and
costumes.  I never got the feeling that I was watching something
artificial, or that any of it took place on a sound stage.  Some of the
scenes are truly fantastic, such as the infamous ball.  It's refreshing
to see a Hollywood period piece that actually pays attention to details
(although all the actors have British accents, despite the fact that
they're living in France).  </P>
<P>Tennant is also a gifted storyteller, and he makes this clear in the
passion with which this story is told.  True, some of the scenes are
nearly overdone, but Tennant is a master at payoffs -- there are
numerous segments that thrilled me, and had the audience around me
cheering with excitement.  There won't be an indifferent mind in the
house when Danielle finally has her way with Marguerite, or when Tennant
shows us the best way to take revenge of a wicked stepmother.  And the
film never regresses into banality or stupidity -- Ever After is a fairy
tale, but it's an imaginative and well-executed fairy tale.</P>
<P>Barrymore is luminous in the lead role.  It's nice to see a child actor
that actually made it through the teenage years; Barrymore, in addition,
was one of the few child actors who had talent.  Here, she perfects a
British accent (but shouldn't it have been a French accent?), while
injecting Danielle with multiple layers of intelligence and strength. 
She is the heart of this film, and manages to elevate the already-high
quality of the overall package.  The supporting roles are colorful,
particularly from Huston.  She was clearly born to play this role; her
eyes seethe wickedness even when she isn't speaking.  Scott is also very
good (and very funny) as the spoiled prince.  Dodds, as the bitchy
stepsister, is perfect, while Lynskey (who was fantastic in Heavenly
Creatures) is likable as the good stepsister.</P>
<P>The previews for Ever After didn't look promising; I expected a
thoughtless and dry interpretation of the story.  Instead, I got this
film, which is energetic and charming -- this is Hollywood storytelling
at it's finest.  In addition to crafting a great picture all-around,
Tennant has discovered the best possible way to avoid the magic spells
and talking animals that most people will expect from the story.  He
deserves double bonus points for that.</P>
