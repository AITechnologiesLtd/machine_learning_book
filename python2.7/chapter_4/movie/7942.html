<PRE>                              DOUBLE TEAM
                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Jean-Claude Van Damme, Mickey Rourke, Dennis Rodman, Natacha
Lindinger, Paul Freeman Director: Tsui Hark Producer: Moshe Diamant
Screenplay: Dan Jakoby and Paul Mones based on a story by Dan Jakoby</P>
<P>Another day, another Van Damme action flick with the same recycled
elements of mind numbing violence, gore and countless explosions.</P>
<PRE>With the exception of:</PRE>
<P>1.  The use of innocent children in bullet riddled scenes to help
heighten the lagging suspense. Rourke's child dies in the cross fire
when an undercover operation to capture him, goes badly wrong, and Van
Damme is to blame. Shortly after this horrendous event, the two of them
tussle it out with fists and bombs in a post-natal ward where cots and
babies are tossed, pushed about and used as shields in the ensuing
battle.</P>
<P>Leave the kids alone!!! I cannot condone the manipulation of children as
tools to create excitement for the sole enjoyment of overwhelming,
senseless violence.</P>
<P>2.  A brotherhood of 'cybermonks', and the use of a colourful basketball
star who changes his hair colour more often than Van Damme changes his
clothes.</P>
<P>3.  The addition of a tiger to the final dual in the Colosseum; where
ironically, Van Damme and Rourke play out the roles of gladiators who
have done battle there two thousand years earlier.</P>
<P>4.  And amusingly, the destruction of the Colosseum when there was
nothing left to blow up. I wander how the Italians responded to this?</P>
<P>Strangely enough this movie was not as bad as I imagined it would be.</P>
