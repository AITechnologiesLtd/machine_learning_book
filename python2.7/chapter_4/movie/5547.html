                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1972) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Lately, I've been reviewing an assortment of old movies 
dating back to 1937, and have sparked quite a backlash of comments 
from fans of old movies I've ripped up (FORBIDDEN PLANET OF 
THE APES in particular). A few people have told me I don't like 
these movies because I'm watching them now, as opposed to forty 
years ago, when they didn't seem so stilted and cheesy. They say 
now that I've seen hundreds of newer films that have drastically 
improved on special effects and turned certain plot lines into 
cliches, I can't watch the old ones without thinking of what's 
come later to top it. And of course they're right.</P>
<P>        One person's e-mail comment summed it up best -- I 
have a 90's bias. I naturally prefer the look of a movie from my 
lifetime (1978 on) as opposed to the ridiculous costumes of the 
70's, the out-there decor of the 60's, the terrible sci-fi effects of the 
50's (FORBIDDEN PIE-PLATE PLANET fans take note) and so on, 
even if there is something undeniably dream-like and artistic about 
black-and-white films that Technicolor can't achieve. There are 
movies from those decades I love, but I'm sure they don't seem as 
good in 1996 as they did when they were originally released. And 
I didn't see them when they were originally released because I hadn't 
even been conceived then.</P>
<P>        Unfortunately, I didn't see all these movies in chronological 
order, which means when you go from the special effects of 
JURASSIC PARK or TWISTER to something like FORBIDDEN 
PLANET, you're not impressed. Even the "four-star" movies like 
DELIVERANCE don't seem incredibly great to me. Here's a movie 
that takes almost forty-five minutes to get to one exciting scene and 
then spends the rest of the movie coming down from that. I've seen 
enough of the newer, short-attention-span action and thriller movies 
that when a movie coasts on the strength of one sequence, it doesn't 
earn a four-star rating in my book.</P>
<P>        DELIVERANCE is still a highly-watchable film, if just to 
see an underwear-clad Ned Beatty being violated by two backwoods 
rednecks. Burt Reynolds, in one of his very few worthy cinematic 
appearances (before he'd be relegated to "Evening Shade" reruns 
on The Family Channel and those SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT 
sequels), plays a macho man who gets a few of his buddies (Jon 
Voight, Beatty and Ronny Cox) together for a weekend canoe trip 
down a river wild.</P>
<P>        But this is no Meryl Streep-reclaiming-her-lost-youth flick; 
the river set-up is just an excuse to get them into an unpopulated 
area of the Deep South. We already know from the five-minute 
"Dueling Banjoes" scene at the beginning that the people 'round 
these parts are just plain odd and, when Voight and Beatty get out 
of their canoe to wander through the woods for a while and the 
"Dueling Banjoes" song starts up again on the soundtrack for 
the eighth time, we know something's about to happen.</P>
<P>        That's when the one nail-biting scene in the entire movie 
comes up and Voight and Beatty are under the mercy of the two 
rednecks, in a scene that undoubtedly inspired the creation of 
Quentin Tarantino's Maynard and Zed characters in PULP 
FICTION. (There I go again, making comparisons between old 
and new movies.) After that, it's an hour of anti-climax as Voight 
and Beatty must transport a wounded Reynolds down the river 
and dodge an angry redneck.</P>
<P>        Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie; I was just 
expecting more from it than just the one scene. That's the only 
time it becomes a four-star movie. The rest of the time it hovers 
somewhere between two-and-a-half and three-star status. Reynolds 
contributes an interesting performance toward the beginning, as the 
man obsessed with violence and nature. That's when you get to 
thinking maybe the rest of the movie will have the other three trying 
to escape a psycho Reynolds and his even nuttier hairpiece, but after 
the big rape scene and Reynolds' getting shot, he drops out of the 
movie.</P>
<P>        DELIVERANCE becomes Voight's movie for the last third, 
and he plays a notably less macho character than usual. On paper, 
you'd think Voight would be cast in the Reynolds role and vice 
versa, but by the end you realize his range extends far beyond the 
shoot-em-up action hero. It's good stuff... for the 70's.</P>
