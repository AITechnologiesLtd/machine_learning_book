<P>     The year is 1600 and the country is England.  Orlando (Tilda
Swinton) is a young nobleman who has found favor with Queen Elizabeth I
(Quentin Crisp).  As a result of his relationship as the "son" of her
old age, Orlando is granted the deed to a sizable piece of property.
Ten years later, following the death of his father, Orlando falls in
love with a beautiful Russian princess (Charlotte Valandrey).  After
that relationship ends in tragedy, and following a brief-but-disastrous
flirtation with poetry, Orlando becomes an ambassador to central Asia.
It is now the 18th century and Orlando has lived more than one-hundred
years without showing a day's aging.  But the most remarkable event of
his life--his sudden and unexpected transformation into a woman--is yet
to come.</P>
<P>     ORLANDO is a movie thin on story but thick on elegance and style.
Characters and settings, as well as a brief-but-lavish tour through 400
years of history, take precedence over plot.  Even on its own terms,
the storyline of this film is weak and riddled with contrivances,
questions, and problems.  Writer Sally Potter, adapting from Virginia
Woolf's novel, takes the approach that the narrative is essentially
irrelevant.  Its purpose is to allow explorations of Orlando as he/she
develops over the years, and of the ever-changing attitudes of
society.</P>
<P>     Those that want a detailed examination of how a person copes with
unusual longevity won't find it here.  In fact, other than a throw-away
line by Queen Elizabeth (in which she bestows land upon Orlando under
the condition that he not grow old and wrinkled like her), there is no
explanation given for why the title character neither ages nor dies.
This is taken as a given; one of the many plot points glossed over.</P>
<P>     Another thing that is more-or-less ignored is the mechanism by
which Orlando changes sex.  After a long sleep following a battle in
which he refuses to kill, Orlando wakes up one morning as a woman.  Her
reaction is simple--"Same person ... different sex" and she evidences
little or no surprise at the sudden and unexpected transformation.</P>
<P>     Little issue is made of how other characters react to Orlando's
femaleness.  With the exception of Archduke Harry (John Wood), no one
makes a big deal out of it, although the English courts remove
Orlando's property since a woman cannot legally inherit land.  As one
man comments when the Victorian courts can't determine whether Orlando
is dead or a woman, "They're pretty much the same thing."</P>
<P>     One constant source of interest in ORLANDO is watching how English
society and customs change over the centuries.  After Orlando's
transformation, it's fascinating to watch the size of her gown as it
shrinks from its mammoth proportions of the 1700s to the more "natural"
garb of the present day.  This is only a subtle indication of how women
come to be regarded more as people than property.</P>
<P>     Other than Orlando, there is no character that is around for more
than about 15 or 20 minutes.  Billy Zane, who plays the American
adventurer Shelmerdine, shares billing with lead actress Tilda Swinton,
but is on-screen for only a handful of scenes.  The same is true of
all the other co-stars.</P>
<P>     Swinton gives a masterful performance, displaying amazing range as
both a man and a woman.  Even though her decidedly-feminine appearance
hurts the audience's ability to accept Orlando as a man, the manner in
which Swinton speaks and acts during that part of the film are
masculine.  She is more believable after the transformation, but that's
mainly because her looks now match her mannerisms.</P>
<P>     Sharing the opposite-gender playing with Tilda Swinton is actor
Quentin Crisp, who plays Queen Elizabeth I.  There's no difficulty
accepting Crisp as the wrinkled old queen.  Perhaps this, in addition
to other recent males-playing-females, indicate that, given the right
physical appearance, it's easier to make up a man like a woman than the
other way around.</P>
<P>     Those that go to ORLANDO expecting a tightly-constructed plot will
leave with deflated expectations.  The power of this movie is far
removed from any of the many contrivances centered around the emaciated
storyline.  See ORLANDO for its fabulous costumes, fascinating look at
changing eras, and impressive performance by Tilda Swinton.  Viewing
this film for other reasons will almost certainly lead to a negative
impression.</P>
