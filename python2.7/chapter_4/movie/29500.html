<P>Starring Woody Allen, Helen Hunt, Dan Aykroyd, Brian
Markenson, Wallace Shawn, David Ogden Stiers,
Elizabeth Berkeley, Charlize Theron. Directed by Woody
Allen. Rated PG.</P>
<P>There may have been a time when Woody Allen was a
formidable auteur, but I do not remember it. With his
last two films in particular, he has gone back to the
strategy that propelled Manhattan Murder Mystery:
shrimpy, arrogant, ultra-neurotic protagonist
inadvertently gets himself in [insert predicament] way
over his head. The formula is appealingly simple, and
Allen's ear for distinctive old-codger dialogue as
well as his equally distinctive acting usually lets
him emerge from his often meandering scripts unharmed.
In The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, however, he takes a
few bruises.</P>
<P>Here, Allen plays CW Briggs, an old, old-fashioned,
successful, insurance investigator in the 1940s who
feels threatened by the arrival of the ironically
named Betty Ann (Helen Hunt), a smart, confident
"efficiency expert" who promised boss Chris Magruder
(Dan Aykroyd) to streamline company operations. The
two have a bantering hatred that is required by films
like this to imply a match made in heaven.</P>
<P>One night, at a company shindig, CW and Betty Ann are
pulled on stage to be guinea pigs for a professional
hypnotist. He gives them both key words --
"Constantinople" and "Madagascar," respectively --
that, when uttered, will put them into a deep trance
and make them malleable to instructions. He makes them
pretend that they are honeymooners madly in love with
each other, to the delight of all present. Later, CW
receives a phone call that begins with
"Constantinople," and ends with instructions to steal
the priceless jewels of the Kensington family as only
he can, since his company set up the security system
that protects them.</P>
<P>It doesn't take a CW Briggs to figure out what happens
next. Briggs, who has no idea what he has done, is put
on the case even as evidence mounts against him. He
confides in Betty Ann and seeks help, and then she
herself is forced to criminal action. Part of the fun
is the film's structure: the villain, after his
introduction, is present only as a sinister voice over
the telelphone (though we do see him as he speaks),
and no other character knows what the hell is going
on. This is mass confusion, very skillfully done.</P>
<P>Some people watch Woody Allen movies solely for the
banter between his characters, and The Curse of the
Jade Scorpion has one-liners aplenty. I especially
liked it when CW bursts into a bewildered Betty Ann's
room waving his arms and yelling "Resist the
temptation to scream!" And who can forget the
priceless "When the light hits you a certain way, you
sort of resemble Mussolini."</P>
<P>Still, you can't help but feel a sense of deja vu.
Allen's plots are so slight that his films play like
comic book issues, with the same irrepressible
character being placed in different situations. I
think he needs a new angle; Jade Scorpion is always
tolerable, and sometimes even more than that, but the
formula won't be able to withstand a new installment.</P>
<P>Oh, and Helen Hunt is amazing, as usual. I maintain
that there is nothing this woman can't do (except save
What Women Want. Neither Woody Allen nor his character
is a match. </P>
