<PRE>                                FRENCH KISS
                       A film review by Shaggy Bob
                        Copyright 1995 Shaggy Bob</PRE>
<P>     Is there a law that says the road workers can only work on nice
smooth surface?  I mean every time they repave a road, they immediately
dig it up and do some stuff on it.  After which, you have an uneven
road with bunch of patches on it.  And if they come around to repave
the road again (after forever and few alignment adjustments), the whole
series of road work begins again (so you can never have a nice road).</P>
<P>     Speaking of missed cues, FRENCH KISS came out so I had to go check
it out.  It's about this woman who got dumped by her fiancee while he
went on a business trip to Paris.  And she's determined to get this
looser back for some reason.  Ahh, women -- I'll never understand their
reasonings.</P>
<P>     No nakkid boobs.  No bullets.  No dead bodies.  2 on the vomit
meter.  No moon shots.  What we got here are: airplane-fu, old folk's
home-fu, attack of killer telephone call-fu, little booze-fu,
tourist-fu, goddess-fu, attack of killer train food-fu, wine-fu and of
course a plant-fu.  Drive-in academy nomination for saying stuff like
"All men are bastards" and to Kevin Klein for saying stuff like "What
can I say?  I'm an asshole."  And to Jean from Professional for saying
stuff like "I owe him more than mere money".  One and a three quarters
star.  Shaggy Bob says check it out!</P>
<P>     Alien Alert!  Did ya hear about this woman accusing a Santa Clara
Deputy for raping her in a courthouse?  Apparently this occurred during
the middle of a day in a busy courthouse.  Hmmm.  Either way, we got
some sickos out there.</P>
