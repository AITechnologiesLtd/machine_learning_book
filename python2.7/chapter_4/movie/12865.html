<P>   Father-son relationships have been the stuff of drama at
least since Oedipus killed his father Laius, and as such,
stories focusing on fathers and sons should be universal.  It
would be a shame, then, if a film like "He Got Game," honing
in on the affiliation between a young black man who needs to
forgive his dad's accidental killing of the boy mother, were
seen primarily by African-Americans.  It would likewise be
regretful if "Smoke Signals," also about a young man's need
to forgive his father--in this case for abandoning the family--is
ignored by white moviegoers simply because the principal
characters are American Indians.  "Smoke Signals" deals with
serious themes in a lighthearted, self-depracatory manner. But
its principal repute comes from its subtext: it is the first-ever
fictional movie written, directed, acted and co-produced by
American Indians.</P>
<P>   Having enjoyed a run at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival
where it garnered the prestigious Audience Award and
Filmmakers' Trophy, "Smoke Signals" is really four stories
adapted into a single, unified comedy-drama based on
Sherman Alexie's "The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in
Heaven."  Director Chris Eyre films it with a variety of angles,
filters, and techniques including the clever blending of
flashbacks into the present. It opens on the Coeur d'Alene
reservation in Idaho on a terrible fire which took place in 1976
killing the parents of little Thomas Builds-the-fire (Evan
Adams).  When Brian Capener's camera returns to the
present we see Thomas as a young man with oversized
glasses and a 3-piece suit, conveying the image of
a nerd, one whose penchant for endless storytelling could
almost be a metaphor for the entire oral tradition of the Native
American people.  Unlike Jim Carrey's character Fletcher
Reade in "Liar, Liar," Thomas tells falsehoods, but he mixes
them so cleverly into his narratives that one can scarcely tell
where the prevarications fade away and verity makes an
appearance.  </P>
<P>   Thomas's idol, Victor (Adam Beach), is his polar opposite.
Victor, a strapping, handsome, athletic young man, can hardly
avoid Thomas since his father Arnold (Gary Farmer)
saved the bespectacled boy's life by catching the infant as he
was thrown from a window.  But the dauntless Arnold is not a
hero to Victor, as he walked out on the family in a drunken
rage ten years previous.  Victor, who has never forgiven his
dad for the desertion, gets the opportunity to absolve Arnold
posthumously when he travels with Thomas to a desolate
Phoenix, Arizona location to pick up the ashes of the
newly-deceased man.</P>
<P>   Much of "Smoke Signals" is a road movie which has its
serious moments, but never fails to come across as solid, fun
entertainment, as Thomas regales his idol with fanciful tales
of Victor's dad.  Half annoyed and half relishing the
narratives, Victor tries to shape up the storyteller's image by
telling him to wipe the smile off his face, lose the suit in favor
of a power T-shirt, and most of all "get stoic."  Though their
tribe has always been fishermen, he urges his protege to act
like a buffalo hunter, the extended counsel providing the high
comic point of the movie.  Through their meeting with a
woman who has nurtured Victor's dad in Phoenix, Suzy
Song (Irene Bedard), Victor learns not to expect perfection in
a parent and finally comes to terms with his rage.</P>
<P>   Adam Beach and Evan Adams provide a comical study in
contrasts in much the way urbane New Yorker Robin Monroe
clashes with laid-back charter pilot Quinn Harris in the much
less substantial and more slickly commercial "Six Days,
Seven Nights."  Were "Smoke Signals" to go on for another
quarter hour, the novelty could well have worn off but at an
economical 89 minutes, director Eyre supplies just the right
balance of humor, intuition, and balance in a movie that
provides a gossamer story wholly from the Indian point of
view.  It's not that the Indians, like Victor, are a forgiving
people.  The opening scenes are peppered with commentary
such as the wish that all whites would go back whence they
came--London and Paris, for example--and no one considers
General Custer a hero.  "Smoke Signals" touches on subjects
as diverse as frybread, Phoenix, and forgiveness--a
distinguished Indian entry into mainstream filmography.
PG-13.  Running time: 89 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
