<P>A Nordic blonde glances repeatedly into her rear-view mirror. She sees 
her husband following closely. Suddenly, he accelerates and taps her car 
with his. He pulls back, then hits her car again, harder. When he rams 
her car a third time, she veers wildly; barely maintaining control of her 
vehicle. Is this scene depicting an attempt at murder? No. In David 
Cronenberg's "Crash," this is foreplay.</P>
<P>Based on J.G. Ballard's 1973 novel, "Crash" is about a group of people 
who are sexually aroused by car wrecks. The highly controversial NC-17 
film won a special jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival, for 
"originality, daring and audacity." Ted Turner, owner of Fine Line, the 
company distributing the film, has been quite vocal about his utter 
disgust with the movie. Nationally, General Cinema has refused to run 
"Crash" in any of their theaters.</P>
<P>All this fuss is intriguing, of course, and may tempt you to check out 
the film. Don't. To put it as succinctly as possible, "Crash" is 
pretentious crap. David Cronenberg has been cranking out similar creep 
shows for years. He specializes in nightmare visions of sex merged with 
technology, heavily spiced with close ups of wounds and surgical 
instruments. Occassionally he hits pay dirt. His remake of "The Fly" was 
a spellbinding mixture of horror and romance. But more often, as with 
"Videodrome" and "Dead Ringers," Cronenberg simply produces trumped-up, 
pseudo-intellectual versions of the kind of Grade Z gore-fests that 
littered drive-ins back in the ‘60's. </P>
<P>As for the plot, "Crash" barely has one. James Spader loses control of 
his car and hits another vehicle head-on, killing the other driver and 
leaving the driver's wife (Holly Hunter) seriously injured. While 
hospitalized, Spader meets Hunter's "friend" Vaughn (Elias Koteas,) a 
grotesquely-scarred performance artist who stages reenactments of famous 
celebrity crashes. Spader and wife Deborah Unger (the kind of ice queen 
that frequently popped up in Hitchcock films) quickly become members of 
Vaughn's car-sex cult. Then everyone in the cast  wrecks cars and screws 
each other for an hour and a half. The end.</P>
<P>There's a lot of sex in "Crash" and most of it is repellent. The most 
disgusting moment (and there are so many to choose from) comes when 
Spader hooks up with Rosanna Arquette, a horribly mutilated cult member 
bedecked with leg braces and lots of leather, and has sex with her 
scarred-over wound.</P>
<P>Vaughn is the erotic center of the group. The cultists dote on his 
mangled body and listen intently to his whispered babble. "Crashes mingle 
the sexual energy of the dead with the living," Vaughn murmurs, "creating 
an intensity that sets the latter apart from, for lack of a better 
description, safer drivers." Early on, he tells Spader he's involved in 
"the reshaping of the human body by modern technology." Later, he 
confesses that his statement was "just a test," to see if Spader was 
ready for the *really* heavy stuff. Eventually, everyone in the cast has 
sex with Vaughn. After all, who could resist a guy like that?</P>
<P>"Crash" has a slow, deliberately mechanical feel. The emotionally stunted 
characters show no despair over the death of one of their own, merely 
regretting that they didn't get to watch. They rarely make eye contact 
during sex. They rarely even act like people; it's as if they are all 
various aspects of one terribly sad personality.</P>
<P>The consensus of opinion is that "Crash" is a cautionary tale, suggesting 
that our culture has grown so jaded that we must go to sick extremes to 
reach any vague semblance of satisfaction. Supposedly, Cronenberg has 
used these offensive images to force the viewer into examining the nature 
of sexual obsession, without being distracted by anything genuinely 
erotic. I doubt it. David Cronenberg has used these images repeatedly 
throughout his career for a reason. I suspect that he gets off on this 
stuff, that these images of wounds, surgical instruments and the like 
reflect what turns him on. I suspect "Crash" has no message, that 
Cronenberg is simply pulling pictures from some dark corner of his soul 
and putting them on film because he can. But you don't have to watch him 
do it. </P>
