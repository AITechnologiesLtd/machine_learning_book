<PRE>In & Out (1997) </PRE>
<P>Seen on 26 September 1997 with Linda for $9 at the SONY Lincoln Square</P>
<P>As an acquaintance put it, "*In & Out* is good PR for the gay community in
middle America." This is a very perceptive description of this
high-concept situation comedy. Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a
high-school English teacher who about to get married. He lives in a small
town in Illinois and the story takes place on the eve of the Oscars. One
of the alumni, actor Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), has been nominated for
Best Actor. So, the whole town is watching and waiting to see if he will
win. He does, and cites Howard as one of his inspirations, and he
announces, "and he's gay."  Howard does his best to reassure his newly t
hin fiancee Emily (Joan Cusack), his parents (Debbie Reynolds and Wilford
Brimley), his principal (Bob Newhart), and his friends and students that
he is fact *not gay*.</P>
<P>But there is also the small matter of satisfying the media circus that
camps out in the town the very next day.. One infotainment reporter--Peter
Malloy (Tom Selleck)--is gay himself, and relentless hounds Howard about
the status of his sexual orientation.</P>
<P>Without giving too much away, I can safely say that the characters are
strictly l ight and fluffy. From Debbie Reynolds as the mother who claims
she needs Howard's wedding the way an addict needs heroin, to Joan Cusack
as the befuddled bride-to-be, there are a lot of harmless chuckles to be
had here. Just about *everyone* is a stereoty pe here. What ensues is an
exploration into "what makes a man a man" and it does so very humorously. 
A very memorable scene: Howard listening to a tape to "improve
masculinity."</P>
<P>It all leads to an obligatory happy ending, obligatory since it is a
comedy. It even has the feel of a *Mr. Smith Goes to Washington*; fairness
must win the day.</P>
<P>Perhaps the most important aspect of this movie is that it garnered the
number two spot for its opening weekend. This officially marks the end of
the "invisible gay man" in the minds of the mainstream moviegoer. In a
year when Ellen Degeneres comes out on national TV, *In & Out*'s number
two status means more straight people are seeing positive gay images than
ever before. I read recently that movies have to do well in the heart of
America and if they do, they will succeed everywhere. Paul Rudnick, author
of *Jeffrey* and the alter-ego of Libby Gelman-Waxner, is a funny and
talented writer, which contributes greatly to this success. It might not
be among the top ten mo vies I will ever see, but it is enjoyable, and its
success at this time is very telling. </P>
