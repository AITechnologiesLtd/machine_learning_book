                       A film review by Adam Joyce
                        Copyright 1997 Adam Joyce</PRE>
<P>For the women in this film paradise is freedom, and the road to freedom is
a long and arduous one along which many will fall.
As the sun set over Singapore on the 10th February 1942, all women and
children were ordered to evacuate before the fall of Singapore to the
Japanese. They were packed onto undersized marine vessels destined for
Australia and England, many of these were sunk by Japanese bombers as they
headed south. This was the fate of those aboard the Prince Albert in Bruce
Beresfords Paradise Road, and those who managed to swim to the shores of
Sumatra could be considered by some as less fortunate than those who did
not.
Paradise Road is based on the true story of a group of women and children
who were captured and taken to a Japanese POW camp after swimming to the
shores of Sumatra from their sinking ship. It follows the hardships they
face in a squaller of a camp in which the Japanese soldiers seem to have no
compassion, and in which the women are treated worse than animals. As a
means of defiance some of the women form a choir. It is the uniting power
of music that gives many of the women the strength to continue, and is of
such beauty that even the Japanese guards refuse to stop it.
Bruce Beresford, as the writer and director of Paradise Road has managed
to capture the despair and desolation which the women feel, and despite the
death which surrounds them, hope is ever present in those with the will. He
has also provided a contrast to the despair with humour, which is drawn
from the situation in which the women find themselves. This has been done
particularly well, and the audience finds themselves laughing one minute
and crying the next, being carried with the story, and empathising strongly
with the characters.
There are plenty of actors who will be recognised by Australian audiences
in Paradise Road. Glenn Close plays the lead character, Adrienne
Pargiter, a British wife of a tea planter, who with a musical background
becomes the conductor of the womens choir. Her leadership in this position
is representative of her role throughout the film, her courage and
determination inspiring many of the other women not to give up.
Pauline Collins plays a British missionary, Margaret Drummond, who with
Adrienne forms, to use Margarets very apt description, a vocal
orchestra. Frances McDormand, who has a remarkable ability to take on
extraordinarily different characters plays Dr Verstak, a German Jew, who in
McDormands unique style is somewhat odd, but quite charismatic. Australian
Cate Blanchett makes her big screen debut playing Susan Macarthy, an
Australian nursing sister. After this performance there can be little doubt
that we will see her again in feature films. These actors are in addition
to many other faces which will light a spark of recognition in audiences.
The cinematography, especially the shots filmed in Penang, are spectacular.
The mountains which surround the camp provide a stunningly beautiful and
tranquil backdrop, which is a startling contrast to the filthy camp and the
graphic violence of the Japanese guards, which is particularly disturbing.
The vocal orchestra brings the women together, despite their different
backgrounds. Although death surrounds them like a sheaf, this only provides
them with more reason to shine through in the face of adversity. It is
quite difficult to believe that the sound of a group of singing women could
be powerful enough to prevent typically aggressive guards from breaking up
a prohibited gathering. But the singing literally passes right through you,
sending shivers up your spine. It has to be heard to be believed. See, feel
and hear Paradise Road for yourself.</P>
