<P>As my boy Len in MEMENTO might say, memory's a tricky thing.  Take AN
AMERICAN IN PARIS, for instance.  I distinctly remember thinking, as a
young girl brimming with newly-discovered hormones, that There Could
Never Be Anything Finer, Period, than the image of Gene Kelly struttin'
on screen in a skin-tight leotard.  I distinctly remember this, because
at the sight of Monsieur Kelly doing that strut, I was sure of two
things: one, that one day I'd be Mrs. Gene Kelly, and he'd take me out
of Detroit and into his graceful arms (I'd figure out what to do with
Leslie Caron later, my passion-enflamed heart reckoned); and two, that I
had just witnessed what was undoubtedly The Greatest Musical Ever.
Period.</P>
<P>So why, some 25 or so years later, do I feel somewhat let down by the
movie I just watched?</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Ex-GI Jerry Mulligan (Gene Kelly) did what any red-blooded American boy
would do after World War II came to a close: he stayed in Paris, to
pursue a career in painting.  His "career", to the point of the opening
of the film [Kelly's first scene, hinting at the graceful athleticism of
a dancer's everyday movement, never ceases to pull me in], consisted of,
mostly, Starving.  He shared such a fate with his best bud, Adam Cook
(Oscar Levant, who I've come to adore almost as much as I love Kelly), a
gifted curmudgeon of a concert pianist who just might be the world's
oldest child prodigy.  Adam, a self-effacing chainsmoker, is also best
buds with the somewhat more successful French music hall star Henri
Baurel (Georges Guetary), an older man who took in young Lise Bouvier
(Leslie Caron) during The Resistance, and in a Woody Hall-ian move, fell
in love with Lise and asked her to marry him.</P>
<P>One problem: once carefree bachelor Jerry laid eyes on Lise, he was
hooked.  Actually, two problems: Jerry's new arts patron, the worldly -
and jealous - Milo (as in, "Venus de") Roberts, wants Jerry for herself.</P>
<P>And on tomorrow's installment of All My Bold And Beautiful Children...</P>
<P>The Upshot:
It's difficult to pin down, but whether it was the relative poor quality
of the DVD itself, or the cringeworthy moments in this movie (see "The
Numbers" below for a couple examples), I honestly have to say that my
childhood Greatest Ever assessment was a bit off.  To be sure, AN
AMERICAN IN PARIS has its moments of absolute brilliance, and I'd easily
put it up against most of the dreck passing for movies these days; but
there was an...emptiness of plot here that just failed to reach the
sustained high notes of a SINGIN' IN THE RAIN or a WEST SIDE STORY, for
instance.  Maybe it was just the idealistic memory I had of that tight
jumper Kelly wore out, but I certainly remembered "Paris" being a little
brighter, a little more dazzling, in my youth.</P>
<P>On the other hand, there's still a lil' sum'n sum'n about AN AMERICAN IN
PARIS that raises it above your standard Boy Meets Girl Let's Dance
musical plot; something a bit hard-edged that makes "Paris" more kin to
the more socially-relevant "West Side" than Kelly's fluffier "Rain".
That "something", I posit, is Oscar Levant.  Yes, "Paris" has plenty of
hokey numbers, like many of its predecessors.  Yes, "Paris" has a
musical-standard Dame In Waiting in the person of the smoky and
underused Nina Foch, and a Charming Ingenue (well, to an extent) in the
magnificent Leslie Caron.  Yes, "Paris" has great Gershwin standards,
and in Minnelli, a director who knew how to make a musical just the way
movie audiences used to want them to be made.  And oh yes, "Paris" has
Kelly showing off all his charms in that skin-tight leotard...ahem.  But
what "Paris" also has that few of the more lighthearted musicals haven't
got, was Oscar the grouch, all-too-briefly snarking his way through AN
AMERICAN IN PARIS like he owned the joint.</P>
<P>And the cool thing about my owning AN AMERICAN IN PARIS on DVD, is that
through the magic of being able to watch selected scenes, I can pretend
that Levant did indeed at least hold a lease on the joint.</P>
<PRE>The Numbers:
Ok, so the plot's got Issues; but what of the trademarks of any musical
worthy of the name?</PRE>
<P>  "Oom-pa-pa By Straus"
   Cringe moment #1; Georges Guetary started off rubbing me the
   wrong way [shouldn't it be illegal for a French guy to attempt
   German?] and never recovers.  Next!</P>
<P>  "I Got Rhythm"
   Ahhh...much better.  I've always loved this number; Gene Kelly
   seemed to work so well with those kids, as if he were a dancing
   version of ER's Dr. Ross.  It's funny, though, that he used
   American to teach French kids, English.  Hooked On Ebonics, Jerry?</P>
<P>  "Tra-La-La"
   Cringe moment #2.  I like an almost-shirtless Kelly like the next
   hot-blooded Chick; but lord, that man really couldn't sing, as he
   proved with that misbegotten high note at the end.  Minnelli
   must've directed him to pretend that someone yanked his testicles
   at that moment.</P>
<P>  "Our Love Is Here To Stay"
   The most sensuous, romantic song and dance pairing I can ever
   recall seeing on film.  Some swoon over Astaire And Rogers; but
   Kelly and Caron, in this beautiful scene, are what Does It for me.</P>
<P>  "Stairway To Paradise"
   I love this number, if only because it always makes me to do my
   impression of Henri Tha Playa President.  I'll try to remember
   to do it for Oprah, next time I see her.</P>
<P>  "3rd Movement: Concerto In F"
   Adam's manifesto, and a brief glimpse into the genius of serious
   pianist Oscar Levant.  A few years ago, I remember seeing a PBS
   documentary on Levant which went into detail about what a
   tormented soul he was.  I don't think I've ever been sadder
   about the life of a celebrity than I was after watching that
   documentary.  But even in my sadness, I came away with a deeper
   appreciation for his work in "Paris".</P>
<P>  "S'wonderful"
   Giving my boy Guetary a break for a minute, I liked this
   threesome piece with him, Kelly, and Levant.  By this point, it
   seemed as if Kelly was repeating some taps, but Levant's
   humorous expressions help make this number a winner.</P>
<P>   "An American In Paris"
   If I ever lost my memory ala "Memento's" Leonard, I'd make sure
   to have "you absolutely love the 'An American In Paris' ballet
   number" tattooed across my body.  It'd most def be worth it.
   This 17-minute ballet (which includes Kelly in the skin-tight
   leotard I keep drooling over) is what ultimately caused me to go
   ga-ga over all things Gene Kelly.  Hey, sue me for having a rich
   fantasy life.</P>
<P>Some of the background "noise" may have been a wee bit disheartening to
see, but the heart of a Gene Kelly musical - the singing and dancing -
still stand the test of time in AN AMERICAN IN PARIS.</P>
<P>DVD Thingies:
The lack of gee whiz techie stuff, only added to my slight malaise about
the film in general.  Sure, oldies captured digitally are treasured more
for their innards than for what some technical genius can add to layers
of DVD; and sure, the film still stands on its own merits.  But it's
discomforting to see a wee pretend-Gene Kelly flinching around the
screen like he was on crack, in the bottom corner of the menu.  The
background music's worse, and the butt-ugly menu titles (which were
supposed to imply a painter's pallet), were worse than that.  It was
nothing short of depressing, I swear.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
Though my memory of some details about AN AMERICAN IN PARIS may have
been romanticized a bit more than the reality of watching it as an adult
proved out, even at thirtysomething, I still fantasize about the cutie
in the skin-tight leotard.  oh, swoon. Oh yeah; Caron's not so bad,
either.  And as much as I dug Donald O'Connor in that other Greatest
Ever Kelly Musical, Oscar the grouch has him beat by a country mile.</P>
<PRE>AN AMERICAN IN PARIS: (rating: greenlight):
S'wonderful!</PRE>
