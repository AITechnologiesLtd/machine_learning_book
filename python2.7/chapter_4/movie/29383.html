<P>Synopsis: Nick (De Niro) is a world-class burglar on the verge of 
retirement. At the behest of his old pal Max (Brando), Nick agrees to one 
last job, stealing a priceless sceptre from a government facility. Nick 
reluctantly teams up with a con man named Jack (Norton), who has 
insinuated himself inside the facility. But as Nick formulates a complex 
plan to acquire the sceptre, can he continue to trust the ambitious Jack?</P>
<P>Review: "The Score" is an entertaining, well-made film, but one that -- 
given the potency of its stars -- just isn't as good as it probably should 
have been. The mechanics of an enjoyable heist thriller are competently 
executed, but the picture lacks heart. The hook of the "criminal pulling 
one last job" is too familiar, and efforts to flesh out and lionise De 
Niro's Nick generally fall flat. Indeed, scenes such as those involving 
Angela Bassett (as Nick's love interest) just bog the film down; they feel 
superficial and obvious, and the two actors share little chemistry. Brando 
is obviously having a ball hamming it up as the effeminate Max, and "The 
Score" benefits from his all-too-rare presence. But the real star of the 
show is Norton, whose turn here as talented but conniving Jack is terrific 
to watch. The screenplay itself is fine, throwing in the requisite number 
of crosses and double crosses to maintain audience interest. Oz does a 
good job of keeping things lively even when working through the seemingly 
tedious logistics of Nick's plan; the final half hour is undeniably 
rivetting. There is a sense, though, of an opportunity missed. It's rare 
to gather three generations of Hollywood star power in one movie, and to 
waste it on what is, essentially, just another by-the-numbers action film 
(even an unusually intelligent one) seems, well, criminal.</P>
