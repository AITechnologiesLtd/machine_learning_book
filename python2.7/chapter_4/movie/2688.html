<PRE>                                    FORREST GUMP
                       A film review by Sukumar Ramanathan
                        Copyright 1994 Sukumar Ramanathan</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:    Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Sally Field
Director:    Robert Zemeckis
Screenplay:  Eric Roth</PRE>
<P>     The simple-minded naif is a staple of literature.  Think of Don
Quixote tilting at windmills or of Huckleberry Finn on a raft down the
Mississippi.  They are direct and open in their dialogue with the
reader, recounting events with amazement, little aware that the rest of
the characters are laughing up their sleeves at their innocence and
naivete.  By the end of the book, however, we know that it is these very
facets of their characters that let them vanquish the cynicism and
seeming hopelessness of everyday life.</P>
<P>     Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is such a character.  He is born with an
IQ of 75, and plagued with rickety legs.  Children refuse to sit next
to him on the school bus.  They chase him on their bicycles as he tries
desperately to hobble away, and throw stones at him.  The only two
people that believe in him are his mother (Sally Field) and his friend
Jenny (Robin Wright).</P>
<P>     And yet, through every setback that life can throw at him, Forrest
persists.  He becomes an All-American running back, a war hero, a
fishing-boat magnate, a philanthropist and a cult hero.  Slow-talking
and wide-eyed, painfully enunciating each word as he talks, Forrest
overcomes contempt and barbs and violence to achieve both acclaim and
internal peace.</P>
<P>     Along the way, he is our window on twenty-five years of American
life, ranging from the early Elvis to the beginnings of AIDS.  Through
him and Jenny, we see desegregation, the Vietnam war, Watergate, disco,
and the running boom.  While dissent and protest rage all around him,
Forrest remains unsullied.  His momma has taught him to be proud of
himself, to try hard, and to be a man of honor.  This is so unusual to
the masses around him that they see him as a mystical leader.</P>
<P>     The danger with a story like this is that it is as delicate as
spun sugar.  A single misstep, a false note of dialogue, and you've
broken the fantasy that the audience has suspended itself in.</P>
<P>     Hanks comes through with flying colors.  He is at once so earnest
and sweet, like a character in a Frank Capra film, that you find
yourself rooting for him every step of the way.  Not once does he step
outside his character or offer a knowing wink.  Forrest Gump is a
character of little self-awareness and of no internal life.  In many
ways, he is like Chance the Gardener (in "Being There") or Zelig.  He
reveals himself only by his actions.  Hanks gets you to empathise even
after divesting himself of any inside spark.  It is a high-wire act
without a net, and the film succeeds because he traverses the tightrope
with nary a hitch.</P>
<P>     Robert Zemeckis, the director, specializes in stories that ask you
to indulge him with their premise.  His previous movies include BACK
TO THE FUTURE and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.  Just accept this idea of a
DeLorean that takes you back in time, he says, or that cartoon
characters can coexist with humans.  I'll envelop you in the story and
have you believing by the end.  It's ROCKY with a little help from
Industrial Light and Magic.</P>
<P>     The technical people behind the scenes have done a terrific job.
Here's JFK shaking hands with Forrest.  There's Forrest showing LBJ the
war-wound on his buttock.  And who is this?  Why, it's John Lennon as a
fellow guest on the Dick Cavett show, getting inspiration for "Imagine"
from Forrest's words!  The splicing is seamless and doesn't distract
from the story at all.  The editors even get the graininess of the old
newsreels spot on.</P>
<P>     There are certain scenes in movies that linger long in memory.
They show a director in full cry, completely in command of the
storytelling.  Think of the Mercury astronauts striding down in their
spacesuits with the surging Jerry Goldsmith score surrounding you in
THE RIGHT STUFF; or of the continuous three minute shot where
Scorsese shows you just how heady it is to be an up-and-coming
Goodfella in the hottest nightclub in New York.  There are at least two
such scenes here.</P>
<P>     The first one is where the young Forrest discovers that he can
run.  The background gets brighter, he pumps his arms furiously, and
slowly, magically the bolts on his leg-braces explode, the struts fly
off, his knees actually flex, and he is off in a cloud of dust.  It
makes you want to get up and run for joy.</P>
<P>     The second scene is when Forrest wears his Crimson Tide uniform,
tucks the ball under his arm and cuts across the football field for a
touchdown.  In that one dizzying minute-long montage, Zemeckis shows us
the excitement, the joy and the exhilaration of being a college star.</P>
<P>     The cinematography here is strong and evokes strongly a sense of
each place and time.  The fifties in the South are all white clapboard
houses and wide green fields.  A decade later, Forrest is running
through fiery napalmed jungles, the Doors jangling loudly on the
soundtrack.  When he returns and marvels at the sunset off his
shrimp-boat, the sky is a gorgeous medley of purple and orange.  And
when Forrest runs near Mirror Lake, the mountains behind reflect on the
still waters with impossible beauty.</P>
<P>     Hanks will probably be nominated again for an Oscar for his work
here.  There is a scene where he hears about his son.  Mixed with his
joy is the terrifying fear that his boy is slow too.  His eyes tear up,
his voice develops a hitch and he hesitatingly asks if his son is
stupid like he is.  It gives you a wrenching feeling inside.</P>
<P>     When he first meets his son, he walks up to him timidly, crouches
protectively over him and then sits down by his side to watch Sesame
Street on television.  The boy has his face away from us, and his head
is cocked at a slight angle.  There is a pause as Hanks arranges
himself next to his son.  Slowly, imperceptibly, he cocks his head at
exactly the same angle.</P>
<P>     There is a bittersweet love story in here too.  Robin Wright never
quite gets the essence of Jenny, though.  She is traumatized as a
child, and spends much of the movie rebelling and exploring different
lifestyles.  It is only at the end that you feel that she inhabits the
character, and by then it is almost too late.</P>
<P>     There are some very funny moments, and none are really contrived.
In the coming days, you will see the advertisements describing this as
a dramedy or as the feel-good movie of the summer.  Restrain your
natural impulse to gag, and go see it anyway.  Forrest Gump, like life,
is a box of chocolates.</P>
