<P>"Mumford", a hit and miss ensemble comedy from Lawrence Kasdan ("The
Big Chill"), is more weird than quirky, and more quirky than
funny. Which, as you can tell, isn't saying very much.  Newcomer Loren
Dean plays Dr. Mumford, a man who in four months has become the most
popular psychologist in a town called...Mumford. His unorthodox
approach gains him a new friend, lonely skateboarding billionaire Skip
Skipperton (Jason Lee). Mumford tells Skip a secret which he has
successfully hidden in his four months in town. He isn't, nor has he
ever been, a psychologist. In a scarily odd flashback sequence,
Mumford confesses about his former life as an I.R.S. investigator.  A
life filled with drugs, adultery and paranoia. But the Doc seems to be
helping people get back on their feet; most notably Sofie (Hope
Davis), a woman suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome and quickly
becoming the object of Mumford's affection. The cross-section of his
individual patients include Mary McDonnell, Zooey Deschanel, Ted
Danson, David Paymer, and a very un-"Heavy" Pruitt Taylor Vince. But a
district attorney (Martin Short) can't help digging up dirt on
Mumford, and soon he finds himself caught in quite a dilemma. As a
film, I wish "Mumford" could have stuck exclusively to the scenes with
Jason Lee. In all his films, he shows his own brand of cynicism laden
humor which never tires. Hope Davis is also good in her role, but the
romance between her and the Doc is not very believable. "Mumford"
often drags and feels much longer than its short running time, but at
times it is effective, if not at all funny. If Loren Dean, as the
lead, was a better actor with more charisma, "Mumford" could have
worked. He has a bland appearance and no real guile. If you're looking
for a light, almost enjoyable but downright weird "comedy", then
"Mumford" is for you. If not, stay far, far away.</P>
