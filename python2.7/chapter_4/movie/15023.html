<P>   Some people think that families screw you up.  Others
believe that families are the greatest thing since sliced bread. 
For most of us the answer lies between the two extremes. 
Even Todd Solondz, in his wonderfully edgy "Happiness,"
provides some respite, some redemption for the dysfunctional
unit he portrays: pederast Dr. Bill Maplewood has a lovely
relationship with his eleven-year-old boy Billy.  And while the
families in Pleasantville seem to be as functional as they can
get, we soon see the distortions which are covered up by
surface affability.  In "Down in the Delta," directed from Myron
Goble's debut screenplay by the notable author Maya
Angelou, Angelou shows how a strong, stable, happy family
unit can overcome some trenchant dysfunction, turning
alienated, weary people into cheerful, accomplished,
optimistic souls.  If the transformation is too sudden and
complete to be convincing, "Down in the Delta" nonetheless
offers some heartwarming moments with keen insight into the
problems that can befall people of any ethnic group,
particularly if they are poor.</P>
<P>   What Brian Friel did for his characters in a movie opening
one month before this, "Dancing at Lughnasa," Angelou
achieves for her film.  "Lughnasa" deals with a quintet of
unmarried, poor sisters living in Ireland during the 1930s, who
manage to remain bonded and reasonably content despite
lost opportunities.  "Delta" considers the fate of two units of a
single family, one virtually crushed by the boot of
irreclaimable misfortune, whose present-day activities are
strongly influenced by previous generations--though one of
the two segments is wholly unaware of this remarkable
leverage.  </P>
<P>   Loretta (Alfre Woodard) lives in a Chicago ghetto with her
mother Rosa Lynn (Mary Alice), her bright son Thomas
(Mpho Koaho) and her autistic daugher Tracy (Kulani
Hassen).  Addicted to alcohol and to some extent dependent
on drugs, Loretta is persuaded by her mother to take her kids
and spend the summer in Mississippi with her elderly uncle
Earl (Al Freeman), who lives with his Alzheimer's-affected
wife Annie (Esther Rolle).  Having been unable to find a job
in Chicago because of her lack of education and the general
shortage of work, Loretta is taken in tow by her prescient
uncle, who puts her to work in his cafe, preparing chicken
sausages at first but then moving on to become a waitress
and cashier.  Delighted by the affection she receives from her
rural relations, Loretta thrives in her new environment and
even her mentally-challenged little girl stops her sudden,
sharp outbursts and learns to say a couple of words.  Away
from drug dealers, indifferent employers and schools that
search kids daily for weapons, Loretta and her kids reinvent
themselves, learning the value of steady work and
responsibility as they breathe the cleaner air supplied by that
southern state.  Through a meeting with another member of
the family, Will (Wesley Snipes)--a Buppie lawyer who bills
$100 an hour but is unhappy with his snobbish wife Monica
(Anne-Marie Johnson)--Loretta makes even further strides,
and prepares to become an entrepreneur.</P>
<P>   Much is made of a solid silver candlestick holder named
Nathan, which serves as the film's central metaphor.  The
object of much affection, Nathan was "lifted" by a distant
relative from a former slaveholder just after the Civil War and
has seen been passed down through the generations until it
wound up as Rosa Lynn's property.  Sharing a trajectory with
"Beloved," a far more ambitious project, "Down in the Delta"
relies for its energy on brief flashbacks to antebellum times
as slaves were sold like cattle in the marketplace, families
broken up, and the candlestick holder used as payment to
purchase human labor.</P>
<P>   Though Loretta's recovery is too swift and complete to be
believed and while the movie is infused with homilies and
tends toward mawkishness, "Down in the Delta" goes beyond
mere sentimentality to evoke a warm portrait of a family on
the ropes which is redeemed by a change of venue.  Al
Freeman is particularly effective as the strong uncle who
steers Loretta in the right direction with Mary Alice turning in
a robust role as the sturdy grandmother who realizes her
impotence in the face of the unhealthy attractions of a large
urban center.  Toronto stands in for Chicago and a suburb
forty miles north of that pretty city becomes the rustic utopia
which is home to a kindly and even charismatic older man.</P>
