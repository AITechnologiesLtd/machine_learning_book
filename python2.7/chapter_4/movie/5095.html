                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I have to admit that, despite all the endless hours I've spent 
watching sitcom reruns on cable, I've never seen an episode of "Sgt. 
Bilko." It's probably better that I haven't, though, because I'm sure this 
movie pales in comparison. Still, I've seen every episode of "Saturday 
Night Live" and enjoy the work of the three "SNL" stars who carry the 
SGT. BILKO movie -- Steve Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman. 
It's still no guarantee that the name of those three on a movie marquee 
means an entertaining film experience. I need only cite the titles A 
SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE, DOCTOR DETROIT and HOW I GOT 
INTO COLLEGE for evidence of that.</P>
<P>        Martin plays the one-note Bilko character, a money-obsessed 
finagler who secretly runs gambling and laundering operations on the 
barracks. Aykroyd plays the one-note general character, who manages 
to overlook the rampant corruption due to Bilko's profuse ass-kissing. 
Hartman plays the one-note bastard character who is out for revenge 
against Bilko. The plot basically has Hartman trying to trip up Bilko, 
with Bilko continually outwitting him.</P>
<P>        That includes having Bilko's platoon audited by two 
accountant dorks (including fellow "SNL" alum Chris Rock), Hartman 
and Aykroyd popping in for a surprise inspection at the worst possible 
time, Hartman trying to romance Bilko's longsuffering fiance (Glenn 
Headly) and a bunch of crap involving the $70 million hovertank the 
Bilko platoon was supposed to be building. The lone voice of dissent 
amidst the Bilko platoon amid all this criminal activity is a new recruit 
who is actually serious about defending American liberty. Rest assured 
by the end of the movie he too will abandon that antiquated notion and 
begin living off government money like the rest of the platoon. Yeah, a 
real happy ending.</P>
<P>        SGT. BILKO isn't a decent comeback vehicle for Martin or 
Aykroyd, who both give mediocre, walk-through performances, but at 
least Hartman shows talent amid the ninety minutes of mindless 
entertainment, most of which is contrived and unoriginal. The movie 
does have its share of laughs, though, and is fun to watch most of the 
time. Even so, I'm about ready for the Army Comedy genre to die out. 
In this day and age, it comes off as lame and unnecessary, kind of like 
the real Army. (No flame mail on that one, please, militarists.)</P>
