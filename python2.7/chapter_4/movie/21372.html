<PRE>Fight Club (1999, R)</PRE>
<P>Directed by David Fincher (Seven, The Game)</P>
<PRE>Written by Jim Uhls</PRE>
<PRE>Based on the novel by Chuck Palanuik</PRE>
<P>Starring Edward Norton (Primal Fear), Brad Pitt (Seven Years in Tibet), and
Helena Bonham Carter (Wings of the Dove)</P>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>Formed correctly, the punch is the perfect exercise.  With the fist clenched
tight, tucked palm up into the armpit, half of the body can be worked.  As the
arm spins itself to meet the opponent with the knuckles each muscle of the arm
exerts nearly equal force.  The proper spin takes the weight of one half of
the body behind it, from the toes to the tongue (which swings in your mouth by
its own accord yet is always in concert with the movement of the rest of your
body), exerting the same amount of force on every fiber of your being.  This
same exercise, able to expend so much energy in a single action, can also
serve numerous psychological functions.  The most popular of these functions
is the release of penned up male hostility.</P>
<P>        Deprived of the "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" like
phrasing, this is the message and purpose behind Fight Club.  It is an
organization designed to free the male element of society by allowing them to
release their aggressions in a way that is designed to be relatively
harmless.</P>
<P>The two men behind Fight Club are Jack (Edward Norton), a yuppie insomniac
who has become addicted to self-help groups, and Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a
man who makes soap and spouts modern day mantras to the common man as well as
works two night jobs.  Jack has spent a year crying his eyes out at support
groups for ailments he doesn't have, a solace shattered by the arrival of
Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who goes to the support groups "because
they're cheaper than movies and they have free coffee."  Shortly after this
solace is shattered, his condominium is blown up.  Left without a place to
stay, he has a choice: stay with the woman that "were [he] to have a tumor,
its name would be Marla," or stay with Tyler, a single-serving friend (he met
Tyler on an airplane).</P>
<P>Fight Club starts innocently enough.  Tyler and Jack are out in a parking lot
and both experience the first fist fight of their lives.  They do this every
Sunday, their own Sabbath from the pressures of the designer-clothes world. 
After a few weeks, it begins to grow.  Two becomes four.  Four becomes eight. 
Eight becomes sixteen.</P>
<P>When Flight Club hits a certain point, it switches from a recreational
activity to a way of life.  It is the freedom from the repression of society,
and Tyler Durden has become the leader of a terrorist group.  The group is
dedicated, autonomous, and fanatical to its head.</P>
<P>The most amazing thing about Fight Club is that, as you watch the entire
movie unfold in front of your eyes, the rhetoric that Tyler Durden spouts
makes a bizarre sort of sense.  You don't know whether to laugh or to cry at
the pity of the world Fincher creates or whether to start a local chapter.</P>
<P>Fincher, fresh off of the ultra-paranoid The Game, paints a noirish
psychological terror in our minds while making us laugh at the same time.  You
can picture him at the Avid machine, editing away with a sardonic smile on his
face and a cigarette in between his lips.  He proves himself yet again to be
one of the finest directors of thrillers working today.</P>
<P>Brad Pitt goes back to his highly eccentric roots that he honed so well in 12
Monkeys. Edward Norton proves up to the challenge of a role like one he has
never done before… and handles it perfectly.  In him, we see a bleak new
portrait of America's urban Everyman, feeling betrayed by a society that he is
at the dregs of.  However, the true crowning achievement acting-wise of the
film is Helena Bonham Carter, who is actually British yet flawlessly takes on
an American role… body language and all.  Marla, perhaps the most-well
developed character, gets to have the most fun and it is clear that Carter
enjoys playing her.</P>
<P>Done properly, the punch is the perfect exercise.  Done as it is, Fight Club
is a nearly perfect way to spend two and a half hours.</P>
