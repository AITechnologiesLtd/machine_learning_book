<PRE>Jawbreaker
A Review By Adam Godfrey
1999 Starring Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart, Pam Grier, Judy Evans Greer
Grade: C</PRE>
<P>   Ok, ladies and gents: when you buy tickets for this movie, you know
it's going to be bad. Does anybody really have to be a rocket
scientist to figure that out?
   So why does every reviewer insist on bashing this movie? Sure, it's
bad, it's ridiculous, and it's tasteless. But has everyone forgotten
the most important thing about movies: fun?
   Jawbreaker may not reach enough status to be a cult classic, but
it's one of those movies where you can sit down and laugh at
it-whether you're laughing with the movie or at it.
   Rose McGowan is Courtney, the most snotty, uncaring, popular girl
in school with gorgeous black hair and a killer wardrobe and fashion
tips (you can NEVER eat at lunch). One the morning of their best
friend's 17th birthday, Courtney and her friends "Foxy" (Julie Benz)
and Julie (Rebecca Gayheart) decide to play a little birthday prank on
sweet Liz-in the process, she chokes to death on a jawbreaker used to
keep her from screaming.
   Cue the mayhem; while trying to make it look like a rape in her own
bedroom, complete school loser Fern Mayo (Judy Evans Greer) overhears
and sees some things she shouldn't. So in turn for her keeping quiet,
Courtney makes her popular. Julie can't take this and leaves the
group.
   And the "battle of the babes" (as described in the commercials)
erupts: Julie vs the popular 3, Fern vs Courtney & Foxy, Julie & Fern
vs Foxy & Courtney, and so on...
   Rebecca Gayheart will suffer the most from this diaster; after an
unmemorable role in Scream 2, and a horribly acted role in the
terrible Urban Legend, her career seems to be declining year by
year. She has charisma and some talent, but she has wasted it in teen
movies that take her no where. Rose McGowan, in a rare screen role (as
opposed to straight to video release) is good as her usual snappy,
vixen self, and Greer and Benz, who were probably hoping to make a
career jumpstart, fail.
   Pam Grier, although wasting her talent as well, is actually a
perfect cast as the very silly, all leather wearing tough as nails
detective.
   All in all, the movie was fun at some points, with funny tiffs and
battles between the "babes," but the one good thing you'll get from
this film is fashion tips.  Grade: C</P>
