<PRE>                                WAYNE'S WORLD
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  It never Waynes, but it bores.  Wayne
     and Garth have the potential to do some funny comedy but most
     of this film just sparks without igniting.  Rating: 0 (-4 to
     +4).</PRE>
<P>     One of the most standard architectures for a comedy team is the
straight and the wacky.  The straight person will generally seem either just
very normal or perhaps romantic.  The wacky person is, well, wacky.
Examples are Crosby and Hope, Burns and Allen, Abbott and Costello, Martin
and Lewis, Rowan and Martin, and even Bergen and McCarthy.  Generally the
wacky person gets most of the laughs and the straight person gets top
billing just for setting up the wacky person's jokes.  There is more
potential when you have two or more comics playing off each other as you did
with the Marx Brothers or what is to my mind the best of the teams, Laurel
and Hardy.  So Mike Myers and Dana Carvey--playing their SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE
alter egos Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar--start with a plus.  Both are
comics.  There is potential for some really good humor.  Unfortunately, they
rarely play off each other for laughs.  Either each does his own thing or
they just both do the same thing.  Wayne's main thing is to make a joke or
do something clever and then flash a big open-mouthed grin as if he were
standing in front of a cheering audience.  He also negates sentences by
adding a belated " ... not."  Garth's thing is to act a little befuddled and
stupid.  Not the most auspicious starting material, but with enough
personality the team could have potential.  Where they go wrong is that they
are just not all that winning, and most of their gags are familiar and not
funny.</P>
<P>     Wayne and Garth have a public access television show on cable
television.  The show is done on almost no budget from the basement of the
house where Wayne lives with his parents.  The idea is that in spite of the
low budget of the cable production, they are supposed to be the best thing
on television.  Sadly, their cable hijinx are not all that funny and leave
one wondering what the attraction is to their cable program.  (SPOILER
ALERT: They sell out to commercialism but realize that commercialism is not
what they really want.  George Romero did the same basic plot considerably
better in KNIGHTRIDERS.)</P>
<P>     Besides the two main characters, the film features Tia Carrere as
Wayne's singer girlfriend from Hong Kong.  Her singing, like Wayne's
program, is just never as good as the script calls for it to be.  Rob Lowe
is a sleazy, slimy television promoter who is more style than substance.
One of the better bit parts is Ed O'Neill as the doughnut shop owner with a
darker side.</P>
<P>     As in an AIRPLANE! film, about a quarter of the jokes but, but unlike
in an AIRPLANE! film, the jokes do not come nearly fast enough.  At times
the film drags.  That is particularly bad since the plot is predictable and
if you know what is going to happen, you wish it would get it over with.
Nearly every funny joke in the film is an allusion to or lampooning the
entertainment industry.  Most are meta-jokes that poke fun at product
placements or actors talking to the camera.  There are several film and
television allusions.  They give the film some chuckles but still too few
laughs.  WAYNE'S WORLD is often on the edge of being funny, but rarely
crosses that line.  Even at 95 minutes the film is often too slow and just
not rewarding enough.  I give the film a flat 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
