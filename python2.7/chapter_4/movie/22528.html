<P>Starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett.
Directed by Anthony Minghella. Rated R.</P>
<P>He's a talented one himself, this Anthony Minghella. Three years ago,
he scored big-time with his WWII weepie The English Patient. The film
all but swept the Oscars and was a resounding critical and box-office
success. Now Minghella comes out with another Oscar shoo-in that also
happens to be one of the year's best films. The Talented Mr. Ripley is
Minghella's proof that The English Patient was no accident.</P>
<P>A janitor at a philarmonic, Tom Ripley leads a rather boring life until
he is sent ti Italy to persuade Dickie Greenleaf, the snobby son of a
wealthy American businessman to come home. When he arrives, he finds
himself falling in love with Dickie's lifestyle. Instead of actively
pestering him to go home, Tom lives it up in Italy and Dickie's father
pays for it. Before long Tom falls in love with Dickie himself.</P>
<P>Halfway through the movie there is a confrontation wherein Tom murders
Dickie and takes on his identity. From there, he plays an elaborate
game of cat and mouse with the police and with Dickie's girlfriend
Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), trying to make the police think that he is
Dickey and make Marge think that Dickie's dumped her. The twist is that
Tom is not some great conspirator; rather he is a modern reincarnation
of Machiavelli, a man who thinks on his feet and kills when he must
kill to achieve his goal. He is a great improviser.</P>
<P>You may have heard about the enigmatic Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett
having a role in this movie. Her part is small, but it's there. She
plays an American whom Tom tries to carry on an affair with while
juggling his many other problems. Her character serves to demonstrate
Tom's ability to inadvertently get way in over his head and then get
himself out of trouble with his quick thinking ability.</P>
<P>The Talented Mr. Ripley runs almost two and a half hours and yet the
pace and tone of the movie is pitch-perfect. By making the villain the
focus of the film, Minghella (or perhaps novelist Patricia Highsmith,
whose work this movie is based on) builds suspense quietly but
undeniably. It's far from being a traditional thriller: the director
doesn't use the soundtrack as an easy way out. The suspenseful scenes
are mostly dialogue based, with only a few incidents of real violence
but the result is as tense as anything.</P>
<P>Matt Damon gives what is surely his best performance to date as the
title character. He perfectly conveys Tom Ripley's central trait: he
doesn't seem to realize that he is a psychopath. At first he kills in
his own best interest; by the end of the movie he kills because he has
become addicted to lies, but he never seems to recognize that what he
is doing is wrong. He sees that police are chasing after him but he
never feels any guilt or remorse for his actions nor does he see any
reason why he should.</P>
<P>I've liked Jude Law since I first saw him in the intelligent sci-fi
thriller Gattaca and now, after a major role in eXistenZ, he one-ups
himself. His Dickie is one of the films biggest joys (please, no pun
intended) -- a spoiled brat who is also a decent guy and a compelling
character. I liked Gwyneth Paltrow almost as much: she is one of the
hardest-working actresses in show business and it always amazes me how
she can turn in such deeply felt performances in movie after movie
after movie.</P>
<P>One doesn't realize it at first, but The Talented Mr. Ripley is an
extremely bold endeavor: a supposedly mainstream thriller that deals
with concepts like homosexuality, betrayal and pathological lying in a
deliberately paced, long production. I felt grateful that this movie
was made. I didn't want it to end.</P>
