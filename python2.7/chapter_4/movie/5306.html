<P>     This talky, terribly-plotted thriller stars Alec Baldwin as Dave
Robicheaux, an ex-New Orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder- mystery
after a light-plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat.  He
and his wife Annie (Kelly Lynch) rescue a little Salvadorian girl
(Samantha Lagpacan) from the wreckage and that's when the trouble
begins.  The other major players include a local drug lord (Eric
Roberts), his scheming wife (Teri Hatcher), a soused stripper (Mary
Stuart Masterson), and a shady DEA agent (Vondie Curtis Hall).  Everyone
knows everyone else and it makes for a collective that's curious but
never compelling.</P>
<P>     Based on the book by James Lee Burke, HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is so
badly plotted that entire *scenes* seem to be missing.  Early on, we
have no idea of why Dave and Annie keep the child to themselves.  Nor
how they eluded both the Coast Guard and the FAA.  Later, Dave is
reunited with a drug-abuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and
without any explanation.  Huh?  The whole movie is like this, perhaps
the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months
that the film sat on the shelf.  Whatever the reason, somebody should
tell director Phil Joanou (FINAL ANALYSIS) to recut this mess.  In its
present form, HEAVEN'S PRISONERS runs only two hours plus change, but it
feels like four. </P>
