<P>Man on the Moon is like one of those beautiful, old European squares 
--which are generally round and called "Place," "Platz" "Piazza," 
etc. Many are even more appealing because they come as the meeting 
point of colorful streets or avenues. In this film about the comedian 
Andy Kaufman (1949-1984) what you have is the coming together of 
talents: the main star, the director, the writers, the production 
designers, and more.</P>
<P>Jim Carrey is amazing, lives his part as Andy, becomes Andy, is Andy. 
Stories have circulated about Carrey being like a reincarnation of 
Andy during as well as off shooting. Sounds like publicity, but it's 
a fact.</P>
<P>Director Milos Forman's films are all splendid, from the features 
made in his native Czechoslovakia  in the 60s ("Black Peter," "Loves 
of a Blonde," " The Firemen's Ball") to his American debut in 1971 
with the neglected "Taking Off," then "Hair," " One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest," "Ragtime," "Amadeus," " Valmont," " The People vs. 
Larry Flynt." They are quirky, eccentric, humorous, well-observed, 
and have warmth without gloppiness. Forman loves the unusual, even 
the demented, which are musts if you make a film about Andy Kaufman. 
"Man on the Moon" takes its title from the eponymous REM song tribute 
to the late Andy.</P>
<P>The screenwriters has previously penned "Ed Wood" and Larry Flynt." 
They too also love and thrive in, the weird. Production designer Von 
Brandenstein, was Oscared for "Amadeus" and nominated for "Ragtime." 
Many other co-workers are veterans of Forman films. The ensemble 
works like clockwork, but you cannot hear them ticking. The tic-tocs 
are all concentrated on the persona of Andy.</P>
<P>"MOM" is a biopic, not factual in all details but faithful to the 
Kaufman spirit. In only two hours one gets not only a first-rate feel 
for the peculiar Andy, but coverage of a large number of his life's 
steps: Saturday Night Live is there; so is the character of Latka 
Gravas of the TV's series "Taxi." Also club appearances; his reading 
all of "The Great Gatsby" to students of Arizona State; the 
mysterious lounge performer Tony Clifton; the Mickey Mouse song; the 
Old Macdonald song; the infamous wrestling matches with women, then 
with the real champion Jerry Lawler; etc. etc. etc. as Yul Brynner 
would say.</P>
<P>Andy was the truest original in the trade and arguably the first 
performance artist. He had no comic shticks. His appearances were 
oddball happenings which puzzled all. The pranks he played on 
audiences, the practical jokes at their expense, his overt 
antagonizing of the public, his sado-masochistic attitudes, his 
private, convoluted jokes and hoaxes were surrealist, dadaist, 
Theater of the Absurd. The aim, we guess, was not to amuse but to 
confuse, to infuriate, to cajole and to insult, to be a provocateur 
whether in childish ways or in highly (but hidden) sophisticated ways.</P>
<P>There was no telling who or what was Andy-the-person and who Andy-the 
performer. One flew into the other. The audiences as well as people 
who knew him personally could not tell whether Kaufman was putting 
them on or being himself. But then "himself" remains elusive to this 
day. It would seem that everything he did -- even in private 
life--was an act .Everything was rigged. Even chance was 
orchestrated, but not so that anyone could tell. Indeed, when it was 
announced that Andy was dying of cancer, all, even his family, first 
thought that it was a stunt.</P>
<P>  In the movie, he tells his last girlfriend, Lynne Margulies "You 
don't knoe the real me." "There's not a real you" she retorts. That's 
the best possible summation of Andy.</P>
<P>"MOM" is no comedy, no entertainment, not anything we've seen before. 
Yet it is fascinating, all the more so because it does not follow the 
canons of entertainment or biopics. Biographical movies are 
notoriously inexact, homogenized (or at least pasteurized), bent on 
tying up loose ends and explaining their heroes or antiheroes. "MOM" 
does nothing of the sort. It is, for this reason, and because Andy 
himself was a huge loose end as well as a loose canon that it all 
rings true. Kaufman, that child of TV who grew up to push the 
envelope farther than anyone in showbiz, remains a mystery.</P>
<P>Carrey's superlative embodiment of Andy should not eclipse other 
roles. Though Courtney Love (as Lynne) has an unimpressive, shortish 
part (the real Lynne, shown on a TV special, is most atractive and 
lively), Danny DeVito brings a palpable warmth as Andy's manager and 
true friend. His pal-client may have been a looney--then again he may 
have been just acutely different-- but he stuck to him. And there's 
Andy's alter ego, the mysterious, obnoxious Tony Clifton, who eludes 
identification. Is he Andy in disguise? Yet well after Kaufman's 
death he reappears to pay homage.</P>
<P>Don't miss the start of the movie. The precredit introduction is 
highly original.</P>
