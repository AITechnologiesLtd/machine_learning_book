<P>Comparisons between Return to Me, the directorial debut of actress Bonnie
Hunt, and Keeping the Faith, the directorial debut of actor Edward Norton,
are bound to be drawn. This is a problem for Return to Me given that
although it is a cute and oftentimes enjoyable date film, it lacks the
intellectual breadth of Keeping the Faith. Hunt is an obviously freshman
director afraid of taking the risks necessary to transform her film from the
hardly-average date fare that it is to the bold, intellectual and far
funnier movie that Norton created.</P>
<P>Return to Me opens with a shot reminiscent of that introducing Federico
Fellini's La Dolce vita: the camera pans in from a wide view of downtown
Chicago to a close-up of Bob Rueland (a solid David Duchovny). Read: he is
free in a limitless world. Then we meet Grace Briggs (a very cute Minnie
Driver who's smile is second only to the $20 million Julia Roberts'),
pail-faced and confined to a hospital bed with a tube under her nose, via a
tight face-shot. Read: it will take an amazing grace to save this dying
young woman.</P>
<P>That grace comes in the form of Bob's wife. She dies suddenly one evening
and soon her main artery is in Grace's chest. After a year of Bob mourning
his wife who was as much married to her job as him, and Grace recovering,
the destined couple meet and commence dating without either knowing the
incredible coincidence that they share. This is a mistake of the film's as
seeing the subject dodged is annoying and oftentimes requires over-silly
techniques. The picture would be far more interesting had a scenario where
the couple knew about this early on been created. This would allow the film
to deal with some of the more philosophical issues of organ-donating and not
be forced to skirt the matter in the name of a cuteness that quite frankly
isn't that cute.</P>
<P>Grace's closest people to a family are the four elderly men, including her
grandfather, who run the family-style Irish-Italian restaurant where she
works. The motley crew has a nightly beer and poker fest very much
reminiscent of the old Saturday Night Live `Da' Bears!' sketches, only
substituting The Rat Pack for Chicago football. It is unfortunate that these
characters are the most entertaining part of the film as they do little to
further the plot or add depth to the main characters.</P>
<P>Bob's closest friend is Charlie Johnson (an excellent David Alan Grier), an
African-American veterinarian who was equally close with Bob's wife when she
was alive. A relatively sensible and conservative man by day, Charlie
transforms into a rude social animal come sun down. His character serves as
the confidant that Bob needs for everything except Bob's all-important
ventures into dating.</P>
<P>As Return to Me grows even more confused towards the end, the film takes on
some elements not dissimilar to As Good As It Gets in terms of plot. But the
quality of romance and humor never nears that of the 1997 film. Grace's
first line is `Rosebud.' The intellect never nears that legendary film
either. But for that matter, not much even nears the price of admission.</P>
