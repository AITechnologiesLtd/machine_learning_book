<P>A really good Christmas movie is hard to find. For every "Miracle On 34th 
Street" or "It's A Wonderful Life," there's hundreds of films that don't 
stand the test of time. Hopefully, "The Preacher's Wife" will become one 
of the keepers.
The story is simple. Reverend  Henry Biggs (Courtney B. Vance) has doubts 
about his effectiveness in helping his community and family. His prayer 
for help is answered with the arrival of Dudley (Denzel Washington,) an 
over-enthusiastic angel who becomes tangled with the parish, and develops 
a crush on Mrs. Biggs (Whitney Houston.)
Penny Marshall's assured direction makes "The Preacher's Wife" shine. She 
adroitly works around Whitney Houston's limited acting skills, 
highlighting Houston's vocals while using the other actors to convey the 
story.
Courtney B. Vance gives a strong performance as the Reverend Biggs. 
Trying to carry a neighborhood on his shoulders has worn Biggs down, 
leaving him a fretful, shaken man. Vance effectively imparts the 
minister's grim mood, while keeping him a sympathetic character. Denzel 
Washington is charming as the angel, in a playful, loose performance. He 
manages to be boundlessly optimistic without ever becoming cloying. The 
most memorable performance, however, comes from Justin Pierre Edmund, an 
adorable six year old who plays the Biggs' son. Edmund is a mush-mouthed 
delight in a bright, innocent performance that would win over even the 
most cynical viewer.
The real strength of "The Preacher's Wife" lies in its sense of community 
and spirituality. The inner-city neighborhood operates as an extended 
family – these people care about each other, and their love and faith is 
infectious. The many songs performed by Houston and the church choir help 
to bolster the sense of joyous communal spirituality.
The film is not without flaws. Houston's acting is almost as vacuous as 
her voice is strong. During several key dramatic scenes, she has an odd, 
pre-occupied look. And Gregory Hines' turn as the villain of the story, a 
land developer who wants to "improve" the neighborhood by tearing the 
heart out of it, lacks a sense of real menace.  
"The Preacher's Wife" triumphs over its weak spots due to the film's 
overwhelming spirit. Memorable Christmas movies work when they convey 
sentiment in a genuine fashion. "The Preacher's Wife" is destined to 
become a holiday classic.</P>
