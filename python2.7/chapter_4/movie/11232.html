<P>     KISSING A FOOL is yet another obligatory romantic comedy with dumb 
characters trying to plow their way through a morass of contrived 
situations.  From that ringing endorsement, you might assume that I 
hated the movie.  Actually, given my expectations, I didn't think it was 
too bad.  Sure, I would have appreciated a little more originality, but, 
on the whole, KISSING A FOOL delivers just about what I thought it 
would.  In the process, it annoyed me slightly less than another recent 
entry into the genre, THE WEDDING SINGER.  </P>
<P>     There are three problems that make KISSING A FOOL marginally less 
enjoyable than the average, formula-driven romantic comedy.  None have 
anything to do with the cast, but can be fixed firmly on the shoulders 
of writer/director Doug Ellin and his co-scribe, James Frey.  </P>
<P>     The first is that the dialogue is boring.  It isn't cringingly 
awful, nor should the actors have been embarrassed to say their lines, 
but there's nothing special in the words.  Apparently, Ellin and Frey 
were attempting to capture the feeling of the kind of stuff written by 
Kevin Smith or Quentin Tarantino, but they have the texture and the 
rhythm all wrong.  The result -- forgettable dialogue that reminds us 
how talented the screenwriters are who can make viewers savor the way 
characters speak.</P>
<P>     Flaw #2 is the painfully inept way KISSING A FOOL is structured.  
For some unknown reason, the entire thing is told in flashback.  Not 
only does this saddle the audience with a narrator (Bonnie Hunt), but 
there are so many cut-backs between the past and present that any 
romantic tension is completely destroyed.  What's more, it's an 
unnecessary tactic.  This film would have been significantly better had 
it been presented in a strictly linear fashion.</P>
<P>     Finally, the third problem is that the audience is always at least 
two steps ahead of the characters.  Not only are they stupid (one guy 
thinks Australia is in Europe), but they're blind as well.  The director 
apparently believes that fault extends to the audience, because he 
actually thinks there's some suspense about who the girl ends up with at 
the end.  Movies of this sort add to my appreciation of the likes of MY 
BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, where there's real doubt about how things will 
work out.</P>
<P>     What KISSING A FOOL offers is an old-fashioned romantic triangle 
done without much old-fashioned style.  Max (David Schwimmer, 
effectively playing a jerk) is an self-centered TV sports caster who 
falls head-over-heels in love with pretty Sam (Mili Avital, who was in 
STARGATE and now has a number of films on the way).  But Max's best 
friend, sensitive Jay (Jason Lee, who isn't nearly as good here as he 
was in CHASING AMY), also loves her, although a recent relationship that 
ended badly has left him tentative about romance.  Eventually, Max and 
Sam become engaged, but Max wonders about Sam's fidelity.  So he enlists 
Jay to test her by trying to seduce her.  Jay is reluctant, because he 
doesn't think it's right, but his attraction to Sam is so great that he 
can't help going out on long romantic walks with her.  Guess who ends up 
marrying whom?</P>
<P>     Needless to say, audiences get the happy ending they expect.  All 
hard feelings are forgotten, the narrator gets to dance with the best 
man, and everything turns out the way Screenwriting 101 has decreed that 
romantic comedies must end.  This leaves but one question.  Who's the 
fool:  the film maker who thinks we'll buy all of this or those of us 
who actually do?</P>
