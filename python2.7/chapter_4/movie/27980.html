<PRE>ENEMY AT THE GATES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In ENEMY AT THE GATES, by director Jean-Jacques Annaud (SEVEN YEARS IN 
TIBET), the battle for Stalingrad in the Autumn of 1942 is hell on earth 
for the Russian soldiers fighting the onslaught of the Nazi hordes.  The 
Russian officers carefully provide a rearguard for their troops -- not 
to support them but to shoot them when they retreat.  </P>
<P>In a time of rifle shortages, the Russian officers have a perfect 
solution -- skip giving a rifle to every other man.  Vassily Zaitsev 
(Jude Law, Oscar nominee for THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY), a young, 
sharpshooting shepherd boy from the Urals, is one such weaponless other 
man.  It is his job to pick up the rifle when the rifleman he is 
shadowing is killed.  Trained since he was a young lad by his 
grandfather in the ways of stealth shooting -- "I am a stone.  I do not 
move." -- Vassily becomes so famous that he single-handedly inspires the 
whole Russian army to turn from cynicism to optimism.  His actions 
become the turning point for the entire world war, or so the movie would 
have us believe.  Joseph Fiennes plays political officer Danilov, 
Vassily's friend, mentor, and personal PR machine, who convinces the 
troops of Vassily's near immortal powers.</P>
<P>Like the famous flying aces of World War I, Vassily is challenged by 
Germany's best marksman, an aristocrat named Major Koenig, played by Ed 
Harris in a pensive, reserved performance.  Major Koenig, who lives and 
breathes strategy, is sent by Berlin solely to take out the Russian 
people's hero.  An almost salivating Danilov sees it "as the essence of 
class struggle."</P>
<P>What's the missing ingredient in most war movies?  Why sex, of course.  
Rachel Weisz shows up to play Vassily's love interest, Tania.  Will they 
or won't they?  What do you think?</P>
<P>The actor having the most fun is pudgy-faced Bob Hoskins, who gets to 
chew up the scenery as Khrushchev.  Sent there by Stalin to save his 
town, Khrushchev turns out to be a bloodthirsty but effective leader.  
Khrushchev helps the Russian commander in Stalingrad "cut through the 
red tape" by supplying him with a gun to kill himself rather than having 
the report of his failure transmitted to Moscow.</P>
<P>In contrast to the battle sequences, which approach the intensity of 
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the action behind the lines is a mixture of realism 
and hokum.  The worst of these is the claim that the Russian fighters, 
rather than being exhausted at the end of a hard day of battle, came 
back to their bombed-out camps to sing, dance and party the night away, 
since they were thankful to have survived another day.  </P>
<P>After a brilliant beginning, the movie begins to bog down like the 
battle itself.  The director falls too much in love with his picture and 
includes many superfluous scenes that would have better been left on the 
cutting room floor.  A trimmed up script would start with the entire 
elimination of Tania, an unneeded diversion.  But, regardless of the 
film's flaws, it's still a fascinating piece of history and an 
intriguing picture.</P>
<P>ENEMY AT THE GATES runs too long at 2:08.  It is rated R for strong 
graphic war violence and some sexuality and would be acceptable for 
older teenagers.</P>
