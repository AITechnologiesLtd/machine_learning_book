<P>     With the title of ADRENALIN: FEAR THE RUSH, I wasn't quite sure 
what to expect from this film, but it certainly wasn't the newest entry 
onto my "worst movies of all time" list.  Even the presence of wooden 
actor Christopher Lambert (one of only a few performers in Hollywood to 
rival Steven Seagal for lack of discernible acting talent) and 
writer/director Albert Pyun (the man who gave us, among other immortal 
films, BRAINSMASHER... A LOVE STORY) didn't create expectations of a 
motion picture that sinks to such memorable depths.</P>
<P>     I have no idea how this film got its title, or why the word 
"adrenaline" is misspelled.  (Actually, the fact that the movie was made 
in Slovakia probably has something to do with the error.)  There's 
certainly nothing in here that's likely to jolt anyone, and even the 
typical, cheesy scares offered by low-budget horror flicks are ruined by 
Pyun's heavy-handed direction.  If anything, even at only seventy-five 
minutes in length, the movie is more apt to put viewers to sleep than 
keep them awake.</P>
<P>     The tired premise, which uses a recycled post-apocalyptic scenario, 
involves a bizarre psycho mutant killer on the loose in 2007 Boston.  
Following some sort of radiation leak in the former Soviet Union, a 
plague-like contamination has spread throughout Europe, eventually 
reaching the United States via immigrants.  In an attempt to contain the 
disease, the U.S. government has segregated all newcomers into 
concentration camps.  Over a few short years, as the population of these 
camps has ballooned, they have developed into small cities, complete 
with governments, police forces, and overwhelming poverty.</P>
<P>     Of course, this is all background.  The real story is about a group 
of four intrepid cops in Immigrant Boston chasing a homicidal mutant 
through sewers, air vents, and dank, disused prison corridors.  This 
chase, which generates absolutely no tension, comprises the entire 
movie.  There are no tangents, interesting variations, or anything else 
to break the monotony.  In fact, there's not even much dialogue, and 
what little there is makes the tripe from Sylvester Stallone's DAYLIGHT 
seem like Shakespeare.</P>
<P>     Attention to detail is not exactly ADRENALIN's forte, either.  All 
of the police cars in Boston look like Yugos and have the word "Policia" 
stamped on them.  Why "Policia" instead of "Police"?  Who knows.  Who 
cares.  One character apparently comes back from the dead without a word 
of explanation.  Other characters are still around, alive and kicking, 
after getting riddled with about a dozen bullets.  If I tried to list 
all the holes, inconsistencies, and other obvious problems with this 
movie, it would take me the rest of the week to write this review.</P>
<P>     A few words have to be said about this particular bizarre psycho 
mutant killer, who is perhaps the most lame bizarre psycho mutant killer 
ever to grace the big screen.  This guy looks like Quasimodo on a bad 
day.  "Awful" doesn't even begin to describe the makeup job; Disney's 
recent Hunchback looked better, and he was a cartoon.  And, on top of 
that, we're expected to believe that this creature, with only a hand 
blade, has the ability to snuff out dozens of men and women, some of 
whom are armed?  Of course, considering the intelligence (or lack 
thereof) of the characters we're exposed to, maybe that's not such a 
farfetched concept.  </P>
<P>     I realize that aficionados of this genre don't expect much from 
their films, but ADRENALIN takes ineptness to new levels.  Christopher 
Lambert fans (are there such people?) aren't likely to be happy, since 
he doesn't get much of a chance to act heroic (he grunts, groans, 
shouts, gets shot, then grunts and groans some more).  Natasha 
Henstridge fans will probably be equally disappointed, since, unlike in 
SPECIES, she keeps all her clothes on.  In fact, I'm hard-pressed to 
think of anyone who will appreciate this movie, unless it's someone who 
adores really, really bad movies.  Thus far, 1996 hasn't given us 
anything else that's in ADRENALIN's category.  Hands down, I nominate 
this as the worst movie of the year.</P>
