<PRE>I Still Know What you Did last Summer
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Jennifer Love Hewitt; Freddie Prinze Jr.; Brandy; Mekhi Phifer &
Muse Watson</P>
<P>I have to admit that I avoided going to see this film in the theater. Quite
frankly, while I am a fan of Jennifer Love Hewitt's breasts, I don't think
that they should be the entire selling feature of a movie. That is how it
seems to be in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. The more accurate
title might have been I Still Know What Jennifer Love Hewitt's Breasts Did
Last Summer, since they appear to be the stars of the show. And very
impressive stars at that... But, I digress. Of course the other obvious flaw
in the title of this little gem is the fact that the events referred to in
the title actually happened two summers before this film takes place. So I
don't think that it requires some sort of advanced university degree to
figure out that the title really should be I Still Know What You Did Two
Summers Ago. Either the producers think that the audience that is stupid
enough to pay to watch this thing will miss this small point or maybe they
aren't real adept at reading a calendar. This second option holds some
appeal for me since it is fairly obvious that they aren't real adept at
making movies either.</P>
<P>If this were some B-grade straight-to-video knock off that had at its core a
bad story, dumb villain and an abnormal obsession with Ms. Hewitt's breasts,
I'd say, "OK, I'll happily sit here and watch her breasts for a couple of
hours". The fact is that this is a sequel to one of the better horror films
of the past few years, so I expected a little more. (Story wise, not breast
wise.) If you are beginning to think that I might have some sort of
obsession with Ms. Hewitt's chest, it's really not so. Although I am an
admirer. It seems that this film is truly based around her chest. All of the
publicity shots from this film inevitably show her in some low cut number.
And she always seems to be a little damp. Every time this turkey gets a
little slow (which is all too frequent) the camera inevitably pans over and
focuses in on her chest. I kid you not. It almost makes me think that the
producers knew that what they had on their hands film wise wasn't what you'd
call a masterpiece. So they figured that the only way that they were going
to get anyone in theaters was to pander to the lowest denominator --
over-sexed teenage boys. My guess is that this group predominated the
tickets sold for I Still Know's theatrical run.</P>
<P>Gone is the clever Kevin Williamson script from the first film. In its wake
is every tired and overused horror film cliché from the past twenty years. I
guessed who the killer was the first time that that person was on camera,
and I'm not exactly a rocket scientist. I'm not even going to get into the
ending of the first film that, without giving it away, didn't exactly seem
to lend itself to a sequel.</P>
<P>No matter, here we are again and Jennifer Love Hewitt is back at university
a year after most of her friends were killed by a hook-wielding fisherman.
She has finally getting a little good luck in her life. Her roommate
(Brandy) wins a radio contest and the two roomies, with two guys in tow,
head off on a free weekend in the Bahamas. Of course, the hotel is on a
small and mostly deserted island (how convenient) and a hurricane is just
blowing in as they arrive (you can't make a formula horror film without high
winds and rain). Sorry if I spoil any surprise kids, but guess what? Our old
buddy the hook-wielding fisherman turns up on the island with them and
starts slicing and dicing people one by one.</P>
<P>The only positive thing that I can say about this movie is that at least
this time the killer fisherman, who I have long considered to be one of the
dumbest slasher film killers ever (he would be the dumbest if it weren't for
Leatherface) is at least dressed somewhat properly here. Since they are in
the middle of a hurricane, his black rain hat and slicker don't look too out
of place. Unlike in the first movie when he seemingly wandered around
unnoticed in the middle of a hot sunny day wearing the same ridiculous
getup.</P>
<P>Acting wise -- lets just say everyone avoids embarrassing themselves. Not
much else can be said for the cast. Holdovers from the first film Jennifer
Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr., proved in the original that they are
talented actors. Unfortunately, the script of this latest film doesn't give
them any material to enforce that.</P>
<P>In the end, this is a B-grade slasher flick from the word go. If it wasn't
for the fact that it is the sequel to the very clever I Know What You Did
Last Summer and for the fact that it boasts Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie
Prinze Jr. in the cast, this film would wind up collecting dust on the shelf
of your local video store. Sadly, it is very obvious that Hollywood hot shot
Kevin Williamson was not involved in this project to give it the same depth
that he injected in to the first one.</P>
<P>6/10 -- 4 for the movie and 2 for Jennifer Love Hewitt's breasts</P>
