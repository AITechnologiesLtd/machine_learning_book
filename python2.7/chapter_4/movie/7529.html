                       A film review by Michael R. Thompson
                        Copyright 1997 Michael R. Thompson</PRE>
<PRE>RATED: R
PRODUCTION/PROMO INFO: www.viewaskew.com 
PERSONAL RATING: 8.5 of 10</PRE>
<P>(SHORT) 
A movie about falling in love.  Specifically, dealing with the brave
and daring things people are willing to do to fall into love, and the
cowardly and stupid things the same people can do to bollix it up.
It treats these subjects with a GREAT deal of HUMOR and poignancy. 
The characters include gays, and the humor is VERY RAUNCHY, so if 
these things offend you stay away.  The only part of the movie I 
disliked was the ending, where I felt the characters lost their 
way.</P>
<P>(ONLY A LITTLE LONGER)
Two single men, Buds, if you will and business partners are moving
somewhat aimlessly through life living in New Jersey.  They both 
like girls, although they can't seem to get enough, and they're (comic
book) geeks, but successful geeks.  Then, one of them goes and falls 
in love.  Never mind that this girl doesn't like guys, we know that 
love will prevail, ... or will it. Further, what's going to  happen to
the friendship between the two guys?</P>
<P>This movie asked a ton of questions in a very funny way, and I really
enjoyed this aspect of the film.
Several of the questions addressed include, in no particular order:
is love bigger than sexuality (can a lesbian go straight, if she 
has found her soulmate), are all great friendships truly plutonic or is
there always some hint of sexuality (or is three just a crowd), is oral
sex a dangerous habit, can we really love someone who is different or do
we need a metaphorical mirror of ourselves.
Getting all of these issues out on the table took up the first three
quarters of the film, and it was very funny and intelligent.  Of course,
being an artiste and needing to have an ending, Kevin Smith had to try
to answer these questions for us, and that is where I started to dislike
the film.  In fact, I just didn't believe what the primary characters
did to deal with any of these issues, especially based upon their
introduction and development.Still based on the fact I was laughing my
head off for the first hour, I heartily recommend the film.</P>
