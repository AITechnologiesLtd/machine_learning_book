<P>End of Days goes up in flames- literally. With both the hereditary flaws 
of an apocalyptic film, poor acting and a lack of that magical quality 
that oftentimes makes unrealistic action movies seem plausible; it is 
most fitting that the title card in the opening credits is on fire.</P>
<P>There are certain liberties which movies like this can take. Over the 
summer Universal, the parent of this work, released Bowfinger, a comedic 
satire which explained that if the action is good, the plot doesn't have 
to make sense. James Cameron knows about this. His Terminator films 
hardly hold their own weight in a world of Jane Austen (incidentally, 
there actually is a Jane Austen film opening opposite this movie) but 
the effects are grade-A and Arnold Shwarzenegger (from here on out known 
as "Arnie") is at his best. Unfortunately, director Peter Hyams doesn't 
have those Cameronian effects and the key performance is Arnie-lite.</P>
<P>After a brief opening stint in 1979's Vatican City and New York City, we 
are taken to the big apple of December 28, 1999. In three days, 1000 
years will be over and Satan has a plan to end all humanity. The end of 
days will require the rape and pregnancy of the chosen one (named 
Christine York and played by Robin Tunney) between the hours of 11:00pm 
and midnight, Eastern Standard Time. The offspring will then come alive 
Rosemary's Baby style and all of existence will be negated. The details 
on how exactly this takeover will occur are omitted (if they ever 
existed in the first place).</P>
<P>Arnie plays a security guard for hire. He takes a bullet for his client 
(actually, the movie uses an old bulletproof vest joke to create the 
false illusion that he is dead, something that clearly can't happen to 
the star only 15 minutes into the movie) and pursues the shooter. The 
man with the gun turns out to be a priest who chose a life of poverty 
over the church. Arnie catches up with him and he mutters an apocalyptic 
phrase before Arnie shoots him. Seem strange yet? It gets more bizarre. 
The guy doesn't have a tongue.</P>
<P>The movie continues in this worn-out chase, kill, chase, kill, etc85 =
format until you are absolutely fed up with apocalyptic mythology. The 
only interesting or original revelation the movie makes is that Simon 
and Garfunkel were right, "the words of the prophets are written on the 
subway walls."  </P>
<P>Somewhere in this tangled plot lies a corrupt police officer, some 
bodies that are taken from the dead, a few explosions, a flying 
helicopter sequence, Latin codes, stigmata and a whole lot of burning 
candles.</P>
<P>There is a basic flaw in films that threaten to end all existence: they 
very rarely do. Most directors are far too frightened to produce a movie 
that ends by telling everyone in the audience that they are dead. On 
occasion, exceptions are made. Recently (SPOILER OF ANOTHER MOVIE 
AHEAD), The Astronaut's Wife used this tactic which raised a few brows 
but hardly cleaned up at the box office.</P>
<P>Not long ago, the Catholic Church got in an uproar over the release of 
Dogma, another film that used the bible and some astray theories to 
threaten a negation of existence. End of Days takes it all even further 
with gun toting priests, ritual birth ceremonies with snake's blood and 
a massive shootout in a church. It remains a mystery as to why the 
church didn't get upset over this production.</P>
<P>The movie does have some other problems. Satan is a far too agreeable 
character. At one point many viewers may actually root for him. As in 
many action works, there are numerous continuity issues such as the 
convenient vanishing of walls and violations of physics. The writers 
must have seen how Kevin Pollak was merely reprising his excellent 
performance from The Usual Suspects in this film and slipped in a 
blatantly ripped off line, "Satan's greatest trick was convincing man he 
didn't exist." Perhaps the movie's tagline, "The end is near," is meant 
to reassure audiences of the closing credits.</P>
