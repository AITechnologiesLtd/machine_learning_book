<P>I never thought an insect movie could be this thought provoking until I
watched "Microcosmos". Let me explain.</P>
<P>An ant milks some aphids on a branch. Enter a ladybug who feeds on the
aphids. The ant responds by knocking the ladybug of the branch. It tries
to climb back on, but on it's travels bumps into another ladybug. They
start copulating. My, my, the wonders of nature.</P>
<P>Here's another scenario. Remember snails, those slugs who wear a shell,
and are frequently trampled on if not eaten at a French restaurant.
Well, I've just learnt how they copulate. The sex was elegantly set to
the moving music of Opera. I'm not sure how to explain this, but it's
like velcro. I'm beginning to understand why it must have taken
directors Nuridsany and Pernnou so long to film this movie. Although,
they could have helped the process along by let's say sticking the
snails together, but you'd have fingers in the way, and that can really
spoil the mood. At least fifteen years of research hasn't gone down the
drain, we have this glorious footage of snails forever petrified in our
minds and on film. Ya gotta see it ta believe it.</P>
<P>It's not all about sex, even though much of nature is interconnected
with reproduction. We have a narrator Kristin Scott Thomas who speaks a
few words at the beginning and at the end of the movie. She does much
better here than in "The English Patient". There are lots of other
insects who scurry and flutter about the screen like busy human beings.
The most memorable performances are from a dung beetle with a
problematic dung ball; hardworking ants busy at work gathering food for
the winter months; a pheasant who makes a Godzilla entrance before
terrorising the ants; a thunderstorm in the middle of the day
reminiscent of an air raid; and an ending which deserves more that a
swat and "damned mosquito".</P>
<P>This movie was so profound and meditational that I could have slept
through it, but I didn't. Educational to say the least, but I longed for
violence let's say between the wasps and the bees, or the preying mantis
and the black widow spider, or the ants vs. the termites. Oh by the way,
if you've ever stuck a hose into an ant hole, then turned it on - don't
do it again, cause all their food supplies are down there. :-)</P>
