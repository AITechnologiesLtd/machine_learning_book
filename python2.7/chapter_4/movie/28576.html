<PRE>CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL
A film review by Annette Cardwell
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Just going on the sassy and jangly rock-filled MTV ad campaign for
crazy/beautiful, you'd think that this teen flick was just another She's
All That-style adolescent love story about the popular kid and the
misfit, but this is not just another happy-go-lucky clone.  While the
writing may be a little too self-indulgent with its message-laden
speeches, crazy/beautiful is pretty brave in the subjects it takes on,
and does its best to avoid many teen movie conventions.</P>
<P>Nicole (Kirsten Dunst) is the privileged daughter of a congressman
(Bruce Davison) who remarried to start a new family after Nicole's
mother's suicide.  Traumatized and emotionally alone, Nicole is always
in trouble, and makes a defiant play for wrong-side-of-the-tracks Carlos
(Jay Hernandez from MTV's Undressed soap), a hard-working straight-A
Latino who commutes two hours from East Los Angeles to the Nicole's
ritzy Pacific Palisades high school.</P>
<P>Of course, the film's filled with pat questions, like "Can their
inter-racial, inter-class romance survive?"  "Can Carlos teach Nicole to
love?" and "Will Nicole's dad ever reach out to his troubled daughter?" 
But the writers show smart glimpses into the many sides of some of these
cliché issues.  For example, instead of just going the Pretty in Pink
route where the poor kid feels alienated from the rich kid's exclusive
clique, this time the tables are turned.  Nicole finds herself at a loss
at Carlos' eastside Latino family party.  She realizes she's competing
with other Latina women for Carlos' affection, and that his family and
community could mean more to him than her or her family's money and
prestige.</P>
<P>But those trite themes get played out in a bad way as well, mostly
through poorly written, long, groan-inducing soliloquies.  Case in
point: Carlos delivers a classic "you make me not afraid to be myself"
monologue that could just make you gag.  Fortunately, most of the
non-speech dialogue is decent stuff.  Unlike Kevin Williamson's
tiresome, adult-sounding teen banter, conversations between Nicole and
Carlos are actually very real and often touching.</P>
<P>Much of that realism may be more a result of the truly impressive
performances from Hernandez and most especially Dunst, who plays Nicole
as the fragile party girl who acts out with wild and crazy antics to
dull a heart-wrenching pain.  Even Davison does the best anyone could do
with the often hollow father role, adding depth where the writing for
the character doesn't provide any.</P>
<P>Just keep in mind that -- despite the marketing -- this movie is no
screwball romance, so don't go in expecting to get one.  Instead of
crazy/beautiful, it should be Prozac-addled/beautiful.  In other words,
it's not a good kind of crazy; it's that dark, disturbing kind of
crazy.  In that way, it's hard to say who this movie's intended for,
but, judging from all the puffy red eyes in the screening audience, teen
girls will at least get a tearjerking (and a lame-ass soundtrack by the
likes of Seven Mary Three and Fastball) out of it.</P>
