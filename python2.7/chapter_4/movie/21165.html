<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Some might find this appealing film about Parisian twenty-somethings,
who refuse to grow up, to be quite amusing.These troubled
student-intellectual types love to talk and are charmingly neurotic, in
a film that unjustifiably goes on for three hours but does so in a
surprisingly breezy fashion. I would have more carefully edited this
film, as there were too many scenes that were nice but not impactful
enough to keep. What the film does just right, that caught my interest
from a psychological point of view: is penetrate the students'
loneliness, the mind-games they play, their ideas about sex and love,
their foolish need to lie, and the tribal nature of their relationships.</P>
<P>The antihero of the film is the slightly built, Paul Dedalus (Mathieu
Almaric), who plays a natural charmer and vulnerable lover to the three
girls (Esther, Sylvia and Valérie). They charmingly fall in love with
him and are the cause of all his mental angst. At times, he seems to be
merely exhibiting a case of childish pouting, unprepared to find out
what he wants to do in life. These sort of devilish characters could be
very attractive to the opposite sex, especially if they are handsome
like he is and equipped with a facade of sensitivity and innate
intelligence.</P>
<P>Paul is a 29-year-old assistant professor, unhappy in his underpaid
college position as a  philosophy teacher, yet unable to finish his
doctorate, failing to take his exams which prevents him from becoming
part of the permanent staff. He continues to be indecisive about what to
do about his career and personal life. For the last 10- years he has
been with his good-natured girlfriend Esther (Devos), whom he wants to
dump even though he loves her and she is perfect for him, but he
strangely thinks that she is holding him back. So he picks a fight with
her. You see, he thinks he loves another girl even more, Sylvia
(Denicourt), whose performance steals the film because of her unwitting
sexual charm being displayed in such a capricious manner. Our hero has
broken up with her after a brief fling two-years ago, but she happens to
be going out now with his best and only friend, Nathan (Salinger).
Nathan does not know that he knew Sylvia before, which should tell you
something about their close friendship. This really fine ensemble cast
takes this meandering, real-life type of a story and makes it into an
absorbing drama, carefully scrutinizing their intricate and confusing
lives.</P>
<P>Paul finally dumps Esther, after he meets a girl named Valérie (Jeanne
Balibar) at a party given by an acquaintance, Jean-Jacques (Denis).
Valérie is very demanding, and suffers from being a bit metally
unbalanced. Jeanne Balibar gives an eye-catching performance, one that
adds just the right degree of spice to the meal being cooked. He also
wants to be with the evasive Patricia (Chiara Mastroianni), the naive
girlfriend of the last two months of his cousin and roommate, Bob
(Thibault de Montalembert). Bob, like Paul, has a confused concept about
relationships, lightheartedly boasting about all his conquests.</P>
<P>The friends always seem to be together, which brings about some sexual
tension. They  pseudo intellectualize about their relationships and
prowl around the university hang-outs of the in-crowd, and have a
facility to behave in an irresponsible manner, not unlike many students
the world over do. Paul adds his own perspective to what is happening,
as he offers some colorful voiceovers explaining the confused situation
he is in and reads the minds of the others he is involved with, offering
his unique take on their problems.</P>
<P>There are a few diverting subplots that are deftly handled by the
director, as Paul is snubbed by his pretentious ex-friend Rabier
(Vuillermoz), who becomes to his chagrin, head of the epistemology
department at the university. These embarrassing snubs emphasize to Paul
how he is really unsatisfied with how his life is going and this forces
him to make another foolish decision, he decides to leave the university
because his pride had been hurt. Paul goes to his university mentor for
guidance, Professor Chernov (Roland), who turns out to be absent-minded
and unable to offer sound advice to the reluctant scholar.</P>
<P>What the film fails to do, after one may grow weary of all the charm it
exudes, is provide any rationalizations or explanations for the
split-ups and ongoing relationships. By the time the film ends, we are
just as much in the dark as we were in the beginning of the film about
his love life, except we now know who is doing what to the other. There
are no shared intimacies, or greater emotional or intellectual depths
explored. But the film is still a rather compelling and superbly
acted-out black comedy, that has its glorious moments, but cannot go
past its own facile limits it set-for- itself. But any film that can
intelligently engage the philosophers Kundera and Kierkegaard into its
story, and have an arrogant professor lose his pet monkey in the
radiator of his dorm apartment, has my vote of approval.</P>
