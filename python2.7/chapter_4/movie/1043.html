<P>     With DANCES WITH WOLVES making the great Hollywood western
respectable again, it stands to reason that an attempt to rejuvenate the
great Hollywood western parody wouldn't be too far behind.</P>
<P>     The first of this breed is CITY SLICKERS, an amiable but
surprisingly unfunny fish-out-of-water comedy starring Billy Crystal.
In one of the flattest cowboy spoofs to mosey on down the trail in a
long time, CITY SLICKERS simply leaves the viewer tired and saddle-sore.</P>
<P>     One of the problems with the film is its laughs, or lack thereof.
At almost two hours, there aren't enough of them to sustain a film of
this length.  Screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (SPLASH)
have taken what is, after all, a pretty easy target and come up with a
seemingly endless stream of banal and largely uninspired one-liners, the
cow pat kind of humor that only appeals to little kids.</P>
<P>     Comedic everyman Crystal plays Mitch, who sells radio air time for
a living.  Mitch has gotten to the point in his life where he's the best
he's going to be, look or feel ... and it's not that great.  He's on
the verge of his 39th birthday and a mid-life crisis both at the same
time.</P>
<P>     Mitch's best friends are Ed (Bruno Kirby, who co-starred with
Crystal in WHEN HARRY MET SALLY)  and Phil (played by a bespectacled
Daniel Stern).  Ed, a sporting goods salesman with an eye for adventure,
co-habits with a 24 year old underwear model who adores him, yet he's
afraid to make any kind of long-term commitment.  Phil is a hen-pecked
grocery store manager whose tyrannical wife has made his life a living
hell.  These three amigos could sure use some serious counseling.</P>
<P>     They settle instead for a couple of weeks of soul-searching out
west, driving two hundred head of cattle from New Mexico to Colorado.
It's a perfect opportunity to come to terms with their identities whilst
fulfilling some of their adolescent fantasies - machismo, male bonding
and merriment under the stars.</P>
<P>     Mitch, Ed and Phil are joined on this trek by a motley crew of
stereotypically offbeat characters, including the mandatory
blonde-haired, tight-jeaned temptress who comes along for the ride,
keeping our saddle- pals' hormones percolating along with the coffee.</P>
<P>     Western veteran Jack Palance has a colorful role as the prickly
trail boss who laughs at the ineptness of it all.  "Two weeks out here
is supposed to change your life?" he scoffs, astutely.  Yet by the time
these "city folk" finish horsing around, we are supposed to buy just
that.</P>
<P>     Dwarfing everything in the picture -- especially the laughs -- are
the sprawling deserts of New Mexico, with their magnificent buttes and
mesas.   Too bad we don't get to see more of them, and less of Crystal,
Stern and Kirby.  These are two-dimensional characters in a
three-dimensional landscape -- and a very spectacular one at that.</P>
<P>     Another of the film's drawbacks is that it spends too much time
dabbling in the seriousness of the male menopause.  When the three
aspiring cowpokes ruminate over sex, baseball and the other-worldly
pleasures of their lost youth, this introspection comes across as
sounding trite and awkward.  If there is a balance between humor and
sincerity, then the film never quite finds it.</P>
<P>     The film momentarily comes to life in a scene in which Mitch,
having first delivered a calf with his own hands (a sweetly sentimental
if sticky moment), later risks his life to save it.  It's a rare
dramatic sequence in a film crying out for some genuine emotion.</P>
<P>     Early in the film, Mitch's wife realizes that her husband needs a
break from the rigors of everyday life.  "Find your smile," she
earnestly implores him.  But by the movie's end, this viewer was still
trying to find his.</P>
