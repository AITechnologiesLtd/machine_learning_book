<P>"Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic
loser. And they're right. I have lost something. I
didn't always feel this sedated."</P>
<P>With that piece of dialogue, we are fully
introduced to Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a 42
year old man trapped within his own life. Lester
works for an advertising agency. His growing
dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the
mid-life crisis he is suffering. Estranged from
both his wife and his daughter, Lester starts to
crack under the stress. His life becomes nothing
more than a series of mastubatory fantasies, and
sullen apathy.</P>
<P>Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening), is the
prototypical  career woman/ homemaker. She
carefully tends her rose garden, decorates her
home with the best  furnishings. But inside she is
desperate. Unsuccessful at her profession as a
real estate agent, she drives herself into states
of denial and self loathing that only feed her
growing resentment towards her family. The third
member of this anti-family is Jane Burnham (Thora
Birch), Lester and Carolyn's daughter. A young
girl going through the typical stages of
adolescence, but having to also come to terms with
her families growing dysfunction.</P>
<P>This funny (and frightening) slice of life is
refreshingly simple. Not one character is given
less than is needed to identify him or her. Some
of the most telling characters are those that
serve to highlight other characters. Most notably
is Barbara Fitts (Allison Janney), the almost
catatonic wife of  Retired Marine Colonel Fitts.
She has almost no dialogue, and seems to be either
recovering from a stroke or suffering from one.
Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper) is an angry and
frightened man. His rage directed almost
singularly at his son, Ricky (Wes Bentley) who has
just moved with his family to the same
neighborhood as the Burnham's. In fact they are
the next door neighbors.</P>
<P>Anymore detail into the personalities of these
marvelously diverse characters would deprive one
of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in
"American Beauty". Alan Ball, who was the
co-executive producer of the hit TV series "Cybil"
and creator of the new sitcom "Oh Grow Up", has
fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly
tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the
past ten years. Not one character in this film
rings falsely. And the depth of personality in
each, is achingly honest and insightful. The plot
detailing the last year in the life of a man as he
tries to find his own self worth is so
resoundingly cliched and at the same time original
as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as
"The Graduate" or "Lolita".</P>
<P>Kevin Spacey turns in one of this years most
pragmatic performances. His Lester Burnham is an
everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is
spiraling into old age. Finally unable to deal
with the lost soul that he has become, Lester
tries to return to his youth. He quits his job
(actually blackmailing his employer for one year's
salary), starts smoking pot, fantasizes about his
daughter's girlfriend Angela (Mena Suvari, in a
marvelous performance here), starts working out,
and finally takes a job at the local fast food
outlet. Mr. Spacey's performance is so remarkably
subtle and ingenuous, that we can be certain that
come Oscar® time, we can be assured to see him
name among the five nominees.</P>
<P>Annette Bening also turns in what may be the best
performance of her career. Carolyn Burnham is a
woman who has become so insecure as to be caught
up in maintaining the facade of normalcy. Unable
to cope with her growing disillusionment, she
forces herself to maintain her demeanor, driving
her further and further into desperation, adultery
and possibly murder. Ms. Bening makes the
character of Carolyn so compelling as to be
identifiable to almost anyone. The slow and
methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel
house Martha Stewart is too frightening to express
in words.</P>
<P>Thora Birch holds her own against the talents cast
with her. Jane Burnham is both an innocent girl
caught up in what is a dysfunctional family, and a
rebellious child ready to abandon them at any
moment. Her growing distrust and isolation from
her family is something that many parents should
view as a warning. She is the prototypical trophy
child. When Carolyn praises her daughter after a
performance by her cheerleading team ("I'm so
proud of you, Honey. You didn't screw up once!"),
the bitterness and resentment are palpable. Thora
Birch is a young actress to watch.</P>
<P>Praise must also go to Chris Cooper who brings yet
another angry father role to life with depth and
resonance. Colonel Finn is a man in complete
denial. His military upbringing masking a desire
he is too repulsed to even comprehend. </P>
<P>Wes Bentley as Ricky Finn is fine as the enigma.
The boy next door who may be more foe than friend.
A deceitful and calculating young man, whose
voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more
profound understanding of life than any of the
adults around him. Mr. Bentley's performance is
the one troublesome note in the film. That is
simply because the character is such a grand and
complete liar, that one almost faults the
performance for it.</P>
<P>Director Sam Mendes handles all of the particulars
of the cast and the settings with a sure and
composed style that is neither intrusive nor
subtle. Scenes of Carolyn walking through the
rain, carry an ominous fission that calls
attention to the emotions of the character. The
subtle cinematography by Conrad Hall is wonderful,
capturing the season in all of it's harsh beauty
(Fall has never looked so inviting, yet
depressing). Every nuance of "American Beauty"
begs it's audience to think and examine. It is a
film that will be discussed and debated for years
to come. And well it should, as it is simply one
of this years best.</P>
