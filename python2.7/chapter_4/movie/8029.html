<PRE>Hercules (G) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>After making steps toward maturity with 1995's serious-minded
Pocahontas and last year's vastly underrated dark masterpiece The Hunchback
of Notre Dame, Disney's 35th full-length animated feature, John Musker and
Ron Clements's comic adventure Hercules, finds the studio in retrograde.
While this shift in gears is a bit disappointing after the admirable
ambitions of the previous two films, there is no denying that Hercules is a
rousing crowdpleaser--the type of light, fun family entertainment the Disney
name has become synonymous with over the years.</P>
<P>The first few minutes of Hercules could not be more of a contrast
from the dark opening of Hunchback, in which the evil Judge Frollo kills
baby Quasimodo's mother attempts to drown him in a well--we see the
absolutely adorable baby Hercules (whose big head makes up two-thirds of his
entire body), superstrong son of gods Zeus (voiced by Rip Torn) and Hera
(Samantha Eggar), cuddling with his pet, baby Pegasus.  The bliss on Mount
Olympus is short-lived, however; baby Herc is soon snatched away by god of
the underworld Hades (a well-cast James Woods, more smarmy used car salesman
than devilish overlord) who feeds the child a potion that makes him mortal
and thus unable to rejoin his parents in the land of the gods.  Under the
training of wisecracking satyr Philoctetes (Danny DeVito, in top
wisecracking form), the strong and brave Herc (voiced as a teen by Joshua
Keaton and Roger Bart; voiced as an adult by Tate Donovan) becomes, if you
will, the Michael Jordan of ancient Greece, admired by millions and earning
millions through endorsement deals.  But to regain his divine aura, he must
prove to be a "true hero," and standing in his way is Hades, who plots to
take over Olympus for his own dastardly purposes; and possibly Megara (Susan
Egan, the original Belle in Broadway's Beauty and the Beast), a
sharp-tongued damsel whose true motives are not clear.</P>
<P>As with all Disney animated features, the music is one of the main
attractions--or, at least, it should be.  For Hercules, regular Disney
tunesmith Alan Menken, this time collaborating with Tony-winning lyricist
David Zippel, provides his most uneven work for a Disney film.  The majority
of the singing is done by a quintet of Muses (Lilias White, Cheryl Freeman,
LaChanze, Roz Ryan, and Vaneese Thomas), a Greek chorus of narrators that is
part gospel choir, part Motown girl group.  Their soulful numbers, which are
more than slightly reminiscent of Menken's catchy '50s-flavored work in
Little Shop of Horrors, provide a toe-tapping (if not particularly memorable
lyrically) musical framework for the film.  But Menken's more traditional,
formulaic numbers fall flat.  Phil's dreadful comic number "One Last Hope"
picks up right after Hunchback's weakest song, the uninspired gargoyle
showcase "A Guy Like You"; and "Go the Distance," Herc's big "I Want" song
(his _only_ number in the film), is a forgettable, sappy ballad that
shallowly expresses his desires without shedding much inner light into the
character.  Menken would have been better off spreading the R&B motif
through the entire picture--a point reinforced by the film's best song, "I
Won't Say (I'm in Love)," sung in the style of a '50s girl group by Meg and
the Muses.  Why the producers chose a version of "Go the Distance" (sung by,
of all people, Michael Bolton) to serve as the film's pop single instead of
a rendition of this memorable song is beyond me.</P>
<P>Hercules also leaves a little something to be desired on the visual
level.  While the artwork and animation is perfectly serviceable, the rather
simplistic art style is a bit of a comedown after the impressive visual
splendors of Hunchback.  There is only one truly visually spectacular
sequence (Hercules's wild battle with a computer-generated Hydra) and only
one character with a striking look--Hades, whose head-topping flame changes
color depending upon his mood.  Meg's appearance is particularly
disappointing; a femme fatale is something new and exciting for the genre,
but her animators aren't up to the task.  Both curvy and sharply angular,
jarringly so, she is the first unattractive female lead in recent Disney
animated features.  But where the artists fall short, Egan makes up,
delivering Meg's lines with the right balance of sass and teasing allure.</P>
<P>And what about Hercules?  He's big, strong, well-meaning... and
dull.  Sure, he has all the muscles; he can lift heavy objects over his
head; but no distinctly interesting personality shines through.  At least
Aladdin had his life of crime and Prince Ali charade, John Smith his
"consent vs. descent" issue with Pocahontas, Simba his guilt over his
father's death, the Beast and Quasimodo their angst over their appearances.
Nothing is really made of Herc's main conflict (godly strength trapped in a
mortal body), save for one scene in which the teenage Herc is called
"Jerkules" after inadvertently destroying some architecture.  He displays
some cockiness when he first meets Meg, but it's quickly thrown out the
window; perhaps a longer-lasting dash of that would have added something to him.</P>
<P>Even with a vapid void in the center, Hercules is still top-flight
entertainment for the family, even if it does not quite qualify as an
instant classic.  It should have no problem reversing Disney animation's
slowly eroding box office grosses, which makes this Disney fan worry.  With
the light, bouncy Hercules's box-office success just about assured, will the
Mouse completely abandon, unjustly so, more experimental and mature animated
works like Hunchback?        <HR></P>
