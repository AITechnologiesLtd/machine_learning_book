<PRE>                            THE BROWNING VERSION
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     THE BROWNING VERSION is a wonderful character study of an older
teacher of classical languages at an English bordering school in
Dorset.  The teacher, marvelously performed by Albert Finney, is
retiring under some sort of mysterious circumstances although it is
nominally because of his health.</P>
<P>     Finney plays the quintessential mean and strict teacher that
almost every boy hates.  He is called "the Hitler of the lower fifth"
by the students.  Actually one boy does admit to liking him, and it is
because of something this boy does that the movie gets its title.
Finney's character reminded me of my Advanced Math teacher in high
school who was as tough as nails and everybody, except me, was scared
to death of her.  I thought she was great.</P>
<P>     The other part of the story is a love triangle between Finney, his
wife (well played by Greta Scacchi) and the science teacher (acceptably
acted by Matthew Modine).  Greta Scacchi is a gorgeous actress who also
played someone having an affair in A MAN IN LOVE (1987), which is one
of my favorite little known movies.  In A MAN IN LOVE, it is hard not
to want to run away with her.  In this movie however, you feel sad for
her and even a little angry at her for cheating on such a great
husband.</P>
<P>     I can not say enough about Finney's performance.  He plays a tough
character who turns out to be vulnerable and human after all.  It would
have been easy to cry for him.  An extremely touching performance.  His
slow character development is a testament to his acting ability, to
some excellent direction by Mike Figgis, and to Ronald Harwood's script
that is in no hurry.  It is a slow movie, but a well paced one.  It is
a sad and touching movie, yet ultimately a life affirming one.  It has
a particularly well done ending.</P>
<P>     If you like serious and touching shows, if you like well drawn
characters, and if you don't mind shedding a tear or two, then I
heartily recommend this to you and award it ***.  It runs 1:37.  It is
incorrectly rated R.  Actually it is almost PG material except for two
uses of the F word.  There is no sex, nudity, or violence of any kind.
I think most teenagers would love it.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
