<PRE>A Note to Miramax
MY TRIBUTE TO ‘SCREAM'
By Jamey Hughton</PRE>

<P>WARNING: THE FOLLOWING COMMENTARY MAY REVEAL SPOILERS FROM THE "SCREAM"
FILMS, PRIMARILY "SCREAM 3". IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM AND WISH TO DO
SO WITH NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLOT, AND BY SOME MIRACLE OF NATURE YOUR
HIGH SCHOOL CRONIES HAVEN'T SPILLED ALL THE BEANS, THEN PROCEED WITH
CAUTION.</P>
<P>Well, here I am. It's been several days since my `Scream 3' experience,
and I'm still wearing a gratified smirk across my face. Now, this
particular smirk is not merely due to the fact I thought the film was a
riot. It has to do with closure....the final lace being neatly tied in
the phenomenal horror series that made slasher films fun again. And
perhaps more fun than ever before.</P>
<P>I've seen `Scream 3' twice. The cutting edge wit of Kevin Williamson's
caustic pen may be absent, but worthy successor Ehren Kruger finishes
the series on a positive note of great fulfillment. I willingly concede
that `Scream 3' is the sloppiest of the trilogy, with a generic serial
killer plot-line that occasionally emits the pungent stench of a good
formula gone sour. But it's still fun. Watching Williamson's characters
evolve with such prudent care is a treat for all fans of the series.
Now, when did the smirk materialize across my face exactly? It was the
final shot of the movie, which performs a miracle of closure. Never mind
the obtrusive plot holes that were scattered throughout the film earlier
(namely with the unmasking of the killer)... this is a brilliantly
effective way for Kruger to conclude the movie and the trilogy. Kevin
Williamson would concur.</P>
<P>Which is why I ask Miramax to end it here. Let `Scream' rest in peace
and maintain the amount of dignity warranted by a proper burial like
this. After the biggest opening weekend of the series - an estimated
$34.7 million in box office ticket sales - the idea of a `Scream 4'
could have perhaps crossed the mind of certain executives at Miramax. I
shudder to think of the possible resurrection of the series after such a
commendable finale. With that frightening piece of information in mind,
I offer the following tribute to the `Scream' franchise, which shattered
the rules of conventional horror in more ways than one. Just think.... a
slasher series with actual character development, that didn't take its
core audience for merely a pack of adolescent idiots who were stupid
enough to shell out the cash. I love the whole `Scream' universe, and
with this memorial, I'd just like to get a few things off my shoulder
and say adios for the last time.</P>
<PRE>OBSESSED? OBVIOUSLY.</PRE>
<P>Yeah, I know. It's just a stupid movie. But while watching the `Scream'
movies, I get that nostalgic feeling of blissful glee knowing that this
is the highest form of barbed wit and palatable ingenuity that the genre
will ever see. The `Scream' films (or at least the first two) are among
my favorites, despite the fact I didn't award either with my highest
rating. Keep in mind, dear readers, that ‘favorite' doesn't necessarily
go alongside ‘best'.
I rewatch them with the same amount of jubilant excitement and discovery
every time, acknowledging that there are enough pop culture references
and wink-wink in-jokes to even satisfy those who despise slasher films
with a passion. Take one scene in `Scream 2', where a pair of dim-witted
sorority sisters (Portia De Rossi and Rebecca Gayheart) explain that the
hoopla surrounding the movie `Stab' is only related to our heroine
Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) in a `six degrees of Kevin Bacon sort of
way'. Or in the original `Scream', when tanktop-lovin' Tatum (Rose
McGowan) notes that the murders in their small town of Woodsboro are
beginning to sound like `something out a Wes Carpenter flick'. Just for
the record, that's a combination of horror pioneer and `Scream' director
Wes Craven and another legendary gore-meister by the name of John
Carpenter. And then, there's `The Rules'. You don't know The Rules?
According to obsessively paranoid film geek Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy),
there are certain rules one must abide by to successfully survive a
horror movie.....</P>
<P>1) You can never have sex.
2) You can never drink or do drugs.
3) Never, ever, under any circumstances, say `I'll be right back'.
Randy is obviously knowledgeable on the topic of the endlessly recycled
teen slasher genre. With `Prom Night', `Sleepaway Camp', and the
seemingly infinite `Friday the 13th' franchise, one could identity a
popular cinematic trend throughout the 1980's. Hmmm...if someone were to
lampoon this trend in a sly parody of modern horror, the result would be
amusing. Right? It took until 1996 for rookie screenwriter Kevin
Williamson to do so. With `Scream', the horror genre was revitalized
into a hip new slice of bloody pop culture where movie references
abound. It was a rarity that promised the audience an ample quota of
scares and laughs... and delivered. But, when you get right down to it,
the `Scream' films are about murder. They're merely customary slasher
films, elevated substantially by a self-mocking manner that is sharp,
witty and refreshing. Which brings me to....</P>
<PRE>THE TOP THREE MURDERS</PRE>
<P>1) Drew Barrymore in `Scream'. This positively blood-chilling opening
sequence will be what the series is remembered by; the trademark moments
when the intensity and cunning brilliance of the screenplay and
direction reach peak form. Casey Becker (Barrymore), home alone to watch
a scary movie and make Jiffy Pop, receives a call from a pestering
gravely voice. He calls again, and again.... until it becomes evident
that he is outside her home with the strict intent of gutting her like a
fish before the night is through. After she answers a trivia question
(category: horror villains) incorrectly, she watches in petrified horror
as her boyfriend's intestinal tract spills out onto her patio. What is
arguably the most horrific sequence in the trilogy ends with an image
that strikes down the viewer with morbid dread: Casey's bloody body,
dangling from a tree, is discovered by her parents. Not surprising, the
remainder of the film is unable to recapture the type of merciless,
apprehensive terror as seen with Casey Becker's untimely demise.</P>
<P>2) Jamie Kennedy in `Scream 2'. Kevin Williamson risked creating a mob
of angry, devastated fans with this shocking (and particularly ballsy)
move. Fan favorite Randy Meeks, with cellular phone in hand, carries on
a crackling conversation on a college campus park with the killer.
During this time, Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale (Courteney Cox
Arquette) madly dash to scout the possible caller, tackling students
with cell-phones to the ground. Unfortunately, Randy gets grabbed from
behind and hauled into a news van, where he is repeatedly stabbed to
death.
The park scene represents some of Williamson's sharpest writing, but
director Wes Craven is the real craftsman to mention, fashioning an
eerie atmosphere in a scene set in broad daylight - not an easy thing to
do. An incredibly effective crane shot, revealing that Randy is the only
person in the vicinity, shifts the tone from edgy humor (produced by the
quirky phone conversation) to claustrophobic suspense perfectly. And
after the deed is done, the sight of viscous blood seeping through the
crack under the van door (not to mention Gale's horrified reaction) just
leaves you cold and shivering.  A worthy farewell to a great character.</P>
<P>3) Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps in `Scream 2'. It's your worst nightmare:
a movie theater packed with drooling, raving fanatics in ghostface
costumes, clutching plastic knives everywhere you turn. This is the
environment when Maureen (Pinkett) and Phil (Epps) enter a sneak preview
of `Stab', the movie-within-a-movie based on the slayings in `Scream'.
After discussing the politics of African-American driven films (or lack
thereof), they enter, despite the fact that Maureen is opting for the
Sandra Bullock flick down the street. Should've gone with Sandra,
because `Hope Floats' is still better than getting gorily diced any day
of the week.
In a nutshell: Phil goes to washroom, gets stabbed through the stall
door. The masked murderer travels back to the theater and sits next to
Maureen, donning Phil's jacket. Maureen is slashed repeatedly, as the
movie-going onlookers watch the murder transpire, thinking it's some
publicity stunt for the film. Talk about setting the mood... this
opening sequence is creepy and unsettling. You'll be squirming in your
seat, but at least the events in `Stab' are amusing: Heather Graham,
playing Drew Barrymore's character from the original, reenacts the
famous opening murder with a classic lampoon of farcical glee.</P>
<P>Honorable Mentions:
-Tatum has garage door problems in `Scream'.
-Tom (Matt Keeslar) `smells the gas' in `Scream 3'.</P>
<PRE>CLEARING UP THE
‘SEQUEL MANNER'....</PRE>
<P>An unexpected backlash arose with the release of `Scream 3': certain
people suddenly started bagging on `Scream 2'. Let me clear this up.
In my opinion, `Scream 2' could possibly be the best of the trilogy. It
offers more thrills than the original, the humor is fresh and equally
amusing, and the characters develop with devoted compassion. I guess
what the majority of viewers are irritated with is the finale, when the
whodunit is revealed. Where the original was a somber and serious
climactic revelation, this one is more like a `Scooby Doo' adventure. Oh
no, Shaggy! It's not bothersome reporter Debbie Salt at all... it's
actually Mrs. Loomis (Laurie Metcalf), Billy's mother returning for her
vengeance! Ok, it is a little goofy. But, even though it stands as the
weakest link of the film, it's still decent enough. And good ol' Kevin
Williamson keeps the wit vibrating throughout the entire series of
complications, as when the `freaky Tarantino film student' Mickey
(Timothy Olyphant), the other murderous half behind the ghostface mask,
battles a surprisingly resilient Sidney on a theater stage. `Sid, you
got a Linda Hamilton thing going,' Mickey says as the scale finally tips
in his favor.</P>
<P>The conclusion is only so-so, but I think people forget what an
efficient horror masterpiece Williamson and Craven had crafted before
the stupidity factor kicked in.
Financially, `Scream 2' was just as successful as its predecessor.
Critically, it fared even better than the decidedly mixed reception that
`Scream' received upon its original release (don't argue with me -
that's a fact). While `Scream 2' is one of the best sequels I've ever
seen, `Scream 3' is simply a fun but totally generic slasher movie.
Anyone who favors the third over the second has forgotten what the
`Scream' movies were about to begin with.</P>
<PRE>A DEWEY DEDICATION</PRE>
<P>Dwight `Dewey' Riley began as a simple-minded Deputy in the small town
of Woodsboro. Unfortunately, during a courageous sweep of a bloody crime
scene, he was stabbed in the back. Dewey returned, albeit with a limp
from severed nerve damage, to protect his friends from further possible
danger on a college campus. Unfortunately, he was stabbed in the
back.... many, many times. But Dewey pulled through. Now unable to
continue with his law-enforcing duties, Dewey applied his knowledge to
the job of technical consultant on a film set. Again, Dewey showed
commendable bravery in battling another evil, costumed psycho who wanted
to mutilate his dear friends.</P>
<P>Kudos to David Arquette for, three times over, playing such a likable
character so well. It only occurred to me how much I love the doofus
when, during a few near-death scenarios in `Scream 3', I let out a
piercing howl of `LOOK OUT, DEWEY!!!!' ....well, not really. But Dewey
is still the most charming, lovable personality in the `Scream'
universe. When he walks into a room, the mood suddenly becomes light and
enjoyable. How many different ways can I say it? The guy is awesome. So
Dewey, take care, and know that you will always have a welcome
place..... in our VCR.</P>
<P>I don't like to single anybody out. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox
Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Liev Schreiber... in your returning roles, you
were (*sniff*) inspirational. And everyone else - Skeet Ulrich, Matthew
Lillard, Elise Neal, Jerry O'Connell, Duane Martin, Parker Posey, Jenny
McCarthy and associates - I appreciate your help as well. `Scream', you
shall be remembered in a positive light. R.I.P., good buddy.</P>
