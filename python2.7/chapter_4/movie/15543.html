<P>Pixar animation and Walt Disney Pictures presents 'A Bug's Life'.  The
film is a rousing pleasure to watch, to listen to and to think about
after it's done.  There isn't much to think about in a philosophical
sense but the brilliant attention to detail using the most advanced and
state of the art special effects and computer techniques available have
you guessing just exactly how it was all done.</P>
<P>Similar to 'Antz', also released recently, 'A Bug's Life' details the
antics of an ant colony.  The main character, voiced by Dave Foley is
named Flick and he's the nerdy little foul up whom you would never
expect to be a hero.  Other prominent characters that celebrities lend
their voices to for the production are the Princess (Julia
Louis-Dreyfuss), her mother the Queen (Phyllis Diller) and their
relationship with the good guys (other insects) and the bad guys, a
swarm of grasshoppers led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey).  A minor character,
Mr. Soil, is voiced by Roddy McDowell, a classic actor making his last
contribution to motion pictures as he died earlier this year from
cancer.</P>
<P>After a major foul-up by Flick, the colony loses all food collected for
the grasshoppers, (after all, grasshoppers ARE above ants in the food
chain), Hopper orders the ants to begin again and says that his army
will destroy the ants if they come back at the end of the rainy season
and there isn't any food.  After a trial, Flick is banned from the
colony and finds himself on his own where he befriends a group of other
insects connected to a flea circus.  Prominent among the characters are
a butterfly (Madeline Kahn), a walking stick bug (David Hyde-Pierce), a
ladybug (Denis Leary) and a black widow spider (Bonnie Hunt).  Flick
recruits them in a comical way to return with him to the colony and
stand up to Hopper and the others when they return to bully the ants for
food.</P>
<P>I give much credit is given to Pixar and Disney for making the
potentially hideous insects adorable and cute for kids to laugh at and
become wide-eyed.  One of the most hideous creatures in nature is the
spider but it's drawn so well in this movie, that you can't take your
eyes off the screen for it or any other optical candy intended for
adults as much as it is for kids.</P>
<P>'A Bug's Life' is directed by John Lasseter ('Toy Story') and Andrew
Stanton and the screenplay is by Andrew Stanton, Donald McEnery and Bob
Shaw.  Cleverly used in the film, and it should be in all films of a
cartoonish nature, are the ingeniously used clichés thrown in such as a
bug being attracted to a bright light, how they hang around food
containers that become trash etc, etc.  Especially nice is the film's
running time which actually exceeds 90 minutes and gives the audience
its money worth and isn't 70 or 80 minutes in length.  I guess that
explains why they used a lot of t.v. actors.  Their scale of pay
wouldn't cost as much as a big name such as Tom Hanks, whose character
voice of Woody in 'Toy Story' probably commanded a high salary so more
money is available for a longer running time in this production.  'A
Bug's Life' is perfect for the attention span of children and the
satisfying appetite of adults.  A charming romp all the way which don't
require being written about at great lengths.  Just enough to highly
recommend it.</P>
