<PRE>A Spirited "Election"
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>Smart movies are getting harder to come by.  Smart movies that are
entertaining are even tougher to find.  Give us a good story, honesty
within the script, and a good cast, and you've got yourself a movie
that'll go to the head of the class.  So before the summer session
begins, enroll yourself in what might be one of the hidden gems of this
movie year.  It's called "Election", and you won't find a smarter film
this month.</P>
<P>`Election' takes a unique look at life in high school.  It forwards the
notion that at that tender time of adolescence, everyone's primary goal
in life is to do something that will benefit themselves.  All others
are just obstacles to be stepped on.  Specifically, it centers on a
student body President race, and the three final contenders span the
gamut of personality types from zealous overachiever to popular jock to
irreverent lesbian.   The presidency is a tool that each one can use to
further their goals.  This story is also about frumpish
three-time-Teacher-of-the-Year Mr. McAllistar (Mathew Broderick). He
cares about each student, imparts sage advice whenever he can, and is
as much a part of high school life as study hall, detention and pep
rallies.  He oversees the student body election, but despite his
general hands-off disposition, certain circumstances cause him to take
more of an interest in who wins.  </P>
<P>Above all, he wants to stop Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) from
achieving the greatness that she is destined to achieve.  Partially,
it's because she had an affair with one of his colleagues.  But mostly,
there is just something intolerable about the Tracy Flicks of the
world.  She is always the first to raise her hand in class and always
volunteers time for every club.  On the outside, she is a prim, perky
angel.  But on the inside, there broods a vindictive jezebel and
merciless competitor.  In her bid, she spends late nights stamping out
`Pick Flick' pins and prepares 500 cupcakes on the morning of the
election.  McAllistar hates her with a passion yet also lusts for her. 
His solution is to convince Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against
her, who can leverage his reputation as the popular jock who's
handsome, rich (thanks to his father), and well-liked.  When Tracy
learns of Paul's entry into the presidential race, she projects a cold
look of disdain that could send shivers up your spine.</P>
<P>Within the high school genre lies an untapped lode of great stories and
varied personalities.  Here, we aptly see that it's a vacuum of
'me-centered' people who do what they can to survive.  I still remember
the trials and tribulations of high school as if it were only
yesterday.  The student body was like a rich tapestry full of color,
surprises, and confusion.  `Election" is a strikingly refreshing story
that satirizes the culture of high school and gives us a production
that is unique, original, and honest.  There are no corny love stories,
no sign of students who looked like 20 something models, no goofy
cliques, no bets on who could win the heart of a girl, and no climactic
scenes that always seems to take place at a wild house party or at the
prom.  If only high school students were as smart as this movie, we'd
all graduate to bigger and better things.</P>
