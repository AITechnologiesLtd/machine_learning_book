<P>   Whatever the virtues of lack of same in Wayne Wang's
movie, "Chinese Box," the film is valuable because like
Haskell Wexler's "Medium Cool," the drama is told against a
background of a turning point in history.  Wexler's film, which
featured the newly-discovered Robert Foster, portrays a TV
cameraman who is detached although surrounded by events
demanding his involvement, and uses real footage of his
actors at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.  Wang's
current movie is a tale of an increasingly resigned British
journalist-photographer whose final months in Hong Kong are
played out against a background of the island's imminent
takeover by the government of Mainland China during the first
half of 1997.</P>
<P>   Wang is for the most part as laid-back in his direction of
this seemingly improvised piece as he was at the helm of his
more accessible (to Americans) "Smoke" and "Blue in the
Face," both humorous character studies of typical denizens of
Brooklyn and parts of Manhattan.  (Educated in British and
American schools, the director's fondness for things American
is no secret: he is, in fact, named after John Wayne.)  The
freewheeling director's current effort is not particularly
noteworthy for incisive dialogue but more notable in its
evocation of the atmosphere of one of the world's great tourist
destinations which, for the time being, is being governed with
a hands-off attitude by the Chinese government.  The major
flaw in "Chinese Box" is its heavyhanded manipulation of
metaphors, not just in some of the expressions tossed about
such as comparing Hong Kong to "Pompeii before Vesuvius,"
a "department store under new management," and "a whore
who must become accustomed to a new pimp," but principally
in its use of one female character who, presumably like the
city, is scarred on the outside but reckless beneath the
surface.</P>
<P>   If one line defines the drama, it's a humorous one tossed
off by a gypsy-like journalist, Jim (Ruben Blades), who is
temporarily sharing the flat of his photojournalist friend, John
(Jeremy Irons).  Offered a bottle of cheap wine which Jim
defines as "Chateau Hong Kong 1997," John replies, "It was a
good year...no doubt about it."  The irony of the remark is
palpable.  1997 is the year of uncertainty and anxiety.  The
British, ruling the place for a century and half, are scheduled
to leave on July 1, the future of the foreign journalists is
uncertain, and worst of all, the leukemia-afflicted John is not
expected to survive to see another year.  For the past year
John has been in love with Vivian (Gong Li), once a high-
class prostitute who is involved with prosperous businessman
Chang (Michael Hui).  Vivian wants to marry Chang but is
rebuffed because the Chinese culture looks askance at
women with her background.  John is able to enjoy Vivian
from time to time, however, as the beautiful former "hostess"
seeks him out each time her boyfriend puts her off.</P>
<P>   A second story features John's relationship with Jean
(Maggie Cheung), a street woman who makes her living
hawking fake Rolexes and, symbolically, a can containing "the
last breath of colonial air."  Fascinated by her interesting
albeit heavily scarred face and her impulsive, tension-filled
bearing, he pays her for a videotaped interview but learns
through old newspaper clippings that she is hiding one key
detail.  When she was sixteen, she fell in love with a young
Briton, was forbidden by her father from seeing him, and
attempted suicide.</P>
<P>   Each time the loosely constructed story seems to have no
place to go, Wang's regular cinematographer, Emir Kusturica,
runs his hand-held camera to the outside world. We see
glimpses of both the prosperity and the poverty of the island,
fishing boats competing with glass skyscrapers for our
attention, as people go about their jobs slaughtering chickens,
cutting up fish, hawking food in the marketplace or enjoying
the sensual dances of women in upscale night clubs. 
Kusturica includes some precious shots of the departure of
the British, some with tears in their eyes, and the arrival in
tanks of thousands of young soldiers from the mainland to the
cheers of hordes of citizens.  (In two cases dissenters show
their disapproval of the change of government; one by
shooting himself in the presence of New Year's Eve revelers
in a classy club, the other by torching himself on the street.)</P>
<P>   The principal chemistry in the movie is, unfortunately, not
between Irons and Li, both of whom seem to be holding
themselves back as though unable to transcend their cultural
differences, but between Irons and his guitar-playing
roommate, Jim.  Ruben Blades provides the needed comic
moments in this meandering tale whose principal value is not
as a romance or as a study of a dying man's attempt to
express his love, but as a docu-drama recording the changing
of the guard over what is perhaps the world's most capitalistic
enclave.  The outdoor sequences might have come from the
pen of Paul Theroux, one of the scripters and America's most
notable travel writer.  While "Chinese Box" is far better than
Wang's only failure, "Slam Dance," it does not rise to the
heights of his best work, "Dim Sum," a delicate reflection on
family values filmed in San Francisco. Not Rated.  Running
time: 109 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
