<PRE>                                SHE-DEVIL
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        Revenge may be ugly, but it sure is a lot of fun in SHE-DEVIL.  In
the casting coup of the year, Meryl Streep plays the comic role, a
glamorous romance novelist, and Roseanne Barr plays the serious part, an
anything-but-glamorous housewife.  The link between these two women is Ed
Begley, Jr., who plays Barr's husband.  He's having an affair with Streep
... and with his secretary.  So Barr does what any sensible housewife would
do: she seeks REVENGE--sweet, bloody, vicious revenge!  Her goal is to
systematically ruin Begley's life.</P>
<P>        SHE-DEVIL is the blackest comedy I've seen since HEATHERS.  And
like HEATHERS, the movie is a fantasy; you're expected to take the
outlandish story with a grain of salt.  Director Susan Seidelman isn't
concerned with giving us something to chew on; she's more intent on giving
us a good time--and she does!  SHE-DEVIL is a thoroughly enjoyable affair.</P>
<P>        The movie stands out for its visual style.  Seidelman makes
extraordinarily good use of the movie camera.  For example, the slow-mo of
Barr tripping in high heels is hysterical--so is the silent movie parody of
Barr and Linda Hunt fixing up an old warehouse.  Seidelman's tour de force
direction is almost as memorable as the performances.</P>
<P>        What can you say about Streep that hasn't already been said?  Well,
for one, she makes a great dizzy blonde.  Streep has played all sorts of
roles before, but never one quite like this.  It's jolting to see her act
air-headed, ultra-feminine, and super-flirtatious.  Streep is known as the
greatest dramatic actresses of our time; SHE-DEVIL gives her the chance to
show-off her knack for comedy.  She emerges as a wonderfully gifted comic
actress, turning a potentially generic role into something truly special
... and funny.</P>
<P>        Barr is not Streep's equal, but even so, she holds her own against
her more experienced co-star.  Barr makes you feel sorry for her klutzy,
unattractive character: you can't help but root for the rejected housewife
as she carries out her revenge.  Barr shows a surprisingly natural screen
presence in her film debut.</P>
<P>        SHE-DEVIL is essentially light-weight fluff, but you hardly notice
because you're too busy appreciating the performances, the direction, and
the humor.</P>
