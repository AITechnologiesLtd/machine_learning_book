<P>PRACTICAL MAGIC
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ** (out of ****)
Warner Bros. / 1:50 / 1998 / PG-13 (sensuality, violence, language, 
thematic elements)
Cast: Sandra Bullock; Nicole Kidman; Stockard Channing; Dianne Wiest; 
Aidan Quinn; Goran Visnjic 
Director: Griffin Dunne 
Screenplay: Robin Swicord; Akiva Goldsman; Adam Brooks <HR>Double, double, toil and trouble. Cast two luminous leading ladies as 
sibling witches and watch the cinematic cauldron bubble - or so one 
would think. But even with the full-fledged charms of Sandra Bullock and 
Nicole Kidman (_especially_ Nicole Kidman) firmly in place and working 
to maximum potency, their vehicle "Practical Magic" still comes off as 
half-baked hocus-pocus. Is it a black comedy, a family drama, a 
supernatural thriller or all of the above and more? Thanks to its wildly 
inconsistent tone, we may never know. </P>
<P>For a while, the movie is adept enough to juggle genres, but something 
wicked appears to have taken over scripting duties around its 
midsection. Not a whole lot of "Practical Magic"'s supernatural scenario 
is adequately explained, and it's a gargantuan goof-up when a film is 
given the opportunity to create its own rules and then refuses to play 
by them. Underwritten and overplotted, "Practical Magic" ultimately 
vexes more often than it hexes, culminating in supremely foolish 
business like straight-faced demonic possession and an exorcism that 
includes the neighborhood PTA. The varied light-and-dark agenda really 
clashes in moments like these. </P>
<P>When all else fails, at least Bullock and Kidman make an enchanting pair 
of contemporary sorceresses. They're respectively cast as Sally and 
Gillian Owens, sisters in a bloodline of white magic-dabblers long 
plagued by a centuries-old curse - that any man who falls in love with a 
gal from their clan is guaranteed an untimely demise. Widowed Sally has 
learned this the hard way and moves in with her dotty aunts (Stockard 
Channing and Dianne Wiest); free-spirited Gillian spares herself the 
potential heartache by engaging only in quickie relationships all over 
the map. </P>
<P>Gillian's latest squeeze is a studly cowboy (Goran Visnjic) who hails 
from Transylvania and drinks like a fish. A volatile encounter that 
involves him, them and some belladonna sets off an ugly chain of 
incidents that eventually gains the attention of an affable cop (Aidan 
Quinn); he may or may not be Sally's soul mate, but they fall for each 
other either way. It's here where "Practical" begins to lose the magic - 
not only does this budding romance lack both chemistry and credibility, 
it seems like a complete afterthought. And the Quinn character has other 
problems to boot: Could his ensuing detective work possibly be any 
shoddier? </P>
<P>So "Practical Magic"'s strange brew never quite comes to a boil, despite 
consistently spellbinding performances and the promise of its first 
half. If the filmmakers had cleaned up the scatterbrained story threads 
and provided stronger explanations for some of their weirder tangents, 
this movie could have been an enjoyable little date flick. But the 
spells cast by the nifty premise and the adorable cast end up enchanting 
all by themselves, leaving "Practical Magic" to finish in a hazy place 
somewhere between the bewildered and the bewitched.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"'StarGate' is like a film school exercise. Assignment: Conceive of the 
weirdest plot you can think of, and reduce it as quickly as possible to 
action movie cliches. If possible, include sun god Ra, and make sure 
something gets blowed up real good." -Roger Ebert on "StarGate"</P>
