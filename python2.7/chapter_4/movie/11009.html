<PRE>DARK CITY</PRE>
<PRE> Reviewed by Harvey Karten, Ph.D.</PRE>
<P> New Line Cinema
 Director:  Alex Proyas
 Writer:  Alex Proyas, Lem Dobbs
 Cast: William Hurt, Rufus Sewell, Richard O'Brien, Kiefer
Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly, Ian Richardson</P>
<P>   "I can do anything I want just so long as I concentrate,"
brags John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) in Australian director Alex
Proyas's movie, the director's lunge to duplicate Fritz Lang's
fame.  The director does not quite share his hero's worthy
attribute: focused though he may be on providing a classic
tale of the woes of conformity and the benefits of individuality,
he succeeds principally in creating visual grandeur.  Perhaps
that's more than enough, as Proyas's targeted audience is
probably the 17-25 year old set who dig the sophisticated
comic books which have emerged during the past two
decades. </P>
<P>   Proyas's devotees, mavens of the sci-fi-horror genre, have
looked forward to the release of this film, having adored his
best known work, "The Crow" (1994), which became known
far beyond the intended audience because of a tragedy which
took place on the set. In that film Brandon Lee, in the role of
Eric Draven--who, with the help of a crow seeks vengeance
after he and his fiancee are murdered--was accidentally killed
just before the conclusion from a gunshot wound, digital
magic allowing him to complete the job after his demise.  Like
"The Crow," "Dark City has a visual style courtesy of
cinematographer Dariusz Wolski which owes much to the
study of comic books, called graph novels by their
fans.  Using extreme motions to evoke the most startling
effects, Wolski would swoop high above his city and then
suddenly dip, exploiting shadows, and creating an
expressionistic embellishment of edifices.  This mobility has
an effect that would greatly please Charlie Chaplin, whose
"Modern Times" (1936) attacks the impersonality of the
machine age and Fritz Lang, whose "Metropolis" (1926)
fantasizes a futuristic city and its mechanized society with an
upper-class young man's abandonment of a life of luxury to
join oppressed workers in a revolt.</P>
<P>   Few would argue that Proyas's plots take precedence over
his visual perceptions.  This time around, though, Proyas
transcends the simple story of vengeance which drives "The
Crow" and reaches for a more transcendent motif:
humankind's struggle for individuality against the pressures of
conformity.  Ayn Rand would be proud of him.  His principal
character, John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), finds himself in a
seedy hotel, awakening to find a dead prostitute in his room,
and soon discovers he is wanted for a series of brutal killings
of women in the same profession.  He remembers nothing,
however, unaware of his guilt or innocence in the slayings. 
He might as well be a reborn babe, springing to existence yet
thrust immediately into the throes of mid-life crisis.  He may or
may not be married to the lovely Emma (Jennifer Connelly)
but is told that he has become estranged from her because of
her alleged affairs with other men.  Murdoch is pursued by an
obsessed police inspector, Frank Bumstead (William Hurt),
and by a far more dangerous trackers known as The
Strangers. These Magritte-style, conjunctivitis-afflicted
refugees from a Charles Addams strip came from another
world where they are dying of conformity and seek to enter
the bodies of earthlinks whom they are studying with the help
of Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland).  </P>
<P>   Anyone over the age of twenty-five is likely to be confused
by the plot logistics, which involve the imprinting of memories
(via injections straight into the forehead) and by the strange
manner of speaking of the weird Dr. Shreber, who seems to
utter three words at a time, pause, and then continue his
perplexing train of thought.  His vocal pattern mimics the
jaggedness of the story line, though we do learn that he is in
effect a double agent, pretending to help The Strangers while
actually helping Murdoch to drive them out of the city. The
Strangers relentlessly pursue John because he is the one
human being who shares their ability to do Tuning: to alter the
environment (allowing doors to appear out of nowhere in brick
walls, shoving tall buildings together at will, even changing the
architecture from contemporary to art deco and redesigning
room, creating palatial splendor from a workman's hovel.</P>
<P>   As The Strangers fly blithely through the air, bald heads
gleaming, eyes turning redder while they are enveloped in a
sickly-green light, we may appreciate the special effects
(created in a Sydney, Australia studio) as we watch a city
which seems to emerge from the 1940s turn into a cold,
impersonal, machine-like organism.  But we've been there
before.  We've seen albino-style bogeyman in the
cheaply-made 1950s sci-fi thrillers, and our vampire pictures
have processed ghouls who like The Strangers shun light,
humanity, and bright colors.  Sewell does well, however, as
the terminally scared prey who must use his frightful powers
against the Strangers, though the 6'3" William Hurt seems
embarrassed by his role as an inspector with a penchant for
detail, in no way the sort of characterization he has enjoyed in
three-dimensional plots such as "The Big Chill" and in the
more compelling sci-fi adventure, "Altered States."  </P>
<P>   Even the slogan used to rouse the heroes to action has
been used before, by New York's Mayor Giuliani, who
pledged successfully to "take back our city."</P>
<PRE>Rated R.  Running Time: 103 minutes.  (C) 1998
