<P>_The_Celebration_(Festen)_ (R) **** (out of ****)</P>
<P>The title of this Danish import couldn't be more ironic.  First, there's
the literal level, in the plot: the sixtieth birthday bash of a wealthy
patriarch Helge (Hennig Moritzen) becomes something decidedly less festive
when his successful eldest son Christian (Ulrich Thomsen) disrupts the
event with some shocking allegations about him and Christian's dead twin
sister.  On a deeper level, there's the irony of tone: while the charges
being made by Christian are as serious as they can get, the situation is
played for some gleefully venomous laughs--making the overall mood sort of
a "celebration" of everyone's misery.</P>
<P>It's a fine line to walk, that between comedy and misery, but
director/co-writer (with Mogens Rukov) Thomas Vinterberg handle the
balancing act magnificently.   While one is often laughing at and with
Christian's shamelessly disruptive antics, one can feel the pain that
compels him to do so.  The real balancing act, though, is how Vinterberg
keeps the truth largely ambiguous through his characters; they are
portrayed equal parts bad and good, so it's often up to question whether or
not Christian is telling the truth or merely spiting his father.  It's that
heightened sense of reality--in accordance with the Danish film movement
called "Dogme 95," which sets standards for realism and "purity"--that
lends _Festen_ an uncommon power, even if some "realist" techniques become
somewhat irksome (i.e. shaky, cinema-verite hand-held camera work).</P>
