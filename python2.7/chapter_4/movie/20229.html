<P>As Reviewed by James Brundage (MovieKritic2000)</P>
<P> In the words of Lisa Simpson, "the few, the proud, the geeky."  Indeed,
these three adjectives are as good descriptions for the completely likeable
band of misfits put forth in Mystery Men.</P>
<P> In Champion City, the superhero market is pretty much cornered by Captain
Amazing (Greg Kinnear).  The villains are all defeated... crime is down...
the corporate sponsors are backing out.  Yes, you heard right, Captain
Amazing is a walking, talking, crime fighting ad for toothpaste and soda.
Striding around in an expensive suit, he saves the day every chance he can
for the celebrity endorsements he gets to do.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), master of silverware, The Shoveler
(William H. Macy), master of dirt moving, and Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller),
master of getting really pissed, roam the streets at night looking to win a
battle.  Of course, they fail every single time, but who really cares?</P>
<P> They spend each night roaming around, getting stabbed with their own forks
or hit with their own shovels and heading to the local cafe for coffee
served by the attractive waitress Monica (Claire Forlani), whom Mr. Furious
has a crush on.</P>
<P> Back to the wonderful antics of Captain Amazing, who has all of the
endorsements and all of the intelligence as the average MAW (Model Actor
Whatever).  Using his power as his real identity, he sets free Casanova
Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) so that the ensuing battles will help get him
back the precious Pepsi endorsement that he has just lost.  Only one
problem, he has the general IQ of a tack and soon finds himself held
prisoner.</P>
<P> And the Mystery Men (although they can never decide on a name to give
themselves) have to save the day.</P>
<P> The begin recruiting super heroes with bizarre powers such as Invisible Boy
(Kel Mitchell), who can only become invisible whenever no one is looking at
him and he's not looking at himself.  Invisible Boy helps them recruit an
entire bunch including The Spleen (Paul Reubens), master of flatulence, The
Bowler, who keeps her father's skull encased in a pink bowling ball, and The
Sphinx, whose power remains a mystery.</P>
<P>They get non-lethal weapons from a the mad scientist Doc Heller (Tom Waits)
and then have to face Casanova Frankestien, Tony P. (Eddie Izzard) and the
Disco Gang before a hideous weapon destroys Champion City.</P>
<P> In case your wondering why the hell I would spend about 400 words on  plot,
the answer is simple: plot alone makes Mystery Men worth seeing.  It's so
ungodly wacky, so hilarious in its premise that one cannot help but laugh.
Were that not enough to carry a movie (and past films have proved that
movies can be carried on much less), the film is blessed with a perfect
comic timing that makes all of the wordplays and jokes pass off
effortlessly.  A good deal of slapstick helps keep oh ye of little brains
occupied while the juicer cerebellum focuses on the more intelligent attacks
on the nature of comic books in general (the reason that no one recognizes
super heroes who merely change from having glasses to not having glasses)
and the type of bizarre powers that are featured in Marvel or DC comic
books.</P>
<P> Of all of the scenes in the film, I would have to say that the most
memorable remains when they are searching for qualified heroes.  On the list
are PMS Avenger ("I work four days a month, you have a problem with that?"),
Pencil Man and Pencil Boy, and Ballerina Man.  I don't think I have to tell
you any more how wacky and enjoyable Mystery Men is.  Besides, the rest you
should see for yourself.<HR>MovieKritic2000: Reviews for the Generation of a New Millenium
