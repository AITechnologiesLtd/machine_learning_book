<P>_Girl_on_the_Bridge_(La_Fille_sur_le_Pont)_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>Very few actors, let alone young ones, can pull off what 20something
chanteuse-turned-actrice Vanessa Paradis does in the opening minutes of
Patrice Leconte's romantic drama.  In a single take broken only by an
occasional white-on-black credit card, Paradis' Adele confides to an
unseen interrogator the reasons for her depression.  It is never
explained exactly to whom she is speaking and in what type of situation,
but that is of little consequence--in these scant minutes, the audience
instantly is given a vivid portrait of what the character is all about:
her youthful recklessness and naïveté, her sexual abandon and her
romantic soul.  While kudos go to writer Serge Frydman, it is Paradis who
brings the scene and Adele to robust life.</P>
<P>However, in Adele's eyes, her life isn't quite so healthy, and as such
she becomes the titular girl on the bridge, ready to jump when she meets
Gabor (Daniel Auteuil), a knife thrower in need of a new target.  Since
she clearly has no fear of danger, Adele is a perfect match--though it
comes to a surprise to both of them just how well they complement each
other, for these two historically down-on-their-luck characters find
themselves on an incredible streak of good fortune as they wow crowds
throughout Europe.  But as with all things, what comes up must come down.</P>
<P>_La_Fille_sur_le_Pont_ is a magical film in all senses.  On a literal
level, the surreal psychic bond that develops between Adele and Gabor
pushes the film into the realm of magical realism, and their knife
throwing scenes bear a not-so-subtle, otherworldly erotic charge.  But
the real magic comes in watching the warm sparks between Paradis and
Auteuil and following their characters' beautifully unconventional
relationship.  Jean-Marie Dreujou's stunning black-and-white
cinematography and Leconte's smart choices in music (there is no original
composed score) add to the film's whimsical, timeless spell.</P>
