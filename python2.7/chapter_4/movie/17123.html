<PRE>O.K. Garage</PRE>
<P>[Screened at the Cinequest Film Festival 9, San Jose]</P>
<PRE>[2.5/4.0]</PRE>
<P>The O.K. Garage is not a place you would really want to have your car
repaired, but Rachel finds this out the hard way when her car breaks down on
the way to work. Although the owner cheerfully claims all the work is
satisfaction guaranteed, he usually will do practically nothing and still
overbill for the work he claims to have performed. Besides this simple petty
crime, he is collaborating with bigger mobsters in a scheme to steal the
cars of some former customers, which should be easy since he has their
addresses and even car keys.</P>
<P>Rachel has a friend, Sean, who is a rather odd character. He is a writer who
of late has taken to playing with and carrying around lizards. Although
there is an obvious attraction between them, so far their relationship has
been platonic. Russell has an acquaintance, Johnny, who is himself a bit
odd. He refuses to deposit his paychecks because he is attracted to a bank
teller, but is so shy about it that he cannot get himself to go to the bank.
This is basically the story of these three characters, brought together when
Rachel seeks Sean's and Johnny's help in recovering her money.</P>
<P>Writer and director Brandon Cole confesses that he provided very little
direction and let the actors interpret the characters; Lili Taylor as
Rachel, John Turturro as Johnny, and Will Patton as Sean. The strength of
the film are the performances of Taylor and Turturro. Taylor is particular
strong as Rachel. The way she actually stomps up stairs reflects the
confidence and pluck (and attractiveness) of the character. Turturro is also
good as Johnny, but the character is often uneven, due mainly to the writing
rather than Turturro's performance. However, Patton was rather grating as
the odd Russell. With a constant wry smile and vacuous expression, he
appeared to be rigidly forcing his performance as a stereotypical eccentric,
rather than allowing the character have a natural flow. Having heard Cole
speak before and after the film, it appears that Patton based his portrayal
of Sean on the style and demeanor of Cole, but the character would have been
better with more definition.</P>
<P>The subplot of the garage owner's relationship with the mobsters injects
some life into the story. The developing romance between Johnny and Rachel
is telegraphed early and feels slightly forced, but it is not dwelled upon
so it is not objectionable. Ultimately the story feels as if Cole is trying
to communicate a larger point, but fails.</P>
<P>Marginally Recommended. There are good performances, but the writing was
rather empty. It is entertaining, but quite uncompelling.</P>
