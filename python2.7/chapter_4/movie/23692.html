<PRE>_Erin_Brockovich_ (R) *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>On paper, _Erin_Brockovich_ bears more than a passing resemblance to
1998's _A_Civil_Action_.  Both are vehicles for major Hollywood stars
(respectively, Julia Roberts and John Travolta); both are based on true
stories; and both stories are about a legal crusader helping the
residents of a small town battle a large corporation that has been
contaminating the local water supply.  Despite these striking
similarities, there remains one key difference: while treating its
serious subject matter with the gravity it deserves, _Erin_Brockovich_
also manages to be a lot of fun.</P>
<P>That fact owes a lot to the film's vibrant title character, one that I
imagine even Hollywood would have difficulty creating if reality hadn't. 
Erin (Roberts) is a vivacious, twice-divorced mother of three who, as we
meet her, is not doing a very good job selling herself at a job
interview.  The scene is short, but its few minutes vividly depict the
delicate balance that Roberts and director Steven Soderbergh achieves
throughout the film's entire two-hour-plus running time.  The scene is
undeniably funny, its humor heightened by Erin's trashy mode of dress and
the increasing desperation of her words.  But one laughs at the situation
and not her; in Roberts' eyes one can catch the underlying sadness and
seriousness of the situation, plus the gradual awareness that she's
fighting a losing battle.  For the most part, _Erin_Brockovich_ plays in
a similar way; one is consistently engaged on a purely--for lack of a
better term--"entertainment" level, but providing an underlying
foundation is something that lends the proceedings a bit more dramatic
weight.</P>
<P>The major "something" in _Erin_Brockovich_ is the aforementioned case
involving the residents of Hinkley, California, whose water supply has
long been contaminated by the large PG&E corporation.  Through some
not-terribly-convincing plot machinations, Erin gets a job as an aide to
attorney Ed Masry (Albert Finney), and it is through her work there that
she gets personally involved with the plight of the Hinkley citizens,
many of whom are suffering grave illness due to prolonged exposure to the
poisoned water.</P>
<P>Erin is brassy, smartmouthed, and, most important of all, not a lawyer,
and the bulk of the film's enjoyment derives from the ballsy, carefree
way she conducts her research and life in general.  She is also
unabashedly a woman, not afraid to call upon her feminine wiles to get
her way--allowing Roberts to be more brazenly sexual than she has since
her career-making turn in _Pretty_Woman_.  Roberts also has never been so
ideally cast since that film; the kookiness of her character gives her
ample opportunity to flash that trademark smile of hers (not to mention a
few other assets) while giving her a chance to stretch comfortably as an
actress.  Not only are there plenty of the light moments for the fans,
there are just as many heavier dramatic scenes for her to display her
serious acting chops.  That these two sides seamlessly gel into a
full-bodied character is as much a compliment to her as it is to
Soderbergh.</P>
<P>Soderbergh's sure direction keeps the action moving briskly enough, the
actors believable enough, and the audience's emotions and interest
engaged enough to forgive the overall familiarity of the story.  Erin is,
above anything else, an average woman, and this is a traditional tale of
how she bucked the odds and scored a big triumph for herself and her
fellow common folk.  What aren't so easily forgiven, however, are other
formulaic wrinkles in the script, which is credited to Susannah Grant. 
Chiefly problematic among these is her relationship with the next-door
neighbor, a kind motorcyclist named George (Aaron Eckhart).  Their
relationship begins prickly, warms to a friendship, then heats up into a
romance.  Roberts and a barely unrecognizable Eckhart are well-matched,
but their skill and rapport are shoved into some pedestrian plotting.  As
Erin gets more involved in her case, George and her kids feel neglected,
leading to the usual resentment.  It is here where Soderbergh comes up
with the one moment that rings completely, ridiculously false: tending to
Erin's kids at a barbecue, George longs for his more freewheeling days
after watching a gang of Harley-riding bikers roar by.</P>
<P>The entirety of _Erin_Brockovich_ achieves its desired--and highly
commercial--effect so well, though, that most viewers, including myself,
won't ultimately care about such awkward moments.  Soderbergh loyalists
may be a bit dismayed that this film is not as risky and experimental as
his other works, but only a filmmaker with his  fresh savvy could take a
well-worn formula and make such a satisfying entertainment.</P>
