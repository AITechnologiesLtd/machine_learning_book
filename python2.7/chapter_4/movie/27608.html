<PRE>SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2001 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>"Shadow of the Vampire" features a typically earnest performance by John
Malkovich as the great German Expressionist filmmaker Friedrich Wilhelm
Murnau, spitting lines like "I will finish this picture!" and "You can eat
Greta *after* your death scene!" with unequivocal abandon.  And it features
a wonderfully creepy, nuanced performance by Willem Dafoe as Max Schreck,
the mysterious vampire-like star of Murnau's gothic masterpiece, "Nosferatu."</P>
<P>But there's not much else to E. Elias Merhige's slow-moving tale about the
making of Murnau's 1922 film.</P>
<P>The focus, of course, is on Dafoe, who looks terrific--and acts
terrifically--under all that makeup.  As Count Orlock (Bram Stoker's estate
refused Murnau the rights to film Stoker's "Dracula" so he simply changed
the name) he outdoes Jim Carrey in "How the Grinch Stole Christmas."
Needless to say Dafoe's performance is more introspective, although he does
roll his eyes a lot in keeping with the over-the-top acting style of the
times.</P>
<P>Credit, too, must be given to Dafoe's startling makeup design.  Ann
Buchanan makes Dafoe a very convincing-looking Schreck, from the little
tufts of white hair behind his pixie-like ears to his long, skeletal
fingers, which look like a cross between Freddy Krueger's razor-sharp
appendages and those of the face hugger from "Alien"--wizened and
white-knuckled with fingernails as long as a toll collector's on the Jersey
turnpike.</P>
<P>Like "Gods and Monsters," a 1998 film that chronicled the making of James
Whale's "Frankenstein," "Shadow of the Vampire" is a thoughtful,
contemplative film that attempts to inject new blood into the machinations
of a cinematic auteur.  Unlike Bill Condon's film, however, we do get some
insight into the mind of a man who conjured up truly horrific
visions--Murnau was a fanatic and an obsessive, one who defied his producer
(here played by the great Udo Kier), worked excessively, hounded his
actors, kept secrets, and left everything to chance, all tempered by daily
doses of laudanum.  Unfortunately, the shaggy dog core of the film is that
Schreck wasn't exactly acting when he sucked the blood of his leading lady
(we're tipped off in an opening title board that refers to "Nosferatu" as
one of the most *realistic* vampire films ever made).  This puts a bit of a
shaky spin on an otherwise "serious" treatment.</P>
<P>Under Merhige's workmanlike direction, "Shadow of the Vampire" is murky
and meditative while revisiting the kind of murky vampire lore we've seen a
thousand times before.  Malkovich, surprisingly, doesn't even attempt a
German accent!  (Cary Elwes, as a replacement cinematographer, does, and
it's to his discredit.)  The opening credits sequence is so long and
puzzling--it's not obvious what we're supposed to be looking at--that it
sets a bad tone for the rest of the picture.</P>
<P>Co-produced by Nicolas Cage of all people, "Shadow of the Vampire" is
still worth catching if, for nothing else, Dafoe's fine contributions.
It's an Oscar®-caliber performance that, sadly, will no doubt be dismissed
along with the notion that this film is just another vampire picture.</P>
