<PRE>                          SECRETS AND LIES 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                       1 :-)  for family catharsis</PRE>
<P>Like most families we carry secrets which are best left behind cobwebs,
and we have told lies to help shield us from the painful truth. After
years of bitterness and distrust, and generation upon generation of ill
feeling and underlying falsities, a sense of brooding contempt and
dysfunction results.</P>
<P>This is the subject of this Mike Leigh movie, where the characters are
the movie itself. Imagine the scenario of a singe white middle-aged
Anglo-Saxon woman, living with her rebellious adult daughter. Her once
close, but now distant younger brother has been stolen away by a
seemingly cold and resentful sister-in-law. Leigh masterfully portrays
this sad and lonely woman, who has apparently failed in every aspect of
life, until a beautiful Anglo-African woman, refined and well achieved
in the field of optometry, enters her life. To her amazement she
discovers that this was the daughter who was given up for adoption many
years ago.</P>
<P>Don't snigger. If you dig around your past a little, you may
accidentally discover that your dad was an axe murderer, and your sister
is actually your mother. God forbid. Weirder things have happened. Muddy
waters are stirred, and chaos and confusion ignites in a household
already swamped with its fair share of bad weather. What initially
appears to be a natural disaster, becomes the catalyst that opens an old
festering wound in need of salting.</P>
<P>The climax amounts to a luncheon birthday party, where dusty rugs are
aired with more than a cough and a sneeze. With screaming, yelling,
crying and finally hugging, Mike Leigh bends this broken family back
into the twisted shape of a circle.</P>
