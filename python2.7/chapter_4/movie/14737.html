<P>Plot: When the Huns invade China, the emperor puts out a general 
conscription calling for one man from each family to join the army to 
repel the invasion. The aging and crippled Fa Zhou is called up. To 
spare him, his daughter Mulan cuts her hair, dresses as a man and goes 
off to join the army in his place. This defiance of tradition upsets her 
ancestors who decide she must be stopped. A demoted temple dragon goes 
to offer assistance, deciding the only way it can regain his position is 
to help her triumph against The Huns.</P>
<P>I may have been one of the few to have been relatively disappointed with 
the 1990s renaissance of Disney animation. Both `Beauty and the Beast' 
(1991) and `The Lion King' (1994) were impressive. But while many have 
too hastily rushed to make comparisons to the great Disney classics, 
many other recent Disney's pale in contrast. `Aladdin' (1992) was a 
bland effort only really founded on Robin Williams being a funny man; 
`Pocahontas' (1995) seemed more constructed to toe a PC line than 
actually be a film; `The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (1996) failed to be 
the epic it artistically strove to be due to a flat, mawkish story; and 
`Hercules' (1997) took its in-jokey self-referentiality to the point of 
annoyance. I didn't approach `Mulan' with any great expectations and as 
a result ended up being pleasantly surprised.
`Mulan' is an adaption of a Chinese legend (although the character's 
name has been Anglicized to one word from the original's Mu Lan. While 
also in the creative embellishment stakes the invading army with some 
historical dubiousness turn out to be Huns). In some regards `Mulan' is 
like a `Pocahontas' - strong heroine stands against odds to 
single-handedly end a war - but with a stronger story and less of a 
feeling that it is tip-toeing on eggshells in order not to offend any 
minority group. Certainly the PC values are still there - despite being 
an animated film in English, it is scrupulous enough to cast most of the 
Chinese character parts with Asian-American actors - but not to the 
point it gets preachy and in the way of the story.</P>
<P>And in all other regards it is a satisfyingly well-rounded film - a warm 
balance of humour, a likeable obligatory supporting cast of small 
talking animal sidekicks, a strong female lead (something that is also 
requisite for the new PC Disney these days). The artwork is modelled on 
traditional Chinese lithographs and all drawn in pastel colours. While 
economically drawn, there is at least one artistically (and 
dramatically) dazzling sequence where Mulan brings an avalanche down on 
an advancing army and is forced to ride the crest of the wave on her 
horse. Amongst the characters Eddie Murphy does a standout piece as a 
fast-talking dragon. Murphy has an absolute ball and makes it the most 
memorable of the talking animal mentor/sidekick parts that Disney has 
done in recent years - far better indeed than Robin Williams's 
overrated, anachronism-spouting turn in `Aladdin'.</P>
