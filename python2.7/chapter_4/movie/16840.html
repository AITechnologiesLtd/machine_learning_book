<P>"The Quiet Room," is an exceptional, if not perfect, Australian drama 
that gets farther into the inner workings of a child's mind than any 
other film I've ever seen. It is an ideal picture for parents (who just 
might learn something about their children), teenagers (who will nod in 
recognition at its accuracy), and high school and college classes 
studying children.</P>
<P>The film is told exclusively, and never sways, from the central 
character's point-of-view, a seven-year-old girl (Chloe Ferguson) who, 
by choice, has completely stopped vocally talking with her parents, who 
are clearly having marital troubles. Since she does not talk, and yet 
she is the main character, we hear all of her thoughts and feelings at 
any given time. And, we sense, if her parents understood her a little 
better, they would realize that she doesn't need to talk to express 
herself.</P>
<P>"The Quiet Room," with the constant voice-over by the little girl, 
expressing the thoughts in her mind, are constantly so right-on-target, 
that director Rolf de Heer should be applauded for the obvious knowledge 
and maturity that he brings to this emotional story. Admittedly, the 
narration sometimes overstays its welcome in certain scenes, but when 
you think about it, this is completely acceptable. All people, not just 
children, have endless thoughts always floating around in their head, 
and to stop the little girl from expressing herself would be like 
telling her she can't use her mind anymore.</P>
<P>Not enough praise could possibly be given to Chloe Ferguson, as the 
young girl, who, second to three-year-old Victoire Thivisol (1997's, 
"Ponette"), gives the best motion picture performance I can remember 
from someone under ten years of age. You can never catch Ferguson acting 
because she is so very good, and by the film's end, I really was 
beginning to acknowledge her character as a actual person.</P>
<P>If, "The Quiet Room," ever steps wrong, it is in the conclusion, in 
which everything is somewhat solved. It is not that it is necessarily a 
disappointing ending, but I think I probably would have changed the 
penultimate moments to make them feel as accurate as everything that had 
come before.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, "The Quiet Room," is, for once, a serious film on the 
subject of a young child. We do not get many films of this nature, and 
when we do, they more often than not get many of the little details 
wrong. The character of the young girl in this film, on the other hand, 
is so truthful that she really does, in the viewer's mind, at least, 
become a real human being, as if it was a documentary we were watching. 
"The Quiet Room," may be a fictional film, but what it says is not 
"fictional" at all. Children go through the exact same things that this 
young girl goes through, and the points that this film has to make 
speaks volumes about them.</P>
