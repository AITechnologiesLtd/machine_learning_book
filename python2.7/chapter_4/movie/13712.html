<P>Snake Eyes (1998)
Nicolas Cage, Gary Sinise, Kevin Dunn, Carla Gugino, Luis Guzman, John 
Heard, Stan Shaw. Screenplay by David Koepp. Directed by Brian De Palma. 
100 minutes 
Rated R, 2.5 stars (out of five stars)</P>
<P>"Snake Eyes" employs split screens, shots from various characters' points 
of view and a nifty scene where the camera moves overhead to where the 
ceiling should be and glides from room-to-room, providing aerial shots of 
the people below. Oh, and the movie also features a murder mystery. It's 
sad when a director's camera techniques are more memorable than the film 
they should be serving, which is exactly what happens in Brian De Palma's 
latest thriller. </P>
<P>De Palma, who directed such fare as "Carrie," "Dressed To Kill," "Body 
Double," "The Untouchables," "Bonfire of the Vanities" and "Mission 
Impossible," is well-known for his in-your-face approach to storytelling. 
He's also renown (or infamous, depending on who you talk to) for "paying 
homage" to various directors through his filmmaking methods. He certainly 
directs "Snake Eyes" with high style, although he appears to have been so 
busy with flourishes that he neglected to build a solid film beneath them.</P>
<P>The makings for a great thriller are there. Set in an Atlantic City 
casino, where a pay-per-view boxing match has begun while a hurricane 
rages outside, the story centers around the murder of a high-ranking 
government official. As heavyweight champion Lincoln Tyler (Stan Shaw) 
struggles to defend his title, shots ring out in the vast auditorium and 
the Secretary of Defense falls dead to the floor.</P>
<P>Two men take charge of the situation, sleazy local cop Nick Santoro 
(Nicholas Cage) and his best friend since childhood, Major Kevin Dunne 
(Gary Sinise), who was assigned to protect the Secretary. As they seal 
off the huge building to begin their investigation, a terrified young 
woman with blood on her clothing desperately tries to find a way out of 
the casino. The men marshal their forces and the chase is on.</P>
<P>De Palma begins the story with a nod to Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope," using 
camera tricks to make the first few minutes of the film look like one 
extremely long continuous shot. Sure, the effect is striking, but while 
De Palma was occupied creating eye candy, a lot of bad acting slipped 
through the lens of his magic camera.</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage is the worst culprit, hamming it up terribly as the smarmy 
boardwalk cop. Whooping and mugging in the opening scenes like a coked-up 
version of "Ernest Goes To Camp's" Jim Varney, Cage is flat-out 
embarrassing. No one behaving this way would have any credibility as an 
officer, even in Atlantic City. To add insult to injury, we're told this 
boob aspires to the office of mayor. Fat chance, Vern.</P>
<P>>From his first appearance in a open-collared Hawaiian shirt, with gold 
chains floating on his mat of chest hair (actually, Cage's body hair has 
now grown thick enough to officially qualify as a pelt), it's obvious 
that the Oscar-winning actor has decided to turn in a performance that 
makes his work as the villain in "Face/Off" look subtle. To be fair, he 
tones it down as the film progresses, but by then the damage is done. </P>
<P>Meanwhile, Gary Sinise plays yet another fiercely intensive, control-
freak leader. In interviews, the gifted actor says he accepts films like 
"Snake Eyes" to fund his theatrical projects. That's wonderfully candid, 
but doesn't excuse wasting his skills with tiresome stereotypes like this.</P>
<P>Despite Cage and Sinise's failings, the investigation of the murder is 
very intriguing...for a while. De Palma shows the incident from several 
characters' points of view, each adding a little more insight into what 
really happened. He even examines the security camera recordings. It all 
leads to a major revelation that most viewers will have figured out 
minutes earlier.</P>
<P>Particularly annoying is De Palma's decision to reveal the villain 
relatively early in the film. After presenting lead characters who aren't 
likable, then prematurely spilling the beans on the identity of the bad 
guy, it's hard to remain interested in what happens during the remainder 
of the story, even with all of De Palma's inventive camera work. It's 
like watching somebody else put together a picture puzzle. When you're 
not personally involved, viewing the assembly process grows awfully 
tedious.</P>
<P>Adding insult to insult, De Palma wraps the picture up with an 
outrageously bad ending. Reportedly, a huge special effects shot was cut 
from the climax of "Snake Eyes" due to poor reactions from audiences at 
test screenings. It couldn't have been worse than what we see in the 
edited version. After more than an hour and a half of watching the forces 
of good and bad fight it out, De Palma resolves the elaborate battle with 
an act of pure chance. Ending the cat and mouse game with a burst of 
ingenious thinking would have been fine. Closing the story with a triumph 
of the human spirit over adversity would have been acceptable. But pure 
dumb luck? That's a hack ending from a director who should know better. </P>
