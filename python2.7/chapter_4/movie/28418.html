<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>There's slim pickings in this shamelessly contrived melodrama built
around a Wal-Mart setting. All the contrived sitcom scenes just never
click. It's a film about a vulnerable, low-class, and stupid woman, but
a woman who is good-hearted. She fights against all the obstacles placed
in her way and against her own stupidity in decision making. The result
is a predictably boring film which neatly ties up all the loose ends by
its conclusion, whose heart lies where the schmaltz is. The film appears
to be one big advertisement for the giant department store and its
generosity to its trailer park clientele.</P>
<P>Natalie Portman is miscast, as shw was never convincing in her role. She
plays the poor, uneducated, Southern accented, superstitious, pregnant
17-year-old, Novalee Nation, who moves into an Oklahoma Wal-Mart when
abandoned by her wannabe musician, handsome but repulsive boyfriend,
Willie Jack Pickens (Dylan Bruno). After leaving their trailer park home
in Tennessee, he abandons her in the Wal-Mart parking lot before they
reach their California destination. After sleeping in Wal-Mart's for a
few weeks in the sporting section with a sleeping bag on the artificial
garden lawn, she has her baby daughter Americus in the store. Her baby
is delivered by the eccentric, nice guy Forney (Frain), who hears her
screams and breaks a store window to reach her. The man from the
civilized state of Maine unselfishly stopped his college education and
pursuit of a career to be a history teacher in order to take care of his
alcoholic sister, who is the small-town librarian in this cultural
Oklahoma wasteland. He does her job since she's always incapacitated,
and he saves her from going to a sanitarium.</P>
<P>After the baby's birth is celebrated in the media as "the Wal-Mart
Baby," and the mother receives mostly encouraging mail from across the
country, Novalee's sleazy mother (Sally Field) surprisingly appears
after abandoning her 5 years ago (5 is Novalee's unlucky number), but
she soon absconds with the $500 Wal-Mart gave her.</P>
<P>Stuck in this dire situation, good-hearted strangers give her comfort.
There's maternity nurse Lexie (Judd), also an uneducated, loose-living,
single parent, with a number of children (she names them after junk
foods: Baby Ruth, Praline, and Brownie), who becomes her best
girlfriend. There's a recovering alcoholic and born-again Christian,
named Sister Husband (Channing), who takes her and the baby into her
humble mobile home. She will become her surrogate-mother.</P>
<P>After 5 years Novalee becomes a photographer for Wal-Mart, and she soon
fulfills her dream of living in a house without wheels under it. Willie
Jack resurfaces in her life as a legless man, after he tried to become a
country singer under the name Billy Shadow with his career being guided
by a tough Nashville agent (Joan Cusack); but, Willie turns out to be a
hard-luck loser, who because of his stupidity and bad nature continues
to make the same mistakes he always had.</P>
<P>Novalee will almost blow her chance of real love, by thinking she's not
smart enough for Forney. She tells Lexie, "Forney's different than us --
he went to college." But, wouldn't you know it, there's a happy ending,
as Novalee finally makes a smart decision and marries Forney.</P>
<P>This is a film that got itself stuck inside Wal-Mart and could never get
out of aisle 5. Director Williams, he once directed the Roseanne TV
show, uses the material adapted from Billie Letts' best-selling novel to
keep everything as dumb as he can.</P>
