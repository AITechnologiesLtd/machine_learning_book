<P>     Of all the things I might claim to understand about movies, I suspect
that what makes a given film popular with American audiences will never be
one of them.  With that in mind, what makes a film popular with
non-American audiences ranks somewhere with "what is the sound of one hand
clapping" on my personal scale of philosophical inscrutability.  Many is
the film which has come to these shores trumpeted as "one of the most
popular films ever in (fill-in-native-country), and it seems that for
every ONCE WERE WARRIORS (a record-breaker in New Zealand) there is a THE
MYSTERY OF RAMPO (last year's Japanese smash which turned out to be a bit
of psychedelic soft-core porn).  Now comes the German hit MAYBE...MAYBE
NOT ("Die Bewegte Mann" in Europe), a silly and fairly aimless sex farce
which provides a sexy star with very little to do.</P>
<P>     That star is Til Schweiger, who plays a randy waiter-cum-photographer
named Axel Feldheim.  Though he lives with girlfriend Doro (Katja
Riemann), Axel has a tendency to stray, and when Doro catches him in the
act, Axel finds himself out on the street.  His search for a place to stay
brings him to the attention of Waltraud (Rufus Beck), a flamboyant drag
queen who longs to seduce the handsome but hetero Axel.  Axel, however, is
on to Waltraud, and opts to stay with Waltraud's more reserved but just as
gay friend Norbert (Joachim Krol).  As it turns out, Norbert is also just
as interested in Axel, and makes his intentions quite apparent.  Thus
begins a series of misunderstandings in which Axel's attempts to patch up
his relationship with Doro are complicated by her believe that he may not
be cheating on her with women only.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Sonke Wortmann has created an erratic comedy which
swings back and forth from being an airy trifle to half-heartedly
attempting genuine character development.  The opening twenty minutes
promise plenty of broad laughs, from Doro's discovery of Axel and a
lady-friend in a bathroom stall to Waltraud's frantic attempts to look
remove his drag costume so as not to scare off Axel.  Gradually, however,
Wortmann begins trying to generate sympathy for his characters.  Norbert,
whose relationships always seem to be disasters, moons over Axel; Axel
himself experiences the other side of sexual predation in the bathroom of
a gay bar.  It appears as though Wortmann is setting up some lessons for
our two protagonists to learn from each other -- Norbert will learn to
make better romantic choices, and Axel will become a more faithful partner
to Doro.</P>
<P>     Then MAYBE...MAYBE NOT makes a jarring U-turn back to unapologetic,
bawdy slapstick, and throws any pretense at character out the window.
That wouldn't necessarily be a problem, particularly because the character
developments were looking fairly obvious, except that the comic situations
of the last half hour are equally obvious, and not very funny.  In one
scene, Norbert, Waltraud and Norbert's extremely butch lover (Armin Rohde)
are annoyed in a theater by three youths who walk into "A Death in Venice"
believing it's going to be "Rambo;" in another, Axel's tryst with an old
flame (Antonia Lang) becomes another chance for Doro to catch him in an
awkward position.  Wortmann directs it all with a sluggish inevitability,
and takes a final turn back to sentimentality which suggests that he was
just making the whole thing up as he went along.</P>
<P>     The chiseled-cheeked Schweiger has become a superstar in Germany as a
result of this role, and outside of his obvious sex appeal, I can't quite
see why.  He tries to give Axel a boyish charm to counteract his
incomprehensible shifts in personality, but he is the prototype pretty
face with little spark.  Similarly, Joachim Krol's award-winning role
seems remarkably shallow, and shows that America doesn't have a monopoly
on befuddling acting honors.  The problem I had with both roles, and with
MAYBE...MAYBE NOT as a whole, was that there seemed to be no point to any
of it, no growth of character, and some unappealing messages.  Every male
character is perpetually horny, Axel is just as big a jerk when the film
ends as he was when it started, and we are reassured that everything will
be fine because Doro will continue to be a door-mat and forgive Axel's
philandering yet again.  Perhaps it's just a cultural gap I was unable to
cross, but MAYBE...MAYBE NOT struck me as only sporadically amusing, and
sometimes flat-out irritating.  Which is why I will never make my living
deciding what movies get made.</P>
