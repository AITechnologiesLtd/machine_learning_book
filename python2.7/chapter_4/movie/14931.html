<PRE>PRACTICAL MAGIC</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  ** out of ****</PRE>
<P>I so much wanted to like this movie.  I so much wanted to love this movie.
I so much wanted to embrace this movie with both arms and once again be able
to hold my head up high when I say, "I just can't get enough of Sandra
Bullock."  These days, I have a difficult time convincing even myself of this.</P>
<P>Sandra, Sandra, Sandra.  What happened?  You used to be America's
sweetheart, now you can't make a truly good movie to save your life.  With
the possible exception of A TIME TO KILL, the last two and a half years have
not been kind.  If your next one is a critical as well as box office hit, it
will be called your comeback.  No Oscars, no Golden Globes, not even a
stupid Blockbuster Award look near in your future.  Excuse me while I shed a
tear.</P>
<P>It would be easier if I could say that you've just had a run of bad luck,
but I can't.  You've chosen the scripts yourself.  The last two movies were
even co-produced by Fortis Films, your very own production company.  Oh,
woe!  Oh woe!  Such is the man....who longs once more to be a fan!</P>
<PRE>Is that enough emoting?</PRE>
<P>Okay, I'll admit that was a tad melodramatic, but unfortunately, PRACTICAL
MAGIC really is only the latest in a string of mediocre movies for Sandra
Bullock.  This one finds her playing Sally Owens, a witch.  No, a real
witch.  Able to cast spells and all that stuff.  She and her sister, Gillian
(Nicole Kidman) were orphaned at a young age when their mortal father fell
victim to the Owens family curse.  You see, whoever falls in love with an
Owens woman (and they're all witches) is doomed to die.  Their mother died
soon afterwards of a broken heart (oh, please), and the girls are raised by
their aunts, who, besides eat chocolate for breakfast, don't care about
homework, and don't impose a bedtime, also openly practice  witchcraft.
Repulsed by the idea that love could cause such sorrow, Sally wishes for a
man who could never exist, so she could never be so enamored and therefore
never know such pain. Years later, however, Sally falls in love, gets
married, has two darling little daughters, and seems to live the ideal life.
But then, of course, the 'ol curse kicks in and the husband dies in one of
the most predictable surprises in a screenwriter's bag of tricks (if we
could figuratively see the truck coming, he should have seen it literally).
Sally learns that the impetus for her love was not natural, but rather a
spell cast by her aunts to give her that little "push."  Aghast that it was
magic that caused her such misery, she disavows witchcraft and attempts to
lead a normal life.</P>
<P>The scenes in the beginning with Sally and Gillian ("Gillybean," as Sally
insists on calling her throughout the movie) as little girls is kind of
cute, I'll admit, as are the scenes of Sally living the happy, married,
motherly life.  However, this stuff takes up about the first half hour, and
is interspersed with narrative exposition.  Ironically, the filmmakers
wanted to fast forward through adolescence and part of adulthood, but took
so much time doing so that it seems as if we're waiting forever to get on
with the rest of the film.  Not a good start.</P>
<P>The film seems to lose, regain, then lose focus throughout the course of
it's two-hour running time.  I wasn't sure whether the film was supposed to
be about love, about the supernatural, or a combination of the two.  I would
take a stab and say a combination, but it's a pretty poor one, not being
able to effectively intertwine the two motifs.  "Bewitched" was even better
than this.  Is witchcraft and love supposed to go together?  Are they
supposed to exist separately?  Is love a certain witchcraft of its own?
These are the kinds of questions which are alluded to, but never explored
and never answered.  The screenplay by Robin Swicord, Akiva Goldsman and
Adam Brooks seems content to throw things out and then never get around to
tending to them.  At one point, for example, one of the aunts takes money
from a woman desperate to get a man to love her.  The aunt says, "Be careful
what you wish for," and proceeds to cast a spell.  Yes, it's trite, but if
this isn't made into a theme for the movie, why even include the line in the
first place?</P>
<P>Did I go to see a movie, or a two-hour music video?  This was a question I
asked myself somewhere around the halfway mark after seeing the start of
just about every other scene punctuated by an obtrusively loud pop song.
What's worse, the movie includes the obligatory set piece where the
soundtrack is actually a part of the scene.  Oh, you've seen it before.
Think Tom Cruise dancing around in his underwear in RISKY BUSINESS.  Think
Tom Cruise swinging a cue stick around in THE COLOR OF MONEY.  Think Tom
Cruise slinging drinks in COCKTAIL.  Hey, isn't Nicole Kidman married to Tom
Cruise?  Bet they've got a serious stereo in the living room to score their
home life.</P>
<P>For most of the movie, magic is very low-key.  So low-key in fact, that one
wonders if the magic is actually supposed to be real, or just David
Copperfield illusions that the Owens women have learned.  Well, maybe more
like Doug Henning.  About the biggest trick we see is a coffee spoon
stirring by itself.  Oh, wow.  Okay, I guess more like that magician that
goes from table to table at T.G.I. Fridays.  You know, the one you want to
ask, "If I give you a dollar, will you go away?"  Anyway, the magic is so
unimpressive and so seldom in occurrence that you quickly forget that the
word "magic" is actually in the title of the film.  Then something really
big and laden with special effects happens, and it seems totally out of
place because we're so unprepared for it.  Don't even get me started on the
ending, which is resolved with so little explanation that it seems it was
thought up by someone in the last hours of a term paper all-niter who made
his mandatory word count and just wants to finish it up and turn it in.  He
knows he's going to get a D anyway.</P>
<P>There are a couple of things that save this film from the level of drivel.
First is the acting.  For all their differences, Bullock and Kidman actually
have some pretty decent sisterly chemistry.  Aidan Quinn, who appears upon
the scene as Sally's second love interest, is good as usual, and Dianne
Wiest and Stockard Channing are particularly delightful as the Owens aunts.
Secondly, for all its plodding pace and nonsensical scenes, the film manages
to pull off some entertaining moments and give us a few nice visuals.  It's
just too bad they're too few are far between.</P>
<P>As for you, Sandra, please pick some better scripts.  I've promised to wait
for you to come back to the world of the watchable, but a man can only be so
patient.</P>
