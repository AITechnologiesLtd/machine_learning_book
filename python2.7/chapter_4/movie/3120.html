<PRE>                             HEAVENLY CREATURES
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                Copyright 1994 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT 1994</PRE>
<P>     If it were not true, HEAVENLY CREATURES would probably be
considered too unbelievable to be a movie.  Unfortunately, the story is
true.  In New Zealand during the year 1952, two bright, imaginative and
resentful fourteen year-old girls, Pauline and Juliet, became so
obsessed with each other they resorted to murder to stay together.</P>
<P>     New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson skillfully directs this
picture giving us the right balance of surrealism and reality that
allows us to both sympathize with the girls and realize how insane they
are becoming.  The story centers around the intelligent but withdrawn
Pauline Parker (Melanie Lynskey).  When Pauline meets the new kid in
school, Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet), a worldly, upper-class young woman
who does not mind correcting her French teacher's grammar, the two
quickly find that they are soul mates.</P>
<P>     The girls become inseparable, sharing their love for movie stars,
famous singers and for each other.  As their bond increases, so do
their flights of fantasy, including a surreal, imaginary world called
Borovnia.  Borovnia is a medieval kingdom that the girls use to escape
Pauline's mother, Honora, who tries desperately to bring Pauline back
to reality.  Juliet's father, more concerned about his daughter's
apparent lesbianism than her bouts with tuberculosis, also tries to
separate the two.  The idea of separation is too much for the girls to
bear and that is what leads to the film's tragic ending.</P>
<P>     Lynskey and Winslet give powerful performances as does Sarah
Perise who plays Honora.  The film has an "independent" look but
 it is most effective.  Jackson and cinematographer Alun Bollinger make
great use of wide-angle lenses, warm lighting and moving camera to
keep a sense of kinetic surrealism.  The special effects used to create
the world of Borovnia are superb.  One of my favorite effects was the
life-size, clay-people who would dance and sing around the Borovnian
castle.  We see Pauline's psychosis deepen as she begins to imagine
these clay-people outside of Borovnia.  There is even a scene where she
imagines one of them slaying the psychiatrist her parents take her to
see.</P>
<P>     As strange as this all seems, nothing compares to the story's
coda.  Popular British crime-novelist, Anne Perry, recently revealed
that she was in fact Juliet Hulme.  After watching the film, this
reality seems incredibly perverse and ironic.  If any Anne Perry fans
were wondering why their favorite author could write murder so well, it
is because she herself has done it in very, cold blood.</P>
<P>     HEAVENLY CREATURES is a compelling story skillfully told.  Just
one word of advice.  Don't see it if you're depressed or do not wish to
become depressed.  This is a sad, tragic, painful story but it is
another potent illustration of just how dangerous obsession can be.</P>
