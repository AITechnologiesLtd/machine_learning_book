<PRE>                               BODY SHOTS
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Again, Hollywood has taken creative marketing to new heights with
BODY SHOTS.  Judging by the trailers, the ads, even the tagline (`There
are movies that define every decade!'), one would be led to believe that
BODY SHOTS is an incisive drama/comedy about twentysomething
relationships, emphasis on the comedy.</P>
<PRE>     BODY SHOTS is not that movie.</PRE>
<P>     You know it from the start, when a battered Sara (Reid) comes
careening through the streets of L.A., obviously post-rape.  Nothing
starts a movie off quite like a rape aftermath, but in flashback, the
film starts to look up.  The next half hour tells us about the night
before, when four guys and four girls go to a downtown club, all looking
to hook up for the night.</P>
<P>     Some of them do, and some don't.  And one of these entanglements
ends up badly.  At first, Livingston alone provides comic relief as a
semi-lovable loser who shows up in golfing regalia and can't get in the
club.  But on The Day After, BODY SHOTS quickly degenerates into a Movie
of the Week that would play better on Lifetime, with a he said/she said
legal war that is never resolved.</P>
<P>     While BODY SHOTS has its moments, by and large it's a poor entry
into the genre.  Its `clever' photography and self-referential nonsense
gets old, quickly.  The speeches given directly to camera are silly and
unrealistic:  No one acts like this.  Even the title doesn't make
sense.  There are no body shots in the movie.  (The title was recently
changed from the trademark-challenged JELLO SHOTS, and there is no Jello
in the movie, either.)</P>
<P>     Eight Very Beautiful People acting ugly?  Count me out.  Check out
SWINGERS or GO, which are far better treatments of the same theme.</P>
