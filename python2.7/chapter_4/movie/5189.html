<PRE>                                  TWISTER
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<PRE>     This is a review of two films....</PRE>
<P>     The first film is an eye-popping, jaw-dropping action/adventure, a
study of tornadoes and the carnage they create wherever they land.  A story
of two maverick "stormchasers" who try to launch a data-gathering probe
into the heart of one of these twisters and risk life and limb in doing so.</P>
<P>     The second film is a lifeless character drama, a tired old story about
a couple going through a divorce, the man with his prissy wife-to-be, the
woman still pining for their old relationship.  It is also the story of a
second, group of cartoonishly "evil" stormchasers who compete to launch
their own probe into a tornado.</P>
<P>     The first film is fantastic.  The second film is awful.  And they are
both called TWISTER.</P>
<P>     Never before have I experienced a picture that could have been so good
and that had so much going for it, that blew it so badly.  TWISTER's
groundbreaking effects carry it a *long* way.  These include, but are not
limited to, a tractor dealership being sucked into the air, a semi dropped
from the sky, a house rolling across the plains (which is driven through on
its side), flying bovines, and of course, lots of faux tornadoes.  I can't
remember how many times I muttered "Oh my God..." during the screening.
(Thanks go to SPEED director Jan de Bont.)</P>
<P>     I likewise can't remember how many times I started to doze off during
the predictable, shopworn, boring "character development" scenes, *none* of
which are effective.  You'd think that in an hour of development, we'd
learn more about the leads, all of whom can be fully described in 15 words
or less:  Bill (Bill Paxton), leaving the stormchasing world (and his wife)
for more peaceful conditions; Jo (Helen Hunt), Bill's maniacally devoted
wife, driven to near-madness by a tornado trauma as a youth; Melissa (Jami
Gertz), Bill's hollow and uptight girlfriend (and Chicagoan Gertz looks
ridiculous made-up as a Southern belle); and Jonas (Cary Elwes), the
stormchaser who "sold out" by getting (the horror!) a corporate sponsorship
(and Brit Elwes is even more ridiculous as a Southern beau).  There's even
an Aunt Meg (Lois Smith)!  Welcome to Oz, folks.</P>
<P>     The film follows a pattern more predictable than a Tyson fight:  a big
tornado scene, then a boring talking scene, then a big tornado scene, then
talking...and on and on.  After two hours, the tornadoes go away and so
does the talking.  Thank God for the latter.  And fortunately, the action
scenes are much more memorable than the drama scenes, and they serve to
sway this critic into the recommend side of the ratings scale.</P>
<P>     Now you know what you're up against when you see the film, and like
its precursor, JURASSIC PARK, you *should* see it on the big screen, or
else you'll be wasting a video rental.  I think TWISTER might mark the
first time where the only real response the heroes have against the enemy
(the tornadoes) is to run away, and we cheer for them to do so.  It's also
the first time since HIS GIRL FRIDAY that an estranged leading couple were
so obviously perfect for each other.</P>
<P>     And as for tornado-knowledge, this is what I got:  if you're in a
tornado, just hold on to a big metal pole in the ground and everything will
be just fine.  Promise.</P>
<PRE>RATING:  ***1/2</PRE>
