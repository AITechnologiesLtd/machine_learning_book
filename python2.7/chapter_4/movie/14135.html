<P>Rating:  * 1/2 out of * * * *
Directed by:  Mark Christopher
Staring:  Ryan Phillippe, Salma Hayek and Mike Myers</P>
<P>    To sum the entire film "54" up in one sentence, it would be:  Watch a
VH1 documentary instead.  "54", seems like someone brought William Faulkner
into 1978, brought him into Studio 54, got him really drunk, told him to
write about it, and then dumbed that down to be released to the public.</P>
<P>    A sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an
oblivion of the illusion of sex, drugs, and disco.  The narrator, Shane
O'Shae (Ryan Phillippe), works as a grease monkey in New Jersey who, of
course, on a whim decides to go into New York and try to get into Studio
"54".  Phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by
any young, attractive actor with a six pack stomach.</P>
<P>    He is let in by Steve Rubbell (Mike Myers), the infamous co-owner of
Studio 54, because he is attractive.  He eventually becomes a bus boy and
then a bartender . . . you expected more, didn't you.  There isn't.  The
film builds up from nothing and becomes nothing as it's climax (isn't that
an apt word for Studio 54) lands with a thud.</P>
<P>    The glitz of the club and perpetually semi-clothed patrons are used in
an to attempt to show the it's glamour.  For much of its target audience,
college age to early thirties, it attempts to show celebrities mixing with
"normal people."  This even fails since the only two celebs truly introduced
are Andy Warhol and Truman Capote.  You can be sure that half of the
audience hasn't heard of them, another quarter only know their names, and
the other quarter knew they were there already.  The humor, if you can call
it that, is built on an eighty year old woman getting high and 70s
references like John Travolta and Olivia Newton John making us laugh at how
stupid we were back then</P>
<P>    The best performance in the film is given by Mike Myers as the
perpetually high, sexually ambivlaent, very New York Steve Rubell.  He seems
to play Rubell better than Rubell would if he was still alive.  He looks
like Rubell and sounds just like him while giving a subdued, almost
nostalgic performance, when needed.  It reminds you of his Saturday Night
Live character Linda Richmond on "Coffee Talk" sans dress and wig.</P>
<P>    The supporting cast of Salma Hayek, Breckin Meyer, and Neve Cambell are
their only there to give added subplots which are introduced but lead
absolutely nowhere.  The romance between Phillippe and Cambell, as a soap
opera star, is completely implausable.  The two share about half as much
screen time as there are shots of the eighty year old hooked on
amphetimenes.  Hayek's wanna-be singer seems extremely forced and her
husband, Greg (Meyer) stands in as Shane O'Shae's surrogate best friend. 
The subplots seemed forced and seem like they have been added just to make
sure the film was over an hour and a half long.</P>
<P>    Overall, "54" tried to give a view of the brashness of the place where
crack flowed like heroin which flowed like wine.  The film never leads to
anything, has no obserable point, and covers up a lack of real plot with a
veil of beautiful people.  In truth, that reminded me of the eighies.</P>
