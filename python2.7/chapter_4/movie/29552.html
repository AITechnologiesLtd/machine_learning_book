<PRE>NELL (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>If we are to believe a character in NELL, 1994 drama
directed by Michael Apted, everyone has an ulterior motive,
even Mother Theresa. Finding those ulterior motives is
difficult and sometimes impossible, but in the case of those
who made this film it is rather easy - whole purpose of this
endeavour was to bring another Academy Award to its
principal actress Jodie Foster.</P>
<P>The plot of this film, based on the play IDIOGLOSSIA by Mark
Handley, begins in the remote backwoods of North Carolina. A
woman who lived her most of her life in a remote cabin has
died and country doctor Jerome Lovell (played by Liam
Neeson) discovers her daughter Nell (played by Jodie
Foster). Young woman has been taught to hide from the world
and it seems that she has never seen another human being
apart from her mother. Since the mother suffered a
speech-impairing stroke, Nell never learned to speak proper
English and instead developed unintelligible language of her
own. Authorities, represented by psychologist Dr. Paula
Olsen (played by Natasha Richardson), are convinced that
Nell can't function in outside world and that her interests
would be best served if she is institutionalised. Lovell
thinks that she should remain free and manages to delay
court decision for three months. In that period both Lovell
and Olsen must observe Nell in her natural surroundings and
present their findings to the court. Lovell tries to use
this as an opportunity to decipher Nell's language and
finally establish proper communication.</P>
<P>The plot of NELL deals with very intriguing subject - role
of the society and civilisation in forming human mind.
Previously this subject was tackled by such great directors
like Francois Truffaut and Werner Herzog. British director
Michael Apted is not exactly in their league, but his career
indicates that he is capable of making decent film out of
this material. Unfortunately, he was not capable of
compensating the inadequacy of William Nicholson's script.
The script, same as anything else in the film, was subjected
to the single purpose - create as many opportunities as
possible for Jodie Foster to show her ability to portray
socially handicapped character. Because of that, the movie
is stuffed with scenes in which Foster talks gibberish or
lives in her own private world. Naturally, those scenes last
too long and Foster, despite all of her talent, becomes
irritating after a while. The plot that is supposed to wrap
up this character is even worse, filled with all Hollywood
cliches that culminate in the corny and quite predictable
finale. The only thing that makes this film watchable is a
splendid photography by Dante Spinotti that captures natural
beauties of North Carolina. But those lovely sights are
hardly a reason for viewers to spend almost two hours of
their life to watch this single- purpose (and failed)
effort.</P>
