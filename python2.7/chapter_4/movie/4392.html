<PRE>                                    JUMANJI
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     If nothing else, JUMANJI is the most unfortunately titled film of the
year.  And if you haven't turned on your television in the last month you
may still be among the few who don't know what it means.  For the
uninitiated, Jumanji is an ancient board game set in the spooky jungle. 
When the game is played, it causes supernatural things to happen,
including the creation of a horde of monkeys, earthquakes, a monsoon
(indoors), and a stampede through the suburbs of the New England town in
which JUMANJI is set.</P>
<P>     The story begins some 26 years earlier, when young Alan (Robin
Williams) and Sarah (Bonnie Hunt) unearth the game and start playing.  On
Alan's first move, he finds himself sucked into the game as a prisoner,
only to be released when the game is continued in 1995 by Judy (Kirsten
Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Michael Pierce).  Unfortunately, the ill effects
of the game disappear only when it is finished, so the three track down
Sarah, who, after years of therapy, has finally come to grips with the
shock of seeing Alan vanish, and they continue where they left off.</P>
<P>     The rest of the film unfurls the wacky effects the game has on the
players and the town, until the climactic conclusion is reached. 
Unfortunately, along the way, the film fails miserably at building up any
semblance of suspense (it's pretty obvious how this thing is going to
end), and relies on melodrama to try to make us care about the characters,
resulting in a sloppy, over-dramatic plot that doesn't really get going
for half an hour.  Even the precocious kids are basically annoying.  While
much of the film is funny and pleasant to watch, the overall result is a
middling success.</P>
<P>     But you don't go to a movie like this for the gripping plot, and
everyone's question is, "How are the effects?"  Well, they're not so
great.  Compared to the groundbreaking TOY STORY, JUMANJI looks downright
embarrassing.  Few of the computer-generated animals, especially the
plastic-looking monkeys, come across as even remotely realistic, although
the filmmakers really seem to have tried their best.  Apparently, the
technology just isn't ready yet.</P>
<P>     In the end, JUMANJI looks like it wanted to be the next ROGER
RABBIT--a semi-animated film for the whole family.  But in taking things
too seriously, the movie lacks that ingenious, eye-opening "spark" that's
absolutely critical here, and it ends up being another film that's
basically just for kids.</P>
