<PRE>Snow Falling on Cedars</PRE>
<P>The transformation of an intricate novel into a successful film can be
a daunting task. Filmmakers must effectively generate symbolism and
imagery onto the screen, instead of allowing the readers to interpret
it for themselves. That's why people are always saying that a movie
was never as good as the book.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS, directed by Scott Hicks
(SHINE), is a prime example of an unsuccessful interpretation of a
tremendous novel.</P>
<P>Set in 1951 on a fictional island called San Piedro, just north of
Puget Sound, Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), an American-born man of
Japanese descent, is on trial for murder. In this small town, the
Anglo and Japanese-American populations had long lived in relative
harmony until Pearl Harbor dragged half the town's population into
internment camps.  Kazuo was a veteran of the war and served in the US
military, but despite his ranking and valor, he is stigmatized as a
"Jap" and faces long odds in the racially polarized town. Ethan Hawke
(REALITY BITES) plays Ishmael Chambers, the local reporter who may
have evidence crucial to Kazuo's innocence. But Ishmael's past links
him to Kazuo's wife Hatsue Miyamoto (Youki Koudo), whom he loved as a
child in a forbidden romance. As the trial unfolds, and the outcome
doesn't look good for Kazuo, Ishmael must decide to whether or not to
intervene.</P>
<P>What takes pages and pages of complex thought and explanation for
character development in a book seems merely happenstance when
explained in the context of a two-hour film. For example, we know that
Ishmael's character is morally astute, but the movie fails to portray
just how difficult it is for him to help absolve Kazuo from guilt. Why
would he wait when someone's life was hanging in the balance? Another
problem is the film's editing. Attempting to get its arms around a
vast amount of information, it confusingly bounces back and forth from
childhood, to war, to funerals, to internment camp, to weddings, and
so on. This montage blending of past with present appears tries to
chop together a dozen plot elements that don't make sense. Example:
halfway through the film, we learn that Ishmael went to war and lost
his arm. Are we supposed to interpret his indifference toward Kazuo's
fate as revenge for his battle wound that he blames on his lost love
for Miyamoto? I have no idea.</P>
<P>With a large ensemble cast of impressive actors, a lot of the talent
was wasted on roles that were limited because the film was in a
constant time warp. However, Max Von Sydow plays an Oscar-worthy
supporting role as the attorney assigned to defend Kazuo. His demeanor
is grandly stoic as he is faced with a tremendous task.</P>
<P>Do yourself a favor and read the book. In the two hours and five
minutes that it takes to watch the film, you can probably make a
significant dent into the novel, and it'll probably cost the same.
Unless you buy popcorn at the theater, that would make the movie more
expensive.</P>
