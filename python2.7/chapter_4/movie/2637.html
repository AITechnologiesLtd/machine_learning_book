<PRE>"There is something wrong with your cow."
                        - Lovitz to Crystal, on Norman The Cow</PRE>
<P>     Blame Francis Ford Coppola.  If his GODFATHER II hadn't been so
gosh-darned good, the American moviegoing public may have never known
the ill-effects of terminal sequelitis (JAWS 2, ARTHUR 2, ROBOCOP
2 ... shudder).  Of course, then we wouldn't get to see Jon Lovitz
recite Fredo's dialogue in CITY SLICKERS 2: THE LEGEND OF CURLY'S
GOLD.</P>
<P>     Lovitz replaces Bruno Kirby as obligatory third-wheel to Billy
Crystal and Daniel Stern, those cow-pokin' city folk who tamed the
not-so-wild-west in the smash 1991 original.  One year has passed (in
movie time) and Mitch (Crystal) is haunted by the fear that he may have
buried Curly (Palance) alive.  Remember Curly, the grizzled trail-boss
who knew one thing?</P>
<P>     Guilt gives way to gold-fever, though, when Mitch find a map to
buried treasure inside Curly's old hat.  Before you can say "Walter
Huston," the boys--Crystal, Stern, and Lovitz, as Mitch's
ne'er-do-anything brother--are saddled up and ready for another ride.
Whereupon they run into everything from rattlesnakes to Curly's twin
brother Duke. (Those are different?)</P>
<P>     THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE it ain't, but, to use the best
excuse in "the business," hey, it's a sequel.</P>
<P>     Watching CITY SLICKERS 2 is like, er, watching CITY SLICKERS 1.
Once again, Billy Crystal bee-bops around a less-than-thrilled Jack
Palance.  Once again, a serious theme is weighing on the conscience of
the characters.  Once again, rousing music meets vibrant vistas.
SSDM.</P>
<P>     The trouble is that the original wasn't *that* great of a film to
begin with.  CITY SLICKERS was overlong and--surprise!--so is the
sequel.</P>
<P>     For about eighty minutes, CURLY'S GOLD is the sequel it should
be.  The gags are fresh, the situations are new, and Lovitz even nails
a couple zingers on the head.  But once out west, the film begins to
make the same mistakes as the original.  Mistake #1: the jokes stop
coming.  Mistake #2: the men start bonding.  The whole thing wraps with
great plot twist that's too little, too late.</P>
<P>     Though the handsome production values are certainly worth noting,
the cast is the selling point and, this time, they're a surprisingly
mixed bag.</P>
<P>     Freed of his character's middle-aged angst, Crystal is a
chatterbox of commentary.  He's not quite grating, but close.  Lovitz
doesn't have more than a handful of lines and the deficency shows.
(Heck, he was funnier in 1993 an Oscar presenter!) Neither actor acts
as goofy as Stern, the strongest and most believable of the three.
Jack Palance doesn't show until the hour mark and, of course, steals
every scene he's in.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:    Watching CITY SLICKERS II: THE LEGEND OF CURLY'S GOLD is
                like watching the original: fun for a while, but tedious
                toward the end.</PRE>
