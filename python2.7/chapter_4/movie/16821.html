        Le Violon rouge
        Die Rote Geige
        Il Violino rosso
        The Red Violin
                        (1998)</PRE>
<P>The Red Violin is the story of a journey across centuries and
continents, with the intrument as traveller, and as the catalyst of the
human lives it strings together. As a movie, it is uneven but entirely
worthwhile. I did not enjoy the segments set in Vienna and Oxford much:
they didn't appeal to me. However, the ones set in China, Italy and
Canada did sustain my interest. Here, production values and direction
are enough, in my opinion, to allow the audience to turn a shortsighted
critical eye over this movie's faults. Bravo to Niv Fichman and François
Girard.</P>
<P>While the violin itself is unarguably the movie's central character, the
matter of protagonists is manifold. Samuel L. Jackson gets top billing,
and I estimate that he also gets the most screen time, but he is a great
actor and he fills his segment with a sense of purpose that perfectly
espouses the narrative. The other protagonists in each segment act in
reaction to circumstances and emotional shocks, the actors' performances
are strong, but the movie's momentum lulls; the violin has no will of
its own, despite its mystique. If it had, the film would have achieved
its desired epic scope. The Red Violin is beautiful, certain to pluck
heartstrings, and moving; but it's also a cripple. Listen to the music:
that's as far as it will go.</P>
<P>It's a cathartic but unchallenging drama. See it. Listen carefully.</P>
<P>__THE RED VIOLIN directed by François Girard stars Samuel L. Jackson
and was co-written by Don McKellar and François Girard, who have often
expressed their eternal gratitude toward their translators__</P>
