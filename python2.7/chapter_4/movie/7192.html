<PRE>                                THE DEVIL'S OWN
                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     The advance word on THE DEVIL'S OWN was, to put it mildly, not=20
good.  About a month ago, Brad Pitt went public with some extremely=20
damaging statements about how, if he hadn't possessed an iron-clad=20
contract, he would have bailed out on the production long before its=20
finish.  Then there's the fact that Columbia Pictures delayed the=20
opening from late last year (during pre-Oscar nomination prime time) to=20
the dreary wasteland of March, supposedly as a result of awful preview=20
screenings.  With these bits of knowledge spinning in my head, I was=20
ready for a disaster.  But, while THE DEVIL'S OWN isn't going to win any=20
"best of=85" contests, it's not nearly as bad as I had been led to=20
believe.</P>
<P>     Oh, there are problems, and some of them are fairly serious.  But=20
the movie as a whole isn't a complete and utter waste of time.  I didn't=20
leave the theater wringing my hands about having lost an evening.  Part=20
of the reason THE DEVIL'S OWN is endurable is because, in spite of=20
various script deficiencies, both of the stars -- Pitt and Harrison Ford=20
-- have an undeniable screen presence.  And, while star power can't save=20
a sinking movie, it can at least keep it afloat longer.</P>
<P>     THE DEVIL'S OWN begins in a rousing enough fashion, with a short=20
prologue set in 1972, then a flash-forward twenty years to a police=20
action in Belfast.  Frankie Maguire (Brad Pitt), a member of the=20
provisional IRA with more than 18 murders to his credit, is a wanted=20
man.  When the British army, aided by the local police, corner him in a=20
warehouse, he and his compatriots fight back, and the result is a=20
bloodbath.  Frankie escapes to the U.S. with the assignment to buy=20
stinger missiles from an arms dealer (Treat Williams) and bring them=20
back by boat to Ireland. =20</P>
<P>     Frankie's "host" in the United States is IRA sympathizer Peter=20
Fitzsimmons (George Hearn), who sets him up with a bed and bathroom in=20
the suburban house of NYPD officer Tom O'Meara (Harrison Ford).  Tom is=20
a prototypical "good cop" -- he doesn't lie, cheat, steal, or take=20
bribes, and puts the love of his wife (Margaret Colin) and children=20
above all else.  He and Frankie, who's now going by the alias of Rory=20
Devaney, become friends.  Of course, Tom doesn't know about Frankie's=20
terrorist background.  In fact, he doesn't suspect that there's anything=20
sinister about his guest until a group of armed, masked men break into=20
his house and threaten to kill his wife.</P>
<P>     For much of its running length, THE DEVIL'S OWN works as a passable=20
thriller.  Certain plot elements (including many of the details=20
surrounding the missile deal) border on preposterous, but that often=20
goes with the territory in films of this genre.  The best parts of THE=20
DEVIL'S OWN are the quiet moments, such as when Frankie and Tom are=20
talking, or when Tom is spending time with his family.  There's also an=20
effective subplot that forces Tom to examine his moral outlook on life=20
when his partner (Ruben Blades) accidentally shoots a fleeing suspect in=20
the back. =20</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, THE DEVIL'S OWN goes downhill fast in the final half=20
hour.  Suddenly, it's as if every significant character in the film has=20
undergone a frontal lobotomy.  Otherwise-intelligent men start doing=20
extremely stupid things, and the entire "dumbing-down" process becomes=20
frustrating to observe.  The final scenes are solid, but the stuff that=20
leads up to them is a problem.</P>
<P>     As is always the case in a film featuring the IRA, murky Irish=20
politics are addressed, although veteran director Alan J. Pakula (ALL=20
THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, PRESUMED INNOCENT) does his utmost to make THE=20
DEVIL'S OWN approach these thorny issues in a non-judgmental, evenhanded=20
fashion by depicting good and evil on both sides.  The most interesting=20
facet of the political side of the script is how Irish views are easily=20
distorted in America, an ocean away from the strife and violence.  It's=20
easy to classify oneself as a "patriot" when all that's on the line are=20
a few dollars.</P>
<P>     Pitt and Ford do credible jobs as Frankie and Tom.  Despite his=20
character's brutal, bloody past, Pitt manages to capture our sympathy,=20
in large part because, aside from the killings, Frankie seems like a=20
likable sort of guy.  Ford, in a role that's a far cry from the cocky=20
Han Solo, recalls Jack Ryan, the protagonist of PATRIOT GAMES and CLEAR=20
AND PRESENT DANGER -- a hero whose armor is just a little too shiny. =20
Supporting players include Margaret Colin (INDEPENDENCE DAY) as Tom's=20
wife, Natascha McElhone (SURVIVING PICASSO) as Frankie's girlfriend, and=20
a nasty Treat Williams as a gunrunner in a suit. =20</P>
<P>     While THE DEVIL'S OWN doesn't do a spectacular job of fulfilling=20
the promise of its cast or its complex politics-and-guns premise, it is=20
nevertheless reasonably well-paced.  The less intently you watch this=20
movie, the greater the chance that you'll be pleased by it. =20
Unfortunately, if you're paying attention, it won't take long to notice=20
that very little of the last act holds together.  That sort of high-
tension, mind-numbing climax makes it difficult for me to retain more=20
than token enthusiasm for the production as a whole.</P>
