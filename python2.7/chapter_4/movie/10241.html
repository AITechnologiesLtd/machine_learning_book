<P>Certain films are transcendent -- such a film is Francis Ford Coppola's The
Godfather, his 1972 masterpiece about life in the mafia, and the characters
who inhabit that life. Central to this portrait, is Michael Corleone (Al
Pacino). As the film opens, he is a war hero, a nice kid -- despite the
fact that his father, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), is head of a
powerful mafia ring, he doesn't want to get mixed up in the family
buisness. In the first shot, black fades to a close view of a face; in the
last, a close view of a face, fades to black. What comes inbetween is like
poetry commited to the screen. It isn't so much a tale of crime, as a tale
of family, and an intamate study of power. The way in which the director
and actors collaborate is magical -- you see the mark of Vito, on the face
of Fredo (John Cazale), Sonny (James Caan), and Michael. You understand the
ties that bind -- loyalty, trust, love. Coppola knows when to cut away, and
how to keep the story moving. This film runs just below a full three hours,
but absorbs us so completely, that never once does it need to pause for
breath. Every time I see it, I become more and more absorbed -- in my last
viewing I actually saw Michael go through all his subtle phases. He moves
beyond his original dreams, when he bends over his father and whispers "I'm
with you now, pop". The way in which you sympathise with the various
characters is almost frightening. When they aren't out strangling one
another, and dealing in dope, they're nice people. When Jack Woltz (John
Marley), the big-shot movie producer, wakes up in bed with the head of a
horse, we move outside and view the building with the muffled sounds coming
from within, and then to Vito,  raising an eyebrow, half in suprise, half
in enjoyment. The Godfather has a level of charm, flash, dazzle, all
suggesting pure American trash. But strip away these feelings, and you will
discover the underlying profundity. With repeated  viewing, you see more
and more of the irony -- Michael is offended that Moe Green (Richard
Conte), would even slap around his brother Fredo in public. But in
companionship with Part II, we see such a strange view of this moment.
Through its superb mix of comedy, tragedy, and all inward feelings, comes a
masterpiece that deepens with reflection, rewatching, and rethinking.</P>
