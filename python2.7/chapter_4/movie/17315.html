<P>VIRUS
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ** (out of ****)
Universal / 1:32 / 1999 / R (language, violence, gore)
Cast: Jamie Lee Curtis; William Baldwin; Donald Sutherland; Joanna 
Pacula; Marshall Bell; Julio Oscar Mechoso; Sherman Augustus; Cliff 
Curtis 
Director: John Bruno 
Screenplay: Chuck Pfarrer; Dennis Feldman <HR>The virus in "Virus" would cause Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's 
computer-dependent "You've Got Mail" couple to run screaming from their 
PCs - assuming, of course, it didn't hack them to pieces first. 
Obviously, this baby is no ordinary system bug, capable of much worse 
than crashing a hard drive or deleting important files. It's sort of an 
energized extraterrestrial entity accidentally beamed down from the Mir 
space station to a Russian science vessel resting in international 
waters, and there, it takes control of the ship's electronics, 
slaughters those onboard and begins to build itself an army of cyborgs 
out of spare human and mechanical parts. </P>
<P>Given the set-up, "Virus" sounds like yet another "Aliens" rip-off with 
a germ of an interesting idea thrown in for good measure. But what's an 
"Aliens" rip-off without a rag-tag team of assorted grunts and 
mercenaries to stop by this floating haunted house to infiltrate and 
investigate? "Virus"' comes in the form of high-seas scavengers who have 
just lost the barge they were tugging back to a presumable net gain. 
When the Irish cap'n (hammy Donald Sutherland, sounding like he got his 
accent inside a Lucky Charms box) and his motley crew spy the 
evil-infested boat, it's salvage salvation. Silly mortals. </P>
<P>Starting here, the movie adheres to strict genre predictability. A lone 
survivor (Polish actress Joanna Pacula, very good here) is discovered 
and provides requisite plot exposition. People venture into dark 
corridors armed only with flashlights and never return. Sutherland's 
navigator, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, gets her Sigourney Weaver mojo 
workin' and guides the good guys in an attempt to kick interplanetary 
butt. Cast members get killed off in reverse credits order. It's a good 
thing director John Bruno is a skilled special effects craftsman, 
because "Virus"' technical terrors offer eye-popping amusement even when 
the story takes frequent naps from creativity. </P>
<P>Like its own creepy creatures, "Virus" ends up cobbled together out of 
bits and pieces from similarly-themed fright flicks. In some respects, 
it almost plays like a remake of last January's awful "Deep Rising," but 
this movie is better than that one because a formless mass of 
otherworldly intelligence is a more compelling adversary - and story 
concept - than some anonymous sea monster that suddenly surfaces from 
the ocean's briny bowels. Curtis is also a fun heroine to have on your 
side (especially when she's in "Halloween" go-girl mode) but the manner 
in which she finally books it to safety is best described as 
plot-convenient. </P>
<P>The likeable William Baldwin tags along as a swarthy engineer and 
Curtis' leading man, but there's no time for romance; their sole 
intention is survival. But what about the film's intentions? If you 
crave science-fiction, don't mind story holes, logic lapses and genre 
copy-catting and have 90 minutes to burn - the movie is pretty 
well-paced despite its ultimately squandered potential - then this 
"Virus" is worth catching. Everyone else, however, is better off staying 
in bed, drinking lots of fluids and popping some antibiotics.<HR>© 1999 Jamie Peck
