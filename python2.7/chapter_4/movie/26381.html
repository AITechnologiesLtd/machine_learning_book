<P>After a rather disappointing "Mary Railly", Stephen Frears is now
officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise. This is
one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet, small budget
comedy with a big heart. In fact it's not even a comedy. It's a drama
or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and
needs. Based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by British author
Nick Hornby, ``High Fidelity'' is a wry and likable story about a
man's quest for fulfillment and happiness.</P>
<P>Rob Gordon was a DJ. It seems that he could make everything spin --
except his own life. Now he owns Championship Vinyl, a little musical
store, somewhere in New York. When he suddenly gets dumped by his
girlfriend, a gorgeous blond attorney, life suddenly looses every
purpose. Decimated, humiliated and on the verge of a mental (and
emotional) breakdown, he starts meditating over his life and the way
it could have been -- about what's right and what's important. He
starts "categorizing" life, dividing it into "top 5 lists". And the
most important is the "top 5 list" over the most painful breakups of
his life, starting with 5th grade, when he found his young girlfriend
with another boy. Though you might think that people change, grow more
mature with age, it just doesn't seem that way and all Rob's
relationships were different versions of that first. Where did he go
wrong? Was it he that screwed up? Or maybe life just stinks? While he
is lost in his own self-pity, he must think of the "top 5 list" over
his needs for the future, find the right elements and mix his life
together.</P>
<P>With clever parallels to the cult of celebrity, music and with
incredibly direct narration, it addresses the average audience member,
in other words -- people like you and me. Although a lot of this honor
should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and Frears, the
director, the acting is equally important as the written word. And
here John Cusack should absolutely be mentioned. He is simply
superb. It is as much his movie as it is Frears'. The film would not
be the same without him. Cusack -- whose character is sadder, wiser
and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony. Most of
his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task
-- but Cusack pulls it off. His interpretation feels so emotionally
right, so incredibly realistic and precise that Frears' message simply
can't be ignored or overseen. The other members of the cast do an
equally remarkable job. Both ______ and Jack Black are fabulous. Even
Catherine Zeta Jones appears in a role where she actually acts, not
just looks beautiful. However, the most unexpected pleasant surprises
is provided by Todd Louiso who delivers a spectacular comic
performance as Rob's co-worker and friend Dick. This is such an
impressive achievement that it's almost worth a Oscar-nomination. He
is simply a joy to behold. Otherwise, everyone are in their place, and
at the right time -- all part of Frears' colorful blend.</P>
<P>Pretty much like Edward Norton's "Keeping the Faith" , this film
doesn't follow any formula or belong to any genre -- it's dramatic,
tragic, sarcastic, comic and even cynical, but never bitter or
angry. It's a little bit of everything, pretty much like life
itself. Nothing seems unreal or staged. It reflects reality as a
mirror. As you watch it, you go through the same emotional problems as
the main character. You feel and think and reflect. This effect has
become a rarity nowadays.</P>
<P>Although it's primarily about the perils of love, ``High Fidelity'' is
secondarily about pop music. Rob owns Championship Vinyl and his
employees, timid Dick (Todd Louiso) and overbearing Barry (Jack
Black), are fellow music snobs. Music is the language in their lives,
the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant
events of their lives. And so does the movie. It is as much a musical
film as anything else, as Rob's journey is wonderfully portrayed
through carefully inserted musical fragments.</P>
<P>In the end, you have gained something while watching it. It's not the
film of the century or even of the year. It's not an special effects
extravaganza. It doesn't require big explosions or digital creatures
to succeed. It's a small movie about the big things. And even though
it does not contain heavy philosophy, you feel as if you have
experienced something of significance, and you will experience that
nice warm feeling for quite some time.</P>
