<P>At first glance, "Cast Away," directed by Robert Zemeckis (2000's "What Lies 
Beneath"), may appear to be a feature film version of TV's "Survivor," where 
a man stranded on an island must learn to fend for himself in order to stay 
alive. Zemeckis and screenwriter William Broyles, Jr. could very well have 
made such a movie and come up with a first-rate adventure-thriller, along the 
lines of 1988's "A Cry in the Wild." Instead, their purpose is exposed to be 
something else entirely, and the title hints at this ambitious aim. Instead 
of being about a castaway, the picture is about a man very much dependent on 
today's technology to help him live his life, who, through circumstances out 
of his hands, is cast away from society, and must start his life anew. </P>
<P>In, perhaps, a career-best performance in a very long line of successes, Tom 
Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a loyal Federal Express executive who devotes 
much of his time trying to make the company as good as it can be. Following a 
short Christmas reunion with his sweetheart, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), he is 
paged to return to work, although not before handing her a small, wrapped 
present that both parties know is an engagement ring. While traveling across 
the Pacific, Chuck's plane runs into severe turbulence due to a nasty storm 
and it ultimately crashes. Narrowly escaping with an inflatable raft in hand 
and a treasured locket with a picture of Kelly inside that she gave to him 
before he shoved off, Chuck eventually finds himself washed ashore on a 
desolate island devoid of any other human life.</P>
<P>For its middle 75 minutes, "Cast Away" is a hugely involving and fascinating 
look at the way Chuck deals with being cut off from all people and everyday 
conveniences, as he is forced to learn how to survive with very few 
resources. With a wealth of coconuts surrounding him, Chuck's diet becomes 
solely dependent on the fruit until he learns to start a fire from the 
friction of sticks and eventually work his way up to crabs and fish. And 
thanks to a bunch of Fed Ex packages that drifted to shore, Chuck gains 
access to a few limited articles of clothing, ice skates whose sharp blades 
come in handy, and a volleyball that becomes his only friend and a personal 
salvation on the island, going as far as painting a face on one side using 
his own blood from a wound.</P>
<P>It's no secret from the television ads and theatrical trailer that Chuck 
does, indeed, make it back to civilization. While more suspense might have 
surrounded such a question had it not been so blatantly given away, such a 
decision holds absolutely no bearing on the success or overall impact of the 
film. In a way, it is a positive thing, as it directs the viewer's attention 
away from a possibly unknown outcome, and toward the deeper meanings behind 
the picture's existence. The final 30 minutes, with Chuck now back home 
following a four-year disappearance that led everyone to believe he was dead 
(and going as far as holding a funeral for him), is just about as powerful 
and truthful of a denouement as could possibly be expected.</P>
<P>"Cast Away" is a cinematic triumph, a motion picture so rich with honest 
emotions and ideas that it comes as a relative surprise that this is a 
big-budget, star vehicle. Rarely does Hollywood prove that it is still 
capable of making intelligent, adult fare, so when such a stirring feat 
occurs, it is all the more reason to rejoice. The movie is thoroughly 
entertaining for the entirety of its nearly 2 1/2-hour running time, and it 
is effective on every level--both as a character study, and an accurately 
drawn adventure yarn.</P>
<P>Appearing in every scene (save for a 3-minute prologue that delves into the 
lives of Fed Ex workers across the globe), Tom Hanks (1999's "The Green 
Mile") is astounding. Highly publicized for the unorthodox way in which 
Zemeckis made the film, taking nearly a year off in between in order for 
Hanks to drop 60 lbs., it is a testament to Hanks' loyalty to his craft to go 
through such a rigorous process. Impressing even more greatly than his 
physical appearance is his performance, deeply charged with serious emotions 
and subtly dodging any signs of saccharine drama. With the majority of the 
picture literally a one-man show (and with this sizable middle chunk also 
devoid of music and very little dialogue), Hanks is able to single-handedly 
take hold of the screen and keep the viewer with him at all times. Very few 
actors could ever spend 75 minutes alone onscreen and remain captivating, but 
Hanks does just that.</P>
<P>In her fourth film appearance in the last three months (with the other three 
being in "Dr. T and the Women," "Pay It Forward," and "What Women Want"), 
Helen Hunt is perfectly cast as the love of Chuck's life, Kelly. While, no 
doubt, the smallest role Hunt has had this year, it is also her strongest 
performance. Not only is it easy to see why Chuck loves Kelly so very much, 
and why she is one of the reasons he hangs onto the hope of seeing her again 
one day, but Hunt injects the part with a level of compassion and 
heartbreaking pathos that is truly unforgettable.</P>
<P>An allegory on the importance most people place on material items, and the 
extreme impact being cut off from such things can have on someone, "Cast 
Away" is the exquisite, thought-provoking journey of a man who ultimately 
must find a way to put his life back together when everything he had 
previously known changes in the four years he is gone. And even more, it is 
an unforgettable love story between two smart, likable people who know they 
were meant for each other--and keep that fact between them, even when they 
realistically know nothing can ever be the same again. With 2000 quickly 
reaching a close, "Cast Away" is easily one of the very best films of the 
year.</P>
