<P> Reviewed by Harvey Karten
 Pathe Television/La Sept ARTE
 Director: Claire Denis
 Writer:   Claire Denis, Jean Pol Fargeau, inspired by Herman
Melville's "Billy Budd"
 Cast: Gregoire Colin, Denis Lavant, Michel Subor</P>
<P>   If you want to strip human beings to their essence, situate
your movie in the desert, an area with virtually no civilian
conveniences, and assemble your cast of characters in a
closed space from which they cannot escape.  You'll get your
emotions raw: you'll find out what people are made of.  The
friendly feelings will surface, especially during card games, at
the lone dance hall, and especially in the quiet moments
when you're sharing a restful activity with your compatriots
such as ironing your clothes.  But the demons are bound to
come out, the imps of envy and hatred the most likely
candidates for surfacing.</P>
<P>   This probably accounts for Claire Denis's situating her
tense, incredibly spare 90 minute piece in a remote outpost
of the French Foreign Legion in the little nation of Djibouti on
Africa's Red Sea.  The local inhabitants of the area, largely
Muslim women who show up weekly at the dance floor to
exhibit their supple bodies with gyrating rhythms at the social
hall accompanied by the French men who rotate and revolve
respectably in close proximity.  </P>
<P>   "Beau Travail" has little dialogue and is largely narrated
from the point of view of the leader of the small group of
legionnaires, Sgt. Galoup (Denis Lavant).  Galoup has the
men's affection and loyalty and commands discipline from
this vigorous group who are under the overall command of a
philosophic older man, Bruno Forestier (Michel Subor). 
Director Denis puts the fellows through their weekly paces,
seeing the routine lives of these men guarding their remote
outpost with such macho intensity that you're surprised to
discover that the helmer is a woman.  In one of the most
physical of films, these actors--not stunt men, mind you, but
performers--actually run under a series of barbed wire fences,
climb over hurdles, jump into pits and climb out in the blink of
an eye, do pushups in all varieties including medium-downs
and bouncing on their palms, and practice disarming
attackers with knives.  There's even a strange exercise that
has the men hugging one another and separating, hugging
and separating, and performing amphibian workouts with
guns in tow.  When their bodies are not in frantic motion, they
are ironing their pants, putting perfect creases in their
trousers to symbolize their elegance, and at least one pair of
fellows can play a mean game of chess.</P>
<P>   The conflict arises when Sgt. Lavant becomes increasingly
envious of one of the guys, Gilles Sentain, a tall, well-built,
handsome recruit who is admired by the men and who, in
one instance, becomes a hero when he rescues a flier from a
downed chopper.  Determined to make life miserable for him,
the sergeant contrives a plan that he hopes will lead to the
legionnaire's death.</P>
<P>   The movie is inspired by Herman Melville's "Billy Budd,"
which every junior high kid in America must have had to read
at one time.  "Billy Budd" was about a midshipman who was
a stabilizing influence on the rough crew of a merchant ship. 
When he is taken aboard the "Indomitable," he is popular with
all the officers and crew except John Claggart, the master-at-
arms, who is envious of Billy's almost perfect physique and
personality. But whereas Melville's story was about an
innocent youth trapped in the brutality of fleet regulations or,
perhaps, one who represents truth and beauty trapped by the
wickedness of the world, the crew in which Sentain finds
himself is a well-behaved troupe that needed no particular
stabilizing, making the viewer wonder exactly why the
sergeant hated him so much. Sentain is not overwhelmingly
worshipped by the men, who give their allegiance freely to
the sergeant, and therefore Galoup's behavior is tough to
accept.</P>
<P>   The story takes a back seat, however, to the poetry of the
filmmaking.  "Beau Travail" makes its points with minimal use
of dialogue, allowing the images to convey the Spartan nature
of life in such a remote region, a man's world, and nicely
juxtaposes the scenes of the local women exhibiting their
body moves with the more aggressive and testosterone-
enkindled mobility of the men.</P>
<PRE>Not Rated.  Running Time: 90 minutes.  (C) 1999
