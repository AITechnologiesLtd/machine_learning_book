<PRE>The Review</PRE>
<P>    Two low-key summer horror films have become surprise financial
successes this year: The Blair Witch Project and The Sixth Sense. Each
has made well over $100 million in North America, based on a combination
of strong word of mouth and clever advertising. If a film's box office
take were based primarily on its quality, Stir Of Echoes would join
Blair and Sense in grossing far more money than expected, for it is as
scary, if not scarier than the other two. Writer/director David Koepp
has given Artisan Entertainment, the folks who distributed Blair Witch a
second creepy hit.</P>
<P>    The story gets going after Tom Witzky (Bacon), an average
blue-collar dad, gets hypnotized by his wife Maggie's (Erbe) sister Lisa
(Douglas) at a party. While the hypnosis goes as expected to the
party-goers, it triggers something in Tom's head. Things begin to change
around him (blinking red lights let off a strange hum, for example), and
he fights to stay in control of his own senses. Where these experiences
take Tom, Maggie and their son Jake (Cope), who Tom thinks might have
some answers, is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you.</P>
<P>    David Koepp keeps the action localized; the majority of the action
takes place at Tom's house or just down the street. By keeping things at
home, Koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy
segues (montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to
another etc.). Unfortunately, the dread and spookiness of Stir Of Echoes
are frequently interrupted by moments of levity. Humour can take the
tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor
acting. Several tense moments become completely diffused by a few
misplaced jokes. Also, there are a couple of plot developments that are
left unresolved, though to mention them would be to give too much away.</P>
<P>    Kevin Bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and a man
losing his sanity admirably. His total lack of understanding of what is
happening to him is believable, as are the reactions from his wife
Maggie. Kathryn Erbe is given a role meatier and better written than
that of most "wife who can no longer handle her husband" parts. While it
is still a supporting role, her Maggie is moving as she watches both her
husband and her son enter what she calls "a private club that I'm not
invited to", where they whisper about things all day long. As Jake,
Zachary Cope equals the performance of Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth
Sense, but gets less screen time. Both children manage the same trick,
making the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way
things are.</P>
<P>    Fans of Blair and Sixth Sense will almost surely love Stir Of
Echoes. It combines the dread of Blair, a creepy closed-in feel thanks
to cinematographer Fred Murphy and great performances by the whole cast,
specifically Bacon, to give the fall its first genuine scary film. If
only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot a
bit more, this could have been one of the year's best.</P>
