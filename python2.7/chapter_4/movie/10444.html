<P>   Some of the fine movies of recent times feature food as the
central character: "Babette's Feast," "The Big Night," "A Chef
in Love."  But never before has a single dish, a small dessert
item, figured so prominently that the entire story would not
have taken place without it.  In "Oscar and Lucinda," two
maids in the employ of Oscar Hopkins's father calls the teen-
aged boy into the kitchen and offer a taste of their delicious
Christmas pudding.  Oscar tries a piece and he's in heaven. 
As he's about to spoon up another morsel, the door swings
open: in comes his fanatically puritanical, Pentecostal dad,
who throws the pudding and its plate into the fireplace, slaps
the boy on the ear, and gives hell to the maids for offering 
pleasurable provender.  The severe, bearded man belongs to
a faith--much like the Danes in "Babette's Feast" who dine
daily on gruel--that eschews physical pleasure, suggesting
that the dessert was produced by Satan, and certainly not the
appropriate way to honor God on Christmas day.  While
Oscar has become too filled with the importance of faith and
salvation to turn agnostic, he begins to question his dad's
values and, believing he has received a message from God
(who talks to him while he tosses a disk at some symbols on
the ground), he decides to leave home and sign on to the
Anglican faith.  Shortly thereafter he becomes a reverend.</P>
<P>   "Oscar and Lucinda" leaves out much of the
characterization advanced in the novel by Peter Carey, such
as the fleshed-out portrait of the man who narrates the story
and who is Oscar's grandson.  But it more than makes up for
the exclusion with perhaps the most gorgeous photography of
any film of 1997, "Kundun" not excepted.  Portraying an
Australia circa 1850 during the reign of Britain's Queen
Victoria and the publication of Charles Darwin's "Origin of
Species," Gillian Armstrong's leisurely look at God, gambling,
gamboling and glass is the sort of film with which a modern
American audience can scarcely find universal meaning or
even to identify too closely with any of its characters.  Yet
"Oscar and Lucinda" is a haunting meditation on mores and
folkways of a bygone, romanticized era in the history of the
British Empire which pulls no punches in denouncing the
white man's rape of land settled by Downunder aborigines. 
Idiosyncratic as all-get-out, Armstrong's reliable adaptation of
the Booker-prize winning book compels our attention with its
consideration of repressed sexuality, the conflict between
earthly pleasures and the contemplation of the heavens, and
the singular pairing-up of two square pegs in a society of
round holes.</P>
<P>   Featuring conscientious performances by the protean
Ralph Fiennes and upcoming actress Cate Blanchette (soon
to appear in a movie about Elizabeth I), "Oscar and Lucinda"
centers on a shy, overly obedient red-haired boy, Oscar
Hopkins (Ralph Fiennes) who separates himself from his
father's household when the latter's religion proved a mite too
fanatical for the adolescent to tolerate.  Becoming an Anglican
minister, he develops a compulsion to gamble on anything
from cards to animals, rationalizing his behavior as a way to
add to the coffers to the poor, and, on a more metaphysical
level, as a religious experience in itself.  As he relates to the
equally eccentric heiress, Lucinda Leplastrier (Cate
Blanchett), a liberated woman who dresses in slacks like a
man and runs a glass-making factory, "Our whole faith is a
wager, Miss Leplastrier. We bet--it is all in Pascal and very
wise it is too, that there is a God. We bet our life on it.  We
calculate the odds, the return, that we shall sit with the saints
in paradise.  Our anxiety about our bet will wake us before
dawn in a cold sweat.  We are out of bed and on our knees,
even in the midst of winger.  And God sees us, and sees us
suffer."  The two play cards with more passion than most
people feel when they make love.  In one reckless moment,
Cate bets her entire inheritance against Oscar's future legacy
that he cannot transport a glass church which she has built to
a remote location in Northern Australia by Good Friday, where
he is to turn the edifice over to the Reverend Dennis Hasset
(Ciaran Hinds), who had been exiled to the sticks for being in
the company of the raffish Miss Leplastrier.  The midsection
of the film becomes a road movie, as Oscar and his band trek
through allegedly dangerous areas controlled by aborigines,
expecting to deliver the goods to a thoroughly surprised
preacher and his congregation.  </P>
<P>   A key point of the novel which the film hasn't the time or
inclination to bare is the motive behind Lucinda's reckless
wager.  It's not that she has no use for the money she had
inherited: she did, in fact, bask in her ownership of the glass
works she purchased.  But she was plagued by guilt.  The
money did not belong to her; it was her parents'.  More
important, she believed that her father stole the money,
having overrun land settled by blacks, which he later
successfully farmed.  </P>
<P>   But no matter.  Movies are a visual art, and Gillian
Armstrong--working with Luciana Arrighi's luxuriant production
design, Janet Patterson's striking costumes, and Geoffrey
Simpson's resplendent lensing--has splashed the screen with
color and a thoroughly adult piece of craftsmanship, while
evoking--however sketchily--the conflicts between physical
pleasure and the hope of salvation, between Victorian
assurance of the existence of God and Charles Darwin's
challenge to this certainty, and between a concern for the
community's values and a grasping on to one's own notions. 
She has evoked solid work from Ralph Fiennes and Cate
Blanchette, two oddballs who were made for each other but
able to consummate their feelings only at the card table.  If
we must bring the metaphysical down to earth, "Oscar and
Lucinda" is at heart a tale of two lonely people brought
endearingly together if only for a second in God's cosmic
timetable.  Rated R.  Running Time: 131 minutes.  (C) 1997
