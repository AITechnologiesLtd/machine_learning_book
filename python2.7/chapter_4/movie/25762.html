<P>Cast: Brad Pitt, Juliette Lewis, David Duchovny, Michelle Forbes 
Written by: Stephan Levy and Tim Metcalfe 
Directed by: Dominic Sena 
Running Time: 115 minutes (R-rated) / 118 minutes (unrated) </P>
<P>Kalifornia stars David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes as Brian and Carrie,
an artistic middle class couple with dreams of making it big in
California.  Brian is a writer trying his hand at a novel about serial
killers and Carrie is a photographer waiting for her break.  The two
plan on driving out to the Pacific coast, stopping at different serial
killer locations where Brian will gather info for his book and Carrie
will take the pictures.  However to get to California, Brian and Carrie
need another couple to split the costs with them.  Brian posts a message
on a local bulletin board, and it's responded to by Early Grayce (Brad
Pitt, about as far away from "Sexiest Man Alive" you can get) and his
girlfriend Adele (Juliette Lewis), two folks definitely from the other
side of the tracks.  Aside from their obvious class differences, a major
problem develops... Early tends to explode into murderous rages from
time to time. </P>
<P>What I liked most about Kalifornia is that there's no "fluff" involved. 
Every scene serves to either advance the story or (most importantly)
develop the characters.  As a result, the people are all human beings
and every situation is 100% believable.  Also along those lines, while
the film is brutally violent, the violence is all a part of Pitt's
character and not there just to be gratuitous.  Some of the most
shocking acts of violence are merely implied, and they are the most
disturbing of all. </P>
<P>The four leads in the film are perfectly cast, although special notice
must be given to Juliette Lewis.  Lewis, while able to play white trash
in her sleep, manages to add an extra layer of depth to her character. 
She ultimately becomes the film's most important character and her
performance is truly and sincerely heartbreaking. </P>
<P>Kalifornia is available on DVD from MGM Home Entertainment (this DVD is
simply a reissue of the early Polygram edition, no longer in print).  It
contains the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1 and
includes a fullframe option as well on the other side of the disc.  The
theatrical R-rated cut and an unrated cut of the film (running 3 minutes
longer) are available on both sides.  Extras include the original
theatrical trailer, a behind the scenes featurette, and a booklet with
notes from the film's promotional materials. </P>
<P>The film is called Kalifornia because that's the way Brian spells
California on the note he posts to the bulletin board.  No explanation
is given as to why he spells it that way, and some other plot points are
equally as vague.  However, none of these ambiguities hinder the film in
the slightest.  Kalifornia is well acted, smartly written, expertly
directed, and definitely a film you need to see. </P>
<P>(Note: The booklet which comes with the DVD offers an explanation as to
why the title is spelled with a K... it was simply to distinguish it
from a 1948 film called California.  However, I bet no one would ever
confuse the two.) </P>
