<PRE>               A film review by Vince Waldron</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1997 Vince Waldron</PRE>
<P>A very pleasant surprise from writer director Nick Casavettes, son of the
founding father of american independent cinema, a genuinely heartfelt
character study that features an immensely satisfying starring performance
from the director's mom, Gena Rowlands (who proves once again that she is
without question one of the American cinema's most gifted and intelligent
of any age or gender.)   There aren't a great deal of shattering
breakthroughs in the movie's straightforward screenplay, but the film
offers its relaxed and extremely capable ensemble enough privileged moments
that I was more than willing to forgive the story's occasional pat turns.
If nothing else, this film should be required viewing for its depiction of
an intelligent, sexy older woman who sacrifices not a wit of her dignity,
intelligence and believability along the way.  Highly recommended.</P>
