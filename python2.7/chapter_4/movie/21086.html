<PRE>THE STRAIGHT STORY
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        In "The Straight Story," 73-year-old Alvin Straight learns that his
brother Lyle, with whom he hasn't exchanged a civil word in almost ten
years, has had a stroke.  Determined to pay his estranged brother a visit,
Alvin drives across Iowa and into Wisconsin on a John Deere riding mower.</P>
<P>        That unusual set-up makes for a very interesting road movie as the
ailing Alvin (Oscar® probable Robert Farnsworth) heads out across America's
heartland against the better judgment of his grown daughter Rose (Sissy
Spacek).</P>
<P>        For much of the film we're treated to colorful vistas of cornfields
stretching far and wide towards the great Mississippi, their symmetric
lines fazed occasionally by a lone combine kicking up dust.  And Alvin,
unfazed by everything around him, dogged and determined like a mangy old
cur worrying a bone.</P>
<P>        It would be nice if this amiable, heartfelt little film could be
remembered for its simple and straightforward storyline and the power of
its performances.  After all, if you're going to be watching a
septuagenarian trekking cross-country on a lawnmower, engaging those he
meets along the way in candid conversation, then whose better company to
share than Farnsworth's?  Unfortunately, "The Straight Story" is more
likely to be talked about as "that G-rated picture David Lynch made for
Disney" rather than for the notable contributions of Farnsworth and Spacek,
who's longtime husband Jack Fisk is responsible for the distinctive
production design.</P>
<P>        Scary storms, road-kill, teenage pregnancy, moving violations, a
semi-naked man with liver spots who, later, downs a beer--ask yourself how
this movie got a G-rating when all those other, harmless, inoffensive
G-rated films were slapped with a "PG."  It would seem that the promoting
of this film has once again revealed the inconsistency--and the
hypocrisy--of the MPAA.</P>
<P>        Calculated marketing ploys aside, "The Straight Story" is a
worthwhile investment of your time, although--action fans take note--about
as slow moving as Alvin's curious mode of transportation.  The lone
traveler seems genuinely surprised when a fleet of cyclists pass him by.
"What's the worst thing about getting old?" one of them asks him at camp
later that evening.  "Remembering what it was like to be young."</P>
<P>        The film is filled with these kinds of observations; none of them
particularly awe-inspiring but all of them genuine and from the heart.
Like the time Alvin tells a hitchhiker who's running away from home that a
warm bed and a roof over one's head sound a lot better than sharing a
wiener on a stick with an old geyser who's traveling by lawnmower.</P>
<P>        In that vein, "The Straight Story" concerns itself first and
foremost with the strength of family: unlike a single twig, a cluster of
sticks cannot be easily broken.  It's a simple yet effective metaphor that
mirrors the simplicity and effectiveness of the entire film.  And we can
thank the Motion Picture Association of America for allowing General
Audiences to see it.</P>
