<PRE>DON'T WATCH THIS BIRDIE</PRE>
<P>The problem with watching a movie where well-known actors appear in
drag is that invariably the movie just becomes a vehicle for said
actors trying to stretch the comic buck of the dressing-up thing for
as much as they can. Remember TO WONG FOO, THANKS FO R EVERYTHING,
JULIE NEWMAR? Acting, even by Hollywood standards, is at a serious
premium here at BIRDCAGE.</P>
<P>But then again, that's obviously not the reason why one would go to
watch this movie. It's a comedy, or at least that's what it's billed
as. Adapted from the french movie LA CAGE AUX FOLLES or "The Cage of
Madmen," this movie doesn't live up to the origin al. Isn't it funny
how so many good movies from France lose something when they get
Hollywoodised? (A little qualifier would be THE ASSASSIN, but that's
only because they copied the whole movie line for line, and Brigette
Fonda is kinda cute). Clearly the french title loses something with my
translation and the Hollywood version actually sounds nicer, but hey,
I could just be a poor translator.</P>
<P>The story revolves around the lives of two families, the
Goldmans and the Keeleys. Robin Williams and Nathan Lane play Armand
and Albert Goldman, owners of the eponymous Birdcage, a drag
nightclub, while Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest are Senator and Mrs
Keeley, believers in the sort of conservatism that would have made
them burn the Puritans at the stake for Caligari-like decadence.</P>
<P>The two families collide when their children Val and Barbara decide to
get married. Barbara needs to convince her Senator Dad that the
marriage is the right thing despite the fact that she's only 18. He is
initially reluctant as he's too busy planning his re-election.
Circumstances change and he's led to believe that the only way to
salvage his political career is to be seen doing something with a
"feel-good" factor, and there's hardly anything more likely to tug the
heartstrings of the public than a good 'ol-fashioned wedding. Val
panics and enlists the help of his dads in an attempt to make them
look like a normal family for one day as the Keeleys come to visit.</P>
<P>What results is embarassingly obvious and really, the audience just
laughs because it feels obliged to. Nothing original happens in this
movie and Robin Williams shows once again that he's a cotton candy
actor: any good feelings about him disappear strai ght after walking
under the exit sign. What's worse in this movie is that he's abysmally
insipid throughout. He's an actor who's realized that him trying to
act really isn't all that commercially viable (be honest: anyone could
have done DEAD POETS' SOCIE TY; and THE FISHER KING, who understood
that??). Reversion back to Mork-mode was inevitable. Doing that
properly may have at least salvaged something of this mess. He's so
boring in this movie that he actually makes Nathan Lane look good.
Yeah sure, you'v e probably seen the shots of the movie and heard the
touting of Nathan Lane stealing the show. Well, it isn't so much a
case of him stealing the show as everyone else throwing it at him. His
drag impersonation is laboured and definitely gets on the nerves
quickly. That scene with Williams trying to teach Lane "How To Be a
Man" was definitely a 10 on the cheesy scale.</P>
<P>That's not all. Like father like son and here, Val (Dan Futterman)
feels some genetic need to emulate Williams' perfomance. He maintains
this unfazable look through all the tribulations his character is
supposed to be going through. Anyone else would have done a decent
portrayal of a young man whose life is about to come apart. This is
obviously below Val and one suspects that he's incapable of doing
anything but look cool. He certainly looks like he'll be more
comfortable in a "Top Gun" sort of movie tha n a funny-farm drag
misadventure.</P>
<P>Scraping the bottom of the barrel, we get a couple of plus points. You
get a little look at Miami's South Beach where the film is set and we
get to see Gene Hackman's finest hour in the last minute of the movie.
Be warned though: Don't watch this movie un less you're prepared to
not think about it ever after. It's the stuff nightmares are made of.</P>
