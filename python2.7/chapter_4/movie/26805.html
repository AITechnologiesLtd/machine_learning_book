<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>"Bossa Nova" is a movie so trite, it feels as though it got lost on its
way to the Brazilian version of "Must See TV". That it wastes some good
performances and touching scenes -- as well as an all-too-rare sensitive 
depiction of middle-aged romance -- makes the experience all the more
exasperating. Although it serves moderately well as a feel-good picture,
"Bossa Nova" is ultimately not dissimilar from a night spent carousing in
Rio: a dim impression of amusement, fading rapidly from the memory.</P>
<P>Amy Irving, wife of director Bruno Barreto, stars as Mary Ann Simpson, an
American teaching English in Rio de Janeiro. She becomes the object of
affection of contract lawyer Pedro Paulo (portrayed by prolific Brazilian
actor Antonio Fagundes). At the same time, Pedro is defending his father
Juan (Alberto de Mendoza) against litigation by his fourth ex-wife, which
may mean the loss of Juan's beloved tailor shop. Also employed at the
tailor shop is Pedro's half-brother Roberto (Pedro Cardoso), who is 
smitten with Pedro's pretty new intern Sharon (Giovanna Antonelli).</P>
<P>Meanwhile, amongst Mary Ann's other students are soccer star Acacio
(Alexandre Borges), who is developing an unhealthy interest in his teacher
while preparing to move to London with his gregarious manager Gordo
(Sergio Loroza), and the lonely Nadine (Drica Moraes). Nadine, trying to
encourage the solitary Mary Ann to meet someone, introduces her to the
world of Internet romance. Nadine herself has been involved in an online
relationship with a New York artist named Gary, and is trying to work up
the courage to visit him. She is encouraged in this endeavour by her
travel agent, Tania (Debora Bloch), recently divorced from none other than 
Pedro Paulo.</P>
<P>It is true that the existence of so many characters, all so completely
intertwined, strains at one's sense of belief. But within the confines of
this kind of movie, it is not in of itself an object of criticism -- it is
part of the grammar of this type of romantic comedy, which relies on the
timeworn gambits of mistaken identity and misunderstood dialogue to garner
laughs and propel the storyline. Indeed, "Bossa Nova" becomes even more
incestuous as it progresses -- for example, Pedro Paulo and Acacio develop
a strange sort of semi-rivalry, which leads to Acacio becoming a client of
Pedro's, which results in Acacio getting involved with Sharon, which means
that he and Roberto have also become inadvertent rivals.</P>
<P>Other films have utilised similarly unlikely set-ups and mined them for
great laughs. But the screenplay for "Bossa Nova", by Alexandre Machado
and Fernanda Young, is only fleetingly funny. More often than not, the
comedy is the sort reserved for short-lived network sitcoms, such as a
painful sequence where Nadine goes to apply for a visa and quickly talks
herself into trouble until Tania makes the rescue. And then there's the
appearance by Stephen Tobolowsky's geeky Trevor, who inexplicably insists
on referring to Pedro Paulo by the groan-inducing Anglicisation "Peter
Paul".</P>
<P>When "Bossa Nova" succeeds, it is usually when it concentrates on the
central relationship between Mary Ann and Pedro Paulo. Although the
plethora of competing subplots prevents this romance from being anything
but cursorily explored, it is a touching and effective pairing which
makes good use of the skills of both Irving and Fagundes. There is a
superb scene, for instance, where Pedro takes Mary Ann's measurements
thoroughly, without touching her or otherwise arousing her suspicions,
while they ride in an elevator, and then puts his long-dormant tailor
skills to use in making her a blouse. But even here the movie undercuts
itself: the blouse scene over with, it appears Machado and Young had
little idea what else to do with the concept, and quickly skip to the
inevitable result of Pedro's secretly sending it to Mary Ann.</P>
<P>There is too much going on in "Bossa Nova", and none of it receives the
attention it deserves. A subplot involving Tania and her Chinese lover is
almost criminally underexploited, such that it appears to exist only to
keep Tania from Pedro for a long period of time.Several characters receive
so little development that it is difficult to feel any reaction to the
unfolding of their respective story arcs. This is especially true of
Sharon, who flip-flops back and forth between Roberto and Acacio seemingly
at whim, without any clear motivation (in a cute touch, her backpack
changes shape to reflect her current allegiance).</P>
<P>Beyond Irving and Fagundes, only Borges and Loroza stand out. Although
neither has much to do individually, they do make for an amusingly 
arrogant double act. Although she looks very good, Antonelli never finds
her groove as Sharon, and feels awkward and out of place; the same can be
said of Tobolowsky. Others simply seem to be filling space. Consider
Cardoso and Bloch, for example, whose final fates are so offhandedly
treated that they come across as mere plot facilitators.</P>
<P>Director Barreto at least keeps the pace of "Bossa Nova" moving, such that
only a few scenes seem to go on well past their sell-by date (a
fortuitous accomplishment, giving the paucity of much of the humour).
But Barreto is also too preoccupied with showing off the beauty of Rio.
Right from the opening shots, Barreto allows his depiction of the
landscape to become gratuitous. And, ironically, sequences where he could
really show off the territory to good effect -- like Mary Ann's daily 
forays into the ocean -- are so tightly lensed as to be almost
claustrophobic.</P>
<P>Also disappointing is the incidental music by Eumir Deodato. Given the
movie's title, one could be forgiven for expecting a riveting and 
attractive bossa nova score. But Deodato's compositions are generally
tedious and sleep-inducing, and the music never becomes the crucial
ingredient that the filmmakers seem to be trying to set up. Indeed,
Deodato's score is perhaps emblematic of "Bossa Nova" as a whole -- not
really bad, in fact occasionally alluring, but for the most part simply 
failing to be at all interesting.</P>
