<PRE>_Superstar_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Lorne Michaels and his SNL Studios have better luck with this big-screen
outing of meek Catholic school girl Mary Katherine Gallagher (Molly
Shannon) than they did with their previous _Saturday_Night_Live_
adaptation, last fall's horrendous _A_Night_at_the_Roxbury_.  That's
because, unlike _Roxbury_'s head-bobbing Butabi brothers, there's more to
the character of Mary than a single characteristic--there's also a lot of
heart.  Although director Bruce McCulloch and writer Steven Wayne Koren
do offer a taste of what Mary is known for--that is, reciting movie
monologues and knocking over and/or breaking stuff--what keeps the film
engaging, albeit superficially, is the gentle sweetness that Shannon
gives her.</P>
<P>But, much like an _SNL_ skit, _Superstar_ ultimately misses more than it
hits.  The story has Mary trying to impress her dream guy (Will
Ferrell)--and earn her first kiss--by entering a school talent
competition, and from this thin wisp of a story emerges a few funny and
amusingly bizarre set pieces, notably a memorable scene with a tree and a
couple of musical production numbers.  Between those moments, however,
are too many gags that don't work, namely a bunch of unfunny fantasy
sequences: recurring appearances by a groovy Jesus Christ (also played by
Ferrell), a strained send-up of _Armageddon_, and, most painfully, a
supermodel photo shoot.  Forced bits of padding such as those just show
that the concept really doesn't merit more than the five minutes its
allotted on Saturday nights.</P>
