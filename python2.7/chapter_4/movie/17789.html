<PRE>BY AARON MICHAELS</PRE>
<P>Gone with the Wind is one of the best films ever made. I have not met a
intelligent person who hasn't liked this movie. Ted Turner has decided
to remaster this classic for it's 60th anniversary. He cleaned up the
picture and sound so that a new generation of people can enjoy this
perfect movie.</P>
<P>Gone with the Wind is a soap-operaish epic taking place around the time
of the Civil War with the classic character Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien
Leigh). Scarlett is the most sought after woman in all Georgia and she
teases men and makes them do what she wants. She was born into a family
that owns a large cotton plantation called Tara. Her father Gerald
O'Hara (Thomas Mitchell) expects his daughter to continue work on the
plantation after he's passed. This is not Scarlett's intent and she
would rather woo a rich beau.</P>
<P>Scarlett is shocked to find that a man, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard),
is not completely in love with her. He is instead engaged to be married
the kind and gentle Melanie Hamilition (Olivia de Havilland). Scarlett
loves him, at least she thinks she loves him. She sets out to make
Ashley in love with her.</P>
<P>At a town party a rich playboy named Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) makes
his way into town for a political meeting having to do with the
possibility of war. Scarlett is interested in this poker playing
handsome man but still wants Ashley. Rhett finds out about her obsession
and lightens the movie with some humor about how she acts so whiny about
the situation.</P>
<P>When confronted by Scarlett, Ashley says he does love her but won't
leave Melainie for her. The Civil War breaks and Scarlett is shocked by
how Ashley wants to leave. Ashley leaves and this begins Scarlett's mad
quest for him which blocks the fact that she actually loves Rhett.</P>
<P>This is the poorest plot to talk about. The almost 4 hour movie is so
long and complex that it would take me about 15 paragraphs to just start
the review. I only usually write 2-4 paragraphs for plot to save room
for the review. This is the perfect movie to save room for.</P>
<P>This movie is one of the longest films ever made. It's beautiful, full
color images entranced audiences in 1939 and still do today. In inflated
terms, Gone with the Wind is the highest grossing film of all time by a
long shot. It makes much more than Titanic. Compare the $0.40 it would
cost to see Gone
with the $6.50 who would pay to see Titanic and you will know why it
beats the so-called largest grossing film of all time.</P>
<P>After 60 years the film still stays remarkable. The vast shots of war
victims and of the burning of Atlanta are some of the best ever and
don't show age. Some of the blue screened shots, such as one with
Scarlett in Rhett's carriage, do show their age but it's amazing the
special effects still look great after 60 years. Let's see how Jurassic
Park fares around 2055.</P>
<P>The acting in this film is the just plain perfect. Leigh is wonderfully
cast as Scarlett and plays the whiny women great. Gable is the standout
of the show though in this Oscar-snubbed performance. He shows in the
last hour some of the best acting that has ever been attempted by an
actor.</P>
<P>Director Victor Fleming has created one of the most perfect films ever
made. It still stands as a wonderful production of romance, action, and
self righteousness.</P>
