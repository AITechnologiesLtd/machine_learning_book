<P>Woody Allen's 29th cinematic feature celebrates the blinded attention
that people pay celebrities in contemporary society. Another jam-packed
cast of celebs ironically pepper this picture, with Woody, the actor,
sitting this one out himself. The film is shot in black & white, of
which Allen self-deprecates himself in the film via one of the
characters when he notes a famous, pretentious director to be the "type
of asshole that shoots all of his movies in black and white!"</P>
<P>PLOT:
This film follows the parallel lives of Lee (Branagh) and his wife
Robin (Davis), after their 16-year marriage ends in divorce. Lee the
writer, covers the celebrity beat, and meets various types of famous
people from the really important to the wannabee importants, while
Robin, attempts to seriously reconstruct her confidence, and her
ability to love again. Some vignettes behind the closed doors of
celebrity ensues. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Mediocre, mostly unfunny, sometimes interesting piece of cinema that
doesn't really blow you away in any sense or proportion, offers very
little real insight into the lives of celebrities, but does present an
excellent sequence with Leonardo DiCaprio, playing the role of the
unbridled, young movie actor. Over the years, I've noticed that most
Woody Allen movies are predeterminedly enjoyed by those in the Woody
Allen fan club or not. I mean, most people I know either hate the guy,
or love the guy. I personally love the guy and his films, but his most
recent crop has been less than original or interesting. Most recently,
he seems to be writing his scripts in his sleep, with only the
exhaustive Hollywood cast list lingering at the top of his priority
template.</P>
<P>This film was much like DECONSTRUCTING HARRY (6/10) in that it had some
really funny lines, but it mostly played out like a drama, and didn't
succeed exceptionally well in either forum. I was expecting a lot of
behind the scenes insight into celebrities and the public's fascination
thereof, but this film just presented me with a bunch of scenes of
Kenneth Branagh (doing his best Woody Allen impressions) trying to get
it on with different celebrity types. Not that interesting or funny, to
tell you the truth. The rest of the cast was also pretty fair, but for
the exceptionally well-written and well-played scenario with Leo
DiCaprio venting out on his girlfriend and an innocent hotel room,
which proudly stood out like a sore thumb. The whole scene was quite
funny, extremely well-written, and played out very naturally by the
Cap-man himself.</P>
<P>All in all, the film never sold me on any insight into celebrity,
barely worked on a relationship level with Branagh and Judy Davis
trying to get over their divorce, but did offer several very funny
lines and a pretty slick Leo DiCaprio scene. Unlike MANHATTAN, this
movie also had very little in cinematography to get excited about, and
even less in originality, as Allen's New York-style-humor well seems to
be drying up in the 90's. I loved 1994's BULLETS OVER BROADWAY (8/10),
but since then, the Woodman has done very little to impress this
life-long fan. Oh well, I won't give up on you just yet, Woodrow, but I
would not recommend this mediocre entry into someone else's weekend
movie plans, that's for sure. For those interested, go rent BULLETS
OVER BROADWAY, BANANAS (8/10) or ANNIE HALL (8.5/10) and enjoy the
Woody of young, and hope that his next few films revive his creativity,
and rejuvenate his capacity to wow us all over again! </P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Leonardo DiCaprio's full name is Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio. He was born
in Hollywood, California. Leo received $2,500,000 for his role in
TITANIC (7/10). To this day, that film has domestically grossed over
$600,000,000. Leo once turned down the role of Robin in BATMAN FOREVER
(6/10), and also considered starring in a movie about actor James Dean
but turned down the role because he felt he wasn't experienced enough
to do the film (1996). When Leo was 5 years old he was in an
educational kids program called "Romper Room". He was nearly kicked off
for uncontrollable behavior. His father George was a comic book dealer.
In 1991-92, he played the homeless boy Luke in the TV sitcom "Growing
Pains".
Winona Ryder was born Winona Laura Horowitz and named after the town in
which she was born, Winona Minnesota. Director David Seltzer spotted
her and cast her in 1986's LUCAS (Her first film.) When telephoned to
ask how she'd like to have her name appear on the credits, she
suggested Ryder as her father's Mitch Ryder album was playing in the
background. Winona was selected for the part of Mary Corleone in THE
GODFATHER: PART III (7/10), but had to drop out of the role after
catching the flu from the strain of doing the films WELCOME HOME, ROXY
CARMICHAEL and MERMAIDS back to back. She said she didn't want to let
everyone down by doing a substandard performance. Others have suggested
that she pulled out from the part because of problems with boyfriend
Johnny Depp, with whom she had been going out since she was 17. The
part eventually went to director Coppola's own daughter Sophia.
This is Judy Davis' fourth presence in a Woody Allen film, with
previous appearances in ALICE (6/10), DECONSTRUCTING HARRY (6/10) and
HUSBANDS & WIVES (7.5/10). She attended drama school with Mel Gibson.
They played Romeo and Juliet together.
Kenneth Branagh was born in Northern Ireland. He was originally cast as
the lead in AMADEUS before the production company decided on an
American cast. The role eventually went to Tom Hulce. Ken was married
to actress Emma Thompson from 1989 to 1996.
Producer Jean Doumanian plays Leonardo DiCaprio's agent in the
limousine scene.</P>
