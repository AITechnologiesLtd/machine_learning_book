 Writer: Barbara Kopple
 Cast: Woody Allen, Soon-Yi Previn, et al</PRE>
<P>   A few days ago Dame Judi Dench insisted that she would
not allow any more interviews.  The distinguished British
actress, perhaps grouchy about being passed over for the
Oscar for her role as Queen Victoria in "Mrs Brown," contends
that things were better when the audience did not know so
much about performers.  She might change her mind after
seeing the delightful biopic, "Wild Man Blues," which does for
the film industry what "Artemisia" does for painting.  Each
of these movies takes us into the head and soul of one of the
most creative persons of a generation, one about an unlikely
celebrity since she was a woman at a time that women were
not acceptable as artists, the other about an equally unlikely
personality who made it big despite his nerdishness.</P>
<P>   "Wild Man Blues" is a documentary for people who don't
like documentaries.  It comes across like a partially scripted,
partially improvised comedy.  Filmed over a period of 24 days
during Woody Allen's European tour in the spring of 1996, the
movie is essentially two features in one.  The part that will
appeal to jazz fans and to quite a few who didn't know they
were jazz fans until they saw it features Woody playing New
Orleans Dixieland with a band directed by a charming banjo
player, Eddy Davis, who also hired a few others to round out
the company.  The segment that will entice diehard fans of
the great writer-actor-director shows Woody Allen in private
moments in his hotel rooms with his soon-to-be wife, Soon-Yi
Previn, and presents the comic genius as he meets his
substantial, cheering public in cities like Paris, London, Milan,
Bologna, Turin, Rome and Madrid.  Wherever he walks he is
followed by inspired devotees and paparazzi.  When he is in
his private quarters, he appears like any other tourist.  We
must appreciate that not anyone could have filmed the man
letting down his hair, so to speak, and forgetting that the
ubiquitous movie camera even exists.  That awesome feat is
accomplished by director Barbara Kopple, known to select
American audiences for her filming of "Harlan County USA" in
1977, a gripping documentary and Academy Award winner
about the strike of Kentucky mine workers against the
Eastover Mining Company.  Kopple also plied her talent in
filming "American Dream" a decade ago, yet another Oscar
winner about the hows, whats and whys of a labor strike at
the Hormel meat plant in Austin, Minnesota, a Michael-Moore-
like story of a profitable company attempting to reduce wages
and break a union just for the sake of doing so.</P>
<P>   What is particularly sound about "Wild Man Blues" is that it
is not a puff piece but rather presents the man as both flawed
human being and as a man who despite his chief
psychological hangup--by Mr. Allen's admission his alleged
inability to experience pleasure--is nonetheless able to lose
himself when blowing into his clarinet.  Each time he gets
past the fans, the paparazzi, the dignitaries looking for photo-
ops. and begins to join the band in such "primitive" works as
"Ja Da," "The Old Rugged Cross," "You Rascal You" and the
title song, "Wild Man Blues," he is transported.  Eyes closed,
exhaling into his instrument as though he were charming all
the snakes of Benares, he gives you the feeling that he would
rather be doing this than performing in "Annie Hall"--and
certainly prefers this musical activity to acting as regisseur of
such flops as "Interiors" and "Stardust Memories."  While Mr.
Allen considers his music merely a hobby and not something
that he does for money, he insists that he finds time to
practice his clarinet daily and, judging by audiences in major
European cities who probably showed up to see him and only
secondarily to hear his music, he won them over by his talent
with the horn as well.</P>
<P>   The major pleasure of the film is watching the unseen
Barbara Kopple at work, focusing her camera on him for so
many hours each day that he seems to have forgotten she is
there.  Proving that he is a funny funny man not just in his
movies but in his daily life, he knocks off some lines that
you'd swear were rehearsed, but given his wit and
intelligence, they presumably came off the top of his head. 
Facing a lovely Weimaraner in his private plane, a pooch
owned by the movie's producer Jean Doumanian, he effects a
look that will win him no votes among dog owners and
remarks, "I'd rather the dog bit me than licked me."  Not even
a companion's insistence that a dog's mouth is cleaner than a
person's dissuades him from his distaste for canines.  </P>
<P>   While Mr. Allen and Soon-Yi stayed at the best hotels in
Europe including one in Milan which had a private swimming
pool right in his room, he nonetheless frets, "When am I
gonna do my underwear?"  Though he loves the City of Lights
because"Paris has great, gray weather...I don't like the sun,"
he compares that beautiful town unfavorably to New York
where "I know I can get a bowl of duck wonton soup at 4:30
a.m.  I don't do it, because who needs it at that hour?"  And
in one large Italian city he worries, "This being Milan, I hope
the laundry doesn't come back breaded."  Of Bologna: "I
know with a couple of valium I could really learn to love this
city."  In London, especially, he hopes to "put on a good
show...here they can hate me in my own language."  The
principal thing he likes about Europe is that his U.S.-failed
films "Interiors" and "Stardust Memories" did well abroad:
"Europeans like films that drone on."</P>
<P>   Mr. Allen must really like (or dislike) his parents: he
apparently allowed some rather embarrassing statements to
pass the final cut.  After returning to his Manhattan apartment
where his nonagenarian folks awaited him, he heard his mom
whine, "I would have preferred he fell in love with a nice
Jewish girl."  And this in front of Soon-Yi Previn!  For his part,
dad would have preferred that Woody become a pharmacist
and has apparently not seen a single one of his son's movies.</P>
<P>   "Wild Man Blues" portrays its hero winning a lifetime
achievement award, one which might conceivably be
presented as well to Barbara Kopple for a smashing job with
the three principal documentaries she directed.  If Woody
Allen is unable to experience pleasure, he can rest assured
that he continues to give it to his devoted followers.   Rated
PG.  Running time: 104 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
