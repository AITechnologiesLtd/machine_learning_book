<PRE>ROUNDERS (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: John Dahl
Writers: David Levien and Brian Koppelman
Starring: Matt Damon, Edward Norton, Gretchen Mol, John Turturro, Famke
Janssen, John Malkovich, Martin Landau</P>
<P>"Rounders" spends a lot of time in the cellars and card clubs of Manhattan
and elsewhere to prove one thing to itself: it has no problem with diving
full head into its subject.  This is not a film where the hero learns a
lesson about gambling and the dangers thereof over the course of the film. 
He doesn't win one last card game in the end to prove to himself that he
can in fact beat the best card player in the world so that he never has to
play again.  He doesn't even get the girl in the end.</P>
<P>The fact that it doesn't bullshit itself about gambling is one of the few
reasons "Rounders" works at all.  This film is never more exciting and
engrossing when characters are engaging in a tough game of poker, with the
stakes reaching as high as they can possibly go, smoke teeming from
everywhere, and cool jazz music underscoring everything.  And it's never
more boring than when it's dealing with the melodrama of the plot or the
lives of the characters.  If this film had just been two hours of guys
playing poker games, with a very skimpy plot, I'd actually be more pleased.</P>
<P>But screenwriters David Levien and Brian Koppelman don't have the guts to
do that.  I imagine that the first draft of this film really took us into
the lives of Rounders, the guys who play poker for a living.  Imagine a
stylistic masterpiece that introduced us to the lives of these people, and
showed many games and the methods they use.  Films are never more
engrossing when the characters are the spotlight and plot elements are just
the reaons we watch them, especially when they have such an interesting
subject.</P>
<P>As such, "Rounders" is merely adequate, with signs of brilliance underneath
that go pretty much unchecked.  The film opens nicely, with an intense game
of poker between the film's protagonist, one Mike McDermott (Matt Damon), a
young law student who is a kick-ass poker player, and Teddy, a.k.a. KGB
(John Malkovich), a Russian mobster who is a more kick-ass poker player. 
Mike typically loses, but the film really works because it's not really
about the outcome.  It cherishes the process of playing poker, and the
narration by Mike is so good and fascinating that it sets the film up
unfairly, in a sense.</P>
<P>Mike decides that he's not going to play poker, as a promise to his
beautiful girlfriend, Jo (Gretchen Mol), who comes off not so much as a
nice girlfriend who's really cared about him but more as a painful maternal
annoyance.  Mike's life changes when his old best friend, nicknamed Worm
(Edward Norton), gets out of jail for a gambling rap and needs to make a
ton of money to pay off some outstanding debts to some very bad people.  So
for the first hour, Mike has the dilmena of whether he should help out a
friend and gamble...or fuck him over and obey his girlfriend instead.</P>
<P>By the second hour, though, Mike has given over to the gambling side, and
when Mike and Worm are playing numerous tables, trying to make his money
back, which Mike has agreed to share with him, the film really takes off. 
A worthy subplot is introduced towards the beginning, showing that Worm
likes to cheat, which not only gets him in trouble, but conflicts with
Mike's code of gambling ethics.  It works because there's a real tension
between these two as a result, something we actually care about.  If the
screenwriters could have leveled the male-male bonding with the male-female
bonding in this film, they'd really have something.</P>
<P>The result of all this?  A silly script with some cool scenes, and very
good acting.  Damon, whether we like it or not, is a good actor, and is
very likable in the lead role, although it's dangerously close to his
previous role, Mr. Hunting.  Norton is wonderfully sleazy, showing that
he's becoming one of the most reliable actors around, and only after a mere
four screen performances.  In supporting roles, John Turturro is
wonderfully controlled as a long-time gambler who's made a career out of
being totally careful with his card playing; Martin Landau is really good
in a brief role as a judge from Mike's school who helps him get his life
straightened out with one speech (although his reasoning in one scene
towards the end is weak); and Famke Janssen's sorta just there, although
semi-interestingly so, as a woman who works in one of the house of games. 
Malkovich nicely overacts a bit, with an off-the-wall Russian accent
(agressive = ag-ra-i-seeeev) which makes his character all the more
intense.</P>
<P>But "Rounders" big weakness seems to be the lack of real atmosphere and
devilishness, a big shock since the film is directed by John Dahl, the guy
who directed the devilishly entertaining "The Last Seduction," which
featured a femme fatale who was never forced to pull her punch.  Although
the script pulls its punch in the beginning and works its way back again,
there's nothing truly fascinating about what goes on when poker is not
being played.  The melodrama and character development seems more like
filler than real character development.  The characters, like that of
Turturro's and Janssen's, are there to represent some of the elements of
poker playing, but are sadly underdeveloped (at least Turturro can act well
enough to slighly cover it all up).  And the film just never truly
convinced me that it was a totally important story to tell in the first
place.</P>
<P>However, I did enjoy this film.  It worked for me, mainly because there is
poker that is played, and it works every now and then as an introduction to
that world.  There's a scene where all the big rounders are sitting a table
in an Atlantic City casino, and Mike's narration tells us all about the
suckers who sit down and try to play with the big players.  Scenes like
this are when "Rounders" truly works, and since this is what pretty much
populates the second half of the film, it's almost impossible to not really
like this flick.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
