A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:
James Cameron</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: 
James Cameron</PRE>
<P>Starring: 
Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
Large sinking ship, two lovers from different economic backgrounds </P>
<P>Synopsis: 
In this film, which is part romance and part disaster movie, an old lady
remembers, through flashbacks, how she found true love and tragedy while
aboard a luxurious ocean liner that unfortunately struck an iceberg and
sank over eighty years ago in 1912. TITANIC begins with an exploration
submarine recovering a piece of paper from the sunken wreck of an old
ocean liner. The paper turns out to be a sketch of a woman, and soon
enough, an old woman named Rose shows up, claiming the sketch is a
picture of her in her youth. She then reveals her story: as a young
woman Rose is originally aboard the ship Titanic as the fiancee of an
arrogant rich man named Cal (Billy Zane). But she doesn't love the guy;
she's being forced by her mother to marry Cal for economic reasons.
While aboard the ocean liner, Rose meets a penniless artist named Jack
Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and truly falls in love. Their romance,
however, is cut short when the ocean liner begins to sink into icy water
after striking an iceberg. The lovers must be ready to make the ultimate
sacrifice for each other.</P>
<P>Opinion:
TITANIC is similar to a Disney cartoon. You know the drill: a spunky
lovely heroine must choose between two men. The odds-on favorite is a
jerk, while the underdog has a heart of gold. The only difference is
that TITANIC is a little more tragic, and there's no singing. And
instead of using cartoon effects, it spends 200 million dollars on
special effects. All in all TITANIC is a good romance with superior,
believable effects for the most part. The acting is solid and dependable
as well.</P>
