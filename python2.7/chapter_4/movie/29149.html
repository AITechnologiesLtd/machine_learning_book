<P>PLOT:
Your old friends from the original AMERICAN PIE flick are back and not much has
changed. Of course, they've all completed a year in College at this point, but
they're still just looking to have a good time and get busy with the ladies. And
with the summer off and good times ahead, the lads decide to take their action
to the beach and hilarity, sexual promiscuity and lots of dick jokes ensue...</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This movie should've been called "A Teenager's Guide to Getting Laid!" It's a
decent follow-up to the original with a few laugh-out loud moments, much
hilarity by the way of Sean William Scott and Eugene Levy, a little deja-vu, a
little nostalgia and a weak ending. I enjoyed this movie on the whole and
certainly don't see how fans of the original wouldn't enjoy it either. It's got
all of the same elements working in this one and it manages to pull them all off
rather nicely. The plot is seriously unimportant, it's basically about the same
five guys from the original, all looking to get laid. Period. There are pissing
jokes (probably one of the funniest in the film), sexual embarrassments, some
lesbo stuff, some gay stuff, some tantra stuff, a few patches of T&A and a whole
lot of drinking and partying. Nothing wrong with all that, of course...</P>
<P>The film's also got a great soundtrack, at least to my ears, with pretty much
all of the cooler tunes from this summer making an appearance at one point or
another. But the downside to the film is that there are just too many characters
to cover and seeing as it is only a quickie summer flick, some are basically
relegated to cameo appearances (maybe the DVD will slice more of these folks
into an extended version or something). The girls, for example, are practically
absent during the entire film. Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Shannon Elizabeth and
Natasha Lyonne barely have any "real" moments in the whole movie. They just come
in from time to time and say a few words. A little disappointing. The film also
seems to lose its steam with about half an hour left. The energy of the
original's conclusion isn't matched in this one, and you just end up waiting for
a cool, surprising moment that never comes (no pun intended, ya'll!). But on the
whole, the film kept me smiling for the most part, had me cracking up whenever
Sean William Scott said anything (!) and definitely scored points for still
being able to give all of these kids a little bit of sweetness and "reality"
beneath all of that horniness and perversion, so I guess that's gotta count for
something! Sniff, sniff...it also reminded me of how irresponsible, sexually
experimental and fun my youth used to be before "adulthood" turned me into the
bitter, horny jerk you see before you...harumph, but I digress. A fun movie for
the kids! ;)</P>
