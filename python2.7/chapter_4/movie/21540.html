A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Watching the same film as a child, and then watching it again when you’re
older is a totally different experience. I can’t tell you how many times
I’ve watched this film when I was 6 or 7, but the grand total has to be
somewhere between 30 or 40. Aladdin was another warped Disney fairytale that
has been brought to life with great songs, flashy animation and effects, and
lots of funny characters and gags. This is one of the finer examples of Disney
animation because it was made during the golden age. In my opinion the golden
age started in 1991, when Beauty and the Beast premiered, to 1994 when The Lion
King came out. I think this is when Disney’s animators where releasing their
finest work. I can officially say that I now know all of the words that
confused me as a child, and have a new appreciation for this classic
children’s film. </P>
<P>Aladdin is a street rat in the city of Agrabah who has a pet monkey named Abu.
He dreams of becoming rich and living in a beautiful palace, much like that of
the sultan’s. Princess Jasmine (the first Disney character in the long line
of female heroines to have jet black hair) is legally contracted to marry a
prince by the age of 21. She refuses all suitors because if she marries, she
wants to marry for love. When Jasmine runs away from the palace to discover
life on her own, and the two of them meet, they instantly fall in love. Then
the sultan’s evil chief advisor named Jafar kidnaps Aladdin because he’s
the only one who can enter a cave where a magic lamp has been for millions of
years. When Aladdin goes in after it, the cave collapses on itself and Abu and
Aladdin are trapped inside with a magic flying carpet.</P>
<P>That all changes when he rubs the lamp he was supposed to retrieve, instantly
the crazy blue genie (Robin Williams at his best) pops out and tells him he has
three wishes. Aladdin wishes to be a prince so he can win over the heart of
Jasmine, but this gets in the way of Jafar’s plan to become sultan. Will the
genie earn his freedom? Will Jafar take over the kingdom? Will Aladdin’s true
identity be revealed to Jasmine and the rest of the kingdom? These are all
questions that will be answered, even if your child may not get the main plot
of the movie.</P>
<P>This is Disney at it’s best. Williams comes up with several very funny bits
(transforming into Groucho Marx, Jack Nicholson, and Julius Caesar, among
others) that make the film different from typical Disney fair. The songs are
also very well written, and the animation the accompanies them is very fitting
to the lyrics of the song. Your child’s favorite will probably be Abu or Iago
(Jafar’s parrot) but almost all of the characters are instantly likable. The
plot does have some problems (Whatever happened to the narrator? Why is the
sultan so dumb?) but they will either be unnoticed or just barely recognized by
you or any of your kids. The ending is a bit abrupt, but I still think that
this is a great film for your entire family to watch again and again. I think
that they should re-release it for its 10 year anniversary in 2002 for
generations to come. Wacky, fun, and great animation are what Aladdin is all
about, so this Disney classic gets *** 1/2 stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: Jafar turns into a scary snake and there are lots of Arabian
belly-dancers. Otherwise, the film is aimed right at the kiddies and they
should enjoy it. Good Age: 3 & Up</P>
