<PRE>                                GREMLINS 2
                       A film review by Laurie Mann
                        Copyright 1990 Laurie Mann</PRE>
<P>     I fell asleep during TURTLES, was mildly amused by BTTF III, but
had a terrific time at GREMLINS 2 today.  Yes, it's true, the
performances by the special effects are generally better than the
performances by the actors, and the film has more rubber logic than
most, but it's FUN!</P>
<P>     Yes, you can guess the story.  Gizmo winds up in a research lab
after his owner, the old Chinese man, dies.  The research lab in in
"Clamp Tower," a massive New York sky scraper that contains various
cable networks (including things like "The Archery Network" and "The
Safety Channel"), a mall, restaurants, and the headquarters for Clamp
International.  Of course, Billy and Kate, the heros from the first
film, also happen to work in that building.  Billy rescues Gizmo from
the genetics lab (run gleefully by Christopher Lee), but your typical
series of catastrophes happen to little Gizmo and gremlins rapidly
infest the entire building.</P>
<P>     Since there's a genetics lab to trash, the gremlins mutate into a
variety of bizarre creatures, including a winged gargoyle,
spider-monster, and a quasi-intellectual, pipe-smoking Yuppie.  There
are more sight-gags, parodies and wonderful bits throughout this movie.
There's the "Movie Police," "Microwaving with Marge," and some amusing
cameos by various Warner Brothers characters.  There's an on-target
parody of Kate's "Why I Hate Christmas" speech (though it was a tad too
long) from the first movie, and great satire of corporate personality
throughout the film.</P>
<P>     The movie is rated PG-13, though most of the violence happens to
gremlins and to the set rather than to any humans.  Our nine-year-old
was liked the movie, but didn't really start laughing at it until after
the gremlins popped out all over.</P>
<P>     The puppetry and radio-controlled gremlins in this movie were both
extremely well-done.  The gremlins have a little more personality in
this film than in the first one.</P>
<P>     GREMLINS 2 took a good idea and made it better.  I hope Dante &
company quit while they are ahead.  I'm not sure how the movie is doing.
We saw it in an empty theater today, which is a shame because the movie
is a blast.</P>
