<P>Director Robert Zemeckis ("Back to the Future") describes the
screenplay of "What Lies Beneath" as "written in the language of
Hitchcock." I am not sure if that is as insulting as Gus Van Sant's
abominable "Psycho" remake but it comes close. Not only does such a
statement make me want to vomit, but it further illustrates how
audiences today might be compelled to agree, since they will accept
anything with two glamorous movie stars. Actually, it is written in
the language of "Scream" and every slasher flick post-"Halloween," and
the truth is that all of those films are superior to this monotonous,
suspenseless and incredibly silly thriller.</P>
<P>Let's look at what lies beneath the episodic structure. The beautiful,
luscious Michelle Pfeiffer plays Claire Spencer, the morose wife to
Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford), a successful geneticist. They live in
some country house by a lake in Vermont, and their daughter has just
gone away to college. Claire misses her tremendously, and is beginning
to feel the effects of loneliness and isolation, especially since her
husband is working late hours. At home, she finds there are problems
with the electrical outlets in the bathroom (well, she gets a little
shock occasionally). Soon, she finds the front door to her house opens
by itself. Then picture frames begin to fall by themselves. But
wait!!! Who is the bearded gentleman living with his wife in the house
next door? And could the wife have been killed by her husband? And is
the possibly dead wife a ghost who is haunting Claire? And is this
another remake of "Rear Window," but without Christopher Reeve?</P>
<P>So far, so good. I must say that this is a fine setup for a possibly
supernatural thriller. And Pfeiffer plays her role straight, lending a
sympathetic hand for this melancholy heroine. Is she seeing things, or
is there really a ghost in the house? But, oh my, does Zemeckis and
writer Clark Gregg screw it up by installing one too many red
herrings. If you are one of the unlucky few who saw the trailer for
this movie, you know the inevitable denouement and everything that
leads to it. Suffice to say, I will not disclose much more except to
say that the setup is completely ruined and fabricated, leading to a
hodgepodge of other movies entirely.</P>
<P>Basically, "What Lies Beneath" is a hybrid of Hitchcock, "Sixth
Sense," "Stir of Echoes," "The Stepfather" and anything else you can
think of. Ask yourself this one question: are we seeing a thriller, a
drama about a potential tryst, a ghost story, the latest slasher
picture, or all the above? Apparently, Zemeckis and Gregg have no idea
so they copy and paste it all together hoping it will make sense and
surprise audiences. No sale.</P>
<P>I must say that I enjoyed the climactic, tense bathtub scene
(recalling "Fatal Attraction's" bloody climax) and the lovely
Pfeiffer's performance who invests more weight in the role than is
necessary. There is also James Remar as the suspicious, curt neighbor
(worth mentioning because he gives the best performance in the film,
and he also bears an uncanny resemblance to Harrison Ford's bearded
Richard Kimble in "The Fugitive") Unfortunately, Ford is left in the
sidelines, barely registering any chemistry with Pfeiffer, and
director Zemeckis is intent on throwing in the "fake scares" cliche,
one after another, not to mention the old "the killer is never really
dead" syndrome. From Ford, Pfeiffer, and Zemeckis, all that lies
beneath is a lack of purpose.</P>
