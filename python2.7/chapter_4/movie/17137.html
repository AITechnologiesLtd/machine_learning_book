<P>KUNDUN (director: Martin Scorsese; cast: Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong, Gyurme
Tethong, Tencho Gyalpo, Tsewang Migyur Khangsar, Geshi Yeshi Gyatso,
1997)</P>
<P>One may justifiably ask, as many critics did, what was Scorsese thinking
when he made Kundun? Is he capable of making a film on a subject he has
only a limited knowledge of?</P>
<P>The first question is a snap to answer, he was thinking about the 14th
Dalai Lama and the suffering of his people. Thusly, he would make a
political statement about the Tibetan situation and show the outrages
their culture is going through in the hands of the conquering
oppressors, the Chinese communists. The style of the film is semi -
documentary, allowing nonprofessional actors to dominate the film (they
did a great job).</P>
<P>The film begins with the joy and pride of the 14th Dalai Lama being
chosen at the age of two in 1937 and ends on the sour note of his forced
departure in 1959.</P>
<P>In between, the story is told from the Dalai Lama's point of view, as he
grows up quickly, faced with worldly decisions for his people at the
tender age of 14. His sense of reality is enhanced by his inner
experiences in the form of dreams and meditation. His nonviolence is
steadfast, despite reasons to feel anger at the Chinese for their
killings and barbarous attitude and insulting comments about his
country. What is most brilliant, is the camera work that focuses clearly
on all the chaos and religious nuances, and records them in a way acting
could not duplicate.</P>
<P>The shortcomings of this film may or may not be in the second question
asked: Whether Scorsese is capable of gleaming the truths of Tibetan
Buddhism, since any film about Tibet has to comprehend the influence
religion plays on its people. I think Scorsese wants this film to be
seen not necessarily as a religious experience, but as a spiritual
calling that people of different faiths from all over the world can
share in. This film is noncommercial, thereby it doesn't have to satisfy
the wants of those who demand to see a film in a  prescribed way. That
this film is successful and worth seeing, becomes apparent, especially,
when you compare it with the other recent film that tried to explore the
Tibetan situation, SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET; and it should become obvious
how Scorsese's film towers over that one in perspective and feeling. For
Christ's sake, the other humanitarian film used a Nazi as the hero of
the story, which made it very difficult to feel very trusting of the
film's aims, especially since no one even mentioned a little thing like
a holocaust taking place.</P>
<P>The weakness of Kundun is that since Scorsese wasn't confident or
knowledgable enough about Tibet, he had to use the Dalai Lama as a
source of reference for the film; and this shows, the film might be
authentic in scope, but it lacks the artistic spark a great work of art
must have, instead, this well - meaning presentation gets bogged down in
its own propaganda and the movie gets blandly trapped in its own goody -
two - shoe approach. Now, the exception to this, is that marvelously
original Dalai Lama dream sequence, the one of impending doom for his
country as he dreams of the monks in their red robes all lying dead in
the field. We see a human being who is concerned that maybe he doesn't
know everything.</P>
<P>I, for one, never fully trust those who are held up on a pedestal as
incarnations of what is good. And films that lose their ability to
penetrate all that makes things tick inside their characters, lose a
certain amount of integrity.</P>
<P>Though, Scorsese's film is not a masterpiece, it certainly accomplished
what he wanted it to do, and therefore with that limited objective in
mind, I find it easy to recommend this film (even though I consider
the HORSE THIEF to be the best film on Tibet to date, but I realize that
the subject matter of this film is exceedingly important and should be
seen by a wide range of people. After all, an entire culture is being
wiped out in front of our eyes, and people must be made aware of it. The
media has not done a good job in this regard, and maybe a film such as
this can somehow compensate somewhat for that past neglect.</P>
