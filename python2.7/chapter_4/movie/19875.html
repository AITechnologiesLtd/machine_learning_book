<PRE>THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        "The Blair Witch Project" sees an innovative idea marred by poor
execution.</P>
<P>        This low-budget film, now in wide release, uses a familiar
documentary approach to bring a heightened realism to its subject matter.
Since the movie is a good old-fashioned horror film (although
splatter-free, the film retains an uncertain "I Spit on Your Grave"-type
quality), the producers felt that this technique would result in some
genuine scares.</P>
<P>        Is it scary?  Yes.  But scary in that constantly looking outside
the corners of the screen to avoid jumping out of your skin way, not the
identifying with--and caring about the fates of--our leading players way.</P>
<P>        Here's the good idea that went a wastin'.  In October of 1994, a
trio of student filmmakers descended into the woods near Burkittsville,
Maryland in order to shoot a documentary about the legendary Blair Witch.
They were never seen or heard from again.  Their "discovered footage"
serves as the basis for the film that is about to unfold, "The Blair Witch
Project."</P>
<P>        Here's how its execution let it down.  Heather, the documentary
director (played by newcomer Heather Donahue), is a bit of a bossy boots
with a dictatorial approach to the project that begins to irritate early
on.  She quickly starts annoying her fellow filmmakers, Josh (newcomer
Joshua Leonard) and Mike (newcomer Michael C. Williams), and alienating her
audience.  Heather insists she knows where they are at all times but soon
enough it becomes clear they are lost.  In addition, Heather is obsessively
true to her medium, and refuses to turn off their color video camera, their
b/w 16mm camera, or their digital tape recorder.  So that when things start
to get scary--read on--Heather's right there with one of the cameras stuck
in a crew member's face, often while she's screaming "What the heck is
that!?" or more colorful words to that effect.</P>
<P>        If the circumstances in which our protagonists find themselves are
as horrifying as suggested then it defies all rational and logical behavior
for Heather to keep her camera rolling, no matter how dedicated an auteur
she may be.</P>
<P>        Donahue, Leonard, and Williams are clearly all amateurs and when
the going gets tough, their collective acting talents disintegrate.  The
supporting characters who play the Burkittsville (formerly Blair) yokels,
and provide interview-styled accounts of what they know about the Blair
Witch, are also unconvincing.  For a film like this to work, they need to
be absolutely believable as real people.</P>
<P>        After a while, the film becomes frustrating in its repetitiveness.
During the day, the threesome constantly bitch and moan about how lost they
are, whose fault it is, and what happened to the damned map.  They head due
south for a day and wind up in the same spot as when they started, all the
time following their compass.  At night, they hear strange noises all
around them and go rushing out of their tent screaming "Oh my God!" lit
only by a dim camera bulb, the black-and-white trees positively encroaching
on their frightened persons.  In the morning, there are little piles of
stones or twigs surrounding their camp.  If you're afraid of little piles
of stones or twigs then I guess this is one heck of a scary movie!</P>
<P>        This cycle then repeats itself over and over again.  Whine whine,
scream scream, stones twigs.</P>
<P>        "The Blair Witch Project" relies heavily on the power of implied
horror, meaning it's something of an anomaly in today's day and age, yet as
a result it's the kind of movie you can really only see once to appreciate
(or not).  Whereas I can truly understand what filmmakers Daniel Myrick and
Eduardo Sánchez were trying to achieve with this film, they made too many
mistakes along the way.</P>
