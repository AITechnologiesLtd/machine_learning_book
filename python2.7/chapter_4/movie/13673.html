<PRE>The Life of Emile Zola (1937)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 93</PRE>
<P>"The Life of Emile Zola" is an outstanding film
about the Dreyfus affair, which was a major
military scandal in France during the late
1890s.  Since it is a movie and not a documentary,
some of the characterizations and events may
not match the historical record. However, any
artistic license has only resulted in a better
film.</P>
<P>Versatile actor Paul Muni plays Emile Zola,
whose story begins as a struggling French author.
He finds wealth and fame writing controversial
books, and becomes the conscience of France.
In his middle age, he becomes complacent and
materialistic, disappointing those who see him
as an agent of social change.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the French army discovers that a high
ranking officer is giving military secrets to the
Germans.  Dreyfus is arbitrarily found guilty of
treason, is publicly humiliated, and sentenced to
miserable imprisonment at Devil's Island.  Soon
thereafter, military officers learn the true
identify of the agent, but begin a massive and
determined campaign to cover up their mistake,
which includes exonerating the guilty officer.</P>
<P>After encouragement by his politically active
friends, Zola finally takes up the cause of Dreyfus,
putting him in conflict with the French Army,
which has the power to put Zola in prison.</P>
<P>Although the title "The Life of Emile Zola" implies
a biography, the film is largely about the Dreyfus
affair.  Since the subject is of little interest
to most Americans, then and now, it is surprising
that Warner Brothers even made this film, much less
gave it such high production values.  Although Muni
is obscure today, he was a major actor at the
time, having just won the Oscar for Best Actor for
"The Story of Louis Pasteur", another high-brow
film set in nineteenth-century France.  Muni would
be nominated for Best Actor for "Zola" as well.
During his career he would amass five Best Actor
Oscar nominations.</P>
<P>The message of "Zola" is universal, and applies
to any place or time.  Government officials, in
this case Army officers, whose primary goal is
to retain power, will stop at nothing to punish
opposition and manipulate the public through
propaganda.  It takes courage to oppose a
corrupt government, and your actions can be
villified rather than lauded.  The French public
did not want Dreyfus found innocent, as he had
become a handy target for national bigotry and
frustration.</P>
<P>Dreyfus' religion is only mentioned once, and
if you blink you will miss it.  The army brass,
looking for a traitor, peruse a list of officers.
The entry for Dreyfus notes his religion, Jew.
The head officer points his finger at the word
Jew, and says, "This is our man."  The focus
of "Zola" is on political corruption rather than
religious prosecution.</P>
