<P>CrankyCritic® movie reviews: Sugar Town
Rated [R], 93 minutes
Starring Rosanna Arquette, Ally Sheedy, Beverly D'Angelo, Jade Gordon,
Michael Des Barres, John Taylor, John Doe and Martin Kemp
Written and Directed by Allison Anders and Kurt Voss</P>
<PRE>IN SHORT: Dynamite.</PRE>
<P>It's been a generation since Cranky worked in the music biz -- I know
it's a generation because one of the principal characters in Allison
Anders' first rate flick Sugar Town refers to Stevie Nicks as "a cool
old guy." Outside of the age gap, nothing much has changed in the world
of rock and roll. Naked ambition, sheer ego, self deception, junkies,
plane crashes and all natural living come together in perfectly matched
multiple stories that fill this flick. It is the highest compliment I
can pay to co-writer/directors Anders and Kurt Voss that they not only
nail the scene and the inhabitants thereof, they at no time let their
innate knowledge of the biz get in the way of telling a good story.</P>
<P>No, I take that back. Stories. Easily a half dozen of 'em, all stocked
with well defined characters and a whole passel of surprises. It's the
kind of work that Robert Altman does well and, considering my mixed
feelings about Anders' Grace of My Heart, a major improvement and a
delightful slice of life tale of folk both rising and falling in the
Hollywood entertainment industries.</P>
<P>We start with Liz (Ally Sheedy) a thirtysomething film production
designer whose biological clock is ticking so loudly that it's making
her neurotic and scaring away potential dates. Her best friend Eva
(Rosanna Arquette) is an actress watching a career go up in flames --
once the sexy ingenue type, now she's being offered a role as Christina
Ricci's mother. Her husband Clive (John Taylor, ex Duran Duran and Power
Station) is a Brit rock star of the 80s who, with other also rans Nick
and Jonesy (Michael Des Barres, ex Power Station and Martin Kemp, ex
Spandau Ballet) is shopping a last chance demo deal with the aid of
producer Burt (Larry Klein, a real life composer and Grammy Award
winning producer) and still waiting to be paid session player Carl (John
Doe of X).</P>
<P>Not to mention Carl's eight months pregnant wife Kate (Lucinda Jenney);
the sexy Latina () whose tour he's playing on, and who wouldn't mind
playing him; Jane, the rich widow (Beverly D'Angelo) who wants to nail
the one rocker who won't sleep with any woman older than 21 and Clive's
heretofore unknown ten year old son Nerve (Vincent Berry) who's dropped
off at dad's doorstep when his groupie mom goes off to join an ashram.</P>
<P>Crossing paths with almost all of these characters is Gwen (Jade Gordon)
the would be rock goddess who will lie, cheat, steal, swindle,
manipulate, plagiarize -- you get the picture -- so that she can flaunt
her inevitable fame in front of the boys who turned her down in High
School and now repair Slurpee machines. Cranky dated a woman just like
Gwen, way back when. She's now working for a superstar and I'm reliving
old nightmares <g> 'cuz Gordon's work is spot on, as is everyone else in
the cast. For those who are playing roles similar to their real lives,
creating a separate character is a very difficult thing because you
can't help being anything but self-conscious of the parallels. If the
Anders/Voss script hadn't provided detailed backgrounds for all of 'em,
this project could have fallen flat as a barely covered and badly told
retelling of real events, which was my feeling about Grace of My Heart.</P>
<P>I have no such reservations about Sugar Town.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Sugar Town, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$7.00</PRE>
<P>Anders and Voss wrote the script in two weeks, finished the production
in six months and boasted of the fact at Sundance. As have a lot of
other boasts that have come out of that festival, that almost red
flagged Sugar Town as "sure to suck." It doesn't suck. Mightily.</P>
