THE PIANO (1993)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Last decade of this dying century was rather harsh for many
people who used to live in my part of the world, especially
if those people were civic-minded intellectuals or
technocrats. For them, it was natural to seek happiness
somewhere else and one spot on the other side of the globe
became very popular. New Zealand, with its nice climate,
thriving economy and plenty of job opportunities, became
sort of promised land for many people who wanted to improve
their life. Perhaps some of them would change their mind and
not see New Zealand as paradise on Earth after watching
PIANO, Award-winning 1993 melodrama by Jane Campion.</P>
<P>The heroine of the film, set in 1852, is Ada (played by
Holly Hunter), beautiful woman who was sent from Scotland in
order to be wed to Stewart (Sam Neill), New Zealand colonist
and wealthy landowner. With her, Ada to the cold, rainy and
muddy colony brings her 9-year (presumably illegitimate)
daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) and huge piano. For Ada, piano
is very important, because since the age of 6 she refused to
speak and the music is her only form of expression. However,
Stewart doesn't see the importance of the piano for his
bride, and he leaves her instrument on the beech. Bains
(Harvey Keitel), Stewart's neighbour, rough, illiterate man
who had adopted Maori ways, falls in love with Ada and
realises how important piano is for her. So he trades gives
some land to Stewart in exchange for piano, and later
arranges for Ada to give him piano lessons. He than offers
her to get her piano back, in exchange for sexual favours.
Ada complies, but soon Stewart finds the truth and all leads
to dramatic and violent finale.</P>
<P>In its time, THE PIANO was a film adored by critics, and it
is very easy to explain why. Superb cinematography by Stuart
Dryburgh with its use of blue and grey tones gives a right,
depressive tone of the film, with very good contrast
provided by warmer colours during the love scenes. Costumes
by Janet Patterson give the right period feel. Finally,
acting is excellent. Holly Hunter deserved her "Oscar", no
matter how her role of a cripple looked like standard
Academy choice for best performance. Anna Paquin, who, by
receiving the golden statuette with the age of 9, broke
record for youngest Award winner, is also very good,
although overshadowed by her better and more experience
co-worker. But the true gem of the film is Harvey Keitel,
who spares no effort in order to portray the complex and
transforming character of Bains as realistically as
possible. Sam Neill, who got the thankless role of a
husband, hardly can do anything to match their talent.
Finally, the entire feel of the film is provided by an
excellent musical score by Michael Nyman, one of the best
and most memorable in the recent decade.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, having many good or excellent doesn't mean
that the movie must be good or excellent as a whole. In case
of THE PIANO, it happened most probably because the writer
and director Jane Campion had the right ideas in her
"Oscar"-awarded screenplay, but lacked the ability to make
it understandable to the audience. This story was very
romantic in nature, displaying the conflict between the
individual and conformist society, and even more universal
one, conflict between passion and reason. However, for me,
this film was actually done great disservice with the
overkill of feminism (quite understandable, because the film
was made during the peak of Political Correctness era), and
by making the character of Ada too bizarre and unbelievable.
Also, the character of Flora could have easily been left out
of picture. Jane Campion makes confusion even greater with
some bad editing during the film, and by some sudden and
gratuitous violence and pointless, although visually
impressive finale that lacks any emotional catharsis, at
least when the author of this review is concerned. Many of
those flaws would be easier to tolerate if Campion had
worked a little bit harder to make this film pleasing to the
eye. Her naturalistic approach only made those flaws more
obvious. Despite that, THE PIANO is still good film to
watch, but only if we can stop thinking that it should have
been much better.</P>
