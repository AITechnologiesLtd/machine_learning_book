                               TOTAL RECALL
                            [Probable Spoilers]
                          Reviewer: Jaye Mathisen
                        Copyright 1990 Jaye Mathisen</PRE>
<P>Summary:
     Sometime in the future, Douglas Quaid finds out that he's not
     who he remembers himself to be.  From there, the plot takes a
     downturn into aliens, violence, Mars,violence, air on Mars,
     violence, and memory implants.</P>
<P>     Up until now, I've always liked Schwarzenegger movies.  They're
usually not too intellectual, have lots of action, lots of violence,
babes, guns, chases, muscles, and all the other good things that make an
action film an action film.  Until now.  While TOTAL RECALL had lots of
violence, the special effects got in the way of what could have been a
good movie.  It doesn't bother me to watch people get hung, shot, karate
chopped, or what-have-you, but gallons of blood spraying everywhere tend
to be distracting, rather than "entertaining".  I know I'm not squeamish
about blood (having worked for a fire department and an ambulance
company), but slow-mo of globules of blood flying through the air just
doesn't do it for me.</P>
<P>     The plot of TOTAL RECALL is okay, right up to where Schwarzenegger
gets to Mars.  (The plot's complicated, I'm not going to attempt to
explain it.)  The memory implantation stuff reminded me of the many and
various SF books that deal with "sensies," or "feelies."  (Movies/things
that allow you to sense what the characters on the screen sense).  Some
poor special effects of people in a vacuum, outright ridiculousness of
the ending, and the lack of believability in the story-line in general
ruined it.</P>
<PRE>Rating:
     What's to say? A fairly good idea for a plot, ruined by special
     effects, gore, and stupidity. 1 star (*,poor) on the 1 to 4 star
     scale.</PRE>
<P>Enjoyability
     Bleeech!  When I go to a movie, I like to "immerse" myself in
     what's happening on the screen.  Movies like STAR WARS and
     friends, I can believe, because it's way beyond where we're at,
     but is nice to think about.  TOTAL RECALL on the other hand, was
     hard to believe in.  "Aliens build air-producing reactor, that
     creates a perfectly breathable atmosphere in every detail for
     the human life form, on a planet-wide scale, in a matter of
     seconds, by converting old fashioned ice at the core of planet,
     into life-giving oxygen.  This air-producing reactor hasn't been
     tested, and the switch to turn it on is a large ball that you
     put your hand into.  Film at 11."  Naaaah.  1 star out of 4.</P>
