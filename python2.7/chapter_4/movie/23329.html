<P>GET REAL (M).  
(NewVision)
Director: Simon Shore
Stars: Ben Silverstone, Brad Gorton, Charlotte Briitain, Stacy A Hart, 
Kate McEnery, Tim Harris, James D White, Patrick Nielsen, Louise J Taylor
Running time: 110 minutes.</P>
<P>Inevitably, it seems that every new British drama exploring
the traumatic coming out experience of gay teens will be compared with
the marvellous Beautiful Thing.  However, Get Real is good enough to
stand on its own, without the baggage that such a lazy and often
odious comparison brings.</P>
<P>Based on Patrick Wilde's semi-autobiographical play What's
Wrong With Angry?, Get Real treats its emotionally charged and
potentially contentious subject matter with wonderful touches of
humour and insight.  This delightful and entertaining film offers a
warm and engaging portrait of teen angst that will also appeal to more
mainstream audiences.  Get Real is also a refreshing change from the
bland high school comedies offered up by Hollywood in recent years.</P>
<P>The film explores the romantic dilemma of 16 year old Stephen
Carter (played with winning charm and style by Ben Silverstone, last
seen briefly as the young Humbert in the controversial remake of
Lolita), who just happens to be gay.  The only person who knows his
secret and his habit of trolling local beats is Linda (Charlotte
Brittain), his next door neighbour and best friend.</P>
<P>Then a chance encounter leads Stephen to discover that John
(newcomer Brad Gorton), the handsome school jock, is also gay.  A
romance develops between the pair, although the need to keep their
affair secret places great pressure on the pair.  But while Stephen
wants to shout his love for John from the rooftops, John is more
cautious, fearing the knowledge he is gay will damage his reputation
and status at school.  Eventually Stephen finally finds the courage to
make a hard choice, one that will shake up the complacency of his
parents and his school mates.</P>
<P>This deftly written film explores issues of peer pressure,
homophobia, prejudice, and questions of sexual identity with the kind
of honesty and understanding that comes from bitter personal
experience.  Get Real contains a number of quite moving moments, but
it is also a remarkably warm and very funny film.  First time feature
director Simon Shore handles the material with a great deal of
understanding and compassion.</P>
<P>The performances from the young and largely unknown cast are
all solid.  Silverstone beautifully captures Stephen's vulnerability,
angst and confusion with a well rounded performance.  Brittain
delivers a wonderfully rich and sympathetic performance as Linda -
fat, frumpy, lonely but filled with generous spirit - and she provides
the film with much of its engaging humour.</P>
<P>An entertaining and compassionate treatment of the
complexities surrounding gay teens and the problems of coming out, Get
Real is a genial, winning comedy that easily overcomes the mistaken
notion that gay themed films are of limited appeal.</P>
