<PRE>                                   TWISTER
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        There's one predominant theme I've picked up on in the 
multiple other TWISTER reviews I've already read in magazines, 
newspapers and even this newsgroup -- that, although it has 
some of the most incredible special effects ever recorded on film, 
the melodramatic scenes that tie those sequences together are 
laughable and unoriginal. And, after seeing it for myself, I have 
to agree, which makes me unoriginal while hopefully still 
laughable.</P>
<P>        Bill Paxton plays a former storm chaser who now wants to 
start over with a new wife, new career, even a new car. But when he 
brings the final divorce papers over to his wife, Jo (Helen Hunt), the 
signing is interrupted by the sighting of a tornado. So Jo and her 
colleagues pack up and drive after the storm and Bill has to follow 
along because, hey, Jo still has the divorce papers. Chasing the one 
tornado, and eventually being trapped right under it, is enough to get 
Bill back into the game, leaving his fiancee, Melissa, to ride in the van 
with a slob named Dusty while he and Jo go chasing afto deploy Dorothy, an</P>
<P>invention of Bill's that looks like one of those Regina Steamer Carpet 
Cleaners with a bunch of metallic bingo balls inside. The bingo balls 
are actually sensors which, when scattered around the inside of a 
tornado, will send back measurements of wind velocity, speed... and 
who the hell cares? It's just a plot device to get Bill and Jo underneath 
five separate tornadoes over a period of twenty-four hours. Most of us 
go through life without ever being witness to one tornado, but I don't 
mind idiots like these lowering the odds by taking five blows in the 
same day, and I'm not talking about [insert any oversexed stud's name 
here].</P>
<P>        So Bill, Jo and their entourage track down tornadoes all over 
Oklahoma in an attempt to get close enough to dump Dorothy in the 
tornado's path, which obviously won't happen until the very end. The 
whole while, evil scientist Jonas (Cary Elwes) has stolen Bill's idea by 
creating the DOT3, which does much the same thing except with 
cubed sensors instead of the more conventional round ones. How do 
we know he and his boys are evil? They drive black vans... and they 
have corporate sponsorship. "Jonas loves money, not science," Bill 
sneers, as if other people don't look down on rednecks who get off 
chasing tornadoes.</P>
<P>        The Jonas situation is supposed to bring some level of 
man-vs.-man conflict into the movie to offset the man-vs.-nature 
conflict, but it's sure resolved fast, and in a definite man-vs.-nature 
way. Then there's the constant annoyance of Bill and Jo, who fight 
for the required amount of time until the tornadoes come along to 
relieve them of their plot obligations, and then make out at the right 
time to conveniently tie up the plot obligations. All the subplots in 
the movie are lame and ridiculous, but we don't care. It's like the 
FRIDAY THE 13TH movies ( <A HREF="http://www.missouri.edu/~c667778/friday.htm">http://www.missouri.edu/~c667778/friday.htm</A> ) 
we sit through all the mindless crap to get to the good stuff.</P>
<P>        Luckily, the good stuff is indeed good. The filmmakers 
knew that humans are fascinated by natural disasters, and that 
enough special effects sequences showing those natural disasters 
could carry the movie, so that was the rule they followed. All the 
effort went into the tornado scenes, which is painfully obvious but 
easily overlooked and forgotten every time we do get to the good 
stuff. TWISTER is no JURASSIC PARK but it does offer genuine 
scares aing effects sequences. Unlike JURASSIC PARK, 
though, there is nothing entertaining outside of the intense action 
scenes.</P>
