<P>_Sweet_and_Lowdown_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>"Lowdown" describes the main character in Woody Allen's annual project,
an anecdotal look at the life of Emmet Ray (Sean Penn), a gifted jazz
guitarist from the '30s whose skills and talent rank second only to his
idol, gypsy Django Reinhardt.  While he cries while listening to Django's
recordings and had fainted the two times he had seen him in person, the
true number one in Emmet's book is Emmet himself.  Boozy, a jerk to
everyone around him, and legendarily self-absorbed, it's amazing that
Emmet's story has ever been told before.</P>
<P> The reason why it hasn't is simple: Emmet is a completely fictional
character, and the documentary-style talking head introductions to the
film's individual vignettes (by jazz historians and enthusiasts,
including Allen himself) go a long way in convincing the audience of the
film's truth.  Adding to the authenticity are the performances.  Penn is
hilarious as the pompous Emmet, but even better is the "sweet" component
of the film's title: Samantha Morton, who plays Emmet's long-suffering
laundress girlfriend Hattie--who happens to be mute.  Morton is an
absolute delight, and her marvelously cute and expressive face speak
volumes more than any lines of dialogue ever could.  There's a reason why
"sweet" comes before "lowdown" in the title, and Morton is it.</P>
