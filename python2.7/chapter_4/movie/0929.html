<PRE>                                 THE NASTY GIRL
                       A film review by Myra VanInwegen
                        Copyright 1991 Myra VanInwegen</PRE>
<PRE>Extremely brief assessment:</PRE>
<P>     This is one of the best movies I've seen - as good as (just to name
a few of my semi-recent picks) CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS or Imamura's
BLACK RAIN.  It is the only movie I have ever seen that has a heroine
whom I would very much like to be, or to try to imitate.</P>
<P>     Basic plot (no spoilers, unless you think any plot description is a
spoiler):</P>
<P>     This movie tells the story of Sonya, a girl whose intelligence and
willfulness make her hard to control.  However, despite the title of the
movie, she is a very nice girl, a good girl, who excels in her classes
and is the pride of the town.  That is, as long as the town's definition
of "good" matches her own.</P>
<P>     This movie is really two films in one.  The first part is
wonderfully light and funny, recounting the mishaps of a girl growing up
in a Catholic family in a small town in Bavaria.  The other part begins
as she starts doing research for an essay on "My Hometown During the
Third Reich."  The film rapidly grows serious, and the humor of the
first half is replaced by frustration, hatred, and even danger as the
film progresses.</P>
<P>     Technical notes (you might want to skip this if you want to be
surprised by the structure of the film):</P>
<P>     The film is told as sort of a flashback, with the present-day Sonya
narrating.  Color, or the lack of it, is used to show time periods here.
Black-and-white is used for Sonya's childhood, color for the present,
and, in one brief sequence, sepia for "way back when."  If I remember
right, the film turns from b&w (the past) to color (the present) about
when the Third Reich essay is announced, that is, when the film changes
mood from funny to serious.  This marks the transition from childhood to
adulthood for Sonya.</P>
<P>     The sets used when Sonya is dealing with the "establishment" - the
locals who continually try to thwart her - use a minimum of furniture (a
desk, a chair) with a painting or slide behind to suggest the rest of
room in which the action takes place.  Perhaps this suggests the
illusions on which these people have based their power.</P>
<PRE>     All in all, this is an excellent film. See it.</PRE>
