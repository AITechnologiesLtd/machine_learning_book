<P>The DVD format is perfect for a film like "Mission: Impossible 2."
Through the wonders of DVD, you can savor the thrilling opening scenes,
hop, skip and jump through the sluggish center section, then enjoy the
walloping non-stop action of the last 40 minutes or so of the feature.
Just for the hell of it, you could even use the fast forward button to
boost the various slow motion shots back to normal speed (which would
likely make the film a good 10 minutes shorter). Of course, "M: I-2"
won't be available on DVD for six to eight months, so, in the meantime,
viewers will just have to suffer through the dull stuff in exchange for
the juicy moments. It's a fair trade.</P>
<P>"Mission: Impossible 2" marks the much anticipated meeting of legendary
action Director John Woo ("Face/Off", "Broken Arrow"), Tom Cruise and
the "M:I" franchise. Woo hurls every one of his trademarks into the
fray: martial arts, gorgeous slo-mo, birds taking flight, billowing
clothing, swirling camerawork and operatic violence, all set to a
thunderous score. In fact, Woo even winks at the audience this time
around: During one particularly tense scene, he positions sitting birds
around darkened hallways, making us wonder when they will take
Woo-flight and reveal our furtive hero's presence to the bad guys.</P>
<P>Where the first "Mission: Impossible" suffered from an overcomplicated
plot, matters are more straightforward this time around. Impossible
Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) finds his vacation interrupted
by a crisis of potentially global proportion. Renegade agent Sean
Ambrose (Dougray Scott) is out to steal a horrific Ebola-like virus
called Chimera, developed by an evil pharmaceutical company so they can
cash in on the antidote. To aide in his quest, Hunt recruits super thief
Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), Ambrose's former honey-bunny. Needless to
say, Hunt and Hall become an item almost immediately. With veteran
computer expert Luther Stikell (Ving Rhames, the only actor besides
Cruise to return from the first film) providing backup, the chase is on.</P>
<P>The film opens in high style, with a confrontation above the clouds that
guarantees that "M: I-2" will never be shown as an airline movie. Cut to
Ethan Hunt on holiday, climbing a beautiful, harrowing red rock face
thousands of feet above the earth (Cruise insisted on doing his own
stunt work for the scene and the result is unusually exhilarating).
After Hunt receives his mission instructions (delivered by Anthony
Hopkins in an uncredited cameo), Woo jumps to the titles, then to stars,
then to Spain for the next sequence, which introduces Thandie Newton.
It's a great beginning, followed, unfortunately, by a long draggy
stretch. Aside from a playful car chase, not much happens for far too
many minutes.</P>
<P>Beyond the laborious plot mechanics, there are relationship problems.
While Cruise and Newton make a fine couple, Ethan Hunt and Nyah Hall
bond too quickly to create a sense of emotional weight. The instant
intimacy between the pair hurts the later proceedings; each of them is
willing to make enormous sacrifices for the other, but it doesn't quite
feel credible. To a lesser degree, Hunt and Ambrose suffer from the same
trouble. We see a fury between them that goes beyond the simple good
guy-bad guy dynamic, but the source of the intense personal animosity is
not explained. A little more information would have helped enormously.</P>
<P>Instead, we get seething looks and a dull mid-section, with the
wonderful Ving Rhames relegated to the background to keep the lead hero,
the lead heroine and the lead villain squarely in the spotlight. Despite
the rubber masks and messages that will self-destruct in five seconds,
this film is more 007 than Impossible Missions Force, with Tom Cruise as
the Bond du jour. While Cruise is more than up to the task, I missed the
teamwork that made the TV series (does anyone even remember the TV
series at this point?) so much fun.</P>
<P>For the last 40 minutes of "M: I-2," John Woo pulls out all the stops
and delivers the kind of action that should have been spaced throughout
the entire film. The man remains a master of style, as evidenced by the
flames reflected in Ambrose's eyes, a single bird flying through a fiery
door and a phenomenal motorcycle duel. Woo needs to be careful – if he
continues repeating stock flourishes, he risks self-parody – but for
this film, they still pay off. "Mission: Impossible 2" lacks emotional
punch and the center section sorely tried my patience, but the film
remains a hell of a ride.</P>
