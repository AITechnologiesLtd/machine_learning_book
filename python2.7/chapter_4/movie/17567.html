<PRE>Cruel Intentions</PRE>
<PRE>Written and Directed by Roger Kumble</PRE>
<P>Based on the Novel "Les Liasons Dangereuses" by Choderlos de Laclos</P>
<PRE>Starring:
 Ryan Phillippe
 Sarah Michelle Gellar
 Reese Withsersppon
 Selma Blair
 Joshua Jackson</PRE>
<P>    What have horror movies taught us?  I guess they have taught us what we
already know, that diluting the same idea that may have at one point been
good isn't a good idea.  Think of it.  All of the franchises, with the
exception of Scream, which is only on its second installment, and, thanks to
the grace of Kevin Williamson, has remained fresh in its sequel, have
bitterly failed.</P>
<P>    Perhaps it makes sense that the only people who would star in a redo of
an idea used at least four times before (3 adaptations of Dangerous Liaisons
and the indie smash In the Company of Men) area all veterans of horror
movies.  Phillippe and Gellar starred together in I Know What You Did Last
Summer.  Witherspoon was in Fear and Freeway, and in the anticipated
American Psycho.</P>
<P>    However -- and maybe this is just the reparations paid by fate -- Cruel
Intentions comes out as a good-luck charm.  The movie, although lacking the
literary content of other films with the same plot, is as entertaining a sex
comedy as you get to see from a studio.  The acting is actually half-decent,
perhaps the most monumental achievement of the film considering the odds it
has against it:</P>
<P>    For one, it has a first-time director.  For two, we have not one but
three stars from the WB network, whose motto should be "good ideas, bad
actors."  For three, we have Ryan Phillipe, someone who has never once had a
good role and, like most of the brat pack of 90s actors, most likely never
will.  Perhaps they were inspired by Reese Witherspoon's convincing
performance as a virgin, which actually is a great showcase of her
versatility considering, only a few months ago, she starred as a slut in the
overlooked creative mind-exercise Pleasantville.</P>
<P>    The plot, as I've said, is shared with three adaptations of Dangerous
Liaisons and with the indie In the Company of Men.  Basically, bad bitch
sister Kathryn Merteuil (Sarah Michelle Gellar, returning to her soap-opera
roots) makes a bet with her step-brother Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Phillippe):
seduce the new headmaster's daughter, Annette (Reese Witherspoon), and
incest will become a New York debutante's common practice.  Fail, and she
gets his '57 Roadster.  Now, with most women, this wouldn't be worth it,
but, hey, we're talking about Sarah Michelle Gellar.</P>
<P>    Basically, Gellar is completely enjoyable as a bitch extraordinaire.  He
new motto for acting (aside from the fact that it would plagiarize Mae
West): "When I'm good, I'm really good.  When I'm bad, I'm better."  A nice
fun subplot in the movie, that gives it the majority of its humor, is
Sebastian's "awakening" of Cecile, yet another virgin Gellar seeks to
destroy (for stealing a boyfriend she blew), which leads to most of the sex
in this film, not to mention the best snippet of popcorn film conversation
I've heard in 1999:</P>
<P>    Cecile: This doesn't taste like iced tea.
    Sebastian: It's from Long Island.</P>
<P>    Unfortunately, the story decides not to rely on the acerbic wit that
newcomer Roger Kumble inserts into his film, but instead on…(ominous tones)
ROMANCE.  As the relationship between Sebastain and Annette becomes more
sweet and chick-flick, the movie takes a turn for the worse, ending on a low
note.</P>
<P>    Also, for all movie buffs who think they know the ending from the
trailer: you probably do.</P>
<P>    Predictable to a T, Cruel Intentions is nonetheless and enjoyable
popcorn film.  Maybe it's just the Y-chromosome in me: this film does house
a vast repertoire of sex for an R rating (lesbian kiss, etc.).  Maybe it's
just the fact that I munch popcorn and need a film to munch it in.  But
either way, Cruel Intentions is a fun film to see.</P>
