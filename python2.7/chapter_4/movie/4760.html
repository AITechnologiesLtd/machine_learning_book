<PRE>                                    THE POSTMAN
                       A film review by Christopher Boone
                        Copyright 1996 Christopher Boone</PRE>
<P>Directed by Michael Radford
Produced by Mario Cecchi Gori, Vittorio Cecchi Gori,
and Gaetano Daniele
Written by Anna Pavignano, Michael Radford, Furio Scarpelli,
Giacomo Scarpetti, and Massimo Troisi.
Based on the book by Antonio Skarmeta
Music by Luis Enriquez Bacalov
Cinematography by Franco DiGiacomo</P>
<P>Now showing in major cities, and re-released for a second time in select 
theatres on Friday, February 16, 1996 for a limited run.</P>
<P>        12 hours after filming the final scene of IL POSTINO, Massimo 
Troisi passed away due to a fatal disease that he was well aware was 
eating away at him.  It has been said that he bought the rights to this 
book because he knew he was going to die, and he wanted to act in a 
serious role after becoming well known as a comedic actor in Italy.  The 
biggest tragedy of this film is that Troisi never saw what he had 
accomplished.</P>
<P>        Nominated for Best Actor (Massimo Troisi), Best Adapted 
Screenplay, Best Music, Best Director, and Best Picture for this year's 
Academy Awards, IL POSTINO has won the battle that few films ever must 
attempt--to be a foreign film nominated for the Best Picture Oscar along 
side other American film (or English speaking film) nominees.  Due to a 
technicality that IL POSTINO was released in Italy in 1994, and therefore 
not eligible to be nominated by Italy for the Best Foreign Film Oscar, 
Miramax spent $1.5 million and sent tons of videos to members of the 
Academy to get this film seen and nominated.  This is why.</P>
<P>        Mario Ruoppolo (Massimo Troisi) is a fisherman's son who becomes 
a postman due to his father nagging him about not having a job.  He has 
one customer, Nobel Prize for Literature nominee and exiled Communist 
Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (Philippe Noiret).  Neruda is living in Italy on 
Ruoppolo's island while in exile, so Ruoppolo rides his bicycle to his 
house every day to deliver the mail.  Soon thereafter, Ruoppolo befriends 
Neruda, and with his simple way of thinking, learns to appreciate 
Neruda's poetry and share his thoughts with the poet.  He employs 
Neruda's help to win over a woman he has fallen for, Beatrice Russo.  
Through Neruda's help and poetry, Ruoppolo attempts to win her heart.  
Enough with the spoilers.</P>
<P>        This film is crafted with a tender spirit.  Throughout, if you 
know Troisi's story, you realize how gaunt he looks.  His stubble does 
not mask his dying.  This is his final performance, and both he and the 
audience know it.  His character comes alive as if it wasn't a character 
at all, but rather simply Troisi expressing his feelings for a woman in 
his own shy, confused way.  Opposite Noiret, known to this critic best 
for his portrayal of Alfredo in CINEMA PARADISO (this critic's favorite 
film of all time) an accomplished actor, Troisi shines, and steals the 
screen from him.  It is hard not to think about his impending death as 
the film comes to an ironic close, and Neruda's poetry rolls up the screen.</P>
<P>        Many reviews have been written about this film, so I will not 
write a lengthy one.  I will leave it at that.  If you have not yet seen 
IL POSTINO, search your newspaper for the nearest art house cinema, and 
go see it in its second re-release in less than a year.  Take some 
friends, and tell the rest.  You'll quickly realize why the Academy went 
out of its way for this film.</P>
