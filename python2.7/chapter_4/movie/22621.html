<P>The Cider House Rules (1999) by John Sylva    Rating: A</P>
<P>What is the true purpose of film?  If you ask me, the true goal of a film is to
affect the viewer to no end, letting them feel the storyline and the
characters, making them feel what they are watching is genuine.  No genre of
film affects me, or succeeds at this, more than one, that being the priceless
coming of age story.  If well executed, a coming of age film will soak you in
its plot, absorb you in its characters, deliver a satisfying, often heart
warming resolution, and leave you hypnotized, dying for more of its magnificent
treasures.  Director Lasse Hallstrom ("What's Eating Gilbert Gape") brings us
"The Cider House Rules", an uplifting, inspirational tale about finding
yourself, finding yourself and discovering to truly live for the first time. 
Based on his novel of the same name, John Irving pens the screenplay of this
warm drama, filling his masterful script with unspeakable emotion, power, and
three-dimensional characters who are put to life by a stellar cast.  All of the
characteristics I named that should be included within a wonderful coming of
age drama are gone above and beyond in "Cider," which stands as one of the, if
not the, best films of 1999.</P>
<P>Set in the war stricken mid 1940's, the beginning scenes of "The Cider House
Rules", which play like a first chapter to the film of sorts, set up the
magical story at a peaceful, isolated St. Clouds, Maine orphanage, where Homer
Wells (Tobey Maguire) has resided his entire life.  He was born in that
orphanage, left to be up for adoption, but through his childhood years, he
never found a permanent family other than the family he had at the busy, large,
cozy building where he had grown up in.  The only mother or father figure Homer
ever has had is the caring, gentle Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) who has
worked as a doctor in the orphanage for decades.  As he has grown, Dr. Larch
teaches Homer the basics of being a doctor, and gives him the honor of
delivering a number of babies, and being his assistant.  In the film's opening
minutes, we get to know a number of children who await their adoption, and we
are allowed to feel the close bond that they have with Homer, and in turn a
close bond with the viewer, as they look up to him as a father figure, for he's
been with them their entire lives, and win the audience's hearts with their
attractive personalities and wonderful dialogue. </P>
<P>In the film's second "chapter," soldier Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) and Candy
Kendall (Charlize Theron), a high class couple, arrive at the orphanage to have
an abortion performed, but after this task is finished, the welcoming couple
instantly befriend Homer, taking him with them back to their hometown.  Thus
begins a new chapter in Homer's life, leaving the one place he could call home
to see the world for the first time.  From here, Homer looks for his place in
life, something different than the life that he left, which was somewhat
restricted.  Eventually, after Wally is called to duty for the War, a romance
is sparked between Candy and Homer, resulting in Homer's first true love.  As
the relationship between Candy and Homer strengthens, Homer becomes a pro apple
picker with number of African American workers who don't accept the first timer
at first, but end up becoming close to him.</P>
<P>The character of Homer Wells is an amusing, curious one, much like the
characters were in last year's coming of age drama "Pleasantville."  Like the
characters in the underrated â€˜98 flick, Homer is a stranger to the world. 
He's never seen a lobster, never seen the ocean.  "Cider" takes Homer on an
extraordinary journey about getting a taste of life for the first time, and
becoming a man.</P>
<P>At the ripe age of 24, Tobey Maguire is undoubtedly the most natural male actor
under the age of thirty, rehearsing his characters effortlessly.  Robbed of any
recognition for his role in last year's splendid "Pleasantville," Maguire
shines in "The Cider House Rules," letting you relate and feel for his
character who grows mentally throughout the powerful course of the film. 
Michael Caine gives a strong, Oscar worthy performance as his sickly character,
rehearsing his lines boldly and realistically.  The standout performance is
from Charlize Theron, who has that old fashioned movie star look and feel about
her, giving her strongest, most memorable and likable turn as an actress yet.</P>
<P>"The Cider House Rules" is beautifully shot, capturing the true beauty of fine
Massachusetts landscapes. (It was filmed in Massachusetts, but set in Maine.) 
Set against some of the most memorable, hauntingly beautiful settings in a film
this year, "The Cider House Rules" is an uplifting film that couldn't have been
better.  The musical score helps to give "Cider" an old fashioned,
inspirational feel to it that leaves a smile  spread across your face once the
credits start rolling.  Within its 131 minute running time, the film tells the
story of finding your place in life, finding close friendships from those who
you would least expect, bonding with a different race, doing the right thing,
and eventually letting go of things you've experienced.  But over all of its
high qualities, perhaps the element I admire most about "The Cider House Rules"
is the fact that it portrays characters as wonderful people, although they make
some bad choices along the way.  "Cider" will open your mind to letting
individuals into your life, even if they have done a bad thing or two, as the
film shows that good people do mess up, but if given a chance, they can shine
just as much as anyone else in the world could.  Rarely does a film pack so
much into it that it comes off as an awesomely overwhelming experience.  "The
Cider House Rules" blends comedy, drama, and romance into a rather short
running time for its kind, becoming one of the most admirable, memorable films
of 1999.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line: Corny I know, but this "Cider" really does, "rule."</P>
