FROG AND WOMBAT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     1998 is shaping up to be the year when girls and young women hit
the big time as the heroines of kids' movies.  Young females have played
strong leading parts in movies as diverse as MADELINE, EVER AFTER,
MULAN, PAULIE and, my personal favorite, THE PARENT TRAP.  To this list
can now be added FROG AND WOMBAT, a delightful picture about some sixth
grade girls hot on the trail of a "mystery."</P>
<P>     Produced and filmed nearby in Santa Cruz, California, the film is
in limited distribution around the country now.  Written and directed by
Laurie Agard, the film stays firmly in the realm of the delightfully
silly kids' movie until the end, which would probably earn it a PG or
PG-13 rating for mild violence.  (The film isn't rated.)  Although it is
a good picture without the ending twist, it is stronger for it.</P>
<P>     It all starts when the new junior high school principal, Larry
Struble, played by veteran actor Ronny Cox, moves into town.  Allison
Parker and Jane Walker, played by new film actresses Katie Stuart and
Emily Lipoma, are best buddies who keep a close eye on the goings on in
their neighborhood, always on the lookout for anything suspicious.
Allison, who talks constantly from her bedroom to Jane in hers on their
walkie-talkies, insists that they use code names, lest someone discover
their true identities.  Allison wants to be referred to only as Frog and
demands that Jane be known as Wombat.</P>
<P>     Frog likes to wear army combat fatigues to increase her stealth
factor.  In contrast, Wombat's preferred outfit is a pink gown and
slippers with huge dog faces on the toes.</P>
<P>     After the bachelor principal introduces the girls to his niece,
Nancy (Jessica Cushman), she "mysteriously" disappears.  Wombat
pooh-poohs Frog's whole propensity toward assuming the worst.  The
principal tells them that Nancy just went back home to New York, and
Wombat is happy to accept that explanation as being the simple truth.</P>
<P>     Soon Frog is assembling a host of "facts" to prove their
principal's criminal behavior.  His refrigerator is missing so he must
have hidden Nancy's dead body in it.  When he claims the refrigerator
broke, Frog figures that his call to the Salvation Army to donate it was
only because he realized that they were on to him.  Other clues include
finding pictures of an unknown woman in his briefcase and a wedding ring
near the missing refrigerator.  For these and other clues, Frog has to
break into the principal's house and his office.</P>
<P>     The two lead actresses, while still getting their acting legs, give
sweet performances.  One is as tough as the other is reluctant.  The
script is funny with the best jokes, about menstruation, being ones that
girls of that age will certainly enjoy and identify with.</P>
<P>     That Frog's single mother, Sydney, played by another veteran,
Lindsay Wagner, expresses some interest in the principal only serves to
redouble Frog's resolve to prove he's a murderer.  Along the way, the
two leads, aided by the new girl at school, Francesca (Briana Michaud),
get into many adventures.  The script surprisingly allows them to do
some of the gross stuff usually reserved for the boys.  The best of
these female gross-out scenes has Frog and Francesca enjoying peanut
butter from a large jar by dipping their big toes into the jar and then
eating the peanut butter right off of their toes.</P>
<P>     Indie films for kids are almost impossible to find.  This rare one
deserves seeking out.  Perhaps we will be lucky, and it will inspire
more such worthwhile and enjoyable productions.</P>
<P>     FROG AND WOMBAT runs 1:30.  It is not rated but would be PG or
PG-13 for a scene of mild violence.  The picture would be fine for kids
around 7 and up.</P>
<P>     My son Jeffrey, age 9, thought the movie was great and gave it ***
1/2.  His favorite part was the way the girls communicated with
walkie-talkies.  He thought Frog was terrific.</P>
