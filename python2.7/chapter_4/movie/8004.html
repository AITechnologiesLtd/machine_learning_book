<PRE>                               PRIVATE PARTS
                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4 = OK)
1997, R, 109 minutes [1 hour, 49 minutes]
[comedy]
starring: Howard Stern (Himself), Mary McCormack (Alison Stern), Robin
Quivers (Herself), Paul Giamatti (Kenny - "Pig Vomit"), written by Len Blum,
Michael Kalesniko, produced by Ivan Reitman, directed by Betty Thomas, based
on the novel by Howard Stern.</P>
<P>Howard Stern has declared himself the "King of All Media" because he knows
how to get our attention - by making us wonder what he'll do next. He
constantly says he is misunderstood and "Private Parts" is an attempt to show
us the man behind the sunglasses.</P>
<P>The film works in three ways: as a satirical biography; as an extremely
lighthearted drama of free speech and romance; and as a wild, sexual comedy
farce. The only problem is trying to force these elements to work with each
other when they really do not. </P>
<P>The first act plays like a lowbrow "Forrest Gump," but it becomes a bit more
serious through Howard's college years. Stern (played by himself) is a geeky
nerd with few friends, but has a quiet passion for radio. He meets his future
wife, Alison (McCormack), and the two connect instantly. Then we get the
standard opposites-attract romantic comedy gags, such as when Stern plays
Frisbee with the his wife's group of mentally challenged adults (this joke
sets up itself). There are a few sight gags like these throughout the film,
but this is not a film about stupidity (a la "Dumb And Dumber") and thus they
seem out of place.</P>
<P>They don't call Howard Stern a shock jock for nothing. Sex sells and he
knows this, but because of the medium of radio he must be careful with what
he says and does on the air. Stern often talks about his own sexual conquests
with his wife, which she doesn't mind at first, but when he jokes about her
miscarriage the semi-serious breakup/makeup routine comes into play. I know
this is based on a true story and this probably did happen, but it doesn't
seem to keep with the rest of the film.</P>
<P>The storytelling throughout the second and third acts is quite choppy: one
minute the movie is a wild comedy with Stern's shocking sexual antics (some
that are nearly pornographic); the next minute he is looking for loopholes in
his battle for free speech; and the next minute he is either arguing or being
romantic Alison. </P>
<P>The second half of the film essentially becomes a filmed version of "The
Best of the Howard Stern Show." And it's not that Stern is an idiot, just the
opposite in fact. Unlike Beavis and Butt-Head, he seems too smart to be
making such lowbrow humor. When the story eventually returns to its
supposedly lighthearted romantic comedy roots, I had almost forgotten about
the Alison character because she disappears for almost 30 minutes.</P>
<P>Although there are some flaws, "Private Parts" is not a bad movie at all. It
simply tries too hard to be too many things. Stern's claims of being a
regular guy are vindicated, but through a somewhat mediocre manner.  </P>
