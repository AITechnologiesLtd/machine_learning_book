<PRE>The Nightmare Before Christmas
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Just in time for Halloween and Christmas, the reissue of The Nightmare
Before Christmas couldn't be more appropriate.  With all of the
attention thrown to "family films" in recent years, namely those
starring pocket monsters and Nickelodeon characters, it's high time we
raised the intellectual level of children's fare as well as the
animation achievements of the movie studios.  With that in mind, it was
refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still
retains the originality and freshness it had seven years ago.</P>
<P>Nightmare is the story of one man's quest to discover his true purpose
in life -- to look beyond the accolades of his peers, the achievements
of his years, and the praise of his ego.  Jack Skellington, the pumpkin
king of Halloweentown, is the main dude behind the Halloween holiday for
kids everywhere.  But during his reign as pumpkin king, Jack has somehow
lost his understanding of his place in the world and the magic he
creates with his Halloween holiday.  After the completion of one
particular Halloween season, Jack walks with a heavy heart and ends up
discovering in the woods outside Halloweentown a grove of trees with
doors to all of the other holidays in the world.  Imagine his surprise
to discover Christmastown, a far more impressive and uplifting holiday
than Halloween, surrounded by happy elves making toys, and with good
cheer all around.</P>
<P>Upon his return to Halloweentown, Jack decides to combine Halloween and
Christmas together by kidnapping "Sandy Claws," employing all the
residents of Halloweentown to build toys for children.  He then aims to
take over the role as primary joy-provider and gift-bearer to the
children of the world, in the hopes of rediscovering the zest for life
he once had.  Alas, the co-mingling of Halloween and Christmas creates
disastrous results involving shrunken heads, psychotic wooden ducks, a
sleigh pulled by a phantom dog with a lighted nose, and a large,
sinister, singing bag named Oogie Boogie</P>
<P>Tim Burton -- the man behind such great films as Ed Wood, Beetlejuice,
Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, and Edward Scissorhands -- is the creative
force behind Nightmare.  Originally, Burton authored a poem that became
the basis of the storyline, and he was jointly involved in the
production design of the film (though many mistakenly assume he directed
the picture).  The stamp of Burton is clearly everywhere in the film --
with bold colors, imaginative character design, and it's simple yet
compelling story.  The direction of Harry Selick, who also directed
James and the Giant Peach, is strong, offering intimate views of the
strange collection of characters.  Also memorable are the songs in the
film, written by former Oingo Boingo lead singer Danny Elfman, the next
John Williams of film composing.</P>
<P>The Nightmare Before Christmas is intended for both the kid and adult in
everyone.  It's not just child's play for the holidays; it's a movie
about how to be truly happy in a tough world, saying that all you need
to do is just be exactly who you are, without compromise.  What better
message is there for Christmas?</P>
