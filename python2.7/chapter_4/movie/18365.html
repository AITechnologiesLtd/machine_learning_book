<PRE>Reds (1981)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 57</PRE>
<P>Warren Beatty co-produced, directed, co-wrote and
starred in "Reds", an ambitious 200-minute biography
of American communist John Reed.  The film was
nominated for an incredible twelve Academy Awards,
but the critical praise does not seem justified.
It features a romance based mostly upon petty
quarrels, a revolution consisting mostly of
speechmaking, and political intrigue filled mostly
with more petty bickering.</P>
<P>Adventurer/journalist Reed (Warren Beatty) meets
attractive artist/activist Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton)
just prior to the advent of World War I.  Soon, she
leaves her conservative husband for Reed.  She also
takes up with bitter playwright Eugene O'Neill (Jack
Nicholson).  Disillusioned with Wilson's declaration
of war against the Germans, the already radical Reed
becomes a communist.</P>
<P>Reed travels to Russia, where he chronicles the
revolution in his famous work, "Ten Days that Shook
the World".  After the war, he returns to America,
becomes a labor agitator and forms a communist
party.  Then, it's back to Russia, which is now
involved in a civil war against West-supported
'white' armies.  Reed suffers from hardships such as
imprisonment and declining health, and joins a committee
led by fiery Grigory Zinoviev (author Jerzy Kosinski).
Bryant makes an unlikely, selfless journey to Russia
to join Reed.  Maureen Stapleton plays Emma Goldman,
another noted American communist.  Gene Hackman
also shows up in a small role.</P>
<P>Beatty deserves respect for making such a finacially
risky and densely political epic.  By no means are
the Russian communists glorified.  Lenin is depicted
as a cold-blooded intellectual, while Stapleton's
character is used to demonstrate disillusionment
with the Bolsheviks' repressive dictatorship.  While
the politics are on target, the story focuses too
much on Keaton, whose character dominates the film's
first half.  Perhaps this was a marketing necessity
to bring women to the theatres, but any romantic
chemistry between Keaton and Beatty is quickly
trashed by their incessant arguments.</P>
<P>"Reds" won three Oscars, for Best Director, Best
Cinematography (Vittorio Storaro), and Best Supporting
Actress (Stapleton).  The film was nominated in all the
major categories, including Best Actor (Beatty), Best
Actress (Keaton), Best Supporting Actor (Nicholson),
Best Picture, and Best Original Screenplay (Beatty with
Trevor Griffiths).</P>
