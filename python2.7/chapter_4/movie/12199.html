<P>The tagline for Spike Lee's latest drama is "The Father, the Son and the 
Holy Game." The lead character's name is Jesus and they don't use the 
Spanish pronunciation. Although the story is set largely in impoverished 
areas, the Coney Island backdrops, packed with colorful storefronts, 
amusement park rides and acres of neon, give the film a romantic look of 
seedy grandeur. Aaron Copland's rich, melodramatic orchestral score is 
reminiscent of the music from films like "Rebel Without A Cause." Even 
the pop songs, by the reunited Public Enemy, are unusually somber and 
understated. It's clear that Lee intends this film to be far more than 
just another movie about sports and father/son conflicts. His goal is to 
make "He Got Game" a classic. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, while Lee has crafted a film that looks and sounds 
terrific, he fails to make the central storyline as compelling. A week 
after seeing "He Got Game," the sounds and images still resonate in my 
memory, but the people don't. Populated with too many characters who are 
sketchy or unsympathetic, and burdened with a flat performance from first-
time actor Ray Allen, "He Got Game" narrowly misses making the all-
important human connection. The result is still a good film, but not the 
great one it could have been.</P>
<P>The story is straightforward enough. Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel 
Washington,) serving a lengthy prison sentence for killing his wife, 
receives a offer from the warden. Jake's son Jesus (Allen) is the top 
high school basketball player in America and everyone wants a piece of 
what could be the next Michael Jordan. Resisting the lure of joining the 
NBA and gaining immediate wealth, the young athlete is determined to 
attend college, and has only a few days to choose from the hundreds of 
scholarships being offered him. The governor wants Jesus to attend his 
alma mater, Big State, and relays his proposition through the warden. 
Jake will be temporarily paroled, under the scrutiny of two officers. If 
he can convince his son to sign a letter of intent for Big State, Jake's 
sentence will be commuted. If not, it's back to the slammer for Dad. Of 
course, Jesus loathes Jake, so the task won't be an easy one.</P>
<P>"He Got Game" has two dominant themes; the exploitation of student 
athletes, and the estranged relationship between father and son. Both 
have been dealt with many times before, but if handled correctly, even 
the most well-worn themes can seem fresh. Of the two, Lee does better 
with the former than the latter. Jesus is virtually smothered by people 
who want to feed off his talent and suffers great stress from the 
pressure. While everyone from his uncle to his girlfriend angle for their 
piece of the pie, the media has already made the kid a star. Lee is a 
major basketball fan, and his commercials for sports shoes have made him 
richer than his movies, so he knows this world well. His portrait of 
sports stars as false gods is painted in broad strokes, but it works, 
thanks to Lee's great style. Highlights include a hilarious cameo from 
John Turturro as a college coach trying to woo the young man with an over-
the-top multimedia pitch, and a gaudy ESPN documentary called "Jesus of 
Coney Island." Subtle? No. Effective? Yes. To add authenticity, Lee 
peppers the film liberally with cameos from everybody from Reggie Miller 
to Michael Jordan.</P>
<P>The film's many basketball scenes are quite believable, because Lee hired 
the real deal to do the job. Jesus' high school teammates are played by 
Travis Best of the Pacers, John Wallace of the Raptors, Walter McCarty of 
the Celtics and Rick Fox of the Lakers. Unfortunately, Lee also cast a 
real basketball player in the lead role. Ray Allen of the Milwaukee Bucks 
plays Jesus and as an actor, well, Allen is a great ballplayer. </P>
<P>Denzel Washington, who generally has trouble playing anyone other than a 
boy scout, is very effective as Jesus' father, a frustrated ballplayer 
who drove his son mercilessly, severely damaging the relationship with 
his boy long before the fateful incident with his wife. Washington gives 
a credible, layered performance that triumphs over the script's rough 
spots, even a superfluous subplot involving a battered hooker ("The Fifth 
Element's" Milla Jovovich,) but there's only so much he can do while 
working with an amateur. Allen's monotone performance lessens the impact 
of even the most dramatic scenes between father and son. </P>
<P>The lack of well-rounded or sympathetic supporting players doesn't help 
the film, and casting Allen was a critical mistake, but not a fatal one. 
Despite its problems, "He Got Game" has tremendous style and a fair 
amount of substance. Not enough to make the film a classic, but more than 
enough to warrant a viewing. </P>
