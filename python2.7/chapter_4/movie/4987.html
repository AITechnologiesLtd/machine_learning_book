<PRE>                             DENISE CALLS UP
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     This is an original way of telling the story of how many
relationships are started and conducted today.  We are talking about
the computer age, BBSing, e-mail, and the telephone.  We talk to each
other, we get to know each other real well, all because of the
anonymity the computer communication allows.  Because of that daily
contact and "conversation" there is little we eventually do not know
about the other party/parties, nor they about us except what they look
like.</P>
<P>     Denise (Alanna Ubach) is on the phone constantly, frequently
interrupted by Call Waiting.  So are Frank (Tim Daly), Barbara
(Caroleen Feeney), Martin (Dan Gunther), Gale (Dana Wheeler Nicholson),
Jerry (Liev Schreiber) and Linda (Aida Turturro).  The whole film is
about talking, gossiping, rumors, constant interruptions with Call
Waiting, more ringing.</P>
<P>     The conversations lead to intimate relationships, never
consummated; they don't even meet but can they ever talk.  And what
they talk about is usually utter trivia until we learn that one of the
women has become pregnant via a sperm donor.</P>
<P>     The film opens the morning after a party, tables laden with food
because no one showed up last night. . . but they all have great
excuses.  The fact is everyone is afraid to meet in person; keeping it
a phone thing is more relaxing and make believe than the real tbing may
turn out to be.  Every time something is arranged, such as a lunch, no
one shows up.</P>
<P>     Having experienced on my computer much of what goes on in the film
(even if it is exaggerated with dramatic license), I can vouch for its
authenticity.  I mean it COULD happen and among the millions who are on
BBSes and Internet's e-mail, it surely happens many, many times a
day.  It would have been perfect if the film left out the telephone
and somehow utilized the computer for the whole film but that may have
been too tricky to accomplish as a movie.  Nevertheless, especially to
those of us who love our computer communicating, this is a film not to
be missed.  It's billed as a "cyber-comedy."</P>
