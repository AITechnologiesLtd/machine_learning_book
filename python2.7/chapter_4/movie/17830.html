<PRE>Black Pirate, The (1926)
A film review by Steve Lipson</PRE>
<P> When many people think of silent movies today, they think of archaic films
whose narrative and stylistic techniques would be completely foreign to
modern audiences. But this opinion reflects ignorance far more than
reality. As early as 1915 with the release of D.W. Griffith's "The Birth of
a Nation," the vocabulary of the modern feature film had become
well-established. The ensuing decade saw still more refinements of
cinematic technique; by the end of the silent era, one would be
hard-pressed to point out any major story-telling conventions that had not
yet been discovered. What distinguishes most silent films is not their
strangeness but the remarkable closeness with which they match today's
expectations; truly, the only foreign aspect of a silent film is the
"silence" itself. Even the typical action movie of the silent era--like the
Douglas Fairbanks vehicle "The Black Pirate" (1926)--reflects this
unmistakable modernity.</P>
<P>I was very impressed with the technical accomplishments of the Albert
Parker-directed film "The Black Pirate"; they clearly show how far the
cinema has advanced in only a couple decades. Almost immediately, one can
notice--at a basic level--cinematic devices that we would consider modern.
"Black Pirate," for example, begins with an extensive list of opening
credits, unlike most of the short films that only provided a title card
without identifying the talent involved in their making. Also, the film
frequently uses intertitles; after the first 15 minutes, the vast majority
of these titles give us dialogue as opposed to exposition of the plot. This
again distinguishes this movie from films made a couple decades earlier,
and in so doing allows us to identify more with the characters. On a
similar note, the camera has noticeably moved closer to the actors; using
3/4 and medium shots most of the time, the audience can recognize the
characters and understand their emotions. Again, this is a big distinction
with the proscenium arch shots of earlier movies, in which the actors'
faces are barely visible. I should stress that "The Black Pirate" obviously
did not innovate any of these techniques; however, they
  stood out to me as reflecting how quickly cinema had advanced out of its
early and transitional periods (1895-1915).</P>
<P>  But what may be the most surprising "modern" feature of this movie to
recent audiences is the fact that it is filmed in color. "Black Pirate",
according to a review I read, is in fact one of the few surviving movies
from the silent era that was shot in Technicolor. The two-color Technicolor
process involved was very primitive, so that the color will probably look
disappointing to modern audiences. Also, the process involved was quite
elaborate and expensive, so that "Black Pirate" took a lot longer to film
than comparable B&W movies. The Technicolor process (according to the
"Making of" Documentary at the end of the laser disk) required a very large
amount of light, and in other ways impeded with the
  art direction and cinematography. Thus, many of the criticisms I am about
to give can
  perhaps be forgiven because of the extreme difficulties involved with
filming in color in
  1926. </P>
<P>  Though many of the editing traits and acting styles of the movie would
appear to us as
  modern, there are some problems that may be leftovers from a previous
era, or
  innovations that are not followed through. For example, one of the first
dialogue intertitles
  shows a pirate speaking in dialect, with a kind of accent. This seemed to
me as if it would
  be a worthwhile attempt to add additional personality to the characters,
but these dialogue
  intertitles with non-standard English were almost entirely abandoned
after the first one.
  Also, slight problems still remain with narrative continuity. The
director and editor
  understand how to use implicit editing and time compression; we cut from
Fairbanks on
  the island offering to capture a ship single-handedly to his beginning
efforts of doing so
  without having to show him sailing away from the island and spending time
on the pirate
  ship first. Nevertheless, I can think of one incident at least where the
time and especially the spatial
  compression goes too far and is confusing. The last we see of Fairbanks
after he has
  walked the plank, he is hanging out in the ocean at the side of the boat.
My assumption
  was that he would try to surreptitiously get back on. In our next shot of
him, we see him
  climbing up onto dry land and meeting some horses. How long it took him
to get there and
  where he was confused me at first. The movie could have perhaps been made
clearer by
  inserting an intertitle where he explains his plans, or at least
introducing a shot that shows
  him swimming away from the boat, in the open sea or in the direction of
land. </P>
<P>  Also, the movie often has a too stagey feel. Again, the shooting of it in
color may have
  made this inevitable. But the island is clearly a set, with fake (perhaps
painted) backdrops
  and most of the action taking place at the front of the frame. Perhaps
one cannot blame the
  director for this, for--just as there are scenes that seem too
stagey--there are some scenes
  that take full advantage of the space in the frame, for example the shots
of the soldiers
  leaping from behind and above the camera into the frame as they attack
the pirates. (This
  is a point made in the "Making of" documentary.) Also, the action set
pieces, while
  spectacular, often can be confusing because they're usually filmed too
close-up for the
  audience to follow clearly what's happening. Somewhat ironically, given
my comments earlier in this review, occasional long shots may have been
nice so as to more easily see the perspective in which the action is taking
place. But again, the necessary use of sets (and the limitations in special
effects) may have made my wish unrealistic. Perhaps the film-makers did as
good as they could in 1926. </P>
<P>  So far, I have pointed out the non-modern problems still evident in the
movie. But to some
  extent, any confusion these may have generated is reduced via the modern
cinematic
  conventions that the movie does very well, for example in parallel
editing, analytical
  editing, point-of-view editing, and audience identification with the
characters. The parallel
  editing to create suspense (in which the movie cuts between rescuer,
tormenter, and
  person in need of rescued) is probably the most obvious and, since it had
already been
  close to perfected by D.W. Griffith as early as 1912, I will not comment
further on it here. </P>
<P>  More noteworthy is the frequent employment of analytical editing, in
which the film cuts
  from a scene to a close-up of a specific detail of that scene to show to
the audience the
  importance of the item in the close-up to the plot. Examples include the
close-up shots to
  understand how Fairbanks escapes from his ropes before he walks the
plank, and
  especially the frequent close-ups of the ring he is wearing. At first,
the audience may be
  unsure as to its meaning. But the importance of the ring soon becomes
clear, and the
  director repeatedly afterwards focuses on it perhaps to foreshadow how
the identity of
  Fairbanks which it implies will help him in his final victory. </P>
<P>  Also, the movie knows how to develop its characters so as to give them a
personality and
  elicit audience sympathy or disgust. Character differentiation has
obviously had a long history in the cinema by this point, but here clearly
the process is used to further the plot and
  audience identification with the characters. It is important to early on
identify the pirate
  leader as evil and Fairbanks as the definite hero. Audience dislike of
the pirate leader is
  quickly accomplished by his revealing of his desire to kill his men to
receive more of the
  money. Thus, the audience can definitely root for Fairbanks, whose
essential nobility is
  also revealed early on by his permitting the pirate leader to get a new
sword after he
  dropped his during the fight. The rest of the movie provides further
examples of
  Fairbanks's inherent goodness, as well as character traits which allow
the audience fairly
  quickly to decide which pirates to root for or against. </P>
<P>  What impressed me most about "The Black Pirate," though, was its
point-of-view editing.
  This could be the subject of a whole other review, especially those shots
when we see
  from the perspective of one character looking down on another, or vice
versa. (The scene
  is shot from a high angle representing the viewpoint of one of the
characters.) In all these
  instances, the character looking down is located in a superior position
to those in his view,
  and we can easily see the vulnerability of those other people. Depending
on the
  situation, these point-of-view shots either fill us with a sense of
menace and fear for the
  safety of the people in sight or provide us hope that a bad situation can
be fixed. In one
  key situation, a point-of-view shot of this type even resolves some
confusion created by
  the excessive close-ups in action scenes. As Fairbanks tries to capture
the Merchantman,
  the audience is unsure where Fairbanks is in relation to the people he is
trying to capture.
  But all uncertainty is resolved by the shot where we see (from a low
angle) the sailors of
  that ship look up and see Fairbanks's smiling face as he stands high
above them pointing
  two guns straight at them. Fairbanks's superior position (and their
vulnerability) is clearly
  established, and this point-of-view shot enables the audience to readily
understand what
  has happened in a key action scene. I remember seeing at least four
angled point-of-view
  shots in the movie, and all of them are very effective in provoking
audience reaction and
  getting them involved with the plight of the characters in the story. By
1926, the cinematic
  conventions designed to make movies a "cinema of narrative integration"
have been
  firmly established.</P>
