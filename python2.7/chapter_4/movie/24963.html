<P>Years from now, when the 1980's are reduced to a few meager paragraphs in
textbooks, only a few names will make the cut. Ronald Reagan and Oliver
North will probably be two of them for the infamous Iran-Contra scandal.
Ditto Mike Milken and Ivan Boesky for their notorious Wall Street
activities. And surely Jim Bakker will also find his way into the history
books as a founder of televangelism and a man who fell fast and hard. But
where is his partner? The other giants, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and Pat
Boone are all still standing - Bakker alone when to jail. Of course, there
was his loyal wife who seemed to vanish at the end of the turbulent decade
and never resurfaced. `The Eyes of Tammy Faye' asks the question: `Whatever
happened to Tammy Faye?'</P>
<P>Tammy Faye grew up in Small Town, USA as a Christian girl with such strong
faith that she claims a finger wart of hers was cured during communion one
Sunday. When in college, she met her religious equal and married him within
a year. Jim and Tammy Faye Baker would go on to make Pat Robertson who he
is, build three Christian television networks and practically create the
electronic pulpit.</P>
<P>The couple, who became the most popular Christian force in America,
redefined how it all worked. Tammy welcomed a homosexual suffering from AIDS
on air – something that had previously been taboo in the faith. Together,
they gave religious television a new look: no longer would it be super
serious and oftentimes boring, rather it would have a carnival like
atmosphere. Tammy insists `we believed Christianity should be fun' as she
recollects how she sung and used puppets, Jim introduced magicians and
clowns, and together they spread their religion over the Praise The Lord
Network (a. k. a. `PTL').</P>
<P>Of course, such an operation wasn't cheap. They were constantly asking for
donations and raising money. The bigger they got, the more expensive their
network became. When Jim decided to build a theme park – one that would be
the third largest in the world – the cost of operation per every two days
was $1 million. That's equivalent to 50,000 $10 pledges a day.</P>
<P>Then, in the 1980's, it all came crashing down. `The Eyes of Tammy Faye,'
with a clear pro-Tammy bias, pins most of the couple's problems on Jerry
Falwell. Rather than Jim Bakker being at fault for his infamous rendezvous
with Jessica Hahn, Jerry Falwell is the troublemaker. It is strongly implied
that Falwell leaked word of the affair to the news media and it is stated,
by many people, in very clear language, that Falwell maliciously conned the
couple out of PTL and then intentionally bankrupt the empire. It is even
alleged that he went a step further and insured that Jim and Tammy Faye
suffer public humiliation – possibly even framing Jim for the financial
irregularities that ultimately led to his being sentenced to 45 years in
prison. At one point, the film goes so far as to indirectly refer to Falwell
as `The Dragon.'</P>
<P>Of course, Jerry Falwell allegedly wasn't alone in sabotaging the couple.
The documentary assures us that the trial was biased from the beginning, the
press just as slanted and the American people all-too unforgiving.</P>
<P>Could it be? Is it just possible that America's largest religious scandal in
memory was actually a sham? Tammy Faye, between many tears and sobbing,
denies that either she or Jim ever misplaced a penny. Rather, it is
conveyed, that she merely suffers from bad luck and is continuously forced
to survive what no person should have to endure. As soon as we learn of her
phobia of flying, we see her in a plane that is grounded mid-route because
of weather problems. It all strikes a note that belongs in an Alanis
Morissette song. Yet, as frustrating as Morissette's `Ironic' may have been,
it was still a very entertaining piece. `The Eyes of Tammy Faye' is no
different.</P>
