<PRE>Mighty Joe Young</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Charlize Theron and Bill Paxton
Directed By Ron Underwood
Running Time: 1 hour 54 minutes</PRE>
<PRE>(Walt Disney Pictures)</PRE>
<P>Apart from the cute RKO symbol at the start of the film, there's no
surprises in this new Disney film. 'Mighty Joe' happens to be a giant ape,
who befriends Jill (Theron) who's mother was killed by poachers. Jill meets
Gregg (Paxton) who wants to move Joe out of his natural habitat and into a
wildlife preserve, where he feels Joe would be safer. Although reluctant,
Jill agrees. However, Joe soon attracts interest from a poacher (Rade
Serbedzjia) the very same poacher who killed Jill's mother. Will Joe escape
their clutches? Will Jill and Gregg fall in love. Well, would we expect
anything else from the mouse?</P>
<P>>From the outset, it's obvious that Mighty Joe Young is going to be nothing
but an enjoyable kids movie. Although it's incredibly predictable, it's made
well enough and is passable entertainment. Although Ron Underwood tries
nothing new when directing, the cast and the special effects are nifty
enough to make this good. The under-rated Theron, after a good performance
in The Devils Advocate (1997) delivers another good acting turn here, making
an under developed role into something quite likeable and appealing to kids.
Although she tries to be to child like during some parts of the film, her
performance certainly isn't a failure. Bill Paxton, or 'Mr. Bland' is as
bland as ever, and cursed with the worst hair seen in Hollywood for a very
long time. His performance is alright, and he's starry eyed enough to carry
the role, but someone a little more exciting would have done. Serbedzjia is
the typical Disney bad guy, yet he doesn't overplay the role, which is a
shame really, because this movie really needs an outlandish character.</P>
<P>Joe himself is a wonderful piece of technology from Rick Baker. Although the
CGI looks a little fake, the model is excellent and features a nice range of
actions. It's also a believable model, something missing from movies
recently. Although he's a very 2D character, he's a good enough plot device.
However, he is loveable enough for the young ones, and he's easy to root
for.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the story telling suffers from Disney's obsession at bland,
straight forward scripting. The script, by Ruth Rose, is full of morals, yet
isn't quite so patronising as some of Disney's worst efforts. The family
theme is played strongly, as there's no doubt that children will learn about
friendship and family from this movie. Unfortunately, however, the pacing is
all wrong. While the scenes in the jungle are nice, in this Godzilla world
the children will be looking for something for a bit more action. Indeed,
Disney were going to make this an Godzilla competitor until pulling back the
release date. Therefore, we get 1 hour 30 minutes of sloppy morals and only
20 minutes of Joe running amok, which is a bit of a let down. It's a shame,
because the action scenes are well done, and the last 20 minutes give the
film a buzz lacking from the material beforehand. Although the action kicks
in before boredom will take over, it's still too little too late.</P>
<P>As a family movie, Mighty Joe Young will not hit all the targets. Although
children under eight will no doubt love the simple to understand story, the
parents in tow may get bored with the obviousness of it all, a common
problem with Disney movies. Although featuring pretty scenery, a nice
soundtrack and excellent effects, the film is lacking that spark that family
films like A Bugs Life have. Far from mighty, therefore, but still not a
complete disappointment.</P>
