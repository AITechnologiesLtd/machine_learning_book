<PRE>                           PRIDE AND PREJUDICE
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>        Jane Austen's self-possessing sense of humor is finally getting
the much wider audience it has long deserved, thanks to the 1995 British
miniseries PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and the Emma Thompson SENSE AND
SENSIBILITY. Austen, who died in 1817 at 42 after a long illness and who
was never "popular" as a novelist while alive, probably had to suffer the
misfortune of waiting until the 20th Century to get full recognition
because, in her most well known works, P & P being the most famous, she
was trenchant observer of behavior. In spite of and probably impelled by a
lifetime limited to living with her family, which included seven brothers
and sisters, and being educated at home and travelling little, Austen
offered her maiden energy to unnerving, unaccustomed distaff insights
which had to sting the real people on whom her characters were based. One
can only imagine, for example, the horror the actual personage(s) that
Lady Catherine de Berg represents must have endured over Austen's
devastating profile. And no less than Austen's own mother might have
become "vexed" by the portrait of the exasperating Mrs. Bennet. Through
her characters, Austen rarely hesitated to cast initial judgment on others
-- hence the original title of P & P: the ironic "First Impressions."
Understanding the human inclination to do so, perceiving faults and
weaknesses, she conjured embarrassing social ordeal as means to rectify
them. She did in the early 1800s what Dickens would later do, but she did
it without any exhibitions of violence, menace, corruption. Moralist she
was, thanks in large part to her father being a rector (and her mother was
a daughter of one), but unlike Dickens, no heavy social critic: her
stories don't indict society, only the scoundrels in it. Austen's a comic
disciplinarian of manner, custom, propriety. Directed by Simon Langton,
and adapted by Andrew Davies, this latest PRIDE AND PREJUDICE most likely
sparks so responsive a cord in the audience -- in England, 40% of all
televisions were tuned in to the final chapter; and A & E's airing of the
series garnered the network its highest ratings -- because there's a
strong longing for civility and beauty of language. As we feel our own
society dive into hatred, watch as our culture sinks into an "it sucks"
cesspool, viewing the cultivated banter between Colin Firth's Darcy and
Jennifer Ehle's Lizzie Bennet is like an oasis of rejuvenation. It isn't
that we accept the virginal nonsense of love even before a kiss, it's the
restoration of politeness: Darcy and Lizzie raging at each other is the
art of temperance. It's in the richness of the way words have been
designed to inflict wounds and self-righteous opinion, impart wisdom, to
reverberate with humor, compassion and passion itself. </P>
<P>        After his simpy Vicomte in Milos Forman's VALMONT, after his
repressed, prissy invert-turned-fascist in the sickie APARTMENT ZERO, who
could have guessed Firth an appropriate Darcy? Looking taller than usual,
employing an aristocratic butch gait (the Napoleonic coats and top hats
help), having gained some fleshiness in the face, which is covered with
soft, short nongreasy curls, he brings a bit of Laurence Olivier's Darcy
to the brooding, snob-loner -- perhaps as tribute -- but he's no clone:
this is Firth's first real masculine romantic, and not too far removed
from the monde of Beau Brummell. Photographed to take advantage of the
seemingly endless silence he and Lizzie indulge in, Firth's also very
fortunate that he isn't agonizing over Greer Garson, as Olivier did.
(Pauline Kael on Garson: "A viewer can get weary watching that eyebrow
that goes up and down like the gold curtain at the old Met.") A puffy
Barbara Parkins crossed with Mary McDonnell, Jennifer Ehle's Lizzie, the
second oldest of five Bennet daughters, has a curiously courteous
objurgation that both attracts and repels: the attention she gets for her
various sentiments, notions and social position (which is always in danger
of ebbing) are also the sins used against her by the upper class bitches
-- Lady de Berg, Bingley's sister (in hilarious get ups). Excepting EMMA
and MANSFIELD PARK Austen supposedly never wrote characters of deep
intellectual persuasion, yet Ehle gives Lizzie the kind of searing smarts
that keeps enemies at bay. Ehle has wonderful moments of self-recognition
about her early, faulty views, and only the audience shares in the most
revealing: when she takes in Darcy's mansion. You can "see" her
envisioning herself as the Mistress of Pemberly. The patriarch of the
Bennets is warmly played by Benjamin Whitrow, who's never above calling
three of his five "the silliest of girls"; the youngest silly Lydia, who
almost causes a fatal social calamity, gets the Tracey Ullman treatment by
Julia Sawalha; and Barbara Leigh-Hunt's Lady Catherine is another hybrid:
Margaret Hamilton as Pamela Brown. </P>
<P>        The first two hours of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE are just about the
funniest pre-Victorian sitcom I've ever seen. That's compliment, not
put-down: director Langton faithfully brings all of Austen's liveliness to
what is a very restricted situation: five brides in search of five moneyed
dandies. The next two hours remain frothy as they get into the requisite
"deepening" of character motivations. (And into Lizzie's realization of
what it would mean materially not to be Darcy's wife.) The final two wrap
it up with more satisfaction than we might have thought possible, since we
know from the beginning that opposites attract and swooning romanticism
will triumph. Yes, indeed, it's all rather like the Bard's MUCH ADO ABOUT
NOTHING, only here readers and viewers get the good dose of Anglo-Saxon
uprightness as bonus. Austen's lack of success as a novelist during her
living years doesn't mean she wasn't appreciated: Sir Walter Scott was a
great champion who admitted that he didn't have the ability to create
Austen's perfectly drawn characterizations. But she had detractors, the
most famous being Mark Twain, who could not abide her love, if not
establishment, of debutante romanticism. Sadly, Austen was never to know
how she would so vex the frauds. Maybe that's the key to her popularity
today: she's the undisputed queen of genteel vexers. She could be to the
besieged Princess Di a mentor in waiting.</P>
