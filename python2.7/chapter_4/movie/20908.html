<PRE>If you like sugar & cream with your coffee...
Mumford</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>On a sunny, green-grassy day in small town Mumford, a 1940's milk truck
pulls up just as Dr. Mumford steps off with a patient for a little walk-talk
therapy: textbook "trite." And it's just the first layer of the cake. Still,
"Mumford" has plenty of good movie baked right in -- all that creamy white
schmaltz just can't bog it down. In fact, the fluff kind of rises to the
surface after the fact. Kind of like pleasuring yourself with the way
birthday cake tastes divine while you're eating it; but then on the ride
home from the party, your stomach may have a few points of its own to make.</P>
<P>The ads reveal a secret that ought to be held for the halfway point of the
film (skip this paragraph if you don't want to know). Though he's having
overwhelming success with the Mumfordonians; Dr. Mumford isn't a real
psychologist. And of course, there's a love story (or two or three) thrown
in for good measure.</P>
<P>It's a cozy film with fun characters, fine dialogue and an inspiringly warm
and fuzzy theme. You won't have a bad time, though you'll want for your next
flick to be one completely lacking sugar. I liked it!</P>
