<P>The Coen brothers have been known to do many different types of movies.
BLOOD SIMPLE was their ode to the noir murder mysteries. MILLER'S CROSSING
tipped a cap at the stylized gangster flicks. BARTON FINK left much to
interpretation and played on the old Hollywood system. THE HUDSUCKER PROXY
was their take on the 1950s screwball comedy and FARGO was praised by
everyone in the world as the perfect small-town murder fable. Add THE BIG
LEBOWSKI to the list, with a combination of all the elements from above, and
you've got an awesome career for two extremely private filmmakers. And oh
yeah, then there's this movie...</P>
<P>PLOT:
A simple-minded small-time crook and cute policewoman fall in love and
marry. The loving couple cannot have children of their own so they decide to
steal one from a local rich family who recently had quintuplets.
Unfortunately for them, it isn't long before everyone else, including two
ex-cons, a wife swapping foreman and a nasty bounty hunter, find out about
their shenanigans, and try to cash in on their own.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A perfect film which improves with age, this movie takes all the various
elements needed to create an ideal motion picture and nails them right on
the head! Let's start from the top. Delivering a story like nobody's
business. This is a wonderfully rich and clever tale filled with many cool
characters, classic moments and interpretative showdowns. How I never saw
the obvious undertone connection between the "bad ass" Leonard Smalls
representing Cage's character's dark side is beyond me, but the more I see
the film, the more I realize that much of it is a struggle of Cage's own
psyche. But don't mind all that serious interpretation shtuff. This film is
just plain out hilariously funny! It roars with originality, features
dialogue that should be bronzed and saved for generations to come and
marinates it all with a charming score that'll have you humming it for
weeks. But that's not even the half of it. Let's talk about the
performances. All rock solid! Nicolas Cage showing us what he was all about
before he became a "big action star". Quirky, goofy, downtrodden hero with a
loving heart and a poetic mind. How could you not love this guy?</P>
<P>Holly Hunter playing the ultimate white trash wifey with a precious soul,
while others like John Goodman and Frances McDormand sweeten the pie,
stuffing the entire film with memorable performances all around. But there's
more. One of the most distinctive features of this film is its impeccably
stylized direction. I mean, foggedabouttit! Hand-held cameras running
around, crane shots, unbelievable stunt tricks (can anyone explain the knife
being thrown in the plank shot?), a classic car chase featuring a pack of
Huggies at its end and various wide-lensed sequences used only to accentuate
the film's over-the-top fantastical comedy feel. Amazing, just amazing. But
the Coen masterpiece wouldn't be complete without a touch of the
heartstrings as well. One of the last scenes featuring the husband and wife
team overlooking a child's crib gets me every time! Wow. A hilarious romp
that manages to poke a hole in our tender side, too? Whatta flick. Add all
that to the film's infectious prologue and ambiguous epilogue, and you've
got a movie that delivers on all counts and more.</P>
<P>A cool story, classic dialogue, excellent performances, a catchy soundtrack,
a unique visual flair, humor, drama, thrills, chases, love, hate and a
fantastical element soaking the entire film in a blanket of surrealism. So
if you love originality in film, if you love the stylized ventures a la Coen
and appreciate well-written words intermixed with slap-stick comedy, check
this flick out asap! "There's right and there's right and never the t'wain
shall meet." Okay, then.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars: (Courtesy of the IMDb)
The part of Edwinna was written especially for Holly Hunter. The Coen
brothers lived with Holly, Sam Raimi and Frances McDormand when they were
all first starting out in Hollywood. Of course, Frances and Joel Coen went
on to marry in 1984 and recently adopted a baby named Pedro.
Joel is the brother who usually gets the "credit" for directing their films,
but it is well known that both he and his brother Ethan direct their films
together. They also write and produce their films together, and edit most of
them under the pseudonym, Roderick Jaynes.
The shot in which the camera moves in on the mother discovering that Nathan
Jr. is gone is a direct homage to Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD, a film on which
Joel Coen was an editor.
The alarm button the clerk presses in the convenience store reads
"Odegard-Trend Security." This is the name of the security company in Sam
Raimi's CRIMEWAVE, a film the brothers Coen co-wrote with Raimi himself.
The character Leonard Smalls (Randall "Tex" Cobb) is a reference to Lenny
Small from OF MICE AND MEN.
The acronyms "P.O.E" and  "O.P.E." spray-painted in the washroom and shown
in reverse in the mirror are references to the Stanley Kubrick films DR.
STRANGELOVE OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB and THE
SHINING.
H.I. can be seen wearing a uniform with the name "Hudsucker Industries"
written on it during one of the film's earlier scenes. This is also the name
of the company in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY, also by the Coen brothers.
When Nathan Arizona is being interviewed one of the microphones has "KOEN"
written on it. This is a reference to the filmmakers, the Coen brothers.</P>
