A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:
Steven Spielberg</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: 
David Franzoni</PRE>
<PRE>Starring: 
Djimon Hounsou, Anthony Hopkins, and Matthew McConaughey</PRE>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Male model bodies, crucifix imagery, legal talk with big speech in the
end</PRE>
<P>Synopsis: 
In this movie, Steven Spielberg, one of today's finest directors,
attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the
fate of prisoner Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) - - a young angry man from
Sierra Leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow
prisoners. Cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of
America after escaping Spanish slave traders, but since the Americans
don't speak Cinque's language, the black men are hauled into court to
determine whether or not they are legally slaves. Technically, since the
international slave trade was outlawed at that time, people like Cinque
couldn't be kidnapped into slavery; one had to be born a slave to be
legally considered a slave. Lawyers Baldwin and Adams (Matthew
McConaughey and Anthony Hopkins) must prove Cinque and the others were
captured into slavery, rather than born slaves, in order to get them out
of prison as free men. Three lengthy court cases are portrayed with
Spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning, lots of facial
close-ups, big music, and dramatic imagery. A final speech by Adams is
followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened
to the various characters.</P>
<P>Opinion:
Making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life. In
fiction, one invents purposeful, clear-cut good guys and bad guys, puts
the fictional characters in conflict, and takes the tale to its exciting
conclusion. Real life, however, consists of long stretches of boredom
with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around, think
thoughts and do nothing, or come and go before events are resolved.
Spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life
story. Djimon Hounsou and Anthony Hopkins turn in excellent
performances.</P>
