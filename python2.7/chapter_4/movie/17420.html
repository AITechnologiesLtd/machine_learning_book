<P>We've got a hot little commercial commodity in Sandra Bullock. "Good, that's
good." Yeah, and we've got this burgeoning new technological creation called
the Internet revolutionizing people's lives and changing the way they live,
right? "Yeah, yeah, and...?" Don't you see? Glamorous Ms. Hollywood actress
playing the little Ms. Loner character that everyone could identify with, in
a film based on a technology which more and more people are beginning to
fear?!? "It's brilliant !!!!". Green light.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Very pretty, loner computer programming girl gets caught up in a fight for a
sacred disk. She has it, the bad guys want it. As she struggles to lose said
bad guys, she ultimately loses her identity, her reputation and her past, as
these computer pirates erase her whole life via the new technologies
embedded in the Internet.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
See Sandra Bullock type real fast on a computer. Cute. See Sandra fall upon
a massive conspiracy to launch unexpected havoc onto the world. Not so cute.
See Sandra run away from the bad guys. Nasty. See Sandra run some more. Even
nastier. Hmmm.....oh yeah, and there she goes running again. Exciting, eh?
Not really, but you get the picture. Close to two hours of Sandra running
along, finding a place to hide for a few hours, and typing some more. It
gets to be a bit repetitive, but you don't know the half of it. She has this
friend see, and he's well, he's not known by the bad guys, and he's gonna
help her out, you know, I mean, he's her only friend, and oops, oh no...how
did that happen? Oh well, back to running, I suppose.</P>
<P>But there's tension, right? I mean, a film like this one sounds like it
could really grab you by the eyelashes and rip your interest veins right
outta you, huh? <Sigh> Well, yeah, I suppose there is some tension. I mean,
I had to worry every time she ran away from the bad guys, cause I was never
sure if they were gonna catch her or not, and heck, what about her poor
friend, I mean, who knew what would happen to him? One-two-three. Can we all
count that high? Yes? Well, then you've solved the dilemma of this
screenplay (Which apparently took up to five guys to develop???) It connects
all the dots from A to Z, and leaves nothing to the imagination. The musical
score? Standard. The bad guys? Standard. The conclusion...the directing?
Standard, standard! I guess this movie wouldn't really hurt you if you were
dying and looking to kill some time before you knock, knock, knocked on
Heaven's door, but then again, it might just make your journey a little more
painful. If you're really interested in this film's valid premise, and
technology is really starting to scare the beejeezus out of you, well then
go check out ENEMY OF THE STATE (7.5/10), and enjoy a smarter script and a
wider array of stars. See Will Smith run. See Jon Voight run after him. Oh,
happy-happy, joy-joy! Now let's watch THE NET again. There's Sandra typing
so quickly. And running. Run Sandra, run!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Sandra Bullock replaced Demi Moore for the role in WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING
(7/10), and Lori Petty for the role in DEMOLITION MAN (7/10), opposite Sly
Stallone himself. She is allergic to horses, and was voted "Most likely to
brighten up your day" by her high school classmates. She's also a huge fan
of Dr. Seuss, and wrote and performed her own song "Heaven Knocking On My
Door" in the 1993 film THE THING CALLED LOVE (8/10).
There are no less than four members of the Winkler family in the cast of
this film. Good for you, Irwin, everybody needs a day job, right? :) Irwin
Winkler is better known as a producer of such great films as GOODFELLAS
(9.5/10), RAGING BULL (7.5/10) and ROCKY (8.5/10).
Screenwriters John Brancato and Michael Ferris went on to write the superb
thriller THE GAME (8/10) in 1997.</P>
