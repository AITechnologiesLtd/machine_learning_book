SOUND AND FURY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Introducing us to a world that few of us know exists, namely that of 
"deaf culture," Josh Aronson's documentary is aptly named SOUND AND FURY 
since members of the deaf community are surprisingly protective of their 
world and their culture.  The single biggest disappointment of the film 
is that we never learn exactly what comprises deaf culture, but we do 
discover that large numbers of deaf people are extremely protective of 
it.  This zealous cultural protection is fascinating.</P>
<P>The film uses the controversial cochlear implant as the focal point of 
tension between the deaf world and the hearing world.  A cochlear 
implant in the ear, if done when a child is young, is quite effective, 
allowing the child to develop hearing and speech.  But like bilingual 
education, it is controversial.  It is most effective when all of the 
subsequent education in done without the "crutch" of signing, just as 
total language immersion is more effective in teaching than a hybrid 
language approach.</P>
<P>Members of the deaf community, especially older ones, view it as a 
tragedy when a deaf person loses his deafness.  One of the deaf 
grandmothers says that she was happy and thanked God when her 
hearing-able daughter gave birth to a deaf son.  The suggestion that her 
grandson might get a hearing implant causes her to become extremely 
angry.  The word "abuse" is tossed around a lot.  One side views it as 
abuse not to give a deaf child the ability to hear while the other side 
views taking a deaf child out of the deaf world as abuse.</P>
<P>The focus of the story is a large, Long Island family.  One branch, 
Peter and Nita Artinian, who are deaf, are in sharp disagreement with 
Peter's brother Chris and his wife Mari, both of whom can hear.  Peter 
and Nita's 4-1/2-year-old deaf daughter Heather has decided that she 
wants an implant.  With a long list of sounds that she is excited about 
hearing, Heather gets her parents to look into it.  Since they feel that 
this would take Heather out of the rich deaf culture, they decide 
against it, knowing full well that, if she waits, it will be too late.</P>
<P>In contrast, Chris and Mari want all of the opportunities possible for 
their deaf, 1-year-old deaf son, so they decide to go through with the 
operation, even though Mari's deaf parents protest strongly.</P>
<P>As both families investigate the same operation and come to completely 
different conclusions, we learn a mixture of facts and folklore.  We are 
told that deaf high schools graduate students who, on average, read at a 
fourth-grade level.  When Nita defends her decision not to get the 
implant for Heather, her mother reminds Nita that she can't even read 
well enough to understand a cooking recipe.  In contrast, members of the 
deaf community raise doubts about the procedure and claim that it will 
turn the kids into robots.</P>
<P>The film takes an evenhanded approach to material that would be easy to 
slant.  Putting us inside the heads of both parents, we begin to feel 
the pain of making decisions that will affect their children forever.  
Of course, understanding some of their motivations doesn't mean that we 
can agree with them.  Sympathy is possible, but it is hard to condone 
Peter and Nita's actions.  Several analogies are suggested to them by 
Peter's parents.  Would they not want their children to see if what they 
shared with them was blindness rather than deafness?  What if they 
couldn't walk and they had children who did?  Would they want to break 
their legs?  Not accepting the analogies as being apropos, Peter and 
Nita bristle at the suggestions.  </P>
<P>Your reaction to the film may depend on your ability to hear.  Members 
of my audience who signed frequently during the movie got agitated and 
laughed at different times than I did.  The intriguing film should 
provoke strong emotions and raise excellent question regardless of the 
viewer's auditory ability.</P>
<P>SOUND AND FURY runs a fast 1:20.  The film has English subtitles and 
most of the characters sign.  It is not rated but would be a G.  Any 
child old enough to be interested could see it.</P>
