<PRE>                                   CONGO
                       A film review by Shaggy Bob
                        Copyright 1995 Shaggy Bob</PRE>
<P>     Have you ever noticed that stuff happens to ya at the worst time?
Is this some sorta curse someone placed on everyone?  I mean take
today for example.  I had an experiment (no, not that kind--it was one
of those science stuff) going for two days and I was about to take it
off.  And what happens, power goes out and I get stuck in a garage.</P>
<P>     Speaking of being stuck, CONGO came out and I had to go check it
out.  It's about this gorilla who learned how to talk and this
scientist dude who wanted to return her back to Africa.  Of course he
can't find any grants to return the monkey so he gets help from other
sources.</P>
<P>     No nakkid boobs.  15 dead bodies (and 14 same monkeys dying all
over).  147 bullets.  53 on the vomit meter.  No moon shots.  What we
got here are:  Expedition-fu, skinny dippin'-fu, attack of killer
chocolate craving-fu, paranoid dude in charge-fu, Mr. Ed-fu, Dr.
Dolittle-fu, attack of killer fuel prices-fu, sesame seed cake- fu, air
conditioner-fu, and of course attack of killer apes-fu.  Drive in
academy nomination for Dylan Walsh for saying stuff like "what is
that?" and to Earnie Hudson for responding "when moon like that comes
out, every money in two hundred miles thinks they're Elvis."  To Tim
Curry for saying stuff like "help me pick these up" and to Joe Don
Baker after sending a group to a volcano "please use the fire
extinguisher on that".  And of course to Laura Linney for saying stuff
like "Do you remember my promise?"  One and a half star.  Shaggy Bob
says check it out!</P>
<P>     Alien Alert!  Did ya hear about his guy paying some one to rape
his wife so he can watch?  Well, the rapist got caught and the wife
sued the guy.  She won and was awarded $64million.  I dunno 'bout you
but where in the world is a sleazoid like that gonna come up with that
kind of money?  I sure would like to get my hands on that kind of piggy
bank.</P>
