<P>     A woman, just fired from her job as a London public relations
executive, rushes dejectedly towards the Underground, eager to return to
the comfort of home.  A young girl steps into her path for a moment,
impeding the woman's progress just long enough so that she misses the last
train before a long, system-wide delay.  Or does she?  What if the girl
doesn't get in the woman's way, permitting her to make that last train?
How much does that one, seemingly inconsequential variable change the
woman's life?</P>
<P>     SLIDING DOORS is a gimmick film, the gimmick being that it allows us
to watch both alternate courses determined by that one moment.  When Helen
Quilley (Gwyneth Paltrow) makes the train, she meets a charming fellow
named James (John Hannah), and also gets home in time to catch her
layabout live-in boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch) in the middle of a little
afternoon delight with his ex-girlfriend Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn).  When
she misses the train, she and Gerry continue together, taking Helen down a
radically different career path.</P>
<P>     SLIDING DOORS works on enough different levels that I wonder whether
it succeeds because of its gimmick or in spite of it.  As a
straightforward relationship comedy, it's generally delightful, crafted by
writer/director Peter Howitt with unusually sharp comic dialogue.  The
principal characters are uniformly well-drawn, from the unsteady
confidence of Paltrow's Helen, to the genial wit of Hannah's James, to the
confused and almost sympathetic philandering of Lynch's Gerry.  Even a
minor supporting performance from Douglas McFerran as James' no-nonsense
best friend shines with energy and humor.  Howitt explores familiar modern
romance territory, but does it with enough intelligence and commitment to
the characters that it feels fresh.</P>
<P>     Of course, he's also playing an extended game of "what if", one which
sometimes intrudes on the perfectly enjoyable conventional narrative.
Though rookie director Howitt handles the interplay between the
story-lines with surprising deftness, the shifts from one plot to the
other often deny both plots momentum.  Nowhere is this more evident than
during a pair of climactic confrontations, where Howitt cuts back and
forth to the point of distraction.  He may be intending to build tension,
but instead he builds frustration, using neck-stapping editing to show the
pivotal moments occurring simultaneously while sacrificing dramatic
urgency.  A version of SLIDING DOORS which offered a simple,
smartly-written romantic triangle might have been just as winning without
all the fuss.</P>
<P>     It's also true that something would have been lost.  Though at first
glance SLIDING DOORS seems to flirt with the celebration of fate and
destiny so popular in recent love stories, Howitt offers something a bit
more thought-provoking than that.  By allowing us to get to know the
characters -- and Helen in particular -- as well as he does, he gives us
much more reason to believe that destiny is simply the tendency of people
to act according to their character.  Helen's determination, pride and
sense of self-worth are what make it likely that any course of her life
will have a happy ending, not the capricious opening or closing of a pair
of sliding doors on a train.  The film may be a bit of speculative
gimmickry, but it's also something more -- and less -- than that.  In some
alternate reality, Peter Howitt may have made SLIDING DOORS a romantic
comedy without a gimmick.  Like Helen's life, it's hard to know for sure
which version would have been more engaging and appealing.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 fate accomplishments:  7.</PRE>
