<PRE>MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Clint Eastwood
Writer: John Lee Hancock (based on the novel by John Berendt)
Starring: John Cusack, Kevin Spacey, Lady Chablis, Jack Thompson, Jude
Law, Alison Eastwood, Paul Hipp, Irma P. Hall, Bob Gunton, Geoffrey
Lewis, Anne Haney</P>
<P>I'm not even going to pretend that I read the book, but something tells
me that this film pays too much attention to detail and not the style
and mood.  I have a feeling that the book is a hypnotic non-fiction
account which pulls the reader into its pure off-beatness of a pretty
bizarre culture.  Even though I really did enjoy this film, and was
throughly interested the whole time, it still has some flaws in it which
ultimately pull the film down from being a possible awesome film to a
near-miss.</P>
<P>"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," for those of you who don't
know, is based on an incredibly popular non-fiction best-seller by John
Berendt, who went to cover a Christmas party in Savannah, Georgia, and
eventually bought an apartment down there after being sucked into the
culture.  In the film, he is played by the awesome John Cusack, and
re-named John Kelso.  He's never truly defined or anything, but he's
very likable as played by Mr. Cusack.</P>
<P>The film follows him around as he meets all sorts of weird Savannah-ites
throughout the course of the film, such as a man who walks a leash since
the dog he's supposed to walk has died long ago; a man who has flies and
bugs tied to leashes (Geoffrey Lewis); a voodoo lady named Minerva (Irma
P. Hall - who else?); a cool, suave piano player named Joe (Paul Hipp);
and an interesting love interest named Mandy (played by Clint's
daughter, Alison).</P>
<P>But the main person he meets is Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey), a noveau
riche aristocrat who's throwing the party John is to cover.  As played
by The Amazing Kevin, Jim is a lovable man who's suave, always looking
cool (with a lovely moustache), and an air of southern tobacco around
him whenever we see him, even when he's not smoking anything.  Even if
he's not wacky like the guy with the dog leash or the flies, he's still
the most interesting character in the film.</P>
<P>The novel, apparently lacks any real form until about 140 pages or so
into it when the whole John Grisham part occurs: Jim shoots his male
lover (Jude Law), and there's a court case over whether he did it in
cold blood or in defense.  The film dives into this about a half hour or
so into itself, seemingly so a wider audience can appreciate it.  Of
course, there are many subplots that still go on, but none which are as
focused as this one, making some of them seem almost unnecessary.</P>
<P>The most interesting other subplot deals with the relationship between
John and the Lady Chablis (played by Nathan Lane...no, sorry, it's
played by the real Lady Chablis), a transexual or transvestite (forget
which) who is more feminine than Ellen Ripley (a cheap plug: go see
"Alien: Resurrection").  She's one of the more interesting characters in
a movie, and it's awesome that she/he really exists.  I'm sure she'll
never get a moment's peace after this, though.</P>
<P>However, the most uninteresting part is the love affair between John and
Mandy.  As played by Alison Eastwood, she's a fantastically cool
character who's always interesting for the sole fact that Alison plays
her so well.  She is not written as a very interesting character, but
Alison just becomes the role (a nice plug for nepotism - take note Mr.
Coppola).  Unfortunately the writing for their romance is under-written,
and seems way too forced.  I mean, she's dating or pseudo-dating Joe in
the beginning, but whatever happens to them quickly disappears when John
shows up on the scene.  Oh well.</P>
<P>The main problem with this film is the writing.  I think that making
John the central figure doesn't really work with the film.  Apparently,
John is hardly a big factor, but here everything works around him. 
Therefore, the film isn't as fascinating, since everything we see is
through his eyes.  I would just like to see a scene where the characters
inter-act without the presence of that "yank," which they call him
repeatedly.</P>
<P>Clint Eastwood is a good director, but has always been more of a subtle
director.  He was the perfect director for "Unforgiven," but I'm not
sure if he's the right choice for this.  He's never really been an
overly cerebral director ("Unforgiven" obviously excluded), and the film
never really makes any grand themes.  The film is really like a bunch of
disjointed tales taking place in the same town, and sometimes dealing
with another (usually the big plot).  There's depth to the film, but no
greater depth.  For instance, a bit at the end about perception is
wonderful, but has nothing to do with any other part of the film.</P>
<P>"Midnight in the Garden of Good an Evil" has so much potential to be an
absolutely awesome film, and yes, it's a pretty enjoyable film (if not a
tad long - 2 1/2 hours, by the way).  I liked it, but I can't really say
it succeeded in what it was supposed to succeed in.  So, like several
films of good intentions, it falls into the class of a "near miss."</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): **1/2</PRE>
