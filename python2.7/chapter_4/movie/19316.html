<PRE>                            THE RED VIOLIN
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: More intricately plotted than the
          viewer at first expects, THE RED VIOLIN tells the
          history in episodes of a (fictional) legendary
          violin.  This is a film that gets better as it goes
          along and presents the viewer with several
          interesting puzzles.  The classical music that goes
          with the story is a definite plus.  Rating: 8 (0 to
          10), high +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     There are several different ways to write an anthology film, a
film made up of several episodes.  Some films manage to have the whole
be greater than the sum of the parts.  One that does rise well above
the parts is this history of the Red Violin, a violin of astounding
acoustical properties.  Francois Girard, who directed, co-authored the
screenplay with Don McKellar, who appears as a scientific violin
expert.  The two Canadian filmmakers previously worked together on
THIRTY-TWO SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD.  While it is not true that
each episode stands on its own as a good story, the combined film is
actually quite well-written.  The story is set at the Montreal auction
of the violin and then flashes back over the history of the violin and
its travels from Italy to Montreal.</P>
<P>     ITALY: We have the greatest violinmaker of his day Nicolo Bussotti
(played by Carlo Cecchi) of Cremona, Italy, creating a masterpiece of a
violin to coincide with the birth of his first child.  ITALY and
AUSTRIA: A young boy Kaspar Weiss (Christoph Koncz) with a Mozart-like
brilliance for music is taken from his home in Northern Italy and taken
to Vienna where he will find that his greatest impediments are not in
competition but in himself.  AUSTRIA and ENGLAND: A band of gypsies
plays the great violin for years without ever knowing its true value.
ENGLAND:  The Red Violin inspires a scoundrel (Jason Flemyng as
Frederick Pope) to make great music, but Pope does not realize how
dependent on it he becomes. CHINA: The political orthodoxy of the
Cultural Revolution teaches a cadre the price of fanaticism and forces
her to choose between love of the violin and her loyalty to the fanatic
new brand of politics sweeping China.  MONTREAL: An auction house
prepares for a public sale of musical instruments acquired from the
Chinese government.</P>
<P>     Contrary to expectation the film is at its most interesting when
it gets to the 20th Century.  We have seen other films like THE BLUE
KITE tell us how China allowed political fanaticism to impoverish and
destroy the country, but this film makes the same point much more
succinctly and at the same time plaintively. In the Montreal segment we
get a tantalizing look at 20th century analysis of a 17th century
musical instrument, from acoustics to chemical and even biological
analysis.  In addition the final segment answers several previously
unanswered questions and fits some apparently disconnected pieces
together.  We get a much better understanding of the Red Violin, what
makes it unique, and why is it red?</P>
<P>     Don McKellar seems to be becoming as ubiquitous in Canadian film
as Denholm Elliot used to be in British film.  At the 1998 Toronto
International Film Festival (where I could not get into THE RED VIOLIN)
he seemed to be associated with one film after another.  Here he
writes, directs, and acts.  Top billing goes to Samuel L. Jackson,
whose role does not become important until the final segment of the
film.  There are few familiar actors to stretch the budget, but there
is some nice location scenery.  But what is really enjoyable, as one
might suspect in a film about a great violin, is that the film has some
really excellent violin music.</P>
<P>     In short, people who are pleased with the current vogue to have
arthouse films on the theme of behind the scenes looks at how classical
music gets created, films like SHINE and HILARY AND JACKIE, films with
potent samples of good music, should find THE RED VIOLIN an
entertaining entry.  I give it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2
on the -4 to +4 scale.  (Historical note: all characters, musical
instruments, and events are fictional.)</P>
