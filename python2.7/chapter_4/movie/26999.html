"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Films about filmmaking always seem to play well with critics, and State
and Main isn't likely to be any different (for some reason, most critics
think they're in The Business).  David Mamet's (The Winslow Boy) seventh
directorial effort is a scathing, drop-dead hysterical look at the
out-of-touch insincerity of Hollywood and its uncanny ability to corrupt
everything it touches.</P>
<P>Main is set in tiny Waterford, Vermont, where the crew for a film called
`The Old Mill' has recently relocated after being kicked out of a
similar town in New Hampshire.  The film, which is supposed to be about
the search for purity set in the twilight of the 19th century, has
chosen Waterford not only for its sleepy, picturesque
porch-swing/white-picket-fence community, but also because the town is
home to two structures integral to the picture's plot – a mill and an
old firehouse.</P>
<P>Taking place in the week leading up the filming of `The Old Mill,' Main
features characters so real, so flawed and, for the most part, so
instantly dislikeable, it's hard not to find yourself immediately
wrapped up in their antics.  William H. Macy plays Walt Price, the
film's director, whose motto ("Shoot first – ask questions afterward')
is embroidered on a lucky pillow that he drags to each shoot.  Marty
Rossen (David Paymer, Bounce) is his producer, and the two men form an
intimidating pair with an aggressive manner surpassed only by their
ability to kiss the asses of their stars and trample the feelings of
pretty much everybody else.</P>
<P>The production of `The Old Mill' has plenty of hilarious stumbling
blocks to overcome before it begins principal photography.  The process
of casting extras for the film is at a standstill because of a local
play to which most of Waterford's citizens have already committed.  The
male lead (Alec Baldwin, Thomas and the Magic Railroad) has a thing for
underage girls and begins sniffing around a nubile young Waterford
native (Julia Stiles, Hamlet) as soon as he arrives in the small town.
The female star (Sarah Jessica Parker, Sex and the City) is balking at
her nude scene, despite the fact that it is clearly specified in her
contract.</P>
<P>On the more innocent side of things is Joseph Turner White (Philip
Seymour Hoffman, Almost Famous), the film's naïve
playwright-turned-screenwriter who is baffled by the behind-the-scenes
goings-on, not to mention the last-minute rewrites Price and Rossen
demand he make, even though they would completely change his original
script.  He meets a local bookseller (Rebecca Pidgeon – Mamet's
real-life wife), who becomes White's confidante and guiding light of
veracity.  Charles Durning (Everybody Loves Raymond) and Patti LuPone
(Summer of Sam) play Waterford's Mayor and his wife, who want only to
host an elaborate dinner party for the cast and crew of the film.</P>
<P>Throw in a big pothole on Waterford's Main Street, a local attorney with
political ambitions (What Lies Beneath screenwriter Clark Gregg), a
witty product-placement debate and a strange local catchphrase that the
filmies adopt as their own, and you'll start to wonder how Mamet was
able to pack all of this into a 90-minute film.  Heck, I was sad when it
ended, wishing it could continue for at least another 90.  The
writer/director's trademark hypnotically rhythmic salvos will do that
kind of thing to you.  The carefully written dialogue makes Main so much
more than just a classier, feature-film version of the short-lived
television show Action.</P>
<P>Another thing you can expect from a Mamet film is incredible acting
performances, and Main doesn't disappoint in that category, either.
Several actors could be in the hunt for Oscar nominations, especially
Hoffman, who plays his most normal (and most romantic) role to date as
the beleaguered screenwriter.  Main reminded me of the Mamet-penned Wag
the Dog, which also dealt with unscrupulous film folk and their
behind-the-scene shenanigans.  My only complaint (other than the short
running time) is a story thread involving the stained glass window of
Waterford's firehouse that goes unresolved.</P>
<P>If Kevin Bacon would only appear in one of Mamet's films, it would make
playing `The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon' a lot easier.  With Main, Mamet
seems to borrow a majority of his cast from the regulars that turn up in
Paul Thomas Anderson's films.  Anderson, in turn, seems to do his
casting from the roster of acting talent involved in films made by the
Coen brothers.  Hoffman and Macy were both in Anderson's Magnolia and
the Coens' The Big Lebowski.  Ricky Jay and Gregg were also in Magnolia,
as well as Mamet's The Spanish Prisoner.  And Durning is in the Coens'
upcoming O Brother, Where Art Thou?, in addition to the film version of
Mamet's play, Lakeboat.</P>
