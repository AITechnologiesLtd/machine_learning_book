                        A film review by Robert Strohmeyer

<P>Despite Fox's attempts to market this film on the coattails of director
Henry Selick's success with Tim Burton vehicle The Nightmare Before
Christmas, be thou not fooled.  Monkeybone bears none of the charm or
character of its predecessor.  The story of a cartoonist (Brendan
Fraser) who falls into a coma and enters a world where the star he
created, Monkeybone (who is -- get this -- both a monkey and a metaphor
for the cartoonist's own penis), this film lacks as much in the way of
creative inspiration as it does in taste.</P>
<P>It's not that the unending stream of preschoolish fart and pecker jokes
are offensive, they're just tiresome and invariably expected.  And they
persist, from the opening scene to the entirely unsurprising
conclusion.  Fortunately, though, the film has some subplots. 
Unfortunately, they're absolutely senseless.</P>
<P>Bridget Fonda plays the cartoonist's girlfriend, to whom he had intended
to propose before his accident.  As such, she serves sort of blandly as
his motivation to return to the world.  On the other hand, Rose McGowan
plays the purring catwoman in the fantasy world, and she's plenty of
reason to stay.  The cartoonist, however, is not tempted (though any
other male with a pulse might be), and the feline nymph assists him in
returning to the world to save his body and his girlfriend from the
treachery of the monkey.  Along the way we are treated to a
mesmerizingly lame appearance from Saturday Night Live's Chris Kattan,
who we all will someday recognize as the same sort of one trick pony
Dana Carvey (remember that wacky Church Lady?) turned out to be.</P>
<P>Attempting to pinpoint exactly where this flick goes awry is a tricky
thing to do.  Between the cold fish delivery of the sophomoric dialogue
and the insanely infantile butthole humor, it's really a toss-up. 
Surviving the first half of this 82-minute nightmare is easy enough. 
It's the second half that kills, as the wildly desperate "plot twists"
kick in and Stephen King turns up for his ridiculous cameo to make a
tired Cujo joke.</P>
<P>Chances are, if you're a die-hard Brendan Fraser fan, you'll love this
movie in the same way you love all of his idiotic work.  But, if you're
over the age of 12 and still have at least a third of your brain cells,
you'll do well to spend your seven dollars elsewhere.  Then again, Rose
McGowan....</P>
