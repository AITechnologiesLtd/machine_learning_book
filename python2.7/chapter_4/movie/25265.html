<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Confession time: though I live in Newfoundland, I don't watch many 
Canadian movies. This is not exactly by choice -- the simple fact of the 
matter is that Canadian films make up an exceedingly small fraction of 
those shown at local theatres. Indeed, the only Canadian picture which 
showed locally during the first half of 2000 was "Misery Harbour", a 
co-production with Swedish, Norwegian and Danish firms.</P>
<P>The reason for this, I guess, is that Canadian cinema has a reputation 
for being very "artsy" and inaccessible. In my admittedly limited 
experience, I haven't seen a lot to dissuade me from that opinion. Like 
it or not, audiences in general prefer more mainstream fare, and until 
Canadian filmmakers accept this, the situation isn't likely to change.</P>
<P>Fortunately, at least one Canadian movie this year does fit the 
"mainstream" bill -- and without sacrificing its artistic integrity. That 
movie is "New Waterford Girl", fresh from the 1999 Toronto Film Festival, 
set in the coal-mining town of New Waterford, on Cape Breton island in 
Nova Scotia. For the geographically-challenged amongst you, Cape Breton 
lies about 60 miles across the Cabot Strait from the south-west corner of
Newfoundland, and its culture and atmosphere share a lot in common with 
this province. Consequently, I could easily relate to much of the 
material -- the accents and attitudes found in New Waterford are not 
dissimilar from many outport Newfoundland communities.</P>
<P>That said, "New Waterford Girl" is a movie for everyone, not just 
Atlantic Canadians. I do wonder, though, how many Mainlanders will 
recognise the pinpoint accuracy of the seemingly exaggerated portrayal of 
a rural Maritimes community. (If you don't know whether you're a 
Mainlander, trust me, you are one.)</P>
<P>New Waterford in the 1970s is an isolated, conservative town where 
Catholicism is still a vital part of everyday life. Fifteen year-old 
Mooney Pottie (Liane Balaban) is a talented artist, but has resigned 
herself to a life of limited possibilities. When her eccentric high 
school teacher (Andrew McCarthy) secures her a full scholarship to 
prestigious New York art school, Mooney is initially exuberant. But her 
family, including father Francis (Nicholas Campbell), mother Cookie (Mary 
Walsh) and four siblings, are horrified at the prospect of Mooney leaving 
New Waterford, convinced that no good will befall her.</P>
<P>Into this desperate milieu arrive Lou Benzoa (Tara Spencer-Nairn) and her 
mother Midge (Cathy Moriarty), the Potties' new next-door neighbours. 
They come from the Bronx, where Lou's ex-boxer father got into some sort 
of hot water with the law. Despite being treated with suspicion by the 
locals ("You're not Catholic?"), the free-spirited Lou falls in love with 
New Waterford and quickly befriends Mooney, reinvigorating her dreary 
life. With Lou's help, Mooney concocts a scandalous scheme to escape New 
Waterford by ruining her own virginal reputation and then claiming she's
pregnant. This will ensure a trip to Antigonish (on the Nova Scotia 
mainland) to have the purported baby, from where she can travel to New 
York before anyone is the wiser.</P>
<P>Although the story of "New Waterford Girl" is fairly typical 
coming-of-age fare, rarely has this sort of tale been told with such 
delicious humor. The script, by Tricia Fish, is peppered with lovely 
moments. Witness the scene where Mooney feebly "tries out" for the 
national high jump team, for example, and patiently explains that her 
poor performance was because "these aren't my normal shoes". Delightfully 
inventive is a subplot in which Lou discovers that pugilism runs in her 
blood and becomes the enforcer for the lovelorn ladies of New Waterford. 
Only a climactic boxing match feels contrived.</P>
<P>There is also a certain authenticity to the proceedings: the teens of New 
Waterford get drunk and make out and argue with their families just like 
young people really do. There is little of the exaggerated behaviour that 
often characterises these sorts of movies; at times "New Waterford Girl" 
has an almost documentary feel.</P>
<P>The direction by Allan Moyle ("Pump Up The Volume") is very capable, 
abetted by Derek Rogers' cinematography. The stark, uncompromising beauty 
of the Cape Breton coastline is depicted superbly, without making the 
movie feel like a travelogue. The only tech problem is the sound, which
sometimes results in indistinct dialogue.</P>
<P>But "New Waterford Girl"'s biggest asset is its cast, excellent almost 
without exception. Newcomer Liane Balaban is a real find, looking not 
unlike Natalie Portman and -- more importantly -- with acting skills to 
match. Her Mooney is a wonderful character, neither too cynical nor too 
pitiable, and with a palpable intelligence. Mooney's scheme to fake 
pregnancy could have come across as goofy, but the conviction Balaban 
brings to the role makes it work.</P>
<P>Spencer-Nairn's Lou provides a good contrast, vivacious and daring. 
Mooney can't wait to get out of Cape Breton; Lou enjoys New Waterford, a 
welcome change from timeworn plot of the big city kid who moves to a 
small town and loathes it. Spencer-Nairn has terrific chemistry with 
Balaban and a real presence onscreen. The only thing that mars her 
performance is that the film seems to conveniently forget its implication 
that the Benzoas are on the run. That Lou seems utterly dismissive of the 
fact struck me as hard to swallow.</P>
<P>Amongst the supporting players, veteran actors Campbell ("Da Vinci's 
Inquest") and Walsh ("CODCO", "This Hour Has 22 Minutes") are grand as 
Mooney's parents, evoking both desperation and honest caring when 
confronted with Mooney's situation. As for the two big-name Hollywood 
actors, Moriarty is rather underutilised, but McCarthy delivers a 
laudable low-key performance.</P>
<P>It's unfortunate that more people don't have the chance right now to see 
"New Waterford Girl" (it's making its way only slowly across Canada, and 
the producers have yet to secure a US distribution deal so it will 
probably be confined to festivals). It is a touching and funny movie, and 
marks the start of a very promising career for Balaban. As "New Waterford 
Girl" ably demonstrates, Canadian cinema is alive and well. I, for one, 
am eager to see more of it.</P>
