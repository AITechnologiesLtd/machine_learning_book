<PRE>            18th ANNUAL SEATTLE INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL PREVIEW
                         A film review by Jeff Meyer
                          Copyright 1992 Jeff Meyer</PRE>
<P>     I'm a bit late with the usual Seattle Film Festival preview; it
opened last night with Yves Roberts new romantic comedy, LE BAL DES
CASSE-PIEDS.  (From the description, the film sounds good, but an
opening night ticket is $25, which made me decide to skip it (as usual).
The price tag includes the opening night party; the champagne's okay,
but we're talking *very* cheap goose pate here.)</P>
<P>     *Anyway*, the Festival expects another bumper crop this year, after
a whopping 70% of last year's SIFF showings sold out (nearly 100,000
admissions.)  Not bad for a regional festival, or for a non-profit
organization; it also is one of the longest (if not the longest)
festival in North America, running continuously for 3 1/2 weeks.  This
year it expands from three to four theaters, adding the Neptune theater
in the U District (it looked to me like they've got a new screen in
there when I saw CASTLE OF CAGLIASTRO there last week.)  Not that many
more films have been added, but almost every film is being shown twice.
This is greatly appreciated by we fanatics, particularly as the showings
are within no more than two days of one another, making planning a
somewhat simpler task.</P>
<P>     As usual, I've purchased a Full Series pass, which allows me to get
into everything but the Opening Night film, the two seminars being held,
and a new sub-festival within the SIFF, a Children's Film Festival.
Below are some of the major events and/or films that have interested me
from the 18th Annual SIFF Festival, and which I plan to (in most cases)
consider seeing.  Any comments for or against seeing these, or
info/rumor/slander you've heard about them, will be gladly accepted.</P>
<PRE>===========================</PRE>
<P>OPENING NIGHT: LE BAL DES CASSE-PIEDS (France, 1992) a US premiere, a
romantic comedy by Yves Robert, who did my two favorite SIFF films of
last year, MY FATHER'S GLORY and THE CASTLE OF MY MOTHER (not to mention
THE TALL BLOND MAN WITH ONE BLACK SHOE.)  A veterinarian (Jean
Rochefort) is deserted by his wife, and after a period adrift, has a
witty, urbane beauty (Miou Miou) enter his life.  You can guess the
rest.  Given the director and the cast, I have a hard time seeing this
being a disaster, or even a crisis.</P>
<P>CLOSING NIGHT: EQUINOX (USA, 1992), a new Alan Ruldoph (directed &
written) film, has twin brothers, separated at birth.  One grows up in a
loving family, one doesn't, and they proceed through their lives until
they run into one another at the end.  Both brothers are played by
Matthew Modine.  Others include Lara Flynn Boyle (TWIN PEAKS), M.  Emmet
Walsh as the good brother's foster father, and Fred Ward as the gang
chief who recruits the other brother.  Lori Singer's in it, too.</P>
<P>RETROSPECTIVE/TRIBUTE: To Robert Wise, director of classics such as THE
DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, THE SAND
PEBBLES, THE HAUNTING, STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE (oops!), and film
editor on CITIZEN KANE.  Certainly one of the most varied and
interesting film careers around.  The films that will be shown (for
free, except THE HAUNTING) are:</P>
<P>    THE BODY SNATCHER: Boris Karloff, Henry Daniell, and Bela Lugosi in
    a Val Lewton (CAT PEOPLE) suspense film; Halliwell says this is the
    best of the Lewton films.</P>
<P>    THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL: Good-natured scientific hi-jinks in
    Washington, D.C.  :-)</P>
<P>    THE SET-UP: A down-and-out boxer is expected to get beaten by his
    younger opponent.  Robert Ryan in the title role.</P>
<P>    SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME: Paul Newman's second film, a documentary
    of Rocky Graziano (another boxer, kids.)</P>
<P>    THE HAUNTING: Absolutely wonderful, *spooky* British film which THE
    LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE was based on.  Great cinematography and
    atmosphere.  Wise will attend and talk about his career.</P>
<P>    [Actually, THE HAUNTING was based on the novel THE HAUNTING OF HILL
    HOUSE by Shirley Jackson, while THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE was based
    on the novel HELL HOUSE by Richard Matheson.  -Moderator]</P>
<P>ARCHIVAL PRESENTATIONS:  Several restored/re-discovered films are being
shown at this year's festival.  A 1924 silent version of PETER PAN,
photographed by James Wong Howe, and with piano accompaniment by Robert
Israel.  ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS, an Italian epic from 1960 (never shown
in its three-hour uncut form in the US) about a Sicilian woman and her
five sons that move to Milan to make a better life for themselves
(Halliwell gives this two stars.)  And Michael Curtiz's part silent,
part-talkie 1929 version of NOAH'S ARK--biblical epic in the Hollywood
manner.</P>
<P>THE SECRET FESTIVAL:  Nobody knows what's going to be shown, and when we
find out, we can't tell anybody.  It's usually esoteric, though.  (My
personal hope: Fox's BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  My personal fear: FIRE,
WALK WITH ME.)</P>
<PRE>And the international selection...</PRE>
<P>EVENTS LEADING UP TO MY DEATH (Canada, 1991), a comedy about a young man
trying to escape the web of his Suburban Family From Hell.</P>
<P>THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL (Czechoslovakia, 1991), which recounts a young
boy's memory of a substitute teacher who becomes a hero to his class,
but doesn't quite live up to his reputation.</P>
<P>LA DISCRETE (France, 1990), a wry film about a young writer who, when
his girlfriend dumps him, decides to go out, seduce a woman, and then
dump her, recounting the entire experience in a book.  His plan does not
go the way he planned.</P>
<P>ZEBRAHEAD (USA, 1992) about an inter-racial romance in Detroit.</P>
<P>EIGHT BALL (Australia, 1992), describes an ex-con and a handyman who
become friends, and their efforts to raise the former's son.</P>
<P>FLIRTING (Australia, 1990)  Another Australian coming-of-age film, this
one set in 1965 and involving inter-racial romance.</P>
<P>SPOTSWOOD (Australia, 1991)  Anthony Hopkins plays an efficiency expert
sent to a moccasin factory to improve productivity, who discovers the
pleasures of living a bit more leisurely.  (This does look good.)</P>
<P>MONTREAL SEXTET (Canada, 1991)  A collection of vignettes by six
directors set in Montreal.</P>
<P>WISECRACKS (Canada, 1991)  A collection of routines and interviews by
female comics, including Whoopi Goldberg, Paula Poundstone, The
Clichettes, and Kim Wayans.</P>
<P>SWORDSMAN IN DOUBLE-FLAG TOWN (China, 1990)  Basically a cross between a
swordsman epic and a western.</P>
<P>ZENETROPA (Denmark, 1991)  Already reviewed in rec.arts.movies.reviews.
I think I'll give it a miss.</P>
<P>BETTY BLUE L'INTEGRAL (France, 1986/91)  BETTY BLUE with footage cut
from the original, i.e.  a Director's Cut.  From the guy who directed
DIVA.</P>
<P>THE HAIRDRESSER'S HUSBAND (France, 1990) Jean Rochert plays a man who
enjoys hairdressers and haircuts, and how he falls in love with one (a
hairdresser, not a haircut.)</P>
<P>L'ELEGANT CRIMINEL (France, 1990)  Daniel Auteuil plays a criminal that
Lacenaire, the character in LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS, was based on.</P>
<P>LESSONS IN DARKNESS (Germany, 1992)  Warner Herzog's new film, a
collection of scenes during and after the invasion of Kuwait.</P>
<P>MARTHA AND I (Germany, 1990)  A new, gentle drama starring Marianne
Sagebracht of BAGHDAD CAFE.  A boy grows up in his Uncle's house before
the outbreak of WWII in Prague.</P>
<P>A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME (Great Britain, 1992):  A new documentary by
Errol Morris (THE THIN BLUE LINE), on the writings of Stephen Hawkins.
Music by Philip Glass--this looks good.</P>
<P>THE DIRECTOR'S PLACE (Great Britain, 1991):  Developed by the BBC, this
is a series of portraits about well-known directors, in this case John
Boorman and Nagisa Oshima.</P>
<P>ENCHANTED APRIL (Great Britain, 1991)  Miranda Richardson and Joan
Plowright in the story of four British women in the 1920's who rent a
villa on the Italian coast.</P>
<P>THE FAVOR, THE WATCH AND THE VERY BIG FISH (Great Britain/France, 1991)
Bob Hoskins *and* Jeff Goldblum?  I'd go for it.  Hoskins plays a
photographer of religious art who is told he must find a model to pose
for Jesus.  A hirsute Jeff Goldblum turns out to be a dead ringer for
Him.</P>
<P>NAKED MAKING LUNCH (Great Britain, 1992).  The making of NAKED LUNCH
(the movie, not the book.)  Cronenberg and Burroughs (and Davis and
Weller) are all interviewed.</P>
<P>ONE FULL MOON (Great Britain, 1991)  An atmospheric Welsh film about a
boy and his guilt.</P>
<P>A QUESTION OF ATTRIBUTION (Great Britain, 1991).  Almost ten years ago,
director John Schlesinger and writer Alan Bennett put together one of my
favorite little films, AN ENGLISHMAN ABROAD, about Coral Browne meeting
exiled spy Guy Burgess in Moscow.  A really wonderful film.  Now they
have both returned to do a film on another one of the members of the
infamous spy scandal, Sir Anthony Blunt.  Blunt is played by James Fox,
his new inquisitor is played (in a remarkably fine piece of casting) by
David Calder (recognizable to some from the BBC STAR COPS series), and
Prunella Scales as (I am not joking) Queen Elizabeth.</P>
<P>[I just saw this tonight--a really excellent film to start the
 festival out with.  It jumps very well between the searching for
 truth in the investigation of art and the searching for truth in
 investigations of people.  Calder plays marvelously well against
 Fox, and Fox has a wonderful 10 minute dialogue with Scales,
 with both of them talking about one thing and meaning something
 completely different.  Top-notch; as good, I think, as AN
 ENGLISHMAN ABROAD, though not having the wonderful finale of the
 first film.]</P>
<P>THE SUSPENDED STRIDE OF THE STORK (Greece, 1991)  A new film by Theo
Angelopoulos, dealing with a TV reporters story into the fate of refuges
and political exiles in Europe.</P>
<P>DAYS OF BEING WILD (Hong Kong, 1991)  A big award-winner in the Hong
Kong film awards, it details the strangely-linked lives of a group of
young people in Hong Kong in the 60s.</P>
<P>ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA (Hong Kong, 1991)  YES!  A new Tsui Hark
(CHINESE GHOST STORY, TERRA-COTTA WARRIOR, SWORDSMAN) high-adrenaline
martial-arts manic film.  Set in 1875, a young patriot works at changing
the government of China, while attempting to rescue his gal from nasty
American slave traders.  Ya gotta love it!</P>
<P>THE STRANGER (India, 1991)  The last film of the late Satyajit Ray, a
long-lost uncle comes to live with a "modern" Indian family.</P>
<P>THE BACHELOR (Italy, 1991)  Filmed in English, this features Keith
Carradine as a young Victorian man and the women he meets.  It also
stars Miranda Richardson and Max Von Sydow.</P>
<P>BOILING POINT and A SCENE BY THE SEA (Japan, 1991):  Two new films by
Takeshi Kitano, who directed and starred in last Festival's VIOLENT COP.
(Given that film, I'll probably skip these two, though the latter is in
a very different vein.)</P>
<P>HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (Mexico, 1992)  A new film by Alex (REPO MAN, SID AND
NANCY) Cox.</P>
<P>THE LEGEND OF THE MASK (Mexico, 1990)  A deceased masked wrestler is
given the Citizen Kane treatment.</P>
<P>ROY ROGERS, KING OF THE COWBOYS (Netherlands, 1991)  A man who grew up
loving Roy Rogers movies as a kid comes to America to meet his idols.
He does!</P>
<P>THE BEWILDERED KING (Spain, 1991)  Supposedly the first comedy of
manners set during the Spanish Inquisition.  (Except by Monty Python.)</P>
<P>BROTHER'S KEEPER (USA, 1992)  A documentary about a group of
impoverished bachelor brothers who, when one is found dead by the
police, are arrested for murder; and the outpouring of support for
Delbert Ward, the accused brother from the community that had left the
brothers.</P>
<P>GALAXIES ARE COLLIDING (USA, 1992)  Right before his wedding, guy is
getting very weird, and goes out into the desert and disappears.  Family
assumes he's dead and turns the wedding into a funeral.  I don't know;
I've had bad vibes about bizarre comedies set in the desert since that
awful thing with Crispin Glover last year.</P>
<P>GAS, FOOD, AND LODGING (USA, 1992)  Brooke Adams and Ione Skye as mother
and daughter, living in a small New Mexico town, in a "small, personal
drama."</P>
<P>INSIDE MONKEY ZETTERLAND (USA, 1992)  Another one of those 1001 crazy
character dark comedies, notable for having Rupert Everett, Katherine
Helmond, Sofia Coppola, Bo Hopkins and (aiieee!)  Sandra Bernhard in it.</P>
<P>JOHNNY SUEDE (USA, 1991)  This has gotten a lot of word-of-mouth.
Basically, a guy gets hit on the head, and thinks he's the next Rickie
Nelson.</P>
<P>MAD AT THE MOON (USA, 1992)  The new film by Martin (APARTMENT ZERO)
Donovan, about a woman (Mary Stuart Masterson) in the early 1900s who
marries a farmer (Stephen Blake) but is still in love with a
ne'er-do-well (Hart Bocher).  Suspense follows.</P>
<P>MONSTER IN A BOX (USA, 1991)  The new Spaulding Gray talks-to-the-camera
film.</P>
<P>NIGHT ON EARTH (USA, 1991)  The new Jim Jarmusch let's-wander-around
film.  Has Winona Ryder as a cab driver, for the info of the r.a.movies
Winona legion.</P>
<P>RAMPAGE (USA, 1991, but supposedly kept from distribution for six years)
William Friedkin's story of a serial killer who is definitely nuts, and
the D.A.'s (Michael Bien) struggle to decide whether he should ask for
the death penalty or not.</P>
<P>THE WATERDANCE (USA, 1992)  Neal Jimenez's (writer of RIVER'S EDGE and
FOR THE BOYS) partially-autobiographical story of a writer who breaks
his back and goes through the changes this brings about.  Stars Eric
Stoltz, Wesley Snipes, and Bill Forysthye.</P>
<P>THE ENQUIRERS (USA, 1992)  Takes the idea of "what if all those Elvis
sitings in the tabloids were *true*?"  You mean they aren't?!</P>
<P>NOT MOZART (Great Britain, 1991, video):  A collection of shorts that
are sort of about Mozart.  One, M IS FOR MAN, MUSIC, MOZART is by Peter
Greenaway.</P>
<PRE>----</PRE>
<P>Oh....  and *how* could I forget the Midnight Festival?  Good dirty
trash, as you like it.  Luckily for us slowly fading yuppies, they've
limited it to Saturday nights only.  Films are:</P>
<P>    THE ICEMAN COMETH (Hong Kong, 1991) A good and evil super-swordsman
    are frozen in the Ming Dynasty, but are rejuvenated in the present
    day!  (No doubt sharing the same iceberg as Captain America.)  They
    both cope with the modern world, before their inevitable climatic
    battle.</P>
<P>    VEGAS IN SPACE (USA, 1992)  Sort of like FLESH GORDON, but
    cheesier.  The adventures of Captain Dan Tracy of the U.S.S.
    Intercourse...</P>
<P>    SEX AND ZEN (Hong Kong, 1991)  Man in ancient China loves girls.
    Man is funny and is a poet and sings well and flosses regularly.
    Unfortunately, man has small penis.  So man takes the obvious
    solution: he has magician transplant a horses' sexual organ onto
    himself.  "Zany and full of laffs!"  Unh-huh.</P>
<P>    REVENGE OF BILLY THE KID (Great Britain, 1991):  I think I'll
    just quote this one verbatim: "When frisky farmer Gyles
    Macdonald, uncouth and alcoholic, has a torrid liaison with the
    farmyard goat, little does he know of the horrific consequences
    that will ensue."  I'll bet!  (Maybe this film was based on
    University of Washington Fraternity activities.)</P>
<PRE>-----</PRE>
<P>Like I said--let me know if you've good, bad or indifferent things to
say about any of these.  As usual, I'll burn myself out over the next
three weeks, take a couple of months to recover, and get reviews out in
July or August.  Until then, Aloha.</P>
