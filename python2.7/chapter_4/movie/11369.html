<PRE>                            Rebel Without A Cause</PRE>
<P>A review by Chris Holland & Scott Hamilton of <A HREF="http://www.stomptokyo.com/">http://www.stomptokyo.com/</A></P>
<PRE>                        Our rating: four lava lamps (out of 5).</PRE>
<P>One of our older friends, now fifty-something, once related the experience
of seeing Rebel Without a Cause for the first time:</P>
<P>"I stumbled out of the theater, just in shock... people my age came up to
me and said, 'What's it about?' and all I could say was 'It's about us!'
...In those days, Hollywood just didn't make movies like that. It was
important to suddenly have a movie that was about us."</P>
<P>Certainly, this is Rebel's claim to fame: it was one of the first films to
portray its teen generation of moviegoers in a semi-realistic (if overly
dramatized) fashion. Unfortunately, its success led to a glut of teen
exploitation films which still surface now and again (Switchblade Sisters,
anyone?). But this film itself is not to blame.</P>
<P>James Dean plays Jim Stark, the first in what will be a trio of main
characters with first names starting with J. Jim begins the film nearly
passed out in a gutter, and is brought into the police station on charges
of public drunkenness. There he briefly meets Judy (Natalie Wood) and
Johnny, better known as Plato (Sal Mineo). Jim is new in the neighborhood,
and we guess this is the way he gets to know people -- through the
friendly local law-enforcement offices.</P>
<P>The morning after his parents rescue him from the police (thereby
revealing a whole set of dysfunctional family problems), Jim runs into
Plato and Judy again. Although Plato, an outsider in his own right, is
immediately accepting of Jim, Judy is somewhat harder to win over. She
runs with a rough crowd, and Jim's initiation into that crowd is equally
rough.</P>
<P>During the course of the initiation (a high stakes game of chicken),
Judy's boyfriend is killed, and she immediately bonds with the sensitive
Jim. Meanwhile the boyfriend's gang (including a young Dennis Hopper)
decide that Jim has ratted them out to the police and decide to hunt Jim
down.</P>
<P>The rest of the movie documents what happens that night.</P>
<P>Today, a lot of the movie seems pretty silly. An early scene takes place
during a planetarium show, and the show itself appears to be narrated by
some wierdo who broke into the observatory, started the show, and is just
making it up as he goes along. This is the kind of film where even the bad
kids wear ties. There is also a lot of painfully self-aware dialogue, but
that's pretty much par for the course in any serious film from this time
period.</P>
<P>However, what viewers watching the film today will notice above anything
else is that Plato is gay. Now, Rebel was made in 1955 and there was a
self-censorship board in the U.S. that didn't allow the subject of
homosexuality to be portrayed in films, but Plato is about as gay as a
character could be in a 1950's movie. Besides Sal Mineo's constant
come-hither looks at James Dean, there is also some very interesting
dialogue. Here are some of Plato's best lines, delivered in a rush to
James Dean:</P>
<P>"Hey, you want to come home with me? I mean there's nobody home at my
house and heck, I'm not tired. Are you? See, I don't have too many people
I can talk to... If you want to come, we could talk, and in the morning,
we could have breakfast like my dad used to. Gee, if only you could have
been my dad."</P>
<P>Okay, at the end it gets into kind of a weird area, but you get the idea.
A lot of Plato's problems (his alienation from his family, his ostracism
from the school crowd, his urges to kill small animals) can reasonably be
traced back to the fact that he is gay and from society's reactions to
that. He's completely smitten with Jim, probably because Jim is so
self-absorbed that he doesn't realize that Plato is gay or even what gay
means. But hey, this is all just theory, right? No one actually comes out
and says that Plato prefers the company of men....</P>
<P>Rebel Without a Cause is, if nothing else, a fiercely honest movie (on
points other than Plato's sexuality). Dean's portrayal of Jim is both
vulnerable and defiant, and the disparities between Judy's sex-kitten
school persona and confused, rejected daughter-self at home reveal a lot
about the amount of information withheld from teenagers in the 1950's.</P>
<P>Jim: Nobody talks to children. Judy: No, they just tell them.</P>
<P>We suspect that Rebel Without a Cause (and other films like it) had a lot
to do with the changes in Hollywood that were soon to happen; it was
certainly a harbinger of the change in American culture looming just over
the decade's horizon. In any case, it's a wonderful movie if you can
adjust to the time period and realize that if the lines seem cheesy, at
least the feelings behind them were real.<HR>This review copyright 1998 by Chris Holland & Scott Hamilton. To see the
