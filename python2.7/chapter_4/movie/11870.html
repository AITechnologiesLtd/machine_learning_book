<PRE>THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS, the new live-action version by the Monty
Python gang, is playing now in very limited theatrical distribution in
the United States.  If it comes to a city near you, as it is now in our
area, you'd better see it immediately or it'll be history before you
can blink an eye.  And being easily one of the most unusual family
films in years, you don't want to let this one slip by you.  Even if
you haven't got any kids - the adults outnumbered the children in our
Saturday matinee audience by 10 to 1 - you don't want to miss out on
this little delight.</P>
<P>     Writer and director Terry Jones sticks fairly close to the story
and the cadence of the original Kenneth Grahame novel.  And his players
approach their parts almost reverentially as befits such a classic.  It
is not until the movie's midway point, during Toad's trial, that the
actors begin to really cut loose with the comedy.  Up until then they
keep the humor on the subtle side, which is fine since it is in its
delicacy and beauty that the film is most effective.  If you're looking
for a cartoonish action picture, in which stupidity reigns supreme and
bonks on the head are the height of comedy, this isn't it.</P>
<P>     As filmed by CON AIR's cinematographer David Tattersall, the
radiant picture has a golden autumnal look.  Every one of the daylight
scenes appear to have been filmed when the sun was low on the horizon,
basking everything in a loving glow.</P>
<P>     THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK's costume designer, James Acheson, came
up both with the magical costumes that carefully evoke each actor's
animal and with the sets worthy of a Disney theme park attraction.  (In
fact, those who have been to Disneyland will cherish Mr. Toad's Wild
Ride even more after seeing it acted out in the movie.)  The evil
weasels, for example, have long orange coats and hair, dark elliptical
sunglasses, and devilish little mustaches.  Toady, played with wild
abandon by the film's director and writer Terry Jones, has an
overstuffed costume, long narrow shoes, and pond green make-up.  And so
forth through all of the other animals.</P>
<P>     Steve Coogan plays a humble Mole, who starts the story off when
the nefarious weasels crush his underground home.   Eric Idle is Ratty,
whose whiskers fold like an accordion when danger lurks.  Nicol
Williamson is the take-charge Badger.  Antony Sher plays wicked Chief
Weasel.  John Cleese shows up briefly as Mr. Toad's lawyer at the
trial, which is the movie's best scene.  (He condemns his own client's
wild driving so effectively that all the prosecution wants to do is
shake his finger at Toad and go "tsk, tsk, tsk!")  Stephen Fry plays
the judge in the kangaroo - actually rabbit except for one weasel
impersonating a rabbit - court.  The judge wants to hang Toady for his
reckless driving but settles for 20 years, eventually raised to 100
when Toad goes berserk in court.  And finally, Michael Palin is the
talking sun.</P>
<P>     The basic plot has the weasels conniving to take over Toad's
massive ancestral home, the famous Toad Hall.  Toady, a classic
wastrel, chases one fad after another.  His current infatuation is with
motor cars, and, being a miserable driver, this becomes quite an
expensive hobby for him.  Although played fairly straight, the show's
outlandish touches, such as Toad's long tongue that he uses to catch
flies and even to help him escape, are done sparingly.</P>
<P>     The movie has not only dialog but a bit of singing as well.  The
whole story is developed in such an offbeat and methodical manner that
many people, especially kids, may not know quite what to make of it.
If they've read the book, it probably helps, but those looking for the
traditional movie-going experience may be mystified by this one.  For
those with an open mind and heart, the picture is a treasure worth
savoring.  Don't miss this delicate mixture of tenderness and whimsy.
If you wait, it'll be gone as fast as Toad in one of his motor cars.</P>
<P>     THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS runs just 1:20.  It is rated PG for
fanciful villainy and would be fine for all ages.</P>
<P>     My son Jeffrey, almost 9, and his friend George, age 7, thought
the film was good, especially the scene in which the heroes dance on
the table while punching the weasels.  Jeffrey's friend Jessica, almost
9, thought the picture was okay, and said that her favorite part was
when Toad dressed up as a woman to escape.</P>
