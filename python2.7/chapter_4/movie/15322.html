<P>In "American History X," Edward Norton gives an Oscar-worthy performance 
as Derek Vinyard, a racist skinhead. What a sight he is to behold. Black 
and white flashbacks show Derek, often shirtless and very buff, dazzling 
those around him with his ferocious rhetoric and fiery behavior. He is 
smart, sexy and charismatic and it's easy to understand why others are 
drawn to him. </P>
<P>"American History X" works the audience as well as Derek works his 
followers. While the racist words and actions are incredibly repellent, 
the flashback scenes are lovingly filmed in an attractive, high-quality 
music video fashion. Even when the action turns horribly violent, it's 
depicted as stylishly as a commercial for perfume or blue jeans. The 
filmmakers condemn the hate, but the perpetrators of said hate look so 
damn cool. Think "Pulp Fiction" or "A Clockwork Orange" and you'll know 
what I mean. </P>
<P>The intent is obvious. The film uses sex and style to draw us in, then 
flips everything around to rub our noses in our own voyeuristic 
complicity. We viscerally experience how seductive well-phrased hate 
speech and violent imagery can be, then we are shown the tragic 
consequences of that mentality. It's a risky tactic. I've read reports of 
skinheads cheering during sections of "American History X." Sadly, some 
people will walk out of this film energized by the hate rhetoric and 
glamorization of violence. Hopefully, most viewers will get the point. </P>
<P>Set in sunny Venice Beach, we meet young Danny (Edward Furlong), a bright 
student who worships older brother Derek, a zealot in the local white 
supremacist movement. Derek's rhetoric turns to action, ending in a 
brutal assault that lands him in prison for manslaughter. Three years 
later, on the day of Derek's release, Danny hands his teacher a glowing 
essay on "Mein Kampf." The furious instructor hauls the boy to Principal 
Sweeney (Avery Brooks), who assigns the kid a new project. He must write 
a paper, to be titled "American History X," that documents the 
circumstances that led his brother to prison. Danny returns home for a 
festive neo-Nazi reunion with his brother, only to learn that Derek had a 
major change of heart in prison. He now rejects his former beliefs and 
wants his brother to do the same. But is it too late? </P>
<P>Danny's work on his paper provides the framework for the story, as 
flashbacks introduce the Vinyard's extended family and the environment 
from which the hatred grew. Director Tony Kaye (who unsuccessfully tried 
to have his name removed from the film over an editing dispute) presents 
a series of exceptionally vivid vignettes. We witness a confrontation 
between blacks and whites on a basketball court, various family fights, 
meetings between Derek and the manipulator behind the skinhead group 
(Stacy Keach), a horrific gang attack on a Korean grocery, and, of course,
 Derek's fatal assault on some black petty thieves. </P>
<P>One of the most disturbing scenes shows the boy's father, a weary 
firefighter, in a dinner-table speech that begins with his complaints 
about affirmative action and escalates into a racist diatribe. What makes 
the monologue so disquieting is its familiarity. Anyone who listens to 
conservative talk radio has heard the early portions of the father's 
argument. It's frightening to see how easily it turns from a hard-working 
family man's expression of frustration and perceived injustice into 
something very dangerous. The scene is a powerful reminder that people 
don't magically become monsters. It's a slower, much more insidious 
process that happens in all too many American homes.</P>
<P>"American History X" is a flawed work. Aside from Norton and Furlong, 
most of the other characters are little more than rough sketches. Derek's 
conversion from neo-Nazi back to human is sufficiently explained, but 
still seems a bit too abrupt. And some of Kaye's camera tricks, 
particularly the many shots of water in slow motion, are overly-mannered 
and distracting.</P>
<P>Still, the film packs a hell of a punch. If you want to see a powerful 
movie that depicts skinheads without a hint of romanticism, rent the 
devastating "Romper Stomper." But if you're willing to submit to a movie 
that goes a step further, not only condemning bigotry and violence but 
also challenging contemporary filmgoers, like us, who embrace cinematic 
depictions of violence and hate, give "American History X" a chance. You 
won't feel comfortable when you leave the theater, but you'll have a lot 
to think about.</P>
