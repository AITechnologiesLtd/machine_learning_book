<P>   Back in 1890 the famous historian Frederic Jackson Turner
declared that the American frontier was closed.  Manifest
Destiny had made its mark, the country had been fully
explored, and presumably only the moon was left to survey. 
Turner should have seen "Limbo," yet another of writer-
director-editor-novelist John Sayles's looks at contemporary
American culture.  Situating his story wholly in Alaska, Sayles
wants to tell us that Seward's Ice Box is at once an
overdeveloped, over-touristed theme park and a yet-to-be-
charted piece of majestic land despite its encounters with
hordes of summer tourists who mostly visit by ocean cruiser</P>
<P>   He tells two stories in one, essentially. The first part
includes a satirical view of a developer who wants to turn the
entire state into a theme park with perfectly safe adventures
for septuagenarian tourists from all over the mainland.  The
balance is a Robinson Crusoe-like melodrama of people
stranded on a hopelessly unexplored and untraveled northern
island to the north of Juneau.  The audience will plausibly be
divided into two parts as well: one with the patience to scan a
slow-moving narrative with just a modicum of suspense but
with an enormously satisfying examination of character; the
other, the sorts who will take in the scenery in much the say
they'd read a novel by James Michener but who, in the final
analysis, might say, "So what?"  Count me in as part of the
former bunch.</P>
<P>   You will need to give the film an hour or so of Robert
Altman-style vignettes to understand its title.  You'll see that
Sayles is dealing not only with the physical limbo
of people marooned on a isolated island but with the
emotional purgatory of individuals who are psychologically
trapped by guilt, introversion, loneliness and bitter memories. 
With excellent rendering of his female characters, Sayles
hones in on two unhappy women: Donna De Angelo, (Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio), a forty-ish lounge singer with a
history of marital failure; and her alienated teen-age daughter
Noelle (Vanessa Martinez), a pretty young woman with a
creative mind and complex suicidal tendencies.  While the
unhappy chanteuse seems ready to give up on men,
she is immediately attracted to the brooding loner, Joe
Gastineau (David Strathairn), once an all-American high-
school basketball star whose knee injury disrupted his chance
at a college education, leading him into a career as a
fisherman--which was cut short by his responsibility for two
deaths in a boating disaster.  When Joe's half-brother Bobby
Gastineau (Casey Siernazsko) turns up surprisingly to ask
a favor, Joe, his new girl friend Donna, and Donna's daughter
Noelle are led into the adventure of their lives, once which
wholly belies the cocoon-like safety enjoyed by the elderly
retirees stomping through the historic town of Port Henry.</P>
<P>   If the story lacks the tension which a mainstream audience
has the right to expect of a traditional tale of drug smuggling
and survivalist travel, Sayles probably means his account to
be just that.  With his background (a psychology degree from
Williams College), the director has made quite a name for his
exploration of the contemporary American scene with this
country's diverse population of often disparate fancies.  His
"Lianna," a study of a lesbian affair, is reflected in his current
tale, which includes a business proposition that two gay
women have with a disgruntled boat-owner, Harmon King
(Leo Burmester). His "Brother from Another Planet" proved
that Sayles could develop a character from outer space in a
way that no sci-fi writer had quite attempted before.  If
"Matewan" concerned a West Virginia miners' strike in the
1920's, then "Limbo" would follow up by giving credence to
the grievances of workers in a salmon packing plant. 
Throughout his career, Sayles has shown an ability to handle
many characters within each story.  "Limbo" is Sayles's
territory.</P>
<P>   David Strathairn has come back from his miscasting in "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" (where he seemed more like a
bond trader than a duke) to deliver a delightfully under-acted
portrayal of an loner getting by on odd jobs and treating a
new romantic attachment with all the passion of a kindly
grandfather.  And did you know that Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio--who was underwhelming as the colorless wife
of a wealthy Scotsman in Hugh Hudson's "My Life So Far"--
could sing like Judy Collins?  With Vanessa Martinez as the
cranky third wheel of this modern Swiss Family Robinson,
"Limbo" moves at a deliberate pace toward its wonderful,
open-ended conclusion--a Lady-or-the-Tiger resolution that
might well frustrate a mainstream audience but which will
encourage the more imaginative and sophisticated viewer. 
While the few shots of the Alaskan inlets surrounding Juneau
could encourage interest in travel by a movie audience of
popcorn-crunching couch potatoes, photographer Haskell
Wexler never quite gets the opportunity to do much for the
business of the Alaskan Tourist Board.  We'd like to hiss the
full-of-himself developer who'd not mind turning the interior of
the state into a parking lot, but we never do get to see
enough of America's largest state to justify that judgment. 
But we sure get a feel for characters--for their survival skills,
their idiosyncrasies, their hopes and dreams.  If that's what
you look forward to in your movies, you're in for a treat with
this "Limbo."</P>
