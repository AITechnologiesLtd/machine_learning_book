<PRE>                           AS GOOD AS IT GETS
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Writer and director James L. Brooks, who has blessed us with
several wonderful films including TERMS OF ENDEARMENT and one of my all
time favorite movies, BROADCAST NEWS, gives the world a present this
Christmas called AS GOOD AS IT GETS.  Few movies live up to their
title, but this romantic comedy is indeed just about as good as it
gets.</P>
<P>     In the story Melvin Udall suffers from an obsessive-compulsive
disorder.  He will not walk on lines in the sidewalk, which makes
strolling down busy Manhattan sidewalks pretty tricky.  Walking on
tiled floors is almost impossible, too hard to avoid the cracks.  When
he enters his apartment he locks the door five times and then goes to
wash his hands.  With a medicine cabinet full of soaps he opens two
fresh ones, washes his hands in near-boiling water and discards the
soaps afterward.</P>
<P>     And if you think that this behavior is bizarre, wait until you see
how he treats his fellow human beings.  Jack Nicholson, in a perfect
bit of casting, plays Melvin with his foul mouth and his overscrubbed
body.</P>
<P>     Melvin, a highly successful romance novelist, lives to insult
people and with his own bit of equal opportunity he manages to be
obnoxious to everyone with the same fervor.  Fawning over him, the
receptionist at his publishers asks him, "How do you write women so
well?"  With a sneer he retorts, "I think of men, and I take away
reason and accountability."</P>
<P>     Nicholson's performance would remain just a fascinating side-show
were it not for the casting of Helen Hunt as Carol Connelly, the only
waitress in New York who can tolerate Melvin's behavior.  Her reactions
to his outlandish conduct and her ability to stand up to him are
precious.  "Do you have any control over how creepy you can get?" she
asks him.</P>
<P>     Reportedly Holly Hunter was to have Hunt's role but could not
agree on an acceptable salary.  As much as I admire Hunter's talents,
the other HH actress seems much better suited to the role of a
struggling waitress.  Never did I think of Hunt as an actress.  She
became a blue collar worker with a son with chronic, life-threatening
asthma and with a live-in mother all ensconced in a tiny apartment.</P>
<P>     To round out the picture Greg Kinnear plays Melvin's next-door
neighbor, Simon Bishop, a gay artist who gets down on his luck.  And in
a funny little part Cuba Gooding Jr. is Simon's friend Frank Sachs, an
antiques dealer, who tries to out macho Melvin but hates having to do
it.</P>
<P>     As I've suggested before, the difference between a good film and a
great one lies in how well it handles the small details.  Consider one
believable and riotously funny sequence.  Carol has trouble finding
boyfriends, what with her busy schedule, her tiny shared apartment and
her sick son.  When she finally gets a man up to her place, her son's
illness interrupts their first caress.  Upon returning to her date, his
crude fondling attempt ends in a squeal as he notices that she has a
little vomit left on her blouse.  He beats a fast exit as she realizes
that the complexities of being a poor, single mother has done her love
life in again.  Throughout this scene her mother carefully wears her
headphones so that she can afford Carol some privacy.</P>
<P>     Another measure of an outstanding film is whether it can break
certain motion picture axioms and get away with it.  One certainly is
that comedies, and most movies for that matter, should come in under
two hours.  Although this one is over two and a quarter hours long,
there simply is nothing to cut.  I loved all of the characters and
would have been happy to see the movie last another hour.  Even the dog
(a Brussels Griffon who is the spitting image of Gismo from GREMLINS)
sets a new standard for cinematic canine cuteness.  (Brooks toyed with
the idea of calling the movie, A DOG'S STORY.)</P>
<P>     If there is any justice in Hollywood then Nicholson, Hunt and
Kinnear will all get Academy Award acting nominations as well as Brooks
and his co-writer Mark Andrus for the intelligent script and Brooks for
the dead-on directing.</P>
<P>     That Melvin and Carol, who could not be more dissimilar, will fall
in love is obvious from the movie's setup, but that doesn't make
watching it anything less than enthralling.  In one of the movie's best
scenes, Carol forces a showdown.  Either Melvin gives her a compliment,
or she walks.  "You make me want to be a better man," he tells her
while straining every muscle in his face.  After a long pause, in which
you have no idea how she will react to his strange reply, she reflects,
"That's maybe the best compliment of my life."</P>
<P>     AS GOOD AS IT GETS runs 2:18.  It is rated PG-13 for strong
language, mature themes, brief nudity and a beating and would be fine
for kids around eleven and up.</P>
