<P>GHOST DOG - THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI (1999)</P>
<P>Director: Jim Jarmusch
With: Forest Whitaker, John Tormey, Tricia Vessey, Isaach De Bankolé.</P>
<P>In a shack on a rooftop in a nameless big city, together with a flock of
pigeons, lives Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker). He spends his time meditating,
practicing Japanese martial arts, and reading a book called "The Way of the
Samurai." His life is completely removed from other people and the rest of
the world that he is living in. His best friend is a French
icecream-seller, Raymond (Isaach De Bankolé) who doesn't speak a word of
English. And no, Ghost Dog does not speak French. He lives by the codes of
the samurai, as described in the book. He never goes anywhere without his
black briefcase. What is in the briefcase, only he himself knows. Guns,
knives, burglay equipment. The tools of his trade, because Ghost Dog is a
hitman for the mafia.</P>
<P>He doesn't see it that way himself though. When he was young, mafioso Louie
(John Tormey) one day saved his life when he was being beaten up by a gang.
Several years later, Ghost Dog seeks out Louie, and offers him his services
as his "retainer". Ghost Dog sees the relationship between the two as one
between a samurai and his master, and he has no dealings with anyone else
in the mafia. Louie is bemused by the arrangement, but accepts it. Then one
day, something goes wrong. Ghost Dog leaves a witness to one of his
assassinations, and the witness is the mafia boss' daughter (Tricia
Vessey). To save face, the mafia set out to kill Ghost Dog. He, in turn,
sets out to kill them.</P>
<P>Seeing as the director's name is Jim Jarmusch, it will hardly come as a
surprise that the movie does not develop into a fast and furious
action-adventure. Rather, it is a study of people trying to live in a world
that is not the world around them. Ghost Dog behaves as if he lives in
ancient Japan. He commits his killings without emotion or feelings of
guilt, he is a samurai, and must serve his master. The mafiosi on the other
hand, are also portrayed as relics of the past. They are a bunch of tired
old men, confused by the changing society around them, nagged on by the
landlord for not paying the rent, while trying to live according to a code
of their own. Thus they and the mafia develop a sort of respect for each
other: "You know one good thing about this Ghost Dog? He is going after us
in the old way," says one of the mafiosi.</P>
<P>It is not a straightforward movie, and not something that should be chosen
for a relaxing evening's entertainment. The film has deeper levels which
every viewer will have to try and work out for himself. It is however
entertaining, at times funny, and with some good action-scenes as well, and
Forest Whitaker does a good job as Ghost Dog. </P>
<P>Who should see this film: People who have seen too many Hollywood films
lately, and is looking for something refreshingly different - fans of
mafia-movies in particular.</P>
<PRE>My verdict: 4+ (out of 6)</PRE>
