<P>"Simpatico" doesn't involve us in its story, so much as it blackmails us into 
it. Yes, I kept wondering what was going to happen next, but not because I 
cared -- I simply wanted to make sense of it all. The film's method is to 
throw a lot of bewildering information at us, and keep us watching by 
promising it'll all be sorted out by the end.</P>
<P>The main characters are Carter (Jeff Bridges), a successful businessman whose 
acres of property include a sleek country mansion, and Vinnie (Nick Nolte), 
an angry slob whose rotting bungalow lies in the middle of sandy nowhere. As 
the movie opens, Carter is getting ready to sell his family's prized 
racehorse, but is interrupted from the deal by a phone call from Vinnie, who 
orders him to come cross-country to see him. Carter immediately hops on a 
plane.</P>
<P>With the possible exception of Hugh Grant, millionaires don't often abandon 
their busy schedules to visit shady bums, so what strange hold does Vinnie 
have on Carter? After a lot of unspecific talk about 'the past", we learn 
that years ago the two men were involved together in gambling and bribery 
scams, and Vinnie has always held onto proof of these illegal actions that 
could destroy Carter's credibility in legitimate circles. Since Vinnie is 
more than a little unstable, Carter does not want to upset him, and appeases 
his old friend as much as he can. We get the sense that this arrangement has 
been going for quite some time -- Vinny making threats, Carter giving him 
things to keep him quiet.</P>
<P>Things may not, however, be so simple this time. Vinny is really starting to 
act like he'll do something with his evidence; perhaps he'll expose Carter, 
perhaps just re-open old wounds for the man's wife Rosie (Sharon Stone), 
whose part in her husband's extortion rackets left her permanently 
emotionally scarred.</P>
<P>Right there is, more or less, the whole story of "Simpatico", which unfolds 
in an odd manner: Characters pop up onscreen now and again talking about 
secretive things the audience don't know anything about. Flashbacks appear, 
to explain tiny pieces of the puzzle. Then come moments of quiet reflection.</P>
<P>While this deliberately perplexing method of storytelling must have seemed 
like a hot idea to the filmmakers, because it lets them stretch their meagre 
plot out to feature length, it leaves the audience at a loss to understand 
whether or not the actors' performances are any good. We're never let know 
what the motivations of the characters are, let alone whether these 
motivations are being played convincingly. Nolte and Bridges do a lot of 
grunting and shouting; Stone appears far too late in the film for her 
passionate anger to redeem the dullness of the script. Albert Finney, playing 
a man Vinnie and Carter ruined, does a lot of weird babbling in a typically 
terrible American accent; Catherine Keener, as a checkout girl who never 
wanted to be involved with a bunch of crooks, switches between tough cookie 
and gullible simpleton, often within the same scene. Maybe all this made 
sense in the Sam Shepard stage play upon which "Simpatico" is based. It 
doesn't in the movie.</P>
<P>This would have been a fascinating piece of work if the plot had been 
outlined in the opening twenty minutes, and the rest of the script had 
focused on the characters. Who are these people? Who were they? How do they 
feel about each other? How did the consequences of their swindles 
specifically affect them? "Simpatico" ignores all these potentially 
interesting avenues, trying to work on the level of its mystery alone -- 
mystery that isn't mysterious, just confusing.</P>
