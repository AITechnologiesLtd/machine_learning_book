<P>A new courtroom thriller starring John Travolta that _isn't_ written by John
Grisham? There's a miracle everyday in Hollywood. This interesting vehicle
adapted from the true story novelised by Jonathan Harr is an straight
forward telling of the lawfirm Schlichtmann (Travolta) Crowley and Conway
(Zeljko Ivanek and Tony Shalhoub) and their involvement in a case against
contaminated water. However, this case proves to be hugely expensive for
them, and they are drawn into a battle of money and wits against defendant
lawyer Jerome Facher (Duvall.)</P>
<P>Adapted by Schindlers List writer Zaillian, A Civil Action is a better
courtroom drama than most because much of the movie is set outside the
courtroom. In a nice sequence, the film introduces us immediately to
Travolta's character and train of though, although the other members of the
law firms seem to be compromised in the character developed area. Although
Travolta's character is delved into greatly, Conway, Crowley and accountant
James Gordon (Macy) are rather faceless, although played with sterling
effort by the cast. William H. Macy is particularly good as the edgy
accountant who grows more crazy as the firm goes deeper into debt. Shalhoub,
after an excellent performance in The Siege is good here, but plays a minor
role in the big scheme of things. Ivanek, sadly, doesn't get much of a
chance to make an impression on the audience. Robert Duvall is good as the
world weary Facher, but it's far too simple a role for him and lacks any
real depth. He's fun, but he's not very deep. Quinlan appears in and out of
the movie as the leader of the group of parents who are fighting the
pollutants of the water (their children died of leukaemia,) and her
performance is merely average. John Lithgow and Dan Hedaya, however, are
both fun in incredibly minor roles.</P>
<P>Travolta himself has shown he can save nearly any movie, even crap like
Phenomenon (but not Michael.) He obviously enjoys working with Duvall again
(and vice versa) and it's their scenes together that are the highlights of
the movie. Travolta is more than able enough to carry the movie, and his is
the only character that's fleshed out with any depth. But the movie never
comes to an great conclusion about him, and the end of the movie may leave
you annoyed by the fact that the film can't seem to wrap up a potentially
interesting character. Perhaps placing the words 'Based on a true story' at
the start of the movie was the filmmakers way of wimping out: they must have
thought the audiences would of loved these characters because their are real
people. But it doesn't work, and having faceless characters makes the film
flat and sometimes boring.</P>
<P>Apart from the characters, however, the film in other respects is fine. The
direction is impressive and pacy enough, although their are some truly odd
camera angles chucked in for no apparent reason. Both the drama and the
minor action scenes are handled well enough. There's some suitably 'JFK'
type music running throughout, written by Danny Elfman, who I still feel is
more comfortable when writing music for darker films. The pacing is fine,
although it occasionally drags, and the ending is to abrupt.</P>
<P>Although flawed, A Civil Action does contain enough suspense and tension to
keep audiences pleased. Although it doesn't try anything new, A Civil Action
is solid entertainment, and is probably worth watching if you want a quick
fix of courtroom drama. It's just a shame that a potentially interesting
movie is nothing more than average.</P>
