<PRE>                                     SAFE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     I first heard of SAFE a good twelve months ago and was instantly
intrigued by the film, a story about a woman who becomes sick for no
medically detectable reason.  Upon seeing the movie, we discover one
possibility for her disorder:  she is "allergic to the 20th century."
Twentieth Century Disease (also known as Multiple Chemical Sensitivity)
is a very frightening, very real disability with no cure.  The disorder
is brought about by some 60,000 chemicals present in our environment,
many of which have devastating effects on MCS sufferers, even present
in tiny amounts.</P>
<P>     SAFE tells the tale of Carol White (Julianne Moore), an otherwise
healthy, high-society homemaker who gradually comes down with a number
of inexplicable symptoms.  It begins with headaches and a rash, and
soon spirals until she develops dizziness, nausea, and has a seizure.
And things continue to get worse.  All the while, none of her doctors
can explain a thing.  Eventually, Carol discovers the reality of MCS
and heads for the Wrenwood Colony, a "safe" zone which is free of
pollutants.  Here, she begins her inward search to find the true reason
for her illness.</P>
<P>     Director and writer Todd Haynes does a great job of leaving the
cause of Carol's disorder open for debate.  Is it just a latent
allergy?  Or is it psychosomatic?  The question is never answered, just
as, in Carol's life, it never will be.  "It's just for a short time,"
she says of her stay at Wrenwood.  We can feel her pain as it becomes
evident that the opposite is most certainly the case.  We even feel
sorry for her estranged husband, who can't understand Carol's malady.</P>
<P>     Regular readers of mine will know by now that Julianne Moore is
hands-down my favorite actress on the planet, and SAFE marks the best
role of her career.  Moore easily deserves an Oscar nod, if not the
statue, and Haynes deserves recognition for his very, very cool
direction.</P>
<P>     While sections of the film are weak in comparison to the picture's
truly stunning scenes, supporting cast are only fair, and the ending is
unsatisfying, SAFE still remains one of the most powerful pictures of
the year.  It should not be missed.</P>
