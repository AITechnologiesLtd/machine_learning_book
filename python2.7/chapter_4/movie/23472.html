<P>Delicious is the word for this labor of love and love for the 
theater. Delicious like a long,  leisurely gourmet meal of "haute 
cuisine" which lasts for hours, has an unhurried pace, makes time 
pass most pleasurably, brings in course after course, and progresses 
with interesting conversations.</P>
<P>Writer-director Mike Leigh has carved a special film-niche for 
himself with very British movies that reveal extraordinary things 
about ordinary working-class people: High Hopes, Life Is Sweet, 
Naked, Secrets and Lies, et al. He (and his actors) have been awarded 
a host of major prizes. And that's not counting Leigh's activities in 
the theater, and with TV films which also get theatrical releases.</P>
<P>In Topsy-Turvy Leigh deals with the team of  librettist W.S. Gilbert 
(1836-1911) and composer Arthur Sullivan (1842-1900) or Sir Arthur 
after he was knighted in 1883. There's also a third man, 
impresario-manager D'Oyly Carte (1844-1901).</P>
<P>Even though one my cats is called Yum-Yum, I  am no G & S aficionado. 
Yet I appreciate how distinctive and novel their works were and how 
they brought out another side of staid Victorianism.</P>
<P>Compared to the familiar hoi polloi characters in the other Leigh 
movies, the "showbiz" people of Topsy-Turvy are downright patrician. 
They appear not in the old genre of artists' biopic but within a 
limited time-frame which allows depth and details.</P>
<P>It begins in 1884, when the latest G & S production, Princess Ida, 
was not well received. By G & S standards, it's a flop. The team's 
first collaboration, Trial by Jury, had been followed by several 
hits: The Sorcerer, H.M.S. Pinafore,  The Pirates of Penzance, 
Patience , and  Iolanthe. Princess Ida may have not deserved its 
unsuccess, but certainly Ida is no Aida. Not that one can compare 
hefty Grand Operas and their Bel Canto to the comic operettas that G 
& S invented.</P>
<P>Sir Arthur, bedridden with painful kidney trouble, still finds the 
strength to get to the Savoy Theater and conduct the orchestra. (His 
expressive face as he mouths the score is a marvel). But he also 
suffers from the musical ambition to compose, as he had in his early 
career, serious music. Princess Ida is the last straw. " I can't 
waste any more time on these trivial soufflés" he tells Carte.</P>
<P>Sir Arthur takes a break by going to the Continent. He is a bon 
vivant whose appreciation of French food and, in a Paris bordello, of 
a topless singing duo of ladies, bring out his "joie de vivre" and 
wit. It's charming.. But by the time Gilbert reads him his latest 
libretto, Sullivan has had it with topsy-turvy, formulaic plots.</P>
<P>The film's 160 minutes never drag or fatigue. And I say this as the 
founder of the BBNMM movement -- Bring Back the Ninety Minute Movie. 
We are treated  (and it is a treat) to wonderfully calibrated 
Victoriana:  interiors, artifacts, people; character and 
personality-revealing talk;  thoughts on creativity and art; the 
business side of productions; insights into private lives. Every 
minute brings something of interest, and many skillfully brief 
moments stand for full situations.</P>
<P>Topsy-Turvy revels in contrasts especially between lively 
man-about-town Sullivan and. serious, often dour Gilbert. The choice 
of words and images has the effortless feeling that comes from 
intelligent preparations. "Echt" British humor and educated wit are 
both a contrast to and a supplement of the funny singing patter of 
the G & S productions.</P>
<P>The partners are on the verge of breaking up permanently when smart 
Mrs. Gilbert (who like all the supporting  characters is painted with 
forceful economy) drags her husband to a novelty, an Exposition of 
Japanese culture. Kabuki, dances, music and other Japanese exotica 
suddenly set Gilbert on his operetta road to Damascus. Thus is The 
Mikado born in 1885.</P>
<P>All this is dealt with a succession of cleverly edited scenes. 
Gilbert, who has bought a Japanese sword, plays with it.  Cut to G & 
S together again,  reading a new script. Cut to February 12, 1885, 
when dire, Empire-shaking news reaches England: General "Chinese" 
Gordon and his men in besieged Khartoum were massacred on January 26 
by the Mahdi's rebel Sudanese. Cut to performers-to-be in The Mikado 
gorging themselves with oysters --and soon becoming sick. Life does 
go on.</P>
<P>The acting, from tiny to main roles, is flawless. Smart, telling, 
enjoyable moments, scenes or sequences abound. The funniest have 
Gilbert rehearsing his cast and thus becoming like a modern stage 
director. He has Japanese ladies show his performers how to stand, 
walk, and deploy fans. He instructs others on delivering lines. (Was 
Leigh  partly inspired by Truffaut's film-within-film mishaps in Day 
for Night?). It is high comedy, doubly impressive when one thinks of 
the movie's cast rehearsing how to handle The Mikado's rehearsals. 
Especially since Mike Leigh and his people,  in plays and movies, do 
not work in kosher ways. There are no standard scripts; everything 
derives  from interaction, invention and improvisation. Assuming that 
process was also used in Topsy-Turvy, the approach results in 
wonderful smoothness and dovetailing.</P>
<P>There is even suspense .Gilbert cuts out the song of a performer (who 
recalls Robert Morley). Will he reinstate it?  Will the  key actor 
who shoots  drugs, the actress wih a bad leg, or the actress who 
drinks, affect the performance?</P>
<P>One gets here many films for the price of one. G & S's life and 
works; how "An Operetta Is Born"; authentic shoptalk; backstage life 
of total verisimilitude --the best I know of-- and more. Technical 
aspects are brilliant. But the press seems to neglect the 
contribution of a major collaborator. Composer Carl Davis, born in 
Brooklyn but a longtime resident in England, though well-known in 
inner circles is not a name familiar to the public. Yet his output is 
huge and magnificent. Davis's scores include theatrical films (he won 
the British music award for The French Lieutenant's Woman);  many TV 
films (Channel 4, BBC, etc.) that have often been released as 
"regular" movies or appeared on PBS; TV series from the UK; 
documentary series such as The World at War, The Unknown Chaplin, 
Cinema Europe: The Other Hollywood. His new scores for silent 
classics (Intolerance, Ben-Hur, The Eagle, Greed, etc.) are the best 
ever. Prodigious Davis is the top film composer of our day, yet no 
one of my acquaintance knows him, except for maestro-pianist Ian 
Hobson who has recorded with him in England and admires him.</P>
<P>A final thought. Other operettas, e.g. by Vienna's Johann Strauss, by 
the Hungarian-born Franz Lehar, or by France's Offenbach, have 
traveled very well. But the untranslatable texts of W.S. Gilbert have 
limited the G & S repertory to English-speaking countries. 
Topsy-Turvy, in spite of getting two New York Film Critics Award 
(Best Film, Best Director) may also meet with this fate.</P>
