<P>     Several months ago, upon hearing that David Guterson's much-respected
novel _Snow Falling on Cedars_ was being turned into a film, I made my
usual effort to familiarize myself with the source material. After
approximately 90 pages, I did something I almost never do: I surrendered. 
The grinding pacing of the story -- which, at the point I lost interest,
had consisted almost entirely of a court proceeding -- did absolutely
nothing to motivate persistence. Whatever intriguing themes might have
been contained in Guterson's tale would never be known to me thanks to a
narrative decision I considered crippling: waiting far too long to get to
the point.</P>
<P>     This background is offered to make it clear that my ambivalence
towards Scott Hicks' SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS has nothing to do with
affection for the source material. It also sets up the problem with the
film, which is the same problem I had with the novel. The story begins in
1950, in a fishing village on an island off the coast of Washington state.
A murder trial is beginning, in which Japanese-American fisherman Kazuo
Miyamoto (Rick Yune) is accused of killing another fisherman with whom
there was a history of family dispute. Reporter Ishmael Chambers (Ethan
Hawke) is covering the trial, but his interest is more than merely
journalistic. In flashback, we learn of Ishmael's youthful romance with
Hatsue (Youki Kudo), who will become Kazuo's wife. Their love affair is
thrown into turmoil, by the "relocation" of Japanese-Americans during
World War II, an act of discrimination the implications of which carry
into Kazuo's trial.</P>
<P>     It's not the first time the screen has seen a story of lovers
separated by the Japanese-American internment camps (Alan Parker fumbled
the similarly-themed COME SEE THE PARADISE), but that doesn't mean it's
not an important story to tell. In fact, SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS has an
angle on the often-didactic issue of racism that makes it potentially
compelling. Ishmael faces a moral choice when he discovers information
that could exonerate Kazuo, a choice complicated by his own feelings of
hatred. Those feelings, however, are not some easily dismissable bigotry.
Instead, they're a churning mixture of Ishmael's tangled feelings about
his father (Sam Shepard), a controversial liberal publisher; about the
loss of an arm in the war; and about his lingering obsession/revulsion
towards Hatsue. While the prosecutor in Kazuo's case (James Rebhorn) 
engages in none-too-subtle race-baiting, Ishmael's own brand of less overt 
racism makes it harder to watch with smug superiority.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, by the time it's clear how Hicks and co-screenwriter
Ron Bass are trying to personalize the murky matter of racism, the film is
almost over. That leaves a film with two glaring flaws. The first is Ethan
Hawke's performance as Ishmael, which is so blank that the role might just
as easily have been played by a cardboard cutout. Hicks does a nice job
with Ishmael and Hatsue's secretive adolescent trysts inside a hollow
tree, but he doesn't do much to help us understand Ishmael's longing. 
Hawke plays most of his scenes with a thousand-yard stare we're expected
to interpret as a combination of introspection and repressed emotion,
while it could just as easily be interpreted as trying to remember where
he left his car keys. By the time Hicks tries to crank up the drama by
cranking up James Newton Howard's score during a wildly overwrought
sequence involving Hatsue's "Dear John" letter, it's too late to give the
relationship the sense of consequence it demands.</P>
<P>     The second problem is the directorial self-indulgence exemplified by
that "Dear John" sequence, which shows up at every possible wrong time. 
There are quiet moments in SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS when the mournfully
personal manages to escape -- Kazuo and Hatsue sharing a wedding night in
the internment camp separated from her family only by a curtain, or the
always-segregated school bus suddenly missing its Japanese-American
passengers. Too often, however, Hicks either ladles on the symbolism
(Hatsue in a convoy to the internment camps reminiscent of her parade as
the town's "Strawberry Princess") or lets speeches tell his story (fixing
on a close-up of Max von Sydow as Kazuo's defense attorney, summing up for
the jury how "humanity itself is on trial"). There's too much film-making
business going on for too long, and too little of the human story that
should intensify the historical story. I didn't surrender on the film
version of SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS. I merely walked out unsatisfied,
wondering why the story, like bad journalism, had to bury the lead.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 snow dazes:  5.</PRE>
