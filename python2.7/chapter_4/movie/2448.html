<PRE>One-Line-Summary
----------------
    A tabloid news reporter has a hell of a day. </PRE>
<P>Tak Plot Summary
----------------
     Henry Hackett (Michael Keaton), editor of a big-city newspaper
tabloid, is hot on a big story that could expose a major scandal and
free two innocent young men charged with murder--if he can meet his
deadline for the morning edition.  With his wife (Marisa Tomei) about
to give birth, his managing editor (Glenn Close) locking horns with him
and a rival newspaper trying to lure him over, Hackett is facing more
than one crisis in this everyday adventure: this day is going to change
his life forever.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts 
------------
     If you think *you* lead a stressful life, maybe seeing THE PAPER
will change your mind.  The running time of THE PAPER depicts more
stress than I've been subjected to in months, and it's all supposed to
happen over a period of twenty-four hours.  Yeesh.</P>
<P>     In this time span, we follow a heap of different plot lines, all
intertwined with Hackett's pursuit of a big expose that could free two
innocents.  He's also interviewing for another job and reassuring his
distraught wife.  The harried editor is worried about his medical
condition and trying to reunite with his estranged daughter.  A host of
reporters are out on the street doing research, most with their own
problems, including hiding from an angry city official.  To top it all
off, Glenn Close's character actively tries to stymie Hackett's story,
while simultaneously schmoozing to re-negotiate her own contract.</P>
<P>     There's *so* much going on in this movie, you can't help but be
overwhelmed.  Especially in the newsroom.  In one scene, Hackett is
juggling three people on hold and conducting an argument in his
office.  It's common to have many conversations going on at once (I
counted five in one scene), and there's always something happening in
the background if you have time to look. (Watch for five clocks)</P>
<P>     The characters in THE PAPER were great.  Glenn Close's has
unintentionally turned into everything she previously hated ("You're a
manager now, if everyone liked you, you'd be doing something wrong.").
Robert Duvall is the gruff editor in chief ("The trouble with being my
age is that everyone looks up to you as a father figure, but you know
that you're still the same old asshole.").  Marisa Tomei is Hatckett's
wife, an apprehensive career reporter who's envious that her husband
can still pursue his career ("Hypothetical situation: If a gunman said
he was going to shoot me or blow up the [office], which would you
choose?").  Then add more newsroom characters--the kid photographer,
the whiny complainer, the conspiracy nut, and varied screwballs.</P>
<P>     And did I mention that it's funny too?  There are one-liners,
hilarious arguments, amusing situations and funny events throughout.</P>
<P>     The trick to enjoying this highly charged, funny and complex movie
is staying detached and *watching* all the excitement.  If I'm not
careful, I get too involved in a movie--if it's even halfway decent, I
feel right along with a character.  Which is great if I'm watching
feel-good stuff.  Depending on your personality, watching THE PAPER
might get you a) stressed out, b) pumped, c) excited and/or d) amused.
Unfortunately for my date, I mostly got stressed out.</P>
<P>Tak Rating:
-----------
     I liked THE PAPER--it's exciting, funny, stressful and dramatic.
I'll gladly accompany my friends to see it again.  There's bound to be
more to catch the second time.  And I'll certainly never see my daily
newspaper in quite the same way after THE PAPER.</P>
<PRE>   avoid at all costs            see several times (w/friends) as matinee
   wait for videotape            see once at full price
   watch it on cable          X see it several times - full and/or matinee
   see once as a matinee    see many times at full price
