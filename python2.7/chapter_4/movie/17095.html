<PRE>Office Space
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) As uneven and unfocused as OFFICE SPACE is, it hits
home with enough jokes to make it an enjoyable comedy.</P>
<P>You'd think a movie about life in a cubicle would necessarily resemble
Dilbert. But OFFICE SPACE gives itself some distance from the outlandish
comic strip by having more humanly interesting characters and being much
more insightful. Instead of going for the broad, exaggerated gags (well,
it goes for them too), it goes for the more mundane, subtle comedy and
irony of being a Gen-X drone.</P>
<P>For example, Peter (Ron Livingston) begins every day with an unavoidable
static electric shock as he opens the door to the Initech offices. All
the professionals drive plain, silver Toyotas and live in apartments
that look like they're furnished by Target. As naïve and whitebread as
they are, they still listen to gangsta rap. Their detached, monotonous,
mockable boss decorates his office with "Cathy" cartoons.  </P>
<P>Then again, some of the gags are just too obvious to be funny, like the
elderly man outrunning the flow of the traffic jam, or the
squeaky-pitched receptionist incessantly answering the phone across from
Peter, or Michael's (David Herman) heated, personal feud with his
printer.</P>
<P>The movie seems like a string of these skits, corralled together by
their common office setting. (Jennifer Aniston is introduced as a love
interest, which allows the movie to run a few gags at the
"Bennigans"-style restaurant where she works.) But eventually, one idea
starts to take shape as the movie's main plot: Peter stops caring about
work after a hypnotherapist fails to take him out of a trance.
Ironically, his new attitude boosts him up the corporate ladder, even as
his hard-working friends are being laid off.</P>
<P>Peter has not forgotten his friends, though, and to show his solidarity
with them, he helps them come up with a scheme to embezzle money from
Initech.</P>
<P>If Mike Judge had more guts, or any respect for his "work sucks"
message, his protagonists would have stuck it to the man and gotten away
with it. They could have been downsized Davids putting one over on the
corporate Goliath. Wouldn't that be a glorious, triumphant message in
this age of corporations denigrating their employees and customers in
order to worship their shareholders?</P>
<P>But it quickly becomes clear that our heroes are too clean and meek to
make good criminals. They fit the sitcom-character mold that says they
have to end the episode where they started. You can deduce, even without
seeing it, that in order for our heroes to get out of the mess they
made, the movie will necessarily have a contrived, DEUS EX MACHINA
ending.</P>
<P>OFFICE SPACE has the look and feel of a low-budget student film, with
cheap sets, lots of gags, and a few unknown actors. Combined with the
moth-eaten, patchwork plot, a less funny movie could have been downright
bad. But luckily for Judge -- and for us -- OFFICE SPACE actually is
funny. Not always, but often enough.</P>
