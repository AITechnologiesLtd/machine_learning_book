<P>IN SHORT: You will laugh until it hurts. Or hurt until you laugh.</P>
<P>There is no question about it, David Arquette is one very starange dude.
he's strange when he does talk show. He's very strange in his 1-800
telephone ads. But he's off the charts as Gordie Biggs, son of and
brother of cops, who faces certain redneck cop doom in his hometown of
Lusk, Wyoming. He resists wearing the badge, instead driving a septic
tank with best buddy Sean Dawkins (Scott Caan) at his side.</P>
<P>Like lots of almost adults facing years of dreary hell in the only life
available to them, Gordie and Sean find a fantasy outlet to take away
the pain and make it all better. [actually, with twenty minutes or so of
jokes about Number Two, the pain was pretty much inflicted on these old
reviewers bones]. Not drugs. Not sex. Something far more important on
the vast scale of things cosmic. The eternal battle of good versus evil,
Order versus Chaos, Blood and Sweat versus Pernicious Evil brought about
by lying, cheating and distracting the referees. Yes, the merger of Ted
Turner and Time Warner has led us down the path to a movie starring
World Championship Wrestling, called Ready To Rumble, which surely is as
close a representation of Hell as anything Cranky has ever sat through .
.. .</P>
<P>Well, it felt that way for the first twenty minutes, in which we made
the observation that if Bill and Ted had the intelligence of Beavis and
Butt-head, they would be Sean and Gordy, who find the Meaning of Life in
their quest to restore the greatest WCW wrester of all, Jimmy King
(Oliver Platt) to his throne as heavyweight champion of the WCW. In
their way is Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano), evil mastermind of the
WCW, and every wrestling actor who ever dreamed of wearing the belt,
which means appearances by just about everyone you see on WCW Monday
Night Nitro. Except Hulk Hogan.</P>
<P>Ready to Rumble is no great film, but it is a bust a gut funny piece of
[deleted]. One that will go down in the anals of film comedy (its heroes
suck out port-a-potties) as a jaw dropper stinker that keeps coming back
at you, like a bad bit o' beef, until you have no choice but to roll
over and cackle, guffaw, chuckle, grimace, shudder, or, failing that,
apologize profusely to your date (or all of the above).</P>
<P>Yep, it's American Pie all over again. From director Brian Robbins (of
Varsity Blues, which I liked) and Steven Brill, the writer of
Heavyweights (Cranky's 6 year old nephew's favorite film of all time)
and Mighty Ducks One Two and Three comes a movie which bombards you with
joke after joke until you just can't stand it no more. Teenlets will eat
this stuff up from the word go. Old farts like Cranky were writhing in
pain Ready to Rumble then unleashes the greatest gag of all . . .
Martin Landau in the role of a retired wrestler whose skills and
attitude are such that he could turn Sid Vicious (whoever) into a whiny
little girly man.</P>
<P>OK that's it. Three taps and I give. Ready to Rumble is funny. Once it
gets past the dumb jokes and brings in the inevitable sex element, in
the persona of Nitro Girl Sasha (Rose McGowan), it gets even funnier.
Once you fall into the gaping maw of jokes it will chomp you up and spit
out an exhausted, laughed out mess.</P>
<P>Ready to Rumble is buffoonery stretched to the limit, culminating in a
three cage wrestling death match, in which the sound levels on the
special effects are pushed up to ear cracking levels. Professional
Wrestling may be "fake" but that doesn't stop these mammoth-men from
hurting each other, which happens in "real life" and in this flick and,
all the while, they keep cracking jokes.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Ready to Rumble, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$5.00</PRE>
<P>Yep, it's a dateflick (lighten up, it's just a movie). Best guide I can
give is that, if you're in to WCW or WWF right now, or have been and
remember flicks like Bill and Ted or or the Beavis and Butt-Head stuff
with affection, you'll probably piss yourself laughing at Ready To
Rumble</P>
