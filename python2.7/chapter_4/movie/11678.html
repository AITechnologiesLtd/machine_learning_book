A Likable "Mr. Nice Guy"
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>You can fault Jackie Chan films for having paper thin plots (it has
the complexity of a two-piece jigsaw puzzle).  You can fault him for
having one-dimensional bad guys (villains either wear sunglasses and
suits or look like snowboarding rejects).  You can fault him for
having a plethora of extraneous characters (there are always women
that need saving).  But it's hard not to like "Mr. Nice Guy."</P>
<P>Relentlessly animated and oozing with martial artistry, this movie
focuses on Jackie, a chef who just happens to be walking home one day
when he runs into an investigative reporter named Diana.  It seems
that people are chasing her because of a video that she just shot,
which would incriminate the local crime lord.  Being the chivalrous
guy that he is, he begins to chop and sock her pursuers.  At the end
of this entertaining chase/fight sequence, Jackie mistakenly and
unknowingly winds up with the video.  For the rest of the movie, the
bad guys are in hot pursuit of Jackie but our hero has no idea why.
At every turn, more bad guys come his way, and we are treated to a
variety of fight sequences that are artistically choreographed and
sometimes jaw-droppingly amazing.</P>
<P>Watch as he fends off bad guys in a moving horse and buggy traveling
out of control down a busy city street.  See how he skillfully employs
chairs, tables and garbage pails as his weapons.  Wince as he barely
escapes certain injury when he comes oh-so-close to a buzzsaw.  Be
amazed at his martial arts ability.  But you'll also laugh because
Chan's movies are kung-fu comedies that stress simplicity and fun.
These moviemakers don't want you to be absorbed with plot twists or
character development.  Rather, they create opportunities for Chan to
show his stuff.  And ample opportunities are created and Chan comes
through.</P>
<P>There are several things that pleased me about this Chan offering.  Up
to now, most of his releases had a very cheesy feel, especially
because of the dubbing.  Yet, while you may cock an eyebrow at the
insipidness of the bad guys, the story (filmed in English) seemed more
coherent and stayed focused on Jackie and his ability to take matters
into his own quick-as-lightning hands.  You won't be disappointed by
the amount of action in the film or the stuntwork performed by Chan.
His stunts are so wild that it's really hard to explain them in words.
You'll have to see it to believe it.</P>
<P>The best way to view Chan's offerings is not to think of them as
movies or Chan as an actor.  Consider "Mr. Nice Guy" as a show with
Chan as its lead performer.  Indeed, you'll be hard-pressed to find
entertainment like this anywhere else.</P>
