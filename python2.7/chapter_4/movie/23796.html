<PRE>"If it's secret and elite, it can't be good."
The Skulls</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Would you swear your allegiance to some stealth secret society seducing you
with insurmountable sums, slick sports cars, sexy slender sisters,
scholarships to study law at several esteemed schools essentially securing
your prospective professional success? Struggling to pay the bills at his
Ivy League University, city-kid Joshua Jackson sighs, "My future's killing
me," then succumbs to the seduction as the price to calm the side effects of
entry into the Skulls skyrockets.</P>
<P>A group of ten recruited college studs (only 2 of which matter) stumble in
the dark through a mysterious and spooky initiation process. The two: our
hero Joshua and the typecast teen jerk Paul Walker.</P>
<P>There's actually a very exciting long boat race earlier on. Meant to endear
us to the main character (which admittedly, it does), the race itself is
more climactic than the picture's climax. The film is still intriguing as we
(along with Josh) learn about this elite secret society membering members of
congress etc. Why the club is called "Skulls," is never revealed - probably
it just sounds cool. To celebrate the new groups "rebirth," dressed in
expensive duds and rubbing shoulders with senators and judges, the music
rolls over to rock, a flock of gorgeous babes slow-mo into the room, and the
young new talent leave the party in $50,000 sports car of their choice. It's
a very slick sequence.</P>
<P>Not too long after, however, the film takes a dive into "Starsky and
Hutchdom," with a TV 70's bad guy pursues good guy into a fenced in alley
staple, that detours into a car chase worthy of "Dukes of Hazard." Oh sure
that can be fun, but in a film that sets itself up as clever, darkly
sinister and proudly bares the name "Skulls?" It's hardly stately. The good
old fashion duel at then end doesn't vindicate it in the least, nor is it
unpredictable.</P>
<P>Joshua Jackson pulls down a strong performance as does Paul Walker, but the
uneven dialogue dips into the silly. Despite it's excellent cinematography,
"Skulls" fails to "flesh out" a good premise.</P>
