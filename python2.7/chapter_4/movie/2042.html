<P>     I have a housemate who works for a theater concessions company,
and periodically he can get us in free at the theaters where his
company does business.  "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" was showing at one
of these theaters.  I shelled out nothing more than an hour and forty
minutes of my life.</P>
<PRE>     I want it back.</PRE>
<P>     ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS is co-writer/director Mel Brooks' stab
at the swashbuckler genre, most specifically the 1991 Kevin Costner
vehicle ROBIN HOOD, PRINCE OF THIEVES.  Cary Elwes is Robin of Loxley,
who returns from the Crusades to find England in the grip of the
usurper Prince John (Richard Lewis) and his muscle the Sheriff of
Rottingham (Roger Rees).  The story, of Robin's attempts to free the
kingdom and to win Maid Marian, is a thin frame on which to hang a
collection of sight gags and groaners, almost none of which work.</P>
<P>     MEN IN TIGHTS ranks among the most excruciating movie-going
experiences I've ever had, and it's a damned shame.  Once upon a time,
Mel Brooks was funny.  There is evidence.  He was a writer for "Your
Show of Shows," co-created "Get Smart" and created such classic film
parodies as YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN and BLAZING SADDLES.  But for the past
fifteen years, his screen efforts have ranged from the dreadfully
uneven HISTORY OF THE WORLD, PART I to the breathtakingly dumb
SPACEBALLS to the pointless LIFE STINKS.  I honestly didn't think it
could get any worse.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, it got much worse.  MEN IN TIGHTS is a failure on
so many different levels, it's difficult to know where to begin.  The
acting is at times unwatchably bad, with Richard Lewis the primary
culprit, guilty of first degree mugging.  There was an editor in the
credits, so I assume there was one, although the positively leaden
pacing provides no evidence that he did anything but pick up a check.
And then there is the script, a cavalcade of miserable puns that goes
on...</P>
<PRE>   "A mime is a terrible thing to waste."
   ...and on...
   "Hey, Blinken."  "Did you say Abe Lincoln?"
   ...and on...
   "This is my friend Ahchoo."  "A Jew?  Here?"</PRE>
<P>     ...and on, and on, and on.  Then there is the requisite Brooksian
bodily function humor, and the gay jokes, and the breast jokes.  Then
there are moments when you know there was supposed to be some kind of
joke somewhere, but for the life of you, you can't figure out what it
was.  This is a film so jaw-droppingly unfunny that the few positive
reviews I've seen seem absolutely incomprehensible to me.</P>
<P>     What's even more of a shame is that Cary Elwes' Robin Hood is
actually quite charming.  He generates such enormous good will,
striking arms akimbo poses at every opportunity and doing his level
best to underplay his part, that I kept holding out hope that it might
get better.  Even more depressing is the cameo appearance by Patrick
Stewart as King Richard, a la Sean Connery in PRINCE OF THIEVES.
Whatever it was that they paid him, it couldn't possibly have been
enough.</P>
<P>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 arrows: 1 arrow, right through the
heart of whoever green-lighted this piece of garbage.</P>
