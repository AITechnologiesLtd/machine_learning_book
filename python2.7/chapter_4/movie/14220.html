Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</P>
<P>     At least they prepared me right off the bat, right there in the
credits.  I knew SIMON BIRCH was based on John Irving's whimsically
twisted 1989 novel _A Prayer for Owen Meany_, but I had also heard that
screenwriter/director Mark Steven Johnson had taken great liberties with
the text.  I didn't need to wait long to understand how many liberties,
thanks to an admirably forthright screen credit:  "Suggested by the novel
_A Prayer for Owen Meany_."  Not "inspired by," not "based on," not even
"loosely based on" like the 1995 travesty of _The Scarlet Letter_.
"Suggested by."</P>
<P>     I wish I had known Johnson was taking suggestions, because I might
have offered a few.  I might have suggested that he retain slightly more
than the basic set-up, involving two 12-year-old friends in a New England
Town circa the early 1960s.  Joe Wenteworth (Joseph Mazzello) is the son
of an unmarried woman (Ashley Judd) who has refused to divulge the
identity o fJoe's father; Simon Birch (Ian Michael Smith) was "the
smallest delivery ever recorded in the history of Gravestown Memorial
Hospital," and has remained unusually small.  The two young lives are
connected first by their status as town outsiders, then further sealed
when an errant Little League foul ball off the bat of tiny Simon has
tragic consequences.</P>
<P>     Right about there, all similarity to the source material ends.  Sure,
a few individual details remain, notably a school Christmas pageant which
goes dreadfully awry, but even that element is given an ill-advised twist.
The film's Simon, like his literary counterpart, has a preternaturally
mature sense of existential purpose, an almost arrogant belief that God
intends great things for him.  It makes no sense for that character -- who
schemes in the novel to be the Baby Jesus in the Nativity play because he
thinks only he can do the role justice -- to be turned into a grumpy and
reluctant Christ-child.  It makes even less sense for the Christmas Eve
catastrophe to begin with reverent-beyond-his-years Simon trying to feel
up the Virgin Mary.  Johnson goes for the cheap laughs of projectile
vomiting and pre-pubescent groping rather when he should be trying to
maintain some consistency in his characterizations.</P>
<P>     I don't mean to suggest that SIMON BIRCH is an awful film,
particularly if you walk in like most viewers with no knowledge of
Irving's novel.  Johnson has put together a tremendously appealing cast,
including Judd, David Strathairn, and an atypically slime-free Oliver
Platt (as the kindly suitor of Joe's mother).  The friendship between Joe
and Simon is unique and well-developed, though the more experienced
Mazzello makes first-time screen actor Smith look quite self-conscious at
times.  Even the narration (by an uncredited Jim Carrey, who also appears
as the adult Joe in the film's present-day framing scenes) is under-stated
and amusing.  The first half of SIMON BIRCH is generally satisfying, a
sprightly and quirky reminiscence cast in the autumn tones of Aaron E.
Schneider's cinematography.</P>
<P>     It's the latter half, which diverges most sharply from Irving's
story, that goes most horribly wrong.  The light-hearted, off-beat story
takes a sharp turn into melodrama in heavy syrup, centered around a school
bus crash which should make everyone who saw THE SWEET HEREAFTER thank
Whatever God to Whom They Pray that Mark Steven Johnson didn't get his
hands on it.  The music score (by the ever-cloying Marc Shaiman) begins
reminding us every several seconds that it's time to weep, eventually
building to the orchestral equivalent of yanking out your nose hairs one
at a time.  With its "oh by the way, in case you're a complete moron,
here's the moral of the story" punch line of dialogue, SIMON BIRCH is less
emotionally cathartic than it is emotionally insulting.  Johnson doesn't
just streamline Irving's sprawling narrative, he dumb-lines it, casting
everything in the broadest tear-jerker strokes.  What a waste of a 
singular story to turn it into a trite Hallmark card of a dramatic 
experience.  The power of suggestion sure can make people do foolish
things.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 powerless suggestions:  5.</PRE>
