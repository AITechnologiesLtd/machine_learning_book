Justin Theraux</P>
<P>At one point during AMERICAN PSYCHO a naked, bloodied Patrick Bateman
(Christian Bale) pursues a very unlucky hooker through his posh, modernist
apartment all while brandishing a chainsaw at about crotch level. (Note: This
is the second time I can recall seeing a chainsaw being employed as a phallic
symbol in a film, the first being SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE, which was also
directed by a woman. Draw your own conclusions). The poor prostitute stumbles
into various rooms and closets, running into Bateman's other victims some of
which lay dormant in transparent, sealed bags, while others pop out of hiding
places as if to shout "Boo!" It's a true "mad slasher" moment--insane,
frenzied, and absurdly funny, containing all the giddy sleaze that eluded
recent antiseptic slasher films like URBAN LEGEND and DISTURBING BEHAVIOR. And
AMERICAN PSYCHO isn't even a slasher film. At heart it's yet another in a long
line of recent bitter satires of American culture, although its "slasher"
elements will probably keep many from seeing it as that. The book had a similar
problem.</P>
<P>AMERICAN PSYCHO is based on Bret Easton Ellis' much debated novel of the same
name. As of now it's Ellis' penultimate novel, a vicious satire of the Me
Decade featuring a yuppie serial killer as a metaphor for 80's culture and
values. Bateman is that killer, a competitive narcissist (not to mention,
psycho) whom we first encounter, in the film, adorning himself like a Christmas
tree with various male beauty products (lest anyone forget that the 80's was
the decade when it became cool for a man to care what he looked like). Like
many psychotics, his life has some kind of order, a routine: he performs
countless abdominal crunches while THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE plays in the
foreground, heads off to work where he snidely interacts with his equally snide
colleagues, parties in nightclubs (the cheery 80's music is the ultimate
anti-theses of Bateman's debauched machismo…think PSYCHO set to the WEDDING
SINGER soundtrack), then caps off the night with frenzied sex and exaggerated
murder all while providing his commentary of popular 80's tunes to his
bewildered victims.</P>
<P>Though the movie contains much uncomfortable violence (but is really just about
as graphic as your average SCREAM flick), it's not nearly as detailed as its
source material was. In the film we see all this unfold in bits, never privy to
all of Bateman's acts, while the book is told entirely within Bateman's head.
We see everything through his subjectivity, and Bateman thrives on minutia. He
provides us with the various details of applying facial cream, choosing the
right suit, and so on. This is rather comical at first, till we soon realize
that he will use this technique to describe everything, even the heinous
murders he commits (some descriptions rattling on for five pages) going into
every thing he does to his victims, and every reaction he gets from doing so.
The result is vivid, but depressingly so.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, Ellis found a fresh way to comment on 80's greed and narcissism by
revealing the decade through the eyes of an upper echelon killer tweaked on a
culture that tells its young executives to destroy their opposition.</P>
<P>Bateman is a literal product of the 80's, caring only for his own
gratification. Throughout the novel we stay in his cluttered head, and marvel
at his contempt for everything except bland 80's music ("It's hip to be
Square!"). And we realize that the only thing that separates him from his
co-workers (all narcissistic and self-absorbed) is that he takes the wolfish
kill or be killed message quite literally.</P>
<P>It's to the film's credit that Bateman remains intact, expertly played by
Christian Bale as a man so far gone he's hardly a man anymore. Bale speaks in a
discombobulated growl, like an overly false parody of a how a "real man" should
talk. The affection isn't all that dissimilar from the ones his colleagues put
on. And on the outside Bateman doesn't seem terribly different from all the
self-absorbed brats who surround him. It's more than a joke that these guys can
hardly recognize each other; they're like drones with personalities that bleed
into one and other, and what a perfect place for a killer to get away with
murder ("Bateman? No he couldn't have done it, I had dinner with him last
night…I think"). Problem with the novel is that it gets bogged down with the
excess of drugs, sex, and murder. Harron focuses her film more tightly on the
satire and absurdity of Patrick.</P>
<P>Still it's interesting that much of Ellis does get up on the screen up on the
screen (as opposed to the film adaptation of LESS THAN ZERO, which featured
nothing of the author). This feels like a Bret Easton Ellis movie yet it works
to a greater extent than his novels because it contains all that makes him a
wily social commentator and little of what makes him a vacuous provocateur.</P>
<P>Harron's film gets at things that may have been obscured by the novel's extreme
vehemence. She shows us the casual disgust that men have for women while around
each other in scenes that play a lot like IN THE COMPANY OF MEN. Only Harron
takes it further, driving the message into us. It's as if the violence
committed by Bateman (the angry male) on his mostly female victims is an
extension of all the disgust and anger that males harbor towards women. The
novel's graphic rhythms have been reconfigured slightly, and transplanted to
the screen as the ultimate horror movie for women. A horror movie in which all
the men are predators, but only one truly indulges in his vicious predatory
urges.</P>
