<P> Anna and the King (1999) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Jodie Foster and
Chow Yun-Fat. Directed by Andy Tennant.</P>
<P> The first thing you can discern from reading the credits of "Anna and the
King" is that this will be a politcally correct interpretation of the
oft-told tale about the widowed English schoolteacher and the King of Siam.</P>
<P> You realize that when you see the film was directed by Andy Tennant, who
put a modernist, feminist spin on the Cinderella story in last year's
delightful "Ever After."</P>
<P> The second thing you realize about "Anna and the King" is that these are
two people who need to shuck their duds and just hop into bed together.
This movie emits as much sexual tension as two virgins on their wedding
night.</P>
<P> Then there's the nagging question you ask yourself as you watch "Anna and
the King". Why another remake of a story that - since 1947 - has been
filmed three times - once straight, and twice as the musical, "The King and
I" (the second musical was a dismal animated version released earlier this
year).</P>
<P> "Anna and the King," taken for what it is, is an entertaining, but
overlong movie. Running nearly 2 1/2 hours, about 30 minutes could have
been saved if Tennant had judiciously edited out all the meaningful and
smoldering glances between Anna (Jodie Foster) and King Mongkut of Siam
(Chow Yun-Fat).</P>
<P> Yes, we get it, Andy. Unrequited love, the passion that cannot be
consummated because of propriety as well as society's 19th century
conventions concerning the co-mingling of the races.</P>
<P> So, let's move on with the rest of the story.</P>
<P> Watching "Anna and the King" is an interesting experience, especially if
you have seen the 1947 version starring Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison. Then,
the notion of British colonialism, the bringing of Western culture and
ideas to less developed parts of the world, was applauded and seen as "the
white man's burden," to quote Kipling.
My, how times have changed. When Anna talks of the British bringing
enlightenment to the rest of the world, her Indian servants merely shakes
their heads at each other.</P>
<P> Later, Anna castigates the British officials in Siam for initiating the
political intrigues in an attempt to incorporate the country into its
sphere.</P>
<P> One added subplot concerning a rebellion to overthrow the king adds some
action missing from previous versions of the story.</P>
<P> As Anna, Foster is prissy, prim, proper and unbelievable. This is a role
that should have been played by an English actress - an Emma Thompson or
Kate Winslett or Emily Watson. Foster seems to be spending a lot of time
concentrating on making sure she maintains her accent.</P>
<P> Chow Yun-Fat. Ah, there's another story. He can almost make you forget Yul
Brynner. He has an aura of dignity and wisdom as the king. He is not so
childish or overtly funny as Brynner. His is a sly humor mixed with a
knowledge of the world as well as people.</P>
<P> This is a king with sex appeal, thus making it more understandable while
all his wives love him. This king also is a family man, concerned about all
his sons and daughters, and they reciprocate that love.</P>
<P> The story is so well known that I don't thin I'm giving anything away by
showing another example of how the story has been redirected to make it
more politically correct.</P>
<P> In the other versions of the story when the girl Tuptim betrays the king,
she is punished because the king's pride and honor are wounded. Here, the
king is forced to carry out the punishment because Anna interfered, thus he
would lose face with his ministers and people if he acts to pardon the girl.</P>
<P> It's a subtle difference, but one that does help set the tone of the movie.</P>
<P> "Anna and the King," which was mostly filmed in Thailand, is very pretty
to watch. Beautiful scenery gives you a new appreciation of that small
nation. But you could have gotten the same from a travelogue.</P>
<P> Overall, the movie is like vanilla ice cream. It tastes OK but needs some
added ingredients to spice it up.</P>
