<PRE>The Hair Off
The Big Tease</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"He'll be among his own kind," Local Glasgow friends of Crawford Mackenzie
say of the gay stylist as he takes off to L.A. to compete in that huge
extravaganza -- the World Freestyle Hairdressing Championship.</P>
<P>This is a mock documentary with the flamboyant, boyishly-naïve, Scottish
comedian Craig Ferguson as the man with the golden comb. He's perpetually
fresh, and spunky - a young Will Smith with white skin and an accent. Never
caught on film acting, every line and camera-captured glance seems true,
innocent and delightfully unrehearsed.</P>
<P>The film is shot and edited with the same energy and flare playfully
embodying its charmingly cocky protagonist. Repeated still frames, with a
flash to imply photo-shots are just one gimmick the filmmakers use to keep
the pace snappy. Another is multiple chop cut interviews, so that commentary
never gets boring.</P>
<P>After receiving a letter to "participate" in an international hair
competition, our modestly vain stylist flies to L.A. only to discover that
he's become the victim of a promotionally motivated misunderstanding.
Undaunted (mostly) he braves heart first into the often cold-hearted
bureaucratic web of "who you know" in Hollywood in order to correct the
oversight and compete legitimately among the top hair professionals of the
world.</P>
<P>Just plain, good, clean fun; the tease climaxes in a ridiculous display of
hair presentation. Of course, you'll be routing for the underdog as
contestants go head to head; the M.C. remarks, "the tension in this room is
so thick you could style it with a comb."</P>
