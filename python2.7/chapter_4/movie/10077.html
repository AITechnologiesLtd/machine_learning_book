<PRE> "Good Will Hunting" </PRE>
<PRE> Rating: *** ( out of **** )</PRE>
<PRE>  By Fernando Vallejo</PRE>
<P> A Miramax Pictures release. Starring Robin Williams, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck,
Stellan Skarsgard, Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser, George Plimpton.
Script by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Produced by Lawrence Bender. Directed by
Gus Van Sant. Running Time: 125 mins. Rated R.</P>
<P>"Good Will Hunting" is two movies in one: an independent take on the struggle
of four Boston pals and a traditional Hollywood, "prodigy child" film complete
with upbeats, downfalls, sporadically moving situations and plenty, plenty of
shtick.</P>
<P> Unusually directed by Gus Van Sant, "Good Will Hunting"  overcomes the
banalities of its story by affirming the emergence of fresh, new talent. The
film stars Matt Damon as Will Hunting as a mathematical, rebellious whiz kid
inadvertly discovered by a college professor ( Stellan Skarsgard ), who places
him under psychological supervision with Robin Williams. In a nutshell, that's
it.</P>
<P>The core of the "Good Will Hunting" is Damon, who infuses the script ( co-
written by "Chasing Amy's" Ben Affleck ) with just the right amount of warmth,
sensitivity and humanity to accentuate his position as a refreshing multi-
talented performer. But it's the acting that hits the mark, and Damon hits all
the right notes, flying over Robin Williams' deja-vu role ("Awakenings" was
written all over this ) as a devastated shrink who has closed all contact with
society due to his wife's tragic death. Damon effortlessly blends the
carelesness of a gregarious, confused thug with the absorbing ingeniousness of
someone like Einstein. His rich, complex character is the pulp of "Good Will
Hunting." Everything else pales in comparison.</P>
<P> "Good Will Hunting" exposes the lack of profoundness of deliberately
schmaltzy storytelling, but, unlike "Little Man Tate" or "Phenomenon", it
doesn't set up its story in a black and white, point A to point B be manner,
but as the saga of an extraordinary individual whose feasibility for success
doesn't automatically signify he must make easy, familiar choices, like the
protagonists in the aforementioned. </P>
