<PRE>THE WIZARD OF OZ</PRE>
<P> Reviewed by Harvey Karten, Ph.D.

Grapewin, Munchkins, Toto</P>
<P>   I'd like five bucks for every time someone called out to me,
"Hey, Toto!" when I walk my cairn terrier around the
neighborhood.  "Is that really Toto?" adults would stop and
ask me, and I'd of course reply, "Sure it is; I've had him for
sixty-three years now."  As for the kids, well, surprisingly
enough some of them never saw "The Wizard of Oz" so the
best they can do is say, "Ma, Ma, look at the dog!"  Pretty
soon, though, thanks to a dramatic re-release of "The Wizard
of Oz," every kid for miles around will be joining the
grownups: "Ma, Ma, look, there's Toto!"</P>
<P>   Why do so many people know about this movie?   Sure,
it's one of the 100 greats, and in fact the American Film
Institute called it #6 in eminence.  But then, most Americans
probably haven't seen others on the list--anything by
Antonioni, Fellini, Buneul.  Roger Ebert has a theory, as he
says in his essay on "The Wizard of Oz"..."Elements
powerfully fill a void that exists inside
many children....home is everything, the center of the world.
But over the rainbow is the wide earth, fascinating and
terrifying.  There is a deep fundamental fear that events
might conspire to transport the child from the safety of home
and strand him far away in a strange land.  And what would
he hope to find there?  Why, new friends, to advise and
protect him."</P>
<P>   The Great American Movie Classic, one of those few
movies that come across as vividly the 15th time around as
the first, follows the odyssey of Dorothy Gale who at the age
of 16 is disappointed with her life on a remote Kansas farm
and with being ignored by her busy aunt and her workers. 
She dreams of flying over the rainbow to a magical fairyland,
some place preferable to life with hogs and seemingly
indifferent people.  When a tornado causes her to bump her
head and fall momentarily unconscious she, her little dog
Toto, and her entire house are presumably swept up and
taken to just such a fairyland, where she meets up with three
unforgettable characters who look surprisingly like the folks
back home.  Despite a series of breathtaking adventures with
them and with a wicked witch, a good one, a band of happy
munchkins, and a putative, god-like wizard who is other than
he seems, she realizes that it doesn't pay to wish for too
many things--because you just may get them.  Wanting
nothing more than to go home, she begins to appreciate her
aunt and her life in Kansas all the more, having taken an
incredible flight of fancy.</P>
<P>   What is more surprising than Dorothy's wind-swept tour is
the fact that this movie, which people see annually on TV,
has not been viewed for twenty-five years the way it should
be.   Not only do we now get to see the whole drama on the
wide screen: we see it with Warner Bros.' digitally restored
and remastered Dolby Ditial Stereo Sound.  The studio has
also spent nine months reconstructing the sepia opening and
cleaning and restoring damages and flickering with which the
1939 film masters suffered.  Originally released by MGM and
re-released by that studio in 1949 and 1955, "The Wizard of
Oz" got a TV broadcast in '56, so that youngsters of all ages
can appreciate the magnificent acting of the tragic figure of
Judy Garland in the role of Dorothy, who is supported ably by
comic figures Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr and Frank Morgan as her
three friends.  Not to be underestimated is the movie's cairn
terrier, Toto (playing himself), a mischievous pup who is
inseparable from her mistress and who is responsible in one
of the concluding scenes for removing the wool over
Dorothy's eyes, so to speak.</P>
<P>   What more can one say for a film that is virtually without
flaws?  If we must point out one blemish, it is in the scene in
which the exposed wizard gives the four travelers the movie's
meaning, a talky monologue particularly considering that the
kids in the movie audience will endure a drop-off in interest--
as indeed they did in a recent invitational screening.  All
things considered, parents who do not take their youngsters
to this seminal event in their rites of passage might have
abuse charges filed against them.  But then what adult could
fail to be enchanted by the remarkable, colorful,
heartwarming "Wizard of Oz"?</P>
