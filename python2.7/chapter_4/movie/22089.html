<P> Happy Texas (1999) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Jeremy Northam, Steve Zahn,
William H. Macy, Ally Walker and Illeana Douglas.</P>
<P> "Happy Texas" is just that, a happy little, unpretentious comedy.</P>
<P> The movie's impetus is that old chestnut about the escaped cons who are
mistaken for other people. It's a twist that dates as far back as Charlie
Chaplin's "The Adventurer."</P>
<P> In this case, Harry (Jeremy Northam) and Wayne (Steve Zahn) are believed
to be two beauty pageant producers hired by the town of Happy, Texas, to
help qualify the town's girls for the Little Miss Squeezed Pageant.</P>
<P> Oh, and the townspeople also think the pageant pros are gay. So, Harry and
Wayne go along in order to remain undetected by the law as well as to scope
out the local bank, which is ripe for pickin'.</P>
<P> Along the way both men get involved with local women - Harry with Jo (Ally
Walker), the owner of the bank, and Wayne with Miss Schaefer (Illeana
Douglas), a schoolteacher.</P>
<P> "Happy Texas "is one of those farces built upon mistaken identities. It's
a fun movie, filled with enjoyable, warm characters.</P>
<P> And it has the added pleasure of William H. Macy as Chappy, Happy's
sheriff, whose low-key wooing of Harry is touching as well as comedic.</P>
<P> Macy transforms a one-note character into a person with depth. When he
hurts, you feel his pain.</P>
<P> Northam is the straight man (no pun intended), spending most of his time
wooing Jo and learning the intricacies of the bank. He's the brains of the
outfit.</P>
<P> Zahn (best remembered as the girl-crazy member of The Wonders in Tom
Hanks' "That Thing You Do") is broader as the easily-frustrated Wayne. He
hates the idea of posing as a gay man since it is against his macho nature.</P>
<P> Zahn is quite funny without being disrespectful.
And Douglas is a delight as the man-hungry Miss Schaefer who believes her
allure can help Zahn's Wayne switch his gender preference.</P>
<P> Ultimately, the two cons become heroes and everything works out for the best.
After all, this is a comedy.</P>
<P> "Happy Texas" written by Ed Stone, Phil Reeves and Mark Illsley, and
directed by Illsley, is an undemanding, good-time movie. The laughs are
consistent, and nearly continuous.</P>
<P> But it also is a movie with heart, a delightful combination.</P>
