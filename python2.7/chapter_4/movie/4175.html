<PRE>                              FEAST OF JULY
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     When you see the words "A Merchant Ivory Production," you can be
forgiven if you expect the very best in filmmaking.  Remember A ROOM
WITH A VIEW and HOWARD'S END, among others?  It is therefore with
regret that I have to report that FEAST OF JULY does not live up to
their usual work.</P>
<P>     The film opens with Bella Ford (Embeth Davidtz whom you will
remember from SCHINDLER'S LIST) trudging across a barren wasteland in
England.  This scene should have been edited to half its length.  Bella
falls or sits down and suddenly there is blood as she gives birth to a
dead baby.  Bella buries the child and continues walking, searching for
the whereabouts of Arch Wilson (Greg Wise), who after fathering the
child, abandons Bella.</P>
<P>     When Bella finally makes it into town, the man who lights the
street lamps (Ben Wainwright) sees her, and invites her to stay with
his wife (Gemma Jones) and their three handsome sons, Jedd (James
Purefoy), Matty (Kenneth Anderson), and Con (Ben Chaplin).  As one
would guess, the three sons are immediately enchanted by Bella and are
determined she will be theirs.  When harvest time arrives they sit down
to the Feast of July; hence, the title.</P>
<P>     Just as Bella finally chooses Con to be her fiance, tragedy
strikes the family with the arrival of Wilson, the man who had
abandoned Bella.</P>
<P>     What detracted greatly from the film was the ending.  Somehow Paul
Bradley, the screenplay writer, or perhaps it was Ms. Davidtz, failed
to elicit any sympathy for Bella.  Without the sympathy the film ends
on a bad note.</P>
