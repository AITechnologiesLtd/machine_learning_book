<PRE>"Mantan" and "Sleep'n'Eat"
Bamboozled</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Bamboozled is a term Malcolm X used to describe the treatment of blacks by
the whites back in the 1900's.</P>
<P>In the film "Bamboozled," we follow TV producer Pierre Delacroix (Wayans)
who's dropped his American accent in favor of a countryless Harvardy dialect
and his American name for a French one. The character is interesting, but
the speech much more annoying than need be.</P>
<P>As the "sole person of color" working for CNS, and frustrated with his
impossible-to-please boss, a desperate Pierre goes for the outrageous and
creates a TV show intended to satire black stereotypes. "Mantan the New
Millennium Minstrel show" boldly black-faces (as in Al Jolson) the black
lead actors (a tap dancer and singer) and proudly hails its anthem, "Nigger
is a beautiful thing." Set in a watermelon patch, this black "Hee-Haw" with
the balls of "South Park" leaves its studio audience (as well as
theater-goers) squinting, wincing, wondering. But the confused watchers
eventually polarize: those who think the show is a funny way to mock
stereotypes on one end; those with shaking fists, dead set on stifling this
revival of old slave-mentality TV on the other.</P>
<P>Every black hackneyed film and cartoon image since the turn of the century
(1800's to 1900's, that is) are replayed with the purpose of twisting
America's stabbing pain of embarrassment a quarter turn in hopes of opening
the minds of those that control the media by enraging/educating those that
watch it.</P>
<P>But the film twists more than this, an underground group of revolutionaries
doesn't quite find the "Amos and Andy" crap funny. "I feel like Dr.
Frankenstein," Pierre confesses as this satirical project slowly slips from
his command.</P>
<P>As in the film, different people within (and outside of) the black community
have their own different ideas on how to best assist the processes of
quelling 20th century racist residue. Some will no doubt find that this film
(like its fictional "Mantan Minstrel Show") heartily takes steps towards
that goal. Others will hark Pierre's own point, "That was 400 years ago, let
it go, move on!" Still others, just won't know what to think. I found myself
rotating among these three perspectives. Either way, this film provokes
thought, pressing buttons while it entertains.</P>
<P>The taping of the pilot sequence is break out fresh and bold. I loved it!
Impressive also, the climax sequence; while simultaneously grossly humorous
and solidly dramatic, it left me with a blinking question mark over my head.
Jade Pinkett-Smith, Savion Glover, and Tommy Davidson give very strong
performances, but Damon Wayans accent is more annoying than satirically
entertaining.</P>
<P>"Bamboozled" is shot on videotape, sometimes this supports the feel and
intent of the film, and at other times hinders it; but for the most part
doesn't effect the play.</P>
