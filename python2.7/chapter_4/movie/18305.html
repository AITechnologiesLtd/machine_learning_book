Directed By Mike Barker
Running Time: 1 hour 33 minutes</P>
<PRE>(Fox Searchlight Pictures)</PRE>
<P>Best Laid Plans is well made, well acted, well directed and a fun ride. The
film opens by introducing us to two friends, Bryce (Brolin) and Nick
(Nivola) talking in a cafe. The sexy Lissa (Witherspoon) walks in, and the
action cuts away from the cafe to Nick's answering an phone call from a
panic stricken Bryce asking Nick to come to his house straight away. When
Nick arrives, we found out that Lissa had accused Bryce of raping her, and
Bryce, in a state of confusion, has tied her up downstairs. Suddenly, the
film cuts away again, and we see how this situation came to arise.
Obviously, not everything is what as it seems.</P>
<P>Full of little twists and turns, Best Laid Plans is a film that can only be
watched once, but is good fun. The script is well written, and most of the
turns you won't see coming. Although the plot is nothing new,  the bulk of
the movie about a failed heist, it's done well enough to provide a lot of
entertainment value. There's also some intense scenes of tension, and the
film is paced well enough to make sure the audience is left waiting for the
next twist, and not falling asleep. This thriller gets off to a get start:
most of it is thrilling and engaging.</P>
<P>The largely unknown cast are also very good. Brolin is excellent as the
panicky, nieve Bryce, and while most actors would completely overdo the role
he's playing, Bryce makes his panic seem believable, not laughable.
Witherspoon, after an great turn in Pleasantville, is charming here,
although her role isn't beefy enough to produce an excellent performance.
She's watchable, however, and looks great as usual. This is an actress to
look out for. Nivola, as the cool Nick, underplays the role to great effect,
and is very watchable. His calm, cool collectiveness is great on-screen, and
he carries the whole movie. He is certainly the star of the show, in a role
that seems to be tailored made for him.</P>
<P>British director Mike Barker handles the film well, producing a stylish
effort. The lighting is moody, and the action is well done. There are some
great moments of direction where the audience is thrown off centre, and he
uses the camera well to heighten the moments of tension, such as the camera
swirling round a room or the characters. Unfortunately, style seems to be
slightly more important than story, and occasionally the story does suffer
due to the director working more on the look of the film. Therefore,
although the story is fun, it is also somewhat slight and shallow, and won't
be remembered for a long time after the film is over.</P>
<P>But, overall, Best Laid Plans is a pleasant surprise. I walked into the
movie 'blind', i.e not knowing what to expect, and I came out pleased. It is
an well made piece of filmmaking, and tells it's simple story in an
entertaining way. There's twists to keep the brain happy, visuals to keep
the eye happy, and some good dialogue to keep the ears happy. With a
talented young cast giving it their all, a great soundtrack, and good
production design, Best Laid Plans is the biggest surprise of the year so
far. If you're looking for a purely enjoyable little thriller, albeit with a
somewhat underdeveloped script,  Best Laid Plans, although no classic, is
recommended.</P>
