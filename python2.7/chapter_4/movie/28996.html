<PRE>Tank Girl (1995) 104m.</PRE>
<P>Most people who'd read the comics by Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett hated 
this live-action film version, although I think that says more about the 
quality of the comic books than the movie.  The setting is familiar enough: 
a post-apocalyptic future, mostly desert, with rag-tag rebels fighting an 
evil overlord for water.  TANK GIRL doesn't want to commit to being set in 
either America or Australia, so settles for both (or neither) which would 
make more sense if the rest of the story was treated in the same way, i.e. 
an excerpt from a larger scenario rather than a complete arc.  It was 
undoubtedly even more annoying for readers of the comic who saw Tank Girl's 
'history' being rewritten for the screen.</P>
<P>The film-makers may have made some bad decisions in TANK GIRL but they did 
get the casting right for the lead role.  Even though much of the casual 
vulgarity of the original character was removed, Lori Petty still makes a 
spunky, perky Tank Girl.  I don't think we need to see the processes 
responsible for her transformation into the heroine of the title, however, 
nor the introduction to her friend Jet Girl (less convincingly assumed by 
Naomi Watts).  Since Petty's character remains consistent throughout the 
movie, it wouldn't have mattered if Tank and Jet smashed their way on to the 
screen from frame one.  In fact, the whole story is just wrong for these two 
characters - they should have had more desert time, tank time and jet time 
instead of spending most of the movie indoors.  The rebel band of 
genetically modified kangaroo men ('rippers') is also a mistake.  Their 
scenes drag and they fare no better than animated action figures.  And 
lastly, the movie's potential star attraction - namely, the tank -  is badly 
wasted.  This overblown variation of the gun-as-penis metaphor is perfect 
for the sexually aggressive Petty (the theme from SHAFT plays when she 
drapes herself all over the tank's barrel, sighing "I'm in love" ) but 
appears too late into the story.  The tank, an effectively scrappy composite 
of Rube Goldberg punk, is relegated to night sequences which fail to show it 
off to its best advantage; similarly Jet Girl's stolen jet makes only one 
appearance in its newly-liberated form before it gets repainted back into 
its former military colors.</P>
<P>With its lead characters, props and source material, TANK GIRL could have 
been a blast.  Director Rachel Talalay was forced to cut material, but I 
doubt this missing footage would have improved the film.  You may find 
yourself wishing that the film-makers had decided to ditch the live action 
concept and extended TANK GIRL's two brilliantly animated sequences into a 
full feature instead.  Why not?  Petty's already got that cartoon-character 
voice down pat.</P>
