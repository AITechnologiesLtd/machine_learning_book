                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
  3 :-) :-) :-)  for a game of strategy on the chessboard of organised
                                  crime</PRE>
<P>Cast: Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, David
Strathairn, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito Director: Curtis Hanson
Screenplay: Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland based on the novel by
James Ellroy</P>
<P>This movie is about good cops and bad cops, with shades of grey smudging
the fine line in between. Throw in a classy hooker and the dead rat
smells like organised crime.</P>
<P>The good cop (Guy Pearce) follows in the footsteps of his old man and
carries his badge with honour and duty. His father, a highly decorated
dick in the police force was gunned down by a nobody felon who got away
with it. His motivation for joining the force is to catch the ghost of
the murderer who killed his father, and any criminal that thinks he
won't get caught. With more brains than brawn, and spectacles to go with
intelligence, he's a goody two shoes who knows when to snitch on another
cop and climb the political arena of justice at the same time.</P>
<P>The bad cop (Russel Crowe) watched his mother beaten to death by his
father as a boy. His idea of justice comes with a fist and a punch
before reading your rights. He makes a good thug of an interrogator, and
knows how to beat all the crap and information out of you. This angry
young man won't take no for an answer, and when it comes to battered
women, he gives the abusive husband an equally good battering. He's not
your regular textbook cop who follows the rules, and will take the law
into his own hands by executing justice with the point of his gun. This
renegade lone star is someone you don't want around in a highly volatile
situation, but if your life is on the line he knows how to let the
bullets fly.</P>
<P>The grey cop (Kevin Spacey) can't remember why he became a cop in the
first place. His motivation and sense of right and wrong have become
blurred by the glitz of Hollywood. He's a cop seeking media attention
and knows how to play smart, look good and talk right. He'll tell you
what you want to hear, and gives you a hell of a story to sell. His
brushes with fame come in the form of catching movie stars and high
profile politicians engaging the services of prostitutes. He'll do just
about anything to make the headlines with a photo snap. His amoral life
takes a turn when a set-up between a male prostitute and councillor goes
badly wrong. This wakes up his conscience long since drowned by years of
bribe taking and easy living. Before he can make amends for his waylaid
calling, his life is snatched from him as easily as slipping a 50 dollar
bill into your wallet.</P>
<P>The classy hooker (Kim Basinger) looks like Veronica Lake. She knows how
to play both good cop and bad cop to her best advantage, and can make a
man come as easily as slipping out of her lingerie and into bed. Her
tools are seduction and trickery, but the moves are not hers to direct.
She is a lowly pawn on the chessboard of crime that is used by a crafty
master in the grand finale act of checkmate. She is lucky to survive the
game when so many other important pieces have already been sacrificed
for the greater goal of winning.</P>
<P>This is certainly one of the better suspense, mystery thrillers of the
year, with intelligent script writing, plot control and motivation. Well
worth a nod towards at the cinema.</P>
