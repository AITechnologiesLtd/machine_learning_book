<PRE>Romeo and Juliet (1968)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 80</PRE>
<P>Of all the cinematic adaptations of William
Shakespeare's plays, none look better than
Zeffirelli's "Romeo and Juliet".  The sets,
the costumes, and the cinematography are
bright and colorful, while the cast radiates
with youth and energy.  The film was also
aided by a memorable score by Nino Rota,
composer for several Fellini films and who
would later be best known for his score of
"The Godfather".</P>
<P>"Romeo and Juliet" was the third consecutive
Shakespearean play for Italian director
Franco Zeffirelli, following a British television
production of "Much Ado about Nothing" and
a big-budget Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton
vehicle, "The Taming of the Shrew".  Zeffirelli
would later tackle "Othello" and "Hamlet",
but his most successful adaptation was clearly
"Romeo and Juliet", one of the biggest grossing
films of the year.</P>
<P>Zeffirelli made several bold moves with "Romeo
and Juliet" that paid off handsomely.  Unlike
"Shrew", the film was cast with largely unknowns
(Michael York would become a star only later)
that were very close in age to the characters.
While this created greater realism, it put quite
a burden on the leads, who had to deliver whole
paragraphs of tongue-tangling seventeenth-century
dialogue.  (Sometimes the young actors take the
melodrama too much to heart, giving exaggerated
performance.)  There's also a morning-after scene
with some nudity, which was probably a surprise
to most 1968 filmgoers.</P>
<P>The story is well known, loaded with tragedy
that could always have been so easily averted.
It takes place in renaissance Italy.  Romeo
Montague (Leonard Whiting) and Juliet Capulet
(Olivia Hussey) fall in love, despite the fact
that their families are bitter enemies.  Their
heavy romance is threatened by the discord,
which is especially promoted by arrogant Tybalt
(Michael York) and jester Mercutio (John McEnery).
The story's greatest weakness has Romeo,
seething with rage, avenging Tybalt's murder.
It just doesn't fit his character.</P>
