<P>     Following several release delays, MULHOLLAND FALLS has finally 
reached theaters.  Usually, when a distributor keeps putting off a 
film's opening, it's a sign that there's something wrong with the 
production, and, about halfway through MULHOLLAND FALLS' one-hundred 
seven minute running length, we figure out what that "something" is:  
the plot, to put it charitably, is shaky.  This is a great looking film 
with a fine cast, but, when all is said and done, the storyline doesn't 
cut it.  It's convoluted, contrived, and, worst of all, has a 
disappointing payoff.</P>
<P>     Don't blame veteran cinematographer Haskell Wexler (WHO'S AFRAID OF 
VIRGINIA WOOLF?) for MULHOLLAND FALLS' failings, however.  This is one 
of the most visually striking films to come out this year.  Everything 
is gorgeous, from the scenes of downtown LA in the '50s to a panoramic 
view of the city at night.  There is also one truly awe-inspiring moment 
when four men stand at the lip of an atomic crater and gaze into its 
maw.  That image will be remembered after everything else in this movie 
is forgotten.</P>
<P>     Because of its tone and subject matter, MULHOLLAND FALLS recalls 
CHINATOWN, albeit incompletely.  Nick Nolte is Max Hoover, the head of 
an elite group of four LA cops (based on the real life "Hat Squad") 
whose job is, simply put, to "get rid of gangsters and criminals."  His 
partners are Coolidge (Chazz Palminteri) and the one-dimensional duo of 
Hall and Relyea (underplayed by those two RESERVOIR DOGS, Michael Madsen 
and Chris Penn).  These are hard-bitten guys with tailored suits who 
aren't bothered by anything -- when a mobster comes into their town, 
they take him out for a spin in their black Buick convertible, then 
throw him off a cliff somewhere along Mulholland Drive.  One day, 
they're called to investigate the murder of a young woman (Jennifer 
Connelly), who is found crushed to death a few miles outside LA.  Clues, 
including a damning reel of salacious film, point to the involvement of 
a high-placed U.S. government official (John Malkovich).  The case 
unsettles Max, however, since he had recently ended a six-month affair 
with the girl.</P>
<P>     For a while, MULHOLLAND FALLS looks like a solid noir thriller.  
The plot, which generates a certain degree of tension, builds slowly.  
How did the girl die?  What was a sliver of radioactive glass doing in 
her heel?  How is the atomic energy commission involved?  And will 
Hoover and his three partners get to the bottom of things before someone 
gets rid of them?  Unfortunately, as each of these questions is 
answered, the story becomes progressively less interesting and harder to 
swallow.  By the end, we're left feeling cheated, as if the writers 
squandered a number of promising ideas.  </P>
<P>     The acting, like so much else in MULHOLLAND FALLS, is uneven.  
Nolte presents an effective portrait of a blase cop who suddenly finds 
his once-stable world turned upside down.  On the other hand, 
Palminteri, who excels at playing New York gangsters, is all wrong for a 
West Coast cop (even though Coolidge asserts that he's from Jersey).  
Madsen and Penn, like most of the supporting characters, are window 
dressing. Malkovich is suitably creepy in limited screen time.  And 
Jennifer Connelly is sultry and appealing, even though she appears 
exclusively in flashbacks.</P>
<P>     MULHOLLAND FALLS isn't a bad film, but it definitely is 
disappointing, especially coming from director Lee Tamahori, who brought 
the powerful ONCE WERE WARRIORS to the screen.  Tamahori's direction is 
inconsistent, but, ultimately, this movie is undermined by its 
screenplay.  Certain aspects are laudable, but, all things considered, 
those elements aren't enough to keep MULHOLLAND FALLS from slipping over 
the edge into mediocrity.</P>
