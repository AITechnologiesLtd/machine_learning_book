<P>TEXAS BLOOD MONEY: FROM DUSK TILL DAWN 2</P>
<P>  I have just seen the straight to video sequel to From Dusk Till Dawn and I
enjoyed it quite a bit. It has a definite straight to video feel to it (perhaps
because it was filmed in South Africa) but also transcends the genre and will
probably become a minor cult favorite in its own right. 
  I am a fan of the original film although I consider it highly flawed. I think
the first half is great and I love the idea of a bank robber movie that
completely out of the blue turns into a vampire movie. Unfortunately, since the
second half is really a whole different movie, it ends up feeling abrupt when
it ends, like you've only seen one half of a vampire movie. I love the scene
where they emerge from the Titty Twister into the sun ("What were they?
Psychos?") but I still feel a little ripped off - I ought to feel exhausted,
like they really were in there from dusk till dawn. I ought to feel the way I
do at the end of the Evil Dead movies or Dawn of the Dead. But I just don't.
For all the amusing bits in the vampire portion of the movie, it just doesn't
come together smoothly and doesn't work either as a solid horror movie or as a
perfect horror comedy like Evil Dead 2 or An American Werewolf in London. And
the more comedic tone of the vampire section seems to betray some of the
serious themes that were brought up in the first half.
  Texas Blood Money doesn't have the same vivid photography and atmosphere as
Rodriguez's film, and it doesn't have as good of a cast. Robert Patrick, Brett
Harrelson, Muse Watson, Duane Whitaker and Bo Hopkins *sounds* like a good cast
to me, and they are adequate, but you can't help but notice that they don't
have that powerful badass presence that Clooney and some of his co-stars
(particularly Fred Williamson and Tom Savini) had in the original. I was
disappointed that Harrelson's acting was weak, after having really liked him in
The People vs. Larry Flynt. There he was as convincingly and likably dim as his
real life brother Woody. Here he forces wide eyed naivete and reminds me of the
young guy in the remake of Night of the Living Dead. 
  This sequel also suffers from some cheesy Full Moon Video style keyboard
scoring (although some of the music mimics Rodriguez's soundtrack style, even
using a different version of a song that was used in Desperado). I think a real
orchestral score would have improved the film immensely. It's hard to think of
something as horrific when accompanied by a keyboard trying to sound like
violins.
  The creepy, organic textures of Rodriguez's sets have been lost, and clearly
the original Titty Twister set no longer exists. On the exterior we only see
the sign, and the interior is a biker bar decked out in hubcaps and pink
insulation. It doesn't have the epic decadence of the original bar, which was
like an Aztec temple designed by a rock 'n roll Caligula.
  But that's the bad news. The good news is that the sequel is more
over-the-top and constantly inventive than the original. The film is directed
and co-written by Scott Spiegel, best known as the co-writer of Evil Dead 2,
and it shows. Spiegel doesn't have as strong of a visual sense as his pal Sam
Raimi, but it has certainly improved since his previous films. Texas Blood
Money takes camera gimmicks to a hilariously excessive level. This film has
bat-cams, mouth-cams, skull-cams, a pushup-cam, a rotating-fan-cam, a
spinning-combination-lock-cam, even a
pipe-impaling-a-vampire-played-by-famous-rapper-Yoyo-cam. 
  The fight scenes are full of the vampire super strength we saw a little of in
the original, allowing for many people to get socked and fly through the air.
Vampires throw people through windows and kick cars across streets. Sometimes
vampire powers aren't even necessary, since there are some explosions and
gunshots that also send people flying like missiles. I love over-the-top
touches like the scene where a vampire tosses a cop off the roof, causing him
to be shocked by powerlines, then bounce through the air and come crashing down
on top of a car. Then there is the scene where a SWAT team storms the bank
off-camera. We hear gunshots and screams, followed by silence, and then a
severed head comes flying out the door and splats against a wall across the
street.
  There are also occasional funny dialogue bits that may or may not have been
supervised by producer Quentin Tarantino. (The script is by Spiegel and Duane
Whitaker from a story by Spiegel and Boaz Yakin [of Fresh fame], but Tarantino
is said to have had input.) I like the scene where the gang waits in a hotel
room watching a "fuck movie" and discussing whether or not it is legitimate to
criticize a porn film for having a weak story. "You know what's wrong with this
movie," asserts Muse Watson thoughtfully. "We've been watching it for a good
half hour and there's been no ass fucking."
  Speaking of fucking, even the fucking in this movie is over-the-top, with
Raymond Cruz's character Jesus apparently going for some sort of bouncing
record. This scene seems to exist solely to set up a pretty well done variation
on the Psycho shower scene, with a little bat playing the part of Mother. And
the shower scene itself is a set up for the best bad pun I've heard in a while:
"It looks like a real bloodbath," says one cop surveying the blood-drenched
tub.
  If you like that kind of thing, you might want to check out this movie. And
if you don't like that kind of thing, what the hell is wrong with you?</P>
