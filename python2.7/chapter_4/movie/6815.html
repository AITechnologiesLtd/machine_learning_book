<PRE>(R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Before his untimely death last year, rapper-actor Tupac Shakur left
behind a number of completed films in the can.  The first to see the light
of day is Gridlock'd, the energetic and enjoyable screenwriting and
directing debut of actor Vondie Curtis-Hall (Broken Arrow, TV's Chicago Hope
and Cop Rock).</P>
<P>After his girlfriend Cookie (Thandie Newton) falls into a
drug-induced coma, heroin junkie Spoon (Shakur) decides to lay off the dope,
forcing his comrade-in-blow Stretch (Tim Roth) to join him in detox.  This
simple decision sets off an exhausting chain of events where Stretch and
Spoon run around town dealing with bureaucrats of varying rigidity and flee
from a drug kingpin (Curtis-Hall) and the police, who suspect the two when a
fellow drug fiend and his girlfriend are murdered.</P>
<P>Sounds like pretty heavy stuff, and sometimes it is.  But like the
big heroin-themed film of last year, Danny Boyle's Trainspotting, the film
is often quite funny, deftly walking the thin line between the harrowing and
the hilarious.  And the humor does not come out of nowhere and feel out of
place; like life itself, comedy sometimes spring forth naturally from
tragedy, with some inherent dark humor being found in what can be seen as
the most serious of moments.  But this is not to say that Curtis-Hall
glosses over heroin addiction.  Spoon and especially Stretch are seen for
what they are--loser junkies--living in a dirty, cluttered apartment and
getting into messes they could easily have avoided, often getting out
through sheer luck alone (which results in some overly contrived moments).
Curtis-Hall does add some interesting visual flair to the proceedings, using
flashy editing and whatnot, but nothing here is as flashy as Boyle's
sometimes surreal work in Trainspotting, and the entire film's look is
appropriately grimy and gritty.</P>
<P>But even with Curtis-Hall's able efforts behind the camera,
Gridlock'd could not have possibly worked without a convincing, charismatic
lead duo, and Shakur and Roth fit the bill perfectly.  Roth has the showier
role, playing pathetic, dirty, and just plain wacky Stretch, and he pulls it
off as well as one expects (even though his natural British accent sometimes
slips into his on-screen New York accent).  Shakur's more sensible Spoon is
the straight man, but he is far from upstaged, holding his own with his
confident, commanding presence; he truly had a bright future in film.  Roth
and Shakur's rapport is so natural, so effortless that you have no problem
believing that they are longtime friends.  It's too bad that a reteaming of
the two is out of the question.</P>
<P>The pileup of films currently released amounts to one big traffic
jam at movie houses, but the entertaining Gridlock'd should have no problem
clearing a path to box office success.<HR></P>
