<PRE>"I'm not a lawyer. I hate lawyers. I just work for 'em."
Erin Brockovich</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>If the poster of Julia, babe in arm, strawberry-pocked halter-top popping
them two assets forward, hardworking blue-collar lips ready to launch a
stream of obscenities from the roughened-heart reminds you of a trashy
Sharon Stone in "Gloria"; fear not. "Erin Brockovich" is a fine production.
In fact, why isn't Julie Roberts on the Academy's list? She's simply
awesome.</P>
<P>A cross between "A Civil Action" and "Howard Stern" in drag, "Erin
Brockovich" graces the screen with the difficult balance of heart, tragedy
and hard-hitting pottie-mouthed humor. In fact, the film's only dips from
divinity occur during a couple of segments that postpone Erin's
lightning-charged tongue. It's her sharp lingua determined to cut though any
BS, which sets fly sparks. Her mouth is as refreshing as an ice cold shower;
it's sure to send hilarious jolts of truth through audiences around the
country.</P>
<P>Divorced twice, raising three kids, one-time Miss Wichita proves that
credentials and high-power suits play second fiddle to heart and brains.
Dressed like one of Charlie's Angles, busty waitress Brockovich and her
mouth take on big corporate lawyers in a case involving a small town's
polluted water supply.</P>
<P>This strong script along with its gritty dialogue still may have fallen
short even with Roberts' lead if not for some great supporting actors.
Albert Finney's patience and expertise complement Roberts' fiery passion.
Aaron Eckhart is both charming and real as love-interest-on-a-Harley.</P>
<P>The story is based on the real life exploits of one Erin Brockovich. If
you're curious to see what she looks like, Erin cameos as a greasy-spoon
waitress during a short segment near the beginning of the picture. In my
particular screening, a handful of viewers greeted her brief appearance with
a clap or two. By the end of the film, this audience of critics gave the
entire production a round of applause.</P>
