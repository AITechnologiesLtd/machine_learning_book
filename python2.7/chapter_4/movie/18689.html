<P>You know, I never really wondered what the Tarzan films would have been
like had Tarzan been an old man.  While watching Instinct, I couldn't
help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the
well-explored themes of those earlier movies.  Even beside the Tarzan
comparison, Instinct just isn't a very good film.  It's painfully
idealistic, manipulative, and silly.  I didn't hate it --  it's simply
impossible for me to hate any film starring Anthony Hopkins;
furthermore, most of the acting is quite good.  But I can recognize
Instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors
involved.  I can also recognize reasons for wanting to make Instinct,
and it's pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a
massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating
movies like Patch Adams.  </P>
<P>Things start off in the predictable way, as director Jon Turtletaub
introduces us to our hero, Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an
ambitious, young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced,
old psychiatrist (Donald Sutherland).  Caulder soon finds himself
involved in the case of his life, the one he thinks will make him
famous.  The subject is Ethan Powell (Hopkins), an anthropologist who
has been living among gorillas in Africa for the past two years.  Powell
has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in Africa, and
it's now Caulder's job to find out of he's mentally competent enough to
stand trial.  Through a series of short sessions, Caulder tries to put
together the complex psyche of Powell.  </P>
<P>Even though it really is an old man version of Tarzan, much of this
central idea is rather interesting.  As I said, Hopkins is captivating
for every second he's on screen; he has a way of convincing us that he's
not acting, that he's actually a man who has just spent two years of his
life living with a family of wild gorillas.  The character himself isn't
very interesting -- he's just an anthropologist who really likes
gorillas -- but Hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in
speech and action.  Gooding Jr. does strong work opposite Hopkins,
playing Caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual.  The
screenplay, written by Gerald Di Pego and "suggested by" a novel by
Daniel Quinn, gives us no background information on Caulder, but that
seems to be the point (he has no time for friends because he's obsessed
with his work).  Nonetheless, these two actors are essentially the
entire list of things that are good about Instinct.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the
best acting.  Turtletaub and Di Pego are both guilty of Instinct's
artistic failure, for they work together to make the dumbest, most
cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live, and
they do so by means of brainless subplots.  First, we have the prison
warden subplot.  The prison warden is evil and wants to stop Caulder's
progress at any cost; if this means taking Caulder off the Powell case,
then that's fine.  There's also the prison guard subplot.  The prison
guard is played by John Ashton; the prison guard seems to enjoy
mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision, and he's
instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion.  Then
there's the daughter subplot, in which Maura Tierney (playing the
daughter) must look very upset a lot of the time; after all, she is the
daughter of a deranged man.</P>
<P>If some of this stuff sounds familiar, that's because they're all
devices that have been used and reused in countless other films.  The
evil doctor in Patch Adams is not unlike the evil warden here.  The
offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar
portrayals in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest had.  Ashton's evil prison
guard pales in comparison to Clancy Brown's in The Shawshank
Redemption.  Hopkins' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of
his turn in The Silence of the Lambs.  And then there's the whole Tarzan
thing, which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire
film.    </P>
<P>Perhaps what irritates me most about Instinct is the half-hearted
attempt at philosophical depth.  The message Powell brings back from the
wild is not a subtle one:  he thinks that humans are "takers," that they
expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas.  I can
sympathize with that, but only when it's in a compelling film.  This is
the kind of stupid movie -- just like Patch Adams -- in which a big
group of characters (psychotic inmates, in this case) rise against the
evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards.  What does any
of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life
with gorillas?  If all the subplots of Instinct had been left on the
cutting room floor, we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior
to the two-hour one that I watched today.  If the central idea had been
developed beyond the Old Man Tarzan premise, then we would really have
had something interesting -- a movie that doesn't rely on the strength
of its actors.</P>
