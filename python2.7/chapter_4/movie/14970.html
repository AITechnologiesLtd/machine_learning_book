<P>   Everyone wants to be happy. But ask Americans what they
would need, realistically, to make them content and I'll bet a
majority would say a house with a white picket fence, and
dog and a couple of clean-cut kids.  This Father-Knows-Best,
Brady-Bunch, Ozzie-and-Harriet utopia is exactly what writer
Gary Ross unfolds in "Pleasantville": just an agreeable little
town that nobody leaves, one which is blissfully ignorant of
what may lie outside or cares to find out.  Who could blame
the people?  There are no graffiti, no drugs, no crime. 
Everyone looks about the same and has similar cultural and
political values.  Life is safe, secure, predictable, with dinner
on the table for all the husbands, wives perfectly content to
avoid the hassles of work and to stay at home, kids cheering
on a basketball team that never loses a game and never
even fails to sink a shot.  You might not expect such a movie
to be much more than a reflection of the predictability and
concomitant drabness of small-town America, but
"Pleasantville" is in fact a wonderfully entertaining work full of
easy-to-swallow social commentary.  It is a testament to the
power of the movies to maneuver the audience that this one
proves today's complex world--filled with AIDS, crime, drug-
addiction, global warming, terrorism, broken homes, and most
of all uncertainty--is to be preferred.  </P>
<P>   The Pleasantville of the title is like a town on Prozac: no
particular worries but then no color either. Photographed
largely in black-and-white to symbolize the placid, even keel
in which the residents live, "Pleasantville" boasts not only
tranquil relationship among its people but perfect climate as
well; as the weatherman reports, the temperature range is 72
high, 72 low, and not a cloud in the sky.</P>
<P>   How do we get to sample the wares?  Just find yourself a
TV repairman with mystical powers, as David (Tobey
Maguire) did one frantic evening as his sister Jennifer (Reese
Witherspoon) prepares for a hot date while David, an expert
on sitcom trivia, fixes to tune the TV to a contest that rewards
the participant with the most knowledge about a television
series called "Pleasantville."  David would likely fit right in
with those Americans who dream of utopia-with a-picket-
fence, as his family life is a mess.  He escapes
psychologically by immersing himself in the show, laughing
with the cornball situations, while chomping on his chips. 
When the remote control unit breaks down just before the
show, he is about to give up hope, but a strange-looking TV
repairman bounces in from the street to offer him a large
replacement for the crushed unit.  Turning on the set to
another episode, he and his sister are transported to the
home of George (William H. Macy) and his wife Betty (Joan
Allen), seamlessly taking the place of their teenaged children,
Bud and Mary Sue.  </P>
<P>   As an expert on the show, David knows exactly what is
going to happen and does not want to upset the stable lives
of the townspeople.  He is pushed to act the missionary from
the volatile world of the 1990's when his sexually active sister
seduces the captain of the basketball team, a tidy-cut fellow
who expect nothing more than hand-holding until he is to
begin going steady with a girl.  David's hands-off attitude
changes when he becomes appalled by the provincialism of
the citizens and is made to feel like a celebrity when he is
cornered everywhere by peers who want to know everything
about the great big world that they scarcely knew existed.  He
develops a particularly poignant relationship with a soda-
fountain waiter, Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels), who is in mortal
fear of doing anything--even preparing a cheeseburger or
shutting the front door--in any manner but the one to which
he is accustomed; and to Betty Parker (Joan Allen) who, as
George's wife does not even know what she is missing until
her "son" David clues her in on the nature of imaginative sex.</P>
<P>   To that point director Gary Ross plays it safe, providing an
amusing comedy with little social gravity.  The second part of
the film--like Robert Benigni's "Life is Beautiful"--turns into
heartfelt social commentary which quite effectively points up
the evils that can result when the powers-that-be are
threatened by changes.  When husbands no longer can be
assured of dinner, when older men and women are
confronted with a frank, artistic exhibitions of nudity
decorating the luncheonette walls, when kids patronize a
library and learn about life on their own, the inflamed men
and women resort to fascist procedures like bookburning,
window-smashing, and overt denigration of all things that
upset their vision of a placid life.</P>
<P>   Ross's cinematic techniques are every bit a match for his
observations on the nature of humanity.  Each time a resident
becomes the slightest bit liberated--when a boy or girl
discovers the joys of sex, when a housewife devoted
exclusively to the care of others begins to find pleasure in her
own body, when a hitherto homespun individual discovers the
beauty of fine painting--they turn from black-and-white to
color, which is Ross's way of approving their willingness to
confront the pluckier aspects of life.  With an implicit nod to
Aristotle and his theory of the golden mean, he even shows
that the sexy, cool Jennifer cannot herself be released from a
black-and-white existence until she develops an attraction for
books, study, and a more placid way of life than that which
she has been customarily devoted.  While Ross gets good
supporting roles from William H. Macy as the man of the
house, Joan Allen as his devoted but ultimately dissatisfied
wife and J.T. Walsh as the leader of a right-wing group
determined to suppress freedom, he is blessed by a grand
work of young Tobey Maguire as a natural leader of a
Babbitt-like community determined to free it from shackles it
never knew it wore.  Psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, whose
masterwork "Escape from Freedom" holds that there is
nothing people fear more than emancipation from their own
manacles, would have loved this marvelously entertaining and
uplifting piece of filmmaking.</P>
