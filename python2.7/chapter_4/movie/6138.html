<P>     A true-crime film that credits a "Heavy Metal Music Consultant?"
Believe it or not, a sparse soundtrack by Metallica is one of the many
pleasures to be partaken in PARADISE LOST: THE CHILD MURDERS AT ROBIN
HOOD HILLS.  This fascinating though overlong documentary from the
makers of BROTHER'S KEEPER recounts the events surrounding the discovery
of three murdered boys in West Memphis, Arkansas, the reaction of their
families, and the resulting trial that convicted three adolescent
outcasts with nary a shred of physical evidence.  Though the details of
the crime-- involving sexual mutilation-- are graphic enough to make
your hair stand on end, the most harrowing portrait of evil is that of
an unforgiving Christian community.  Filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce
Sinofsy, who were given access to anyone and everyone associated with
the trial, take us into the churches, the trailer parks, and, in one
unforgettable sequence, onto the firing range where a grieving father
imagines the suspects as the giant pumpkin he's using for target
practice.  Recommended.  </P>
