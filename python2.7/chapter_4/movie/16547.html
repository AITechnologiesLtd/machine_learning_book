<P>_The Fifth Element_
Directed by Luc Besson. Starring Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman and Mila Jovovich.
Reviewed by Michael Turton.  Three Stars.</P>
<P>_The Fifth Element_ is a sci-fi spectacular combining action, epic and low
humor to create a rich but ultimately flawed tapestry of the future.  It is a
perfect example of the tremendous potential of science fiction, especially
given modern technology, and the continuing inability of mainstream film
directors to grasp this potential.</P>
<P>TFE tells the story of 300 years in the future, when an unlimited evil
awakens and threatens the universe.  A perfect being, the fifth element, is
necessary to combine with earth, air, fire and water to construct a weapon
against this evil.  After a brief and unnecessary prologue, the story opens
with the discovery of the evil being.  Although we are not shown it, it has
already contacted a powerful man named Zorg (Oldman) who is attempting
through his agents to acquire the four stones which represent earth, air,
fire and water and without which the weapon cannot be made.  An alien ship
presumably carrying the stones enters earth space and is destroyed by other
alien mercenaries in the pay of Zorg. Only Lilu (Jovovich), the perfect
being, survives.  Reconstituted at Federation HQ, she escapes and meets
Corbin Dallas (Willis).  Together the two retrieve the stones and save the
world.</P>
<P>The most basic question I have about TFE is "why?"  With so many awesome
stories, an entire century of science fiction for the most part still untold
on the big screen, why would anyone waste their time and money cobbling
together a second-rate heap of cliches into an epic space opera story? 
Underneath the beautiful sets, striking costumes, vast scope, frenetic pace
and first-rate directing is a story that was not exactly begging to be told,
for TFE has all the faults of mainstream handling of science fiction: there
is no character development, aliens exist only to carry out the
destruction/salvation of the world, the social order of earth is pretty much
the same as the one we know now, all aliens are bilaterally-symmetrical
bipeds, the science and technology are completely inconsistent or impossible
, and action is more important than idea.  Compare TFE to any sci-fi work
similar in scope and topic, such as Vernor Vinge's awesome epic _A Fire Upon
the Deep_ or the recently completed _Babylon 5_ TV series, and TFE comes off
badly.</P>
<P>It cannot be argued that TFE is somehow "not sci-fi."  Through numerous nods
to other famous sci-fi flicks, Besson attempted to place TFE squarely in the
sci-fi universe.  For example, Dallas eats at an asian noodle place just
before he gets the news of his mission, just as Deckard did in _Blade
Runner_.  The sequence of shots of the space liner entering Phloston Paradise
mimics the famous scenes of the Pan Am clipper entering the space station in
_2001_.  Leia Organa from Star Wars is neatly skewered in the "cinnamon buns"
hairdo of the battleaxe who was originally intended to go with Corbin Dallas
on his mission to save the universe.  The veteran sci-fi fan will notice
others as well, with _Blade Runner_ the predominant source.</P>
<P>As a movie, TFE is a mixed bag.  The directing is flawless and the pace
furious.  But there is entirely too much sly, self-conscious humor which all
too often disengages the viewer from his or her attempt to believe in the
movie's premise that the universe is desperately in need of saving.  An
entire character, Ruby Rod (Chris Tucker), was added only supply comic
relief.  Besson did not learn the lesson that George Lucas taught, namely:
that in addition to being fast and furious, epics must be completely innocent
and deadly serious.  Besson also forgot that the gods require a sacrifice:
the universe can be redeemed only through the death of the hero.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the costumes, sets and backgrounds are excellent.  The
editing is wonderful and the interposition of three or more separate pieces
of action in a single sequence, done in several places, is extremely
effective. Willis doeshis usual workmanlike job, but sometimes gives the
impression that he is condescending to appear in this role.  Gary Oldman as
the baddie Zorg is (as always) great -- no other actor combines wussiness
with intensity the way he does.</P>
<P>Ultimately, TFE must be regarded as a failure, albeit an entertaining one. 
Next time, I hope Besson decides to tackle a story more worthy of his
powerful talent, such as _The Stars My Destination_ or Niven and Pournelle's
_Inferno_, rather than serve up stale childhood fantasies dressed in the
science fiction equivalent of Sunday clothes.  Until then, TFE will remain a
good rental choice.  I give it *** out of *****.</P>
