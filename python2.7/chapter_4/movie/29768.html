<P>_Two_Can_Play_That_Game_ (R) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>        Any film that opens with its protagonist saying directly to the camera,
"Oh hey!  I didn't see you there!" courts disaster.  That
_Two_Can_Play_That_Game_ turns out to be far from one is less a measure of the
efforts of writer-director Mark Brown than his leading lady, Vivica A. Fox,
whose considerable charms are able to make the film's less appealing qualities
rather tolerable.</P>
<P>        And how fortunate is that, given that two potentially repellent elements
lie front and center in the film.  First is the excessive breaking of the fourth
wall.  Main character Shanté Smith (Fox) directly addresses the camera so
frequently that the audience can be considered another cast member, playing the
best friend/sounding board role.  More problematic is the character of Shanté
herself.  A sexy, successful professional woman, Shanté is also characterized by
a self-confidence that creeps dangerously close to off-putting
arrogance--particularly in the relationship department, which is the focus of
the film.  The ostensible plot has Shanté suspecting her boyfriend Keith Fenton
(Morris Chestnut) of cheating, and the remainder of the film has her outlining
to the audience her allegedly foolproof ten-day plan, which entails lying and
all sorts of psychological manipulation, to get any man in gear.</P>
<P>        Given her penchant for self-centered scheming, Shanté could have easily
come off as an icy bitch.  Yet she never does, and that's a tribute to Fox.  Her
natural warmth and instant likability adds an invaluable layer of sincerity to
the character.  While some of the games she plays seem a bit extreme, Fox's
sympathetic portrayal paints the behavior as more misguided than mean-spirited;
her Shanté may be a little cocky and deluded, but she clearly has her heart in
the right place and does truly love Keith (contributing mightily to the latter
is Fox's convincing chemistry with Chestnut).  As deserved as Shanté's
inevitable comeuppance is, Fox is able to connect with the audience so strongly
that one cannot help but feel for the character when her strategy starts to
backfire.</P>
<P>        But _Two_Can_Play_That_Game_ isn't all about sweet sentiment.  Its
bigger concern is simply fun, and Fox and her equally appealing supporting cast
lend the familiar proceedings a sassy, spunky zing.  Standing out from the pack
are Mo'Nique (as one of Shanté's girlfriends) and Anthony Anderson (as Keith's
co-worker and "coach" in the ways of women), who get the best of Brown's
dialogue in the designated comic relief roles.  _Two_Can_Play_That_Game_ makes
no bones about being as insubstantial and disposable a film as one can find, but
it's a cute little trifle that delivers on the good time it promises.</P>
