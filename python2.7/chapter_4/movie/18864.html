<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>First, writer/director Oliver Parker (Othello) hacked his way through
Shakespeare.  Now he's back, fumbling through another revered old dead
white guy, Oscar Wilde.  The film is well-cast and wonderfully acted,
but never really generates much too much excitement.</P>
<P>Based on Wilde's stage play, the film is set in late 1890s England and
focuses on Lord Arthur Goring (Rupert Everett, My Best Friend's
Wedding).  Goring is a wealthy bachelor, in love with himself much more
than any of his female conquests.  His world is shaken up a bit when
Laura Cheveley (Julianne Moore, Cookie's Fortune) comes to town and
throws a wrench into the tightly knit upper crust of London.</P>
<P>Cheveley's visitation coincides with the important vote on an Argentine
canal scheme.  Her goal is to blackmail key swing vote Sir Robert
Chiltern (Jeremy Northam, The Winslow Boy) and protect her sizeable
investment.  Although Chiltern is now happily married to Lady Gertrud
(Cate Blanchett, Elizabeth), his past indiscretions are known to
Cheveley and have him on the ropes.</P>
<P>Chiltern also has a sister named Mabel (Minnie Driver, Good Will
Hunting) that has been chasing after Goring for years.  Only a fool
couldn't see that these two would hook up by the end of the film.  Their
coupling is temporarily delayed by Cheveley's Cheshire-cat smile and
evil extortion plans, which are strangely wrapped up in about 60 minutes
when she disappears, tail between her legs.  The film then takes another
30 minutes to sew up all of the loose ends.  This is far too long an
ending for a film this short and is surely the sign of a troubled
filming and editing room cover-up.</P>
<P>Thankfully it is this short.  Goring's lecherous,
almost-under-his-breath ramblings grow tiresome after Cheveley's
departure, but his bickering with Papa Goring does get better as the
film progresses.  Northam's Chiltern is a slightly whipped (read:
married) version of his superior performance as Robert Morton in The
Winslow Boy.  Husband looks great due to the production and costume
design that brought us Emma and The Governess, and was lushly lensed by
David Johnson (Hilary & Jackie).  (1:36 – PG for adult situations)</P>
