<PRE>THE MASK OF ZORRO
Reviewed by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<P>Cast: Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stuart
Wilson, Matt Letscher
Director: Martin Campbell
Screenplay: John Eskow and Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio</P>
<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 stars</P>
<P>There are old films, and then there are films that capture the spirit of
decades ago perfectly.  The Mask of Zorro is one of these; it is
spellbinding and old fashioned, containing every element of a
traditional superhero film.  It is how these elements are balanced by
director Martin Campbell that makes Zorro a non-stop feast for the
senses, and the clever handling of its script makes it one of the
unexpected highlights of 1998.</P>
<P>Colombia Tri-Star delayed the release of Zorro for well over a year,
allegedly due to the success of Titanic.  I don't see why, since this
film is better than blockbusters Godzilla and Armageddon put together,
and I haven't been this mesmerized by a purebred action flick since John
Woo's Face/Off in 1997.  Much of the credit goes to Martin Campbell, who
made 1995's Goldeneye - one of the best James Bond films ever.  Campbell
refrains from using crafty camera angles and excessive special effects;
instead he focuses on genuine, exciting action.  The result is breath
taking.  Zorro's many sword fights are captured incredibly on screen,
with clashes and clangs bringing hoots and thrills from the audience.</P>
<P>Anothony Hopkins plays Don Diego de la Vega, an elderly Zorro, who is a
masked hero that fights for the people of Mexico.  After a plight to
save innocent peasants,
Don Diego's archenemy Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson) captures and
imprisons him, and forcefully adopts his daughter Elena (Catherine Zeta
Jones) and raises her as his own. Two decades later Mexico has still not
forgotten the legend of Zorro, but when Don Diego escapes from jail, he
realizes he is far too old to continue the never-ending fight for
independence and justice.  Enter Alejandro Murieta (Antonio Banderas), a
bandit who suffers from the death of his brother at the hands of Captain
Harrison Love (Matt Letscher).  Don Diego transforms Murieta into the
new Zorro, and teaches him that the best way to avenge his brother's
death is to live to celebrate it.</P>
<P>Campbell balances the spectacular action with drama and comedy, and the
mixture is always entertaining.  Whilst Murieta learns how to sword
fight, he also learns how to be a gentlemen, and that revenge can often
lead to good things.  In one of the film's touching moments, the primary
meaning behind wearing a black mask is revealed, and Murieta learns that
not only does the mask hide his identity, it also hides his hatred.</P>
<P>Few actors can maintain a respectable presence while working with
Anthony Hopkins, one of the true masters of American cinema.  He gives
power, presence and experience to his roles and is a lifeboat for many
movies.  Hopkins saved Amistad from being a total disaster, and is still
remembered for his difficult (and Oscar winning) part in Silence of the
Lambs.  However as the young Zorro, Antonio Banderas almost steals the
show, with a sparkling and exciting performance that is almost always on
cue (though sometimes he seems all too aware of his heroic guise).  The
beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones is charming in her first film role, and
the sexual chemistry between her and Banderas is successfully steamy.</P>
<P>The key to how very gratifying The Mask of Zorro is lies in Campbell's
mixture and pace of plot elements.  With a running time of 137 minutes,
he paces the story slowly and allows setting and character to be
developed at a comfortable speed.  How he achieved that without making
one boring moment is quite amazing, but Zorro has more immediate
benefits than just a pleasing atmosphere.  This celebrated tale is told
with pizzazz and artistry, and never pretends to be anything more than
it is - an old fashioned tale of love, hatred, devotion and revenge.
The Mask of Zorro has all the spectacle of an epic, and all the heart of
a classic tale that will never be outdated.</P>
