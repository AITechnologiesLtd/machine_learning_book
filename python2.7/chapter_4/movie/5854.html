<PRE>                               BY THE SWORD
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1996 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>(1991) ** - C:Eric Roberts, F. Murray Abraham, Mia Sara.</P>
<P>Finally, a movie about the exciting sport of fencing! Fencing? Swordfighting
without any of the danger? Oh boy.</P>
<P>Eric Roberts stars as a fencing instructor, a former olympic fencing
champion who retired from competition undefeated. His class that he
instructs in the film includes all the standard type characters for this
kind of film: the cocky guy, the sensitive guy, the girl who wants to prove
she's more than a girl, etc. These characters just end up as scenery,
however, as the main plot revolves around the school's janitor (Abraham).</P>
<P>In the film's opening scenes, Abraham comes to Roberts and asks if there are
any teaching positions open. Roberts quickly tests his skills, laughs, and
offers him a position as a janitor. Abraham, humiliated, takes the job.</P>
<P>Later, we learn that Roberts' father was also a great champion fencer, and
was killed in a duel over a woman many years earlier. Moments after, we
learn that Abraham has just been released from jail after serving a sentence
for murder. Hmmm, I wonder if there's a connection there? I wonder...</P>
<P>The film really goes nowhere for a while, and then leads up to the
inevitable "revelation" and climatic sword fight. The duel itself is well
staged, but the purpose of it seems a bit ridiculous. With some minor script
changes, however, the sword fight could have had much more relevance.
Roberts, who appears to be doing his own fencing, does a good job with his
character.</P>
