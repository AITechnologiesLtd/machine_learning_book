<P>Johnny Depp is a great looking man. In fact, gun forced to my head, I would
absolutely "do the man" without any qualms, despite the fact that I do not
naturally swing that way. Charlize Theron...beautiful woman. Reminds me a
little of Mrs. JoBlo, as a matter of fact. Both pretty good actors in their
own right, with Depp certainly racking up a diverse repertoire of parts. Oh,
the movie, you say? Well, it's not good.</P>
<P>PLOT:
An astronaut loses contact with earth for two minutes while floating around
in space. Upon his return, his wife and others notice that he has become
somewhat "different". Over time, we begin to suspect that an
extraterrestrial may be inside the poor bastard.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
What can I say...this movie's trailer wins the annual award for "The Best
Trailer Giving Away Everything, And I Do Mean, Everything, That Is Going To
Happen In A Movie!" (With DOUBLE JEOPARDY finishing a close second!). It's
unfortunate because there may have been a couple of things that would have
surprised me otherwise, but I guess the marketing geniuses at New Line
Cinema figured that it would be more beneficial for people to know EXACTLY
what is going to happen in the film, without even seeing it!? Good move,
guys. That aside, the film is not a horrible watch, in fact Depp and Theron
certainly pull out some decent performances, with Depp hamming it up via his
Elvis accent, and the blonde streaks in his hair. Theron's role seemed
similar to her role in the much better DEVIL'S ADVOCATE (8/10) film, with
her deteriorating over time, and crying a lot. Having said that, she does it
very well, and she sure is nice to look at. The story of this film seemed
ambitious, but unfortunately for us, it basically goes nowhere. In fact,
count yourself lucky if you haven't seen the preview of this film, for you
will not have seen 95% of the movie like the rest of us.</P>
<P>The film itself plods along at a pretty slow pace, doesn't offer any real
tension or intrigue (Just a couple of "easy scare" scenes with people
popping out of nowhere), and is choked with plot holes. In fact, we never
really know why the extraterrestrial has come to earth, what his plans are,
or how Depp seems to show up every time that something that he doesn't like
is happening. The ending is also very stupid, with a twist which I
personally could have done without. And if you're grooving to see this movie
because of any special effects, forget about it right now, there are
probably more in DUDLEY DO-RIGHT. All in all, this movie is not a horrible
movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it's basically just "there". If
you like the two main actors, or love watching really great looking people
get paid millions of dollars to act on the big screen while you pay for
their kid's tuition, then by all means, go see this movie. Otherwise, wait
for it on video, sit around and watch it with your drunk friends, and have a
blast making fun of all the gaping holes in the script.</P>
<P>Either that, or try to figure out which of the two actors is the prettier?
Depp or Theron? Theron or Depp? Or try your luck at our Johnny Depp Movie
Trivia Quiz (<A HREF="http://www.joblo.com/youdontknowshiteaboutmovies21.htm">http://www.joblo.com/youdontknowshiteaboutmovies21.htm</A>). <Cheap
plug, but I'm willing to admit it! :)></P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Charlize Theron's mother killed her father with a gun one night, after he
got drunk and began abusing her again. The mother was charged, but received
not time in jail, after she was found to have been acting in "self-defense".
The father had apparently been an abusive husband for years on end. Charlize
was 10 years old at the time. He was French, she is of German heritage.
Charlize was born and grew up in South Africa, where she is now doing TV
promos against rape.
At the age of 18, Charlize's mom convinced her to go Los Angeles to try a
career in the movie industry. She came to LA without knowing anyone in the
city but after two weeks when she was standing in line on Hollywood
Boulevard an agent gave her his card. After eight months in LA, she got her
first part.
Johnny Depp has dated several young starlets in Hollywood including Winona
Ryder, Sherilyn Fenn,  Jennifer Grey (pre-nose operation which changed who
she was!), Kate Moss and actress/singer Vanessa Paradis from France. He most
recently sired a child from Paradis. It was a daughter whom they named
Lily-Rose Melody Depp. He likes to call himself "Mr. Stench".
Johnny's full name is John Christopher Depp III. He was born in Kentucky and
has been featured
on a rock album from the British band, Oasis. Depp played lead slide guitar
on the track, "Fade In-Out", after Oasis' own lead guitarist was too drunk
to perform it himself. Depp stepped in and nailed the lead on one take.
This is director Rand Radish's directorial film debut. He was known
previously as a writer, having written the screenplays for such films as
CANDYMAN 2: FAREWELL TO THE FLESH and THE MAKER.
The two twins in this film are played by Cole and Dylan Sprouse, the same
kids who played the one character of Julian in this summer's other comedy
BIG DADDY (7/10).
Actress Clea DuVall has no relation to great actor Robert Duvall. Her full
name is Clea Helen D'etienne DuVall.</P>
