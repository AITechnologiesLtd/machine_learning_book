<PRE>                                  HE GOT GAME</PRE>
<P>Denzel Washington gives the performance of his life in this superb
film.   His speech, that of an inner city resident; his Afro and
beard; his one-on-one basketball playing with his son, and in every
scene throughout this excellent film, Washington is outstanding.  He
has always given fine performances in the many varied roles he has
played but this film takes him to new heights.</P>
<P>Jake Shuttlesworth (Washington) is in jail for having killed his
wife. In an argument with his young son when he threatens to punish
him, his wife tries to stop him.  When he shoves her away she
accidentally hits her head on the stove and dies.</P>
<P>Jake's used to teach his son everything he knew about basketball.
Jake played well but not quite well enough to be a pro.  When the
son, Jesus (Ray Allen who played as a guard for the Milwaukee Bucks
and in the NBA  Rookie All-Star game and who here makes his acting
debut) shows promise, he keeps after him, after him every moment,
toughening him, hoping the son will make it for the family, the only
way out of poverty or near poverty in a way that Jake has never able
to do..   Many blacks dream that same dream but of course a
minuscule number ever makes it big time.</P>
<P>HE GOT GAME is filled with The Right Stuff.   While Jake is in
prison, Warden Wyatt (Ned Beatty) offers him a deal:  The Governor,
a great basketball fan and an alumnus of Big State, is ready to
offer to commute Jake's sentence if he can get his number one-rated
son to sign a Letter Of Intent to go to Big State.    Gorgeous women
from various universities let Jesus know that they are ready to go
to bed with him if he signs up . . . and several already do. Agents
are ready to give him cars whose stereo system costs $35,000 and
there is more where that came from if he will allow them to manage
him. Poor Jesus, from a poverty family, has to use all his inner
strength to ward them off.   And then Jake appears to beg  him to go
to Big State, letting him know that if Jesus does not sign with Big
State, his father will be returned to jail.   HE GOT GAME lets us
know that basketball is Big Business.</P>
<P>Big Time Willie (Roger Guenveur Smith) does a bang up job with his
role as a gambler, pimp, and drug dealer as he tries to warn Jesus
(and the young blacks in the theater watching the movie)  about all
the temptations and why they should be strong and stay on the
straight and narrow.</P>
<P>Lastly, the film shows the problems blacks have with whites who
promise but who are not to be trusted.   HE GOT GAME covers a big
court.    The beautiful photography of the basketball does not keep
us from realizing this movie's ball is bouncing everywhere.  Music,
by Aaron Copland and others greatly enhance the film.</P>
<P>Jesus' "bodyguard" and friend is "Booger" (Hill Harper).  The
sister, Mary, whom Jesus looks after, is Zelda Harris.   Other
supporting  roles are played by Milla Jovich, Bill Nunn,  Jim Brown,
the lovely Rosario Dawson as Jesus' girlfriend, and Lonette McKee as
Jake's wife.</P>
