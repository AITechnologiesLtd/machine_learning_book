<PRE>                         The "Oh, God!" Trilogy

<PRE>OH, GOD! (1977) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Oh, God, is OH, GOD funny. Sorry, I just wanted to say that. 
It's not keel-over-and-compulsively-slap-your-knee funny, but it is a 
good 70's comedy, with George Burns playing God. Geez, I know the 
guy's old, but he doesn't really pass for seven trillion. God visits John 
Denver, who plays a supermarket manager (who keeps the Grape Nuts 
well stocked). And who knows, Denver may work in a supermarket 
today--as a bag boy, of course.</P>
<P>        God tells Denver to spread his word (through his magical 
talent of folk music... Yeah, right!) and Denver is in no position to 
decline. Naturally, the world at large thinks he's crazy (for recording 
that stupid "Annie's Song" crap), but at least the movie's soundtrack is 
pretty good. You should hear John Denver sing "Thank George Burns 
I'm a Country Boy."</P>
<P>        This movie was followed by two sequels, and I hear there are 
plans in the works for another one, with Burns as God, Jerry Lewis as 
Jesus and Bob Hope as the Holy Spirit. OH, GOD! also has it's share 
of rip-off imitators, including OH, SHIT! OH, HELL! and, of course, 
OH-KLAHOMA!.</P>
<PRE>Oh, God! Book II (1980) *1/2</PRE>
<P>        Oh, God, not another OH, GOD! movie."Book II gets a 
half-star for leaving John Denver out of the proceedings, but that's 
about the only good news this time around. George "God" Burns still 
seems kind of God-like, only slightly older. Here, he comes back to 
earth and reveals himself to an eleven year-old girl (you know what I 
mean!), telling her to come up with a good advertising slogan for Him.</P>
<P>        Apparently, "turn or burn" isn't good enough, so the girl 
abandons her studies to think up a good God slogan. She finally comes 
up with one--"Think God"--and Burns encourages her to plaster the 
slogan on every wall, sidewalk and bald head in town, an act which 
soon gets her thrown out of school. Soon, her parents are convinced 
she's crazy, and a panel of psychologists is faced with the decision of 
whether or not to put the girl in a padded cell next to the OH, GOD! 
BOOK II script-writers, in an ending paralleling the first OH, GOD! 
In fact, this whole sequel is a needlessly mundane retread of the first 
one. God never changes, I guess.</P>
<P>        You'd have more fun memorizing the Book of Numbers than 
watching this dismal movie.</P>
<PRE>OH, GOD! YOU DEVIL (1984) **1/2</PRE>
<P>        Oh, God, that devil George Burns is at it again in this third 
movie in the OH, GOD! series, featuring George Burns as God of the 
Codgers once again. The twist is that this time Burns also plays the 
hairy host of hell, so now the producers are telling us God and the 
Devil both look like a cigar-smoking old man (forget that "angel of 
light" business). There goes my hope of a pleasant afterlife.</P>
<P>        The devil, in the guise of a recording agent (what are they 
trying to tell us here?), offers a struggling musician (Huey Lewis) a 
sure chance at super-stardom for seven years (Why they didn't make it 
six years, I'll never know.) in exchange for--you guessed it--his 
immortal soul, which reminds me, I have to call back that publisher 
who offered me $2 million for this book in exchange for a minor 
payment to be made at a later date. What was his name? Oh yeah. 
B.L. Zebub.</P>
<P>        The musician immediately assumes the identity of the biggest 
rock star in the world (that "hee-hee" guy), while someone else takes 
his previous life ("I'd sell my soul to be a struggling musician"). The 
musician soon learns carefree sex every night isn't all it's cracked up to 
be (especially if it's with George Burns) and tries to get his old life 
back. That's where God comes in, to play a climactic game of poker 
with the devil over everyone in the world's souls. Needless to say, the 
theology in OH, GOD! YOU DEVIL, as in the other OH, GOD! 
movies, is somewhat lacking, but this movie is a definite improvement 
over the dreadful BOOK II, which God Himself couldn't have saved. 
But that's what happens when you take George Burns' name in vain.</P>
