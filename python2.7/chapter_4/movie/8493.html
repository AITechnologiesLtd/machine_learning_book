<PRE>                         CONSPIRACY THEORY 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast:  Mel Gibson, Julia Roberts, Patrick Stewart. Screenplay:  Brian
Helgeland. Producers:  Joel Silver and Richard Donner. Director:
Richard Donner.</P>
<PRE>How's this for a conspiracy?</PRE>
<P>    "China's title of 'Most Favoured Nation' is in truth a joint effort
between the US and Chinese governments to bring about the economic
down fall of the industrial giant Japan. If this joint trade assault
fails, there is always Plan B devised by the Brits - the actual invasion
and take-over of the Japanese country itself. The hand over of Hong Kong
to China is nothing more than a ruse; the first step of many toward a
pre-planned invasion of the Japanese mainland. If this fails there is
always Plan C. The landing on Mars is not an expedition of discovery
into the unknown, it is in fact a cover for a much more sinister
project, code named 'Death Star': in which the Americans are developing
a top secret, deadly laser array on the far side of the moon. When
complete, Japan and then the rest of the world will be subjugated to the
tyranny of the Americans or become completely eradicated.
    Lastly, I'm not really Timothy Mark Voon, I am in truth Stephen
Graham the moderator of this Newsgroup. I see and know all. Remember
'Big Brother' is watching you this very moment."</P>
<P>  From "The Conspiracy Theory Issue 6 vol 5" by TMT Voon.</P>
<P>If we watch enough TV, read enough newspapers, anyone can come up with a
conspiracy theory. Most of it will be nonsense. Ever heard of the
'African-Korean Conspiracy Of Body Organ Theft', or the 'Jewish
Psychiatrist Conspiracy of Selling Christ'? Mind boggling, but I've
actually come across these conspiracies first hand from people who
actually believe them! It just happens, that in this movie a
particularly incredulous conspiracy - 'The Conspiracy of Government
Funded, Mind Controlled Serial Killers' happens to be true. The question
then is what does one do about it?</P>
<P>A very mature Julia Roberts plays an intelligent district attorney of
the justice department, whose father has recently been murdered. A very
confused, mumbling, paranoid Mel Gibson is a taxi driver who has
conspiracies for every known news subject, and lives in an apartment
where everything is under lock and key - including the combination
locked coffee beans in the refrigerator. When Mel's life comes under
threat as a result of issuing several copies of his conspiracy theories
to his subscribers, Jules is dragged into helping this raving lunatic
Mel, but does she believe him?</P>
<P>With what can be described as a slow start to a movie, the plot slowly
grows in momentum until it reaches a satisfactory end. It is a long sit,
but the director has wisely chosen not to cut corners, thus the longer
footage, but at least the events remain comprehensible to the viewer. A
very original concept for a movie, but sadly to say Mel Gibson is
slightly out of place as the obsessive news reading, paranoid, mentally
unbalanced taxi driver; whose acting can be described as a cross between
his roles as the insane, over the top detective in 'Lethal Weapon', and
the mentally handicapped grown-up in 'Tim'. However, Julia Roberts seems
to be at peace with herself as she calmly and confidently accepts her
role as a smart lawyer, with thoughts of that 'Pretty Woman' far behind
her.</P>
<P>Comment: A satisfactory conspiracy theory.</P>
<P>Conspiracy Feel Scale:
0% Elvis Lives / *THE CONSPIRACY THEORY * / The Second Coming 100%</P>
