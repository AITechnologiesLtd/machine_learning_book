<P>   In "Macbeth" Act V, Shakespeare says that "life...is a tale
told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing." 
Josh Aronson's documentary, by analogy, is full of sound and
fury but signifies...literally.  "Sound and Fury," which gets its
name from the Shakespearean quote, is about the
controversy aroused by a fairly new technique known as
cochlear implants--which can enable deaf people to hear. 
For some characters in this picture, signifying, i.e. sign
language, replaces sound, while for others who want to hold
on to this form of communication and their opponents alike,
fury reigns.  Aronson's documentary, which deals not so
much with the technical aspects of cochlear implants, focuses
strongly on the emotional frenzy that this fairly new technique
has engendered and is the sort of documentary that the
"talking-heads" school of filmmakers should copy.  Avoiding
the procedure used by most documentarians, an approach
that embraces a deadly-dull series of interviews, Aronson
pumps us the drama by having his subjects actively engage
each other in what is a virtual knock-down, drag-out battle
over an issue that most of us had probably never before
considered to be controversial.</P>
<P>   That issue is this: imagine that you and your wife have
been deaf since birth.  You have a baby daughter who is also
born deaf and whom you support with a good job with a Wall
Street firm.  While you get along with your fellow executives
who are all hearing people, outside of work you have
socialized almost exclusively with deaf people with whom you
communicate by sign language.  You have no idea what
"music" means, you appreciate the beauty of a rainstorm
though you do not hear the pitter-patter of the drops or even
the loud claps of thunder.  Essentially you are part of--and
cherish--an entire culture separate from the hearing majority. 
You precocious daughter has picked up sign language and
seems happy enough.  </P>
<P>  Along comes a new technology, the cochlear implant, which
is a device implanted with invasive surgery into the hearing
canal and which can restore with reasonable accuracy your
child's ability to hear and, with the help of intensive speech
therapy, to speak normally.  Would you spring for the surgery
if you had the money and wanted only the best for your
child?</P>
<P>   Sounds like a no-brainer, doesn't it?  Handicapped kid
restored to the healthy world through a miraculous device? 
Not at all.  The fury of two parents in particular, Peter Artinian
and his wife Nita, will expose you to a subject that you never
would imagine to be controversial.  Peter does not want his
five-year-old daughter Heather to have the operation.  Why? 
Is it because he feels that the device implanted in the ear
with a correlative contraption hanging outside will make her
look freakish?  Is it because he fears that the operation will
be unsuccessful and could somehow damange Heather even
further?  Not at all.  Peter actually embraces his condition--
which he obviously does not consider a handicap.  He
argues, usually vociferously if that's the word we can use with
one who does not hear or speak, that he is part of a valuable
culture that he does not want his daughter to lose.  When
Peter's mother argues that her granddaughter should indeed
undergo the surgery, virtually calling her own son a child
abuser, Peter is shocked.  He had not known that his own
mother refuses to accept deafness as a feature to be
embraced rather than treated as a woeful handicap.</P>
<P>   Complementing the sound and fury of Peter and his mother
is the story of Peter's hearing brother, Chris, whose little boy
has been born deaf.  Chris wants his infant son to undergo
the surgery and he is supported strongly by his wife, Emily. 
Aronson opens up his film to bring in an array of people from
outside the extended family, including members of an
excellent school for the deaf in Maryland (where Peter, Nita
and Heather are going to move so that they can immerse
themselves totally into the culture of the deaf), doctors and
support personnel in the field of otolaryngology, and an
expanded community of deaf people who eschew changing
their ways.</P>
<P>   The documentary is awesome not only because Aronson
bypasses the usual talking-heads syndrome but because he
follows these people around and makes their regular
argumentation seem to be actually happening as though they
were not acting in front of a camera.  He even captures part
of an actual operation that took place on Chris's infant.  And
when a documentary makes a spectator want to jump out of
his seat and throw tomatoes at some of the performers, you
know that the film maker has captured the imagination of the
audience.  I sat in my seat dumbfounded and appalled at this
huge Luddite of a man who would veto this miraculous
surgery for his gifted daughter (and brainwash her into liking
her present, deaf condition) knowing that this is not the kind
of decision that the kid should make later when she is of age. 
The operation simply cannot wait that long.  Only when the
hospital can implant the device on a very young child does it
work well.  Wait until adulthood and you will have perhaps a
20% success rate, furnishing patients who will be able to hear
only muffled sound.  This guy Peter in my mind is analogous
to a Jehovah's witness who denies his infant a blood
transfusion that would save his life.  </P>
<P>   I can understand perfectly the view of a Chinese-American
parent who fears that his son is becoming too Americanized--
that the kid will refuse to speak or even learn Chinese, will
eschew garlic shrimp in black bean sauce in favor of a bland
McDonald cheeseburger, and will become as undisciplined as
the hoods in his local public school.  But I cannot for the life
of me fathom the concept that it's not only good to be deaf
but that given the opportunity to give your son or daughter
the power to hear, you would deny this technology to your
loved one.  When those who oppose Peter and Nita's
decision are given time to express their views, I felt like
leaping up in my seat and shouting, "Hear, Hear!"  Ultimately
the emotions that Aronson evokes in his audience are what
make this film a must-hear.</P>
