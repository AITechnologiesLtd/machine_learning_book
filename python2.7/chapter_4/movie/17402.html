<P>The summer she killed her father, Eve was 10 years old – or at least, that's
what Eve believes as she laconically states in the opening and closing of
Eve's Bayou. The audience, however, gets the feeling that the truth is far
more complex. To dissect Kasi Lemmons' gorgeous directorial debut through
the validation of its presumed truths would be irreverent to the rich
tapestry woven by Lemmons. However, as the film is oft-times enigmatic in
its lyric, a thoughtful examination of the role of truth in Eve's Bayou may
lend a hand at elucidating Lemmons' intentions. Eve's Bayou is about ‘the
selection of images' and the awareness that reality may elude the images we
select as truths.</P>
<P>In the opening shot of Eve's Bayou, the film starts in black and white and
turns to color as Eve's voice-over ends and the film's story begins. The
black and white sequence corresponds to Eve's telling of the Baptistes' and
her own past. As Eve's narrative ends and the film turns to color, the
audience is left with the question of who is now telling the story. Are we
seeing Eve's recollection of her own ‘selection of images' or are we
watching the events being objectively told by Lemmons? In a film where there
are different sides to every story, the question of reliable narration plays
a role in how we come to understand it. As expected, the answer to who is
telling the story in Eve's Bayou is also ambiguous. There are some scenes,
though few, where Eve is not present, which would indicate that Eve may not
be telling the story, or at least in the capacity of sole narrator. On the
other hand, Eve possesses to some degree Mozelle's clairvoyance and the
possibility that Eve's mother telling her what Eve didn't know is also quite
possible.</P>
<P>Our best indication, then, may lie in the opening scene. There are two items
in particular that I find interesting in the sequence. One is the image of
Eve – not the one played by Jurnee Smollett, but the very first Eve Baptiste
as told in the opening narrative. She is standing at the edge of the bayou
looking into her reflection in the water, right before the camera pans into
color. The other item of interest is the transition into color itself, and
the fact that it is achieved not by a fade or dissolve or traditional cut,
but through what seems to be a matte with black and white on one side of a
tree trunk and color on the other. This invisible cut reinforces the
continuity of location while at the same time clearly indicating a temporal
change. Complemented by the image of the first Eve Baptiste gazing into the
water as it changes to color offers explanation to who is telling the story
of Eve's Bayou. It is neither completely a pastiche of recollections of
Louis Baptiste's daughter, nor is the story told entirely through the
objective eye of the director. The story of Eve's Bayou is told through the
Bayou itself and this is implied by the double-entendre of the bayou's name.
Which Eve is the Eve of Eve's Bayou? Both women gaze into the bayou and in
its reflection find a piece of the Baptiste story.</P>
<P>Reflections play an important role in Eve's Bayou. Not only does the movie
begin with a reflection of Eve, but the movie ends with the reflection of
the descendants of Eve reflected in the Bayou. Though the use of mirrors as
a symbol of duality has been discussed in film analyses to the point of
becoming a cinematic cliché, I feel I must discuss Kasi Lemmons' extensive
use of mirrors in Eve's Bayou because reflections play an important role in
a movie whose verisimilitude lies below the surface. Take, for instance, the
scene where Eve tells Cisely that she saw their father with Mrs. Mereaux.
While Eve is describing her father's indiscretion, we see Cisely both facing
Eve and reflected in the mirror as she desperately tries to make sense of
what she is hearing. Through the use of the mirror, Lemmons presents the
dichotomy between the Cisely who wants to believe that her father is
faithful and the Cisely that believes Eve. We find that Cisely is unable to
decide how to view her father – perhaps she sees him as a womanizer, as she
tells Eve later that she believed her all along; or, she may believe that
her mother doesn't really love her father, and forgivingly views him as
feeling unloved. This indeed is the confusion that will foreshadow the
tragic miscommunication that occurs near the end of the film.</P>
<P>So what really happens the night Cisely goes down to comfort his father? Was
it Cisely who kisses his father not as a daughter but as a woman, or was it
Louis, who kisses his daughter not as a father but as a lover? Just as our
preceding examination of the story's narration yielded not some absolute
answer, but a variegate one, we can be assured that Lemmons will not be so
conspicuous as to offer an easy explanation to the night's events. On the
other hand, Eve's Bayou is not cinema verite, and there is no presumption
that the truth needs to be presented explicitly. Nonetheless, I feel Lemmons
suggests, again through the use of mirrors, that perhaps Louis'
interpretation of events as written in his letter to Mozelle is correct. In
the scene, when Cisely sits on her father's lap and leans over to kiss him,
we see part of her body reflected in the mirror while Louis is not. Had the
mirror reflected them both, we might have said that both were willing
partners in the act and the mirror reflected the duality between
father/daughter and secret lovers. Lemmons, however, deliberately cuts off
the reflection in this scene so that only Cisely is reflected to show that
it is Cisely, who in an attempt to substitute for her mother's absent love,
expresses love in a way that crosses acceptable boundaries.</P>
<P>Returning to the ideas posed in the introduction, is there anything in Eve's
Bayou that can be construed as absolute and with the efficiency and
confidence of Eve's opening narrative? There is, and it is none other than
Eve's words that open and close the film. `The summer I killed my father I
was ten years old.' Lemmons makes this lucid in the scene where Eve meets
Mr. Mereaux in the market. At first, Eve asks Mr. Mereaux about Mrs.
Mereaux, but goes no further. She asks where the apples are and there is a
shot of her walking up to the apple cart, stopping in front of the cart and
pondering the apples, and then turning around to intimate to Mr. Mereaux her
father's affair with Mrs. Mereaux. Through the reference to the biblical
Eve, Lemmons conspicuously makes the argument that it is indeed Eve who
kills her father. The apples, which are metonymic with temptation, drive Eve
to sin against her father. Yet even in this observation, Lemmons is able to
create some ambiguity, for even though she talks to Mr. Mereaux right after
looking at the apples, she also summons the powers of Elzora in the same
scene. Was it Elzora or Mr. Mereaux who kills Louis Baptiste? If Eve was the
catalyst for her father's death, could not Elzora carry out Eve's wishes
through Mr. Mereaux? This is a thoughtful question posed by Lemmons and our
interpretation likely depends on whether we are romantically or
pragmatically inclined.</P>
<P>Eve's Bayou is not a film with simply stated truths; even when we seem to
find an answer, Lemmons turns the answer to a question. Eve seems to be
narrating the movie, or is she? Louis takes advantage of his daughter's
adoration, or does he? Through Lemmons' inspired use of her camera, we may
glean a few explanations for ourselves so that we may feel some comfort in
our ability to comprehend. Certainly I have tried to do so in writing this
essay. At the same time, however, I would allude to Peter Weir's Picnic at
Hanging Rock as a reminder that some ideas are ultimately ineffable and the
search for definitive truth is made both in vain and vanity. Eve's Bayou
transcends the need for simple answers as Lemmons carefully leaves its
meaning open to interpretation. Life is not of black and white, and the
story of Eve's Bayou lies within the immutable grays that romance our
subjective interpretations of truth.</P>
