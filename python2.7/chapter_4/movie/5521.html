<PRE>                            MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE
                       A film review by Lewis Butler
                        Copyright 1995 Lewis Butler</PRE>
<PRE>        In Short:  A well crafted movie that doesn't hold your hand
        through the intricate maneuvers of the the plot.  Tom Cruise
        plays the invisible agent type very well.  A solid +1.5 on the
        ol' -4/+4 scale.</PRE>
<P>Mission Impossible is a good movie that has been taking a lot of critical
hits from people who seem to have been expecting DIE HARD IV meets
GOLDENEYE.  MISSION IMPOSSIBLE is not that kind of movie.  What this movie
does is present a fairly intelligent plot that is highly detailed and makes
the horrible mistake (for a summer movie hopping to be a blockbuster) of
not spoon feeding every plot point to the audience.</P>
<P>There are no stupid pauses in the action to explain what's going on,
there's no extra effort made to guide the audience along with the gizmos
and gadgets.  The movie shows you what is happening, and then expects you
to be able to figure out the details.</P>
<P>There is a wonderful sequence towards the middle of the film that sold me.
Tom Cruise is talking to character A about the possibility of Character B
being a mole.  The entire time he's engaged in this conversation, Cruise
keeps flashing to a sequence on how Character A could have been the mole.
The juxtaposition of the converstation against what we see Cruise thinking
is a brilliant, and effective, device.  However, I could hear the
grumblings in the audience, they didn't seem to understand what was going
on.</P>
<P>Tom Cruise fits into the role of a spy very well.  He has a certain
presence on the screen that makes him quite believable.</P>
<P>There is, as there always seems to be with the special effects wonders of
recent years, a certain amount of suspension of belief.  One sequence in
particular has Cruise surviving an explosion when he is thrown by the
explosion onto the roof of a moving train.  Hollywodd seems to have decided
on several conventions in action films that boggle the mind:  cars have no
trouble driving through security gates (why anyone would build a security
gate that a car can drive through remains unanswered); explosions throw
heroes clear and kill villains; guns are highly inaccurate weapons; and
there are others, of course.  Still, those "mistakes" are so established in
the genre that they've become conventions.  The audience expects them.</P>
