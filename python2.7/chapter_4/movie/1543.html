<PRE>                                HONEYMOON IN VEGAS
                       A film review by Roger Snappy Rubio
                        Copyright 1992 Roger Snappy Rubio</PRE>
<P>Starring Nicholas Cage, Sarah Jessica Parker, James Caan, Pat Morita
Directed by Andrew Bergman</P>
<P>     All in all, a pretty solid piece of comic celluloid.  HONEYMOON IN
VEGAS is the latest flick from the man who brought you THE FRESHMAN.  In
this movie, Bergman throws in one bride, two grooms, and the outrageous
claim of "34 Flying Elvises."  Bergman is known for putting his main
characters into interesting predicaments that are not altogether
implausible.  He does not fail in this movie.</P>
<P>     Nicholas Cage plays the part of a private detective who abruptly
decides to get married to Sarah Jessica Parker, who plays a
schoolteacher.  They decide to get married and have their honeymoon in
Las Vegas.  While they are there, a professional gambler played by James
Caan, spots her and immediately set his sights on her.  Through a couple
of clever swings, Caan gets Cage to owe him a large sum of money, of
which cage doesn't have.  So Caan conveniently suggests that he borrow
his fiancee' for the weekend, and then the fun begins.</P>
<P>     When I say this is a solid piece of celluloid, I mean it is solid.
It is formulaic without really being formulaic.  That's what makes it
good.  It's got a couple of classic lines and some pretty outrageous
predicaments, but the best part about them is that they are all
believable.  Cage does wonderfully as a man who didn't know what he had
until he lost it.  I found both Parker and Caan to be ideally suited for
their roles, because they are not the most high-key of all actors and/or
actresses, and they do not have the most exciting roles in this movie.
But that's not putting them down; they did a fine job.</P>
<P>     If you want to see more of this kind of movie, check out THE
FRESHMAN if you haven't already seen it.  I believe HONEYMOON IN VEGAS
should have come earlier in the year.  It would have been more noticed
and more appreciated.  It a good flick, and worth at least a matinee
price at the box office.</P>
