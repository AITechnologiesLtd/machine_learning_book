<P>The Blair Witch Project
Directed by:  Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick
Starring: Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael Williams
Running time:  88 minutes
My rating (5 star scale):  **</P>
<P>I have a confession to make.  I scare easily.  I can be scared
by an episode of Charmed.  I can be
scared by books, tv, and movies.  I've read Lord of the Rings a
dozen times and parts of it still spook me.  The Blair Witch 
Project has been touted as a truly scary movie.  A movie which
scares you with your imagination and not expensive special fx.
Now, I agree that kind of scare is the best, but I didn't see
it here.  At most, I found myself occasionally amused and often 
bored.  But never, not for an instant, really scared.</P>
<P>Heather, Josh, and Mike are three would-be documentarians.  They
are making a documentary about the Blair witch, a mythical 
character who haunts the woods near Burkittsville (formerly Blair).
They start by interviewing some locals.  They hear stories about
the witch, a child killer, the mysterious deaths of several men 
and the disappearance of their bodies.  It's all vague and in 
the past and mostly from pretty unreliable sources.  </P>
<P>They head into the woods to camp for a couple of days and film 
some of the sites mentioned in the local legends.  And things
start going wrong.  None of them is very good at reading the map,
which may not be accurate anyway.  There are mysterious noises
in the night.  They find strange piles of rocks and bundles of 
sticks.  They fall behind schedule and start bickering amongst 
themselves.</P>
<P>Since the movie starts by telling us the film footage was 
recovered a year after the events and the three filmmakers 
disappeared, we aren't exactly surprised by the ending.  But 
lots of movies start off by telling you the ending (Sunset 
Boulevard and DOA are two great examples).  They work because
you want to see how the characters get to that point.  That's 
where Blair fails.  </P>
<P>Blair attempts to scare you by convincing you the story is true.
The actors don't recreate events - they are actually living and
filming what you see.  This means some of the scenes are poorly
lit and poorly framed - just as you would expect.  Many of the
events staged were done without the actors' knowledge - so their
reaction is genuine.  All this works, we get a film that looks 
like what it pretends to be.  </P>
<P>Unfortunately, realism isn't enough.  Even documentary film makers
realize they need to have a story as well.  There is an attempt
to create a story here by having us hear the legends and by
having mysterious and unexplained things happen in the woods.  
I think that's where the directors made their mistake.  The 
movie gets closest to scary when the characters squabble 
amongst themselves - not when they think they are confronting 
supernatural beings or rednecks out of Deliverance.  It's that
internal conflict that should have been the focus and that 
might have made this a truly scary film.</P>
<P>Instead, we get a movie with an interesting style.  I can see
why so many critics have praised it.  The directors had an idea 
and followed through well.  And what they have is a well executed
idea that falls short of success.  I saw this at a matinee 
discount and still felt like asking for my money back.  You 
will miss nothing by waiting for this to be available on video.</P>
