<P>   Just when you thought that romantic comedies had to be
sappy and unbelievable like "Notting Hill" or silly and just
plain unfunny like "Runaway Bride," along comes a film that
restores your faith in the genre.  With a script loaded with
sharp lines delivered with punch and direction that paces the
material superbly, "Mickey Blue Eyes" proves that even
Hollywood's love for scripts about the mob need not be
circular-filed as antiquated.  Credit  "The Godfather" series for
allowing a number of riffs about organized crime and a
plethora of films winking at the otherwise deadly serious
game of mob rule.  "Mickey Blue Eyes" may just be the
perfectly ripe pick of the harvest given the strong
performances of Hugh Grant in his best role to date and the
great James Caan in yet another confirmation of his
distinguished thespian craftsmanship.</P>
<P>   The comic whirls flow from a proposed marriage between
two people who are about as different in their cultural
backgrounds as Papuans from Episcopalians--in the efforts of
one of the pair to fashion himself into the society of the other. 
Hugh Grant performs once again in the role of a proper
Englishman of high breeding.  In this case he is the
auctioneer of a posh, Sotheby-style house which sells
paintings that are not quite in the class as the million-dollar
works hawked in the Duval's House of Francois Girard's
movie "The Red Violin," but which are peddled to the
connoisseurs and investors alike in a Fifth Avenue property in
Manhattan.  Screenwriters Adam Scheinman and Robert
Kuhn start the gags rolling from the very beginning as the
dignified Mr. Felgate pronounces an oil painting of a buxom
reclining person "Woman with Massive Bottom." When a
client bids $23,000, he determines that this comes to
"$11,500 per buttock" to the amusement of the crowd. 
Perhaps the sight-gag highlight of the film comes in a
Chinese restaurant as Michael proposes to his girl friend,
Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn) after arranging with the
owner to stuff a fortune of his choosing into her cookie.  </P>
<P>  Gina rebuffs the poor guy because she is actually a mob
princess, daughter of crime lord Frank Vitale (James Caan)
and niece to godfather Vito Graziosi (Burt Young) and does
not want Michael to become involved with the wiseguys. The
proper young Englishman is then even more determined to fit
in with the gangsters, to become like them while somehow
keeping his hands clean.  </P>
<P>   One of gags is positively surreal, even perhaps a riff on
some of the junk that art collectors buy purely in the hope of
selling at a profit years later.  The jest involves a painting
done by the son of a mobster featuring an airbound Jesus
mowing down an enemy with an Uzi, a monstrosity that
somehow is sold for $130,000.  What gives Hugh Grant the
latitude to turn in a smashing performances involves the
many ways he tries to prove to the shady characters that
make up his beloved's greater family that he's one of them--
even to the extent to muffling his king's English to say
"fuhgeddaboudit" to pass himself off as Little Big Mickey
Blue Eyes form Kansas City.  In one scene he executes a
striptease to distract Gina from evidence linking him with the
mob.  To gain credibility with the mob he is obliged, in
another scene, to rough up his auction-house boss, the even
more proper Brit played by the inimitable James Fox.</P>
<P>   The action comes to an anarchic conclusion filmed at that
celebrated wedding factory, Leonard's of Great Neck, in
which the FBI unfolds an intricate plot to arrest the crime
boss, Uncle Vito--who is determined to have Michael killed at
his own nuptials. </P>
<P>   "Mickey Blue-Eyes" features a sound track of bouncy
Italian music, particularly Bob Merrill's rousing "Mambo
Italiano" and is brightly filmed to best show off New York's
color and ambience.  The only way this splashy show could
have been made even more spectacular would have been to
cast Annabella Sciorra as the bride-to-be instead of the
insipid Jeanne Tripplehorn.</P>
<PRE>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 103 minutes.  (C) 1999
