<PRE>Prinze Charming
Head Over Heels</PRE>
<PRE> By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>"I'm the woman with the worst judgment in men," admits Amanda (Monica 
Potter). Having been cheated once too many times, she leaves her latest 
disloyal boyfriend and rents a closet (err... room) in an extravagant 
apartment occupied by four goofy models and overlooking the residence of 
Jim Winsten (Freddie Prinze Jr.). Having sworn off men forever, she 
buries herself in her work (fine art restoration) and then, of course, 
gets weak in the knees for Freddie upon first meeting. But will he fall 
head over heels too, or will he be just like all the other men in this 
movie, or will he turn out to be a phony, liar, Vespa rider? </P>
<P>Early on choppy editing left the production awkwardly timed. At Monica's 
workplace, the group of three senior ladies felt horribly filmed and 
added later. After a sticky first 20 minutes, the editing found a decent 
groove and the rough-edged acting also improved to adequate. </P>
<P>The first meeting of Monica and Jim balances the sweet charming beats 
with ouch wince-able beats. Much of the humor lies in stuttery, got the 
words wrong because I'm in love, type dialogue, "I got the runs ... I 
ah, mean, I gotta run." </P>
<P>Monica Potter shows some promise, gracing the screen with a reminiscence 
of Julia Roberts gone blonde and unrefined. "He must have some huge flaw 
... because I'm attracted to him." </P>
<P>Freddie Prinze, Jr. simply smiled and giggled his way through the 
picture. </P>
<P>4 models + 1 cop = a very bad scene. However, the two fish tank scenes 
brought a maturity and class to a production sorely unaware that those 
qualities were lacking. Though neither classy nor mature, by far the 
funniest two scenes required a toilet. (But they really were funny!) </P>
<P>But hey, what do I know? I'm not a fourteen year old girl. </P>
