Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stewart, Kathy

Review by Alex Bryson</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: **** / ****</PRE>
<P>Once in a while a movie arrives that is capable of appealing directly
to the nobler emotions of the viewer, and succeeds in embedding itself
in the popular consciousness. I'm pretty sure this is one of those
movies. As a piece of cinema Titanic suffers from any number of highly
visible flaws but for some curious reason as a whole it proves to be a
triumph, offering an exhilarating and affecting three and a quarter
hour experience few will forget quickly. Cameron expresses himself on
the largest and most expensive canvas ever but there is still intimacy
and subtlety in the film at its best.</P>
<P>Titanic is a cinematic brain bypass operation, but I don't mean that
in a disparaging way: the best films find a way to communicate their
themes: love, sacrifice, tragedy in this case without you noticing.
There is an examination of class and society in the film, as well as
the familiar notions of arrogance and greed so often associated with
this subject, but that is secondary to the main purpose of Titanic,
which is to tell the tale of a doomed romance. Categorising Titanic is
difficult: it is an uneasy combination of traditional disaster movie,
epic romance and James Cameron's other action flicks, almost as if it
had been decided that something for everyone should be included in
order that its eventual success be certain, but I think it is clear
that it is the second element he hopes we will concentrate on.</P>
<P>Whether it captures the full horror and scale of the tragedy is
debatable, but we are certainly given a privileged position to observe
an awesome recreation of that night in 1912. The events of that
evening are so familiar to us that making a picture with impact on the
subject must be doubly difficult: the film succeeds, but whether this
is due to the sheer immensity of the enterprise as it is presented to
the cinemagoer is unclear. Whatever the explanation, Cameron has
created a stunning movie. The budget has been the focus of much
debate, but I think it would be true to say that we see where it all
went. It was well spent.</P>
<P>The film chronicles the story of Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet),
an upper class Philadelphian returning to America to marry the wealthy
Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). She is not wholly convinced of the merits of
this arrangement, and on board she meets Jack Dawson (Leonardo
DiCaprio), a penniless artist, with whom she falls in love. Dawson is
the catalyst for her to break free of the restrictive conventions and
blinkered thinking of her 1st class companions, and she develops
independence and some real spirit. The sinking as well as incidental
stories like the present day search for a valuable gem in the wreck,
are interwoven with the main love story. Veteran Gloria Stewart makes
an appearance as Rose in the present day.</P>
<P>Now I mentioned there were problems. I will begin with the most
serious, the script. Titanic is the product of James Cameron, and the
script though hugely effective in terms of its grand thematic sweeps
does not maintain the high standard at a close-up level. It seems at
times that the film has been constructed from a mass cull of old
Hollywood romances, and most of the film seems familiar in some way,
but frankly this is not worth moaning about when the end product is
this impressive.</P>
<P>All the themes are there: love, self-sacrifice, honour: apparently the
film was pitched to the studio as 'Romeo + Juliet' aboard the doomed
liner. Guess who plays the hero? This type of thing is repeated a
number of times: Frances Fisher basically reprises the Charlotte
Bartlett role from "A Room with a View" as a stern matriarch for
instance. Some elements actually seem to have jumped straight from A
Night to Remember. The characters are familiar from hundreds of other
pictures, but at least Cameron has an eye for what sort of characters
work. I think he misses one cheap trick in failing to emphasise the
name of the elderly Rose when it occurs early on however.</P>
<P>Dialogue is clunky for the most part, but that is not to say Cameron
does not structure the narrative well. The flashbacks are hugely
effective - a scene where the ghostly wreck briefly returns to its
former glory is testimony to the storytelling flair of the director.
Cameron also presents us with a computer simulation of the sinking
early on which means we understand fully what is going on later. The
cinematography is superb, and visual effects have to be seen to be
believed. I think this could justifiably be called Cameron's best
work.</P>
<P>The performances are perhaps what keeps the film afloat: Leonardo
DiCaprio is an impressive spirited Jack, and he has shown again that
he has vast potential. I think I would be right in saying this is his
first leading man role, and he deports himself well as the resourceful
- though perhaps too boyish - hero. Winslet carries the film however,
yet again stunning in a role that suits her perfectly. She is perhaps
not at her best, but her transition from repressed aristocrat to
liberated heroine is a joy to watch, and marks a possible Oscar
contender even in this tough year. The chemistry between the two
lovers is almost tangible, and may offer the key to understanding the
film's effectiveness. Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton and Jonathan Hyde
amongst others offer solid support</P>
<P>The way it has been filmed results in the last hour feeling almost
like real time, but the sinking is surprisingly less successful than
the romance of the first part of the film. Cameron is revealed as a
closet romantic despite his fascination with cyborgs and heavy
machinery, and I'm not sure his heart is in the action sequences set
in flooded corridors with sparking lights and groaning metal. After
this the story does revert to its original type, but curiously I found
the final 1912 scenes not particularly moving: perhaps the problem was
the fact that the stories are already is so well known, or that I had
heard the Celine Dion song so had a fairly good idea which characters
would draw the short straw. The impact is subdued - more could have
been wrung from the characters at this point, but as I said before,
the film has flaws.</P>
<P>James Horner's score is one of his more impressive: elements of his
1995 Braveheart and an Enya like sound have been fused to create a
haunting and effective soundtrack: his interpretation of the action
sequences are not quite as good as the rest, but then I don't suppose
the action sequences themselves were. Fortunately Dion is kept for the
end credits where she belongs.</P>
<P>There really is little reason to dislike Titanic - certainly it is at
points trite, cliched and poorly developed, but at its best it has a
vitality and spirit that make these faults pale into insignificance
beside the awesome grasp of its ambition. I would be surprised if
Titanic does not come to be considered alongside the great historical
epics, though maybe it is not a Lawrence of Arabia. Admittedly the
same people who are saying this now probably said it about The English
Patient last year, or Dances with Wolves before that, but the
effectiveness of Titanic and this same ambition will surely secure its
place in that pantheon.</P>
<P>What critics struggle to communicate about this film is the ability it
has to involve the audience in its story and the sheer power the
visuals and narrative exert on the viewer - analysed separately the
script would suggest a fairly disappointing film, but Titanic has a
strange quality that allows it to overcome all its limitations. I
can't express what makes Titanic so special either - no doubt every
studio executive is asking precisely this question. In any case see it
for yourself.</P>
