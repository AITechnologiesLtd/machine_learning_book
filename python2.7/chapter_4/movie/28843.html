<P>When I first saw the trailers for The Fast and The Furious I grumbled at 
the thought of the movie. I mean, how much of a movie can someone make out 
of those annoyingly loud Rice Rockets that we see on the streets everyday? 
I wasn't even planning on seeing this movie in the theatres, it was at best 
a movie rental that I could fast forward through.</P>
<P>Am I glad that my younger cousins took me to see this movie in the 
theatres. This movie is everything that the Driving-Ms. Cage-Race-Movie 
"Gone in 60 Seconds" from last summer should have been. The adrenaline 
flows fast and with a wide open throttle in this film. There are only two 
reasons to see The Fast and The Furious: The cars and the stunts.</P>
<P>"What about the story?" you ask. There is one, but it's only really there 
to glue together some of the best driving stunt work I've seen in a long 
time. The story goes something like this: A cop (Paul Walker) goes 
undercover to infiltrate a gang of street racers lead by a guy (Vin 
Diesel). This gang leader could also be the leader of a gang of people who 
rob trucks full of electronic goodies in order to pay for car upgrades. 
There's also a love story that happens between the cop and the gang 
leader's sister. Not much story, but that's not really what's expected.</P>
<P>Is The Fast and The Furious a bad movie? It is, it's one of those bad 
movies that is so fun to watch that after awhile I feel bad for enjoying it 
so much : ) The comparisons between The Fast and The Furious and last 
summers Gone in 60 Seconds are expected. Whereas The Fast and The Furious 
moves at lighting speed, Gone in 60 Seconds crawls to the finish line. The 
Fast and The Furious is all about the cars and racing. Gone in 60 Seconds 
was self-conscious and wanted to tell and actually good story too. It's too 
bad that Gone in 60 Seconds didn't have a good story to tell. Sure there 
were exotic cars in Gone in 60 Seconds, but we hardly got to see them, 
except for some flashes near the end. And there were car chases in Gone in 
60 Seconds, but only one real car chase that featured a kick ass Shelby at 
the end of the film - not much of a pay off for sitting through a long 
laborious film, if you ask me. How does The Fast and The Furious compare? 
Like night and day. There are car chases throughout. We get to see the 
actual cars, which were pretty damn impressive, throughout the film (I 
loved the Toyota Supra the Dodge Charger at the end). The makes of The Fast 
and The Furious know they have no story, so they just pump us up full of 
action. And this strategy works!</P>
<P>Don't go see The Fast and The Furious for the story or the acting. See it 
for the cars and the stunts. You won't be disappointed.</P>
