<PRE>A Review by Fred M. Hung</PRE>
<P>I was sitting in a conference room during a late night in December. 
Tired, and not really focused, I asked a colleague what exciting
Christmas movie he was waiting to see.  He answered, "Titanic."  I
immediately smirked.  I likened Titanic-hype to another Ishtar,
Waterworld, and all their runaway budget sisters.  My friend said he
wanted to see what a $200 million movie would look like, especially the
cutting edge effects by Industrial Light and Magic.  Still, I was
hesitant.  Effects alone are not the hallmarks of a superior film.  I
have always been cynical of Hollywood producing superficial,
eye-catching films that are pleasing to look at but lack a real story.</P>
<P>Well, several months later, and a billion dollars later, on a very
boring Sunday night last weekend, I decided to give in examine the
Titanic hysteria for myself.  Everyone and their cousins had seen the
film by then.  Critics were giving kudos to director James Cameron and
female cast Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart.  Moreover, as people in my
office will tell you, I was driven insane by the radio play of Celine
Dion's "My Heart will Go On."  Still, I was very biased against it. 
After all, I thought, it's still about a giant boat sinking to the
bottom of the ocean, right?</P>
<P>Aside from the enormous budget, the very uncomplicated story line
(nomadic working-class boy meets sophisticated spoiled socialite girl)
is not that original, which probably explains why Titanic was never
nominated for best screenplay.  And like Apollo 13, the audience is
aware of the fate of the ship, and some 1500 of her complement.  Titanic
could have easily been a titanic failure.</P>
<PRE>I was wrong. </PRE>
<P>The fact that Titanic has been such an amazing success for James Cameron
and his producers should be a resounding vindication for her earlier
detractors.  In addition to breathtaking special effects, the critical
success factors to Titanic can be broken down to a simple but endearing
story, solid performances from both lead and supporting actors, and an
unforgettable soundtrack.  </P>
<P>An ABC critic said it best, "We know that at least one lives to tell the
story, and for the next 3 hours, we're hoping that both survive."  The
romance between DiCaprio and Winslet is doomed from the start. 
Cameron's then has the difficult task of telling a fated tale where the
audience still has to remain optimistic despite all evidence to the
contrary.  Perhaps that is Titanic's greatest achievement.   </P>
<P>DiCaprio, despite a very youthful appearance, manages to deliver a solid
performance but much of Titanic's success must be attributed to Kate
Winslet.  Kate is absolutely stunning, giving a near flawless
performance as an anachronistic turn of the century feminist, refusing
comport to the customs or prejudices of the privileged.  Kate delicately
balances her character with strength and vulnerability.  </P>
<P>DiCaprio and Winslet are supported finely by Kathy Bates, a Southern
commoner whose husband struck riches through oil, and Frances Fisher,
Winslet's elitist mother who wants to secure her place in aristocracy
through Winslet's marriage. </P>
<P>Last, but certainly not least, Titanic has an amazing score by James
Horner.  Horner has traditionally been inconsistent, composing tepid
tracks in the Star Trek series, to rousing themes in Clear and Present
Danger and Glory.  Here he has mapped the emotions of  Titanic to music,
from a triumphant march in her launch to mournful requiem in her death. 
Batman's Danny Elfman, who is nominated twice in the same category this
year, has already graciously conceded defeat.</P>
<P>There are some lines in Titanic that could be reworked, namely the
horrible "I was like tumbleweed in the wind" and "Don't ever let go!" 
It is difficult to determine whether Titanic is good enough to warrant
the attention she's receiving, but it is good.  The mass appeal of the
film is a direct result of  its ability to evoke the universal themes
love, humanity, and at times courage.  Look for a superbly intellectual
film like Primary Colors to be crushed this weekend by the Titanic
juggernaut.  Also look for Best Picture, Director, Actress, Original
Score, and Song to all go to Titanic, effortlessly.  Cameron has created
a film of epic splendor, if not story.  For his audacity and faith, he
should be commended.</P>
