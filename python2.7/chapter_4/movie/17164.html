                            THE RAGE: CARRIE 2
                       A movie review by Joe Barlow
                            (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>

<PRE>             RATING: Half a star  (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        My friends, I have seen bad films.  I have laughed in the
face of "Batman and Robin," cackled maniacally at "The Avengers,"
giggled all the way through "Highlander II"... and received a
perverse sort of pleasure from them all, I might add.  When it
comes to the enjoyment of bad movies, you will be hard-pressed to
find my equal.  An Ed Wood retrospective?  Count me in!  A Roger
Corman marathon?  I'm there, my friend, I'm there!</P>
<P>        That introduction was necessary in order for you to
understand the magnitude of what I'm about to say: As God is
my witness, I have never seen anything like "The Rage: Carrie 2,"
a film which has no reason to exist on this planet other than to
emotionally scar anyone who sees it.  I'm not sure, but I think
it made me sterile.</P>
<P>        Who in the hell thought "Carrie," Brian de Palma's 1976
macabre masterpiece about a teenage girl cursed with telekinetic
powers, needed a sequel in the first place?  The tale, based on
Stephen King's novel of the same name, was engrossing and
touching, as the outcast Carrie (Sissy Spacek) fell for a handsome
senior (William Katt), not realizing that his friends were using their
relationship as the set-up for a cruel joke.  Carrie was warm and
undeniably human; we could understand her pain, which made the
film's final 20 minutes all the more tragic.  (Even people who have
never seen the movie know all about the famous prom scene, which
ranks right up there with "Psycho's" shower montage in terms of
pop-culture familiarity.)</P>
<P>        "The Rage: Carrie 2," which is really more of a remake
than a sequel, doesn't bother to give the same depth to its
so-called "heroine," a goth-girl named Rachel (Emily Bergl).
We're supposed to sympathize with her, I think.  I guess.
Maybe.  Couldn't tell you why.  Like Carrie, Rachel is a social
outcast who possesses a limited telekinetic ability, which grows
stronger when she gets angry.  Unlike Carrie, Rachel never earns
our sympathy: most of her problems seem avoidable, and if she
appears to be an outcast at school, I blame it on the fact that
she's a bitch to everyone she encounters.</P>
<P>        In her defense, the script doesn't give Bergl much to
build her performance on.  We learn very little about Rachel
over the course of the story.  What are her hobbies?  Her
aspirations and goals?  How does she feel about her mother,
who is locked up in a mental institution?  The movie couldn't
care less, and nothing I saw made me curious to know more.
Nor does Bergl possess the ability to rise above the material--
her main method of dealing with a crisis is to deliver her
dialogue to the floor.  (See for yourself!  Anytime she gets a
major speech, Rachel drops her eyes, as though she were talking
to the ground.  I was actually disappointed the floor didn't
receive a co-acting credit for its fine work here.  It certainly
gives the best performance in the movie.)</P>
<P>        It's not just Bergl's fault.  Every character in this
film is here for one specific purpose, and no more: Rachel's best
friend is here to die, thus allowing Rachel's emotional stress
(and her telekinetic power) to skyrocket.  The "in-crowd"
characters are here to instigate this movie's equivalent of
the prom scene massacre.  Jesse (Jason London) is here to fill
the Katt role from the first movie: he's the handsome, popular
jock who goes out with the shunned girl, earning the scorn of
his friends in the process.  He's supposed to be likeable, but
he's not: witness his notebook, in which he keeps track of all
the girls he's had sex with and awards them points based on
their physical attractiveness.  But the most laughable character
is Sue Snell (Amy Irving, reprising her role from the original
film), who is here to gasp dramatically at key moments.  She's
the school's guidance counselor, and makes her living by consoling
distressed students with helpful observations like: "Losing people
close to you can hurt sometimes."  Not exactly Sigmund Freud,
is she?</P>
<P>        Events are so obviously set up that only a dummy -- or
Rachel -- wouldn't be able to see through them.  She's tormented
by the popular kids.  Her life is traumatic.  When she starts dating
Jesse, the in-crowd at school pretends to accept her.  Rachel
finds out that they're just putting her on during a crowded party,
thus giving her a reason to go ballistic and wipe out most of the
people in attendance.  And because the story opens with a scene
of Rachel and Jesse discussing the end of "Romeo and Juliet," we
know that either Rachel or Jesse, or perhaps both, will be pushing
up the daisies by the end of it all.  Blame the directors (yes, it
apparantly took two directors to make a film this bad) for adhering
to cliche and violence, rather than story and characterization.</P>
<P>        The movie eschews restraint during its climactic apocalypse.
We're treated to graphic decapitations, and numerous shots of people
being speared like pieces of fruit in a mixed drink.  A young man's
testicles are separated from his body before our very eyes.  Thank
you, movie.</P>
<P>        But even this doesn't begin to convey the pure wretchedness
of this piece of excrement.  Just how bad is "The Rage: Carrie 2?"
Well, here's a list of things I learned while watching it:</P>
<P>        1) If a teenage girl hears a knock on the front door when
she's clothed in nothing but a towel, she should immediately fling
the front door wide open without bothering to establish the identity
of the visitor.  If no one is there, she should poke around the dark
shadows which surround her on every side, while still wearing the 
towel.</P>
<P>        2) Breaking out of an asylum is a piece of cake.  One
merely has to say "Hey, look over there!" to the guard.  (At
least "In Dreams" made it look like it took some ingenuity to
escape from this type of place.)</P>
<PRE>        3) Vomiting is cute when performed by drunken football
players.</PRE>
<P>        4) Shaking the camera equals cheap telekinetic effects!
It's hours of fun for the whole family!</P>
<P>        5) If the guy you're dating likes your kind of music, he's
obviously your soulmate.  Rachel eyes Jesse warily for the first
half of the movie, until he mentions that he likes the band Garbage.
Immediately she perks up: "You like Garbage?"  Obviously he does:
he's in this movie, isn't he?  And in case you miss their passion,
a computer-generated spark is inserted when their fingertips brush
together.</P>
<P>        The only moments of life contained in this film are the
flashbacks from the original "Carrie," which really have no
business being here at all, but do at least make this piece of tripe
watchable.  (Hint for the filmmakers: don't insert footage from a
good movie into the middle of your really bad one.  It just makes
your offering look even worse by comparison.)  Actually, I take it
back: there *is* a reason to include these flashback scenes: to entice
teenagers into buying a copy of the original "Carrie," which is now
23 years old and has probably not been seen by the sequel's target
audience.</P>
<P>        Why would anyone take a classic film like "Carrie" and
butcher its memory so badly?  I tell you, Stephen King must be
rolling over in his... great big pile of money?  Under no circum-
stance should you see "The Rage: Carrie 2."  Your very salvation
depends on it.</P>
