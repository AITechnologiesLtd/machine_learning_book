<PRE>                                  EXOTICA
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This scattered mosaic of a film
          forces the viewer to piece together its plot from
          fragments presented along the way.  While the
          story, once assembled, is ultimately dissatisfying,
          the challenge of assembling the pieces to
          understand the whole story keeps the viewer
          engrossed.  Explicit scenes set in a strip club and
          the film's view of that business will have an
          appeal all their own.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     There is a party game called "A Stick Falls, a Man Dies."  The
person running the game gives players a very high-level description of
an invented incident and players try to figure out what really
happened, asking only yes-or-no questions.  By doing this players geta
fragment of the story here, one there, soon there are whole parts of
the story they understand.  Finally the right piece falls into place
and they understand  the whole story.  Films, of necessity, make the
viewer play a similar game.  In the first scene of a film the audience
see characters they don't yet know in a situation they don't yet
understand.  Most filmmakers try to bring viewers up to speed as
quickly as possible, giving all the necessary clues as quickly as
possible.  Generally it is the mark of a bad filmmaker to leave the
viewer confused.  But it is very possible to tell a story much like as
in the game where the pieces are revealed in no particular order.  A
bit at a time, the way the pieces fit together is uncovered to the
viewer until the viewer has a whole story.  PULP FICTION did that to
some extent, telling its interlocking stories out of chronological
order on purpose to make the audience work to piece together the
overall story.  MARATHON MAN intentionally shows the audience a very
diverse set of scenes with odd characters before it starts knitting
them together into a single story.  Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan goes
much further in that direction in his cinematic jigsaw puzzle EXOTICA.
The characters and situations are intentionally confusing to challenge
the viewer initially to put them together to make a story.  And with
Egoyan's mischievous wit, the story is not just told as a jigsaw
puzzle, it is told to mislead on purpose.  The gaps that the viewer
attempts to fill in for himself, he is probably wrong about.  And the
story that gets shown to the viewer a bit at a time is perfectly suited
to this style of telling.  It is about the secrets in people's lives
that they do not reveal to others, and perhaps not even to themselves.</P>
<P>     The one problem in all this is that when you hear the solution in
the party game, the story may make a nifty puzzle solution, but it is
just not that good a story all by itself.  EXOTICA has the same
problem.  When the last secrets are disclosed in the final scene, what
you have is a story that needs the convoluted telling because it just
is not compelling on its own.  The plot that connects the three major
characters--the smuggler, the tax auditor, and the strip club host--
seems overly contrived and frankly, just not all that interesting.  One
comes away saying, "Oh.  Is that all?"  The story is curiously
unmoving.</P>
<P>     Egoyan both wrote and directed this piece which is bound to appeal
to some audiences for the intellectual appeal of what is slowly
revealed in its central puzzle.  And it may appeal to quite a different
audience for what is more quickly and easily revealed in its explicit
sex club scenes.</P>
<P>     This is a film with more than its share of surprises that expertly
catches the viewer off-balance more often than not.  Unfortunately,
Egoyan is more interested in his game of secrets about his characters
than in actually giving us insights.  I give EXOTICA a +1 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
