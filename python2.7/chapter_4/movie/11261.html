<P>Don't be deceived by the title; this is not another film about America
in World War II.  "Life During Wartime" is set in modern-day Los
Angeles and has nothing to do with warfare. </P>
<P>Tommy (David Arquette of "Dream with the Fishes") is a young,
likeable, up-and-coming salesman of home security systems.  Things are
going well for him; he's got a new job and a new girlfriend, Gale
(Kate Capshaw, aka. Mrs. Spielberg).  His boss, Heinrich (Stanley
Tucci of "Big Night"), likes Tommy enough to put him in the company's
new TV commercial.  But Heinrich's company is struggling; reduced crime
hasn't helped *everyone*.  Heinrich, it turns out, has a few dark
secrets that could make Tommy's life a living hell.</P>
<P>Evan Dunsky's sometimes hilarious debut film "Life During Wartime" has
a dark side to it, but the film isn't all black comedy.  Some of the
sexually-oriented humor is outrageously funny - the packed house at
our theater was in hysterics several times.  Only later in the film
does it get darker.   And the film avoids being stagey even though it
is based on a play (by Keith Reddin).</P>
<P>"Life During Wartime", made on a low budget, is still playing the
festival circuit; it's debut was Toronto in the fall and also showed
at Sundance before I saw it here last week at the Portland
International Film Festival.  The film has been picked up by one of
the Sony distributors and should be opening in limited release 
later this year.</P>
<P>"Life During Wartime" is not a perfect film by any means.  David
Arquette is so cute that you just want to strangle him.  And the film
does wane towards the end; the ending itself is kind of an
unsatisfying whimper.  But there are enough hearty laughs earlier
to make it very worthwhile.  If you aren't put off by dark humor or
sexually-explicit dialogue, check it out.  It may show up at your
local art house instead of the suburban multiplexes, but  "Life
During Wartime" isn't really an art film.  Mainstream adult audiences
should enjoy it too.</P>
