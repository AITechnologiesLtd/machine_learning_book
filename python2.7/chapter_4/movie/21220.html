<P>Susan Granger's review of "THREE TO TANGO" (Warner Bros.)</P>
<P> The producers of this mildly amusing, off-beat romantic
comedy obviously thought that if they paired popular Matthew Perry
from TV's "Friends" with Neve Campbell from TV's "Party of Five" and
"Scream," adding Dylan McDermott and Oliver Platt for substance,
they'd have a hit - wrong!  Matthew Perry plays an ambitious,
idealistic, if clumsy young architect who has just been chosen by
businessman Dylan McDermott to compete for the design of a
multi-million dollar Chicago cultural center. The slimy tycoon also
tells Perry he'll get preferential consideration if he'll spy on his
mistress, Neve Campbell, assuming that Perry is a homosexual, like his
openly gay partner, played by Oliver Platt. Predictably, Perry falls
for Campbell, who also thinks he's gay, particularly when he's honored
as Gay Professional of the Year. What will he do? Will he continue to
lie to hold on to the job opportunity of a lifetime and a warm but
frustrating friendship with the girl he loves or come out of the
closet and admit he's secretly straight? You guess. I'll give you a
hint, though. Screenwriter Rodney Vaccaro's own bizarre experience
inspired the story. While he was working as creative director of a
large advertising agency, he fell in love with his boss's mistress. A
series of what he describes as "sexual errors" led to Vaccaro
eventually marrying her and co-writing this script with Aline Brosh
McKenna. But, despite superficial similarities, this is no "The
Apartment" or even "In and Out," perhaps because of Damon
Santostefano's light-hearted direction which makes it feel like a TV
sit-com. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Three to Tango" is a
frenetic, formulaic, flimsy 4, satirizing sexual stereotypes with the
catchline: " You've made a big gay bed, and now you must slumber gayly
in it!"</P>
