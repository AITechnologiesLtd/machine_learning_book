<P>   We who live in big cities know people who are not all
there--not just neurotics (that's all of us) but neighbors,
perhaps, certainly some of the homeless who are downright
psychotic.  We don't know what they see that we don't, but
they appear to have rich fantasy lives, whether yelling at
unknown enemies or huddled against a building talking to
themselves.  What some people don't realize is that most of
these deranged people have perfectly lucid moments and
some are even geniuses.  (Excellent movie about the latter
would be, of course, Philip Kaufman's "Quills" about the
tormented Marquis de Sade who smuggles literary works
from his asylum. and Scott Hicks's "Shine," about a brilliant
pianist who has turned into a babbling idiot.)  Geoffrey Rush,
extraordinary in both roles, has nothing on our own Samuel L.
Jackson, who in "The Caveman's Valentine" performs in the
role of a luminous pianist-composer, formerly associated with
the Juilliard school, who has become unhinged in the mind
when he begins to hear voices from the fanciful Cornelius
Gould Stuyvesant from atop the Chrysler building.  Even
more fascinating, he has sexual visions of dancers swirling
about (captured wonderfully by Amelia Vincent's lens), seen
either before or after his world turns sickly green--which
signals the audience that he's about to go over the top, to do
something unpredictable and mesmerizing.</P>
<P>   Mesmerizing is the word to describe Samuel L. Jackson's
performance in a film made by Kasi Lemmons, whose "Eve's
Bayou" was named by Roger Ebert the best movie is its year. 
While the Kasi Lemmons touch is on display in this second
effort, given the superstitions and voodoo that contributed to
the gothic atmosphere of "Eve's Bayou," this movie most
resembles Terry Gilliam's "The Fisher King," about a self-
absorbed radio personality whose deep depression is lifted by
a street person who needs rescue himself.</P>
<P>  What drove this man, one Romulus Ledbetter (Samuel L.
Jackson), off the deep end?  Who knows?  What turns a well-
adjusted person into a paranoid schizophrenic is too complex
a subject to tackle in a film or normal length.  Instead,
George Dawes Green, whose 1994 novle is the basis of his
screenplay, appears even more interested in the rational
motivations of the man than in his oddity.  When Ledbetter--
whose lives in a cave and is ridiculed by the local yahoos--
discovers the inert body of a young man seemingly living in a
tree, he rejects the police determination that the victim simply
froze to death and is determined to investigate the case to
win back the favor of his police officer daughter, Lulu
(Aunjanue Ellis).</P>
<P>   Believing at first that the victim was murdered by
Ledbetter's archenemy Stuyvesant, he later comes to
consider a high-profile artist to be the culprit.  He suspects
David Leppenraub (Colm Feore) of torturing the young man
to death in order to evoke the needed emotions for his
images.  After penetrating  the affluent world of a bankruptcy
laywer, Bob (Anthony Michael Hall), who lends him a suit, he
uses a contact to enter the domain of the artist and in the
process has a sexual liaison with the artist's free-living sister
Moira (Ann Magnuson).  For a while Ledbetter's lucid
moments enable him to deliver a sparkling rendition of a
piano work by Terence Blanchard, allowing him time snoop
around to discover clues that would implicate the arrogant
artist in the murder.</P>
<P>   "The Caveman's Valentine," then, is both a neo-gothic
murder mystery and an exploration of the disturbed mind of a
genius, each allowing the audience to thrill to the remarkable
acting talents of Sam Jackson.  Director Lemmons has
covered the bearded Jackson in dreads down to his waist,
eyes expressively bulging while he rants to strangers on the
sidewalk yet talks softly to his daughter and to his imagined
wife Sheila (Tamara Tunie).  As though his frightening visions
of dementia were not enough, Lemmons introduces quickly-
edited black-and-white frames from Ledbetter's earlier and
more down-to-earth life which are contrasted with the striking
but undeveloped imagery from his unhealthy mind.  </P>
<P>   Though "The Caveman's Valentine" calls for quite a
suspension of disbelief--positing that a rich lawyer and well-
known artist would without hesitation invite such a disheveled
man in their homes and that the sister of the artist would
have no problem bedding the homeless man--the film rivets
by Mr. Jackson's raw ability to convey the dimensions of
paranoid schizophrenia, by the contrasting personality of the
artist played with appropriate restraint by the talented Colm
Feore, and by the regard that the imaginative Lemmons
shows for movies as a visual medium.</P>
