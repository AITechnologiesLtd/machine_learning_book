<PRE>ZOOLANDER
A film review by Annette Cardwell
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>In Zoolander, the world's most successful, influential and
intellectually-challenged male model Derek Zoolander wonders, "Is there
more to life than being really really really good looking?"  Obviously,
the film's creator and star Ben Stiller asked a similar question when
crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious VH1/Vogue Fashion
Awards short-film subject: Can there be more to this film than being
really really really silly?  No, of course not, and it never aspires to
be anything more.</P>
<P>Much like Derek, Zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie.  It's not
complex in either its social commentary or its comedy, and it never
produces any gut-busting laughs (except maybe a scene when Derek's model
roommates all die in a tragic "gasoline fight" accident -- a riotously
funny take-off of Tommy Hilfiger ads).  But it has a satisfying handful
of strong chuckles, wild characters and performances, and mildly harsh
potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused.  Better yet, this
exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out
to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its
goofball plot without exhausting the gag.</P>
<P>Zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the
Prime Minister of Malaysia, since he wants to abolish child labor in his
country and thus driving up their costs.  Fashion designer and criminal
mastermind Jacobim Mugatu (Will Ferrell) drafts a plan to brainwash the
dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed.  Enter Derek, whose
career is slumping as newcomer Hansel (Owen Wilson) takes the
spotlight.  On the trail of Mugatu's plot is Time magazine reporter
Matilda Jeffries (Stiller's real-life wife Christine Taylor), and she's
hoping to use Mugatu's pawn Derek to ultimately foil the scheme.</P>
<P>Much like the Austin Powers films, Zoolander relies heavily on the
strength of the talent involved, and this zany comedy features some of
the funniest people in entertainment today.  Wilson is hysterical as the
young, vain Hansel.  Ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the
flamboyant, freakish Mugatu in the same way Dr. Evil upstages everyone
in Austin Powers.  Jerry Stiller -- Ben's dad who's best remembered as
Frank Costanza of Seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as Derek's slimy
agent Maury Ballstein. Even Ben Stiller Show alum Andy Dick shows up as
a deranged, large-assed masseuse.  As for Ben Stiller, it seems his
Derek has one gag: He's stupid, which plays out in some uproarious
one-liners.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Taylor seems out of place and out of her league here. 
Maybe it's just because I can't stop seeing her as Marcia Brady (who she
played in both Brady movies), making her unbelievable as a dowdy, brainy
plain Jane who hasn't had sex in two years.  She leaves me pining for
the cynicism of Janeane Garofolo, who would've added real comic
substance to the flimsy role.</P>
<P>While Zoolander is hardly highbrow, its screwball humor is welcome
during these trying times, especially considering the gross lack of
decent pickings in the theaters these days.  Zoolander's no masterpiece,
but a very worthy distraction.</P>
