Hollywood Hotline Featured Review
Almost Heroes (PG-13) no stars</PRE>
<P>While he had a number of memorably funny moments during his starmaking
stint on _Saturday_Night_Live_, the late Chris Farley's big-screen starring
vehicles--_Tommy_Boy_, _Black_Sheep_, and _Beverly_Hills_Ninja_--ranged
from bad, worse, to amusingly bad.  Sad to say, his final film,
_Almost_Heroes_, is every bit as sloppily made as his previous starring
efforts--a virtually laugh-free comedy that puts a sad end to the woefully
lackluster screen career of a talented comic.</P>
<P>It's hard to believe that Christopher Guest, who directed last year's
smart and funny mockumentary _Waiting_for_Guffman_, helmed this disastrous
enterprise.  Then again, no director could have salvaged the witless script
by Mark Nutter, Tom Wolfe, and Boyd Hale.  Matthew Perry and Farley play
Leslie Edwards and Bartholmew (sic) Hunt, two explorers determined to beat
the legendary Lewis and Clark to the Pacific Northwest territories in 1804.
 Needless to say, the effete Edwards and the boorish Hunt are in over their
heads, falling into a number of precarious, would-be comic situations (such
as running into a merry band of evil conquistadors) en route to the
Pacific.  The odd-couple teaming of Perry and Farley sounds promising, but
the two generate little comic chemistry.  While this is partly the fault of
the actors (a distracted-looking Perry seems more concerned over
maintaining his uppity New England accent than selling one-liners), the
script never gives them much opportunity to play off their contrasting
comedic styles--Perry's deadpan wit and Farley's wild physicality.
Instead, the writers succumb to the lazy trap that befell the scribes
behind Farley's previous starring vehicles--jam as many "fat guy falls
down" gags as possible.</P>
<P>This time around, though, these obvious gags have an underlying tone of
sadness, since Farley's frustration with such gags has become well-noted
after his death.  Even more troubling are the gags centering on Hunt's
alcohol consumption.   These jokes would have been only moderately amusing
at best had Farley lived to see this film's release, but in light of the
substance abuse-related circumstances of his death, the gags come off even
cheaper, not to mention all the more insulting to the late star.</P>
<P>In my review for another unscreened-for-critics (wonder why) from Warner
Bros., the awful _Major_League:_Back_to_the_Minors_, I noted that not even
the guy in the audience who laughs at just about anything let out a single
chuckle throughout the movie.  The most I can say about _Almost_Heroes_ is
that the laughing guy was back in his element, greeting many a joke with
explosions of laughter.  Everyone else, though, was stonefaced and
silent--at least those strong enough to not walk out of the auditorium.</P>
