<P>   I know quite a few people who despite being college grads and
holding decent jobs continue to live with their parents, or live "at
home" as the euphemism would have it.  Is there any excuse for
this?   "Well," they say, "In Eastern societies it's not only common
to live in extended family relationships; for the young 'uns to move
out on their own is positively frowned upon."  Or, "We live in a
large home: I never see my parents."  Maybe, "You know how the
economy is...I gotta save my dough and when I live and eat with
my folks, I can stash a bundle."  Or, "I love my folks.  Why should
I leave them?"  Ah, but we're living in a Western society, there's
no such thing as living with your parents but not seeing them, and
there's no way that you're going to have the same kind of privacy
to live your own life until you take off and get yourself a crib of your
own.  Did I say crib?  According to John Singleton, who wrote and
directed "Baby Boy" and a decade ago contributed the dazzling
debut of "Boyz N  the Hood," a large segment of  young black
men in America are emotionally (but certainly not physically) 
immature, referring to their apartments as their cribs, their girls
friends as "mama," and their friends as "my boys."  While we
could argue about whether psychosemantics is bull and words are
just words, there's no getting around Singleton's angry new work
as at least a film-maker's fictionalized evidence that childish
behavior does indeed exist among portions of  our country's young
black men.</P>
<P>   While a mass audience could conceivably be drawn into the
theaters playing this honest and energetic film, "Baby Boy" at 129
minutes is lengthy and, given its raw, forthright spirit is more of an
arthouse piece that would cater to an audience more concerned
with learning more about life than with escaping from genuine
human concerns.  Save for a disappointing ending in which loose
ends are too neatly tied up out of Singleton's apparent desire for
closure, "Baby Boy" is so impressive that those of us concerned
about ranking movies in order of merit could put this one ahead of
"Boyz N Hood"--which starred Laurence Fishburne as a divorced
father trying to raise his son with values, to lead him away form
the violence in the neighborhood.  This time, Singleton is back in
the same south-central L.A. neighborhood but it looks like a
different place--superficially a clean, neat suburban neighborhood
where kids ride their bikes and residents keep up their neat lawns,
even pulling up weeds and planting rows of tomatoes, cabbage
and collards.  While the director had a celebrity cast for "Boyz" to
make sure that film would be potent--Fishburne, Ice Cube, Nia
Long, Angela Bassett and introducing Cuba Gooding, Jr.--this
time he's with some relative unknowns who are in no way less
effectual given the lucidity of the text.</P>
<P>   The story centers on Jody (Tyrese Gibson), who inhabits virtually
every scene, a man who at the age of twenty has already fathered
two children by two women, but has held onto his room in the
home of his 36-year-old mother Juanita (Adrienne-Joi Johnson). 
Juanita is not the kind of mom who fills her boy with meat loaf and
begs him to stay on at least until he gets married but at her age is
still ready for devilish fun and doesn't want her baby boy to hang
around.  Young Jody is sure he's no longer needed when he sees
mama's new man Melvin (Ving Rhames) stark naked in the family
kitchen cooking up a storm for Juanita.  Though without a job,
Jody does have a life of sorts, spending some of his time with his
favorite buddy Sweepea (Omar Gooding) and most of his
moments with his best gal Yvette (Taraji P. Henson)--who has had
an abortion and is increasingly fed up with her man's
philandering.  </P>
<P>   Singleton shows his desire to blame others for Jody's
predicament only in a brief statement in the opening narration, in
which he put the blame for Jody's aimlessness squarely on Jody
but throws in the rejoinder that racism is nonetheless responsible
for the young man's limited potential.  As Jody goes from his main
woman to another, to his best friend for advice and then,
reluctantly becomes mentored by his would-be stepdad Melvin,
we in the audience cannot help wondering exactly what Singleton
means when he asserts that racism is at least partially responsible
for Melvin's 10-year jail sentence for crimes committed when, as
Melvin puts it, he was "young and dumb," or from Jody's
irresponsibility in fathering one boy, sponging off his girl friend and
Juanita, and likely suffering from an Oedipal attachment to his
mother. Roger Ebert states in his review that "the movie's
message to men like its hero is: Yes, racism has contributed to
your situation--but do you have to give it so much help with your
own attitude?"  No way am I saying that racism is not still a
destructive force on our society: but where is the evidence in this
story? After all the people in the yarn have decent enough jobs--
Yvette working a computer in a nicely-designed office, Melvin
putting in a full day as a landscaper--and they live in a suburban
part of L.A. that simply cannot be compared to an urban ghetto
like Brooklyn's Bed-Stuy.  </P>
<P>   The acting is first-rate all around, with A.J. Johnson doing a
terrific job as an energetic, fun-loving woman who gardens when
she is not playing with Melvin and repeatedly tries to coax her
baby boy out of the crib, while Tyrese Gibson, who has a following
as a singer and music video D.J. executes a bang-up job as a guy
not at all eager to find himself, at least not while he has his two
favorite women giving him everything he seems to need.</P>
