<P>_AI_Artificial_Intelligence_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>        "His love is real.  But he is not."  It's one of the corniest
taglines in recent memory, but it also well sums up the main debate that
swirls around _AI_Artificial_Intelligence_, Steven Spielberg's fruition
of the late Stanley Kubrick's long-gestating project based on the Brian
Aldiss short story "Supertoys Last All Summer Long."  Is it possible to
empathize with a protagonist who is a machine specifically programmed to
feel that emotion?  Consequently, is his emotion truly "real"?</P>
<P>        These are indeed valid and troubling questions as one watch _AI_,
but as with a number of films fundamentally flawed in design, execution
more than smooths over most of the rough spots--namely Haley Joel
Osment's extraordinary lead turn as David, the "he" of the syrupy
tagline.  In this future world where robots routinely coexist with humans
in their households and in society in general, David stands apart from
all the other "mecha": he is the first to be programmed with the ability
to love.  When Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor), whose terminally ill
son with her husband Henry (Sam Robards) lies cryogenically frozen in a
hospital, speaks the code words that activate David's emotional
circuitry, there's no turning back.  David will always love Monica and
crave her love in return forever--long after she may become tired of him,
long after whenever she dies.</P>
<P>        Thus raises that question: how to sympathize with David when his
feelings are as synthetic as the rest of him, turned on with the flip of
a figurative switch?  Just like any machine programmed to do a job, David
is completely focused on his: loving his "mother" no matter what, never
once questioning this pursuit of her reciprocal love.  Such singleminded
obsession has a distancing effect by design, but any detachment is
bridged by Osment.  Look no further than the emotionally brutal scene
where David and Monica part; only a true heart of ice won't be affected
by Osment's wrenching wails for Monica.  But the true genius of his work
are its fine subtleties: the slight but undeniable differences between
pre- and post-"activation" David; the distinctly mechanical mobility of
his body that belies the deep well of feeling in his eyes, which in turn
belies the potential for danger that can be sensed from within him.</P>
<P>        So when _AI_ moves away from the placid confines of the suburban
Swinton home and into the wild and woolly world of such locales as the
neon-drenched, hedonistic urban center known as Rouge City or--in the
film's most stunning sight--a Manhattan that is all but completely
submerged in water, Osment's David remains a captivating companion on an
increasingly strange and surreal journey.  Along the way David and his
loyal "supertoy" sidekick Teddy (a real marvel of top-notch puppetry,
CGI, and voiceover work) hook up with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a robot
whose name says all one needs to know about his purpose in the world. 
This character, played with an appropriately oily sexuality by Law, is a
bawdy original, but he's mostly around just to provide David with a hand
to hold.</P>
<P>        Gigolo Joe personifies ("mechanifies"?) the most fascinating and
frustrating quality of _AI_: the tension between the opposing
sensibilities of Spielberg and Kubrick.  At times the mixing and clashing
works, as in the first act, where Spielberg apes Kubrick with alarming
accuracy in the chilly, clinical tone and sterile environments; and it's
hard to imagine the famously cynical Kubrick being able to pull off the
wallop that a proven button-pusher like Spielberg brings to the
aforementioned David/Monica scene.  But as the film progresses, the odd
coupling becomes more problematic.  Gigolo Joe and Rouge City suggest a
Kubrickian naughty streak, but they've been neutered by Spielberg, in the
end rendered less edgy than they could (and should) have been.  And for
all the genuinely powerful moments Spielberg is able to wring, his
weakness for easy sentimentality peeks through at the wrong moments--in
an otherwise harrowing sequence set at a "Flesh Fair" where mecha are
violently destroyed for the entertainment of "orga" (humans);and
especially in the film's most debated-about section, the final 30
minutes.  For some it's a lovely and deeply touching coda; for others
it's Spielberg's desperately heavyhanded and completely gratuitous final
act of emotional extortion.  I fall under the latter camp, for all the
schmaltz--however expertly acted by Osment--comes after what would've
been a far more poetic and appropriate conclusion.</P>
<P>        The ending may leave a sour aftertaste, but there's no
discounting--or forgetting--the sights and sounds that Spielberg and the
spirit o' Stanley bring to the screen along the way.  Cinematographer
Janusz Kaminski, production designer Rick Carter, and effects crews at
the Stan Winston Studio and ILM out do themselves in making these
stunning imaginings of the future a cinematic reality.  But the most
astounding effect of all is not mecha, but orga: Osment's transcendent
performance.  His character may not be real, and neither may his
character's love, but his talent most certainly is.</P>
