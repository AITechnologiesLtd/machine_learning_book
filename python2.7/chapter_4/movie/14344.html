<P>IF THERE WERE WAS A REAL DOCUMENTARY ABOUT A TRUE EXPERIENCE, AND ONE
ESCAPES IT TO TELL THE STORY, THIS IS IT.  THERE AREN'T VERY MANY BETTER
DONE DOCUMENTARIES THAN THIS ONE.</P>
<PRE>          !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P> I happen not to be a great fan of Francis Ford Coppola.  After the first
Godfather film, I dropped out.  The sequels, can gather all the accolades
and reviews, I am not going to see them.  Peggy Sue was fun.  Pennies from
Heaven I fell asleep on.  But the stuff he has produced for others, now that
is something else.</P>
<P>While being extremelly receptive to world cinema, he also tries to invest in
as many foreign film makers as he can, probably hoping Hollywood will notice
someday.  Unfortunately, when is all said and done, and  written about, the
real genius behind his work is not Francis at all, and his ideas, or
intellectual pursuits.  This documentary is even better than Francis' own
work.  And the reason why is because she doesn't quit because there has to
be an explanation.  She keeps going, and one gets to see more action, than a
script has ever seen.</P>
<P>Essentially, this is a documentary about the making of Coppola's now famous
'Apocalypse Now' film, and its incredible problems during the shooting of
the film, which had to be done in an area where the rebels were fighting the
Marcos government, and that was devastated by a monsoon, by Martin Sheen's
heart attack, and by a preponderance of an over stuffed Marlon Brando.  But
it was Francis' ability to be able to match the fury, and beauty, of the
moment which made his film a success.  Despite the fact that he had to
ransack his house, and all his personal belongings, to achieve it.</P>
<P>The basic premise of 'Apocalypse Now' is Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness.
The real premise of this documentary is the real Joseph Conrad's Heart of
Darkness not the animated version found on the film.   And it takes  his
wife to see and notice the clear parallels of the story and book.  Here he
is having a breakdown, and she is talking in retrospect about watching a
man go through a cataclysmic event in life, and succeeding at it.</P>
<P>Eleanor's observations are incredible, and really show Francis as a smaller
person, because he is so emotional where she is so steady.  He is
extravagant.  Se says she could do without it all, the china and what not,
in fact she'd prefer that she didn't have it all, and enjoy a simpler
existence. and we are watching her husband nearly kill himself with his
vision.</P>
<P>It is an amazing little trek through the jungles of man's idealistic, and
often cruel mind ( sounds familiar Joseph? ) which results in an
achievement eventually.  There are no better parallels to make. this is it.
Where literature does not meet film, it's where it becomes film.</P>
<P>With added new music by Carmine Coppola, and touched up by the Grateful
Dead's Mickey Hart ( who did ALL the sound effects and percussion for the
original film, which tells you that Francis was aware of Hart's musical
curiosities, and expansion as a musician and person ) this film becomes
another impressive work.  It's hard to believe it isn't a real movie on its
own......it sure feels like it.</P>
<PRE>A MUST SEE.
