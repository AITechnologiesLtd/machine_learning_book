<PRE>"As Good As It Gets"</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by Heather Picker</PRE>
<P>Directed by James L. Brooks. Written by Brooks and Mark Andrus. Starring
Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Greg Kinnear, with Cuba Gooding, Jr. 1997, 139
min., Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>There were moments during "As Good As It Gets" during which I knew that
the film had the potential to live up to its title. Admittedly, the script is
among the most sharply written of the 1990s, and probably the best script of
1997. But the movie was longer than it should have been, and awkwardly overly
sentimental at times, among other things.</P>
<P>Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is an obsessive-compulsive romance novelist
whose greatest character fault is his bigotry and abrasive personality, most
notably his tendency to become verbally abusive towards everyone with whom he
crosses paths. A crucial part of his routine is dining at the restaurant where
waitress Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) serves him. He brings his own plastic
eating utensils, and is gruff towards other patrons, employees, and even Carol,
but he is also interested in her.</P>
<P>Carol has difficulties of her own, including the severe asthma that
plagues her young son, Spence. She is a single mother, raising Spence in an
apartment with her mother  Beverly (Shirley Knight), who is unhappy with
Carol's unhappiness. "As Good As It Gets" follows the progression of the
Melvin/Carol relationship, throwing into the mix Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear),
an artist who lives in the apartment neighboring Melvin's.</P>
<P>Simon is gay, which Melvin makes a point of demeaning, and Simon has a
dog, Verdell, who Melvin makes a point of hating (and dumping down garbage
chutes). After walking in on a group of young men, the friends of a street
hustler (Skeet Ulrich) he has been painting, robbing him, Simon is severely
beaten. During his recuperation, Melvin is forced into caring for Verdell, at
the behest of Simon's protective art dealer (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). Man and man's
best friend bond, as will eventually Melvin and Simon.</P>
<P>As he begins to recover, Simon, emotionally and physically drained,
arrives at the conclusion that he should visit his parent's in an attempt to
mend fences with the father who has disowned him, and the mother who stands
idly by her husband, although she disagrees with him. Oh, yeah, Simon is also
going to ask them for money. Melvin is given the great distinction of serving
as chauffeur, and asks Carol to join the expedition. She accepts, partly
because she is intrigued by Melvin, and partly out of silent obligation. He is,
after all, paying for Spence to receive the medical care that Carol and her
mother could only dream of before. (He says he is doing it because he needs
Carol to be at work so she can cook for him.)</P>
<P>The road trip provides the chance for everyone to get to know each other
better, but by the time they're on their way back home, "As Good As It Gets"
has run out of steam. There is one ending too many, mainly the Melvin/Carol
resolutions that are basically re-treading previous encounters, you'll be
thinking to yourself "This seems awfully familiar," because the same things
have happened in different settings several times already.</P>
<P>James L. Brooks, who has directed such contemporary classics as "Terms of
Endearment" and "Broadcast News," has a style all his own that is easy to
recognize, and is in full-form here. The often-sparkling script, courtesy of
Mark Andrus and Brooks, is brought vividly to life in three of the best
performances of 1997. Nicholson is completely convincing as Melvin, and Hunt is
able to display the full range of her talents, which until recently were partly
showcased weekly as a mostly comedic actress on NBC's "Mad About You." If you
thought she was good in "Mad About You," wait till you see her in this. Greg
Kinnear, whom I best remember as the host of the hilarious cable show "Talk
Soup", gives a wonderfully nuanced turn as Simon. The supporting players,
including Cuba Gooding, Jr., Skeet Ulrich, Shirley Knight, and Yeardley Smith
(voice of Lisa on "The Simpsons") are all great.</P>
<P>"As Good As It Gets" is not as good as it gets, but is fitfully within
reach of being so. Nicholson and Hunt's Oscar-winning performances (Kinnear was
nominated for Supporting Actor) and an often daring and darkly comic script are
some of the better things "As Good As It Gets" has to offer, and the only real
disappointments are the repetitive incidents and anti-climactic ending (as was
the case in "Broadcast News").</P>
