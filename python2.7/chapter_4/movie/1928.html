<P>     As a child, Caine (Tyrin Turner) was raised in a "den of thieves,"
with a heroin-addicted mother and a gun-toting, drug-pushing father.
At the age of five, Caine learns how to shoot a gun and witnesses his
father kill someone in cold blood.  By the time of his high school
graduation, he's already a seasoned drug pusher.  One night, he and his
friend O-Dog (Larenz Tate) go into a store to get a beer.  O-Dog takes
exception to a remark made by the owner and, with Caine standing by his
side, guns the man down.  From this point on, the pair start down a
road of crime that nothing can rescue them from--not even the fear of
death.  In fact, when Caine's grandfather asks him if he wants to stay
alive, his response is, "I don't know."</P>
<P>     This will not be the only review written that compares MENACE II
SOCIETY to BOYZ 'N THE HOOD, but it may be the only one to liken the
movie to RESERVOIR DOGS.  As I see it, there are definite similarities
between the Hughes Brother's film and those of Singleton and
Tarantino.</P>
<P>     The setting of MENACE and BOYZ is the same and the overwhelming
specter of explosive violence hangs over both.  Each in its own way is
a powerful indictment of what life has become for a black man in the
inner city and how the only escape through violence is into the grave.
While BOYZ 'N THE HOOD has as its main characters a couple of "good"
kids, MENACE II SOCIETY focuses on the other side.  Caine and O-Dog are
criminals, given to using their guns to solve problems.  Nevertheless,
they are portrayed sympathetically and the audience comes to understand
and even care about Caine, even though it's impossible to endorse his
actions.  Hence the comparison to RESERVOIR DOGS, a movie that, among
other things, had a group of murdering thugs as its main characters,
and whose success depended on the audience making an emotional
connection with the villains.</P>
<P>     MENACE II SOCIETY has a number of lessons to teach, all of which
are delivered without the whiff of a sermon.  The story and characters
are well-developed and we get to see graphically the wages of the kind
of life that Caine and O-Dog have chosen.  The lure of money, prestige,
and power are realistically presented, but no moreso than the brutal
payment that is exacted to obtain them.  Also at issue is the necessity
of a person accepting the consequences for his actions and how an
apparently inconsequential event can trigger a disastrous
chain-reaction.</P>
<P>     This is one of the most devastating movies to come along in a
while.  Few films these days have the power to keep an audience sitting
in stunned silence for the first few seconds of the final credits.
This, if nothing else, is testimony to how hard-hitting the conclusion
of MENACE is.  The movie pulls no punches, and for that reason, some
viewers may be offended.  The gory results of violence are displayed
with little concern for the sensibilities of the less-hardened members
of the audience, and the explicit language earns MENACE II SOCIETY its
"R" rating before the opening New Line Cinema logo leaves the screen.</P>
<P>     For MENACE II SOCIETY to work, the characters have to be real.
Especially in the case of Caine, into whose youth we are given a
lingering look, they are.  Equal credit must go to the writer and the
actors.  Except for Charles S. Dutton, whose role is little more than a
two-scene cameo, none of the performers are well-known, but there isn't
a stiff in the bunch.  The Hughes Brothers obviously knew what they
wanted before going out and getting it.</P>
<P>     Frankly, this is not an enjoyable movie.  It's too stark and
powerful to function as simple entertainment.  Those that set foot in a
darkened theater showing MENACE II SOCIETY should prepare for something
in the nature of an experience.  It won't be a fun time, but you'll sit
through ninety-seven minutes that won't quickly be forgotten.</P>
