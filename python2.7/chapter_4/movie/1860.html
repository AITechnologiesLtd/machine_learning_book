<P>     A group of eight friends gather together at the camp where they
spent several halcyon summers two decades ago.  The camp director,
Uncle Lou (Alan Arkin) has invited them back for a final get-together
as he prepares to close the camp.  Of course, there are various
interpersonal dramas that have to be resolved.  The marriage between
Matt (Vincent Spano) and Kelly (Julie Warner) is on the rocks, a
situation that is exacerbated by the presence of Matt's old flame
Jennifer (Elizabeth Perkins).  Jack (Bill Paxton) is trying to come to
terms with his past.  A year after her husband's tragic death, Beth
(Diane Lane) is still trying to recover.  Jamie (Matt Craven) brings
alone his fiancee Gwen (Kimberly Williams), who is ten years his
junior.</P>
<P>     There are some pretty good laughs in this film.  One hilarious
sequence involves Sam Raimi (the director of such films as the EVIL
DEAD series) attempting to transfer baggage from a canoe to a dock.  In
another scene, Bill Paxton relates the humorous events surrounding his
first erection.  Both of these instances, as well as a few others, had
the entire audience in stitches.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the good-but-uneven sense of comedy and some
excellent performances cannot camouflage the shallowness of the plot,
the ineptness of the direction, and the pitifully juvenile dialogue.
This movie desperately needed someone competent to take control, and
writer/director Mike Binder is clearly not that person.  Someone in
high school could have crafted better lines for the characters, and
Binder is obsessed with close-ups.  He too often uses them in the most
inappropriate of places, diluting tension and weakening interaction
between the actors.</P>
<P>     The story is simplistic and the character conflict weak.  There
isn't an original moment in the film.  Coming-of-age stories have been
done so often that for one to make an impression, it needs to find a
new angle (PETER'S FRIENDS, Ken Branagh's recent film, although clearly
superior to this production, fell into the same trap--little that's
new).  INDIAN SUMMER doesn't even attempt to strike out towards new
ground.  It finds a comfortable, cliche-filled groove and sits there.</P>
<P>     The ensemble cast does a marvelous job from top to bottom.  Alan
Arkin, the consummate professional, is wonderfully dry as director of
the camp.  Kevin Pollak puts his wit to good use, although his
one-theme jokes become tiresome after a while.  Sam Raimi, not known
for his acting, gives a credible performance as the glassy-eyed, inept
Stick.</P>
<P>     The actors are so good, in fact, that despite being given
paper-thin characters and embarrassing lines, they almost pull it off.
Now and then, I found INDIAN SUMMER drawing me in simply because these
performers are nearly perfect.  All of them have been in good projects
in the past and doubtless we will be graced by additional fine
performances in the future.  If there's a reason to see INDIAN SUMMER,
and it's a very slim one indeed, it's to see the cast.</P>
<P>     INDIAN SUMMER is Mike Binder's semi-autobiographical tale about
summers that he spent at camp.  Obviously there's a lot of nostalgia
involved for him, but he fails to get it across to the audience.  Cheap
cinematography tricks like graying out the film won't suddenly cause
the audience to wax sentimental.  Binder fails in both the directing
and writing fronts and if he hadn't chosen such an exemplary cast, this
could have been a real disaster.  As it is, INDIAN SUMMER is just a
singularly unremarkable and uninteresting movie.</P>
