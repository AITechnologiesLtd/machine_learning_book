<PRE>                          THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is Jonathan Demme's adaptation of a novel
by Thomas Harris and it knocked my socks off.</P>
<P>     It is a thriller about serial killers, one known and in
high-security detention, one unknown and on a bloody rampage.  The
former is played by Anthony Hopkins, who has created the creepiest, most
disturbing villain I have ever seen in a movie.  He is totally
convincing as "Hannibal the Cannibal," alarming, charming and vile,
intelligent, perceptive, a human animal.  If Hopkins doesn't get a
best-actor nomination next year, it will be because the film was
released too early in the year, although how anyone who sees his
performance can ever forget it is beyond me.</P>
<P>     He forms a bizarre alliance with an FBI agent-in-training played by
Jodie Foster.  Foster turns in an excellent performance that ought to
establish her as a creditable adult actor.  Her performance isn't as
flashy as Hopkins, but it's thorough and convincing throughout.</P>
<P>     I have only one cavil: the other, on-the-loose killer is a gay man.
Okay, there are probably a proportionate number of gay people among
killers and psychopaths as in the world at large.  But I can see no
particular reason why this one has to be gay.  Because he thinks he's a
transsexual the film seems to say.  Hogwash!  I think the real reason is
that a stereotype and a prejudice is being exploited and I say shame on
Demme and company.</P>
<P>     One of the things I like about SILENCE is the way the film plays
with who are good guys and who are bad guys.  Hopkins, for instance, is
presented as exactly what he is and yet at the end we like him, knowing
full well the evil he does.  Another character, who is on the right side
of the bars, the director of the asylum where Hopkins is kept, is
clearly marked from the beginning as a villain and we cheer his final
fate.  The other killer, "Buffalo Bill," is presented without any
ambiguity--all bad, but interesting.</P>
<P>     There are consistently good characterizations of the major players,
all too rare a quality in contemporary scripts.  In particular, we learn
a lot about Foster's character--even though she is a woman, contrary to
such movies as THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS and RUSSIA HOUSE.  Also, I was
pleased that no one had to fall in love with anyone else, although two
intriguing friendships develop for Foster.</P>
<P>     The film is ably photographed without particularly drawing attention
to itself or making any obvious contribution to the meaning of the film,
unlike a film such as L.A. STORY where the camera's love affair with Los
Angeles is a substantial part of the film.</P>
<P>     One WARNING: this film is a very tense affair with blood, violence,
and mutilation.  Most of the worst happens out of the range of the
camera, but enough is shown and the rest talked about so it may disturb
some viewers excessively.  Several people in my audience clearly
couldn't take it any more and exited after one particularly grueling
scene.  There is also strong language and some nudity.</P>
