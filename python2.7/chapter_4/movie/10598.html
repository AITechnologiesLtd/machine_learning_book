<P> Computers are making cartoons obsolete. Take Gore Verbinski's `Mouse Hunt' for
 instance. Could they have made a live action film using Tex Averyesque cartoon
 physics any other way?</P>
<P> No! Besides real people are far more belivable than cartoon people, a fact
 that isn't true for animals.</P>
<P> William Hickey plays the late Rudolph Smuntz, who leaves his sons Ernie(Nathan
 Lane) and Lars(Lee Evans) an extremely antiquated string factory (even the
 workers are antiques), a derelict house and a box of precastro Cuban cigars.
 Unfortunatly, Ernie and Lars manage to drop old dad into a sewer, and there's
 a whiff of a curse in the air...</P>
<P> The curse [which is implied, but never actually stated]works almost
 immediately. Lars' wife April (Vicki Lewis) immediately kicks him out of the
 house, the ancient box of cigars sprout cockroaches in the kitchen of Ernie's
 chic restaurant, killing the mayor and his business in one fell swoop, and our
 two heroes are homeless and friendless, but there is the old house, which
 turns out to be the missing work by the great 19th century architect LaRue.</P>
<P> This is a live-action cartoon, so the laws of physics are against them, and
 not only that, but a cartoon mouse in live-action drag is living there! Tom
 and Jerry meets Laurel and Hardy! Lane even gets the tie stchick right! </P>
<P> Christopher Walken is great as the exterminater the two hire get rid of the
 title character, and the climax is just what you'd expect...in a good way of
 course.</P>
