<PRE>"The Golden Bowl" </PRE>
<P>Adultery is the key word in the latest effort by the directing, producing 
and writing team of James Ivory, Ishmael Merchant and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala 
as they bring yet another Henry James novel to screen life in "The Golden 
Bowl." </P>
<P>Adam Verver (Nick Nolte) is a fabulously wealthy American industrialist, 
possibly the world's first billionaire, living in the lap of luxury in 
Europe with daughter, Maggie (Kate Beckinsale). They meet, in their 
travels, a self-styled matchmaker, Fanny Assingham (Anjelica Huston), who 
does her darnedest to get Maggie together with handsome, penniless Prince 
Amerigo (Jeremy Northam) from Italy. Fanny also pushes Adam into the arms 
of Charlotte Stant (Uma Thurman), Maggie's closest friend. Unknown to the 
Ververs, their soon-to-be spouses have just recently ended their own torrid 
love affair because the poor prince could not possibly marry an equally 
poor commoner. But, is the affair really over? </P>
<P>This is the third film that Merchant/Ivory/Jhabvala have adapted from the 
collected works of turn of the 19th century American novelist James. ("The 
Europeans" and "The Bostonians" were their previous efforts.) I have never 
been a fan of James's late 1800's era stories, finding his work too stern 
and without humor, unlike, for instance, Jane Austen, whose earlier period 
work - of Englishmen, rather than Americans - are bright and full of wit. 
James is more concerned with the darker side of the human psyche and "The 
Golden Bowl" is burdened with an almost relentless dourness with it's tale 
of deceit and infidelity. </P>
<P>The story keeps its focus on the four principals and the dynamics of the 
weird quadrangle of relationships. There's the close, almost spousal, bond 
between Adam and Maggie, as the father and daughter have had to depend on 
only each other for many years. A formal link exists between Maggie and 
Amerigo as the princely pauper uses his wife's vast wealth to rebuild his 
family estate. Amerigo is devoted to Maggie, but it's a devotion based on 
selfish motives, not love. Charlotte still actively lusts after Amerigo, 
but plays the game of loyal and loving wife to Adam. She and Maggie retain 
their best friendship even as she cuckolds her friend, but rends soon form 
in the delicate fabric of the relationships of the four. It's a lusty story 
that must have titillated the libidos of the reading public at the time the 
book was published. </P>
<P>Nick Nolte is proving to be one of the best senior actors in the business. 
He plays, basically, the other side of the coin of the character he created 
in Oliver Stone's "U-Turn." But, where that film's Jake McKenna (Nolte) was 
rich, powerful and ruthlessly evil, Adam Verver is rich and powerful, too, 
but also kind, generous and zealously devoted to his daughter. Nolte puts 
completely different spins on his characters, always making them unique. 
Beckinsale's Maggie is such a good, loving person, that she is almost too 
good to be a real person. The actress gives dimension to her performance 
and a believable, loving grace to Maggie that garners sympathy. Northam 
seemed miscast, at first, as the Italian-accented Prince Amerigo, but soon 
displays the selfish weakness of the man convincingly. Uma Thurman, never 
one of my favorite actresses, is terrific as the hedonistic, conniving 
Charlotte and reps one of her best perfs to date. Award considerations are 
not out of line. </P>
<P>Supporting cast is limited, but there are a couple of interesting 
characters floating around in the background. Huston, as Fanny, plays that 
catalyst that gets things in motion among the principals. Her accent strays 
between American/Southern and American/Neutral, but the role she plays is 
important to the fabric of the film. James Fox does a fine job in the small 
role of Fanny's husband and confidant, building his Bob Assingham into a 
real, and amusing, person. </P>
<P>The symbolism of the titular object is wrought throughout the film as the 
apparent perfection of the golden bowl, like the perfection of the 
marriages, is suspect and the flaws become obvious to the players and the 
viewer alike. The juxtaposition of the cracks in the bowl and obvious 
marital flaws of the characters is obvious, and a little heavy-handed, 
symbolically. </P>
<P>The production, as expected from this team, is sumptuous. The film looks 
terrific with authentic-feeling period sets and costumes, showing off the 
talents of a veteran group of behind-the-camera craftspeople. The lush, 
crisp photography by Tony Pierce-Roberts captures, vividly, the actions of 
these aristocrats and their times. Director Merchant musters his forces 
well, but, in the end, the story doesn't compel me, making the film feel 
too long. </P>
<P>"The Golden Bowl" is a strong effort that is burdened by the source 
material or its adaptation - not having read the novel, it's hard to tell. 
I give it a B. </P>
