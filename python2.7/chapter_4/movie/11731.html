<PRE>                           PRIMARY COLORS 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                    1 :-)  for the American President</PRE>
<P>Cast: John Travolta, Emma Thompson, Adrian Lester, Billy Bob Thornton,
Maura Tierney, Kathy Bates, Larry Hagman, Paul Guilfoyle
Director: Mike Nichols
Producers: Mike Nichols
Screenplay: Elaine May based on the novel by "Anonymous" (Joe Klein)</P>
<P>One has to compliment John Travolta for perfecting his accent too match
that of President Clinton and from a distance even looking like him.
Emma Thompson has the hair thing down to a Hilary Clinton, and although
she finds it hard to kick the English accent completely, does a good job
impersonating the 1st Lady.</P>
<P>There is nothing like running a Presidential campaign. The lying,
cheating, sleeping about, cover ups, tearing down, scandalising, rumour
spreading, deceptions, name calling, fraudulent defaming etc etc.
Everything you've heard and hate about politics … well it's true.</P>
<P>So does this movie harm the Clintons' public popularity? I don't think
so, because when all is said and done, this movie tells us not to judge
a person for what they have done in the past (no doubt referring to the
sex scandals), but what they can do for the nation in the future. So
three cheers for Bill and the US of A. Another point made by this movie
is how difficult it is to practice clean politics in an arena full of
hungry lions. Also how the pure ideals of hopeful young presidential
candidates become corrupted by the crooked way the game is played.</P>
<P>This movie gives us a close look at what it's like to run a campaign.
The strategy planning, staying a step ahead of the opposition, how to
get public votes, using the media and damage control. Although this is
not engrossing material for a Friday night at the movies, it is still a
fascinating subject. For those of you thinking about getting into
politics, take a long hard look at this movie before jumping into the
Hornets nest. Kathy Bates (MISERY) gives us another powerful performance
as a political strategist that may get a nod from the Academy next year.</P>
