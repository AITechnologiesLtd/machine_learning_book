<P>Susan Granger's review of "GOODBYE, LOVER" (Warner Bros.)</P>
<P>         This darkly comic, unpredictable, tantalizing thriller will
confound you. In fact, I defy you to predict what happens when a
saucy, seductive, manipulative real estate agent (Patricia Arquette),
who is married to an alcoholic public relations exec (Dermot
Mulroney), becomes the predator in an obsessive affair with his slick,
pompous, high-powered older brother (Don Johnson) who, in turn, is
adored by his mousy, insecure assistant (Mary-Louise Parker). It's
their warped penchant for vicious murder and grisly mayhem which
summon a nasty, cynical, wise-cracking detective (scene-stealing Ellen
De Generes) to the scene. In Los Angeles, self-realization and upward
mobility aren't easy tasks and, with this sociopathic quartet of
characters, nothing is what it seems to be - including the familiar
score of "The Sound of Music," which is integral to the story. Writers
Ron Peer, Joel Cohen, and Alec Sokolow have devised what Warner
Bros. describes as a "film gris," as opposed to "noir," which is apt,
since "gris" in French means "gray," and there certainly are a lot of
shady gray areas in this shrewd, superficial, twisted tale of
avarice. And, in a change of pace for his career, director Roland
Joffe ("The Killing Fields," "The Mission," "The Scarlet Letter") has
embraced and enhanced the imaginative, off-center wryness of it. He
keeps the tension taut, revealing only select pieces of the
deliciously intricate puzzle, one at a time, with credit going to the
superb lighting and camera work of Dante Spinotte
("L.A. Confidential").  On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Goodbye, Lover" is a cynical yet captivating 7. It's so irreverent,
amoral, and gleefully exuberant that even the most jaded will get a
surprise or two.</P>
