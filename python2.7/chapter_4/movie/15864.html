<PRE>AMITYVILLE: IT'S ABOUT TIME (1992)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Mike Watson
Copyright 1999 Mike Watson</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: 3 out of 5</PRE>
<P>This surprisingly good entry in the much maligned Amityville series of
haunted house films is finely acted, cleverly written, and directed
with some flair by Tony Randel whose other credits include HELLRAISER
II</P>
<P>It's actually in the film's favour that the original Amityville house
is only obliquely related to the premise of AMITYVILLE: IT'S ABOUT
TIME.  The writers have taken the more challenging option of crafting
a fresher story, rather than simply recycling the horrors of the
original film where the Kurtz family was driven from their home by
maloevant spirits.</P>
<P>Jacob is an architect of housing developments who, after a visit to
New York state (home of the infamous house), returns home to his
family with a beautiful old clock salvaged from the said house when it
was demolished.  Needless to say, the clock is no ordinary timepiece,
and before long the clock is attempting to possess its new home by
causing hallucinations and weird shifts in time.</P>
<P>Not entirely original stuff, for sure, but there are two factors which
elevate this film above your standard haunted house fare.</P>
<P>One is the characters.  Writers Christopher Defaria and Antonio Toro
create an interesting family situation here.  Jacob's ex-lover Andrea
plays a kind of surrogate mother to his two teenage kids, even though
she doesn't live with them anymore.  Shawn Weatherly gives a finely
nuanced performance as Andrea, who struggles to keep everyone's sanity
intact as reality begins to unravel.  She is also wrestling with
ambivalent feelings towards Jacob, who becomes increasingly unstable
after being bed-ridden by a bizarre and savage dog attack.  Further
colour is added by Damon Martin as the teenage son Rusty. He loves is
heavy metal but he's more sensitive than his peers give him credit
for, as his friendship with the eccentric medium Iris demonstrates.</P>
<P>The film's other strong point is the inventive set pieces.  In a
highly erotic scene, the daughter Megan wakes during the night and
plays with her reflection in the mirror, only to see her reflection
take on the persona of a lover and reach out from the mirror to untie
her blouse.  Later on, when Andrea attempts to destroy the clock, the
axe she's wielding lands in the wall instead, part of which crumbles
away to reveal the insides of a gigantic timepiece, as if the clock
had rooted itself in the house like a tree.</P>
<P>Perhaps the films most masterful scene features Andrea's new boyfriend
Leonard, a pain-in-the-arse pychiatrist type who comes to stay with
Andrea at the house while she is caring for the bed-ridden Jacob.
Sitting in the kitchen as the microwave oven counts down a late night
meal, the digital clock slurs to a standstill and he suddenly finds
himself face to face Jacob on the other side of the kitchen table.
Jacob questions the trembling Leonard about his interest in Andrea,
and then produces a revolver.  It's a wonderfully tense, edgy scene.</P>
<P>AMITYVILLE: IT'S ABOUT TIME isn't going to set the world on fire, but
its a solid, imaginative thriller and deserves some attention.  If,
like me, you've always been suspicious of those direct-to-video
releases that turn up on the shelves at your local video store, here's
a movie that proves the old adage: don't throw the baby out with the
bath water.</P>
