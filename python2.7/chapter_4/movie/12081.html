<P>Barney, that big purple dinosaur everybody loves to hate, is finally
stampeding off your local PBS station and into movie theaters everywhere. Some
are laughing, some are vomiting, and some are just plain baffled that such an
occurrence has indeed taken place. But let's get one thing straight - Barney
is not and never was intended for adults, so, keeping that in mind, grab your
imagination caps and head into the wonderful world of BARNEY'S GREAT
ADVENTURE: THE MOVIE.</P>
<P>Over the river and thru the woods, Cody (Trevor Morgan), his little sister
Abby (Diana Rice), and her best friend Marcella (Kyla Pratt), are heading to
Grandma and Grandpa's house for a summer vacation. Cody, who's getting to that
mature age of 12 or so, is having doubts about the trip . . . there won't be
any cable TV to entertain him, just a farm complete with smelly, noisy pigs.
On the other hand, Abby and Marcella couldn't be happier it seems, running
around, playing hide-and-go-seek and tag, and basically using the most archaic
toy of all - their imaginations. It doesn't take long for Cody to find
something to do - he steals Abby's precious Barney doll and taunts her
relentless efforts to retrieve it. That is until, lo and behold, the 14" plush
replica of the big purple dinosaur magically transforms into the life-size,
walking and talking, singing and dancing, genuine article.</P>
<P>Always a skeptic, the first little bit of the film follows Cody as he tries to
shrug Barney off as an oversized, grape colored hallucination. But the more
Barney dances and prances around the barn, singing rounds with Abby and
Marcella, the harder this is for Cody to do. Eventually, the four of them
unite when a mysterious, color-changing egg is found and, thru the help of
neighbor Mildred Goldfinch (Renee Madeline Le Guerrier) and her extensive
library, they discover it is a magical wishmaker, able to grant everyone's
wish once all the colors have changed. The trouble is, the egg is constantly
being misplaced, and if it isn't returned to the exact spot it was found by
the time all the changes have taken place, it will never work. This leaves the
group on an city-wide, hour-long expedition to recover the magical egg,
allowing for plenty of sing alongs and guest appearances by Barney's humble
friends, Baby Bop and BJ.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, and luckily, there are very few moments that will actually make
even the most sophisticated of adults want to cringe. The only time I was
highly agitated was when Baby Bop came onscreen with her whiny, piercing
squeal of a voice. Like the television series, Barney happens to be the least
annoying character there is, and thankfully, none of those nauseatingly over-
zealous kids from the show appear in this movie. Morgan, Pratt, and newcomer
Rice all handle their roles as well as can be expected, although Pratt is
given very little to do besides tag along. Their performances are a bit corny,
but for a kids' film, not much more can realistically be anticipated, and any
hokeyness can be attributed as much to director Steve Gomer as the actors. But
once again, these are details that nobody extremely interested in seeing this
film is going to care about. The target audience of preschoolers isn't likely
to scoff at the low-budget special effects or mock the amateurish acting
abilities, and since this film is for them, and not us, why should we be so
quick to trespass on their innocent wonderment with our magicless, adult
cynicism?</P>
<P>All I can say is, thank heavens there's not a "Bananas in Pajamas" movie . . .
at least not yet. I know most people out there are ready to lynch Barney, but
it's those oversized Aussie fruits that scare the heck out of me. They're
creepy! So, however much you may despise Barney, there are plenty of TV shows
we should be rejoicing haven't been adapted into big screen versions,
especially when nearly every TV show seems to wind up there eventually. Did we
ever have to suffer a "Hee Haw" movie? Alas, from many of the right
perspectives, BARNEY'S GREAT ADVENTURE: THE MOVIE is quite tolerable, and if
you're under five years old, it's probably wonderful.</P>
