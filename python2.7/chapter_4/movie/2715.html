<PRE>                                 FORREST GUMP
                       A film review by Eugene R. Ahn
                        Copyright 1994 Eugene R. Ahn</PRE>
<P>Starring: Tom Hanks (Forrest), Robin Wright (Jenny), Gary Sinise (Lieut),
          Sally Field (Forrest's mother), Mykelti Williamson (Bubba)
Directed by: Robert Zemeckis</P>
<P>     It has been a long while since I felt motivated to write a movie
review.  Frankly, the ones I've seen in that long span have been either
awful or only superficially entertaining.  For example, take SPEED--a
claustrophobic action flick led by a hollow scarecrow of a protagonist
whose only charm is his lucky survival instincts (in real life, better
known as just "luck").  Eventually the soul-less movie blows itself up
by stretching our suspension of of belief like silly putty with
ludicrous scenes, such as "bus leaps over a hundred-foot gap on a
highway."  All in all, SPEED was nothing but a cheap thrill, and quickly
forgettable.</P>
<P>     What makes SPEED forgotten summer fodder and FORREST GUMP
(directed by Robert Zemeckis of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? and BACK TO
THE FUTURE fame) one of the best movies of 1994 is the difference in
devotion to characterization.  GUMP has its own stretches of the
imagination, and one could say that they were equally as non-plausible
as a bus leaping a hundred feet across a broken highway, but when GUMP
lands you cheer, because the story is about Forrest always.</P>
<P>     The story begins simply enough.  Forrest is at a bus stop and
tells his life story to a previously unknown bystander.  His southern
accent is thick and his speech is slow.  The woman sitting beside him
ignores him, probably thinking he lacks something upstairs, and reads a
People magazine instead (oh, the irony, eh?).  But while Forrest lacks
intelligence, he slowly wins the audience over with his simplicity,
honesty, and innocence.</P>
<P>     His story begins in Alabama, his home town, and we immediately see
that he is scorned for various handicaps--leg braces for a bad back and
an IQ of 75.  We see that his widowed mother (played by Sally Fields)
is, shall we say, determined to see that he gets a fair education
despite his handicap.  Finally, on his first bus trip to school, he
finds his first friend in Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) who offers the
seat beside her.  We later learn that Jenny is abused by her father,
but Forrest lacks the intelligence to understand the problem exactly.
He only knows he loves her companionship, and as he would repeat
throughout the film, "We was like peas and carrots together."
Forrest's relationship with Jenny has echoes of Faulkner's Benjy and
Caddy.</P>
<P>     Then in a hilarious plot turnaround, Jenny indirectly helps
Forrest realize that he can run without his leg braces and just like
that, the audience is suddenly taken for a ride through the highs and
lows of American history.  Forrest's newfound speed leads to his
recruitment onto a college football team.  He graduates and enlists in
the army to fight in Vietnam.  Eventually he meets Kennedy and Nixon in
the White House, he plays ping pong against the Chinese and attends a
peace rally in DC.</P>
<P>     Throughout the movie, Robert Zemeckis almost flawlessly
interweaves Tom Hanks into actual footage of past US presidents and
prominent historical moments.  The result is impressive.  The
adventures that Forrest endures become hauntingly familiar and make our
empathy with Forrest stronger.  A musical score highlighted by a
healthy diversity of popular tunes from their respective decades also
helps ground Forrest's experience into our own.</P>
<P>     One of the great attributes of GUMP is how well the script holds
together as it jumps from historical moment to the next.  Forrest's
three friends--Jenny, Lieutenant Dan Taylor, and Bubba (the latter two
he befriends in Vietnam), his lack of intelligence, and his ability to
run all hold the narrative into a well-developed, progressive plot.  It
would be almost corny in another script, but Zemeckis gets away with it
because Forrest has been clearly characterized as innocent and simple-
minded.  Instead of grunting in disbelief, we laugh because it is
Forrest we are laughing at, not the script.</P>
<P>     While Forrest seems almost destined to survive every American
crisis thrown his way, his sweetheart remains, as ever, constantly just
out of his reach as she rides a more dark and radical path.  She
mingles with hippies and the Black Panthers.  She is abused by her
boyfriends, performs in nude bars and she eventually ponders suicide.
There even seems to be a vague reference to AIDS.  But Forrest loves
her no less.</P>
<P>     I don't know what the "social" significance of FORREST GUMP is.  I
have a few ideas, but I know any answer I might offer would be
incomplete because GUMP works too well as a character movie to reduce
it into an idea.  There are great melodramatic moments when Forrest
suddenly hears Jenny call to him at the peace rally in DC and they run
to each other and hug in the pool.  When Jenny revisits her father's
home, collapses and throws rocks at the house in rage, Forrest
comments:  "I guess sometimes ... there aren't enough rocks."</P>
<P>     I think GUMP is about healing the wounds of our past--finding a
reason to stop throwing rocks and to make a peace.  If you leave
watching FORREST GUMP feeling better about yourself, then I think
FORREST GUMP as a movie has succeeded and deserves....</P>
