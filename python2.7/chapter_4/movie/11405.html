<PRE>                           DANGEROUS BEAUTY
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The rewards and hazards of being a
          courtesan in late 16th century Venice are the
          subject of this not-particularly-original morality
          play.  Catherine McCormack is charming as the
          reluctant courtesan who learns to master and
          embrace her work.  The story is not very ambitious
          but is compelling and the view of Renaissance
          Venice is worth the price of admission.  Rating: 7
          (0 to 10), low +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It is 1583 in Venice.  Society has proscribed a place for its
women.  The vast majority are to remain the uneducated maintainers of
households for their husbands.  It is not the most exciting of lives,
but if a woman is sufficiently charming her family may arrange a
marriage to someone prominent.  This will get the woman and perhaps her
entire family good social connections.  And at least the married woman
may hope to live in moderate comfort.  In most arranged marriages love
is not given strong consideration in the choice of a husband.  Families
essentially sell off their daughters for material gain.</P>
<P>     On the other hand a few of the most beautiful women can become
courtesans--mistresses or prostitutes of the wealthy and powerful.
Veronica Franco (played by Catherine McCormack) is in love with
handsome Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell).  But he is from a wealthy family
and her father had died leaving the family with a pile of debts and a
desperate need of money.  As Veronica's mother (Jacqueline Bisset)
tells her she must give up the idea of marriage.  Besides "marriage is
a bargain, not a perpetual tryst."  And it is not profitable enough to
support the Franco family.  Veronica must make the sacrifice of
becoming a courtesan as, she is informed, her mother did years ago.</P>
<P>     The plot follows a very predictable trajectory from here.
Veronica does not want to become a prostitute, but agrees when she
discovers that being a courtesan has its advantages.  It really is the
only way that a woman in Venetian society can escape the heavy
restrictions placed on women.  A good courtesan is allowed to become
educated and, in fact, learning becomes a necessity.  Trained by her
mother, Veronica learns the skills necessary for the new profession and
makes herself the most desirable courtesan in Venice as well as a quick
wit with verse.  We follow her career from being too poor to have a
normal life to having one of the most powerful names in Venice.  But
the fantasy world she comes to know will change abruptly when it
collides with the real world of the Plague and of the Inquisition.</P>
<P>     DANGEROUS BEAUTY was written by Jeannine Dominy based on the book
THE HONEST COURTESAN by Margaret Rosenthal.  The plot is predictable
and even familiar, somewhere between myth and soap opera.  This does
not ruin the story but a less obvious story could have improved the
film considerably.  As interesting as the foreground plot is the view
of life in Renaissance Venice in the background is really what rivets
out attention.  The visual effects are far from perfect, but
occasionally they do create a stunning image, particularly the
recreation of nautical scenes.</P>
<P>     McCormack previously played Mel Gibson's love interest in
BRAVEHEART.  In this film she get chances to display her wit, her skill
with a sword, and her body, one more enjoyable to see than the other.
Rufus Sewell of COLD COMFORT FARM and the current DARK CITY plays Marco
her lover.  There seems to be between Sewell and McCormack genuine
chemistry, a thing too frequently missing from screen love stories.
DANGEROUS BEAUTY is populated with actors who would not seem typical
for a historical film. Fred Ward seems an odd choice to be playing as a
member of the Venier family, but is reasonable if cast against type.
Oliver Platt of FLATLINERS as a competing wit also seems as out of
place in a costume drama thought he did play in THE THREE MUSKETEERS.</P>
<P>     If DANGEROUS BEAUTY has a rather obvious plot and takes the safe
course of exploiting a feminist theme, but the production is well-
mounted, well-acted, and pretty to look at.  I give it a 7 on the 0 to
10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
