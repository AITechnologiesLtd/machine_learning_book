THE AFRICAN QUEEN (1951)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>As I wrote in some of my earlier reviews, I encounter
somewhat embarrassing phenomenon when I watch cinema
classics. There are films that are universally lauded and
cherished as great achievements of seventh art. These are
movies I'm supposed to like and appreciate. But more often
that I would like, I find that some of those films don't
meet my expectations, made sky-high through the decades long
hype. These films, naturally, have some qualities, but those
qualities are not enough to justify their cult status. One
of such examples is THE AFRICAN QUEEN, 1951 romantic
adventure by John Huston.</P>
<P>The plot of the film, based on the novel by C.S. Forester,
is set in German East Africa in September 1914. In a remote
jungle village of Kundi, Reverend Samuel Sayer (played by
Robert Morley) and his spinster sister Rose (played by
Katherine Hepburn) are running Methodist mission. The only
link to civilisation comes in the form of "African Queen",
small river steamer that occasionally brings supplies and
mail. Its owner and captain is Charlie Allnut (played by
Humphrey Bogart), rough Canadian who would warn Sayers about
the war that erupted in Europe. Soon after his departure,
German troops enter village, burn houses and capture
inhabitants for the purposes of forced recruitment and slave
labour. Sayer is so devastated with the shock that he
suffers nervous breakdown and dies few days later. When
Allnut revisits now ruined mission, he finds Rose to be
alone. He volunteers to bring her to safety. He wants to
wait for the end of war in his jungle hideout, but Rose has
different plans. She not only wants to come to the
British-controlled territory, but also comes to the crazy
idea to use Allnut's supplies of explosive to sink large
German gunboat standing in their way. Allnut reluctantly
agrees with her and this is the beginning of the long and
perilous journey.</P>
<P>THE AFRICAN QUEEN was constantly hailed as masterpiece, and
often referenced as movie that finally brought well-deserved
"Oscar" to Humphrey Bogart. But, this film is disappointment
nevertheless - hardly a zenith in the careers of Bogart and
Huston. Of course, there are some good elements, mostly in
the script written by Huston and John Agee. The script uses
good old motive of "opposites attract" by putting two
totally opposite characters in unusual circumstances and
gradually showing the evolution of their relationship, as
well as the evolution of characters themselves. We watch
those characters - uptight, stiff-upper-lip British spinster
and rough and insensitive Canadian riverboat captain -
finding not only that they have more in common that they had
to admit, but also finding romantic attractions towards each
other. Both of the actors who portray protagonists - Bogart
and Hepburn - were past their prime when they made this
film, but they gave superb performance nevertheless, often
using humour to make their on-screen chemistry more
believable.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, when movie doesn't deal with Allnut and Rose,
it gets rather disappointing. The journey itself is
interesting, with many realistic problems and even more
realistic solutions. But the realism of the film is severely
undermined with melodramatic scenes in the latter part of
the film, followed by even more melodramatic, unbelievable
deus ex machina ending. It is even more so with extremely
dated special effects that fail to connect footage shot on
locations in (then) Belgian Congo and British Uganda with
characters obviously shot in London studios. Some of viewers
who are sensitive about "political correctness" would frown
upon not so favourable, even racist, treatment of natives in
this film.</P>
<P>The biggest problem I have with this film is, however, the
lack of historical accuracy. The film suggests that Germans
in East Africa at the start of WW1 had the upper hand, as
well as intention and resources to conquer the whole
continent, using the same brutal force and employing same
methods as Nazis would use in WW2. Nothing could be farther
from the truth. German colonies were scattered and isolated
from mother country, manned by small garrisons and generally
destined to be easily taken over by superior forces
stationed in bordering Entente colonies. It happened with
each of German overseas territories, with the exception of
German East Africa. Local commander, General Paul von
Lettow-Vorbeck, was putting stiff resistance to Entente and
lasted until the capitulation of mother country in 1918,
mostly using the hit and run strategy. That earned him the
reputation of one of the most successful guerrilla
commanders in history, and that success is impossible to
explain without at least some support from local natives.
German forces in East Africa perhaps were as savage as
depicted in this film, but such savagery was probably common
to their Entente counterparts; native Africans had no reason
to favour one colonial master over another. THE AFRICAN
QUEEN, one of the rare that actually deals with this exotic
theatre of WW1, fails to take that into account - flaw that
would be corrected only quarter of century later by
Jean-Jacques Annaud in his NOIRS ET BLANCS EN COULEUR.</P>
<P>Historical inaccuracies, bad special effects and script
flaws aside, THE AFRICAN QUEEN is still entertaining film
which is worth watching. Mostly thanks to excellent
performance of Bogart and Hepburn; two of them would make us
forget that the same story was later told in much better,
yet less celebrated films.</P>
