<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>The premise is simple:  Man moves to small Midwestern town that shares
his name, pretends to be a psychiatrist, and is actually able to offer
better advice than the burg's other two shrinks.  His patients are
quirky and their characters are well-developed and well-played by
capable actors.  Yet, somehow, the film really struggles to be even
mediocre.</P>
<P>Written and directed by Hollywood vet Lawrence Kasdan (French Kiss), who
has a long resume of overly praised middling pictures, Mumford stars
Loren Dean (Enemy of the State) as the fraudulent Dr. Mumford.  He chose
this particular town to set up shop simply because it happened to have
the name of the identity he had recently created to avoid a shady past.
In town for just a few months, Dr. Mumford has quickly become the mental
health M.D. of choice among the Mayberry-esque community, and begins to
take clients from the town's other two shrinks.</P>
<P>His patients are almost too quirky to believe.  The pharmacist (Pruitt
Taylor Vince, Murder One) has steamy sex fantasies straight out of a
Russ Meyer flick; a young bulimic goth chick (Zooey Deschanel) says
things just for shock value; the wife of a successful financier (Mary
McDonnell, 12 Angry Men) is a mail-order shopaholic; and a young lady -
and the doctor's obvious eventual love interest – suffers from a case of
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.</P>
<P>The good doctor is also sought by Mumford's richest individual – a young
skateboarding techno wiz named Skip Skipperton (Jason Lee, Chasing Amy)
who created PandaModem, the town's largest employer and international
business that has nabbed 23% of the modem market's share.  He's worth 3
billion big ones, but would have traded all of it to make the varsity
baseball team.  Skip feels he needs psychiatric help, but doesn't want
to alarm either his stockholders or the townsfolk, who see PandaModem as
a necessity since the timber industry has recently dried up.  So he asks
Dr. Mumford to pretend to be his friend and dispense therapeutic advice
while tossing a football around.  Why would such a happy-go-lucky guy
need mental help?  He's building a synthetic sexual surrogate/companion
(read: sex doll) and is afraid that his latest venture could be wrong
and dirty.</P>
<P>Things proceed as planned for Dr. Mumford until he tosses new patient
and slimy local defense attorney Lionel Dillard (Martin Short) out of a
session for being too irritating.  Dillard turns to Mumford's other two
legit shrinks - Dr. Ernest Delbanco (David Paymer, Payback) and Dr.
Phyllis Sheeler (Jane Adams, Happiness) – and suggests that Dr. Mumford
may be an uneducated impostor, which leads to an investigation and
eventual outing.</P>
<P>Mumford offers precious little that you wouldn't already expect prior to
walking into the theater.  There is only one real stand-out scene – a
great grainy flashback to his previous life and past jobs.  Dean is
merely adequate - his baked-bean teeth are disturbing and distracting.
Lee is totally wasted in a role where he can't curse, able to only
either mutter `far out' or repeat someone else's line in question form.
The supporting players make the film.  Barely.  (1:51 - R for
sex-related images, language and drug content)</P>
