<PRE>                            THE PATRIOT
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: THE PATRIOT is a big movie with
          some big virtues and big faults.  It is a long
          film with handsome production values and some
          subtle script touches, but too many of the
          episodes seem borrowed from children's TV
          adventures.  Still it is nice to see someone
          making the Revolutionary War exciting.  THE
          PATRIOT is at the very least entertaining with a
          very nice look and some valuable history.
          Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The story begins in 1776.  While certain of the American
colonists are engaged in declaring their independence from Britain,
the British are finding it almost impossible to engage the
colonists' army on the battlefield.  The Americans know almost
nothing about fighting and if it could be brought to a European
style battle, the British are almost certain they could bring the
rebellion to a quick end.  (As one of the British in the film puts
it, "These rustics are so inept it nearly takes the honor out of
winning.")  The British have to try a new approach.  Their ace in
the hole is the unpopularity of the rebellion in the southern
colonies like the Carolinas.  If they can sweep from the south, pick
up southern support and sweep north with it, they can probably
capture the Continental Army.  To do this they take Charleston and,
reinforced by locals, are ready for the northward sweep.  Locally
the operation is led by General Cornwallis.</P>
<P>     Benjamin Martin (played by Mel Gibson) is a South Carolina
farmer.  He fought Indians and French in the Indian wars and came
out a war hero, but at the same time he is a man hating what the
wars had done to him.  Now he is a widower with seven children who
wants no part of war.  He watches in fear as the British and the
Americans fight.  He refuses to give his support to the rebellion
even though his eldest child Gabriel (Australian Heath Ledger) is
anxious to fight the British.  Colonel Harry Burwell (Chris Cooper),
a war buddy of Benjamin's, leads the locals.  Finally Benjamin lets
Gabriel join up.  As the months pass the war gets closer and closer
to the Martin Farm.  But it takes Gabriel's return, wounded and with
army dispatches, to bring his father into the war.  The merciless
Col. William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) finds Gabriel at the farm and
against the rules of war sentences him to hang.  In a feeble attempt
to resist, a brother is killed and Tavington orders the house razed
to the ground.  Benjamin knows less feeble ways to resist and is at
long last drawn into the seemingly impossible conflict. Soon he is a
rebel leader hiding in the swamps and known by the nickname "the
Ghost" and putting some of the honor back into the winning.</P>
<P>     If all this sounds like the beginnings of a children's movie,
perhaps a reframing of adventures of Robin Hood, the facts will
certainly bear that interpretation.  There are many good things
about THE PATRIOT, but the core of the plot is not one of them.
There are episodes in this film one would expect from a children's
TV show.  While there are some nice battlefield scenes, when
Benjamin fights the British hand-to-hand, they are far too easy to
beat.  One shot and they are dead.  It is almost like knocking down
nine-pins.  People are a lot harder to kill than that.  Benjamin
Martin is in part based on Francis Marion, nicknamed "the Swamp
Fox."  A part of preparation I did to see this film was to watch
Walt Disney's THE SWAMP FOX, starring Leslie Nielson.  This is by
far the nicer production but at heart I would put the two stories on
a par with each other.  The film is directed by Roland Emmerich and
produced by him and Dean Devlin.  This is the team responsible for
STARGATE, INDEPENDENCE DAY, and GODZILLA.  They consciously aim
films at a level of young teenagers, and THE PATRIOT is no
exception, though the historical recreation, the costumes, the look
of the film, all should make this a film of interest to a wider
audience than the basic plot would alone.</P>
<P>     While the plot is on a childish level, the script as a whole is
somewhat better.  Written by Robert Rodat, author of SAVING PRIVATE
RYAN, the film contains some rather noteworthy discussions of the
ethics of war.  Tavington, the blood enemy of Martin, sort of this
films Sheriff of Nottingham, is totally ruthless with his enemy and
is happy to slaughter any of the enemy who get in his way.
Cornwallis (played by Tom Wilkinson) and several others of the
British do not buy into his concept of total war and are shocked at
his brutality.  This sympathy to particular British, even while
making the British the enemy may seem like a small thing, but notice
that in films like GANDHI there are almost no sympathetic British
characters.  It is nice to see someone saying that as a colonial
power Britain had some scruples.</P>
<P>     With the exception of its treatment of the British colonialists
the script tries a little hard to be politically correct.  Most of
the Americans we meet are against slavery and live in friendly
neighborliness with a colony of blacks.  There have been some
protests that Benjamin Martin is based on Francis Marion and Marion
is currently interpreted as being what we would call a racist.  In
fact he seems to be based only in part on parts of him.  Martin
should probably be considered a wholly fictional character.  While I
am on the subject of discussions of the philosophy of war, there is
a marvelous exchange between Cornwallis and Martin in which
Cornwallis complains that it is wrong for Martin to target British
officers.  If you kill off the officers and leave just the men you
will have chaos on the battlefield, he complains.  In one sentence
he douses us with culture shock and sums up the differences of 18th
century warfare and the more modern brand that was coming.  That may
well be the best written line in any film I have seen this year.</P>
<P>     Culture shock is just why one wants to see historical films.
How many Americans have had an opportunity to look out their front
window and see two armies fighting?  How many have seen the battle
wash like a wave over their homes?  Luckily almost nobody since the
Civil War.  It is rare that we see any film about the Revolutionary
War and far rarer that we see that war from the eyes of the southern
colonies.  Still some of what we see is a little hard to believe.
Several of the scenes created for this film seem to have been
digitally enhanced so they seem less like real photographic scenes
and more like nicely composed paintings.  But nicely created is what
we see of the day-to-day life in the southern colonies.  This part
was overseen by experts from the Smithsonian Institute and what we
see does have an air of authenticity.  Some of the battle scenes are
also authentic in a brutal sort of way.  The destruction done by
swords and cannonballs and even musket balls obviously could be
fairly brutal compared to the relatively clean wounds made by
bullets.  If anything this film underplays how much gore there
really was in a battle, though seeing Gibson go at someone with an
Indian hatchet (mercifully behind foliage) and seeing pieces of
person flying is something that parent should be warned against
before bringing young children.  The costume work with this film is
excellent.  Some of the scenes with Mel Gibson riding with the
banner of the American flag are a bit over-ripe in the same way as
scene that people complained about in THE POSTMAN.  John Williams
has written a decent score, though at times it is reminiscent of
Hans Zimmer.</P>
<P>     Mel Gibson is a good actor, probably better than most with his
popularity, but some of what was needed for this role he just did
not have.  He does not express sadness well.  When Clint Eastwood
loses his home and family in THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES you do feel his
loss.  Gibson does not convey the same sort of loss well.  Chris
Cooper has been an actor I have looked for since MATEWAN.  He is
becoming a lot easier to find.  AMERICAN BEAUTY seems to have made
his name, but recently I have seen him in OCTOBER SKY, and two days
before THE PATRIOT he was in ME, MYSELF & IRENE.  Other notables in
this film include Rene Auberjonois, Tcheky Karyo, and Tom Wilkinson.</P>
<P>     On a plot level THE PATRIOT is a disappointment, but most
everything else is done well.  That earns the film a 7 on the 0 to
10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
