<P>About one dozen characters meet naturally or fortuitously (read: pretty
artificially) in California's San Fernando Valley where dark deeds are done
in a violent yet comic film that parodies noir films.  Not in the
extra-broad, burlesque style of Mel Brooks ("Blazing Saddles," "Young
Frankenstein," " High Anxiety"), or the "Airplane!" and "Naked Gun" movies
and such, but in "serious" yet tongue-in-cheek fashion.</P>
<P>The characters have a strong family resemblance to the creatures of Quentin
Tarantino, with a nod to David Lynch, but they are relatives, not clones.
They criss-cross paths in a choreography that recalls (from a lot to
somewhat) those of Robert Altman, Robert Rodriguez ("El Mariachi,""
Desperado") Richard Linklater ("Slacker"), Wayne Wang ("Smoke") and other,
mostly newish filmmakers.</P>
<P>The cast has James Spader as a diabolically sadistic killer, so chilling
that he makes many other cold assassins look like ice-cream;  Dany Aiello
as a very Italian-American hitman on the skids who is employed and
exploited by Spader; Becky Foxx as a divorcee would-be victim; the Brit
Gregg Cruttwell (whose feature debut was in the marvellous "Naked") as an
obnoxiously self-centered art dealer with acute kidney-stone pains; Glenn
Headley as his ill-treated secretary; Paul Mazursky as a has-been, suicidal
Hollywood writer-director; Marsha Mason as the art dealer's sister; Jeff
Daniels and Eric Stoltz as a pair of mismatched vice detectives. Others
flesh out the story.</P>
<P>The film's kernel is a devilishly convoluted, outlandish yet clear plot
that deals with money, a stash of $30,000. This is a sum too small by
today's standards to justify so much mayhem, but then, to it is added an
unknown, presumably larger amount of insurance money.That other money is
dragged into the tale in a most improbable way. I won't let the cat out of
the bag, but when you see the film, think of the status of the beneficiary
and you'll see what I mean.</P>
<P>Then again, logic is not the movie's purpose. Beyond some very unlikely or
far too coincidental meetings there is a whole list of items ranging from
the improbable to the impossible. Among them: a bulletproof vest, a person
who is immune to a humongous car explosion,  kidney stones used as a red
herring, shoot-outs as weird as those in some Westerns, skylophobia (fear
of dogs), unexpected cinephilia (the Mason character), a Norwegian spandex
queen who sounds as Scandinavian as Marilyn Monroe  ... I'll stop here for
fear of giving away the story.</P>
<P>Crazy though it is, the story is suspenseful , entertaining in its bloody
way, and bloody well played. The actors ham it up (or down) skillfully. In
his despair, Paul Mazursky (the director and occasional actor), is actually
touching. His love for his dog adds to the pathos. The underworld figure
Aiello is irresistibly simpatico, funny (especially when he cooks for his
captives), surprisingly kind and decent. Headley's sparse dialogue and
reactions quickly establishes her as a natural sweetheart (no saccharine
here).  The insufferable Cruttwell reminds me of the cynical editor in TV's
"Dream On." Teri Hatcher, always a bridesmaid but never a bride in winter
sports, is miles away from her Lois Lane of TV's "Los and Clark." Jeff
Daniels, bearded twice in succession (after "Fly Away Home") is credibly
cast against type as an overbearing policeman on the psychotic side. Eric
Stoltz has a warm presence. And so on down to incidental characters. Louise
Fletcher, in a mere walk-on role, creates a likable character in a matter
of seconds. With more lines but still in a supporting role, Austin
Pendleton delivers a creepy-funny performance.(He is the jerky, talky
small-time actor who, meeting Mazursky in a park, jokingly and cruelly
twists in him -- figuratively speaking-- the knife of failure). Even
Mazursky's terrier Bogey and Cruttwell's pit-bull Marc deliver. When you
accept the fact that this is more fantasy than realism, every creature in
the cast has its function.</P>
<P>Theirs is not true ensemble acting since characters don't bounce all that
much off each other, yet, within the oddball combinations and permutations,
it is good, skilled professional  playing. There is also a savvy, ironic
feel  for the Valley, one that should affect viewers familiar with the
place though not the many who have merely heard of the Valley's malls and
the Valley girls.</P>
<P>The dialogue is lively, the sets are eye-catching, the cinematography by
Oliver Wood ("Mr. Holland's Opus") is excellent, minimally showy,
ungimmicky, often lyrical in  unexpected ways, as when Mazursky walks his
dog. His sense of camera placement is clever without being showoffish or
gimmicky. The  frequent  close-ups and extreme close-ups reinforce  people
and events. For this type of picture, you could almost call the photography
subtle.</P>
<P>"2 Days" is instant gratification. What it will look like ten years from
now is anybody's guess. I say "instant" because, in a manner that is
typical of most U.S. films --whether Hollywoodian or Independent -- there
are no residues or reverberations that stay on in the viewers' hearts or
minds.</P>
<P>While the characters function very well, there is no  real depth or
dimensionality to them. Typically, character complexity is replaced by
character colorfulness, This can entertain but has limited staying power.</P>
<P>Making his feature-film debut here is writer-director John Herzfeld who has
much TV experience. When he says: "For me the entire movie is about
redemption--how someone can save  another person, and thereby save
themselves" he is merely spouting pretentious hokum by trying to add a
subtext to a film that is all surface.</P>
<P>The movie fits a certain new current which will increasingly beget
imitations. This is dangerous, since, in showbiz parlance, topping a gag or
a situation often works,  but topping the topper, like a trapeze act
without a net  can lead to disasters. Think of wise Johnny Carson who would
make a joke, top it, then sometimes try to go himself one better. Generally
this third stage was greeted with friendly audience boos. A masterfully
sheepish Carson would tell them :" I know, I shouldn't have tried for
three."</P>
<P>That said, whatever the future holds, I must admit that when I left "2
Days" I was thinking in terms of  a  ** 1/2 rating.  Later though, with
harder reflection, it was easy to upgrade it to  ***.</P>
