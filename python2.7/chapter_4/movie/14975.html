<P>Chucky's never gonna die, and neither is this ongoing series of sequels
dedicated to the "good guy" toy from hell! Hong Kong director Ronny Yu
tackles this fourth part with stylish gusto, and adds an extra spice in
for effect: a bride for chucky, bien sur. Does Chucky really get lucky
in this one? You bet!!!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Chucky the killer doll is resurrected by his buxom ex-girlfriend Meg
because she believes that the spirit within Chucky, her real
ex-boyfriend mass murderer Charles Lee Ray, will come back to life and
marry her. Unfortunately for her, Chucky the wonder-knife has other
plans, and decides to bring her along as his rubber doll companion. The
slashing duo's plan is to retrieve an amulet that will allow their
spirits to rejoin physical human vehicles. Murder, mayhem and
all-around gruesomeness ensues.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Entertaining, funny, campy sequel scores points for originality,
humour, great murder scenes, and the ever-loveable personality of
Chucky the psycho-doll! As sexist and rude as ever, Chucky steals every
scene in which he makes an appearance, with his beautifully psychotic
smile, and the addition of a handful of new murders to his rap sheet.
Just as cool is his sidekick Tiffany (with a splash of romance and
sensitivity tossed in), who actually manages to give white trash a good
name! The slick animatronics, the hip dialogue, the myriad of in-jokes
paying homage to other horror film contemporaries make this movie very
enjoyable, while allowing your brain to take the evening off for drinks
and a rest.</P>
<P>Not to mention the wonderful performance set forth by Jennifer's
Tilly's breasts who do a superb job of blending the character of the
film with the essence of her character. Her cans have done wonders
before, but this wonderful performance by her boobs is one to truly
cherish and consider "for your consideration". Her rack is sizeable,
luscious, delectable and plump in almost every scene, and manages to
portray every range of emotion from gregarity and jolliness to
melancholy and surprise. Her cleavage also makes an excellent showing,
and I'm not afraid to say this, almost brought me to tears in one
particular scene. </P>
<P>Having said that, the
no-name-big-breasted-standard-horror-film-girlfriend was quite a
disappointment in my esteem, as was the
washboard-stomach-cardboard-cutout-boyfriend, who looked like a 32-year
old attempting to play a teenager (Perfectly cast for "Beverly Hills
90210"). The soundtrack was also extremely lame for a movie of its
revived genre, but the few Rob Zombie songs did manage to soothe my
musical hunger just a tad. All in all, this film is a good time at the
movie theatre for all those who want to see a movie about an evil
rubber doll who spews crude and foul remarks, the girl doll that loves
him, and the party of bloody bodies that get in their way. Warm up the
nachos, ice the Coke, take off your underwear, and prepare to have
yourself a brainless, good ol' time at the horror show!!! </P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
The first time that the full cinematic trailer for Gus Van Sant's
remake of PSYCHO was shown in the theatres was before this film.
Keep a close eye on the first scene, which offers a wink of the eye to
many of its horror sequel competitors, including Jason, Mike Myers and
Freddy Kreuger.
Screenwriter Don Mancini has a part in writing all four of the CHILD'S
PLAY films. He also co-executive produced this one.
This film was previously titled CHILD'S PLAY 4, CHILD'S PLAY 4: BRIDE
OF CHUCKY, CHUCKY and CHUCKY AND HIS BRIDE.
Brad Dourif did the voice of Chucky in all four CHILD'S PLAY films, and
also portrayed the original spirit of Chucky, mass murderer Charles Lee
Ray in the first film.</P>
