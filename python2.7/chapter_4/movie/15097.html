<P>To help make ends meet, retired schoolteacher Dora (Fernanda
Montenegro) works as a letter-writer in Rio de Janeiro's Central
Station. Illiterate working people approach her table and dictate
letters to lovers and family members, which she transcribes. The irony
is that Dora's life is empty of such human relationships.</P>
<P>Each night she returns to her apartment and receives visits from her
next door neighbor Irene (Marilia Pêra), who is also alone in the
world. Dora spills out her bitterness at humanity, including the
clients who have put their trust in her. She goes through their
letters with Irene and makes fun of the human feelings contained in
them. Half go directly into the garbage can, because she thinks they
are not worth posting. The other half end up in a desk drawer, to be
posted when she gets around to it. While she picks apart the poor
folks whom she writes for, Irene, a few years younger and less bitter,
pleads for clemency while usually being overridden.</P>
<P>One day she is approached by Ana (Sôia Lira) and her nine-year old son
Josué (Vincius De Oliveira). She wants to send the boy up to the
remote northeast area of Brazil to meet his father for the first time.
She dictates the letter to Dora and gives her a photo of the boy to
send to the father along with the letter, so he will be able to
recognize him when he arrives. Dora takes the letter back to her
apartment and sticks it in her desk drawer.</P>
<P>The next day Ana is run down by a bus in front of the train station.
The homeless Josué has no place to go and begins spending his days and
nights in Central Station. Every so often, Dora--despite
herself--offers him a kind word or a sandwich. There is a nationwide
epidemic of homeless children in Brazil, a problem that was treated
cinematically in "Pixote." Many of these children turn to crime in
order to survive and their prospects for survival are bleak. "Central
Station" shows a teenager being gunned down on the railroad tracks by
a cop for the crime of stealing a walkman.</P>
<P>In a mixture of opportunism and pity, Dora takes Josué to an adoption
broker. She receives a thousand dollars and is assured that he will be
sent to a "good family" in the United States. She buys a new Sony TV
with her commission and shows it off to Irene. When she explains how
she got the money, Irene screams at her. Nobody will adopt a
nine-year-old. They will kill him and sell the organs on the open
market. Dora, who still has a tinge of affection for the boy, decides
to rescue him from the broker and personally take him to his father.</P>
<P>Thus begins a remarkable journey that is unlike any I have ever seen
in a film. It is a "road movie" that simultaneously takes the bitter
old woman and the child deep into Brazil's countryside, and into the
recesses of their own hearts. Through a series of mishaps, the two
find the journey much more daunting than they first expected. They
learn to rely on each other's emotional support and street smarts. In
the process, he forgives her for selling him to the broker, while she
begins to experience love for another human being for the first time
in her adult life.</P>
<P>What gives their odyssey additional power from a cinematic standpoint
is the on-location filming in the roadside cafes, bodegas and small
towns in Brazil's dry and mountainous northeast. The characters whom
we meet in these scenes appear to be ordinary Brazilians from the
area, whose faces are much more beautiful and appropriate to the
action than any professional actors' could be.</P>
<P>The casting of Dora is critical to the success of the film. In the
production notes, Director Walter Salles describes 67 year old
Fernanda Montenegro as Brazil's Gena Rowlands or Giulietta Masina. She
is an enormously intelligent actress who has starred in the leftist
film "They Don't Wear Black Tie." The choice of Marilia Pêra is also
interesting since she played the prostitute who ran with the gang of
child outlaws in "Pixote." Vincius De Oliveira was a shoeshine boy
whom Walter Salles discovered outside a small airport in downtown Rio
de Janeiro. He says, "Because it was raining and he didn't have any
clients at the moment, he asked me to help him buy a sandwich. He told
me that once I returned from the city of Sao Paulo that afternoon, he
would pay me back." In other words, the shoeshine boy who is cast as
Josué really is a Josué.</P>
<P>"Central Station" hearkens back to some of the greatest films of
Italian neo-realism like "The Bicycle Thief." It will also remind you
of the films of Satyajit Ray, whose affection for common folk did not
preclude a critical view of their foibles. The difference between
"Central Station" and the garbage coming out of Hollywood each week
lies in the social and economic differences between Brazil and the
United States. Countries that are living on the edge, like Ray's
India, De Sica's postwar Italy or Brazil today can foster art that
gets closer to the human condition. The desperation borne out of
economic and social dislocation can work on the sensitivity of the
sympathetic novelist or film-maker and great art often emerges.</P>
<P>While "Central Station" does not offer any pat answers to Brazil's
problems, there is no doubt that the obstacles that economic hardship
puts before the disadvantaged appall Walter Salles. Dora is not some
kind of political activist. Indeed, her cynicism would make her an
unlikely candidate. Instead she articulates the hopes of ordinary
Brazilians for a society in which love and happiness is the rule. We
are reminded of the title of Ken Silverstein's study of the Workers
Party: "Without Fear of Being Happy."</P>
<P>Yesterday, somebody sent me some email trying to figure out where I
was going with my articles on Marxism and indigenism. I tried to
explain that it was part of a life-long struggle to redefine a
socialism on the basis of freedom from want, in an environment of
human solidarity. Like the characters in "Central Station," the great
majority of the human race is looking for love and companionship on a
personal and communal basis, while not having to worry about where the
next meal is coming from. Nearly everything else is extraneous.</P>
<P>The director Walter Salles understands this completely. In explaining
the critical acclaim the film has received, he says:</P>
<P>"...I think the question of the search is very important in the film.
We're talking about the woman who searches for her lost feelings and a
boy who searches for his father. Since the Greeks, I think we've
always been concerned with the idea of getting back to the place where
we come from--to try to understand who we are. This is the boy's
plight, but what the two of them discover is not only the family at
the end of the film, but the importance of companionship, friendship
and understanding.</P>
<P>"In a way, these values are not really appreciated in today's very
competitive society, where efficiency is everything. These questions
of solidarity or friendship or everything that's important in the film
are not rated in the Stock Exchange. This might also be one of the
clues to why people respond to the film in such an emotional way. It
talks about things that are not perceived as important but are
extremely important for our survival."</P>
